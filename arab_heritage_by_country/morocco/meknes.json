      "content": "Meknes (Arabic: مكناس, romanized: maknās, pronounced [maknaːs]) is one of the four Imperial cities of Morocco, located in northern central Morocco and the sixth largest city by population in the kingdom. Founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids as a military settlement, Meknes became the capital of Morocco during the reign of Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), son of the founder of the Alaouite dynasty. Sultan Ismail created a massive imperial palace complex and endowed the city with extensive fortifications and monumental gates. The city recorded a population of 551,503 in the 2024 Moroccan census. It is the seat of Meknès Prefecture and an important economic hub in the region of Fès-Meknès.\n\nEtymology\nMeknes is named after an Amazigh (Berber) tribe historically known as the Miknasa (Imeknasen in Amazigh languages).\n\nHistory\nEarly history (8th–16th centuries)\nVolubilis, a major Roman-era settlement in Morocco and one of its early urban centres, is located near the site of the current city of Meknes. The current city and its name, however, originate with a Berber tribe called the Miknasa who settled this region around the 10th century. A group of small unfortified Miknasa villages known as miknāsat al-zaytūn were established here in the 10th century. The Almoravids founded a fortress or fortified settlement just south of these villages after conquering the area in the 11th century. Originally called Tagrart or Taqrart, this Almoravid settlement formed the beginnings of what is now the old medina of Meknes. The Nejjarine Mosque, often reputed to be the oldest mosque in the city, dates back to the Almoravid period and may have served as the central mosque of the Almoravid settlement. The mosque that became the present-day Grand Mosque of Meknes is believed to have been first built by the Almoravids in the 12th century.\nThe fortress resisted the military advance of the Almohads, who destroyed the city after a long siege in the 12th century. However, at the beginning of the 13th century the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir (ruled 1199–1213) rebuilt the city and its fortifications, as well as its Grand Mosque. The city enjoyed relative prosperity in this period, before being conquered again by the new Marinid dynasty in 1244. The first kasbah (citadel or governor's district) of Meknes was created afterwards by sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in 1276 CE – the same year that the citadel of Fes el-Jdid was built in nearby Fes, the new capital. During this period, Meknes was frequently the residence of Marinid princes (often appointed there as governors) and especially of viziers. The Mosque of the Kasbah (the later Mosque of Lalla Aouda) was also founded and first built in 1276. The Marinids also carried out major restorations to the Grand Mosque in the 14th century and built the major madrasas of the city near it. The latter included the Bou Inania Madrasa (built in 1336) and two other madrasas, Madrasa al-Qadi and Madrasa Shuhud, all built by Sultan Abu el-Hassan.\nAfter the end of the Marinid and Wattasid periods, however, Meknes suffered from neglect as the new Saadian dynasty (16th and early 17th century) focused their attention on their capital at Marrakesh and neglected the old northern cities of Morocco.\n\nThe reign of Moulay Isma'il (17th–18th centuries)\nIt wasn't until the Alaouite dynasty in the second half of the 17th century that Meknes received renewed attention. Under Moulay Rashid (ruled 1666–1672), the first Alaouite sultan to unite Morocco under his rule, Fes became the capital once more and his brother, Moulay Isma'il ibn Sharif, governed Meknes. Upon Rashid's death in 1672, Moulay Isma'il became sultan and chose Meknes as his new capital. In addition to his possible attachment to the city as a governor, a number of reasons may have favoured this choice. One may have been the fact that Ismail had to fight hard to reconquer both Fes and Marrakesh from his rival nephew (Ahmad al-Mahriz, son of Moulay Rashid) during the first years of his reign, which may have rendered him skeptical towards both cities as possible centers of power. Moreover, Moulay Rashid had garrisoned much of Fes with his own contingents from the Tafilalt and eastern Morocco while Moulay Isma'il was forming his own personal royal guard composed of Black slaves ('abid) from Sub-Saharan Africa, and there may have been concerns that not all these contingents could be garrisoned simultaneously in Fes. The ulema (religious scholars) of Fes were also particularly disapproving of his ways, including his use of slaves (many of whom were of Muslim background), and maintained tense relations with him throughout his reign. Choosing Meknes thus removed him from the influence of traditional elites and allowed him to build a fresh base from which he hoped to exercise absolute power. The threat of Ottoman attacks from the east (from Algeria) and the increasing insecurity in central Morocco due to tribal migrations from the Atlas and Sahara regions may have also persuaded Ismail that Meknes, situated further west, was more defensible than Fes.\nWhatever the reasons, Ismail made Meknes the center of Morocco in his time and he embarked on the construction of a new monumental palace-city on the south side of the old city. Its construction continued throughout the 55 years of his reign, beginning immediately after his accession to the throne in 1672. Existing structures dating from the earlier medieval kasbah of the city were demolished to make way; the name of the large public square in front of the Kasbah today, el-Hedim (or Place el-Hedim), means \"the rubble\" and came from the masses of rubble and debris which were piled here during the demolition. Labour was carried out by paid workers as well as by contingents of slaves, particularly Christian prisoners of war. Estimates on the total number of workers involved range from 25,000 and 55,000. Nonetheless, frequently-told stories about the tens of thousands of Christian slaves used for labour and the large underground dungeons where they were kept are somewhat exaggerated and originate from the accounts of European ambassadors who visited Isma'il's court (often to negotiate the release of prisoners from their countries). In reality, the number of Christian slaves was likely closer to a few thousand at most and the chambers popularly called \"prisons\" were actually storage rooms for grain and supplies.\n\nIt was also in Moulay Ismail's reign that the Jewish inhabitants of the city were moved to a new Mellah or Jewish district to the west, near the Kasbah, not unlike the Mellah of Fes or that of Marrakesh. The Mellah was located between the old medina, west of Place el-Hedim, and the more outlying quarter of Madinat al-Riyad al-Anbari. Both the Mellah and Madinat ar-Riyad were part of an urban extension ordered by Isma'il in the western angle between the old city and the Kasbah. Moulay Isma'il also undertook works throughout the old city too. He refortified the walls and built new monumental city gates such as Bab Berda'in and Bab Khemis. He also built several other kasbahs or garrison forts throughout the city to house his 'abid troops and help protect (and control) the rest of the town, such as the Kasbah Hadrash and the Kasbah Tizimi. He carried out renovations to the Grand Mosque and the nearby Madrasa al-Qadi (which he devotes to students from the Tafilalt), and founded the Zitouna Mosque. Khnata bent Bakkar, one of his wives who was vizier (minister) under him (and briefly became de facto ruler of Morocco in 1728 after his death), was responsible for founding the Bab Berda'in Mosque, completed in 1709.One of the last constructions before his death, carried out between 1721 and 1725, was the Heri al-Mansur, a palace on the far southern edge of the kasbah which included vast stables. The monumental gate known as Bab al-Mansur al-'Alj, overlooking Place al-Hedim, was only finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. His son and brief successor, Moulay Ahmad ad-Dhahabi, carried out modifications to his father's mausoleum during his two brief reigns (in 1727–28 and 1728–29) and was himself buried here in 1729.\n\nLater Alaouite period (18th–20th centuries)\nFollowing Moulay Isma'il's death, however, the political situation in Morocco degenerated into relative anarchy as his sons competed for power. Meknes lost its status as capital and suffered damage in the 1755 earthquake. The city was neglected and many parts of the enormous imperial kasbah fell into disrepair. The site received only occasional royal attention in the following centuries. Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah, who ruled between 1757 and 1790, built a number of projects in the city. He added the Dar al-Bayda Palace in the Agdal garden to the southeast of the main palace complex, which was later turned into a royal military academy. He constructed the Er-Roua Mosque in the southern part of Moulay Isma'il's Kasbah, which became the largest mosque in Meknes. He also renovated and added a qubba over the tomb of Sidi Mohammed ben Aissa (just outside the city walls) and built the current minarets of the Grand Mosque and the Nejjarine Mosque in the old city. The Dar al-Kebira, however, was abandoned and progressively transformed into a residential neighbourhood where the inhabitants constructed their houses within and between the former palace structures of Isma'il's time. In the early 19th century, Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman added a loggia structure in front of Bab al-Mansur which served as a meeting place for ceremonies and the governor's tribunal, though this structure was later removed.\n\nRecent history (20th–21st centuries)\nAfter the installation of French colonial rule in Morocco in 1912, the French administration created a new city (Ville Nouvelle) on a nearby plateau across the valley on the northeast side of the old city. The capital of Morocco was moved from Fes to Rabat, further marginalizing cities like Meknes (which is near Fes). Some traditional Muslim authorities and officials were retained, but Meknes was reorganized under a new French municipal and military regime. This also led to a greater influence of the cities over their surrounding countryside and growing urbanization. The city became a transportation hub for people and goods traveling from east to west or from north to south across the country, in addition to hosting extensive military barracks. The population of Meknes grew from 25,000 at the beginning of the century to over 140,000 by the mid-20th century. Some roads in the old city were widened to accommodate greater circulation, but most of the new development took place in the Ville Nouvelle. The new French authorities took interest in the conservation of historic monuments in the old city; the madrasas, for example, were restored in 1922. During this period Meknes also became a center of agriculture and viniculture, led mainly by French colonists who appropriated large amounts of land nearby.\nNonetheless, Meknes, like other cities, also hosted resistance to French authority. In 1937, a particularly serious and violent revolt erupted following attempts to divert the local river to benefit the French settler population during a time of food shortages for the native Moroccan population. A violent suppression of protests took place in the city which results in 13 dead and more injured. Following Morocco's independence in 1956, the changes which began or accelerated under French rule continued to run their course. Large scale rural migration increased the population of the city and intensified the urbanization process (as elsewhere in the country). Industries developed around the city's perimeter, but at the same time the old elites and bourgeois families moved away to the coastal cities like Casablanca and Rabat.\nThese changes also contributed to the relative neglect of the old city. According to the ICOMOS Heritage at Risk report of 2000, the historic city of Meknes contains insufficient drainage systems, and as a result, suffers from inundation and leakage in certain areas. Still, some conservation and restoration efforts have taken place in recent years, motivated in part by the revenues of tourism. As of 2023, a number of major restoration projects were planned or underway, led by ADER-Fès (Agence pour la Dédensification et la Réhabilitation de la Médina de Fès), a quasi-governmental agency based in Fez. The projects include proposed restorations to the historic city walls, to the Heri es-Swani, and to the Bou Inania Madrasa, along with other improvements to parking and tourism infrastructure.\n\nGeography\nMeknes is located in a strategic position in the heart of Morocco. To its south and south-east are the rich cedar forests and mountains of the Middle Atlas mountains with the cities Ifrane and Azrou; and more to the south are the rich oases of Tafilalt. To the west are the two largest metropolitan areas of Morocco: Casablanca and Rabat. To the north is the mountainous north of Morocco with the cities of Tangier and Tétouan. Oujda and Fes lie east of Meknes.\n\nClimate\nMeknes has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) with continental influences. Its climate is similar to some inland cities in southern Portugal (such as Beja or Évora) and some areas of southern Spain. The temperatures shifts from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months of June–September. Afternoon temperatures generally rise 10–14 °C above the low on most days. The winter highs typically reach only 15.5 °C (59.9 °F) in December–January, whereas night temperatures average 5 °C (41 °F). Snow is rare.\n\nDistricts - Quartiers (in French)\nPrefecture\nMeknes is the seat of the prefecture of Meknès, which consists of 6 municipalities (including the city Meknes) and 15 rural communes.\n\nHistoric monuments and landmarks\nThe main historic monuments of the city are concentrated in the medina (old city) and the vast former Kasbah of Moulay Ismail to the south. The most notable monuments are listed below.\n\nPlace el-Hedim\nOften compared to the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in Marrakesh, el-Hedim Square (Place el-Hedim) is a vast plaza at the southern end of the old city, before the main gates of Moulay Isma'il's former royal palace complex. The square's name, el-Hedim, means \"the rubble/debris\" and refers to the demolitions which Moulay Isma'il carried out here during the construction of his palaces. He left this open space as a public square to separate his palace from the rest of the city. Since then, the square has become the focus of various activities including evening entertainers such as storytellers, acrobats, and musicians.\n\nMosques and madrasas\nGrand mosque of Meknes: The old city's most important mosque and one of its oldest, covering about 3,500 square meters and was founded in the 12th century by the Almoravids, although renovated many times since.\nMadrasa Bou Inania: The city's most famous madrasa (school for higher learning in Islamic sciences) was established by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan in 1335-36 but is now named after his son Abu Inan (who may have later restored it). Open to tourists today, it is one of the most richly decorated buildings in the city.\nNejjarine Mosque: Often reputed to be the oldest in the city, this mosque also dates back to the Almoravid period, though it has been modified multiple times.\nLalla Aouda Mosque: The main mosque of the city's former kasbah and of Moulay Isma'il's palaces, it was first founded in the Marinid era but completely rebuilt by Moulay Isma'il between 1672 and 1678. Its prominent minaret is visible from the adjoining Place Lalla Aouda (Lalla Awda Square).\nBab Berda'in Mosque: The mosque, located near the northern gate of the medina (Bab Berda'in) was completed in 1709 on the orders of Morocco's first female minister, Khnata bent Bakkar. The mosque was the site of a tragedy in 2010 when its historic minaret collapsed, killing 41 people. The mosque has since been repaired and its minaret rebuilt.\nAr-Roua Mosque: The largest mosque in Meknes, it was built by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah between 1757 and 1790. It is located near the Heri al-Mansur palace in the southern part of the Kasbah of Moulay Isma'il.\nZitouna Mosque: A large mosque founded by Sultan Moulay Isma'il around 1687.\nZawiya of Sidi Mohammed Ben Aissa: Also known as the Mausoleum of Sheikh al-Kamel. An important mausoleum and religious complex (zawiya) just outside the city walls to the northwest, originally dating from the late 18th century but restored later. Mohamed ben 'Aissa, founder of the Aissawiya, a major Sufi brotherhood in Morocco, is buried here. He is considered the patron saint of Meknes, and his annual moussem (festival) is one of the most intense and was historically known for its displays of self-mutilation.\nZawiya of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami: A richly decorated mosque and religious complex honoring the tomb of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami, a famous Moroccan poet who died in 1850.\n\nFortifications and gates\nBab Mansur al-'Alj: The most famous gateway of the city (also known as Bab Mansour or Bab el-Mansur), this gate overlooks the southern end of Place el-Hedim and acted as the ceremonial grand entrance to the Kasbah of Moulay Isma'il. It was begun in the later years of Moulay Isma'il's reign and finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. Its name comes from the architect and designer of the gate, Mansour al-'Alj (the \"Victorious Apostate\"), a former Christian slave who converted to Islam. It is notable for its size and its rich decoration consisting of darj-wa-ktaf motifs carved into brick, filled with colourful zellij (mosaic tilework), and topped by a long and elaborate Arabic inscription painted on tile.\nBab Jama' an-Nouar: Another ornate gate located next to Bab Mansur; also called Bab al-Nuwwar in some sources.\nBab ad-Dar al-Kebira: The monumental gate entrance to the Dar al-Kebira palace, dating to 1679–80.\nBab el-Khemis: A monumental western gate of the city, near the former Mellah, dating from 1687 under the reign of Moulay Ismail and richly decorated with motifs and zellij similar to Bab al-Mansur.\nBab al-Barda'in: The monumental northern gate of the city, also built by Moulay Isma'il and richly decorated.\n\nBorj Belkari: A bastion tower built in the 17th century as a part of the defensive walls of the Kasbah of Sultan Moulay Ismail in Meknes, Morocco. Since 2003 it holds a pottery museum.\n\nImperial Palaces of Moulay Isma'il\nThe palace complex or \"imperial city\" of Sultan Moulay Isma'il was constructed over his entire 55-year reign from 1672 to 1727 (with some elements finished or remodeled shortly after). It occupies the site of the city's former medieval kasbah (citadel) and stretches over an area approximately four times larger than the old city itself. It was composed of several autonomous palaces along with vast gardens, religious buildings, and other amenities. The complex was also notable for its impressive infrastructure, which included a water supply system with a hydraulic system of wells, norias (water extraction mechanism powered by wheel), canals, and underground pipes which distributed water to the royal city's many buildings. It also contained numerous monumental granaries and underground warehouses which stockpiled supplies that could allegedly sustain the city for a siege of ten years. Below is a list of some of its main areas and monuments.\n\nPlace Lalla Aouda: A vast open square which stands behind (southeast of) Bab al-Mansur, which served as the former mechouar of the palace. It precedes the former Dar al-Kebira palace and gives access to the Lalla Aouda Mosque.\nDar el-Kebira: The oldest palace in the kasbah, finished in 1679 and itself composed of multiple palaces. Its name means \"the Great House\". It was the private residence of the sultan and his family, connected directly to the Lalla Aouda Mosque and the later royal mausoleum. The palace fell into ruin after Moulay Isma'il's death (and after the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake), and has since become a residential neighbourhood where common people built their houses amidst the remains of Isma'il's massive palace walls, still visible in various places.\nMausoleum of Moulay Isma'il: The royal mausoleum and funerary complex of Moulay Isma'il and some of his family members and successors. It was built under his reign but significantly modified by Ahmad ad-Dhahabi between 1727 and 1729. The funerary complex was originally entered from the dar al-Kebira to the north but is nowadays entered by a 20th-century gate to the south. Still considered a religious site today, it is also open to tourists. It is composed of relatively austere courtyards leading to a richly decorated indoor patio chamber, which in turn grants access to the tomb chamber of the sultan.\nQubbat al-Khayyatin and the Qara Prison: The Qubbat al-Khayyatin is a standalone audience chamber or throne room where Moulay Isma'il once received foreign ambassadors. Underground, right next to it, is a large subterranean vaulted space known as the Qara Prison or Habs Qara. Although frequently described as a prison for Christian slaves, scholars agree that it was in fact a storage area and granary, one of many such structures throughout the royal city.\nDar al-Makhzen: This vast walled enclosure, much larger and more rationally organized than the Dar el-Kebira, contained extensive gardens and two more main palaces in Moulay Isma'il's time, some of which have been restored or adapted for current use as one of the royal residences of the King of Morocco. The enclosure, generally known as the Dar al-Makhzen (not to be confused with the royal palaces of the same name in Fez and elsewhere), was divided into two sections. The western section was mostly occupied by the Bahrawiya Gardens but also contained a long narrow palace on its northern edge known as the Dar al-Madrasa (\"House of the School\"), most likely another private palace of the sultan. The eastern section, which is still entered via an ornate royal gate on its eastern perimeter (north of Heri es-Swani), was mostly occupied by the Qasr al-Muhannasha (\"Palace of the Labyrinth\"). This palace consisted of roughly eight large courtyards or garden enclosures and acted as both a reception palace and an administrative palace.\nHeri as-Swani and the Sahrij (Agdal Basin): The Sahrij or Agdal Basin is an enormous water basin or artificial lake south of the Dar al-Makhzen, which was originally a part of the royal city's water supply system. It measures 148.75 by 319 meters and is, on average, 1.2 meters deep. Next to it, on its eastern side, is an enormous structure composed of two parts: the \"House of the Ten Norias\" or Dar al-Ma (\"House of Water\") and the Heri as-Swani (also spelled as Heri es-Souani). The first of these is a monumental building of vaulted passages and domed chambers which contained a number of wheel-powered hydraulic mechanisms (norias) which drew water from the phreatic table underground to the surface, after which it was delivered into the Sahrij or redistributed to the city. The second part, the Heri as-Swani, is attached to the south side of this building and is made up of 22 rows of monumental arches which once held up a vaulted roof (which has since collapsed). Although frequently misidentified as the \"royal stables\" of the palace, this structure was, once again, a massive granary and storehouse. Grain was originally delivered to the building by mules who climbed onto a roof terrace and dropped the grain directly into holes pierced above each vaulted chamber.\nHeri al-Mansur: One of the last constructions of Moulay Isma'il's reign, built between 1721 and 1725, its name means \"Granary/silo of Victory\", but it was also known as Dar al-Mansur or Qasr al-Mansur (\"Palace of Victory\"). It is located on the far southern perimeter of the Kasbah and consists of a massive building which seems to have served as a palace, fortress, and storehouse. The basement was taken up by storage rooms while the upper floor held reception rooms for the palace with views over the surrounding area. Located next to it were the Royal Stables of Moulay Isma'il (often misidentified today with the Heri as-Swani), which were reputed to be one of the palace city's most impressive features. It consisted of horse stalls sheltered under two parallel arcades (rows of arches) which stretched for 1200 meters on either side of a water canal which provided water for the horses. Unfortunately, the stables have not been preserved and very little remains of them today.\n\nSynagogues\nThe Rabbi Meir Toledano Synagogue still stands in Meknes today. According to tradition, it was first built in the 13th century and rebuilt by the Toledano family in 1646.\nThe Etz Hayeem synagogue in Meknes is also a historical synagogue.\n\nMuseums\nDar Jamaï Museum: The best-known museum in Meknes, housing a number of artifacts and art objects from the city and other regions in Morocco. It is housed in a late 19th-century palace with gardens and ornate rooms built in 1882 by Mokhtar ben Larbi Jamai, who served as Grand Vizier under Sultan Moulay Hassan (ruled 1873–1894). His family also built the Jamai Palace in Fes.\nMusée de Meknès (Meknes Museum): A small museum housed in a structure just northeast of Bab al-Mansur, exhibiting artifacts from all over Morocco.\n\nOutlying sites\nThe ruins of the Roman town of Volubilis (Oualili), another UNESCO World Heritage Site, are about half an hour to the north, as is the village and important pilgrimage site of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun.\n\nEconomy\nMeknes is an economic centre in Morocco with various products from three sectors (agriculture, industry and services), which makes the city economically competitive and attractive for investment.\n\nCompetitiveness\nA December 2015 World Bank report classified Meknes as one of the three most competitive cities in Africa. Two of those three competitive African cities are Moroccan: Meknes and Tangier.\n\nAgriculture\nMeknes is considered to be the capital of agriculture in Morocco. And the Saïss plain is one of the most fertile and rich plains in Morocco and Meknes is the centre of this plain.\n\nEach year Meknes holds the International Agriculture Show in Morocco (French: Salon International de l'Agriculture au Maroc) since April 2006. This agriculture show has an area of more than 250000 square meters, with more than 60 countries participating, and more than 1200 exhibitors.\nThe lands around Meknes area are known to be fertile and productive. The high elevation, fertility and the fresh water of those lands favor the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, most notably: peaches, nectarines, prunes, apples, potatoes, onions and garlic. Meknes is also known for its olives and olive oil. Livestock raising, particularly sheep and cattle, is widespread. Meknes has large industrial units for milk and dairy production that fulfill most of the needs of the region.\n\nIndustry\nIndustry in Meknes is of light type, most of it is related to food processing especially in the Commune of Mejjat, and chemical and para-chemical industry in other industrial zones like the Agropolis industrial and agribusiness zone. Add to those the textile and metallic manufacturing which are old industries in the city. The year 2016 marks a new era of industry in the city of Meknes; it includes electrical wire, embedded systems, and automotive parts production companies.\n\nMajor companies\nServices\nMany of the services products in Meknes are related to tourism due to the attractions of the old city district (the medina).\n\nTransport\nRoad\nThe geographical location of the city of Meknes makes it one of the important transport hubs in Morocco. The city is accessed via the A2 expressway with two exits, one to the east of the city and another to the west.\nThe city's Gare Routière (intercity bus station) is located west of the medina, along with the main station for grand taxis (intercity taxis). A newer station for buses operated by CTM is located near the main railway station.\n\nRail\nTwo train stations are located in the new city district (French: Ville Nouvelle) of Meknes, with trains each hour to the east, west, and north of Morocco. One is larger than the other and serve a different purpose. Operated by ONCF, the following table lists destinations reachable via Meknes railway stations (round-trips):\n\nAs mentioned above, Meknes city has two train stations, and their names are: Meknes Railway Station (French: Gare de Meknès) and Meknes Amir Abdul Qadir Railway Station (French: Gare de Meknès Amir Abdelkader). All the mentioned trains cited in the previous table stop by the former station; and except the first row of the table, all the remaining trains stop by the latter station.\n\nAir\nThe nearest airport is Fes-Saïss Airport (IATA: FEZ, ICAO: GMFF) accessible only by road transport.\nOtherwise, Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca, with more international flights and destinations, is conveniently accessible by train.\nThere is also a military airport in Meknes.\n\nPublic Transport\nPublic transport in Meknes is managed by the urban commune and it consists of:\n\nA large network of buses that cover all the area of the prefecture, and even outside of the prefecture like the line 16 to El Hajeb.\nTaxis in the city exist in two types: small taxis with 3 places Max that work with fares system; and bigger taxis with 6 places Max that have a predetermined trajectory and fixed prices.\n\nEducation\nMeknes is home to the public Moulay Ismail University, with actually the following faculties, schools and institutions divided among three campuses in the cities: Meknes, Errachidia and Khenifra.\nIn Meknes:\n\nFaculty of Sciences - FS, created in 1982\nFaculty of Letters and Human Sciences - FLSH, created in 1982\nNormal Superior School - ENS, created in 1983\nFaculty of Juridical, Economical and Social Sciences - FSJES, created in 1993\nSuperior School of Technology - EST, created in 1993\nNational Superior School of the Arts and Professions - ENSAM, created in 1997\nIn Errachidia:\n\nFaculty of Science and Technology - FST, created in 1994\nPoly disciplinary Faculty - FP, created in 2006\nIn Khenifra:\n\nSuperior School of Technology - EST, created in 2014\nIn addition to Moulay Ismail University, numerous private institutes for higher education exist in Meknes.\n\nInternational relations\nSee also List of twin towns and sister cities in Morocco\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\nMeknes is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nAbdeljalil Hadda, former international Moroccan footballer\nAryeh Deri, Moroccan-born Israeli politician\nAziza Jalal, Arabic pop singer and actress\nDriss Roukhe, Moroccan actor and director\nFaouzi Bensaïdi, Moroccan actor and film director\nKhalid Ismail, Moroccan MMA fighter\nH-Kayne, hip-hop group\nHoucine Toulali, Moroccan Malhun singer and writer\nKarima Abd-Daif, Moroccan-Norwegian politician\nLaïla Abid, Dutch journalist and news presenter\nLatefa Ahrar, Moroccan actress\nMalika Akkaoui, Moroccan athlete\nKaddour El Alamy, Moroccan poet\nChuck Martini (born Choukri Moussaddik), former Moroccan footballer\nMuhammad Al Barka, writer and historian\nMickaël Pariente, author\nCut Killer, DJ and record producer\nSara Chafak, a Finnish beauty pageant of Moroccan origins, Miss Finland 2012\nSalah Eddine El Ghomari, journalist and television presenter\nFarid al-Ansari, religious scholar and writer\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nhttp://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/meknes-mar-mek-mek.htm\nhttp://looklex.com/morocco/meknes02.htm\nMeknesCity Newspaper\n Meknes travel guide from Wikivoyage",

      "content": "Meknès (en arabe : مَكْنَاس, Maknās) est une ville et commune du Maroc, chef-lieu de la préfecture de Meknès au sein de la région de Fès-Meknès. Elle est située sur le plateau de Saïss entre les massifs du Rif et du Moyen Atlas, et son territoire est traversé par la vallée du Oued Boufakrane.\n\nToponymie\nLa ville de Meknès tire son nom de la tribu amazighe Meknassa. Les membres de cette tribu sont appelés les Imknassen au pluriel, Ameknas au singulier. Ameknas signifie en berbère le guerrier ou le combattant. L'appellation Ameknas est utilisée par certains activistes berbères pour désigner la ville.\nPlusieurs localités fondées par les Meknassas portent une appellation homonyme : Mkansa dans la Province de Taounate, Maknassa Al Gharbya, et Meknassa Acharqia dans la Province de Taza, Mequinenza en Espagne ou Meknassy en Tunisie.\nLa ville s'est également appelée Méquines ou Méquinez en français, et l'est toujours en espagnol. C'est ainsi que Voltaire écrivit : « Je voudrais que le tremblement de terre eût englouti cette misérable Acadie plutôt que Lisbonne et Méquines. ».\nDu fait de son rôle de capitale durant le règne d'Ismaïl ben Chérif, la ville est communément désignée au Maroc par capitale ismaélienne; l'abondance des oliviers dans sa région lui confère l'appellation maknassata azzaytūn, qui signifie Meknès des oliviers.\n\nHistoire\nLa région de Meknès est peuplée depuis le Néolithique. Le site archéologique de la capitale maurétanienne antique, Volubilis, qui servit aussi de capitale à la première dynastie musulmane du Maroc est situé dans sa banlieue nord. La ville a été fondée au XIe siècle par les Almoravides en tant qu'établissement militaire.\nElle fut la capitale du pays durant le règne d'Ismaïl ben Chérif (1672-1727), qui y fit édifier plusieurs monuments, dont notamment les hautes murailles entourant le cœur historique de la ville et percées par 70 portes imposantes.\nMeknès est ainsi l'une des quatre villes impériales du Maroc et est inscrite à la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1996 en tant que ville historique regroupant deux entités : la médina et la ville impériale. Sous le protectorat français, la ville vit l'installation d'une importante communauté européenne et son territoire s'étendit au-delà de ses murailles.\nAdministrativement, Meknès est l'ancien chef-lieu de la région de Meknès-Tafilalet et actuellement l'un des deux principaux pôles urbains, ainsi qu'une préfecture de la région Fès-Meknès. La ville est composée de la municipalité de Meknès, Toulal, Ouislane et celle d'El Mechouar Stinia (où se trouve le palais royal). Meknès est la 6e plus plus grande ville du Maroc avec une population de 632 079 habitants selon le recensement de 2014.\nÉconomiquement, la région de Meknès est l'une des plus importantes au Maroc en termes de production agricole, notamment par son oléiculture et sa viti-viniculture. La ville fait ainsi office de pôle agricole national et abrite plusieurs grands groupes du secteur au Maroc comme LCM-Aïcha et Les Huileries de Meknès. Parallèlement à sa vocation agricole, la ville profite du développement du secteur automobile marocain, notamment par l'implantation d'équipementiers automobiles dans ses zones industrielles. D'autre part, malgré son patrimoine culturel et architectural important, et son potentiel touristique reconnu, la ville attire moins de visiteurs que les principales destinations touristiques marocaines, notamment à cause du manque d'infrastructures hôtelières. Plusieurs chantiers sont en cours qui permettraient d'augmenter sa capacité d'accueil de 25 %.\nLes habitants de la ville se nomment M'kansa (M'knasi au singulier) en arabe marocain et Ayt M'knas ou Imeknasn en berbère.\n\nFondation\nFondée au XIe siècle par les Almoravides en tant qu'établissement militaire. Les Almoravides construisent une forteresse appelée Takrart jouxtant les villages et jardins au XIe siècle ; c'est le noyau de la future médina de Meknès qui vit progressivement l'installation de population issue des bourgades voisines.\n\nMoyen Âge\nLa ville, accusée de résistance, est saccagée par les Almohades en 1150 durant leur bataille pour garder le pouvoir contre les Mérinides. Seuls quelques minarets et murs subsistèrent, mais les Almohades entamèrent la construction et la rénovation de plusieurs monuments, dont notamment la Grande Mosquée de la ville. Après leur prise de pouvoir, les Mérinides installent leur capitale à Fès et firent construire plusieurs édifices à Meknès, dont le plus notable est la Medersa Bou Inania. Meknès devint le lieu de villégiature privilégié de leurs vizirs. Après la chute des Mérinides, la ville entre dans une période de déclin.\n\nXVIe – XVIIIe siècles\nÀ la mort du sultan alaouite Rachid ben Chérif, son frère et gouverneur de Meknès, Ismaïl ben Chérif, lui succéda en tant que deuxième sultan de la Dynastie alaouite. Il fera de la ville sa capitale. Sous son règne de cinquante-cinq ans (1672-1727), il érigea des kilomètres de murailles autour de la ville, avec des portes impressionnantes, des mosquées, le bassin d'eau du Sahrij Souani également nommé Bassin de l'Agdal, des galeries marchandes, des écuries pouvant abriter 600 chevaux et des palais. La ville s'étendit alors en dehors de sa médina. 30.000 esclaves et 3000 prisonniers chrétiens capturés en mer durant son règne contribuèrent à cet effort de construction.\n\nAu XIXe siècle\nLe comte de Mornay (1803-1878) y est envoyé en mission diplomatique par Louis-Philippe auprès du sultan du Maroc Moulay Abd er-Rahman (1778-1859). Il est accompagné par le peintre Eugène Delacroix.\n\nLe protectorat français et l'indépendance\nPendant la présence française au Maroc (1912-1956), Meknès porte d'autres surnoms tels que « le Versailles du Maroc », ou « le petit Paris », soulignant la beauté de la cité, ce qui lui valut son titre de plus belle ville impériale du royaume ; elle fut un moment le siège de la résidence du Maréchal Lyautey qui y avait son quartier général.\nEn 1937, l'eau de l'oued Boufekrane, qui arrose la ville, est détournée au profit de 4 colons français, provoquant le mécontentement populaire : une manifestation est réprimée par les troupes françaises le 1er septembre, faisant 10 morts.\nLe quartier le plus populaire est celui de l'ancienne médina dite « Mdina al-qdima », soit ville ancienne en darija, dialecte arabe marocain; c'est là qu'habitait Moulay Ismaïl.\n\nL’accord diplomatique de Rabat du 28 mai 1956, qui stipule que ni la France ni le Maroc ne mèneront de politique contraire aux intérêts de l'autre partie au traité, devient rapidement inapliquable en ce qui concerne la guerre d'Algérie, l'État comme la population marocaines se sentant solidaires de leurs voisins en guerre pour l'indépendance. L'arrestation de Ben Bella provoque de nombreuses manifestations au Maroc. Les plus graves ont lieu à Meknès. Le 23 octobre, 200 Marocains et Algériens manifestent, chantant des slogans pour la libération de Ben Bella et l'indépendance de l'Algérie. Un coup de feu part et tue un garde municipal. Son origine est mal élucidée : il peut s'agir d'un Français qui aurait tiré sur la manifestation de sa terrasse, ou d'une maladresse du garde qui se serait tué avec son arme en repoussant un manifestant d'un coup de crosse. Mais, dans l'atmosphère échauffée d'alors, la présence de 6000 Algériens dans la région et le fait que les terres agricoles appartiennent essentiellement à des étrangers, la manifestation tourne à l'émeute. Elle dure six jours, pendant laquelle plusieurs fermes ont incendiées, 53 Européens sont tués et 39 blessés. Parmi eux, figurent six policiers français du poste de Bar Baroud à l'entrée de la médina, tués par leurs collègues marocains. Bien que quatre condamnations à mort soient prononcées, et d'autres personnes condamnées à de la prison à perpétuité ou des travaux forcés, la répression est jugée trop légère par la France.\n\nVoir l'article détaillé Massacres de Meknès\n\nGéographie\nTopographie\nMeknès est située à environ 500 mètres d'altitude, sur le plateau de Saïss, entre le Moyen-Atlas au sud et les collines pré-rifaines au nord.\nLa ville est traversée par l'oued Boufekrane, qui sépare la médina de la ville nouvelle, dite « Hamria »).\n\nClimat\nLa ville de Meknès connaît un climat méditerranéen dégradé, subissant les influences continentales pendant les saisons d’été et d’hiver. Cependant, la diversité géographique de la région fait que chacune de ses zones naturelles présente des nuances climatiques particulières.\nLe régime thermique de Meknès est marqué par l’éloignement des côtes maritimes atlantique et méditerranéenne, d’où une importante amplitude thermique atteignant 25,4 °C. La température du mois le plus chaud varie entre 30 °C et 45 °C, et celle du mois le plus froid varie entre 0 °C et 7 °C mais il arrive que le gel soit fort, comme le 27 janvier 2005 où il a fait −10 °C.\nGénéralement, les températures varient de la manière suivante :\n\nde janvier en avril : la hausse mensuelle de la température est progressive et régulière. Elle est de l’ordre de 1 à 2 °C/mois ;\nd’avril en août : une hausse mensuelle est de l’ordre de 3 à 5 °C. La température maximale mensuelle est atteinte au mois août, soit 45,6 °C ;\nd’août à décembre : une baisse de l’ordre de 2 à 5 °C par mois. La répartition des pluies au cours de l’année se caractérise par de fortes pluies en automne, une très légère baisse en hiver avec un maximum relatif au début du printemps.\nL’été est généralement sec, la période de pluie la plus importante s’étale d’octobre à mai, avec un nombre de jours avec pluie mensuel de 7 à 10 jours. Le nombre annuel moyen de jours avec pluie est estimé à 70 jours et le cumul pluviométrique annuel de Meknès avoisine les 576 mm.\n\nDémographie\nMeknès est l'une des quatre villes impériales du Maroc. La ville historique de Meknès regroupant la médina et la ville impériale, est classée depuis 1996 Patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO et connait depuis lors diverses opérations de restauration des sites (murailles, portes, ruelles, places publiques…). Elle est maintenant digne des plus grandes villes méditerranéennes et arabes, du fait de sa diversité culturelle. La fameuse place Lahdim a connu, en 2007, deux opérations de restauration et rénovation.\n\nLors du recensement de 2014, la population de l'agglomération urbaine de Meknès, comprenant les municipalités de Meknès, Al Machouar, Ouislane et Toulal, était de 632 079 habitants. En 2004, elle était de 528 740 habitants.En 2021, elle est estimée à 720000. La population est répartie sur les 4 municipalités formant l'aire urbaine de Meknès comme suit :\n\nCette population qui travaille pour la plupart à Meknès fait la navette quotidienne avec le centre-ville, qui abrite la quasi-totalité des administrations de la région Meknès-Tafilalet, grâce à la nouvelle société de transport urbain de bus. Ils sont également desservis par des taxis. La zone rurale est liée à la ville par le réseau de transport de bus dans un périmètre d'environ quarante kilomètres autour de Meknès. C'est une ville où la population est majoritairement jeune ce qui fait que la création artistique – notamment la musique – y a une place importante. La langue la plus courante est le Darija marocain. Les secteurs du tourisme, de l'artisanat et du commerce sont le noyau de l'économie locale et connaissent depuis quelques années un véritable essor ; la rénovation des différents sites touristiques de la médina de Meknès y est pour beaucoup.\n\nMonuments et centres d'intérêt\nMeknès est l'une des villes les plus riches de monuments historiques mais fut l'une des plus économiquement pauvres villes au Maroc\nLe patrimoine historique de Meknès a été reconnu comme tel depuis le début du XXe siècle et fait partie des monuments, sites et zones classés \"patrimoine national\" au Maroc. Au XVIIe siècle, le sultan alaouite Moulay Ismaïl décide de faire de Meknès l’une des plus belles et des plus puissantes cités impériales du Maroc. Aujourd’hui encore, protégée par une quarantaine de kilomètres de murailles, elle a conservé d’imposants monuments, dont de nombreuses mosquées qui lui valent le surnom de « ville aux cent minarets »[réf. nécessaire]. Parmi elles, la Grande Mosquée, probablement fondée au XIIe siècle, est remarquable par ses portes aux beaux auvents sculptés. Sa médina et les vestiges du palais royal ont valu à Meknès d’être classée au Patrimoine mondial de l’Unesco.\n\nMonuments historiques\nMausolée Moulay Ismaïl : édifié par Ahmed Eddahbi, ouvert aux non musulmans.

      "content": "## Overview\nMeknes (مكناس) is a city in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco. Meknes is a vibrant, modern city bustling with nightlife, restaurants and an impressive imperial city created in the 17th century by King Moulay Ismaïl, with numerous historical monuments and natural sites; it is also the nearest city to the Roman ruins of Volubilis (Oualili).\n\n## Understand\nIs Fez driving you nuts? Nearby Meknes is relatively ignored by most tourists. It's also free of the usual hassles (touts, faux guides, etc.) that plague the other tourist centers. The prices in Meknes are among the most reasonable.\n\n## By train\nMeknes is on the Fès-Rabat railway line and has two train stations. The smaller one called 33.8996-5.54561 Gare de Meknès-Amir Abdelkader is more centrally located in the new town (ville nouvelle) and closer to the medina, while the bigger 33.8966-5.53192 Gare Meknès-Ville is a bit further east.\nMeknes is connected by train to most major cities like Marrakech (6½ hr, 174 dirham), Tangier (3½ on trips involving a transfer at Kenitra or 4½ hr for the direct trips, 85 dirham), Rabat (2¼ hr, 69 dirham), Casablanca (3¼ hr), Fes (40 min, 20 dirham) or Oujda (6 hr, 130 dirham). Specific times and prices can be found on the website of the Moroccan National Office for Railways[dead link].\n\n## By bus\nWhile the bus is slightly cheaper, buses are quite difficult to navigate, because they are, in the majority of cases, very crowded and operate to transport people between agglomerations and the ville nouvelle and Medina.\n\n## By grand taxi\nGrand taxi arrive and leave from several places, the most popular being El-Amir Abdelkader train station. Opposite the road of the Institute Français is also a quite large taxi rank.\n33.89921-5.553515 Grand taxi stand to Volubilis.    .\n\n## By car\nMeknès is on Autoroute 2 (Rabat-Fès), which continues further east on N6 to Oujda.\nRoad N13 goes over the mountain range to Tetouan and Tangier or Ceuta to the north, in the northbound direction it goes to Azrou and At-Rachida.\n\n## Get around\nHamrya is a new town with all entertainment facilities. You can find all what you need there, but there is no monuments or things to see except if you like to chat with people. Medina is the other side is the ancient Meknes and it contains all the monuments of this wonderful city.\n\n## By taxi\nPetit taxis (small blue cars of Fiat Uno or Peugeot 205 brands) abound, as well as an efficient and comprehensive, if cramped local bus service. The minimum cost for a petit taxi is 5 dirham (the price is calculated based on 1.40 dirham + 0.20 dirham/100 m but you should expect a surcharge of 50% after 20:00).\n\n## On foot\nThe ville nouvelle (new town), which is known as Hamrya in Arabic, is easily navigated on foot, as is the medina. The two sides of town are connected by a bridge over the dry Oued Boufekrane (river), with a McDonald's placed in between for weary (or wary!) travelers.\n\n## See\n33.892611-5.5646391 Bab Mansour. Bab means \"gate\" or \"door\" in Arabic, and Bab Mansour is the largest and most striking of Meknes' many gates (27 gates). It's directly across from Lahdim Square, the medina's main square. The gate is nowadays used for art exhibitions.The gate is closed for reconstruction, which is supposed to be finished in 2023, but still ongoing (January 2025).   (updated Feb 2018)\n33.893189-5.5655122 Lahdim Square. Redone with new brickwork, this square once rivaled Djemaa el Fna in Marrakech but is now significantly less exciting (though there are a few nice cafés and snack spots in which to people-watch). The square is closed for reconstruction! (June 2024).    (updated Feb 2018)\n33.880535-5.5574933 Heri es-Souani. You can catch a glimpse of the grandeur of Moulay Ismail at these enormous granaries and horse stables, and sit beside the large Agdal Basin. 70 dirham.\n33.8884-5.56034 Meknes Royal Golf Course. The former palace gardens, now converted into a golf course. This place is absolutely marvelous. The gardens are beautifully kept and it is entirely surrounded by palace walls. It is open to the public. There is also a public café on the grounds. It's possible to eat on the terrace overlooking the course but you need to book in advance.\n33.895194-5.5652785 Medersa Bou Inania. A beautiful Qur'anic school; you can explore all floors including the roof. 60 dirham.   (updated Feb 2018)\n33.890821-5.5633156 Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail. Daily 09:00–18:30, except for Friday when it turns into a mosque. The mausoleum is on the southwest side of the former Dar al-Kebira Palace, between the inner and outer perimeter walls of the palace. The complex was first built in 1703 under Moulay Isma'il and then later expanded multiple times. The original complex was less extensive than it is today and it likely included only the tomb chamber, the adjoining rooms on either side of it, and the main courtyard leading up to it. Free admission.   (updated Jan 2023)\n33.891129-5.5646247 Prison Kara (Habs Qara). A huge underground prison where Moulay Ismail allegedly kept prisoners. A little pricey for basically just some empty halls underground. 60 dirham.   (updated Apr 2019)\n33.868487-5.5593418 Palais Al-Mansour. Half-destroyed palace built in 17th century to be king's summer residence.    (updated Feb 2018)\n33.88165-5.560139 Agdal Basin (Bassin Souani). Basin built at the time of Ismail Moulay in the imperial city, northwest of the granaries.    (updated Feb 2018)\n33.8989-5.570510 Mausoleum of Sidi ben Aïssa. Closed to non-Muslims.    (updated Feb 2018)\nAl masjid AlAdam. Meknes' largest and oldest standing mosque (note: Non-Muslims are not permitted to enter).\n\n## Museums\n33.893767-5.56655711 Dar Jamai Museum. W-M 10:00–17:30. This old palace, now a museum, is at the back of Place Hedim. It now houses the Museum of Moroccan Arts, which is exhibits artifacts, jewels, and old copies of the Qur'an. Dar Jamai is a gorgeous museum with exqusite gardens on the outside. Closed for renovation as of Feb 2018. 10 dirham.   (updated Feb 2018)\n33.8939-5.562612 Meknes Museum (100 m away from Bab Mansour). Small museum in an old mansion. 10 dirham.    (updated Feb 2018)\n33.887501-5.56756313 Borj Belkari Museum. Borj Belkari is a Alaouite bastion built in the 17th century as a part of the famous Ismaili wall created by Sultan Moulay Ismail (1672-1727), it played an important role in the defensive system of the city. It houses museum of Rif and Pre-Rif pottery. Under construction since 2018..   (updated Jan 2023)\n\n## Do\nPublic swimming pool. There is a very popular public swimming pool between the medina and the new city, on a hot day it is a godsend. (updated Jul 2017)\n\n## Buy\nMeknes is not a shopper's paradise, but it is certainly cheaper than nearby Fez. The medina is chock full of traditional Moroccan clothing and rugs, as well as the popular Moroccan shoe, bilgha.. It is also known for its metallic articles; the local artisanal speciality. The best way to enter the medina is at the back of Place Hedim, next to Dar Jamai. Herein you can find many shops catering to tourists. If you sojourn a bit deeper into the medina, you'll find plenty of unique shops selling jewellery, household goods and other treasures.\nBe sure to bargain! Don't accept the shopkeeper's first offer: not only does it ruin it for tourists who come after you, but it also goes against Moroccan custom. The easiest way to bargain, particularly without knowledge of French or Arabic, is to offer half of the given price (or 75% for expensive or large-scale items). From there, the shopkeeper will go down a bit; you are expected to raise your price slowly until you come to an agreement.\nIf you can't agree on a price, try walking out of the shop as this will generally lower the price significantly. And try not to be too stingy: the value of an item is your appreciation of it, not its price.\n\n## Eat\nThe market near the main place in the medina (at the Bab El-Mansur) has incredible fresh products. Lots of different kinds of olives, sweets, pickles, etc.\nIn Ville Nouvelle there are dozens of restaurants and snack bars lining the main road, Rue Antsirape offering the staples of harira, tagine, cous cous and of course rotisserie chicken. A few restaurants on Rue Ghana, just off Rue Antsirabi, are popular with travellers and offer 40-dirham set menus.\n\n## Budget\nMost budget hotels are along Rue Rouamzine, just before the medina. Hotel Maroc and Hotel Regina are two such choices. Hotel Regina is very dirty and stinky, but very cheap.\n33.9034-5.557511 HI-affiliated youth hostel, Boulvard Okba Ben Nafii (near Hotel Transatlantique), ☏ +212-535-401020. Wedged between the medina and ville nouvelle, just two doors down from the much swankier and well known Hotel Transatlantique. In the new city, it is 1½ km from the closest medina gate; in fact it's not really near anything and you lose whatever you save staying here on a taxi (8 dirham) coming or going. For the same price, Hostel Maroc is better. They do let anyone use the shower for 7 dirham though. Dorms from 70 dirham for HI members (+20 if you aren't, and they don't honour E-memberships), 160 dirham for a double room w/ shared bathroom.    (updated Feb 2018)\n33.89895-5.546092 Hotel Majestic, 19 Avenue Mohammed V, ☏ +212 035522035, fax: +212 035527427.

(updated Mar 2017)\n\n## Drink\nThose looking to find a watering hole in Meknes have come to the right place, in Morocco, anyway. For some reason, Meknes seems to have more bars than people. Only a few are suitable for the average traveler, however.\nLe Pub, Avenue Allal Ben Abdellah. Daily until midnight.
