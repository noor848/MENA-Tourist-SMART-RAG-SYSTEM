      "content": "El Jadida (Arabic: الجديدة, romanized: al-Jadīda, [alʒadiːda]) is a major port city on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, located 96 kilometres (60 mi) south of the city of Casablanca, in the province of El Jadida and the region of Casablanca-Settat. It has a population of 170,956 as of 2023.\nThe fortified city, built by the Portuguese at the beginning of the 16th century and named Mazagan (Mazagão in Portuguese), was given up by the Portuguese in 1769 and incorporated into Morocco. El Jadida's old city sea walls are one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. The Portuguese Fortified City of Mazagan was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, on the basis of its status as an \"outstanding example of the interchange of influences between European and Moroccan cultures\" and as an \"early example of the realisation of the Renaissance ideals integrated with Portuguese construction technology\". According to UNESCO, the most important buildings from the Portuguese period are the cistern and the Church of the Assumption, both in a Manueline style.\nThe city is a popular resort and destination for both Moroccan and international tourists. An important industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, lies 20 kilometres to the south.\n\nNames\nEl Jadida's other names and nicknames in other languages were: Cap Soleis, Portus Rutilis, Rusibis, Mazighen (Arabic: مازيغن), al-Breyja (Arabic: البريجة), Mazagão, al-Mahdouma (Arabic: المهدومة) and Mazagan. The city was renamed al-Jadida in 1820, meaning 'The New'.\n\nHistory\nEl Jadida traces its origins to the 5th century BC, when it was founded and settled by the Phoenicians.\nPrior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, an anchorage used by boats appears to have existed at the current site of El Jadida throughout the Middle Ages and in ancient times. The name Mazighan was first documented by the 11th-century Arab geographer al-Bakri. In 1502 a Portuguese captain, Jorge de Mello, landed at this location, allegedly driven here by a storm. He and his crew took refuge in an abandoned tower, called al-Briya or al-Burayja, to defend themselves against any potential attack by the locals. After returning to Portugal, he obtained permission from the Portuguese king, Dom Manuel, to found a fortress here in 1505, but evidence indicates that he did not carry this out, as when the Portuguese army passed here on their way to conquer Azemmour in 1513 they found nothing but the old tower.\nAs Azemmour was difficult to access, the Portuguese returned and built a citadel at the more accessible Mazighan in the summer of 1514. This citadel was a rectangular building with four towers, one of which was the old tower that already stood here. The architects were two brothers, Diogo and Francisco de Arruda. The location then became known in the Portuguese language as Mazagão. During the next few decades the Sa'dids rose to power and began expelling the Portuguese from their coastal fortresses, with the most significant event being their expulsion from Santa Cruz (present-day Agadir) in 1541. In response, King João III of Portugal ordered the evacuation of Portuguese positions at Azemmour and Safi and concentrated on building a more defensible position at Mazagão instead. As a result, the Portuguese fortification was expanded into the larger walled fortress we see today in 1541.\nThe Kingdom of Portugal would continue to control the city until 1769, when they abandoned Mazagão, their last territory in Morocco. Upon their forced departure, the Portuguese destroyed the Governor's Bastion. Most of the Portuguese inhabitants were sent to the colony of Brazil, where they founded a new settlement called Nova Mazagão (the present Mazagão in the state of Amapá). The city was then taken over by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah in 1769 and remained largely uninhabited, having been dubbed al-Mahdouma ('The Ruined'). Eventually, Sultan Abd al-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) ordered that a mosque be built, and the destroyed portions of the city were rebuilt during his reign in the early nineteenth-century. In 1820 the city was renamed al-Jadida, meaning 'The New'. The town underwent a revival and soon outgrew Azemmour as the most important city in the area. Alongside the Muslim population was also a community of Jews, who participated in the city's revival.\nAt the beginning of the French Protectorate in Morocco (established in 1912), the city was developed as a tourist resort, one of the earliest initiatives to develop modern tourism in Morocco. By the 1930s it had a casino which was popular with European tourists and colonists. The importance of the city's port, however, declined as Casablanca grew into the major port and urban center of the country during this period. In the 1980s a large industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, was developed some 20 kilometres to the south. Aided by its UNESCO World Heritage Site designation since 2004, the city continues to be a tourist destination today.\nDuring the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco, the historic Portuguese church in the old city was damaged. As of 13 September, cracks were observed in the church's tower and there was a risk of structural collapse.\n\nLandmarks\nFortress of Mazagan\nThe design of the Fortress of Mazagan is a response to the development of modern artillery in the Renaissance. The star form of the fortress measures c 250m by 300m. The slightly inclined, massive walls are c 8m high on average, with a thickness of 10m, enclosing a patrolling peripheral walkway 2m wide. At the present time the fortification has four bastions: the Angel Bastion in the east, St Sebastian in the north, St Antoine in the west, and the Holy Ghost Bastion in the south. The fifth, the Governor's Bastion at the main entrance, is in ruins, having been destroyed by the Portuguese in 1769. Numerous colonial-era Portuguese cannons are still positioned on top of the bastions.\nThe fort had three gates: the Seagate, forming a small port with the north-east rampart, the Bull Gate in the north-west rampart, and the main entrance with a double arch in the centre of the south rampart, originally connected to land via a drawbridge. A ditch, c 20m wide and 3m deep, formerly filled with seawater, surrounded the fort. During the time of the French Protectorate the ditch was filled in with earth and a new entrance gate was opened leading to the main street, the Rua da Carreira, and to the Seagate. Along this street are situated the best preserved historic buildings, including the Catholic Church of the Assumption and the Portuguese cistern.\n\nThe Citadel\nThe Citadel, located at the heart of the walled city, was the first permanent Portuguese construction on this site in 1514. It is a building with a rectangular floor plan measuring about 47 by 56 metres (154 by 184 ft), with three major rooms around a central space and four towers (one at each corner). The southern El-Briya Tower (originally known as al-Burayja) was of local, pre-Portuguese origin and it was here that the Portuguese first took refuge when they arrived in 1502. One of the northern towers was later re-purposed as the base of a 19th-century minaret built for the nearby mosque. The cistern is located beneath the Citadel.\n\nPortuguese cistern\nThe semi-subterranean chamber has a roughly square plan measuring around 33 to 34 metres (108 to 112 ft) per side, was constructed with five rows of five stone pillars and columns. The chamber is built in a late Gothic style known as Manueline, with a vaulted ceiling of brick masonry and stone ribs. Its original function is not clear. It may have been an armory, barracks, or granary, but it is recorded as having been converted into a cistern in 1541. It was designed by an architect named Miguel de Arruda but the construction work was delegated to João de Castilho. A round opening in the center of the chamber served to collect rainwater. The cistern is famous especially for the thin layer of water that covers the floor and creates fine and ever-changing reflections in the otherwise dark vaulted chamber. Its visual qualities are such that several movies have been filmed within the cavernous space, of which Orson Welles' Othello is the best known internationally.\n\nChurches\nThe Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, a prominent building located south of the Citadel, was the main parish church of the Portuguese settlement. It was constructed or begun when the fortress was expanded in 1541. It has a nave, a choir, a sacristy, and a square-shafted bell tower. At least three other churches existed, though generally only partial remains of them are still present today. Two small churches were adjoined to some of the bastions of the fortress. Another, the Church of Mercy (Misericórdia) was part of the Citadel.\n\nSynagogues\nA number of synagogues also existed inside the old city, attesting to the importance of the Jewish community here in the 19th and 20th centuries. One prominently visible example is the Bensimon Synagogue, inaugurated in 1926 and attached to earlier structures in the northern corner of the former fortress. Its construction was sponsored by four brothers of the Bensimon family: Nessim, Messaoud, Abraham, and Mordechai.\n\nMuseum of Resistance and Independence\nLocated near the beach south of the old city and the port, this museum and exhibition space is dedicated to the memory of Moroccan soldiers and resistance to the French Protectorate regime. It is housed in a 20th-century colonial era building constructed in a \"Mauresque\" style.\n\nClimate\nEl Jadida has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in El Jadida is 17.4 °C (63.3 °F). About 372 mm (14.65 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nEconomy\nThe city is a significant tourism destination thanks in part to its UNESCO-recognized historic heritage. A large five-star resort, the Mazagan Beach Resort, was opened in 2009 besides the nearby town of Azemmour, named in reference to the historic Portuguese fort. The resort was part of a wider strategy launched in 2001 by King Mohammed VI to boost tourism in Morocco by creating, with the help of foreign investors, large coastal resorts in El Jadida, Essaouira, Saïdia, and other cities on the Moroccan coast. The city is also a popular summer holiday resort for Moroccan families.\nSince the 1980s the city's economy has benefited from the large industrial complex at Jorf Lasfar, located some 20 kilometres to the south. The complex, managed by the Office Chérifien du Phosphore, is the main processing center for the region's phosphate reserves and its port is used for exporting its related products. It also serves as a base for other industries.\n\nEducation\nThe city houses many post-secondary academic institutions:\nChouaib Doukkali University, including the following institutions:\n\nFaculty of Science\nFaculty of Letters and Humanities\nFaculty of Juridical, Economic and Social Sciences\nNational School of Applied Sciences (ENSA)\nNational School of Business and Management (ENCG)\nSuperior School of Technology (EST) - Sidi Bennour (Outside El Jadida)\nOffice of Vocational Training and Promotion of Labor (OFPPT), including the following institutions:\n\nProfessional Qualification Center (CQP)\nSpecialized Institute of Applied Technology (ISTA) - Al-Massira\nSpecialized Institute of Applied Technology (ISTA) - City-of-the-Air\nSpecialized Institute of Hotel and Tourism Technology (ITHT) - El jadida\nSpecialized Institute of Hotel and Tourism Technology (ITHT) - Al Haouzia\nOthers:\n\nRegional Centers for the Professions of Education and Training (CRMEF)\nSection of \"Higher Technician Certificate\" (BTS) (at ar-Razi Technical High-School)\nSection of \"Preparatory Classes for Great Schools\" (CPGE) (at ar-Razi Technical High-School)\nHigher Institute of Engineering and Business (ISGA) (private)\n\nSports\nThe main football club of the city is Difaâ Hassani El Jadidi, currently playing in the Botola Pro 1.\n\nNearby cities\nNear El Jadida, are located the city of Azemmour in the northeast and the town of Sidi Bouzid in the southwest. Within a perimeter of around 120 km or less, are located Casablanca, Berrechid, Settat, Sidi Bennour, Oualidia, Youssoufia, Safi.\n\nNotable people\nJaafar Aksikas, author\nDriss Chraïbi, author\nAndré Elbaz, painter and filmmaker\nAndré Guelfi, racing driver\nZakaria Hadraf, footballer\nDriss Jettou, former prime minister, president of the Supreme Audit Court\nYoussef Kaddioui, former international footballer\nEl Mehdi Karnass, footballer\nAbdelkebir Khatibi, author\nAbdellah Lahoua, footballer\nYousra Mansour, vocalist of Bab L' Bluz\nMohamed Nahiri, footballer\nChaïbia Talal, painter\nSuleiman Zanfari, racing driver\nNicola L, multidisciplinary artist\nNaji El-Mekki, pentathlete\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nEl Jadida is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nTourism in Morocco\nSultan Mohammed ben Abdallah\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n((in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish)) Official Morocco website",

Cette ville est l'un des premiers établissements sur la route vers l'Inde des explorateurs portugais, elle offre un témoignage exceptionnel des influences croisées entre les cultures européenne et marocaine.\nLe 30 juin 2004, lors de la 28e session du comité du patrimoine mondial, tenue à Suzhou en Chine, la ville marocaine de Mazagan (El Jadida) est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe site peut correspondre à l'une des sept colonies instaurées par l'amiral Hannon au milieu du Ve siècle av. J.-C. appelée le comptoir de « Rusbis ». Ce site a été signalé aussi bien par le navigateur Polybe en 150 av. J.-C., et le géographe Ptolémée, que par Pline l'Ancien, sous le nom de « Portus rutilis ».\nAu début du XVIe siècle, les Portugais ont trouvé une petite tour en ruines abandonnée, utilisée auparavant comme poste de garde appelé « El Brija » diminutif de « borj ». Lors de la construction de la première citadelle, les Portugais l'ont appelée « Castello real ». Avec la reconstruction de la forteresse, la cité a pris provisoirement le nom de Sào Jorge\nAndré Privé suppose que le mot est d'origine portugaise, et le géographe al Idrissi, dès le XIe siècle, écrivit le nom de la ville en écriture arabe sous le nom de Mazighan, certains supposent que cela signifiait « meules ». Cependant la version la plus plausible est celle de l'origine berbère. En effet, « Mazagan » veut dire en berbère « celle aux crinières », le mot « azagen » est le pluriel de « azag », qui veut dire crinière.\nAprès sa destruction, la ville a été appelée Al Mahdouma, c'est-à-dire, « la démolie », une fois construite, le nom d'el Jadida (« la nouvelle » ou « la neuve ») lui a été attribué\n\nHistoire\nLe site de Mazagan ou Mazagão, considéré comme une ville portugaise en terre marocaine, a été placé sous couronne portugaise dès 1486. Toutefois les Portugais ne s'y installent qu'à partir de 1502 en construisant une tour et quelques installations temporaires, et ce n'est qu'à partir de l'été de l'année 1514 que ces derniers décidèrent de construire par les frères Francisco et Diégo de Arruda une citadelle de forme carrée avec des tours dans chaque coin, l'une des tours est construite à l'emplacement de d'al-Buraidja .\nEn 1541, à la suite de la prise du fort de Santa-Cruz de Cap de Gué (Agadir), Jean III décida d'évacuer Safi et Azemmour pour se retrancher à Mazagan considérée comme la mieux protégée. La citadelle a été agrandie par la construction de fortifications. La conception fut confiée à un groupe d'ingénieurs et architectes, composé du Portugais Joao Ribeiro, de l'Espagnol Juan Castillo et de l'Italien Benedetto di Ravenna, c'est à cette époque que les murailles de la ville ont pris leur emplacement actuel.\nEn 1769, l'occupation de Mazagan - la dernière des forteresses portugaises au Maroc - prend fin à la suite du traité de paix signé avec le sultan Mohammed III du Maroc (1757- 1790), les Portugais quittèrent la ville par la porte de la mer le 10 mars 1769 ; ils minèrent l'entrée principale du fort qui explosa lorsque les Marocains forcèrent l'entrée ce qui provoqua la destruction du bastion du Gouverneur et d'une grande partie du rempart. La ville resta inhabitée pendant près d'un demi-siècle et fut appelée al-Mahdouma (la ruinée). \nEn 1824, le sultan Abderrahman ordonna au pacha de la région de Doukkala et Tamesna, Sidi Mohamed Ben Tayeb, de restaurer l'ancienne ville portugaise en relevant les fortifications détruites et en construisant une mosquée.\n\nLa citerne\nCette vaste salle souterraine voûtée faisait partie du château fort construit en 1514 par les Portugais. Elle servit probablement de salle d'armes avant d'être utilisée comme réserve d'eau. Sur un plan carré de 34 m de côté, elle comporte six nefs dont les voûtes arêtes reposent sur 25 colonnes et piliers. La travée centrale est percée d'un large oculus par où se déverse la lumière du jour qui produit par réflexion sur l'eau de la citerne, un surprenant effet de miroir imprégnant le lieu d'une étrange atmosphère. La majestueuse citerne portugaise d'El Jadida séduisit Orson Welles au point qu'il y tourna certaines séquences de son film Othello. Quelques scènes des films Le Retour de l'étalon noir, produit par Francis Ford Coppola et Harem, d'Arthur Joffé, ont également été tournées ici.\n\nLa forteresse portugaise\nLa conception de la forteresse de Mazagan est à l'image du développement de l'artillerie moderne pendant la période de la Renaissance. Elle est construite en forme d'étoile, avec des murs de 250 à 300 mètres de côté. Légèrement inclinés, les murs massifs sont en moyenne de 8 mètres de haut, avec une épaisseur de 10 mètres, comportant un chemin de ronde de 2 mètres de largeur. Ces fortifications possèdent quatre bastions : le Bastion de l'Ange à l'est,  le Bastion Saint-Sébastien au nord, le Bastion Saint-Antoine, à l'ouest, et le Bastion du Saint-Esprit au sud. Le cinquième, le Bastion du Gouverneur, à l'entrée principale, est en ruines, après avoir été détruit par les Portugais en 1769. De nombreux canons de l'époque coloniale portugaise sont encore positionnés sur le dessus des bastions.\nLe fort possédait trois portes: la Seagate ou porte de la mer, formant un petit port avec le rempart nord-est, la porte de Bull dans le rempart nord-ouest, et l'entrée principale d'un double arc dans le centre du rempart sud, à l'origine reliés à la terre par l'intermédiaire d'un pont-levis. Un fossé, de 20 mètres de large et 3 mètres de profondeur, rempli d'eau de mer, entourait le fort. Pendant le Protectorat français, le fossé a été comblé avec de la terre et une nouvelle entrée a été ouverte conduisant à la rue principale, la Rua da Carrera, et la Seagate. Le long de cette rue se trouvent les bâtiments historiques les mieux conservés, y compris l'église catholique de l'Assomption et la citerne.\n\nL’église de l’Assomption\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nNicola L.\n\nBibliographie\nLaurent Vidal, Mazagão, la ville qui traversa l'Atlantique : Du Maroc à l'Amazonie, 1769-1783, Paris, Flammarion, coll. « Champs Histoire » (no 770), 2008, 2e éd.
