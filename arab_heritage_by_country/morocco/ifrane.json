      "content": "Ifrane (Arabic: إفران) is a city in the Middle Atlas region of northern Morocco (population 13٫964 as of September 2024). The capital of Ifrane Province in the region of Fès-Meknès, Ifrane is located at an elevation of 1,665 m (5,463 ft). In the regional Tamazight language, \"ifran\" means caves.\nThe modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1928 during the protectorate era for their administration due to its Alpine climate. Ifrane was conceived as a \"hill station\" or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans could find relief from the summer heat of the interior plains of Morocco. Ifrane, the house of Lake Dayet Iffer is also a popular altitude training destination.\nThe first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when the Sharif Sîdî 'Abd al-Salâm established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. Ifrane is a colonial \"hill station\", and a \"garden city\". It is also an \"imperial city\", a mountain resort, a provincial administrative center, and a college town.\n\nHistory\nThe first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when a sharîf by the name of Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. In the Local Amazigh language, Ifran means \"caves\". Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm’s village, called Zaouiat Sidi Abdeslam (or simply the zâwiyah), consisted at first of cave dwellings hollowed out of the limestone valley wall. Only in the last fifty years or so have its inhabitants built houses aboveground. The caves which now lie under these houses are still used as mangers for animals and for storage.\nBy the mid-17th century Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm’s zâwiyah was well enough established to\nreceive an extensive iqtâ’, or land grant, from the ‘Alâwî sultan Mûlây Rashîd b. Muhammad.\nThe iqtâ’ extended from upstream of present Ifrane down the Tizguit valley all the way to El Hajeb escarpment. Late in the 19th century agro-pastoral groups of the Amazigh Senhadja Beni M’guild and Zenata the Ait Seghrouchen, crossing the Middle Atlas from the upper Moulouya Plain, started grazing their herds of sheep and goats on the surrounding plateau. The livelihood of the zâwiyah was based on irrigated agriculture on the valley floor, livestock grazing and forest resources.\nThe agricultural plots were held as private property (mulk) but the grazing land was under collective tribal jurisdiction (j’maa). The tribally organized populations of the Ifrane-Azrou area submitted to colonial rule after a period of resistance (1913–1917). Resistance continued higher in the mountains (Timahdit, Jebel Fazzaz) until 1922.\n\nModern history\nThe modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1929 on land expropriated from the inhabitants of the zâwiya. The town was to be a \"hill station\", a cool place for colonial families to spend the hot summer months, and it was initially planned according to the \"garden city\" model of urban design then in vogue. The plan called for chalet-type summer homes in the Alpine style, laid out among gardens and curving tree-lined streets. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad V. The town's first public buildings consisted of a post office and a church. Moreover, a penitentiary was built which served as a POW camp during World War II.\nAs elsewhere in Morocco, a shanty town called Timdiqîn soon grew up next to the colonial establishment. It housed the Moroccan population (maids, gardeners, etc.) that serviced the French vacationers. Timdiqîn was separated from the colonial garden city by a deep ravine. After independence, the French properties in the original garden city were slowly bought up by Moroccans. The town was enlarged and endowed with a mosque, a municipal market and public housing estates. Furthermore, the shanty neighborhood of Timdiqîn was rebuilt with proper civic amenities.\nIn 1979 Ifrane became the seat of the administrative province of the same name and some government services were established. In 1995 Al Akhawayn University, an English-language, American-curriculum public university opened and this has helped re-launch Ifrane as a desirable destination for domestic tourism. Consequently, Ifrane continues to develop as both a summer and winter resort. Old chalets in the center of town are being demolished and replaced with condominium complexes, while vacation centers and gated housing estates are springing up on the outskirts.\nThe Middle Atlas Mountains consist mostly of a series of limestone plateaux. Not far from Ifrane in the Middle Atlas is Cèdre Gouraud Forest. These plateaux receive considerable precipitation—averaging about 1,100/1,200 ml/year in Ifrane—and are naturally wooded, with scrub oak forests alternating with cedar. The Middle Atlas lies in the center of Morocco and constitutes its natural water tower, as many of the country's most important river systems: the Moulouya, the Sebou, the Bou Regreg, and the Oum Rabia originate in it. Historically, however, despite its centrality, the Middle Atlas has been an \"empty quarter\". Though the area was regularly crossed by traders, and though the alpine summer pasture\nwas used by herders, the harsh climate and relatively poor soils long impeded permanent\nhuman settlement. Today the Middle Atlas is still one of the least densely populated parts\nof Morocco, even when compared to other mountainous regions such as the High Atlas and the Rif.\nA small fort overlooking Oued Tizguit (now part of the palace precinct) had already been built during the period of military conquest in order to secure the Fez to Khenifra road across the mountains. The gently rolling landscape, with fresh springs and wildflowers, was judged to have potential as a summer resort for colon families from the Saïss Plain, Meknes and Fez. Fifty hectares of agricultural land upstream from the zâwiyah, in an area originally designated as Tourthit, or \"garden\", was expropriated for the project.\nIfrane was conceived as a \"hill station\" or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans can find relief from the summer heat of tropical colonies. The British were the first to develop this type of resort in India, the best known of which is Simla in the Himalayas which served as their \"summer capital\". The French built similar hill stations in Indochina, such as Da Lat, established in 1921. Ifrane was not the only hill station to be built in Morocco. The French also built one in neighboring Imouzzer Marmoucha, as well as at Oukaïmeden in the High Atlas. Hill stations share some common characteristics. As they are intended for expatriate European families, and they are often designed in such a way as to remind their foreign inhabitants of their distant homelands. The architectural style adopted is imported from the mother country in order that the place look like \"Little England\" or \"douce France\". This is the case in Ifrane where various mountain styles such as \"maison basque\" \"Jura\" and \"Savoy\" were used. Moreover, trees and flowering plants were also imported from the European home country. This too was intended to heighten the appearance and feeling of home. In Ifrane, lilac trees, plane-trees (platanes), chestnut and horse-chestnut trees (marronniers and châtaigniers) and lime trees (tilleuls) were all imported for this purpose.\n\n\"Garden City\"\nIfrane was planned according to the \"garden city\" model of urban design, fashionable in Western Europe between the two world wars. The concept of the garden city was developed in Britain as a model of social reform to solve the problems of 19th century industrial cities. By the 1920s however it had lost its social purpose to become an urban design type. Garden cities required low density housing consisting of fully detached or semi-detached single family homes surrounded by gardens.\nIn order to break with industrial-era grid plans, garden cities were always laid out with curving tree-lined streets. In fact, most garden cities were affluent suburbs, not true cities in their own right. They catered to the tastes of the upper middle classes who could afford to own a private automobile and property in the suburbs. They gave the illusion of county life, with village-type architecture, curvy streets and many trees, to people who in reality worked in big cities. Ifrane's initial garden city plan was designed in 1928 in Rabat by the Services Techniques of the Bureau de Contrôle des Municipalités, a division of the Direction des Affairs Politiques.\nThe 1928 plan – for the neighborhood known as Hay Riad today – had typical garden city features: curvy streets named for flora (Rue des lilas, Rue des tilleuls, etc.), and chalet-style houses. Houses could occupy only 40% of plots; the rest had to be planted as a garden. Moreover, large parts of the center of the town consisted of public gardens. Some of the original architecture can still be seen, especially in the neighborhood around the town hall and the Perce Neige Hotel. The summer homes built by the colons were designed by many of the same architects who built the European parts of Casablanca and Rabat. Whereas the European architecture in these big cities was innovative and intentionally modern, Ifrane's houses were built in traditional European styles and resembled those in the suburbs of contemporaneous French cities.\nIfrane's first public buildings were a post office and a Roman Catholic church. The church, consecrated in 1939, was designed by Paul Tournon (1881–1964), a recipient of the prestigious Prix de Rome who had also designed the Sacré Cœur Church in Casablanca. The resort function of the new town was consolidated with the building of a number of hotels. Ifrane's first flagship hotel was the Balima, which was demolished in the 1980s. The other main hotel was the Grand Hôtel, which has recently been refurbished. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad b.Yûsuf.\nIfrane is thus an \"imperial\" city in that it houses a palace and benefits from royal patronage. One final institution of Ifrane's early years worthy of mention is the penitentiary which no longer exists, and the site, across from the Police Academy and the new police Commissariat, has been redeveloped as a summer camp for the Ministry of Justice. The penitentiary served as a Prisoner of War camp during World War II. The popular story of the origin of Ifrane's lion sculpture involves an Italian inmate of this prison sculpting the lion out of an outcrop of limestone; however, this is not true as the lion dates from at least 1936 thus predating World War II.\nThe garden city hill station high in the Middle Atlas was always going to be an illusion of suburban middle-class France. Provisions were made for the housing and infrastructure of colonial home-owners, but not for the Moroccan maids, gardeners or guards who worked for them. Finding no housing in the official allotments, these people had to build their own houses some distance away, across a ravine north of the town. As elsewhere in Morocco at the time, a shantytown thus grew up next to the colonial town. This is the origin of Timdiqin (officially called Hay Atlas).\n\nClimate\nLocated in the Atlas Mountains, and affected by the cold Canary current, Ifrane has a continental-influenced hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) with short, somewhat dry, warm summers and long, cool, damp winters. The nights can be severely cold in winter.\nBecause of its elevation, the town experiences snow during the winter months and a cooler climate during the summer (not as hot as in the nearby regions which lie at a lower altitude).\nOwing to the city's elevation and proximity to the north Atlantic Ocean, rainfall is very heavy whenever frontal systems affect the region. Precipitation patterns follow the classic Mediterranean range, from October to April. The city also receives high snowfall starting as early as October and lasting well into spring season. The annual average temperature does not exceed 11 °C (52 °F).\nIfrane holds the record for the lowest temperature ever observed in Africa and the Arab world: −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on February 11, 1935.\n\nFlora and fauna\nIfrane's biodiversity is unique. Its fauna and flora contain rare yet mostly endangered species. Animals to be found in the vicinity include the threatened Barbary macaque. Among the local tree species are the native Atlas cedar, scrub oak and the introduced London plane.\n\nFauna\nMammalian species\nThe Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), an endangered monkey species that lives in its wild state in the forests of the Middle Atlas, including the forests surrounding Ifrane. Barbary macaques can be seen in the outskirts or the farther areas of the town of Ifrane when there is no more food in the woods, or simply because they have become familiar with humans.\nThe golden jackal (Canis aureus), referred to as ‘ich’ab’ in Tamazight, the same term used for ‘wolf’\nThe caracal (Caracal caracal), which is hard to spot, and survives thanks to its extreme discretion.\nThe common genet (Genetta genetta)\n\nBird species\nThe Atlas Coal Tit (Parus ater Atlas), an endemic passerine bird native to the Atlas mountains range.\nThe African crimson-winged finch (Rhodopechys alienus)\nThe white scavenger vulture (Neophron percnopterus)\nIfrane is also well known for its pisciculture (fish farming) stations. Ras el Ma forest has a trout-breeding station in which trout can be seen in their breeding basins. Moreover, Ifrane has a varied range of insects and amphibians.\n\nFlora\nIfrane's plant and tree species include the following: \n\nThe Atlas cedar (Cedrus Atlantica)\nThe holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia)\nThe Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea)\nThe maritime pine (Pinus pinaster ssp. Hamiltoni var. maghrebiana)\nThe Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera)\nThe laurel-leaf cistus (Cistus laurifolius)\nGenista quadrifolia\nArtemisia mesatlantica\n\nNotable people\nMostafa Smaili, middle-distance runner.\nAdil Jelloul, road bicycle racer.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nInventaire de la Biodiversité.

      "content": "Ifrane (en amazighe : ⵉⴼⵔⴰⵏ, Ifran ; en arabe : إفران) est une ville et commune urbaine du Maroc située dans le Moyen-Atlas, à 1 650 mètres d'altitude. Elle est le chef-lieu de la province d'Ifrane, dans la région administrative de Fès-Meknès, et compte une population de 15 553 habitants.\nIfrane est surnommée la petite Suisse en raison de son climat et de ses paysages enneigés et montagneux rappelant le pays neutre.\n\nToponymie et étymologie\nEn amazighe, ⵉⴼⵔⴰⵏ ifran signifie cachettes ou grottes (pluriel de ⵉⴼⵔⵉ ifri). La région est en effet connue pour ses grottes naturelles creusées dans la couche carbonatée jurassique sous forme de karts, et qui s'étendent jusqu'aux régions d'El Hajeb et de Sefrou. Ce sont elles qui ont donné leur nom à la ville. Par méconnaissance, on a associé à Ifrane le nom d’Oufrane, alors que ce dernier désigne une ville située dans l'Anti-Atlas marocain. Historiquement, l'ancien nom d'Ifrane est Tourtite Turtit, qui en amazighe signifie figueraie [1]. Le développement d'Ifrane et de sa région doit beaucoup aux potentialités naturelles, notamment au cèdre.\n\nHistoire\nPréhistoire\nLa présence humaine dans la région remonte au Néolithique comme en témoignent des grottes telles que celles de Tizguite ainsi que des vestiges archéologiques remontant à la Préhistoire, il y a 50 000 ans, la découverte de campements Atérien (culture caractéristique du paléolithique du Maghreb) par le groupe de chercheurs de l'Institut des sciences de l'archéologie et du patrimoine (INSAP) à Michlifen près d'Azrou à Ain Leuh (grotte d'ifri Ouberid), Zerouka, Ghabt, Al Bahr et Itto et à El Hajeb et les vestiges trouvés (ossements, objets...).\n\nPériode contemporaine\nIfrane sera habitée plus tard par une population issue des deux grandes tribus amazighes parlant le tamazight du Maroc, les Aït M’guild, les Aït M’tir et une partie des Aït Seghrouchen, tribus nomades qui se déplacent entre les pâturages verdoyants de Timahdite et Azrou jusqu'aux confins du pays Zayanes.\nVu sa situation géographique en altitude orientée plein nord qui rend ses paysages comparables à ceux de l'Europe, la création d'Ifrane est l'œuvre du secrétaire général du protectorat au Maroc, Eirik Labonne, en 1928. Trois dates sont à retenir :\n\nCréation d’un centre d'estivage pour les colons français : arrêté viziriel du 16 septembre 1929.\nCréation de la municipalité : le 14 janvier 1947.\nCréation de la province.\nLe choix de la puissance coloniale s'inscrit dans trois cadres :\n\nExploitation des ressources naturelles ;\nCréation d’une « ville européenne » par compensation du dépaysement de la communauté française et européenne établie au Maroc, notamment en été (fraîcheur) : Maurice de Gandillac en est témoin ;\nDisposer d’une base stratégique : la garnison de Timahdite constitue un atout stratégique militaire qui sert de liaison entre Taza et Tadla dont le but de faciliter les interventions militaires et cerner les tribus amazighes hostiles à la présence coloniale notamment la tribu des Zayanes sous la conduite de Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, Mouha ou Said d'Elkssiba et d'autres foyers insurrectionnels dans le Moyen et le Haut Atlas réputés pour leur hostilité envers les Iroumines (les chrétiens) et leur qualité de guerriers nourrie par leur attachement à la terre, surtout après la défaite de la France le 13 novembre en 1914 à Khénifra dans la bataille d'Elhri.\nL'université Al Akhawayn d'Ifrane a été fondée par décret royal en 1993 et officiellement inaugurée par le roi Hassan II du Maroc le 16 janvier 1995. C'est actuellement la seule université marocaine suivant un système d'éducation américain et ayant plus de 40 % de personnel international[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nIfrane, ville du Moyen Atlas central, est caractérisée par son urbanisme européen. C'est le chef-lieu de la province d'Ifrane, dont la superficie est de 3 573 km² et qui est administrativement composée de deux municipalités (Ifrane et Azrou), cinq caïdats (Tizguit, Dait Aoua, Ain Leuh, Timahdit et Irklaouen) et huit communes rurales (Tizguite, Dait Aoua, Ain Leuh, Sidi El Mekhfi ou Sidi Addi, Timahdite, Ben Smim, Oued Ifrane et Tigrigra. Selon le nouveau découpage administratif, la province fait partie de la région de Fès-Meknès.\n\nClimat\nIfrane bénéficie d'un climat très humide et continental (Dsb) avec une pluviométrie annuelle de 1 118,4 mm et une température moyenne annuelle de 11,4 °C.\nLe versant nord des montagnes du Moyen-Atlas est en effet la région la plus arrosée du Maroc après la chaîne de montagnes du Rif. Les précipitations ont lieu essentiellement en hiver. Les montagnes du Moyen-Atlas se trouvent alors sur le trajet des perturbations en provenance de l'Atlantique.\nÀ 1 665 m d'altitude, l'été à Ifrane est court mais toutefois agréablement chaud, sec et ensoleillé. La température maximale moyenne passe de 22 °C en juin à plus de 28 °C en juillet et août avant de rapidement repasser sous les 25 °C en septembre. \nEn hiver, il neige beaucoup sur la ville. Ifrane détient officiellement le record de froid enregistré sur le continent africain avec une température de −23,9 °C le 11 février 1935.\n\nBiodiversité\nLa région d'Ifrane constitue une aire géographique riche par sa biodiversité faunique et floristique, mais ses S.I.B (Sites d'intérêt biologique et écologique) et son parc national subissent une forte pression due à la dégradation de la forêt, au surpâturage et aux visiteurs non avertis qualifiés de pollueurs potentiels. Située dans le Moyen Atlas au Maroc, Ifrane est reconnue pour sa biodiversité exceptionnelle, abritant une grande variété d’écosystèmes, allant des forêts de cèdres de l’Atlas (Cedrus atlantica) aux prairies subalpines. La région est un habitat clé pour des espèces emblématiques comme le macaque de Barbarie (Macaca sylvanus), une espèce menacée, et de nombreux oiseaux migrateurs. Les cours d'eau, tels que les rivières et lacs de la région, jouent un rôle crucial dans le maintien des écosystèmes aquatiques. En outre, le Parc National d'Ifrane, créé en 2004, est une aire protégée essentielle pour la conservation de la flore et de la faune locales. Les efforts pour préserver cette biodiversité incluent la gestion des ressources naturelles et des initiatives pour limiter l'impact des activités humaines, telles que l'éco-tourisme et la sensibilisation environnementale.\n\nParc national d'Ifrane\nLe Parc national d'Ifrane abrite notamment la plus grande forêt de cèdres du monde. Il englobe un ensemble de gîtes à caractère biodiversitaire (parc de Tizguite, Val d'Ifrane, les sources Vittel, Dait Aoua, Dait Hachlaf, Dait Ifrah et Afourgah).\n\nSites touristiques\nRas el Ma\nCentre-ville\nSource Vitel\nCascade refuge\nSource Bensamim\nAguelmame\nOued Tizguit\nL'arbre mort Arz Goro (cèdre Gouraud) : le plus ancien et grand cèdre de la région\nATLAS parc aventure : le seul parc accrobranche de la région\nAin Aghbale est une ferme piscicole privée à 4 km d'Azrou, faisant partie des Domaines agricoles.

      "content": "## Overview\nIfrane is a city in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco.\n\n## Understand\nIfrane is one of the most beautiful places in Morocco, residing on the Atlas mountain with a population of roughly 80,000 people. The projects of the current Moroccan king - like the university and huge new hotel - have had a large impact on the town.  It is not a large town with the majority of the population being farmers, sheepherders, etc, and living outside of the town borders.\nThe main language in Ifrane is Berber, but you can also hear a great deal of Arabic and French. It is home to Al-Akhawayn University, an American-style university taught in English, French, and Arabic. Nearly all university students will be able to converse fluently in English, but most of the native residents can not.\nThe climate is mostly cold with a beautiful mild summer, with a great deal of rain in the first few months of the year. The people are overall very friendly.\nOverall, there is very little reason to specifically visit Ifrane if you have limited time in Morocco. Unless you're a student here or a member of the king's entourage when he visits, there's not a huge amount to visit here- a carved lion, some parks, funky roofs, lots of storks, outdoorsy things, and a Sunday souq pretty much summarize the town.\n\n## Get in\nMost of the buses comes from Fez and Meknes, which are the two major neighboring cities, or pass through on their route from Marrakesh to Fez.\n\n## By grand taxi\nThe easiest way to get into Ifrane is by grand taxi from Fez or Meknes. Both cities are an hour away. Grand taxis in Fez leave near the Fez CTM station.\ngrand taxis. Grand taxis arrive in Ifrane at the grand taxi station, which is temporarily located about 300 m southwest of the marché.\nA ride to either town costs 25 dirham, but can be more expensive (30 dirham) on weekends, when half of Fez and Meknes come there.\nIf you find yourself to take a whole taxi yourself, multiply the price by six places (i.e. 150 dirham).\nAt some times (very late/early, during strikes), you may have to pay a good bit more.\n\n## By bus\nCTM has an office at the east end of the marché and buses are likely to stop / depart from there. CTM buses are known to being cleaner and slightly quicker, but the sometimes sketchy buses from other companies are equally safe. They most likely depart from the new Gare Routière which is somewhere southwest from the marché. These buses can be a lot dirtier and a little cheaper. Some might have more stops (longer trip), but they also leaving more often and are thus easier to catch.\n\n## Get around\nMost places are within walking distance, but petit taxis are also readily available. The minimum fare is 5 dirham for small distances (e.g. marché → centre ville), longer distances will be 10 dirham.\nGrand taxi drivers are a little more unscrupulous, so try to be aware of how much you should be paying for any given trip.\n\n## See\nAl Akhawayn University. Normally the campus is closed to non-students, but there are occasional events that allow visitors to see the campus. You can also request special permission from the faculty.\nCentre-ville. The newer part of the city. Here, you can find the center for tourism, the iconic Lion statue that many tourists like to take pictures next to, the lake and park, and a number of restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores. Note that due to a prolonged drought, as of 2024, the lake (as well as most other water sources in the area) has unfortunately been bone dry for several years.\nMarché. The marché or souq, open every day, is where the locals buy their supplies. Anything from books and electronics to meat and fruit can be bought here. There are also many restaurants of varying quality and price.\nSource Vitel. A series of waterfalls, some of which are found inside the forests of Ifrane, others which you should take a taxi to. None are particularly impressive, but all are pretty. As of 2024, however, most are completely dry due to the drought, although there is a bit of water still flowing further north away from the town.\nBarbary Macaques. A huge number of macaques live in the woods around the town, and if you're lucky, you can sometimes see them in the town itself. The southern edge of the town, near the marche, often has gangs of apes hanging around.\n\n## Do\nHowever, Ifrane's main attraction is its natural beauty. It is highly encouraged to hike in the area. You can easily rent a horse and guide for a few hours. It is also only a short distance from Ifrane to a place where you can find and feed wild monkeys.\n- Foret Cedre Gourant: A good starting point for many trekking/hiking routes. You can go there by car and park in a touristic area where you can take some photos of monkeys and old trees, or rent a guide for excursions.\n\n## Centre ville\nL'Apelle. More high class than most restaurants in Ifrane. The only place that serves pastilla in the vicinity.\nLa Paix. mains around 80 dirham.\nForest. A new shiny restaurant.\nVarious cafes. All of the cafes are priced roughly the same, and have roughly the same quality of food. Normally a safe bet, though you can expect only the standard fare: pizza, tagine, harira, brochettes, etc.\nMy Lil Rome. A very small restaurant that sells delicious hand-made pizzas that blow all other pizzas in the town out of the water. You may have to wait a while if the guy running the places has just run out of dough, but it's well worth the wait. 50-70d for a large pizza.\n\n## Marché\nA good recommendation for the marche would be to avoid most of the restaurants on the outside edge of the area, as well as most of the restaurants around the square in the middle. These places tend to sell overpriced, low quality food that is aimed at tourists. A lot of the food here is, quite frankly, quite bad, but there are a few places worth eating at.\nRestaurant Al-Akhawayn. Good food. More varied menu than many others. decent prices.\nRestaurant Chez Amal. Used to serve excellent Kafta-Tajine, but has lost a bit of its atmosphere since the renovation. mains 40 dirham.\nChez Said. The sandwiches were famous, but since it moved to a new location, they are not as good anymore. 20 dirham.\nChicken Restaurant. Serves good chicken. mains 25-40 dirham.\nFor You. Sells decent junk food type meals such as pizzas, tacos and loaded fries, as well as sushi. One of the better places in town, and very popular with students. Located about 3 minutes away from the marche by foot. Expect to pay anywhere from 35-65d, depending on what you order.\nPlatane. One of the better places in the marche. Popular with Al Akhawayn students and less aimed at tourists. 20-50d. (updated Feb 2024)\n\n## Drink\nThere are two centers of nightlife in Ifrane: Grand Hotel, and Aglemem.\nThe Grand Hotel has a dance club and offers expensively priced alcohol. The clubs are most popular on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, and play only House/Techno music.\nAglemem is a bar/restaurant that occasionally holds live music events.\nCafe le Chamonix also sells alcohol. It is probably the cheapest place in town, but still quite expensive.\n\n## Sleep\nThere is no budget accommodation in Ifrane. The best is probably to stay in Azrou (15 minutes by grand taxi, ~6 dirham).\nApartments can be rented from 100-150 dirham per day, although finding one with clean sheets seems to be impossible.\nSeveral midrange/splurge hotels are found in the city center:\nGrand Hotel.\nHotel Michliffen, ☏ +212 535 56 66 07. It is one of the most luxurious hotels in the area. There are two pools. From 2500 dirham.\n\n## Go next\nThe grand taxi (share taxi) station, which is connected to the bus station, has regular connections to Fes and Meknes, as well as to smaller towns in the area such as Al Hajeb, Azrou and Immouzer Kandar. None of the smaller towns have any mind-blowing attractions, but are worth a visit if you want to see something of the real Morocco away from the tourists. The taxi drivers all seem honest and do not seem to charge foreigners any more than Moroccans, and because of the university, many of the passengers are likely to be students who are able to speak English and are likely willing to help you navigate.\nThe bus station has regular coaches to major cities throughout Morocco, but because departure times to many cities are very irregular, it may be worth checking the bus times the day before you plan to leave.",
