Fes el Bali (Arabic: فاس البالي, romanized: Fās al-Bālī, lit. 'Old Fes') is the oldest part of Fez, Morocco. It is one of the three main districts of Fez, along with Fes Jdid and the French-created Ville Nouvelle ('New City'). Together with Fes Jdid, it forms the medina (historic quarter) of Fez, significant for the preservation of its pre-modern urban layout and numerous historic monuments, which have earned it UNESCO World Heritage Site status. 
Fes el Bali was founded as the capital of the Idrisid dynasty between 789 and 808 AD. It was originally composed of two separate towns on either side of the Fez River which subsequently merged under the Almoravids (11th–12th centuries). Even when Marrakesh replaced it as the political capital, it continued to thrive in subsequent centuries thanks to its economic and religious importance. In the 13th century, the Marinid dynasty built Fes Jdid as a new administrative capital next to Fes el Bali. 
Fes el Bali district still largely retains much of its historic fabric of market (suq) streets and narrow winding alleys, along with large sections of its historic city walls. At its heart is the historic al-Qarawiyyin University, centered around a mosque founded in the 9th century. Among the other major historic landmarks are the Chouara Tanneries and various mosques, madrasas, hammams, caravanserais and residences that constitute important examples of traditional Moroccan and Moorish architecture.
UNESCO listed Fes el Bali, along with Fes Jdid, as a World Heritage Site in 1981 under the name Medina of Fez. The World Heritage Site includes Fes el Bali's urban fabric and walls as well as a buffer zone outside of the walls that is intended to preserve the visual integrity of the location.

History
As the capital for his newly acquired empire, Idris ibn Abdallah chose to build a new town on the right bank of the Fez River in AD 789. Many of the first inhabitants were refugees fleeing from an uprising in Cordoba (modern-day Spain). However, in 809 his son, Idris II, decided to found a capital of his own on the opposite bank of the Fez River. Even though they were only separated by a relatively small river the cities developed separately and became two individual cities until they were unified in the 11th century by the Almoravids. There were many refugees who decided to settle in the new city this time too, however this time they fled from an uprising in Kairouan (in modern Tunisia). The University of Al-Karaouine (or al-Qarawiyyin) is recorded by traditional sources as having been founded by one of these refugees, Fatima al-Fihri, in 859. UNESCO and Guinness World Records consider it the oldest continuously operating university in the world. The Al-Andalusiyyin Mosque (or Mosque of the Andalusians), on the opposite shore of the river, is likewise traditionally believed to have been founded by her sister in the same year.

Under the Almoravids, Fez lost its status as a capital, which was moved to the newly created Marrakesh. During Almohad rule (12th-13th centuries), Fez was a thriving merchant city, even though it was not a capital. It even became the largest city in the world during that time, with approximately 200,000 people living there. 
After defeating the Almohads in Morocco, the Marinids moved the capital from Marrakesh back to Fez. This marked the beginning of the greatest period of the history for Fes. When the Marinids moved the capital to Fez in 1276 they started building a new town outside the old city walls. At first it was called Madinat al-Bayda ("the White City"), but it quickly became known as Fes el-Jdid ("New Fez"), while the old city became known as Fes el-Bali ("Old Fez"). The Marinids built the first true madrasas in Morocco, which include many of the city's most notable architectural monuments such as the Bou Inania Madrasa, the Al-Attarin Madrasa, and the Sahrij Madrasa.
The Saadian dynasty (16th and early 17th centuries), who used Marrakesh again as their capital, did not lavish much attention on Fez, with the exception of the ornate ablutions pavilions added to the Qarawiyyin Mosque's courtyard during their time. They built a number of new forts and bastions around the city which appear to have been aimed at keeping control over the local population. They were mostly located on higher ground overlooking Fes el-Bali, from which they would have been easily able to bombard the city with canons. These include the Kasbah Tamdert, just inside the city walls near Bab Ftouh, and the forts of Borj Nord (Borj al-Shamali) on the hills to the north, Borj Sud (Borj al-Janoub) on the hills to the south, and the Borj Sheikh Ahmed to the west, at a point in Fes el-Jdid's walls that was closest to Fes el-Bali. These were built in the late 16th century, mostly by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur.
It was only when the founder of the Alaouite dynasty, Moulay Rashid, took Fez in 1666 that the city saw a revival again, albeit briefly. He built the Kasbah Cherarda (also known as the Kasbah al-Khemis) to the northwest of Fes el-Jdid to house a large part of his tribal troops. He also restored or rebuilt what became known as the Kasbah an-Nouar, which became the living quarters of his followers from the Tafilalt region (the Alaouite dynasty's ancestral home). For this reason, the kasbah was also known as the Kasbah Filala ("Kasbah of the people from Tafilalt"). Moulay Isma'il, his successor, chose nearby Meknès as his capital instead, but he did restore or rebuild some major monuments in Fes el-Bali, such as the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II. While the succession conflicts between Moulay Isma'il's sons were another low point in the city's history, the city's fortunes rose more definitively after 1757 with the reign of Moulay Muhammad Ibn Abdallah and under his successors.

The last major change to Fez's topography before the 20th century was made during the reign of Moulay Hasan I (1873-1894), who finally connected Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali by building a walled corridor between them. Within this new corridor, between the two cities, were built new gardens and summer palaces used by the royals and the capital's high society, such as the Jnan Sbil Gardens and the Dar Batha palace.
In 1912 French colonial rule was instituted over Morocco following the Treaty of Fes. Fez ceased to be the center of power in Morocco as the capital was moved to Rabat, which remained the capital even after independence in 1956. Starting under French resident general Hubert Lyautey, one important policy with long-term consequences was the decision to largely forego redevelopment of existing historic walled cities in Morocco and to intentionally preserve them as sites of historic heritage, still known today as "medinas". Instead, the French administration built new modern cities (the Villes Nouvelles) just outside the old cities, where European settlers largely resided with modern Western-style amenities. The existence today of a Ville Nouvelle ("New City") alongside a historic medina of Fez was thus a consequence of this early colonial decision-making and had a wider impact on the entire city's development. While new colonial policies preserved historic monuments, it also had other consequences in the long-term by stalling urban development in these heritage areas. Wealthy and bourgeois Moroccans started moving into the more modern Ville Nouvelles during the interwar period. By contrast, the old city (medina) of Fez was increasingly settled by poorer rural migrants from the countryside.
Today Fes el-Bali and the larger historic medina is a major tourism destination due to its historical heritage. In recent years efforts have been underway to restore and rehabilitate its historic fabric, ranging from restorations of individual monuments to attempts to rehabilitate the Fez River.

Geography and layout
Urban structure
The city is located along both sides of the Fez River (also known as the Oued Bou Khrareb). Although parts of the wall and some of its historic gates have disappeared, Fes el-Bali is still mostly enclosed by a long and winding circuit of defensive walls. These were entered via a number of gates, the most important of which were Bab Mahrouk (though the nearby Bab Bou Jeloud is more famous today), Bab Guissa, and Bab Ftouh. At the western end of the city were two historic kasbahs (fortified enclosures) attached to the city: the Kasbah an-Nouar, which still exists today on the northern side of Place Bou Jeloud, and the Kasbah Bou Jeloud, whose walls have since disappeared but which stood directly southwest of the current Bab Bou Jeloud gate. The Kasbah Bou Jeloud was historically the governor's residence and the seat of government control. The Almohad-built Bou Jeloud Mosque still stands there today, one of the only remnants of the original enclosure. 
As in many medieval Islamic cities, the main souk streets of the city typically run from the city's main gates to the area of the city's main mosque: in this case, the Qarawiyyin and, to a lesser extent, the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Mosque of the Andalusians. These mosques, in turn, are located inside or near the city's main commercial and economic zones. The souk streets themselves constitute the main commercial axes of the city and are home to most of its funduqs (inns for merchants). As a result, merchants and foreign visitors rarely had need to wander outside these areas and most of the streets branching off them lead only to local residential lanes (often called derbs), many of them leading to dead-ends. Even today, tourists are generally found only on these main commercial thoroughfares. The city's most important monuments and institutions are also located on or near its main souk streets. Accordingly, the medina has a cohesive and hierarchical urban structure that can be distinguished on two levels. At a local level, individual neighbourhoods and districts are specialized for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. On a wider level, the city is organized in relation to major points of importance such as gates and main mosques. At this wider level, there are roughly four main centres of urban activity and organization: one around the Qarawiyin Mosque, one around the Mosque of the Andalusians, another around the Bou Inania Madrasa-Mosque, and the historically separate agglomeration of Fes el-Jdid.
Fes el-Bali is also notable for being a large car-free urban area (approximately 300 hectares), due to the well-preserved urban fabric of traditional narrow streets and alleys unsuitable for cars. Only one major road penetrates the medina from the south, following the course of the river, and reaching Place R'cif near the center of the city, which allows access for public transportation and emergency vehicles.

Districts and neighbourhoods
The city is broadly divided between two quarters, on opposite shores of the Fez River: the Qarawiyyin Quarter or 'Adwat al-Qarawiyyin (on the western shore) and the Andalusian Quarter or 'Adwat al-Andalus (on the eastern shore). These are further divided into smaller historic neighbourhoods or districts. In the early 20th century, French historian Roger Le Tourneau recorded that the city was divided administratively into the 18 neighbourhoods listed below. Le Tourneau noted that the Salwat el-Anfas, a 14th-century chronicle, lists a very similar division of neighbourhoods, even if the borders and names have changed slightly. The name 'Adwat on its own is also used in some sources to refer to the whole eastern shore of the city (the Andalusian Quarter).
Qarawiyyin Quarter:

at-Tala'a ("the Slope/Climb")
el-'Uyun ("the Sources")
el-Qalqliyin
Ras Jnan ("Beginning of the Gardens")
el-Gerniz ("the Thistle")
el-Kettanin ("the Textile Merchants")
Swikat Ben Safi ("the Small Souk of Ibn Safi")
esh-Shrabliyin ("the Slipper Merchants")
Zqaq er-Romman ("the Street of the Pomegranate")
Funduq el-Yihudi ("the Warehouse/Inn of the Jew")
el-Blida ("the Small City")
es-Sagha ("the Moneychangers")
Andalusian Quarter:

el-Mokhfiya ("the Hidden")
Sidi el-Awwad ("Sir Wheelwright") & el-Kowas ("the Vaults")
el-Keddan ("the Tuff")
el-Gzira ("the Island")
el-Fekharin ("the Potters")
Oued ez-Zitoun ("the River of the Olives")
Both the el-Fekharin and Oued ez-Zitoun areas, which occupy the entire eastern region of the Andalusian Quarter beyond the Andalusiyyin Mosque, were largely empty of major constructions prior to the 20th century, with the exception of a few religious structures and funduqs (merchant buildings). These districts only filled up with residential structures during the French Protectorate period in the 20th century. The al-'Uyun district, which covered a very large area in the southeastern region of the Qarawiyyin Quarter, was historically occupied by gardens and rich estates used by the city's wealthy and bourgeois classes. This is attested by the number of historic mansions still existing in this area such as the Dar Moqri and the Dar Glaoui. The name al-'Uyun, "the Sources", referred to the presence of many water streams and sources which crossed the district and provided water for its gardens.
The name Funduq el-Yihudi ("the Warehouse/Inn of the Jew") reflects the fact that, before the creation of the Mellah in Fes el-Jdid, the Jewish community had been concentrated in this neighbourhood since the time of Idris II (early 9th century). (Although Jews had also lived and worked in many other parts of the city during this period.) The city's original Jewish cemetery was also located near here, just outside the nearby gate of Bab Guissa.

Threats and conservation
According to the UNESCO there are two main threats to this World Heritage Site:

An ever-increasing population in an already dangerously overpopulated area and the uncontrolled urban development which is a result of that.
The deterioration of the buildings 
Because of the vulnerability of the site the government has adopted a special plan to care for this World Heritage Site and every building and monument it contains. The aim is to prevent houses from collapsing, increase sustainable tourism and to safeguard everything.
Since 1989 a quasi-governmental agency known as ADER-Fès (Association pour la dédensification et réhabilitation de Fès-Médina) has been charged with restoring much of the medina and safeguarding its heritage. In recent years efforts have been underway to restore more of the old medina, ranging from the restoration of dozens of individual monuments to attempts to rehabilitate the Fez River.
Place Lalla Yeddouna at the heart of the Medina has been recently undergoing reconstruction and preservation measures following a design competition sponsored by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (Washington D.C.) and the Government of the Morocco. The construction projects scheduled for completion in 2016 encompass historic preservation of particular buildings, construction of new buildings that fit into the existing urban fabric and regeneration of the riverfront. The intention is to not only preserve the quality and characteristics of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, but to encourage the development of the area as a sustainable, mixed-use area for artisanal industries and local residents.

Al Quaraouiyine (en arabe : جامعة القرويين, en  français : Université Al Quaraouiyine) est une université située à Fès, au Maroc. Selon la tradition, sa construction débute en 859 sous le règne de la dynastie idrisside. Elle est considérée comme la plus ancienne université au monde encore en activité par l'UNESCO, le Livre Guinness des records et plusieurs historiens, un statut contesté par certains notamment en raison de la définition inconstante de ce qu'est un enseignement universitaire.
Au XIIe siècle, toute une série de noms parmi les plus grands vont être associés d'une manière ou d'une autre à la Quaraouiyine : les grands précurseurs du soufisme, tels Ibn Harzihim (en), Abou Madyane, Abdeslam Ben Mchich Alami, les philosophes Avenpace et Averroès, le géographe Al Idrissi mais aussi Maïmonide, Ibn Khaldoun et Léon l'Africain pour ne citer qu'eux.[réf. nécessaire]
Elle est classée 95e dans le classement régional 2016 des universités arabes (U.S.News & World Report).

Histoire et fondation
La fondation de la Quaraouiyine
La tradition estime l'établissement de la mosquée vers 859 et attribue sa fondation à Fatima el Fihriya, fille d'un riche homme d'affaires immigré de Kairouan (actuelle Tunisie) et  membre de la famille des Fihrides.  
Dans l'histoire racontée par Ibn Abi Zar, Muhammad ibn Abdallâh al-Fihri, riche commerçant de Kairouan (dans l'actuelle Tunisie), s’installa avec sa famille à Fès. À sa mort, ses deux filles Fatima et Maryam recueillirent un important héritage qu’elles décidèrent de consacrer à des œuvres de bienfaisance. Dans le quartier des Andalous, Maryam construisit la mosquée des Andalous. Sa sœur Fatima acheta un jardin maraîcher et obtient l’accord du prince idrisside Yahyâ ibn Idrîs pour ériger le premier noyau de la future al-Quaraouiyine. Pour assurer l’entretien de l’édifice et en garantir le fonctionnement, elle légua en biens de mains mortes (waqf) tous ses trésors. La première mosquée était un simple oratoire, la prière du vendredi continuant d’être prêchée à la mosquée al-Shurafa. Elle n’y fut transférée qu’à partir de 933. La mosquée fut alors dotée d’un minbar et appelée mosquée "al Quaraouiyine" (mosquée des Kairouanais), en hommage à la ville d'origine de Fatima al-Fihriya.
La mosquée Al Quaraouiyine vit son architecture évoluer et s'agrandir. Elle devient, du Xe siècle au XIIe siècle, un important centre d'enseignement et une des premières universités au monde. Sa bibliothèque abrite toujours la plus ancienne copie d'une œuvre de Platon, datant du Xe siècle.

Du lieu de culte au lieu d'enseignement « universel »
L'historien marocain Mohammed Al-Manouni pense que c'est sous le règne des Almoravides que l'université s'ajouta réellement à la mosquée. D'autres historiens comme Alfred Bel et Évariste Lévi-Provençal ne donnent à la Quaraouiyine le titre d’université qu’à partir de l’époque mérinide, bien que le premier affirme qu'elle fut un centre religieux et intellectuel important du Maghreb depuis l'époque idrisside. Selon Abdelhadi Tazi il est difficile, voir impossible, d'établir la date à laquelle l'éducation formelle a été dispensée pour la première fois. La plus ancienne preuve trouvée d'enseignement daterait de 1121.
Ainsi, il faut attendre la première moitié du XIIe siècle pour voir sortir de Fès de grands philosophes (à l'image d'Avempace), mathématiciens (comme Ibn Al-Yasmine, inventeur du Triangle de Pascal), en plus de nombreux théologiens et personnalités littéraires. Cela signifie naturellement qu'à cette époque la ville de Fès est devenue capable de présenter des enseignements dans diverses branches (théologie (pas exclusivement islamique) jurisprudence, philosophie, médecine, mathématiques, astronomie, sciences de la langue…). Ces diverses branches qui, si elles sont concentrées dès l'époque à la Quaraouiyine avec logiquement des professeurs pour chaque matière, peuvent symboliser les futures facultés d'après les futures notions occidentales.
À cette époque, la Quaraouiyine remettait également à ses étudiants la « Ijazah » (qui veut dire « permission », « autorisation » ou « licence »), document dont le professeur George Makdisi (en) avance l'hypothèse qu'il serait une sorte de qualification ou doctorat délivré dans le système éducatif islamique médiéval et pourrait même être à l'origine de la Licentia docendi (doctorat européen médiéval), opinion partagée par d'autres chercheurs comme le professeur Alfred Guillaume.

Au XIVe siècle et au-delà (époques wattasside, saadienne, alaouite), beaucoup de grands savants et lettrés du Maghreb et de ce qui restait de l’Andalousie sont passés à Fès et sa Quaraouiyine en tant qu’étudiants, professeurs ou simples auditeurs tels que Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Khaldoun, Léon l'Africain, Al Yusi, et bien d'autres. 
Certains des plus grands érudits chrétiens, comme le Belge Nicolaus Clenardus et le Néerlandais Jacob Golius, ont également enrichi le système éducatif d'Al-Quaraouiyine.

L'université sous la dynastie alaouite
Moulay Rachid, premier sultan de la dynastie des Alaouites, portait un réel intérêt pour le domaine scientifique et en fit profiter l'université Al Quaraouiyine. Il y attira des Oulémas d’autorité venus sous le nom de « Achcharratine » et institua la tradition dite «  Soltane Tolba » (sultan des étudiants) ; manifestation qui avait lieu chaque année durant les vacances du printemps sous le Patronage de l’Etat et du Roi lui-même, et au cours de laquelle la masse des étudiants choisissait un Sultan, désignait son gouvernement pour une période de quinze jours.
À cette occasion, on organisait des colloques scientifiques, des débats autour des questions cruciales ; on prononçait des discours et on lisait des poèmes. Une élite de notables de la ville honorait de sa présence cette manifestation et entourait de sa sollicitude le « sultan des étudiants ».
Cette manifestation qui revêtait les aspects d’une fête populaire mais d’un type particulier était aussi marquée – événement rare - par la visite du sultan alaouite qui à l’occasion, offrait des cadeaux aux étudiants, écoutait leurs doléances et veillait à ce que leurs vœux fussent satisfaits. C’était le témoignage le plus sûr et la preuve la plus directe que le sultan pût apporter de son intérêt pour la science et ses promoteurs attitrés et à venir ; un geste qu’on n’enregistrât nulle part ailleurs, du moins sous cette forme, dans le monde entier.
L’action des Alaouites au profit de l’université Al Quaraouiyine continua en la personne de Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah (Mohammed III) dont l’intervention infléchit de façon décisive les efforts de l'université pour réorganiser ses enseignements, voire les adapter aux besoins et attentes des étudiants qu’elle accueillait. Il ouvrit ainsi un dossier consacré à l'université Al Quaraouiyine et promulgua un dahir royal en l'an 1203 de l'Hégire (1789 de l’ère chrétienne) où il demanda au cheikh d’Al Quaraouiyine de définir les matières enseignées et d’en indiquer les ouvrages de référence.
À cette époque, plusieurs sources s’accordent sur l’existence à Fès d’une centaines de chaires d’enseignement dont vingt étaient établies à l’université Al Quaraouiyine et les autres disséminées à travers la ville dans ses différentes dépendances ou annexes. Les mêmes sources font état d’un grand nombre de bibliothèques autant publiques que privées.

Plus vieille université du monde encore active
Elle est considérée comme la plus ancienne université au monde encore en activité par l'UNESCO, le Livre Guinness des records,  et par plusieurs historiens. 
Cependant, ce statut est contesté par certains historiens, qui soulignent que l'université Zitouna en Tunisie, fondée en 737, est antérieure à Al Quaraouiyine et a joué un rôle central dans l'enseignement islamique. Par ailleurs, l'université de Bologne, fondée en 1088, est souvent considérée comme la première université au sens moderne du terme, avec une organisation académique formalisée et des diplômes structurés.

Architecture
Tous les matériaux nécessaires furent extraits d'une carrière établie sur le terrain même. L'eau fut fournie par un puits creusé également au même lieu.
La mosquée mesurait alors 150 empans (environ 35 mètres) de longueur du nord au sud. Elle comprenait quatre nefs, une petite cour, un mirhab ainsi qu'un minaret peu élevé.
La mosquée compte 270 colonnes formant 16 nefs de 21 arcs chacune. Chaque nef contient 4 rangées de 210 fidèles, soit 840 ce qui donne pour les 16 nefs 13 440. Ajoutons 160, nombre des fidèles pouvant se placer au besoin devant les colonnes ; 2700 autres peuvent trouver place dans la cour et 6000 dans la galerie, les vestibules et les seuils des portes. Au total, pas moins de 22 700 fidèles peuvent entendre la prière à la fois.

L'université moderne
L'université Quaraouiyne s'est instituée en université moderne à partir des années 1960.
Les études aujourd'hui enseignées sont fortement orientées vers la religion (histoire et exégèse), la littérature (Critique littéraire, la Philologie, la Linguistique, les Méthodes de recherche) et le droit (étude de la théologie islamique) et les langues dans une moindre mesure. L'université est subdivisée en facultés réparties sur plusieurs villes du Maroc (Fès, Agadir, Tétouan, Marrakech, Es-Semara). L'université délivre des diplômes visés par l'État marocain.

Marrakesh or Marrakech (; Arabic: مراكش, romanized: murrākuš, pronounced [murraːkuʃ]) is the fourth-largest city in Morocco. It is one of the four imperial cities of Morocco and is the capital of the Marrakesh-Safi region. The city lies west of the foothills of the Atlas Mountains.
The city was founded circa 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar as the capital of the Almoravid dynasty. The Almoravids established the first major structures in the city and shaped its layout for centuries to come. The red walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122–1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone afterwards, have given the city the nickname of the "Red City" or "Ochre City". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading center for the Maghreb. After a period of decline, Marrakesh regained its status in the early 16th century as the capital of the Saadian dynasty, with sultans Abdallah al-Ghalib and Ahmad al-Mansur embellishing the city with an array of sumptuous monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among Sufi pilgrims for its seven patron saints who are buried here. In 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and T'hami El Glaoui became Pasha of Marrakesh and generally held this position until the independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956.
Marrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls. This medina quarter is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and contains the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, a large number of souks (markets), the Kutubiyya Mosque, and many other historic and cultural sites. The city serves as a major economic center and tourist destination. Real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city.
Marrakesh is served by Ménara International Airport and by Marrakesh railway station, which connects the city to Casablanca and northern Morocco. Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including Cadi Ayyad University. A number of Moroccan football clubs are here, including Najm de Marrakech, KAC Marrakech, Mouloudia de Marrakech and Chez Ali Club de Marrakech. The Marrakesh Street Circuit hosts the World Touring Car Championship, Auto GP and FIA Formula Two Championship races.

Etymology
The exact meaning of the name is debated. One possible origin of the name Marrakesh is from the Berber (Amazigh) words amur (n) akush, which means "Land of God". According to historian Susan Searight, however, the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the Qarawiyyin library in Fez, where its meaning was given as "country of the sons of Kush". The word mur is used now in Berber mostly in the feminine form tamurt. The same word "mur" appears in Mauretania, the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from μαύρος mauros, the ancient Greek word for "dark". The common English spelling is "Marrakesh", although "Marrakech" (the French spelling) is also widely used. The name is spelled Mṛṛakc in the Berber Latin alphabet, Marraquexe in Portuguese, Marrakech in Spanish. A typical pronunciation in Moroccan Arabic is merrākesh (/mərra:kəʃ/) with stress on the second syllable.
From medieval times until around the beginning of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco was known as the "Kingdom of Marrakesh", as the kingdom's historic capital city was often Marrakesh. The name for Morocco is still "Marrakesh" to this day in Persian and Urdu as well as many other South Asian languages. Various European names for Morocco (Marruecos, Marrocos, Maroc, Marokko, etc.) are directly derived from the name Murrākush. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called Marocco City (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name of the city and the country diverged after the Treaty of Fez divided Morocco into a French protectorate in Morocco and Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and the old interchangeable usage lasted widely until about the interregnum of Mohammed Ben Aarafa (1953–1955). The latter episode set in motion the country's return to independence, when Morocco officially became المملكة المغربية (al-Mamlaka al-Maġribiyya, "The Maghreb Kingdom"), its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames, including the "Red City" (Arabic: المدينة الحمراء, romanized: Al-madīnat al-ḥamrā'), the "Ochre City" and "the Daughter of the Desert", and has been the focus of poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to "a drum that beats an African identity into the complex soul of Morocco."

History
The Marrakesh area was inhabited by Berber farmers from Neolithic times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area. Marrakesh was founded by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and second cousin of the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin (c. 1061–1106). Historical sources cite a variety of dates for this event ranging between 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar), according to Ibn Abi Zar and Ibn Khaldun, and 1078 (470 AH), according to Muhammad al-Idrisi. The date most commonly used by modern historians is 1070, although 1062 is still cited by some writers. 

The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty seeking to reform Islamic society, ruled an emirate stretching from the edge of Senegal to the centre of Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers. They used Marrakesh as their capital and established its first structures, including mosques and a fortified residence, the Ksar al-Hajjar, near the present-day Kutubiyya Mosque. These Almoravid foundations also influenced the layout and urban organization of the city for centuries to come. For example, the present-day Jemaa el-Fnaa originated from a public square in front of the Almoravid palace gates, the Rahbat al-Ksar, and the major souks (markets) of the city developed roughly in the area between this square and the city's main mosque, where they remain today. The city developed the community into a trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. It grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting Aghmat, which had long been the capital of Haouz. Andalusi craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville built and decorated numerous monuments, importing the Cordoban Umayyad style characterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique style of architecture which was fully adapted to the Marrakesh environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin built houses, minted coins, and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans. His son and successor, Ali Ibn Yusuf, built the Ben Youssef Mosque, the city's main mosque, between 1120 and 1132. He also fortified the city with city walls for the first time in 1126–1127 and expanded its water supply by creating the underground water system known as the khettara.

In 1125, the preacher Ibn Tumart settled in Tin Mal in the mountains to the south of Marrakesh, founding the Almohad movement. This new faction, composed mainly of Masmuda tribesmen, followed a doctrine of radical reform with Ibn Tumart as the mahdi, a messianic figure. He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby Aghmat, but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesh following an unsuccessful siege in 1130. Ibn Tumart died shortly after in the same year, but his successor Abd al-Mu'min took over the political leadership of the movement and captured Marrakesh in 1147 after a siege of several months. The Almohads purged the Almoravid population over three days and established the city as their new capital. They went on to take over much of the Almoravids' former territory in Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. In 1147, shortly after the city's conquest, Abd al-Mu'min founded the Kutubiyya Mosque (or Koutoubia Mosque), next to the former Almoravid palace, to serve as the city's new main mosque. The Almoravid mosques were either demolished or abandoned as the Almohads enacted their religious reforms. Abd al-Mu'min was also responsible for establishing the Menara Gardens in 1157, while his successor Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1163–1184) began the Agdal Gardens. Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199), possibly on the orders of his father Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, was responsible for building the Kasbah, a citadel and palace district on the south side of the city. The Kasbah housed the center of government and the residence of the caliph, a title borne by the Almohad rulers to rival the eastern Abbasid Caliphate. In part because of these various additions, the Almohads also improved the water supply system and created water reservoirs to irrigate their gardens. Thanks to its economic, political, and cultural importance, Marrakesh hosted many writers, artists, and intellectuals, many of them from Al-Andalus, including the famous philosopher Averroes of Cordoba.

The death of Yusuf II in 1224 began a period of instability. Marrakesh became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and the ahl ad-dar (descendants of Ibn Tumart), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. Marrakesh was taken, lost and retaken by force multiple times by a stream of caliphs and pretenders, such as during the brutal seizure of Marrakesh by the Sevillan caliph Abd al-Wahid II al-Ma'mun in 1226, which was followed by a massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation of Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah Mosque. After al-Ma'mun's death in 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquiring the support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them for the sack. Hearing of the terms, the people of Marrakesh sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city from destruction with a sizable payoff of 500,000 dinars. In 1269, Marrakesh was conquered by the Marinids, a Zenata tribe who overran the Almohads in Morocco. While Marrakesh remained a major city, it lost its capital status to Fez and underwent a period of relative decline.

In the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of Morocco. After a period when it was the seat of the Hintata emirs, it reestablished its status during the reigns of the Saadian sultans Abdallah al-Ghalib and Ahmad al-Mansur. Under the Saadian dynasty, Marrakesh experienced a new golden age. Thanks to the wealth amassed by the sultans, it was embellished with sumptuous palaces while its ruined monuments were restored. El Badi Palace, begun by Ahmad al-Mansur in 1578, was made with costly materials including marble from Italy. The palace was intended primarily for hosting lavish receptions for ambassadors from Spain, England, and the Ottoman Empire, showcasing Saadian Morocco as a nation whose power and influence reached as far as the borders of Niger and Mali. 

For centuries Marrakesh has been known as the location of the tombs of Morocco's seven patron saints (sebaatou rizjel). When sufism was at the height of its popularity during the late 17th-century reign of Moulay Ismail, the festival of these saints was founded by Abu Ali al-Hassan al-Yusi at the request of the sultan. The tombs of several renowned figures were moved to Marrakesh to attract pilgrims, and the pilgrimage associated with the seven saints is now a firmly established institution. Pilgrims visit the tombs of the saints in a specific order, as follows: Sidi Yusuf Ali Sanhaji (1196–97), a leper; Qadi Iyyad or qadi of Ceuta (1083–1149), a theologian and author of Ash-Shifa (treatises on the virtues of Muhammad); Sidi Bel Abbas (1130–1204), known as the patron saint of the city and most revered in the region; Sidi Muhammad al-Jazuli (1465), a well known Sufi who founded the Jazuli brotherhood; Abdelaziz al-Tebaa (1508), a student of al-Jazuli; Abdallah al-Ghazwani (1528), known as Moulay al-Ksour; and Sidi Abu al-Qasim Al-Suhayli, (1185), also known as Imam al-Suhayli. Until 1867, European Christians were not authorized to enter the city unless they acquired special permission from the sultan; east European Jews were permitted.
During the early 20th century, Marrakesh underwent several years of unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier Ba Ahmed, who had been designated regent until the designated sultan Abd al-Aziz became of age, the country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, Marrakesh caliph Moulay Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by Ulama scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother, Abd al-Aziz. It was also in 1907 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, was murdered in Marrakesh, suspected of spying for his country. France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of Oujda to the major metropolitan center of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al-Hiba, a son of Sheikh Ma al-'Aynayn, who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Reguibat tribal warriors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established. After the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman, which saw the victory of the French Mangin column over the al-Hiba forces in September 1912, the French seized Marrakesh. The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their leaders from the powerful Glaoui family, leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens in the resulting turmoil.

T'hami El Glaoui, known as "Lord of the Atlas", became Pasha of Marrakesh, a post he held virtually throughout the 44-year duration of the Protectorate (1912–1956). Glaoui dominated the city and became famous for his collaboration with the general residence authorities, culminating in a plot to dethrone Mohammed Ben Youssef (Mohammed V) and replace him with the Sultan's cousin, Ben Arafa. Glaoui, already known for his amorous adventures and lavish lifestyle, became a symbol of Morocco's colonial order. He could not, however, subdue the rise of nationalist sentiment, nor the hostility of a growing proportion of the inhabitants. Nor could he resist pressure from France, who agreed to terminate its Moroccan Protectorate in 1956 due to the launch of the Algerian War (1954–1962) immediately following the end of the war in Indochina (1946–1954), in which Moroccans had been conscripted to fight in Vietnam on behalf of the French Army. After two successive exiles to Corsica and Madagascar, Mohammed Ben Youssef was allowed to return to Morocco in November 1955, bringing an end to the despotic rule of Glaoui over Marrakesh and the surrounding region. A protocol giving independence to Morocco was then signed on 2 March 1956 between French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau and M’Barek Ben Bakkai.

Since the independence of Morocco, Marrakesh has thrived as a tourist destination. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the city became a trendy "hippie mecca". It attracted numerous western rock stars and musicians, artists, film directors and actors, models, and fashion divas, leading tourism revenues to double in Morocco between 1965 and 1970. Yves Saint Laurent, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Jean-Paul Getty all spent significant time in the city; Laurent bought a property here and renovated the Majorelle Gardens. Expatriates, especially those from France, have invested heavily in Marrakesh since the 1960s and developed many of the riads and palaces. Over the following decades, the demographic importance of the historic medina declined, due to much of it being converted from residential housing to commercial properties as well as due to the general expansion of the city beyond its traditional areas. In 1984, about 51% of the city's population lived in the medina, whereas only 22% did in 2004. 
United Nations agencies became active in Marrakesh beginning in the 1970s, and the city's international political presence has subsequently grown. In 1985, UNESCO declared the old town area of Marrakesh a UNESCO World Heritage Site, raising international awareness of the cultural heritage of the city. In the 1980s, Patrick Guerand-Hermes purchased the 30 acres (12 ha) Ain el Quassimou, built by the family of Leo Tolstoy. On 15 April 1994, the Marrakesh Agreement was signed here to establish the World Trade Organisation, and in March 1997 Marrakesh served as the site of the World Water Council's first World Water Forum, which was attended by over 500 international participants.
In the 21st century, property and real estate development in the city has boomed, with a dramatic increase in new hotels and shopping centres, fuelled by the policies of Mohammed VI of Morocco, who aims to increase the number of tourists annually visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. In 2010, a major gas explosion occurred in the city. On 28 April 2011, a bomb attack took place in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, killing 15 people, mainly foreigners. The blast destroyed the nearby Argana Cafe. Police sources arrested three suspects and claimed the chief suspect was loyal to Al-Qaeda, although Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb denied involvement. In November 2016 the city hosted the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In September 2023, the city was affected by a deadly earthquake. From October 9 to October 15, 2023, the city hosted the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group.

Geography
The city is located in the Tensift River valley, with the Tensift River passing along the northern edge of the city. The Ourika River valley is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Marrakesh. The city has expanded north from the old centre with suburbs such as Daoudiat, Diour El Massakine, Sidi Abbad, Sakar and Amerchich, to the southeast with Sidi Youssef Ben Ali, to the west with Massira and Targa, and southwest to M'hamid beyond the airport. On the P2017 road leading south out of the city are large villages such as Douar Lahna, Touggana, Lagouassem, and Lahebichate, leading eventually through desert to the town of Tahnaout at the edge of the High Atlas, the highest mountainous barrier in North Africa. The average elevation of the snow-covered High Atlas lies above 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). It is mainly composed of Jurassic limestone. The mountain range runs along the Atlantic coast, then rises to the east of Agadir and extends northeast into Algeria before disappearing into Tunisia.

Climate
Marrakesh features a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long, hot dry summers and brief, mild to cool winters. Average temperatures range from 12 °C (54 °F) in the winter to 26–30 °C (79–86 °F) in the summer. The relatively wet winter and dry summer precipitation pattern of Marrakesh mirrors precipitation patterns found in Mediterranean climates. However, the city receives less rain than is typically found in a Mediterranean climate, which results in a semi-arid climate classification.
Between 1961 and 1990 the city averaged 281.3 millimetres (11.1 in) of precipitation annually. Barrows says of the climate, "The region of Marrakesh is frequently described as desert in character, but, to one familiar with the southwestern parts of the United States, the locality does not suggest the desert, rather an area of seasonal rainfall, where moisture moves underground rather than by surface streams, and where low brush takes the place of the forests of more heavily watered regions. The location of Marrakesh on the north side of the Atlas, rather than the south, prevents it from being described as a desert city, and it remains the northern focus of the Saharan lines of communication, and its history, its types of dwellers, and its commerce and arts, are all related to the great south Atlas spaces that reach further into the Sahara desert."

Climate change
A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a "moderate" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Marrakesh in 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Bir Lehlou in Western Sahara. The annual temperature would increase by 2.9 °C (5.2 °F), and the temperature of the coldest month by 1.6 °C (2.9 °F), while the temperature of the warmest month would increase by 7 °C (13 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.

Water
Marrakesh's water supply relies partly on groundwater resources, which have lowered gradually over the last 40 years, attaining an acute decline in the early 2000s. Since 2002, groundwater levels have dropped by an average of 0.9 m per year in 80% of Marrakesh and its surrounding area. The most affected area experienced a drop of 37 m (more than 2 m per year).

Demographics
According to the 2014 census, the population of Marrakesh was 928,850 against 843,575 in 2004. The number of households in 2014 was 217,245 against 173,603 in 2004.

Economy
Marrakesh is a vital component of the economy and culture of Morocco. Improvements to the highways from Marrakesh to Casablanca, Agadir and the local airport have led to a dramatic increase in tourism in the city, which now attracts over two million tourists annually. Because of the importance of tourism to Morocco's economy, King Mohammed VI vowed in 2012 to double the number of tourists, attracting 20 million a year to Morocco by 2020. The city is popular with the French, and many French celebrities have bought property in the city, including fashion moguls Yves St Laurent and Jean-Paul Gaultier. In the 1990s very few foreigners lived in the city, and real estate developments have dramatically increased in the last 15 years; by 2005 over 3,000 foreigners had purchased properties in the city, lured by its culture and the relatively cheap house prices. It has been cited in French weekly magazine Le Point as the second St Tropez: "No longer simply a destination for a scattering of adventurous elites, bohemians or backpackers seeking Arabian Nights fantasies, Marrakech is becoming a desirable stopover for the European jet set." However, despite the tourism boom, the majority of the city's inhabitants are still poor, and as of 2010, some 20,000 households still have no access to water or electricity. Many enterprises in the city are facing colossal debt problems.
After the Great Recession and the 2008 financial crisis, in 2011, investments in real estate progressed substantially both in the area of tourist accommodation and social housing. The main developments have been in facilities for tourists including hotels and leisure centres such as golf courses and health spas, with investments of 10.9 billion dirham (US$1.28 billion) in 2011. The hotel infrastructure in recent years has experienced rapid growth. In 2012, alone, 19 new hotels were scheduled to open, a development boom often compared to Dubai. Royal Ranches Marrakech, one of Gulf Finance House's flagship projects in Morocco, is a 380 hectares (940 acres) resort under development in the suburbs and one of the world's first five star Equestrian Resorts. The resort is expected to make a significant contribution to the local and national economy, creating many jobs and attracting thousands of visitors annually; as of April 2012 it was about 45% complete.
The Avenue Mohammed VI, formerly Avenue de France, is a major city thoroughfare. It has seen rapid development of residential complexes and many luxury hotels. Avenue Mohammed VI contains what is claimed to be Africa's largest nightclub: Pacha Marrakech, a trendy club that plays house and electro house music. It also has two large cinema complexes, Le Colisée à Gueliz and Cinéma Rif, and a new shopping precinct, Al Mazar.

Trade and crafts are extremely important to the local tourism-fueled economy. There are 18 souks in Marrakesh, employing over 40,000 people in pottery, copperware, leather and other crafts. The souks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian-style scarves imported from India or China. Local boutiques are adept at making western-style clothes using Moroccan materials. The Birmingham Post comments: "The souk offers an incredible shopping experience with a myriad of narrow winding streets that lead through a series of smaller markets clustered by trade. Through the squawking chaos of the poultry market, the gory fascination of the open-air butchers' shops and the uncountable number of small and specialist traders, just wandering around the streets can pass an entire day." Marrakesh has several supermarkets including Marjane Acima, Asswak Salam and Carrefour, and three major shopping centres, Al Mazar Mall, Plaza Marrakech and Marjane Square; a branch of Carrefour opened in Al Mazar Mall in 2010. Industrial production in the city is centred in the neighbourhood of Sidi Ghanem Al Massar, containing large factories, workshops, storage depots and showrooms. Ciments Morocco, a subsidiary of a major Italian cement firm, has a factory in Marrakech.
Marrakesh is one of North Africa's largest centers of wildlife trade, despite the illegality of most of this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Tortoises are particularly popular for sale as pets, and Barbary macaques and snakes can also be seen. The majority of these animals suffer from poor welfare conditions in these stalls.

Politics
Marrakesh, the regional capital, constitutes a prefecture-level administrative unit of Morocco, Marrakech Prefecture, forming part of the region of Marrakech-Safi. Marrakesh is a major centre for law and jurisdiction in Morocco and most of the major courts of the region are here. These include the regional Court of Appeal, the Commercial Court, the Administrative Court, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal of Commerce, and the Administrative Court of Appeal. Numerous organizations of the region are based here, including the regional government administrative offices, the Regional Council of Tourism office, and regional public maintenance organisations such as the Governed Autonomous Water Supply and Electricity and Maroc Telecom.
On 12 June 2009, Fatima-Zahra Mansouri, a then 33-year-old lawyer and daughter of a former assistant to the local authority chief in Marrakesh, was elected the first female mayor of the city, defeating outgoing Mayor Omar Jazouli by 54 votes to 35 in a municipal council vote. Mansouri became the second woman in the history of Morocco to obtain a mayoral position, after Asma Chaabi, mayor of Essaouira and was elected to serve as Marrakech's mayor for a second term in September 2021.
Since the legislative elections in November 2011, the ruling political party in Marrakesh has, for the first time, been the Justice and Development Party or PDJ which also rules at the national level. The party, which advocates Islamism and Islamic democracy, won five seats; the National Rally of Independents (RNI) took one seat, while the PAM won three.  In the partial legislative elections for the Guéliz Ennakhil constituency in October 2012, the PDJ under the leadership of Ahmed El Moutassadik was again declared the winner with 10,452 votes. The PAM, largely consisting of friends of King Mohammed VI, came in second place with 9,794 votes.

Landmarks
Jemaa el-Fnaa
The Jemaa el-Fnaa is one of the best-known squares in Africa and is the centre of city activity and trade. It has been described as a "world-famous square", "a metaphorical urban icon, a bridge between the past and the present, the place where (spectacularized) Moroccan tradition encounters modernity." It has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985. The square's name has several possible meanings; the most plausible etymology endorsed by historians is that it meant "ruined mosque" or "mosque of annihilation", referring to the construction of a mosque within the square in the late 16th century that was left unfinished and fell into ruin. The square was originally an open space for markets located on the east side of the Ksar el-Hajjar, the main fortress and palace of the Almoravid dynasty who founded Marrakesh.
Historically this square was used for public executions by rulers who sought to maintain their power by frightening the public. The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. It drew tradesmen, snake charmers, dancing boys, and musicians playing pipes, tambourines and African drums. Today the square attracts people from diverse backgrounds and tourists from all around the world. Snake charmers, acrobats, magicians, mystics, musicians, monkey trainers, herb sellers, story-tellers, dentists, pickpockets, and entertainers in medieval garb still populate the square.

Souks
Marrakesh has the largest traditional market in Morocco and the image of the city is closely associated with its souks. Historically, the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist, though with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still a very important part of trade in the souks.
The Medina is also famous for its street food. Mechoui Alley is particularly famous for selling slow-roasted lamb dishes. The Ensemble Artisanal, located near the Koutoubia Mosque, is a government-run complex of small arts and crafts which offers a range of leather goods, textiles and carpets. Young apprentices are taught a range of crafts in the workshop at the back of this complex.

City walls and gates
The ramparts of Marrakesh, which stretch for some 19 kilometres (12 mi) around the medina of the city, were built by the Almoravids in the 12th century as protective fortifications. The walls are made of a distinct orange-red clay and chalk, giving the city its nickname as the "red city"; they stand up to 19 feet (5.8 m) high and have 20 gates and 200 towers along them.

Of the city's gates, one of the best-known is Bab Agnaou, built in the late 12th century by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur as the main public entrance to the new Kasbah. The gate's carved floral ornamentation is framed by three panels marked with an inscription from the Quran in Maghrebi script using foliated Kufic letters. The medina has at least eight main historic gates: Bab Doukkala, Bab el-Khemis, Bab ad-Debbagh, Bab Aylan, Bab Aghmat, Bab er-Robb, Bab el-Makhzen and Bab el-'Arissa. These date back to the 12th century during the Almoravid period and many of them have been modified since.

Gardens
The city is home to a number of gardens, both historical and modern. The largest and oldest gardens in the city are the Menara Gardens to the west and the Agdal Gardens to the south. The Menara Gardens were established in 1157 by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min. They are centered around a large water reservoir surrounded by orchards and olive groves. A 19th-century pavilion stands at the edge of the reservoir. The Agdal Gardens were established during the reign of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1163–1184) and extend over a larger area today, containing several water basins and palace structures. The Agdal Gardens cover about 340 hectares (1.3 sq mi) and are surrounded by a circuit of pisé walls, while the Menara Gardens cover around 96 hectares (0.37 sq mi). The water reservoirs for both gardens were supplied with water through an old hydraulic system known as khettaras, which conveyed water from the foothills of the nearby Atlas Mountains.

The Majorelle Garden, on Avenue Yacoub el Mansour, was at one time the home of the landscape painter Jacques Majorelle. Famed designer Yves Saint Laurent bought and restored the property, which features a stele erected in his memory, and the Museum of Islamic Art, which is housed in a dark blue building. The garden, open to the public since 1947, has a large collection of plants from five continents including cacti, palms and bamboo.
The Koutoubia Mosque is also flanked by another set of gardens, the Koutoubia Gardens. They feature orange and palm trees, and are frequented by storks. The Mamounia Gardens, more than 100 years old and named after Prince Moulay Mamoun, have olive and orange trees as well as a variety of floral displays. In 2016, at a location between the city and the Atlas Mountains, artist André Heller opened the ANIMA garden, which combines a diverse collection of plants with a display of works by famous artists such as  Keith Haring and Pablo Picasso. In the same year, a large restored riad garden set within a historical mansion, located inside the medina, was opened to visitors as Le Jardin Secret ('The Secret Garden').

Palaces and Riads
The historic wealth of the city is manifested in palaces, mansions and other lavish residences. The best-known palaces today are the El Badi Palace and the Bahia Palace, as well as the main Royal Palace which is still in use as one of the official residences of the King of Morocco. Riads (Moroccan mansions, historically designating a type of garden) are common in Marrakesh. Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and lowered the temperature within the building. Numerous riads and historic residences exist through the old city, with the oldest documented examples dating back to the Saadian period (16th-17th centuries), while many others date from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Mosques
The Koutoubia Mosque is one of the largest and most famous mosques in the city, located southwest of Jemaa el-Fnaa. The mosque was founded in 1147 by the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min. A second version of the mosque was entirely rebuilt by Abd al-Mu'min around 1158, with Ya'qub al-Mansur possibly finalizing construction of the minaret around 1195. This second mosque is the structure that stands today. It is considered a major example of Almohad architecture and of Moroccan mosque architecture generally. Its minaret tower, the tallest in the city at 77 metres (253 ft) in height, is considered an important landmark and symbol of Marrakesh. It likely influenced other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat.
Ben Youssef Mosque is named after the Almoravid sultan Ali ibn Yusuf, who built the original mosque in the 12th century to serve as the city's main Friday mosque. After being abandoned during the Almohad period and falling into ruin, it was rebuilt in the 1560s by Abdallah al-Ghalib and then completely rebuilt again Moulay Sliman at the beginning of the 19th century. The 16th-century Ben Youssef Madrasa is located next to it. Also next to it is the Almoravid Qubba, a rare architectural remnant of the Almoravid period which was excavated and restored in the 20th century. It is a domed kiosk that demonstrates a sophisticated style and is an important indication of the art and architecture of the period.
The Kasbah Mosque overlooks Place Moulay Yazid in the Kasbah district of Marrakesh, close to the El Badi Palace. It was built by the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansour in the late 12th century to serve as the main mosque of the kasbah (citadel) where he and his high officials resided. It contended with the Koutoubia Mosque for prestige and the decoration of its minaret was highly influential in subsequent Moroccan architecture. The mosque was repaired by the Saadi sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib following a devastating explosion at a nearby gunpowder reserve in the second half of the 16th century. Notably, the Saadian Tombs were built just outside its southern wall in this period.
Among the other notable mosques of the city is the 14th-century Ben Salah Mosque, located east of the medina centre. It is one of the only major Marinid-era monuments in the city. The Mouassine Mosque (also known as the Al Ashraf Mosque) was built by the Saadian sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib between 1562–63 and 1572–73. It was part of a larger architectural complex which included a library, hammam (public bathhouse), and a madrasa (school). The complex also included a large ornate street fountain known as the Mouassine Fountain, which still exists today. The Bab Doukkala Mosque, built around the same time further west, has a similar layout and style as the Mouassine Mosque. Both the Mouassine and Bab Doukkala mosques appear to have been originally designed to anchor the development of new neighbourhoods after the relocation of the Jewish district from this area to the new mellah near the Kasbah.

Tombs
One of the most famous funerary monuments in the city is the Saadian Tombs, which were built in the 16th century as a royal necropolis for the Saadian Dynasty. It is located next to the south wall of the Kasbah Mosque. The necropolis contains the tombs of many Saadian rulers including Muhammad al-Shaykh, Abdallah al-Ghalib, and Ahmad al-Mansur, as well as various family members and later sultans. It consists of two main structures, each with several rooms, standing within a garden enclosure. The most important graves are marked by horizontal tombstones of finely carved marble, while others are merely covered in colorful zellij tiles. Al-Mansur's mausoleum chamber is especially rich in decoration, with a roof of carved and painted cedar wood supported on twelve columns of carrara marble, and with walls decorated with geometric patterns in zellij tilework and vegetal motifs in carved stucco. The chamber next to it, originally a prayer room equipped with a mihrab, was later repurposed as a mausoleum for members of the Alawi dynasty.
The city also holds the tombs of many Sufi figures. Of these, there are seven patron saints of the city, which are visited every year by pilgrims during the seven-day ziyara pilgrimage. During this time, pilgrims visit the tombs in the following order: Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji, Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi, Sidi Bel Abbas, Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulayman al-Jazouli, Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a, Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani, and lastly, Sidi Abderrahman al-Suhayli. Many of these mausoleums also serve as the focus of their own zawiyas (Sufi religious complexes with mosques), including: the Zawiya and mosque of Sidi Bel Abbes (the most important of them), the Zawiya of al-Jazuli, the Zawiya of Sidi Abdellaziz, the Zawiya of Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali, and the Zawiya of Sidi al-Ghazwani (also known as Moulay el-Ksour).

Mellah
The Mellah of Marrakesh is the old Jewish Quarter (Mellah) of the city, and is located in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at the site where the sultan's stables were. At the time, the Jewish community consisted of a large portion of the city's tailors, metalworkers, bankers, jewelers, and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Slat al-Azama Synagogue (or Lazama Synagogue), built around a central courtyard, is in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is within the Medina on land adjacent to the Mellah. According to the World Jewish Congress there were only 250 Moroccan Jews remaining in Marrakesh.

Hotels
As one of the principal tourist cities in Africa, Marrakesh has over 400 hotels. Mamounia Hotel is a five-star hotel in the Art Deco-Moroccan fusion style, built in 1925 by Henri Prost and A. Marchis. It is considered the most eminent hotel of the city and has been described as the "grand dame of Marrakesh hotels." The hotel has hosted numerous internationally renowned people including Winston Churchill, Prince Charles and Mick Jagger. Churchill used to relax within the gardens of the hotel and paint there. The 231-room hotel, which contains a casino, was refurbished in 1986 and again in 2007 by French designer Jacques Garcia. Other hotels include Eden Andalou Hotel, Hotel Marrakech, Sofitel Marrakech, Palm Plaza Hotel & Spa, Royal Mirage Hotel, Piscina del Hotel, and Palmeraie Palace at the Palmeraie Rotana Resort. In March 2012, Accor opened its first Pullman-branded hotel in Marrakech, Pullman Marrakech Palmeraie Resort & Spa. Set in a 17 hectares (42 acres) olive grove at La Palmeraie, the hotel has 252 rooms, 16 suites, six restaurants and a 535 square metres (5,760 sq ft) conference room.

Culture
Museums
The Marrakech Museum, housed in the Dar Menebhi Palace in the old city centre, was built at the beginning of the 20th century by Mehdi Menebhi. The palace was carefully restored by the Omar Benjelloun Foundation and converted into a museum in 1997. The museum holds exhibits of both modern and traditional Moroccan art together with fine examples of historical books, coins and pottery produced by Moroccan Arab, Berber, and Jewish peoples.

The Dar Si Said Museum is to the north of the Bahia Palace. It was the mansion of Si Said, brother to Grand Vizier Ba Ahmad, and was constructed in the same era as Ahmad's own Bahia Palace. In the 1930s, during the French Protectorate period, it was converted into a museum of Moroccan art and woodcraft. After recent renovations, the museum reopened in 2018 as the National Museum of Weaving and Carpets.
The former home and villa of Jacques Majorelle, a blue-coloured building within the Majorelle Gardens, was converted into the Berber Museum (Musée Pierre Bergé des Arts Berbères) in 2011, after previously serving as a museum of Islamic art. It exhibits a variety of objects of Amazigh (Berber) culture from across different regions of Morocco.
The House of Photography of Marrakech, opened by Patrick Menac’h and Hamid Mergani in 2009, holds exhibits of vintage Moroccan photography from the 1870s to 1950s. The Mouassine Museum, by the same owners, consists of a historic 16th–17th-century house in the Mouassine neighbourhood which has been opened as a museum and cultural venue.
Elsewhere in the medina, the Dar El Bacha hosts the Musée des Confluences, which opened in 2017. The museum holds temporary exhibits highlighting different facets of Moroccan culture as well as various art objects from different cultures across the world.  Various other small and often privately owned museums also exist, such as the Musée Boucharouite and the Perfume Museum (Musée du Parfum). Dar Bellarj, an arts center located in a former mansion next to the Ben Youssef Mosque, also occasionally hosts art exhibits. The Tiskiwin Museum is housed in another restored medina mansion and features a collection of artifacts from across the former the trans-Saharan trade routes. A number of art galleries and museums are also found outside the medina, in Gueliz and its surrounding districts in the new city.

Music, theatre and dance
Two types of music are traditionally associated with Marrakesh. Moroccan music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style is said to have emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.
The Théâtre Royal de Marrakesh, the Institut Français and Dar Chérifa are major performing arts institutions in the city. The Théâtre Royal, built by Tunisian architect Charles Boccara, puts on theatrical performances of comedy, opera, and dance in Arabic and French. A great number of storytellers, musicians and others also perform outdoor shows to entertain locals and tourists on the Jemaa el-Fnaa, especially at night.

Crafts
The arts and crafts of Marrakesh have had a wide and enduring impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Arabic and Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (another name for rayon, also sometimes called cactus silk). Ceramics are in varying styles in monochrome, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.
Wood crafts are generally made of cedar, including the riad doors and palace ceilings. Orange wood is used for making ladles known as harira (lentil soup ladles). Thuya craft products are made of caramel coloured thuya, a conifer indigenous to Morocco. Since this species is almost extinct, these trees are being replanted and promoted by the artists' cooperative Femmes de Marrakech.
Metalwork made in Marrakesh includes brass lamps, iron lanterns, candle holders made from recycled sardine tins, and engraved brass teapots and tea trays used in the traditional serving of tea. Contemporary art includes sculpture and figurative paintings. Blue veiled Tuareg figurines and calligraphy paintings are also popular.

Festivals
Festivals, both national and Islamic, are celebrated in Marrakesh and throughout the country, and some of them are observed as national holidays. Cultural festivals of note held in Marrakesh include the National Folklore Festival, the Marrakech Festival of Popular Arts (in which a variety of famous Moroccan musicians and artists participate), international folklore festival Marrakech Folklore Days and the Berber Festival. The International Film Festival of Marrakech, which aspires to be the North African version of the Cannes Film Festival, was established in 2001. The festival, which showcases over 100 films from around the world annually, has attracted Hollywood stars such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Susan Sarandon, Jeremy Irons, Roman Polanski and many European, Arab and Indian film stars. The Marrakech Bienniale was established in 2004 by Vanessa Branson as a cultural festival in various disciplines, including visual arts, cinema, video, literature, performing arts, and architecture.

Food
Surrounded by lemon, orange, and olive groves, the city's culinary characteristics are rich and heavily spiced but not hot, using various preparations of Ras el hanout (which means "Head of the shop"), a blend of dozens of spices which include ash berries, chilli, cinnamon, grains of paradise, monk's pepper, nutmeg, and turmeric. A specialty of the city and the symbol of its cuisine is tanjia marrakshia, affectionately referred to as bint ar-rimad (بنت الرماد "daughter of the ash"), a local meal prepared with beef meat, spices, and smen and slow-cooked in a ceramic pot in traditional oven in hot ashes. Tajines can be prepared with chicken, lamb, beef or fish, adding fruit, olives and preserved lemon, vegetables and spices, including cumin, peppers, saffron, turmeric, and ras el hanout. The meal is prepared in a tajine pot and slow-cooked with steam. Another version of tajine includes vegetables and chickpeas seasoned with flower petals. Tajines may also be basted with "smen" Moroccan ghee that has a flavour similar to blue cheese.
Shrimp, chicken and lemon-filled briouats are another traditional specialty of Marrakesh. Rice is cooked with saffron, raisins, spices, and almonds, while couscous may have added vegetables. A pastilla is a filo-wrapped pie stuffed with minced chicken or pigeon that has been prepared with almonds, cinnamon, spices and sugar. Harira soup in Marrakesh typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and tripe stew are commonly sold at the stalls of Jemaa el-Fnaa.

The desserts of Marrakesh include chebakia (sesame spice cookies usually prepared and served during Ramadan), tartlets of filo dough with dried fruit, or cheesecake with dates.
The Moroccan tea culture is practiced in Marrakesh; green tea with mint is served with sugar from a curved teapot spout into small glasses. Another popular non-alcoholic drink is orange juice. Under the Almoravids, alcohol consumption was common; historically, hundreds of Jews produced and sold alcohol in the city. In the present day, alcohol is sold in some hotel bars and restaurants.

Education
Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including Cadi Ayyad University (also known as the University of Marrakech), and its component, the École nationale des sciences appliquées de Marrakech (ENSA Marrakech), which was created in 2000 by the Ministry of Higher Education and specializes in engineering and scientific research, and the La faculté des sciences et techniques-gueliz which known to be number one in Morocco in its kind of faculties. Cadi Ayyad University was established in 1978 and operates 13 institutions in the Marrakech Tensift Elhaouz and Abda Doukkala regions of Morocco in four main cities, including Kalaa of Sraghna, Essaouira and Safi in addition to Marrakech. Sup de Co Marrakech, also known as the École Supérieure de Commerce de Marrakech, is a private four-year college that was founded in 1987 by Ahmed Bennis. The school is affiliated with the École Supérieure de Commerce of Toulouse, France.

Ben Youssef Madrasa
The Ben Youssef Madrasa, north of the Medina, was an Islamic college in Marrakesh named after the Almoravid sultan Ali ibn Yusuf (1106–1142) who expanded the city and its influence considerably. It is the largest madrasa in all of Morocco and was one of the largest theological colleges in North Africa, at one time housing as many as 900 students.
This education complex specialized in Quranic law and was linked to similar institutions in Fez, Taza, Salé, and Meknes. The Madrasa was constructed by the Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557–1574) in 1564 as the largest and most prestigious madrasa in Morocco. The construction ordered by Abdallah al-Ghalib was completed in 1565, as attested by the inscription in the prayer room. Its 130 student dormitory cells cluster around a courtyard richly carved in cedar, marble and stucco. In accordance with Islam, the carvings contain no representation of humans or animals, consisting entirely of inscriptions and geometric patterns. One of the school's best known teachers was Mohammed al-Ifrani (1670–1745). After a temporary closure beginning in 1960, the building was refurbished and reopened to the public as a historical site in 1982.

Sport
Football clubs based in Marrakesh include Najm de Marrakech, KAC Marrakech, Mouloudia de Marrakech and Chez Ali Club de Marrakech. The city contains the Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan a race track which hosts the World Touring Car Championship and from 2017 FIA Formula E. The Marrakech Marathon is also held here. Roughly 5000 runners turn out for the event annually. Also, here takes place Grand Prix Hassan II tennis tournament (on clay) part of ATP World Tour series.
Golf is a popular sport in Marrakech. The city has three golf courses just outside the city limits and played almost through the year. The three main courses are the Golf de Amelikis on the road to Ourazazate, the Palmeraie Golf Palace near the Palmeraie, and the Royal Golf Club, the oldest of the three courses.

Transport
Bus
BRT Marrakesh, a bus rapid transit system using trolleybuses was opened in 2017.

Rail
The Marrakesh railway station is linked by several trains running daily to other major cities in Morocco such as Casablanca, Tangiers, Fez, Meknes and Rabat. The Casablanca–Tangier high-speed rail line opened in November 2018.

Road
The main road network within and around Marrakesh is well paved. The major highway connecting Marrakesh with Casablanca to the north is the A7, a toll expressway, 210 km (130 mi) in length. The road from Marrakesh to Settat, a 146 km (91 mi) stretch, was inaugurated by King Mohammed VI in April 2007, completing the 558 km (347 mi) highway to Tangiers. Highway A7 connects also Marrakesh to Agadir, 233 km (145 mi) to the south-west.

Air
The Marrakesh-Menara Airport (RAK) is 3 km (1.9 mi) southwest of the city centre. It is an international facility that receives several European flights as well as flights from Casablanca, the United States, and several Arab nations. The airport is at an elevation of 471 metres (1,545 ft) at 31°36′25″N 008°02′11″W. It has two formal passenger terminals; these are more or less combined into one large terminal. A third terminal is being built. The existing T1 and T2 terminals offer a space of 42,000 m2 (450,000 sq ft) and have a capacity of 4.5 million passengers per year. The blacktopped runway is 4.5 km (2.8 mi) long and 45 m (148 ft) wide. The airport has parking space for 14 Boeing 737 and four Boeing 747 aircraft. The separate freight terminal has 340 m2 (3,700 sq ft) of covered space.

Healthcare
Marrakesh has long been an important centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century was described by contemporary historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al-Marrakushi as one of the greatest in the world at the time. A strong Andalusi influence was evident in this period, as one of the physicians in the hospital was from Denia in eastern Spain and many of the personal physicians of the caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Beja.
A severe strain has been placed upon the healthcare facilities of the city in the last decade as the city population has grown dramatically. Ibn Tofail University Hospital is one of the major hospitals of the city. In February 2001, the Moroccan government signed a loan agreement worth eight million U.S. dollars with The OPEC Fund for International Development to help improve medical services in and around Marrakesh, which led to expansions of the Ibn Tofail and Ibn Nafess hospitals. Seven new buildings were constructed, with a total floor area of 43,000 square metres (460,000 sq ft). New radiotherapy and medical equipment was provided and 29,000 square metres (310,000 sq ft) of existing hospital space was rehabilitated.
In 2009, king Mohammed VI inaugurated a regional psychiatric hospital in Marrakesh, built by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity, costing 22 million dirhams (approximately 2.7 million U.S. dollars).
The hospital has 194 beds, covering an area of 3 hectares (7.4 acres). Mohammed VI has also announced plans for the construction of a 450 million dirham military hospital in Marrakesh.

Jemaa el-Fnaa (Arabic: ساحة جامع الفناء, romanized: Sāḥat Jāmiʾ al-Fanā), also Jemaa el-Fna, Djema el-Fna or Djemaa el-Fnaa, is a square and market place in the medina quarter (old city) of Marrakesh, Morocco. It remains the main square of Marrakesh, used by locals and tourists.

Name
The origin of its name is unclear: jamaa means "congregation" or "mosque" in Arabic, probably referring to a destroyed mosque on the site. Fnaʼ or fanâʼ can mean "death/extinction" or "a courtyard, space in front of a building". "finâʼ in Arabic commonly means "open area"; a straight translation would be "the gathering/congregation area". Other meanings could be "The assembly of death", or "The Mosque at the End of the World". Another explanation is that it refers to a mosque with a distinctive courtyard or square in front of it. A third translation is "assembly of the dead", referring to public executions on the plaza around 1050 CE.

One specific explanation endorsed by historians comes from historical reports that the powerful Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur (ruled 1578–1603) had embarked on the construction of a monumental Friday mosque in the middle of the square. However, due to a downturn in fortunes (probably outbreaks of the plague) the sultan was forced to abandon the project part-way through. The mosque thus remained unfinished and fell into ruins. The ruined outline of its walls was apparently still visible in the 19th century and corresponded roughly to the current site of the "Souk Jdid" (the "new souk" just north of the food-stalls). In this way, "jamaa al-fna' " ostensibly refers to the place of the "ruined mosque". The name "Jamaa al-Fna' " appears in historical records for the first time in the 17th-century chronicle of the West African historian Abderrahman as-Sa'idi. As-Sa'idi claimed that the intended name of al-Mansur's unfinished mosque was jamaa al-hna, meaning "Mosque of Tranquility", but that after its abandonment it came to be known, by popular irony, as the "Mosque of ruination/annihilation", or jamaa al-fana' (the word fana' in this case meaning a state of being extinguished or totally ruined).

History
Early history: Almoravid and Almohad periods
Marrakesh was founded by the Almoravid dynasty in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar and subsequently developed by his successors. Initially, the city's two main monuments and focal points were the fortress known as Ksar el-Hajjar ("fortress of stone") and the city's first Friday mosque (the site of the future Ben Youssef Mosque). The Ksar el-Hajjar was located directly north of today's Kutubiyya Mosque. The major souk (market) streets of the city thus developed along the roads linking these two important sites and still correspond to the main axis of souks today. At one end of this axis, next to the Ksar el-Hajjar, a large open space existed for temporary and weekly markets. This space was initially known as Rahbat al-Ksar ("the place of the fortress"). Other historical records refer to it as as-Saha al-Kubra ("the grand square"), or simply as as-Saha or ar-Rahba.
The Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf (ruled 1106–1143) soon afterwards constructed a palace directly south of and adjacent to the Ksar el-Hajjar, on the actual site of the later Kutubiyya Mosque. One part of this palace was a monumental stone gate on its east side which faced towards the Rahbat al-Ksar. The gate likely played a symbolic role: it was the entrance to the palace for those seeking an audience with the sovereign, and it's possible the ruler himself would sit, enthroned, before the gate and publicly dispense justice on a weekly basis (a tradition which existed among other Moroccan and Andalusian ruling dynasties). The importance of the great public square in front of the royal palace thus led it to become the place for public executions, military parades, festivals, and other public events until long afterwards.
After a destructive struggle, Marrakech fell to the Almohads in 1147, who undertook many construction projects throughout the city. This included construction of the nearby Kutubiyya Mosque, begun in 1147, which was meant to replace the Almoravid-built Ben Youssef Mosque as the city's main mosque. Notably, a new royal kasbah (citadel) was erected further south by Ya'qub al-Mansur after 1184. As the Almohad rulers moved to the new kasbah, the old Almoravid palace and fortress fell out of use and was eventually torn down (in part to make way for the new Kutubiyya Mosque). Subsequently, with the fortunes of the city, the Jemaa el-Fna saw periods of decline and also renewal.

Later history: Saadian period to modern times
Despite the encroachment of new constructions on the edge of the square over time, it never disappeared due to its role as an open market area and as the site of public events. One attempt to fill a large part of the square is reported to have been made by the Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur who attempted to build a monumental mosque in the square. The mosque would have likely followed the same model as the Bab Doukkala and Mouassine Mosques, being deliberately built in the midst of major traffic routes in the city, and would have been accompanied by a number of attendant civic and religious buildings. The mosque was never finished, however, possibly due to disasters like the plague epidemics during al-Mansur's reign. Construction was abandoned part-way through and what had been built fell into ruin and was taken over by market stalls and other occupants. (It is probably also the site of a modern shop complex, Souk Jdid, just north of the food-stalls today, whose outline has the same compass orientation as the mosques of al-Mansur's time.) This ruined mosque may have given the square its current name, Jemaa el-Fna ("Mosque of Ruins").
On January 24, 1864, a massive explosion took place in the area of the square, reportedly caused by the criminal negligence of certain officials trying to avoid a government inspection. A fire in a funduq (commercial warehouse) ignited 500 quintals of gunpowder which were dangerously stored there. The explosion damaged houses and shops in a wide radius and resulted in some 300 deaths.
The square continued to serve as a meeting place at the heart of the city despite having no formal architectural delineation. In addition to its old role as a place of public executions, it was also the site of a traditional Friday market, a stage for the performance of fantasias, and the setting of public entertainment in the evenings (much as today). In 1922 the government (under French administration at the time), passed the first laws aimed at protecting and preserving the square's cultural space and heritage. In 2001 the square was proclaimed an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO, and in 2008 it was included in UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Beginning in May 2025, the square underwent a major renovation program scheduled for completion by the end of the year. With a budget of 160 million dirhams (approximately US$17.7 million), the project was designed to upgrade infrastructure, enhance accessibility, and reorganize public and commercial spaces while safeguarding the square’'s historic and cultural significance.

The Square
During the day it is predominantly occupied by orange juice stalls, water sellers with traditional leather water-bags and brass cups, youths with chained macaques and snake charmers despite the protected status of these species under Moroccan law.
As the day progresses, the entertainment on offer changes: the snake charmers depart, and late in the day the square becomes more crowded, with dancing-boys (it would be against custom for girls to provide such entertainment), story-tellers (telling their tales to an audience of locals), magicians, and peddlers of traditional medicines. As darkness falls, the square fills with dozens of food-stalls as the number of people on the square peaks.

The square is edged along one side by the Marrakesh souk, a traditional Maghreb market catering both for the common daily needs of the locals, and for the tourist trade. On other sides are hotels and gardens and café terraces, and narrow streets lead into the alleys of the medina quarter.
The square fulfills an important function for storytellers, and those cultural expressions have drawn worldwide attention. German filmmaker Thomas Ladenburger made a 90-minute documentary on the storytellers, and its importance for tourism received academic attention as well.

UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity
The idea of the UNESCO project Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity came from people concerned about the Jamaa el Fna. The place is known for its active concentration of traditional activities by storytellers, musicians and performers, but it was threatened by economic development pressures. In fighting for the protection of traditions, the residents called for action on an international level to recognize the need for the protection of such places — termed "cultural spaces" — and other popular and traditional forms of cultural expression.
UNESCO encourages communities to identify, document, protect, promote and revitalize such heritage. The UNESCO label aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity.

The spectacle of Jamaa el Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes — voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches. The oral tradition is framed by one much vaster — that we can call intangible. The Square, as a physical space, shelters a rich oral and intangible tradition.

2011 bombing
Shortly before noon on April 28, 2011, a blast originating in a café in the square killed 17 people and injured another 25. Initial reports blamed an accidental gas explosion, but officials later blamed "criminals" and "terrorists".

2023 earthquake
An earthquake with a 6.8 magnitude that struck Morocco in the evening of Friday the 8th of September 2023 highly damaged the Kharbouch Mosque and collapsed its minaret, which overlooked the square. In the days after the earthquake, local residents took to sleeping outside in the square to avoid the potential impact of aftershocks causing more buildings to collapse.

The Kutubiyya Mosque or Koutoubia Mosque (Arabic: جامع الكتبية Arabic pronunciation: [ˈdʒaːmiʕu‿lkutuˈbijːa(h)]) is the largest mosque in Marrakesh, Morocco. It is located in the southwest medina quarter of Marrakesh, near the Jemaa el-Fnaa market place, and is flanked by large gardens.
The mosque was founded in 1147 by the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min right after he conquered Marrakesh from the Almoravids. A second version of the mosque was entirely rebuilt by Abd al-Mu'min around 1158, with Ya'qub al-Mansur possibly finalizing construction of the minaret around 1195. This second mosque is the structure that stands today. It is an important example of Almohad architecture and of Moroccan mosque architecture generally. The minaret tower, 77 metres (253 ft) in height, is decorated with varying geometric arch motifs and topped by a spire and metal orbs. It likely inspired other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat, which were built shortly after in the same era. The minaret is also considered an important landmark and symbol of Marrakesh.

Etymology
The mosque's name derives from the Arabic word kutubiyyin (كُتُبيين), which means "booksellers". The Koutoubia Mosque, or Bookseller's Mosque, reflects the bookselling trade practised in the nearby souk. At one time as many as 100 book vendors worked in the streets at the base of the mosque.

Geography
The mosque is located about 200 metres (660 ft) west of the city's the Jemaa El Fna souq, a prominent market place which has existed since the city's establishment. It is situated on the Avenue Mohammed V, opposite Place de Foucauld. During French occupation, the network of roads was developed with the mosque as the central landmark, in the ville nouvelle. To the west and south of the mosque is a notable rose garden, and across Avenue Houmman-el-Fetouaki is the small mausoleum of the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin, one of the great builders of Marrakesh, consisting of a simple crenelated structure.
In the mosque's esplanade, which backs onto Jemaa el Fna, the ruins of the first Kutubiyya Mosque can be seen. A part of the perimeter of the Ksar al-Hajjar, the original stone fortress built in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the Almoravid founder of the city, was also uncovered on the northern side of the original mosque. Also visible today at the northeast corner of these ruins and in other areas around the adjacent plaza are various remains attributed to the palace of Ali ibn Yusuf, built next to the fortress and completed in 1126, before being demolished by the Almohads to make way for their new mosque. Directly east of the current mosque is a 19th-century walled residence known as Dar Moulay Ali, which now serves as the French consulate.
Also on the same esplanade is a small white domed building, the Koubba (or Qubba) of Lalla Zohra. This is the tomb of Fatima Zohra bint al-Kush (also called Lalla Zohra), a female mystic who died in the early 17th century and was buried here near the mosque.

History
Almohad conquest and reform of Marrakesh
The city of Marrakesh was founded around 1070 by the Almoravid dynasty to be their capital, but was captured in 1147 by the Almohads under their leader Abd al-Mu'min. While the Almohads decided to make Marrakesh their capital too, they did not want any trace of religious monuments built by the Almoravids, their staunch enemies, as they considered them heretics. They reportedly demolished all the mosques in the city, including the main mosque, the Ben Youssef Mosque, arguing that the Almoravid mosques were not aligned with the proper qibla (direction of prayer).
Since the former Almoravid grand mosque (i.e. the original Ben Youssef Mosque) was already closely integrated into the surrounding urban fabric, it was not practical for the Almohads to rebuild an entirely new mosque with a significantly different orientation on the same site. It's possible that they did not even demolish the mosque but merely left it derelict. The Almohads may have also wished to have the city's main mosque located closer to the kasbah and royal palaces, as was common in other Islamic cities. As a result, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build the new mosque right next to the former Almoravid kasbah, the Ksar el-Hajjar, which became the site of the new Almohad royal palace, located west of the city's main square (what is today the Jemaa el-Fnaa).

Almohad versus Almoravid qibla alignment
The issue of the qibla alignment of the Kutubiyya and other Almohad mosques (and of medieval Islamic mosques generally) is a complex one which is often misunderstood. The justification given by the Almohads for the destruction of existing Almoravid mosques was that their qibla was aligned too far toward the east, which the Almohads judged to be incorrect as they preferred a tradition that existed in the western Islamic world (the Maghreb and al-Andalus) according to which the qibla should be oriented toward the south instead. This alignment was actually further away from the "true" qibla used in modern mosques everywhere today, which points directly towards Mecca (i.e. towards the shortest possible path across the Earth's surface between the mosque and Mecca). Qibla orientations varied throughout the medieval period of Morocco, but the Almohads generally followed an orientation between 154° and 159° (numbers expressed as the azimuth from the true north), whereas the "true" qibla in Marrakesh is 91° (nearly due east). This true qibla was eventually adopted in modern times and is evident in more recent mosques – including the current Ben Youssef Mosque, rebuilt in 1819 with a qibla of 88° (slightly too far north but very close to 91°).
Medieval Muslims did possess sufficient mathematical knowledge to calculate a reasonably accurate "true" qibla. A more easterly qibla orientation (pointing approximately toward Mecca) was already evident in the royal mosque of Madinat al-Zahra (just outside Cordoba) built later in the 10th century, as well as in the orientation of the original Almoravid Ben Youssef Mosque (founded in 1126), estimated to be 103°.
The Almohads, who rose to power after these periods, apparently chose a qibla orientation which they saw as more ancient or traditional. Whether their interpretation of the qibla was a true and rigorously followed directive or a mostly symbolic argument to differentiate themselves from the Almoravids is still questioned by scholars. The Almohad qibla was similar to the qibla orientation of the prestigious Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Qarawiyyin Mosque of Fes, both founded at an early period in the late 8th to 9th centuries. This traditional qibla was based on a saying (hadith) of Muhammad which stated that "What is between the east and west is a qibla" (most likely in reference to his time in Medina, north of Mecca), which thus legitimized southern alignments. This practice may also have sought to emulate the orientation of the walls of the rectangular Kaaba structure inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, based on another tradition which considered the different sides of the Kaaba as being associated with different parts of the Muslim world. In this tradition, the northwest face of the Kaaba was associated with al-Andalus and, accordingly, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was oriented toward the southeast, as if facing the Kaaba's northwestern façade, with its main axis parallel to the main axis of the Kaaba structure (which is oriented from southeast to northwest). This architectural alignment was typically achieved by using astronomical alignments to reproduce the appropriate orientation of the Kaaba itself, whose minor axis is aligned with the direction of sunrise at the summer solstice.

The first Kutubiyya Mosque
The most commonly accepted chronology of the mosque's construction is the one originally proposed by French scholars Henri Terrasse and Henri Basset during their study of Almohad monuments in the first half of the 20th century, with further refinements by Gaston Deverdun in his 1959 book about Marrakesh. According to this view, Abd al-Mu'min began construction of the first Kutubiyya Mosque in 1147, the same year that he had conquered the city. The date of the first mosque's completion is unconfirmed, but is estimated to have been around 1157, when it is known with some certainty that prayers were conducted in the mosque, as it was in 1157 that a celebrated copy of the Qur'an attributed to the hand of Caliph Uthman, previously kept in the Great Mosque of Cordoba, was transferred here.
A more recent (2022) study by scholars Antonio Almagro and Alfonso Jiménez has argued for a reinterpretation of Arabic historical sources and proposes an alternative chronology. They argue that Abd al-Mu'min's commission of the new mosque was not related to the city's conquest but could have been inspired instead by the transfer of Uthman's Qur'an in 1157. In their view, construction on the mosque began in May 1158 and was completed later that same year, a rapid construction that was possible thanks to the construction methods employed (brick and rammed earth) and to the reuse of materials available nearby.

Although no longer standing today, the first mosque's layout is well-known thanks to modern excavations starting in 1923. The excavated foundations of the mosque, as well as the outline of its mihrab and qibla wall, are still visible today on the second mosque's northwestern side.
Adjoined to the walls of the former Almoravid kasbah, the mosque may have been built on top of some of the former Almoravid palace's annexes and maybe even over a royal cemetery or mausoleum. The new mosque was likely connected to the adjacent royal palace via a passage (sabat) which allowed the Almohad caliph to enter the prayer hall directly from his palace without having to pass through the public entrances (not unlike a similar passage that existed between the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the nearby Umayyad palace). This passage likely passed through the imam's chamber behind the southeastern qibla wall and therefore may have disappeared when the second mosque was built over this area.

At some point, Abd al-Mu'min also transferred to his new mosque the Almoravid minbar of the Ben Youssef Mosque, originally commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf from a workshop in Cordoba. Modern archeological excavations have also confirmed the existence in the first Kutubiyya Mosque of a near-legendary mechanism which allowed the wooden maqsura (a screen separating the caliph and his entourage from the rest of the crowd during prayers) to rise from a trench in the ground seemingly by itself, and then retract in the same manner when the caliph left. Another semi-automated mechanism also allowed the minbar to emerge and move forward from its storage chamber (next to the mihrab) seemingly by itself. The exact functioning of the mechanism is unknown, but may have relied on a hidden system of counterweights.
The new Almohad mosque, with its objects from Cordoba and its proximity next to the palace, was thus imbued with great political and religious symbolism. It was closely associated with the ruling Almohad dynasty while also making subtle references to the ancient Umayyad caliphate in Cordoba, whose great mosque was a model for much of subsequent Moroccan and Moorish architecture.

It is unclear if the first Kutubiyya Mosque had a minaret, though some historians have suggested that a former bastion or gate of the Almoravid kasbah may have been reused for the mosque's first minaret. Fragments of such a structure are visible today at the northeastern corner of the first mosque. They were identified by French archeologist Jacques Meunié as the remnants of a gate (referred to as Bab 'Ali or Bab 'Ali ibn Yusuf) belonging to the palatial expansion of the Almoravid kasbah by Ali ibn Yusuf. This structure might have been converted into the mosque's first minaret or served as the minaret's base. The remains of this minaret may have been visible even as late as the beginning of the 19th century, when a drawing of the area by Ali Bey el Abbassi appears to show a second tower standing north of the present-day Kutubiyya minaret. Almagro and Jiménez have argued that the remnants visible today belong to the first Almohad minaret and that it was built over a corner tower of the Almoravid fortress rather than a palace gate.

The second (current) Kutubiyya Mosque
At some point, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build a second mosque directly adjoined to the southeastern (qibla) side of the first mosque. The reasons for this unusual decision are still not fully understood. The most popular historical narrative asserts that Abd al-Mu'min discovered, possibly during its construction, that the initial mosque was misaligned with the qibla (presumably according to Almohad criteria). The second mosque is indeed aligned slightly further to the south, at an azimuth of 159° or 161° from the true north, compared to the 154° alignment of the first mosque, which actually makes the second mosque 5 to 7 degrees further out of alignment with respect to the "true" or modern qibla. Why this slightly different alignment was preferred is unclear; it may be that the first mosque was aligned with the walls of the Ksar el-Hajjar and that this was judged sufficient at the time, but that the alignment of the second mosque more closely matched that of the Tinmal Mosque (an important Almohad religious site) which had been built in the meantime. Other possible motivations for the construction of the second mosque may have been to accommodate a growing population, to make it more impressive by doubling its size, or even as an excuse to make one of the mosques exclusive to the ruling elites while the other was used by the general population.

The construction dates of the second mosque are also not firmly established. One historical source, originally written by Ibn Tufayl and reported by al-Maqqari, claims that Abd al-Mu'min began construction on a mosque in May 1158 (Rabi' al-Thani 553 AH) and that it was completed with the inauguration of the first Friday prayers in September (Sha'ban) of the same year. Because this construction period seems implausibly short, it is likely that construction either began before May 1158 or (perhaps more likely) continued after September 1158.
The minaret of the mosque, which is visible today, is also not conclusively dated. Some historical sources attribute it to Abd al-Mu'min (who reigned up until 1163) while others attribute it to Ya'qub al-Mansur (who reigned between 1184 and 1199). According to French scholar Gaston Deverdun and some later historians, the most likely scenario is that the minaret was begun before 1158 and largely built by Abd al-Mu'min, or at the very least designed on his commission. It is plausible, however, that Ya'qub al-Mansur either finished the work during his reign or that he added the small secondary "lantern" tower at its summit in 1195.
The second Kutubiyya Mosque was built almost identical to the first except for its adjusted orientation. The layout, architectural designs, dimensions and materials used for construction were almost all the same. The only architectural differences are in a few details and in the fact that the second mosque was slightly wider than the first. The mosque's floor plan is also slightly irregular due to the fact that its northern wall is still the old southern wall of the first mosque, which is at a slightly different angle (due to the different qibla orientation).
The Kutubiyya Mosque, and more specifically its minaret, was the forerunner of two other structures built on the same pattern, the Hassan Tower in Rabat (a monumental mosque begun by Ya'qub al-Mansur but never finished) and the Great Mosque of Seville, Spain, whose minaret is preserved as the Giralda. It thus became one of the models for subsequent Moroccan-Andalusian architecture.

Abandonment of the first mosque
It is not known when the first mosque was actually deserted, nor is it known for certain whether it was consciously demolished at some point or simply abandoned and allowed to deteriorate. Many scholars believe that the two mosques most likely coexisted for a time as one large mosque. If true, then the old qibla (southern) wall of the first mosque, which became the northern wall of the second mosque, was probably opened up in many places to allow easy circulation between the old and new buildings. This was only sealed up later, as it is today. Additionally, the mosque's current minaret appears to have been integrated into the fabric of both mosques, as evidenced by the remains of an arcade belonging to the first mosque and still attached to the base of the minaret today.
Deverdun, in his 1959 study of Marrakesh, suggested the possibility that the first mosque was only abandoned after Ya'qub al-Mansur built the new Kasbah, or royal citadel, further south. As part of this citadel, al-Mansur had raised the new Kasbah Mosque, completed in 1190, which subsequently served as the main mosque of the caliph and the ruling elites. This would have thus made the old Kutubiyya less useful – especially the first mosque, which was attached to the former, now abandoned, royal palace. It is also possible that the first Kutubiyya was dismantled in order to reuse its materials in the construction of the new kasbah and its mosque.
Almagro and Jiménez, in their 2022 study, propose that both the first and second mosques continued to operate as one mosque until the 17th century. They suggest that in the second half of the 17th century, when the Saadi dynasty's power collapsed and Marrakesh underwent a period of decline, the mosque was neglected and fell into disrepair. When Marrakesh benefited from a revival in the second quarter of the 18th century, the second part of the mosque was restored and parts of it were rebuilt, but the older section, which was probably more severely ruined, was abandoned instead of restored. At this point, the passages that connected the two sections were sealed off, thus turning the second mosque into its own, stand-alone building, as it appears today.

Modern period
Little documentation exists about the mosque during the early modern period. Based on stylistic grounds, Almagro and Jimnez argue that the mosque's ornate wood ceilings (particularly over the central nave) date to sometime in the 'Alawi period and after the 17th century, most likely during an 18th-century restoration. In the 19th century, records indicate that the 'Alawi sultans Muhammad IV (r. 1859–73) and Hasan I (r. 1873–94) restored the upper part of the minaret. Further restoration was carried out during the 20th century.
The mosque's minaret is featured in Tower of the Koutoubia Mosque, a painting by Winston Churchill made after the 1943 Casablanca Conference. The mosque and its minaret were restored at the end of the 1990s. In 2016 the mosque was fitted with solar panels, solar water heaters, and energy-efficient LED lights as part of an effort to make state-run mosques more dependent on renewable green energy.
The mosque is still active and non-Muslims are not allowed inside. However, it is possible to visit the Tinmal Mosque, built along the same lines, which is inactive but preserved as a historic site south of Marrakesh.
On 8 September 2023, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 Mw damaged the mosque. Video footage during the earthquake showed the mosque's structure shaking. The building remained standing after the earthquake, but cracks have been observed in the minaret. In March 2024, the mosque reopened after completion of renovation work.

Architecture
Architectural details of the first mosque and the second mosque are almost identical except for the orientation. Hence, what is true of one holds true for the other, though the first mosque is now only visible as archaeological remains. The mosque is a characteristic Almohad design, and its various elements resemble those of many other mosques from the same period. The mosque's floor plan is a slightly irregular quadrilateral due to the fact that its northern wall corresponds to the former southern wall of the first mosque and its different orientation. The current mosque is roughly 90 metres (300 ft) wide, 57 metres (187 ft) long on its west side, and 66 metres (217 ft) long on its east side. Aside from the minaret, the mosque is generally built in brick, although sandstone masonry is also used for parts of the outer walls. The same materials and construction methods are also evident in the first mosque.

Exterior
The mosque is located in a large plaza with gardens, and is floodlit at night. The wall on the northern side of the first mosque abutted the old Almoravid fortress wall (the Ksar el-Hajjar). There are eight entrances to the mosque: four on the west side and four on the east side. The eastern side faces the street where book shops were located, hence the name "Booksellers' Mosque". There is a private entrance for the imam on the south side of the mosque, leading to a door on the left side of the mihrab. Historically, the first Kutubiyya Mosque also had a private entrance next to the mihrab which was used by the ruler to enter directly into the maqsura.

Interior
Courtyard (sahn)
The rectangular sahn or courtyard is in the northern part of the mosque. It is 45 metres (148 ft) wide, the same width as the nine central naves, and 23 metres (75 ft) long or deep. There is an ablution fountain at the center of the courtyard. Nowadays trees are also planted in a grid pattern throughout the courtyard. The decoration is otherwise limited to the arches running along the edges of the courtyard, with some of the arches are highlighted with a polylobed molding carved around them.

Prayer hall
The interior prayer hall is a hypostyle hall with more than 100 pillars which support rows of horseshoe arches that divide the hall into 17 parallel naves or aisles which run perpendicular to the southern wall, or roughly north to south. The pillars and arches are made of brick covered in white plaster. The nine naves in the middle correspond to the width of the courtyard to the north and run the length of six arches, while the four outermost naves run continuously along the east and west sides of the courtyard (corresponding to the length of four extra arches), thus extending the prayer hall around either side of the courtyard. The naves are all covered by berchla or Moroccan wood-frame ceilings on the inside and sloped green-tiled roofs on the outside.
The mihrab, a niche symbolizing the qibla (direction of prayer), is set in the middle of the qibla wall (the southern wall) of the prayer hall and is a central focus of its layout. The prayer hall has a "T"-plan, in that the central nave aligned with the mihrab and another transverse (i.e. perpendicular) aisle running along the qibla wall are wider than other aisles and intersect each other (thus forming a "T" within the floor plan of the mosque). This layout is found in other Almohad mosques and in all major mosques of the Maghreb for much of the Islamic period; a clear T-plan is present in the 9th-century Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, for example, and in later Moroccan mosques. In addition to their greater width, the central nave and the southern transverse aisle are architecturally highlighted in other ways. unlike the other naves, The central nave is covered by a series of cupola ceilings instead of a long sloped roof. The central nave, as well as the adjacent nave on either side, is split into bays by five transverse arches (i.e. arches perpendicular to the other arches). The transverse arch right in front of the mihrab, as well as the two parallel arches on either side of the mihrab, have a lambrequin profile instead of a horseshoe profile and their intrados are carved with muqarnas sculpting. Finally, the southern (or qibla) transverse aisle of the mosque is bordered on its north side by an additional row of transverse arches with a polylobed profile, setting it apart from the rest of the mosque. Elsewhere, transverse polylobed or lambrequin arches are also used to demarcate the extensions of the prayer hall on either side of the courtyard from the rest of the mosque.
The southern qibla aisle is further decorated with five elaborate muqarnas cupolas: one in front of the mihrab, one at both southern corners of the prayer hall, and two more in between these (or, specifically, at the southern end of the outermost naves that intersect with the courtyard). Muqarnas consists of honeycomb or stalactite-like sculpting made up of hundreds of small niches arranged in a three-dimensional geometric composition. Although made with the same technique, the exact geometric composition of each muqarnas cupola in the mosque is slightly different. Most of the constituent niches are smooth, but eight-pointed stars are carved in the upper parts of the geometric alcoves.
The mihrab has a form which derives from the style established by the Great Mosque of Cordoba, although with some changes in the decorative elements. It consists of a horseshoe arch opening leading to a miniature chamber covered by an octagonal muqarnas dome. Carved decoration covers the wall surfaces around the mihrab arch. The arch is bordered with a scalloped or polylobed molding inside a rectangular alfiz frame, with rosettes in the upper corners. Above this are five false windows forming a blind arcade, with two of the windows filled with carved arabesques. All of this is surrounded in turn by a frieze of geometric decoration. The sides of mihrab's opening are decorated with six engaged marble columns (three on either side) whose ornately carved capitals are spolia originating from Cordoba in al-Andalus, brought to Marrakesh either by the Almohads or by the Almoravids before them. Two doors also flank the mihrab on either side: the one on the right is for the storage room of the minbar, while the one on the left was used by the imam to enter the mosque. Both doors are also flanked with engaged columns with more spolia capitals from Al-Andalus.
All of these decorative and architectural elements – the muqarnas cupolas, the mihrab decoration, and the hierarchical arrangement of arches – are found in similar form and placement in the Tinmal Mosque, which was built in the same period as the Kutubiyya, and in many later mosques such as the 16th-century Saadian mosques of Bab Doukkala and Mouassine.

Minaret
Overall design
The minaret is designed in Almohad style and was constructed in rubble masonry using sandstone. It was historically covered with Marrakshi pink plaster, but in the 1990s, experts opted to expose the original stone work and removed the plaster.
The design consists of a tall square or cuboid shaft, which takes up about four fifths of its height. At the top of this main shaft is an open-air platform that can reached from inside the tower. On top of this is a second, smaller square shaft, capped by a fluted dome. The full height of the minaret tower, from the ground to the top of its finial, is around 77 metres (253 ft). The main shaft measures 55.68 metres (182.7 ft) tall and has a square base measuring 12.81 metres (42.0 ft) per side. The second, upper shaft has a square base measuring 6.88 metres (22.6 ft) per side and its top edge (not including the dome and finial) reaches to a height of around 69.5 metres (228 ft) above the ground.
The minaret's height-to-width ratio is thus slightly over 5-to-1, which marked a shift in minaret design in the Maghreb, as these proportions made the Almohad minaret taller and more slender in comparison with earlier North African examples. The Kutubiyya minaret subsequently became a model for later minarets built in the regions that passed under Almohad influence.
The tower's prominence makes it a landmark structure of Marrakesh, which is maintained by an ordinance prohibiting any high rise buildings (above the height of a palm tree) to be built around it. The mu'azzin traditionally gave the adhan from the four cardinal directions from the platform at the top of the minaret, calling the faithful to prayer.

Exterior decoration
Many embellishing features of the minaret are also found in other religious buildings in the country, such as a wide band of ceramic tiles near the top and the alternation between different but related motifs on each façade of the minaret. The main shaft is marked by panels of sunken masonry forming blind arches and blind arcades of varying designs, including lambrequin arches and intersecting polylobed arches. These are set within rectangular frames around the tower's windows. Each of the four façades has a different series of these blind arch compositions, but the topmost tier is the same on each façade, featuring a panel of four intersecting polylobed arches.
The surface of the tower once featured polychrome decoration that was painted onto a mortar or plaster coating, highlighting some of the blind arches, niches, and spandrels. Although only traces remain today, they are one of the only surviving examples of such decoration from the Almohad period. The decoration is mostly executed in an ochre yellow over an ochre red background, or otherwise with a dark colour over a light background. In addition to some simple geometric motifs, the most elaborate examples are floral compositions based on a tree-of-life motif. There are also medallions containing stylized Kufic inscriptions with the words al-Mulku Lillah (Arabic: الملک للہ, lit. 'Sovereignty belongs to God') and al-'izzu Lillah (Arabic: العز لله, lit. 'Glory to God').
The white and green tiles near the top of the minaret are fastened by nails onto a wooden framework set into the masonry surface behind them. Forming a mosaic with a simple geometric pattern, this tilework is cited by Jonathan Bloom as the earliest reliably dated example of zellij in Morocco. 

Above this zellij band, the top edge of the minaret's main shaft is crowned by stepped merlons. The smaller, secondary shaft of the minaret, which rises from the platform here, is decorated with polylobed arches around a pair of windows on each of its four façades, which are then surmounted by panels of sebka decoration. Around the corners of the shaft, between these panels, the surfaces are covered in a kind of limewash which is inlaid with a geometric pattern based on an eight-pointed star pattern.

Finial
The minaret is topped by a traditional finial (jāmūr), a pole with three spheres decreasing in size towards the top, with the largest being 2 metres (6.6 ft) in diameter. The spheres are made of copper plating riveted together. There is a flag pole next to the copper balls forming the spire, which is used for hoisting the religious green flag of the Prophet, which the mu'azzin does every Friday and on religious occasions.
A popular legend about the orbs, of which there are variations, claims that they are made of pure gold. The legend was originally associated with the minaret of the Kasbah Mosque further south (which has a similar finial), but is nowadays often associated with the Kutubiyya instead. One version of the legend claims that there were at one time only three of them and that the fourth was donated by the wife of Yaqub al-Mansur as penance for breaking her fast for three hours one day during Ramadan. She had her golden jewelry melted down to form the fourth globe. Another version of the legend is that the balls were originally made entirely of gold fashioned from the jewellery of the wife of Saadi Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur.

Minaret interior
Inside the main shaft are six rooms in succession, one above the other. The whole tower can be ascended via a wide interior ramp that allowed the mu'azzin to ride a horse to the top. The different arrangements on the exterior façade of the minaret correspond to the positions of the window openings situated at different points along the ascending ramp inside. The chambers inside are also enlivened with varying degrees of decoration and with vault ceilings of different designs. The topmost (sixth) chamber is especially notable for its ornamental ribbed dome ceiling (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Cordoba) with muqarnas squinches and geometric patterns. Some of the surfaces of the walls inside the minaret are also carved with various graffiti in the form of architectural and decorative patterns, possibly left behind by artisans and architects who worked on the mosque over many years.

Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque
History
The Kutubiyya Mosque's original minbar (pulpit) was commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf, one of the last Almoravid rulers, and created by a workshop in Cordoba, Spain (al-Andalus). Its production started in 1137 and is estimated to have taken seven years. It is regarded as “one of the unsurpassed creations of Islamic art”. Its artistic style and quality was hugely influential and set a standard which was repeatedly imitated, but never surpassed, in subsequent minbars across Morocco and parts of Algeria. It is believed that the minbar was originally placed in the first Ben Youssef Mosque (named after Ali ibn Yusuf, but entirely rebuilt in later centuries). It was then transferred by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min to the first Kutubiyya Mosque and was later moved to the second incarnation of that mosque. It remained there until 1962, when it was moved to the El Badi Palace where it is now on display for visitors.

Description
The minbar is an essentially triangular structure with the hypotenuse side occupied by a staircase with nine steps. It is 3.46 metres (11.4 ft) long, 0.87 metres (2 ft 10 in) wide, and 3.86 metres (12.7 ft) tall. The main structure is made in North African cedar wood, although the steps were made of walnut tree wood and the minbar's base was made with fir tree wood. The surfaces are decorated through a mix of marquetry and inlaid sculpted pieces. The large triangular faces of the minbar on either side are covered in an elaborate and creative motif centered around eight-pointed stars, from which decorative bands with ivory inlay then interweave and repeat the same pattern across the rest of the surface. The spaces between these bands form other geometric shapes which are filled with panels of deeply carved arabesques, made from different coloured woods (boxwood, jujube, and blackwood). There is a 6 centimetres (2.4 in) wide band of Quranic inscriptions in Kufic script on blackwood and bone running along the top edge of the balustrades. The other surfaces of the minbar feature a variety of other motifs. Notably, the steps of the minbar are decorated with images of an arcade of Moorish (horseshoe) arches inside which are curving plant motifs, all made entirely in marquetry with different colored woods.

Mechanism moving the minbar and the maqsura
Historical accounts describe a mysterious semi-automated mechanism in the Kutubiyya Mosque by which the minbar would emerge, seemingly on its own, from its storage chamber next to the mihrab and move forward into position for the imam's sermon. Likewise, the maqsura of the mosque (a wooden screen that separated the caliph and his entourage from the general public during prayers) was also retractable in the same manner and would emerge from the ground when the caliph attended prayers at the mosque, and then retract once he left. This mechanism, which elicited great curiosity and wonder from contemporary observers, was designed by an engineer from Málaga named Hajj al-Ya'ish, who also completed other projects for the caliph. Modern archaeological excavations carried out on the first Kutubiyya Mosque have found evidence confirming the existence of such a mechanism, though its exact workings are not fully established. One theory, which appears plausible from the physical evidence, is that it was powered by a hidden system of pulleys and counterweights.

The Bahia Palace (Arabic: قصر الباهية) is a mid to late 19th-century palace in Marrakesh, Morocco. The palace was first begun by Si Musa, grand vizier under the Alawi sultan Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman, in the 1860s. It was expanded by his son Si Ba Ahmed ibn Musa, grand vizier of Sultan Moulay Abdelaziz, between 1894 and 1900. Today it is a well-known historic monument and tourist attraction in the city.
The palace has an irregular layout comprising around 150 rooms organized around multiple internal courtyards and riad gardens. It is most notable for its decoration, particularly its painted wood ceilings, along with sculpted stucco and zellij tilework. The original grounds of the palace also encompassed a wider area with gardens, parks, stables, a mosque, and other annexes.

History
First construction
Si Musa was descended from a family of black slaves which served the Moroccan makhzen (royal government) and reached the highest offices in the country. He was first hajib (similar to a chamberlain) then grand vizier under Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman, who reigned from 1859 to 1873. Construction of the palace took place in the 1860s. 
Among the existing parts of the palace today, the "Grand Riad" or large riad garden and its adjoining rooms in the northern part of the palace date from Si Musa's time and are also consequently known as the Dar Si Moussa. The two chambers on the east and west sides of the garden contain an inscription which dates their construction to 1866–7.

Expansion by Ba Ahmed
Ahmad ibn Musa, known also as Ba Ahmed, was hajib to Sultan Moulay Hassan and, upon the latter's death, ensured his son Abdelaziz's accession to the throne in 1894, earning him a promotion to grand vizier. As Abdelaziz was only sixteen, Ba Ahmed became the effective ruler of Morocco until his own death from disease in 1900. During his tenure, he was also supported by his two brothers, Si Sa'id and Idris (who died with him in 1900). 
He progressively expanded his father's palace throughout these years as grand vizier (1894–1900), adding to it piece by piece as new land became available for purchase. His brother Si Sa'id built his own palace north of here during this time, the Dar Si Said, which today serves as a museum.

Ba Ahmed was responsible for constructing most of the Bahia Palace's southern parts, which include various smaller courtyards and riad gardens. The marble-paved Grand Courtyard, one of the largest spaces in the palace today, is dated to 1896–7, during Ba Ahmed's tenure. On the east side of this palace complex, he created a vast private park and garden, complete with a central water basin. It could be accessed from the palace via a bridge over the adjacent street. The architect was a man named Muhammad ibn Makki al-Misfiwi, originally from Safi, who was born in 1857 and died in 1926. The palace's growth overtook much of the previously existing neighbourhood north of the Mellah and resulted in major changes in the local street layout. The growing palace housed Ba Ahmed's servants (including his own slaves) and his harem (private family residence). The name al-Bahia (Arabic: الباهية), meaning "the Brilliant", was reportedly the name of his favourite wife. The entire palace was built on one level, possibly as Ba Ahmed's own physique (which was described as stout and obese) made it more difficult for him to go up and down stairs.

20th century to present day
After Ba Ahmed's death in 1900, his palace became royal property. Mere hours after his death, Sultan Abdelaziz (who subsequently took full power over the country) reportedly ordered the palace to be looted for valuable items. In 1908, Madani el-Glaoui, brother of Thami el-Glaoui, took control of the palace and subsequently used it to entertain foreign guests. He added an upper floor for the first time to some parts of the palace. 
In 1912, after the installation of the French Protectorate in Morocco, the palace was converted into the residence of the French resident-general (Lyautey) in the city. After Moroccan independence, the palace was again used as a royal residence for King Mohammed V before being transferred to the Moroccan Ministry of Culture under King Hassan II, which turned it into a tourist attraction. 
Today, the palace is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Morocco; the government counted 410,141 visitors from January to April 2019, more than any other heritage site in the country. The palace is occasionally still used by the King of Morocco to receive foreign dignitaries or host events.
The palace suffered significant damages during the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco. An early assessment of damage reported, among other things, partial collapses in some of the houses and structures adjoining the palace or located on its grounds, damage to some of the roofs, fissures in some walls, and the collapse of a vaulted ceiling in the Grand Riad. The palace was subsequently closed for repairs and was reopened to visitors in October 2023.

Architecture
Layout
The palace's labyrinthine layout, which does not reveal a clear unified plan, is due to the fact that it was expanded in a piecemeal fashion in different stages over many years. It comprises a number of inner courtyards and riad gardens (interior gardens with a symmetrical four-part division), around which are arranged various rooms and chambers. The main palace complex today covers almost 2 hectares and contains approximately 150 rooms.

Entrance area and Small Riad
The palace grounds are entered via a horseshoe arch doorway from the main street, beyond which a long garden path leads to the palace. A minor courtyard leads into the Small Riad (Petit Riad), a square courtyard garden divided by walkways along its two central axes and surrounded by richly decorated galleries and chambers. One of the chambers was Ba Ahmed's diwan or Council Chamber. A second floor apartment above this riad was added by Madani el-Glaoui after Ba Ahmed's death. East of the Small Riad is a small inner courtyard, known as the Small Courtyard, surrounded by decorated chambers.

Grand Courtyard and harem
East of the Small Courtyard is the Grand Courtyard or Large Courtyard (also known in French as the Cour d'Honneur), the most impressive part of the palace. This part of the palace is dated to 1896–7. Measuring 50 by 30 meters, it is paved with Italian Carrara marble and surrounded by an elegant and colourful wooden gallery. These galleries give access to some 80 rooms which are believed to have been part of Ba Ahmed's harem and the residences of his concubines. At the east end of this courtyard is a grand hall (known as the Salle d'Honneur in French), measuring 20 by 8 meters and featuring a high ceiling with some of the best painted decoration in the palace. An inscription dates the construction of this chamber to 1896-1897, which was probably the last major expansion of the palace. 

West of the Grand Courtyard (more or less between the Small Courtyard to the south and the Great Riad to the north) is a private apartment built by Ba Ahmed in 1898 for his first wife, Lalla Zaynab.

Grand Riad
North of the Grand Courtyard area is another large courtyard known as the Grand Riad or Large Riad. Along with its adjoining rooms, it is the oldest part of the palace and dates from the time of Ba Ahmed's father, Si Musa. The courtyard is occupied, as its name implies, by a very large riad garden which is still planted with trees from the 19th century. The garden is flanked to the east and west by two grand halls with excellent decoration and an inscription which dates their construction to 1866-67.

Other areas
Further east, beyond the main palace, are the remains of a series of gardens and parks created by Ba Ahmed. Among other elements, they contained a large water basin. This area was originally a Saadian-era garden, the Arsat Ben Chegra, named after a Saadian vizier. On the south side of the palace are other annexes includes stables and a mosque with a minaret.

Decoration
The palace is most famous for its decoration. Its walls feature stucco carved with Arabic inscriptions, geometric patterns, arabesques, and muqarnas. Its floors are paved with marble and zellij tiles. Among its most famous elements are the cedar-wood ceilings painted with colourful floral patterns, along with the carved and painted wooden canopies of major doorways.

The materials for this decoration were imported by Ba Ahmed from all over Morocco, including marble from Meknes (possibly from former Moroccan royal palaces), cedar wood from the Middle Atlas, and tiles from Tetouan. Artisans from all across the country were also employed for the job.

قصر الباهية أحد المعالم التاريخية لمدينة مراكش المغربية...
ينتمي قصر الباهية الواقع في مراكش والذي يعود بناؤه إلى عهد الدولة العلوية للوزير أحمد بن موسى على عهد السلطان عبد العزيز، مسير شؤون الدولة انذاك، والملقب بـ «با حماد»،حيث جلب هذا الأخير امهر الصناع والحرفيين للاشتغال بالقصر لمدة ست سنوات متتالية، إلا أن القدر المحتوم حال دون رؤيته للقصر حيت وافته المنية سنة 1900 والأشغال لم تنته بعد. وهي من أشهر المعالم التاريخية في مراكش.

الأجنحة والقاعات
ويضم قصر الباهية عدة أجنحة وقاعات وملحقات وأحواض وحدائق بالإضافة إلى المنزه والحديقة التي يتوسطها صهريج المعروف باسم «أكدال با حماد» وبعد وفاة «با حماد» ترددت على القصر شخصيات نافذة حيت استقرت به سنة 1906، منها المدني الكلاوي أخ باشا مراكش، التهامي الكلاوي، وشيد به بناية في الطابق الثاني، بعده حل المقري بالقصر إلى حدود 1912، بعدها عرف القصر تهيئة جديدة وأصبح مقرا للمقيم العام الفرنسي «ليوطي» فأضيفت له المدفئات ومكيفات الهواء
تبلغ المساحة الإجمالية للقصر حوالي 22 ألف متر مربع إلا أنها تقلصت بعد تشييد عدة مؤسسات ومرافق في الحديقة الكبرى التي تم فصلها عن القصر، كما تغير مدخله الأصلي الذي يوجد بحي رياض الزيتون الجديد إلى بوابة قرب حي السلام (الملاح).

الرياض الصغير
ومن بين الأجنحة المفتوحة حاليا في وجه الزوار، الرياض الصغير الذي يعد من الأجنحة المتميزة داخل القصر ببنائه الشبيه بهيئة المدارس العتيقة من حيث الأروقة التي تعلوها أفاريز خشبية مزخرفة بألوان زاهية بمواد طبيعية، وكان يشكل ديوان «با حماد» الذي يستقبل فيه رجالات الدولة ومنه تدبر شؤون البلاد، استقر به المقيم العام «ليوطي» واتخذه منزلا ومكتبا يتكون فناؤه من الرخام والزليج ويتوفر على أربعة أحواض تتوسطها نافورة وتنفتح عليه قاعات تتميز أسقفها بزخرفة متميزة، ثم الساحة الصغرى التي يتواجد بها نافورة رخامية وهي من بين الأجنحة الخاصة بـ «با حماد»، صحن هذه الساحة يتداخل فيه الزليج والرخام وتحيط بها أربع قاعات كبيرة بأروقة وأقواس استخدمت مكاتب للضباط الفرنسيين، هذا إضافة إلى الساحة الشرفية أو ساحة الرخام الكبرى، وهي عبارة عن فناء واسع ومن أكبر ساحات القصر، تحيط بها أروقة بـ 52 عمودا من الخشب، أرضيتها من الرخام، وبها ثلاث نافورات إحداها وسط صهريج صغير، وغالبا ما يستغل هذا الجزء لإقامة الحفلات الموسيقية والمعارض التشكيلية وتنفتح عليها عدة قاعات بنوافذ ذات شبابيك حديدية، ومن أهم قاعاتها القاعة الشمالية وهي من أكبر قاعات القصر حيطانها مكسوة إلى النصف بالزليج، ونوافذها مفتوحة على الحديقة الأندلسية دائمة الاخضرار، وتعلوها افريزات من الجبص بشماسيات، وسقف خشبي بألواح مزخرفة ذات طابع إيطالي، وهي أحدث مابني في القصر كما تدل على ذلك لوحة بأحد الجدران تشير إلى سنة 1899.
من الساحة الشرفية تلج الرياض الكبير بواسطة ردهة منقوشة ومزخرفة، وقد عرف عدة تغييرات في عهد «با حماد» ، بالقاعة الكبرى الشمالية توجد أبيات شعرية منقوشة على الجبص تؤرخ لبنائه، كما شهدت قاعته الجنوبية عدة تغييرات تتضح من خلال شكل السقوف والزخارف وبجوارها جناح الزوجة النبيلة، وهو عبارة عن صحن مغطى بسقف خشبي به قاعتان وبهوان ويعد قصر الباهية تحفة رائعة نظرا لزخرفة أبوابه ونوافذه بباقات الأزهار والنباتات أو ما يعرف بـ «التشجير».

مزار سياحي
تم تصنيف القصر كمعلمة تاريخية يلج إليها الزوار والسياح الأجانب للتملي بفنون العمارة المغربية خصوصا النقش على الخشب، وقد اشرف على بناء القصر المهندس محمد بن المكي المسيوي الذي تلقى فنون صناعة الخشب بمكناس وفن النقش على الجبص بفاس على يد الضابط الفرنسي «اركمان» رئيس البعثة الفرنسية قبل الحماية، وكانت النواة الأولى لقصر الباهية على يد الحاجب الملكي موسى بن أحمد البخاري حيت شيد الرياض الكبير والساحة الشمالية للقصر لتتوقف الأشغال بهذا الجزء سنة 1886، وبعد وفاته تولى ابنه المعروف بـ «با حماد» استكمال بناء القصر فجمع في البداية حوالي 60 منزلا لتشكيل قصر كبير يعد رائعة الفن المعماري المغربي في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر.

El Badi Palace or Badi' Palace (Arabic: قصر البديع, lit. 'Palace of Wonder/Brilliance', also frequently translated as the "Incomparable Palace") is a ruined palace in Marrakesh, Morocco. It was commissioned by the sultan Ahmad al-Mansur of the Saadian dynasty a few months after his accession in 1578, with construction and embellishment continuing throughout most of his reign. The palace, decorated with materials imported from numerous countries ranging from Italy to Mali, was used for receptions and designed to showcase the Sultan's wealth and power. It was one part of a larger Saadian palace complex occupying the Kasbah district of Marrakesh.
The palace was neglected after al-Mansur's death in 1603 and eventually fell into ruin with the decline of the Saadian dynasty. Its valuable materials, particularly marble, were stripped away and reused in other buildings throughout Morocco. Today, it is a significant tourist attraction in Marrakesh and serves as an exhibition space. Notably, the Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque is displayed here.

Name
The name el-Badi' (Arabic: البديع), typically translated as "the Incomparable", is one of the 99 Names of God in Islam. Ahmad al-Mansur may have chosen the name due to his own reputed piety, but also to reflect his intention to create a superlative palace to impress guests. The name also had historical precedents in Moorish palace architecture as it was used to designate one of the pavilions in the Caliph's palace in Cordoba, Spain (al-Andalus).

History
Background
Prior to the reign of the Saadian sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib (ruled 1557-1574), the rulers of Marrakesh resided in the old Kasbah (citadel) built by the Almohad dynasty in the late 12th and early 13th century. According to the contemporary chronicler Marmol, Moulay Abdallah, a major builder in his time, was the first to build a new palace in the area where the El Badi Palace stands, along the northern edge of the Almohad kasbah near the Kasbah Mosque and the newly-begun Saadian Tombs. The El Badi Palace proper, however, was constructed by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur al-Dhahabi (ruled 1578-1603) at the height of the Saadian dynasty's power. The palace's construction, along with al-Mansur's other projects, was probably funded by the substantial ransom paid by the Portuguese after the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. The wealth of al-Mansur's reign was also due to the Saadians' control of the sugar trade. Morocco was at that time a significant exporter of sugar towards Europe, along with other products such as silk, copper, and leather. In 1590 al-Mansur launched military expeditions to the south which resulted in the conquest of Timbuktu and Gao in Mali and the defeat of the Songhai Empire. This control of the trans-Saharan trade routes allowed al-Mansur to increase Morocco's access not only to gold but also to slaves – on which the sugar processing industry relied and which were necessary to compete with the sugar trade coming from Brazil and the Caribbean (controlled by Europeans and also reliant on slaves).

Construction
According to al-Ifrani, construction of the palace began in December 1578 (Shawwal 986 AH), only a few months after the Saadian victory at the Battle of the Three Kings and Ahmad's accession to power, and took fifteen years, finishing in 1593 (1002 AH). French historian Gaston Deverdun, however, points out that the "Portuguese plan" of 1585 (an illustrated document providing important information on the layout of Marrakesh's kasbah at the time) shows us a fully completed palace, while at the same time there also exist records of Ahmad al-Mansur purchasing marble for construction up until 1602, a year before his death. This suggests that the major constructions of the palace may have been completed by the early 1580s but that al-Mansur continued to embellish the palace up until his death.
The construction of the palace was a major enterprise. The sultan had workers and artisans brought from many regions, including Europe, to aid in the construction; so much so that a flourishing market established itself near the construction site to cater to the workers. Al-Mansur was so involved in making sure that work continued efficiently that he even provided child care for his workers in order to ensure they were not distracted by other priorities. Materials were also imported from multiple regions and foreign countries, including marble columns fabricated in Italy and lime and plaster from Timbuktu.

Decline
After the fall of the Saadians and the rise of the Alawi dynasty the palace entered a period of rapid decline. It does not appear to have been maintained after al-Mansur's death and its premises were even plagued by malaria at one point. While the first Alaouite sultan, Moulay Rashid, was able to live here briefly in 1668-1669, less than ten years later his successor Moulay Isma'il ibn Sharif was unwilling to let ambassadors visit it because of its bad state. 
According to al-Ifrani, in 1707-08 (1119 AH) Moulay Isma'il ordered that the palace be demolished and stripped of its contents, materials and decorations, which were then re-used in the construction of his new palace and capital in Meknes. In reality, the dismantlement of the palace likely occurred progressively over time, beginning well before 1707 and also continuing after Moulay Isma'il. Architectural elements of Saadian origin, most likely including elements from the Badi Palace, are found in a number of buildings across Morocco and even in Algiers; for example, the Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il in Meknes and the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II in Fes. In the meantime, the ruins of the palace became a grazing site for animals and even an owl sanctuary.

Present day
The palace today is a well-known tourist attraction. The complex contains an exhibition space where the 12th-century Almoravid minbar that once stood in the Kutubiyya Mosque is on display, in addition to other exhibition spaces opened in 2018. For a number of years the Marrakesh Folklore Festival has taken place within the palace.
The palace was significantly damaged in the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco. An early assessment of the damage found major cracks in the walls of the palace's exhibition rooms and in the area where the modern bathrooms are located. The site was temporarily closed for repairs and was reopened to visitors in October 2023.

The Saadian royal complex
The Saadian palaces formed a complex built inside the vast kasbah (citadel) on the south side of the city, originally laid out during the Almohad period under Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur. Some of the various elements of the Saadian palaces may have already been built under Abdallah al-Ghalib, while Ahmad al-Mansur added to them and embellished them. 
The complex was entered via a "Grand Mechouar", a vast ceremonial square or courtyard, to the south of the Almohad-era Kasbah Mosque. The main gate of the royal palace was situated here and led to a smaller mechouar from which a long passage ran east to give access to the palace's various components. On the south side of this passage were most of the functional annexes of the palace, including kitchens, warehouses, the treasury, and stables. On the north side of the passage was the vast reception palace, the El Badi proper, along with the private quarters of the sultan and his family, their bathhouses (hammams), a private mosque, and the mint. Finally, beyond these structures, occupying the whole eastern side of the kasbah, were a number of pleasure gardens. These included the Crystal Garden (az-zujaj), the royal garden known as al-Mustaha ("the Desired") with a grand water basin, and the Qasr Garden or inner garden for al-Mansur's private quarters. Ahmad al-Mansur also renovated the vast Agdal Gardens to the south of the kasbah, originally created by the Almohads. The entire palace and citadel complex was surrounded by fortified walls, as in Almohad times and as still seen today. 
One curious feature inside the palace complex was a tall tower which is prominently depicted in descriptions of Marrakesh during the Saadian period but which was missing in the later Alawi era. Of uncertain origin, this structure may have been a private observation tower dating from either the Almohad or Saadian dynasty, used for the enjoyment of the sultan and similar to smaller elevated lookouts present in some aristocratic mansions in Marrakesh and Fes.

Architecture of El Badi
Layout
The El Badi Palace itself was a reception palace where Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur hosted and received guests. The floor plan of the palace is essentially rectangular, centered around a huge courtyard (measuring 135 by 110 metres) with a central pool (measuring 90.4 by 21.7 metres). The courtyard also had four enormous sunken gardens, excavated and rediscovered in modern times, which were arranged symmetrically around the central pool, as well as four other water basins (measuring roughly 30 by 20 metres) along the west and east sides of the courtyard. This arrangement was essentially that of a riad garden (a symmetrical interior garden in Moorish architecture) on a grand scale.

Each side of this rectangular courtyard had a large pavilion with a grand and ornate cupola (qubba), around which were other cupolas and structures. The two largest pavilions faced each other at the eastern and western ends of the courtyard. This arrangement of pavilions appears to be an evolution of the layout seen in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra, but on a grander scale.
The western pavilion of the courtyard was known in Arabic as al-Qubbat al-Khamsiniya (Arabic: القُبة الَخْمسينية, lit. 'Dome/Pavilion of the Fifty') named either after its surface area of some 50 cubits or the fact that it once featured 50 columns. "Al-Quba al-Khamsiniya" is also the title of a poem by Abd al-Aziz al-Fishtali, poet laureate of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur's court. It served as a reception hall or throne hall for the sultan. An alcove in the back wall of the chamber marks the spot where the sultan used to sit in attendance. Above this alcove was an Arabic inscription carved in black marble amidst the white marble covering the rest of the walls. At the middle of the hall was a fountain flanked by two water basins covered in delicate zellij decoration and fed with water spurting from silver sculptures of animals such as leopards, lions and pythons. 
The pavilion on the eastern side of the courtyard (no longer standing today) was known as the Qubbat az-Zujaj (Arabic: قبة الزجاج, lit. 'Pavilion of Crystal/Glass') or Qubbat ad-Dahab (Arabic: قبة الذهب, lit. 'Pavilion of Gold'). It was reserved for the sultan's private use and gave access to the Crystal Garden to the east (mentioned above). 
The pavilion on the courtyard's north side was known as the Qubbat al-Khadra (Arabic: القبة الخضراء, lit. 'Green Pavilion') and once had two stories with a number of rooms. An annex on the west side of this pavilion, paved with zellij and accessible to visitors today, contained three residential quarters which may have been used as guest quarters for foreign ambassadors. 

The southern pavilion was known as the Qubbat al-Khayzuran (Arabic: قبة الخيزران, lit. 'Pavilion of the Heliotrope/Myrtle'; possibly also named after one of al-Mansur's favourite concubines) and may have led to the women's quarters. Behind this pavilion were bathhouses which have been partially excavated and whose remains can be visited today. Aside from the pavilions, the rest of the courtyard's perimeter was lined with a gallery featuring "lambrequin" or "muqarnas"-profiled arches similar to those seen in the Court of the Lions and in other Moroccan Architecture.

Materials and decoration
The palace was a lavish display of the best craftsmanship of the Saadian period, constructed using some of the most expensive materials of the time, including gold and onyx, with colonnades made of Italian marble exchanged with Italian merchants for their equivalent weight in sugar. Although the core structure of the palace's walls were made in rammed earth reinforced with a mixture of lime, the walls were covered with these expensive materials and elaborate decoration (though today they stand bare due to the palace's later ruin).

The floors were paved with marble and zellij (mosaic tilework), the ceilings and capitals of the columns  were gilded, and the walls were covered in intricately carved stucco with calligraphic inscriptions. The fragments of zellij which have been uncovered in modern excavations in the palace show that the Saadian craftsmen had created geometric patterns of even greater complexity than those of previous periods, including examples of twenty-pointed stars. The various gardens and pools featured fountains with jets of water, reminiscent of the role of water in the Andalusian architecture of the Alhambra (which appears to have had a noted influence on Saadian architecture generally) and requiring an underground hydraulic infrastructure of vaults and channels.

The Saadian Tombs are a historic royal necropolis in Marrakesh, Morocco, located on the south side of the Kasbah Mosque, inside the royal kasbah (citadel) district of the city. They date to the time of the Saadian dynasty and in particular to the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur (1578–1603), though members of Morocco's monarchy continued to be buried here for a time afterwards. The complex is regarded by many art historians as the high point of Moroccan architecture in the Saadian period due to its luxurious decoration and careful interior design. Today the site is a major tourist attraction in Marrakesh.

Name
The necropolis is commonly known as the Saadian Tombs today. In historical Arabic texts, they were referred to as the "qubbas of the sharifs" or "tombs of the sharifs" (Arabic: قبر أشراف, romanized: qubur al-ashrāf).

History
Before the Saadians
The early history of the necropolis is not well known. The necropolis is located right behind the qibla wall (in this case the southeastern wall) of the Kasbah Mosque, which was built, along with the surrounding royal kasbah (citadel), by the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the late 12th century. Accordingly, it is believed that this was the site of a necropolis even in Almohad times, though there's no evidence of any significant figures being buried here at that time (the Almohad rulers were buried at Tinmal instead).
It is known, however, that in the 14th century, during the Marinid dynasty period, Sultan Abu al-Hasan was buried here temporarily in 1351. He died while in exile in the High Atlas mountains and Marrakesh was thus the closest city for burial (which, under Islamic tradition, must be carried out quickly). A few months later his body was then moved and reburied in the Marinid royal necropolis at Chellah (near Rabat). A marble tombstone with a long inscription attests to his first burial in the Marrakesh kasbah necropolis, and this tombstone is still found in the Chamber of the Three Niches in the Saadian tombs today (presumably moved there during or after Saadian construction). The Marinid sultan's burial here suggests that it must have already been a cemetery at the time. Afterwards, the necropolis also became the burial site of the Hintati emirs who controlled the region of Marrakesh from the mid-15th century until the 1520s. Some of their epitaphs are still visible today.

The Saadian necropolis
The present necropolis dates generally from the Saadian period but there are still some questions about the chronology and attribution of the various constructions which have not been resolved beyond doubt. The most generally cited timeline and the most complete analysis was laid out by Deverdun in 1959, based on a number of arguments and lines of evidence.

Beginnings under Abdallah al-Ghalib
The necropolis has two major structures: one to the east, surrounded by gardens on either side, and one to the west, next to the visitor entrance today. The eastern mausoleum was the first to be built, starting out as a simple square chamber adjoining the southern wall of the Kasbah Mosque. It is believed that this first mausoleum was built by the second Saadian sultan of Marrakesh, Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, between 1557 and 1574. Al-Ghalib was already a prolific builder throughout his reign and it seems he wished to erect a mausoleum to honor his father Muhammad al-Shaykh, the founder of the dynasty, who was killed in 1557 and buried here in what was probably a simple grave. Before Muhammad al-Shaykh some Saadians – most notably al-Qai'm, the dynasty's founder, and Ahmad al-Araj and his sons – had been buried in the Zawiya of al-Jazuli and its adjoining cemetery in the city.
Al-Ghalib himself was eventually buried next to his father in 1574, in the new mausoleum he had built. A dedicatory marble inscription panel was placed on the wall at the head of his tomb, but this panel was later moved (at an unknown date and for unknown reasons) to the Chamber of the Three Niches in the later western building. It is probable (but unconfirmed) that the fourth Saadian sultan, Abd al-Malik, was also buried next to Muhammad al-Shaykh (also his father), on the south side of the latter's tomb, in 1578 or after.

Expansion under Ahmad al-Mansur
The next building phase took place during the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, another of Muhammad al-Shaykh's sons and the most powerful and wealthy of the Saadian sultans, between 1578 and 1603. When al-Mansur's mother, Lalla Mas'uda, a wife of Muhammad al-Shaykh, died in 1591, he decided to have her buried within the same mausoleum chamber as that of his father. It was most likely on this occasion, or slightly after, that al-Mansur decided to modify and expand this mausoleum. He allegedly redid the decoration of the existing chamber, and added two rectangular loggia rooms on its eastern and western sides. He also created a much larger rectangular chamber (the so-called Grand Chamber) on the southern side, connected directly to the other three rooms. It's possible that al-Mansur intended this larger chamber to house his own tomb. At some point, he probably also commissioned two more dedicatory marble inscription panels to be placed at the heads of the tombs of his father (Muhammad al-Shaykh ) and his mother (Lalla Mas'uda). Again for unknown reasons and at an uncertain date, Muhammad al-Shaykh's dedicatory panel was moved to the western building and placed on the back wall of the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, where it is still visible today. The panel dedicated to Lalla Mas'uda has remained next to her grave (although it may have been moved around too).

At some point during al-Mansur's expansion and embellishment of the eastern mausoleum, between 1591 and 1598 (or before 1603 at latest), he decided to abandon this work and embarked on the construction of an entirely new building to the west. This new mausoleum was clearly intended for his own burial. The building was divided into three chambers, from south to north: the Chamber of the Mihrab (a prayer room, not originally meant to house any tombs), the Chamber of the Twelve Columns (a regal tomb chamber for himself), and the Chamber of the Three Niches (an annex to the main chamber). The first person to be buried in this building was probably one of al-Mansur's wives, Mahalla bint Omar al-Marin, in 1598, in a spot close to the eventual tomb of her husband in the Chamber of the Twelve Columns. Ahmad al-Mansur himself was buried in the center of this chamber upon his death in 1603. Some of the decoration in the Chamber of the Mihrab may have been left unfinished after his death. After al-Mansur, a number of other family members, including his successors, were buried in this chamber with him. Among the more important ones, the first was another of his wives, Lalla Aisha as-Shabaniyya, in 1623. Then it was their son, Sultan Moulay Zidan, in 1627, followed by Sultan Abd al-Malik II in 1631 and Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Saghir in 1653–54. Today, Moulay Zidan's epitaph is immediately to the right of his father's while to the left is Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Saghir. The ornate tombstones (of a type called mqabriya) over these five important royal family members (i.e. al-Mansur, Lalla Aisha as-Shabaniyya, Zidan, Abd al-Malik II, and al-Shaykh al-Saghir) are also the largest and finest in the mausoleum, carved in Carrara marble. Their strong similarity in style and craftsmanship has been argued as evidence that they were created by the same artisan or workshop of artisans between 1603 and 1655, with the mqabriyas of the first two (al-Mansur and Lalla Aisha as-Shabaniyya) probably being commissioned by their son Moulay Zidan and then serving as models for the other three tombstones made later. A number of other lesser royal family members are scattered around the chamber.

After the Saadians
The necropolis continued to be used as a burial place for some time after al-Mansur's death. The 'Alawi sultan Moulay Isma'il (ruled 1672–1727), who plundered the Saadian palaces, later restricted access to the Saadian necropolis by sealing it off from most of the surrounding buildings. Nonetheless, it continued to be used even in the 'Alawi period, as evidenced by the profusion of graves and tombstones scattered around the cemetery today. The large rectangular chamber (or Grand Chamber) on the southern side of Muhammad al-Shaykh's and Lalla Mas'uda's mausoleum was filled with other tombs. The Chamber of the Mihrab, the southern chamber of Ahmad al-Mansur's construction which was intended to be used merely as a prayer room, was used as a mausoleum by the 'Alawi dynasty up until at least the late 18th century. It is now filled entirely with the graves of 'Alawi family members. One of these graves is reputedly that of the 'Alawi sultan Moulay al-Yazid (died 1792), which was previously marked off by a wooden balustrade and which was sometimes visited by local pilgrims. Moulay al-Yazid's name is now also associated with the Kasbah Mosque and with the square in front of it. In total, the necropolis now contains 56 tombstones marked with mqabriyas (ornate marble epitaphs) and another hundred or so tombs marked simply with multicolored tiles.

Modern times
Eventually, the necropolis was isolated from the surrounding streets and fell out of use. In 1917 they were "rediscovered" by the Service des Beaux-Arts, Antiquités et Monuments historiques ("Service of Fine Arts, Antiquities, and Historic Monuments") of Morocco, an official body created in 1912 with the beginning of the French Protectorate over Morocco. By then, the tombs were in state of severe disrepair, and from 1917 onward the Service carried out a careful restoration process. Missing parts of the decoration were restored by using surviving parts as a model. The work also opened up the site to the general public for the first time. From the 1920s onward the tombs became the object of study by scholars. Today, they have become a major tourist attraction in Marrakesh.
During the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco, the tombs suffered damage. The most serious damage was found in the structures that adjoined the site and the Kasbah Mosque, rather than in the tombs themselves. An early assessment found significant cracks in the walls and towers surrounding the enclosure, partial collapses around the site's entrance, some damage to the roof tiles of the eastern mausoleum (of Lalla Mas'uda), and damage to the stucco decoration of the western mausoleum (the Chamber of the Mihrab and the Chamber of Twelve Columns). The site was subsequently closed for repairs and was reopened to visitors in October 2023.

Architecture and layout
The necropolis is a large garden cemetery enclosed by a rampart to the south and by the wall of the Kasbah Mosque to the north. Inside this are two main buildings: one on the western edge of the cemetery (on the left as visitors enter) and the other further east, surrounded by the cemetery gardens. The gardens are filled with graves covered by colourful tiles.
The mausoleums are constructed in the Moorish or western Islamic style that developed in this region over the previous centuries. The decorative techniques seen in the buildings of the preceding Marinid and Nasrid dynasties – who ruled in Morocco and al-Andalus (southern Spain), respectively – are repeated here.

The eastern mausoleum
The eastern building of the necropolis is the older of the two main buildings in the necropolis. It is often referred to as the Qubba of Lalla Mas'uda (qubba being an Arabic word for a mausoleum, usually domed). It consists of a small central square chamber (the so-called Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda), two rectangular loggia rooms on either side to the east and west, and a large rectangular chamber to the south (the so-called Grand Chamber) which connects directly to all three. In addition to the two loggias which open onto the gardens, there is an opening (a door or a former window) on the southern side of the large southern chamber. This unusual and almost symmetrical layout is believed to be the result of at least two different construction phases: a square mausoleum originally erected over the tomb of Muhammad al-Shaykh by Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib and an expansion by Ahmad al-Mansur which added the other chambers around it (see history section above). The bulk of the building is built in brick. The decoration, also believed to be from al-Mansur's time, is of high quality throughout, even though some scholars believe the decoration was left unfinished when Ahmad al-Mansur stopped working on this building and began constructing the western mausoleum.

The Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda
The central chamber is also sometimes referred to as the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda. It is believed to be the oldest structure in the necropolis, a relatively small mausoleum erected by Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib between 1557 and 1574 over the tomb of his father, Muhammad al-Shaykh, the founder of the dynasty. Today it contains the tomb of Muhammad al-Shaykh, Lalla Mas'uda (a wife of al-Shaykh and mother of Ahmad al-Mansur), al-Ghalib himself, and possibly also Sultan Abd al-Malik (another son of al-Shaykh who ruled between 1576 and 1578).

The chamber is square, measuring 4 meters per side. The chamber is covered by a vault of very fine and intricate muqarnas (honeycomb or stalactite-like sculpting) made of stucco which retains a part of its polychrome painting in blue and gold (among other colours). The surfaces of the tiny niches in the muqarnas composition alternate between plain surfaces and surfaces carved with Moroccan/Andalusi arabesque motifs. The upper walls of the chamber are covered in intricate stucco decoration as well, in the form of arabesque and geometric compositions, while the lower walls are covered in zellij tile mosaics with geometric star patterns. Between these two parts are bands of Arabic inscriptions in both stucco and tilework. The floor is also covered in zellij paving (although in generally simpler motifs). On the chamber's northern side is a niche, resembling a mihrab, covered by its own canopy of muqarnas. This niche contains the tomb of Lalla Mas'uda. On the lower western wall of the niche is a carved marble panel with a dedicatory text to Lalla Mas'uda. The panel is the best preserved piece of its kind in the whole necropolis, thanks in part to the fact that it was originally protected by wooden shutters. In addition to its rich carvings, it retains hints of former red paint.

The Grand Chamber
Lalla Masu'da's chamber connects to the large rectangular chamber to the south through a doorway crowned by an intricate stucco arch with muqarnas intrados (inner surfaces of the arch), which in turn is surrounded by some of the highest-quality stucco carving. The upper walls of this chamber are mostly bare but the lower walls feature zellij tilework with even more complex 16-sided star patterns. The chamber is covered by a berchla roof (a Moroccan wooden framework ceiling with particular stylistic geometric arrangements) with remnants of its former colours. The floor is covered in tilework again along with various tombs. The chamber measures 10 by 6 meters.

The loggias
On either side of the mausoleum are small rectangular chambers (4 by 2 meters) that open to the outside through richly decorated loggias.  The eastern loggia room has doorways opening onto both the central mausoleum chamber (via another intricate archway) and the southern Grand Chamber, while the western loggia connects only to the southern chamber. The loggias are triple-arched: a cedar wood canopy forms an arch resting on stucco-carved pillars that in turn rest on marble columns, with smaller muqarnas-carved arches crossing the space between the columns and the main walls of the structure. The wooden canopies feature a band carved with cartouches of Arabic calligraphy featuring a Qur'anic verse from the Surah al-Ahzab. The stucco carvings are again very fine and feature a variety of motifs. A band of stucco featuring a star-like pattern runs around the rest of the building on the outside, just below the wooden roof.

The western mausoleum
The western mausoleum building is divided into three chambers: the Chamber of the Mihrab, the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, and the Chamber of the Three Niches. It is believed to date entirely from the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, though it contains many tombs from after his time as well.

Chamber of the Mihrab
The southernmost chamber was intended to be a small mosque or prayer room, which is why it features a mihrab on its south/southeast wall. In Islamic architecture the mihrab is a niche or alcove symbolizing the qibla (the direction of prayer). The mihrab here resembles that of the Ben Youssef Madrasa (also Saadian in origin): a horseshoe arch surrounded by elaborate stucco decoration and hiding a small muqarnas cupola inside. The decoration of the lower parts of the mihrab, however, appears to have been left unfinished: the outlines of a pattern have been traced but they have not been filled-in and carved. This is believed to be due to Ahmad al-Mansur dying before the decoration was completely finished and his successors lacking the will or the resources to finish it. A total of 8 engaged columns, made out of veined marble, are arranged around the base of the mihrab. The rest of the chamber is a large rectangular space marked by four columns supporting arches. The columns and the arches split the upper space of the chamber into 9 rectangular areas, with each division having its own wooden ceiling with star patterns. The ceiling in front of the mihrab, however, is different and instead features a large pyramid-shaped vault of intricate muqarnas (similar in style to the ceiling of the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda). Since the vault has a square outline, it transitions into the rectangular space with two more sloped surfaces of muqarnas on either side.

This mosque chamber was originally the only entrance into the building. The central mausoleum of al-Mansur (the Chamber of Twelve Columns) is entered via another ornate muqarnas archway directly opposite the mihrab. Nowadays, however, the floor of the chamber is covered with the tombs of family members of the 'Alawi dynasty, as well as, reputedly, the tomb of the 'Alawi sultan Moulay al-Yazid. As a result, visitors are generally not allowed to walk inside.

Chamber of the Twelve Columns (Mausoleum of Ahmad al-Mansur)
This is the grand mausoleum chamber of Ahmad al-Mansur and the most richly decorated chamber in the entire necropolis, generally considered the highlight of the complex. Its layout follows a previously established plan seen at the Mausoleum of Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali in Marrakech (built by Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib) and in the remains of the rawda cemetery at the Alhambra of Granada. The chamber is square, measuring 10 meters per side and rising 12 meters high. A slightly smaller square is formed within the chamber by the twelve columns of Carrara marble symmetrically arranged in groups of three around the center of the room. The capitals of the marble columns have simple profiles but are covered in high-relief vegetal or arabesque carvings.  What is more exceptional is that each group of three columns supports two small muqarnas arches which are also made out of marble (instead of the usual wood or stucco) and yet appear as intricately carved as the other elements in the room. The space between the column groups is spanned by wider muqarnas arches carved in stucco, but the consoles or corbels on which their bases rest are also made out of marble. Overall, the craftsmen who built the chamber took great care to make the transition from marble to stucco nearly imperceptible, so that the two highly different materials seem to blend naturally together. The use of red paint to highlight the stucco forms is still visible in many areas.
The elaborate cedar wood ceilings of the chamber are also high achievements of Moroccan and Saadian art. Because of the square-within-a-square layout and the arches springing from the corners of the inner square, there is one large ceiling in the center and eight smaller square and rectangular ceilings around it. The central wood-frame ceiling is shaped like a square dome or cupola and is covered in a star pattern. Both the shape and the pattern are similar to, but less extensive than, the famous ceiling of the Hall of Ambassadors in the Alhambra palace. Below the cupola itself is a transitional zone of wood-carved muqarnas, and below this are two bands of painted decoration with arabesque motifs and Arabic calligraphic inscriptions. The rectangular ceilings along the sides of the chamber are flat but feature more geometric motifs as well as miniature cupolas of muqarnas. Lastly, the smaller square ceilings in the corners of the chamber are full muqarnas cupolas. The upper bands of wood running just below the ceilings here are also decorated with arch motifs as well as Kufic Arabic motifs. The ceilings are all painted in predominantly red and gold colours, still preserved today.
The surfaces of the chamber walls are covered in carved stucco as well as the more usual zellij tiling along their lower parts. At the very center of the room is the tombstone of Ahmad al-Mansur. To his immediate right (from the perspective of present-day visitors seeing the room) is the tombstone of his son, Sultan Moulay Zidan (died 1627), and to his immediate left is the tombstone of Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Saghir (died 1654–55). Also in this room are the tombs of al-Mansur's wife, Lalla Aisha as-Shabaniyya (died 1623) and of Sultan Abd al-Malik II (died 1631). All of their tombstones, of a type called a mqabriya, consist of an elongated marble bloc carved with Arabic epitaphs on arabesque backgrounds. The mqabriyas of these five Saadians are particularly large and ornate, and are believed to have been made by the same workshop of artisans. The lesser tombstones of other dynasty members are scattered around the room. Curiously, the marble inscription plaque embedded in the back wall of the chamber is dedicated to Muhammad al-Shaykh (who is buried in the other mausoleum across the gardens to the east), and was apparently moved here from his tombstone in the eastern mausoleum. Why or when it was moved here is unknown.
Today, since the original entrance via the Chamber of the Mihrab is off-limits, visitors enter to the edge of the chamber via an opening in the eastern wall of the mausoleum, directly from the outside. This opening was originally only a window, similar to windows found in the outer walls of other shrines in Morocco where Muslim pedestrians on the street are able to offer prayers or gifts to the deceased without having to enter the sanctuary.

Chamber of the Three Niches
The Chamber of the Three Niches is an annex to the main mausoleum chamber and houses more tombs, including an epitaph attesting to the first (temporary) burial of the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan in 1341 (presumably transferred here after the Saadian construction). Another marble inscription plaque, this time belonging to Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, is embedded in one of the walls of the chamber here. Once again, it is unknown why or when this plaque was moved from its original location (at the head of Abdallah's tomb in the eastern mausoleum) to here.
The chamber is accessed from the Chamber of the Twelve Columns via two side openings in the northern wall of the latter. The layout of the chamber is simpler and its ceilings are also less elaborate. However, its walls are covered in some of the most intricate stucco carvings of the complex, featuring a variety of arabesque, geometric, and epigraphic/calligraphic motifs.

Notable burials
The following individuals are buried in the necropolis. As the necropolis contains well over a hundred graves of varying importance, this list is only partial. Some individuals are believed to be buried here due to some historical evidence, but their tombs have not always been clearly identified (noted as "unconfirmed" below).
Eastern mausoleum:

Muhammad al-Shaykh (d. 1557): first Saadian sultan to rule a unified Morocco, after defeating the Wattasid dynasty.
Abdallah al-Ghalib (d. 1574): second sultan, son of Muhammad al-Shaykh, fought the Ottomans in Wadi Al-Laban.
Abd al-Malik I (unconfirmed, d. 1578): fourth sultan, son of Muhammad al-Shaykh, fought the Portuguese in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir.
Lalla Mas'uda (d. 1591): political figure, mother of Ahmad al-Mansur.
Western mausoleum:

Ahmad al-Mansur (d. 1603): fifth sultan, longest-reigning Saadian, son of Muhammad ash-Shaykh, defeated the Songhai Empire and expanded south forming the Pashalik of Timbuktu.
Lalla Aisha as-Shabaniyya (d. 1623): a wife of Ahmad al-Mansur and mother of Moulay Zidan.
Moulay Zidan (d. 1627): son of Ahmad al-Mansur, ruler of Marrakesh during most of the succession war (1603–1627).
Abd al-Malik II (d. 1631): first ruler of unified Saadian realm after the succession war, son of Moulay Zidan.
Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Saghir (d. 1655): longest-reigning sultan after the succession war, son of Moulay Zidan.
Chamber of the Mihrab (attached to western mausoleum):

Moulay al-Yazid (unconfirmed, d. 1792): Nineteenth 'Alawi sultan, son of Mohammed III.

Influence and legacy
Scholars generally view the design and decoration of the Saadian Tombs as strongly and clearly embedded in the artistic traditions of earlier Andalusi and Moroccan architecture (or "Hispano-Moorish" art). Some, such as Georges Marçais, even refer to Saadian art more generally as a "renaissance" of this style, before its relative decline in the following centuries. In addition to the use and continued elaboration of decorative techniques from the Marinid era of Morocco, the Saadian Tombs also suggest an influence from Nasrid antecedents in Granada, Spain. The layout of the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, for example, is similar to the layout of the rawda mausoleum in the Alhambra and was later repeated in the Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il in Meknes during the 'Alawi period. Other Nasrid influences in Saadian architecture include the two ornamental ablutions pavilions which Ahmad al-Mansur and Abdallah al-Ghalib II added to the courtyard of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes, which strongly resemble the two pavilions in the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra.
The Saadian Tombs are frequently regarded as the high benchmark of Moroccan art and architecture in the Saadian period and in the post-medieval period generally, thanks to its extremely rich decoration and its "rational" arrangement of interior space. Shortly after they were "rediscovered" and made accessible to the public by French colonial authorities in 1917, they were praised by many contemporary art historians and observers who visited them. At the same time, many (Western) scholars still view the Saadian period as the beginning of a decline or of a "conservative" period in Moroccan art and architecture, during which existing styles were faithfully reproduced and imitated but few innovations were introduced.

Aït Benhaddou (Arabic: آيت بن حدّو) is a historic ighrem or ksar (fortified village) along the former caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakesh in Morocco. It is considered a great example of Moroccan earthen clay architecture and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

History
The site of the ksar has been fortified since the 11th century during the Almoravid period. None of the current buildings are believed to date from before the 17th century, but they were likely built with the same construction methods and designs as had been used for centuries before. The site's strategic importance was due to its location in the Ounila Valley along one of the main trans-Saharan trade routes. The Tizi n'Tichka pass, which was reached via this route, was one of the few routes across the Atlas Mountains, crossing between Marrakech and the Dra'a Valley on the edge of the Sahara. Other kasbahs and ksour were located all along this route, such as the nearby Tamdaght to the north.
Today, the ksar itself is only sparsely inhabited by several families. The depopulation over time is a result of the valley's loss of strategic importance in the 20th century. Most local inhabitants now live in modern dwellings in the village on the other side of the river, and make a living off agriculture and especially off the tourist trade. In 2011 a new pedestrian bridge was completed linking the old ksar with the modern village, with the aim of making the ksar more accessible and to potentially encourage inhabitants to move back into its historic houses.
The site was damaged by the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco. An early assessment of the damage reported cracks and partial collapses, with risk of further collapses.

Description
Layout of the site
The ksar is located on the slopes of a hill next to the Ounila River (Asif Ounila). The village's buildings are grouped together within a defensive wall that includes corner towers and a gate. They include dwellings of various size ranging from modest houses to tall structures with towers. Some of the buildings are decorated in their upper parts with geometric motifs. The village also has a number of public or community buildings such as a mosque, a caravanserai, multiple kasbahs (castle-like fortification) and the Marabout of Sidi Ali or Amer. At the top of the hill, overlooking the ksar, are the remains of a large fortified granary (agadir). There is also a public square, a Muslim cemetery, and a Jewish cemetery. Outside the ksar's walls was an area where grain was grown and threshed.

Building materials
The ksar's structures are made entirely out of rammed earth, adobe, clay bricks, and wood. Rammed earth (also known as pisé, tabia, or al-luh) was a highly practical and cost-effective material but required constant maintenance. It was made of compressed earth and mud, usually mixed with other materials to aid adhesion. The structures of Ait Benhaddou and of other kasbahs and ksour throughout this region of Morocco typically employed a mixture of earth and straw, which was relatively permeable and easily eroded by rain over time. As a result, villages of this type can begin to crumble only a few decades after being abandoned. At Ait Benhaddou, taller structures were made of rammed earth up to their first floor while the upper floors were made of lighter adobe so as to reduce the load of the walls.

Preservation
The ksar has been significantly restored in modern times, thanks in part to its use as a Hollywood filming location and to its inscription on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1987. UNESCO reports that the ksar has "preserved its architectural authenticity with regard to configuration and materials" by continuing to use traditional construction materials and techniques and by largely avoiding new concrete constructions. A local committee is in charge of monitoring and managing the site.

Films shot at Aït Benhaddou
A large number of films shot in Morocco have used Aït Benhaddou as a location, including:

Aït Benhaddou was also used in parts of the TV series Game of Thrones, the Brazilian TV series O Clone, The Amazing Race Australia 6 and Outer Banks.

Le ksar d'Aït-ben-Haddou (en chleuh : ⴰⵢⵜ ⵃⴰⴷⴷⵓ, en arabe : آيت بن حدّو) est un ksar (Ighrem, en chleuh) au Maroc, situé dans la province de Ouarzazate. Il est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.
Pendant le protectorat français, le ksar était surnommé « le Mont-saint-Michel des Chleuhs ».

Situation
Aït-ben-Haddou est situé à 30 km de Ouarzazate, dans la vallée de l’Ounila, au sud de Télouet, fief du Glaoui, vallée qui était un point de passage traditionnel des caravanes reliant Marrakech au sud du Sahara.

Architecture
C’est un exemple frappant de l'architecture du sud marocain traditionnel, sur le flanc d’une colline au sommet de laquelle se trouve un grenier collectif (un agadir).
Le village se présente comme un ensemble de bâtiments de terre entourés de murailles, le ksar, qui est un type d'habitat traditionnel présaharien. Les maisons se regroupent à l'intérieur de ses murs défensifs renforcés par des tours d'angle. Certaines de ses habitations semblent être de petits châteaux avec leurs hautes tours décorées de motifs en brique crue. Les plus anciennes constructions dateraient du XVIIe siècle. Le site aurait d'ailleurs été l'un des nombreux comptoirs de la route commerciale qui reliait l'Afrique saharienne à Marrakech - on peut encore y voir un fondouk (caravansérail).
Tout autour de ce douar un ensemble de villages se regroupe. Au pied de la colline coule l'oued Maleh, dont le nom signifie « rivière salée ». L'eau est impropre à la consommation car très chargée en sel.
Les habitants de ces douars sont pour la plupart des berbères anciennement nomades qui ont ensuite choisi la sédentarité pour des raisons diverses.

Matériaux de construction
Les bâtisses du ksar sont entièrement construites en pisé, avec des planchers en bois. Le pisé (en arabe: al-louh اللوح) se présente comme un matériau très pratique et rentable, mais nécessitant un entretien permanent. Il se compose de terre compressée et d'argile, généralement mélangées à d'autres matériaux favorisant l'adhérence.

Site du patrimoine mondial
Le ksar d'Aït-ben-Haddou est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1987. Son inscription repose sur les criteres (iv) et (v).

Éponyme
Amghar Ben Haddou, ancien chef du village et dont l'éponyme fut donné au lieu par la suite, habitait l'emplacement du ksar dès l'époque des Almoravides (XIe siècle) pour le gouverner.

Plateau de tournage
Plusieurs films et séries TV y ont été tournés parmi lesquels  :

Ali Baba et les Quarante Voleurs (1954)
Lawrence d'Arabie (1962)

## Understand
Aït-Benhaddou is a traditional mud brick city on the edge of the High Atlas Mountains. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and has been featured in many films, mostly as a stand-in for Jerusalem. It has appeared in more than 10 films, including Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.
Overnighting in Aït Benhaddou is recommendable as you get to see the Ksar in different lighting conditions. It looks very different in the morning when sun rises or when the sun is just setting.

## Get in
Aït Benhaddou is accessible from Ouarzazate and Marrakesh.

## By bus
Most buses do not go directly to Aït Benhaddou but can drop you off at the turn off about 7 km away from where you will have to find a lift. Or, you can get dropped off a little earlier at Tadoula, from where you can walk through the desert for about 5 km.

## By taxi
A grand taxi seat from Ouarzazate costs 20 dirham (as of 2023). From or to the junction at the highway, it is 10 dirham.
Or, you arrange a private hire of a taxi for the trip. During the daytime, grand taxis are always waiting at the crossing.
From Marrakesh it will be a full day trip and thus a private tour might not be a bad idea.

## By car
Aït Benhaddou is 9 km off the main Tizi n Tichka road, which links Ouarzazate to Marrakech. Coming from Ouarzazate, turn to the right after about 18 km from the town. It's quite a scenic drive to Aït Benhaddou. On the way into town there is a slight turn to the right, which is a popular spot for great views over the town and the Kasbah.

## Get around
Once inside the Ksar you can only walk or climb. There are two main entrances into the Ksar. One can be reached by new bridge. To reach the second, it is necessary to cross the river using the stepping stones (in dry season the river is completely dry).

## See
The town itself is the main attraction, with mud buildings climbing up the side of the hill.
31.05-7.1333331 Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou.   (updated Dec 2023)
31.04693-7.129082 Granary (at the top of the hill). Impressive and well worth the effort to get up there. Free.
Mausoleum of Ben-Haddou (is at the base of the hill).
Koranic School. (updated Mar 2020)

## Do
Climb to the top the hill for breathtaking views.
Rent a bike and drive up the road to Telouet (~50 km). It was paved a few years ago but traffic is still scarce.

## Buy
There are several shops within the town that sell souvenirs from all over the Sahara, particularly prevalent are models of the Ksar and wooden artifacts from the Dogon people in Mali.
There is a very friendly carpet shop in the newer part of town near the post office.

## Eat
Hotel la Baraka (in the newer part of town). has a restaurant with a nice courtyard.

## Sleep

Ouarzazate (; Berber languages: ⵡⴰⵔⵣⴰⵣⴰⵜ Arabic: ورزازات, romanized: Warzāzāt, IPA: [warzaːˈzaːt]) is a city and capital of Ouarzazate Province in the region of Drâa-Tafilalet, south-central Morocco. 
Ouarzazate is a primary tourist destination in Morocco during the holidays, as well as a starting point for excursions into and across the Draa Valley and the desert. The fortified village Aït Benhaddou west of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The Ouarzazate area is a noted film-making location, with Morocco's biggest studios inviting many international companies to work here. Films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Living Daylights (1987), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), Gladiator (2000), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Kundun (1997), Legionnaire (1998), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011) and The Wages of Fear (2024) were shot here, as was part of the TV series Game of Thrones. It was the filming location for the fictional city of Agapenta in the fourth season of the Netflix series Outer Banks.

Etymology
Its name comes from a Berber phrase meaning "without noise" or "without confusion".

History
For a long time, Ouarzazate was a small crossing point for African traders on their way to northern Morocco and Europe. In the 16th century, Sheikh Abu al-'Abaas Ahmed bin Abdellah al-Wizkiti al-Warzazi, emir of the qasba of Ouarzazate and father of Lalla Masuda, helped establish Saadi control over the Sous-Dra'a region. 

Ouarzazate was home to a thriving Jewish community. In 1954, about 170 Jews lived in the Mellah. The "Old Synagogue", a synagogue said to be nearly 300 years old, is located in Ouarzazate. There is also a Jewish cemetery, which is no longer in use.
During the French period, Ouarzazate expanded considerably as a garrison town, administrative centre and customs post and a church (Eglise Saint Therese) was built in 1931. It is home to the Kasbah Taourirt, which was the kasbah of the former caïd and later owned by T'hami El Glaoui. The Krupp field gun which secured Glaoui power is displayed outside the kasbah today. 
The city was part of the route of the 2006 and 2007 Dakar Rally.
The nearby Ouarzazate solar power station, co-funded by the Arab League, was connected to the Moroccan power grid in February 2016.
On 1 November 2023, Ouarzazate along with Casablanca joined UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network.

Geography
Ouarzazate is at an elevation of 1,151 metres (3,776 ft) in the middle of a bare plateau south of the High Atlas Mountains, with a desert to the city's south.

Climate
Ouarzazate has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh). The city is hot and dry in summer, but can be very cold in winter, with icy winds coming from the High Atlas Mountains.

Landmarks
The Kasbah Taourirt is the city's historic kasbah (fortified residence, or tighremt in Berber languages). It was owned and expanded by the Glaoui family in the late 19th century and the 20th century. Built mainly of rammed earth, it is one of the most impressive examples of this type of structure, which characterizes the architecture of the predominantly Berber-inhabited Atlas mountain and oasis regions of Morocco.

A short distance west of the city is Aït Benhaddou, a historic ksar (fortified village) and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Film industry
Film is a major industry in Ouarazazate and constitute a major part of its economy. Its success is due to the presence of desert landscapes and historical architecture, the availability of trained technicians, low productions costs, and Morocco's streamlined process for obtaining film permits. Most productions are from the USA or Western Europe, but the number of Indian and Chinese productions has also increased in recent years. According to a study published in 2020, about 20 to 50 foreign film and television productions are shot in Ouarzazate every year. In 2017, the heads of Moroccan film studios claimed that about 80 percent of staff used on film productions were Moroccan.
Atlas Studios is the largest movie studios in the world in terms of land area. It was established in 1983. Movies were shot here including The Living Daylights, Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, Lawrence of Arabia, The Man Who Would Be King, The Mummy, Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, Hanna, and Babel. It was also the location of an episode of the television series The Amazing Race 10 and Game of Thrones season 3. Prison Break season 5 was filmed here.
Another large studio in Ouarzazate is CLA Studios, established in 2004.
The Cinema Museum, located across from the Kasbah Taourirt, opened in 2007 and is housed in a former film studio. The museum displays film sets, props, and technical equipment from previous productions.

Ouarzazate (en Tachelhit : ⵡⴰⵔⵣⴰⵣⴰⵜ; en arabe : ورزازات) est une ville et commune — municipalité — de la province de Ouarzazate (Maroc), dont elle est le chef-lieu, dans la région Drâa Tafilalet. La ville est surnommée « la Porte du désert ».

Géographie
Située à 1 150 mètres d'altitude, à la confluence des oueds Dadès et Imini formant le Drâa, elle est le principal centre urbain de la vallée de ce fleuve.
La ville se situe sur le piémont sud du Haut-Atlas central, dominée à l'ouest par le massif du Toubkal et au nord-est par celui du M'goun, culminant tous deux à plus de 4000 m. Elle est au carrefour des voies la reliant au nord-ouest à Marrakech par les cols du Haut-Atlas dont le Tizi n'Tichka; à l'est au Tafilalet; au sud à la moyenne vallée du Drâa, et au delà au désert saharien; et enfin à l'ouest vers la vallée du Souss et la cote atlantique, en contournant le massif du djebel Siroua.
L’agglomération du Grand-Ouarzazate se prolonge du côté Sud de l’oued par le village de Tabount — parfois appelé « Ouarzazate-Sud » — qui fait partie, comme la kasbah de Tifoultoute, de la commune rurale de Tarmigt.

Climat
Ouarzazate bénéficie d'un climat désertique chaud (Classification de Köppen BWh) avec influence continentale. Le climat y est pré-saharien, mais avec des nuances montagnardes étant donné l'altitude. Ainsi, le climat n'y est pas aussi sec et aussi chaud que le climat saharien typique. Ouarzazate reçoit environ 112 mm de précipitations, dont la majorité tombe en automne et en hiver. En été, les températures moyennes maximales sont autour 37 °C en plein été. En revanche, les hivers sont assez froids, surtout la nuit. Les températures peuvent facilement descendre en dessous de zéro entre décembre et février, à cause de la proximité conjointe de la côte atlantique et du Haut Atlas.

Population
La grande majorité de la population est d'origine Chleuh rurale des contrées environnantes, comme en témoignent les langues vernaculaires utilisées, 92,7 % de berbérophones en 2014. La ville de Ouarzazate est à la frontière linguistique entre zones parlant le Tachelhit : 92,7 % parlant Tachelhit. Seulement 10 % de la population ne parle pas l'arabe darija.
Le taux de scolarisation des enfants de 7 à 12 ans est de 98,6 %, ce qui n'a pas été le cas dans les générations plus âgées puisque 16,8 % de la population n'est pas alphabétisée, selon le recensement de 2014[réf. nécessaire].

Histoire
Le site de la ville de Ouarzazate garde des traces d'une occupation humaine dès la préhistoire. En effet des outils de pierre taillée datant du paléolithique, de type hachereaux de l'Acheuléen marocain y ont été découverts.
Les Chleuh sont les habitants majoritaires de cette région, ainsi que des juifs et des haratines descendants des premières populations mêlées ultérieurement à des esclaves sub-sahariens.
La région de Ouarzazate a été longtemps un lieu de passage entre les royaumes sub-sahariens et les anciennes villes marocaines de Marrakech et Aghmat, via les cités de la vallée du Drâa ou Sijilmassa. La première mention du nom de "Ouarzazat" se trouve dans "La description de l'Afrique septentrionale" d'Al-Bakri au XIe siècle, dans sa description de l'itinéraire de Sijilmassa vers Aghmat.
Au Moyen Âge, la région a été islamisée par Oqba Ibn Nafia, en 681 (an 62 de l'hégire). À partir du milieu du VIIIe siècle, l'extension de la révolte kharijite et l'apparition des Idrissides au Maroc (opposants à l'autorité des khalifats de Damas) poussèrent à la fondation de Sijilmassa dans le Tafilelt. Ce qui entraîna la décadence des anciennes villes de Todgha et de Ziz en faveur de la Province de Ouarzazate.
Dès la seconde moitié du XIIIe siècle, les Arabes Maâquils se sont infiltrés dans toutes les provinces du Sud Marocain à l'exception des zones montagneuses.
À l'époque saâdienne, la région revit encore et connut un essor économique et culturel favorisé par le développement de fructueux échanges commerciaux transsahariens surtout après l'expédition organisée par le Sultan El Mansour vers Tombouctou. Ce commerce passe par les cités de la vallée du Draa et l'oasis de Ouarzazate est un lieu de passage vers les cols de l'Atlas et Marrakech. Il n'existe alors pas encore de ville à Ouarzazate. Mais après la disparition d'El Mansour, le littoral atlantique devient la zone d’échanges privilégiée au détriment de la région de Ouarzazate qui connait une période de déclin.
Au XIXe siècle, après une période troublée, la région passe sous l'autorité des caïds glaouis de Telouet, nommés par les sultans alaouites. En 1884, Charles de Foucauld décrit l'oasis de Ouarzazate, qui comporte les Kasbahs de Tifoultout, Taourirt et Tamasla; ainsi qu'une douzaine de ksour dont Tamassint, Fedragoum, Tagheramt, Tassouma't, Zaouiat Sidi Othmane, Tabounte et Tazroute. Il n'y a alors qu'un seul souk à Zaouia Sidi Othmane, mais pas encore de vrai ville. Les juifs sont alors assez nombreux avec huit mellahs répartis dans les ksour de l'oasis. En 1893 le sultan Moulay Hassan entreprend depuis Fès une expédition vers le Tafilalet berceau de sa dynastie et le sud de l'Atlas pour affirmer son autorité. Il traverse au retour l'oasis de Ouarzazate et, selon le récit de son médecin, l'expédition ne longe que le ksar de Taourirt et les ruines d'une kasbah sur un mamelon à l'emplacement où sera construite Ouarzazate trente ans plus tard. Il fait étape dans la kasbah de Tifoultout.
Avec l'arrivée des troupes coloniales dans la région, une ville de garnison est fondée en 1928, Ouarzazate devient le centre administratif de la région du Drâa. Un terrain d'aviation, amorce de l'aéroport de Ouarzazate, est aménagé en 1926. Une route la relie à Marrakech en 1928 via le col du Tizi n'Tichka.
La construction du barrage El Mansour Eddahbi, entre 1972 et 1979, donne un nouveau souffle à l'économie de la région notamment dans le domaine de l'agriculture ; la retenue permet l'irrigation de la vallée du Drâa et une partie de l’alimentation en eau potable de Ouarzazate.

Démographie
Selon les recensements :

de 1994 à 2004, la population de Ouarzazate est passée de 39 203 à 56 616, respectivement répartis entre 6 012 et 10 767 ménages ;
en 2014, elle comprenait 71 067 habitants.
La population est assez jeune avec 29,3 % de la population âgée de moins de 15 ans. Cependant la natalité a nettement diminué avec un indice de fécondité de 2,5 en 2014 à Ouarzazate contre 5,9 en 1975 sur l'ensemble du Maroc

Économie
La ville de Ouarzazate connaît un essor sur les plans touristique et cinématographique. Ouarzazate possède un aéroport international et est accessible par la route depuis Marrakech (4 heures en car, 3 heures 30 en taxi) via le Tizi n'Tichka.
Le tourisme joue un rôle majeur avec plus de 400 000 nuitées hôtelière en 2014.
Le projet de la centrale solaire Noor a créé une nouvelle dynamique économique pour la ville en drainant d'importants investissements d'ici 2020.

Sites et monuments
La kasbah de Taourirt (Tighremt n Tawrirt en Tachelhit; Tifinagh : ⵜⵉⵖⵔⵎⵜ ⵏ ⵜⴰⵡⵔⵉⵔⵜ), symbole de la ville, elle est un patrimoine national. Jouxtant la médina, elle aurait été bâtie vers le milieu du XVIIIe siècle et a appartenu au Glaoui. Elle est représentée sur les nouveaux billets de 50 dirhams.

Activités cinématographiques
Elle est l'un des sites marocains les plus prisés par les réalisateurs venus du monde entier. Outre les paysages, l'un des atouts cinématographiques de ce lieu est la qualité de la lumière, avec un soleil brillant en moyenne 300 jours par an. Dans les années 1960, Ouarzazate commence à devenir un lieu de tournage très prisé des réalisateurs de péplums et assoit sa popularité avec la réalisation de Lawrence d'Arabie en 1962, tourné notamment sur le site d'Aït-ben-Haddou, petit village proche de Ouarzazate ayant par la suite été inscrit au patrimoine de l'humanité. Les décors des films sont réutilisés, laissés à l'abandon ou valorisés comme patrimoine touristique.
Ouarzazate abrite les studios de l'Atlas Corporation (créés en 1983) et un musée du cinéma, où sont exposées des reliques de décors et costumes ayant servi pour des films tournés à Ouarzazate, dont ceux de Kingdom of Heaven ou Kundun. En 2005, le roi Mohammed VI inaugure CLA Studios. La ville compte également depuis 2006 une école qui forme 500 élèves techniciens et une faculté qui donne des cours de comptabilité et de logistique. Le Maroc permet une réduction de 20 % d'impôts sur les tournages. Co-produire avec un opérateur marocain permet par ailleurs d'annuler la TVA sur les biens et les services. En 2007, un musée du cinéma y a ouvert, avec la prison du film Gladiator.
Liste de films, séries télévisées ou téléfilms tournés partiellement ou entièrement à Ouarzazate (les films sont listés par ordre chronologique, les années faisant référence à leur date de sortie) :

Gladiator 2 (2023)

« Ciné-tourisme »
L'impact mondial du cinéma permet une forme de tourisme spécifique lié à cette activité à la fois économique et artistique. Les sites géographiques associés à des productions ciné-culturelles ont ainsi un potentiel touristique qu'Ouarzazate essaie de mettre en valeur, sur plusieurs sites du Grand Ouarzazate : Ouarzazate mais aussi Aït-Ben-Haddou, Fint et Skoura. Ce type de tourisme permet en outre d'apporter des solutions aux périodes de chômage des figurants, artisans et techniciens locaux au travers d'animations liées aux films tournés dans la région.
On peut voir une reconstitution en pisé de la maison natale du 14e dalaï-lama sur le flanc d'une montagne de Ouarzazate, là où se trouve l'un des plus importants ateliers cinématographiques occidentaux : il s'agit d'un des décors du film Kundun (1997), tourné par Martin Scorsese.

Centrale solaire Noor
Dans le cadre du plan solaire marocain, l’Agence marocaine de l'énergie solaire (MASEN) est le maître d'ouvrage pour la construction, près de Ouarzazate, d'une centrale solaire thermodynamique, dont le premier volet, Noor Ouarzazate I de 160 MW est entré en service en février 2016. Celle-ci, première centrale de ce futur complexe solaire, a été inaugurée le 4 février 2016 par le roi [Mohammed VI]. Il a aussi lancé le début des travaux de la deuxième phase du projet, Noor Ouarzazate II, lors de cette inauguration. Le consortium adjudicataire a été désigné en septembre 2012, après un appel d'offres international. Il est constitué des entreprises ACWA (Arabie Saoudite), Aries Ingenieria y Sistema (Espagne), TSK (Espagne) qui ont commencé la construction. Pour la seconde étape (Noor Ouarzazate II et Noor Ouarzazate III), un nouvel appel d'offres a été lancé et des entreprises ont été pré-qualifiées pour la finale. La troisième phase (Noor IV) a aussi fait l'objet d'un appel d'offres international et utilise la technologie photovoltaïque.

## Overview
Ouarzazate (ورزازات) is a city in Morocco and the largest town in the Saharan Morocco.

## Understand
Ouarzazate is relatively small (60 000 inhabitants) and for Morocco quiet town, which can be very refreshing coming from a city like Fez, Meknes or Marrakech. You will barely be hassled here and can walk freely and enjoy the streets. It is thus no wonder that its name comes from a Berber phrase meaning "without noise" or "without confusion".
At an elevation of 1,135 m, built mostly along main street - Avenue Muhammed V. Once in its history, Ouarzazate had been a crossing point for African traders seeking to reach northern cities in Morocco and Europe. During the French period, Ouarzazate expanded considerably as a garrison town and administrative centre.

## By bus
From Agadir twice daily by CTM at 09:00 & 23:30, 6½ hours, 135-185 dirham. There are also other companies running this route, but no Supratours.
From Marrakesh there are six CTM buses a day, 4½ hours, along with three local buses. A place in a grand taxi is around 120 dirham per person.
From the desert towns. From Mhamid and Errachidia one per day each by CTM, 5 hours. From Merzouga there is a daily Supratours bus at 07:30, 8 hours.
Buses can be badly delayed en-route, besides the buses always take a long lunch break.
There are two bus stations: the "Gare Routière" where grand taxis and local buses leave from and the "CTM Gare Voyage" in the center of town.
30.92066-6.911321 CTM Gare Voyage.    (updated May 2019)
30.92565-6.929062 Gare Routière.    (updated May 2019)

## By plane
As of 2023, there are domestic flights to Casablanca, Zagora (Royal Air Maroc) and Tangier (RyanAir); and international ones to Paris (Transavia), Marseille, Barcelona and London (Ryanair).
30.939167-6.9094443 The airport (IATA: OZZ) (right in the outskirts of the city). There is a small cafe MS HAK inside.   (updated Dec 2023)

## Get around
The area around Mohammad V is very walkable. The CTM station is there as well. Petits taxis for within the city (no more than 10 dirham from the airport to the hotel), grands taxis for between cities (no more than 150 dirham to Ait Benhaddou and back, though you can probably get it lower), including to Ait Benhaddou and surrounding kasbahs.
For those traveling by car, note kerb colors: red and white means no parking, green and white means OK to park.

## Stay safe
Ouarzazate is very safe, but don't wander into weird corners at night. Crime throughout the Moroccan south is minimal, but it's best not to take (too many) chances.

## See
30.920124-6.8994341 Kasbah Taourirt. A well preserved kasbah inside of the city with a constant exhibition of various artists inside. It is like a little labyrinth, exploring all the rooms and hallways. Sometimes you can sneak in with another group of tourists. 20 dirham.      (updated May 2019)
30.921252-6.8996162 Musée du Cinéma. Not that exciting and many items are not marked or signed, but a good alternative if you do not want to head out of the city to the other museums/studios. 30 dirham.    (updated May 2019)
30.919493-6.897973 Bet Knesset Synagogue. Former synagogue turned into some kind of museum. Rooms filled with items, but almost no descriptions. Guided tour only. Admission is "voluntary".

## Outside of town
31.05-7.1333334 Aït-Benhaddou (15 dirham by grand taxi from nearby Gare Routière, a taxi for your own is 300 dirham or 220 dirham after some serious haggle). One of the best preserved Kasbahs. It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Very picturesque place, lots of movies were shot there (Gladiator). 20 dirham (updated 2023) to visit kasbahs. You don't need a guide, but locals will follow you pretending to help and at the end will ask for money. See more information in the specific article. Be careful not to get too wet from the river when crossing it, since there's been reports of schistosomiasis contracted from the water.   (updated May 2019)
30.820962-6.9497395 Oasis de Fint (150 dirham (return) by grand taxi, they will suggest 300 first, but are happy to do something else than waiting. Or rent a bicycle in Tabount for 120 dirham for whole day (updated 2023).).

Er Rachida – A mid-sized administrative town which can be a good launching pad for Merzouga and the desert. There is a bus line which runs from Ouarzazate. Touts will join the bus at stops along the way and try to lever you into going on a 'discounted' desert tour. They are persistent and will ask you about yourself. Claiming to be a 'veteran' of Saharan travel (perhaps more convincing if you can speak French) and already booked into a hotel at your destination may help convince them to let you be.
Valley of Dadès – Local agencies offer trips to this place in the mountain. Be prepared to negotiate hard; otherwise, they will rip you off. Plan a full day tour by 4WD jeep. Make a shortcut off-road in order to avoid a part of the paved N10. The views are spectacular and you have a great chance to meet shepherds (often young girls) with their herd. In the area are many Kasbahs, some inhabited, some abandoned. Don't be surprised if you see a for-sale sign on an abandoned Kasbah.

Volubilis (Latin pronunciation: [wɔˈɫuːbɪlɪs]; Arabic: وليلي, romanized: walīlī; Berber languages: ⵡⵍⵉⵍⵉ, romanized: wlili) is a partly excavated Berber-Roman city in Morocco, situated near the city of Meknes, that may have been the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania, at least from the time of King Juba II. Before Volubilis, the capital of the kingdom may have been at Gilda.
Built in a fertile agricultural area, it developed from the 3rd century BC onward as a Berber, then proto-Carthaginian, settlement before being the capital of the kingdom of Mauretania. It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about 42 hectares (100 acres) with a 2.6 km (1.6 mi) circuit of walls. The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century, including a basilica, temple and triumphal arch. Its prosperity, which was derived principally from olive growing, prompted the construction of many fine town-houses with large mosaic floors.
The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and indefensibility on the south-western border of the Roman Empire. It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years, first as a Latinised Christian community, then as an early Islamic settlement. In the late 8th century it became the seat of Idris ibn Abdallah, the founder of the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco. By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes. Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, about 5 km (3.1 mi) from Volubilis.
The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid-18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes. It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that the site was definitively identified as that of the ancient city of Volubilis. During and after the period of French rule over Morocco, about half of the site was excavated, revealing many fine mosaics, and some of the more prominent public buildings and high-status houses were restored or reconstructed. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed for being "an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire".

Name
The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Amazigh word Walilt, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley.
It could also be seen as a direct translation of the Amazigh name if this one was related to the root WLLY meaning "to turn, to spin".
The Lewis & Short Latin dictionary gives the Latin meaning of "volubilis" as "that [which] is turned round or (more freq.) that [which] turns itself round, turning, spinning, whirling, circling, rolling, revolving." The word is mentioned in Horace's Epistles (I, 2, 43): labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis aevum ("It flows and will flow, swirling on forever.") In Classical Latin, the "v" in "volubilis" was pronounced like a "w", making the pronunciation closer to modern Amazigh and Arabic pronunciations.
Charles-Joseph Tissot (1828–1884) discovered that what some sources in Arabic referred to as "Qasr Fara'on" (قصر فرعون Pharaoh's Palace) corresponded with Volubilis. This term is still used nowadays by the locals, sometimes shortened as لقصر El Ksar, meaning "The Palace".

Foundation and Roman occupation
Built on a shallow slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis stands on a ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Khuman) where it is met by a small tributary stream called the Fertassa. It overlooks a rolling fertile alluvial plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been inhabited at least since the Late Atlantic Neolithic, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia. By the third century BC, the Carthaginians had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language.

The city lay within the kingdom of Mauretania, which became a Roman client state following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC. The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards, as the city's magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of suffete long after the end of Punic rule. Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a second capital at Volubilis. Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II, the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings, although of Berber ancestry; their preference for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city's design.

After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44 AD, the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity, derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain, olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles. At its peak in the late 2nd century, Volubilis had around 20,000 inhabitants – a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town – and the surrounding region was also well inhabited, to judge from over 50 villas discovered in the area. It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela, who described it in his work De situ orbis libri III as one of "the wealthiest cities, albeit the wealthiest among small ones" in Mauretania. It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as Volubilis Colonia. Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers.

The city remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40–44 AD led by one of Ptolemy's freedmen, Aedemon, and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten-year exemption from taxes. The city was raised to the status of a municipium and its system of governance was overhauled, with the Punic-style suffetes replaced by annually elected duumvirs, or pairs of magistrates. However, the city's position was always tenuous; it was located on the south-eastern edge of the province, facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes. A ring of five forts located at the modern hamlets of Aïn Schkor, Bled el Gaada, Sidi Moussa, Sidi Said and Bled Takourart (ancient Tocolosida) were constructed to bolster the city's defence. Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata, an auxiliary cavalry unit from Gaul, while Aïn Schkor housed Hispanic and Belgic cohorts. Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of Parthians, and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at Toscolosida. Rising tensions in the region near the end of the 2nd century led the emperor Marcus Aurelius to order the construction of a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers. Volubilis was connected by road to Lixus and Tingis (capital city of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana, modern Tangier) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of Mauretania Caesariensis, as the territory of the Berber Baquates tribe lay in between. A Jewish community existed in Volubilis in the third century, as evident from several Hebrew, Greek and Latin funeral inscriptions and Menorah-shaped lamps. It is the most south-western location where ancient Hebrew inscription has been found.

Rome's control over the city ended following the chaos of the Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established. In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised what was left of the province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. A statue representing a good shepherd with crossed arms might hint to Christians in the town and early fourth century evidence of crossing oneself as suggested by Thouvenot. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.

After the Romans
Volubilis continued to be inhabited for centuries after the end of Roman control. It was certainly reoccupied by the Eastern Roman Empire in the sixth and seventh century, when three Christian inscriptions are dated by the provincial year. By the time the Arabs had arrived in 708, the city's name was changed to Oualila or Walīlī, and it was inhabited by the Awraba, a Berber tribe that originated in Libya. Much of the city centre had been abandoned and was turned into a cemetery, while the centre of habitation had moved to the southwest of the city, where a new wall was built to contain the abridged Roman town.
Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period. Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site, attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco. They are concentrated outside the city walls, which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them. It was here that Moulay Idriss established the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco in 787-8. A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, he escaped to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of Fakhkh in 787. He was proclaimed "imam" in Volubilis, occupied by the Awraba, under Ishaq ibn Mohammad. He married Kanza, from the Awraba, and fathered a son, Idris II, who was proclaimed imam in Volubilis. He, too, lived outside the walls of the city, along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane, where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters. Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign, founding the city of Fes. He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid. On his majority Idriss II removed to Fes which served as his new capital, depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance.

A Muslim group known as the Rabedis, who had revolted in Córdoba in Al-Andalus (Andalusia in modern Spain), resettled at Volubilis in 818. Although people continued to live in Volubilis for several more centuries, it was probably almost deserted by the 14th century. Leo Africanus describes its walls and gates, as well as the tomb of Idris, guarded only by two or three castles. His body was subsequently removed to Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, 3 km (1.9 mi), where a great mausoleum was built for it. The name of the city was forgotten and it was termed Ksar Faraoun, or the "Pharaoh's Castle", by the local people, alluding to a legend that the ancient Egyptians had built it. Nonetheless, some of its buildings remained standing, albeit ruined, until as late as the 17th century when Moulay Ismail ransacked the site to provide building material for his new imperial capital at Meknes. An earthquake in 1755 caused further severe destruction. However, English antiquarian John Windus had sketched the site in 1722. In his 1725 book A Journey to Mequinez, Windus described the scene:

One building seems to be part of a triumphal arch, there being several broken stones that bear inscriptions, lying in the rubbish underneath, which were fixed higher than any part now standing. It is 56 feet long and 15 thick, both sides exactly alike, built with very hard stones, about a yard in length and half a yard thick. The arch is 20 feet wide and about 26 high. The inscriptions are upon large flat stones, which, when entire, were about five feet long, and three broad, and the letters on them above 6 inches long. A bust lay a little way off, very much defaced, and was the only thing to be found that represented life, except the shape of a foot seen under the lower part of a garment, in the niche on the other side of the arch. About 100 yards from the arch stands a good part of the front of a large square building, which is 140 feet long and about 60 high; part of the four corners are yet standing, but very little remains, except these of the front. Round the hill may be seen the foundation of a wall about two miles in circumference, which inclosed these buildings; on the inside of which lie scattered, all over, a great many stones of the same size the arch is built with, but hardly one stone left upon another. The arch, which stood about half a mile from the other buildings, seemed to have been a gateway, and was just high enough to admit a man to pass through on horseback.
Visiting 95 years later in 1820, after the 1755 earthquake had flattened the few buildings left standing, James Gray Jackson wrote:

Half an hour's journey after leaving the sanctuary of Muley Dris Zerone, and at the foot of Atlas, I perceived to the left of the road, magnificent and massive ruins. The country, for miles round, is covered with broken columns of white marble. There were still standing two porticoes about 30 feet high and 12 wide, the top composed of one entire stone. I attempted to take a view of these immense ruins, which have furnished marble for the imperial palaces at Mequinas and Tafilelt; but I was obliged to desist, seeing some persons of the sanctuary following the cavalcade. Pots and kettles of gold and silver coins are continually dug up from these ruins. The country, however, abounds with serpents, and we saw many scorpions under the stones that my conductor turned up. These ruins are said by the Africans to have been built by one of the Pharaohs: they are called Kasser Farawan.

Walter Burton Harris, a writer for The Times, visited Volubilis during his travels in Morocco between 1887 and 1889, after the site had been identified by French archaeologists but before any serious excavations or restorations had begun. He wrote:

There is not very much remains standing of the ruins; two archways, each of great size, and in moderately good preservation, alone tell of the grandeur of the old city, while acres and acres of land are strewn with monuments and broken sculpture. A few isolated pillars also remain, and an immense drain or aqueduct, not unlike the Cloaca Maxima at Rome, opens on to the little river below.

Excavation, restoration and UNESCO listing
Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1955, but the excavations at the site began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover northwest Africa's pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites.
The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it, "The Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign", which "gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty." Emile Pauty of the Institut des Hautes Études Marocaines criticised the Muslims for taking the view that "the passage of time is nothing" and charged them with "let[ting] their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them." This perspective can be linked to the Islamic understanding of time itself, as reflected in the hadith stating, "Anyone who abuses Time insults me because I am Time; the matter is in my hands; I alternate night and day." For Muslims, the passage of time and its effects are seen as part of God's divine control, which may influence their approach to preserving physical monuments, viewing their natural decay as part of the divine order rather than a concern to be actively managed. Unlike the Western focus on legacy through enduring material achievements, Muslims often see true legacy in moral deeds, knowledge, charitable works, and spiritual impact, reflecting the belief that the world is impermanent and only what pleases God ultimately endures.
The French programme of excavation at Volubilis and other sites in French-controlled North Africa (in Algeria and Tunisia) had a strong ideological component. Archaeology at Roman sites was used as an instrument of colonialist policy, to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new "Latin" societies that the French were building in North Africa. The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites, excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches. Ruined cities, such as Timgad in Algeria, were excavated and cleared on a massive scale. The remains were intended to serve, as one writer has put it, as "the witness to an impulse towards Romanization".
This theme resonated with other visitors to the site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between "two dominations look[ing] at each other across the valley", the ruins of Volubilis and "the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as representing "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as "more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being "rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition."
The first excavations at Volubilis were carried out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.
Following the war, excavations resumed under the French and Moroccan authorities (following Morocco's independence in 1955) and a programme of restoration and reconstruction began. The Arch of Caracalla had already been restored in 1930–34. It was followed by the Capitoline Temple in 1962, the basilica in 1965–67 and the Tingis Gate in 1967. A number of mosaics and houses underwent conservation and restoration in 1952–55. In recent years, one of the olive-oil production workshops in the southern end of the city has been restored and furnished with a replica Roman oil press. These restorations have not been without controversy; a review carried out for UNESCO in 1997 reported that "some of the reconstructions, such as those on the triumphal arch, the capitolium, and the oil-pressing workshop, are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice."
From 2000 excavations carried out by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine under the direction of Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of the ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.
UNESCO listed Volubilis as a World Heritage Site in 1997. In the 1980s, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) organised three conferences to assess possible nominations to the World Heritage List for sites in North Africa. It was unanimously agreed that Volubilis was a good candidate for the list and in 1997 ICOMOS recommended that it be inscribed as "an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire", which UNESCO accepted.

City layout and infrastructure
Prior to the Roman occupation, Volubilis covered an area of about 12 hectares (30 acres), built on a V-shaped ridge between the Fertassa and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north–south axis. It was developed on a fairly regular pattern typical of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements and was enclosed by a set of walls. Under the Romans, the city was expanded considerably on a northeast–southwest axis, increasing in size to about 42 hectares (100 acres). Most of the city's public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city. The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part, behind the Decumanus Maximus (main street), which bisected the Roman-era part of the city. The decumanus was paved, with footways on either side, and was lined with arcaded porticoes on either sides, behind which were dozens of shops. The Arch of Caracalla marks the point at which the old and new cities merge. After the aqueduct fell into disrepair with the end of the Roman occupation, a new residential area was constructed to the west near the Wadi Khoumane.
The city was supplied with water by an aqueduct that ran from a spring in the hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80 AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply and a series of drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.

Most of the original pre-Roman city wall was built over or destroyed, but a 77-metre (250 ft) stretch of the original wall, which was made of mud bricks on a stone foundation, can still be seen near the tumulus. The Roman city walls stretch for 2.6 km (1.6 mi) and average 1.6 m (5.2 ft) thick. Built of rubble masonry and ashlar, they are mostly still extant. The full circuit of walls had 34 towers, spaced at intervals of about one every 50 metres (160 ft), and six main gates that were flanked by towers. A part of the eastern wall has been reconstructed to a height of 1.5 metres (4.9 ft). The Tingis Gate, also reconstructed, marks the northern-eastern entrance to Volubilis. It was constructed in 168/169 AD – the date is known due to the discovery of a coin of that year that was deliberately embedded in the gate's stonework by its builders.
An early medieval wall stands to the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, apparently some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north–south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.

Commerce
During Roman times, Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central to the life of the city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.

Notable buildings
Although only about half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of prominent public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.
A large tumulus of uncertain origin and purpose stands approximately in the middle of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.

Public buildings
Two major public buildings are readily visible at the centre of the city – the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century, it is one of the finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya. The building is 42.2 m (138 ft) long by 22.3 m (73 ft) wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain. Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century, as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures.
The Capitoline Temple stands behind the basilica within what would originally have been an arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps leading up to the Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.
There were five other temples in the city, of which the most notable is the so-called "Temple of Saturn" that stood on the eastern side of Volubilis. It appears to have been built on top of, or converted from, an earlier Punic temple, which may have been dedicated to Baal. It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three-sided portico. In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium. The temple's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted.

Volubilis also possessed at least three sets of public baths. Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of Gallienus, redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city's most lavish baths. The nearby north baths were the largest in the city, covering an area of about 1,500 m2 (16,000 sq ft). They were possibly built in the time of Hadrian.

Triumphal arch
The Arch of Caracalla is one of Volubilis' most distinctive sights, situated at the end of the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.
The arch is constructed from local stone and was originally topped by a bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins at the foot of the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930 and 1934. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.

The inscription reads (after the abbreviations have been expanded):

IMPERATORI CAESARI MARCO AVRELLIO ANTONINO PIO FELICI AVGVSTO PARTHICO MAXIMO BRITTANICO MAXIMO GERMANICO MAXIMO
PONTIFICI MAXIMO TRIBVNITIA POTESTATE XX IMPERATORI IIII CONSVLI IIII PATRI PATRIAE PROCONSVLI ET IVLIAE AVGVSTAE PIAE FELICI MATRI

SEBASTENO PROCVRATORE AVGVSTI DEVOTISSIMO NVMINI EIVS A SOLO FACIENDVM CVRAVIT
or, in translation:

For the emperor Caesar, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus [Caracalla], the pious, fortunate Augustus, greatest victor in Parthia, greatest victor in Britain, greatest victor in Germany, Pontifex Maximus, holding tribunician power for the twentieth time, Emperor for the fourth time, Consul for the fourth time, Father of the Country, Proconsul, and for Julia Augusta [Julia Domna], the pious, fortunate mother of the camp and the Senate and the country, because of his exceptional and new kindness towards all, which is greater than that of the principes that came before, the Republic of the Volubilitans took care to have this arch made from the ground up, including a chariot drawn by six horses and all the ornaments, with Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, procurator, who is most deeply devoted to the divinity of Augustus, initiating and dedicating it.

Houses and palaces
The houses found at Volubilis range from richly decorated mansions to simple two-room mud-brick structures used by the city's poorer inhabitants. The city's considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy, some of which have large mosaics still in situ. They have been named by archaeologists after their principal mosaics (or other finds):

The House of Orpheus in the southern part of the city thus takes its name from the large Orpheus mosaic, showing the god playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.
The House of the Athlete or Desultor, located near the forum, contains a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand. It may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade. They were entered from side streets between the shops.
The House of the Ephebe was named after a bronze statue found there. It has a prominent interior courtyard leading to a number of public rooms decorated with mosaics, including a depiction of Bacchus in a chariot being drawn by leopards.
The House of the Knight next door also has a mosaic of Bacchus, this time shown coming across the sleeping Ariadne, who later bore him six children. The house takes its name from a bronze statue of a rider found here in 1918 that is now on display in the archaeological museum in Rabat. It was a large building, with an area of about 1,700 m2 (18,000 sq ft), and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including eight or nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive-pressing complex.

The House of the Labours of Hercules is named for the mosaic depicting the twelve tasks that the demigod had to perform as penance for killing his wife and children. It is thought to have been created during the reign of the emperor Commodus, who identified himself with Hercules. Jupiter, his lover Ganymede and the four seasons are depicted in another mosaic in the house. The house was of palatial size, with 41 rooms covering an area of 2,000 m2 (22,000 sq ft).
A building dubbed the Gordian Palace is located further up the Decumanus Maximus. It was the largest building in the city and was probably the residence of the governor, rather than the emperor Gordian III; it was rebuilt during Gordian's reign in the mid-3rd century. It combined two separate houses to create a complex of 74 rooms with courtyards and private bathhouses serving both domestic and official functions. It also incorporated a colonnaded front with a dozen shops behind the colonnade, and an oil factory consisting of three oil presses and an oil store in the north-east corner of the complex. The decoration of the Gordian Palace is today quite plain with only a few scanty mosaics remaining. The floors seem to have been mostly rendered with opus sectile rather than decorated with mosaics. Inscriptions found in the palace testify to the city's decline and eventual fall. They record a series of treaties reached with the local Berber chieftains, increasing in number as the city became more vulnerable and the tribesmen pressed harder. By the time of the final treaty, just a few years before the fall of the city, the chieftains were being treated as virtual equals of Rome – an indication of how much Roman power in the area had declined. The last two inscribed altars, from 277 and 280, refer to a foederata et diuturna pax (a "federated and lasting peace"), though this proved to be a forlorn hope, as Volubilis fell soon afterwards.
The House of Venus, towards the eastern side of the city under a prominent cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.
The same building was also the site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made at the same time as the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.

Headquarters of Idris I
Just outside the walls of the city, on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule at the corner of the building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters.

## Overview
Moulay Idriss or Moulay Idriss Zerhoun is located north of Meknes and is considered the holiest city of Morocco.

## Understand
It was here that Moulay Idriss I arrived in 789, bringing with him the religion of Islam, and starting a new dynasty. In addition to founding the town named after him, he also initiated construction of Fez, continued later by his son, Moulay Idriss II.
The town is compact, and its narrow streets will feel familiar to anyone who has spent time in the medinas of other Moroccan cities. Just off the main square is the Mausoleum of Idriss I, a sacred destination that is open only to Muslims. It is said in Morocco that six pilgrimages to Moulay Idriss during the annual festival honoring the saint is equivalent to one Haj to Mecca. Also of note is the round minaret at another mosque in town, the only one in Morocco. The ruins of the Phoenician and Roman city of Volubilis are located 5 km away. Moulay Idriss I took many materials from here in order to build his town.

## By bus
Local bus #15 from Meknes is a convenient option, 7 dirham. You can catch it at the roundabout near the Grand Taxi Stand—check the Meknes City bus website[dead link] for all the stops.
There are two daily buses on Meknes–Chefchaouen route, they can drop off passengers at roundabout leading to Moulay Idriss on request, it's about 3 hours to Chefchaouen.
34.056815-5.5232281 Gare Routière.    (updated Jan 2023)

## By grand taxi
Can be found in the large taxi rank opposite the French Institute (Institut Francais) in Meknes. A single seat in the grand taxi costs 10 dirham (Dec 2015) and the drive takes around 30 min.

## By private taxi
They should be around 300-350 dirham with the driver waiting while you peruse the site.

## By tour
Alternatively, there are organised coach tours running from Fez and possibly Meknes to Volubilis. Just ask your local tout.

## Get around
Everything is actually walkable. The remaining 2.4 km between Moulay Idriss and Volubilis can be covered by foot or taxi (40 dirham). If coming in by bus or grand taxi, get off at the 34.059108-5.5330992 roundabout along the "highway", when the vehicle turns towards the Moulay Idriss.

## Moulay Idriss town
34.054094-5.52221 Zawiya of Moulay Idris I (just off the main town square). A religious complex including a mosque area and mausoleum chamber with a huge green-tiled pyramidal roof. It's off limits to non-Muslims.      (updated Jan 2023)
34.056475-5.5202932 Sentissi Mosque. A mosque with the Cylindrical Minaret, allegedly the only one in Morocco. Built in 1939 by a local man after his return from the hajj in Mecca. It is now a Qur'anic school (madrasa).    (updated Jan 2023)

## Volubilis
Entrance fee: 100 dirham, 8:30 – one hour before sunset. (Note, at the north end, there is no ticket stand.)
Volubilis is one of the main tourist sites to visit in Morocco, extending over 40 hectares (99 acres). It's a partly excavated Roman city with UNESCO World Heritage status, listed for being "an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire". The houses found at Volubilis range from richly decorated mansions to simple two-room mud-brick structures used by the city's poorer inhabitants. The city's considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy, some of which have large mosaics still in situ.

## Do
The hills around Moulay offer numerous opportunities for hiking and photography. The fertile plain of the Saiss Valley spreads out beneath the town, and olive groves dot the countryside.
Walk up to the "grand" terrace. This is a spot which gives you a great view over the town, fantastic spot to watch the sunset if you are staying overnight. To get there walk almost into Mausoleum and then in the tunnel part take a left and wiggle up the hill, to begin with you can follow signs for Scorpion House. If you get lost there are plenty of locals and children especially who you show you the way for a small price.

## Sleep
There is a small selection of hotels, but most travelers do this as a day trip from Meknes.

## Stay safe
There is hardly any shade so bring a hat and water since it can get very hot.

## Go next

Meknes (Arabic: مكناس, romanized: maknās, pronounced [maknaːs]) is one of the four Imperial cities of Morocco, located in northern central Morocco and the sixth largest city by population in the kingdom. Founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids as a military settlement, Meknes became the capital of Morocco during the reign of Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), son of the founder of the Alaouite dynasty. Sultan Ismail created a massive imperial palace complex and endowed the city with extensive fortifications and monumental gates. The city recorded a population of 551,503 in the 2024 Moroccan census. It is the seat of Meknès Prefecture and an important economic hub in the region of Fès-Meknès.

Etymology
Meknes is named after an Amazigh (Berber) tribe historically known as the Miknasa (Imeknasen in Amazigh languages).

History
Early history (8th–16th centuries)
Volubilis, a major Roman-era settlement in Morocco and one of its early urban centres, is located near the site of the current city of Meknes. The current city and its name, however, originate with a Berber tribe called the Miknasa who settled this region around the 10th century. A group of small unfortified Miknasa villages known as miknāsat al-zaytūn were established here in the 10th century. The Almoravids founded a fortress or fortified settlement just south of these villages after conquering the area in the 11th century. Originally called Tagrart or Taqrart, this Almoravid settlement formed the beginnings of what is now the old medina of Meknes. The Nejjarine Mosque, often reputed to be the oldest mosque in the city, dates back to the Almoravid period and may have served as the central mosque of the Almoravid settlement. The mosque that became the present-day Grand Mosque of Meknes is believed to have been first built by the Almoravids in the 12th century.
The fortress resisted the military advance of the Almohads, who destroyed the city after a long siege in the 12th century. However, at the beginning of the 13th century the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir (ruled 1199–1213) rebuilt the city and its fortifications, as well as its Grand Mosque. The city enjoyed relative prosperity in this period, before being conquered again by the new Marinid dynasty in 1244. The first kasbah (citadel or governor's district) of Meknes was created afterwards by sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in 1276 CE – the same year that the citadel of Fes el-Jdid was built in nearby Fes, the new capital. During this period, Meknes was frequently the residence of Marinid princes (often appointed there as governors) and especially of viziers. The Mosque of the Kasbah (the later Mosque of Lalla Aouda) was also founded and first built in 1276. The Marinids also carried out major restorations to the Grand Mosque in the 14th century and built the major madrasas of the city near it. The latter included the Bou Inania Madrasa (built in 1336) and two other madrasas, Madrasa al-Qadi and Madrasa Shuhud, all built by Sultan Abu el-Hassan.
After the end of the Marinid and Wattasid periods, however, Meknes suffered from neglect as the new Saadian dynasty (16th and early 17th century) focused their attention on their capital at Marrakesh and neglected the old northern cities of Morocco.

The reign of Moulay Isma'il (17th–18th centuries)
It wasn't until the Alaouite dynasty in the second half of the 17th century that Meknes received renewed attention. Under Moulay Rashid (ruled 1666–1672), the first Alaouite sultan to unite Morocco under his rule, Fes became the capital once more and his brother, Moulay Isma'il ibn Sharif, governed Meknes. Upon Rashid's death in 1672, Moulay Isma'il became sultan and chose Meknes as his new capital. In addition to his possible attachment to the city as a governor, a number of reasons may have favoured this choice. One may have been the fact that Ismail had to fight hard to reconquer both Fes and Marrakesh from his rival nephew (Ahmad al-Mahriz, son of Moulay Rashid) during the first years of his reign, which may have rendered him skeptical towards both cities as possible centers of power. Moreover, Moulay Rashid had garrisoned much of Fes with his own contingents from the Tafilalt and eastern Morocco while Moulay Isma'il was forming his own personal royal guard composed of Black slaves ('abid) from Sub-Saharan Africa, and there may have been concerns that not all these contingents could be garrisoned simultaneously in Fes. The ulema (religious scholars) of Fes were also particularly disapproving of his ways, including his use of slaves (many of whom were of Muslim background), and maintained tense relations with him throughout his reign. Choosing Meknes thus removed him from the influence of traditional elites and allowed him to build a fresh base from which he hoped to exercise absolute power. The threat of Ottoman attacks from the east (from Algeria) and the increasing insecurity in central Morocco due to tribal migrations from the Atlas and Sahara regions may have also persuaded Ismail that Meknes, situated further west, was more defensible than Fes.
Whatever the reasons, Ismail made Meknes the center of Morocco in his time and he embarked on the construction of a new monumental palace-city on the south side of the old city. Its construction continued throughout the 55 years of his reign, beginning immediately after his accession to the throne in 1672. Existing structures dating from the earlier medieval kasbah of the city were demolished to make way; the name of the large public square in front of the Kasbah today, el-Hedim (or Place el-Hedim), means "the rubble" and came from the masses of rubble and debris which were piled here during the demolition. Labour was carried out by paid workers as well as by contingents of slaves, particularly Christian prisoners of war. Estimates on the total number of workers involved range from 25,000 and 55,000. Nonetheless, frequently-told stories about the tens of thousands of Christian slaves used for labour and the large underground dungeons where they were kept are somewhat exaggerated and originate from the accounts of European ambassadors who visited Isma'il's court (often to negotiate the release of prisoners from their countries). In reality, the number of Christian slaves was likely closer to a few thousand at most and the chambers popularly called "prisons" were actually storage rooms for grain and supplies.

It was also in Moulay Ismail's reign that the Jewish inhabitants of the city were moved to a new Mellah or Jewish district to the west, near the Kasbah, not unlike the Mellah of Fes or that of Marrakesh. The Mellah was located between the old medina, west of Place el-Hedim, and the more outlying quarter of Madinat al-Riyad al-Anbari. Both the Mellah and Madinat ar-Riyad were part of an urban extension ordered by Isma'il in the western angle between the old city and the Kasbah. Moulay Isma'il also undertook works throughout the old city too. He refortified the walls and built new monumental city gates such as Bab Berda'in and Bab Khemis. He also built several other kasbahs or garrison forts throughout the city to house his 'abid troops and help protect (and control) the rest of the town, such as the Kasbah Hadrash and the Kasbah Tizimi. He carried out renovations to the Grand Mosque and the nearby Madrasa al-Qadi (which he devotes to students from the Tafilalt), and founded the Zitouna Mosque. Khnata bent Bakkar, one of his wives who was vizier (minister) under him (and briefly became de facto ruler of Morocco in 1728 after his death), was responsible for founding the Bab Berda'in Mosque, completed in 1709.One of the last constructions before his death, carried out between 1721 and 1725, was the Heri al-Mansur, a palace on the far southern edge of the kasbah which included vast stables. The monumental gate known as Bab al-Mansur al-'Alj, overlooking Place al-Hedim, was only finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. His son and brief successor, Moulay Ahmad ad-Dhahabi, carried out modifications to his father's mausoleum during his two brief reigns (in 1727–28 and 1728–29) and was himself buried here in 1729.

Later Alaouite period (18th–20th centuries)
Following Moulay Isma'il's death, however, the political situation in Morocco degenerated into relative anarchy as his sons competed for power. Meknes lost its status as capital and suffered damage in the 1755 earthquake. The city was neglected and many parts of the enormous imperial kasbah fell into disrepair. The site received only occasional royal attention in the following centuries. Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah, who ruled between 1757 and 1790, built a number of projects in the city. He added the Dar al-Bayda Palace in the Agdal garden to the southeast of the main palace complex, which was later turned into a royal military academy. He constructed the Er-Roua Mosque in the southern part of Moulay Isma'il's Kasbah, which became the largest mosque in Meknes. He also renovated and added a qubba over the tomb of Sidi Mohammed ben Aissa (just outside the city walls) and built the current minarets of the Grand Mosque and the Nejjarine Mosque in the old city. The Dar al-Kebira, however, was abandoned and progressively transformed into a residential neighbourhood where the inhabitants constructed their houses within and between the former palace structures of Isma'il's time. In the early 19th century, Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman added a loggia structure in front of Bab al-Mansur which served as a meeting place for ceremonies and the governor's tribunal, though this structure was later removed.

Recent history (20th–21st centuries)
After the installation of French colonial rule in Morocco in 1912, the French administration created a new city (Ville Nouvelle) on a nearby plateau across the valley on the northeast side of the old city. The capital of Morocco was moved from Fes to Rabat, further marginalizing cities like Meknes (which is near Fes). Some traditional Muslim authorities and officials were retained, but Meknes was reorganized under a new French municipal and military regime. This also led to a greater influence of the cities over their surrounding countryside and growing urbanization. The city became a transportation hub for people and goods traveling from east to west or from north to south across the country, in addition to hosting extensive military barracks. The population of Meknes grew from 25,000 at the beginning of the century to over 140,000 by the mid-20th century. Some roads in the old city were widened to accommodate greater circulation, but most of the new development took place in the Ville Nouvelle. The new French authorities took interest in the conservation of historic monuments in the old city; the madrasas, for example, were restored in 1922. During this period Meknes also became a center of agriculture and viniculture, led mainly by French colonists who appropriated large amounts of land nearby.
Nonetheless, Meknes, like other cities, also hosted resistance to French authority. In 1937, a particularly serious and violent revolt erupted following attempts to divert the local river to benefit the French settler population during a time of food shortages for the native Moroccan population. A violent suppression of protests took place in the city which results in 13 dead and more injured. Following Morocco's independence in 1956, the changes which began or accelerated under French rule continued to run their course. Large scale rural migration increased the population of the city and intensified the urbanization process (as elsewhere in the country). Industries developed around the city's perimeter, but at the same time the old elites and bourgeois families moved away to the coastal cities like Casablanca and Rabat.
These changes also contributed to the relative neglect of the old city. According to the ICOMOS Heritage at Risk report of 2000, the historic city of Meknes contains insufficient drainage systems, and as a result, suffers from inundation and leakage in certain areas. Still, some conservation and restoration efforts have taken place in recent years, motivated in part by the revenues of tourism. As of 2023, a number of major restoration projects were planned or underway, led by ADER-Fès (Agence pour la Dédensification et la Réhabilitation de la Médina de Fès), a quasi-governmental agency based in Fez. The projects include proposed restorations to the historic city walls, to the Heri es-Swani, and to the Bou Inania Madrasa, along with other improvements to parking and tourism infrastructure.

Geography
Meknes is located in a strategic position in the heart of Morocco. To its south and south-east are the rich cedar forests and mountains of the Middle Atlas mountains with the cities Ifrane and Azrou; and more to the south are the rich oases of Tafilalt. To the west are the two largest metropolitan areas of Morocco: Casablanca and Rabat. To the north is the mountainous north of Morocco with the cities of Tangier and Tétouan. Oujda and Fes lie east of Meknes.

Climate
Meknes has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) with continental influences. Its climate is similar to some inland cities in southern Portugal (such as Beja or Évora) and some areas of southern Spain. The temperatures shifts from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months of June–September. Afternoon temperatures generally rise 10–14 °C above the low on most days. The winter highs typically reach only 15.5 °C (59.9 °F) in December–January, whereas night temperatures average 5 °C (41 °F). Snow is rare.

Districts - Quartiers (in French)
Prefecture
Meknes is the seat of the prefecture of Meknès, which consists of 6 municipalities (including the city Meknes) and 15 rural communes.

Historic monuments and landmarks
The main historic monuments of the city are concentrated in the medina (old city) and the vast former Kasbah of Moulay Ismail to the south. The most notable monuments are listed below.

Place el-Hedim
Often compared to the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in Marrakesh, el-Hedim Square (Place el-Hedim) is a vast plaza at the southern end of the old city, before the main gates of Moulay Isma'il's former royal palace complex. The square's name, el-Hedim, means "the rubble/debris" and refers to the demolitions which Moulay Isma'il carried out here during the construction of his palaces. He left this open space as a public square to separate his palace from the rest of the city. Since then, the square has become the focus of various activities including evening entertainers such as storytellers, acrobats, and musicians.

Mosques and madrasas
Grand mosque of Meknes: The old city's most important mosque and one of its oldest, covering about 3,500 square meters and was founded in the 12th century by the Almoravids, although renovated many times since.
Madrasa Bou Inania: The city's most famous madrasa (school for higher learning in Islamic sciences) was established by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan in 1335-36 but is now named after his son Abu Inan (who may have later restored it). Open to tourists today, it is one of the most richly decorated buildings in the city.
Nejjarine Mosque: Often reputed to be the oldest in the city, this mosque also dates back to the Almoravid period, though it has been modified multiple times.
Lalla Aouda Mosque: The main mosque of the city's former kasbah and of Moulay Isma'il's palaces, it was first founded in the Marinid era but completely rebuilt by Moulay Isma'il between 1672 and 1678. Its prominent minaret is visible from the adjoining Place Lalla Aouda (Lalla Awda Square).
Bab Berda'in Mosque: The mosque, located near the northern gate of the medina (Bab Berda'in) was completed in 1709 on the orders of Morocco's first female minister, Khnata bent Bakkar. The mosque was the site of a tragedy in 2010 when its historic minaret collapsed, killing 41 people. The mosque has since been repaired and its minaret rebuilt.
Ar-Roua Mosque: The largest mosque in Meknes, it was built by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah between 1757 and 1790. It is located near the Heri al-Mansur palace in the southern part of the Kasbah of Moulay Isma'il.
Zitouna Mosque: A large mosque founded by Sultan Moulay Isma'il around 1687.
Zawiya of Sidi Mohammed Ben Aissa: Also known as the Mausoleum of Sheikh al-Kamel. An important mausoleum and religious complex (zawiya) just outside the city walls to the northwest, originally dating from the late 18th century but restored later. Mohamed ben 'Aissa, founder of the Aissawiya, a major Sufi brotherhood in Morocco, is buried here. He is considered the patron saint of Meknes, and his annual moussem (festival) is one of the most intense and was historically known for its displays of self-mutilation.
Zawiya of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami: A richly decorated mosque and religious complex honoring the tomb of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami, a famous Moroccan poet who died in 1850.

Fortifications and gates
Bab Mansur al-'Alj: The most famous gateway of the city (also known as Bab Mansour or Bab el-Mansur), this gate overlooks the southern end of Place el-Hedim and acted as the ceremonial grand entrance to the Kasbah of Moulay Isma'il. It was begun in the later years of Moulay Isma'il's reign and finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. Its name comes from the architect and designer of the gate, Mansour al-'Alj (the "Victorious Apostate"), a former Christian slave who converted to Islam. It is notable for its size and its rich decoration consisting of darj-wa-ktaf motifs carved into brick, filled with colourful zellij (mosaic tilework), and topped by a long and elaborate Arabic inscription painted on tile.
Bab Jama' an-Nouar: Another ornate gate located next to Bab Mansur; also called Bab al-Nuwwar in some sources.
Bab ad-Dar al-Kebira: The monumental gate entrance to the Dar al-Kebira palace, dating to 1679–80.
Bab el-Khemis: A monumental western gate of the city, near the former Mellah, dating from 1687 under the reign of Moulay Ismail and richly decorated with motifs and zellij similar to Bab al-Mansur.
Bab al-Barda'in: The monumental northern gate of the city, also built by Moulay Isma'il and richly decorated.

Borj Belkari: A bastion tower built in the 17th century as a part of the defensive walls of the Kasbah of Sultan Moulay Ismail in Meknes, Morocco. Since 2003 it holds a pottery museum.

Imperial Palaces of Moulay Isma'il
The palace complex or "imperial city" of Sultan Moulay Isma'il was constructed over his entire 55-year reign from 1672 to 1727 (with some elements finished or remodeled shortly after). It occupies the site of the city's former medieval kasbah (citadel) and stretches over an area approximately four times larger than the old city itself. It was composed of several autonomous palaces along with vast gardens, religious buildings, and other amenities. The complex was also notable for its impressive infrastructure, which included a water supply system with a hydraulic system of wells, norias (water extraction mechanism powered by wheel), canals, and underground pipes which distributed water to the royal city's many buildings. It also contained numerous monumental granaries and underground warehouses which stockpiled supplies that could allegedly sustain the city for a siege of ten years. Below is a list of some of its main areas and monuments.

Place Lalla Aouda: A vast open square which stands behind (southeast of) Bab al-Mansur, which served as the former mechouar of the palace. It precedes the former Dar al-Kebira palace and gives access to the Lalla Aouda Mosque.
Dar el-Kebira: The oldest palace in the kasbah, finished in 1679 and itself composed of multiple palaces. Its name means "the Great House". It was the private residence of the sultan and his family, connected directly to the Lalla Aouda Mosque and the later royal mausoleum. The palace fell into ruin after Moulay Isma'il's death (and after the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake), and has since become a residential neighbourhood where common people built their houses amidst the remains of Isma'il's massive palace walls, still visible in various places.
Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il: The royal mausoleum and funerary complex of Moulay Isma'il and some of his family members and successors. It was built under his reign but significantly modified by Ahmad ad-Dhahabi between 1727 and 1729. The funerary complex was originally entered from the dar al-Kebira to the north but is nowadays entered by a 20th-century gate to the south. Still considered a religious site today, it is also open to tourists. It is composed of relatively austere courtyards leading to a richly decorated indoor patio chamber, which in turn grants access to the tomb chamber of the sultan.
Qubbat al-Khayyatin and the Qara Prison: The Qubbat al-Khayyatin is a standalone audience chamber or throne room where Moulay Isma'il once received foreign ambassadors. Underground, right next to it, is a large subterranean vaulted space known as the Qara Prison or Habs Qara. Although frequently described as a prison for Christian slaves, scholars agree that it was in fact a storage area and granary, one of many such structures throughout the royal city.
Dar al-Makhzen: This vast walled enclosure, much larger and more rationally organized than the Dar el-Kebira, contained extensive gardens and two more main palaces in Moulay Isma'il's time, some of which have been restored or adapted for current use as one of the royal residences of the King of Morocco. The enclosure, generally known as the Dar al-Makhzen (not to be confused with the royal palaces of the same name in Fez and elsewhere), was divided into two sections. The western section was mostly occupied by the Bahrawiya Gardens but also contained a long narrow palace on its northern edge known as the Dar al-Madrasa ("House of the School"), most likely another private palace of the sultan. The eastern section, which is still entered via an ornate royal gate on its eastern perimeter (north of Heri es-Swani), was mostly occupied by the Qasr al-Muhannasha ("Palace of the Labyrinth"). This palace consisted of roughly eight large courtyards or garden enclosures and acted as both a reception palace and an administrative palace.
Heri as-Swani and the Sahrij (Agdal Basin): The Sahrij or Agdal Basin is an enormous water basin or artificial lake south of the Dar al-Makhzen, which was originally a part of the royal city's water supply system. It measures 148.75 by 319 meters and is, on average, 1.2 meters deep. Next to it, on its eastern side, is an enormous structure composed of two parts: the "House of the Ten Norias" or Dar al-Ma ("House of Water") and the Heri as-Swani (also spelled as Heri es-Souani). The first of these is a monumental building of vaulted passages and domed chambers which contained a number of wheel-powered hydraulic mechanisms (norias) which drew water from the phreatic table underground to the surface, after which it was delivered into the Sahrij or redistributed to the city. The second part, the Heri as-Swani, is attached to the south side of this building and is made up of 22 rows of monumental arches which once held up a vaulted roof (which has since collapsed). Although frequently misidentified as the "royal stables" of the palace, this structure was, once again, a massive granary and storehouse. Grain was originally delivered to the building by mules who climbed onto a roof terrace and dropped the grain directly into holes pierced above each vaulted chamber.
Heri al-Mansur: One of the last constructions of Moulay Isma'il's reign, built between 1721 and 1725, its name means "Granary/silo of Victory", but it was also known as Dar al-Mansur or Qasr al-Mansur ("Palace of Victory"). It is located on the far southern perimeter of the Kasbah and consists of a massive building which seems to have served as a palace, fortress, and storehouse. The basement was taken up by storage rooms while the upper floor held reception rooms for the palace with views over the surrounding area. Located next to it were the Royal Stables of Moulay Isma'il (often misidentified today with the Heri as-Swani), which were reputed to be one of the palace city's most impressive features. It consisted of horse stalls sheltered under two parallel arcades (rows of arches) which stretched for 1200 meters on either side of a water canal which provided water for the horses. Unfortunately, the stables have not been preserved and very little remains of them today.

Synagogues
The Rabbi Meir Toledano Synagogue still stands in Meknes today. According to tradition, it was first built in the 13th century and rebuilt by the Toledano family in 1646.
The Etz Hayeem synagogue in Meknes is also a historical synagogue.

Museums
Dar Jamaï Museum: The best-known museum in Meknes, housing a number of artifacts and art objects from the city and other regions in Morocco. It is housed in a late 19th-century palace with gardens and ornate rooms built in 1882 by Mokhtar ben Larbi Jamai, who served as Grand Vizier under Sultan Moulay Hassan (ruled 1873–1894). His family also built the Jamai Palace in Fes.
Musée de Meknès (Meknes Museum): A small museum housed in a structure just northeast of Bab al-Mansur, exhibiting artifacts from all over Morocco.

Outlying sites
The ruins of the Roman town of Volubilis (Oualili), another UNESCO World Heritage Site, are about half an hour to the north, as is the village and important pilgrimage site of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun.

Economy
Meknes is an economic centre in Morocco with various products from three sectors (agriculture, industry and services), which makes the city economically competitive and attractive for investment.

Competitiveness
A December 2015 World Bank report classified Meknes as one of the three most competitive cities in Africa. Two of those three competitive African cities are Moroccan: Meknes and Tangier.

Agriculture
Meknes is considered to be the capital of agriculture in Morocco. And the Saïss plain is one of the most fertile and rich plains in Morocco and Meknes is the centre of this plain.

Each year Meknes holds the International Agriculture Show in Morocco (French: Salon International de l'Agriculture au Maroc) since April 2006. This agriculture show has an area of more than 250000 square meters, with more than 60 countries participating, and more than 1200 exhibitors.
The lands around Meknes area are known to be fertile and productive. The high elevation, fertility and the fresh water of those lands favor the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, most notably: peaches, nectarines, prunes, apples, potatoes, onions and garlic. Meknes is also known for its olives and olive oil. Livestock raising, particularly sheep and cattle, is widespread. Meknes has large industrial units for milk and dairy production that fulfill most of the needs of the region.

Industry
Industry in Meknes is of light type, most of it is related to food processing especially in the Commune of Mejjat, and chemical and para-chemical industry in other industrial zones like the Agropolis industrial and agribusiness zone. Add to those the textile and metallic manufacturing which are old industries in the city. The year 2016 marks a new era of industry in the city of Meknes; it includes electrical wire, embedded systems, and automotive parts production companies.

Major companies
Services
Many of the services products in Meknes are related to tourism due to the attractions of the old city district (the medina).

Transport
Road
The geographical location of the city of Meknes makes it one of the important transport hubs in Morocco. The city is accessed via the A2 expressway with two exits, one to the east of the city and another to the west.
The city's Gare Routière (intercity bus station) is located west of the medina, along with the main station for grand taxis (intercity taxis). A newer station for buses operated by CTM is located near the main railway station.

Rail
Two train stations are located in the new city district (French: Ville Nouvelle) of Meknes, with trains each hour to the east, west, and north of Morocco. One is larger than the other and serve a different purpose. Operated by ONCF, the following table lists destinations reachable via Meknes railway stations (round-trips):

As mentioned above, Meknes city has two train stations, and their names are: Meknes Railway Station (French: Gare de Meknès) and Meknes Amir Abdul Qadir Railway Station (French: Gare de Meknès Amir Abdelkader). All the mentioned trains cited in the previous table stop by the former station; and except the first row of the table, all the remaining trains stop by the latter station.

Air
The nearest airport is Fes-Saïss Airport (IATA: FEZ, ICAO: GMFF) accessible only by road transport.
Otherwise, Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca, with more international flights and destinations, is conveniently accessible by train.
There is also a military airport in Meknes.

Public Transport
Public transport in Meknes is managed by the urban commune and it consists of:

A large network of buses that cover all the area of the prefecture, and even outside of the prefecture like the line 16 to El Hajeb.
Taxis in the city exist in two types: small taxis with 3 places Max that work with fares system; and bigger taxis with 6 places Max that have a predetermined trajectory and fixed prices.

Meknès (en arabe : مَكْنَاس, Maknās) est une ville et commune du Maroc, chef-lieu de la préfecture de Meknès au sein de la région de Fès-Meknès. Elle est située sur le plateau de Saïss entre les massifs du Rif et du Moyen Atlas, et son territoire est traversé par la vallée du Oued Boufakrane.

Toponymie
La ville de Meknès tire son nom de la tribu amazighe Meknassa. Les membres de cette tribu sont appelés les Imknassen au pluriel, Ameknas au singulier. Ameknas signifie en berbère le guerrier ou le combattant. L'appellation Ameknas est utilisée par certains activistes berbères pour désigner la ville.
Plusieurs localités fondées par les Meknassas portent une appellation homonyme : Mkansa dans la Province de Taounate, Maknassa Al Gharbya, et Meknassa Acharqia dans la Province de Taza, Mequinenza en Espagne ou Meknassy en Tunisie.
La ville s'est également appelée Méquines ou Méquinez en français, et l'est toujours en espagnol. C'est ainsi que Voltaire écrivit : « Je voudrais que le tremblement de terre eût englouti cette misérable Acadie plutôt que Lisbonne et Méquines. ».
Du fait de son rôle de capitale durant le règne d'Ismaïl ben Chérif, la ville est communément désignée au Maroc par capitale ismaélienne; l'abondance des oliviers dans sa région lui confère l'appellation maknassata azzaytūn, qui signifie Meknès des oliviers.

Histoire
La région de Meknès est peuplée depuis le Néolithique. Le site archéologique de la capitale maurétanienne antique, Volubilis, qui servit aussi de capitale à la première dynastie musulmane du Maroc est situé dans sa banlieue nord. La ville a été fondée au XIe siècle par les Almoravides en tant qu'établissement militaire.
Elle fut la capitale du pays durant le règne d'Ismaïl ben Chérif (1672-1727), qui y fit édifier plusieurs monuments, dont notamment les hautes murailles entourant le cœur historique de la ville et percées par 70 portes imposantes.
Meknès est ainsi l'une des quatre villes impériales du Maroc et est inscrite à la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1996 en tant que ville historique regroupant deux entités : la médina et la ville impériale. Sous le protectorat français, la ville vit l'installation d'une importante communauté européenne et son territoire s'étendit au-delà de ses murailles.
Administrativement, Meknès est l'ancien chef-lieu de la région de Meknès-Tafilalet et actuellement l'un des deux principaux pôles urbains, ainsi qu'une préfecture de la région Fès-Meknès. La ville est composée de la municipalité de Meknès, Toulal, Ouislane et celle d'El Mechouar Stinia (où se trouve le palais royal). Meknès est la 6e plus plus grande ville du Maroc avec une population de 632 079 habitants selon le recensement de 2014.
Économiquement, la région de Meknès est l'une des plus importantes au Maroc en termes de production agricole, notamment par son oléiculture et sa viti-viniculture. La ville fait ainsi office de pôle agricole national et abrite plusieurs grands groupes du secteur au Maroc comme LCM-Aïcha et Les Huileries de Meknès. Parallèlement à sa vocation agricole, la ville profite du développement du secteur automobile marocain, notamment par l'implantation d'équipementiers automobiles dans ses zones industrielles. D'autre part, malgré son patrimoine culturel et architectural important, et son potentiel touristique reconnu, la ville attire moins de visiteurs que les principales destinations touristiques marocaines, notamment à cause du manque d'infrastructures hôtelières. Plusieurs chantiers sont en cours qui permettraient d'augmenter sa capacité d'accueil de 25 %.
Les habitants de la ville se nomment M'kansa (M'knasi au singulier) en arabe marocain et Ayt M'knas ou Imeknasn en berbère.

Fondation
Fondée au XIe siècle par les Almoravides en tant qu'établissement militaire. Les Almoravides construisent une forteresse appelée Takrart jouxtant les villages et jardins au XIe siècle ; c'est le noyau de la future médina de Meknès qui vit progressivement l'installation de population issue des bourgades voisines.

Moyen Âge
La ville, accusée de résistance, est saccagée par les Almohades en 1150 durant leur bataille pour garder le pouvoir contre les Mérinides. Seuls quelques minarets et murs subsistèrent, mais les Almohades entamèrent la construction et la rénovation de plusieurs monuments, dont notamment la Grande Mosquée de la ville. Après leur prise de pouvoir, les Mérinides installent leur capitale à Fès et firent construire plusieurs édifices à Meknès, dont le plus notable est la Medersa Bou Inania. Meknès devint le lieu de villégiature privilégié de leurs vizirs. Après la chute des Mérinides, la ville entre dans une période de déclin.

XVIe – XVIIIe siècles
À la mort du sultan alaouite Rachid ben Chérif, son frère et gouverneur de Meknès, Ismaïl ben Chérif, lui succéda en tant que deuxième sultan de la Dynastie alaouite. Il fera de la ville sa capitale. Sous son règne de cinquante-cinq ans (1672-1727), il érigea des kilomètres de murailles autour de la ville, avec des portes impressionnantes, des mosquées, le bassin d'eau du Sahrij Souani également nommé Bassin de l'Agdal, des galeries marchandes, des écuries pouvant abriter 600 chevaux et des palais. La ville s'étendit alors en dehors de sa médina. 30.000 esclaves et 3000 prisonniers chrétiens capturés en mer durant son règne contribuèrent à cet effort de construction.

Au XIXe siècle
Le comte de Mornay (1803-1878) y est envoyé en mission diplomatique par Louis-Philippe auprès du sultan du Maroc Moulay Abd er-Rahman (1778-1859). Il est accompagné par le peintre Eugène Delacroix.

Le protectorat français et l'indépendance
Pendant la présence française au Maroc (1912-1956), Meknès porte d'autres surnoms tels que « le Versailles du Maroc », ou « le petit Paris », soulignant la beauté de la cité, ce qui lui valut son titre de plus belle ville impériale du royaume ; elle fut un moment le siège de la résidence du Maréchal Lyautey qui y avait son quartier général.
En 1937, l'eau de l'oued Boufekrane, qui arrose la ville, est détournée au profit de 4 colons français, provoquant le mécontentement populaire : une manifestation est réprimée par les troupes françaises le 1er septembre, faisant 10 morts.
Le quartier le plus populaire est celui de l'ancienne médina dite « Mdina al-qdima », soit ville ancienne en darija, dialecte arabe marocain; c'est là qu'habitait Moulay Ismaïl.

L’accord diplomatique de Rabat du 28 mai 1956, qui stipule que ni la France ni le Maroc ne mèneront de politique contraire aux intérêts de l'autre partie au traité, devient rapidement inapliquable en ce qui concerne la guerre d'Algérie, l'État comme la population marocaines se sentant solidaires de leurs voisins en guerre pour l'indépendance. L'arrestation de Ben Bella provoque de nombreuses manifestations au Maroc. Les plus graves ont lieu à Meknès. Le 23 octobre, 200 Marocains et Algériens manifestent, chantant des slogans pour la libération de Ben Bella et l'indépendance de l'Algérie. Un coup de feu part et tue un garde municipal. Son origine est mal élucidée : il peut s'agir d'un Français qui aurait tiré sur la manifestation de sa terrasse, ou d'une maladresse du garde qui se serait tué avec son arme en repoussant un manifestant d'un coup de crosse. Mais, dans l'atmosphère échauffée d'alors, la présence de 6000 Algériens dans la région et le fait que les terres agricoles appartiennent essentiellement à des étrangers, la manifestation tourne à l'émeute. Elle dure six jours, pendant laquelle plusieurs fermes ont incendiées, 53 Européens sont tués et 39 blessés. Parmi eux, figurent six policiers français du poste de Bar Baroud à l'entrée de la médina, tués par leurs collègues marocains. Bien que quatre condamnations à mort soient prononcées, et d'autres personnes condamnées à de la prison à perpétuité ou des travaux forcés, la répression est jugée trop légère par la France.

Géographie
Topographie
Meknès est située à environ 500 mètres d'altitude, sur le plateau de Saïss, entre le Moyen-Atlas au sud et les collines pré-rifaines au nord.
La ville est traversée par l'oued Boufekrane, qui sépare la médina de la ville nouvelle, dite « Hamria »).

Climat
La ville de Meknès connaît un climat méditerranéen dégradé, subissant les influences continentales pendant les saisons d’été et d’hiver. Cependant, la diversité géographique de la région fait que chacune de ses zones naturelles présente des nuances climatiques particulières.
Le régime thermique de Meknès est marqué par l’éloignement des côtes maritimes atlantique et méditerranéenne, d’où une importante amplitude thermique atteignant 25,4 °C. La température du mois le plus chaud varie entre 30 °C et 45 °C, et celle du mois le plus froid varie entre 0 °C et 7 °C mais il arrive que le gel soit fort, comme le 27 janvier 2005 où il a fait −10 °C.
Généralement, les températures varient de la manière suivante :

de janvier en avril : la hausse mensuelle de la température est progressive et régulière. Elle est de l’ordre de 1 à 2 °C/mois ;
d’avril en août : une hausse mensuelle est de l’ordre de 3 à 5 °C. La température maximale mensuelle est atteinte au mois août, soit 45,6 °C ;
d’août à décembre : une baisse de l’ordre de 2 à 5 °C par mois. La répartition des pluies au cours de l’année se caractérise par de fortes pluies en automne, une très légère baisse en hiver avec un maximum relatif au début du printemps.
L’été est généralement sec, la période de pluie la plus importante s’étale d’octobre à mai, avec un nombre de jours avec pluie mensuel de 7 à 10 jours. Le nombre annuel moyen de jours avec pluie est estimé à 70 jours et le cumul pluviométrique annuel de Meknès avoisine les 576 mm.

Démographie
Meknès est l'une des quatre villes impériales du Maroc. La ville historique de Meknès regroupant la médina et la ville impériale, est classée depuis 1996 Patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO et connait depuis lors diverses opérations de restauration des sites (murailles, portes, ruelles, places publiques…). Elle est maintenant digne des plus grandes villes méditerranéennes et arabes, du fait de sa diversité culturelle. La fameuse place Lahdim a connu, en 2007, deux opérations de restauration et rénovation.

Lors du recensement de 2014, la population de l'agglomération urbaine de Meknès, comprenant les municipalités de Meknès, Al Machouar, Ouislane et Toulal, était de 632 079 habitants. En 2004, elle était de 528 740 habitants.En 2021, elle est estimée à 720000. La population est répartie sur les 4 municipalités formant l'aire urbaine de Meknès comme suit :

Cette population qui travaille pour la plupart à Meknès fait la navette quotidienne avec le centre-ville, qui abrite la quasi-totalité des administrations de la région Meknès-Tafilalet, grâce à la nouvelle société de transport urbain de bus. Ils sont également desservis par des taxis. La zone rurale est liée à la ville par le réseau de transport de bus dans un périmètre d'environ quarante kilomètres autour de Meknès. C'est une ville où la population est majoritairement jeune ce qui fait que la création artistique – notamment la musique – y a une place importante. La langue la plus courante est le Darija marocain. Les secteurs du tourisme, de l'artisanat et du commerce sont le noyau de l'économie locale et connaissent depuis quelques années un véritable essor ; la rénovation des différents sites touristiques de la médina de Meknès y est pour beaucoup.

Monuments et centres d'intérêt
Meknès est l'une des villes les plus riches de monuments historiques mais fut l'une des plus économiquement pauvres villes au Maroc
Le patrimoine historique de Meknès a été reconnu comme tel depuis le début du XXe siècle et fait partie des monuments, sites et zones classés "patrimoine national" au Maroc. Au XVIIe siècle, le sultan alaouite Moulay Ismaïl décide de faire de Meknès l’une des plus belles et des plus puissantes cités impériales du Maroc. Aujourd’hui encore, protégée par une quarantaine de kilomètres de murailles, elle a conservé d’imposants monuments, dont de nombreuses mosquées qui lui valent le surnom de « ville aux cent minarets »[réf. nécessaire]. Parmi elles, la Grande Mosquée, probablement fondée au XIIe siècle, est remarquable par ses portes aux beaux auvents sculptés. Sa médina et les vestiges du palais royal ont valu à Meknès d’être classée au Patrimoine mondial de l’Unesco.

Économie
Meknès est surtout une ville touristique. L'infrastructure hôtelière a connu ces dernières années une croissance rapide, ainsi que celle des maisons d'hôtes traditionnelles appelées « riads ».
La ville est très connue pour son artisanat très riche, dont le savoir-faire est jalousement gardé et transmis de génération en génération. Meknès est également riche d'une agriculture développée. En avril 2019, dans sa strategie de développement du tourisme, le Conseil préfectoral du tourisme (CPT) de Meknès lance “VisitMeknes”, une application mobile destinée aux touristes.
Aujourd'hui, Meknès est devenue un nouveau hub des équipementiers automobiles. À partir de 2016, la ville a connu l'ouverture de plusieurs usines comme Yazaki, Delphi, Yura et Lear Corporation … qui sont répartis sur des zones industrielles différentes dans la ville. Sans oublier de mentionner que Meknès comporte 3 zones industrielles: Mejjat, Sidi Slimane Moul Lkifane et la zone de l'Agropolis qui est bien équipée et qui est la plus grande zone industrielle de la région, elle comporte également 6 quartiers industriels : AIN SLOUGUI (18 ha), Route MY DRISS (40 ha),LAFARGE CIMENTS (300 ha), SIDI SAID (13 ha) Route d’EL HAJEB (120 ha), Route d’AGOURAI (13 ha); et 2 zones d'activité commerciale (Oujah Arouss et Borj My Omar). Englobant au total 231 établissements industriels en 2018. Une nouvelle zone industrielle est prévue au quartier Ouislane sur 65 Ha. Elle se positionne ainsi comme la ville avec le plus de foncier industriel au niveau de la région Fès-Meknès; L'Agropolis va sûrement aider à réussir le projet de Meknès, qui est en passe de devenir un grand pôle économique, à proximité de l’axe autoroutier Oujda-Casablanca.
La ville fait ainsi office de pôle agricole national et dispose d'une zone industrielle de 140 hectares dédiée au secteur de l'agroalimentaire, en plus d'abriter plusieurs grands groupes du secteur au Maroc comme LCM-Aïcha et Les Huileries de Meknès. La ville accueille également le Salon international de l'agriculture au Maroc (SIAM), rendez-vous annuel qui attire plus d'un million de visiteurs, en plus de servir de siège à des institutions agricoles régionales (Direction Régionale de l'Agriculture et Chambre d'Agriculture de la région Fès-Meknès, Centre Régional de la Recherche Agronomique) et nationales (École nationale d'agriculture de Meknès). La viti-viniculture du bassin de Meknès est la plus importante du Maroc.

## Overview
Meknes (مكناس) is a city in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco. Meknes is a vibrant, modern city bustling with nightlife, restaurants and an impressive imperial city created in the 17th century by King Moulay Ismaïl, with numerous historical monuments and natural sites; it is also the nearest city to the Roman ruins of Volubilis (Oualili).

## Understand
Is Fez driving you nuts? Nearby Meknes is relatively ignored by most tourists. It's also free of the usual hassles (touts, faux guides, etc.) that plague the other tourist centers. The prices in Meknes are among the most reasonable.

## By train
Meknes is on the Fès-Rabat railway line and has two train stations. The smaller one called 33.8996-5.54561 Gare de Meknès-Amir Abdelkader is more centrally located in the new town (ville nouvelle) and closer to the medina, while the bigger 33.8966-5.53192 Gare Meknès-Ville is a bit further east.
Meknes is connected by train to most major cities like Marrakech (6½ hr, 174 dirham), Tangier (3½ on trips involving a transfer at Kenitra or 4½ hr for the direct trips, 85 dirham), Rabat (2¼ hr, 69 dirham), Casablanca (3¼ hr), Fes (40 min, 20 dirham) or Oujda (6 hr, 130 dirham). Specific times and prices can be found on the website of the Moroccan National Office for Railways[dead link].

## By bus
While the bus is slightly cheaper, buses are quite difficult to navigate, because they are, in the majority of cases, very crowded and operate to transport people between agglomerations and the ville nouvelle and Medina.

## By grand taxi
Grand taxi arrive and leave from several places, the most popular being El-Amir Abdelkader train station. Opposite the road of the Institute Français is also a quite large taxi rank.
33.89921-5.553515 Grand taxi stand to Volubilis.    .

## By car
Meknès is on Autoroute 2 (Rabat-Fès), which continues further east on N6 to Oujda.
Road N13 goes over the mountain range to Tetouan and Tangier or Ceuta to the north, in the northbound direction it goes to Azrou and At-Rachida.

## Get around
Hamrya is a new town with all entertainment facilities. You can find all what you need there, but there is no monuments or things to see except if you like to chat with people. Medina is the other side is the ancient Meknes and it contains all the monuments of this wonderful city.

## By taxi
Petit taxis (small blue cars of Fiat Uno or Peugeot 205 brands) abound, as well as an efficient and comprehensive, if cramped local bus service. The minimum cost for a petit taxi is 5 dirham (the price is calculated based on 1.40 dirham + 0.20 dirham/100 m but you should expect a surcharge of 50% after 20:00).

## On foot
The ville nouvelle (new town), which is known as Hamrya in Arabic, is easily navigated on foot, as is the medina. The two sides of town are connected by a bridge over the dry Oued Boufekrane (river), with a McDonald's placed in between for weary (or wary!) travelers.

## Do
Public swimming pool. There is a very popular public swimming pool between the medina and the new city, on a hot day it is a godsend. (updated Jul 2017)

## Buy
Meknes is not a shopper's paradise, but it is certainly cheaper than nearby Fez. The medina is chock full of traditional Moroccan clothing and rugs, as well as the popular Moroccan shoe, bilgha.. It is also known for its metallic articles; the local artisanal speciality. The best way to enter the medina is at the back of Place Hedim, next to Dar Jamai. Herein you can find many shops catering to tourists. If you sojourn a bit deeper into the medina, you'll find plenty of unique shops selling jewellery, household goods and other treasures.
Be sure to bargain! Don't accept the shopkeeper's first offer: not only does it ruin it for tourists who come after you, but it also goes against Moroccan custom. The easiest way to bargain, particularly without knowledge of French or Arabic, is to offer half of the given price (or 75% for expensive or large-scale items). From there, the shopkeeper will go down a bit; you are expected to raise your price slowly until you come to an agreement.
If you can't agree on a price, try walking out of the shop as this will generally lower the price significantly. And try not to be too stingy: the value of an item is your appreciation of it, not its price.

## Eat
The market near the main place in the medina (at the Bab El-Mansur) has incredible fresh products. Lots of different kinds of olives, sweets, pickles, etc.
In Ville Nouvelle there are dozens of restaurants and snack bars lining the main road, Rue Antsirape offering the staples of harira, tagine, cous cous and of course rotisserie chicken. A few restaurants on Rue Ghana, just off Rue Antsirabi, are popular with travellers and offer 40-dirham set menus.

## Budget
Most budget hotels are along Rue Rouamzine, just before the medina. Hotel Maroc and Hotel Regina are two such choices. Hotel Regina is very dirty and stinky, but very cheap.
33.9034-5.557511 HI-affiliated youth hostel, Boulvard Okba Ben Nafii (near Hotel Transatlantique), ☏ +212-535-401020. Wedged between the medina and ville nouvelle, just two doors down from the much swankier and well known Hotel Transatlantique. In the new city, it is 1½ km from the closest medina gate; in fact it's not really near anything and you lose whatever you save staying here on a taxi (8 dirham) coming or going. For the same price, Hostel Maroc is better. They do let anyone use the shower for 7 dirham though. Dorms from 70 dirham for HI members (+20 if you aren't, and they don't honour E-memberships), 160 dirham for a double room w/ shared bathroom.    (updated Feb 2018)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bab Mansur al-'Alj or Bab Mansour (also variously spelled as Bab Mansour al-'Ilj, Bab Mansour al-Eulj, Bab el-Mansour, Bab Mansur, etc.) is a monumental gate in the city of Meknes, Morocco. Located on the south side of Place el-Hedim (el-Hedim Square) in the old city, it was originally the main ceremonial entrance to the Kasbah (royal citadel) of Sultan Moulay Isma'il, built in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Today it is one of the most famous and admired landmarks in the city.

History
Begun in the later years of Moulay Isma'il's reign, the gate was finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. The gate's purpose was more ceremonial than defensive, aiming to impress visitors. Its name comes from the architect and designer of the gate, Mansour al-'Alj (the "Victorious Apostate"), a former Christian slave who converted to Islam. Another ornate gate, Bab Jama' en-Nouar, also stands a short distance to the southwest along the same wall. It has similar decoration to the larger Bab Mansour and is believed to also date from the time of Moulay Isma'il.

In the early 19th century, Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman added a loggia-type structure just outside the gate on the right (southwest side), which is no longer present today. The structure served as a meeting place for military and high-ranking officials, as well as the tribunal of the city's governor, and for holding various military or religious ceremonies. Today the gate is usually closed but its interior is sometimes open to host exhibits.

Architecture
The overall design of the gate is based on Almohad prototypes (such as Bab Agnaou and the gate of the Kasbah of the Udayas), with a large horseshoe-arch opening and flanking bastions, but also presents significant new features. In particular, the flanking square bastions or towers are supported on four thick squat columns at the corners with horseshoe arches between them, creating a hollow loggia at the base of the towers. Further out to the sides, flanking the bastions, are massive marble columns supporting large projecting pilasters above. The columns, with ornate composite order capitals, are of ancient Roman origin, probably from the nearby site of Volubilis. Inside, the gate's passage is bent, turning 90 degrees twice, and bridges the distance between the double walls of the Kasbah, granting access to Place Lalla Aouda beyond.
Almost the entire facade of the gate, including the flanking bastions, is covered in heavy decoration. This consists of a repeating darj-wa-ktaf motif (stylized lozenge-like pattern in Moroccan architecture) which frames the main archway of the gate and fills the spaces above the columns of the flanking bastions. The empty or negative spaces within this motif are entirely filled with colourful polychrome zellij (mosaic tilework), another feature which was new to Moroccan monumental gateways. The spandrels of the arches are filled with arabesque-painted tiles. At the very top of the gate, above the other decoration and running along its entire length, is an elaborate Arabic inscription painted on tiles which describes the construction of the gate, which in turn was topped by small "saw-tooth" merlons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chefchaouen (Arabic: شفشاون, romanized: Shafshāwan, IPA: [ʃafˈʃaːwan]) is a city in northwest Morocco. It is the chief town of the province of the same name and is noted for its buildings in shades of blue, for which it is nicknamed the "Blue City". It is situated in a mountainous region in northern Morocco, between Tétouan and Ouazzane.
It was founded in 1471 by the Moulay Ali Ben Rachid, a distant descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The original settlement consisted of just a small fortress, now referred to as Chefchaouen’s Kasbah. The fortress was erected to help defend the area from potential attacks by Portuguese invaders; at the time, Portugal was launching attacks against northern cities and towns in Morocco.

Etymology
The name "Chefchaouen" is of Arabic and Berber origin coming from "Chef” (Arabic: شاف, romanized: shāf), a derivation of the Arabic word “to look”, and the Berber term “Echaouen", meaning “antlers” or “horns” and is a term used to indicate the peak of mountains. Chefchaouen thus means 'look at the horns', referring to the two mountain peaks overlooking the area. Nowadays, Chefchaouen is known as "the Blue Pearl" of Morocco, known for its traditional houses painted in blue and white.

History
The city was founded in 1471 (876 AH) as a small Kasbah by Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a descendant of Abd al-Salam ibn Mashish al-Alami and Idris I. Al-Alami built the Kasbah to defend against Portuguese invasions of northern Morocco. Along with the Ghomaras of the region, many Andalusi Muslims, Moriscos and Spanish and Portuguese Jews settled here during and after the Reconquista, when Spanish Christians conquered what remained of al-Andalus, the Muslim-controlled parts of the Iberian Peninsula.
Ali Ben Rashid was born in Gherzoim, a nearby village, c. 1440 (844 AH). He went to Emirate of Granada in 1460 and distinguished himself in battle against Christian forces. He settled in Chefchaouen c. 1465 and, due to his experience as a warrior, was chosen as successor to his cousin ibn Abi Jum'ah and leader of the mujahideen in the northwest of Morocco. He fought alongside the emir of Tétouan, Ali al-Mandri, who married his daughter, the Mujahida Aisha al-Hurra. The latter, known by her title, Sayyida al-Hurra, ruled Chefchaouen through a rapid period of growth and development.
Pressures of the Reconquista and the fall of Granada in 1492 led many of its people to immigrate to Morocco over several centuries. The last Moriscos (descendants of Muslims) were expelled from Spain by Philip III in 1609. Some of these refugees chose to settle in the large cities of Fes, Marrakesh, Tlemcen, Tunis, and Kairouan, while others settled in the jihadist fortress of Chefchaouen, which was in a fierce war against Portuguese armies. They established their quarters on the rugged slopes of the mountains and built their own residential quarters in the Andalusi architectural style, very similar to the traditional quarters of Granada. In a few decades, the fortress of Chefchaouen turned into a prosperous new city, in which the Andalusi-Granadan culture merged with the culture of the Ghomaras. The urban expansion included military fortifications such as walls with about ten gates and the construction of several mosques including the Great Mosque. The Andalusi community that settled in the city also included several well-known poets and philosophers.
In October 1920, General Dámaso Berenguer occupied the city for the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. Following the Spanish retreat from the city, Chefchaouen was part of the Republic of the Rif led by Abd el-Krim from 1924 to 1926. In September 1925, in the middle of the Rif War, a rogue squadron of American volunteer pilots, the Lafayette Escadrille, bombarded civilians in the city. Colonel Charles Sweeny had proposed the idea to French Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, who "warmly welcomed the Colonel's request." After el-Krim was defeated with the help of the French, he was deported to Réunion. The Spanish Army retook the city in 1926.
Morocco gained its independence from colonial rule in 1956. Chefchaouen and most of the northern parts of the country were ceded by Spain that year.

Geography
The city of Chefchaouen is located at about 600 metres (2,000 ft) above sea level in the foothills of the Kaʻala mountain in the western part of the Rif mountain range, in northwestern Morocco. The city consists of a Medina, the historical walled town, and a new town that has grown outside the former city walls.

Demographics
According to the last census of the Moroccan population (2024), the municipality of Chefchaouen had a population of 46,168.

Culture
Chefchaouen is located in a territory traditionally inhabited by Jebala, subsequently joined by Muslim and Jewish refugees from al-Andalus and Spain. The city has maintained strong relations with the inhabitants of the Jbala Region such as Akhmas, Ghomara, Ghazaoua, and Sanhaja tribes, particularly in terms of trade. The federations of these tribes were sometimes a source of strength, and sometimes a weakness due to their frequent struggles to take possession of assets such as water sources, grazing areas, and fertile land.
The traditional houses of Chefchaouen were made of stone, brick, tile, wood, soil, and lime. Each house had an open yard in the center surrounded by corridors and bedrooms. The yards are often decorated with fruit trees such as oranges, lemons, berries, and grapes, as well as some perfumed shrubs including night-blooming jessamine (Cestrum nocturnum) and jasmine (Jasminum officinale). From a physiognomy perspective, the city is influenced by Andalusian architecture, such as the curved brick archways that strengthen the houses and decorate the narrow blue alleyways, the traditional water network, and the landscaping and care of plants inside houses and mosques. From a cultural perspective, many Chefchaouen families have conserved the art of Andalusian music, which has become the main ritual of Chefchaouen religious festivals and social ceremonies.

The rural landscape was characterized by a distribution of space according to intra- and intertribal relations. At the level of each dshar (low-density rural settlements), the houses are built around a mosque or a marabou and occupy the center of the concentric spatial structure of traditional agro-sylvo-pastoral systems. This spatial distribution of dshars is tightly associated with arable land and availability of water resources, with shifting cultivation limited to a diffuse strip of matorral shrubland and pasture that mark the transition to forests. However, this traditional agro-salvo-pastoral system has been deeply affected by multiple processes of modern socio-cultural and economic transformation.

Traditions
Chefchaouen's residents commit to religious and social rituals. The devout perform prayer together in the mosque or the zawiya (a Sufi shrine or religious complex). They also like to visit their families and friends on religious and social occasions. Some of the major religious and social occasions include:

Sha’banah takes place on the 15th of Shaa’ban (i.e. the 8th month of Hijri calendar). It is commonly known as the Day of Nusskhah, in which the tomb of Moulay Abd Salam Ben Mshish is visited, of particular observance by the students of msids (Quranic schools).
The night of Al-Qad is observed on the 26th of Ramadan, when the people encourage 7–10-year-old girls to fast. Families usually celebrate at home, but often parade following the afternoon prayer with the girls wearing wedding clothes.
Ashura is celebrated on the 10th of Muharram (observed by Jewish residents as Yom Kippur). Preparations begin after Eid Al-Adha when part of the Eid meat is dried as qaddid, and on Ashura is eaten with couscous by families, along with dried fruit (almonds, walnuts, raisins, and pistachios), dates and various traditional sweets. Children receive great attention and are often gifted traditional and modern items, including toys.
Mawlid Nabawi (Muhammad's birthday) is celebrated on the 12th of Rabii’ Al-Awwal. It is designated as Eid and involves the reading of the Quran and Muhammad's biography in mosques or at people’s homes. This night is also celebrated in the mausoleum of Ali Ben Rashid and the 13 zawiyas throughout the city. Couscous is served to the poor and prisoners. During this celebration, mass circumcision of children is carried out following the afternoon prayer, and gifts are distributed to their families.
Hakouzah Day is celebrated on 1 January of the agricultural solar calendar. It is observed by preparing and eating various traditional foods, in appreciation of the past harvest's bounty and the hope that the New Year will be better.
Despite the diversity of these ceremonies, observances of similar characters are present in almost all of Morocco.
In her annotated study on Storytelling in Chefchaouen Northern Morocco literary scholar Aicha Rahmouni published orally transmitted tales in Chefchaouen's form of colloquial Moroccan Arabic told by two storytellers, accompanied with transliterations and translations.

Economy
In 2020, Chefchaouen was included as a learning city in the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC). This network encourages policy discussion and mutual learning between its members, to forge collaborations and develop abilities and designs tools to support and identify progress.

Agricultural sector
Agriculture is an important sector of the economy in the Chefchaouen area, which is known for its large agro-pastoral component. A traditional subsistence agriculture is practiced there on the hillsides and in the valleys – olives being the main crop. Other traditional crops such as grape vines, almonds and figs are still cultivated, although cannabis monoculture has become more profitable than these with an increased influx of tourists in recent decades.

Industry and commerce
The industrial sector of Chefchaouen province remains very weak despite the province's potential with its availability of human and natural resources. The commercial sector is one of the main economic supports of Chefchaouen, bolstered by tourism activity and remittances from workers abroad. It is mainly focused on urban centers and the main rural communes and is based on the sale of traditional food products, construction materials, clothing, and household items. Commercial transactions become dynamic during summer, with the influx of tourists and the return of foreign workers to the province. The Rif region around Chefchaouen is also a center of cannabis production in Morocco.

Tourism
During the holidays, the city sees a considerable influx of Moroccan and foreign tourists, attracted by its natural landscapes and historical monuments. Tourism is largely seasonal, with 200 hotels in the province catering to an influx of European tourists in the summer. In 2018, the annual number of tourists visiting the city was estimated at 120,000. In the past, some of the city's tourism was also linked to the availability of good-quality, low-cost cannabis produced in the region. Tourism has since increased primarily due to the Medina's appeal. Authorities have also promoted the region's natural environment. A nearby attraction is the Kef Toghobeit Cave, one of the deepest caves in Africa.

Handicraft sector
The handicraft sector or traditional industry (e.g., sewing, cupping, blacksmithing, carpentry, needlework, and tanning) is the most common economic activity practiced by Chefchaouen's population and thus plays key a socio-economic role in this province. It is closely related to the tourism sector and includes a multitude of artisans (38 cooperatives and 688 artisan adherents in 2016) largely occupied in leather, textile, ironwork, and traditional carpentry. Wood products represent the best-selling artisanal product in Chefchaouen province, with 57.6% of products sold.

Landmarks
Chefchaouen's blue walls are a popular subject of interest. There are several theories as to why the walls were painted blue. One popular theory is that the blue keeps mosquitos away. The blue is said to symbolize the sky and heaven and serve as a reminder to lead a spiritual life. However, according to some locals, the walls were mandated to be painted blue in the 1970s to attract tourists.

Medina
The Medina is the historical district of Chefchaouen, where blue and white paint dominates the walls and houses. The Medina was enclosed by defensive walls and some of its historic gates are still preserved.

The heart of the Medina is Uta Hammam Square (or Place Outa Hammam), a market square surrounded by the most important buildings of the old town – the Kasbah, the Great Mosque, and a caravanserai – as well as various shops and cafés. The square was probably created by Moulay Muhammad (one of Ali ibn Rashid's sons) in the 16th century. It takes its name from a hammam (public bathhouse) in the northwest corner.
The funduq (caravanserai), near the northwest corner of the square, is the largest of the four caravanserais in the city, built to house merchants and travelers. The building consists of a courtyard surrounded by a multi-story gallery and rooms. Its architecture is simple, distinguished only by its tall entrance portal with a large pointed horseshoe arch.
To the southwest of the Kasbah is the Souika neighbourhood, one of the oldest in the city, established since the 15th century. Its name, meaning "Little Souk", derives from the presence of a market (qaysariyya) created here in its earliest days. This market area was originally marked off from the surrounding district and enclosed by its own gates, of which one archway remains.

A number of traditional fountains are located throughout the old city and provided water for its inhabitants. One example is the four-sided fountain at the center of the Uta Hammam Square. Its four façades are each decorated with a blind arch niche and the structure was originally topped by a dome. It has since been redecorated and repainted, with the dome replaced by a green-tiled roof. Another example is the Aïn Souika Fountain in the Souika neighborhood, an old wall fountain set behind an archway. The façade of the fountain is decorated with a blind arch framed by concentric multifoil decoration, topped by small blind windows above. A recent restoration most likely added the current tile decoration that imitates zellij.

Kasbah
The oldest part of the Medina is the Kasbah, the original citadel founded in the late 15th century by Ali ibn Rashid. The fortress consists of a roughly rectangular enclosure protected by walls built in rammed earth (pisé). The Kasbah originally had two entrances: one facing the main square and markets, another near the Great Mosque. These entrances have since been closed or repurposed and modern access is through an opening created in the 1930s.
The Kasbah's walls are reinforced by ten towers, also built in rammed earth, and an additional tower on the west side, built in rubble masonry reinforced with cut stone at the corners. The latter tower, which is taller and stands out from the rest, was probably built in the early 16th century by Moulay Muhammad. It has multiple rooms inside, some covered by brick domes. Its structure and function appears similar to some of the tower-residences of Nasrid architecture in Granada. Some old cisterns have been discovered on site, likely dating to the Kasbah's original construction and its early use as a residence.
Today, the Kasbah has been converted into a museum and its interior courtyard is occupied by a garden. The museum's exhibitions are focused on archeological objects and ethnography and they are located on the ground floor of a historic house in the northeast corner of the enclosure. The house was likely built in the late 17th century during the reign of Moulay Ismail, probably by Ali Errifi, the local governor.

Religious sites
The Great Mosque of Chefchaouen is the city's oldest and historically most important mosque, located at Place Outae Hammam at the heart of the Medina, close to the Kasbah. The Spanish Mosque is a disused mosque overlooking the town from a hill to the east. It was built by the Spanish in the 1920s and is now a popular lookout point.
Outside the city, the Mausoleum of Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami is dedicated to the patron saint of northern Morocco's Jebalah region, Moulay Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami. His tomb and the village surrounding it are roughly 50 kilometres (31 mi) northwest of Chefchaouen on the old road to Larache.

Ras al-Ma'
This water source is located just east of the Medina, outside its former walls. It was the original source of water for the city. The spot where the water emerges at the surface was once open but is now enclosed by a stone structure. Nearby and downstream are located an old mill, and a bridge, possibly from the 19th century, which links the two shores of the stream.

Chefchaouen ou Chaouen (en arabe : شفشاون, /ʃəfˈʃɑˑwən/ ; berbère : ⴰⵛⵛⴰⵡⴻⵏ, /ɑʃʃɑwən/) est une ville du nord-ouest du Maroc, bâtie à 600 m d'altitude au pied des monts Kelaa et Meggou, entre Tétouan et Ouazzane, sur la chaîne du Rif. Elle est le chef-lieu de la province homonyme. Sa population intra-muros est de 42 786 habitants.
Elle est mondialement célèbre pour les façades de ses bâtiments teintes de bleu et de blanc, pour lesquels elle est surnommée la « Ville bleue ». La ville a été fondée en 1471 par le chérif Moulay Ali ibn Rachid al-Alami, un lointain descendant du prophète Mahomet. La ville se composait alors d'une petite forteresse, qui constitue aujourd'hui la Kasbah de Chefchaouen. Elle a été érigée pour aider à défendre la région contre d'éventuelles attaques étrangères, essentiellement celles des Portugais qui lançaient alors des attaques contre le nord du Maroc.
Le nom de la ville provient du berbère achawen, signifiant « les cornes », en raison des sommets montagneux qui la dominent et l'entourent.

Histoire
Initialement instiguée en 1415, Chefchaouen est fondée en 1471 puis achevée en 1480 par le chérif Ali ibn Rachid al-Alami, de retour d'un séjour guerrier dans le royaume de Grenade. La ville accueille par la suite une population composée principalement d'Andalous et de Megorachim puis de Morisques et demeure interdite aux Chrétiens sous peine de mort. Seul l'explorateur Charles de Foucauld brava l'interdit en 1883.
Entre 1471 et 1561, la ville est gouvernée par la dynastie des Banou Rachid, descendants de son fondateur, nominalement vassaux des sultans wattassides الوطاسيين , et sera réunifiée au Maroc par les Saadiens السعديين.
La Grande Mosquée de Chefchaouen, El-Masjid El-Aadam, fut construite en 969 de l’hégire, 1471 de l'ère chrétienne, par le fondateur de la ville Ali ibn Rachid Alami. Cette mosquée fut chargée, outre la célébration des cultes, de l’enseignement des sciences humaines et islamiques.
En juillet 1883 l'explorateur français Charles de Foucauld est le premier Européen qui livre une description de la ville et de ses environs ; il souligne sa beauté pittoresque « avec son vieux donjon à tournure féodale, ses maisons couvertes de tuiles, ses ruisseaux qui serpentent de toutes parts, on se serait cru bien plutôt en face de quelque bourg paisible des bords du Rhin […] ». Grâce à lui on sait que la ville comptait alors entre trois et quatre mille habitants, parmi lesquels une dizaine de familles juives à la fin du XIXe siècle.
En 1920, les Espagnols s'emparent de Chefchaouen, laquelle sera ensuite bombardée par l'escadrille chérifienne, une unité de mercenaires américains souvent issus de l'escadrille La Fayette employés par l'armée française pendant la guerre du Rif, puis par les troupes de Franco. La ville ne fut rétrocédée au Maroc qu'en 1956, à la suite de l'abrogation du protectorat.

Géographie
La ville se trouve au pied du djebel Mezedjel, avec des crêtes en forme de cornes d'où elle tire son nom. Le djebel Beni Hassan se trouve en face, de l'autre côté de la vallée, à l'ouest, il se prolonge plus au sud et prend le nom de djebel el Akhmâs.
Chefchaouen a su tirer profit de son isolement à l'abri des montagnes, suffisamment à l'écart de la côte et donc des Portugais.

Religion
La population de Chefchaouen est musulmane de rite sunnite.
Chefchaouen compte un important patrimoine religieux : 20 mosquées et oratoires, 11 Zaouïas et 17 mausolées. Ceci lui a valu le nom de El-Madina Es-Saliha (la Ville sainte).

Climat
Tourisme
La province dispose, dans le domaine du tourisme, de potentialités importantes et diversifiées constituées de monuments historiques, de nombreuses plages de sable et de vastes forêts avec une faune et une flore très variées. Les principaux sites touristiques de la province sont :

la ville de Chefchaouen ;
la source de Ras El Maa (à 3 km de la ville de Chefchaouen) ;
l'ancienne médina avec la kasbah ;
les cascades et la mosquée de Cherafat ;
la forêt de Talassemtane ;
la grotte de Toughoubite ;
le pont de Dieu à Akchour
Avec son parc national de Talassemtane de près de 59.000 hectares, Chefchaouen est considérée comme un modèle de biodiversité. Le parc abrite 100 espèces d'oiseaux et 700 espèces de plantes dont de nombreuses variétés endémiques, comme le cèdre de l'Atlas mais surtout l'Abies pinsapo Marocana entre autres.

Patrimoine de l'Unesco
Le 20 novembre 2010, avec trois autres communautés méditerranéennes dont Soria en Espagne, Coron en Grèce et Cilento en Italie, la ville de Chaouen a été inscrite sur la Liste représentative du patrimoine culturel immatériel de l’humanité de l'UNESCO. Cette inscription a été rendue possible grâce à sa pratique alimentaire emblématique du régime méditerranéen : « celle-ci se caractérise par un modèle nutritionnel demeuré constant dans le temps et dont les principaux ingrédients sont l’huile d’olive, les céréales, les fruits et légumes frais ou séchés, une proportion limitée de poisson, des produits laitiers et viande, et de nombreux condiments et épices ».

Climat
La ville de Chefchaouen se situe à 600 m d'altitude. On distingue dans cette province trois variétés de climat :

La zone montagneuse au climat typiquement montagnard, pluvieux et froid en hiver et doux en été. Les précipitations y sont les plus importantes et varient entre 800 et 1 400 mm/an atteignant parfois 2 000 mm/an avec des chutes de neige même si celles-ci restent rares à 600 m.
Un climat semi-aride qui domine la zone côtière avec des précipitations qui varient entre 350 et 400 mm/an.
La zone Sud est caractérisée par un climat humide en hiver et sec en été avec des précipitations oscillant entre 900 et 1 300 mm/an.
L'été est parfois très chaud avec des températures atteignant ou dépassant 40 °C mais il est à noter que la région montagneuse bénéficie d'un climat tempéré caractéristique de la région du nord du Maroc et, l'hiver, il fait parfois très froid comme en 2005 avec −14 °C.

## Overview
Chefchaouen (شفشاون, also Chaouen, Chawen or Xaouen) is a gorgeous mountain city in northeastern Morocco.

## Understand
It's no wonder that tourists flock here — this humble town is the embodiment of almost every Moroccan cliché. The picturesque medina, set against the dramatic backdrop of the Rif Mountains, is filled with white-washed homes with distinctive, powder-blue accents, and the call to prayer rings out of several mosques around the town in chorus. If you've got a few days to relax from the rigors of travel, this is a good place to do it.
Tourism in Chaouen is also driven by its reputation as centre of the marijuana plantations region in North Morocco. Drugs are widespread and somehow tolerated, but touts trying to sell to tourists are also very annoying.
Spanish and French are most popular foreign languages.

## By plane
The nearest airports are at Tangier, Fez, Rabat, and Casablanca, while some flights go to Tetouan. From these you can take intercity buses to Chefchaouen. From Casablanca it also makes sense to use the low-priced high-speed train to Tangier and continue from there.

## By bus
There are frequent buses from Fez and Tetouan and also from Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, Tangier, Nador, and Al Hoceima. Enjoy the sales pitches of vendors who come onto the bus while you wait for more passengers at major stops.
Approximate bus timetable to destinations around Morocco (as of Jan 2017):
Tetouan - five CTM buses at 04:00, 14:15, 15:15, 18:30 and 20:30; 90 min. Twelve local buses at 06:45, 08:00, 08:15, 08:30, 08:45, 09:45, 11:30, 12:30, 14:45, 16:30, 17:00 and 17:30.
Tangier - four CTM buses daily, with stopover in Tetouan; 2½-3 hr. Four Nejme Chamal buses daily: 07:00, 10:00, 14:00, 15:15 and 18:00 and one local bus at 10:45.
Rabat - one CTM bus at 07:00, 4½ hr. Five local buses daily: 06:00, 07:30, 08:15, 09:15 and 12:45; 5-5½ hr.
Casablanca - one CTM bus at 07:00 (goes to Rabat first), 6 hr. Three local buses: 06:00, 7:30 and 09:00; 6-6½ hr.
Meknes - three buses, 06:00, 14:30 and 15:30, 4 hr. In the opposite direction buses leave Meknes at 05:00, 12:00, and 24:00. The 05:00 bus is direct while the other two buses stop in Dardara, about 8 km away from the city, so you have to take a petit taxi to Chefchaouen from there.
Fez - five CTM buses: 08:00, 11:00, 12:00, 14:15 and 23:45; 4¼ hr. These buses are often booked out days in advance. Other companies' bus departs at 07:00, 08:30, 09:30, 11:45 and 12:30.
If direct buses to Fez and Tetouan are not enough. There are more local buses plying the route from Fez to Tetouan/Tangier stopping at Derdara (8 km from Chefchaouen), where you can get into one of the frequent grand taxis for 5 dirham. This avoids the long uphill walk.
Berbered and Ketama - daily buses at 08:00; 3 hr.
From Ouzanne there are frequent buses, but none from El Knat el Kebir.
Ceuta - no direct buses go to Ceuta, so you'll have to first get to Tetouan, then get a city bus/grand taxi to Fnideq (town bordering Ceuta), from where either walk remaining 3 km to the border or get a shared cab (5 dirham).
35.16762-5.274831 Bus station (Gare Routière) (a 15-min walk from the medina, along Av. Mohamed V). 06:00-22:00. There are two main bus companies serving Chefchaouen: CTM and Nejme Chamal, plus a few smaller ones. All of them terminate/start from this station. Supratours coaches don't serve Chefchaouen, reaching only as far as Tetouan and Fes. Storing piece of luggage in a bus trunk cost 5 dirham, don't pay more. Bus station hosts ticket offices, basic shop, toilet and a cafe serving simple snacks.    (updated Jan 2023)
Getting there/away: there are usually a couple of petit taxis waiting for a customer at the entry, 10 dirham to get to the medina (as of Jan 2023). Otherwise it's 15 minutes walk uphill.

## By taxi
35.16767-5.275592 Grand taxi stand to Tetouan and Tangier (right next to the main bus station). The journey from Tangier to Chefchaouen takes about 2½ hr and takes you down some interesting mountain roads with lots of photo opportunities. About 70 dirham per person. At the same time private day trip from Tangier to Chefchaouen will cost about €100. Taxi to Oued Laou costs 30 dirham per passenger/200 dirham pr car, 1 hr, alternatively get a bus to Tetouan and hire a taxi/get on a bus from there. Taxi to Akchour waterfalls costs 30 dirham per passenger/150 dirham per car, 30 min.    (updated Jun 2023)
35.165323-5.2627993 Grand taxi stand to Bab Taza, Ouezzane. There are grand taxis outside of the Meknes Gare Routière (bus station) that will get you to Chefchaouen by way of Ouezzane. The taxi from Meknes to Ouezzane takes about 2 hr and costs 50 dirham per person in a full taxi (6 passengers). It takes about 2 hr from Ouezzane to Chefchaouen and costs 35 dirham per person. It's possible to travel with fewer than 6 people, though you'll have to pay the full fare for 6 people. These taxi drivers do not seem interested in overcharging tourists, and without negotiation you should be able to pay the standard fare that Moroccan passengers pay.    (updated Jan 2018)

## On foot
Chefchaouen is compact and easily walkable. This is what many people come here for.

## By guide/tout
If you are looking for sports or peaceful hiking tours, Chefchaouen is the ideal starting point to branch out in the villages and the surrounding mountains of the Rif with a local guide who knows well the region or just by yourself.

## By car
If you go to Chefchaouen by car, there are several small car parks on the perimeter of the ancient medina. Car parks are not signposted nor do they have meters, but are tended by people who would claim to be 'guardians'. The going rate seems to be 10 dirham per day—pay when you leave to avoid paying twice.
Also, parking is possible at these specific places:
35.168889-5.2608891 Plaza el-Majzen (Ave Hassan II), next to Hotel Parador
35.168889-5.2583062 Corner of Rue Jamaa Sebanin and Rue Sidi Ahmed El Ouafi (6 spaces), near the less touristy Bab El Ounsar gate
35.171667-5.2611393 Bab El Mahrouk gate (30 spaces), just outside, possibly more further away from the gate

## Medina
The medina is the focal point of interest for most visitors to Chefchaouen. Walking around the town with its whitewashed walls, decorated in this style by Jewish immigrants, can be a nice change to the hustle and bustle of the cities of Marrakech, Rabat, and Fez.
35.16854-5.261661 Kasbah, Outae Hammam square. 09:00–18:00. One of the first buildings constructed in the city in the Andalusian style. It includes emir's residence, a small mosque for the emir, a prison, a garden, a horse stable, dozens of towers and courtyard, which is green and almost alien amidst the mountain setting. 80 dirham for foreigners, 10 dirham for locals.    (updated Jun 2024)
35.1688-5.262412 Outae Hammam square. The biggest and the main square of the old Medina. Its name originates from 'outae' meaning "low ground or yard" and 'hammam' - traditional public bath or dove (hamama in Arabic). Its design is similar to the Andalusian public yards of Granada or Cordoba. It was a market before it became a tourist center surrounded by cafes and restaurants.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.1684-5.262363 Grand Mosque of Chefchaouen, Outae Hammam square. The oldest mosque (built in 1475-76) and the main historic Friday mosque of Chefchaouen. Off limits to non-Muslims.      (updated Jan 2023)
35.16806-5.263384 Souiqah quarter (Souq quarter). It's the second-oldest residential agglomeration of the houses of old Andalusian families. There are a large number of shops and stalls that sell local products.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.17173-5.256275 Ras El Ma (east of the medina). A water spring and a meeting point for local residents who come to cool off, chat and do their laundry (including carpets on sunny Sundays). There is a café above the spring with plastic chairs offering a nice change from the main square.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.168982-5.2636426 El Haouta square (Al-Hawta square). Small square with a traditional fountain in the middle.    (updated Jan 2023)

## Nearby
35.16554-5.255637 Jemaa Bouzafar Mosque (Spanish Mosque). A rarely used mosque overlooking the town from a hill behind Ras El Ma. It was built by the Spanish in the 1920s and is now a popular sunset view point. There is a trail leading to another mosque — 35.15706-5.250758 Lubar Al-Fawqi Mosque  further uphill.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.175011-5.2644969 Ecomuseum of Talassemtane National Park. Smallish museum showcasing fauna and flora of Talassemtane National Park. Introduces the park itself as well as provides with hiking maps. Free admission.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.172469-5.26704510 Hill of the Hotel Atlas. A good viewpoint on the town and the valley, especially on sunsets. It can be reached from the south gate of the medina (Bab el-Ain) by climbing the road coasting the medina on the west side until the east gate (Bab Souk), and then uphill, crossing the old cemetery on a rocky path.    (updated Jan 2023)

## Hikes
Take a hike through the scenic Rif Mountains. There is 35.17366-5.256661 a pathway leading up into the mountains just behind the Ras El Ma frequented by backpackers. Don't mind the vast marijuana plantations; the farmers and goat herders that work them are used to tourists and will either ignore you or try to sell you hash.
A strenuous hike up 35.1882-5.24972 Jebel al-Kalaa (the peak immediately overlooking the town) is fun, but can take up to 9 hours round trip and goes by (and if you're lucky/unlucky, through) big marijuana plantations. The route is not well marked (with white and yellow), and you might have to trail blaze for parts of it if you lose the trail. Start by following the road up the southeastern valley, from where you'll get a good view of town, and look for the markings up the mountain. Bring plenty of water, and some snacks. There a 35.1747-5.25883 viewpoint on the way to Jebel al-Kalaa which can be reached in 30 min counting from the city walls.
A two-day hike in the 35.130601-5.0828814 Talasemtane national park  via 35.1757-5.20031 Asilane to Akchour also starts up the big mountain on a 4WD track which goes of in the north of Chefchaouen just after the camping site. At the peak at about 1,800 m is a camping site. There may be snow even until April, so be prepared for cold temperatures. There are at least two water sources on the way up, so you'll not need to carry too much water. It's about 14 km until the gite in Asilane. The 4WD track continues until the next village from where one has to cross over a small valley, continue straight after passing a tomb-house and climb down the small path to the village of Inezgane. From there, a mule treck follows the river more or less closely and the gorgeous mountains, cliffs and breathtaking views. After a while the path goes down to the river over an ancient bridge and continues north, passing a source (although this one might dry up in summer) and eventually leads to the village of Akchour which has another Gite, but also cheaper accommodation. There are more tracks and gites in the area.
Do a 1½-hr hike in the mountains towards the 35.228359-5.1776815 The God's bridge (Pond de Dieu). After the dam, the path lies on the right side of the river and goes up the hill quite steep. The bridge was formed by the river floating underground and carving its way over millennia. There seems also be a way down at the river, so one can see the bridge from below. Don't try this in spring though, as after snow-melt or rain the river may be unpassable. To left over the river starts a path towards the cascades.
35.2389-5.16096 Petit cascades. Easy 40 min, 2 km (one way) hike.    (updated Jan 2023)
35.21832-5.138427 Grand Cascade D'Akchour. Moderate 6 km (one way) hike.    (updated Jan 2023)

## Hammams
Have a bath in hammam together with locals for 15 dirham (separate hours for men and women) or rent a private room just for yourself for 100 dirham per hour (as of Jan 2023). There are several hammams scattered around medina, one of them - 35.16954-5.265478 hammam.

## Workshops
Hassan's Workshop (In the eastern medina, between the old olive tree and Ras El Ma), ☏ +212 065 00717. 09:00-18:00-ish. Run by a tremendously approachable man called Hassan, it can be found towards the eastern end of the medina, between the old olive tree and the waterfall. Once you're in the vicinity, just ask for "El Taller de Hassan" and you'll be pointed in the right direction (or call ahead). He speaks fluent Spanish and good English & French, and is amenable to any peculiarities or requests you might have. He doesn't look for sales out of his workshop, as he makes good trade through the various local stores and a few overseas bulk buyers, but he enjoys making one-offs, which makes for wonderful craftsmanship, great prices and no hassle. Word of caution do not make him ship goods to you, they often "forget" it. (updated Mar 2015)
Gite Talassemtane Tours. Can organise pottery and gastronomy workshops. (updated Mar 2018)

## Buy
All the usuals are on offer in the medina — carpets, leatherwares, spices, metal wares, etc. If you're a seasoned bargainer you can probably get better prices in Fes or Marrakech, but Chefchaouen is undoubtedly a more pleasant place to shop. You'll also find plenty of hippie-wear aimed at budget travelers and marijuana tourists.
Chaouen is particularly renowned for leather artisans, and there are 4 or 5 workshops dotted through the town, whose goods you can find at many of the local stores and in the larger northern cities. Many of the craftsmen in Fes and Tetouan served their apprenticeships here. The choice in local stores is often limited to bags and purses, so if you're up for it take advantage of the workshops where you can tweak a standard design or come up with something entirely your own, even moving beyond traditional leather into snake, crocodile, lizard and more. They can make pretty much anything, from guitar straps and tobacco pouches, to handbags and jackets. It can take a couple of days to make the more complex designs, so head there on your first day.

## Eat
The local speciality is baissara, but you'll also find the usual staples such as tajine (vegetable stew with goat or sheep), harira (tomato soup), kofte (meatballs) and tagras (fish). The Moroccan salad is a salad of cucumber and tomatoes, while salada variada includes eggs. The region is also well known for olives and olive oil, and for goat cheese, which is sold on display in various shops.
Always busy restaurants near the Kasbah (Outa Hamman square) offer tajines starting from 40 dirham of somewhat subpar quality.
Local breakfast includes fried eggs, cheese, olives, Moroccan mortadella, bread and tea/coffee, all for 20-25 dirham. Pretty much any cafe will be happy to serve it.
Some stalls cook pancakes (baghrir) with honey and olive oil or butter, for 10-15 dirham.

## Stay safe
As Chefchaouen is on the edge of Morocco's marijuana growing region, touts desperate to extract money from travelers can be a serious problem. They can often be quite persistent, however, smiling, remaining calm, and politely refusing (repeatedly) will usually work.
Travelers hiking in the Rif Mountain area close to the town can run into the areas of marijuana production. While most of the growers may ignore you, some may offer to sell to you as well. While many travelers partake in or even come here specifically for the abundance of marijuana (hashish), understand that it is definitely illegal and there is nothing stopping you being proscecuted for buying, transporting, or smoking it.
On arriving in Chefchaouen, you may be met by touts at the bus station. They will claim the hotel you're looking for is closed or under restoration. Don't trust these at all and insist on going to your planned destination. They will probably try to take you to some cheap and low-quality hostel in the medina - but it is better to find the place by yourself, because if you arrive with touts, you'll be charged extra so they can get their commission. Touts will then insist that you follow them to their house in the medina, and there try to sell you a stash of dope for 300-500 dirham. Refusing to buy is not contemplated, nor safe, if you end up in such a situation, so just say no from the beginning and don't accept their "help".
The tap water in Chefchaouen is fed from local springs, so it's way cleaner than in other places in Morocco and is safe to drink. However, this does not mean your body will tolerate this water as well as treated tap water. Stick to bottled water if this is a concern.

Essaouira ( ESS-ə-WEER-ə; Arabic: الصويرة, romanized: aṣ-Ṣawīra), known until the 1960s as Mogador (Arabic: موغادور, romanized: Mūghādūr, or موݣادور, Mūgādūr), is a port city in the western Moroccan region of Marrakesh-Safi, on the Atlantic coast. It has 77,966 inhabitants as of 2014.
The foundation of the city of Essaouira was the work of the Moroccan 'Alawid sultan Mohammed bin Abdallah, who made an original experiment by entrusting it to several architects in 1760, in particular Théodore Cornut and Ahmed al-Inglizi, who designed the city using French captives from the failed French expedition to Larache in 1765, and with the mission of building a city adapted to the needs of foreign merchants. Once built, it continued to grow and experienced a golden age and exceptional development, becoming the country's most important commercial port but also its diplomatic capital between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century.
The Medina of Essaouira was designated by the UNESCO a World Heritage Site in 2001.

Name and etymology
The name of the city is usually spelled Essaouira in Latin script, and الصويرة in Arabic script. Both spellings represent its name in Moroccan Arabic, aṣ-Ṣwiṛa. This is the diminutive (with definite article) of the noun ṣuṛ which means "wall (as round a yard, city), rampart". The pronunciation with pharyngealized /sˁ/ and /rˁ/ is a typically Moroccan development. In Classical Arabic, the noun is sūr (سور, with plain /s/ and /r/), diminutive suwayrah (سويرة); this is the only form cited in all dictionaries of Classical Arabic. Hence, the spelling of the name in Arabic script according to the classical pronunciation is السويرة al-Suwayrah (with sīn not ṣād).
Until the 1960s, Essaouira was generally known by its Portuguese name, Mogador. This name is probably a corruption of Amegdul (Arabic: أمقدول, romanized: Ameqdūl), which was mentioned by the 11th-century geographer al-Bakrī. The name Mogador originated from the Phoenician word Migdol, meaning 'small fortress'.

History
Archaeological research shows that Essaouira has been occupied since prehistoric times. The bay at Essaouira is partially sheltered by the island of Mogador, making it a peaceful harbor protected against strong marine winds.

Antiquity
Essaouira has long been considered one of the best anchorages of the Moroccan coast. The Carthaginian navigator Hanno visited in the 5th century BCE and established the trading post of Arambys.
Around the end of the 1st century BCE or early 1st century CE, the Berber king of Mauretania Juba II established a Tyrian purple factory, processing the murex and purpura shells found in the intertidal rocks at Essaouira and the Iles Purpuraires. This dye colored the purple stripe in the togas worn by the Senators of Imperial Rome.
A Roman villa was excavated on Mogador island. A Roman vase was found as well as coinage from the 3rd century CE. Most of the artifacts are now visible in the Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah Museum and the Rabat Archaeological Museum.

Early modern period
During the Middle Ages, a Muslim saint named Sidi Mogdoul was buried in Essaouira, probably giving its origin to the name "Mogador".

Portuguese establishment (1506–1510)
In 1506, the king of Portugal, D. Manuel I, ordered a fortress to be built there, named Castelo Real de Mogador. Altogether, the Portuguese are documented to have seized six Moroccan towns and built six stand-alone fortresses on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, between the river Loukos in the north and the river of Sous in the south. Four of them only had a short duration: Graciosa (1489), São João da Mamora (1515), Castelo Real of Mogador (1506–10) and Aguz (1520–25). Two became permanent urban settlements: Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gué (modern Agadir, founded in 1505–06), and Mazagan, founded in 1514–17. Following the 1541 Fall of Agadir, the Portuguese had to abandon most of their settlements between 1541 and 1550, although they were able to keep Ceuta, Tangier and Mazagan.
The fortress of Castelo Real of Mogador fell to the local resistance of the Regraga fraternity four years after its establishment, in 1510.

During the 16th century, powers including Spain, England, the Netherlands and France tried in vain to conquer the locality. Essaouira remained a haven for the export of sugar and molasses and as an anchorage for pirates.

De Razilly expedition (1629)
France was involved in an early attempt to colonize Mogador in 1629. As Richelieu and Père Joseph were attempting to establish a colonial policy, Admiral Isaac de Razilly suggested they occupy Mogador in 1626, which he had reconnoitered in 1619. The objective was to create a base against the Sultan of Morocco and asphyxiate the harbour of Safi.
He departed for Salé on 20 July 1629 with a fleet composed of the ships Licorne, Saint-Louis, Griffon, Catherine, Hambourg, Sainte-Anne, Saint-Jean. He bombarded the city of Salé, destroyed three corsair ships, and then sent the Griffon under Captain Treillebois to Mogador. The men of Razilly saw the fortress of Castelo Real in Mogador and landed 100 men with wood and supplies on Mogador island, with the agreement of Richelieu. After a few days, however, the Griffon reembarked the colonists and departed to rejoin the fleet in Salé.
After these expeditions, France signed a treaty with Abd el-Malek II in 1631, giving France preferential treatment, known as "capitulations": preferential tariffs, the establishment of a Consulate, and freedom of religion for French subjects.

Foundation of modern Essaouira (1760–1770)
The present city of Essaouira was built during the mid-eighteenth century by the Moroccan King. Mohammed III tried to reorient his kingdom toward the Atlantic for increased exchanges with European powers, choosing Mogador as his key location. One of his objectives was to establish a harbour at the closest possible point to Marrakesh. The other was to cut off trade from Agadir in the south, which had been favouring a political rival of Mohammed III, and the inhabitants of Agadir were forced to relocate to Essaouira.
For 12 years, Mohammed III directed a French engineer, Théodore Cornut, and several other Moroccan and European architects and technicians to build the fortress and city along modern lines. Originally called "Souira" ("the small fortress"), the name became "Es-Saouira" ("the beautifully designed").
Thédore Cornut designed and built the city itself, particularly the Kasbah area, corresponding to the royal quarters and the buildings for Christian merchants and diplomats. Other parts were built by other architects, including Moroccan architects especially from Fez, Marrakesh, and Rabat. The harbour entrance, with the "Porte de la Marine", was built by an English renegade by the name of Ahmed el Inglizi ("Ahmed the English") or Ahmed El Alj ("Ahmed the Renegade"). Mohammed III took numerous steps to encourage the development of Essaouira including closing off the harbour of Agadir to the south in 1767 so that southern trade could be redirected through Essaouira. European communities in the northern harbour of Rabat-Salé were ordered to move to Essaouira through an ordinance of 21 January 1765.
From the time of its rebuilding by Muhammad III until the end of the nineteenth century, Essaouira served as Morocco's principal port, offering the goods of the caravan trade to the world. The route brought goods from sub-Saharan Africa to Timbuktu, then through the desert and over the Atlas Mountains to Marrakesh. The road from Marrakesh to Essaouira is a straight line, explaining the king's choice of this port among the many others along the Moroccan coast.

Jewish presence
Mohammed III encouraged Moroccan Jews to settle in the town and handle the trade with Europe. Jews once comprised the majority of the population. According to a French botanist visiting in 1867, Jews comprised half of Essaouira's population of 12,000. The city flourished until the caravan trade died, superseded by direct European shipping trade with sub-Saharan Africa. Changes in trade, the founding of Israel, the resulting wars with Arab states, and the independence of Morocco all resulted in Sephardic Jews leaving the country. As of 2017, Essaouira had only three Jewish inhabitants.
The Jewish quarter, called the mellah, contains many old synagogues. The town also has a large Jewish cemetery.  On 15 January 2020, King Mohammed VI visited Bayt Dakira, a Jewish heritage house, in Essaouira.

European trade and diplomacy
In the 19th century, Essaouira became the first seaport of Morocco, with trade volumes about double those of Rabat. The city functioned as the harbour for Marrakesh, as it was only a few days from the inland city. Diplomatic and trade representations were established by European powers in Essouira. In the 1820s, European diplomats were concentrated in either Tangier or Essaouira.

French interventions and Protectorate
Following Morocco's alliance with Algeria's Abd-El-Kader against France, Essaouira was bombarded and briefly occupied by the French Navy under the Prince de Joinville on 16 August 1844, in the Bombardment of Mogador, an important battle of the First Franco-Moroccan War.

Bombardment by the Confederate States Navy (1864)
In the spring of 1864, the Commerce Raider, CSS Georgia of the Confederate States of America's Navy arrived off of the coast of the City as a reprieve from a hard winter's sail. Upon arrival, the crew were able to lower a Cutter and bend oars towards the shore. Upon landing, the crew was greeted by hostile Moroccans who knew both who they were and that their government was hostile towards them, despite spoken neutrality. The officers were then forced, at gunpoint back towards the sea and into the boats from which they arrived. Back on the ship, Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury ordered a shot from the Georgia's ten inch turret gun, followed by a salvo bombardment. No Moroccan casualties were recorded, due to their retreat from the shore during the initial shot fired. This marked the only time that Confederate guns were fired anywhere besides North America.

French Colonial Empire
From 1912 to 1956, Essaouira was part of the French protectorate of Morocco. Mogador was used as a base for a military expedition against Dar Anflous, when 8,000 French troops were located outside the city under the orders of Generals Franchet d'Esperey and Brulard. The Kasbah of Dar Anflous was taken on 25 January 1913. In 1930, brothers, Michel and Jean Vieuchange used Essaouira as a base before Michel set off into the Western Sahara to try to find Smara.
France had an important administrative, military and economic presence. Essaouira had a Franco-Moroccan school, still visible in Derb Dharb street. Linguistically, many Moroccans of Essaouira speak French fluently today.

Recent history
In the early 1950s, film director and actor Orson Welles stayed at the Hotel des Iles just south of the town walls during the filming of his 1952 film adaptation of Othello. Beginning in the late 1960s, Essaouira became something of a hippie hangout.
The skala or fortified harbor was used as a filming location in the third season of the American TV series Game of Thrones, representing Astapor.

Geography
Essaouira is protected by a natural bay partially shielded from wave action by the Iles Purpuraires.  A broad sandy beach extends from the harbour south of Essaourira, at which point the Oued Ksob discharges to the ocean; south of the discharge lies the archaeological ruin, the Bordj El Berod. The Canary Current is responsible for the generally southward movement of ocean circulation and has led to enhancement of the local fishery. The village of Diabat lies about five kilometres (3.1 miles) south of Essaouira, immediately south of the Oued Ksob.
The Essaouira-Mogador Airport is located some 7 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) away from the town.

Climate
Essaouira's climate is semi-arid climate (BSk/BSh), with mild temperatures year round. The gap between highs and lows is small and summers are warm while winters are mild. Annual rainfall is usually 300 to 500 millimetres (12 to 20 in). The highest temperature ever recorded in Essaouira was 35.7 °C (96.3 °F) on 18 April 2017. The lowest temperature ever recorded was 2.2 °C (36.0 °F) on 29 January 2005. The lowest maximum temperature ever recorded was 11.8 °C (53.2 °F) on 15 February 2018. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded was 26.7 °C (80.1 °F) on 13 October 2017. The maximum amount of precipitation recorded in one day was 99.1 millimetres (3.90 in) on 8 March 2013.

Economy
The medina is home to many small arts and crafts businesses, notably cabinet making and 'thuya' wood-carving (using roots of the Tetraclinis tree), both of which have been practised in Essaouira for centuries.
The fishing harbour, suffering from the competition of Agadir and Safi, remains rather small, although the catches (sardines, conger eels) are surprisingly abundant due to the coastal upwelling generated by the powerful trade winds and the Canaries Current. Essaouira remains one of the major fishing harbours of Morocco.
Essaouira is also a center of argan oil production.

Education
There is a French international school in Essaouira, Groupe scolaire Eric-Tabarly.

Culture
Since 1998, the Gnaoua Festival of World Music is held in Essaouira, normally in the last week of June. It brings together artists from all over the world.  Although focused on gnaoua music, it includes rock, jazz and reggae. Known as the "Moroccan Woodstock" it lasts four days and attracts around 450,000 spectators annually.

Essaouira (anciennement appelée Mogador par les Portugais, en arabe : الصويرة aṣ-Ṣawîrah, en tachelhit : ⵜⴰⵚⵚⵓⵕⵜ  Taṣṣuṛt) est une ville portuaire du Souss et une commune du Maroc, chef-lieu de la province d'Essaouira, dans la région de Marrakech-Safi. Elle est située au bord de l'océan Atlantique et compte 77 966 habitants en 2014.
Bien que la région d'Essaouira soit habitée dès l'Antiquité de manière discontinue par les Phéniciens, par les Gétules à l’époque de Juba II puis par les Romains, ce n'est qu'à partir du XVIe siècle que le site est véritablement occupé par les Portugais, qui édifient en 1506 une forteresse, le Castelo Real, et des remparts rapidement abandonnés devant la résistance acharnée de la population locale.
La fondation de la ville d'Essaouira proprement dite sera le fait du sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah, qui lance sa construction à partir de 1760 et fait une expérience originale en confiant celle-ci à plusieurs architectes de renom, notamment Théodore Cornut, qui trace le plan de la ville, et avec pour mission d'édifier une cité adaptée aux besoins des marchands étrangers. Une fois bâtie, elle ne cesse de croître et connaît un âge d'or et un développement exceptionnel, devenant le plus important port commercial du pays mais aussi sa capitale diplomatique entre la fin du XVIIIe siècle et la première moitié du XIXe siècle. Elle devient également une ville multiculturelle et artistique.
La situation de la ville se dégrade considérablement entre la fin du XIXe siècle et le début du XXe siècle à la suite du bombardement qu'elle subit en 1844. Elle perd de son importance et n'est plus le port international et la capitale diplomatique du pays. Après l'indépendance, le départ de la communauté juive cause également des dommages économiques très importants à la ville.
Toutefois, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, Essaouira connaît une renaissance spectaculaire due essentiellement au tourisme, mais aussi à sa vocation culturelle. La médina d'Essaouira est inscrite au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 2001.

Toponymie
Essaouira connaît plusieurs appellations mais la plupart restent incertaines et leurs étymologies spéculatives. Il est possible que le comptoir phénicien des îles Purpuraires soit l'« Arambys » citée vers le Ve siècle av. J.-C. par l'explorateur Hannon, tirant son nom d'une racine phénicienne Har Anbin, qui signifie « mont de raisins », mais certains auteurs pensent qu'il pourrait s'agir plutôt de « Cerné » (ou Kerne), île dont la découverte clôture le premier voyage de l’explorateur, hypothèse toutefois largement contestée tant sont nombreux les sites candidats.
Au IIe siècle, l'historien antique Ptolémée mentionne l'existence d'une localité sur la côte atlantique de la Maurétanie Tingitane appelée « Tamusiga » par les Romains et située entre le « promontoire d'Hercule » et celui d'« Ursinum », sans qu'on en connaisse la localisation précise mais que certains commentateurs rapportent au site d'Essaouira, tandis que des recherches plus récentes penchent plutôt pour un site plus méridional appelé « Suriga » par l'historien romain.
Au XIe siècle, l'historien et géographe d'al-Andalus Abou Obeid el-Bekri fait état d'une certaine « Amogdoul ». Ce nom a peut-être une origine sémitique, issu du punique « Migdol » ou « Mogdoul » (MGDL) qui signifie « lieu fortifié » ou « tour de surveillance », à l'instar de sites antiques de la côte syro-libanaise.
Au début du XVIe siècle, avec l'arrivée des Portugais qui y construisent un « mauvais château », le site d'Essaouira connaît un nouveau souffle. Le diplomate et chroniqueur Louis de Chénier note, à la fin du XVIIIe siècle, que la ville est appelée « indifféremment Suera ou Mogodor », nom formé d'après un Sidi Mogdoul, saint régional dont le tombeau est alors encore visible au sud de la ville. C'est sur le nom de ce dernier que les Portugais auraient formé le nom de « Mogadouro ». Lors du protectorat français du Maroc, Mogador devient la dénomination officielle de la ville entre 1912 et 1956.
À l'indépendance, en 1957, le nom d'Essaouira est définitivement adopté. Deux interprétations sur l'étymologie de ce mot arabe se confrontent. La première suit la toponymie berbère Tassurt ou Tassort, fondée sur la notion de « muraille », qui se traduit en arabe par Sour dont le dérivé Souira peut désigner des murailles ou une enceinte mais sert régulièrement à désigner des ruines dans la région : le nom serait apparu après l'abandon du site par les portugais en 1510. Selon la deuxième, le nom Essaouira serait dérivé de Tasaouira et ses variantes (Atassouira, At'souira, Sawira, Saouira) qui signifie tableau, image, la dessinée rappelant la disposition de la ville : la bien dessinée, la bien tracée, la bien conçue.
Essaouira est communément surnommée la « cité du vent », la « cité des alizés » ou encore la « Saint-Malo marocaine ».
Al-Bakri a également mentionné Amogdoul (Essaouira) qu'il était situé à Souss et qu'il y avait là un port.

Géographie
Situation
Située sur le littoral atlantique, la ville d'Essaouira se trouve à 173 km au nord d'Agadir, à 174 km à l'ouest de Marrakech et à 406 km au sud-ouest de Casablanca. Elle est le chef-lieu éponyme de la province d'Essaouira, au sein de la région de Marrakech-Safi. La ville est délimitée au sud et à l'est par la commune de Sidi Kaouki, au nord par la commune de Lagdadra, à l'est par la commune de Aït Saïd et à l'ouest par l'océan Atlantique. Essaouira est reliée directement par la N8 et la P 2201.

Relief, géologie ou hydrographie
Essaouira se trouve dans une baie de 5 km grâce à une incurvation au sud, tandis que le littoral nord est rectiligne, formant un cap. Son synclinal, qui fait partie du bassin d'Essaouira, est positionné sur une zone de faible altitude. Son relief se compose d'une série de plateaux étagés où il faut s'enfoncer à 25 km pour pouvoir atteindre les 300 m. Ces plateaux sont orientés parallèlement au littoral suivant une direction méridienne. Le plateau d'Essaouira est limité au nord par le plateau d'Akermoud et au sud par le plateau des Ida Ou Groud. Plusieurs collines couvertes d'arganiers se trouvent à proximité de la ville.

À l'est de la ville, un massif dunaire s'est accumulé entre la ville et le talus ouljien, avec une très faible altitude, de 25 à 45 m. Le Moghrébien est la formation plio-pléistocène la plus développée, qui se compose de cinq systèmes dunaires. Elles mettent en jeu le facteur éolien et sont issues de la dynamique marine. Les systèmes maarifien, ouljien et pléistocène supérieur sont édifiés lors de phases climatiques tandis que les systèmes historique et actuel semblent consécutifs à l'anthropisation.
Pour l'alimentation en eau de la ville, les principales sources souterraines viennent des nappes du Villafranchien et du Turonien qui se trouvent dans le bassin d'Essaouira. La nappe du Turonien est difficilement exploitable en raison d'un coût élevé. Les eaux du Ksob sont également utilisées pour l'alimentation de la population et des terres agricoles des alentours. Le Ksob est un fleuve qui se situe à seulement quelques kilomètres au sud, un barrage y est construit. Lorsque de fortes pluies touchent les environs, ce fleuve provoque souvent des crues et des inondations dans la ville, pouvant occasionner beaucoup de dégâts, bien que des initiatives soient prises pour la construction de digues. Les îles Purpuraires, qui forment un archipel, se situent à seulement quelques centaines de mètres du rivage de la ville et sont la principale protection de la baie contre les puissantes vagues de l'océan Atlantique.

Faune et flore
Essaouira et ses alentours disposent d'une faune et d'une flore exceptionnelles, notamment présentes dans l'îlot de Mogador, et de paysages uniques.
Classé réserve biologique depuis 1980, l'îlot de Mogador est un site naturel et ornithologique très prisé. Il compte plusieurs espèces d'oiseaux tels que mouettes, goélands, grands cormorans, martinets pâles et grands corbeaux, mais il est surtout un lieu d'accueil pour les très rares 700 couples de faucons d'Éléonore qui viennent s'y reproduire entre avril et octobre avant de repartir pour la lointaine Madagascar. S'ajoutent à ces oiseaux quelques reptiles et lapins.
Contrairement à sa faune, la richesse floristique de l'îlot de Mogador reste pauvre ; en juin 2010, elle ne compte que 18 espèces recensées, relevant de 10 familles de plantes vasculaires à fleurs. Toutefois, elle compte 4 espèces floristiques à valeur patrimoniale.
L'arganier (argan) est la principale richesse floristique endémique à la région d'Essaouira. Il occupe une place très importante dans la région puisqu'il a un rôle à la fois environnemental et socio-économique. Pourvoyeur de bienfaits écologiques, cosmétiques et physiologiques, l'arbre permet de produire l'huile d'argan, réputée dans le monde entier. L'arganier permet de faire vivre près de 3 millions d'habitants dans le pays.

Climat
Le climat à Essaouira est très influencé par l'océan Atlantique nord et ses eaux froides à cette latitude.
Le climat est codé « BSk » voire « BSn » dans la classification de Köppen (la lettre « n » soulignant la présence de brouillards côtiers fréquents). Il s'agit d'un climat semi-aride doux.
Les conditions à Essaouira sont très comparables à celles que l'on trouve le long des côtes californiennes notamment à San Francisco avec un retard saisonnier très important (les mois les plus chauds sont septembre et octobre) en raison de l'influence de l'océan.
Sur une petite péninsule, la ville profite d'un climat doux tout au long de l'année et se trouve dans l'axe du courant des Canaries et des alizés.
Les hivers sont doux et légèrement pluvieux et les étés sont tout juste chauds, secs et sans chaleur excessive. Durant cette saison il arrive cependant de manière très exceptionnelle que les températures soient caniculaires lorsque les vents d'est venus du désert du Sahara soufflent fort et transportent du sable jusque sur la côte et même dans l'océan. Dans ces conditions, les températures deviennent alors torrides et peuvent même dépasser les 40 °C sous abri ce qui est rarissime.
Une fois l'épisode terminé les températures reviennent généralement à la normale, autour de 21 à 22 °C en journée de juillet à octobre.
La pluviométrie annuelle moyenne approche les 341 mm et l'ensoleillement annuel moyen est de 2 979 h. La saison plus pluvieuse s'étale d'octobre à avril et la saison sèche de mai à septembre. Les jours de pluie couvrent en moyenne 40 à 50 jours par an.

Histoire
Antiquité
D'après la tradition rapportée par Hérodote, après la fondation de Carthage en 814 av. J.-C., des marchands puniques se sont dirigés vers l'ouest, ont franchi les colonnes d'Hercule et longé la côte atlantique méridionale pour y installer des échelles, des comptoirs. Ils y nouent des contacts commerciaux avec les populations indigènes.
Plusieurs chercheurs identifient l'île de Cerné, décrite dans le Périple du navigateur et explorateur carthaginois Hannon, probablement au VIe siècle av. J.-C., à l'îlot au large d'Essaouira. Certains évoquent la fondation d'une colonie (ou le peuplement d'une colonie préexistante) par le navigateur carthaginois dès cette époque : protégée des alizés et riche en eau potable, elle aurait pu servir de poste avancé sur la route du cap Vert et de l'équateur.
L'archéologie atteste, en tout état de cause, d'une présence phénicienne remontant au milieu du VIIe siècle av. J.-C. sur l'îlot de Mogador, constituant la position phénicienne la plus méridionale actuellement découverte. C'est sur cet îlot distant d'un kilomètre de la ville actuelle qu'une campagne de fouilles sur la partie met au jour différentes strates d'occupation, phénicienne, berbère puis romaine. La strate phénicienne, qui est composée d'un petit établissement d'un hectare, livre, parmi de nombreux fragments de vases et de tessons phénico-chypriotes et grecs, un vase portant des graffitis qui constituent la plus ancienne inscription phénicienne trouvée au Maroc ; les fouilles révèlent un habitat sommaire qui pousse les chercheurs à envisager une occupation saisonnière et précaire du site dans ce « comptoir extrême », ni base permanente, ni simple escale.
Le site semble être abandonné à la fin du VIe siècle av. J.-C., puis à nouveau sporadiquement fréquenté au cours des IVe et IIIe siècles av. J.-C. avant de retrouver une occupation régulière à partir du règne du roi de Maurétanie Juba II, dans les dernières décennies du Ier siècle av. J.-C..

Depuis le IIIe siècle av. J.-C., les Berbères sont organisés en monarchie puis, en 146 av. J.-C., la région passe sous influence romaine à la suite de la troisième guerre punique. Rome fait de ce royaume un État client dont le souverain le plus illustre est Juba II. Ce dernier favorise l'installation de son équipage et le développement de l'industrie des salaisons et de la pourpre. C'est cette seconde activité (une production de teinture à partir d'une variété de murex, Bolinus brandaris) qui explique la renommée des îles Purpuraires au large d'Essaouira durant certaines périodes de la Rome antique. Cette couleur est synonyme d'un rang social élevé. Déclinée en plusieurs variantes, c'est en fait la seule couleur teinte et elle symbolise le pouvoir, tandis que le blanc a une symbolique religieuse.
En 42 ap. J.-C., Rome annexe le royaume berbère de Maurétanie pour le transformer en province romaine de Maurétanie tingitane. Le comptoir des îles Purpuraires semble à nouveau abandonné vers cette époque avant de retrouver une activité significative vers le début du IVe siècle. Les fouilles de l'îlot révèlent une villa romaine et une nécropole datant du Bas-Empire, un semissis attestant d'une présence romaine vraisemblablement jusqu'à la fin du Ve siècle.

XVIe – XVIIe siècles : Essaouira avant sa fondation
Au XIe siècle, l'historien et géographe d'al-Andalus Abou Obeid el-Bekri mentionne Amogdul comme étant un mouillage sûr et qui sert de port pour tout le Souss. À cette date, il n'y a aucune ville à cet endroit, en dehors d'un port situé dans les îles en face de la baie d'Essaouira.
Le Portugal, qui contrôle plusieurs villes le long de la côte atlantique, a rapidement des vues sur Mogador. Le sultanat wattasside, très affaibli, ne peut rejeter à la mer les puissances étrangères qui s'installent massivement sur son territoire. À partir de septembre 1506, le roi du Portugal Manuel Ier charge Duarte Pacheco Pereira d'édifier un « Castelo Real » (château royal) et un port commercial, une tâche qu'exécute Diogo de Azambuja qui avait déjà orchestré la construction du fort de Saint-Georges-de-la-Mine. Le but est tant économique que stratégique, puisqu'à cette époque, des navires de cent tonneaux fréquentent le port et l'île de Mogador. Pacheco signale dans sa lettre au souverain portugais l'hostilité des indigènes arabo-berbères qui tentent d'interrompre les travaux. Les remparts de Mogador sont ornés de canons, mais sa trop grande exposition la rend vulnérable. Devant la résistance acharnée de l'organisation maraboutique des Regraga et les affrontements incessants, les Portugais évacuent Mogador le 4 décembre 1510. Les pierres du Castelo Real serviront plus tard à la construction de la sqala du Port. Bien que très courte, la présence portugaise est toujours visible, notamment grâce aux remparts.
Par la suite, les Saadiens établissent de nombreuses sucreries, tant dans les alentours d'Essaouira que dans le reste du Maroc. Une importante sucrerie se trouve près d'Essaouira et fonctionne de 1578 à 1603, au bord du Ksob. Le sultan Ahmed al-Mansour expédie le sucre roux en Italie en échange de marbre de Toscane pour la construction du palais El Badi. Ce sont des esclaves noirs venus du Soudan qui travaillent dans les sucreries. Dès le début du XVIIe siècle, avec la mort d'Ahmed al-Mansour, s'amorce une guerre civile entre les différents fils du sultan pour le trône. La Castille a des vues sur Mogador et espère s'en emparer pour sécuriser la route des Indes et éviter que des corsaires ne s'y installent. Les Anglais, de leur côté, veulent s'emparer de Mogador pour en faire une base contre la Castille. Vers la même époque, les sultans Zaidan el-Nasir et Abd al-Malik II projettent de fortifier le Castelo Real pour éviter que les étrangers ne s'en emparent.

En 1629, l'amiral français Isaac de Razilly, dirigeant une flotte composée de sept vaisseaux : La Licorne, Le Saint-Louis, Le Griffon, La Catherine, Le Hambourg, La Sainte-Anne et Le Saint-Jean, bombarde la ville de Salé et détruit trois navires. Razilly envoie ensuite Le Griffon, sous les ordres du capitaine Treillebois, qui commande 100 hommes, encouragé par le cardinal de Richelieu, pour débarquer à Mogador et l'occuper. L'amiral français a déjà des vues sur Mogador et propose une expédition sur cette zone dès 1626, après une mission de reconnaissance en 1619. En 1628, Isaac écrit à Richelieu pour lui signaler la baie de Mogador. L’expédition française est abandonnée lorsque les Français s'aperçoivent que le Castelo Real est défendu par les Saadiens. Le navire français rejoint plus tard la flotte à Salé et un traité est signé en 1631 avec Abd al-Malik II. Les Français voulaient y organiser un comptoir et des pêcheries.
Toutefois, l'île et le rivage d'Essaouira restent à peu près déserts malgré les tentatives d'invasions étrangères, bien qu'en 1641, l'artiste Adriaen Matham, à bord d'un navire néerlandais, signale l'existence d'une kasbah abritée derrière les rochers où vivent les corsaires des Beni Antar. Mogador reste surtout un mouillage fréquenté par des navires seulement. Sous le règne du sultan alaouite Moulay Ismaïl, Mogador devient un port de refuge et une base de repli pour les corsaires qui y viennent pour réparer leurs navires.

Fondation de la ville nouvelle
En 1751, Mohammed ben Abdallah, alors khalifa de la Vice-royauté de Marrakech, propose à une compagnie danoise de s'installer dans l'îlot de Mogador dans le but de développer les relations commerciales avec l'Europe. Il devient en 1757 sultan du Maroc, après la mort de son père Abdallah ben Ismaïl. Choisissant Marrakech comme capitale, il décide de fonder Essaouira afin de disposer d'un port accessible toute l'année et bien défendu, contrairement aux ports du Nord qui, à cause de leur ensablement, sont inabordables en dehors de la saison des pluies. De plus, la distance entre Safi et Agadir est trop grande, laissant un grand vide et une côte non protégée face aux puissances étrangères, comme le démontre l'établissement portugais en 1506. C'est pour parer à cette éventualité que le sultan décide d'installer des fortifications dans la baie de Mogador et que, grâce à un environnement favorable, des batteries de canons à feux croisés sont installées.

Les premiers travaux pour la construction de la ville commencent en 1760. En 1764, le sultan Mohammed ben Abdellah fait appel à Théodore Cornut, un architecte français à la solde des Britanniques de Gibraltar. Le sultan le reçoit avec tous les honneurs dus à un grand artiste et lui confie la réalisation de la nouvelle ville « au milieu du sable et du vent, là où il n'y avait rien ». Cornut l'Avignonnais, disciple de Vauban et qui a été employé par Louis XV à la construction des fortifications du Roussillon, travaille pendant plusieurs années à édifier la kasbah et ses remparts, dont le plan original, établi en 1767, est conservé à la Bibliothèque nationale de France, à Paris. Cornut est congédié pour la construction des fortifications par le sultan à la suite de ses échecs. Le souverain marocain construit un chantier naval et, en 1768, 12 navires différents armés de 241 canons en tout sont présents au port. Après un premier plan établi par le renégat anglais Ahmed El Inglizi, en 1767, concernant le port et les fortifications de la sqala, l'entrée du port et Bab el-Marsa sont édifiés par le même renégat entre 1769 et 1770. La ville continue de s'agrandir avec le temps et plusieurs bastions et fortifications sont édifiés par plusieurs architectes, dont un Génois pour la sqala de la kasbah ainsi que plusieurs architectes marocains en ce qui concerne les remparts, les équipements civils de la médina et la Kasbah. Le sultan joue sur la distance entre les îles et la terre ferme de la baie pour pouvoir protéger chaque entrée de la baie, que ce soit celle du nord grâce à Borj el-Assa et Borj el-Baroude, ou celle du sud à l'aide de Borj Moulay Ben Nasser et de Borj el-Barmil, grâce à des batteries faisant feux croisés.
L'architecture militaire d'Essaouira suit plusieurs modèles : les remparts terrestres de la cité sont de style chérifien, semblables aux fortifications de Marrakech, les défenses maritimes sont de type européen, de style Vauban ou manuélien.

Âge d'or et développement
Pour encourager le développement d'Essaouira et pour concentrer le commerce du sud vers cette ville, le port d'Agadir est fermé en 1767. Le souverain Mohammed ben Abdellah ordonne à tous les Européens établis sur les autres villes de venir s'installer à Essaouira, et fait de la ville une capitale diplomatique. Il lève ensuite, en 1773, une armée en provenance de Marrakech pour mater la rébellion d'Agadir, hostile au sultan. Les fortifications de la ville sont détruites et le sultan oblige la population, qui compte plusieurs marchands juifs et chrétiens, à rejoindre Essaouira. Le quartier de derb ahl Agadir voit ainsi le jour. Mohammed ben Abdellah fait ensuite venir des marqueteurs et tanneurs de Marrakech, ainsi que des potiers de Safi. Le sultan crée ensuite un tribunal de commerce puis, en 1775, un atelier pour la frappe des monnaies chérifiennes dans la kasbah d'Essaouira.
La ville est touchée en 1799 par une violente épidémie de peste, causant la mort d'environ 4 500 personnes, faisant partir les chrétiens de la ville, en majorité protestants. Alors qu'en 1779, Essaouira est limitée à la kasbah où vivent l'administration royale et les consuls des pays européens, à la fin du siècle, la ville s'étend en dehors des remparts de la kasbah, dépassant la géométrie de la conception de la ville. Plusieurs tentes et casemates donnent ainsi un visage militaire à la ville. Le sultan renforce rapidement la garnison par l'envoi de nouvelles troupes : canonniers venant de Fès, renégats assurant l'artillerie, anciens corsaires des Beni Antar assurant la marine, mais aussi des combattants de la tribu arabe des Chebânat et des soldats de la garde noire des Abid al-Bukhari. En 1785, 2 500 soldats font d'Essaouira une « ville caserne ».

En 1807, Moulay Slimane ordonne la création d'un mellah car la kasbah d'Essaouira est surpeuplée. La plupart des Juifs sont donc déplacés dans le mellah. Marchands ou artisans, celliers, bijoutiers, courtiers, colporteurs, le nombre de Juifs dépasse celui des musulmans jusqu'au début du XIXe siècle. Deux années plus tard, James Grey Jackson déclare que la ville s'étend jusqu'à bab Doukkala et bab Marrakech.

Lors de la guerre franco-marocaine, le 15 août 1844, la France bombarde la cité. Des confédérations tribales voisines, les Chiadma et les Haha, en profitent pour piller la ville pendant 40 jours. À ce moment, selon l'administrateur colonial et historien Pierre de Cenival, les habitants ont déjà été évacués, une version différente est donnée par l'écrivain David Bensoussan pour qui le pillage occasionne de nombreux viols et enlèvements, en particulier parmi les juifs. Après le bombardement de Tanger et à la veille de la bataille d'Isly, un assaut est effectué sous les ordres du prince de Joinville sur l'îlot de Mogador et la ville, située à seulement 1,5 km. Plusieurs centaines d'hommes débarquent tout d'abord sur l'île où se trouvent des forts, une prison et une mosquée. Toutes les batteries de l'île sont neutralisées et plus de 400 Marocains sous les ordres du Caïd El Haj Larbi Torres sont capturés, après une farouche résistance, causant 14 tués et 64 blessés parmi les assaillants français. La ville de Mogador est bombardée quant à elle pendant 26 heures, détruisant un nombre important d'habitations, avant un assaut terrestre sur le port de la ville, le 16 août 1844, par environ 600 Français. Les batteries de la ville en grande partie détruites, les Français en profitent et capturent le port, détruisant les dernières batteries de la ville et coulant plusieurs navires. Le prince de Joinville décrit l'opération au ministère de la marine le 17 août 1844 :

« Le 15, nous avons attaqué Mogador. Après avoir détruit la ville et ses batteries, nous avons pris possession de l'île et du port. Soixante-dix-huit hommes, dont sept officiers, ont été tués et blessés. Je me suis occupé à placer une garnison sur l'île, et j'ai ordonné le blocus du port. »

Le même jour, le consul anglais et sa famille sont évacués en échange des prisonniers marocains blessés, tandis que le consul français avait déjà quitté la ville un mois auparavant. Un an plus tard, la paix est conclue entre les deux pays, et l'échange des prisonniers a lieu le 4 juillet 1845, où 123 prisonniers marocains rejoignent la ville dont le caïd El Haj Larbi Torres. Le Maroc stoppe son soutien à l'émir Abdelkader et doit reconnaître l'autorité française sur l'Algérie, à la suite des traités de Tanger et de Lalla Maghnia. Les forces françaises n'évacuent Mogador que le 16 septembre 1844.
En 1863, le sultan Mohammed ben Abderrahmane donne l'ordre aux administrations de la douane de l'agrandissement de la kasbah. Une nouvelle kasbah voit le jour dans le prolongement de l'ancienne devant loger vingt-quatre maisons de commerce. Deux ans plus tard, on compte dans la ville plus de cinquante-deux maisons de commerce. En 1865, c'est le mellah d'Essaouira qui est agrandi, et qui s'étend désormais jusqu'à bab Doukkala. L'importance du port d'Essaouira ne cesse d'augmenter entre les XVIIIe et XIXe siècles. Contrairement à Tanger, les navires qui fréquentent Essaouira sont de grands bâtiments pour l'époque, pouvant charger près de 125 tonneaux. Le sultan Mohammed ben Abdellah fait tout à cette époque pour mettre en sommeil les autres ports du Maroc, permettant à celui d'Essaouira le contrôle de 50 % du tonnage et de 60 % du commerce maritime. Ainsi, entre 1765 et 1865, sur les 29 000 navires ayant accosté sur les côtes marocaines, 12 000 vont à Essaouira.

Déclin, protectorat et indépendance
À la suite du bombardement de Mogador, la ville entre, durant la deuxième phase du XIXe siècle, dans une phase de déclin, notamment parce qu'elle est en grande partie pillée et incendiée, mais aussi parce que les négociants juifs de la ville se mettent sous la protection des consulats étrangers, prenant leurs distances vis-à-vis du Makhzen, et emploient en toute sécurité un système de crédit abusif et d'échange inégal, ce qui assèche les ressources des campagnes alentour au profit de la France, provoquant l'hostilité des caïds de la région.

L'explorateur français Charles de Foucauld, de passage à Mogador entre le 28 janvier et le 14 mars 1884, donne un témoignage du déclin commercial de la ville à la fin du XIXe siècle. Il relève l'affaiblissement des relations commerciales avec l'Europe. Foucauld ajoute que le port garde encore le monopole du commerce avec le Soudan par le biais des tribus Chiadma, Haha, Chtouka et Ilalen. Ce commerce est « le plus bel apanage qui lui reste ». Dans les années 1880 les caravanes viennent encore du Sahel, de Tombouctou et de Tindouf notamment, précise-t-il. Les régions du Sahel, le bassin du fleuve Drâa situé à l'ouest de l'ouad Aqqa, sont encore approvisionnés par Mogador. À cette époque Marrarech a déjà supplanté le vieux port dans le commerce des marchandises.
Petit à petit, les principaux établissements européens veulent de plus en plus déplacer leurs consulats hors de la ville d'Essaouira. Dès 1857, la France exprime son envie de déplacer ses principaux établissements à Casablanca. En 1896, avec l'occupation de Tindouf par la France, les caravanes venues d'Afrique subsaharienne se font de plus en plus rares et, depuis l'invention de la propulsion à vapeur, les navires européens ne sont plus obligés de faire escale sur les côtes marocaines lors de certains voyages. Dès la fin du règne de Hassan ben Mohammed, dit Hassan Ier, Essaouira perd son rôle de port commercial international.
Avec le début du protectorat français du Maroc, la ville devient officiellement Mogador, et s'amorce le déclin du port d'Essaouira au profit des ports en eau plus profonde de Casablanca, Tanger et Agadir, étant donné que le port d'Essaouira ne peut pas recevoir les gros bateaux modernes à fort tirant d'eau. En 1926, Mogador, qui est le siège d'un contrôle civil, est peuplée de 18 401 habitants, dont 7 730 juifs.

À l'indépendance du pays, la ville, désormais officiellement dénommée Essaouira, devient chef-lieu du cercle éponyme relevant de la province de Marrakech. En 1960, dans le cadre du premier recensement de la population du Maroc d'après-indépendance, Essaouira est peuplée de 26 392 habitants. En 1965, elle est intégrée à la nouvelle province de Safi, cette fois-ci au sein du cercle des Ahmar. En 1967, à la suite de la guerre des Six Jours, la ville connait un départ massif des Juifs de la ville, qui s'en vont pour la majorité vivre en Israël, provoquant une importante baisse de population. En 1971, Essaouira est peuplée de 30 061 habitants, connaissant une très faible hausse, due au départ massif des Juifs de la ville. Elle devient à partir de cette date une municipalité à part entière. La municipalité devient, depuis avril 1975, chef-lieu de la toute nouvelle province d'Essaouira.
La ville connaît cependant une renaissance spectaculaire depuis le début des années 1990, renaissance due essentiellement au tourisme mais aussi à sa vocation culturelle. Sa médina est classée depuis 2001 au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.

Démographie
La ville d'Essaouira, fondée durant la deuxième moitié du XVIIIe siècle, a toujours été une ville modeste. Elle n'atteint jamais, avant l'indépendance, les 50 000 habitants, notamment parce qu'elle connaît plusieurs freins à son émancipation. Initialement habitée par une population de toutes origines et religions, elle perd aujourd'hui de son multiculturalisme. En effet, à la fin du XVIIIe siècle, la ville connaît sa première baisse de population, et est touchée en 1799 par une violente épidémie de peste causant la mort d'environ 4 500 habitants et provoquant le départ des chrétiens.
En 1844, le bombardement par la flotte française d'Essouira, entraîne la fuite de toute sa population et son pillage par les campagnards des alentours. Ce qui cause directement le début du déclin de la ville et la baisse manifeste de sa population à 10 000 habitants. En 1886, la ville connaît une hausse de population, et est désormais peuplée de 18 000 habitants. Une hausse bien éphémère, puisque le rôle commercial de la ville chute terriblement avec l'arrivée du protectorat français, et sa population stagne en 40 ans ; elle est toujours peuplée d'environ 18 000 habitants en 1926.
À l'indépendance, en 1960, la ville est peuplée de 26 392 habitants. Essaouira connait une dramatique baisse de population en 1967, à la suite du déclenchement de la guerre des Six Jours, la presque totalité des Juifs de la ville quittant le Maroc, ce qui explique la très faible hausse de population que connaît la ville en 1971 car seulement peuplée de 30 061 habitants. Depuis cette date, la population de la ville ne cesse d'augmenter, notamment grâce à son climat, à un exode rural, mais aussi à son exceptionnelle renaissance depuis le début des années 1990, due essentiellement au tourisme. Depuis 2014, la ville est peuplée officiellement de 77 966 habitants et compte 20 290 ménages.

Économie
Pêche
Le port d'Essaouira est connu pour sa pêche, notamment celle des sardines. Troisième port sardinier du pays, il ne devient un port destiné uniquement à la pêche qu'à partir de 1982. En 2008, il génère 8 tonnes de produits de pêche, soit 8 % de la production de la côte atlantique du pays, sa superficie totale atteint 1,2 hectare.

Tourisme
La ville d'Essaouira dispose d'un fort potentiel touristique, grâce notamment à ses atouts naturels, historiques et culturels, devenant ainsi une grande destination touristique. Sa médina, inscrite au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 2001, l'îlot de Mogador, son port, datant du XVIIIe siècle et ses plages, permettant la pratique des sports nautiques, font de la province une destination touristique de qualité. La ville d'Essaouira accueille chaque année le festival de la musique gnaoua, faisant venir tous les touristes des environs. C'est ainsi qu'en 2008, plus de 165 000 touristes ont visité la ville.
Le tourisme est donc de plus en plus important à Essaouira. Celle-ci est également renommée pour la pratique du windsurf et du kitesurf, grâce aux vents puissants qui soufflent presque constamment dans la baie, ainsi qu'à l'organisation annuelle d'une étape de la coupe du monde de kitesurf. Son artisanat spécifique est également prisé des touristes, tel le travail du bois de thuya. Le marché aux poissons et des épices l'est tout autant. La région d'Essaouira a comme particularité de posséder énormément de champs d'arganiers. L'huile d'argan est traditionnellement appréciée par les touristes.
D'après le recensement national de 2014, il y a 540 résidents étrangers permanents à Essaouira (ce chiffre exclut les touristes présents seulement durant leurs vacances).

Transport
Les transports dans la ville d'Essaouira sont assez diversifiés. Les taxis sont très présents dans la ville. Il y en a deux types : les petits taxis et les grands taxis, qui sont de couleur bleue. Toutefois, ces taxis ne desservent pas la médina, ses ruelles restent trop étroites.
La ville possède également une gare routière en dehors de la médina, qui offre des voyages en bus en direction de Marrakech, Agadir, Casablanca et El Jadida. Elle dispose également de bus urbains qui permettent de desservir les communes alentour.
L'aéroport d'Essaouira-Mogador, situé à 16 km au sud-est de la ville et inauguré en 1998, est opérationnel depuis juin 1999. Son but est avant tout de faire de la ville une véritable destination touristique. Agrandi en 2000, un vol direct le relie à Paris depuis avril 2004.

Culture
Festival et musique
Dans les années 1960, Essaouira est une oasis pour les hippies du monde entier. Les musiciens comme Jimi Hendrix et Cat Stevens sont attirés par les sonorités musicales de la confrérie gnaoua et aiment y séjourner.
Elle reste donc particulièrement célèbre pour la musique gnaoua, de style africain. Les Gnaouas sont une partie composante de sa population mais aussi de tout le Maghreb. Les Gnaouas sont des descendants des Haoussa Fulani venus de Kano, les Kanawa, qui faisaient partie en majorité de Abid al-Bukhari, la garde noire du sultan Moulay Ismaïl. La musique gnaoua utilise ainsi plusieurs types d'instruments, tels que les qraqeb (ou qrâqech), sortes de crotales, les instruments à percussion que sont les djembés, ainsi que les guembris, qui sont des instruments à cordes. Ce style musical connaît un véritable engouement et Essaouira accueille, chaque été, le Festival des Gnaouas, qui connaît un véritable succès dès ses toutes premières éditions.
Elle compte également plusieurs moussems, en particulier grâce à la présence importante de zaouïas dans la ville. Parmi eux, le moussem annuel des Hamadcha est organisé par la zaouïa Hamadcha, tandis que celui de Sidi Bilal est organisé par la confrérie gnaoua.

Art
Les artistes singuliers d'Essaouira participent au mouvement artistique de la ville. Historiquement, lors de sa fondation, le sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah fait venir des populations de toutes origines, dont un très grand nombre d'artistes, ce qui permet à la cité, devenue un « carrefour des civilisations », d'être une ville d'art et de détenir une créativité artistique exceptionnelle.
Essaouira se distingue surtout dans le domaine pictural. La première galerie d'art, « Frédéric Damgaard », est créée en 1988 par un spécialiste danois d'art islamique, qui encourage dès 1969 les peintres locaux, elle est devenue un lieu incontournable. Le patrimoine historique et culturel de la ville encourage et inspire les artistes de toute la région. Mohammed Tabal est le premier de ces artistes locaux à acquérir une célébrité à la fin des années 1980 : ancien musicien gnaoui, il est influencé par le mysticisme de sa confrérie.
La sculpture est également présente, Rachid Mourabit, surnommé le « César d'Essaouira », crée des sculptures à partir d'objets métalliques recyclés et inspirés de la culture locale.
La calligraphie est très présente à Essaouira et se distingue de celle des autres villes. Mêlée au paysage et au climat local, pleine de créativité, elle reste artistique et colorée. Tayeb Saddiki en est spécialiste.
Les galeries d'arts sont très nombreuses. Tout d'abord, la galerie Frédéric Damgaard, qui reste la plus ancienne. Vient ensuite l'Espace Othello, qui accueille peintres, sculpteurs et calligraphes. La Galerie la Kasbah et le Centre artisanal d’Essaouira sont également des lieux de rencontre entre artistes. L'Association Tilal regroupe plus d'une cinquantaine d'artistes, tous originaires de la ville. Le borj ouest et borj bab Marrakech sont également des lieux d'exposition

Littérature
La ville et sa région ont inspiré de nombreux écrivains, dont plusieurs natifs aux rangs desquels on compte Edmond Amran El Maleh, Ami Bouganim, David Bensoussan ou encore Hamza Ben Driss Ottmani, des écrivains marocains non saouiri comme Khireddine Mourad, des auteurs non-marocains comme les français Jean Sulivan, Jacques Perry, Morgan Sportès, l'allemand Hubert Schatz et le Mexicain Alberto Ruy-Sanchez qui consacre un cycle de contes et romans qui ont pour cadre le port fortifié de Mogador. Essaouira apparaît également régulièrement dans La mémoire tatouée d'Abdelkébir Khatibi, Talismano d'Abdelwahab Meddeb, La prière de l’absent de Tahar Benjelloun et Perla de Mogador de Nine Moati.

Artisanat
L'artisanat est très important dans la vie des habitants d'Essaouira. Diversifié, il reste la principale activité de la ville. En 2011, plus de 31 % de la population de la province vit du secteur artisanal.
La marqueterie de thuya reste sans aucun doute le plus gros pourvoyeur d'emplois et de revenus. En 2011, 58 % des artisans d'Essaouira travaillent le bois de thuya. Historiquement, le premier artisan à s'être spécialisé est le maâlem Jilali Ould El-Alja. Il forme au cours de sa vie plusieurs dizaines de jeunes artisans, dont le maâlem Omar Ould El-Alja, qui est le plus important que connaît la ville. Au début, c'est principalement l'acajou, le citronnier, l'ébène et le noyer qui sont utilisés par les artisans, puisque le bois de thuya, très rare, reste encore inconnu. Le thuya fait son apparition plus tard et tout d'abord dans les villes de Salé et Rabat, avant d'être introduit à Essaouira par l'intermédiaire d'Omar Ould El-Alja.
L'orfèvrerie, renommée à Essaouira, disparaît complètement de nos jours. Il faut dire que la communauté juive en est plus ou moins la seule artisane. Ce sont majoritairement les artisans juifs qui en assurent la fabrication et les innovations. Ils ont mis au point des techniques spéciales telles que l'utilisation d'un type de ciselure reconnaissable et un filigrane délicat. Quoi qu'il en soit, le départ des Juifs de la ville met un terme à l'essor que connaît la ville dans l'orfèvrerie, qui devient une activité marginale.
Il existe d'autres types d'artisanat tels que la vannerie et les tissages.

Gastronomie
La gastronomie est très riche à Essaouira. Comme dans tout le Maroc, le couscous reste emblématique et est souvent accompagné de marqa similaire à un bouillon de légumes, mais aussi de viandes et légumes. Le thé à la menthe est également très emblématique et très apprécié des Souiris et des Marocains en général.
Essaouira possède cependant des spécialités culinaires que d'autres villes ne possèdent pas. Grâce à l'essor de son port et de ses pêches, le poisson, et surtout les sardines, sont omniprésents. Ces mêmes poissons sont souvent utilisés pour cuisiner des tajines aux sardines, mais aussi des tajines de boulettes (kefta) de sardines. Cette dernière recette est souvent désignée sous le nom dolma. Le tajine souiri est quant à lui spécifique à la ville. Il diffère des tajines marocains et se rapproche des tajines tunisiens, puisque ce n'est pas un tajine en sauce, mais un tajine gratiné. Il est constitué principalement de poulet.

Cinématographie
Grâce à son riche patrimoine historique, plusieurs séquences cinématographiques renommées sont tournées à Essaouira. Orson Welles y tourne son film Othello, qui connaît un énorme succès en 1952. En 1991, des scènes de la Bataille des Trois Rois de Souheil Ben Barka sont tournées à Essaouira.
En 2004, Ridley Scott y reconstitue la Jérusalem médiévale pour le film Kingdom of Heaven. Dans la série Game of Thrones, la scène de la promenade des punis dans la ville d'Astapor (saison 3) est filmée sur les remparts de la kasbah.

Architecture et urbanisme
Port
Le port d'Essaouira, longtemps surnommé « port de Tombouctou » du fait qu'il est un point d’échange entre les longues pistes de commerce transsaharien et les grandes routes maritimes et qu'il sert à relier l'Afrique subsaharienne à l'Europe et aux Amériques, est le principal port de commerce international du Maroc entre la fin du XVIIIe siècle et la fin du XIXe siècle, mais son déclin commence à partir de la construction des ports de Casablanca, Tanger et Agadir (possédant des eaux profondes contrairement à Essaouira).
Construit en 1770, sous le règne du sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah, il est protégé par la sqala du port, reliée par Bab el-Marsa (« porte de la marine »). Situé à l'ouest de la ville, il est aujourd'hui le troisième port de pêche sardinière du royaume, mais aussi un important chantier naval où l'on construit et répare des bateaux traditionnels tels que chalutiers, boutres, senneurs et palangriers. Ancien chantier naval de construction de navires de guerre, mais aussi port de commerce international, ce n'est que depuis 1982 qu'il est aménagé pour servir exclusivement à la pêche.

Médina
La médina d'Essaouira compte plusieurs quartiers tous fondés entre le XVIIIe siècle et le XIXe siècle. Le plus ancien d'entre eux reste la kasbah, un quartier fortifié où étaient logés les dignitaires avant que ne soit construit le mellah. Surnommé le « Quartier du Roy » par Cornut, on y accède à l'Est par Bab el-Sebâa (porte du lion) frappée d'une inscription rappelant la fondation de la ville ordonnée par Mohammed ben Abdellah. À l'ouest, on trouve le rempart qui longe l'océan, dont une partie est effondrée du côté nord, remplacée par une rue qui mène vers le musée. Au nord se trouve un bâtiment nommé El Minzah, autrefois appelé l'« alcôve du café de l’Empereur », dont la triple porte ouvre sur l'axe principal qui traverse la ville de part en part, marquant la séparation entre, à l'ouest, l'ancienne kasbah et, à l'est, la nouvelle.
C'est dans le nord de la kasbah que le sultan enjoint aux consuls européens et américains de bâtir, à leur frais, des maisons consulaires dont il reste encore notamment celle du Danemark, dans la rue El Fettouaki, et celle de France, au coin de la rue Mohammed Diouri. Enfin, au sud se trouve Dar Makhzen ou résident les douaniers du port, les commissaires priseurs (mouhtassib) ainsi que les négociants musulmans. L'ancien entrepôt des droits de douane, situé à la place de l'actuelle salle de basket-ball, sert, au début du XXe siècle, de caserne à un régiment de tirailleurs sénégalais dont certains Gnaouas de la ville sont les descendants.
La kasbah est agrandie en 1863, sur ordre du sultan Mohammed ben Abderrahmane, dans le but de loger beaucoup plus de maisons de commerce. Depuis, on désigne l’extension de la kasbah sous le nom de kasbah jedida.

Vient ensuite le mellah d'Essaouira, construit en 1807 pour permettre de dé-densifier la kasbah, devenue trop peuplée. Ainsi, devant le nombre trop croissant de Juifs dans cette ville, le sultan Slimane ben Mohammed a l'idée de la création d'un tel quartier. Tous les Juifs de la ville, composés principalement de marchands, y sont déplacés. À cette époque, le nombre de Juifs dépasse celui des musulmans. Le mellah reste aujourd'hui un quartier profondément délabré et à l'abandon. Abandonné de sa population juive à la suite de la guerre des Six Jours, il est toujours plus ou moins inhabité et en réhabilitation. Le mellah, surpeuplé et disposant d'une surface de 18 600 m2 est agrandi en 1865 (mellah jedid). Il est situé près de bab Doukkala. Une grande partie du quartier est détruite.
La médina compte cinq autres quartiers. Tout d'abord, Derb ahl Agadir, construit en 1773 dans le but de loger une grande partie de la population d'Agadir déplacée vers Essaouira. Il se situe au sud de la médina. Ensuite, Derb Beni Antar, qui accueille initialement tous les habitants de la tribu des Beni Antar, se situe au nord de la médina. Derb Chebânat accueille initialement pour sa part les combattants de la tribu arabe des Chebânat. Il se situe à l'est de la ville. Derb Bouachir et derb Rahala se situent pour leur part au sud-est de la médina.

Remparts et portes
Portes
Essaouira compte un important nombre de portes, situées dans la médina de la ville. Ces portes sont influencées par deux types de styles différents. Le style chérifien, qui rappelle les fortifications de Marrakech, comporte des portes arrondies, alors que le style européen comporte des portes à fronton et des colonnes cannelées :

Bab el-Marsa (porte de la marine) est la porte la plus monumentale d'Essaouira. Bâtie en 1769-1770 par le renégat Ahmed El Inglizi, sous les ordres du sultan Mohammed ben Abdellah, la porte est construite entièrement en pierre de taille. De style Vauban, Bab el-Marsa est une porte à fronton contenant des colonnes cannelées. La porte permet l'accès au port d'Essaouira.
Bab Marrakech (porte de Marrakech) est une porte qui se trouve au sud-est de la médina d'Essaouira, et était un passage obligé pour prendre la route de Marrakech et d'Agadir. De style chérifien, bab Marrakech est une porte arrondie reliée par des remparts en pierre et enduite d'un crépi de terre, comportant des créneaux carrés. Borj Bab Marrakech se trouve à proximité.
Bab Doukkala (porte de Doukkala) est située au nord-est de la médina, dans le mellah. De style chérifien, elle était un passage obligé pour prendre la route de Safi et atteindre le territoire des Doukkala.
Bab el-Menzeh (porte d'El Menzeh) est l'une des portes de l'ancienne dar El Mekhzen et ses dépendances, dont il ne reste pratiquement plus rien. Située dans la kasbah, elle se compose de trois baies identiques à celles de bab el-Mechouar, qui leur font face. Elle est couverte d'un toit de tuiles vertes. Elle fut édifiée en 1764.
Bab el-Sebâa (porte du lion) est percée en 1866 sous les ordres de Mohammed ben Abderrahmane. Elle permet de desservir la nouvelle extension de la kasbah (kasbah jedida). Elle fait face à bab Magana.
Bab Magana (porte de l'horloge), anciennement appelée porte du roi, est édifiée en 1764. C’est la seule porte conservée parmi les portes d’accès que connaît la kasbah. Elle se situe entre la kasbah kdima et la kasbah jedida.
Bab al-Bahar (porte de la mer) est une porte construite au XVIIIe siècle sous le règne du sultan Mohammed ben Abdellah. Elle est l’unique porte donnant directement accès à la mer depuis la médina. Elle est aujourd'hui condamnée, et se situe dans le quartier des Beni Antar.
Bab el-Mechouar (porte du Mechouar) est située dans la kasbah. Elle est constituée de trois baies identiques à celles de bab el-Menzeh, qui leur font face.

Borjs et édifices militaires
La ville d'Essaouira compte un important nombre de borjs et édifices militaires. Certains de ces édifices disparaissent au cours du temps. La sqala de la kasbah et la sqala du port sont les deux principales fortifications de la ville. Elles s’étendent sur plusieurs centaines de mètres et sont armées de plusieurs dizaines de canons. Voici les principaux édifices de la ville :

La sqala de la kasbah, aussi appelée sqala de la mer et sqala de la médina, construite sur deux niveaux à la création de la ville, au XVIIIe siècle, est la principale fortification, et fait face à l'océan Atlantique. De style Vauban, elle est construite exclusivement en pierre de taille, s'étend sur plusieurs centaines de mètres, et compte plusieurs dizaines de canons espagnols. La sqala est dominée par le borj nord.
La sqala du port, construite en 1769, est située dans le port d'Essaouira. De style manuélin, elle est constituée de deux ailes fortifiées de 200 mètres, reliées à Bab el-Marsa et dominées par le borj el-barmil. Sa fonction principale est la défense du port.
Le borj nord (bastion nord), est situé au bout et domine la sqala de la kasbah. Il s'agit du plus imposant bastion de la ville.
Borj el-barmil (bastion circulaire), également appelé bastion du port, est situé dans le port. Il domine la sqala du port. De style Vauban, il permet la défense de l'accès nord de la baie, avec le borj Moulay Ben Nasser qui se trouve de l'autre côté, sur l'îlot de Mogador. Il s'agit d'une tour d'angle carrée permettant de voir l'horizon de tous les côtés grâce à ses échauguettes aux 4 points cardinaux.
Borj bab Marrakech (bastion de la porte de Marrakech), aussi appelé bastion sud, est édifié en 1864, sous le règne de Abderrahmane ben Hicham. Le bastion est l’édifice défensif le plus important côté terre. Il s'agit d'une grande tour circulaire pouvant abriter une dizaine de canons dominant ainsi la quasi-totalité des accès est de la médina. Le bastion sert de poudrière et d’entrepôt de munitions.
Le borj ouest (bastion ouest), datant du XVIIIe siècle, se trouve à l'ouest de la médina. Il est restauré en 1998. Depuis 1999, il accueille les peintres d’Essaouira pour exposer leurs œuvres au public.
Borj el-âssa (bastion de surveillance) est situé dans l'îlot de Mogador. Il permet la défense de l'accès nord de la baie avec borj el-baroude, qui lui fait face.
Borj Moulay Mhamed (bastion Moulay Mhamed) se trouve à l'est de la médina. Il permet de défendre le côté est de la ville.
Borj Moulay Ben Nasser (bastion Moulay Ben Nasser) est situé sur l'îlot de Mogador, il permet la défense de l'accès nord de la baie avec borj el-barmil, qui se trouve de l'autre côté, sur le rivage.
Borj mellah (bastion du mellah), situé au nord-est de la médina, permet la défense de la côte nord-est de celle-ci. Il est toujours debout.
Borj el-baroude (bastion de la poudre), construit lors du XVIIIe siècle, est aujourd'hui disparu. Isolé, il sert de magasin de poudre, d'où son nom. Il permet, avec borj el-âssa, la défense de l'accès sud de la baie.
Borj el-Oued (bastion du fleuve), fut construit durant le XVIIIe siècle, près du Ksob. Initialement construite à l'époque des Phéniciens et Carthaginois, la forteresse finit par tomber. Ce n'est qu'au XVIIIe siècle que le sultan Mohammed ben Abdellah décida d'y reconstruire un bastion. Le borj disparut à la suite d'une désastreuse inondation du Ksob le 13 janvier 1856.
Le Castelo Real (château royal) est édifié en septembre 1506 par les Portugais, sous les ordres du roi Manuel Ier. Évacué le 4 décembre 1510, il reste abandonné mais protégé par les Saadiens lors du XVIIe siècle. Dans le cadre de la fondation d'Essaouira, Mohammed ben Abdellah ordonne sa démolition effective en 1775. Les pierres du Castelo Real serviront plus tard à la construction de la sqala du port.

Édifices religieux
Les édifices religieux à Essaouira sont très nombreux. Par son multiculturalisme, la ville compte plusieurs mosquées, synagogues et églises. La médina compte à elle seule treize mosquées, qui sont les plus anciennes de la ville. Parmi elles :

la mosquée de la kasbah, aussi appelé Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah, est la plus ancienne des mosquées de la ville, élevée à l’époque même de sa fondation. Elle se situe dans la kasbah, d'où son nom. D'une superficie de 900 m2, son minaret est de forme carrée. Elle comptait en son sein une médersa, ainsi que des logements et chambres pour les étudiants ;
la mosquée Ben Youssef, qui fait la liaison entre le reste de la médina et la kasbah, est l’un des édifices les plus importants et les plus imposants de la ville. Elle se trouve dans la partie sud-est de la médina. D'une superficie de 2 000 m2, il s'agit de la plus grande mosquée de la ville. Son minaret mesure 66,34 m de hauteur pour une base de 6,8 m ;
l'église Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption d'Essaouira est construite en 1936 par des prêtres espagnols dans une petite rue en parallèle de la plage. Elle reste la dernière église active de nos jours dans la ville, et se trouve en dehors de la médina. Il s'agit d'une église catholique ;
l'église portugaise est construite vers la fin du XVIIIe siècle par les négociants européens. Elle se trouve au pied de la porte sud de la sqala de la kasbah ;
la synagogue Simon Attias, construite à la fin du XIXe siècle par un marchand juif dont elle porte le nom, se trouve en plein cœur de la kasbah. La synagogue s'étend sur 500 m2 ;
la synagogue Slat Lkahal, synagogue de la Communauté, construite en 1850 dans le mellah, était aussi un lieu d'enseignement ;
la synagogue Haim Pinto, dans la maison où habitait le rabbin réputé thaumaturge Haïm Pinto au XIXe siècle ;

La ville compte également d'autres types d'édifices religieux tels que des zaouïas et des cimetières. La médina compte à elle seule quinze zaouïas. Parmi elles :

la zaouïa Hamadcha, fondée par Sidi Ali ben Hamdouch au XVIIIe siècle, est l'une des plus importantes zaouïas de la ville. Elle se trouve dans le quartier Chebânat de la médina. La zaouïa organise annuellement un moussem ;
la zaouïa Sidna Bilal, édifiée par la confrérie gnaoua, se trouve dans la médina, au sein du quartier des Beni Antar. La zaouïa organise chaque année le moussem de Sidna Bilal ;
la zaouia Aïssaoua est l'une des plus importantes zaouïas de la ville. Elle se trouve dans la partie est de la médina ;
le cimetière juif est fondé quelques années seulement après la fondation de la ville, au moins depuis 1769. La totalité de l'importante communauté juive que compte la ville dans son passé y est enterrée. Il est agrandi en 1874, sous le règne du souverain Hassan ben Mohammed.

Établissements culturels
La ville d'Essaouira compte plusieurs établissements culturels :

Le musée Sidi-Mohammed-ben-Abdellah est une ancienne maison seigneuriale datant du XIXe siècle. Il est choisi en 1980 pour mettre en avant le patrimoine historique de la province tout entière.
Le centre culturel Dar Souiri, situé dans la médina, est un espace consacré à la culture vivante artistique, musicale et littéraire et possède également une bibliothèque.
L'Institut français d'Essaouira dispose d'une grande médiathèque de langue française. Riche de plus de 6 000 références, elle se situe dans la médina.
Bayt Dakira, la Maison de la mémoire d'Essaouira, consacrée à la longue « coexistence sereine » des communautés juives et musulmanes d'Essaouira, située dans la médina, est inaugurée le 15 janvier 2020 par le roi Mohammed VI, en présence de la directrice générale de l'Unesco Audrey Azoulay et de son père, André Azoulay, conseiller du roi.

Sport
Essaouira est dotée d'un club de basket-ball réputé, l'Al-Amal Sportive d'Essaouira. Ce club, fondé en 1920, se trouve en première division nationale. Pour ce qui est du football, sport le plus populaire du pays, Essaouira ne possède pas de clubs en première et deuxième divisions. L'ASS Essaouira et le FC Mogador Essaouira sont les principaux clubs de la ville.
La particularité climatique d'Essaouira est le vent, fort l'été, adapté à la pratique du windsurf et du kitesurf, et sa position géographique au centre du triangle d'or du surf marocain est un point fort pour ces pratiques.

Éducation
La ville d'Essaouira comporte de nombreux établissements scolaires. Parmi eux, les établissements privés sont très nombreux. On peut citer la seule école de langue française que connait la ville, du nom de Groupe scolaire Éric Tabarly. Essaouira compte également des lycées publics tels que les lycées Sidi Mohammed ben Abdellah, Mohammed V et le lycée privé Les Arganiers qui se situe à la rentrée de la ville.
La ville compte surtout un établissement d'enseignement supérieur technologique public, l'École Supérieure de Technologie d'Essaouira, qui fait partie du réseau des écoles supérieures de technologie et relève de l'Université Cadi Ayyad. Elle a été créée en 2005.

## Overview
Essaouira (Arabic: الصويرة) is a coastal city in Morocco. It is known as the Windy City.

## Understand
In addition to the new town, Essaouira offers a picturesque medina (old town) surrounded by seawalls and city walls, designed by a French architect in the 18th century, a harbor with fish market, and a long beach with numerous water sports opportunities. Once a hippie hangout, Jimi Hendrix and Cat Stevens spent some time here. Orson Welles filmed part of his Othello in town; west of the medina there's a square named in his honor.

## By plane
Three are flights from Charleroi, London, Madrid, Marseille, Paris, Tangier, Weeze, operated by RyanAir and Transavia. Also seasonal flights from Gran Canaria by Binter Canarias and from Bordeaux by easyJet.
31.3975-9.6816671 Essaouira-Mogador Airport (ESU  IATA) (16 km SE from the city). There is an Al Barid ATM and a tourist information office. Please note, boarding passes have to be printed out before heading to the airport and then stamped at a check in desk, even if you have no bags to check in. Also, Ryanair is notoriously stricter about carry-on bag sizes at this airport.      (updated Aug 2024)
Bus #2, 6:30 — 18:30, roughly every hour, 7 dirham. Sometimes it goes directly to the airport but other times it stops instead at the main road junction near the airport, from where it is a 3 km walk. Bus drivers are able to advise the next direct bus departures. In city center it departs from the bus stop near the 31.515946-9.7657252 Bab Doukkala, NE of medina.
Airport shuttle bus, 50 dirham per person. It departs from 31.505712-9.7610813 Greg tours agency in the city center. In cases when there are not enough passengers, one have to pay 100 dirham.
Grand taxi 150 dirham (as of 2024), can fit up to 6 people.
Larger international airports are in Agadir, Marrakech and Casablanca.

## By bus
Bus departures are not 100% reliable. They may be canceled or rescheduled. It is also common for the buses to be sold out. Get your ticket in advance to be sure.
31.51086-9.767134 Supratours (just down the street from the beach and close to the medina entrance at Bab Marrakech). Runs coaches from their office in Marrakech (immediately next door to Marrakech's new train station). 80 dirham per person for standard bus, plus 5 dirham for each piece of stowed luggage.    (updated Jan 2018)
31.50416-9.756995 CTM, ☏ +212 5247-84764. Runs a coach service from Marrakech's bus station (or the CTM Offices in the Gueliz, on Zerktouni street) for 80 dirham (add 5 dirham per piece of stowed luggage) taking about 3 hours to Essaouira. CTM buses also connect Essaouira to Agadir (3 hours) and Casablanca (6 hours) about four times per day.    (updated Jan 2018)
31.5174-9.75926 Gare routière, Avenue 2 Mars. Small and unappealing station which local buses depart from. Local buses from Marrakesh bus station cost 55-60 dirham but they might try to ask tourists for more, these buses are sometimes less comfortable and slower, but they depart more frequently than the CTM buses. Many ticket sellers and semi-touts are running around the buses and station, trying to organise your trip and luggage. Note, official prices are posted inside the terminal, so do not get told it is more expensive than that. Also be curious about any luggage fee—not common, especially for luggage on-board.    (updated Jan 2018)
Tickets are rarely available for the next departing coach with Supratours and CTM. Try to book your tickets the day before, or further in advance during peak travel periods.
Between Essaouira and Agadir it is very easy to catch an intercity bus anywhere along the way. During the day there is one bus about every hour. While CTM and Supratours are not allowed to pick up additional passengers, local intercity buses do not have such a restriction. This is a great way to explore the coast including Taghazout between these two cities without issues. The regular price for the full distance is 50 dirham.

## By taxi
A whole grand taxi from Marrakech costs 450-800 dirham, depending on your negotiating skill, where you are, the mood of the driver, etc. It is about 80 dirham per place if you wait and take a grand taxi (six passengers, leave when full).

## Get around
The walled center of town, the Medina, is supposedly restricted to non-motorized vehicles,  but this rule is widely ignored in the case of mopeds which are an increasing nuisance. However, compared to e.g. Marrakech the mopeds are much less of a hazard. Other than that, there are occasional donkey carts to dodge.
Taxi costs a flat fee of 8 dirham during day and 9 dirham after 20:00 (as of Jan 2024).

## See
Essaouira is a perfect example of a late 18th century fortified town, with the original canons still in place and where Orson Wells shot his Othello, "The Moor of Venice".

## Medina
The UNESCO World Heritage Listed medina: check out the fish market at the west end, watch the sunset from the seawall at the Place Moulay Hassan, visit the Scala (wall tower north east of the Place), walk through the markets towards Bab Doukkala at the east end, and check out the artisan's shops near the eastern wall.

31.51016-9.773822 Essaouira Citadel. 09:00-17:00. 60 dirham for foreigners.    (updated Jun 2019)
31.49594-9.786813 Mogador island (about 1.5 km from the city). It's a nature reserve, and thus can't be visited without an official authorization. In the 19th century, it was used as a quarantine station for pilgrims returning from Mecca.      (updated Jan 2018)

## Diabat town
31.481-9.774 The nearby town of Diabat. is at the south end of Essaouira's beach, and is allegedly where Jimi Hendrix once spent some time. Even if the stories aren't true, this long, windswept beach with its ruined fort is a fantastic walk. Diabat is an empty, concrete Berber village that is practically devoid of attractions except the Hendrix ruin and a Hendrix Café. It's best visited in the early morning via taxi and then return to Essouiara via a short and very romantic walk on the beach past the castle in the sand of Hendrix fame.    (updated Jan 2018)
31.4836-9.76915 Dar Sultan Palace. Walk south along the beach, cross the shallow river Oued Igrounzer and in the hills to your left you will see the ruins of a once magnificent 18th century palace used by Sultans and Kings. A path leads there; you can still find some old floor mosaics and thankfully the ruins offer some shade.    (updated Jan 2018)

## Do
The beach dominates the Essaouirans' leisure time. Although the strong wind and currents makes relaxed tanning and swimming a little difficult at times, it is perfect for kitesurfing and windsurfing. With good winds for most days of the year, Essaouira is a watersports' paradise. The best spots are reported to be Essaouira Bay, Sidi Kaouki, Cape Sim and Mouley Bouzertoune. Equipment can be hired from various hire centres on the beach front. However, this is not the ideal place to learn watersports, particularly kitesurfing. There tends to be a bit of a catch 22 - either its calm and you can't go out because there's no wind or its windy and you can't go out because there is a huge shore break. In addition the water can smell of sewage.
Camel and horse rides, quad-bikes, near the southern end of the main beach. A crowd of salesmen offering any type of rides can be found there throughout all day long.

## Buy
Essaouira's craftsmen are renowned for their woodwork and lacquerware. Intricately inlaid boxes, chessboards and curios can be found for good prices in the city's hundreds of shops; however, be aware that extensive deforestation is taking place in the area due to these woods not being replanted. Artwork of all kinds can be had here.
31.51407-9.767021 Baguette+. Great bakery. Anything without cream of chocolate is great. Go there in the morning to early afternoon. 2 dirham per piece.    (updated May 2019)
31.51416-9.767222 Rhassoul/ghassoul merchant. Essaouira seems a good place to get this product. This merchant sells proper rhassoul/ghassoul, i.e. wash soil. They sell natural and perfumed ½ kg bags. 8 dirham natural, 10 dirham with perfume.    (updated May 2019)

## Eat
Although Essaouira is on the sea, seafood sold to tourists can be quite expensive. Fishermen sell their catch through the market hall and you can have it cooked at the small stands nearby. Prices are clearly marked by weight on the large pricing board at the end of the fish market stalls, but this seems to make little difference to the chances of being hustled. Sample price: 5 dirham for pack of fresh sardines (10 one of them) in fish market. Carefully evaluate how much you are being charged. A cheaper option is to buy Harira (a spicy soup) for 5-8 dirham or a sandwich (i.e. at Blue facade for 10-20 dirham, walking at the street from fish stands to the Medina).
One of the best options is to buy your seafood from the dock (haggling sometimes required) where they sell everything from eels to sharks, then take your fish to the central market side streets (follow the smoke!) where they will grill it for you for only 5 dirham a grill rack, they will also grill your vegetables or make Moroccan salad. Seeing locals carry frozen fish in their hands around the corner to these stalls is common.
31.50949-9.774331 Fish Market, Essaouira local market. If you are a fish enthusiast, you should not miss the food in the market. Buy your fish (cheap, shrimps are 50 dirham/kilo, sardines 5-6 dirham) take it to the small kitchen/restaurant and let them cook it for you. They add salad, olives and bread for 25 dirham. buy the fish + 25 dirham for the baking.
There are many reasonable restaurants and cafés on the main streets and squares.
Berber Cafe, Ibn toumert (At Bab Kasbah take Derb Lalouj towards the sea;then take the second left turn down Ibn toumert. The cafe has a big pink door). Small friendly cafe, seats about 8 for meals and decor is mainly old boxing posters (husband used to coach), but the small menu is good and the prices are great. 30 dirham chicken/veg tangine, 20 dirham bean stew, 5 dirham tea, 4 dirham per sardine. (updated Jul 2017)
Chez Omar (In the Rue Khabdazine with 10 other restaurants with low prices.). Small street with restaurants that serve great and cheap food in huge quantities. If you order fish they buy it fresh from the market. 10-30 dirham chicken/veg tangine, 10 dirham bean stew, 20 dirham for a good fish tagine with bread.

Tagines 85-95 dirham, couscous 80-110 dirham, meat or fish 85-130 dirham.    (updated Mar 2015)
31.512816-9.7714854 Patisserie Driss, 10 rue El Hajjali (close to the main square). A great place for cakes and snacks.    (updated Mar 2015)
31.51386-9.771035 Shyadma's Vegan Food, 20, Rue Laalouj - Place El Khayma. Lovely vegan/vegetarian spot in the middle of Place El Khayma, a less visited place with many restaurants. Shyadma's is tiny, but everything is made from seasonal vegetables and fruits from the nearby market. You will most likely have to wait 15-20 minutes for your food, but it's well worth the wait. If you call this Moroccan slow food, you will be very right. A refreshing delight for foodies, especially vegetarians and vegans!
31.51227-9.772076 Taros, 2, rue de la Skala, ☏ +212 5244-76407. Combines a French-Moroccan restaurant, a gallery and a terrace bar with live local music and "5" (rue Youssef el fassi) for its elegant ex-pat vibe.    (updated Jan 2018)

## Drink
Some of the hotels have licensed bars, but it's hard to beat the terrace bar Taros for its view over the lively Place Moulay el Hassan and the harbour. Popular with locals and tourists, has decent music
An off-license, the only one in town, can be found outside of Bab Doukkala on the Boulevard al Massira, to the right. Just inside this gate is the "black market" for alcohol on religious holidays and at night. Just ask the boys selling loose cigarettes!
31.514933-9.7719451 Il Mare, 43, Rue Yaman. Has a nice terrace with a view over the sea and the bastion where you can have a drink. Although it scores mainly bad reviews from the tourists.    (updated Jan 2018)

## Sleep
If arriving by bus, locals may surround you as you exit offering discount riads or accommodation in their homes for as little as 150 dirham (can be negotiated down to 75 dirham), though you will not get a view of the ocean for this. There are many hotel options available so feel free to bypass them. You can always return to the bus station and they will still be there.

## Stay safe
Avoid the dealers selling "hash brownies" near the square, they are usually fake
Hashish is widely smoked in Morocco, but do not be fooled into thinking it is legal even if you see Moroccans smoking during the day. Smoking or being high in public is seen as a vice, especially near holy places, in the morning, or if you are drawing attention to yourself; use your judgement.

## Go next
Agadir — the modern resort city with its beaches.
Marrakesh — city of hustle and stepping off point for the Sahara.
El Jadida — A holiday destination for Moroccans that has similar history and sights.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

El Jadida (Arabic: الجديدة, romanized: al-Jadīda, [alʒadiːda]) is a major port city on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, located 96 kilometres (60 mi) south of the city of Casablanca, in the province of El Jadida and the region of Casablanca-Settat. It has a population of 170,956 as of 2023.
The fortified city, built by the Portuguese at the beginning of the 16th century and named Mazagan (Mazagão in Portuguese), was given up by the Portuguese in 1769 and incorporated into Morocco. El Jadida's old city sea walls are one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. The Portuguese Fortified City of Mazagan was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, on the basis of its status as an "outstanding example of the interchange of influences between European and Moroccan cultures" and as an "early example of the realisation of the Renaissance ideals integrated with Portuguese construction technology". According to UNESCO, the most important buildings from the Portuguese period are the cistern and the Church of the Assumption, both in a Manueline style.
The city is a popular resort and destination for both Moroccan and international tourists. An important industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, lies 20 kilometres to the south.

Names
El Jadida's other names and nicknames in other languages were: Cap Soleis, Portus Rutilis, Rusibis, Mazighen (Arabic: مازيغن), al-Breyja (Arabic: البريجة), Mazagão, al-Mahdouma (Arabic: المهدومة) and Mazagan. The city was renamed al-Jadida in 1820, meaning 'The New'.

History
El Jadida traces its origins to the 5th century BC, when it was founded and settled by the Phoenicians.
Prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, an anchorage used by boats appears to have existed at the current site of El Jadida throughout the Middle Ages and in ancient times. The name Mazighan was first documented by the 11th-century Arab geographer al-Bakri. In 1502 a Portuguese captain, Jorge de Mello, landed at this location, allegedly driven here by a storm. He and his crew took refuge in an abandoned tower, called al-Briya or al-Burayja, to defend themselves against any potential attack by the locals. After returning to Portugal, he obtained permission from the Portuguese king, Dom Manuel, to found a fortress here in 1505, but evidence indicates that he did not carry this out, as when the Portuguese army passed here on their way to conquer Azemmour in 1513 they found nothing but the old tower.
As Azemmour was difficult to access, the Portuguese returned and built a citadel at the more accessible Mazighan in the summer of 1514. This citadel was a rectangular building with four towers, one of which was the old tower that already stood here. The architects were two brothers, Diogo and Francisco de Arruda. The location then became known in the Portuguese language as Mazagão. During the next few decades the Sa'dids rose to power and began expelling the Portuguese from their coastal fortresses, with the most significant event being their expulsion from Santa Cruz (present-day Agadir) in 1541. In response, King João III of Portugal ordered the evacuation of Portuguese positions at Azemmour and Safi and concentrated on building a more defensible position at Mazagão instead. As a result, the Portuguese fortification was expanded into the larger walled fortress we see today in 1541.
The Kingdom of Portugal would continue to control the city until 1769, when they abandoned Mazagão, their last territory in Morocco. Upon their forced departure, the Portuguese destroyed the Governor's Bastion. Most of the Portuguese inhabitants were sent to the colony of Brazil, where they founded a new settlement called Nova Mazagão (the present Mazagão in the state of Amapá). The city was then taken over by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah in 1769 and remained largely uninhabited, having been dubbed al-Mahdouma ('The Ruined'). Eventually, Sultan Abd al-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) ordered that a mosque be built, and the destroyed portions of the city were rebuilt during his reign in the early nineteenth-century. In 1820 the city was renamed al-Jadida, meaning 'The New'. The town underwent a revival and soon outgrew Azemmour as the most important city in the area. Alongside the Muslim population was also a community of Jews, who participated in the city's revival.
At the beginning of the French Protectorate in Morocco (established in 1912), the city was developed as a tourist resort, one of the earliest initiatives to develop modern tourism in Morocco. By the 1930s it had a casino which was popular with European tourists and colonists. The importance of the city's port, however, declined as Casablanca grew into the major port and urban center of the country during this period. In the 1980s a large industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, was developed some 20 kilometres to the south. Aided by its UNESCO World Heritage Site designation since 2004, the city continues to be a tourist destination today.
During the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco, the historic Portuguese church in the old city was damaged. As of 13 September, cracks were observed in the church's tower and there was a risk of structural collapse.

Landmarks
Fortress of Mazagan
The design of the Fortress of Mazagan is a response to the development of modern artillery in the Renaissance. The star form of the fortress measures c 250m by 300m. The slightly inclined, massive walls are c 8m high on average, with a thickness of 10m, enclosing a patrolling peripheral walkway 2m wide. At the present time the fortification has four bastions: the Angel Bastion in the east, St Sebastian in the north, St Antoine in the west, and the Holy Ghost Bastion in the south. The fifth, the Governor's Bastion at the main entrance, is in ruins, having been destroyed by the Portuguese in 1769. Numerous colonial-era Portuguese cannons are still positioned on top of the bastions.
The fort had three gates: the Seagate, forming a small port with the north-east rampart, the Bull Gate in the north-west rampart, and the main entrance with a double arch in the centre of the south rampart, originally connected to land via a drawbridge. A ditch, c 20m wide and 3m deep, formerly filled with seawater, surrounded the fort. During the time of the French Protectorate the ditch was filled in with earth and a new entrance gate was opened leading to the main street, the Rua da Carreira, and to the Seagate. Along this street are situated the best preserved historic buildings, including the Catholic Church of the Assumption and the Portuguese cistern.

The Citadel
The Citadel, located at the heart of the walled city, was the first permanent Portuguese construction on this site in 1514. It is a building with a rectangular floor plan measuring about 47 by 56 metres (154 by 184 ft), with three major rooms around a central space and four towers (one at each corner). The southern El-Briya Tower (originally known as al-Burayja) was of local, pre-Portuguese origin and it was here that the Portuguese first took refuge when they arrived in 1502. One of the northern towers was later re-purposed as the base of a 19th-century minaret built for the nearby mosque. The cistern is located beneath the Citadel.

Portuguese cistern
The semi-subterranean chamber has a roughly square plan measuring around 33 to 34 metres (108 to 112 ft) per side, was constructed with five rows of five stone pillars and columns. The chamber is built in a late Gothic style known as Manueline, with a vaulted ceiling of brick masonry and stone ribs. Its original function is not clear. It may have been an armory, barracks, or granary, but it is recorded as having been converted into a cistern in 1541. It was designed by an architect named Miguel de Arruda but the construction work was delegated to João de Castilho. A round opening in the center of the chamber served to collect rainwater. The cistern is famous especially for the thin layer of water that covers the floor and creates fine and ever-changing reflections in the otherwise dark vaulted chamber. Its visual qualities are such that several movies have been filmed within the cavernous space, of which Orson Welles' Othello is the best known internationally.

Churches
The Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, a prominent building located south of the Citadel, was the main parish church of the Portuguese settlement. It was constructed or begun when the fortress was expanded in 1541. It has a nave, a choir, a sacristy, and a square-shafted bell tower. At least three other churches existed, though generally only partial remains of them are still present today. Two small churches were adjoined to some of the bastions of the fortress. Another, the Church of Mercy (Misericórdia) was part of the Citadel.

Synagogues
A number of synagogues also existed inside the old city, attesting to the importance of the Jewish community here in the 19th and 20th centuries. One prominently visible example is the Bensimon Synagogue, inaugurated in 1926 and attached to earlier structures in the northern corner of the former fortress. Its construction was sponsored by four brothers of the Bensimon family: Nessim, Messaoud, Abraham, and Mordechai.

Museum of Resistance and Independence
Located near the beach south of the old city and the port, this museum and exhibition space is dedicated to the memory of Moroccan soldiers and resistance to the French Protectorate regime. It is housed in a 20th-century colonial era building constructed in a "Mauresque" style.

Climate
El Jadida has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in El Jadida is 17.4 °C (63.3 °F). About 372 mm (14.65 in) of precipitation falls annually.

Economy
The city is a significant tourism destination thanks in part to its UNESCO-recognized historic heritage. A large five-star resort, the Mazagan Beach Resort, was opened in 2009 besides the nearby town of Azemmour, named in reference to the historic Portuguese fort. The resort was part of a wider strategy launched in 2001 by King Mohammed VI to boost tourism in Morocco by creating, with the help of foreign investors, large coastal resorts in El Jadida, Essaouira, Saïdia, and other cities on the Moroccan coast. The city is also a popular summer holiday resort for Moroccan families.
Since the 1980s the city's economy has benefited from the large industrial complex at Jorf Lasfar, located some 20 kilometres to the south. The complex, managed by the Office Chérifien du Phosphore, is the main processing center for the region's phosphate reserves and its port is used for exporting its related products. It also serves as a base for other industries.

Mazagan (en portugais : Mazagão) est le nom ancien de l'actuelle ville d'El Jadida, cité fortifiée édifiée par les Portugais au début du XVIe siècle sur les côtes du Maroc, qui fut reprise par les Marocains en 1769. Les fortifications de la cité portugaise, avec leurs bastions et remparts, constituent un exemple précoce de l’architecture militaire portugaise de la Renaissance. 
Les monuments portugais encore visibles sont la citerne portugaise, la forteresse portugaise et l’église de l’Assomption, construite dans le style manuélin. Cette ville est l'un des premiers établissements sur la route vers l'Inde des explorateurs portugais, elle offre un témoignage exceptionnel des influences croisées entre les cultures européenne et marocaine.
Le 30 juin 2004, lors de la 28e session du comité du patrimoine mondial, tenue à Suzhou en Chine, la ville marocaine de Mazagan (El Jadida) est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco.

Étymologie
Le site peut correspondre à l'une des sept colonies instaurées par l'amiral Hannon au milieu du Ve siècle av. J.-C. appelée le comptoir de « Rusbis ». Ce site a été signalé aussi bien par le navigateur Polybe en 150 av. J.-C., et le géographe Ptolémée, que par Pline l'Ancien, sous le nom de « Portus rutilis ».
Au début du XVIe siècle, les Portugais ont trouvé une petite tour en ruines abandonnée, utilisée auparavant comme poste de garde appelé « El Brija » diminutif de « borj ». Lors de la construction de la première citadelle, les Portugais l'ont appelée « Castello real ». Avec la reconstruction de la forteresse, la cité a pris provisoirement le nom de Sào Jorge
André Privé suppose que le mot est d'origine portugaise, et le géographe al Idrissi, dès le XIe siècle, écrivit le nom de la ville en écriture arabe sous le nom de Mazighan, certains supposent que cela signifiait « meules ». Cependant la version la plus plausible est celle de l'origine berbère. En effet, « Mazagan » veut dire en berbère « celle aux crinières », le mot « azagen » est le pluriel de « azag », qui veut dire crinière.
Après sa destruction, la ville a été appelée Al Mahdouma, c'est-à-dire, « la démolie », une fois construite, le nom d'el Jadida (« la nouvelle » ou « la neuve ») lui a été attribué

Histoire
Le site de Mazagan ou Mazagão, considéré comme une ville portugaise en terre marocaine, a été placé sous couronne portugaise dès 1486. Toutefois les Portugais ne s'y installent qu'à partir de 1502 en construisant une tour et quelques installations temporaires, et ce n'est qu'à partir de l'été de l'année 1514 que ces derniers décidèrent de construire par les frères Francisco et Diégo de Arruda une citadelle de forme carrée avec des tours dans chaque coin, l'une des tours est construite à l'emplacement de d'al-Buraidja .
En 1541, à la suite de la prise du fort de Santa-Cruz de Cap de Gué (Agadir), Jean III décida d'évacuer Safi et Azemmour pour se retrancher à Mazagan considérée comme la mieux protégée. La citadelle a été agrandie par la construction de fortifications. La conception fut confiée à un groupe d'ingénieurs et architectes, composé du Portugais Joao Ribeiro, de l'Espagnol Juan Castillo et de l'Italien Benedetto di Ravenna, c'est à cette époque que les murailles de la ville ont pris leur emplacement actuel.
En 1769, l'occupation de Mazagan - la dernière des forteresses portugaises au Maroc - prend fin à la suite du traité de paix signé avec le sultan Mohammed III du Maroc (1757- 1790), les Portugais quittèrent la ville par la porte de la mer le 10 mars 1769 ; ils minèrent l'entrée principale du fort qui explosa lorsque les Marocains forcèrent l'entrée ce qui provoqua la destruction du bastion du Gouverneur et d'une grande partie du rempart. La ville resta inhabitée pendant près d'un demi-siècle et fut appelée al-Mahdouma (la ruinée). 
En 1824, le sultan Abderrahman ordonna au pacha de la région de Doukkala et Tamesna, Sidi Mohamed Ben Tayeb, de restaurer l'ancienne ville portugaise en relevant les fortifications détruites et en construisant une mosquée.

La citerne
Cette vaste salle souterraine voûtée faisait partie du château fort construit en 1514 par les Portugais. Elle servit probablement de salle d'armes avant d'être utilisée comme réserve d'eau. Sur un plan carré de 34 m de côté, elle comporte six nefs dont les voûtes arêtes reposent sur 25 colonnes et piliers. La travée centrale est percée d'un large oculus par où se déverse la lumière du jour qui produit par réflexion sur l'eau de la citerne, un surprenant effet de miroir imprégnant le lieu d'une étrange atmosphère. La majestueuse citerne portugaise d'El Jadida séduisit Orson Welles au point qu'il y tourna certaines séquences de son film Othello. Quelques scènes des films Le Retour de l'étalon noir, produit par Francis Ford Coppola et Harem, d'Arthur Joffé, ont également été tournées ici.

La forteresse portugaise
La conception de la forteresse de Mazagan est à l'image du développement de l'artillerie moderne pendant la période de la Renaissance. Elle est construite en forme d'étoile, avec des murs de 250 à 300 mètres de côté. Légèrement inclinés, les murs massifs sont en moyenne de 8 mètres de haut, avec une épaisseur de 10 mètres, comportant un chemin de ronde de 2 mètres de largeur. Ces fortifications possèdent quatre bastions : le Bastion de l'Ange à l'est,  le Bastion Saint-Sébastien au nord, le Bastion Saint-Antoine, à l'ouest, et le Bastion du Saint-Esprit au sud. Le cinquième, le Bastion du Gouverneur, à l'entrée principale, est en ruines, après avoir été détruit par les Portugais en 1769. De nombreux canons de l'époque coloniale portugaise sont encore positionnés sur le dessus des bastions.
Le fort possédait trois portes: la Seagate ou porte de la mer, formant un petit port avec le rempart nord-est, la porte de Bull dans le rempart nord-ouest, et l'entrée principale d'un double arc dans le centre du rempart sud, à l'origine reliés à la terre par l'intermédiaire d'un pont-levis. Un fossé, de 20 mètres de large et 3 mètres de profondeur, rempli d'eau de mer, entourait le fort. Pendant le Protectorat français, le fossé a été comblé avec de la terre et une nouvelle entrée a été ouverte conduisant à la rue principale, la Rua da Carrera, et la Seagate. Le long de cette rue se trouvent les bâtiments historiques les mieux conservés, y compris l'église catholique de l'Assomption et la citerne.

Rabat (, also UK: , US: ; Arabic: الرباط, romanized: ar-Ribāṭ) is the capital city of Morocco and the country's seventh-largest city with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million. It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Salé, the city's main commuter town.
Rabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohads. After a period of growth, the city fell  into a long period of decline. In the 17th century, Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. When the French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912,  Rabat became its administrative center. When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Rabat became its capital.
Rabat, Temara, and Salé form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Rabat is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and its medina is listed as a World Heritage Site. It is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat–Salé Airport.

Etymology
The name Rabat comes from the Arabic word الرباط (a-Ribāṭ) meaning the ribat, an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for رباط الفتح (Ribāṭu al-Fatḥ) meaning the ribat of conquest or stronghold of victory—a title given by the Almohads when they established the city as a naval base in 1170.

History
Ancient Sala
In the first millennium BC the Phoenicians founded several trading colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now Morocco, but the existence of a Phoenician settlement in the area, called Sala or Shallat, has been debated by archeologists. By the first century BC the local inhabitants were still writing in the neo-Punic language, but the region came under the influence of Rome. It was controlled by the ancient Berber Mauretanian Kingdom until it was formally annexed by Rome in the first century BC. On the site now known as Chellah, just south of the walled city today, the Romans built a city named Sala Colonia. Excavations have revealed that older Mauretanian structures existed on the site before Roman structures were built over them. Along with Lixus, Sala Colonia was one of the two main naval outposts held by the Romans on the Atlantic coast of the Mauretania Tingitana province. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the Insula Purpuraria (Mogador island).
Archaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in North Africa during the 7th century. However, Sala began to be abandoned in the 5th century and was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century and established Islamic influence in the region.

Medieval Islamic period
In the 10th century the Umayyads of Cordoba, or their Zenata Berber allies in the region, founded a ribat or fortified monastery/outpost in this area, to defend against the Barghawata Berbers who had established a Kharijite state to the south. This ribat was most likely on the same site as the current Kasbah of the Udayas, but its location has not been confirmed by historians. Around 1030, a new town called Salā (the present Salé) was founded on the opposite side of the river (the north side) by the Banu 'Ashara family.
One of the last Almoravid emirs, Tashfin ibn Ali (r. 1143–1145) built a new ribat on the site of the current kasbah as part of his efforts to hold back the Almohads. Almohads nonetheless defeated the Almoravids and destroyed the ribat shortly after. In 1150 or 1151 the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min built a new kasbah (citadel) to replace the former ribat, within which he included a palace and a mosque. This Almohad kasbah corresponds to the current Kasbah of the Udayas (which was expanded in later periods). Abd al-Mu'min also had an underground canal dug to divert a water source to this location, allowing for future settlement and urbanization in the area. The site became a military staging ground for Almohad armies setting out on campaigns to Al-Andalus.
The Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199) embarked on an ambitious project to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called al-Mahdiyya or Ribat al-Fath, on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque (the remains of which include the Hassan Tower) and of new grand gateways such as Bab er-Rouah and the main gate of the kasbah, now known as Bab Udaya or Bab al-Kbir. After al-Mansur's death in 1199 the mosque and the capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The new city was never fully inhabited and the site was practically abandoned.
During the Marinid dynasty period (13th to 15th centuries), the town of Salé across the river grew more important than the settlements of the south bank. In 1515 Leo Africanus reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. The Marinids did build a Great Mosque in what is now the medina of Rabat and on the nearby site of Chellah (ancient Sala) they built a royal necropolis for their dynasty.

Corsair republic
In 1609, Philip III decreed the expulsion of all Moriscos (people of Muslim or Moorish descent) from Spain. About 2000 of these refugees, originally from the town of Hornachos near Badajoz, Spain, settled around Salé and occupied the kasbah, attracting between 5000 and 14,000 other Moriscos to join them. Rabat and neighboring Salé united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627. This autonomous republic became a base for corsairs: pirates, also known as the "Salé Rovers", who preyed on merchant ships around the shores of Western Europe. 
During this time, the area below the kasbah on the south bank became more heavily populated, thanks to the Morisco and Andalusi refugees. A new "Andalusian Wall" was built to delimit this area in the northern part of the former Almohad walled city. What is now known as the Street of the Consuls became an important road artery even at this time. The name "Rabat" was not yet in use; the city of the south bank was known as "New Salé" while the city of the north bank was known as "Old Salé". Corsair activities were based in New Salé, whereas the inhabitants of Old Salé generally did not participate in piracy.

'Alawi rule
The pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until al-Rashid, the founder of the 'Alawi dynasty, conquered the area in 1666 and united most of Morocco under his rule. Nonetheless, the 'Alawi sultans allowed the piracy to continue up until the reign of Moulay Slimane in the early 19th century. This led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.

During the early part of the 'Alawi period (17th–18th centuries), the sultans took some interest in the city of the south bank and carried out constructions and repairs to the kasbah. Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672–1727) expanded the kasbah southward and built a royal residence within it towards the end of the 17th century (it serves as a museum today). Moulay Isma'il was also responsible for settling a part of the Udayas (or Oudayas), a guich tribe (military tribe serving the sultan's army), in the kasbah to serve as a counterbalancing force against other unruly tribes in the region. Under Sidi Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah (r. 1757–1790), a new royal palace, the Dar al-Makhzen, was established in the southwest part of the Almohad walled area towards the end of the 18th century. These additions began to give the city the character and function of a royal residence used by the ruling dynasty outside their main capitals.
Moulay Slimane (r. 1792–1822) built another palace along the seaside called Dar al-Bahr and built new mosques such as the Moulay Slimane Mosque. He also ordered the creation of a Jewish quarter, the Mellah, in the eastern part of the Andalusian medina, in a formerly occupied by orchards. It was also towards the beginning of the 19th century that the city walls, formerly limited to the Almohad-era perimeter, were extended significantly to the southwest, thus expanding the city to cover around 840 hectares. The old Almohad walls and gates were still retained and the Almohad-era enclosure remained a more privileged district containing the city's major monuments and its imperial residence. Most of the population remained concentrated in the medina behind the Andalusian Wall in the northern section. In the 1850s, Moulay Abd ar-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) further developed and completed the Dar al-Makhzen palace in the southwest corner of this enclosure. At the end of the 19th century or beginning of the 20th century, the city had some 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants.

20th century
French colonial rule
The French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey's occupation of Oujda in March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca in August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate in March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey decided to relocate the country's capital from Fes to Rabat after the riots of 1912 following the Treaty of Fes. Lyautey appears to have had a personal affinity for Rabat. He argued that its coastal location was more pleasant and more accessible, and that its proximity to Casablanca, which he estimated would become the major economic center, would be advantageous. In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost to design the Ville Nouvelle (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector, as he did in other major Moroccan cities.
The colonial period resulted in major economic changes as well as accelerated urbanization. Prior to this period, the major cities of Morocco had always been Fez and Marrakesh, while the coastal cities were relatively small. Census figures are not available for the early years of the Protectorate, but in 1912 Rabat and nearby Salé can be estimated to have had about 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants at most, according to Janet Abu-Lughod. One early French survey, based on the number of houses rather than a formal census, estimated the population of Rabat to be 25,642. A formal census in 1921 counted the population as 33,714. Some of this growth was due to the immigration of foreigners. In 1921, 59% of the population were Moroccan Muslims and 10% were Moroccan Jews, while 21.4% were French nationals and another 10% were foreigners of other origin. Nearby Salé, however, remained more homogenously Moroccan. Rabat's population grew to approximately 83,000 in 1936 and to approximately 156,000 in 1952.

Post World War II and independence
When Morocco achieved independence in 1956, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat. Rabat's growth continued unabated. The most important demographic shift after independence was the exodus of foreign nationals and their replacement by Moroccans, who gradually took over the jobs and functions that the foreigners had occupied. In the census of 1971, the population of Rabat had grown to around 368,000, of which only 3.5% were foreigners.
Following World War II, the United States had established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base. By the early 1950s, Rabat Salé Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country. With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959. With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Salé in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base Nº 1, a status it continues to hold.
The fifth Arab League summit took place in Rabat in 1969 to discuss the arson of Al-Aqsa Mosque by Australian citizen Denis Michael Rohan. In the same year, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an organization that aims to protect the interests of the Muslim world, was founded at a summit in Rabat. The 1974 Arab League summit was also held in Rabat. The summit recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In 1985, the sixth edition of the Pan Arab Games was held in Rabat.
In 2015, the city became part of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. On 28 February 2024, Asmaa Rhlalou declared her resignation, months after she sparked a controversy that called into doubt her authority and validity within the City Council.

Geography
Neighbourhoods of Rabat
Rabat is an administrative city. It has many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:
The heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.
To the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.
First, around the ramparts, there is the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l'Océan and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.
To the east, along the Bouregreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda (mostly middle class); Aviation (middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.
Between the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (lavish villas, embassies, well-off residential neighborhood).
On the outskirts of Souissi, are a number of less-dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.

Subdivisions
The prefecture is divided administratively into the following:

Climate
Rabat features a Mediterranean climate (Csa) with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub 0 °C (32 °F) sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about 7–8 °C (13–14 °F). The winter highs typically reach only 17.2 °C (63.0 °F) in December–February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around 27 °C (80.6 °F), but may occasionally exceed 40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between 11 and 19 °C (51.8 and 66.2 °F) and rarely exceeding 20 °C (68.0 °F). Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560 mm (22 in). The airport station is located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the coastline, which will somewhat warm afternoons and cool nights down compared to a seaside location.

Culture
The biggest place for theatre is the Mohammed V Theatre in the centre of the town, which was opened in 1962. Construction on a new performing arts center, the Grand Theatre of Rabat, began in 2014. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it will reportedly be the largest theater in the Arab world and in Africa. It was scheduled to open in 2021.
Many organizations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L'appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002 and introduced international and local artists. Other independent spaces opened few years after, such as Le Cube, also set up in a private space.

Mawazine
Mawazine is a music festival in Rabat organized under the auspices of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, that started in 2001 where music groups, fans and spectators come together in a week-long celebration of culture and music both locally and internationally. Musicians such as Scorpions, The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Kanye West, Pitbull, Rihanna, Elton John, Stromae and many others have performed at the festival.
Mawazine was host to more than 2,500,000 in 2013. Workshops are available for teaching dances and other arts. The festival is free. However, while most areas are free, there are those that require payment, specifically the smaller stages being the historical site of Chellah, the Mohammed V National Theater, and the Renaissance Cultural Center.

Places of worship
The places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques. The oldest mosque in the city is the "Old Mosque" (Jama' al-'Atiqa) in the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was originally founded during Abd al-Mu'min's construction of the kasbah in 1150, though its current form mostly dates from an 18th-century restoration. Other important mosques include the Great Mosque in the old medina, also known as the el-Kharrazin Mosque, and the As-Sunna Mosque in central Rabat, originally completed in 1785 by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah.

The last remaining synagogues in Rabat are the Rabbi Shalom Zaoui synagogue and the Talmud Torah Synagogue. There are also Christian churches and temples, including an Evangelical church and St. Peter's Cathedral (Cathédrale de Saint-Pierre), which hosts the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabat.

Museums and parks
The Oudayas Museum (also formerly known as the National Museum of Jewellery) is housed in a pavilion residence built by Sultan Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672–1727) inside the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was first opened in 1915, making it one of the oldest public museums in Morocco. Its collections, augmented by private donations, feature diverse objects from throughout Morocco, mostly from the 18th to 20th centuries. In 2006 it became the National Museum of Jewellery, with exhibits focusing on the history of Moroccan jewellery. As of 2019 it was under renovations to be transformed into a new museum to be called Musée du caftan et de la parure ('Museum of the caftan and adornment').
The Museum of History and Civilizations (formerly the National Archeological Museum) showcases the history of Morocco through a collection of archeological artifacts from the Punic, Mauretanian, Roman, and Islamic periods. This includes a collection of ancient Roman bronze and marble statuary from sites such as Lixus, Volubilis, and Chellah, as well as coins, ceramics, and architectural fragments from the Islamic period.
The Rabat Zoo (officially called the Zoological Garden of Rabat) was opened in 1973, in part to house the lions that were previously kept at the Royal Palace. The lions are descended from the now-extinct Barbary lions. Since then the zoo has expanded to house some 1800 animals and has engaged in conservation efforts.
The Bank al-Maghrib Museum was inaugurated in 2002 and is housed at the Bank al-Maghrib building downtown. Its main exhibits include a collection of coins and currency from ancient times to the modern era, as well as a gallery of Orientialist art. The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art was inaugurated in 2014.

Historic monuments
The Kasbah of the Udayas (also spelled "Kasbah of the Oudaias") is the oldest part of the present-day city, built by the Almohads in the 12th century. It was later refortified and expanded by the corsairs and the 'Alawi dynasty in the 17th and 18th centuries. The kasbah is now a residential district with traditional houses painted white and blue on the outside. Its southern section includes the "Andalusian Garden", landscaped in the 20th century.
The city's historic walls were first built by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur and completed in 1197, with later additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. A number of monumental gates are found along the walls, the most notable being Bab er-Rouah. The other Almohad-era gates are Bab el-Had, Bab al-Alou, Bab Zaers, and Bab al-Hadid, though many of them were modified in more recent periods. The 17th-century Andalusian Wall, which divides the zone inside the Almohad walls, has five more gates: Bab Jdid (formerly Bab Teben, mostly demolished), Bab al-Bouiba, Bab Chellah, Bab Mellah, and Bab Diouana.
The old medina, located below the kasbah and above the line of the Andalusian Wall, contains many historic mosques and traditional houses. The rest of the area within the Almohad walls but south of the Andalusian Wall was largely built up in the 20th century when Rabat became the capital during the French Protectorate. These districts contain numerous public buildings and apartment blocs built in contemporary styles of that period, such as neo-Moorish (known as néo-Mauresque or arabisant in French), Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and modern architecture. Examples of these include the Bank al-Maghrib building (built in the 1920s), the Central Post Office building (circa 1921, expanded in 1930s), the Parliament building (built in the 1920s), St.-Peter's Cathedral (inaugurated in 1921, with later additions), the Rabat-Ville train station (early 1920s), and some of the apartment blocs on Rue Gaza (built or begun in the 1930s), among others.
Overlooking the shores of the river is the Hassan Tower, a monumental unfinished minaret constructed by Ya'qub al-Mansur in the late 12th century. It was built for an enormous mosque planned as part of the larger city al-Mansur was constructing. Across from the tower today, at the southern end of the mosque's remains, is the Mausoleum of Mohammed V (d. 1961), which houses the remains of King Mohammed V and King Hassan II. The mausoleum, completed in 1971, was designed in a neo-Moorish or Moroccan revivalist style by Vietnamese architect Cong Vo Toan.

A short distance south of the historic city walls is the archeological site of Chellah, a walled enclosure containing a 13th to 14th-century Marinid funerary and religious complex as well as the ruins of the Roman city of Sala Colonia. Across the river is the city of Salé, which also preserves a historic medina. The medina of Salé includes monuments from the Marinid period such as Bab Mrissa and the Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan as well as landmarks from later periods.

الرِّبَاط(ملاحظة 1) (بالأمازيغية: ⵕⵕⴱⴰⵟ) هي العاصمة الإدارية الرسمية للمملكة المغربية، وجماعة ذات طابَع حضري تقع بجهة الرباط سلا القنيطرة، يبلُغ عدد سكانها 515,619 نسمة بحسَب إحصاء 2024. تقع على ساحل المحيط الأطلسي، وعلى الضفة اليسرى لمصب نهر أبي رقراق الذي يفصلها عن مدينة سلا. تشتهر المدينة بصناعة النسيج كما توجد بها جامعة محمد الخامس أول جامعة حديثة أُسِّسَتْ في المغرب بعد الاستقلال.
أُسست العاصمة الحالية للمغرب خلال أزمنة تاريخية مختلفة، فكانت بداية معالمها التأسيسية خلال حقبة المرابطين الذي جعلوا منها رباطًا منيعًا ونقطة لصد وردع هجمات البورغواطيين، وبعد سقوطهم تسلَّم مشعلها الموحدون في القرن الثاني عشر فجعلوا منها مدينة محصنة تنطلق منها الجيوش إلى الأندلس، شملت بالإضافة إلى القلعة، مسجدًا ودارًا للخلافة، ويعتبر يعقوب المنصور، المؤسس الحقيقي لمدينة «رِباط الفتح» التي جعل منها عاصمة لدولته وأمر بتحصين كافة أسوارها، فيما ذكر عدة مؤرخين أن اكتمال بناء المدينة كان في عهد أبي يوسف المنصور، بما في ذلك السور والبوابات، فنمت المدينة في البداية إلا أنها ما لبثت أن دخلت في فترة طويلة من الانحدار بعد انهيار الموحدين. وخلال القرن السابع عشر، أصبحت الرباط ملاذًا لقراصنة البربر. عندما فرض الفرنسيون حماية على المغرب في عام 1912، جعلوا الرباط مركزها الإداري. وعندما حصل المغرب على استقلاله في عام 1956، أصبحت الرباط عاصمته.
تضم المدينة بالإضافة لكل من تمارة وسلا المجاورتين أكثر من 1.8 مليون نسمة. قللت مشكلات الطمي المرتبطة بالميناء من دور الرباط كميناء؛ ومع ذلك، تحتفظ الرباط وسلا بصناعات مهمة كالنسيج ومعالجة الأغذية والبناء. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تجعل السياحة ووجود جميع السفارات الأجنبية في المغرب الرباط واحدة من أهم المدن في البلاد. تم تصنيف الرباط عاصمة المغرب في المركز الثاني من قبل شبكة سي إن إن في قائمتها لأفضل وجهات السفر لعام 2013. إنها واحدة من عواصم المغرب التاريخية الأربع، والمدينة القديمة في الرباط مدرجة كموقع تراث عالمي. يمكن الوصول إلى الرباط عن طريق القطار من خلال شبكة قطارات المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية وعن طريق الطائرة من خلال مطار الرباط سلا الدولي.

التسمية
يأتي اسم الرباط من الكلمة العربية الرباط التي تعني الرباط، وهو قاعدة إسلامية أو حصن. هذا الاسم هو اختصار لرباط الفتح بمعنى معقل النصر، وهو لقب أطلقه الموحدون عندما أسسوا المدينة كقاعدة بحرية.

جغرافيا
تضاريس
الرباط هي مدينة ساحلية تطل على المحيط الأطلسي، تنتمي لهضبة زعير السفلى، وتعتبر عاصمة منطقة زعير.

مناخ
مناخ المدينة مناخ متوسطي شبه رطب يخضع للمؤثرات البحرية.

التقسيم الإداري
تُصنف مدينة الرباط من حيث التقسيم الإداري للمغرب والذي صدر سنة 2015، كعمالة، تتكون بالأساس من ست مقاطعات هي أكدال-الرياض، والتواركة، والسويسي، واليوسفية، وحسان، ويعقوب المنصور، تتكون بدورها من مجموعة من الأحياء، ولكل من هذه المقاطعات مجلس يدير شؤونها ويسهر على خدمة سكانها.

التاريخ
تاريخ قديم
الحقبة الفينيقية
في الألفية الأولى قبل الميلاد، أسس الفينيقيون العديد من المستعمرات التجارية على طول الساحل الأطلسي لما يعرف الآن بالمغرب، ولكن وجود مستوطنة فينيقية في المنطقة، تسمى سلا أو شلات، كان محل نقاش من قبل علماء الآثار. بحلول القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، كان السكان المحليون لا يزالون يكتبون باللغة البونية الجديدة.

الحقبة الرومانية
المنطقة أصبحت تحت تأثير روما. كانت تحت سيطرة المملكة الأمازيغية الموريتانية القديمة حتى ضمتها روما رسميًا في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. في الموقع المعروف الآن باسم شالة ، جنوب المدينة المسورة اليوم ، بنى الرومان مدينة تسمى سالا كولونيا. كشفت الحفريات أن الهياكل الموريتانية القديمة كانت موجودة في الموقع قبل بناء الهياكل الرومانية عليها إلى جانب العرائش ، كانت سالا كولونيا واحدة من أهم نقطتين بحريتين رئيسيتين اللتين يسيطر عليهما الرومان على ساحل المحيط الأطلسي لمقاطعة موريتانيا الطنجية. تم استخدام ميناء سالا الذي اختفى الآن من قبل السفن الرومانية التجارية كمحطة طريق على ممراتهم الجنوبية الغربية المؤدية إلى أنفا وإينسولا بوربوراريا جزيرة موغادور. تشهد القطع الأثرية ذات الأصل القوطي الغربي والبيزنطي والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقة على استمرار العلاقات التجارية أو السياسية بين سالا وأوروبا الرومانية ، حتى تأسيس الوجود البيزنطي في شمال إفريقيا خلال القرن السابع. ومع ذلك ، بدأ التخلي عن سالا في القرن الخامس وكانت في الغالب في حالة خراب عندما وصل العرب المسلمون في القرن السابع وأقاموا نفوذًا إسلاميًا في المنطقة.

العصر الوسيط
العهد المرابطي
يرجع تاريخ مدينة الرباط عاصمة المملكة المغربية إلى فترات تاريخية مختلفة. إلا أن التأسيس الأولي للمدينة يعود إلى عهد المرابطين الذين أنشأوا رباطاً محصناً، ذلك أن هاجس الأمن كان أقوى العوامل التي كانت وراء هذا الاختيار ليكون نقطة لتجمع المجاهدين ورد الهجومات البرغواطية.

العهد الموحدي
عرفت المدينة خلال العهد الموحدي إشعاعاً تاريخياً وحضارياً، حيث تم تحويل الرباط (الحصن) في عهد عبد المؤمن الموحدي إلى قصبة محّصنة لحماية جيوشه التي كانت تنطلق في حملات جهادية صوب الأندلس. وفي عهد حفيده يعقوب المنصور، أراد أن يجعل من رباط الفتح عاصمة لدولته. فأمر بتحصينها بأسوار متينة، وشيّد بها عدة بنايات، من أشهرها مسجد حسان بصومعته الشامخة. وفي القرن الرابع عشر بدأت الرباط تعرف اضمحلالاً بسبب المحاولات المتتالية للمرينيين للاستيلاء عليها، وأنشؤو مقبرة ملكية بموقع شالة.
شيد السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي سوراً عُرف بالسور الموحدي، بلغ طوله 2263م. وهو يمتد من الغرب حتى جنوب مدينة الرباط، ويبلغ عرضه 2.5 م وعلوه 10 مترا، هذا السور مدعّم بأربعة وسبعين برجاً، كما تتخلله 5 أبواب (باب العلو، باب الاحد، باب الرواح وباب زعير).
بقي موقع شالة في الرباط مهجوراً منذ القرن الخامس حتى القرن العاشر الميلادي حيث تحوّل الموقع إلى رباط يتجمع فيه المجاهدون لمواجهة قبيلة برغواطة. لكن هذه المرحلة التاريخية تبقى غامضة إلى أن اتخذ السلطان المريني أبو يوسف يعقوب سنة 1284 م من الموقع مقبرة لدفن ملوك بني مرين وأعيانهم، حيث شيد النواة الأولى لمجمعٍ ضمّ مسجداً وداراً للوضوء وقبة دفنت بها زوجته أم العز.
حظيت شالة في عهد السلطان أبي الحسن باهتمام بالغ. وبنى ابنه السلطان أبو عنان المدرسة شمال المسجد والحمام والنزالة، وزين أضرحة أجداده بقبب مزخرفة تعتبر نموذجاً حياً للفن المعماري المتميز لدولة بني مرين. تراجعت شالة مباشرة بعد قرار المرينيين بإعادة فتح مقبرة القلة بفاس، فأهملت بناياتها، وتعرضت في بداية القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي للنّهب والتدمير، وأصبحت تدريجياً مقبرة ومحجاً لساكني المنطقة، ومعلمة تاريخية.

يرجع تاريخ شالة القديم إلى عهد البربر الاقدمين سكان هذا القطر الأصلين. حيث تعاقب الملك فيهم أحيانا وأزمانا وأوليتهم في المغرب منذ أحقاب متطاولة لا يعلم مبدأها إلا الله تعالى كما قال ابن خلدون ،فتكون شالة القديمة بناء الملوك البربر. كما صرح الزياني في الترجمانة أنها من بناء الاسكندر ذي القرنين أو إفريقش الحميري الذي دخل المغرب، وأنه أول من أدخل الأمازيغ إليه، وقيل إن تاريخ شالة القديم إنما يرجع لعهد الفنيقيين القرطاجيين حيث أثبت التاريخ أنها كانت من أهم مراكز التاريخ. بل كانت عاصمتهم الإستعمارية كما صرح به جوزيف كانال في قوله على مسافة اثنين كيلومتر من منارة حسان يوجد خراب هضبة شالة التي كانت عاصمة القرطاجيين بعمالة طنجة.وكما كانت عاصمتهم الاستعمارية الإدارية فقد كانت أيضا عاصمتهم التجارية توافيها سفنهم بأنواع المناجر وضروب المتاع وتصدر عنها مواد الجلد والعاج وريش النعام والأصمخ العنبرية وسواها حتى الفيلة التي كان الفنيقيون يستعملوها في حروبهم كما أشار له ابلين تاريخه. ولما دالت الدولة للرومان بالمغرب كانت شالة من أهم مستعمراتهم التي استعمروها مثل وليلي، وطنجةوكانت تنسب إليهم نظرا لما أحدثوه بداخلها من البناءات المتعددة والآثار المتنوعة. واستمرت لمدة خمسمائة عام إلى أن جاء قوم الواندال الكوطيون واستولوا على شطوط إفريقية وخربوا مدن الرومان ومستعمراتهم فكانت شالة جملة ماخربوه . كما صرح به ليون الافريقي. وهذا مما يعود إلى تاريخ شالة القديم.

العهد المريني
في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي (وتحديدا سنة 1339) أحيط الموقع بسور خماسي الأضلاع مدعم بعشرين برجاً مربعاً وثلاث بوابات، أكبرها وأجملها زخرفة وعمارة الباب الرئيسي للموقع المقابل للسور الموحدي لرباط الفتح. أما داخل الموقع فقد تم تشييد أربع مجموعات معمارية مستقلة ومتكاملة تجسد كلها عظمة مقبرة شالة ومكانتها على العهد المريني. ففي الزاوية الغربية للموقع ترتفع بقايا النزالة التي كانت تأوي الحجاج والزوار. وفي الجزء السفلي تنتصب بقايا المقبرة المرينية المعروفة بالخلوة، والتي تضم مسجداً ومجموعة من القبب، أهمها قبة السلطان أبي الحسن وزوجته شمس الضحى، والمدرسة التي تبقى منارتها المكسوة بزخرفة هندسية متشابكة ومتكاملة وزليجها المتقن الصنع، نموذجاً أصيلاً للعمارة المغربية في القرن الرابع عشر. وفي الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية للموقع يوجد الحمام المتميز بقببه النصف دائرية، التي تحتضن أربع قاعات متوازية: الأولى لخلع الملابس والثانية باردة والثالثة دافئة والرابعة أكثر سخونة. أما حوض النون، فيقع في الجهة الجنوبية الغربية للخلوة، وقد كان في الأصل قاعة للوضوء لمسجد أبي يوسف، وقد نسجت حوله الذاكرة الشعبية خرافات وأساطير جعلت منه مزاراً لفئة عريضة من ساكنة الرباط ونواحيها.العه

جمهورية أبي رقراق
في عهد السعديين عام 1609 سمح للأفواج الأخيرة من المسلمين القادمين من الأندلس بالإقامة بالمدينة، وقد شيّد المورسكيون السور الأندلسي وهو يقع على بعد 21 متراً تقريباً جنوب باب الاحد، ليمتد شرقا إلى برج سيدي مخلوف. وفي هذا العهد تم توحيد العدوتين (مدينة الرباط وسلا) تحت حكم دويلة أبي رقراق، التي أنشأها الموريسكيون. ومنذ ذلك الحين اشتهر مجاهدو القصبة بنشاطهم البحري، وعرفوا عند الأوربيين باسم «قراصنة سلا». وقد استمروا في جهادهم ضد البواخر الأوربية إلى غاية سنة 1829.

عهد الإحتلال الفرنسي
و في عام 1912 أصبحت الرباط المقر الرئيس للمقيم العام الفرنسي، وبعد الاستقلال ظلت عاصمة للمغرب.

السكان
تضم المدينة 515,619 نسمة حسب (إحصاء 2024)

مهاجرو الأندلس
كانت الرباط مدينة مضيافة آوت الأندلسيين الذين لجؤوا إليها بعد طردهم من إسبانيا واستقروا فيها على موجات متلاحقة بين القرنين الثالث عشر والرابع عشر، وجاءت أولى هذه الموجات عام 1239م وكانت تضم مهاجرين من بلنسية وأنحاء أندلسية أخرى، وضمن الموجة الأخيرة، وصل آلاف الموريسكيين الذي طردوا بقرار من الملك فيليب الثالث في عام 1609م واستقروا في قصبة الوداية وبنوا المدينة الحالية، ولايزالون يحتفظون بفنونهم وصنائعهم الرفيعة، ولا تزال كنية بعض العائلات اليوم شاهدة على أصلها الأندلسي مثل، مُلين (العائلة الأموية الأصل) وتريدانو وبالأمينو وبيرو وفينجيرو وبركاش (أصلهم من نبلاء إسبانيا) وبالافريج وبن عمرو (العائلة الأنصارية الأصل) وغيرهم.

المعالم السياحية والطبيعية
إن بابَيْ «الرواح» و«الأوداية» اللذان يقعان في الجانب الغربي من السور، ويتميزان بهندستهما المعمارية التاريخية وزخارفهما المشبّكة وأفاريزهما المنقوشة بعبارات كتبت بالخط الكوفي، يعتبران من الإنجازات المتميزة للفن الموحدي في أوج ازدهاره، وقد تحول البابان حاليا إلى صالات للمعارض الفنية خاصة الرسم، حيث يعرض برواقه أشهر الرسامين المغاربة والعالميين. ويتعيّن أيضا إبراز مكانة انقاض مسجد حسان الضخمة التي تمتد على مساحة هكتارين ونصف، وقد بقي المسجد دون أن يكتمل إنجازه، أما مئذنته الشهيرة فلا تزال شاهدا حيا على أكبر مشروع عمراني قام به الموحدون.
بجواره نجد ضريح الملك الراحل محمد الخامس والذي دفن به ابنه الملك الحسن الثاني.

قصبة الأوداية
كانت قصبة الأوداية في الأصل قلعة محصنة، تم تشييدها من طرف المرابطين لمحاربة قبائل برغواطية، وازدادت أهميتها في عهد الموحدين، الذين جعلوا منها رباطاً على مصب وادي أبي رقراق لشن حملات عسكرية ضد الإسبان وأطلقوا عليها اسم المهدية. بعد الموحدين، أصبحت مهملة إلى أن استوطنها الموريسكيون الذين جاءوا من الأندلس، فأعادوا إليها الحياة بتدعيمها بأسوار محصنة وجعلها مقرا لدويلة أبي رقراق التاريخية. وفي عهد العلويين، عرفت قصبة الأوداية عدة تغييرات وإصلاحات ما بين سنة 1757 و1789، وكذلك ما بين سنة 1790 و1792. وقد عرف هذا الموقع تاريخاً متنوعاً ومتميزاً، يتجلى خصوصاً في المباني التي تتكون منها قصبة الأوداية. فسورها الموحدي وبابها الأثري (الباب الكبير) يعتبران من رموز الفن المعماري الموحدي، بالإضافة إلى مسجدها المعروف بالجامع العتيق.
أما المنشآت العلوية فتتجلى في الأسوار الرشيدية، والقصر الأميري الذي يقع غرباً وكذلك منشأتها العسكرية كبرج صقالة.

شالة
بقيت شالة مهجورة منذ القرن الخامس حتى القرن العاشر الميلادي حيث تحول الموقع إلى رباط يتجمع فيه المجاهدون لمواجهة قبيلة برغواطة لكن هذه المرحلة التاريخية تبقى غامضة إلى أن اتخذ السلطان المريني أبو يوسف يعقوب سنة 1284م من الموقع مقبرة لدفن ملوك وأعيان بني مرين حيث شيد النواة الأولى لمجمع ضم مسجدا ودارا للوضوء وقبة دفنت بها زوجته أم العز. حضيت شالة على عهد السلطان أبي الحسن باهتمام بالغ. أما ابنه السلطان أبو عنان فقد أتم المشروع، فبنى المدرسة شمال المسجد والحمام والنزالة وزين أضرحة أجداده بقبب مزخرفة تعتبر نموذجا حيا للفن المعماري المتميز لدولة بني مرين.
تراجعت شالة مباشرة بعد قرار المرينيين بإعادة فتح مقبرة القلة بفاس، فأهملت بناياتها، بل وتعرضت في بداية القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي للنهب والتدمير لتحتفظ بقدسيتها العريقة وتعيش بفضل ذكريات تاريخها القديم على هامش مدينة رباط الفتح، وتصبح تدريجيا مقبرة ومحجا لساكنة المنطقة، بل معلمة تاريخية متميزة تجتذب الأنظار. في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي (1339) أحيط الموقع بسور خماسي الأضلاع مدعم بعشرين برجا مربعا وثلاث بوابات أكبرها وأجملها زخرفة وعمارة الباب الرئيسي للموقع المقابل للسور الموحدي لرباط الفتح. أما داخل الموقع فقد تم تشييد أربع مجموعات معمارية مستقلة ومتكاملة تجسد كلها عظمة ومكانة مقبرة شالة على العهد المريني. ففي الزاوية الغربية للموقع ترتفع بقايا النزالة التي كانت تأوي الحجاج والزوار وفي الجزء السفلي تنتصب بقايا المقبرة المرينية المعروفة بالخلوة، والتي تضم مسجدا ومجموعة من القبب أهمها قبة السلطان أبي الحسن وزوجته شمس الضحى، والمدرسة التي تبقى منارتها المكسوة بزخرفة هندسية متشابكة ومتكاملة وزليجها المتقن الصنع نموذجا أصيلا وأصليا للعمارة المغربية في القرن الرابع عشر.
في الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية للموقع يوجد الحمام المتميز بقبته النصف دائرية، التي تحتضن أربع قاعات متوازية:

الأولى لخلع الملابس
الثانية باردة
الثالثة دافئة
الرابعة أكثر سخونة.
أما حوض النون، فيقع في الجهة الجنوبية الغربية للخلوة وقد كان في الأصل قاعة للوضوء لمسجد أبي يوسف، وقد نسجت حوله الذاكرة الشعبية خرافات وأساطير جعلت منه مزارا لفئة عريضة من ساكنة الرباط ونواحيها.

السور الموحدي
شيد هذا السور من طرف السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي، حيث يبلغ طوله 2263م، وهو يمتد من الغرب حتى جنوب مدينة الرباط، ويبلغ عرضه 2.5م وعلوه 10 أمتار وهذا السور مدعم ب 74 برجا، كما تتخلله 5 أبواب ضخمة.

صومعة حسان
تعد واحدة من بين المباني التاريخية المتميزة بمدينة الرباط التي تقع عليها عين الزائر، شيد من طرف السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي، كان يعتبر من أكبر المساجد في عهده. لكن هذا المشروع الطموح توقف بعد وفاته سنة 1199م، كما تعرض للاندثار بسبب الزلزال الذي ضربه سنة 1755م.
وتشهد آثاره على مدى ضخامة البناية الأصلية للمسجد، حيث يصل طوله إلى 180 مترا وعرضه 140 مترا، كما تشهد الصومعة التي تعد إحدى الشقيقات الثلاث لصومعة الكتبية بمراكش، والخيرالدا بإشبيلية على وجود المسجد وضخامته. هي مربعة الشكل تقف شامخة حيث يصل علوها 44 مترا، ولها مطلع داخلي ملتو، يؤدي إلى أعلى الصومعة ويمر على ست غرف تشكل طبقات. وقد زينت واجهاتها الأربع بزخارف ونقوش مختلفة على الحجر المنحوت وذلك على النمط الأندلسي المغربي من القرن الثاني عشر.

تقع مغارة دار السلطان جنوب الرباط على الساحل المحيط الأطلسي. بيّنت طبقات الموقع وجود مستويات ترجع إلى الفترات التالية: العصر الحجري الأعلى ثم الفترة العاتيرية. هذه المغارة تكتسي أهمية كبيرة حيث تم العثور بها سنة 1975 على بقايا جمجمة إنسان يرجع إلى الفترة العاتيرية. هذه البقايا هي لإنسان عاقل مع وجود بعض الخصائص البدائية بالجمجمة.

الروازي الصخيرات
يقع هذا الموقع على بعد 30 كلم من الرباط وهو عبارة عن مقبرة تم اكتشافها سنة 1980. أسفرت حفريات الاتقاد التي تم القيام بها سنة 1982 على نتائج مهمة تخص العصر الحجري الحديث حيث تم اكتشاف بقايا الإنسان ومجموعة من اللقى الأثرية البالغة الأهمية: أواني خزفية، أواني من العاج وحلي من العاج....الفترة التاريخية التي تنتمي إليها هذه المقبرة هي العصر الحجري الحديث بمراحله الوسطى والحديثة والتي تؤرخ بحوالي 3800ق م.

ثقافة وفنون
تعتبر الرباط عاصمة ثقافية، وهي أيضا مدينة المتاحف، وأهمها متحف محمد السادس للفن الحديث والمعاصر، ومتحف لوداية المقام في مبنى يعود للقرن السابع وتم ترميمه حاليا، يعرض قطعا فنية مختلفة من الخزف والحلي والمجوهرات والملابس التقليدية والمطرزات والسجاد والاسطرلابات وبعض المخطوطات من عصر الموحدين، أما على شاطئ النهر فيقع متحف الفنون الشعبية مقابل مجمع الصناعات التقليدية، حيث يمكن تأمل الحرفيين أثناء عملهم، ويقع متحف التاريخ والحضارات في المدينة الحديثة، ويقدم للزائر نماذج من القطع التي تعود إلى عصر ما قبل التأريخ، وأخرى إلى العصر الإسلامي الوسيط.

الرباط هي أيضًا حاضنة لأهم المسارح وأكبرها في المملكة، حيث تضم المدينة المسرح الكبير للرباط والذي يعد أكبر مسرح في إفريقيا، إذ يمتد على مساحة 7 هكتارات و يتسع لـ 7000 مقعد، ويحتوي على قاعة للعروض تتسع لـ 1900 مقعد، إلى جانب جميع المرافق الضرورية. كما يتواجد بالمدينة مسرح محمد الخامس، وكذا عدة قاعات رسمية للمعارض التشكيلية، منها دار الفنون وقاعة باب الرواح. وفي القطاع المستقل، تعد الشقة 22 من أبرز الفضاءات الفنية وتقدم فنانين مغاربة وعالميين.

الاقتصاد
الرباط هي العاصمة والمركز الحضري الأهم في جهة الرباط سلا القنيطرة والتي تُعتبر ثالث أكبر جهة من الناحية الاقتصادية في المغرب، وفي السنوات الأخيرة بدأت تصبح مركزًا لرجال الأعمال، ولهذا أطلقت المدينة مشاريع طموحة لجذب المستثمرين. 
تتميز المدينة باقتصاد متنوع يعتمد على مزيج من الصناعات المتطورة، التجارة المزدهرة، والخدمات البنكية المتقدمة. تحتضن المدينة صناعات حيوية مثل الصناعات الدوائية وصناعة السيارات التي تجذب الاستثمارات الكبرى. على صعيد التجارة، تشكل الأنشطة التجارية جزءًا هامًا من الاقتصاد المحلي، مع تواجد الأسواق التقليدية إلى جانب المراكز التجارية الحديثة. في القطاع المالي، تلعب البنوك الكبرى دورًا رئيسيًا، من حيث مساهمتها في تمويل المشاريع الصغيرة والمتوسطة، وكذا توفير مناخ مالي مستقر لجذب الاستثمارات. إضافة إلى ذلك، تعتمد المدينة على تجهيزات عصرية تشمل مناطق صناعية ومنصات لوجستية، مستفيدة من قربها من ميناء القنيطرة لتعزيز صادراتها وتطوير علاقاتها التجارية.

البنية التحتية
التعليم
تضم الرباط أفضل الجامعات والمدارس والمعاهد ليس في المغرب فقط بل في الوطن العربي كله والتي درست وأخرجت أهم الشخصيات السياسية والاقتصادية التي أثرت في تاريخ المغرب.
من الأهم الجامعات الموجودة في الرباط نجد جامعة محمد الخامس والتي تعد من أقدم الجامعات الحديثة بالمغرب، كما نجد أيضا الجامعة الدولية للرباط.
يوجد بجانب هذه الجامعات مدارس في تخصصات محددة مثل الطب والفن والهندسة على رأسهم جامعة الزهراوي الدولية لعلوم الصحة، والمدرسة الوطنية للهندسة المعمارية، والمعهد العالي للفن المسرحي والتنشيط الثقافي.

الصحة
مدينة الرباط هي موقع لأهم وأكبر المستشفيات في المغرب لعل أبرزها المركز الاستشفائي الجامعي ابن سينا الذي يعتبر ثاني أكبر مركز استشفائي جامعي في المغرب بعد المستشفى الجامعي بطنجة، ونجد أيضا المستشفى العسكري الدراسي والمستشفى الجامعي الدولي الشيخ خليفة و المستشفى الجامعي الشيخ زايد. بالإضافة إلى هذه المستشفيات نجد مصحات خاصة مثل مركز النخيل للأورام ومصحة أكدال ومصحة العاصمة.

الرياضة
ملعب الأمير مولاي عبد الله هو ملعب كرة قدم افتتح رسميًا في 5 سبتمبر 2025، ويُعدّ من بين أكبر الملاعب في المغرب، حيث يتسع لـ 69,500 متفرج، ويقع على بعد حوالي 7 كيلومترات من وسط المدينة. ويُعتبر الملعب معقلًا لنادي الجيش الملكي وكذلك المنتخب المغربي لكرة القدم.

النقل والمواصلات
القطارات
تخدم مدينة الرباط محطتان رئيسيتان للسكك الحديدية يديرهما المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية. محطة الرباط المدينة ومحطة الرباط أكدال هما المحطتان الرئيسيتان اللتان تربطان الرباط بباقي المدن، حيث تنطلق القطارات جنوباً إلى الدار البيضاء ومراكش والجديدة، شمالاً إلى طنجة، أو شرقاً إلى مكناس وفاس وتازة ووجدة. يوفر المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية خدمة كاملة عبر قطارته ويمكنك الحصول على مواصلات إلى مراكش وهي رحلة تمتد لـ 4 ساعات، فاس 2 ساعة (إذا كنت تأخذ أحد القطارات السريعة الجديدة، و 3 ساعات في القطارات الأخرى) والدار البيضاء ساعة واحدة.

ترامواي الرباط
يعتبر مشروع التراموي الرابط بين المدينتين الرباط وسلا من الحلول الملائمة للمشكل الخاص بالنقل الحضري بهاتين المدينتين حيث يستجيب للطلب المتزايد على النقل ويوفر بديلا حقيقيا لاستعمال السيارات أشرف الملك محمد السادس، على تدشين خطي ترامواي الرباط – سلا، وقنطرة الحسن الثاني وذلك يوم الأربعاء 18 ماي 2011.
يعد هذا المشروع من المشاريع التي تحظى بالأولوية في إطار مشروع تهيئة وتنمية ضفتي أبي رقراق، على اعتبار أنه يروم تسهيل حركة المرور والتنقل وتسهيل الربط بين العدوتين عبر اعتماد وسائل للنقل والمواصلات تحترم البيئة وتضمن شروط السلامة والانتظام في العمل. وتم إنجاز مجموع مكونات هذا المشروع، بعين المكان، من طرف مقاولات مغربية بمساعدة مكاتب للدراسات ومختبرات للمراقبة.
وتتكون الشبكة الحالية للتراموي من خطين اثنين يصل مجموع طولهما إلى 5ر19 كلم، ويتوفران على 31 محطة. وتغطي الشبكة أهم الأقطاب الحضرية التي تشهد كثافة عالية من حيث عدد السكان وتنقلاتهم (الأحياء الجامعية، المستشفيات، الإدارات، مركزا المدينتين، أهم المحطات الطرقية والسككية). ويبلغ العدد الإجمالي للعربات التي سيتم توظيفها في شبكة ترامواي الرباط – سلا، والتي تم تصميمها وفق المعايير الدولية، 44 عربة، يصل طول كل منها إلى 32 متر. وتتوفر العربات على أجهزة التكييف وعلى جميع الولوجيات بالنسبة للأشخاص ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة. وكان قد أعطى انطلاقة أشغال هذا المشروع الملك محمد السادس في 23 دجنبر 2007 حيث أشرفت على إنجازه وكالة تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق بشراكة مع الجماعات المحلية للرباط وسلا. وابتداء من شهر يناير 2009، أصبحت شركة تراموي الرباط سلا التي تضم بين مساهميها جماعتي الرباط وسلا تشرف على سير الأشغال. التراموي الذي شرع في استغلاله خلال هذه السنة، من المرتقب أن يقل حوالي 180 ألف راكب بين الرباط وسلا كل يوم عبر خطين أساسيين: 

الخط المهيكل للتجمع الحضري من حي كريمة بسلا إلى حي أكدال بالرباط على مسافة 7.11 كلم، ويشمل هذا الخط الأقطاب الرئيسية للمدينتين.
خط خاص بسكان الأحياء ذات الكثافة السكانية المرتفعة، مثل حي يعقوب المنصور بالرباط وبطانة بمدينة سلا على مسافة 7.8 كلم.

حافلات النقل الحضري
فوض مرفق النقل الحضري بالمدينة وما جاورها لشركة ألزا وقد وضعت رهن إشارة مستعملي الحافلات حافلات من الطراز الرفيع وذات جودة عالية وايكولوجية، ووضعت أيضا شبكة من الخطوط المنتظمة التي تربط بين احياء العاصمة وايضا ضواحيها كسلا وتمارة والصخيرات وتامسنا وعين عودة...

الطيران
المطار الرئيسي الذي يخدم مدينة الرباط هو مطار الرباط سلا الدولي، يتواجد فعليا في مدينة سلا على بعد 8 كلم من الرباط يبلغ طول المدرج 3500 متر وعرضه 45 متر.
يحتل المطار المرتبة السادسة في المغرب من حيث عدد المسافرين، وتبلغ الطاقة الاستعابية للمطار 1.5 مليون مسافر في السنة. ولكونه يقع بجوار العاصمة الرباط، فهو المطار الرئيسي لإستقبال قادة الدول والبعثات الديبلوماسية الذين يزورون المغرب.

مشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق
يعد مشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق من المشاريع التنموية الكبرى التي ستضفي مساحة من الحداثة والإبداع والتميز على صورة الرباط وسلا وتبرز الخصوصيات التاريخية والتراثية والعمرانية للعاصمة الإدارية للمملكة. وينتظر بعد الانتهاء من هذا المشروع الطموح، وفق تصميم هندسي راق، أن تصبح الرباط نموذجا عالميا لازدهار سياحي واقتصادي وإضفاء جمالية تضيف لتاريخها وتراثها وثقافتها رصيدا غنيا. ويسعى مشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق، إلى تطوير وتنمية المنطقة، وذلك بإعادة تأهيل المآثر التاريخية الموجودة بمحاذاة الوادي وربط هذه المعالم ببعضها بواسطة شبكة منظمة من الطرق والمسالك الاستكشافية.
كما يتوخى هذا المشروع، الذي خصص لإنجاز بنياته التحتية مبلغ عشرة ملايير درهم يمولها صندوق الحسن الثاني للتنمية الاجتماعية الاقتصادية والمديرية العامة للجماعات المحلية، الجمع بين مهارة التصميم الحضري والمعماري وخاصية الأسس التاريخية التي ينبني عليها الموقع من أجل تهيئة عصرية تتلاءم مع الخصائص الذاتية للموقع وبلورة تصميم لمدينة منفتحة يتم التركيز في بناياتها على الواجهات والسطوح المفتوحة على السماء. وأوضح المدير العام لوكالة تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق السيد الصاقل المغاري، في حديث لوكالة المغرب العربي للأنباء، أن مشروع التهيئة ستكون له انعكاسات إيجابية على التنمية المحلية للرباط وسلا، وتحقيق نهضة حضرية ونمو اقتصادي من خلال تشييد واستغلال التجهيزات والبنيات التحتية للمنطقة عبر خلق مناصب شغل، وتحفيز الصناعات المرتبطة بالبناء والتجهيز والقطاعات المالية.

باب البحر
يوجد على بعد عشر دقائق من مطار الرباط سلا، بالضفة اليمنى لنهر أبي رقراق بمدينة الرباط قرب مدينة سلا ويعد هذا المشروع عملا ضخما، يطمح إلى تحويل مصبّ نهر أبي رقراق إلى قطب سياحي وحضري فعلي وبذلك الارتقاء بمدينة الرباط إلى مرتبة العواصم الكبرى بالبحر الأبيض المتوسط.
ويقع «باب البحر» بين مصب نهر أبي رقراق وقنطرة مولاي الحسن ويمتد على مساحة سبعين هكتار تقريبا، ثلاثين منها مساحات عقارية؛ إذ يضم مشروع «باب البحر» برنامجا عقاريا متنوعا بغلاف استثماري يقدر بسبعمائة وخمسين مليون دولار.
وسيأوي المشروع عرضا متنوعا يشمل وحدات سكنية وفندقية ذات جودة عالية، العديد من المؤسسات التجارية ومركزا للأعمال يضم مكاتب ومهنيي قطاع الخدمات. كما سينبض القلب الحضري لهذا القطب على إيقاع متاجر، متاحف وأروقة فنية ممّا يزيد من تنوعه.

قنطرة مولاي الحسن
وهي عبارة عن جسر كبير يتوفر على ثلاثة ممرات، ومسلكين للترامواي الذي سيربط الرباط وسلا وممرات أخرى خاصة بالراجلين والدراجات كما تعمل على تسهيل حركة مرور البواخر إلى المارينات التي سيتم إحداثها في إطار مشروع «أمواج»، فضلا عن تسهيل حركة المرور النهري عبر واد أبي رقراق
ويعد مشروع هذه القنطرة من بين المشاريع التي تندرج في إطار الشطر الأول للمشروع الكبير لتهيئة وتنمية ضفتي أبي رقراق، والذي يعرف باسم «باب البحر» الممتد على نحو سبعين هكتارا سنة 2010

نفق الأوداية
هو مشروع يدخل ي إطار مخطط تهيئة ضفتي نهر أبي رقراق، سيمكن من تجاوز مشكل تدفقات حركة السير بطريق المرسى، الذي يعرف حاليا حركة سير مكثفة تصل في معدلها الأعلى إلى 30 ألف سيارة في اليوم، منها 3500 من الوزن الثقيل.
وسيمتد هذا المشروع، الذي يربط بين «باب البحر» ونادي الرياضات على طول 1022 متر.
ويهدف هذا المشروع، بالخصوص، إلى إعادة التواصل التاريخي بين المدينة القديمة والأوداية، كما سيساعد على الحفاظ على الموقع التاريخي وسيعطيه قيمة سياحية أكبر، فضلا عن جعل حركة السير أكثر سيولة.
وتقدر تكلفة بناء وتجهيز النفق بحوالي 491 مليون درهم، ومن المنتظر أن تنطلق حركة المرور به خلال الستة أشهر الأولى من سنة 2010.

ملاحظة 1 بكسر الراء «رِبَاط»، إذ قال فردينانَ توتلَ في «المُنجد في الأدب والعلوم»: «إنَّ الصواب هو مدينة الرِّبَاط أو رِبَاط الفتح»، وعندما انتقدَ إبراهيمُ القَطّان كتابَ المُنجد هذا، لم يقُل إن كسر الراء في الرِباط خطأٌ. وذكرَ عادل زعيتر في كتابه «حضارة العرب»، وفيليب حِتِّي في كتابه تاريخ العرب (باللغة الإنكليزيَّة) أنَّ اسم المدينة هو الرِّباطُ (بكسر الراء لا فتحِها). ويقول مُعجَم دائرةِ معارفِ كولييرَ الإنكليزيّ أنه يُطلق عليها: الرَّباط أو رَبَاط الفتح أما دائرةُ معارفِ كولييرَ نفسُها فتقول إن اسم المدينة هو الرَّباط، وتقول بين قوسين إنَّ اسمَها العربيَّ هو الرِّبَاط. لكنَّ «محمد العدناني» في «معجم الأغلاط اللغوية المعاصرة» خطَّأَ الدائرة ومُعجمَها ذاكرًا السبب المذكور آنِفًا.

Rabat (en arabe : الرباط, ar-Ribāṭ ; en amazighe : ⵕⵕⴱⴰⵟ, Ṛṛbaṭ ; en arabe marocain : الرّباط, Rbaṭ) est la capitale du royaume du Maroc. La ville est située sur la côte l'Atlantique, au nord-ouest du Maroc, à 40 km au sud de Kénitra, à 240 km au sud-ouest de Tanger et du détroit de Gibraltar et à 87 km au nord-est de Casablanca. Elle est séparée de la ville de Salé par l'embouchure du Bouregreg, ce qui vaut au deux villes le surnom de « villes jumelles ».
Lors du dernier recensement de 2024, sa population était de 977 827 habitants, faisant de Rabat la 7e ville du royaume. Avec sa banlieue, elle forme la deuxième agglomération de ce pays après celle de Casablanca.
Depuis 2012, un ensemble de sites de Rabat est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. La ville a aussi reçu la deuxième place du classement CNN des « Meilleures destinations touristiques de 2013 ». En 2024, la ville de Rabat reçoit à l’unanimité le prix d'honneur à l'occasion du Programme des Nations unies pour les établissements humains (ONU-Habitat) 2024.

Histoire
La ville a été fondée au XIIe siècle par les Almohades, qui y édifièrent une citadelle (devenue la kasbah des Oudayas), une mosquée et une résidence. C’était alors ce qu'on appelle un ribat (« forteresse »). Le nom actuel vient de Ribat Al Fath, « le Camp de la Victoire ». Plus tard, le petit-fils de Abd Al-Mūmin — Ya'qub al-Mansūr — agrandit et compléta la ville, l'entourant notamment de murailles. Par la suite, elle servit de base aux expéditions almohades en Andalousie.
Après 1269, quand les Mérinides choisirent Fès comme capitale, Rabat entra dans une période de déclin. Ainsi, l'explorateur morisque Hassan al-Wazzan a rapporté qu'il n'y subsistait que 100 maisons habitées en 1515. En 1609, à la suite du décret d’expulsion de Philippe III, 13 000 Morisques y trouvèrent refuge, revitalisant ainsi la ville. Jusqu'au XIXe siècle, Rabat est connue sous le nom de Salé-le-Neuf.
En 1912, Lyautey fit de Rabat le siège du résident général et la capitale du protectorat français au Maroc. En 1956, à l’indépendance du Maroc, la ville resta la capitale du pays.

Préhistoire
En 1875, Bleicher signale pour la première fois l'existence d'outils lithiques au Maroc ; est cité entre autres le site Douar Doum à Rabat.
Une carrière d'exploitation dans le quartier de Kébibat a livré en 1933 les plus anciens fossiles humains trouvés au Maroc (à la date de 2004), soit 23 fragments de boîte crânienne, sans industrie lithique associée. Leurs caractéristiques ont induit plusieurs hypothèses successives. Marçais (1934) en fait un Atlanthrope. Vallois (1958/1959) leur attribue un mélange de Néandertalien et de Sinanthrope. Jaranof (1945) les dit moustériens. Ferembach (1975) les attribue à l'Acheuléen moyen. Au début des années 2000, ils sont dits du Tensiftien, contemporain du Riss, l'avant-dernière glaciation. La stratigraphie du site a été interprétée en 1959 par G. Choubert.
Les falaises du littoral océanique entre Rabat et Tébibat sont elles aussi riches en vestiges préhistoriques : Dar-es-Soltane I et II, El Harhoura I et II, grotte des Contrebandiers (appelée de nos jours El Mnasra).

Fondation et développement sous les Almohades
La première trace urbaine à Rabat se situe à l'actuelle kasbah des Oudaïas, les Almoravides y ayant fondé un fort pour organiser les attaques contre les tribus du royaume hérétique des Berghouata non loin des ruines de l'ancienne cité romaine de Sala Colonia. La dynastie des Almohades fit édifier, en 1150, à la place de l'ancien fort sanhadja des Almoravides, un ribat (ou forteresse), lieu de rassemblement des combattants de la foi, point d’étape dans l’épopée almohade pour la conquête de l’Andalousie et le contrôle du reste du Maghreb. Le calife Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur se disait désireux de concevoir, quant à la position du Bouregreg, des projets plus vastes capables d'éclipser les grandes métropoles abbassides de l'Orient islamique.
Aidé des nombreux captifs ramenés d’Espagne après la bataille d'Alarcos, il fit construire les remparts de la future capitale et commencer, non loin du fleuve, une mosquée aux proportions grandioses ; mais cette dernière ne fut pas achevée : seul se dresse son minaret, qui servit de repère aux navigateurs pour le franchissement de la ville. À ce camp retranché fut d'abord appliqué le nom de « Ribat de Salé », puis celui de « Ribat El-Fath » ('le Camp de la Victoire'), après la victoire des armées almohades en Espagne.
Cette construction, qui correspond en gros à la partie ouest de l’actuelle kasbah des Oudaïas, fut aussi appelée « al-Mahdiyya », en souvenir d’al-Mahdî Muhammad ibn Tûmart, fondateur du mouvement almohade. À partir du Ribat d’Abd al-Mumin, son[Qui ?] fils Abu Yaqub Yusuf, puis son petit-fils Yacoub el-Mansour, héritiers d’un empire s'étendant de la Castille à la Tripolitaine, à cheval sur l'Europe et l'Afrique, ont construit une cité imposante, couvrant plus de quatre cents hectares, enceinte de murailles imposantes percées de portes monumentales et qui devait être dotée d'une mosquée gigantesque, la tour Hassan (restée inachevée, et puis détruite durant le séisme de 1755), mais qui eut été l'un des plus grands sanctuaires du monde musulman.
Ainsi, bien que Ribat al Fath ne reçût jamais la population que son enceinte aurait pu abriter, les grandes orientations de la ville étaient tracées. Les remparts, les portes monumentales de l’époque, le minaret et les vestiges de la mosquée de Hassan témoignent aujourd'hui encore de l’ampleur de la ville almohade, sur un site dont le caractère sacré a été accentué et revalorisé par l'édification du mausolée Mohammed V, symbole de piété filiale qui, de par sa décoration exceptionnelle, œuvre d'art collective, est un hommage au souverain qui y repose et un témoignage de la renaissance de l'artisanat traditionnel[évasif].

Phase de déclin
De la fin de la période almohade, vers le milieu du XIIIe siècle, jusqu'au début du XVIIe siècle, l’importance de Rabat diminua considérablement.
La dynastie zénète des Mérinides fonda le Jama' el-Kbîr, ainsi que d'autres ruelles, toutes situées au cœur de l'actuelle médina. La localisation de cet équipement public permet d’affirmer que la vie citadine n’était pas concentrée uniquement aux abords immédiats de la kasbah et que plusieurs quartiers de l'actuelle médina étaient habités.

République du Bouregreg
À partir de 1610, Rabat reçut une forte population de réfugiés morisques chassés de l'ancienne Al-Andalus par le roi d'Espagne Philippe III. Les réfugiés s’établirent dans la kasbah et à l'intérieur de l'enceinte almohade, dans la partie nord-ouest qu'ils délimitèrent et protégèrent par une nouvelle enceinte, la muraille andalouse. Les descendants de ces Morisques, qui portent souvent des patronymes hispaniques tels que Dinia (Dénia, ville en Espagne dans la commune autonome de Valence), Guédira, Mouline (Molina), Bargach (Vargas), Karrakchou (Carracso/Carrasco), Moreno, Balafrej (Palafres), Ronda ou Tamourro (Chamorro) sont toujours considérés comme les Rabatis dits « de souche ».
Pendant quelques dizaines d’années, Rabat, alors connue en Europe sous le nom de Salé-le-Neuf, fut le siège d'une cité-État, la république du Bouregreg, jusqu’à l’avènement des Alaouites, qui s’emparèrent de l’estuaire en 1666. Sa principale activité était la course en mer contre les chrétiens, notamment contre les Espagnols, qui lui procurait la totalité de ses ressources. La république salétine devint ainsi un des principaux centres de la course barbaresque en Afrique du Nord, en concurrence avec les Ottomans qui dominaient Alger, Tunis et Tripoli. Les corsaires de Salé-le-Neuf s'aventuraient très loin dans l'océan Atlantique, parfois jusqu'en Islande et jusqu'à Terre-Neuve, au large de l'actuel Canada.

Rabat sous les Alaouites
Rabat devient une ville impériale dans la seconde moitié du XVIIIe siècle, sous le règne du sultan Mohammed III (1757-1790), qui y fait édifier un palais et une mosquée. Un de ses successeurs, Moulay Slimane (1792-1822), vient y résider durant les grandes révoltes siba qui frappent le Moyen-Atlas et menacent Fès, et y fait également construire une mosquée. Sa décision d'arrêter la course barbaresque entraîne le déclin de l'activité maritime de la ville.
Une publication de 1901 rappelle l'existence à Rabat du quartier juif, appelé au Maroc « mellah », reconstruit vers 1811, où se trouvent de nombreux marchands juifs et seize synagogues au début du XXe siècle.

Protectorat français
En 1912, dans le cadre de l'instauration du protectorat français au Maroc, le général Lyautey décide de transférer la capitale de Fès à Rabat (en raison de la forte agitation des tribus autour de Fès). Le sultan Moulay Youssef y déménage quelques mois plus tard. En 1913, Lyautey fait appel à Jean Claude Forestier, qui rédige un rapport sur l'aménagement urbain des grandes villes marocaines, puis il engage Henri Prost en 1914 pour dessiner la « Ville nouvelle » destinée à abriter les institutions du protectorat et la population européenne.

Après l'indépendance
En 1956, à la fin du protectorat, le sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef (Mohammed V) maintient Rabat comme capitale. Son fils Hassan II, en 1961, et son petit-fils Mohammed VI en 1999, confirment ce choix, tout en alternant les séjours dans les différents palais du royaume, selon la tradition des souverains chérifiens.
De la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et jusqu'en 1963, les États-Unis disposèrent d'une base militaire aérienne à Rabat.

Culture et patrimoine
Patrimoine mondial
Depuis juin 2012, un ensemble de sites de la ville de Rabat est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco en tant que bien culturel : la « ville nouvelle » (édifiée au début du protectorat), la kasbah des Oudayas, le jardin d'Essais, la médina, les remparts et portes almohades, les sites du Chellah ou de la mosquée Hassan (dont la « tour Hassan » est le minaret), le mausolée Mohammed-V et le quartier habous de Diour Jamaâ.

Enceintes et fortifications
Protégeant les faces sud et ouest de la ville, une enceinte importante fut construite par les Almohades à la fin du XIIe siècle. Elle est composée de deux longues murailles rectilignes, se coupant à angle aigu, d’une longueur totale de plus de cinq kilomètres, d’une épaisseur de plus de deux mètres et d’une hauteur moyenne d'environ huit mètres.
Ainsi fut enfermée une superficie de près de quatre cent-vingt hectares, englobant le plateau supérieur qui domine aujourd’hui le Chella, pour assurer, en cas d’attaque, la sécurité des parties basses de la ville. Le rempart ouest était percé de quatre portes, à intervalles assez réguliers : Bab El-Alou, Bab El-Had, Bab Er-Rouah et Bab El-Hdid, la dernière étant incluse dans l’actuel Palais royal. Le rempart sud n'en comportait qu’une seule, Bab Zaër. Comme la plupart des murailles édifiées par les Almohades, cette enceinte construite en béton d'une grande solidité, riche en chaux grasse, a admirablement résisté. Régulièrement flanquée de tours carrées, sa courtine est couronnée d'un chemin de ronde, bordé à l’extérieur d’un parapet aux merlons coiffés de pyramidions.
Bab Er-Rouah, chef-d’œuvre d’esthétique monumentale en pierre, déploie, tout comme la porte de la Kasbah, un décor d’entrelacs autour de l’ouverture en forme d’arc outrepassé inscrit dans un encadrement rectangulaire. Comme à Bab Agnaou à Marrakech, de grands arcs reprennent, en l’élargissant, le mouvement de l’arc même de la porte, l’entourant d’une auréole sinueuse aux pointes aiguës, surmontée d’une large frise à inscription coufique.
Au début du XVIIe siècle, des réfugiés musulmans chassés d’Espagne s’installent dans la Kasbah ainsi que dans une partie d’une centaine d’hectares à l’intérieur de l’enceinte almohade, qu’ils délimitent par l’édification d’une nouvelle muraille. Partant à proximité de Bab El-Had, cette dernière relie la courtine du XIIe siècle à la falaise dominant le Bouregreg, au Borj Sidi Makhlouf. Rectiligne et flanquée de tours barlongues, la muraille andalouse qui s’étendait sur plus de 1 400 mètres, était haute en moyenne de cinq mètres et large de plus d’1,5 mètre. Elle était percée de trois portes : Bab Et-Tben (aujourd'hui abattue, cette porte était située près de l’actuel marché municipal), Bab El-Bouiba et Bab-Chella.
Par ailleurs, au début du XIXe siècle, un nouveau rempart extérieur, d’une longueur totale de 4 300 mètres, fut édifié. Il prolongeait au sud l'enceinte almohade et la doublait à l’ouest jusqu'à l'océan Atlantique, enfermant ainsi une superficie totale de plus de 840 hectares. Cette dernière fortification avait une hauteur moyenne de 4 mètres et une épaisseur légèrement inférieure à 1 mètre. Quatre portes au total y étaient percées : Bab El-Qebibât, Bab Tamesna, Bab Marrakech et Bab El-Msalla. Ce rempart alaouite a été détruit en grande partie pour faciliter l’aménagement de la ville européenne durant le protectorat. À partir des principales portes de la médina partaient les routes reliant, notamment, Rabat à Casablanca, à Marrakech, et à Fès.
Aux abords de l'enceinte almohade se tenaient des marchés hebdomadaires, tel celui de Souq el-Had, à proximité de la porte du même nom. Par ailleurs, entre l'enceinte alaouite et la muraille almohade étaient situés, au sud, l'Agdal, relié au Palais royal et, au nord, des jardins d'orangers dont les fruits, très prisés pour leur qualité, étaient exportés en Europe, comme l'attestent de nombreux documents d'archives.

Liste de monuments
La kasbah des Oudayas : ribat surplombant l'embouchure de l'oued Bou Regreg où se trouve le musée des Oudayas. Le ribat conçu à l'origine est devenu l'abri du musée national des Bijoux.
La tour Hassan : ruines de la mosquée bâtie par Ya'qub al-Mansūr, détruite au moment du séisme de 1755 à Lisbonne et le mausolée de Mohammed V, où reposent le défunt roi Mohammed V et ses deux fils, le défunt roi Hassan II et son frère cadet Moulay Abdellah.
La nécropole de Chella : bâtie en 1339, Chella était une ancienne agglomération phénicienne, carthaginoise et romaine.
La section monumentale de l'avenue Mohammed V et la mosquée Sunna : l'avenue Mohammed V prend naissance au pied de la mosquée Sunna pour se terminer au boulevard El Alou, après un cheminement de plusieurs kilomètres à travers la ville, en passant par le Parlement, la Banque d'État du Maroc et plusieurs immeubles coloniaux.
Palais royal (Dâr-al-Makhzen) : le palais royal et le siège du gouvernement où travaillent et résident plus de 2 000 personnes. On accède au palais par une vaste esplanade, le « Méchouar ».
Bab ar-Rouah et l'avenue des Forces armées royales (FAR) : la plus célèbre des portes monumentales de Rabat veut dire, selon les uns « porte des vents », selon d'autres « porte du retour ». De l'époque Almohade, comme Bab Oudaïa, elle surprend par la richesse de sa décoration. Il s'agissait de la seule porte d'accès à Rabat, par voie terrestre.
L'ancienne médina : bordée au nord par le Bouregreg, protégée de l'océan à l'ouest par les murs d'enceintes de la Kasbah des Oudayas, elle est ceinturée à l'est par les murailles almohades et au sud par le mur des Andalous qui sépare la ville nouvelle de la ville ancienne.
Bab El Had : construite à la fin du XIIe siècle par Yaacoub El Mansour. Il s'agit de l'une des portes qui forment la muraille des Almohades. « El Had » veut dire en arabe « le fil de l'épée » (Had Essayf). Elle a été nommée ainsi car c'était devant cette porte qu'on exécutait les meurtriers devant la foule à l'aide d'un sabre. Ces exécutions se tenaient en public pour faire comprendre aux entrants à la ville que les meurtres n'y étaient pas tolérés.

Lieux de culte
Parmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées. Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Archidiocèse de Rabat (Église catholique), Église évangélique au Maroc (Communion mondiale d'Églises réformées), Église orthodoxe russe de Rabat.

Culture
La médina : construite au XVIIe siècle pour accueillir les réfugiés d'Andalousie, elle est aujourd'hui connue pour son mellah (ancien quartier juif), son souk couvert Es-Sebat dans la rue des Consuls, deux zawiya Tijani connues dans le monde entier pour être liées à Sidi Larbi Ben Sayeh, et toutes autres sortes de boutiques diversifiées.
Le parc Ibn-Sina : appelé communément « parc Hilton » en raison de sa proximité avec l'hôtel situé juste à côté, désormais Sofitel. Le parc est aussi le poumon vert de l'agglomération avec des plantations de pins et d'eucalyptus.
Le jardin d'Essais : situé au milieu de la ville et divisé en deux par l'avenue de la Victoire.
La ceinture verte de Rabat : c'est une forêt protégée séparant Rabat de Témara.
Le golf et le palais Dar es-Salam : golf de 45 trous qui abrite chaque année le prestigieux trophée international de golf Hassan-II.
La Villa des arts : petit établissement abritant des expositions, et nombre d'activités pour étudiants.

Le Musée de l'histoire et des civilisations, ouvert depuis 2017.

Institutions et espaces culturels
Le théâtre national Mohammed-V est l’une des plus grandes institutions culturelles de Rabat. La majeure partie des spectacles y sont coorganisés avec les instituts culturels européens.
Les galeries officielles sont Bâb Er-Rouah, Bab El-Kébir aux Oudayas et Mohamed El-Fassi.
Rabat compte aussi des espaces indépendants, le plus emblématique étant L'appartement 22, fondé en 2002 par Abdellah Karroum, pour la production, l'exposition et les rencontres des cultures vivantes.
Des grands projets culturels sont lancés dans les années 2000, notamment celui de la Bibliothèque nationale, du musée des Arts contemporains et de l’Institut supérieur de la musique et de la danse.
En 2006, la Fondation ONA inaugure à Rabat son second lieu culturel, la Villa des arts.

Géographie
Localisation
Rabat se situe au cœur de la vallée du Bouregreg.
Les préfectures limitrophes sont les préfectures de Salé, de Skhirate-Témara et de Khemisset.

Climat
Le climat de la ville est un climat de type méditerranéen, sujet aux quatre saisons bien marquées. Les hivers sont frais et pluvieux, avec des minima nocturnes pouvant descendre en dessous de 5 °C, ou parfois atteindre les 0 °C, et des journées agréables autour de 17 °C. Les gelées sont relativement rares. Les étés sont modérément chauds, la température dépassant rarement 30 °C. Par contre, les nuits sont toujours fraîches et l'humidité de l'air océanique se fait nettement ressentir.
Principalement au printemps et en été, s'invite parfois le chergui, vent du désert sec et brûlant qui soufle de l'est et fait brusquement monter la température, de temps à autre au-dessus de 30 °C mais rarement pendant plus de trois journées successives, avant un retour de la brise océanique d'ouest.
La ville appartient au domaine bioclimatique sub-humide, et la moyenne annuelle de précipitation est de 555 mm.
La durée annuelle d'ensoleillement est 2 916 heures. La moyenne annuelle de précipitation s’élève à 76 jours, concentrés entre octobre et avril. Les chutes de neige sont rares.
Le record absolu de chaleur est de 45,8 °C (enregistré en août 2010), tandis que le record absolu de froid est de −3,2 °C (enregistré en janvier 2005). La moyenne annuelle de température dans la ville est 17 °C.
Le climat de Rabat ressemble beaucoup à celui du sud-ouest de la péninsule Ibérique.

Administration et politique
Organisation administrative
Sur le plan administratif, la ville de Rabat — à distinguer de l’agglomération rabataise, qui inclue sa banlieue — correspond à la préfecture de Rabat. Son territoire s’étend sur une superficie de 118,5 km2. Depuis le retour au principe de l'unité de la ville en 2002, il englobe, d'une part, la commune urbaine de Rabat, elle-même divisée en cinq arrondissements, et, d'autre part, la commune urbaine de Touarga. Ainsi, le quartier de Touarga, qui est enclavé dans la commune de rabat et où se situe le palais royal, dispose d'un statut particulier.

Quartiers
Arrondissement Hassan
L'arrondissement de Hassan est constitué d'une multitude de quartiers. Ce sont les quartiers les plus anciens de la ville.
La Kasbah des Oudayas, ancienne forteresse devant protéger des invasions maritimes venue de l'Océan Atlantique, constitue l’un de ces quartiers. Elle prend son nom de la tribu des Oudayas, venue en tant que garde royale à Rabat. Ce quartier a changé plusieurs fois de fonction jusqu'à devenir un quartier résidentiel pendant le XIXe siècle.
Autre quartier, la médina est le cœur historique de la ville. « Médina » signifiant simplement 'ville' en arabe, le quartier est appelé « mdina kdima » par les habitants : 'la vieille ville'. La médina a pris son importance après l'arrivée des Andalous venus en masse pendant l'inquisition espagnol. Elle est elle-même divisée en plusieurs quartiers tels que Boukroun, El Gza, Oukassa, etc. 
Le mellah est le quartier juif de la médina. Il a été fondé en 1808 par le même ingénieur qui a fondé le mellah de Salé. Il ne reste plus qu'une dizaine de familles juives à Rabat depuis que la majorité des habitants juifs historiques a quitté le Maroc[Quand ?].
Le quartier de Hassan (ancien quartier de la Tour Hassan) est le premier quartier européen de Rabat situé à l'intérieur de la muraille almohade rester vide jusqu'au protectorat français, le quartier reste aujourd'hui très vivant et surtout au niveau de l'Avenue Mohammed V qui regroupe la plupart des bâtiment officiel comme la Gare Rabat Ville et l'ancien siège de Bank Al-Maghrib.[incompréhensible] En hauteur se trouve le quartier de la Résidence, qui tient son nom de l'ancienne Résidence générale, devenue le Ministère de l'intérieur. Ce quartier abrite un grand nombre de ministères. À coté, on trouve le quartier des Touargas, situé à l’intérieur de la muraille alaouites. C’est là que se trouve le palais royal.
Du côté atlantique se trouve le quartier de l'Océan. Initialement une extension du quartier de Saniya Gharbiya, ce quartier a accueilli les maisons de familles rabaties de souche plus ou moins aisées. C’est un quartier multiculturel, qui a abrité[Quand ?] des communautés marocaine, française, espagnole et portugaise. Le quartier de l'Océan a été pendant très longtemps un pôle de la vie culturelle de la ville.
Marassa est le premier quartier extra-muros édifié par des familles rabaties bourgeoises. Il s’étend sur une zone comprise entre Bab El Had et l'ancien cimetière juif. De grandes figures politiques marocaines ont vécus dans ce quartier caractérisé par ses maisons traditionnelles qui rappellent la médina.
Le quartier Diour Jamaa a accueilli[Quand ?] une population de la classe moyenne. Il a été conçu dès 1917 par l’administration coloniale en partenariat avec l’administration des habous[Quoi ?] pour dépeupler la médina, qui accueillait l'exode rural depuis le nouveau statut de Rabat en tant que capitale.
Les quartiers de Qbibat et d’Akkari sont des extentions de Diour Jamaa. Qbibat a d'abord accueilli[Quand ?] des européens de milieux défavorisées avant d'être habité[Quand ?] par des marocains. Le nom de « Qbibat » provient de « Bab Qbibat », qui tient son nom de « Kasr Qbibat » (Kasr Al Bahr, l’actuel Four Seasons Hotel). Le quartier accueille l'église orthodoxe russe. Le quartier d’Akkari a été fondé[Quand ?] par la famille éponyme. Il accueille les cimetières chrétien (PAX) et juif, ainsi que des logements traditionnels.

Économie
Rabat est la deuxième agglomération du pays après Casablanca. Ces dernières années, Rabat a commencé à devenir un centre d'affaires, profitant de la restructuration et de la réorganisation des administrations publiques ainsi que l'installation de sociétés étrangères et la création de zones off-shores.
La ville est le siège de plusieurs grandes entreprises marocaines et de multinationales présentes au Maroc telles que Thales, Holcim, KPMG, Maroc Telecom, la Caisse de dépôt et de gestion, le Crédit agricole du Maroc et Poste Maroc.

Les projets d'aménagement de Rabat
La ville de Rabat, à l'image du reste du Maroc, compte aujourd'hui de nombreux projets d'aménagements ambitieux[évasif], démarrés ou en gestation. Ces projets doivent permettre de répondre aux besoins d'une population en forte croissance (la conurbation de Rabat incluant les villes de Salé, Skhirat et Temara, compte désormais plus de 3 millions d'habitants). Il s'agit également de créer des infrastructures de transport, aujourd'hui peu développées et incapables de faire face aux déplacements quotidiens des habitants dans le cadre de leur activité professionnelle. Rabat ambitionne également de devenir une véritable capitale culturelle du pays, ce qui se traduit par la multiplication de projets comme la grande bibliothèque, le futur grand théâtre national au bord du Bouregreg, le musée de l'histoire et des civilisations (ex-musée archéologique), le musée d'art contemporain, et l'organisation de plusieurs Festivals au cours de l'année comme le Festival Mawazine.

Les projets d'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg
L'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg séparant les villes de Rabat et Salé est un projet majeur pour le Maroc. Lancé en 2006, il doit concerner à terme 6 000 hectares. L'objectif du projet est de construire, dans cette zone en partie inondable et faiblement ou pas aménagée, des nouveaux quartiers multifonctionnels assurant la transition entre les deux agglomérations en valorisant le potentiel de l'axe fluvial avec la nouvelle marina et le patrimoine architectural des deux villes. Le projet doit également permettre d'améliorer la communication entre les deux villes. Il est piloté par un établissement public créé pour la circonstance, l’Agence pour l'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg (AAVB).
Six phases sont prévues dont deux ont commencé en 2009. La première, dénommée Bab Al Bahr, représente un montant d’investissement de 750 millions de dollars et comprend un programme immobilier mixte de près de 560 000 m2 de plancher, sur trente hectares. Pour la réalisation de cette première séquence, qui vise à créer une cité de culture, de tourisme et de loisirs, l'agence s'est jointe à Al Maabar d'Abou Dhabi. Les aménagements situés sur la rive gauche de l'oued entre son embouchure et le pont Hassan II comprennent des ensembles hôteliers et résidentiels de qualité, la Cité des arts et métiers destinée à la préservation du savoir-faire artisanal et un port de plaisance. La construction d'un pont doté d'un tirant d'air plus élevé[Quoi ?] et le dragage de l'oued doivent permettre d'accueillir des bateaux ayant des tirants d'eau plus importants. Pour les pêcheurs professionnels de Salé et Rabat chassés par les aménagements en cours, un port de pêche est en cours de construction à l'embouchure de l'oued, côté Rabat.

Les autres projets d'aménagement immobiliers de Rabat
Sephira
Le projet Sephira porte sur l'aménagement de la corniche du littoral atlantique sur une longueur de 11 km et une superficie de 330 ha entre Bab El Bahr (près des Oudaîas) et Harhoura (Témara). Le projet prévoit à terme la réalisation entre autres de résidences, d'hôtels, de tours d'affaires, dont une de 50 étages, d'un centre commercial et d'une marina internationale. Le projet est confié à un groupe des Émirats : le terrain est cédé pour un dirham symbolique en échange de la construction des infrastructures. Le démarrage du programme, toujours en suspens[Quand ?], a été reporté plusieurs fois.

Akrach
Le projet Akrach est une extension de la ville de Rabat qui doit permettre de loger 200 000 habitants sur le plateau du même nom, situé au sud de l'agglomération. Le projet à l'étude depuis quelques années est toujours en suspens (2009).

Centre multifonctionnel d’Agdal
Le projet de CGI[Quoi ?] (centre multifonctionnel d'Agdal) devrait comporter un centre commercial, un hôtel, un fitness club et des bureaux. Arribat Center[incompréhensible]

Tamesna
Une ville nouvelle, baptisée Tamesna et considérée comme une ville-satellite de Rabat, est en cours de construction à 30 km au sud-est de Rabat, sur un terrain situé en amont de l’oued Ikem. Elle a vocation à accueillir à son achèvement vers 2015 250 000 habitants dans 50 000 logements dont 10 000 logements sociaux.

Ryad al Andalous
Sur l'emplacement de l'ancien zoo de Rabat, qui est situé entre les quartiers Hay Riad et Témara, va naître un projet touristique et immobilier (Ryad al Andalous) avec allée de gratte-ciels et d'autres tours ainsi que des logements, loisirs, mall... Un nouveau zoo national est construit juste à côté du complexe sportif Moulay Abdellah en utilisant la recette de la vente du terrain de l'ancien zoo au promoteur (420 MDH[Quoi ?]). Les travaux de construction ont débuté en juillet 2008 et se sont achevés en décembre 2011, pour l'inauguration officielle le 9 janvier 2012 et l'ouverture au public le 14 janvier 2012.

Transports
Le réseau de transports en commun de Rabat est constitué de bus, gérés par la société Alsa depuis août 2019, et de tramways, exploités par le groupe Transdev via la Société du Tramway de Rabat-Salé. Le prix des parkings, très élevé, ainsi que la difficulté de trouver une place de stationnement et les bouchons découragent l’usage de la voiture.[évasif] Une ligne ferroviaire électrifiée à double voie relie Rabat aux villes voisines de Salé et de Casablanca et au reste du Maroc ; elle est empruntée pour les trajets à courte distance par le RER[Quoi ?] en direction de Témara, Bouqnadel et Salé, tandis que la majorité des habitants faisant la navette entre Casablanca, Rabat et Kénitra empruntent le train navette rapide (TNR) sous forme de voitures M6 (Wagon à double étage) qui assure une desserte en une heure avec une fréquence à la demi-heure. Rabat comporte deux gares : Rabat-Ville dans l'arrondissement Hassan et Rabat-Agdal dans la continuité de l'hypercentre, l'Agdal. Les personnes habitant en lointaine banlieue utilisent généralement leur véhicule personnel pour rejoindre le réseau urbain.
Rabat partage avec Salé l'aéroport de Rabat-Salé, d'une capacité de 3,5 millions de passagers, dont le trafic a atteint 485 000 passagers en 2013.

Transports routiers
Pont Hassan-II et tunnel des Oudayas
Pour décongestionner le trafic sur l'axe reliant Salé à Rabat, un nouveau pont doté de deux fois trois voies a remplacé l'ancien pont Moulay-al-Hassan : le pont Hassan II. Ce nouveau pont est doté de deux fois trois voies, contre 2 × 2 voies pour l’ancien. Il permet ainsi un trafic fluide sur la traversée du fleuve.[évasif] De plus, deux lignes de tramway y traversent le fleuve du Bouregreg, permettant non seulement d'assurer le transport des Rabattais et des Salétins mais aussi de réduire le nombre de bus traversant le pont — principale source de bouchons.
Le tunnel des Oudayas permet aujourd'hui de réduire la congestion automobile dans l'axe allant du pont Hassan II jusqu'à l'océan en passant par un important site touristique de Rabat, la Kasbah des Oudayas. De plus, celui-ci va permettre, grâce à la déviation du trafic de l'avenue Al Marsa vers le tunnel, la concrétisation du projet de zone piétonne entre les Oudayas et la médina de Rabat, qui était autrefois une avenue très chargée.

L'autoroute de contournement
L'autoroute de contournement de Rabat, d'une longueur de 42 km, a été inaugurée le 7 juillet 2016. Elle comprend notamment le plus long pont à haubans d'Afrique, le pont Mohammed VI
Cette grande rocade, dont les travaux de réalisation ont été lancés en février 2011 et achevés en juillet 2016, relie les grands axes autoroutiers desservant le sud, le centre, le nord et l’est du Maroc. Elle permettra de réduire les délais de transport tout en allégeant la circulation à l'intérieur du périmètre urbain de Rabat.

Transports urbains
Tramway
La ville de Rabat dispose depuis mai 2011 de deux lignes de tramway, d'une longueur totale de 22 km. Les lignes desservent à la fois Salé et Rabat selon un axe nord-sud avec un tronc commun de 3 km du centre-ville de Rabat jusqu'à l'entrée de Salé, après le franchissement du Bouregreg via le pont Hassan-II. Les 41 stations sont desservies par des rames doubles Citadis d'une longueur totale de 60 mètres.

Réseau de bus
L'agglomération dispose d'un réseau de bus, réaménagé depuis août 2019, et exploité par un groupement composé des entreprises Alsa et City Bus Transport. Le réseau est composé d'une quarantaine de lignes reliant les villes de Rabat, Salé et Témara.
Les bus sont de types Scania Higer et Mercedes-benz Conecto (de 12 m et articulés de 18 m).
Le nombre de véhicules dépasse 350 bus et l’entreprise souhaite renforcer la flotte pour atteindre 500 bus à terme.
Le réseau a été restructuré après 9 ans de crise du transport urbain dans l'agglomération du fait d'une mauvaise gestion, d'abord par Staréo, une filiale de Véolia, puis directement par le groupement public Al Assima regroupant les villes de Rabat, Salé et Témara.
Le prix d’un ticket comprenant un voyage est fixé à 5 dirhams. Il existe un ticket Tram-Bus, qui permet l’intermodalité entre les deux moyens de transport et valable pour deux voyages, le premier dans le bus et le deuxième dans le tram, voir maximum trois avec correspondance sur la deuxième ligne du tramway. Ce ticket intermodal n'est pour le moment n’est valable que sur la ligne 30 du bus.
Il existe aussi une navette vers l’aéroport, reliant la gare de Rabat-Agdal à l'aéroport de Rabat-Salé au tarif de 25 dirhams.

Trains
La ville de Rabat dispose de deux gares, à savoir : 

la Gare de Rabat-Agdal. Depuis sa construction en 1925, le nombre de voyageurs empruntant cette gare n’a cessé d’augmenter. La gare a été rénovée une première fois en 2004, et elle a connu un important réaménagement en 2018 pour devenir la plus grande gare ferroviaire d’Afrique et pour accueillir le train à grande vitesse marocain Al Boraq ;
la Gare de Rabat-Ville, qui a été rénovée de 2008 à 2010. Elle est en cours[Quand ?] de réaménagement, pour être transformée en musée.
Ces deux gares sont desservies par les trains Al Atlas, pour les connecter à plusieurs villes importantes du royaume comme Tanger, Marrakech, Fès, ou encore Casablanca. Elles sont aussi desservies par le Train Navette Rapide qui les connecte à deux pôles industriels, Casablanca (via la gare de Casa-Port) et Kénitra, en plus de petites villes comme Témara, Skhirat et Bouznika.
La gare de Rabat-Agdal est également desservie par Al Boraq, le train à grande vitesse (TGV) qui relie Tanger à Casablanca en passant par Rabat et Kénitra.
Une gare TGV est prévue en périphérie, près de Technopolis, et une gare RER[Quoi ?] est en projet en banlieue, à Tamesna, pour faciliter le déplacement depuis cette zone densément peuplée dont la plupart des habitants sont des employés.

Population et société
Démographie
En 2014, selon la dernière étude du HCP[Qui ?], la ville de Rabat compte 577 827 habitants.
La croissance de la population a été stimulée tout au long du XXe siècle par la croissance démographique du Maroc et la migration vers les villes. Le choix de Rabat comme capitale politique et administrative en 1912 a entraîné l'arrivée d'une population importante de fonctionnaires. Jusqu'à l'indépendance, c'est Rabat qui a reçu la majorité du flux migratoire. Après l'indépendance, la croissance s'est accentuée avec l'installation de l'élite intellectuelle dans la capitale. Désormais, la population de Rabat ne croît plus et ce sont Salé et Témara qui reçoivent les nouveaux flux migratoires.

Langues
Le recensement de 2014 indique que l'arabe est utilisé par 98,4 % de la population de Rabat, tandis que le berbère est parlé sous ses différentes formes par 12,2 %.
Plusieurs formes de la langue arabe coexistent à Rabat. Le rbati, forme la plus anciennement présente dans la ville et fortement minoritaire, se différencie de la koinè urbaine et des parlers hilaliens résultants des mouvements d'exode rural et de la mobilité des populations au sein du Maroc, qui se sont implantés dans la ville principalement pendant la seconde moitié du XXe siècle. D'autres formes de parlers non-hilaliens sont également présentes au sein des populations s'étant établies à Rabat depuis des villes (Salé, Fès, Tétouan, etc.) ou régions (Jbala, Ghomara, etc.) ayant un parler non-hilalien.

Les « anciennes familles » de Rabat
Les « anciennes familles » de Rabat sont un groupe social à identité propre constitué d'un ensemble des familles ayant habité la ville depuis plusieurs siècles, avant son ouverture aux populations de l'intérieur du Maroc et l'arrivée massive de migrants lié à l'exode rural qui commença au début du XXe siècle.
Elles se caractérisent par leur homogénéité sociale et culturelle, qui résulte d'une histoire commune marquée par une isolation du reste du pays pendant près de trois siècles, ainsi que d'un héritage culturel marqué par la culture arabo-andalouse.
Lesdites familles, qui sont environ quatre cents, sont considérées, jusqu'à nos jours, comme les « familles rbaties de souche ». Elles conservent une certaine influence sur la vie politique et économique de la cité.

Enseignement supérieur et recherche
Rabat est, avec Casablanca, la ville dans laquelle se concentre la majorité des établissements d'enseignement supérieur marocains, malgré les tentatives récentes de décentralisation de l'enseignement supérieur[Quoi ?]. L'université Mohammed V, première université fondée après l'indépendance (1957), a été scindée en 1992 en deux universités : l'université Mohammed V - Agdal et l'université Mohammed V - Souissi. En septembre 2014, ces deux universités ont fusionné pour redonner naissance à l'université Mohammed V de Rabat.
L'université comprend les deux premiers établissements d'enseignement supérieur du Maroc : la Faculté des lettres et des sciences humaines, fondée en 1917 sous le nom d’Institut des hautes études marocaines, l'Institut scientifique fondé en 1920 sous le nom d’Institut scientifique chérifien, la plus ancienne école d'ingénieurs du Maroc et d'Afrique : l'École Mohammadia d'ingénieurs, fondée en 1959 et située à l'Agdal.[pas clair]
L'université Mohammed V accueille 87 000 étudiants (chiffres 2019-2020), dont environ 6 500 en 3e cycle. Les filières de formation comprennent le droit, l'économie, la santé, les sciences humaines et sociales, les sciences de l'éducation et l'ingénierie informatique.
De nombreux autres établissements d'enseignement supérieur publics sont installés à Rabat, tels l'institut supérieur de l'information et de la communication (ISIC), l'école nationale d'architecture (ENA), l'institut national des postes et télécommunications (INPT), l'institut agronomique et vétérinaire Hassan II (IAV), l'école nationale d'industrie minérale (ENAM), l'institut national de statistique et d'économie appliquée (INSEA), l'académie marocaine des études diplomatiques et l'université internationale de Rabat (UIR).
À côté, existent également des établissements privés comme l'école supérieure de management, d'informatique et de télécommunication (ESMIT), l'institut supérieur du génie appliqué (IGA), l'école marocaine des sciences de l'ingénieur (EMSI), l'institut des hautes études de management (HEM), l'école supérieure des sciences et technologies de l’ingénierie (ESSTI) et la SIST British University. Dans le domaine des sciences humaines, l'institut universitaire pour la recherche scientifique a été dirigé par Abdelkébir Khatibi.

## Overview
Rabat (Arabic: الرباط; Berber: ⵕⵕⴱⴰⴹ), literally "Fortified Place", is the capital city of Morocco. The city of Rabat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## Understand
Rabat is on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg. On the facing shore of the river lies Salé, Rabat's bedroom community. Together with Temara the cities account for a combined metropolitan population of 2.6 million. It is an easy-going city by Moroccan standards.
Rabat visitor information

## By train
There are two stations 34.016-6.83671 Rabat Ville in downtown and 34.0021-6.85562 Rabat Agdal 3 km south of it. There are a tram and a taxi station next to Rabat Ville train station.  Visit OCNF website[dead link] for the timetable. (However, people had reported that the website is not accessible outside Morocco)
Rabat is well served by train and you can get frequent connections to most places:
Marrakesh is a pleasant 4 hr journey
Fez 2½ hr, 115 dirham 2nd class (May 25)
Casablanca 1 hr, 45 dirham 2nd class (May 25)
Tangier 1 hr 20 min.
The Al Boraq high speed train operates hourly between Casablanca (Casa Voyageurs station) and Tangier with stops at Rabat (Rabat Agdal only) and Kenitra.

## By bus
There are now official bus routes listed and bus stops have signs showing at least the bus lines that stop there. Costing 5 dirham (Sep 2019), they are a cheap way to get to know the several layers of Rabat. The buses can be of very variable quality, but it could be worth taking the chance given the cost-saving and experience of what many locals with low income experience. Bus #4 goes from Ocean, to Bab El Had to Avenue Fal Oueld Omair (one of the major streets in the Agdal neighborhood) all the way to its terminus in the upscale and calm new development of Hay Riad. If the bus is crowded watch out for pickpockets.

## By plane
34.051389-6.7513895 Rabat–Salé Airport (RBA  IATA), in the nearby town of Salé. There are flights every day between Rabat and Paris, Brussels and a lot of domestic destinations. However, the most tourist fly into nearby Casablanca and then come into Rabat by train or coach.      (updated Feb 2018)
Getting there: when exiting the airport, tourists are funnelled towards a group of parked white taxis that quote 100 - 200 dirham or more. This is unnecessarily expensive. Instead wait for a petit taxi to arrive (blue for Rabat, cream coloured for neighbouring Salé.)  One of these will arrive, dropping someone else off for departure. These run on a meter ("compteur" in French) and will be nearer 30 dirham for the same journey. Beware, some of the petit taxi will refuse to use meter.
Directly outside the exit of the airport, you will also see a bus stop for AE bus, it connects Rabat-Salé Airport (RBA) with Rabat-Ville train station and Rabat-Agdal train station. First bus leave Airport at 07:10, then every 30-45 mins till last bus leave at midnight. First bus leave Gare Agdal at 06:00, then every 30-45 mins till last bus leave at 23:00. Cost 25 Dirham one way per adult (May 25).
Currency changing offices at the airport open at 7 am. ATM available in the airport building. Not all bank charge fees for withdrawal on foreign debit/credit card, could try Al Barid Bank's ATM machine. Shops inside the airport and some hotel charge EUR instead MAD.
There are telecommunications companies operate in Rabat Airport where you could buy local sim card.

## On foot
If you aren't in a hurry, walking around the area of Centre Ville, Agdal, the University, the Medina, the Ocean/River and the monuments is easy and pleasant. The new Corniche on the river, leading to the Oudaias, has been re-done, and there are expected openings of cafes soon. The route cotiere, or coastal road, past the cemetery and the Oudaias has dramatic ocean-side views, especially charming at sunset.

## By tram
There are two lines between Rabat and Salé. It costs only 6 dirham (Sep 2019) for one use and it works from 06:00-23:00. There is a tram every 10 min during the week and every 20 min during Sunday. One of the stations (Mohammed V - Gare de Rabat) is located exactly just in front of the downtown train station (Gare de Rabat-Ville). It is a good way of getting around. Maps are available in every station.

## By taxi
Petit Taxis, all blue in color, mostly Fiat Uno and Renault Dacia. This inexpensive way to get around town usually won't exceed 25/30 dirham, the minimum fare​ is 5/6 dirham. Be sure to check the meter is running to avoid being over charged at the end of the trip, although this is much less of a problem than in other cities. Don't be surprised if the taxi stops to pick someone else up. Also Uber works in Rabat, but it's 20-30% pricier than regular taxis.
Avoid the Grand Taxis when traveling around Rabat—they are much more expensive and less safe than blue petit taxis.

## By car
Driving around yourself is not recommended. Insurance rates are high and most drivers will avoid hitting you at all costs; however, Morocco does have the second highest rate of car accidents in the world, and most drivers do not abide by the traffic laws. Driving doesn't necessarily mean you are going to have an accident but Moroccans recommend great caution when driving.

## Historic center
34.0318-6.835821 Kasbah of the Oudaias. The Kasbah is the oldest part of Rabat. It has narrow streets with cute white and blue houses, the Andalucian Gardens, the Oudaias Museum housed in a 17th century palace, and a great view of the Atlantic Ocean. The district is enclosed by old fortifications, including a large and beautiful 12th-century stone gate. Free entrance.      (updated Feb 2018)
34.02617-6.836252 Old Medina. A UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with atmospheric narrow streets and a sizeable market. It is less crowded and maze-like than the medinas of Fes and Marrakesh, making it easy to explore.    (updated Nov 2019)

(updated Nov 2019)
34.013787-6.8314956 National Archaeological Museum, Ave Yacoub el Mansour. As of November 2019 closed for restoration. This museum houses artifacts from various periods of Morocco's history, including ancient Roman and medieval objects.      (updated Nov 2019)

34.012806-6.83763911 Bab er-Rouah. One of the old city's best medieval gates, located close to downtown and the Royal Palace.

Sometimes the interior is open for shows or art exhibits. Free.      (updated Jun 2023)
33.954779-6.89420712 Rabat Zoo (Jardin Zoologique de Rabat), Annexe 23eme (Infrequent bus #7, taxi costs 40 dirham but can be problematic to find it on the back), ☏ +212 634-781081. 10:00-17:30.

34.039861-6.8272514 Marinid Madrasa (Méderse Mérinide). A small but very pretty 14th-century madrasa (college), located next to the city's Grand Mosque.

## Do
There are many things to do here, as with most Moroccan cities it is enough just to wander around and adventure where something takes your fancy.

King have performed at Mawazine. There are various scenes around the city.
Football: Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium closed in 2023. A new stadium is under construction and in Dec 2025 - Jan 2026 will host games in the Africa Cup of Nations.

## Buy
Rue des Consuls an interesting place to wander. This street is so named because foreign diplomats were required to reside here in the seventeenth century until 1912. At that time the main activity of the area was piracy and taking slaves, who were then auctioned. Under a treaty with the Sultan, they were to be redeemed by diplomats from their countries who then had a budget for such purchases. For convenience, these diplomats were thus a few tens of meters from the place of "negotiation". This street was already very active one of the few to be paved. Louis Chenier, the father of the poet Andre Chenier was there representing the King of France from 1768 to 1781. Trading in the redemption of captives was his main activity and he excelled so much that even the Sultan, exhausted, sent him back to France by military force. From the Rue des Consuls, opens a number of alleys housing small shops, enabling craftsmen to maintain their expertise and their art, in often difficult circumstances.
Although the medina here is not as extensive as that of Fez or Marrakesh there are still some bargains to be had. You will find the normal array of babushka shoes, baggy pants, ornate mirrors and plates etc.! Interestingly all the Moroccans can be found in the section of the market that sells imported western style clothing from Asia and all the tourists can be found in the 'traditional' section. The lovely woolen ponchos are well worth a look and the carpet shops near the end of the medina are also very nice.

## Eat
In the centre there are often inexpensive food stalls around the medina, serving delicious fish and salad sandwiches. Especially found right around the perimeter of the Marche Centrale, these places also serve fresh and simple salads, hot bowls of lubia (beans) or lentils, rotisserie chicken, and home-made tagines. There are also lots of stalls selling pancakes and pains au chocolat.

## Budget
Most budget accommodation is found in the Old Medina of Rabat. Walking on Mohammed V street, you’ll see a lot of signs pointing to hotels. On some days these fill up quickly, so it’s good to be early. A double room will set you back about 120–150 dirham.

(updated Jun 2020)

## Stay safe
Rabat is considered a safe city. Just use some common sense: avoid wearing expensive jewellery or looking flashy, do not flash large quantities of cash, and avoid unfamiliar and deserted areas at night. If you walk in the crowded streets of the Medina or use a bus, keep a hand on your pockets. Women should avoid low-cut tops, midriffs, or shorts to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of comments, but nothing physical) although this is less of a problem than in other cities. Don't feel the need to be polite--no Moroccan woman would put up with behaviour like that.

## Connect
Rabat is served by all of the mobile companies that can be found elsewhere in Morocco: Inwi, Orange, and Maroc Telecom. Mobile phones can be bought in any of these store's stands, and most do not run on calling plans. Rather, recharge cards can be bought in corner stores that contain a number to call. When that number is called, the company adds the price of the card to your account's balance. Alternatively, more than one SIM card can be bought and changed in and out of the phone, if users need more than one phone number.

## Internet
Internet access is available in cyber cafes around the city (not in residential neighborhoods though). Service is usually around €0.50 per hr.
You'll find Wi-Fi access in some places such as Bert's or Megamall food court, usually those labelled a bit "trendy". There is also free Wi-Fi at the Rabat-Ville train station.
Phone companies offer mobile internet services that plug into the USB port of your computer (there are no mac-compatible devices.) These services can be had without signing a contract, and are recharged in the same manner as a telephone.

## Libraries
Librairie Papeterie Basta, 5, place Otmane Ibn Affane, Agdal, close to the Mac Donald. A lot of books in French, newspapers in Arabic, French, Spanish and English.
Librairie du 3ieme Millenaire[dead link], 285 Av. Mohamed V, in front of the parliament, very close to the downtown train station. One of the biggest libraries in Rabat, on two floors there are all sort of books in Arabic and French, there are also some books in English.

## Go next
Tangier lies on the North African coast at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Spartel. Tangier is a 4-hr journey from Rabat.
Meknes is in the east with a small but navigable medina.
Other places worth visiting on the Northern Atlantic coast are Asilah and Larache.
Salé is on the right bank of the Bou Regreg river, opposite the national capital Rabat. Founded in antiquity as a Phoenician colony, it became a haven for pirates as an independent republic before being incorporated into Morocco. Modern Salé is a more polluted than Rabat, badly planned, and rapidly expanding town because of an important rural exodus. The city is now a large "dormitory town". Most of its influential and wealthy inhabitants moved to Rabat on the other side of the river. There is a bridge, a tram line and a boat (2 dirham) between the two cities.
Skhirat — a small town 28 km away from Rabat, known for its beaches, the area around Skhirat has begun developing and property and land prices have increased greatly.
Casablanca — Morocco's largest and wealthiest city, it hosts headquarters and main industrial facilities for the leading Moroccan and international companies based in Morocco, Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive of Morocco's cities. However, poverty prevalent in slums on the city's outskirts and an extremely important rural exodus has led to high rates of crime, drug use, prostitution and the rise of Islamism. Casablanca is a mixed bag of Moroccan extremes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hassan Tower or Tour Hassan (Arabic: صومعة حسان); is the minaret of an incomplete mosque in Rabat, Morocco. It was commissioned by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, the third caliph of the Almohad Caliphate, near the end of the 12th century. The tower was intended to be the largest minaret in the world, and the mosque, if completed, would have been the largest in the western Muslim world. When al-Mansur died in 1199, construction on the mosque stopped. The minaret was left standing at a height of 44 meters. The rest of the mosque was also left incomplete, with only the beginnings of several walls and 348 columns being constructed. The tower, along with the remains of the mosque and the modern Mausoleum of Mohammed V, forms an important historical and tourist complex in Rabat.

Name
Although the tower and the mosque were commissioned by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, the monument is known as the "Hassan" Tower or the al-Hassan Mosque. How it came to be given this name is unknown, although the name's use is attested as early as the 13th century. One suggestion is that it may have been the architect's name, but this is not substantiated.

History
The patron who constructed the Hassan Tower is Yaqub al-Mansur, ruler of the Almohad Caliphate, a Berber Muslim empire in the Maghreb and Iberia. Al-Mansur had made the decision to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called al-Mahdiyya or Ribat al-Fath, on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the old Kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque for this capital, of which the Hassan Tower was to be the minaret. Construction of the mosque began in 1191, though the year 1195 is sometimes also cited due to historical reports by Mármol claiming that the creation of Ribat al-Fath was intended to commemorate al-Mansur's victory at the Battle of Alarcos. (The name Ribat al-Fath, at any rate, is believed to have been chosen after this victory.)
The tower, like the Giralda of Seville in Al Andalus (modern day Spain), was modeled on the minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh, but also drew influence from the ancient Egyptian Lighthouse of Alexandria for its height and method of ascendancy, a series of ramps. Yaqub al-Mansur conducted other works in Rabat, most notably the construction of new city walls and gates and additions to the Kasbah of the Udayas. Despite all this work and expense, the Almohad capital remained at Marrakesh and was never actually moved to Rabat.
After Yaqub al-Mansur's death in 1199 the mosque and the new capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The structure was left with only the beginnings of its walls and 348 columns. While there is evidence that some tiled roofing had been added to the mosque before it was abandoned, almost all materials that could be carried away were eventually stripped from the site for reuse in construction elsewhere. In addition to being incomplete, the mosque sustained some damage in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
In the 20th century colonial French and Moroccan archeologists excavated the site and carefully reconstructed what was left. In the 1960s the site of mosque's ruins was transformed to accommodate the construction of the Mausoleum of Mohammed V at its southeastern corner, alongside a modern mosque and another pavilion which occupy the rest of the southern side of the complex. The modern mausoleum and mosque were designed by Vietnamese architect Cong Vo Toan and completed in 1971. The tower and the site of the mosque was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 1, 1995, in the Cultural category. It was granted World Heritage Status in 2012 as part of the larger site encompassing historic Rabat.

Design
The mosque
The mosque is strategically placed on the high south bank of the Bu Regreg river to provide an imposing spectacle visible for miles around. Since the area surrounding was suburban at the time of construction and lacked the population to regularly fill the mosque, historians have been led to believe that it was meant to serve the Almohad troops who gathered here before setting off on campaigns and possibly even to serve double-duty as both a place of worship and as a fortress.

The mosque's total dimensions were enormous for the time: 183 by 139 meters (600 by 456 ft). If completed, it would have been the largest mosque in the western part of the Islamic world, larger even than the Great Mosque of Cordoba. The mosque's perimeter was further enclosed by another wall that stood about 50 meters distant from the mosque itself on all sides except on the northern side where it stood over 100 meters distant.The walls of the mosque were made of lime concrete on top of a rubble stone base. The interior of the mosque was in hypostyle format and was divided by rows of columns into 21 aisles running perpendicular to the qibla wall (the southern/southeastern wall in the direction of prayer). The most central aisle and the two aisles along the far sides were wider than the others. Notably, the mosque was given cylindrical stone columns rather than the brick piers more commonly seen in Almohad architecture. These columns were to be formed from drums of differing height, an idea that, while innovative at the time, slowed construction significantly and contributed to the mosque's unfinished state. Scholar Christian Ewert has speculated that since the new capital and its mosque were intended as a staging area for troops going to Al-Andalus, some of the motivation for this unusual design feature may have been a desire to evoke the columns of the Great Mosque of Cordoba, the most celebrated mosque in Al-Andalus. 
The plan originally included three small inner courtyards, one in the back, parallel to the qibla wall, and the other two on either side of the prayer hall, allowing daylight and fresh air to flow in through the arcades. This was another unusual feature, as most mosques had only one main courtyard, but the motivation for this design was likely due to the mosque's size and the need to bring more light into its unprecedently large interior.

The tower (minaret)
The tower is made of sandstone which has progressively turned a red ochre colour over the centuries. It has a square floor plan like other minarets in the region, measuring 16 meters per side. The current structure is 44 m (144 ft) tall but its intended height – based on knowledge of the regular proportions of other Almohad minarets – was at least 64 m (210 ft), possibly 80 m (260 ft) to the top of its second tier (the smaller lantern tower usually topping minarets) and finial. This would have made it slightly taller than the original Giralda in Seville. Instead of stairs, the tower is ascended by ramps, which would have allowed the muezzin to ride a horse to the top to issue the call to prayer. At the center of each of the six floors would have been a vaulted chamber surrounded by the ramps and lit by the horseshoe-shaped windows set into the sides of the tower. Its exterior is decorated with panels of sebka patterning as well as engaged columns and capitals carved from the same sandstone as the tower itself, although today it also retains one marble capital of Andalusi spolia.

صومعة حسان من المباني التاريخية المتميزة بالعاصمة المغربية الرباط، والتي شيدت في عصر دولة الموحدين. أُسس «جامع حسان» بناءً على أمر يعقوب المنصور سنة 593 هـ (1197-1198 م) أضافت منظمة اليونسكو للتراث العالمي هذا الموقع لقائمة أولية 1 يوليو 1995 في فئة الثقافة.، كما يمكننا تشبيه صومعة حسان بتحفة فنية مميزة تشهد على التاريخ الأثري للمدينة، حيث تعتبر من أفضل الأماكن السياحية في مدينة الرباط.

لمحة تاريخية
شيدت من طرف السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي، وكان يعد من أكبر المساجد في عهده. لكن هذا المشروع الطموح توقف بعد وفاته سنة 1199، كما تعرض للاندثار بسبب الزلزال الذي ضرب الرباط سنة 1755م. وتشهد آثاره على مدى ضخامة البناية الأصلية للمسجد، حيث يصل طوله 180 مترا وعرضه 140 مترا، كما تشهد الصومعة التي تعد إحدى الشقيقات الثلاث لصومعة الكتبية بمراكش، والخيرالدا بإشبيلية على وجود المسجد وضخامته.
ويرى المؤرخون أن اختيار هذا المسجد الذي تتجاوز مساحته 2550م2 بمدينة الرباط ليكون أكبر مساجد المغرب وليداني أكبر مساجد الشرق مساحة وفخامة، يدل على أن الموحدين كانوا يرغبون في أن يتخذوا من الرباط مدينة كبيرة تخلف في أهميتها مدينتي فاس ومراكش، وبالرغم من العناية التي بذلها كل من أبي يعقوب وأبي يوسف في إنشاء مدينة كبيرة بكل مرافقها لتخلد بذلك اسم الدولة الموحدية، فإن الرباط في الواقع لم تعمر بقدر ما كان يأمله منها أبو يوسف وخلفه. وهذا الأمر قد يكون من أهم الأسباب التي أوقفت حركة البناء في هذا الجامع بالإضافة إلى موت أبو يوسف المنصور قبل إكمال بنائه، كما أنه كان يستنفذ موارد الدولة مع المرافق الأخرى للرباط.
في عهد الدولة الموحدية نفسها وفي فترة احتضارها عمد السعيد الموحدي إلى أخشاب المسجد وأبوابه، فصنع منها أجفانا سنة 641هـ فما لبثت أن احترقت بنهر أم الربيع وبذلك فسح للعامة مجال النهب والسلب ليسطوا على بقية هذه الأخشاب التي كانت من أشجار الأرز. وتوالي السطو أيام المرينيين ثم السعديين بل حتى أيام العلويين عهد السلطان عبد الله بن إسماعيل حيث صنع القراصنة من سلا والرباط سفينة من أخشاب الجامع المذكور وسموها بسفينة الكراكجية ثم انتزعها منهم السلطان محمد بن عبد الله.
ولم تكن أحداث الطبيعة بأرحم من الناس على هذا الأثر، فقد كان زلزال لشبونة سنة 1169هـ (1755م) الذي عم أثره بعض أنحاء المغرب خاصةً مكناس والرباط، سببا في سقوط عدة أعمدة وأطراف من السور والمنار، كما تهدمت عدة منازل من الرباط ثم تلا هذا الزلزال حريق عظيم أتى على ما بقي من أخشاب المسجد التي تحولت رمادا، وكان للأمطار ورطوبة البحر وتقلبات الجو أثرها أيضا على هذا البناء الأثري حتى استحال الجانب المطل على نهر أبي رقراق من المنار رماديا كما يبدو ذلك حتى الآن.
أدرجت منظمة اليونسكو صومعة حسان ضمن قائمة المواقع التاريخية البارزة، لما تمثله من قيمة حضارية ومعمارية رفيعة. .

مواد البناء
تتكون مواد البناء من مختلف المواد التي تشكل عادة البناء الأندلسي المغربي، كالحجر الرملي والآجر والحجر المنحوت والجص الذي كان يحتوي على قدر وافر من الجير ثم الرخام والخشب. وكانت تحادي سور القبلة عدة أبراج للزينة ولحفظ التوازن في آن واحد.
وليس معروفًا تمامًا الطريقة التي اعتمد عليها الموحدون لامداد الجامع بالماء، بصرف النظر عن الآبار، ولكن من الثابت أن عين أغبولة (بالدشيرة) كانت المورد الرئيسي لإمداد المدينة كلها بالماء، بل ولإمداد سلا أيضا عن طريق اقنية تمتد على القنطرة الكبيرة التي بناها أبو يوسف المنصور بين العدوتين، وهي قنطرة كان يعبرها الجيش وعموم الناس وكانت مبنية بناء محكما حسبما نقله صاحب كتاب «المغرب ومدنه الأثرية».

معالم وتعريف الصومعة
الصومعة مربعة الشكل ويصل علوها 44 مترا، ولها مطلع داخلي ملتو، يؤدي إلى أعلى الصومعة ويمر على ست غرف تشكل طبقات. وقد زينت واجهاتها الأربع بزخارف ونقوش مختلفة على الحجر المنحوت وذلك على النمط الأندلسي المغربي من القرن الثاني عشر.
يبلغ عرض جدار المنار مترين ونصف، ومن شأن العرض أن يحفظ توازنه، كما يبلغ عرض الصور مترا ونصف، وعلوه تسعة أمتار. وكان يقابل المحراب في خط مستقيم بخلاف أكثر المنارات في العمارة المغربية الأخرى التي تنزوي عادة في أحد الركنين من الجدار المقابل لجدار المحراب. ومن شأن هذا التصميم أن يضفي على الجامع طابعا هندسيا مميزًا. يبلغ كل جانب من المنار 16 مترا عرضا. أما ارتفاعه. فيبلغ 65 مترا ولكنه لو تم لبلغ علوه تقدير بعض الخبراء 80 مترا. وأهم المميزات المعمارية في هذا المنار بناؤه من حجر صلد نضدت أجزاؤه بعناية بالغة، وليس من المستبعد أن تكون أحجار المنار قد اقتطعت من محاجر تقع بالرباط نفسها.
اُختير موقع الصومعة في أمتن البقاع وأقدرها تحملا لثقل هذا البناء المميز. أضف إلى هذه المميزات أن الصومعة سهلة الارتقاء بفضل الدرجات المنبسطة التي كانت ترقاها الدواب حاملة أدوات البناء من حجر وطين وغيره. ولولا هذه المتانة التي تميز بناء المنار لتداعى على أثر الزلزال سنة 1755 م. ويكاد يستحيل أن تُؤْخَذ نظرة حقيقية عن الفن الزخرفي المعقد الذي تتميز به الصومعة، ولعل أهم ما يميزها هو التصميم الزخرفي المختلف لكل وجه من أوجهها الأربع. فالعقود المتجاوزة التي نحتت على كل من جدران المنار تزينها المقرنصات التي يرجع اتخاذها بالمغرب إلى عهد المرابطين، ولكنها تطورت بعدهم مع تعاقب الدول حتى اتخذت أشكالاً مختلفة. أما المعينات المقرصنة بدورها فتمثل بداية لدخول هذا الشكل الهندسي في مختلف العناصر الزخرفية في فن البناء وغيره منذ عصر المرينيين، كما يستدل على ذلك من بوابات المدارس ونوافذ بيوت الطلبة والمصنوعات الجلدية.

مكونات المسجد
يبلغ طول المسجد 183م و139م عرضا. كما تبلغ مساحة قاعة الصلاة وحدها أزيد من 1932 مترا مربعا (أي 139 × 139) وهي مساحة غير معهودة في قاعات الصلاة بالمساجد الأخرى.
وليس للمسجد صحن واحد كباقي المساجد المغربية بل له صحن كبير قرب المنار وصحنان جانبيان ووسطه كله تثفله الأعمدة التي تتفاوت علوا من 25 ر 3م إلى 50 ر 6م، وتتميز البلاطات المقاربة للأسوار بعلو أعمدتها المستديرة الشكل. على أن استدارة الأعمدة كلها أمر غير عادي في عامة مساجد المغرب. ولضمان متانة السقوف، فقد اختيرت الأعمدة من الحجر والرخام الذي لا يعرف بالضبط مصدره ولكنه مجلوب من خارج الرباط. كما أن كل عمود يتكون من عدة قطع كثير منها غير منسجم انسجاما تاما ولكن لا يبعد أن تكون نية المصمم قد اتجهت إلى تلبيس أو زخرفة هذه الأعمدة فيما بعد، وإن كان من المعتاد لدى الموحدين وسابقيهم المرابطين الاهتمام بعنصر الضخامة والبساطة أكثر من الاهتمام بعنصر الزخرفة. وككل مساجد المغرب تقريبا فإن عقود جامع حسان كانت على ما يحتمل تتجه نحو القبلة.

بيت الصلاة
ويشكل بيت الصلاة تصميما على شكل T ولكن الغريب أن أكثر الأساليب الكبرى هي التي تحادي الصحن المجاور للمنار. ويبلغ مجموع أساكيب بيت الصلاة 18 منها ثلاثة في الجنوب وسبعة في الشمال تحتوي على تسع عشرة بلاطة. أما الأساكيب الوسطى التي يجاورها صحنان صغيران فتشتمل على إحدى عشرة بلاطة وهذا بقطع النظر عن الأروقة الجانبية.
وفي داخل بيت الصلاة يمكن مشاهدة أعمدة صغيرة بين الأعمدة الأساسية، وهي من الآجر ويرتفع علوها إلى 40 سنتمترا تقريبا. وكان الغرض من هذه الأعمدة الصغيرة حفظ القوالب التي شيدت عليها العقود والتي ضاع أثرها. ويوجد جنوب الصحنين الصغيرين ثلاث بلاطات صغيرة وثلاث أكاسيب يفصلها عن باقي بيت الصلاة أعمدة صغيرة.

أعمدة المسجد
تبلغ أعمدته حوالي أربعمائة، كما كان عدد أبوابه 16، ستة منها في الجانب الغربي وأربعة في الجانب الشرقي واثنان جنوبا وأربعة في الجانب الشمالي. على أن تساقط أعمدة الجامع سنة 1755م ثم إعادة وضعها في عهد الحماية الفرنسية قد يثير بعض الشك في التصميم الأصلي لأعمدة المسجد. ولعل هذا هو السبب في عدم تناسق قطعيا تناسقا تاما.

محراب المسجد
أما محراب المسجد فيبلغ ثلاثة أمتار عرضا وثلاثة طولا. ولكن لم يبق إلا مكانة تهدم أعلاه. ويحيط بالمسجد سور عظيم يبدو من جهة المحراب مزدوجا، بدليل أن بعض أجزاء هذه الجهة قد سقط منها السور الداخلي، وبقي السور الخارجي مائلا.
وقد عمل في هذا المسجد سبعمائة أسير من أسارى الأفرنج مثل كثير من المساجد الأخرى بالمغرب. وقد وصفه صاحب الروض المعطار بأنه من أعظم مساجد الإسلام وأحسنها شكلا وأفسحها مجالا وأنزهها منظرا. ويلاحظ أن المحراب الذي يقع في أقصى البلاطة المركزية لا يتجه نحو الجنوب الشرقي، فجدار القبلة ينحرف كثيرا نحو الشرق، وهو مربع الشكل بخلاف باقي المساجد المغربية. ويتجه الصحنان الجانبيان عبر ثمانية أساكيب وثلاث بلاطات ويحيط بهما أعمدة ترتفع عليها عقود.

أبواب المسجد
ونظرا لارتفاع البناء فإن بعض أبواب المسجد كان يصعد إليها بدرجات لم يبق منها الآن إلا سافلها، يحيط بها جدران من الجص وكانت سبعة من هذه الأبواب تشرف على الصحن. وكانت الأبواب في غاية الضخامة حسب تقدير بعض الخبراء. فقد كان ارتفاعها يتجاوز ارتفاع الجدار نفسه أي 10 أمتار، كما كان عرضها يداني عشرة أمتار ونصفا.
أما تيجان الأعمدة فتختلف زخرفته، فبعضها يشبه تيجان باب الرواح وبعضها يشبه تيجان أعمدة مسجد قرطبة.

صحن المسجد
ويمتد الصحن الكبير على مسافة 139 × 139م. ويشمل على آبار تغطيها عدة عقود. وتقع الآبار في وسط الصحن المذكور ويبلغ طولها 69 مترا وعرضها 28 مترا ونصفا بينما يتجاوز عمقها سبعة أمتار. وتحادي الصحن الكبير أروقة تمتد على جانب سور الجامع من الشرق إلى الغرب، كما يمتد رواق مزدوج جهة الجنوب.

الفن الزخرفي لهذا المسجد
ويستمد جامع حسان فنه بالجملة من مساجد الأندلس و[القيروان] والشرق الإسلامي. وهكذا يأخذ الجامع شكله العام من هندسة الجوامع الأندلسية، ومن بين مؤثراته الشرقية السدفتان المواجهتان لجدار القبلة، ومن مؤثرات القيروان عقود المنار المتجاوزة، وكذلك عدم تساوي الأعمدة ولو أنها كانت عن قصد في جامع حسان، ربما لترفع فوق صغارها قباب تتساوى في ارتفاعها مع السقف المنصوب فوق الأعمدة الكبيرة، ولكي لا يضفي تساوي العقود على المسجد طابعا رتيبا.

قنوات الماء
يحتوي المسجد على آبار داخلية لحفظ المياه وتصريفها وبالتالي للاستعانة بها بالإضافة إلى مياه القنوات الخارجية التي لا يبدو لها مع ذلك أثر، كما لا نشاهد أثرا لفسقيات الوضوء التي يبدو من تصميم الجامع أنه لم يكن لها مكان في وسطه الذي كان معدا للتسقيف كمعظم مساحة الجامع.
ولقنوات الماء منافذ متباعدة تسدها بلاطات حجرية. وتمتد قناة أسفل أرض كل صحن على عمق ثلاثة أمتار وقد بنيت كلها من الجص إلا في بعض الأماكن حيث تتشكل أقواسها من الآجر. وعلى مسافة من أركان الآبار في الحاجز الشمالي تمتد قنوات أخرى محاذية لجوانب الصومعة. وهذه القنوات أسفل الأرض كسابقتها.
تقع صومعة حسان هي موقع للتراث الثقافي المغربي، في الجانب الشمالي من المسجد بالرباط، الذي بدأ بناؤه على يد يعقوب المنصور الموحدي سنة 1195 م وتوقف بوفاته سنة 1199م. عرض كل جانب منها 16.20 مترا. أما ارتفاعها فيصل إلى 67.50 مترا، وعرض جدرانها 2.50 م. يصعد إليها بواسطة غقبات صغيرة إلى حد ما يبلغ عرضها 2 م تقريبا وهي أهم أثر ظل قائما في هذا الجامع. الواجهات الخارجية للصومعة المشهورة مبنية بالحجر . وتوجد بها فتحات تضيء الدرج . وهي مزينة بمجموعة كبيرة من الزخارف والنقوش التي يختلف شكلها في كل واجهة.

The Chellah or Shalla (Berber languages: Sla or Calla; Arabic: شالة) is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis and ancient archeological site in Rabat, Morocco, located on the south (left) side of the Bou Regreg estuary. The earliest evidence of the site's occupation suggests that the Phoenicians established a trading emporium here in the first millennium BC. This was later the site of Sala Colonia, an ancient Roman colony in the province of Mauretania Tingitana, before it was abandoned in Late Antiquity. In the late 13th century the site began to be used as a dynastic necropolis for the Marinid dynasty. By the mid-14th century Marinid sultans had enclosed a part of the site with a new set of walls and built a religious complex inside it to accompany their mausoleums. In the 15th century the necropolis began to decline and it suffered damage over the centuries due to earthquakes and looting. Archeological excavations in the 20th century unearthed the remains of the ancient Roman town. Today the site is a tourist attraction and since 2012 it forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

History
Phoenician Sala
The Phoenicians founded several trading colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now Morocco, but the existence of a Phoenician settlement on the site of Chellah has been debated by archeologists. Jean Boube, who led some of the modern excavations at the site, discovered neo-Punic artifacts dating as far back as the 3rd century BC, which suggests there must have been a small trading post here around that time. Later excavations by Boube also found fragments of Phoenician or Punic bowls dating to the 7th and early 6th centuries BC, but it is possible that such early items were imported by trade rather than being evidence of occupation. The settlement along the banks of the Bou Regreg was known as Shalat (Punic: 𐤔𐤏‬𐤋𐤕, šʿlt; compare Hebrew סלע, rock), which appears to derive from the Punic word for "rock".

Roman Sala Colonia
By the first century BC the local inhabitants were still writing in the neo-Punic language but the region came under the influence of Rome. At this time the area was occupied by the ancient Berber Mauretanian Kingdom. Under its last two rulers, Juba II and Ptolemy, the Mauretanian kingdom became a client state of Rome. Some relics from the time of these two kings have been discovered at Chellah. After the death of Ptolemy in 40 AD the region was annexed by Rome and became the province of Mauretania Tingitana.
On this site the Romans built their own city, Sala Colonia. The Roman town was referred to as "Sala" by Ptolemy, a 2nd-century writer. Excavations have revealed that older Mauretanian structures existed on the site before Roman structures were built over them. For the Roman period, they show a substantial port city with ruined Roman architectural elements including a decumanus maximus or principal roadway, a forum and a triumphal arch. The area around the forum, excavated and visible today, was subjected to many transformations over time and the exact chronology of these is still debated. Inscriptions found on site show that the city had the status of a municipium around the mid-2nd century AD.
One of the two main Roman roads in Mauretania Tingitana reached the Atlantic through Iulia Constantia Zilil (Asilah), Lixus (Larache) and Sala Colonia. Another may have been built towards the south, from Sala to modern Casablanca, then called Anfa. The Romans had two main naval outposts on the Atlantic coast of the province: Sala Colonia, and Lixus. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the Insula Purpuraria (Mogador island).
Sala remained linked to the Roman Empire even after the withdrawal in the 4th century of the occupying Roman legions to Tingis (Tangier) and Septem (Ceuta) in northern Mauretania Tingitana. A Roman military unit remained there until the end of the 5th century. Some of the major monuments of the town were abandoned around this time. The site of the large capitolium temple, for example, was turned into a cemetery and a dumping ground during the 4th century. Archaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in North Africa during the 7th century. Fragments of pottery with Christian motifs and graffiti have also been found among objects dating from the 4th to 6th centuries.

Early Muslim period
Sala began to be abandoned in the 5th century and was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century. The Byzantine governor of the area, Count Julian of Ceuta, surrendered to Uqba ibn Nafi in 683.
The area was only occupied again in the 10th century, when historical sources mention the existence of a ribat in the area. Around 1030, a new town called Salā (present-day Salé) was founded on the opposite side of the river (the north side) by the Banu 'Ashara family. After the end of the Umayyad Caliphate in Al-Andalus in the early 11th century, the Almoravids assumed control of the region and built a new ribat at the mouth of the river. This ribat was in turn destroyed and then rebuilt by their successors, the Almohads, in the mid-12th century, becoming what is now known as the Kasbah of the Udayas. The Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199) also began construction of a vast new royal city with new walls on the site next to ancient Sala, corresponding to what is now the historic center of Rabat, but it was never finished. The town of Salā on the right bank (northern side) of the river continued to develop and during the following Marinid dynasty period (13th to 15th centuries) it grew more important than the settlements of the left bank.

Marinid period
During the Marinid period the site of ancient Sala was re-appropriated and turned into a royal necropolis for the ruling dynasty, now known as Chellah (Arabic: شالة, romanized: Shāllah). Because of its ruined condition today, the exact chronology of its development is not well known. The first Marinid constructions and the first royal burial were in 1284–85, when sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub chose the site to bury his wife, Umm al-'Izz. He built a small mosque (still extant) next to her tomb. The tomb itself was a qubba, a small mausoleum chamber covered by a dome or pyramidal roof. The sultan himself was buried next to her after his death in Algeciras in 1286. His son and successor, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, was buried at the site after his death in 1307, and his successor, Abu Thabit 'Amir, was buried near Abu Ya'qub Yusuf in 1308.

The most important Marinid constructions appear to have occurred during the reigns of Abu Sa'id Uthman II (r. 1310–1331) and his son, Abu al-Hasan (r. 1331–1348; also known as the Black Sultan). Abu Sa'id enclosed the area with a set of walls and began construction of the main gate. According to some sources he was buried in this necropolis too after his death in 1331, though Ibn Khaldun wrote that he was buried in Fez. Construction of the main gate was finished by Abu al-Hasan, as evidenced by an inscription on it which dates its completion to July 1339 (Dhu al-Qadah 739 AH) and refers to the complex as a "ribat". During Abu al-Hasan's lifetime one of his wives, Shams al-Ḍuḥa (the mother of Abu Inan), was buried here in 1349. One of his sons, Abu Malik, may have also been buried in the necropolis in 1339. After his death in exile in 1351, Abu al-Hasan's body was buried in a mausoleum here as well, near his wife. This mausoleum may have been finished by his son and successor, Abu Inan (r. 1348–1358). Abu Inan may have also been responsible for building or completing the madrasa (Islamic college) and the prominent minaret that adjoin the mosque and mausoleums. He set up a charitable endowment (waqf) to fund the operations of the religious complex. Remains at the site today also show that the necropolis was accompanied by a residential quarter to the north, complete with a water supply system. A preserved hammam (bathhouse) from this period also stands near the far eastern corner of the walled enclosure.
Abu al-Hasan was the last sultan to be buried here. Abu Inan is believed to have been buried at the Great Mosque of Fes el-Jdid and other Marinid sultans after him were mostly buried at the Marinid Tombs in Fez or other sites. Other Marinid family members, such as Abu Inan's sister and other princes, were still occasionally buried at Chellah. Between 1360 and 1363 Ibn al-Khatib, the vizier of the Nasrid sultan Muhammad V, visited the site during his master's exile from Granada and mentioned it in his writings. He described the luxurious decoration of the tombs and noted that a large fragment of a kiswah (the cloth that covers the Ka'ba in Mecca) was draped over the tomb of Abu al-Hasan.

Post-Marinid period and modern era
After the Marinid period the necropolis declined. It was pillaged for the first time by Ahmad al-Liḥyani, a pretender to the Marinid throne based in Meknes between 1417 and 1437. Although he and other pretenders were eventually suppressed by Abu Zakariya Yahya, the regent and de facto Wattasid ruler between 1420 and 1448, the Wattasids chose not to try and restore the necropolis. Many of the remaining structures in Chellah were damaged by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and fell into ruins. The 'Alawi sultans stationed soldiers here afterwards to prevent further looting, but in the late 18th century an Arab tribe, the Ṣabbaḥ, took possession of the enclosure until in 1790 sultan Moulay Yazid charged the governor of Salé, Abu Ya'za al-Qasṭali, with removing them. During this episode the necropolis was again looted.

Despite this decline, the site acquired local religious importance over time. At some point, Sufis began to inhabit the site and the madrasa was reused as a zawiya (Sufi religious and educational center). The zawiya also became the object of a local pilgrimage, with locals believing that a visit here could be a substitute for the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca for those who couldn't afford that long journey. As part of their visit, pilgrims performed a circumambulation (tawaf) of the madrasa's mihrab. Popular legends also grew around the tombs. The tomb of Shams al-Ḍuḥa came to be popularly known as the tomb of a girl named Lalla Chella, to which the site's name was popularly attributed. Some local beliefs, especially among women, associated beneficial maraboutic powers to some of the animals, like the eels and turtles, that lived in the pools here. For example, it was believed that feeding the eels could aid fertility and childbirth. Legends about buried treasures also led to illegal excavations at times and pushed authorities in the 20th century to move some of the most important objects in the necropolis to museums in Rabat.

The remains of the ancient Roman city were first identified in the late 19th century by French geographer Charles Tissot. The first investigation and study of the Islamic-era remains were carried out by Henri Basset and Évariste Lévi-Provençal in 1922. The first excavations of the Roman city were carried out in 1929–30 under the supervision of Jules Borély, head of the Service des Beaux-Arts, an agency of the French Protectorate in Morocco at that time. This initial work cleared away vegetation from the ruined mosque and unearthed a large portion of the "monumental" Roman quarter visible today.  Excavations did not take place again until 1958, after Moroccan independence, when the head of the Service des Antiquités du Maroc, Maurice Euzennat, appointed Jean Boube to begin a new campaign of excavations. Excavations continued on and off until 1996, unearthing the rest of the structures now visible.
Today, the site of Chellah has been converted to a garden and tourist attraction. It is part of the metropolitan area of Rabat. The site, as part of historic Rabat, was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2012. It's also notable for hosting a large colony of storks, who nest in the trees as well as on the minaret of the ruined zawiya.
On 3 November 2023, a team of Moroccan archaeologists and researchers discovered the first port district of the Roman era in Morocco, dating from the first to the second century AD, along with the first life-sized headless statue of a female goddess found in Morocco since 1960.

The Roman remains
The excavated portion of the Roman city covers about 1.2 hectares and corresponds to the "monumental" district around the forum, where the most important public buildings stood. The city was built on a sloped site and consequently its buildings were constructed upon a series of artificial terraces, with at least three terraces visible today. Streets were laid out in a regular grid and the two most important streets were the decumanus maximus and the cardo maximus.
At the eastern end of the excavated area is the forum. It is flanked on its north side by a structure standing on higher ground which has been identified as a "temple" with five cellae. On the south side of the plaza, on a lower level, is a long building with nine rooms, possibly tabernae (shops), that open onto another street. The dating of the temple and the adjoining forum has been debated. Jean Boube dated the temple to the mid-first century BC, which would make it a Mauretanian structure (before the region was annexed as a Roman province). Statues of the Mauretanian client kings Juba II and Ptolemy have been found here, leading Boube to suggest the temple was originally dedicated to them. Other archeologists have argued that it belongs instead to the Roman period (after annexation). More recent studies have again suggested a pre-Roman dating, based on the construction techniques present.

On the west side of the forum is another wide paved space which may have been an additional forum (forum adiectum) or a part of the decumanus maximus. Boube dated it to the reigns of Trajan (r. 98–117) and Hadrian (r. 117–138). The largest structure here, on the northwest side, is the capitolium or capitoline temple. The temple is built on two levels and has a rectangular floor plan, measuring about 48 metres by 26 metres, with rounded corners on its west side. On the lower level were nine vaulted tabernae chambers which opened onto the paved area next to the temple and formed a part of the temple's substructure. The upper level was the temple proper, consisting of single cella and a pronaos (vestibule chamber), elevated on a podium and surrounded on three sides by a portico of 32 columns. The parts of the temple that were built above the tabernae have collapsed. Roman inscriptions found on site confirm that the temple was built in the time of Hadrian and possibly inaugurated around 120 AD. Its construction was funded by a private citizen, a military official named C. Hosidius Severus, who gifted it to the people of the city.

The other major building in this western area is located directly opposite the capitolium, to the south and near the perimeter wall of the Marinid religious complex. This building is poorly preserved and has been tentatively identified as either a curia (the Curia Ulpia) or as a basilica. Its construction is likely contemporary with that of the nearby capitolium. It has a rectangular floor plan measuring about 32 by 19 metres. At its center is a large octagonal opening, with niches set along its interior walls, that corresponds to an underground nymphaeum that once extended further up to the ground level of the building.
Between the capitolium and the curia/basilica are the remains of a triumphal arch. Only the base of the arch remains and therefore not much is known for certain about it. It may date from the time of Hadrian, like the surrounding buildings, but another hypothesis has dated it to around the time of Antoninus Pius (r. 138–161). Various other structures are scattered around the site, including two more structures identified as temples to the east of the capitolium. Remains of a Roman bath are found in the eastern part of the site, between the Marinid madrasa and the Islamic-era bathhouse.

The Marinid necropolis
The area enclosed by the Marinid walls is roughly pentagonal in shape and is smaller than the former Roman city. Most of the Marinid structures inside are contained within a religious complex in the southeastern part of the enclosure, called the khalwa (Arabic: خلوة). Outside this complex there is also a hammam in the far eastern corner of the enclosure and a residential complex located just inside the main gate. The khalwa consists principally of a mosque, a madrasa, a cemetery with multiple mausoleums, and several courtyards. Its layout is irregular and complicated due to the addition of various elements over different periods. On its southwest side is a pool whose water comes from the spring of 'Ayn al-Janna (Arabic: عين ألجنّا, lit. 'spring/source of paradise'). The pool was originally the latrines and ablutions facility of the 13th-century mosque, but at some point it became submerged due to water seeping in from underground and it is now inhabited by eels.

Walls and main gate
The rampart walls surrounding the site are built in rammed earth (or pisé). They are pierced by three gates and interspersed with defensive towers. The towers typically have a square base and contain three levels inside. The most monumental gate is in the northwestern part of the enclosure and is built in brick and cut stone with carved ornamentation. It is one of the most exceptional gates built by the Marinids, demonstrating influences from earlier monumental gates built by the Almohads (e.g. Bab er-Rouah and Bab Oudaya). The gate's façade is decorated with two polylobed arch motifs around the pointed horseshoe-shaped archway. The spandrels of the arch are filled with a foliate arabesque motif featuring a carved shell at their centers. The whole composition is framed by a rectangular frieze (an alfiz) containing a Kufic Arabic inscription that details the construction of the gate. The gate is flanked by two towers that have prismatic or semi-octagonal bases but are crowned with square turrets. The transition from the semi-octagonal body of the tower to the square turret above is accomplished with the use of muqarnas in the corners. Inside, the gate has a bent passage that turns 90 degrees. The inner façade of the gate, facing towards the religious complex, is decorated with a simpler version of the motifs seen on the outside of the gate.

The khalwa (religious and funerary complex)
The mosque, located in the center of the southwestern half of the complex, is a hypostyle hall. It is divided into three naves by two rows of horseshoe arches. Two more rows of arches, perpendicular to the others, delimit a central aisle running towards the mihrab on the southeastern wall. At the mosque's southwest corner is a small, partly ruined minaret with a square base and polylobed-arch windows. Outside the mosque, near the minaret, is a small water basin or well that was used for ablutions fed by a local spring. Behind the qibla wall of the mosque, on its southeast side, is a rawda (Arabic: الروضة) or garden cemetery. It consists of a long enclosure with at least four ruined mausoleums and a number of other graves scattered across the open space. According to Basset and Lévi-Provençal, the three mausoleums adjoined to the back wall of the mosque include the tomb of Sultan Abu Sa'id (d. 1331) and the tomb of Shams al-Ḍuḥa (d. 1349). Each tomb is a qubba or square chamber that was probably once covered by a dome or a pyramidal tiled roof, similar to other mausoleums in Morocco. These tombs are largely ruined and contain only small fragments of their former decoration.

The ruined qubba further south, set against the perimeter wall of the complex, belongs to Sultan Abu al-Hasan (d. 1351). This is the most richly decorated tomb in the complex and is better-preserved than the other tombs. Its remaining walls are covered in elaborate low-relief decoration carved in stone. The back wall inside the mausoleum has a central double-arched niche framed by an epigraphic frieze containing verses 30 and 31 of Surah XVI from the Qur'an. This in turn is surrounded by geometric decoration and more epigraphic decoration. Zellij (mosaic tilework) decorated the lower portions of the wall. Three windows are pierced above this. The exterior side of this wall, facing out from the complex, is carved with two rectangular friezes, one filled with an ornate Kufic inscription and the other with a Naskhi (cursive) inscription. The Kufic inscription includes verse 185 of Surah III, while the Naskhi inscription is a dedication to Abu al-Hasan. These two friezes enclose a central rectangular zone filled with sebka decoration above three blind polylobed arches with small colonettes. The negative spaces inside the sebka pattern are each carved with another motif including a shell or palmette, while the blind arches below are filled with arabesques (for the side arches) and with a repeating calligram in "knotted" Kufic (for the central arch). Above this runs another small blind arcade and a muqarnas cornice above it.

Most of the northeastern half of the complex is occupied by a building which scholars believe was most likely a madrasa, though two surviving inscriptions refer to it as a "zawiya". Similar to other madrasas of the era, it consists of an elongated rectangular courtyard with a rectangular pool at its center. At each end of the basin are two small circular basins with fountains that provided water for the pool. The courtyard was once surrounded by a peristyle portico supported by marble columns, no longer standing. Behind the portico, on the two long sides of the courtyard, are a number of small rooms which served as sleeping quarters for students. Two staircases provided access to an upper floor above this, probably with a similar layout. The courtyard was paved and decorated with intricate zellij (mosaic tilework), parts of which survive. At the southeast end of the courtyard a doorway leads to a rectangular hall that served as a prayer room. A mihrab was set in the back wall here. Unusually, the mihrab is surrounded by a narrow passage that runs around and behind it. This passage may have been used by pilgrims who circumambulated it. At the northeastern corner of the madrasa is a preserved minaret, about 15 metres tall and prominently visible from most of the site. Its main shaft has a traditional square base and its four facades are each decorated with a sebka composition above two blind polylobed arches (each enclosing small windows). The negative spaces within these motifs are filled with zellij tile decoration.

In addition to Abu al-Hasan's mausoleum, one of the most exceptional examples of decoration in the complex is the gateway that leads towards the madrasa from the forecourt on the north side of the mosque. The gate, a horseshoe arch, is framed by a rectangular frieze or alfiz filled with geometric star patterns in zellij tiling. The spandrels of the archway are filled with arabesque motifs and a polylobed arch motif, similar to the monumental main gate of the complex, but instead of carved stone they are executed in highly colourful zellij tiling. The decoration of this gateway also has similarities to the gate of the Sidi Boumediene Complex in Tlemcen (present-day Algeria), suggesting that the same team of artisans may have been involved in both designs.

Hammam
The hammam (Islamic bathhouse) of Chellah has a roughly rectangular floor plan measuring 28.5 by 10.4 metres. Henri Terrasse estimated that its construction was contemporary with the other major Marinid structures in Chellah and that it took place between 1339 and 1358. It was restored in the 20th century. It shares general similarities with other historic hammams in this part of the Islamic world. It consists of a changing room near the entrance (equivalent to the Roman apodyterium), followed by a cold room (equivalent to the frigidarium), a warm room (equivalent to the tepidarium), and a hot room (equivalent to the caldarium). Another chamber behind the hot room contained the furnace that heated the baths and its water via the traditional hypocaust system. A small chamber near the changing room probably contained the latrines. The hammam was entered from a gate at its west corner. The changing room consisted of a central square space flanked by two small rectangular galleries divided from it by a row of arches supported by columns. This room was probably the most decorated space in the building, though no decoration has been preserved today. The central square space was probably covered by an ornate wooden vault ceiling while the galleries were covered by groin vaults. The cold room and hot room are both roofed by groin vaults, while the warm room between them is larger and is roofed by two cloister vaults.

Shrines of Sufi mystics
Several shrines dedicated to Sufi mystics are present in the necropolis as well, towards the southern part of the area. These shrines were built at a later date, and appear to be grouped together. One of such buildings is a shrine containing the tomb of Sidi Yahya ibn Yunus, a mystic believed to have lived in the 7th century.

Archeological artifacts
The Museum of History and Civilizations in Rabat houses some Roman-era artifacts from Sala Colonia. The museum also holds several Marinid-period pieces from the necropolis. One of these is the tombstone of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, a rectangular marble slab which was a spolia from Roman-era Hispania Baetica, as seen in the Roman inscription on the back side which mentions a Roman governor of that province named Aulus Caecina Tacitus from the second half of the 3rd century AD. The stone was initially reused for an Umayyad fountain in Cordoba, probably in the late 10th or early 11th century, before it was apparently moved to North Africa and eventually reused by the Marinids, who carved the other side of it with the sultan's funerary inscription. The same museum also holds the tombstones of Abu al-Hasan and his wife Shams al-Ḍuḥa. These tombstones were maqabriyyas: marble tombstones shaped approximately like a triangular prism and laid horizontally over the grave. Both are richly carved with elaborate Arabic inscriptions that record their names, titles, and the details of their burials. A number of Marinid-period marble capitals are also housed at the museum.

Music venue
Since 2005, the ruins of Chellah host an international "Festival of Jazz" each year, called Jazz au Chellah. Additionally, it is currently home to a venue of the annual Mawazine music festival in Rabat, which showcases popular contemporary music from around the world.

Le Chellah, (en arabe : شالة ; en amazighe : ⵛⵍⵍⴰⵀ - Cellah), est le site d'une nécropole mérinide située sur l'emplacement d'une cité antique, dans l'actuelle ville de Rabat, au Maroc, à environ 200 m du rempart almohade.
Depuis 2005, ce site archéologique accueille chaque année le festival Jazz au Chellah, et depuis 2012, fait partie de l'ensemble des sites de Rabat inscrits sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco en tant que bien culturel.
Après d'importants travaux de restauration, le site du Chellah a été rouvert au public le 20 mai 2024 et propose un nouveau circuit de visite audioguidée.

Histoire et description
Le site du Chellah fut sans doute la plus ancienne agglomération humaine à l'embouchure du Bou Regreg. Les Phéniciens et les Carthaginois, qui ont fondé plusieurs comptoirs au Maroc, ont probablement habité les bords du Bouregreg.
(Jacobelly 2008)
Le Chellah conserve, en revanche, les vestiges d'une ville romaine. Les fouilles ont révélé la présence d'une agglomération d'une certaine importance ; celle de la ville citée sous les noms de Sala, par Ptolémée, et de Sala Colonia, dans l'itinéraire d'Antonin. Les restes du Decumanus Maximus, ou voie principale, ont été dégagés ainsi que ceux d'un forum, d'une fontaine monumentale, d'un arc de triomphe, d'une basilique chrétienne, etc. La voie principale de Sala a été suivie par des sondages exécutés en direction du port antique sur le Bouregreg, port aujourd'hui ensablé. Ainsi, la ville romaine dépassait l'enceinte mérinide en direction du fleuve. 
Au Moyen Âge, la ville était sous contrôle des Idrissides, puis elle est prise par Moussa ibn abi Affia en 929. En 993, les Maghraouides la prennent.  
Chellah devient capitale des Ifrenides, au début du XIe siècle, durant les conflits Ifrenides et Maghraouides de Fès au XIe siècle, et elle fut une de leurs métropoles jusqu'à l'arrivée des Almoravides. 
Le Chellah était abandonné depuis 1154, jusqu'à ce que les Mérinides  choisissent son site pour y édifier leur nécropole. Comme l'indique l'inscription en écriture coufique, qui surmonte la porte d'entrée, les travaux ont été achevés en 1339, sous le règne d'Abû al-Hassan `Alî. L'occupation du site a été progressive, et les aménagements successifs ont abouti à la réalisation d'une somptueuse nécropole.
Protégée par une enceinte importante à laquelle on accède par trois portes (la porte principale dite Porte de Sidi Yahia, la Porte des Jardins et la Porte de la Source du Paradis), la nécropole mérinide contient notamment une salle d'ablutions, une zaouïa avec un oratoire, un minaret paré de zellige et plusieurs salles funéraires, telle celle d'Aboul Hassan dont la stèle, finement décorée, repose sous un auvent à mouqanas. Plus tard, Abû `Inân Fâris, son fils, affecta, pour l'entretenir, les revenus d'un bain mérinide de Rabat, le hammâm Ej-Jdîd.
La porte de la nécropole est une porte majestueuse et guerrière. Puissante, elle est flanquée de deux bastions semi-octogonaux avec des encorbellements surmontés de merlons pointus. Cette porte de forteresse ouvre sur une petite oasis, un havre de paix d'une dizaine d'hectares où la tranquillité des lieux est interrompue de temps à autre par le claquement de bec des cigognes. Paysage clos et enchanteur, jardin à l'atmosphère magique où le sanctuaire du fondateur est au creux d'un vallon dans lequel serpente la source d'Aïn Mdafa.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Kasbah of the Udayas (Arabic: قصبة الأوداية, romanized: Qaṣbat al-Awdāya), also spelled Kasbah of the Oudaias or of the Oudayas, is a kasbah (citadel) in Rabat, Morocco. It is located on a hill at the mouth of the Bou Regreg opposite Salé, and adjacent to the Medina quarter of Rabat. It is listed, along with other sites in Rabat, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Name
The kasbah takes its name from the Udaya tribe. This name only became associated with the kasbah in the 19th century after the tribe was permanently expelled from Fez. A fraction of the tribe settled in the then previously almost uninhabited kasbah. The use of al-Widaya (الوداية) instead of al-Awdāya has become popular in Morocco.

History
In the 10th century the Umayyads of Cordoba, or their Zenata Berber allies in the region, founded a ribat or fortified monastery/outpost in this area, to defend against the Barghawata Berbers, who had established a Kharijite state to the south. This ribat was most likely on the same site as the current Kasbah of the Udayas, but its location has not been confirmed by historians. One of the last Almoravid emirs, Tashfin ibn Ali (ruled 1143-45) built a new ribat on the site of the current kasbah during his efforts to repel the Almohad Caliphate, but the Almohads defeated the Almoravids and destroyed the ribat.
In 1150 or 1151 the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min built a new kasbah (citadel) over the site of the former ribat, within which he included a palace and a mosque. He also had an underground canal dug to divert a water source to the area, allowing for future settlement and urbanization. The later caliph Yaqub al-Mansur (ruled 1184–1199) embarked on a huge project to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called al-Mahdiyya or Ribat al-Fath, on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the old kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque (the remains of which include the Hassan Tower) and of new grand gateways including Bab er-Rouah, a major gate in the city's western wall, and what is now called Bab Udaya or Bab al-Kbir, the gate of the Kasbah. After Abu Yusuf Ya'qub's death in 1199 the mosque and the capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The kasbah itself became essentially abandoned. Meanwhile, the town of Salé across the river, grew in importance and was developed during the Marinid era.

In 1609, Philip III decreed the expulsion of all Moriscos (people of Muslim or Moorish descent) from Spain. About 2000 of these refugees, originally from the town of Hornachos near Badajoz, Spain, settled around Salé and occupied the kasbah, attracting between 5000 and 14,000 other Moriscos to join them. They established their own autonomous republic, referred as the Republic of Salé (or Republic of Bou Regreg), which served as a base for corsairs: pirates, also known as the "Salé Rovers", who preyed on merchant ships around the shores of Western Europe and generally sold the crews into slavery. 
During this time (early 17th century) they built a broad platform on the kasbah's northeastern edge, overlooking the river, which was used for semaphore signalling. A warehouse structure was later added on it during the 18th century, used today as a school and a carpet workshop. Below the platform, to the North, was a sqala, a seaside fortification and artillery platform, while just 25 meters upriver from this, to the East, was the "Tower of the Corsairs", also added in the 18th century. This was a round tower with openings for 4 canons aimed at the river. The tower rose only 3 meters above the water and was hidden from view behind the sqala, thus allowing its canons to catch pursuing enemy ships by surprise. The Republic of Salé remained outside the control of the central government until 1666, when the 'Alawi sultan Moulay Rashid took over the area and placed the corsairs under his authority.
The southwestern section of the Kasbah today was added during the Alaouite period, especially in the 18th century. It includes a palace or royal pavilion built by Sultan Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672–1727) at the end of the 17th century and serving today as a museum. Moulay Ismail was also responsible for settling a part of the Udayas (or Oudayas), a guich tribe ("Army" tribe serving in the sultan's military), in the kasbah to serve as a counterbalancing force against other unruly tribes in the region. However, the name "Udaya" only became associated with the kasbah in the 19th century, after the tribe was permanently expelled from the region of Fez by the Alaouite sultan Abd ar-Rahman and their remaining members settling in the kasbah.
A restoration of the Kasbah of the Udayas was initiated in 1914 under the French Protectorate. The work was led by Maurice Tranchant with the assistance of local master craftsmen, including Hadj Driss Tourouguy. The Kasbah, along with other historic sites in Rabat, was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 20, 2006, in the cultural category. It was granted World Heritage Status in 2012.

Major structures and monuments
The upper or northern part of the kasbah, above the museum, dates mostly from its foundation/reconstruction in the Almohad period under Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century, while the lower parts date from the 18th century during the Alaouite period. The northern part of the kasbah is centered around the Street of the Mosque (Rue Jamaa), which runs between the Bab Oudaia gate and the semaphore platform, passing by the kasbah's Old Mosque. The southern part is taken up to a large extent by the Andalusian Gardens, the Oudayas Museum, and a nearby café and terrace known as Café Maure.

Great Gate of the Kasbah (Bab Oudaya)
The monumental gate of the kasbah, located uphill and overlooking Rabat below, is considered one of the most beautiful gates of Almohad and Moroccan architecture. It goes by the name Bab Oudaia ("Udaya Gate") or Bab al-Kbir ("Great Gate"). It was built by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur between 1195 and 1199, inserted into the previous walls of the kasbah built by Abd al-Mu'min around 1150. It has both an outer facade (facing southeast towards the city) and an inner facade (facing northeast onto the Street of the Mosque), both richly decorated. The massive gate was largely ceremonial and had little defensive value, given its position already inside the city walls; unlike Bab er-Rouah, the ornate western gate in Rabat's city walls, built around the same time, it was not flanked by true defensive towers.
The carved decoration around the horseshoe arch entrance features a curved band of interlacing geometric forms (specifically, a pattern known as darj wa ktaf, commonly seen in Moroccan architecture), set inside a rectangular frame outlined by a Qur'anic inscription frieze in Kufic Arabic script. In the corners between this curved band and the inscription are carved arabesque or floral patterns with a palmette or scallop shell at their middle, and above these is another carved frieze of palmettes. At both corners of the horseshoe arch (at the bottom of the curved band of geometric carvings) are serpentine "S"-like forms, probably representing eels, which are a very rare motif in Almohad or Moroccan architecture. The external facade of the inner gate, facing towards the kasbah, has carved decoration very similar to that of the outer gate, but with minor differences in the choice of geometric forms. Inside, the gate has three chambers which form a bent passage.

The Old Mosque (Mosque of the Kasbah)
The oldest current structure at the site of the Kasbah is its main mosque, the Jama' al-'Atiqa ("Old Mosque"). Dating from Abd al-Mu'min's construction in 1150, it was largely restored in the 18th century, during the reign of Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah, by an English corsair known as Ahmed el-Inglizi. The minaret dates from this later restoration.
The mosque measures about 26.5 by 25 metres but its outline is partly irregular due to modifications over the centuries. Its exterior is mainly made of stone while the arches of the interior are made in brick. Like many medieval western Islamic mosques, its qibla (direction of prayer) is not aligned with the true direction of Mecca but faces mostly south, following an older tradition based on a hadith. The mosque can be entered via four horseshoe arch doorways. Inside is a rectangular courtyard (sahn) surrounded by galleries on three sides and by the prayer hall to the south/southeast. The layout of the prayer hall follows the typical "T"-plan of medieval Moroccan mosques: it is split by rows of arches into seven "naves" running perpendicular to the qibla wall, of which the central one is wider than the others and is aligned with the mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer). The walls and arches of the mosque's interior are painted white, with the lower walls decorated with Moroccan tilework while the upper walls and the spandrels of the arches are decorated with carved stucco. The mihrab is the most richly decorated feature, again featuring ornate patterns in carved stucco. This decoration, however, is of recent date.
One unusual feature of the mosque's layout is the fact that the minaret stood separate from the rest of the mosque and behind the qibla (southeastern) wall, and was only connected to the mosque in 1940. The minaret is made of stone and has a square shaft measuring about 4.55 meters to one side. It is modestly decorated with blind arches on its facades.

Pavilion of Moulay Ismail (National Jewellery Museum)
The southern part of the kasbah includes a former pavilion or palace residence built by Sultan Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672–1727) at the end of the 17th century. The building is centered around a main courtyard and is distinguished on the outside by a tower. For a while, the palace also served as a madrasa. In 1915, during the French Protectorate over Morocco, the building was converted into a museum on the initiative of Prosper Ricard, director of the Service des Arts Indigènes under Lyautey. It became an ethnographic museum with a collection initially made up of donations from Prosper Ricard himself, Alfred Bel, and Jean Besancenot. The museum's collection expanded to include jewellery, musical instruments, ceramics, Qur'ans and manuscripts (some as old as the 12th century), costumes, silks, and carpets, from different parts of the country. In 2006, following a restoration, it became the National Jewellery Museum, devoted to the history of Moroccan jewellery, along with some other objects. In 2014, the museum was closed for long-term refurbishments by the National Foundation of Museums. It reopened in January 2023.

Andalusian Garden
The "Andalusian Garden" next to the museum was created between 1915 and 1918, during the French protectorate in Morocco, under Maurice Tranchant De Lunel. It is a formal garden inspired by the Moorish gardens of al-Andalus (Andalucia) and features a variety of trees and plants such as bougainvillea and citrus trees. It is frequented by tourists and locals.

Current status
Today, the Kasbah remains a popular free tourist attraction within Rabat, offering scenic views of the waterfront of Rabat, the Bou Regreg river, neighboring Salé, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is mostly occupied as a residential neighborhood, known for its distinct blue and white walls. An unoccupied site adjacent to the Kasbah is used as one of the concert venues for the annual Mawazine music festival in Rabat.

قصبة الأوداية أو قصبة لوداية هي قصبة تاريخية، حي سكني وموقع سياحي في الرباط، المغرب، على الضفة الجنوبية لنهر بورقراق.
وتعد قصبة لوداية من أجمل الأماكن السياحية في مدينة الرباط، حيث يتوافد عدد كبير من السياح المغاربة والأجانب لزيارة هذا الموقع الأثري الرائع لكونه يتميز بإطلالته الجميلة على وادي أبي رقراق وشاطئ المحيط الأطلسي.

تاريخ
كانت قصبة الوداية في الأصل قلعة محصنة، تم تشييدها من طرف المرابطين لمحاربة قبائل برغواطية، في عهد يوسف بن تاشفين،. ازدادت أهميتها في عهد الموحدين، الذين جعلوا منها رباطا على مصب نهر أبي رقراق، وأطلقوا عليها اسم المهدية. بعد الموحدين أصبحت مهملة إلى أن استوطنها الموريسكيون الحرناشيون، الذين طردوا من الأندلس في مطلع القرن السابع عشر، فأعادوا إليها الحياة بتدعيمها بأسوار محصنة. بين 1627 و1668، كانت قصبة الأوداية عاصمة للكيان السياسي، الذي عرف بجمهورية بورقراق، و الذي اعتمد على القرصنة البحرية.
وفي عهد العلويين عرفت قصبة الأوداية عدة تغييرات وإصلاحات ما بين سنة (1757-1789)، وكذلك ما بين سنة (1790 و 1792)، من بينها ترميم برج الصراط على يد المهندس المعماري أحمد الإنجليزي. وقد عرف هذا الموقع تاريخا متنوعا ومتميزا، يتجلى خصوصا في المباني التي تتكون منها قصبة الأوداية فسورها الموحدي وبابها الأثري (الباب الكبير) يعتبران من رموز الفن المعماري الموحدي بالإضافة إلى مسجدها المعروف بالجامع العتيق، أما المنشآت العلوية فتتجلى في الأسوار الرشيدية، والقصر الأميري الذي يقع غربا وكذلك منشئتها العسكرية برج صقالة

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tinmal Mosque or Great Mosque of Tinmal (also spelled Tinmel or Tin Mal; Tachelhit: ⵜⵉⵎⵣⴳⵉⴷ ⵏ ⵜⵉⵏⵎⵍ; Arabic: مسجد تنمل) is a 12th-century mosque located in the village of Tinmel in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Although no longer operating as a mosque today, its remains are preserved as a historic site. It was built at the site where Ibn Tumart, the founder of the Almohad movement, was buried and it is considered an important example of Almohad architecture. 
The mosque was added to the Tentative List of potential UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1995. It suffered significant damage during the 2023 Marrakesh–Safi earthquake.

History
Tinmel is located along the important High Atlas mountain pass known as Tizi-n-Test between Marrakesh to the north and the Sous region to the south. It was the first capital of the Almohad movement founded by Ibn Tumart. He established his followers here in 1124 or 1125 CE and it became the base from which they launched attacks on the Almoravids who ruled the region at the time. A first mosque was built here around this time or shortly after. 
When Ibn Tumart died in 1130 he was buried here and a religious sanctuary and pilgrimage site subsequently developed at the site of his tomb. Abd al-Mu'min, who took over leadership of the Almohads after him, decided to build a new mosque nearby or on the same site in 1148, as confirmed by historical documents of the time – although the foundation date of 1153-1154 CE (548 AH) given by the Rawd al-Qirtas is still cited by many. The new mosque most likely replaced the existing mosque of Tinmel that was present here. Construction of the mosque thus began very soon after the conquest of Marrakesh (1147) and the beginning of construction on the Kutubiyya Mosque there. The Tinmal Mosque's architecture demonstrates many similarities with the Kutubiyya and was likely designed and built by craftsmen from Marrakesh. The mosque was smaller in scale than other major Almohad mosques as it was designed for a small town, but it was nonetheless a pilgrimage site and subsequent Almohad rulers were buried near here as well. Later, as the Marinids wrested control of Morocco from them, the Almohads of Marrakesh made a final stand in Tinmel until their last leaders were defeated and captured here in 1275.
The mosque eventually fell into ruin and was partly restored in the mid-20th century. Further restoration works were undertaken in the 1990s. The mosque no longer operates as a religious building but was opened to visitors as a historic site, making it one of the few mosque buildings in Morocco open to non-Muslims. The site has been on UNESCO's Tentative List of World Heritage Sites since 1995. 
As of January 2023, work was underway on a new restoration of the mosque overseen by the Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs, projected to last 18 months. The plan also called for the eventual construction of a museum next to the mosque.

2023 earthquake
The mosque was severely damaged in a major earthquake in September 2023. Parts of the minaret tower and some walls appeared to have collapsed. The Moroccan Culture Ministry responded by stating that the mosque would be restored, while UNESCO indicated it would send a team to evaluate the damage. Prior to the earthquake, the renovation of the mosque was in its final stage. An early assessment in October 2023 estimated that 75% of the building was destroyed, although more complete destruction was avoided because the terrace on which the mosque stands did not collapse. The building was not yet safe enough to enter for a full evaluation. The extent of damage to the historic mihrab was not yet known as it was obscured by the debris of the collapsed roof in front of it.
In November 2023, Moroccan news outlet Médias24 published an article criticizing the clearance of debris from the mosque, alleging it was being done without proper supervision from archeologists and that historical fragments were potentially being lost in the process. A subsequent article by Le Desk, another Moroccan news outlet, has challenged this allegation, quoting Aboulkacem Chebri, president of the Moroccan branch of ICOMOS, who states that historical fragments from the site were being collected and stored appropriately, including those that could be potentially be reused during reconstruction.
In May 2024 it was reported that the restoration of the mosque will be aided by the Italian Ministry of Culture, at the request of the Moroccan government's Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs. The Italian architect Aldo Giorgio Pezzi has been sent to assist in the project.

Architecture
Exterior
The building has a fortress-like exterior appearance with thick plain walls, which was characteristic of other Almohad mosques and buildings as well. It has a roughly quadrangular floor plan measuring 43 by 40 metres. A more unusual feature was the position and form of the minaret, located at the middle of its southern wall on top of the mihrab; a design feature which is not found in other historic mosques. The minaret has a rectangular base and projects outwards from the surrounding outer wall, but has a truncated or unfinished appearance, contrasting with the bold and monumental minarets of other Almohad mosques that came after (such the minaret of the Kutubiyya or the Giralda in Seville). The mosque has seven entrances: three on both its east and west sides and one central entrance to the north.

Interior
Inside, the mosque has a typical hypostyle layout with an interior courtyard. The main prayer hall is divided into nine "naves" (running roughly north to south) by rows of pointed horseshoe arches. Another aisle, perpendicular to these rows of arches (running roughly east to west), runs along the southern wall (the qibla wall towards which worshippers prayed). The mosque is a notable example of the "T-plan" or "T-type" mosque which is found in earlier Almoravid architecture and was standard for later medieval Moroccan mosques: the aisle running parallel to the qibla wall and the middle nave leading to the mihrab, running perpendicular to that wall, are wider and more prominent than the other aisles of the mosque and thus draw a "T" shape in the floor plan of the building. 
The southern aisle of the qibla wall also features three muqarnas ("honeycomb" or "stalactite") cupolas: one at the middle, in front of the mihrab, and one at either end, at the southern corners of the mosque. Each cupola is also flanked by "lambrequin" or "muqarnas" arches below, whose intrados are enhanced with carved sebka, muqarnas, and palmette/seashell motifs. Multifoil and lambrequin arches also run along the northern edge of this aisle, further setting it apart from the rest of the mosque. All these decorative flourishes also served to emphasize the southern aisle and middle nave in the T-plan of the mosque. 

The rectangular courtyard (sahn) of the mosque occupies a large part of its northern section, corresponding to the width of the mosque's five middle naves and the length of three transversal aisles. It is surrounded on all sides by the arches of the prayer hall and its extensions.

The mihrab
The mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla), situated in the middle of the southern wall, is similar in form and decoration to that of the Kutubiyya Mosque and other Almohad mosques, consisting of a small octagonal room covered by a muqarnas cupola. This overall form inherits the tradition of the 10th-century mihrab of the Great Mosque of Cordoba, which also consisted of a small octagonal room. The wall surrounding the mihrab's opening is decorated with carved geometric and interlacing motifs in stucco. The tradition of a mihrab composed of a Unlike the Kutubiyya Mosque, the decorative capitals of the engaged columns around the mihrab are carved from stucco rather than marble. On either side of the mihrab are two tall arched openings: one led to a small chamber where the minbar (pulpit) was stored, while the other led to the imam's entrance at the eastern base of the minaret.

The Todgha Gorges (Berber languages: ⵜⵉⵣⵉ ⵏ ⵜⵓⴷⵖⴰ; Arabic: مضيق تودغا‌) are a series of limestone river canyons, or wadi, in the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco, near the town of Tinerhir. Both the Todgha (or Todra) River and the neighbouring Dadès River are responsible for carving out these deep cliff-sided canyons, on their final 40 kilometres (25 mi) through the mountains. The height of the canyon walls can vary, but in some places can be up to 400 metres (1,312 ft) high.

Description

The last 600 metres (1,969 ft) of the Todgha gorge are the most spectacular. Here the canyon narrows to a flat stony track, in places as little as 10 metres (33 ft) wide, with sheer and smooth rock walls up to 160 metres (525 ft) high on each side.
During the dry season, the canyon floor is mostly dry; at most there will be a small stream of water. During this time, the wadi floor is easily traversed by travelers. During the rainy season, however, the Todra can expand massively, covering the canyon floor in a strong torrent.

## Overview
The High Atlas is a region in Morocco covering the mountain range and surrounding destinations such as Marrakech. It's a regular destination for mountain hikers, ski enthusiasts, or travellers interested in the indigenous Berber culture found throughout its many peaks and valleys.

## Understand
Berbers are the indigenous North Africans, having inhabited the north coast of Africa ranging from present day Morocco to Egypt, for at least 5,000 years.
The Arab invasion of North Africa in the 7th century forced Berbers to assimilate, or take refuge in the Atlas mountains.
It is said that as much as 80% of the Moroccan population is racially Berber, however only half of those people live culturally Berber lifestyles.
Berbers have adopted Islam as their primary religion, but continue to speak Berber languages in their villages, and practice Berber music, spirituality, and art.
The Atlas mountains are home to relatively pure Berber populations, who live in earthen adobe houses. Marrakech is the only Moroccan city with a recognizable Berber ambiance, being situated at the base of the southern Atlas mountains. The color of Marrakech is the color of the Berbers - reddish, ochre and earth tones are the only colors you see adorning the adobe buildings, giving the impression that the entire city springs from the earth.

## Towns and cities

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moulay Idriss, Moulay Driss Zerhoun or simply Zerhoun (Arabic: مولاي إدريس زرهون) is a town in the Fès-Meknès region of northern Morocco, spread over two hills at the base of Mount Zerhoun. It is famous for being the site of the tomb of Idris I, the first ruler of the Idrisid dynasty, after whom the town is named. It is located near Meknes and overlooks the ruins of Volubilis a few kilometers away.

History
Idris I (known as Moulay Idris) was a descendant of Muhammad who fled from Abbasid-controlled territory after the Battle of Fakh because he had supported the defeated pro-Shi'a rebels. He established himself at Oualili (Volubilis), a formerly Roman town which by then was mostly inhabited by Berbers and a small population of Judeo-Christian heritage. He used his prestige as a descendant of Muhammad to forge an alliance with local Berber tribes (in particular the Awraba) in 789 and quickly became the most important religious and political leader in the region. As the old site of Roman Volubilis was located on an open plain and considered vulnerable, the settlement moved up a few kilometers towards the mountains, presumably around the site of the current town of Moulay Idriss, leaving the old Roman ruins abandoned.
Idris I died soon after in 791, possibly poisoned on the order of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, just before his son Idris (II) was born. Once Idris II came of age and officially took over his position as ruler in 803, he continued his father's endeavors and significantly expanded the authority of the new Idrisid state. As a result, the Idrisid dynasty was of central importance to the early Islamization of Morocco, forming the first true "Islamic" state to consolidate power over much of its territory. They also founded the important city of Fes, about 50 kilometres away, which became the Idrisid capital under Idris II.
The early history of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun (sometimes called simply Moulay Idriss) as a town is not widely discussed by historians. A mausoleum for Idris I presumably existed on this site, overlooking Volubilis/Oualili, since his death. The tomb was probably placed inside a qubba (general term for a domed building or structure), and the name Oualili was eventually replaced by the name Moulay Idriss. Some anti-Idrisid rulers in 10th-century Fes claimed that Idris II was also buried here (instead of in his alleged tomb in Fes itself), though he is widely believed to be buried in Fes, where his mausoleum and mosque is still a site of major importance today.
Although the town became a site of pilgrimage early on, after Idris II it was quickly overshadowed by Fes, which became the most important city of the region. The popularity of Idris I and his son as Muslim "saints" and figures of national importance was not constant throughout Morocco's history, with their status declining significantly after the end of Idrisid influence in the 10th century. The Almoravids, the next major dynasty after them, were hostile to the cult of saints and other practices judged less orthodox under their stricter views of Islam. It was only during the Marinid period, from the 14th century onward, that the Idrisid founders became celebrated again and that their religious importance redeveloped. An early sign of this was the alleged rediscovery of Idris I's remains in 1318, at Moulay Idris Zerhoun, which apparently caused something of a sensation among the local population and attracted attention from the Marinid authorities. During this time, the annual moussem (religious festival) in August, celebrating Moulay Idris I, was instituted and began to take shape.
The mausoleum itself apparently remained little changed for many centuries. Under the sharifian dynasties of Morocco, the Saadians and (especially) the Alaouites, who also claimed descent from Muhammad, the status of Idris I and II as foundational figures in Moroccan history was further elevated in order to enhance the new dynasties' own legitimacy. Moulay Ismail, the powerful and long-reigning Alaouite sultan between 1672 and 1727, ordered the existing mausoleum to be demolished and rebuilt on a grander scale. Adjoining properties were purchased for the purpose. Construction lasted from 1719 to 1721. Once finished, Moulay Ismail ordered that the khutba (Friday sermon) be performed regularly in the mausoleum's mosque, which established it as the main Friday mosque of the city. In 1822, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Abderrahman (Abd al-Rahman), purchased another property adjoining the mausoleum in order to rebuild the mosque on an even bigger and more lavish scale. Under Sultan Sidi Mohammed (Mohammed IV; ruled 1859–1873), some expert ceramic tilework decoration was added by the Meknesi artisan Ibn Makhlouf.
Following Moroccan independence in 1956, the mausoleum was redecorated and the mosque expanded yet again by King Mohammed V and his son Hassan II. To this day, Idris's tomb is a pilgrimage site and the center of a popular moussem (religious festival) every August. The gold-embroidered covering over his tomb is replaced regularly every one or two years during its own ritual attended by religious and political figures. Due to its status as a holy city and sanctuary, the town was off-limits to non-Muslims until 1912, and non-Muslims were not able to stay overnight until 2005.
Since 1995, Moulay Idriss Zerhoun has been on UNESCO's Tentative list of World Heritage Sites.

Geography
The town is currently in the Fès-Meknès region. From 1997 to 2015 it was in Meknès-Tafilalet. The ruins of the Berber and Roman city of Volubilis are located just five kilometers away. Idris I took many materials from here in order to build his town. Further away are the cities of Meknes (about 28 km away by road) and Fez (about 50 km away).
The town is located on two adjacent foothills of the Zerhoun mountains, the Khiber and the Tasga, which form the town's two main districts. Between these is the mausoleum and religious complex of Moulay Idris. The Khiber is the taller of the two hills and its summit offers views over the religious complex and the rest of town. The Sentissi Mosque and the Mausoleum-mosque of Sidi Abdallah el Hajjam are also located near the top of the Khiber hill.

Notable sites and landmarks
Zawiya of Moulay Idris I
The zawiya (a religious complex including a mausoleum, mosque, and other amenities; also spelled zaouia) of Moulay Idris is located at the center of town, with its entrance just off the main town square. It is reached then reached via a long passage that leads to the main building. This includes the mausoleum chamber, recognizable from afar by its huge green-tiled pyramidal roof, and a mosque area. It also has a tall minaret with a square shaft, typical of Moroccan architecture. The decoration is rich and dates from the Alaouite period, including from the 20th century. The zawiya is off limits to non-Muslims.

Cylindrical Minaret
The Sentissi Mosque was built in 1939 by a local man after his return from the hajj in Mecca. It allegedly has the only cylindrical minaret in Morocco. The minaret is covered in a background of green tiles with white Kufic-style Arabic letters spelling out a surah from the Qur'an. The mosque is now a Qur'anic school (madrasa), and is also referred to as the Medrasa Idrissi.

Moulay Driss Zerhoun (en arabe : sمولاي ادريس زرهون), ou  Zerhoun , est une ville de la région de Fès-Meknès, dans le nord du Maroc. Elle s'étend sur deux collines à la base du mont Zerhoun. Elle est célèbre pour être le site du tombeau d'Idris Ier, le premier souverain de la dynastie idrisside, dont la ville tire son nom. Elle est située près de Meknès et surplombe les ruines de Volubilis, à quelques kilomètres de là.

Localisation et origine
La ville est située au centre du massif du Zerhoun, à 4 km de l'ancienne cité romaine de Volubiilis, à 30 km au nord de Meknès et à une soixantaine de km à l'ouest de Fès. 
Elle s'est développée autour du tombeau d'Idrîs Ier, arrière-petit-fils de Hassan ben Ali, fondateur de la dynastie des Idrissides, mort empoisonné sur les ordres de Hâroun ar-Rachîd.  
Elle est toujours l'objet d'un pèlerinage fréquenté et d'un moussem (fête votive annuelle) particulièrement important.
Les deux quartiers principaux, Khiber et Tazga, occupent deux collines qui se font face. Dans le vallon qui les sépare se trouve le sanctuaire (qubba) de Moulay Idrîs. La mosquée Sentissi est reconnue pour son minaret cylindrique, le seul de son type au Maroc, couvert de tuiles vertes et de versets du Coran.
En 1995, le Maroc inscrit Moulay Driss Zerhoun dans la liste indicative du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.

Geographie
La ville se situe actuellement dans la région de Fès-Meknès. De 1997 à 2015, elle faisait partie de la région de Meknès-Tafilalet. Les ruines de la ville berbère et romaine de Volubilis se trouvent à seulement 5 kilomètres. Idrîs Ier a pris de nombreux matériaux ici pour construire sa ville. Plus loin se trouvent les villes de Meknès, à environ 28 km par la route, et de Fès, à environ 50 km de là.
La ville est située sur deux contreforts adjacents des montagnes de Zerhoun, le Khiber et la Tasga, qui forment les deux principaux quartiers de la ville. Entre ces deux collines se trouve le mausolée et le complexe religieux de Moulay Idris. Le Khiber est la colline la plus haute et son sommet offre une vue sur le complexe religieux et le reste de la ville. La mosquée Sentissi et le mausolée-mosquée de Sidi Abdallah el Hajjam se trouvent également près du sommet de la colline Khiber.

Démographie
En 1936, Moulay Driss Zerhoun comptait 8 000 habitants.
De 1994 à 2004, sa population est passée de 12 521 à 12 611 habitants, et en 2014, à 11 615 habitants.

Festivités
Moussem Beni Ammar de Zerhoun

Ifrane (Arabic: إفران) is a city in the Middle Atlas region of northern Morocco (population 13٫964 as of September 2024). The capital of Ifrane Province in the region of Fès-Meknès, Ifrane is located at an elevation of 1,665 m (5,463 ft). In the regional Tamazight language, "ifran" means caves.
The modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1928 during the protectorate era for their administration due to its Alpine climate. Ifrane was conceived as a "hill station" or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans could find relief from the summer heat of the interior plains of Morocco. Ifrane, the house of Lake Dayet Iffer is also a popular altitude training destination.
The first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when the Sharif Sîdî 'Abd al-Salâm established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. Ifrane is a colonial "hill station", and a "garden city". It is also an "imperial city", a mountain resort, a provincial administrative center, and a college town.

History
The first permanent settlement of the area dates to the 16th century, when a sharîf by the name of Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm established his community in the Tizguit Valley, seven km downstream from the present town. In the Local Amazigh language, Ifran means "caves". Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm’s village, called Zaouiat Sidi Abdeslam (or simply the zâwiyah), consisted at first of cave dwellings hollowed out of the limestone valley wall. Only in the last fifty years or so have its inhabitants built houses aboveground. The caves which now lie under these houses are still used as mangers for animals and for storage.
By the mid-17th century Sîdî ‘Abd al-Salâm’s zâwiyah was well enough established to
receive an extensive iqtâ’, or land grant, from the ‘Alâwî sultan Mûlây Rashîd b. Muhammad.
The iqtâ’ extended from upstream of present Ifrane down the Tizguit valley all the way to El Hajeb escarpment. Late in the 19th century agro-pastoral groups of the Amazigh Senhadja Beni M’guild and Zenata the Ait Seghrouchen, crossing the Middle Atlas from the upper Moulouya Plain, started grazing their herds of sheep and goats on the surrounding plateau. The livelihood of the zâwiyah was based on irrigated agriculture on the valley floor, livestock grazing and forest resources.
The agricultural plots were held as private property (mulk) but the grazing land was under collective tribal jurisdiction (j’maa). The tribally organized populations of the Ifrane-Azrou area submitted to colonial rule after a period of resistance (1913–1917). Resistance continued higher in the mountains (Timahdit, Jebel Fazzaz) until 1922.

Modern history
The modern town of Ifrane was established by the French administration in 1929 on land expropriated from the inhabitants of the zâwiya. The town was to be a "hill station", a cool place for colonial families to spend the hot summer months, and it was initially planned according to the "garden city" model of urban design then in vogue. The plan called for chalet-type summer homes in the Alpine style, laid out among gardens and curving tree-lined streets. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad V. The town's first public buildings consisted of a post office and a church. Moreover, a penitentiary was built which served as a POW camp during World War II.
As elsewhere in Morocco, a shanty town called Timdiqîn soon grew up next to the colonial establishment. It housed the Moroccan population (maids, gardeners, etc.) that serviced the French vacationers. Timdiqîn was separated from the colonial garden city by a deep ravine. After independence, the French properties in the original garden city were slowly bought up by Moroccans. The town was enlarged and endowed with a mosque, a municipal market and public housing estates. Furthermore, the shanty neighborhood of Timdiqîn was rebuilt with proper civic amenities.
In 1979 Ifrane became the seat of the administrative province of the same name and some government services were established. In 1995 Al Akhawayn University, an English-language, American-curriculum public university opened and this has helped re-launch Ifrane as a desirable destination for domestic tourism. Consequently, Ifrane continues to develop as both a summer and winter resort. Old chalets in the center of town are being demolished and replaced with condominium complexes, while vacation centers and gated housing estates are springing up on the outskirts.
The Middle Atlas Mountains consist mostly of a series of limestone plateaux. Not far from Ifrane in the Middle Atlas is Cèdre Gouraud Forest. These plateaux receive considerable precipitation—averaging about 1,100/1,200 ml/year in Ifrane—and are naturally wooded, with scrub oak forests alternating with cedar. The Middle Atlas lies in the center of Morocco and constitutes its natural water tower, as many of the country's most important river systems: the Moulouya, the Sebou, the Bou Regreg, and the Oum Rabia originate in it. Historically, however, despite its centrality, the Middle Atlas has been an "empty quarter". Though the area was regularly crossed by traders, and though the alpine summer pasture
was used by herders, the harsh climate and relatively poor soils long impeded permanent
human settlement. Today the Middle Atlas is still one of the least densely populated parts
of Morocco, even when compared to other mountainous regions such as the High Atlas and the Rif.
A small fort overlooking Oued Tizguit (now part of the palace precinct) had already been built during the period of military conquest in order to secure the Fez to Khenifra road across the mountains. The gently rolling landscape, with fresh springs and wildflowers, was judged to have potential as a summer resort for colon families from the Saïss Plain, Meknes and Fez. Fifty hectares of agricultural land upstream from the zâwiyah, in an area originally designated as Tourthit, or "garden", was expropriated for the project.
Ifrane was conceived as a "hill station" or colonial type of settlement. It is a resort town set high up in the mountains so that Europeans can find relief from the summer heat of tropical colonies. The British were the first to develop this type of resort in India, the best known of which is Simla in the Himalayas which served as their "summer capital". The French built similar hill stations in Indochina, such as Da Lat, established in 1921. Ifrane was not the only hill station to be built in Morocco. The French also built one in neighboring Imouzzer Marmoucha, as well as at Oukaïmeden in the High Atlas. Hill stations share some common characteristics. As they are intended for expatriate European families, and they are often designed in such a way as to remind their foreign inhabitants of their distant homelands. The architectural style adopted is imported from the mother country in order that the place look like "Little England" or "douce France". This is the case in Ifrane where various mountain styles such as "maison basque" "Jura" and "Savoy" were used. Moreover, trees and flowering plants were also imported from the European home country. This too was intended to heighten the appearance and feeling of home. In Ifrane, lilac trees, plane-trees (platanes), chestnut and horse-chestnut trees (marronniers and châtaigniers) and lime trees (tilleuls) were all imported for this purpose.

"Garden City"
Ifrane was planned according to the "garden city" model of urban design, fashionable in Western Europe between the two world wars. The concept of the garden city was developed in Britain as a model of social reform to solve the problems of 19th century industrial cities. By the 1920s however it had lost its social purpose to become an urban design type. Garden cities required low density housing consisting of fully detached or semi-detached single family homes surrounded by gardens.
In order to break with industrial-era grid plans, garden cities were always laid out with curving tree-lined streets. In fact, most garden cities were affluent suburbs, not true cities in their own right. They catered to the tastes of the upper middle classes who could afford to own a private automobile and property in the suburbs. They gave the illusion of county life, with village-type architecture, curvy streets and many trees, to people who in reality worked in big cities. Ifrane's initial garden city plan was designed in 1928 in Rabat by the Services Techniques of the Bureau de Contrôle des Municipalités, a division of the Direction des Affairs Politiques.
The 1928 plan – for the neighborhood known as Hay Riad today – had typical garden city features: curvy streets named for flora (Rue des lilas, Rue des tilleuls, etc.), and chalet-style houses. Houses could occupy only 40% of plots; the rest had to be planted as a garden. Moreover, large parts of the center of the town consisted of public gardens. Some of the original architecture can still be seen, especially in the neighborhood around the town hall and the Perce Neige Hotel. The summer homes built by the colons were designed by many of the same architects who built the European parts of Casablanca and Rabat. Whereas the European architecture in these big cities was innovative and intentionally modern, Ifrane's houses were built in traditional European styles and resembled those in the suburbs of contemporaneous French cities.
Ifrane's first public buildings were a post office and a Roman Catholic church. The church, consecrated in 1939, was designed by Paul Tournon (1881–1964), a recipient of the prestigious Prix de Rome who had also designed the Sacré Cœur Church in Casablanca. The resort function of the new town was consolidated with the building of a number of hotels. Ifrane's first flagship hotel was the Balima, which was demolished in the 1980s. The other main hotel was the Grand Hôtel, which has recently been refurbished. A royal palace was also built for Sultan Muhammad b.Yûsuf.
Ifrane is thus an "imperial" city in that it houses a palace and benefits from royal patronage. One final institution of Ifrane's early years worthy of mention is the penitentiary which no longer exists, and the site, across from the Police Academy and the new police Commissariat, has been redeveloped as a summer camp for the Ministry of Justice. The penitentiary served as a Prisoner of War camp during World War II. The popular story of the origin of Ifrane's lion sculpture involves an Italian inmate of this prison sculpting the lion out of an outcrop of limestone; however, this is not true as the lion dates from at least 1936 thus predating World War II.
The garden city hill station high in the Middle Atlas was always going to be an illusion of suburban middle-class France. Provisions were made for the housing and infrastructure of colonial home-owners, but not for the Moroccan maids, gardeners or guards who worked for them. Finding no housing in the official allotments, these people had to build their own houses some distance away, across a ravine north of the town. As elsewhere in Morocco at the time, a shantytown thus grew up next to the colonial town. This is the origin of Timdiqin (officially called Hay Atlas).

Climate
Located in the Atlas Mountains, and affected by the cold Canary current, Ifrane has a continental-influenced hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) with short, somewhat dry, warm summers and long, cool, damp winters. The nights can be severely cold in winter.
Because of its elevation, the town experiences snow during the winter months and a cooler climate during the summer (not as hot as in the nearby regions which lie at a lower altitude).
Owing to the city's elevation and proximity to the north Atlantic Ocean, rainfall is very heavy whenever frontal systems affect the region. Precipitation patterns follow the classic Mediterranean range, from October to April. The city also receives high snowfall starting as early as October and lasting well into spring season. The annual average temperature does not exceed 11 °C (52 °F).
Ifrane holds the record for the lowest temperature ever observed in Africa and the Arab world: −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on February 11, 1935.

Flora and fauna
Ifrane's biodiversity is unique. Its fauna and flora contain rare yet mostly endangered species. Animals to be found in the vicinity include the threatened Barbary macaque. Among the local tree species are the native Atlas cedar, scrub oak and the introduced London plane.

Fauna
Mammalian species
The Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), an endangered monkey species that lives in its wild state in the forests of the Middle Atlas, including the forests surrounding Ifrane. Barbary macaques can be seen in the outskirts or the farther areas of the town of Ifrane when there is no more food in the woods, or simply because they have become familiar with humans.
The golden jackal (Canis aureus), referred to as ‘ich’ab’ in Tamazight, the same term used for ‘wolf’
The caracal (Caracal caracal), which is hard to spot, and survives thanks to its extreme discretion.
The common genet (Genetta genetta)

Bird species
The Atlas Coal Tit (Parus ater Atlas), an endemic passerine bird native to the Atlas mountains range.
The African crimson-winged finch (Rhodopechys alienus)
The white scavenger vulture (Neophron percnopterus)
Ifrane is also well known for its pisciculture (fish farming) stations. Ras el Ma forest has a trout-breeding station in which trout can be seen in their breeding basins. Moreover, Ifrane has a varied range of insects and amphibians.

Flora
Ifrane's plant and tree species include the following: 

The Atlas cedar (Cedrus Atlantica)
The holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia)
The Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea)
The maritime pine (Pinus pinaster ssp. Hamiltoni var. maghrebiana)
The Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera)
The laurel-leaf cistus (Cistus laurifolius)
Genista quadrifolia
Artemisia mesatlantica

Notable people
Mostafa Smaili, middle-distance runner.
Adil Jelloul, road bicycle racer.

Ifrane (en amazighe : ⵉⴼⵔⴰⵏ, Ifran ; en arabe : إفران) est une ville et commune urbaine du Maroc située dans le Moyen-Atlas, à 1 650 mètres d'altitude. Elle est le chef-lieu de la province d'Ifrane, dans la région administrative de Fès-Meknès, et compte une population de 15 553 habitants.
Ifrane est surnommée la petite Suisse en raison de son climat et de ses paysages enneigés et montagneux rappelant le pays neutre.

Toponymie et étymologie
En amazighe, ⵉⴼⵔⴰⵏ ifran signifie cachettes ou grottes (pluriel de ⵉⴼⵔⵉ ifri). La région est en effet connue pour ses grottes naturelles creusées dans la couche carbonatée jurassique sous forme de karts, et qui s'étendent jusqu'aux régions d'El Hajeb et de Sefrou. Ce sont elles qui ont donné leur nom à la ville. Par méconnaissance, on a associé à Ifrane le nom d’Oufrane, alors que ce dernier désigne une ville située dans l'Anti-Atlas marocain. Historiquement, l'ancien nom d'Ifrane est Tourtite Turtit, qui en amazighe signifie figueraie [1]. Le développement d'Ifrane et de sa région doit beaucoup aux potentialités naturelles, notamment au cèdre.

Histoire
Préhistoire
La présence humaine dans la région remonte au Néolithique comme en témoignent des grottes telles que celles de Tizguite ainsi que des vestiges archéologiques remontant à la Préhistoire, il y a 50 000 ans, la découverte de campements Atérien (culture caractéristique du paléolithique du Maghreb) par le groupe de chercheurs de l'Institut des sciences de l'archéologie et du patrimoine (INSAP) à Michlifen près d'Azrou à Ain Leuh (grotte d'ifri Ouberid), Zerouka, Ghabt, Al Bahr et Itto et à El Hajeb et les vestiges trouvés (ossements, objets...).

Période contemporaine
Ifrane sera habitée plus tard par une population issue des deux grandes tribus amazighes parlant le tamazight du Maroc, les Aït M’guild, les Aït M’tir et une partie des Aït Seghrouchen, tribus nomades qui se déplacent entre les pâturages verdoyants de Timahdite et Azrou jusqu'aux confins du pays Zayanes.
Vu sa situation géographique en altitude orientée plein nord qui rend ses paysages comparables à ceux de l'Europe, la création d'Ifrane est l'œuvre du secrétaire général du protectorat au Maroc, Eirik Labonne, en 1928. Trois dates sont à retenir :

Création d’un centre d'estivage pour les colons français : arrêté viziriel du 16 septembre 1929.
Création de la municipalité : le 14 janvier 1947.
Création de la province.
Le choix de la puissance coloniale s'inscrit dans trois cadres :

Exploitation des ressources naturelles ;
Création d’une « ville européenne » par compensation du dépaysement de la communauté française et européenne établie au Maroc, notamment en été (fraîcheur) : Maurice de Gandillac en est témoin ;
Disposer d’une base stratégique : la garnison de Timahdite constitue un atout stratégique militaire qui sert de liaison entre Taza et Tadla dont le but de faciliter les interventions militaires et cerner les tribus amazighes hostiles à la présence coloniale notamment la tribu des Zayanes sous la conduite de Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, Mouha ou Said d'Elkssiba et d'autres foyers insurrectionnels dans le Moyen et le Haut Atlas réputés pour leur hostilité envers les Iroumines (les chrétiens) et leur qualité de guerriers nourrie par leur attachement à la terre, surtout après la défaite de la France le 13 novembre en 1914 à Khénifra dans la bataille d'Elhri.
L'université Al Akhawayn d'Ifrane a été fondée par décret royal en 1993 et officiellement inaugurée par le roi Hassan II du Maroc le 16 janvier 1995. C'est actuellement la seule université marocaine suivant un système d'éducation américain et ayant plus de 40 % de personnel international[réf. nécessaire].

Géographie
Situation
Ifrane, ville du Moyen Atlas central, est caractérisée par son urbanisme européen. C'est le chef-lieu de la province d'Ifrane, dont la superficie est de 3 573 km² et qui est administrativement composée de deux municipalités (Ifrane et Azrou), cinq caïdats (Tizguit, Dait Aoua, Ain Leuh, Timahdit et Irklaouen) et huit communes rurales (Tizguite, Dait Aoua, Ain Leuh, Sidi El Mekhfi ou Sidi Addi, Timahdite, Ben Smim, Oued Ifrane et Tigrigra. Selon le nouveau découpage administratif, la province fait partie de la région de Fès-Meknès.

Climat
Ifrane bénéficie d'un climat très humide et continental (Dsb) avec une pluviométrie annuelle de 1 118,4 mm et une température moyenne annuelle de 11,4 °C.
Le versant nord des montagnes du Moyen-Atlas est en effet la région la plus arrosée du Maroc après la chaîne de montagnes du Rif. Les précipitations ont lieu essentiellement en hiver. Les montagnes du Moyen-Atlas se trouvent alors sur le trajet des perturbations en provenance de l'Atlantique.
À 1 665 m d'altitude, l'été à Ifrane est court mais toutefois agréablement chaud, sec et ensoleillé. La température maximale moyenne passe de 22 °C en juin à plus de 28 °C en juillet et août avant de rapidement repasser sous les 25 °C en septembre. 
En hiver, il neige beaucoup sur la ville. Ifrane détient officiellement le record de froid enregistré sur le continent africain avec une température de −23,9 °C le 11 février 1935.

Biodiversité
La région d'Ifrane constitue une aire géographique riche par sa biodiversité faunique et floristique, mais ses S.I.B (Sites d'intérêt biologique et écologique) et son parc national subissent une forte pression due à la dégradation de la forêt, au surpâturage et aux visiteurs non avertis qualifiés de pollueurs potentiels. Située dans le Moyen Atlas au Maroc, Ifrane est reconnue pour sa biodiversité exceptionnelle, abritant une grande variété d’écosystèmes, allant des forêts de cèdres de l’Atlas (Cedrus atlantica) aux prairies subalpines. La région est un habitat clé pour des espèces emblématiques comme le macaque de Barbarie (Macaca sylvanus), une espèce menacée, et de nombreux oiseaux migrateurs. Les cours d'eau, tels que les rivières et lacs de la région, jouent un rôle crucial dans le maintien des écosystèmes aquatiques. En outre, le Parc National d'Ifrane, créé en 2004, est une aire protégée essentielle pour la conservation de la flore et de la faune locales. Les efforts pour préserver cette biodiversité incluent la gestion des ressources naturelles et des initiatives pour limiter l'impact des activités humaines, telles que l'éco-tourisme et la sensibilisation environnementale.

Parc national d'Ifrane
Le Parc national d'Ifrane abrite notamment la plus grande forêt de cèdres du monde. Il englobe un ensemble de gîtes à caractère biodiversitaire (parc de Tizguite, Val d'Ifrane, les sources Vittel, Dait Aoua, Dait Hachlaf, Dait Ifrah et Afourgah).

## Overview
Ifrane is a city in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco.

## Understand
Ifrane is one of the most beautiful places in Morocco, residing on the Atlas mountain with a population of roughly 80,000 people. The projects of the current Moroccan king - like the university and huge new hotel - have had a large impact on the town.  It is not a large town with the majority of the population being farmers, sheepherders, etc, and living outside of the town borders.
The main language in Ifrane is Berber, but you can also hear a great deal of Arabic and French. It is home to Al-Akhawayn University, an American-style university taught in English, French, and Arabic. Nearly all university students will be able to converse fluently in English, but most of the native residents can not.
The climate is mostly cold with a beautiful mild summer, with a great deal of rain in the first few months of the year. The people are overall very friendly.
Overall, there is very little reason to specifically visit Ifrane if you have limited time in Morocco. Unless you're a student here or a member of the king's entourage when he visits, there's not a huge amount to visit here- a carved lion, some parks, funky roofs, lots of storks, outdoorsy things, and a Sunday souq pretty much summarize the town.

## Get in
Most of the buses comes from Fez and Meknes, which are the two major neighboring cities, or pass through on their route from Marrakesh to Fez.

## By grand taxi
The easiest way to get into Ifrane is by grand taxi from Fez or Meknes. Both cities are an hour away. Grand taxis in Fez leave near the Fez CTM station.
grand taxis. Grand taxis arrive in Ifrane at the grand taxi station, which is temporarily located about 300 m southwest of the marché.
A ride to either town costs 25 dirham, but can be more expensive (30 dirham) on weekends, when half of Fez and Meknes come there.
If you find yourself to take a whole taxi yourself, multiply the price by six places (i.e. 150 dirham).
At some times (very late/early, during strikes), you may have to pay a good bit more.

## By bus
CTM has an office at the east end of the marché and buses are likely to stop / depart from there. CTM buses are known to being cleaner and slightly quicker, but the sometimes sketchy buses from other companies are equally safe. They most likely depart from the new Gare Routière which is somewhere southwest from the marché. These buses can be a lot dirtier and a little cheaper. Some might have more stops (longer trip), but they also leaving more often and are thus easier to catch.

## Get around
Most places are within walking distance, but petit taxis are also readily available. The minimum fare is 5 dirham for small distances (e.g. marché → centre ville), longer distances will be 10 dirham.
Grand taxi drivers are a little more unscrupulous, so try to be aware of how much you should be paying for any given trip.

## See
Al Akhawayn University. Normally the campus is closed to non-students, but there are occasional events that allow visitors to see the campus. You can also request special permission from the faculty.
Centre-ville. The newer part of the city. Here, you can find the center for tourism, the iconic Lion statue that many tourists like to take pictures next to, the lake and park, and a number of restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores. Note that due to a prolonged drought, as of 2024, the lake (as well as most other water sources in the area) has unfortunately been bone dry for several years.
Marché. The marché or souq, open every day, is where the locals buy their supplies. Anything from books and electronics to meat and fruit can be bought here. There are also many restaurants of varying quality and price.
Source Vitel. A series of waterfalls, some of which are found inside the forests of Ifrane, others which you should take a taxi to. None are particularly impressive, but all are pretty. As of 2024, however, most are completely dry due to the drought, although there is a bit of water still flowing further north away from the town.
Barbary Macaques. A huge number of macaques live in the woods around the town, and if you're lucky, you can sometimes see them in the town itself. The southern edge of the town, near the marche, often has gangs of apes hanging around.

## Do
However, Ifrane's main attraction is its natural beauty. It is highly encouraged to hike in the area. You can easily rent a horse and guide for a few hours. It is also only a short distance from Ifrane to a place where you can find and feed wild monkeys.
- Foret Cedre Gourant: A good starting point for many trekking/hiking routes. You can go there by car and park in a touristic area where you can take some photos of monkeys and old trees, or rent a guide for excursions.

## Centre ville
L'Apelle. More high class than most restaurants in Ifrane. The only place that serves pastilla in the vicinity.
La Paix. mains around 80 dirham.
Forest. A new shiny restaurant.
Various cafes. All of the cafes are priced roughly the same, and have roughly the same quality of food. Normally a safe bet, though you can expect only the standard fare: pizza, tagine, harira, brochettes, etc.
My Lil Rome. A very small restaurant that sells delicious hand-made pizzas that blow all other pizzas in the town out of the water. You may have to wait a while if the guy running the places has just run out of dough, but it's well worth the wait. 50-70d for a large pizza.

## Marché
A good recommendation for the marche would be to avoid most of the restaurants on the outside edge of the area, as well as most of the restaurants around the square in the middle. These places tend to sell overpriced, low quality food that is aimed at tourists. A lot of the food here is, quite frankly, quite bad, but there are a few places worth eating at.
Restaurant Al-Akhawayn. Good food. More varied menu than many others. decent prices.
Restaurant Chez Amal. Used to serve excellent Kafta-Tajine, but has lost a bit of its atmosphere since the renovation. mains 40 dirham.
Chez Said. The sandwiches were famous, but since it moved to a new location, they are not as good anymore. 20 dirham.
Chicken Restaurant. Serves good chicken. mains 25-40 dirham.
For You. Sells decent junk food type meals such as pizzas, tacos and loaded fries, as well as sushi. One of the better places in town, and very popular with students. Located about 3 minutes away from the marche by foot. Expect to pay anywhere from 35-65d, depending on what you order.
Platane. One of the better places in the marche. Popular with Al Akhawayn students and less aimed at tourists. 20-50d. (updated Feb 2024)

## Drink
There are two centers of nightlife in Ifrane: Grand Hotel, and Aglemem.
The Grand Hotel has a dance club and offers expensively priced alcohol. The clubs are most popular on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, and play only House/Techno music.
Aglemem is a bar/restaurant that occasionally holds live music events.
Cafe le Chamonix also sells alcohol. It is probably the cheapest place in town, but still quite expensive.

## Sleep
There is no budget accommodation in Ifrane. The best is probably to stay in Azrou (15 minutes by grand taxi, ~6 dirham).
Apartments can be rented from 100-150 dirham per day, although finding one with clean sheets seems to be impossible.
Several midrange/splurge hotels are found in the city center:
Grand Hotel.
Hotel Michliffen, ☏ +212 535 56 66 07. It is one of the most luxurious hotels in the area. There are two pools. From 2500 dirham.

## Go next
The grand taxi (share taxi) station, which is connected to the bus station, has regular connections to Fes and Meknes, as well as to smaller towns in the area such as Al Hajeb, Azrou and Immouzer Kandar. None of the smaller towns have any mind-blowing attractions, but are worth a visit if you want to see something of the real Morocco away from the tourists. The taxi drivers all seem honest and do not seem to charge foreigners any more than Moroccans, and because of the university, many of the passengers are likely to be students who are able to speak English and are likely willing to help you navigate.
The bus station has regular coaches to major cities throughout Morocco, but because departure times to many cities are very irregular, it may be worth checking the bus times the day before you plan to leave.

Azrou (Arabic: أزرو) is a Moroccan town 89 kilometres south of Fez in Ifrane Province of the Fès-Meknès region.

Etymology
Azrou is a geomorphological name taken from the landform of a large rock outcrop (Aẓro, ⴰⵥⵔⵓ, means "rock" or "stone" in the Berber language Tamazight) in the centre of the city.

History
The first record of Azrou city in history in a letter sent by Fernão Taveira to king Manuel I of Portugal.
Azrou is mostly known for hosting the first high school in the Berber region: the Berber high school of Azrou (now the Tarik Ibn Ziad School). It was built by the French colonial authorities in order to train Moroccans for the colonial administration. It was one of the instruments for the implementation of a Berber Dhahir, which changed the justice system in areas where Amazigh languages were predominantly spoken, excluding these areas from Sharia and the authority of the Makhzen that applied to the rest of Morocco, and implementing a new legal system ostensibly in accordance with Amazigh laws and customs written in French.
The college became an educational institution in the reference area, forming part of the political and military elites from 1956 to 1973, after independence, the college was renamed Azrou Tarik Ibn Ziad High School.
In 1952, 20 Benedictine monks arrived to establish near the town the monastery of Toumliline which hosted interfaith dialogues between Christians, Jews and Muslims of different nationalities between 1955 and 1964. The monastery, which was closed in 1968 due to tensions within Morocco as well as global tensions, served as film location to the movie Of Gods and Men around 2010.
The town was long neglected by the Moroccan authorities since independence in 1956 to the detriment of the nearby town of Ifrane. Although it is the true capital of the Middle Atlas and a town that has given Morocco many leaders and intellectuals, the town still does not officially rank as provincial capital, although it is in practice.
The town has several hotels.

Geography
The market town of Azrou is located at a strategic crossroads of the N13 and N8 roads towards the northern end of the Middle Atlas. The N13 road connects Azrou to Meknes in the north west and Midelt in the south east. The National Route N8 comes from Fes in the north east and continues to Khenifra and then Marrakech in the south west.
Azrou is at an altitude of 1250 m and surrounded by mountains covered with evergreen holm oak and cedar.
The Cèdre Gouraud Forest is located to the south east, where one of the sub-populations of the Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus (called magots) lives and draws the attention of tourists. In addition to its rich biodiversity symbolized by the famous cedar forest there are the butterflies which are unique in the world. The surroundings of Azrou are a centre of attraction for the residents, hikers, and picnickers of the large neighbouring towns.  These surroundings are also home to the 'Cedre Gouraud' or 'Grand Cedar', a famous tourist attraction. Moreover, the Azrou forest provides an excellent hiking and exercising environment and also holds several summer camps for children. Azrou urban construction is in the European style (red tile roofs).
The region is also known for its cherry trees, apple trees, fish farms, and the abandoned sanatorium in the surrounding metropolitan area of Ben Smim.

Climate
Generally, Azrou experiences a warmer climate than Ifrane, because the city is at a lower altitude. Under the Köppen system, Azrou features a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Csa), in spite of its cold winters, not cold enough to be classified as a continental mediterranean climate (Dsa). Thus, winters are moderately cold and snowy, but without substantial accumulation. Summers are hot and moderately dry, which are noticeably wetter than in Ifrane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Midelt (Arabic: ميدلت) is a town in Morocco, in the high plains between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges. With a population of 55,304 recorded in the 2014 Moroccan census, Midelt serves as the commercial center of a large agricultural hinterland. It is also one of Morocco's principal cities for the mining of several minerals.

History
Before the French protectorate, Midelt was a cluster of qsur called Aoutat n-Ayt Izdeg. The modern town's name is a French corruption of the word timidelt (dish-cover) from a local hill.
Midelt grew in the first half of the 20th century around a French administrative post by the same name. Previously, villages and ksour had dotted the fertile surroundings. The French established their post to facilitate the mining of lead, gypsum, other minerals, and fossils in the nearby Ahouli and Mibladen mines and elsewhere. The development of these mines led to the construction of a railroad from Midelt to the Mediterranean coast and the electrification of Midelt in 1930. In Morocco, only Casablanca received electricity earlier. The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary founded the Kasbah Miryam des Soeurs in 1926 which later would become the Priory of our Lady of the Atlas.
After Moroccan independence in 1956, control reverted to the Moroccan government. Midelt is currently the provincial capital of Midelt Province.

Geography
Midelt is situated on the main road between Fes and Meknes to the north and Errachidia to the south. Geographically, it is situated in the high plains surrounding the Moulouya River, between the Middle and High Atlas mountain ranges.
The city's elevation is 1,508 metres (4,948 ft), making it one of the highest large towns in Morocco.

Climate
Midelt has a cold desert climate (Köppen: BWk). The elevation of Midelt and its relative proximity to the North Atlantic Ocean cools the daily temperatures to make Midelt one of the most temperate of the inland towns. However, many coastal towns have milder temperatures, warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
Every winter, when a cold damp air coming from the north west influence Western Europe and Morocco, temperatures can fall dramatically well below -10 degrees Celsius in Midelt. However, these extreme conditions don't last for more than 5 continuous days.
Temperature averages, from the years 1961 to 1990, yield daily maximum/minimum temperatures for January as 12.3 / 0.6 degrees Celsius and for July as 32.6 / 16.3 degrees Celsius.
Snow is common in winter, and precipitation continues throughout the year at moderate levels. However, the principal water source of the region is a spring at the foot of Jbel Ayachi, 10 kilometres (6 mi) south of Midelt.
A dam moderating the flow from the spring was destroyed by a flood in early 2006 following heavy snows the previous winter, damaging the nearby village of Tattiwin.

People
Midelt is a largely Berber city. Berber residents speak the Central Atlas Tamazight (Ait Ayache) language but most can also use the  dialect of Darija. Educated residents also speak Standard Arabic as well as French, which are used throughout Morocco in mass media, education, and government.
Because Midelt is a new city, almost all Mideltis can trace their roots either to one of the nearby villages or to elsewhere in Morocco. The city also lacks the sharply defined neighborhood divisions and traditional souqs of older Moroccan cities.
Very few non-natives live in Midelt. Of these, the longest established are a community of Franciscan nuns and Cistercian monks (namely Trappists) living at the Priory of Our Lady of Atlas in a nearby village. The nuns work with local women and girls to develop handcrafts and teach hygiene, French language, and other skills.

Economy
Midelt functions as the market for an agricultural area extending from the Moulouya River to Jbel Ayachi, bounded on the east and west by dry plains. This region is best known for apples; other produce includes walnuts, apricots, plums, pomegranates, wheat, corn, and a wide variety of garden vegetables.
Nomads and sedentary farmers from the surrounding area also raise sheep and goats for slaughter and for wool. Both of these are sold in Midelt, but largely for local consumption. Locally gathered evidence indicates that the local price of meat is inversely related to rainfall: in wet years, nomads can keep their herds alive through the summer and do not bring them to market; in dry years, animals are better sold than lost to draught.
Midelt's industrial sector is largely related to the nearby mines, of which only Mibladen continues to operate at high capacity. Lead, gypsum, and a host of lesser-known minerals are extracted for sale to industry and for household decorations.
Tourism continues to grow as an important source of revenue for Midelt. The climate attracts many visitors, mostly Moroccans from lower climes and émigrés to Europe. These support several small hotels as well as two larger establishments catering to Europeans. In addition to visitors, local handcrafts - especially carpets and blankets in the roughhewn nomadic style - are sold through cooperatives and merchants both locally and in Morocco's larger cities.

Midelt (en berbère : ⵎⵉⴷⴰⵍⵜ ; en arabe : ميدلت) est une ville du Maroc, à la jonction des chaînes du Moyen Atlas et du Haut Atlas oriental, et une commune urbaine de la province de Midelt. La population de la commune, de 44 781 habitants en 2004 (recensement), serait de 55 400 habitants en 2012 (estimation).

Situation historique
La ville de Midelt située à 1 521 mètres d’altitude, a été fondée par le protectorat en 1917 pour en faire un centre administratif de la région. Cette région est regroupée sous le nom de « Cercle de Midelt », cercle qui couvre une superficie de 6 000 km2 et dont les principaux centres sont : Itzer, Zaida, Boumia, Aghbalou, Tounfite, Ksabi, Bouayach, Krouchen, Mibladen, Ahouli. En dehors de ces centres urbains, le reste de la population habite les Igharman (dénommés ksours, douar, dchar, selon les régions et la langue) qui couvrent toute la région dans des espaces très rapprochés les uns des autres.
Ce centre administratif a été fondé par le protectorat pour, au moins, les trois raisons suivantes :

dans le cadre administratif pour la gestion de toute une population rurale ;
dans le cadre militaire du fait que Midelt constitue un passage obligé vers le sud-est du pays, donc vers l’Algérie, grâce à la route nationale 13 (RN 13, ex RP 21) qui relie Midelt à Errachidia (anciennement Ksar–es-Souk). Cette RN comporte un passage incontournable constitué par le tunnel de Zaâbal, tunnel creusé par les militaires de la Légion étrangère qui étaient basés à Midelt lors de la présence française, avec soit un bataillon de tirailleurs marocains soit un bataillon de zouaves. La stratégie consistait également à veiller sur les intérêts économiques de la France en assurant la protection de l’exploitation des deux mines de plomb de la région situées à Mibladen et à Ahouli ;

dans le cadre de l’exploitation des richesses de la région, la société française Peñarroya, exploitait les deux mines de plomb, situées à 15 et 25 km de Midelt. Celles-ci employaient plus de 1 500 ouvriers, encadrés exclusivement par des Français. Le plomb extrait était acheminé par camions directement vers le port de Casablanca pour exportation. Afin d’exploiter ses mines, la société avait construit en 1928, au Ksar Flilou, l’une des premières centrales électriques du Maroc. Cette centrale hydraulique alimentait en électricité aussi bien le village que les mines, grâce au barrage de retenue du Ksar Tatiouine situé au pied même de la montagne El Ayachi. Ce barrage permettait d’alimenter en eau le barrage de Flilo qui, lui, projetait l’eau sur les turbines de la centrale hydraulique électrique ;
dans le cadre aussi bien de la pacification que des stratégies militaire et économique, Midelt fut desservie par la ligne Guercif-Midelt jusqu'en 1935 (voie de 60 cm), reliée à la ligne ferroviaire Fès-Oujda (le tracé du chemin de fer et les noms des gares subsistent à ce jour). Elle est aussi le départ de la route du Ziz, empruntant le tunnel de Foum Zabel, creusé par la Légion étrangère. La ville était également équipée d’un aérodrome (aujourd'hui inutilisable) utilisé aussi bien par les militaires que par les hauts cadres de la mine.
Le docteur Louis Tonellot, futur directeur de l'hôpital Maurice-Loustau (actuellement Al Farabi) à Oujda, exerce en 1943-1953 à Midelt. Il diagnostique les premiers cas de silicose dans la région.

Climat
Située à 1 521 m d'altitude dans l'Atlas, Midelt possède un climat méditerranéen à influence montagnarde avec souvent de la neige en hiver. À cette altitude, la végétation montagnarde (sapins, cèdres) cohabite avec la végétation méditerranéenne (chêne, olivier, dattier etc.).
L'amplitude thermique annuelle est élevée et atteint 20,9 °C entre le mois le plus froid et le mois le plus chaud.

Personnalités
Khalid Skah, champion olympique du 10 000 mètres en 1992, est né à Midelt en 1967.
Ali Hassan, journaliste-animateur radio et télévision, producteur et présentateur des programmes "Ciné-Jeudi" de 1991 à 2003 et "Ciné-club" de 2003 à 2014.

Faune locale
Dans les montagnes aux alentours de la localité, des macaques vivent en liberté dans la forêt.

## Do
El Karma Couscous, Khoukhate (50 km north of Midelt on the road to Fez), ☏ +212 613 59 36 02. morning.

## Eat
Le restaurant Fès à Midelt, run by Driss, in the middle of town, is a good, if not very cheap option. But very nice food indeed and a great owner.
The food in the Hotel Ayachi restaurant is not that bad either, especially the apple-pie is quite good. Remember that Midelt is in the middle of the apple-producing region of Morocco!
Sandwich Atlas. Midelt's best 10 dirham sandwiches are at a little place next to the gas station that is across from the bus station.

## Drink
Not many options for a wild night out, but there are some hotel bars: hotel Ayachi, Hotel Taddart outside of town on the road to Midelt, and Kasbah Asmaa just outside of town on the road to Errachidia.

## Sleep
Hôtel Restaurant Taddart, ☏ +212 661223980. This hotel is by far the nicest in Midelt, and a perfect place to stop on the trip from Fes or Meknes to the desert.  Pool, spa, hammam, free wi-fi, a full bar and wood-burning fireplaces in the suites are some of the features.  The hotel can arrange for day trips to the area's abandoned mining towns and gorgeous hiking routes.  The hotel's location 6 km outside of town makes this a quiet and peaceful place to relax and spend the night or several days.

Erfoud (Berber languages: ⴰⵔⴼⵓⴷ, Arfud; Arabic: أرفود) is an oasis town in the Sahara, in the Drâa-Tafilalet region, eastern Morocco. It belongs to ait atta tribe, divided into several districts: Hay Salam, Hay Jdid, Hay Ziz, Hay el Bathaa, Hay Annahda, and Hay el Hamri.
Due to its proximity to Merzouga desert village in the Erg Chebbi Dunes, Erfoud has developed tourist-related infrastructures such as hotels and restaurants.

History
Jewish community
Erfoud's Jewish community traced its roots to the French protectorate period in the early 20th century, when several hundred individuals from nearby towns, particularly El Mâadid, settled in the region encouraged by French plans to develop the town. The community gained prominence as a base of the Abuhatzeira family, known for its esteemed rabbis, including Abir Yakkov, the Baba Lu Ḥazzan, and the Baba Sali. Due to the absence of an Alliance Israélite Universelle school in Erfoud, although one existed in nearby Rissani, many Jewish children attended a French school.
By 1931, the Jewish population constituted approximately one-third of Erfoud's total residents, numbering 1,172 out of a total population of 3,534. Following World War II, the number of Jewish inhabitants exceeded 700. Following Morocco's independence in 1956, the majority of Erfoud's Jewish population emigrated, mainly to Israel.

Filming location
Due to the beauty of the surrounding Sahara Desert and the town's oasis areas, Erfoud has been a filming location for many films, including: 

March or Die (1977)
In the film archeologists are uncovering an ancient city near Erfoud buried by a sand storm 3,000 years ago. The site is the resting place of a Berber saint, "The Angel of the Desert".
The Mummy (1999)
Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17 weeks. Photography then moved to the Sahara Desert outside Erfoud.
Production designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed.
The Four Feathers (2002)
For its Egypt and Sudan scenes, the film directed by Shekhar Kapur starring Heath Ledger, Wes Bentley and Kate Hudson was shot in Erfoud and Ouarzazate for more than a week.
Prince of Persia (2010)
Mike Newell selected Morocco as a shooting location for the film and also planned to film in Pinewood Studios. Filming began in July 2008 in Morocco. Eight weeks were spent in Morocco before the first unit moved to Pinewood.
SPECTRE (2015)
For the 24th (official) James Bond film, the nearby Gara Medouar played the part of an enemy headquarters.

Mars analogue research
This area of Morocco has also been identified as being very similar in appearance and possibly geology to certain areas on the planet Mars. Because of this, there is an interest in this area as a field research location for Mars analogue research.
In February 2013 the Austrian Space Forum spent the whole month with a field team including two space suit simulators (Aouda.X and Aouda.S) and a number of rovers to conduct a large number of experiments. They were supported by a Mission Support Center run from Innsbruck, Austria to simulate a mission to the surface of Mars. The main desert base camp was named Camp Weyprecht on February 11, with a later satellite camp about 80 km further south being called Station Payer.

Erfoud (en berbère : ⴰⵔⴼⵓⴷ(Arfud) , en arabe : أرفود) est une ville du Maroc. Elle est située dans la région de Drâa-Tafilalet.

Immense oasis, Erfoud est la capitale du Tafilalet (sud-est du Maroc), au nord de Rissani, le berceau de la dynastie alaouite. 
Erfoud est une ville qui possède encore quelques maisons traditionnelles en pisé. 
Elle est à l'une des deux extrémités de la route du Ziz, empruntant le tunnel de Foum Zabel, creusé par la Légion étrangère en 1928.

Centre d'intérêt
Au mois d'octobre, Erfoud devient « capitale de la datte ». Pendant trois jours la Guetna anime la ville. C'est la fête des dattes, pour clore la récolte. Danses folkloriques et concours des plus belles dattes attirent des milliers de visiteurs. Cette fête est devenue le salon international des dattes à partir de l'année 2010.
Erfoud est une des dernières villes avant le désert.
Ses paysages et son climat en font le deuxième centre de réalisation de films de fiction internationaux.
Cette ville possède également un environnement adéquat pour la recherche spatiale européenne. En effet, la topologie et les conditions d’accueil sur place sont propices à de nombreux essais. 
Plusieurs robots européens ont pu sillonner les surfaces sablonneuses ou rocailleuses de cette zone. Par ailleurs, cette région présente de nombreuses similitudes avec la planète Mars d’un point de vue géologique ou par sa ressemblance topographique.  
Erfoud est également une énorme réserve de fossiles et l’un des plus gros marchés paléontologiques du monde. Cette spécificité s’explique par l’existence d'une mer à cet endroit il y a 500 millions d’années. En se retirant, elle a laissé des fossiles marins. On peut y trouver des squelettes fossilisés de dinosaures âgés de 65 millions d’années. Les fossiles se retrouvent dans la pierre extraite de carrières pour en faire des objets décoratifs.

While many Ksars (fortified villages) have existed for centuries, Erfoud was built new by the French around 1920s. Arabs are the majority but as the tourist industry developed, many Berbers started coming to the city around 1990s.
Erfoud is a good place to stay and explore local destinations. Also Erfoud offers quite a good range of businesses, supermarkets, restaurants, mechanics - great for those traveling overland with their own 4x4 or cars, and wish to fill up with goods. It is fairly rural and does not rely on tourism in the way cities like Marrakech do. Thus, Erfoud is exceptionally relaxed, hassle-free, and hospitable.

Merzouga (Berber languages: ⵎⵔⵣⵓⴳⴰ, Arabic: مرزوقة) is a village in southeastern Morocco. The village is near the Erg Chebbi dunes, one of the tallest in the Sahara. It  is about 35 km (22 mi) southeast of Rissani, about 55 km (34 mi) from Erfoud and about 50 km (31 mi) from the Algerian border. Some of the other villages near the dunes are Hassilabied (4 km (2.5 mi) away), Tanamoust (3 km (1.9 mi) away), Takoujt (1.5 km (0.93 mi) away), Khamlia (7 km (4.3 mi) away), and Tisserdmine (15 km (9.3 mi) away). Rissani is the closest city of significant size, at 41.9 km away. (26 mi).

History
Approximately 9,000 to 10,000 years ago, the region was likely a tropical jungle, coinciding with a period when the Sahara Desert was characterized by abundant vegetation and lakes.
Merzouga was an uninhabited oasis that later became a transit point for merchants heading to Timbuktu. It also became a pilgrimage destination for the nomads of the Ait Atta tribes and eventually a tourist destination.
During French colonial rule, fortifications were built by troops of the French Foreign Legion after the battles of Taflalet, which occurred between 1916 and 1932.
On 26 May 2006, during the night, Merzouga experienced flash floods that caused severe damage to buildings, cars, and the traditional irrigation system. The flood left 1,200 people displaced and three dead. Animals also died in their collapsed stables.
"The flood damages were significant, with the destruction of 140 houses and hotels, deterioration of Taouz– Merzouga road and of the ONEP (National Agency for drinking water and sanitation) water supply pipe of Merzouga villages "
Due to climate change, extreme weather events of flooding have been more commonplace. In 2024, the seasonal Yasmina Lake re-formed.

Environmental concerns
Merzouga faces several environmental challenges, particularly related to tourism and waste management. The increase in visitors has led to concerns about littering in the dunes and improper waste disposal, which impacts the region's fragile ecosystem. Local authorities have taken measures to regulate tourism activities, including closing unlicensed desert camps in 2019 due to concerns over waste disposal, water usage, and infrastructure sustainability. These closures sparked debate among local communities, as tourism is a significant part of the area's economy.
The region has also experienced rare environmental events, such as unexpected flooding. In October 2024, heavy rainfall led to the formation of temporary lakes in normally dry areas, a phenomenon not observed in decades.

Merzouga (en Tachelhit: ⵎⵔⵣⵓⴳⴰ, en arabe : مرزوقة) est un petit village Chleuh Ait Atta situé dans le sud-est du Maroc, à 35 kilomètres de Moulay Ali Cherif, à 50 kilomètres de Erfoud, à 562 km de Marrakech, à 667 km de Casablanca, et à 669 km d'Agadir (côte Atlantique).

Présentation
Merzouga est réputé pour ses dunes, les plus hautes du Maroc. Le village jouxte en effet le plus grand erg du Maroc l'erg Chebbi.
Merzouga est un pôle d'attraction touristique de première importance pour cette région du Maroc, permettant le développement d'une industrie hôtelière, aussi bien localement que dans les localités voisines de Errachidia et d'Erfoud. Ce tourisme hôtelier a un impact écologique : surexploitation des ressources d'eau et non-respect des règles d’épuration des eaux usées.

Activités
Les activités proposées aux touristes sont la randonnée chamelière, le bivouac dans le désert, le quad, et, l'été, l'arénothérapie (ou bain de sable) appelée également psammatothérapie.

Contraintes
L'équilibre du site de Merzouga est menacé par la construction anarchique d'hôtels, la surfréquentation touristique et le développement des sports mécaniques (quad) dont le célèbre Raid étudiant, le Raid 4L Trophy qui y installe chaque année son bivouac avec ses quelque 1200 voitures.

## Overview
Merzouga is a village in the Sahara Desert in Morocco, on the edge of Erg Chebbi, a 50-km long and 5-km wide set of sand dunes that reach up to 350 m above the plain and 808 m above sea level.

## Understand
Most visitors come here to take a camel safari into the dunes, and to get a taste of remote (but certainly tourism-influenced) Berber life.
The local population is mix of Arabs and Berber, which are generally welcoming and friendly. Although especially in and around Merzouga far more than usual people will display a touting behaviour and try you to sell a tour or a place to stay.
In general, it needs to be remembered that the dunes barely present an authentic Moroccan landscape. Many tourists come here, ride the camel and bring pictures back home, making people believe that this is what the desert looks like south. However, riding a camel through the dunes and staying in a tent there is nothing authentic about it—it is a touristy facade. Having said that the region is nevertheless beautiful and interesting, and even the regular stony desert is impressing in itself.

## By plane
Airports around with international flights are in Fez and Marrakech. From there you can take an intercity bus to Merzouga.
From Casablanca you can fly to Ouarzazate, then continue to Erfoud, Rissani and Merzouga.
There are also weekly flights into Errachidia, about 2 hours north of Merzouga by car.

## By bus
31.096531-4.0104831 Supratours office & stop. Bus to Marrakech at 07:30. Bus to Fez at 22:30. 160 dirham.    (updated Apr 2019)
Supratours buses from Marrakech and also from Fez have one daily trip each that end in Merzouga village, for 160 dirham. CTM only goes up until Erfoud and Rissani.

## By grand taxi
From Rissani to Merzouga, a grand taxi or van is 12-15 dirham and goes about every 30 min. If you don't want to wait for other people to fill your grand taxi, pay 60 dirham. If you arrive before sunrise (if you come in the 06:00-07:00 bus from Fez) you might have to pay up to 100 dirham for a grand taxi.
From Erfoud to Merzouga, a grand taxi is 25 dirham, every 1-2 hr.
If you're continuing on to one of the small villages nearby, such as Hassi Labied, the usual tourist price is a fairly steep 50 dirham (total, not per person) for the 5-km drive. Beware that overnight buses may sometimes arrive more than an hour early, putting you in Merzouga before sunrise. If this happens, you may find yourself with no cabs available, so be prepared to wait for someone to arrive.
Beware of guides in Rissani or Erfoud who offer to take you to Merzouga for 5 dirham each, but instead strand you at their auberge 20 km north of the village. If you decline their offers of camel rides and lodging, it is often quite difficult (and expensive) to make your way back to town.

## By car
From Marrakech, drive east to Erfoud (2 days drive, stop for the night in or near Ouarzazate). From Fez, drive south to Erfoud (1 day).
From Erfoud, continue south 14 km to Rissani, carry on through the village and follow the road southeast for 40 km to Merzouga. The road has been asphalted to Merzouga, and also to Taouz, a southern military border town (foreigners cannot cross here). The short access roads (1- or 2-km long) from the main road to the hotels alongside the sand dunes are normally not asphalted, but well maintained. There is now an asphalt road to Hassi Lybed, a smaller village about 4 km before Merzouga.

## By tour
Tour operators can arrange 4x4s with driver/guides from Marrakech or Casablanca and back.

## Get around
The only way to get around Merzouga is on foot. It's fairly small and easily walkable, but you'll likely want to avoid the midday heat.

## See
Sunrise/sunset over the dunes. Folk dances and black G'naui music. Visits to villages near Merzouga inhabited by Senegalese musicians and dancers such as Khamlia can be arranged with some guides, ask at your hotel.
Animals – See the ducks, and in early spring, flamingos, on the Dayet Srji salt lake, just west of Merzouga (according to the visitor information office in Hassilabied, there has been no water for at least the past 2 years, as of May 2018). There are many other species of birds (ruddy sheldrack and Kittllitz's plower during the spring migration, Tristram's desert warbler, the Egyptian nightjar, the Arabian buzzard and falcons), and the desert sparrows are unique to this region and can be seen all year round. There are also reptiles (Algerian sand lizards, Berber skinks and snakes), mammals such as gerbils, desert hedgehogs, field mice and desert foxes, and scarab beetles. In the morning, you can often see their tracks in the sand. Brown scorpions can occasionally be seen, but they come out at night and tend to avoid humans.

## Do
31.077663-3.9902911 Grand Dune. Hike the dune    (updated Apr 2019)
Sunset on the dune. Even though there is not a single liquor store around to buy a decent wine for such a great show and view, it is still worth sitting on the Grand Dune and watching the surrounding area and sun set. (updated Apr 2019)
Camp on the dune. Instead of dropping hundreds of dirham for a remote camping experience with an all so fake looking headscarf, why not just stay on top of the dunes yourself after the sun has set? Bring a sleeping bag, the sand is quite soft. Also, bring water and leave nothing but footprint. (updated Apr 2019)
Hike the desert. From where Merzouga ends in the south it is basically just 5 km straight across the dune from west to east to reach the other side of the dune. If you feel bored, simply hike over to the other side, north by the Grand Dune, visit the setup camps on the other side and head back afterwards. Bring enough water! (updated Apr 2019)
Boarding the dunes. This does not seem to have become a trend yet. Nevertheless, some accommodations have skiers for rent, try Dar Gamra. Otherwise, maybe you are lucky and find a snowboard. Or, a relative strong and smooth plastic "slide" that you can properly hold fix with your hands does the trick while going down the dune. Head for the Grand Dune with the steepest and highest slopes. (updated Apr 2019)

## Tours
Tour prices are highly negotiable, try 25% less than quoted and use the walking out trick. There is always more than enough companies. And always negotiate with the company directly, not through your accommodation or any arbitrary tout from the street.
ATV & quad bikes. It is also possible to tour the dunes on ATVs. However, it is not as much fun as it might sound at first. You are basically following a guide and can not go bananas with your rented quad. If the latter is more of you taste, try to find a regular ATV rental and go on your own from there. On the way towards Merzouga there seem to be some regular rentals.Many tourist that come here with their own or rented motorbikes or 4WD go right into the dunes for a little fun. Some discourage this touring, but touring the dunes on a camel is neither more authentic nor worth more protection. From 400 dirham pp for a tour incl. guide (negotiable). (updated Apr 2019)
4WD region tour. A 2 hour drive that includes a ride with a 4WD onto the dunes, visit to a local village (and probably shop of a cousin), and a visit of the Dayet Srij lake with the impressive dunes in the back. 800 dirham per 2 hr (negotiable). (updated Apr 2019)

They offer camel rides, desert camping, and guided tours to explore the Sahara and nearby villages. The team is friendly and knows the area well. You can choose short trips or longer tours, and they can also help plan a custom experience based on what you want to see. Great for learning about Berber culture and enjoying the desert. (updated May 2025)

## Camel Safaris
Almost certainly the reason you came here in the first place. After taking you into the village to buy a proper head scarf (of course from their cousin for a special price) to protect you from the sun, you'll be thrown on a camel and lead off into the desert. (Good luck with your knees.) Meals, water, tents, etc should all be taken care of by your leader, but naturally you will have to confirm this when you do your negotiations beforehand and make sure you're very specific, and ask lots of questions. Speaking of negotiations, do your research before coming (ask other travelers in Marrakech, etc., for recommendations and for what they paid), and be prepared to bargain very hard(!)—the industry here is smooth and deceivingly vicious. On the first night, most groups end up at a pre-setup camp circle at the base of some large dunes, where the various tour operators have their "authentic" Berber tents set up. Dinner will be cooked here, often some music played, and you can frolic on the sand dunes under zillions of stars. If you're only on a 1-day trip, then you'll wake early, have some tea/breakfast, and head back before it gets hot. Others will hang out during the day, beating the heat in the tents all day, and either spend another night here or venture further out beyond the dunes and stay with a Berber family, where you'll then set out to return early on the third morning. A few operators have their own private camps that will offer a more remote experience, ask around if this is what you seek. This provides a more intimate setting with fewer people and noise where you can relax and enjoy the stars. Cost a little bit more but worth it. Also check to see if showers are included after the camel trek.

## Money
There is apparently just 31.099253-4.0167941 one ATM at the north entrance of Merzouga, which might not be very reliable. It is better to stack up cash in Erfoud or Rissani.

## Eat
Most people eat meals at their lodge, but a few basic restaurants are scattered around the town if you are in need.
Haven La Chance, Hassi Labaid, ☏ +212 66859-9340. Arrange lunches at Haven La Chance Desert Hotel, either at the hotel or in the desert itself. A popular item is pizza cooked in the sand as the nomads do.

## Stay healthy
For prepared food try to prefer places with enough customers. This is the desert and hygiene standards are lower than in the rest of Morocco.

## Camping
Just head into the dunes and get a place on top of a dune or somewhere close to a tree to be safe from any vehicles. Even though at night probably no one is driving around, because it is too dangerous getting stuck. The desert here is relatively warm at night but a proper sleeping bag is necessary. Check the weather forecast for the temperatures.

## Merzouga
Just near the village there are many small to larger estates made of mud which have decent rooms, running water, WiFi and breakfast available for prices starting from 170-300 dirham for a double.
31.093682-4.0067961 Dar Gamra (Family Morrocon House). A decent house, rated pretty well. The owner is relaxed and not too pressuring about selling you anything and you could just stay around, use that WiFi and wait for the heat to vanish in the afternoon. They apparently also have their own camel tour. Double from 170 dirham.    (updated Apr 2019)

## Touts
Basically everyone in Merzouga is a tout, trying to sell you a camel, ATV or 4WD tour, or anything else that can be had a commission from. Be sure not to fall for any guy that has nothing to do with the actual tour, operator or accommodation.

## Romantic liaisons
As with many places, be cautious with anyone who seems interested in romantic entanglements, as incidents of foreign women being charmed by locals and then discovering that the "romance" was merely a cover to obtain sex, money, or other services are not uncommon and increasing. This seems especially true for young foreign travellers. The cosy camp surroundings and maybe some wine does the rest.

## Go next
Supratours buses travel from the center of Merzouga village north to Meknes, Fez and also over to Ouarzazate and then Marrakech. This is new and an affordable way to get in and out the desert. But there are no stops to visit the Todra Gorge, Dades valley or Ait Ben Haddaou or Ifrane. Or to take rest stops at your leisure! They travel overnight from Fez and during the day from Marrakech.

Tafraout ou Tafraoute (en berbère : Tafrawt - ⵜⴰⴼⵔⴰⵡⵜ, en arabe: تافراوت) est une petite ville berbèrophone marocaine situé dans l'Anti-Atlas, chaîne de montagnes au sud-ouest du Maroc située entre le Haut Atlas central et du Souss au Tafilalet. Située à 170 km au sud-est d'Agadir dans la région du Souss au cœur de la vallée des Ammeln, à une centaine de kilomètres au sud de Taroudant et à l’est de Tiznit, la ville dépend administrativement de la province de Tiznit, dans la région de Souss-Massa.
La ville de Tafraout en elle-même n’héberge que six mille habitants. Mais le nom désigne par extension une flopée de petits villages nichés dans la même vallée.
Célèbre pour ses couleurs, son histoire et ses personnalités, la région a été à plusieurs époques la capitale du Souss. Cette ville, qui était à l'origine un souk, est actuellement un centre administratif entouré par plusieurs tribus, chacune d'elles est composé  d'une centaine de villages.
Perchée à 1 200 mètres d’altitude, les tribus entourant Tafraout sont réputés pour leur palmeraie où poussent des vergers d’amandiers et d’oliviers. Avec sa faune et sa flore exceptionnelle, c’est une destination touristique, qui permet de découvrir l’un des berceaux de la culture amazighe.

Présentation
Tafraout est entouré d'une myriade de rochers de formes diverses, se dressant au-dessus d'une palmeraie qui abrite des arganiers, et des plantations d'amandiers et d'oliviers. Au printemps, la vallée de Tafraout offre un spectacle magnifique lorsque les amandiers sont en fleur.
Les habitants de la vallée de Tafraout cultivent les céréales et de multiples arbres fruitiers. Au cours des années 1960 et 1970, une importante partie de sa population s'est expatriée hors de la région à cause de la sécheresse et tient un peu partout, au Maroc et ailleurs, des commerces ou d'autres activités financières ou commerciales.
Cette petite ville de Tafraout et ses environs se distinguent comme étant la ville natale de plusieurs personnalités qui ont marqué différents domaines au Maroc ainsi qu'elle est une des régions les plus visitées au sud du pays et précisément dans la région du Souss-Massa.
Les tribus les plus proches de Tafraout sont : Idaoussemlal, Tahala, Ait Ouafka, Ammelen, Amanouz, Aguerd Oudad, Ait Bounouh, Tassrirte, Ighchane, Doutalzought, Ait Abdellah, Ait Souab, Izerbi...
Tafraout veut dire : celle qui est cachée au regard.[réf. nécessaire]

Histoire
Époque préhistorique
Le sud marocain formait l'une des zones de stabilité humaine les plus anciennes, qui remonte à la fin du néolithique, et cela est évident à travers les inscriptions rocheuses dans l'Anti Atlas, qui remontent généralement à huit mille ans.
Des gravures rupestres dont regorge la région, témoignent une vieille civilisation pendant laquelle les hommes de l'Anti-Atlas domestiquaient des animaux disparus, et qui sont gravés à la main sur quelques rochers : antilopes, éléphants, panthères, hyènes. Ils s'étendent de l'Anti Atlas jusqu'au Tassili, en Algérie, sur toute cette étendue, nous avons la même population, les mêmes traditions, les mêmes espèces animales. Ce qui veut dire que la terre, était plus fertile et qu'il y avait une eau plus abondante et de denses forêts de chêne, d'arganier et de jujubier. Une étape de désertification ayant duré 20000 ans avant un retour verdoyant a également été relevé, avec certaines vallées ayant été épargnées, formant des oasis de l’époque grâce aux sources d’eau permanentes.

Antiquité
L'histoire de la région est entourée de mystère en raison du manque de sources et de la multiplicité des récits, ce qui a conduit à leur différence dans l'identification de certains sites et de certains noms tribaux, de sorte que le discours sur l'histoire de la région fait partie intégrante de la discussion de l'histoire de l'Anti Atlas en général, ainsi que la discussion de l'histoire du sud marocain en relation avec l'histoire des berbères.
Cette région était également une ancienne zone de peuplement pour des communautés juifs datant du XIe siècle av. J.-C.1, dans laquelle l'Anti-Atlas occidental était toute la zone de propagation de cet élément, où le plus ancien royaume juif du Maroc a été établi, «Tabu Shu Dunsur », auquel les Juifs sont venus après leur persécution de l'Est, et c'est maintenant Ifrane, qui a été créé après un accord avec les gens de la région. Le règne des juifs dans cette région n'a pas duré longtemps, car ils l'ont rapidement perdu au profit des Berbères de la région.
Les populations de la région sont influencés dans l'antiquité par les croyances proche-orientales. Une mythologie berbère se développe dont le culte principal est la divinité Ammon d'Égypte antique.
À la veille de la conquête musulmane du Maghreb, plusieurs tribus berbères pratiquaient le judaïsme, ainsi que le christianisme. Le reste de la population demeure Païen.

Conquête musulmane
L'Islam jouait un rôle important en tant que facteur d'attraction ou de séparation. Nombreuses sont les tribus ou les fractions qui cherchent à se faire passer pour arabes, les familles maraboutiques qui tentent de s'attribuer une ascendance chérifienne. Le citadin arabe et dévot figure à leurs yeux une sorte d'idéal. Les grandes dynasties berbères n'ont pas fondé une civilisation berbère. Elles ont adopté la civilisation arabe et l'ont parfois même fait briller.
Chez la population des villages de Tafraout, la dignité de chef de tribu n'était nullement héréditaire. Le nouveau cheikh («Amghar» en amazigh) est élu lors de l'élection au jour du souk.
Comme la plupart des villages berbères, ils étaient dirigé par une «djamâa». On désigne par là un groupe d'à peu près  12 hommes élus par les villageois et qui formaient une sorte de conseil. Ils se réunissaient aussi souvent que possible et discutaient des affaires du village.
Il n'y avait pas de séances formelles; ils se retrouvaient simplement et s'installaient quelque part. En principe, n'importe quel homme pouvait assister à ces rencontres et la plupart de ceux qui le faisaient étaient des hommes d'âge respectable.

Moyen âge
Des historiens se réfèrent au nom de Tamdoult, qui a été mentionné par les rabbins juifs comme une ancienne colonie pour eux et qui ont commencé à y exploiter et échanger de l'argent, jusqu'au début du XXe siècle.
Quant à l'histoire de la région de Tafraout et de ses environs au Moyen Âge, il existe deux facteurs principaux qui contrôlent l'histoire de cette région et ils sont liés à l'emplacement et à la position. En ce qui concerne le premier, considérant que Tafraout est situé dans l'Anti Atlas, il s'agit d'une zone de transit entre le Sud ou le Sahara et la plaine du Souss, tandis que le second fait de Tafraout un bassin interne qui s'impose comme un facteur d'explication de la guerre des tribus dont la région a été témoin. Ainsi, pour son emplacement stratégique, Tafraout a joué le rôle de médiateur commercial tout au long de l'histoire médiévale du Maroc, c'est-à-dire depuis l'émergence de Tamdoult comme ville commerciale importante.
La sédentarisation humaine dans la région a été faite après l’effondrement de la ville Antique de Tamedoult. Il s’agit de l’origine de la plupart des résidents de la région.
À l’arrivée dans cette zone montagneuse nommée Gazoula par le savant Al Mokhtar Soussi, une impression particulière fait surface. Il s’agit d’un cumul historique et culturel guidé par les écoles coraniques et les zaouia de la région, une bonne gestion de la vie quotidienne par une agriculture et un système de partage d’eau optimaux, nécessaires à cause de la rareté en eau. Ce phénomène nécessite une étude Anthropologique de cette société conservatrice en apparence.
La région s'y est installée par une population berbère locale appelée les Jazuli, qui était dispersée dans les montagnes de Jazula, avec des rares éléments arabes qui sont entrés dans la région pour répandre l'islam à l'époque idrisside, en plus des juifs dont la présence dans la région remonte à avant le Christ. L'entrée des Idrissides dans le Petit Atlas a abouti à l'établissement de la ville de Tamdoult dans le Djebel Bani et à l'exploitation de l'argent en métal sous le règne de Yahya bin Idris, qui s'y est installé.
L'importance des mines de Tamdoult a été mentionnée dans des livres considérés comme source de l'histoire médiévale marocaine, comme Al-Bakri et Al-Yaqoubi. Ce qui apparaît, c'est que les tribus Jazula sont restées semi-indépendantes du centre où le Makhzen à certaines étapes de l'histoire médiévale, lorsque les Idrisides les ont atteints pour répandre l'Islam, et les Almoravides ont pu les subjuguer plus tard, de sorte que les Almohades ont eu du mal à subjuguer ces tribus, tandis que l'État saadien a trouvé le soutien de la terre de Jezula. En général, l'intérêt des Almoravides et des Almohades pour l'Anti Atlas s'inscrit dans l'intérêt de Tamdoult en tant que point stratégique pour le commerce du désert.
Sur le plan économique, «Elcast» est considérée comme la capitale de Jazula située dans les montagnes Cust au nord de Tafraout - comme certains historiens ont tenté de la définir - parmi quatre villes importantes du sud du Sous au cours des XIIe et XIIIe siècles, en raison de son emplacement stratégique reliant Tamdolt et Taroudant et la sous-plaine vers «Mogador» En tant que plus grand centre commercial du sud du Maroc à l'époque. Ensuite, «Falkast» est un passage principal et un débouché vers le bassin de Tafraout, en passant par «Nebrakak» puis «Issafen» vers le lac «Aqa» pour atteindre Tamdoult. Cependant, au début du XVIe siècle, le comptage de ces les zones vers l'effondrement commenceront immédiatement[pas clair] après l'entrée des Arabes de Bani Maqal et l'engagement d'un groupe.Ainsi, avec la détérioration du rôle commercial de Tamdoult et sa destruction ultérieure, les conditions sociales des habitants de Tamdoilt, Aqa, Ait et Wabli seront se détériorer avec eux, et par la suite les pousser à migrer et à rechercher des zones agricoles dans les oasis et les bassins, et ainsi ils se sont installés dans les oasis de l'Anti Atlas, du Moyen et de l'Ouest, comme 'Esfen et Edaukensos et vers l'ouest vers le bassin de Tafraout, et ceci est cohérent avec ce que les habitants de ces oasis affirment dans l'Anti Atlas en général sur leurs origines géographiques qu'ils remontent à Tamdoult. Par leur arrivée dans ces zones et peu après, la région de Tafraout sera témoin de guerres tribales qui se poursuivront jusqu'au début du XXe siècle.
Les étrangers et le Makhzen appelaient ces régions "blad siba" (en français: zones de désordre), le pouvoir royal ne s'exerçait pas entièrement sur Tafraout et ses environs qui était autogérée, et où des comités des villages élus par les habitants faisaient la loi.

Protectorat français (1932-1956)
Après l'annonce du Protectorat français du Maroc en 1912, une longue guerre commence entre les populations locales et l'armée française, qui voulaient soumettre les régions rurales du Souss. Cette résistance s'étala sur plus de vingt-cinq ans. Ce n'est qu'au bout de ce laps de temps que les Français parvinrent à assujettir les campagnes au début des années 1930.
En 1934, les résistants des tribus de Tafraout livrèrent un dernier combat aux soldats envahisseurs français qui les vainquirent près de la tribu d'Aït-Abdalah. C'est alors que les Français triomphèrent; après quoi ils établirent une base militaire à Tafraout.
Chef français, le «Qbtann», comme on l'appelait, c'était le gouverneur militaire de Tafraoute.
À la suite de l'installation des Français, le conseil du village ou djamâa n'eut plus à s'occuper que de questions quotidiennes purement pratiques, le pouvoir effectif étant aux mains des Français, qui décidaient aussi de toutes les questions juridiques importantes. Cet état de fait engendra le mécontentement des berbères, qui jugeaient cette intrusion contraire aux lois islamiques. Les autorités françaises tranchaient désormais des problèmes de droit civil et familial, qui étaient pour les villageois de toute première importance, et dont les Français ne connaissaient pas le contexte.
Les autorités instituèrent la collaboration avec des traîtres, qui pouvaient agir à leur guise, selon leur fantaisie, sans avoir à rendre compte de leurs actes. L'injustice et la corruption furent couvertes par des lois nouvelles, par l'État et par la police. L'ordre qui régnait avant la colonisation fut remplacé par une sorte d'anarchie organisée. Certains pouvaient assassiner, s'adonner à la corruption, abuser sans vergogne de leur pouvoir et se comporter selon leur bon plaisir sans risquer aucune punition. Ils avaient pour eux la «loi» et le pouvoir politique.

Époque contemporaine
Lorsque l'indépendance devint effective, l'ancien résistant Hadj Ahmed Ougdourt est libéré de la prison et élu premier Gouverneur, au Caïd et chef de l'administration du district de Tafraoute. Issu de la tribu des Issy, en prison, Ougdourt s'était conduit hautainement à l'égard du chef français, gouverneur militaire de Tafraoute. On racontait que, prisonnier, Hadj Ahmed Ougdourt avait dit au chef : «Quand mon pays sera libre, c'est moi qui serai chef à ta place ici»
L'homme entama un travail afin de mettre fin à toute injustice ou corruption. Les autorités mobilisent aussitôt la population pour construire une école dans chaque tribu et des routes entre les villages, ainsi que la plantation d'oliviers. Le gouverneur a réussi à convaincre la population à se porter volontaire afin de construire des écoles ou des routes sans qu'il fût besoin d'une administration ou d'un budget.
Les procédés autoritaires du caïd choquaient et inquiétaient aussi bien quelques autorités provinciales d'Agadir.
Hadj Ahmed fonda en outre à Tafraout la première coopérative de la région, une bibliothèque, une fabrique de tapis où des douzaines de femmes trouvèrent du travail. Tafraout connaîtra une véritable révolution culturelle. 
Le caïd de Tafraoute, Hadj Ahmed, put exercer son activité quatre ans, de 1956 à 1960, avant d'être mis à pied par le gouverneur d'Agadir, sur ordre du roi. Un an plus tard, il mourut dans des circonstances obscures. 
Il fut relevé de ses fonctions et remplacé par Abdelaziz qui avait été secrétaire général du gouverneur militaire français de l'époque du protectorat.
Quelques années après l'indépendance, le roi Mohammed V visita pour la première fois Tafraout en 1959, il demanda aux notables de la ville pourquoi la terre de leur ville produit peu de blé, ces notables lui auraient répondu : «Tafraout produit avant tout des hommes».

Toponymie
Sur le plan linguistique, Tafraout est un  nom amazigh féminin singulier qui devient au pluriel "tifraouin" ou "tifruine". Son masculin singulier est "Afrau".
Puisque, les noms des lieux berbères n'étaient pas utilisés de manière arbitraire, la dénomination de cette région avec ce terme implique une connotation implicite.
Le mot « Tafraout » est encore utilisé par les habitants, il est classé parmi les noms géographiques donnés aux complexes aquatiques.
Le sens du nom Tafraout en amazigh a trois définitions, il désigne :

Le bassin ou le réservoir conçu pour collecter et stocker l'eau.
Un bois gravé en forme de demi-cercle rectangulaire placé sur les côtés d'un ravin comme un petit pont pour les relier afin de faciliter le passage de l'eau d'un côté à l'autre.
La gouttière (en arabe: Mizab) qui est un canal demi-cylindrique, fixé au bord inférieur des toits, permettant l'écoulement des eaux de pluie, de manière à l'empêcher de s'écouler sur les façades des murs.
Le site de Tafraout est une terre basse longitudinale s'étendant du sud au nord, prise en sandwich entre deux hautes masses rocheuses, l'une s'étendant sur son côté est, et l'autre sur son côté ouest. C'est un confluent de trois vallées dont deux (vallée de Tafraout et vallée de Tizi) qui la traversent sur toute sa longueur du sud au nord.
Ainsi, ce site ressemble, à la gouttière, au petit pont de bois et au bassin fleuri ; dont chacun porte localement le nom de Tafraout ; en termes de forme, ainsi qu'en termes d'écoulement et de passage de l'eau à travers eux longitudinalement.
C'est ainsi que le mot Tafraout a été lancé sur la région comme l'indique le livre Tafraout et son ancienne école coranique. Cette hypothèse est renforcée et étayée par l'arabisation du « Tafraout » dans les décennies anciennes, avec le nom « mzabah » comme correction du mot arabe « mizab » traduit en français par la gouttière. Par ailleurs, l'auteur du livre "les tribus fu Souss" a mentionné le nom « Mizab al-Sutouh » pour désigner « Tafraout ».

Administration et politique
La ville est riche par son histoire réfractaire au Makhzen, le pouvoir central, avant et pendant le protectorat français. Les villages de Tafraout et ses environs ont été regroupés sous forme de tribus gouvernées démocratiquement par la "Jmaâ", une assemblée des sages, la plupart desquelles n'ont pas accepté les caïds envoyés par le protectorat pour se substituer à elles dans la gestion des affaires des villages locaux depuis les années trente jusqu'à l'indépendance.
Selon le découpage administratif de juin 2009, Tafraout appartient à la province de Tiznit, créée en 1975. Cette dernière est composée de deux communes urbaines (ou municipalités), l'une d'elles est Tafraout qui est considéré aussi également comme chef-lieu de la commune.
Le cercle de Tafraout est composé de 8 communes rurales qui sont rattachées à 3 caïdats :

caïdat d'Ammelne : Ammelne, Tarsouat et Tassrirt
caïdat d'Afella Ighir : Afella Ighir
caïdat de Tahala : Irigh N'tahala et Aït Ouafqa

Géographie
Géologie et reliefs
La région a une topographie complexe caractérisée par des montagnes et des plateaux traversés par des oueds et des vallées. Tafraout est perchée à 1 200 mètres d'altitude, sauf pour Jbel Lkest qui dépasse 2 500 m. La ville se trouvent dans l'Anti-Atlas marocain et ses montagnes sont formées de roches métamorphiques et granitiques parmi les plus anciennes du Maroc.
Le granite de Tafraout, par ses formes étranges, suscite l’intérêt permanent des visiteurs, notamment les peintres. Les géomorphosites de Tafraout n’ont fait l’objet d’aucune tentative officielle d’inventaire. Toutefois, le granite de Tafraout est cité sous le code RG 73 dans l’Inventaire des collections géologiques de l’Institut Scientifique de l’université Mohammed V de Rabat, en 2014.
Tafraout est entièrement recouvert d'un sol sableux à grains épais, de faible fertilité. La végétation y est composée d'arganiers, d'amandes, de palmiers, d'oliviers, entre eux des rochers dont les flancs sont occupés par certains types de plantes épineuses courtes comme le cactus, mais sa densité est faible.
La formation ancienne et l'exploitation intensive ont entraîné le gaspillage du sol, en plus de la nature de la formation rocheuse. La zone forestière est limitée à l'orbite urbaine de Tafraout dans la région sud-ouest, en particulier «Doutelzought» et «Amerket» où les arganiers connaissent une densité importante , alors que dans le reste des régions, il ne dépasse pas entre 50 et 80 arbres par hectare.

Climat
La région est soumise à un climat qui combine des caractéristiques semi-tropicales et continentales en raison de l'emplacement de la région dans les latitudes tropicales sèches et sa distance de la mer d'environ 150 km, et les chaînes de montagnes qui empêchent l'intrusion d'influences océaniques apaisantes de l'atmosphère, donc son climat est caractérisé par des étés chauds et secs et des hivers froids et humides. Cependant, ces facteurs naturels contribuent à créer un climat local caractérisé par un manque de vents froids et poussiéreux. Les précipitations sont caractérisées par la rareté et l'irrégularité, et les précipitations moyennes en années normales atteignent 270 mm par an. Et son retard dans la saison agricole affecte négativement la rentabilité de ce secteur. La région connaît un temps froid pendant les mois de décembre et janvier, où la température minimale peut atteindre 0 degré, permettant à quelques millimètres de neige de tomber sur les hauteurs environnantes, alors qu'elle vit en juillet et août de la chaleur estivale, lorsque le maximum la température dépasse 45 degrés.

Hydrographie
Tafraout est situé dans une zone entre les rivières au pied de la montagne. Elle est le centre de plusieurs groupes de tribus situées dans les petites montagnes de l'Atlas, dans un bassin (plan d'eau) étroit entouré de collines granitiques, s'étendant longitudinalement du sud au nord, et possède trois fenêtres. Deux s'ouvrent au sud, l'un menant à la tribu d'Amanouz et l'autre à Tahala, et un passage ouvert au nord à «Asif Ouammeln», signifiant la vallée d'Ammeln.
Le bassin de Tafraout est pénétré par trois vallées principales et leurs affluents; deux d'entre eux le traversent longitudinalement, et ce sont: «Asif n Tafraout» signifiant la vallée de Tafraout, et «Asif n Tazega» signifiant vallée de Tazega, qui y pénètrent par son côté sud. Quant à la troisième vallée, «Asif n Tifraden», qui émane de «Taghazout n Ait Ousim», elle traverse partiellement le bassin de Tafraout à la périphérie de sa frontière nord.
Ces vallées et leurs cours d'eau affiliés ont contribué à définir et à tailler la surface, et elles ont un débit saisonnier. Tafraout est souvent menacée par les crues des rivières qui la traversent, surtout en hiver.
La densité des ruisseaux et des chutes de neige à certaines saisons d'une part, et l'évitement des roches granitiques d'autre part, contribuent au greffage d'eau souterraine, qui sont considérés comme la base de la stabilité et de la vie dans la région en raison de à sa douceur et à sa proximité avec la surface (entre 15 et 20 mètres).

Localisation
Située à environ 200 km d'Agadir par Tiznit, et 165 km par Taroudant, c'est l'une des excursions les plus intéressantes pour les touristes étrangers dans la région. Deux routes sont possibles à partir de Marrakech: la route 203 via le mont Tizi N'test et Taroudant, et l'autoroute jusqu'à Agadir, puis Tiznit.
Elle est bordée par la communauté d'Ammeln au nord, Tarsouat au sud, Tasriret à l'est et Tahala à l'ouest. Et loin de la ville de Tiznit, à environ 110 km par la route passant de Tahala, et à environ 130 km par Amanouz.

Transport
L’ aéroport d'Agadir-Al Massira est situé à 145 km de Tafraout. Nombreux vols réguliers en provenance des principales capitales européennes, ou pour certaines provenances éloignées avec escale à Casablanca.
Tafraout est l'une des excursions les plus intéressantes pour les touristes étrangers dans le sud du Maroc : 9 cars y arrivent chaque jour. Deux routes sont possibles à partir de Marrakech: l'autoroute jusqu'à Agadir, puis Tiznit.
Mais le mieux pour le voyageur avide de paysages montagneux est de prendre la route nationale 203 via le mont Tizi N'test et Taroudant.

Tribus
Les tribus de Tafraout sont composées de petits villages situés sur les versants de la grandiose et rustique montagne du djebel Lkist qui culmine à deux mille huit cents mètres et domine cette partie de l'Anti-Atlas.
Au pied de cette montagne, une vallée s'étend du nord au sud. Elle n'est longue et large que de quelques kilomètres, mais, quoique jusqu'à un certain point seulement, il y règne les conditions naturelles nécessaires à l'agriculture et au peuplement. Les villages se sont érigés à proximité des cours d'eau qui dévalent les pentes de la montagne, et les habitants ont aménagé aux alentours de l'eau des surfaces cultivables en forme de terrasses pour le blé, les amandiers et les oliveraies. Mais, maintenant que l'agriculture a été abandonnée en grande partie, les villages sont en ruines et seules quelques maisons se dressent, solitaires et abandonnées, sur des champs que l'homme a rendus à la nature.
Les tribus de cette contrée sont (Ammelne, Amanouz, Tasserirt, Igounan, Ait Abdellah, Ida Ougnidif, Ighchane, Tahala, Ait Souab, Idaou Semlal, Ait Ouafka, Ait Abdellah Ou Said...). Ils comptent en tout plus que quatre-vingts mille habitants en 1990, particulièrement réputées pour leur habileté et leur succès, notamment dans le commerce.
Chacune de ces sept tribus repose sur un groupe apparenté. Leur contexte social et culturel est très semblable. Elles constituent ensemble une unité géographique restreinte qui possède, face à l'extérieur, une identité propre ou qui se fondent sur une proche parenté et sur la consanguinité. Ces unités, nommées tribus, mais qu'il serait peut-être plus approprié de désigner sous le nom de clans, s'appellent «afus» en langue berbère, ce qui signifie «main». Le mot «ait» dérive de l'arabe «âila» qui signifie «famille».

Population
Activités
Les villages de la région se basent essentiellement sur l'agriculture, l'industrie, le commerce et l'élevage comme principale source de revenus.
Selon des données du ministère de l'Agriculture, l'amandier occupe une superficie importante dans la région.
Le mercredi est le jour du souk, c'est-à-dire de marché, à Tafraoute.
Depuis l'arrivée des Français, les autorités siégeait à Tafraoute, car c'est là que résidait le chef qui représentait la puissance coloniale.
Ces marchés jouaient aussi un rôle social important. Ces rencontres n'étaient pas seulement pour conclure des affaires commerciales. Ces jours-là, les habitants portaient leurs meilleurs habits, et rencontraient des visiteurs d'autres tribus afin de discuter autour de sujets sociales et politiques.
Le tourisme vert se développe petit à petit depuis quelques années avec des associations telles que « Aoumerkt », une coopérative féminine agricole du village Aguerd-Oudad a pour vocation de produire et commercialiser des huiles d'argane et des herbes aromatiques ainsi que l'amelou (amandes grillées et moulues à base de l'huile d'argane).
Des mines d'or existaient dans la région, et les populations locales voient ainsi partout des trésors du métal précieux.

Démographie
Il est difficile d'extraire des chiffres précis sur la commune de Tafraout à partir des statistiques officielles précédentes, en raison de la détermination différente de sa superficie entre 1960, 1971, 1982 et 1994. La population de Tafraout, selon les statistiques officielles pour l'année 1994, est de 3 949 personnes, et selon les données statistiques pour l'année 2004 : 4 925 personnes.
D'après les résultats du dernier recensement de la population au Maroc, Tafraout compte environ 6345 habitants.

Éducation
Éducation traditionnelle
Éducation moderne
À l'époque du protectorat, il n'y avait pas de lycée à Tafraoute. Le lycée le plus proche se trouvait à Tiznit, à quatre-vingts kilomètres plus au nord, et si le séjour en internat y était payant, les cours eux-mêmes étaient gratuits.
Sachant que les régions de montagnes avaient été isolées et autonomes pendant plusieurs années, les autorités françaises entreprirent alors d'utiliser cette situation à leurs propres fins, en associant les berbères à l'invasion culturelle française. Les Français décidèrent d'instituer des écoles françaises et proclamèrent la scolarité obligatoire d'au moins un enfant par famille.
Lorsque les Français bâtirent une école à Tafraoute vers 1951, l'événement suscita une frayeur terrible. L'information se répandit que les Français voulaient voler les enfants. Plusieurs enfants migrent vers les villes du nord et commencent à quitter clandestinement leurs villages où les gens se refusaient à envoyer leurs enfants à l'école française.
Après l'indépendance, à l'ère du gouverneur Ahmed Ougdourt, un foyer pour orphelins et enfants pauvres est construit, il fit même aménager une école pour les enfants qui ne pouvaient pas fréquenter les écoles officielles. Il s'y présenta trois cents élèves en 1959.

Religion
La région dispose de nombreux lieux de culte, notamment de cultes musulmans, mais aussi juifs. La vie des villageois est extrêmement marquée par la religion. L'islam était tout ce dont disposait l'individu pour répondre aux grandes questions de la vie. Au cas où la personne néglige de prier régulièrement, tout le village en était aussitôt informé. Un tel manquement y est encore considéré comme une infamie.
Dans l'école coranique, l'éducation est basée sur l'apprentissage de l'arabe langue de l'écriture sainte. Dans chaque village est basée une mosquée, dirigé par un fqih, maître de religion qui maîtrisaient les deux langues arabe et amazigh, et en savait assez pour enseigner les rudiments de la lecture et de l'écriture. C'est un savant qui jouait le rôle de maître et d'imam. Il était aussi responsable de la mosquée, laquelle n'est pas seulement lieu de prière, mais sert aussi d'école pour les enfants, qui y apprennent le Coran.
Le savant homme mangeait chaque jour chez l'une des familles du village; elles pourvoyaient tour à tour à ses repas.

Migration
Dans ces zones défavorisées, les hommes n'ont jamais pu vivre de ce que la terre avait à leur offrir. Alors, ils ont toujours essayé de trouver des moyens de survie extérieurs à leur milieu social héréditaire. La plupart des habitants étaient paysans, mais l'agriculture ne suffisait pas à assurer à la nouvelle génération une existence décente.
Pendant les longues périodes de sécheresse, et lors des épidémies et des catastrophes naturelles, la majeure partie de la population devait fuir vers le nord, vers les plaines littorales de l'Atlantique où les chances de survie étaient meilleures.
Au début du XXe siècle, une première génération d'immigrés va émerger qui ont eu l'initiative de défier un ensemble de circonstances et de s'aventurer dans un voyage incalculable. Aux années 1920, l'émigration des hommes des régions montagneuses du sud avait pris de telles poportions qu'elle était carrément devenu la règle. Ceux qui s'obstinaient à demeurer dans leurs villages constituaient l'exception. Les émigrants acquirent bientôt une réputation de haute moralité, d'ardeur au travail et de valeur économique.
C'est au milieu des années quarante, que l'armée française a construit la première route reliant Tafraoute à Tiznit. Les hommes de Souss se sont mis alors à émigrer en groupe à Casablanca.
À la veille de la deuxième guerre mondiale, le niveau de vie dans les villes du nord était à peu près comparable à celui du paysan et de l'éleveur du sud, mais dix ans plus tard, le commerce du nord avait nettement monté au premier rang devant l'agriculture du sud.
Cependant, même lorsque les récoltes étaient relativement bonnes, bien des gens, des hommes exclusivement, cherchaient leur bonheur dans le nord, laissant leurs familles derrière eux. Ceux qui maîtrisaient suffisamment l'arabe essayaient souvent de se faire un chemin comme «tulba» ou maîtres de religion, en apprenant aux enfants du nord à lire et écrire l'arabe et à comprendre le Coran. D'autres se mirent à gagner les mines d'Algérie occidentale après la mise en exploitation par les Français des gisements minéraux de leur colonie. Mais la plupart de ceux qui émigraient vers le nord s'installaient a Casablanca et y faisaient leur vie comme petits commerçants.

Tourisme
Tafraout est considérée parmi les sites touristiques les plus réputés au sud du Maroc .
Malgré l'invasion des moyens de communication, la région reste égale à elle-même: naturelle, sobre et authentique.
Tafraout dispose actuellement d'une capacité hôtelière avec des hôtels classés de 1 à 4 étoiles ainsi que des maisons d’hôtes et des auberges à la portée de tous les budgets.
En 1984, le plasticien belge Jean Vérame réalise un travail multidimensionnel, à des échelles diverses sur un site granitique à 1 200 mètres d'altitude, dans l'Anti-Atlas, près de Tafraout. Ce site est communément appelé les « rochers bleus » et attire chaque année plusieurs visiteurs, jusqu'à devenir un des symboles de la région.
La région est aussi riche de quelques sites mondialement réputés comme le village Tahala qui abritait autrefois une importante communauté juive et La Kasbah de Tazka (Toughanj) qui a été inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine culturel national vu son cachet architectural local authentique dans lequel fusionnent matériaux de construction et paysage de la région où prédominent des pitons rocheux.
Aussi, il figure dans le guide des touristes, le rocher naturel «Le chapeau de Napoléon» qui est un gros morceau de rocher difformes auxquels, un jour, un touriste, y décelant une espèce de ressemblance avec le chapeau de l'empereur français, lui attribua ce nom et devient l’emblème du village d'Aguerd-Oudad.

Parmi les sites réputés, la "tête du lion", dans la vallée d'Ammeln, à quelques encablures du centre-ville, où la tête du félin est naturellement dessinée au sommet d'une montagne. Ou encore les oasis d'Aït Mansour, à 30 km du centre de Tafraout, incrustés au milieu d'un canyon et qui sont un passage obligé des touristes, les 9 cars transitant chaque jour par Tafraout y font escale. Mais les plus emblématiques sites restent les gravures rupestres dont regorge la région et qui témoignage d'une civilisation vieille de plus de quatre mille ans.

Culture locale

## Overview
Tafraoute is a city in the Anti Atlas region of Morocco.

## Get in
Getting into and out of Tafraoute is time consuming with at least 3 hours per direction to the next large town. But the drives themselves are very worthwhile for the beautiful views. The R104 between Tiznit and Tafraoute is locally known as "the road of the 400 turns" and a motorcyclists' favourite. It takes too long to do a day trip from Agadir or elsewhere on the coast if traveling by bus or shared taxis.

## By car
From Agadir the R105 leads to Tafraoute in 3 hours.
From Taroudant, the P1723 leads south to the R106 which gets you onto the R105 to Tafraoute (3 hours).
Coming from Tiznit on the R104, in a small settlement called Jemaa-Ida-Oussemlal, there is a junction with signs both pointing to Tafraoute; One says 40 km and the other 60 km. The 40-km route is the northern fork. The longer route goes via Izerbi and is the newly resurfaced road.

## By bus
From Agadir, there is one daily direct bus of the company CTM. It leaves at 14:00 from the Agadir bus station (gare routière), next to the Souk Al Massira. Tickets are also available online.
Buses to Tafraoute leave regularly throughout the day from Tiznit. Takes about 3½ hours. (Look for the green coloured LUX city buses.) There are CTM buses to Agadir leaving from the center of Tafraoute. One leaving Tafraoute at 8:00 arrives in Agadir at around 12:45.

## By taxi
Shared taxis go from Tiznit, with the trip taking about 3 hours. You must also factor in some extra time for the other taxi seats to fill up. 100 MAD for two travelers (December 2023). To get to Tiznit, there are shared taxis from Agadir, about 2.5 hour drive and similar price.

## Do
Hike out into the desert to Chapeau de Napoléon or Rochers Peints.
Hiking & Mountainbiking Go to Tafraout Adventure (on main square opposite post office) for maps, trekking tours, or mountain bike rental.
Go hiking on your own  If you want to do a great hike on your own, you can wander around the little mountain range just southeast of Tafraoute. It takes 2-3 hours and leads through a lonely river bed. With a little luck, you can see gazelles (gazella cuvieri). It is estimated that there are only 2000 of them left, most of them in Morocco. You can sit down in the shade of a tree and get a feeling of the desert silence. To do the hike, walk out of Tafraoute on the road that leads to the south. In the next village (Agard Oudad with its famous rock), turn left. After 700 m, turn left again and follow the river bed back to Tafraoute.
Go for a stroll If you have 30 min to spare, walk south along the riverbed (that's the side Hotel Salama is on). After a short walk you'll get a good view of the valley and cool rock formations. You can climb onto some of the rocks for a view of the village.If you are walking on to Napoleon's Hat it is best to rejoin the road when you can (marked as Imiyan on OpenStreetMap) as after then the riverbed gets very overgrown.
29.721394-8.968691 Hammam Large and in its way quite stylish. You can lie on the floor and look at the colorful ceiling. 15 Dh just for the bath or 150 Dh with massage (2025).

## Eat
In the restaurant of Hotel Tanger, down at the bridge in the city center. They serve cheap but delicious Tajines.

## Drink
