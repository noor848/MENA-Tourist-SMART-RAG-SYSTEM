      "content": "Aït Benhaddou (Arabic: آيت بن حدّو) is a historic ighrem or ksar (fortified village) along the former caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakesh in Morocco. It is considered a great example of Moroccan earthen clay architecture and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.\n\nHistory\nThe site of the ksar has been fortified since the 11th century during the Almoravid period. None of the current buildings are believed to date from before the 17th century, but they were likely built with the same construction methods and designs as had been used for centuries before. The site's strategic importance was due to its location in the Ounila Valley along one of the main trans-Saharan trade routes. The Tizi n'Tichka pass, which was reached via this route, was one of the few routes across the Atlas Mountains, crossing between Marrakech and the Dra'a Valley on the edge of the Sahara. Other kasbahs and ksour were located all along this route, such as the nearby Tamdaght to the north.\nToday, the ksar itself is only sparsely inhabited by several families. The depopulation over time is a result of the valley's loss of strategic importance in the 20th century. Most local inhabitants now live in modern dwellings in the village on the other side of the river, and make a living off agriculture and especially off the tourist trade. In 2011 a new pedestrian bridge was completed linking the old ksar with the modern village, with the aim of making the ksar more accessible and to potentially encourage inhabitants to move back into its historic houses.\nThe site was damaged by the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco. An early assessment of the damage reported cracks and partial collapses, with risk of further collapses.\n\nDescription\nLayout of the site\nThe ksar is located on the slopes of a hill next to the Ounila River (Asif Ounila). The village's buildings are grouped together within a defensive wall that includes corner towers and a gate. They include dwellings of various size ranging from modest houses to tall structures with towers. Some of the buildings are decorated in their upper parts with geometric motifs. The village also has a number of public or community buildings such as a mosque, a caravanserai, multiple kasbahs (castle-like fortification) and the Marabout of Sidi Ali or Amer. At the top of the hill, overlooking the ksar, are the remains of a large fortified granary (agadir). There is also a public square, a Muslim cemetery, and a Jewish cemetery. Outside the ksar's walls was an area where grain was grown and threshed.\n\nBuilding materials\nThe ksar's structures are made entirely out of rammed earth, adobe, clay bricks, and wood. Rammed earth (also known as pisé, tabia, or al-luh) was a highly practical and cost-effective material but required constant maintenance. It was made of compressed earth and mud, usually mixed with other materials to aid adhesion. The structures of Ait Benhaddou and of other kasbahs and ksour throughout this region of Morocco typically employed a mixture of earth and straw, which was relatively permeable and easily eroded by rain over time. As a result, villages of this type can begin to crumble only a few decades after being abandoned. At Ait Benhaddou, taller structures were made of rammed earth up to their first floor while the upper floors were made of lighter adobe so as to reduce the load of the walls.\n\nPreservation\nThe ksar has been significantly restored in modern times, thanks in part to its use as a Hollywood filming location and to its inscription on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1987. UNESCO reports that the ksar has \"preserved its architectural authenticity with regard to configuration and materials\" by continuing to use traditional construction materials and techniques and by largely avoiding new concrete constructions. A local committee is in charge of monitoring and managing the site.\n\nFilms shot at Aït Benhaddou\nA large number of films shot in Morocco have used Aït Benhaddou as a location, including:\n\nAït Benhaddou was also used in parts of the TV series Game of Thrones, the Brazilian TV series O Clone, The Amazing Race Australia 6 and Outer Banks.\n\nSee also\nTourism in Morocco\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nManar al-Athar digital photo archive Photos of Ait Benhaddou آيت بن حدّو",

      "content": "Le ksar d'Aït-ben-Haddou (en chleuh : ⴰⵢⵜ ⵃⴰⴷⴷⵓ, en arabe : آيت بن حدّو) est un ksar (Ighrem, en chleuh) au Maroc, situé dans la province de Ouarzazate. Il est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.\nPendant le protectorat français, le ksar était surnommé « le Mont-saint-Michel des Chleuhs ».\n\nSituation\nAït-ben-Haddou est situé à 30 km de Ouarzazate, dans la vallée de l’Ounila, au sud de Télouet, fief du Glaoui, vallée qui était un point de passage traditionnel des caravanes reliant Marrakech au sud du Sahara.\n\nArchitecture\nC’est un exemple frappant de l'architecture du sud marocain traditionnel, sur le flanc d’une colline au sommet de laquelle se trouve un grenier collectif (un agadir).\nLe village se présente comme un ensemble de bâtiments de terre entourés de murailles, le ksar, qui est un type d'habitat traditionnel présaharien. Les maisons se regroupent à l'intérieur de ses murs défensifs renforcés par des tours d'angle. Certaines de ses habitations semblent être de petits châteaux avec leurs hautes tours décorées de motifs en brique crue. Les plus anciennes constructions dateraient du XVIIe siècle. Le site aurait d'ailleurs été l'un des nombreux comptoirs de la route commerciale qui reliait l'Afrique saharienne à Marrakech - on peut encore y voir un fondouk (caravansérail).\nTout autour de ce douar un ensemble de villages se regroupe. Au pied de la colline coule l'oued Maleh, dont le nom signifie « rivière salée ». L'eau est impropre à la consommation car très chargée en sel.\nLes habitants de ces douars sont pour la plupart des berbères anciennement nomades qui ont ensuite choisi la sédentarité pour des raisons diverses.\n\nMatériaux de construction\nLes bâtisses du ksar sont entièrement construites en pisé, avec des planchers en bois. Le pisé (en arabe: al-louh اللوح) se présente comme un matériau très pratique et rentable, mais nécessitant un entretien permanent. Il se compose de terre compressée et d'argile, généralement mélangées à d'autres matériaux favorisant l'adhérence.\n\nSite du patrimoine mondial\nLe ksar d'Aït-ben-Haddou est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1987.

      "content": "## Understand\nAït-Benhaddou is a traditional mud brick city on the edge of the High Atlas Mountains. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and has been featured in many films, mostly as a stand-in for Jerusalem. It has appeared in more than 10 films, including Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.\nOvernighting in Aït Benhaddou is recommendable as you get to see the Ksar in different lighting conditions. It looks very different in the morning when sun rises or when the sun is just setting.\n\n## Get in\nAït Benhaddou is accessible from Ouarzazate and Marrakesh.\n\n## By bus\nMost buses do not go directly to Aït Benhaddou but can drop you off at the turn off about 7 km away from where you will have to find a lift. Or, you can get dropped off a little earlier at Tadoula, from where you can walk through the desert for about 5 km.\n\n## By taxi\nA grand taxi seat from Ouarzazate costs 20 dirham (as of 2023). From or to the junction at the highway, it is 10 dirham.\nOr, you arrange a private hire of a taxi for the trip. During the daytime, grand taxis are always waiting at the crossing.\nFrom Marrakesh it will be a full day trip and thus a private tour might not be a bad idea.\n\n## By car\nAït Benhaddou is 9 km off the main Tizi n Tichka road, which links Ouarzazate to Marrakech. Coming from Ouarzazate, turn to the right after about 18 km from the town. It's quite a scenic drive to Aït Benhaddou. On the way into town there is a slight turn to the right, which is a popular spot for great views over the town and the Kasbah.\n\n## Get around\nOnce inside the Ksar you can only walk or climb. There are two main entrances into the Ksar. One can be reached by new bridge. To reach the second, it is necessary to cross the river using the stepping stones (in dry season the river is completely dry).\n\n## See\nThe town itself is the main attraction, with mud buildings climbing up the side of the hill.\n31.05-7.1333331 Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou.
