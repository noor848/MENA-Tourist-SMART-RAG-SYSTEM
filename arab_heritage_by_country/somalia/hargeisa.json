      "content": "Hargeisa ( har-GAY-sə;  Somali: Hargeysa; Arabic: هرجيسا, romanized: Harjīsā) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Somaliland, a de facto sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, still considered internationally to be part of Somalia. It is also the regional capital of the Maroodi Jeex region of Somaliland.\nHargeisa was founded as a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior by the Isaaq Sultanate. Initially it served as a watering well for the vast livestock of the Isaaq clan that inhabited that specific region and later were joined by other Isaaq clans that currently inhabit Hargeisa. In 1960, the Somaliland Protectorate gained independence from the United Kingdom and as scheduled united days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic on 1 July.  Up to 90% of the city was destroyed during the Isaaq genocide, a state-sponsored campaign of violence during the Somaliland War of Independence.\nHargeisa is situated in a valley in the Galgodon (Ogo) highlands, and sits at an elevation of 1,334 m (4,377 ft). Home to rock art from the Neolithic period, the city is also a commercial hub for precious stone-cutting, construction, retail services and trading, among other activities.\n\nEtymology\nThe town evolved in the latter half of the 1800s as a Qadiriyya settlement established by Sheikh Madar, near a water-stop used by nomadic stock-herders on the way to the town of Harar. It proposes a possible derivation of the name \"Hargeisa\" from the sobriquet Harar as-sagir, meaning \"Harar the little\" According to historian Norman Bennett, Madar named the settlement Hargeisa or Little Harar since he aspired for it to emulate the city of Harar as a center for Islamic teachings. Another etymological root for Hargeisa's name derives from the towns connection to the skins trade. Hargeisa has been a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior, and chief amongst the goods traded were the hide skins procured from the interior to be processed in the settlement. In this etymological version, 'Hargeisa' is derived from hargageys, which means \"place to sell hides and skins\" in Somali.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nNumerous cave paintings from the Neolithic period are found in the Laas Geel complex, on the outskirts of Hargeisa. During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (c. 5th and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel rock art, encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless cattle.\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\nSomaliland generally is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the Dhambalin rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.\n\nThe Big Commune & Sheikh Madar\nAccording to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the Arap as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans. It is believed that and the Habar Yoonis and the Eidagale subtribes were amongst the early settlers of Hargeisa. Hargeisa continued to grow with the arrival of Sheikh Madar Shirwa, widely considered to be the founder of Hargeisa religious commune and the modern iteration of the settlement.\n\nMadar Shirwa was born in Berbera and belonged to the Nuh Ismail subdivision of the Sa'ad Musa Habr Awal. Madar arrived in Harar to study the Islamic Sciences under the top ulema of Harar, which consisted of Harari and Somali scholars. Sheikh Khalil, one of the ulema of Harar, advised Sheikh Madar to establish a Qadiriyya tariqa commune in present-day Hargeisa and spread the teachings he was taught, which lead Sheikh Madar and his companions to found the Big Commune (Jama'a weyne) of Little Harar (Hargeisa) in c. 1860. Somali pastoralists heavily follow rain and pastures this would change with the agricultural and stationary lifestyle Madar would introduce on the back of large sorghum plantations. This was to maintain self-sufficiency and Sheikh Madar and the other Mullahs would take care of the sick and elderly inhabitants of the growing settlement. Lastly, Sheikh Madar pushed towards a common religious identity rather than identifying solely by tribe. Stone houses and other structures would be built and Hargeisa would develop into a large permanent settlement irrespective of the caravan trade that defined it in decades prior. Sheikh Madar met with the 4th Isaaq Grand Sultan Deria Hassan outside Hargeisa in a famous 1870 shir (meeting) to discuss issues regarding the new town of Hargeisa and agreed that poaching and tree cutting in the vicinity should be banned.\nH. Swayne, a British soldier and explorer who traversed the Somali peninsula between the 1880-1890s wrote about Hargeisa in his journals:\n\nThis town is built some five hundred yards from the right bank of the Aleyadera nala, and at an elevation of thirty or forty feet above it. Round the place is a patch of jowari (sorghum) cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to Berbera and Bulhar. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people are employed looking after the jowari fields, and may be seen sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and is kept in order by an Arab from Aden. The town is full of blind and lame people, who are under the protection of Sheikh Mattar and his mullahs.\n\nBritish Somaliland\nIn 1888, after signing successive treaties with the then ruling Somali Sultans and chiefs, the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland with Berbera becoming the capital. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden in present-day Yemen, and administered it from their British India until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office.\nThe capital was moved from Berbera to Hargeisa, and the city was granted capital status in 1941. During the East African Campaign, the protectorate was invaded by Italy in August 1940, but recaptured by the British in March 1941. In 1945 the British administration had grown weary of the influence wadaads had wielded in the protectorate and moved to arrest several in Hargeisa. They had been deemed nuisances to implementing 'modern education' and agricultural reforms in Somaliland. Following their arrests on June 4, a mob formed and temporarily freed the imprisoned wadaads who were recaptured the next day. Religious leaders motivated the city's inhabitants and a crowd of several thousand rioters marched on the Hargeisa District Headquarters determined to free the imprisoned wadaads. They were fired upon by the District Commissioner's troops with one dying and dozens imprisoned for trying to free the Sheikhs.\n\nThe protectorate gained its independence on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, before uniting as planned days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.\n\n1960–1991\nIn the post-independence period, Hargeisa was administered as the capital of the Woqooyi Galbeed province of Somalia. Numerous new development projects were subsequently launched in the city by the Somali government. Among these initiatives was the creation of the Hargeisa Provincial Museum. It was the first museum to be established in Somalia since independence in 1960. The Hargeisa International Airport was also renovated and modernized, with the ultimate aim of equipping the facility to accommodate larger aircraft and offer more flight destinations.\n\nSNM offensive\nOn 31 May 1988, at 2:15 a.m, the Somali National Movement (shortened SNM) attacked Hargeisa. With two Habar yunis leaders, one in Burco and the other in the capital city Hargeisa. The SNM force attacking Hargeisa was estimated at 500 men equipped with 84 vehicles, of whom only 14 were left due to vehicles being sent to the front in Adadley. The SNM captured the headquarters of the 26th Division, as well as capturing the Birjeex arms depot where the SNM collected ammunition. An SNM fighter who partook in the Hargeisa offensive described Somali troops dropping their uniforms on the ground and fleeing. The SNM encountered stiff resistance from the Somali Army as they surrounded Radio Hargeisa's headquarters. Due to heavy bombardment from Somali heavy artillery and tanks, the SNM force tasked with capturing Hargeisa airport fell back and retreated to Adadley.\nBy 1 June, with the exception of Hargeisa Airport, the SNM overran the city. During the Somali army counterattack the SNM line of defense in the city was behind Hargeisa's radio station.\n\nHargeisa campaign\nDictator Siad Barre's response to the SNM attacks was of unparalleled brutality; with explicit aims of handling the \"Isaaq problem\", he ordered \"the shelling and aerial bombardment of the major cities in the northwest and the systematic destruction of Isaaq dwellings, settlements and water points. In one of the most brutal episodes of the Isaaq genocide, the regime targeted civilian members of the Isaaq group specifically, especially in the cities of Hargeisa and Burco and to that end employed the use of indiscriminate artillery shelling and aerial bombardment against civilian populations belonging to the Isaaq ethnic group.  Up to 90% of the city was destroyed.\n\nReconstruction\nAfter the collapse of the Somali central government and the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Somaliland, a slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Hargeisa and other towns in the country.\nSince 1991, Hargeisa has undergone a large-scale facelift. The renovations have been largely financed by local entrepreneurs, as well as Somali expatriates sending remittance funds to relatives in the region through some of the various Somali-owned money transfer operators. Most of the destroyed residential and commercial buildings have since been reconstructed, with many newer structures erected. Single-storey buildings downtown are also progressively giving way to multi-storey high-rises.\n\nClimate\nHargeisa has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh). The city generally features very warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather, a trait rarely seen in semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its rain between the months of April and September, averaging just over 400 millimetres (16 in) of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from 18 °C or 64.4 °F in the months of December and January to 24 °C or 75.2 °F in the month of June.\n\nAdministration\nSituated in the Maroodi Jeh region of Somaliland, Hargeisa is the seat of the Somaliland's Parliament, the presidential palace, and government ministries.\nThe first mayor of Hargeisa in 1960 was Aadan Cumar fure, who held the position from 1950 to 1959. The current municipal administration is led by Abdikarim Ahmed Mooge. A member of the Waddani party, he was elected the Mayor during the 2021 Somaliland municipal elections.\n\nDistricts\nAccording to a more recent December 2017 report from the Social Research and Development Institute (SORADI) based in Hargeisa, the city divided into eight sub-districts; being the 31 May, 26 June, Ahmed Dhagah, Ahmed Moallim Haruun, Gacan Libaax, Ibrahim Kodbuur, Mohamoud Haibe, and Mohamed Moge Districts. This information is contradictory to an April 2003 report by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which states only five sub-districts exist: being the 26 June, Ahmed Dhagah, Gacan Libaax, Ibrahim Kodbuur, and Mohamoud Haibe sub-districts, each having between four and six sub-sections of their own. Presumably a redistricting occurred sometime between 2004 and 2017.\nEach sub-district has their own elected council members, whose responsibility is to represent their district and fulfil their populations needs. To increase the effectiveness of these sub-districts, especially underrepresented ones such as Gacan Libaax, a so-called \"accountability forum\" has been established to discuss and create policy to better represent marginalized communities.\n\nDemographics\nHargeisa has grown rapidly since the middle of the 20th century. According to I. M. Lewis, Hargeisa's population was estimated to be 30,000 in 1958.  In 2005, the UNDP said that the city had a population of 560,028. According to CIA factbook, Hargeisa had an estimated population of around 760,000 as of 2015. The main residents of Hargeisa are the Sa'ad Musa subclan of the Habr Awal, the Eidagale and Habar Yoonis subclans of the Habr Garhajis, the Arap, and the Ayub, all of which are subdivisions of the larger Isaaq clan. As of 2019, it is estimated that Hargeisa has a population of 1.2 million The urban area occupies 75 square kilometres (29 sq mi), with a population density of 12,600 inhabitants per square kilometre (33,000/sq mi).\n\nEconomy\nHargeisa is the financial hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from finance, retail, imports/export warehouses to gem cutters, construction, food processing, textiles and livestock trading. \nIn June 2012, the Partnership Fund for the private sector in Somaliland was launched at Hargeisa's Ambassador Hotel. Part of the larger Partnership for Economic Growth program, the initiative will see $900,000 USD allocated to 13 private local businesses, as well as the creation of 250 new full-time jobs, half of which are to be earmarked for youth and one third for women. The fund is expected to improve job opportunities for 1,300 entrepreneurs through ameliorated product distribution and investment in new technologies and processing facilities. Eligibility is determined through a competitive and transparent selection process overseen by the Partnership program, the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce, and government officials.\n\nTransportation\nBuses are the most commonly used form of public transportation in Hargeisa. They travel on a number of routes serving nearly all of the city's districts. Intercity bus services are also available, which connect Hargeisa to other major cities and towns across Somaliland, including Burao, Berbera and Borama.\nWith the growth of urban development, several new taxi companies have sprung up in Hargeisa.\nHargeisa Taxi is another of the recent taxi firms based in Hargeisa. It has a fleet of four small compact cars and seven passenger minivans, in addition to around 19 other vehicles. GPS devices installed by the Sahal Technology firm allow the cab company's dispatch office to monitor its taxis to ensure that they travel within the speed limit. The office can also disable the vehicles online in the event of theft. Other new taxi firms serving Hargeisa include Dalhis Taxi and Marodi Jeh Taxi. Fares are inexpensive, costing between 15,000 and 18,000 Somaliland shillings ($2–$3 USD) per ride, the US dollar is also widely accepted alongside the local currency.\n\nInternational Airport\nFor air transportation, the city is served by the Hargeisa International Airport. The Somali-owned private carriers Daallo Airlines and Jubba Airways offer flights to various other towns in neighbouring Somalia, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso and Galkayo. Trips to international destinations are also available, including to Djibouti and Dubai. It has recently gained more airlines such as Ethiopian Airlines and flydubai. However, both airlines have listed the city as being in Somalia since August 2024, following an ultimatum from the Somali government, which would have otherwise seen them prohibited from using Somali airspace.\n\nEducation\nVarious primary schools and nurseries are located in Hargeisa. There are several state-run and privately owned secondary and high schools in the city. Among these are the SOS Sheikh Secondary School, Abaarso School of Science and Technology, Hargeisa Technical School, Salaama Secondary School, and Smart Secondary School, the latter of which is the pre-eminent secondary institution in the area, about 13 km (8 mi) west of Hargeisa.\nThe city is home to a number of colleges and universities including the University of Hargeisa, Admas University College, Somaliland University of Technology, Gollis University, New Generation University, Hope University and Marodijeh International University. The Edna Adan Maternity Hospital offers nursing programmes to students. The Institute for Practical Research and Training specializes in (applied) research and training.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nHargeisa City government website (Archive)\nMaps of Hargeisa",

Elle est la capitale de la République du Somaliland, proclamée en 1991 et non reconnue par les instances internationales, ainsi que la ville principale de la région de Woqooyi Galbeed et de son Berbera (district) principal. On la surnomme la capitale des Abr Awal.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville est située à 245 km au sud-sud-est de Djibouti, à 80 km à l'est de Djidjiga, à proximité de la frontière avec l'Éthiopie. Elle est à 1300 mètres d'altitude.\n\nHistoire\nHargeisa a succédé à Berbera comme capitale de la Somalie britannique (Somaliland) en 1941. Elle l'est restée jusqu'en 1960, quand la colonie britannique a fusionné avec la Somalie italienne (Somalia) pour former la République de Somalie.\nEn 1988, le gouvernement du dictateur Mohamed Siad Barre bombarda la ville, la détruisit à 90 % et fit des milliers de morts dans le cadre du génocide des Isaaq. On y trouve de nombreuses fosses communes, datant de cette époque.\nElle est devenue la capitale du Somaliland lorsque ce pays a proclamé son indépendance en mai 1991, mais ce pays n'est toujours pas reconnu par la communauté internationale.\n\nAdministration\nSituée dans la région de Maroodi Jeh au Somaliland, Hargeisa est le siège du Parlement du Somaliland, du palais présidentiel et des ministères du gouvernement.\nLe premier maire d'Hargeisa en 1960 était Aadan Cumar fure, qui a occupé ce poste de 1950 à 1959. L'administration municipale actuelle est dirigée par Abdikarim Ahmed Mooge. Membre du parti Waddani, il a été élu maire lors des élections municipales de 2021 au Somaliland.\n\nEnseignement supérieur\nL’Université d'Hargeisa a été fondée en 2000.\n\nCulture\nHargeisa héberge depuis 2008 une foire internationale du livre. Le Monde la décrit comme « l’un des rendez-vous les plus courus de la Corne de l’Afrique », rassemblant près de 10 000 visiteurs. Les organisateurs ont fondé en 2014 un centre culturel qui est chargé de collecter, pour conservation, les matériaux du patrimoine matériel et immatériel de la région.\n\nTransports\nLa ville est desservie par le transport aérien avec l'aéroport d'Hargeisa, le principal aéroport du Somaliland. On y trouve également un système de transport en commun par bus, un des plus fiables de la région.\n\nLieux de culte\nParmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées musulmanes. Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Église catholique, églises protestantes, églises évangéliques.\n\nCulture\nLa foire du livre  est créée en 2008 par Jama Musse Jama, universitaire somalien enseignant à l’université de Pise et sa compagne, Ayan Mahamoud. Cette année, seuls quelques livres empruntés à des bibliothèques de particuliers sont exposés, et la fréquentation ne dépasse pas les 200 personnes. Mais, année après année, voit sa fréquentation croître (quelques milliers de personnes en 2015), elle obtient une certaine reconnaissance, prend une dimension internationale et a un effet d’entraînement à l’intérieur du pays : des clubs de lecture et des bibliothèques sont créées. Des jeunes se sont mis à écrire, et des auteurs et autrices ont émergé, des livres commencent à être édités dans le Somaliland. La foire devient un lieu d’échanges culturels, mais aussi intellectuels. Sa durée va jusqu’à une semaine, devient l’occasion de spectacles y compris à tonalité politique. Elle est une des vitrines du pays, qui se tient au centre culturel d’Hargeisa, construit en 2014 à l’initiative d'Ayan Mahamoud. En 2015, l’invité d’honneur était le Nigéria, et en 2018,  le Rwanda.

      "content": "## Overview\nHargeisa is the capital of Somaliland. It is one of the safest places in what the rest of the world still considers to be Somalia.\n\n## Understand\nHargeisa has more than 1.1 million inhabitants  (2023 estimate). Apart from the occasional couch surfer, there is very little tourism (and no tourist industry), as almost all visitors are working for an NGO or other organization. The city is a peaceful and friendly place, but does require some planning to ensure a successful visit.\n\n## Get in\nHargeisa International Airport (HGA) connects the city with a variety of locations in East Africa, all of which are subject to change. Destinations can include Addis Ababa, Djibouti, Dubai, Bossaso, Mogadishu, Dire Dawa, Wajir and Nairobi. Some flights (especially those which \"connect\" in Berbera) begin with a three-hour bus journey to Berbera, followed by the flight. It's best to confirm that the airline you use flies in and out of Hargeisa.\nHargeisa airport has a very comfortable departure lounge, equipped with a cafe, toilets, television and Internet access. Buy a copy of the local English language newspaper from the paper boy for local news while you wait.\nA Somaliland visa is required for foreign travellers. These can be obtained at the Somaliland representative offices in Addis Ababa (in person) or London (in person or by post). See the Get in section of the Somaliland page for further information.\n\n## Get around\nHargeisa has an informal shared bus service. Ask a local for instructions. Hargeisa used to have working traffic lights, but now the only traffic control is by the occasional police officer. All residents entitled to drive must hold a photo driving licence, and all cars bear Somaliland licence plates.\nTaxis can be booked via your hotel (not hailed on the street) but are quite expensive. For example, a taxi from Maan-soor Hotel to the airport cost US$25 in April 2011.\nWomen must wear long dresses or skirts, to the ankle (no trousers), and must cover their hair and upper arms at all times. Men should not wear shorts or sleeveless t-shirts. It is not polite to take pictures of people (male or female) without obtaining their permission beforehand, and you will make people upset if you take pictures without permission.\nUS dollars and Somaliland shillings enjoy equal status in Hargeisa, so you can pay for anything with either dollars, shillings, or a combination of both. Ask what the de facto exchange rate is when you arrive. The de facto rate will be better than the rate at the airport.\nThere are also some car rental services in the city, one of them being “Royal Car Rental” which services at their main building and at Egal Airport, there are other prominent organizations such as Kaamil Car Rental.\nThere is no postal service in Hargeisa. The only courier company which serves the city is DHL.\n\n## See and do\nThere's very little in the way of tourist sights and activities in Hargeisa. Often, the best activity in Hargeisa is soaking in the surroundings and enjoying a bite to eat with the locals, who will be more genuinely interested in your story and your reasons for visiting their country.\nSome of the local landmarks that may be worth visiting include:\n9.56032744.0684241 Central Market (Suuqa Bacadlaha), Independence Rd. Somaliland's main shopping district is an expansive, chaotic, typical Somali market. The capital's liveliest market sells a huge variety of items, from electronics to cereals, meat to handbags, clothing to perfumes. Each category of items has its own section of the market. Hours can be spent exploring the nooks and crannies, observing the daily ritual of grocery shopping in Somaliland. You're unlikely to be hassled, but some stallholders may object to photography, so ask first.    (updated Aug 2024)\n9.5608844.0717062 Jama Mosque, Independence Rd. The city's central mosque, painted a bright white with two tall minarets from which the call to prayer is made. Hundreds of worshippers overflow into the streets at around midday on Friday for prayer. Non-Muslims are not allowed entry but are welcome to observe.\n9.55311144.0803823 Livestock Market (south-eastern side of town). Hundreds of Somali farmers come to buy and sell their livestock daily, including sheep, camels, goats and cattle. It was renovated by UK Aid and the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. The market is best visited in the morning, and make sure to ask before taking photos of animals.\n9.56153344.0653244 MiG Jet memorial, Independence Rd. The memorial displays a Somali Air Force MiG jet that was shot down while it bombed the city during the Somali Civil War; murals and mosaics display scenes from the war below.\n9.56150744.0660595 National Museum of Somaliland (Madxafka Qaranka Somaliland), 26 June Street. Large modern museum inaugurated in 2024.\n9.56358144.0491466 Saryan Museum, Abdirahaman Tuur Road. A two-room museum that provides historical information on the area.\n\n## Out of town\n9.78091144.4436427 Laas Geel (Laas Gaal) (about 50 km (31 mi) northeast of Hargeisa; the turn-off is along the road to Berbera). Laas Geel is a series of caves that contain cave paintings dating back to 18,000–20,000 BCE. Although the Laas Geel rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries, the caves only came to international attention in 2002 when they were discovered by French researchers. The rock art is in an excellent state of preservation and is thought to be some of the most vivid in Africa. It depicts wild animals and decorated cattle, along with some of the earliest known paintings of domesticated African aurochs in the Horn of Africa. The paintings also feature herders, who are believed to be the creators of the paintings. You can hire a 4x4, a driver, and a guard in Hargeisa. Access to the caves is restricted by the Somaliland government, so it's best to get a guide (and probably a guard, outside of Hargeisa). There are tour operators in Hargeisa who are searchable on the internet, or ask your hotel.      (updated Nov 2023)\n9.59361144.1208338 Naasa Hablood. Twin hills outside of Hargeisa that Somalis consider as a natural landmark. Made up of granite and sand, the hills were dubbed Naasa Hablood (literally \"girl's breasts\").\n\n## Buy\nDahabshiil Business Centre,  June Ave. The tallest building and largest shopping mall in Somaliland\nDeero Mall, Wadada Madax-tooyada. A medium-sized shopping mall with four floors and a FlyDubai office.\n\n## Eat\nAs the Somali heritage is pastoral, most modern food is inspired by neighbouring countries, with Ethiopian cuisine being particularly popular.

It is possible to walk around by yourself in the urban areas of Hargeisa in the daytime or at night, but make sure that you know where you are going, as there are no street signs, and no street lights at night. While the main roads have some rudimentary paving, most roads are sand and dirt and populated by goats and stray dogs.\nIn some areas (e.g. livestock market) people may throw rocks or bottles at you, similar to what happens sometimes in rural Ethiopia.\nThe local residents are extremely friendly and will greet foreigners in the street. Unlike some other places in Africa, they will not try to sell you anything and are often genuinely interested in having a conversation.\nIf you leave the city, you will be required to take a government security guard with you (known as an \"SPU\"). It is also possible to get an exemption from this requirement, but you must have the required paperwork or you will be stopped at the checkpoints on the edge of the city and not permitted to go further (this is for your own safety, as the countryside is not as safe as the city). See the Somaliland page for further information.\nThere are also some travel groups that can show you around Hargeisa and Somaliland.\n\n## Consulates\nTaiwan (Taiwan Representative Office), Sha'ab Area, Rd.
