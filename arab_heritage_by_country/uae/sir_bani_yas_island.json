The island is the UAE's largest naturally-occurring one, at 17 1/2 km from north to south and 9 km from east to west. Sir Bani Yas plays host to a wildlife reserve whose area is over 87 km2. Many varieties of animals, birds and plants live on the island, and in the water, there are dolphins and turtles.\n\n## Get in\nTake the E11 in the direction of Ruwais, roughly a 3-hour drive. Follow signs for a turnoff to Marsa Jebel Dhanna. From there, a water taxi to the island takes 20 minutes. If you are staying in one of Anantara's resorts on the island, the water taxi is complimentary, but you should contact crome@anantara.com and provide your reservation number to have a seat reserved for you.\nYou could also take a limo from Abu Dhabi city or Dubai or a chartered plane from Abu Dhabi city, if you really have money to burn.\n\n## See and do\nThe stars of the wildlife preserve are the flora and fauna, and a major attraction, therefore, is to go on a safari. However, you can also experience the island's hilly terrain on a bicycle, hike, snorkel, kayak, or do archery.\n\n## Eat and drink\nThe resorts have restaurants on the premises. Breakfast is complimentary for guests, but you will have to pay extra for other meals.\n\n## Sleep\nAnantara operates all three accommodations on the island.
