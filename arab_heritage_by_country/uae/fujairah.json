      "content": "Fujairah City (Arabic: الفجيرة) is the capital of the emirate of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. It is the seventh-largest city in UAE, located on the Gulf of Oman (part of the Indian Ocean). It is the only Emirati capital city on the UAE's east coast. The city of Fujairah is an industrial and commercial hub located on the west coast of the Indian Ocean that sits at the foothills of the Hajar Mountains.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2016, the city had a population of 97,226, a significant number (43%) compared to 225,360 in the entire emirate. In 2023, the population grew to 118,933. Fujairah's population has grown steadily over the past few decades, driven by economic development, urbanization, and an increasing number of expatriates settling in the emirate. The native Emirati population in Fujairah is estimated to make up about 30-40% of the total population.\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Fujairah is characterized by a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with very warm winters and extremely hot summers. In the summer months, daytime temperatures typically reach highs of around 41 °C (106 °F), while winter temperatures are milder, averaging around 25 °C (77 °F) . Humidity can be quite high, especially during the summer, making the heat feel even more intense. The region experiences minimal rainfall, with most precipitation occurring between December and March. Fujairah receives an average annual rainfall of about 120 mm (4.7 inches).\n2022 Floods in Fujairah:\n\nIn 2022, Fujairah experienced significant flooding due to heavy rains that occurred in July. This led to widespread damage in the emirate, affecting businesses and residents alike. The floods were part of a larger weather event that brought the highest recorded rainfall in nearly three decades. The damage was substantial, with traders in Fujairah reporting major losses. Additionally, the floods resulted in rescue operations for hundreds of people and the establishment of temporary shelters for those displaced by the flooding.\n\nCommercial\nFujairah City is the main business and commercial centre for the emirate, with tall office buildings lining Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, the main route into the city. The road runs through the city and connects Fujairah City to Dubai through the Emirate of Sharjah. The city's location provides direct access to the Indian Ocean for the United Arab Emirates, avoiding use of the Persian Gulf, which requires access via the Strait of Hormuz. The northern part of the waterfront has many cylindrical tanks for oil storage.\nThe Fujairah Free Zone is a special economic zone located to the north of the city, which is subject to different economic regulations. Creative City is a media free zone on the Sheikh Khalifa Highway to the west. It was established in 2007 as a media hub that offers benefits to media companies and entrepreneurial projects in the media, music, entertainment, events, communication, and marketing sectors.\nThe Port of Fujairah is located on the city's eastern coast, just outside the Strait of Hormuz, and was built in 1978. It began its operations in 1983 and today has a quay that stretches over 6.7 km.\nIt is located on a major global shipping route and is one of the world's largest bunkering hubs alongside Singapore and Rotterdam. The port is an oil hub and has launched plans to expand its oil storage capacity by 75% by 2022.\nThe Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) is located north of the Port of Fujairah and has a storage capacity of 10 million cubic meters for refined oil products. It was established to develop and regulate the hydrocarbon industry in the emirate of Fujairah and to support growth and investment in the sector. Eighteen companies operate in the FOIZ, and the Aramco Trading Company opened its second overseas office in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone in 2019, the first one being in Singapore.\nThere are a number of shopping malls, including the large City Centre Fujairah mall, opened in 2012. Other malls include the Fujairah Mall (opened in 2016), LuLu Mall (opened in 2014), and Century Mall. Markets include the Central Market, Fabric Souk, and a Fish & Vegetable Market.\n\nEducation\nThe University of Fujairah is located in Fujairah City.

Fujairah Heritage Village, near Madhab Spring Park, preserves some of the emirate's past. The main mosque is the large white Sheikh Zayed Mosque, the second largest in the UAE and a landmark that is visible from many locations in the centre of the city. It can hold around 28,000 worshippers.\nThe Fujairah Museum opened its doors in 1991 and is home to archeological exhibits discovered in various parts of the emirate. Some of the exhibits date back to the sixth millennium BC while others are from Islamic rule of the city's more modern history. They include pottery, jewelry, and spearheads. The most famous item at the museum is an ostrich egg that dates back to 2,500 BC.\n\nOn the seafront are Fujairah Corniche and Fujairah International Marine Club on Al Corniche Road. There is also bullfighting on Friday afternoons. To the north is Fujairah Beach on Al Faseel Road.\nThe bullfighting held in Fujairah City is a significant public event. It does not include matadors like the Spanish form of bullfighting and does not kill the animals. It consists of two bulls locking horns, which can result in injuries. Families and betting to attend the events are not allowed.\nMost major hotels are on or close to Hamad Bin Abdulla Road and Al Corniche Road.\n\nTransportation\nThe Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Expressway (aka Sheikh Khalifa Highway), a dual carriageway road, links Fujairah City with Dubai and other parts of the UAE, passing through the mountains just inland from the city. This leads into Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, which continues through the city to the coast.\nThe main airport in the emirate, Fujairah International Airport, is located to the south of Fujairah City. It currently mostly handles cargo traffic. Pakistan International Airlines became one of the first passenger flights to fly into Fujairah Airport on 25 November 2021. PIA now operates two weekly flights originating from Peshawar and Islamabad in Pakistan.\nAdditionally, EgyptAir operates flights to Cairo, and SalamAir offers regular flights to Muscat and onwards to destinations in India and South East Asia, with seasonal flights to Salalah.\nThe UAE's national railway, Etihad Rail, is set to connect Fujairah with other emirates, facilitating freight transport and reducing traffic congestion. This railway aims to link the industrial cities across the UAE, enhancing the transportation infrastructure of Fujairah and contributing to its economic growth.The first passenger station in the Etihad Rail network is currently under construction in the Sakamkam Area of Fujairah City.\n\nTwin towns - sister cities\nFujairah is twinned with:\n Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nSee also\nFujairah F2 IWPP\nMadhab Palace\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Fujairah at Wikimedia Commons",

      "content": "## Overview\nThe easternmost of the United Arab Emirates, Fujairah is the only emirate not to have a coastline along the Persian Gulf. It is also the youngest of the emirates: it only became independent from Sharjah in 1952.\n\n## By plane\nWhile Fujairah has an airport, it is closed to commercial aviation. Airborne visitors will arrive at one of the western emirates.\n\n## By car\nFujairah is roughly 2 hours by car from Dubai and the trip is on sealed roads throughout.\nIt is also quite easy to reach Fujairah from nearby Oman, as the border is very close. Visitors must have separate visas for Oman and UAE in order to move from one to the other by car or any other mode of travelling.\n\n## By bus\nBuses run regularly between Dubai and Fujairah (around one every hour during the day and evening); the cost is 25 dirham one way (tickets to be bought from the ticket window before boarding).\nThe bus service is comfortable.  Women, couples and families sit in the front two to three rows, and men in the remaining seats.\nBuses leave from Union Square in Dubai, and from the old Plaza Cinema/HSBC in Fujairah (stopping at the bus station on the way out of town, where passengers need to disembark to buy their tickets before re-boarding).\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis run from Fujairah (next to the old cinema) to Dubai and Sharjah. A shared taxi to downtown Dubai (Deira taxi stand) costs around US$7 and they go as soon as the car is full. An unshared one costs about US$28 but it depends on where you want to go in Dubai. Add another US$15 if you want to go the Marina area where all the tourist hotels are. Beware - metered taxis from Dubai to Fujairah are twice the price.\n\n## Get around\nFujairah city is not designed for pedestrians, being dominated by main roads. The fleet of Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry taxis are metered, and are plentiful. Fares start at 2 dirham during the day (2.50 dirham at night). Visitors attempting to walk around the city will attract horn tooting from taxi drivers, who seriously cannot believe that anyone would choose to walk.\n\n## See\n25.43897456.3535911 Al Bidya Mosque. the oldest existing mosque in the UAE, built in 1450 of mud and brick. It is on the way from Fujairah city to Dibba and after crossing the city of Khorfakhan. It is at the foot of a small hill with an ancient watchtower. An interesting site for those who like to experience the past world. It is a favourite place for foreign and domestic tourists. It is possible for non-Muslims to go inside this Mosque. Women (also men in shorts) must dress up to enter. The staff provides you with appropriate clothing and headscarves. The two ancient watch towers are also worth climbing up for a view.      (updated Jun 2019)\n25.13872656.3369782 Fujairah Fort. in the central of the city, overseeing the whole city of Fujairah and 3 km away from the coast, built in around 1500 - 1550 CE to defend and to repeal invaders, an immaculately kept relic from centuries ago, preserved without embellishment so you can really get a sense of what it was like all those years ago, as well as leaving plenty of towers and turrets open for you to explore of your own accord.

(updated Jun 2019)\nFujairah can also be used as a base from which to go on excursions to the surrounding areas, such as Khorfakkan and Kalba. The city is growing in stature as a business destination, particularly where oil is concerned.\nWhile the Indian Ocean is enticingly close, some parts of the beach would not seem to be a good option to swim at certain seasons. However,  Dibba Al-Fujairah which is 30 km from Fujairah city would be a good choice, where you can enjoy the sunny beaches and you can practice any sea activity you like. One more interesting thing to do is that you can make a boat trip to one of many islands that lie in the Gulf of Oman, a good place for strolling and fishing.\n\n## Learn\nFujairah Aviation Academy is a flight school in Fujairah's airport.\n\n## Buy\nFriday Market. amidst the scenic mountains of Fujairah midway between Dubai and Fujaira, near Masafi. It is the tourists' favorite. It is an all-week market, despite the name, that sells variety of items including and not limited to clay pots, furniture, carpets, local produce fresh fruits and vegetable, toys here. There is no fixed price, your haggling ability decides it. The prices are extremely reasonable but don’t forget to bargain as local tenders try to outwit tourists. Locals tend to enjoy the corn on the cobs and fresh coconuts (updated Jun 2019)\n25.12555656.3013891 City Center Fujairah. shopping mall opened in April 2012, and has 34,000 m2 (370,000 ft²) of retail space and includes 105 mid-market brands, 85% of which are new to Fujairah and includes VOX cinema.

The owner is not very friendly and doesn't speak very good English but rooms are clean and comfortable with private bathrooms.\nNovotel Fuajirah\n\n## Mid-range\nThe Al Diar Siji Hotel (part of Abu Dhabi-based Al Diar Hotels) is generally designed for business travellers. Staff are attentive and the rooms are pleasant. There are also a number of clubs attached to the hotel, including a 10-pin bowling alley.\nEmirates Spring Hotel Apartments\n\n## Splurge\nNour Arjan by Rotana\nBlue Diamond Alsalam Resort\nRadisson Blu Resort Hotel Fujairah\nConcord Fujairah\nRoyal M Fujairah, 5 stars hotel adjacent to Fujairah Mall.\n\n## Drink\nThere are no local specialties as far as drink goes, which means that the usual collection of water, juices, tea, coffee and softdrinks are readily available.\nAlcohol is mostly only available within top-quality hotels. Cheaper alternatives include the Fujairah Marine Club on the corniche and Fujairah Beach Motel, which also has a retail \"hole-in-the-wall.\" You'll have to ask as it's hidden away a bit.\nThe best value drinks in town are to be had in the pub at the Tennis and Country Club (go on a Tuesday and you get karaoke too).\n\n## Stay safe\nThe customary cautions regarding drivers in the UAE apply in Fujairah as well. Road rules are understood to exist, but drivers will tend to take risks which would seem borderline-suicidal to many visitors. Most roads are multi-lane in each direction in the city, which may well mean that a taxi or one's own car is the best bet here. Where the taxi meter is either not present or \"not working\", agree on the fare before starting the trip.\n\n## Go next\nA trip to nearby Khor Fakkan (an enclave of Sharjah) is highly recommended, as the beach is regarded as one of the best in the region.\nA drive through the Hajar Mountains (which extend over the border into Oman) may also be enjoyable, however this will require some planning as regards the standard of car to be driven.\nDubai\nOman border is just 30 minutes away by car. You will need to check your Visa requirements in advance.",
