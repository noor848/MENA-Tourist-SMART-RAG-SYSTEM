      "content": "Ras Al Khaimah (Arabic: رَأْس ٱلْخَيْمَة; /raʔs͜ ɪlˈxajma/, Emirati Arabic : [räːs͜ ɪlχe̞ːmɛ] ), often referred to its initials RAK, is an industrial port city and the largest city and capital of the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah in the U.A.E. The city had a population of 191,753 in 2025, and is the sixth-most populous city in UAE after Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Al Ain and Ajman. The city is divided by a creek into two parts: old town in the west and Al Nakheel in the east. The town is the successor to the Islamic era port and trading hub of Julfar.\n\nEtymology\nRas Al Khaimah translates to \"Headland of the Tent\". The Arabic word Khaimah (خَيْمَة) means 'tent', but also refers to the palm frond or areesh houses that were common in the area.\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nRas Al Khaimah has been the site of continuous human habitation for 7,000 years, with archaeological finds dating back to the Neolithic. The northern area of the city today known as Ras Al Khaimah was previously the location of the important Islamic era settlement and port of Julfar. Although Julfar and Ras Al Khaimah are often placed together, they are in fact two different settlements with distinctive histories. Julfar was abandoned in the early 17th Century as Ras Al Khaimah rose. Julfar itself had a predecessor settlement, Kush, today located in suburbs to the north of the city.\nOne of Ras Al Khaimah's most celebrated sons, Ibn Majid, was a hugely influential seaman, navigator and cartographer, and there is evidence in his writing that the town he came from was at that time known as Ras Al Khaimah, that town having eclipsed Julfar as the principal port and settlement of the Shimal coast.\n\n18th to 19th centuries\nIn the early 18th century, the Qawasim (singular Al Qasimi) established themselves in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the Persian and Arabian coasts that frequently came into conflict with British flagged shipping.\nIn the aftermath of a series of attacks against shipping sailing under Omani flags and following 1809 monsoon season, the British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 against Ras Al Khaimah, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Lingeh on the Persian coast which was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi.\nBy the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of their vessels had been destroyed.\nFollowing the 1809 campaign, an 1815 arrangement was made between the British and the Al Qasimi. However, by 1819 it was clear the arrangement had broken down and so in November of that year, the British embarked on a second expedition against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah, led by Major-General William Keir Grant.\nThe force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea for a period of four days, until, on 9 December, the fortress and town of Ras Al Khaimah were stormed and found to be practically deserted. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah.\nThe British landed a force at Rams on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to Dhayah Fort on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon.\n\nThe two 24-pound cannon from HMS Liverpool which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah from the landward side were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from Rams, a journey of some four miles. Each of the guns weighed over 2 tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December.\nIn January 1820, the British imposed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 signed by Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah who was reinstated by the British in Ras Al Khaimah after the deposition of Hassan bin Rahma Al Qasimi. The treaty stipulated the end of piracy and slavery, and laid the foundation for the British protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until December 1st 1971.\n\nBritish protectorate\nA British protectorate from this point forward, as one of the Trucial States, in 1869, Ras Al Khaimah became fully independent from neighbouring Sharjah. From September 1900 to 7 July 1921, it was re-incorporated into Sharjah; the last governor became its next independent ruler.\n\nModern history\nThe last of the Trucial States to join the newly independent United Arab Emirates, on 10 February 1972, Ras Al Khaimah, under the leadership of Sheikh Saqr bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, joined the United Arab Emirates following the Iranian seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.\n\nGeography\nJabal Ghumaylah\n\nClimate\nPopulation\nThe population of the city is around 115,949 (2021), and it is the largest city in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah. It is the 6th most populous city in the UAE.\n\nDistricts\nEducation\nOther than Arabic government-funded schools, the city is home to Ras Al Khaimah Academy,Wellspring School, and other Indian schools. Higher education institutions in the city include the Higher Colleges of Technology, Ras Al Khaimah Medical and Health Sciences University, American University of Ras Al Khaimah and many other colleges.\n\nTransportation\nLand Transport\nThe Ras Al Khaimah Transport Authority currently serves the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah and surrounding areas.\n\nAir Transport\nRas Al Khaimah International Airport serves the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nEconomy\nThe city of Ras Al Khaimah is home to the Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ) that helps connect investors and international markets.

The integrated resort is being established by Wynn Resorts, whose CEO Craig Billings confirmed that it will include a 224,000 sq. ft. “casino component”.

However, the country established the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), in September 2023. The GCGRA granted a “Commercial Gaming Facility Operator” license to Wynn Resorts, in October 2024. Given the country’s Sharia laws, gambling is completely prohibited for local citizens.

AED 200-250, and take about an hour - for better rates avoid the black \"limo\" taxis, and use a cream-coloured \"standard\" taxi.      (updated Feb 2024)\n\n## Understand\nRas al Khaimah means \"headland of the tent\" in English. It is nestled between the Hajjar Mountains on the East and the Persian Gulf on the West and shares mountainous borders with the Musandam Peninsula of Oman. With the completion of the E311 Highway (Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road), RAK is only about one hour from the emirate of Dubai.\nThe Emirate has been in existence since 1708 under the ruling Al Qasimi clan. The Emirate joined the wider United Arab Emirates in 1972 after the Iranian seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands in the Straight of Hormuz.\nThe Emirate Ras al Khaimah combines a fascinating and a relaxing tourist hub with its calm blue seas with clean white beaches, dramatic desert dunes and the majestic Hajjar Mountains. It has numerous fascinating tourist landmarks, beautiful wildlife conservations and sanctuaries. Golf has become one of the leading tourist attractions within the emirate.\n\n## Tourist information\nRas al Khaimah Tourism website\n\n## By plane\n25.61361155.9388891 Ras al Khaimah International Airport (RKT  IATA RAK Airport) (20 minutes from the city centre. To get there, take a metered taxi which should cost you around 30 dirham from the centre. Your hotel may offer airport pick up.), ☏ +971-7-2075200. A few airlines fly from here to the Middle East or Indian subcontinent; the most prominent is Qatar Airways, which transits via Doha. There is a greater choice of flights from nearby Dubai International Airport.\nOther airports are Sharjah (SHJ IATA) 80 km , Dubai (DXB IATA) 90 km and Abu Dhabi (AUH IATA) 240 km from Ras al Khaimah.\n\n## By rail\nThere is no railway system in Ras al Khaimah yet, however a national railway system called Etihad Rail is under development and will connect all the emirates of the UAE.\n\n## By car\nRAK has good road connections with all the other emirates. The Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road (E311) allows reaching Umm al Quwain (UAQ) in half an hour, Sharjah in less than an hour, Dubai in 1–1½ hour (depending on the traffic) and Abu Dhabi in around 2½–3 hours. The old Coastal Road (E11) is slower but takes you directly to Sharjah via UAQ and Ajman. Fujairah can be reached via the mountain passage or via Masafi (E18) in about 1-1½ hour. An alternative to the above is the Emirates Road (E611), which runs parallel to the E311 but avoid running through the centre of Dubai: this may be quicker in some circumstances.\nRas al Khaimah has a border with Oman (Musandam). It is rather easy to enter and exit the country by car.\n\n## By bus\nThe RAK Transport Authority runs buses to Dubai (Union Bus Station), Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Quwain, Abu Dhabi and Al Ain; they also have limited services to Global Village and Dubai Mall. See the RAKTA bus page for information on routes, timetables and fares. Buses to Dubai usually leave hourly during the day.\n\n## By boat\nThere are no passenger boat carriers operating directly to Ras al Khaimah.\n\n## Get around\nPublic transport is governed by the RAK Transport Authority (RAKTA) in the emirates. Taxis from other emirates can cross into RAK for longer journeys. For tourists, getting around with public transport or walking is difficult (to near impossible), and it would be better to go by either taxi or car.\nIn November 2024, RAK run two local bus lines, departing hourly. One from Al Nakheel to Jazeera, that covers the main road parallel to the beach. There is another bus connecting villages to the central bus station. Fare was 8 AED with a plastic card, that costs another 10 AED, or 12 AED cash. Pay at the bus driver. Check the RAKTA website.\nThere are buses to Khasab in Oman only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and now only one bus in the morning. returning from Khasab/Oman in the afternoon. Demand was decreasing, so check if the busses are available.\nA few tour operators (mainly in the international hotels) organize Ras al Khaimah city tours. Most of the big hotels provide buses for their guests to the RAK Old City and shopping malls.\nTaxis are an easy option to move around the emirate. RAKTA licensed taxis use set-fare meters, are reasonable priced and safe. You can find out current charges on the RAKTA page on taxis. As of January 2024, RAKTA suggests using the \"Careem\" app for booking. If you are at a hotel, the concierge will usually be able to summon a taxi for you quickly. Dubai taxis are allowed to ferry passengers back from Dubai to RAK, and the charge to RAK City is around 250-300 AED; be aware of the different types of Dubai taxi - it is more expensive to take the \"limo\" type of taxi rather than a standard taxi, and you have to be careful at taxi stands that you ask for the regular cream coloured taxis for the cheapest rates.\nCar rental is easily available option. Most of the roads in Ras al Khaimah are in good condition and it is easy to find the way around (at least in the city). However, driving can be a challenging experience for those who are not used to slightly chaotic roads.\nInternational car rentals are available in most of the hotels. There are also numerous smaller local companies around the town. You should expect to pay from 150 dirham for a small car per day.\nHeading to Oman? A rental company that rent out cars driving into Oman is Al Salamah Cars at the main branch in Al Nakheel, 120th street. They provide all the necessary papers, like the \"no-objection-letter\" (extra charge), that you need to cross the border. Insurance for Oman can be bought at the border crossing.\nWalking around Ras al Khaimah is not easy due to the traffic, lack of sidewalks and zebra crossings and it is something not done and not recommended. For a pleasure walk, Corniche Road and beaches are the best and safest option.\nRAKTA operates intra- and inter-city buses. See the RAKTA website page on buses to get details on routes, timings and prices. The RAKTA buses tend to intersect at the Al Nakheel area of RAK City (Plus code: QXWC+H6 Ras Al-Khaimah), near Manar Mall.\n\n## See\nRas al Khaimah Old City - the oldest residential area in the city of Ras al Khaimah with an old souq, old mosque, fishing harbour and Al Hisn Fort, which now host RAK National Museum.\n25.79451455.9450321 Ras al Khaimah National Museum. the RAK National Museum is situated in Al Hisn Fort.
