The multi-phase eco-tourism development is intended in future to comprise accommodation, a campsite and an astronomical observatory, with a total investment of some UAE Dhs 250 million. It will also include the development of a 450 km desert park. The centre was developed by the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq).\n\nVisitor facilities and lodge\nVisitor facilities at the archaeological centre include a café and a range of guided excursions.\nTours are offered from the Centre to nearby attractions, including the popular 'Fossil Rock', or Jebel Mleiha. A range of horse-riding activities target beginners as well as advanced riders. The centre has an education outreach program and also offers discovery packages for families, as well as hosting groups and corporate events.\nCurrently under development at the centre site, the Al Faya Lodge is a small collection of luxury hotel rooms with a café, pool and spa, based around outbuildings first constructed in the 1960s. The Lodge forms part of 'The Sharjah Collection', a range of boutique hospitality locations managed by Mantis Hotels, a joint venture between Shurooq and Mantis Hospitality.\nOne of a number of innovations being deployed to maintain the eco-tourism aspect of the centre is 'spray on roads'.\nThe centre is open to the public weekdays from 9am-7pm and weekends (Thursday, Friday) from 9am-9pm.\n\nSee also\nList of Ancient Settlements in the UAE\nArchaeology of the United Arab Emirates\nIron Age in the United Arab Emirates\n\n\n== References ==",
