Other remains include settlements, tombs, and a falaj dating from the Iron Age. Some of the site is located outside the park in a protected area. Finds from the site can be seen in the Al Ain National Museum in central Al Ain. The Hili Grand Tomb is a tower measuring 12 m (39 ft) in diameter that has been reconstructed. The tombs belong to the Umm al-Nar culture.\n\nIn May 2019 the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism reported that fingerprints about 3000 years old were found at Hili II. They apparently belonged to craftsmen who constructed a wall at the site.\n\nSee also\nAl Ain Oasis\nTawam (region)\nAl-Buraimi\nArchaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn\nHafit period\nIbri\nList of Ancient Settlements in the UAE\nQattara Oasis\nRumailah, UAE\n\n\n== References ==",
