The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (Arabic: جَامِع ٱلشَّيْخ زَايِد ٱلْكَبِيْر Jāmiʿ Aš-Šaykh Zāyid Al-Kabīr) is a mosque located in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. It is the country's largest mosque, and is the key place of worship for daily Islamic prayers. There is a smaller replica of this mosque in Surakarta, a city in Indonesia.
The Grand Mosque was constructed between 1994 and 2007 and was inaugurated in December 2007. The building complex measures approximately 290 by 420 m (950 by 1,380 ft), covering an area of more than 12 hectares (30 acres), excluding exterior landscaping and vehicle parking. The main axis of the building is rotated about 12° south of true west, aligning it in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
The project was launched by the late president of the U.A.E., Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who wanted to establish a structure that would unite the cultural diversity of the Islamic world with the historical and modern values of architecture and art. In 2004, Sheikh Zayed died and was buried in the courtyard of the mosque.
Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center (SZGMC) offices are located in the west minarets. SZGMC manages the day-to-day operations and serves as a center of learning and discovery through its educational cultural activities and visitor programs. The library, located in the northeast minaret, serves the community with classic books and publications addressing a range of Islamic subjects: sciences, civilization, calligraphy, the arts, and coins, including some rare publications. The collection comprises material in a broad range of languages, including Arabic, English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Korean. For two years running, it was voted the world's second favourite landmark by TripAdvisor.
The Grand Mosque has been a significant destination for visiting foreign leaders during official state visits to the UAE. Notable visitors include Elizabeth II, the then US Vice President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Design and construction
The mosque was built under the guidance and supervision of Sheikh Zayed, who was buried here after his death in 2004. It features 82 domes, more than 1,000 columns, 24-carat-gold gilded chandeliers and the world's largest hand-knotted carpet. The main prayer hall is dominated by one of the largest chandeliers. The mosque was designed under the management of the Syrian architect Youssef Abdelke, and three other architectural designers from Syria who completed the design and worked on developing it, Basem Barghouti, Moataz Al-Halabi, and Imad Malas.
The mosque's architect Yusef Abdelki  took inspiration from a number of sources: the Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Alexandria, designed by Mario Rossi in the 1920s; the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan; and other references of Persian, Mughal, and Indo-Islamic architecture. The dome layout and floorplan of the mosque was inspired by the Badshahi Mosque. Its archways are quintessentially Moorish, and its minarets classically Arab.
In a joint-venture between Italian contractors Impregilo and Rizzani de Eccher, more than 3,000 workers and 38 sub-contracting companies were conscripted in its construction. The mosque was completed under a second contract by a Joint Venture between ACC and Six Construct (part of Belgian company BESIX Group) between 2004 and 2007. Natural materials were chosen for much of its design and construction due to their long-lasting qualities, including marble stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals and ceramics. Artisans and materials came from many countries including Syria, especially from Damascus and Aleppo, and some other countries such as India, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, China, United Kingdom, New Zealand, North Macedonia and the U.A.E. The intricate flower mosaics decorating the courtyard was designed by the British artist Kevin Dean, who embraced Sheikh Zayed’s passionate vision to create a mosque that unites the world, as he chose flowers from the Middle East, such as Tulips, Lilys, and Irises. As inlays of colored marble form exuberant floral patterns that curl and twist gracefully from the edges towards the center adorn the courtyard. While the rest of the Sahan was inlaid with thousands of small pieces of white marble.

Dimensions and statistics
The mosque is large enough to accommodate over 40,100 worshippers, while the main prayer hall can hold over 7,000. There are two smaller prayer halls, with a capacity of 1,500 each, one of which is the women's prayer hall.
There are four minarets on the four corners of the courtyard which rise about 107 m (351 ft) in height. The courtyard, with its floral design, measures about 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft), and is considered to be the largest example of marble mosaic in the world. The exterior and interior are adorned with white marble, giving the mosque a serene and majestic appearance. The marble is inlaid with precious stones like lapis lazuli, carnelian, amethyst, abalone shell, and mother of pearl.
Marble used in the construction included:

Sivec from Prilep, North Macedonia was used on the external cladding (115,119 m2 (1,239,130 sq ft) of cladding has been used on the mosque, including the minarets)
Lasa from Laas, South Tyrol, Italy was used in the internal elevations
Makrana from Makrana, India was used in the annexes and offices
Acquabianca and Bianco P from Italy
East White and Ming Green from China
To compare, the King Faisal Mosque of Sharjah, formerly the largest mosque in Sharjah and country, measures 10,000–12,000 m2 (110,000–130,000 sq ft).

Architectural features
The carpet in the hall is considered by many  to be the world's largest carpet made by Iran's Carpet Company and designed by Iranian artist Ali Khaliqi. It measures 5,627 m2 (60,570 sq ft), and was made by around 1,200-1,300 carpet knotters. The weight of this carpet is 35 ton and is predominantly made from wool (originating from New Zealand and Iran). There are 2,268,000,000 knots within the carpet and it took approximately two years to complete.
The Grand Mosque has seven imported chandeliers from the company Faustig in Munich, Germany that incorporate millions of Swarovski crystals. The largest chandelier is the second largest known chandelier inside a mosque, the third largest in the world, and has a 10 m (33 ft) diameter and a 15 m (49 ft) height.
The pools along the arcades reflect the mosque's columns, which become illuminated at night. The unique lighting system was designed by lighting architects Speirs and Major Associates to reflect the phases of the moon. Beautiful bluish gray clouds are projected in lights onto the external walls and get brighter and darker according to the phase of the moon.
The 96 columns in the main prayer hall are clad with marble and inlaid with mother of pearl, one of the few places where one can see this craftsmanship.
The 99 names (qualities or attributes) of God (Allah) are featured on the Qibla wall in traditional Kufic calligraphy, designed by the prominent UAE calligrapher — Mohammed Mandi Al Tamimi. The Qibla wall also features subtle fibre-optic lighting, which is integrated as part of the organic design.
In total, three calligraphy styles — Naskhi, Thuluth and Kufic — are used throughout the mosque and were drafted by Mohammed Mandi Al Tamimi of the UAE, Farouk Haddad of Syria and Mohammed Allam of Jordan.

The Louvre Abu Dhabi (Arabic: اللوفر أبوظبي, romanized: al-lūfr ʔabū ẓaby; French: Louvre Abou Dabi) is an art museum located on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It runs under an agreement between the UAE and France, signed in March 2007, that allows it to use the Louvre's name until 2047, and has been described by the Louvre as "France's largest cultural project abroad." It is approximately 24,000 square metres (260,000 sq ft) in size, with 8,000 square metres (86,000 sq ft) of galleries, making it the largest art museum in the Arabian Peninsula. Artworks from around the world are showcased at the museum, with stated intent to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western art. Louvre Abu Dhabi is one of the first completed projects of the Saadiyat Cultural District, which Abu Dhabi intends to develop into "a leading destination for art, history and culture."
By 2019, the Louvre Abu Dhabi had already attracted 2 million visitors, making it the most visited museum in the Arab world.

Location
The museum is part of a US$27 billion tourist and cultural development for Saadiyat Island, planned to house a cluster of world-class cultural assets.
In addition to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, these are to include: the Zayed National Museum, on a design by Foster and Partners; the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi contemporary arts museum by Frank Gehry, expected to be the world's largest Guggenheim; a performing arts centre designed by Dame Zaha Hadid; a maritime museum with concept design by Tadao Ando; and a number of arts pavilions. The Abrahamic Family House was later added to the cluster, with completion expected in 2022.

History
Project development
In 2005 the United Arab Emirates put forward to the French government the idea of creating a museum in the Emirates bearing the name of the Louvre. Discussions were initiated in June 2005, when an Abu Dhabi delegation led by Sultan bin Tahnoon al-Nahyan, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture & Heritage visited Paris and met counterparts at the Louvre. A month later, another delegation including Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, then Minister of Information and Culture of the United Arab Emirates, discussed the project with interlocutors in the French government, including Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy and Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres. Also in the summer of 2005, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan sent a letter about the project to France's president Jacques Chirac. Formal negotiations on the project between the two countries started in the summer of 2006.
Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi authorities in 2006 selected Jean Nouvel, known among other projects for having designed the Arab World Institute in Paris, as the building's architect. They initially commissioned his firm to design a generic museum of classical art or civilisation, without specific reference to the Louvre while discussions with the French authorities were still ongoing. The choice of Nouvel had been first suggested by Thomas Krens, then the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and adviser to Abu Dhabi on the development of Saadiyat Island.
The negotiations and the project itself were publicly revealed by French daily Le Monde in September 2006. The project initially generated controversy, including an op-ed and petition against it by curators Françoise Cachin, Jean Clair and Roland Recht.
Louvre director Henri Loyrette was also reported to have initially opposed the project, which in the early phase he did not defend or promote publicly. But the Louvre's position became more favorable in the course of the contract negotiation, as it managed to secure significant benefits for itself.
The agreement detailing the partnership and licensing arrangements was signed on 6 March 2007 by respective representatives of the French and UAE governments. That agreement was ratified by the French Parliament on 9 October 2007, after Jacques Chirac had been replaced as French President by Nicolas Sarkozy. Even after leaving the presidency, Chirac remained a major supporter of the project.
When announced in 2007, the museum was expected to open in 2012. On 29 October 2011, the project managing agency, Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC), announced that the museum's opening would be delayed but gave no new date.
According to the UAE newspapers Gulf News and The National, the delay came from a review of the emirate's economic strategy. In January 2012 it was announced that the Louvre Abu Dhabi's opening date would be 2015.

Construction
Construction works at Louvre Abu Dhabi officially started on 26 May 2009. The piling and enabling works package was awarded to the German specialized company Bauer International FZE; the total of 4536 piles in steel and reinforced concrete were completed on 3 August 2010.
Construction on the main phase of the museum began in early 2013 by a consortium headed by Arabtec, Constructora San José and Oger Abu Dhabi, under a $653 million contract. This stage included waterproofing and the two basement levels, along with four concrete pillars that will support the 7,000-tonne dome. Work on the construction of the gallery spaces and initial preparation for the dome began in the fourth quarter of 2013. On 5 December 2013, the first element of the museum's canopy was lifted into place. On 17 March 2014 TDIC announced the completion of the first permanent gallery structure to mark the first anniversary of the start of construction. At this time, it was claimed that a total of ten million man hours had been worked and 120,538 cubic meters of concrete used. On 22 September 2014, the final super-sized element in the canopy was fitted in place, marking a significant milestone in the museum's construction phase. In October, The Tourism & Development Investment Company announced that the Louvre Abu Dhabi was more than 50 percent complete.

Prefiguration exhibitions
The Louvre Abu Dhabi first started sharing its collection with the public through an exhibition at the Gallery One of the Emirates Palace, entitled "Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi." It was inaugurated by Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Nicolas Sarkozy on 26 May 2009, the same day as the construction work officially started on Saadiyat Island. The exhibition presented the first 19 acquisitions for the institution, including a Mamluk Quran from the 14th century, a 5th-century Fibula from Domagnano, a Virgin and Child by Bellini, and Mondrian's Composition with blue, red, yellow and black from 1922.
A second exhibition, "Birth of a Museum", opened at the exhibition space Manarat Al Saadiyat in May 2013, ending in August that year. The first large-scale preview of the collection, it featured 130 works acquired by the government of Abu Dhabi for the permanent collection. They included a never-before-seen work by Picasso, a Bronze Age terracotta statue from Cyprus, along with artifacts from Greece, Turkey, Japan and Syria.
In May 2014, the Birth of a Museum exhibition, featuring works shown in Abu Dhabi and a number of new acquisitions, opened at the Louvre in Paris. A number of new works were presented, including Chirisei Kyubiki by the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga and painted in 1960.

Inauguration and aftermath
The museum was eventually inaugurated on 8 November 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince (and de facto ruler) Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and UAE Prime Minister and Emir of Dubai Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Other personalities present at the inauguration included Mohammed VI of Morocco and President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani. The museum was opened to the public three days later. It welcomed more than one million visitors in its first full year of operations, of which 30-40 percent were UAE residents and 60-70 percent from abroad (mainly France, Germany, China, the UK, the US, India and the GCC countries); this made it the 77th most visited museum worldwide in 2018.
In November 2019, the waterfront boulevard on which the museum is located on the eastern end of Saadiyat Island was named after former French President Jacques Chirac, in recognition of his role in the project and more generally in the development of links between France and the UAE.
In February 2020, a Fouquet's restaurant opened as the main catering amenity inside the museum, with a menu created in partnership with celebrity chef Pierre Gagnaire.

Design
Architecture
During the initial Concept Design phase in 2006-2007, Jean Nouvel and his team designed the museum as a "seemingly floating dome structure"; its web-patterned dome allowing the sun to filter through. The overall effect is meant to represent "rays of sunlight passing through date palm fronds in an oasis." The total area of the museum will be approximately 24,000 square metres (260,000 sq ft). The permanent collection will occupy 6,000 square metres (65,000 sq ft), and the temporary exhibitions will take place over 2,000 square metres (22,000 sq ft).

Engineering
The engineers were BuroHappold Engineering, who provided multidisciplinary engineering services across the project. Their structural engineers realised the "floating dome" from 7,850 aluminium stars of varying sizes, which tessellate over eight layers to create a perforated roof structure that allows sunlight through to the spaces below. A team of specialist geotechnical and water engineers designed a watertight basement and tidal pools within the galleries to give the illusion of a "museum in the sea" while protecting artwork, artefacts and visitors from the corrosive marine environment. Guests who visit the museum can discover the 55 buildings of which 23 are art galleries and are constructed to look like the low-rise home of the region.

Wayfinding
The three-languages wayfinding system for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoke typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font. The design of the pictograms was inspired by the museum's architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the dome. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.

Public art
Two works of public art have been commissioned for the building's opening:

A monumental sculpture in white limestone from Marbella by American artist Jenny Holzer, in one of the building courtyards covered by the dome, with large-scale engraved facsimiles of excerpts from texts in three different scripts: a bilingual Sumerian and Akkadian creation myth (ca. 2000 BCE), in Cuneiform, from a clay tablet held at the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin; Muqaddimah, by Ibn Khaldun (14th century), in Arabic and Arabic script, from a manuscript held at the Atif Efendi Library in Istanbul; and Michel de Montaigne's Essays in French (16th century), in Latin script, from a printed version held at the Bordeaux municipal library with handwritten annotations by the author.
Germination, an installation by Giuseppe Penone in three parts: Leaves of Light, a tall bronze tree under the dome; Propagation, a panel of concentric circles in porcelain that is based on the fingerprint of UAE founding father Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan; and Earth of the World, a composition in pottery using various clays all sourced in the UAE.

Permanent collections
Questions have been raised as to the nature of the artworks to be displayed at the museum. However, according to The National: "the type and nature of the exhibits planned for the Louvre Abu Dhabi have been affected to no extent by the fact the new museum would be in a Muslim country, said Mr. Loyrette."

Subjects and themes have been freely discussed with our partners in Abu Dhabi and no request to avoid such subjects has been made. The exhibition policy will be set up regarding excellence and high-standard quality. As a new museum we hope the Louvre Abu Dhabi will be part of the international community.
It has been noted that the museum will showcase work from multiple French museums, including the Louvre, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Musée d'Orsay and Palace of Versailles. However, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, the French Minister of Culture, stated at the announcement that the Paris Louvre "would not sell any of its 35,000-piece collection currently on display".

It will not be dedicated to occidental art but will show all kinds of artistic creations. It will set up a dialogue between west and east, between north and south. As such, art from the Middle East will be shown within the Louvre Abu Dhabi.
In 2012, the Louvre Abu Dhabi started collecting photography, making its first acquisitions in the field, including works by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, Roger Fenton and George Wilson Bridges. The museum also acquired a sculpture of a Bactrian princess dating from the third millennium BC, a pavement and fountain set from the early Ottoman period, as well as the paintings Breton Boys Wrestling (1888) by Paul Gauguin and The Subjugated Reader (1928) by René Magritte.
Further details of the museum's collection on opening were revealed in October 2014, with a number of important works to be loaned including Leonardo da Vinci's La Belle Ferronnière and works by Henri Matisse, a self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh, Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps and Claude Monet's Gare Saint-Lazare.
The Museum tweeted 8 December 2017 that it was looking forward to displaying the Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci. The work was acquired, at a record price for a painting, by the Department of Culture & Tourism of Abu Dhabi for the museum. No date was set for the display of this work but in September 2018, the unveiling was indefinitely postponed and a January 2019 news report indicated that "no one knows where it is, and there are grave concerns for its physical safety".

Selected exhibits from the Louvre Abu Dhabi's permanent collection
Legal basis, management and programs
The Louvre Abu Dhabi is a national museum of the UAE, overseen by the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism. As of 2019, half of the museum's staff were UAE nationals.
Whereas the Louvre Abu Dhabi is an Emirati entity separate from the Louvre in Paris, the two are linked by a thirty-year agreement that was signed in March 2007 by the two governments and covers a number of areas, including the license of the Louvre name until 2037. The text of the agreement was published by the French authorities for its parliamentary ratification. That agreement foresaw the establishment by the French side of a private-sector project entity, which was subsequently incorporated on 23 August 2007 and named Agence France-Muséums (AFM). AFM's shareholders include the Louvre, with over a third of equity capital, and a number of other French cultural institutions: the Musée du Quai Branly, Centre Pompidou, Musée d'Orsay, National Estate of Versailles, Guimet Museum, Musée Rodin, Château de Chambord, Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Opérateur du patrimoine et des projets immobiliers de la culture, École du Louvre and Bibliothèque nationale de France. The Musée de Cluny and Palace of Fontainebleau, while not shareholders of AFM, have also been among the project's beneficiaries.
AFM was initially chaired by French financier and philanthropist Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière and led by Bruno Maquart, former head of the Centre Georges Pompidou, as its Executive Director. In January 2008, AFM and Ministry of Culture Christine Albanel signed another agreement with Sultan bin Tahnoon al-Nahyan, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture & Heritage.
Under the March 2007 agreement, Abu Dhabi is to pay the following: €400 million for the use of the Louvre name,  €190 million for art loans (ending in 2027), €75 million for special exhibitions (ending in 2032), €165 million for management advice and support, and €25 million for naming a space inside the Louvre in Paris after UAE founding father Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.  With inflation taken into account, a French Senate report in 2017 estimated the total amount of payments over the duration of the contract (2007–2037) at €974.5 million. As of 2017 (included), according to the French Senate, the cumulated payments had reached €477 million, broadly in line with the initial agreement's provisions despite the delays in project execution.
The March 2007 agreement prohibits the creation of any similar operation with the name of the Louvre in any of the other emirates of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, or Iraq.
The space to be named after the UAE founding father was initially expected to be in a refurbished part of the Pavillon de Flore that was to display international art, but that project was later abandoned and the Sheikh Zayed Center eventually opened in 2016 as a set of three rooms in the Pavillon de l'Horloge dedicated to the history of the Louvre Palace.
In the project's early years, frictions appeared between the various French stakeholders, partly over the sharing of roughly half of total payments (€420 million in total) that were not unambiguously directed at the Louvre. The conflicts led to the departure of AFM's first director Bruno Maquart in 2010, who was not immediately replaced. Manuel Rabaté, formerly a senior administrator at the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris, was the agency's general secretary from 2010 to 2013, then chief executive from 2013 to 2016, and in September 2016 was appointed the Louvre Abu Dhabi's first director. Also in September 2016, Hissa Al Dhaheri, a UAE national, was appointed the museum's deputy director; she had joined the project team in 2010.
The Louvre Abu Dhabi has also been working with the Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi to set up a master's program for museum professionals to train them and help them respond to local needs. It also runs an ambassadors programme, where representatives include poet Shamma Al Bastaki. It has developed a number of outreach initiatives to engage with new publics, including a Children's Museum, a roadside "Highway Gallery" on the Dubai-Abu Dhabi expressway, and kayaking tours around the museum building.
In 2023, the term of the March 2007 agreement was extended from 2037 to 2047.

Influence
In a late-2021 joint interview, Louvre President-Director Laurence des Cars and Centre Pompidou President Laurent Le Bon, both recently appointed to their positions, cited the Louvre Abu Dhabi as "the great model" for their planned endeavor to develop more initiatives in common between their respective institutions and the Musée d'Orsay, taking inspiration from the Abu Dhabi museum's seamless chronological approach across geographies, and moving away from the ring-fencing of different eras between the Louvre (pre-1848), Orsay (1848-1914) and Pompidou (after 1914).

Controversies
Motivations for the project
The museum has sparked opposition to the expansion of the Louvre name in both artistic and academic circles in France. The opposition that has surfaced in France is led by art historian Didier Rykner, who is considered one of the most outspoken critics of the French–Emirati museum deal. An online petition against the deal, signed by 4,650 curators, archaeologists and art historians, has insisted that French museums are not for sale. Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, characterized the Louvre as behaving "like a corporation with a clearly-defined strategy: profit maximization."
According to the New York Times, Henri Loyrette, the president and director of the Louvre, responded to the criticism of the museum's policy of establishing footholds abroad, arguing that the Louvre cannot ignore the "internationalization" of museums. French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, defended the French government's decision to expand the Louvre to Abu Dhabi, explaining that it helps to enhance the image of France abroad while investing in French culture through revenues generated by the deal. The United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan stated that the museum is a milestone in international cooperation and strengthens longstanding friendly ties between France and the United Arab Emirates.

Treatment of construction workers
Human Rights Watch reported issues during construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi including the confiscation of workers passports resulting in forced labour conditions. High "recruitment loans" paid by migrant workers to construction companies still had not been repaid as of 2019, according to government-paid monitors. 86% of these fees were over $2,000. The Human Rights Watch report welcomed improvements in the law made by the UAE since their previous report in 2009 such as the introduction of minimum standards for workers accommodation. Amid these reports, Jean Nouvel, the architect of Louvre Abu Dhabi defended the treatment of the construction workers, claiming that the conditions of construction workers were better than some European countries.

Western curatorial bias
The museum has been criticized for not fulfilling its stated intent of balancing western and eastern cultural and artistic perspectives, particularly in its collections of modern and contemporary art which exhibit a marked European focus. This bias, however, may erode over time as loans from French museums are gradually replaced by purchases made by the Louvre Abu Dhabi on its own.

Le Louvre Abou Dabi (en arabe : اللوفر أبو ظبي), ou Louvre Abu Dhabi selon la translittération retenue par le musée dans ses publications officielles en français, est un musée fondé en 2017.
Inauguré le 8 novembre 2017 et ouvert au public le 11 novembre, ce musée, dépendant du musée du Louvre et installé dans une architecture confiée à l'architecte français Jean Nouvel, est créé après un accord intergouvernemental signé le 6 mars 2007 entre la France et l'émirat d'Abou Dabi. Ce musée est une composante d'un district culturel en cours de construction sur l'île de Saadiyat où il doit côtoyer trois autres musées, toujours en travaux, notamment le Guggenheim Abou Dabi ainsi qu'une antenne de l'université de New York, un palace et des résidences de luxe.

Histoire
Origine du projet
Dans le cadre de la création d'un district culturel sur l'île de Saadiyat (« île du bonheur ») à Abou Dabi, le gouvernement des Émirats arabes unis s'est tourné vers la France pour la réalisation et le développement d'un musée universel.
Le projet est initié par Abdallah ben Zayed Al Nahyane, ministre de la Culture et de la communication qui souhaite « un Louvre comme au Louvre de Paris, avec des nus, des christs, des artistes juifs, des miniatures persanes, tous ces chefs-d'œuvre qui font l'admiration du monde. ». Il le présente à l'émir Khalifa ben Zayed Al Nahyane et au prince héritier Mohammed ben Zayed Al Nahyane, qui l'approuvent, en partie par intérêt géopolitique.
En juin 2005, des discussions sont engagées entre l’Émirat et Henri Loyrette, directeur du Louvre, réticent au projet, puis avec Philippe Douste-Blazy, ministre des Affaires étrangères au sein du gouvernement de Dominique de Villepin.

Partenariat culturel
« Enthousiasmé » par le projet, le président Jacques Chirac conclut quelques mois avant la fin de son mandat un accord intergouvernemental qui sera co-signé, le 6 mars 2007 par Sultan ben Tahnoun Al Nahyane et Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, ministre de la Culture. Cet accord organise une opération de coopération culturelle sur trente ans et prévoit que le musée portera le nom de Louvre Abou Dabi.
Le projet architectural revient à Jean Nouvel, concepteur du musée du quai Branly.
La France est chargée d'une mission de conseil dans les domaines de la conception et la réalisation du bâtiment et est chargée de l'élaboration du projet scientifique et culturel du musée. À partir de l'ouverture du musée et pour les dix années suivantes, le Louvre Abou Dabi recevra en prêt des œuvres issues des collections françaises : 300 dans les premières années, puis 250 et 200. De même, pendant quinze ans, la France fournira annuellement au Louvre Abou Dabi quatre expositions. Enfin, elle aidera le musée à se constituer une collection propre destinée à remplacer les œuvres prêtées par les musées français.
Les Émirats arabes unis (EAU) se sont engagés à verser des contreparties de l'ordre de 965 millions d'euros sur trente ans, qui bénéficieront au musée du Louvre et aux autres musées partenaires de l'opération. Pour mettre en œuvre cet accord de coopération culturelle, la France a créé une structure spécifique, l'Agence France-Muséums dont sont actionnaires douze des principaux établissements culturels français.
En 2021, l'accord intergouvernemental est prolongé de 10 ans, jusqu'en 2047. A cette occasion, le Louvre s'engage à prêter quatre de ses œuvres emblématiques.

Construction
Après 5 mois de chantier et la pose de 4 536 pieux, l'entreprise allemande Bauer International a terminé fin août 2010 les travaux de fondation du musée. Le cabinet britannique d'ingénierie Buro Happold a veillé à l'étanchéité, le musée étant construit sur une île. Selon le promoteur gouvernemental Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC), le musée de 24 000 m2 avec sa coupole ajourée de 180 m de diamètre imaginée par les Ateliers Jean Nouvel à Paris devait ouvrir en 2015. La coupole est composée de 7 850 étoiles en aluminium et acier inoxydable qui laissent passer la lumière naturelle et forment selon Jean Nouvel une pluie de lumière inspirée directement des palmeraies et des souks arabes. Le musée dispose d'un espace de 6 000m2 pour les expositions permanentes et 2 000m2 pour les expositions temporaires.
Le 29 octobre 2011, TDIC, le maître d'ouvrage du musée, annonce une révision du calendrier de construction, sans fournir de nouvelle échéance. Plusieurs hypothèses sont avancées pour expliquer ce retard, notamment une réorientation des priorités d'investissement du gouvernement d'Abou Dabi. En réalité, la révision du chantier serait due à des retards dans l'installation de la coupole et la mise en eau des canaux que surplombe le bâtiment.

Inauguration et ouverture
Ayant pris plusieurs années de retard, le musée ouvre ses portes au public le 11 novembre 2017. L'inauguration officielle, à laquelle participe le président français Emmanuel Macron, a eu lieu le 8 novembre. 400 invités y sont conviés. Sont aussi présents à cette occasion Mohammed VI, roi du Maroc ainsi qu'Ashraf Ghani, le président afghan. L'ouverture est suivie d'une semaine de festivités et de débats avec les directeurs des musées venus du monde entier. Cette semaine de festivités débute par un spectacle intitulé « Vives Réflexions », performance audiovisuelle imaginée par le Groupe F.

Acquisitions
Depuis début 2009, le Louvre Abou Dabi a commencé à acquérir des œuvres pour sa collection permanente. La collection compte actuellement environ six cents œuvres de l'Antiquité au XXIe siècle. En 2020, le musée ajoute 27 nouvelles œuvres à sa collection : deux bronzes d'Auguste Rodin, 25 estampes japonaises des XVIIIe et XIXe siècles, un chef-d’œuvre de Chagall, deux tableaux de Georges de La Tour.

En 2018, dans le cadre du mois de l'innovation aux Émirats arabes unis, une exposition d'un genre nouveau est organisée par le Louvre Abu Dhabi qui met en place sa « Highway Gallery » radiophonique (Galerie de l'Autoroute radioguidée). Dix œuvres sont exposées sur des panneaux d’affichage de 8 × 6 mètres déployés le long de la route reliant Dubaï à Abu Dhabi. La société Abu Dhabi Media, par l'intermédiaire de 3 stations de radio (Radio 1 FM, Classic FM, Emarat FM) diffuse automatiquement une histoire de 30 secondes sur chaque œuvre lorsque les voyageurs approchent des panneaux.
A ce propos, Noura Al Kaabi, ministre de la Culture des Emirats Arabes Unis, déclare : « Cette exposition place Abu Dhabi sur la carte des innovations mondiales en matière d’art, de culture et d’information ».

Fréquentation
Un point sur la fréquentation du musée est établi dans le rapport d'activité et permet de mesurer l'évolution du nombre de visiteurs.
Fréquentation cumulée du musée depuis son ouverture :

En 2019, le musée franchit la barre des 2 millions de visiteurs. Pour fêter cela, il organise de nombreuses manifestations comme l'exposition Dix mille ans de luxe en partenariat avec le musée des Arts décoratifs de Paris ou la performance du L.A. Dance Project de Benjamin Millepied.

Critiques
Partenariat culturel
L'accord a suscité une controverse, menée par l'ancienne directrice du musée d'Orsay Françoise Cachin, qui a cosigné le 13 décembre 2006, avec Jean Clair et Roland Recht dans Le Monde, une tribune contre le projet, ensuite relayée par une pétition, signée par plus de 5 000 personnes, dont de nombreux historiens de l'art, universitaires et conservateurs. Pour elle, la participation du Louvre à ce « Las Vegas des sables » est une « dérive terrible de l'éthique du travail des musées ». En réponse à cette polémique, Jack Lang, dans un article paru dans Le Monde du 1er février 2007, a pris position en faveur d'un projet qui témoigne de la reconnaissance, dit-il, du « talent français » dans les pays arabes.
L'organisation du fonctionnement du futur Louvre Abou Dabi pouvait poser néanmoins des problèmes de déontologie aux musées français et à leurs conservateurs. Ceux-ci, chargés du projet au sein de l'Agence France-Muséums doivent conseiller les autorités d’Abou Dabi pour des acquisitions dont l'intérêt peut être en concurrence directe avec l'enrichissement des collections françaises, qui n'ont pas les mêmes moyens que l'émirat. Il peut y avoir un risque de conflit d'intérêts culturel au sein même de l'institution Louvre, mais Jean-Luc Martinez, président directeur de l'établissement public, estime que « si, en principe, sur le papier, ces réserves sont légitimes, la réalité est bien différente ».
De plus, étant donné le régime politique des EAU, la collection constituée est privée, appartenant à l'émir d’Abou Dabi, le cheikh Khalifa. Or, selon le droit français, les conservateurs de musée travaillent pour le patrimoine national.
L'accord de 2007, d'une durée de trente ans, prévoyait entre autres que l'Agence France-Muséums apportait le nom du « Louvre ». En 2019, la Cour des comptes signale que le musée du Louvre a été financièrement lésé par Abu Dhabi : Gilles Johanet dénonce les irrégularités de l'accord commercial avec le musée émirien, au total défavorable au musée francais. L'exploitation commerciale du nom du Musée du Louvre n'a jamais été soumise à autorisation et n'a jamais donné lieu à rémunération.

Construction et droit du travail
En 2012, cinq années après la signature du contrat, le chantier n'avait toujours pas démarré. Les retards accumulés étaient tels que, ajoutés à la crise financière, le projet était sur le point d'échouer, selon le journaliste Vincent Noce. Dans le quotidien français Libération, il a révélé un courrier daté du 15 février 2012 du cheikh Sultan, patron de l'autorité du développement touristique et de la culture (TDIC), au président d'alors du Louvre, Henri Loyrette, s'inquiétant d'une « dérive significative » du projet. Il déplorait notamment les carences dans le « transfert de compétences » de la part de l'équipe française et estimait que le manque de concertation dans les acquisitions d'une collection, décrite par le journaliste comme purement « européocentriste », avait atteint un point critique. En 2011, l’Émirat a même cessé un temps de verser sa redevance au Louvre, pourtant due au titre des dispositions contractuelles. Libération a en même temps révélé que l’Émirat avait versé 25 millions d'euros pour la restauration du pavillon de Flore au Louvre, censé accueillir des galeries dont un étage porterait le nom du cheikh Zayed, fondateur des Émirats. La somme a été encaissée, mais le projet a été abandonné par le ministère de la Culture, qui n'a pas osé déménager les ateliers de restauration installés dans cette aile. À la suite des difficultés que rencontre ce projet, les principaux membres de la direction scientifique, dont Henri Loyrette, Laurence des Cars et Olivier Gabet, quittent l'agence France-Muséums en 2013. Jean-Luc Martinez prend la succession de Henri Loyrette et se rend par deux fois dans l'Émirat pour rétablir le dialogue. Il est secondé dans cette démarche par Vincent Pomarède, directeur du département des peintures du Louvre. L'anthropologue Jean-François Charnier intègre cette seconde équipe et donne une nouvelle impulsion à ce projet.
Par ailleurs, les organisations non gouvernementales critiquent les abus concernant le droit du travail liés à la construction du musée — problèmes récurrents dans les EAU, et particulièrement prégnants dans la construction de Dubaï. Ainsi, Human Rights Watch (HRW) a documenté les violations des droits des travailleurs migrants œuvrant à la construction de l'île de Saadiyat (« île du bonheur »). Dans son rapport de mai 2009 intitulé « “L'Île du bonheur” : Exploitation des travailleurs migrants sur l'île de Saadiyat, Abou Dabi », HRW révèle que les travailleurs indiens, bengalis, etc., sont régulièrement abusés par des compagnies de recrutement dans leurs pays d'origine, qui leur demandent des frais exorbitants de recrutement et leur font de fausses promesses de salaires élevés. Ces travailleurs sont ensuite aux prises d'un système de « parrainage » (kafala) mis en place par des employeurs qu'ils ne peuvent quitter sans risquer d'être renvoyés dans leur pays d'origine. En dépit d'une loi qui l'interdit, leurs passeports sont confisqués par ces employeurs. Ils ne peuvent négocier collectivement, et le droit de grève n'est pas reconnu aux EAU.
HRW a donc appelé les institutions internationales qui auront des annexes sur l'île de Saadiyat, dont le Louvre, à obtenir des garanties des autorités émiraties pour qu'elles respectent — selon les standards internationaux — les droits des travailleurs qui construiront ces bâtiments de renommée internationale.

Enjeux politiques et géopolitiques
Le musée est un outil géopolitique pour resserrer les liens entre l'Orient et une puissance mondiale occidentale : la France.
Il est, selon l'Elysée, « un vecteur de rayonnement de la France à l'étranger et de ses valeurs d'universalisme. »
Pour le politologue Alexandre Kazerouni, ce musée participe à la « clientélisation des élites culturelles occidentales » au détriment de la classe moyenne émergente du pays, devenant ainsi « un symbole du resserrement autoritaire des Émirats arabes unis ».

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Qasr Al Hosn (Arabic: قصر الحصن, Qaṣr al-Ḥuṣn, "Fortified Palace") is a historical landmark and the oldest stone building in the city of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Its construction was supervised by Mohammed Al Bastaki in 1761.

Location
It is located along Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum St and is a part of the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation.

History
Qasr Al Hosn, also known as the White Fort (originally not white in colour but painted bright white during 1976–1983 renovations) or Old Fort, was constructed in 1761 as a conical watchtower to defend the only freshwater well in Abu Dhabi island. The tower was later expanded into a small fort in 1793 by the then ruler, Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan, and became the permanent residence of the ruling Sheikh. The tower took its present shape after a major extension in the late 1930s, aided by revenues received for granting the first oil license in Abu Dhabi. It remained the emir's palace (hence the name Qasr Al Hosn, meaning Palace fort) and seat of government until 1966. The fort had been refurbished several times and is now partially open to the public.

Current use
The Qasr Al Hosn is currently the subject of extensive historical, archaeological, and architectural research. The fort houses a museum displaying artifacts and pictures representing the history of the country. It also has a range of weapons, used through the region's history, on display.

Qasr Al Hosn festival
Qasr Al Hosn festival is an annual 11-day cultural event staged on the grounds of the fort. The fort is open to the public during the festival, including some of the restricted areas and features live music and dance performances showing the UAE's cultural heritage.

Jabal Hafeet (Arabic: جَبَل حَفِيْت, romanized: Jabal Ḥafīt, "Mount Hafeet"; variously transcribed Jabel or Jebal and Hafit – literally "empty mountain") is a mountain in the region of Tawam, on the border of the United Arab Emirates and Oman. It is often considered an outlier of the Hajar Mountains in Eastern Arabia due to its proximity to the main range. To the north is the UAE city of Al Ain, in the Eastern Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the adjacent Omani town of Al-Buraimi.
The sole mountain in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and one of the highest mountains in the country, it has given its name to a period in UAE history, the Hafit Period of the Bronze Age (3200 to 2600 BCE), because of the discovery of a cluster of important beehive tombs at its foothills. As of 2017, the mountain is recognised as being part of a national park, and was incorporated into the Sheikh Zayed Network of Protected Areas in 2018.

Climate
Jebel Hafeet has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen climate classification. On average, 77 mm (3.0 in) of rain falls annually. The temperature is relatively cool from October to March, usually remaining below 25 °C (77 °F). The average overall temperature is 27.1 °C (80.8 °F).

Orography and geology
Geology
The Jabal Hafit mountain trends NNW–SSE over about 26 km (16 mi) and is 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) wide. It protrudes 900 m (3,000 ft) above the surrounding plains. The mountain consists of shallow marine sedimentary rocks, which includes limestone, marl, and evaporites. These layers contain many fossils which includes corals, foraminifera, and bryozoa. Fossils indicate that the sedimentary rocks exposed at the surface range from early Eocene to early Miocene in age, younging from the mountains core to its flanks. This structure is an anticline, or more specifically an east-verging pericline. The west limb has a dip of around 30° and the east limb has overturned bedding at 70° in the central area. This results in an inclined axial plane, creating an asymmetric fold. This is unexpected because the structure is folding towards the Hajar Mountains in the east. If the structure is related to the formation of the Hajar range, the anticline would typically be west verging. This indicates that the Jabal Hafit anticline formed due to a backthrust (antithetic fault), and is a fault-propagation fold.
Within the eroded core of the anticline, at the Green Mubazzarah Park, are hot springs with temperatures of around 40 °C (104 °F). There is no volcanic activity in the area, therefore the water is being heated geothermally. Meteoric water is percolating from the surface to about 2 km (1.2 mi) depth and then returning to the surface. This provides evidence for faults below the anticline, as faulting fractures the rock and provides fluid pathways.
The limestone layers were deposited laterally within a basin, and then horizontal shortening folded the layers into an anticline. The timing of when this folding occurred is debated, and the driving force is not fully understood. Some geologists relate the deformation of the Jabal Hafit anticline to the early Miocene Zagros Collision, which is currently active and is caused by the Arabian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate. However, the Jabal Hafit Anticline is not actively deforming, and undeformed Miocene sedimentary rocks around the anticline indicate that no deformation has occurred recently. Sedimentary evidence indicates that the Hafit structure developed during the late Oligocene to early–middle Miocene.

Caves
The mountain rises 1,100–1,400 m (3,600–4,600 ft), and offers a view over Al-Ain. Jebel Hafeet was a well-known landmark throughout the area's history, and is a contemporary tourist attraction. An extensive natural cave system winds through Jabal Hafeet. Jebel Hafeet is crossed by a system of caves, some of which have been explored to a depth of no more than 150 m (490 ft). In the caves there are well-preserved stalagmites and stalactites. Access to the caves is partly natural, while in other parts of the city of Al Ain, the entrance is blocked. At the foot of Jebel Hafeet lies a tourist attraction with hot springs and a lake. To the northeast is the mountain's largest wadi, Wadi Tarabat.

Ridges
The mountain has ridges which stretch northwards to the inner part of Al-Ain City, two of which have been named and given prominence in literature. One is Al Naqfa Ridge or the Nagfa Ridge (Arabic: جَبَل ٱلنَّقْفَة, romanized: Jabal An-Naqfah), which stretches to Al Ain Oasis in the north, and has a historical fort of the same name nearby. The other is the "Western Ridge" or "West Ridge".

Hafeet Mountain Road
The Jebel Hafeet Mountain Road, built in 1980, extends for 11.7 km (7.3 mi) up the mountain, rising 1,200 m (3,900 ft). With 60 turns and three lanes (two climbing and one descending), the road was called the greatest driving road in the world by Edmunds.com. The road scales the mountain and ends at a parking lot with a hotel and a palace belonging to the country's rulers.  The road was built by Strabag International of Cologne, Germany.
Hafeet Mountain Road is a challenge for cyclists who frequently use the route to train. The Jabal Hafeet Mercure Challenge is an annual road cycling competition taking place in January. National and international riders take part in climbing the 8% average ascent of the mountain. In 2015 it hosted the arrival of the third stage of first edition of Abu Dhabi Tour, won by Colombian Esteban Chaves. Since 2019, the road to the top of Jebel Hafeet is a fixed location of the UAE Tour. For the 2020 edition the mountain was visited twice. The first ascent was won by eventual Tour winner Adam Yates, and during stage 5, which wound up being the final stage of the race due to concerns about the coronavirus, Team UAE's promising young rider Tadej Pogačar won the stage.

Desert / National Park
The mountain is part of a national or desert park, which can be called "Jebel Hafeet National Park", "Jebel Hafit Desert Park" or "Mezyad Desert Park". It includes the Hafit Graves, Mezyad Fort, and related oases. Its aim was to preserve and restore the fauna, flora, natural environment, and geology of the place, but at the same time, to attract tourists so that they can learn about the area.

Flora and fauna
The mountain is home to endangered species of flora and fauna, particularly at Wadi Tarabat. 170 plant species have been documented from Jebel Hafeet and this accounts for over 40 per cent of the total plant species recorded in the emirate.
On the mountain has been observed the yellow bloom of Acridocarpus orientalis. Numerous other plants have been seen around caves in the mountain. The mountain’s largest wadi, Wadi Tarabat, is alone home to around 95 species of plants, including Christ’s thorn, Ziziphus spina-christi, which was historically used for building, food and herbal medicine.
The caves of Jebel Hafeet are a natural habitat for a wide range of animals, including bats, foxes, snakes, rodents, and hyraxes. The lizard Acanthodactylus opheodurus, which until 1982 was considered extinct in the UAE, has been observed in the area. Among the birds, there is the greatest biodiversity of the whole country: a study counted 119 species of birds. Finally, they have been cataloged, with about 200 different insects, and 23 species of butterflies. Recently, seven species of lacewing insects were discovered here. They were previously thought not to have been in this country, but in Saudi Arabia. The Arabian tahr is also found here.
In 1949, an Arabian leopard was spotted here by Wilfred Thesiger. In 1976, one was shot and wounded, as reported by Hellyer, who claimed another sighting in 1993. The leopard is now possibly extinct in the country's wilderness. In addition, rock hyrax were recently introduced here, and could serve as prey for the leopard, if the latter had to be re-introduced.
In February 2019, the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi recorded the sighting of an Arabian caracal by camera trap in Jebel Hafeet National Park, the first such sighting in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi since 1984. In March, a Blanford's fox was observed using the same technique, after an absence of about 17 years.

Archeological findings
At the foothills of the mountain, near Mezyad, 500 beehive tombs were excavated that dated to an area named after the mountain, the Hafit period of the early Bronze Age, between 3200 and 2600 BC. These tombs were firstly discovered in 1950. Later excavations by Danish archaeologists in 1959 found evidence for ceramic vessels and copper artifacts in these tombs. While the graves on the north side have been partially destroyed by construction projects, the southern tombs are preserved. Some of the tombs contain skeletons, some of which are adorned with bronze objects and pearls. Other objects found in the tombs include ceramics from Mesopotamia, and other artifacts from ancient Iran and the Indus Valley of present-day India and Pakistan, to trading relationships in antiquity. Because of its exceptional archaeological and historical value, in 1993, the "Desert Park and the tombs" (which includes the Jebel Hafeet) was inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as the "Cultural Sites of Al Ain: Hafit, Hili, Bidaa Bint Saud and Oases Areas". Also nearby is the historic Mezyad Fort.

Tourism
Jebel Hafeet is a popular tourist center with a broad view over the whole area from the summit. The touristic attraction at the foot of the mountain is Green Mubazzarah (Arabic: ٱلْمُبَزَّرَة ٱلْخَضْرَاء, romanized: Al-Mubazzarah Al-Khaḍrāʿ), a well-developed tourist attraction featuring a geyser, a children's play park and a number of chalets for hire, several hot-water springs gushing forth in little streams and forming a lake, and swimming pools and Jacuzzis scattered all over the area.
There is also a small dam, constructed in 1955 and restored in 2005, one of the earliest development projects instituted by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who was the governor of Al-Ain before becoming the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the UAE. The Mubazzara Dam is freely accessible to the public.
On top of the mountain, there is a military communications outpost and a hotel operated by French hospitality company Mercure, as well as a palace.

Hili Archaeological Park (Arabic: حَدِيْقَة آثَار ٱلْهِيْلِي, romanized: Ḥadīqat Āthar Al-Hīlī) is the location of a Bronze Age site in Al Ain, Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.

Description and history
Hili is the largest Bronze Age site in the UAE and dates from the 3rd millennium BC. Other remains include settlements, tombs, and a falaj dating from the Iron Age. Some of the site is located outside the park in a protected area. Finds from the site can be seen in the Al Ain National Museum in central Al Ain. The Hili Grand Tomb is a tower measuring 12 m (39 ft) in diameter that has been reconstructed. The tombs belong to the Umm al-Nar culture.

In May 2019 the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism reported that fingerprints about 3000 years old were found at Hili II. They apparently belonged to craftsmen who constructed a wall at the site.

Dubai Museum (Arabic: متحف دبي) is the main museum in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is located in the Al Fahidi Fort (Arabic: حصن الفهيدي), built in 1787 and is the oldest existing building in Dubai.
The museum was opened by the Ruler of Dubai in 1971, with the aim of presenting the traditional way of life in the Emirate of Dubai. When entering, one can see the fort constructed and the various displays that go along with it. From the fort, there is a path to the galleries, which display the general culture of the land, especially in the 1800s. It includes local antiques as well as artifacts from African and Asian countries that traded with Dubai. It also includes several dioramas showing life in the emirate before the advent of oil, in addition to artifacts from recent discoveries as old as 3000 BC. The museum has displayed from pearl diving boats to swords and jewellery and a lovely close-to-life spice souk, which filled with real smells and actual spices. Besides the displays, the museum also includes hologram-like movies, and information stands that showcase lives and times of the Bedouin people from the third millennium B.C. till today.
In 2007, Dubai Museum received 1,800 visitors daily, with a yearly total of 611,840. In March 2008, the museum had 80,000 visitors. The most popular times are from August to April. The museum received over one million visitors in 2013. The total area of Dubai museum is 4,000 square meters.
A renovation was carried out in 2021 by the former HQ of the Dubai ruler.

History
Al Fahidi Fort was built in several phases. The oldest tower was built around 1787, and is believed to be the oldest building in Dubai that still exists today. The fort was used to guard the landward approaches to the town from the raids of neither ruler's palace, a garrison, and a prison.
In 1969, Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum issued a letter to Sheikh Badr Mohammad Al Sabah, head of the office of state in Kuwait, asking for a museum expert to be sent to Dubai to help establish the museum.

Fort
Al Fahidi Fort is square-shaped with towers occupying three of its corners. It was built of coral rock and mortar in several phases. Just off the southern wall lie a reconstruction of the old city walls. Next to them stands a tall dhow (traditional boat) in the middle of a large courtyard that covers the underground galleries. Two cannons guard the main gate to the fort on the eastern wall, adorned by flags of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. The Fort served as the headquarters for the Ruler of the emirate and It was restored during the reign of the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum.
Internal halls line three of the fort walls. One hall is at the main gate and houses the ticket office, while the others contain a collection of old weapons and arms from different historical periods along with a model of the city in 1820 AD. Traditional musical instruments are also displayed next to a video of folkloric music.
The halls surround a central courtyard. Here you will find a bronze cannon with cannonballs, a well, and various types of boats. In the corner stands a traditional summer house called Arish. The Arish is made entirely from weaved palm fronds. It comprises seating and sleeping areas as well as a kitchen, filled with household furnishings and objects used by the locals in past times. The Arish features the distinct wind tower design, used for air conditioning in the pre-electricity days.

Galleries
Entrance to the galleries is located at the tower on the south-western corner of the fort. After descending the spiral stairs visitors enter the first gallery, where old maps of Dubai are displayed. Next is the video room, showing a video, updated in 2007, that depicts Dubai from before the discovery of oil in the 1960s to the current day. Below it there is a map that shows the urban scape of the city growing in sync with the timeline of the video.
Life-size dioramas of the pre-oil era await behind the next door. Once they enter, visitors will set foot on the deck of a dhow unloading at the model creek-side souq. Moving ahead they will see the shops filled with craftsmen, vendors and buyers. A tailor, a carpenter, an iron smith, a textile vendor and others line the street. Realistic sounds and life-size videos of craftsmen at work give the impression of a bustling souq.
The street leads to a model of a mosque, house and family, then turns to the right where it is surrounded by depictions of desert life with a date farm, a camel, wild animals, and a Bedouin tent filled with jewelry, trinkets and objects from the daily life of Bedouins. The walls tell about their knowledge of the stars and how they used it to guide their activities. Next is the largest diorama which is all about the sea, with a huge scene of the building of a dhow, scenes of marine life detailing local species, in addition to a collection of seafaring equipment. The last diorama features an archaeological site in Al Qusais area that goes back to 3000 BC. There are tombs, an excavated skeleton, and an archaeologist. All the way sounds, visual effects and electronic guides accompany the dioramas.
Cabinets filled with archaeological finds from Al Qusais site line the walls next to the excavation scene. Finally, the winding track leads to a gallery displaying finds from other sites and historical eras, like the Umayyad site at Jumeirah. The gift shop is the last stop before a spiral ramp takes you up to the museum's southern exit.

Transport
Visitors can reach Dubai Museum by public buses through the Ghubaiba or Fahidi bus stations nearby or by metro station of the Ghubaiba or Fahidi which is also located nearby. Rented cars or tours operators also provide transportation services.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Al-Bidya Mosque (Gulf Arabic: مَسْجِد ٱلْبِدْيَة‎, romanized: Masjid Al-Bidyah, sometimes transliterated as Al-Bidiyah (ٱلْبِدِيَة) or Al-Badiyah (ٱلْبَدِيَة)) is a historical mosque in the Emirate of Fujairah, the U.A.E. It was the oldest known mosque in the country, prior to the discovery in September 2018 of the ruins of a 1000-year-old mosque dating back to the Islamic Golden Age, near the Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Mosque in the city of Al Ain, Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Still in use, it is located in the small village of Al-Badiyah or Al-Bidiyah, about 40 km (25 miles) north of the Emirate's capital city, and is also known as the "Ottoman Mosque".

History
The mosque's date of construction is uncertain and because the mud and stone built structure uses no wood, radiocarbon dating is not possible. It is estimated to date to the 15th century C.E., however some much earlier estimates have been proposed. The site was investigated by the archaeological center of Fujairah in co-operation with the University of Sydney from 1997-98. and Fujairah Archaeology and Heritage Department concluded that the mosque was believed to be built in 1446 AD, along with the two watch towers overlooking the mosque and the village.

Structure
The small, square structure has an area of 53 square metres (570 sq ft) and was built from materials available in the area, primarily stones of various sizes and mud bricks coated in many layers of whitewashed plaster. The roof has four squats, helical domes that are supported by only one centrally placed pillar that also forms the ceiling. Entrance to the mosque is through double-winged wooden doors.
The prayer hall has a small mihrab (the niche in the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca), a simple pulpit, arches, and openings. A central pillar divides the internal space into four squares of similar dimensions. The pillar supports all four domes that can be seen from the exterior.
Inside the prayer hall, a number of small decorative windows allow light and air to enter the mosque. There are also cube-shaped spaces carved into the thick walls where copies of the Quran and other books are stored.
The mosque continues to host daily prayers, and is a tourist attraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fujairah Fort (Arabic: قلعة الفجيرة) is a fort in the city of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Dating back to the 16th century, it is among the oldest as well as the largest castles in the country. Today, it is among the main tourist attractions in the city. It is one of the oldest forts in the UAE and was occupied by the Wahhabists.

Location
The fort is located about 2 km from central modern Fujairah in the old Fujairah region, on a small rocky hill which reaches 20 meters high. It is around 1 km away from the coast.

Architecture
The fort is part of a complex with several old houses and a mosque. It is guarded by three round watchtowers and a square watchtower. The watchtowers and main building are connected by the walls, and there is a central hall surrounded by these towers and wall. The irregular shape of the castle is due to the uneven surface of the rock it sits on. The building is built of local materials, mostly rocks, gravels, mud, hay and plasters. Radiocarbon dating has identified the date of the construction as around 1500–1550. It was one of many forts constructed in the area by the Portuguese and is one of the oldest in the UAE. It was then renovated during 1650–1700.

History
Wahhabists occupied multiple forts across the eastern coast of the Arabian Pennusula, including Fujairah Fort, from 1808 to 1810, before being driven out by the locals. The fort was used as a prison up to the 1900s.
The British Navy destroyed three of the towers in 1925 during an action enforcing British anti-slavery policy. The bombardment was by HMIS Lawrence. After this incident the fort was abandoned and neglected until 1997.

Restoration and Role Today
The fort was restored by the Fujairah Administration of Antiquity and Heritage during 1997/2000 using the same materials with which it was built.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dhayah Fort (Arabic: قلعة ضاية) is an 18th-century fortification in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is the highest hilltop fort in the UAE and was the site of a battle during the Persian Gulf campaign of 1819, when British troops captured the fort after a brief siege.
The fall of Dhayah was to pave the way for the signing of the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, the first of a number of treaties between the British government and the Sheikhs, or rulers, of what would become known as the Trucial Coast.

History
The fort was the last outpost of Qawasim resistance to British forces in 1819, when a punitive expedition was sent from Bombay to quell the troublesome seafaring tribe, who had committed 'piracy and plunder' according to the British.
Ras Al Khaimah fell to the British force on 9 December 1819. Following this, three ships were sent to blockade the nearby village of Rams to the North. They landed a force on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to the hilltop fort of Dhayah on the 19th. There, 400 people held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon. 

The two 24-pound cannons from HMS Liverpool, which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah town from the landward side, were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from the coast at Rams, a journey of some four miles. Each of the guns weighed over 2 tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December.
Many of the people in the fort were herders and farmers from the date groves of Dhayah, in the majority members of the Tunaij tribe who had fled there on the arrival of the British and of the 400 people who surrendered, only 177 were identified as men of fighting age. The British flag was briefly flown from the fort before it was demolished. British losses from the action at Dhayah included 1 officer and 3 men killed and 16 wounded.
The British expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.
The Sheikh of Rams and Al Dhaya (named on the treaty as the 'Sheikh of Zyah'), Hassan bin Ali, was a co-signatory of the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, which established peace followed the cessation of hostilities. That treaty between the British and the Sheikhs of what was formerly known as the Pirate Coast and what would become known as the Trucial Coast led to the establishment of what is known today as the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Further fortifications
A larger fortification constructed from mud bricks sits at the foot of the hill. This 'Sur' was used as a retreat for local people. A third element of fortification at Dhayah are watchtowers in the palm groves. Between the three fortifications, the area was rendered secure against interference from other Arab states, although the aged fortifications proved no match for the heavy artillery of the Royal Navy.
The fort is unusual in that it is the highest hilltop fort (as opposed to tower or lookout post) in the UAE. It commands 360 degree views of the surrounding lush landscape of wadis and plains. Remains in the area to the base of the hill at Dhayah show the area was inhabited as far back as the Wadi Suq period.
Dhayah fort as it stands today was rebuilt after 1819 and restored in the 1990s. A relatively small fortification, it lacks a natural source of water. By the time of J. G. Lorimer's survey of 1906, the area of Dhayah was uninhabited.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mleiha Archaeological Centre is a visitor centre and exhibition based around the history and archaeology of the areas surrounding the village of Mileiha in the Emirate of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates.
It sits at the centre of the Paleolandscape of Faya, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2025.
Built around a preserved Umm Al Nar era tomb, the Centre details the excavations and discoveries made over the past 40 years at Mleiha and surrounding areas (including Al Thuqeibah, Jebel Faya, Al Faya, Al Madam and Jebel Al-Buhais), particularly the important Faya North East find, which provides evidence that anatomically modern humans were in the Mleiha area between 130,000 and 120,000 years ago. 
The Faya find, in particular, points to a virile southern dispersal route in the spread of humanity from Africa across the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf region, and onward to populate the world through Iran, India, Europe and Asia.

The centre was opened on 24 January 2016 by the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi. The multi-phase eco-tourism development is intended in future to comprise accommodation, a campsite and an astronomical observatory, with a total investment of some UAE Dhs 250 million. It will also include the development of a 450 km desert park. The centre was developed by the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq).

Visitor facilities and lodge
Visitor facilities at the archaeological centre include a café and a range of guided excursions.
Tours are offered from the Centre to nearby attractions, including the popular 'Fossil Rock', or Jebel Mleiha. A range of horse-riding activities target beginners as well as advanced riders. The centre has an education outreach program and also offers discovery packages for families, as well as hosting groups and corporate events.
Currently under development at the centre site, the Al Faya Lodge is a small collection of luxury hotel rooms with a café, pool and spa, based around outbuildings first constructed in the 1960s. The Lodge forms part of 'The Sharjah Collection', a range of boutique hospitality locations managed by Mantis Hotels, a joint venture between Shurooq and Mantis Hospitality.
One of a number of innovations being deployed to maintain the eco-tourism aspect of the centre is 'spray on roads'.
The centre is open to the public weekdays from 9am-7pm and weekends (Thursday, Friday) from 9am-9pm.

The Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization (Arabic: متحف الشارقة للحضارة الإسلامية) is a museum in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The museum, opened in 2008, covers Islamic culture, with more than 5,000 artifacts from the Islamic world. Objects include calligraphy, carvings, ceramics, coins, glass, manuscripts, metalwork, and scientific instruments. It was formerly known as the Islamic Museum and opened in 1996 before being moved and re-housed in the current building.

Location
The museum is located on the Corniche Street in the Al Majarrah area, on the opposite side of the street from Sharjah Creek. It is openly visible because of its large size and characteristic golden dome. The museum is situated in the historical centre of Sharjah on the Majarrah Waterfront, in a building originally constructed as a souq (indoor market).
Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, a member of the Supreme Council of the UAE and ruler of Sharjah, inaugurated the museum on 5 June 2008. It celebrated its tenth birthday in November 2018, with an exhibition titled "Crossroads: Cultural Exchange between the Islamic Civilization, Europe and Beyond", mounted in co-operation with the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin.

Al Ain (Arabic: ٱلْعَيْن, romanized: Al-ʿAyn, lit. 'The Spring') is a city in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the seat of the administrative division of the Al Ain Region. The city is bordered to the east by the Omani town of Al-Buraimi. Al Ain is the largest inland city in the Emirates, the fourth-largest city (after Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah), and the second-largest in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The freeways connecting Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai form a geographic triangle in the country, each city being roughly 130 kilometres (81 mi) from the others.

Climate and geography
Al Ain is known as the "Garden City" (Arabic: مَدِيْنَة ٱلْحَدِيْقَة, romanized: Madīnat Al-Ḥadīqah, lit. 'City of The Garden') of Abu Dhabi, the UAE or the Gulf, due to its greenery, particularly with regard to the city's oases, parks, tree-lined avenues and decorative roundabouts, with strict height controls on new buildings, to no more than seven floors. According to one author, the oases around Al Ain and Al-Hasa in Saudi Arabia are the most important in the region of the Gulf.
The city is located approximately 160 kilometres (99 mi) east of the capital Abu Dhabi, and about 120 kilometres (75 mi) south of Dubai. The eastern region covers an area of approximately 13,100 km2 (5,100 sq mi). Oman lies to the east, Dubai and Sharjah to the north, Abu Dhabi to the west and the Empty Quarter desert and Saudi Arabia to the south. The topography of Al Ain is unique and varies as one travels to the east. The ecologically important Jebel Hafeet ("Mount Hafeet"), an outlier of the main Hajar range, is considered one of the monuments of Al Ain, lying just to the south of the city. Rising to 1,100–1,400 metres (3,600–4,600 feet) in elevation, Jebel Hafeet is one of the highest mountains in the country, and has a number of ridges which stretch to the inner part of the city, two of which are Jabal Al Naqfah (which touches Al Ain Oasis), and the Western ridge. Sand dunes of varying texture that are tinged red with iron oxide lie to the north and east of Al Ain.
The city has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), featuring long, extremely hot summers and warm winters. In Al-Ain, the mean annual rainfall is 96 mm (3.8 in) and the average relative humidity is 60% (United Arab Emirates University, 1993). Low humidity in Al-Ain, particularly during the summers, makes it a popular destination for many people during this time of the year. Boer (1997) classified the UAE climate as hyper-arid and divided it into four climatic regions: the coastal zone along the Persian Gulf, the mountain areas northeast of UAE, the gravel plains around Al Ain, and the central and southern sand desert. More rainfall and lower temperature occur in the northeast than in the southern and western regions. The monthly average rainfall around Al-Ain was 100–120 mm (3.9–4.7 in) from the period 1970 to 1992.
To the south of the city, near Oman, there is the man-made Lake Zakher, which resulted from the release of waste water from desalination plants. Also in this region, to the east of Jebel Hafeet, lies the area of Mezyad, which has a border crossing with Oman, and is where the historic Mezyad Fort is located.

Demographics
With a population of 846,787 (as of 2021), it has the highest percentage of Emirati nationals (30.8%) in the country, though the majority of its residents are expatriates, particularly from the Indian subcontinent. Many people are from Bangladesh and Pakistan. There is also a significant number of Afghans in the city.

Economy
Al Ain is an important services centre for a wide area extending into Oman. There are three major shopping centres, Al Ain Mall, Al Jimi Mall, Al Hili Mall and Al Bawadi Mall (opened in 2009 in Al Khrair area) as well as traditional souqs for fruit and vegetables and livestock. One such souq exists for camels near an IKEA store and Bawadi Mall on Zayed Bin Sultan Street, the road which leads to Mezyad. Industry is growing on a small scale, and includes the Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Al Ain Portland Cement Works. The water in Al-Ain is of good quality. Service industries such as car sales, mechanics and other artisans are located in the area known as Sanaiya and Pattan Market. Social and governmental infrastructure include the Higher Colleges of Technology, well-equipped medical facilities including the teaching hospital at Tawam, Al Ain International Airport, and military training areas. Al Ain also has world's largest dates processing and marketing company, Al Foah Company LLC. The place is also famous for Al Ain Dairy Farm located just outside Al Ain.

History and prehistory
The region of Al Ain and Buraimi, together known as the Buraimi Oasis, is of cultural and historical importance. For example, the area witnessed events relevant to the history of Islam during the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid eras, similar to Dibba and Ras Al-Khaimah. It was at this place Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of the United Arab Emirates, had  spent considerable time of his life (approximately from 1927 till he became the Ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1966). Though it is often said that he was born in Abu Dhabi, some others were of the opinion that he was born in Al-Ain. Al-Ain could also be the place for the oldest mosque in the country, which is in the premises of the Sheikh Khalifa Mosque.
Part of the historically important Western Hajar region, the area of Al Ain has been inhabited for nearly 8,000 years, with archaeological sites showing human settlement at places like Rumailah, Hili and Jabel Ḥafeet. The early Hafit culture built "beehive" tombs for their dead and engaged in hunting and gathering in the area. The oases provided water for early farms until the modern age. In the 1950s, Sheikh Zayed discovered the tombs, and brought this to the attention of a Danish team, leading to an excavation at the tombs in 1959. In 1971, Al Ain Museum was built to house items from this area. In the 2000s, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture & Heritage lobbied for its recognition as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and in 2011, Al Ain became the first World Heritage Site in the UAE to be recognized by UNESCO.

Bronze Age burial sites often re-used materials from earlier burials. For instance, the Wadi Suq communal tomb at Qattara Oasis is thought to have been constructed from stones recovered from previous Umm Al Nar burials.
Finds at Qattara include Wadi Suq era chlorite jugs and bowls and late Bronze Age short swords and daggers. Artefacts recovered also include carnelian jewellery, often associated by UAE historians with trading links to the Indus Valley. A find of particular interest from Qattara is a Bronze Age pendant discovered in the 1970s depicting a double-bodied or entwined pair of horned animals. Made from electrum, an alloy of silver and gold, the motif is found repeated in a number of Bronze Age sites in the UAE. Iron Age finds in and around Al Ain include aflaj (underground water channels) in Bidaa bint Saud, Al Ain and Buraimi which have been placed several centuries prior to the qanats of the Achaemenid Empire, which had previously been credited with the innovation.
Al Ain was originally within the area of influence of the Dhawahir, a Bedouin tribe who settled Dhahirah before Buraimi. A later wave of settlers, the Na'im, have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute. Numbering 4,500, the Dhawahir consists of three subsections: the Daramikah, who populated Hili, Mutared and Qattara; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the Trucial States.
A number of interests jostled for influence over the tribes of Buraimi, including the Sultan of Muscat, the Wahhabis (who had made a number of incursions) and the Sheikhs of the Trucial States, particularly the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi, who acquired large tracts of land, principally from the Dhawahir. This suzerainty over Al Ain was cemented by Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, known as 'Zayed the Great', a strong and charismatic leader who took the Dhawahir's main settlement 'Ain Dhawahir (the original name of Al Ain) when the tribe rebelled against him in 1877. He built a fort, one of a number of fortifications established by the various interests vying for control over the oasis, to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a wali, appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman.
Wilfred Thesiger visited Al Ain in the late 1940s, during his travels across the Empty Quarter. He met Sheikh Zayed and stayed with him at Al Muwaiji Fort. An ongoing dispute between Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Oman led to the Buraimi Dispute, a series of incidents which saw a Saudi armed force enter the oasis. Forces from the Trucial Oman Scouts, as well as the army of Muscat-Oman, arrived to recapture the oasis. With British intervention, the Saudi forces surrendered, leaving the oasis back in the hands of Abu Dhabi and Oman.
In 1971, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Hilton Hotel in the area, during her tour of the Persian Gulf. Following independence in 1971, Al Ain experienced rapid growth and investment as part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, quickly becoming larger and more successful than Oman's Al-Buraimi. In 1972, Oman and Abu Dhabi agreed on the final borders to divide Buraimi and Al Ain. Until Sheikh Zayed's death in 2004, Al Ain's municipal code forbade construction of buildings over four stories, with the exceptions of the Hilton (now Radisson Blu), Danat Al Ain Resort, and Rotana hotels. Until 2006, Buraimi and Al Ain shared an open border. This border was closed in November 2006, and passport controls were imposed.

Oases and Aflaj
The city's wāḥāt (Arabic: وَاحَات, lit. 'oases') are known for their underground irrigation system (falaj or qanāt) that brings water from boreholes to water farms and palm trees. Falaj irrigation is an ancient system dating back thousands of years, and is used widely in Oman, the UAE, China, Iran and other countries. There are seven oases here. The largest is Al Ain Oasis, near Old Sarooj, and the smallest is Al-Jahili Oasis. The rest are Al Qattara, Al-Muʿtaredh, Al-Jimi, Al-Muwaiji, and Hili.
Examples of aflaj include Falaj Hazza, which is named after Sheikh Zayed's elder brother, Hazza bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and has a district named after it.

Infrastructure
The city is known for its combination of modern and pre-modern buildings. The latter offer an insight into the city's and country's cultural heritage. The city used to have roundabouts in every intersection but recently these have been replaced by traffic signals.

Education
Al-Ain is home to the main federal university in the UAE, the United Arab Emirates University, and to two campuses of the Higher Colleges of Technology – Al Ain Men's College and Al Ain Women's College. Al-Ain is also the home of Horizon International flight academy, Etihad Airways's cadet pilot training centre. Private higher education institutions include the Al Ain University and campus of Abu Dhabi University. Al-Ain also houses the eastern zone headquarters of the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge, Abu Dhabi's education authority.
Al-Ain's first formal school, Al Nahyaneia Model School, was founded by Sheikh Zayed in 1959. Many of Al-Ain's private schools, catering mainly to the expatriate population, are located in the Al-Manaseer area. They include Al-Ain International school (British curriculum, private school, part of the Aldar group), Al Ain English Speaking School, Al Dhafra Private School, Manor Hall School, Al-Sanawbar School, Liwa International School, Al-Madar International School, Global English School, Emirates Private School, a branch of the International School of Choueifat, and an Institute of Applied Technology campus. Other private schools include the CBSE affiliated school Indian School, Al-Ain, Our Own English High School, Al Adhwa Private School, Brighton College Al Ain and Al Ain Juniors School. A new British International School, Belvedere International School is located in the Al Hili district. In 1977, the Zayed Central Library was established. Al-Khwarizmi International College has started a Campus at Al-Ain and is offering BBA programme and various other licensed, accredited and approved courses.

Health
The first hospital in Al-Ain was Kanad Hospital (formerly known as Oasis Hospital), established in 1960 by the American missionary couple Drs. Pat and Marian Kennedy at the invitation of Sheikh Zayed. It is the oldest hospital in Al Ain and the second oldest in the United Arab Emirates.
Al-Ain is also the home of Tawam Hospital, a training and research hospital linked with the UAE University. It was officially inaugurated on 17 December 1979. In March 2006, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Johns Hopkins Medicine International) (JHMI) took over the management of Tawam hospital.
Tawam Hospital Archived 20 September 2022 at the Wayback Machine is one of the largest hospitals in the UAE with 503 beds, featuring 24 VIP suites, 78 isolation rooms, 48 ER beds, 9 operating theaters and 81 specialty clinics. Its oncology centre is the main national cancer treatment centre as well as a regional referral centre.
Al Ain Hospital (abbr: AAH, also known as Al-Jimi Hospital) is the general hospital delivering health services to all Al-Ain patients regardless of their nationality. It is centrally located in the Al-Jimi district and is linked with the UAE University. Al-Ain Hospital still occupies old 1970s buildings, but a new building is planned. AAH currently has about 450 beds and provides services in all medical disciplines. In September 2007, the Medical University of Vienna International (MUVI) took over the management of AAH.

Places of worship
Formerly, the city's largest mosque was that of Shaikha Salamah. In 2021, the Sheikh Khalifa Grand Mosque became the biggest in the city, as well as one of the largest mosques in the country.

Transportation
Al-Ain is connected via the Dubai–Al-Ain Road to Al Faqa' and Dubai in the north, which also connects to Al Madam in the Emirate of Sharjah via Al-Shwaib. It is also connected to Abu Dhabi in the west, Al-Qu'a in the southeast, and Mezyad in the southwest. Bus and taxi services are available between these areas. The southern border area of Mezyad lies on the road to Dhank, Ibri and Nizwa in Oman. The city's airport (Al Ain International Airport) has scheduled passenger flights to Egypt, Pakistan and India. A new railway line linking Al-Ain to Abu Dhabi and to the Port of Sohar in Oman is being planned.

Tourism and recreation
Al-Ain is developing as a tourist destination. The dry desert air makes it a welcome retreat from the coastal humidity of the larger cities. Many Emirati nationals in Abu Dhabi have holiday houses in the city making it a popular weekend destination for families from the capital city. Its attractions include the Al Ain National Museum, the Al Ain Palace Museum, several restored forts and the Hili Archaeological Park site, dating back to the Bronze Age. Jebel Hafeet dominates the surrounding area. It is popular to visit to the mineral springs at Green Mubazzarah at the base of the mountain, and to drive to the mountaintop at sunset. Other attractions include Al Ain Zoo, an amusement park named "Hili Fun City", many well-maintained parks popular with families in the summer evenings, and a heritage village. Opened in 2012, Al Ain Adventure park is located near Jebel Hafeet and provides a range of water-based activities including surfing, kayaking and rafting. On top of Jabel Hafeet is the Mercure Hotel. Mount Hafeet and the nearby 'beehive' tombs are part of what is known as "Jebel Hafeet Desert Park" or "Mezyad Desert Park", which is meant to preserve the nature and geology of the area, besides attracting tourists.
Al-Ain has five major malls – Al Ain Mall in the town centre, Al-Jimi Mall in Al-Jimi District, Bawadi Mall in Al-Khrair District, Remal Mall located in the Sanaiya district, and Hili Mall located in the Hili District. Most commercial activity is centred in and around town centre.
Another popular pastime for Emiratis and expatriates alike is spending time in coffee shops and shisha cafes. Like the rest of the UAE, Al-Ain has strict laws governing the consumption and distribution of alcohol. Five facilities in the city currently serve alcohol, four of which are hotels. There are many café's in Al-Ain, ranging in size and quality. The city also has an International standard go-kart circuit.
The city has two English-language radio stations – 100.1 Star FM, which plays English-speaking hits alternating with Arabic-speaking hits, and 105.2 Abu Dhabi Classic FM, which plays classical music, and Arabic Radio Station, which is Abu Dhabi FM 94.9.
In 2024 the city broke three Guinness World Records. Once in January as an 8 minute firework and drone display took place, breaking the record for 'Longest straight-line drones display’. The second took place on the country's 53rd National Day celebrations, as the firework show reached a distance of 11.1 km.

Sport, culture and arts
Al-Ain is a cultural retreat for residents of the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. It is home to a major festival of classical music, and is the home of Al Ain Football Club, which is one of the most successful football clubs in the UAE and Asia. It has many titles and championships to its name. Al-Ain Club contains also eight other games which are: handball, volleyball, basketball, swimming, Table Tennis, Athletics, Jiu jitsu, and Taekwondo. The Al Ain Amblers are a well known rugby club with a long history fielding men's, women's and junior rugby teams in the UAE and Gulf competitions, based at the Al Ain Club.
Hili Fun City hosts two ice hockey teams, the Al Ain Vipers and Ghantoot. Each team has adult and youth teams starting from age 4. The Al-Ain Vipers Men's Team won the Emirates Hockey League in the 2009–10 season.
The Palm Resort to the west of the town hosts a popular rugby club with adult and youth teams, and the Al-Ain International Soccer Club which has three youth teams, including one for 7-9-year-old's.

Al-Aïn (« la source » en arabe - العين) est une oasis des Émirats arabes unis située à l'est de l'émirat d'Abou Dabi à la frontière du sultanat d'Oman.
C'est la quatrième plus grande ville émiratie avec une population de plus de 766 936 habitants (données de 2017). Les autoroutes qui la relient aux villes d'Abou Dabi (à l'ouest) et de Dubaï (au nord-ouest) forment un triangle au centre du pays, chacune des villes étant éloignée des deux autres d'environ 150 km.

Géographie
Localisation
Al-Aïn est bordée au nord, à l'est et au sud par le gouvernorat d'Al Buraymi du sultanat d'Oman, pendant que le désert de Rub al Khali s'étend à l'ouest. Les autoroutes E22 et E66 relient la ville avec les deux autres centres urbains du pays les plus proches : Abou Dhabi (capitale du pays et de l'émirat) â l'ouest et Dubaï au nord-ouest, respectivement.

Climat
Le climat de la région d'Al-Aïn est désertique (BWh dans la classification de Köppen) avec un été long et chaud et très peu de précipitations au cours de l'année.

Démographie
Comme dans le reste des Émirats arabes unis, la population étrangère à Al-Aïn est dominante. Cela dit, la ville reste la région avec la plus grande proportion de citoyens émiratis : 30,5 % contre 16,3 % dans la région d'Abou Dabi et 9,4 % pour la région d'Al Gharbia (en) (selon les données de 2016).
De même forme, l'immigration est à l'origine d'un nombre plus élevé d'hommes que de femmes dans l'ensemble de la population, toutefois que ce taux semblerait se réduire au cours des années récentes (de 180 hommes pour 100 femmes en 2010 à 140 hommes pour 100 femmes en 2016).

Histoire
La zone, historiquement connue sous le nom d'oasis Buraimi, a été habitée de manière constante depuis plus de quatre mille ans, et Al-Aïn est considéré comme une part importante de l'héritage culturel du pays. C'est le lieu de naissance du sheikh Zayed ben Sultan Al Nahyane, le premier président des Émirats arabes unis.
Aujourd'hui, le nom de Buraimi est lié à la ville Omani qui fusionna avec celle de Al-Aïn. Il y a de nombreuses sources souterraines dans les environs, ce qui explique l'attraction pour l'établissement de populations. Les traces de son passé traditionnel restent, y compris les courses et la reproduction de dromadaires. L'ancien système d'irrigation est toujours en usage dans certains endroits distribuant l'eau souterraine par un réseau de tunnels émergeant parfois dans des rigoles qui peuvent être dirigées et régulées.

Site archéologique d'Hili
Le site d'Hili témoigne de la prospérité que connut l'émirat d'Abou Dabi au troisième millénaire, grâce à la route du cuivre et au négoce, à la croisée de la Mésopotamie et de l'Indus. L'art funéraire atteint alors un sommet, qu'incarnent les tombes circulaires monumentales aux parois sculptées d'Hili. Celles-ci datent de la période dite Umm an-Nar, de 2 500 à 2 000 ans avant notre ère. Mais c'est sous terre que les archéologues ont fait la découverte la plus extraordinaire du site : une fosse collective inviolée rassemblant près de 700 corps et un mobilier funéraire intact. Les fouilles ont révélé vases de Mésopotamie, lapis-lazuli d'Afghanistan, poteries d'Iran... mêlés à la production locale, reflet des réseaux d'échanges de l'époque. Quant à la péninsule omanaise, elle exportait du cuivre.

Période contemporaine
Al-Aïn a la plus grande proportion d'habitants originaires des émirats de tout le pays ; cependant une grande partie des résidents sont des expatriés et, plus particulièrement, des personnes originaires du sous-continent indien. Il y a moins d'expatriés occidentaux que dans les grands centres de Dubaï ou Abou Dabi. Cela donne à Al-Aïn une allure plus authentiquement arabe que dans les grandes villes cosmopolites des Émirats.
Al-Aïn est souvent appelé la « ville jardin du Golfe » à cause de ses nombreux parcs, ses avenues et ronds-points décorés. Grâce à l'eau provenant des sept oasis sur lesquelles elle s'est développée, la ville dispose non seulement de 10 000 hectares de parcs et jardins, mais aussi d'une riche agriculture, notamment dédiée aux dattes. La hauteur des nouveaux bâtiments, strictement contrôlée — pas plus de quatre étages —, renforce l'impression de verdure de la ville.

Tourisme et divertissement
Al-Aïn est une destination touristique en plein développement. Elle bat régulièrement les records de température de tous les Émirats, mais l'air sec en fait une retraite appréciée par rapport à l'air humide des grandes villes de la côte. Beaucoup d'Émiratis d'Abou Dabi possèdent des maisons de vacances dans la ville, ce qui en fait une destination très prisée des habitants de la capitale pour y passer les week-ends. Ses attractions comportent le musée Al-Aïn National Museum, le musée Al-Aïn Palace Museum, quelques forts restaurés et le site archéologique d'Hili, datant de l'âge de bronze. Le Jebel Hafit (en), montagne de 1 340 mètres de haut, domine les environs.
La visite aux sources d'eau minérale et la promenade au sommet de la montagne au coucher du soleil sont très populaires. D'autres attractions existent dont l'oasis d'Al-Aïn dans le centre de la ville et d'autres oasis éparpillées çà et là, autant de fraiches retraites dans la chaleur de l'été, un zoo, un parc de loisirs appelé "Fun City", beaucoup de parcs bien entretenus avec de nombreuses familles durant les soirs d'été, ainsi qu'un village typique. Depuis avril 2012, un autre centre de divertissement a ouvert ses portes au pied de Jebel Hafit, Wadi Adventure. Ce complexe possède une grande piscine permettant de créer artificiellement des vagues pour surfers débutants ou confirmés. Il y a aussi trois rivières artificielles comportant des rapides pour la pratique du Kayak et du Rafting.
La ville abrite également deux clubs de football, le Al Ain Club et le Al-Aïn Héraud.

Commerce et industrie
Al-Aïn n'est pas un centre important pour les services. Il y a deux principaux centres commerciaux, Al-Aïn Mall et Al Jimi Mall, ainsi que des souks traditionnels pour les fruits et légumes et les produits frais. L'industrie est en croissance bien qu'à une petite échelle, incluant l'usine Coca-Cola de mise en bouteille et la fabrique de ciment. Les services comme la vente de voitures, les mécaniciens et les autres artisans sont regroupés dans une zone appelée Sanaiya. À noter la présence d'infrastructures sociales et gouvernementales incluant l'United Arab Emirates University, Higher Colleges of Technology, des services médicaux bien équipés, avec un hôpital universitaire à Tawam, des zones d'entrainement militaires et l'aéroport international d'Al-Aïn (code AITA : AAN).

Enseignement
Al-Aïn possède la plus importante université du pays, ouverte en 1976, l'United Arab Emirates University qui figure parmi les 500 meilleures universités du monde selon les classements de QS World (no 329) et de Times Higher Education (no 301-350) pour l'année 2019/2020.

Voies de communication et transports
Transports urbains
Depuis 2009, la ville dispose d'un réseau de bus urbain comprenant plus de 3000 bus circulant sur huit lignes. Il est exploité sous l'autorité du ministère des transports de l'émirat d'Abou Dabi (Department of Transport).

## Get around
Taxis are very easy to find and cheap (in the older, brown taxis, 10. dirham plus 1.00/km; silver taxis are more expensive, but have better air conditioning and, usually, English-speaking drivers).  Women traveling alone should sit in the back and not make conversation with the cabbies, as drivers may misinterpret friendliness.

24.0594955.7786841 Jebel Hafeet. The second tallest mountain in the United Arab Emirates (1350 m), Jebel Hafeet is surrounded by flat plains on three sides, which afford spectacular views, especially at sunset. The road to the top winds around hairpin turns for 12 km. There are three rest points for viewing, and then at the very top is a large parking area with a cafeteria and 360-degree view of the entire area. Take care on the road as some drivers enjoy the excitement of the twists and turns too much. There is a hotel (Mecure Hafeet) at the top, as well as Green Mubazara Park and Ain Al Fada resorts at the bottom. Free.
Camel Souq (near Meyzad border crossing). Daylight. In the Meyzad area, about 5 km south of Al Ain, near the Oman border, the camel souq is open every day.

The museum recreates the way people of the region lived before the founding of the UAE.
24.2164755.771273 Al Ain Oasis. The biggest of several oases in the region, the oasis is made up of thousands of date palms. The oasis sits between the main souq area downtown and Al Ain street.

Most of the good restaurants are concentrated on Khalifa Street.
The main street in Mauteredh (Mathraz, according to some) has a large number of cafeterias serving Lebanese to Indian food.

Fujairah City (Arabic: الفجيرة) is the capital of the emirate of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. It is the seventh-largest city in UAE, located on the Gulf of Oman (part of the Indian Ocean). It is the only Emirati capital city on the UAE's east coast. The city of Fujairah is an industrial and commercial hub located on the west coast of the Indian Ocean that sits at the foothills of the Hajar Mountains.

Demographics
In 2016, the city had a population of 97,226, a significant number (43%) compared to 225,360 in the entire emirate. In 2023, the population grew to 118,933. Fujairah's population has grown steadily over the past few decades, driven by economic development, urbanization, and an increasing number of expatriates settling in the emirate. The native Emirati population in Fujairah is estimated to make up about 30-40% of the total population.

Climate
The climate of Fujairah is characterized by a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with very warm winters and extremely hot summers. In the summer months, daytime temperatures typically reach highs of around 41 °C (106 °F), while winter temperatures are milder, averaging around 25 °C (77 °F) . Humidity can be quite high, especially during the summer, making the heat feel even more intense. The region experiences minimal rainfall, with most precipitation occurring between December and March. Fujairah receives an average annual rainfall of about 120 mm (4.7 inches).
2022 Floods in Fujairah:

In 2022, Fujairah experienced significant flooding due to heavy rains that occurred in July. This led to widespread damage in the emirate, affecting businesses and residents alike. The floods were part of a larger weather event that brought the highest recorded rainfall in nearly three decades. The damage was substantial, with traders in Fujairah reporting major losses. Additionally, the floods resulted in rescue operations for hundreds of people and the establishment of temporary shelters for those displaced by the flooding.

Commercial
Fujairah City is the main business and commercial centre for the emirate, with tall office buildings lining Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, the main route into the city. The road runs through the city and connects Fujairah City to Dubai through the Emirate of Sharjah. The city's location provides direct access to the Indian Ocean for the United Arab Emirates, avoiding use of the Persian Gulf, which requires access via the Strait of Hormuz. The northern part of the waterfront has many cylindrical tanks for oil storage.
The Fujairah Free Zone is a special economic zone located to the north of the city, which is subject to different economic regulations. Creative City is a media free zone on the Sheikh Khalifa Highway to the west. It was established in 2007 as a media hub that offers benefits to media companies and entrepreneurial projects in the media, music, entertainment, events, communication, and marketing sectors.
The Port of Fujairah is located on the city's eastern coast, just outside the Strait of Hormuz, and was built in 1978. It began its operations in 1983 and today has a quay that stretches over 6.7 km.
It is located on a major global shipping route and is one of the world's largest bunkering hubs alongside Singapore and Rotterdam. The port is an oil hub and has launched plans to expand its oil storage capacity by 75% by 2022.
The Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) is located north of the Port of Fujairah and has a storage capacity of 10 million cubic meters for refined oil products. It was established to develop and regulate the hydrocarbon industry in the emirate of Fujairah and to support growth and investment in the sector. Eighteen companies operate in the FOIZ, and the Aramco Trading Company opened its second overseas office in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone in 2019, the first one being in Singapore.
There are a number of shopping malls, including the large City Centre Fujairah mall, opened in 2012. Other malls include the Fujairah Mall (opened in 2016), LuLu Mall (opened in 2014), and Century Mall. Markets include the Central Market, Fabric Souk, and a Fish & Vegetable Market.

It can hold around 28,000 worshippers.
The Fujairah Museum opened its doors in 1991 and is home to archeological exhibits discovered in various parts of the emirate. Some of the exhibits date back to the sixth millennium BC while others are from Islamic rule of the city's more modern history. They include pottery, jewelry, and spearheads. The most famous item at the museum is an ostrich egg that dates back to 2,500 BC.

On the seafront are Fujairah Corniche and Fujairah International Marine Club on Al Corniche Road. There is also bullfighting on Friday afternoons. To the north is Fujairah Beach on Al Faseel Road.
The bullfighting held in Fujairah City is a significant public event. It does not include matadors like the Spanish form of bullfighting and does not kill the animals. It consists of two bulls locking horns, which can result in injuries. Families and betting to attend the events are not allowed.
Most major hotels are on or close to Hamad Bin Abdulla Road and Al Corniche Road.

Transportation
The Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Expressway (aka Sheikh Khalifa Highway), a dual carriageway road, links Fujairah City with Dubai and other parts of the UAE, passing through the mountains just inland from the city. This leads into Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, which continues through the city to the coast.
The main airport in the emirate, Fujairah International Airport, is located to the south of Fujairah City. It currently mostly handles cargo traffic. Pakistan International Airlines became one of the first passenger flights to fly into Fujairah Airport on 25 November 2021. PIA now operates two weekly flights originating from Peshawar and Islamabad in Pakistan.
Additionally, EgyptAir operates flights to Cairo, and SalamAir offers regular flights to Muscat and onwards to destinations in India and South East Asia, with seasonal flights to Salalah.
The UAE's national railway, Etihad Rail, is set to connect Fujairah with other emirates, facilitating freight transport and reducing traffic congestion. This railway aims to link the industrial cities across the UAE, enhancing the transportation infrastructure of Fujairah and contributing to its economic growth.The first passenger station in the Etihad Rail network is currently under construction in the Sakamkam Area of Fujairah City.

## Overview
The easternmost of the United Arab Emirates, Fujairah is the only emirate not to have a coastline along the Persian Gulf. It is also the youngest of the emirates: it only became independent from Sharjah in 1952.

## By plane
While Fujairah has an airport, it is closed to commercial aviation. Airborne visitors will arrive at one of the western emirates.

## By car
Fujairah is roughly 2 hours by car from Dubai and the trip is on sealed roads throughout.
It is also quite easy to reach Fujairah from nearby Oman, as the border is very close. Visitors must have separate visas for Oman and UAE in order to move from one to the other by car or any other mode of travelling.

## By bus
Buses run regularly between Dubai and Fujairah (around one every hour during the day and evening); the cost is 25 dirham one way (tickets to be bought from the ticket window before boarding).
The bus service is comfortable.  Women, couples and families sit in the front two to three rows, and men in the remaining seats.
Buses leave from Union Square in Dubai, and from the old Plaza Cinema/HSBC in Fujairah (stopping at the bus station on the way out of town, where passengers need to disembark to buy their tickets before re-boarding).

## By taxi
Taxis run from Fujairah (next to the old cinema) to Dubai and Sharjah. A shared taxi to downtown Dubai (Deira taxi stand) costs around US$7 and they go as soon as the car is full. An unshared one costs about US$28 but it depends on where you want to go in Dubai. Add another US$15 if you want to go the Marina area where all the tourist hotels are. Beware - metered taxis from Dubai to Fujairah are twice the price.

## Get around
Fujairah city is not designed for pedestrians, being dominated by main roads. The fleet of Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry taxis are metered, and are plentiful. Fares start at 2 dirham during the day (2.50 dirham at night). Visitors attempting to walk around the city will attract horn tooting from taxi drivers, who seriously cannot believe that anyone would choose to walk.

It is possible for non-Muslims to go inside this Mosque. Women (also men in shorts) must dress up to enter. The staff provides you with appropriate clothing and headscarves.

Fujairah Beach. (updated Jun 2019)
Fujairah can also be used as a base from which to go on excursions to the surrounding areas, such as Khorfakkan and Kalba. The city is growing in stature as a business destination, particularly where oil is concerned.
While the Indian Ocean is enticingly close, some parts of the beach would not seem to be a good option to swim at certain seasons. However,  Dibba Al-Fujairah which is 30 km from Fujairah city would be a good choice, where you can enjoy the sunny beaches and you can practice any sea activity you like. One more interesting thing to do is that you can make a boat trip to one of many islands that lie in the Gulf of Oman, a good place for strolling and fishing.

## Drink
There are no local specialties as far as drink goes, which means that the usual collection of water, juices, tea, coffee and softdrinks are readily available.
Alcohol is mostly only available within top-quality hotels. Cheaper alternatives include the Fujairah Marine Club on the corniche and Fujairah Beach Motel, which also has a retail "hole-in-the-wall." You'll have to ask as it's hidden away a bit.
The best value drinks in town are to be had in the pub at the Tennis and Country Club (go on a Tuesday and you get karaoke too).

## Stay safe
The customary cautions regarding drivers in the UAE apply in Fujairah as well. Road rules are understood to exist, but drivers will tend to take risks which would seem borderline-suicidal to many visitors. Most roads are multi-lane in each direction in the city, which may well mean that a taxi or one's own car is the best bet here. Where the taxi meter is either not present or "not working", agree on the fare before starting the trip.

## Go next
A trip to nearby Khor Fakkan (an enclave of Sharjah) is highly recommended, as the beach is regarded as one of the best in the region.
A drive through the Hajar Mountains (which extend over the border into Oman) may also be enjoyable, however this will require some planning as regards the standard of car to be driven.
Dubai
Oman border is just 30 minutes away by car. You will need to check your Visa requirements in advance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ras Al Khaimah (Arabic: رَأْس ٱلْخَيْمَة; /raʔs͜ ɪlˈxajma/, Emirati Arabic : [räːs͜ ɪlχe̞ːmɛ] ), often referred to its initials RAK, is an industrial port city and the largest city and capital of the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah in the U.A.E. The city had a population of 191,753 in 2025, and is the sixth-most populous city in UAE after Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Al Ain and Ajman. The city is divided by a creek into two parts: old town in the west and Al Nakheel in the east. The town is the successor to the Islamic era port and trading hub of Julfar.

Etymology
Ras Al Khaimah translates to "Headland of the Tent". The Arabic word Khaimah (خَيْمَة) means 'tent', but also refers to the palm frond or areesh houses that were common in the area.

History
Antiquity
Ras Al Khaimah has been the site of continuous human habitation for 7,000 years, with archaeological finds dating back to the Neolithic. The northern area of the city today known as Ras Al Khaimah was previously the location of the important Islamic era settlement and port of Julfar. Although Julfar and Ras Al Khaimah are often placed together, they are in fact two different settlements with distinctive histories. Julfar was abandoned in the early 17th Century as Ras Al Khaimah rose. Julfar itself had a predecessor settlement, Kush, today located in suburbs to the north of the city.
One of Ras Al Khaimah's most celebrated sons, Ibn Majid, was a hugely influential seaman, navigator and cartographer, and there is evidence in his writing that the town he came from was at that time known as Ras Al Khaimah, that town having eclipsed Julfar as the principal port and settlement of the Shimal coast.

18th to 19th centuries
In the early 18th century, the Qawasim (singular Al Qasimi) established themselves in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the Persian and Arabian coasts that frequently came into conflict with British flagged shipping.
In the aftermath of a series of attacks against shipping sailing under Omani flags and following 1809 monsoon season, the British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 against Ras Al Khaimah, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Lingeh on the Persian coast which was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi.
By the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of their vessels had been destroyed.
Following the 1809 campaign, an 1815 arrangement was made between the British and the Al Qasimi. However, by 1819 it was clear the arrangement had broken down and so in November of that year, the British embarked on a second expedition against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah, led by Major-General William Keir Grant.
The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea for a period of four days, until, on 9 December, the fortress and town of Ras Al Khaimah were stormed and found to be practically deserted. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah.
The British landed a force at Rams on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to Dhayah Fort on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon.

The two 24-pound cannon from HMS Liverpool which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah from the landward side were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from Rams, a journey of some four miles. Each of the guns weighed over 2 tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December.
In January 1820, the British imposed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 signed by Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah who was reinstated by the British in Ras Al Khaimah after the deposition of Hassan bin Rahma Al Qasimi. The treaty stipulated the end of piracy and slavery, and laid the foundation for the British protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until December 1st 1971.

British protectorate
A British protectorate from this point forward, as one of the Trucial States, in 1869, Ras Al Khaimah became fully independent from neighbouring Sharjah. From September 1900 to 7 July 1921, it was re-incorporated into Sharjah; the last governor became its next independent ruler.

Modern history
The last of the Trucial States to join the newly independent United Arab Emirates, on 10 February 1972, Ras Al Khaimah, under the leadership of Sheikh Saqr bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, joined the United Arab Emirates following the Iranian seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.

Gambling industry
In 2022, Ras Al Khaimah announced a $3.9 billion project, Wynn Al Marjan Island, which is scheduled to open in 2027. The integrated resort is being established by Wynn Resorts, whose CEO Craig Billings confirmed that it will include a 224,000 sq. ft. “casino component”. For its 40% stake, Wynn Resorts contributed $900 million, while the remaining amount was financed by the Ras Al Khaimah government. The UAE has no laws to legalize gaming or gambling equipment.

It is nestled between the Hajjar Mountains on the East and the Persian Gulf on the West and shares mountainous borders with the Musandam Peninsula of Oman. With the completion of the E311 Highway (Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road), RAK is only about one hour from the emirate of Dubai.
The Emirate has been in existence since 1708 under the ruling Al Qasimi clan. The Emirate joined the wider United Arab Emirates in 1972 after the Iranian seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands in the Straight of Hormuz.
The Emirate Ras al Khaimah combines a fascinating and a relaxing tourist hub with its calm blue seas with clean white beaches, dramatic desert dunes and the majestic Hajjar Mountains. It has numerous fascinating tourist landmarks, beautiful wildlife conservations and sanctuaries. Golf has become one of the leading tourist attractions within the emirate.

## Tourist information
Ras al Khaimah Tourism website

## By plane
25.61361155.9388891 Ras al Khaimah International Airport (RKT  IATA RAK Airport) (20 minutes from the city centre. To get there, take a metered taxi which should cost you around 30 dirham from the centre. Your hotel may offer airport pick up.), ☏ +971-7-2075200. A few airlines fly from here to the Middle East or Indian subcontinent; the most prominent is Qatar Airways, which transits via Doha. There is a greater choice of flights from nearby Dubai International Airport.
Other airports are Sharjah (SHJ IATA) 80 km , Dubai (DXB IATA) 90 km and Abu Dhabi (AUH IATA) 240 km from Ras al Khaimah.

## By rail
There is no railway system in Ras al Khaimah yet, however a national railway system called Etihad Rail is under development and will connect all the emirates of the UAE.

## By car
RAK has good road connections with all the other emirates. The Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road (E311) allows reaching Umm al Quwain (UAQ) in half an hour, Sharjah in less than an hour, Dubai in 1–1½ hour (depending on the traffic) and Abu Dhabi in around 2½–3 hours. The old Coastal Road (E11) is slower but takes you directly to Sharjah via UAQ and Ajman. Fujairah can be reached via the mountain passage or via Masafi (E18) in about 1-1½ hour. An alternative to the above is the Emirates Road (E611), which runs parallel to the E311 but avoid running through the centre of Dubai: this may be quicker in some circumstances.
Ras al Khaimah has a border with Oman (Musandam). It is rather easy to enter and exit the country by car.

## By bus
The RAK Transport Authority runs buses to Dubai (Union Bus Station), Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Quwain, Abu Dhabi and Al Ain; they also have limited services to Global Village and Dubai Mall. See the RAKTA bus page for information on routes, timetables and fares. Buses to Dubai usually leave hourly during the day.

## By boat
There are no passenger boat carriers operating directly to Ras al Khaimah.

## Get around
Public transport is governed by the RAK Transport Authority (RAKTA) in the emirates. Taxis from other emirates can cross into RAK for longer journeys. For tourists, getting around with public transport or walking is difficult (to near impossible), and it would be better to go by either taxi or car.
In November 2024, RAK run two local bus lines, departing hourly. One from Al Nakheel to Jazeera, that covers the main road parallel to the beach. There is another bus connecting villages to the central bus station. Fare was 8 AED with a plastic card, that costs another 10 AED, or 12 AED cash. Pay at the bus driver. Check the RAKTA website.
There are buses to Khasab in Oman only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and now only one bus in the morning. returning from Khasab/Oman in the afternoon. Demand was decreasing, so check if the busses are available.
A few tour operators (mainly in the international hotels) organize Ras al Khaimah city tours. Most of the big hotels provide buses for their guests to the RAK Old City and shopping malls.
Taxis are an easy option to move around the emirate. RAKTA licensed taxis use set-fare meters, are reasonable priced and safe. You can find out current charges on the RAKTA page on taxis. As of January 2024, RAKTA suggests using the "Careem" app for booking. If you are at a hotel, the concierge will usually be able to summon a taxi for you quickly. Dubai taxis are allowed to ferry passengers back from Dubai to RAK, and the charge to RAK City is around 250-300 AED; be aware of the different types of Dubai taxi - it is more expensive to take the "limo" type of taxi rather than a standard taxi, and you have to be careful at taxi stands that you ask for the regular cream coloured taxis for the cheapest rates.
Car rental is easily available option. Most of the roads in Ras al Khaimah are in good condition and it is easy to find the way around (at least in the city). However, driving can be a challenging experience for those who are not used to slightly chaotic roads.
International car rentals are available in most of the hotels. There are also numerous smaller local companies around the town. You should expect to pay from 150 dirham for a small car per day.
Heading to Oman? A rental company that rent out cars driving into Oman is Al Salamah Cars at the main branch in Al Nakheel, 120th street. They provide all the necessary papers, like the "no-objection-letter" (extra charge), that you need to cross the border. Insurance for Oman can be bought at the border crossing.
Walking around Ras al Khaimah is not easy due to the traffic, lack of sidewalks and zebra crossings and it is something not done and not recommended. For a pleasure walk, Corniche Road and beaches are the best and safest option.
RAKTA operates intra- and inter-city buses. See the RAKTA website page on buses to get details on routes, timings and prices. The RAKTA buses tend to intersect at the Al Nakheel area of RAK City (Plus code: QXWC+H6 Ras Al-Khaimah), near Manar Mall.

Jebel Jais (Arabic: جبل جيس, romanized: Jabal Jays) is a mountain of the North-Western Hajar range in the Musandam Governorate of Oman and also in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. The summit has an elevation of 1,934 m (6,345 ft). The summit is located on the Omani side, but a high point west of this peak is considered the highest point in the United Arab Emirates, at 1,892 m (6,207 ft) above sea level, and with around 10m of prominence. Since the summit is on the Omani side, Jabal ar Raḩraḩ, at 1,892 m (6,207 ft), is the highest peak in the UAE, with significant prominence.

Infrastructure
On the Omani side, the mountain is largely underdeveloped, inaccessible, and far from any development, however, on the United Arab Emirates side there has been a lot of development in recent years. A 36 km (22 miles) road has been built, which hairpins most of the way up the mountain on the United Arab Emirates side. Near the top of the road, there are parking places, food providers, toilets and a viewing platform. After a security checkpoint, the road continues up a few kilometers further to the world's longest zip-line and an Etisalat cell tower, as well as a large flat area used for outdoor shows and parking. New buildings are also being built along this road section, for use of the zip-line operating company. This section was completed towards the end of 2017; however, it remains closed to the public, by motorized vehicles, as of December 2019. A private brick road then continues further up, to Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi's palace, which is situated near the UAE's highest point. The summit is then accessible by hiking, a short distance after the palace perimeter fence. The mountain is 100 kilometers in width and 700 kilometers in length. It is the highest mountain range in the region.
The road was completed by September 2019.

UAE Tour Road Cycling Race
The mountain, and the highway to its peak, feature prominently in the UAE Tour, an annual road cycling stage race, first held in 2019 as part of the UCI World Tour. Due to the difficulty of the long, steep climb, the stage that finishes here is usually considered the queen stage of the entire UAE Tour. Previous winners of the Jebel Jais stage include Grand Tour and UAE Tour winners Primož Roglič and Tadej Pogačar.

Jebel Jais zip-line
The world's longest zip-line opened on the mountain in February 2018. It is 2,832 m (9,291 ft) long, and users travel at speeds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph), There are, or have been, plans in place to build a hotel, cable car, paragliding launch ramp, golf course and ski slope following the opening of the road. The cost is around $98 to $122 or €89 to €111.

Climate
The temperature of Ras Al Khaimah tends to be lower than in other parts of the country. Temperatures as low as -5 °C have been measured at the top of the mountain in winter. Sometimes humidity  level is likely to increase during night and early morning over some coastal and internal areas. The temperatures at the highest elevations on the mountain tend  to be lower than other parts of the United Arab Emirates, by about ten degrees, except for spots such as the mountains of Hafeet, Yibir, Yanas and Al-Heben.

Snow fall
In January 2009 there was snow on Jebel Jais. This was only the second time snow had been reported in the history of United Arab Emirates, previously having only been seen in 2004. There was less on this occasion. In February 2017 it snowed again on Jebel Jais and the temperatures fell down-to -5 degrees Celsius. In January 2020 a mix of snow and hail covered the mountain with the temperature dropping below zero degrees.
