      "content": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.\n\nEtymology\nAden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word \"Aden\" means resident, and it is said \"Aden Al-Balad\", meaning the settlement of the country. Among the sayings of geographers about the city:\nYaqut al-Hamwi said: \"It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade.\" And it is added to Abyan, which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.\nIbn Manzur said: \"It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen.\"\nIbn Khaldun said: \"This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often.\"\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nAden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name (Ancient Greek: Αραβία Εμπόριον, romanised: Arabia Emporion), which means an Arabic trade port. The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as Eudaemon (Ancient Greek: Ευδαίμων, meaning \"blissful, prosperous\") in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The same work describes Aden as \"a village by the shore\", which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage. Aden was more an island than a peninsula, as the isthmus (a tombolo) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the Book of Ezekiel, which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:\"The merchants of Sheba and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants.\"At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient Indian Ocean trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Awsan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC. In the beginning of the seventh century BC, Karibʾil Watar I, king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Awsan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of Awsan made offerings to the god Almaqah, according to the inscription that Karibʾil Watar I left in Sirwah, commemorating his victory.\nIn the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. Aelius Gallus' Roman expedition to Arabia Felix (26–25 BCE) aimed to capture the Sabaean capital of Marib but failed due to extreme desert conditions, disease, and logistical challenges. After an unsuccessful week-long siege, the army, weakened by illness and dehydration, withdrew, losing most of its ~10,000 troops to environmental factors and disease\" The Himyarites overthrew the Kingdom of Sheba in 275 AD and took control of Aden. Recent incomplete archaeological studies suggest that the Himyarites were the ones who built the huge water cisterns currently known as the \"Cisterns of Aden\", which stored approximately 136,382,757 liters of water.\nThe Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the Sasanian Empire took control of the city in 571 AD.\nA local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that Cain and Abel are buried somewhere in the city.\n\nMedieval history\nAlthough the pre-Islamic Himyar civilisation was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the Hadhramaut make it clear that both the Himyar and the Sabean cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians Ibn al Mujawir and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.\nWith the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD. In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz). It was controlled by the state of Ziyadid and the Sulayhid. After the death of Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi, his son took charge of Zurayids, and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi reduced it. After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids’ preoccupation with the Khawlan tribes. The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids’ control of the city. A major battle took place between Turan Shah bin Ayyub and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz. One of the most important contributors to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in Tihama and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.\nAfter 1175, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since then Aden has been a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from Egypt, Sindh, Gujarat, East Africa and even China. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century. It was visited by the medieval scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century, who described Aden's reservoirs, the Cisterns of Tawila, \"These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens.\"\nDuring the Ayyubid period in Yemen, Sana'a and its environs were more hostile to their presence than other regions. The Zaidi tribes were able to defeat the Ayyubids in 1226, but Omar bin Rasul, the founder of the Rasulid state, was able to repel them, so he tightened his control over Aden. The city regained its position during the days of the Rasulids, so they dug wells and built schools, and Aden flourished commercially. The kings of Bani Rasul were also merchants and enacted a number of laws and regulations to codify trade in the city.\nThe Banu Tahir were able to control Aden after the Banu Rasool, and the Italian traveller Lodovico di Verthama describes it as one of the most powerful cities seen on Earth during the days of the Tahirids.\n\nIn 1513, the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, launched an unsuccessful four-day naval siege of Aden. The Mamluks in Egypt sensed the danger and sent a force led by Hussein al-Kurdi. The victorious King Amer bin Abdul Wahhab provided great aid to the Kurds, but he suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Diu. The Mamluks sent a second fleet, but the victorious king refused to cooperate with the Mamluks because he had succeeded in repelling the Portuguese from Aden without their help. Hussein al-Kurdi became angry and allied with the Zaidi Imam, who was opposed to the Tahirids, al-Mutawakkil Sharaf al-Din, and the Tahirid cities fell successively, with the exception of Aden. The Ottoman Empire took control of the city in 1538. The Ottomans' goal was to prevent the Portuguese from controlling Aden, so the city witnessed difficult days, in addition to the fact that the port of Mocha gained greater importance at the expense of Aden during the sixteenth century. The city's population declined and it turned into a small village with a population of no more than 600 people. While its population was approximately eighty thousand people during the days of the Rasulid state.In 1421, China's Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor ordered principal envoy grand eunuch Li Xing and grand eunuch Zhou Man of Zheng He's fleet to convey an imperial edict with hats and robes to bestow on the king of Aden. The envoys boarded three treasure ships and set sail from Sumatra to the port of Aden. This event was recorded in the book Yingyai Shenglan by Ma Huan who accompanied the imperial envoy.\nAfter Ottoman rule, Aden was ruled by the Sultanate of Lahej, under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the chief rulers on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.\n\nModern history\nThe situation was different in the north of the country, where the Zaidis did not recognise the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of Imam Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim, who and his son Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans. The imams relied on the revenues from the port of Mocha, and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan Fadl al-Abdali concluded an alliance with the Yafi tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolise Aden's revenues equally among them. The Sultan of Lahej got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfil his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognise inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq and Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden. The English had been visiting Aden and Mocha from 1609, led by Sir Henry Middleton, who was imprisoned, his ships confiscated, and eight of his men killed.\nThe British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mocha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for British subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi’ gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars. Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.\n\nBritish administration 1839–1967\nIn 1609 The Ascension was the first English ship to visit Aden, before sailing on to Mocha during the fourth voyage of the East India Company.\nBritish interests in Aden began in 1796 with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their privateers were tracked down over the subsequent decade. By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, Somalis, Jews, and Indians—housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity. As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the East India Company officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or Russian expansion through Persia. The emergence of Muhammad Ali of Egypt as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, Sir Robert Grant, was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing \"places of strength\" to protect the Indian Ocean.\nThe Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship Hugh Lindsay sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the Cape of Good Hope in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coal supplying station had been found. The British first stationed a coal depot on the island of Socotra in 1834. However, due to the lack of suitable infrastructure there, they quickly lost interest in Socotra and turned towards Aden instead.\nIn 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km2 (75 sq mi) including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to definitively conquer the territory (the so-called Aden Expedition) and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from Mokha. The port lies about equidistant from the Suez Canal, Bombay, and Zanzibar, which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an entrepôt and a way-station for ships in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish coal and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until November 1967.\n\nUntil 1937, Aden was governed as part of British India and was known as the Aden Settlement. Its original territory was enlarged in 1857 by the 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi) island of Perim, in 1868 by the 73 km2 (28 sq mi) Khuriya Muriya Islands, and in 1915 by the 108 km2 (42 sq mi) island of Kamaran. The settlement would become Aden Province in 1935.\n\nIn 1937, the settlement was detached from India and became the Colony of Aden, a British Crown colony. The change in government was a step towards the change in the official currency unit. When British India became independent in 1947, Indian rupees (divided into annas) were replaced in Aden by East African shillings. The hinterland of Aden and Hadhramaut were also loosely tied to Britain as the Aden Protectorate, which was overseen from Aden.\n\nAden's location also made it a useful entrepôt for mail passing between places around the Indian Ocean and Europe. Thus, a ship passing from Suez to Bombay could leave mail for Mombasa at Aden for collection (See Postage stamps and postal history of Aden). In December 1947, a three-day riot broke out in reaction to the drafting of the Partition Plan for Palestine. The riots and their repression by the Aden Protectorate Levies saw the killing of 76-82 Jews, 33 Arabs, 4 Muslim Indians and 1 Somali, in addition to looting and damaging of property. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, the British held on to Aden as an outpost in the region for another decade. The British authorities had already decided to further expand its port shortly before the Suez Canal's 1956 closure.\nAden sent a team of two to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nFederation of South Arabia and the Aden Emergency\nIn order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of North Yemen, the British attempted gradually to unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia (FSA).\nAn insurgency against British administration known as the Aden Emergency began with a grenade attack by the communist National Liberation Front (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a \"state of emergency\" was declared.\nIn 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that British troops would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY (Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen) vied for the upper hand.\nIn January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an Aden Airways DC3 plane in the air with no survivors.\nThe increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in From Barren Rocks to Living Stones.\nOn 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The Royal Marines, who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave – with the exception of a Royal Engineer detachment (10 Airfields Squadron left Aden on 13 December 1967). As part of a larger Royal Navy task force, HMS Albion's helicopters lifted off remaining Royal Marine commandos left to secure the airfield.\n\nPost-independence\nThe last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and British support ceased. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country's economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.\nThe new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms. On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership. He was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year, and faced new rebellions from leftist parties in July, August and December 1968. This is because all Arab countries welcomed the front. National Liberation received a cold reception. Regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, where the leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan. They wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.\n\nQahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on 16 June 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to place him under house arrest on 22 June. A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. This group took an extreme leftist line, declaring its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution, and strengthening its relationship with the Soviet Union. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalised foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist–Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established. The port of Aden was the largest source of national income for the Republic of South Yemen, but the closure of the Suez Canal by Egypt between 1967 and 1975 - reduced commercial activities in the port.\nSalem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and made attempts to restore normal relations with Western countries. During his presidency, relations between South Yemen and Saudi Arabia were established in 1976. President Salmin, as he is known, coveted more Soviet support, so the contract with Saudi Arabia worried him. The Soviets pushed them to increase aid, but relations with Saudi Arabia became strained again in 1977 following the assassination of North Yemeni President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. It is believed that Salem Rabie Ali orchestrated the assassination of Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi in revenge for Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Salem Rabie Ali was subjected to a quick trial that ended with his execution and Abdel Fattah Ismail assuming the presidency of South Yemen. Relations with North Yemen became tense, due to Fattah's support for the factions opposing Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was more fanatical than his predecessors. Relations with the Soviet Union became active in an unprecedented way, so the Front War broke out in 1978, in which the Soviet Union and the United States intervened.\nAli Nasser Muhammad was able to force Abd al-Fattah Ismail al-Jawfi to resign for \"health reasons\", and Ismail was exiled to Moscow two years after he assumed the presidency. Despite the approach of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and its removal of tribal aspects, tribalism remained alive among politicians and the public despite the exposure of its sheikhs. Tribes from their authorities. Tribal and regional favouritism and nepotism remained rife in southern Yemen, as political forces called on their tribal and regional affiliations during crises.\n\nBy January 1986, Aden was torn apart by the rivalry of two factions in the ruling Socialist Party, when President Ali Nasser Muhammad's guards launched a surprise attack on the political party's office in Aden on January 13, 1986. This was the beginning of the 1986 civil war in South Yemen. The basis of the war was regional. Ali Nasser Muhammad was from Abyan Governorate, while most of those killed in the political party office were from Al-Dhalea and Lahj. Military brigades from those areas bombed Aden from land and sea, forcing Ali Nasser Muhammad to flee and hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers to flee to northern Yemen, including Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. This was followed by systematic killings and liquidations against the people of Abyan Governorate, on charges that they were collaborating with Ali Nasser Muhammad. Nearly ten thousand people were killed and thousands migrated towards North Yemen, most of whom were from Abyan and Shabwa.\nWith the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of Aden Governorate which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.\nOn 29 December 1992, Al Qaeda conducted its first known terrorist attack in Aden, bombing the Gold Mohur Hotel, where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. A Yemeni and an Austrian tourist died in the attack.\n\nThat war marked the end of the state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas assumed the presidency until May 22, 1990, the unity of South Yemen with North Yemen, and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. At that time, Ali Salem Al-Baidh was considered Ali Abdullah Saleh's deputy, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas was considered prime minister, and after the 1993 elections. Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed. The southern forces, which were transferred to Amran, clashed with the northern forces there, and the forces of the northern giants, which were transferred to Amran, clashed. Abyan with the southern forces, and the political parties signed the 1994 Covenant and Agreement, in the Jordanian capital, on February 20, 1994, in an attempt to end the crisis, and successive events led to the outbreak of the Summer 1994 civil war, and the southern military leaders who fled after the events of 1986 joined the ranks of the forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and supported the Unity Army in the war against their former comrades in 1994 in the war against the separatists. At the forefront of these emerged a group of the brightest officers, such as President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who became Minister of Defense at the time, the former Chief of Staff, Major General Abdullah Aliwa, and Major General Salem Qatan, who was assassinated by an Al-Qaeda gunman. After the war, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi was appointed Vice President of the Republic, and remained in office. He held his position until 2012, when he was elected president of the country.\nMembers of al Qaeda attempted to bomb the US guided-missile destroyer The Sullivans at the port of Aden as part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The boat that had the explosives in it sank, forcing the planned attack to be aborted.\nThe bombing attack on destroyer USS Cole took place in Aden on 12 October 2000.\nIn 2007 growing dissatisfaction with unification led to the formation of the secessionist South Yemen Movement. According to The New York Times, the Movement's mainly underground leadership includes socialists, Islamists and individuals desiring a return to the perceived benefits of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n\nTemporary capital and civil war\nAden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana’a, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2014, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, \"All decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy.\"\nPresident Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the coup d'état that many consider to be the start of the Yemeni civil war. Others consider that the civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sana'a, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government.\nHadi declared in Aden that he was still Yemen's legitimate president and called on state institutions and loyal officials to relocate to Aden. In a televised speech on 21 March 2015, he declared Aden to be Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" while Sana'a is controlled by the Houthis.\nAden was hit by violence in the aftermath of the coup d'état, with forces loyal to Hadi clashing with those loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in a battle for Aden International Airport on 19 March 2015. After the airport battle, the entire city became a battleground for the Battle of Aden, which left large parts of the city in ruins and has killed at least 198 people since 25 March 2015.\nSome Arab and foreign embassies were transferred to Aden, and Defense Minister Mahmoud Al-Subaihi was able to leave Sanaa for Aden and met with President Hadi. On March 4, 2016, unidentified gunmen stormed the Mother Teresa House in the city and killed sixteen people, including four nuns. A number of the old city's churches have also been destroyed by Islamic extremists since mid-2015.\nOn 14 July 2015, the Saudi Arabian Army launched an offensive to win control of the city. Within three days, the city was cleared of Houthi rebels, ending the Battle of Aden with a coalition victory.\nBeginning on 28 January 2018, separatists loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in a coup d'état against the Hadi-led government.\nOn 30 December 2020, the undersecretary of labour and deputy minister of public works were killed along with between 20 and 30 others at the Aden airport while they conducted an international press briefing about their new arrangements with the STC, which includes the partition of forces inside Aden, as they returned from hiding in the Saudi capital. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, his ministers and his entourage were conducted to safety under the barrage of hostile fire.\n\nCulture\nDialects\nThe entry of the Yemenis into Islam contributed to their abandoning their ancient script and replacing it with the late Nabataean alphabet in which the Qur’an was written. Today, Yemenis speak Arabic in the Yemeni dialect, which is a developed dialect and closely linked to the ancient language. It has three dialects with branches: the Sanani dialect, the Hadrami dialect, and the Taizi-Adeni dialect, in addition to the Bedouin dialect of the residents of Marib. Al-Jawf, Shabwa, and Inner Hadhramaut, and each of these dialects has characteristics and features.\n\nMusic and poetry\nAdeni art or the Adeniyat is an art of Arabic music. Among the ancient artists of Aden are Iskander Thabet Saleh and Muhammad Murshid Naji, and among the poets are Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Muhammad, Ahmed Ghaleb Muhammad Al-Jabri, Abdullah Abdul Karim Muhammad, Ali Abdullah Jaafar Aman, Farid Muhammad Barakat, Lotfi Jaafar Aman, and Mohsen Ali Brik.\n\"Adeni music\" played a major role in Aden society, and artists in the Aden dialect were called \"al-Mutariba\", meaning people of music. Adeni music began in 1920 when the army of the Aden Protectorate was formed, and after it the National Guard, where there were teams for those forces and those teams participated On special occasions and weddings.\n\nSports\nPre-independence\nThe first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee’ neighbourhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the \"Recreational Club United\" in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.\nIn 1924, the \"Al-Husseini Sports Club\" was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name \"Al-Bamboot Club\" and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933, the \"Nujoom Al-Layl Club\", Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Islami Club\" (Al-Mawlada) appeared.\nUntil that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the \"Adeniya Sports Association\", after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, Bernard Reilly, as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.\nThis association began holding the first club tournament, which was the \"Rosario Cup Championship\". Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.\nAmong the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.\n\nPost-independence\nAfter independence, the \"Football Federation\" was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the \"Adeniya Sports Association\". The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in Crater, under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.\nIn the \"First General Sports Conference\" in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicisation of the clubs in favour of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.\nOn July 18, 1975, the \"Al-Tilal Sports Club\" appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the \"Yemeni Football Federation\" appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the \"September 26 Cup Competition\" in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana’a, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Aden. There are 9 stadiums in Aden, including the May 22 International Stadium, and 10 sports clubs. In November 2010, Aden hosted the 2010 Arabian Gulf Football Cup.\n\nTourist sites\nAden has several historical and natural sites of interest to visitors. These include:\n\nThe historical British churches, one of which lies empty and semi-derelict in 2019.\nThe Zoroastrian Temple\nThe Cisterns of Tawila—an ancient water-catchment system located in the sub-centre of Crater\nSira Fortress\nThe Aden Minaret\nLittle Ben, a miniature Big Ben Clock Tower overlooking Steamer Point. Built during the colonial period, this was restored in 2012 after 3 decades of neglect since the British withdrawal of 1967.\nThe Landing Pier at Steamer Point is a 19th-century building used by visiting dignitaries during the colonial period, most notably Queen Elizabeth during her 1954 visit to the colony. This building was hit by an airstrike in 2015 and is currently in the process of being restored in 2019.\nThe Crescent Hotel which contained a number of artifacts relating to the Royal Visit of 1954 and which currently remains derelict as a result of a recent airstrike.\nThe Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej/National Museum—The National Museum was founded in 1966 and is located in what used to be the Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej. Northern forces robbed it during the 1994 Civil War, but its collection of pieces remains one of the biggest in Yemen.\nThe Aden Military Museum which features a painting depicting the 20 June 1967 ambush by Arab Police Barracks on a British Army unit when a number of the 22 soldiers killed that day were driving in two Land Rovers on Queen Arwa Road, Crater.\nThe Rimbaud House, which opened in 1991, is the two-story house of French poet Arthur Rimbaud who lived in Aden from 1880 to 1891. Rimbaud moved to Aden on his way to Ethiopia in an attempt for a new life. As of the late 1990s, the first floor of the house belonged to the French Consulate, a cultural centre and a library. The house is located in al-Tawahi—the European Quarter of Aden—and is politically and culturally debated for its French nature in an area previously colonised by Britain.\nThe fortifications of Jebal Hadid and Jebal Shamsan\nThe beaches of Aden and Little Aden—Some of the popular beaches in Aden consist of Lover's Bay Beach, Elephant Beach and Gold Beach. The popular beach in Little Aden is called Blue Beach. Some beaches are private and some are public, which is subject to change over time due to the changing resort industry. According to the Wall Street Journal, kidnappings on the beaches and the threat of Al Qaeda has caused problems for the resort industry in Aden, which used to be popular among locals and Westerners.\nAl-Aidaroos Mosque\nMain Pass – now called Al-Aqba Road is the only road into Aden through Crater. Originally an Arched Upper bridge known as Main Gate, it overlooked Aden city and was built during the Ottoman Empire. A painted crest of the 24th British army battalion is still visible on the brickwork adjacent to the Gate site and is believed to be the only remaining army Crest from colonial rule still visible in Aden. In March 1963 the bridge was removed by a British Army controlled explosion to widen the 2 lane roadway to the present 4 lane highway and the only reminder of this bridge is a quarter scale replica built at the end of the Al-Aqba road intersection known as the AdenGate Model roundabout.\n\nEconomy and transportation\nThe industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a centre to supply ships with fuel.\nHistorically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial centre for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.\n\nTransport\nHistorically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations centre. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernisation and built Aden International Airport, known today, next to the military airport. Al-Yamda Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the Battle of Aden Airport and the 2015 military intervention in Yemen closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.  On 22 July, Aden International Airport was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months. The same day, a ship chartered by the World Food Programme carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.\nHistorically, Aden's harbour has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was 13 by 6 km (8 by 4 mi) in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called Tawahi.\nDuring the British colonial period motor vehicles drove on the left, as in the United Kingdom. On 2 January 1977, Aden, along with the rest of South Yemen, changed to driving on the right, bringing it into line with neighbouring Arab states.\nDuring the early 20th century, Aden was a prominent export centre for coffee grown in the Jubail highlands. And also to export frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa and millet, which are produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stems of clover, millet, and corn produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. Beginning in 1920, Aden was desalinating seawater to produce table salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced more than 120,000 tons of salt. Aden also produced potash, which was exported to Mumbai.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Aden would import goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, the British described it as \"the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports.\" At the docks, the city provided coal to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was salt. Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the Bab-el-Mandeb; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. Yemen Airlines, the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden. On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with Yemenia.\nDuring the early 20th century Aden was a notable centre of coffee production. Women processed coffee beans, grown in the Yemen highlands. Frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and millet was also produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stalks of the alfalfa, millet and maize produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. As of 1920, Aden was also gathering salt from salt water. An Italian company called Agostino Burgarella Ajola and Company gathered and process the salt under the name Aden Salt Works. There was also a smaller company from India, called Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalji & Company that owned a salt production firm in Aden. Both companies exported the salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced over 120,000 tons of salt. Aden has also produced potash, which was generally exported to Mumbai.\nAden produced jollyboats. Charcoal was produced as well, from acacia, and mainly in the interior of the region. Cigarettes were produced by Jewish and Greek populations in Aden. The tobacco used was imported from Egypt.\nSince the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War spread to Aden in 2015, the city has been struck by constant protests over a range of issues, but especially concerning electricity generation. Aden's power grid is composed solely of diesel generators and is thus heavily dependent on imported fuel. The main power plant is al-Hasswa diesel power plant, which in June 2021 had only two turbines out of five running, producing up to 50 megawatts (MW) of power in a region where the deficit hovers around 300 MW. Nawfal al-Mojamal, the plant director, said \"In its 35 years of existence, al-Hasswa station never had any kind of maintenance, except in 2016 ... when the two turbines were restored\".\n\nFree zone\nThe free zone, which was opened in 1991, represents Yemen's economic gateway and the meeting point of the continents of Asia and Africa. The free zone gains its strategic importance from the special location of the port of Aden, as it is located directly on the main trade route around the world and from the Middle East to Europe and America, and is distinguished by the possibility of providing transit services. To East Africa, the Red Sea, the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Gulf. The free zone represents a storage and distribution area suitable for Africa, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.\n\nGeography and climate\nGeography\nAden is located on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, and is about 363 kilometres away from the capital, Sana’a. It is located between latitudes 47 and 12 north of the equator, and at an altitude of 6 metres above sea level. It is surrounded by Lahj Governorate to the north and east, and the Governorate of Abyan is from the northwest, and Aden has an air port represented by Aden International Airport, and a sea port represented by the port of Aden, and it has land routes from the north linking it to Hajj, Abyan and Taiz.\n\nLandforms\nThe city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.\nThe surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.\n\nClimate\nAden has a hot desert climate (BWh) in the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. Although Aden sees next to no precipitation year-round, it is humid throughout the year.\n\nEnvironment\nCoasts\nMost of the coasts of Aden Governorate along the coastal strip are sandy coasts, and the governorate has coastal beaches, including the Golden Coast in Al-Tawahi District, the coast of Abyan Bakhour Maksar, Al-Ghadeer Beach, and Kud Al-Nimr Beach in Buraiqa.\n\nOffshore islands\nThere are about 21 islands around the peninsulas of Aden, Aden Lesser, and Ras Amran. They are mostly rocky islands, some of which are surrounded by incomplete coral reefs, and most of them are considered fishing areas. A number of islands have many activities, especially on Al-Ummal Island and Sirah Island.\n\nWild and domestic animal diversity\nYemen is considered one of the countries rich in bird species in the Middle East due to the availability of many suitable coastal environments that helped attract many migratory birds to wetland sites, coasts and islands. The Aden region (Khor Maksar - Al-Haswah) was registered on the list of important areas of the World Bird Organization as a habitat. The last three species that are globally threatened with extinction are: the great eagle, the gull eagle, and the eastern king eagle.\nThere are dozens of bird species recorded in the wetlands of Aden and the Caltex swamp area, which are rich in a wide variety of endemic and migratory birds, including birds that are present throughout the year. There are many birds in the area, including great flamingos, dwarf flamingos, and rock egrets. And the spoonbill, the hooked tern and the seagull.\n\nPublic services\nEducation\nThere are 95 schools in Aden, including 13 kindergartens, and 82 basic education schools, including 29 schools for boys, 29 schools for girls, and 29 joint schools for boys and girls. There are also 29 secondary schools, including 15 schools for boys and 14 schools for girls, all of which are in a double shift system.

More than 29 thousand students are enrolled, according to 2010 statistics.\n\nHealth\nThere are 15 hospitals in the economic capital, Aden, including 5 public government hospitals, 6 belonging to the private sector, and 37 health centres. There are 34 facilities in the city that provide maternity and childhood services, and the number of specialised workforce in health facilities is 2,825 specialists.\n\nEndemic areas\nIn June 2015, the International Red Cross team present in conflict areas in Yemen during the events of the Yemeni civil war announced that the cities of Crater, Al-Mualla, Khor Maksar and Al-Tawahi in the Aden Governorate in the south of the country were areas affected by dengue fever. The health authorities in Aden said that this fever had spread remarkably and widely. Since the beginning of May, health services have deteriorated and infrastructure facilities, such as electricity, water, and sanitation, have been damaged as a result of the ongoing fighting in the city for months.\n\nMail\nAden has known mail since June 15, 1839, that is, a year after the British occupation, although the official post office was not inaugurated until 1857. Postage stamps of both Britain and India were used in Aden until it became called the Aden Colony on April 1, 1937, although the stamps of this stage It bears no distinctive sign, but the use of the number 124 as a postal code is attributed to Aden as part of the Indian postal numerical system.\nThen, when it became a colony in 1937, it had sets of postage stamps containing pictures and the name Aden printed on them. In 1939, a new postage set was issued containing a picture of King George VI, but the Sultans of Hadhramaut - who were under the umbrella of the Aden Protectorate - controlled Britain has had it since the 1880s - they refused to do so, and so Britain issued a separate postal set in 1942, but this time with the inclusion of a phrase and pictures expressing the Kathiri Sultanate in Sayun and the Qu’aiti Sultanate in Shihr and Mukalla, in addition to pictures of the sultans.\n\nMedia\nJournalism\nThe weekly Al-Amal newspaper was founded in 1957 in Aden. Its slogan was (Freedom, Bread, and Peace). The British authorities allowed only 1,500 copies to be printed weekly, and the newspaper was banned shortly after.\nIn 1958, Al-Ayyam newspaper was established in Aden, as an independent daily newspaper in the Arabic language, during the British occupation. The first issue was published on July 30, 1958, and its founder and editor-in-chief was Brigadier General Muhammad Ali Bashraheel. It stopped publishing after independence during the era of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and then resumed publication. After achieving Yemeni unity, the first issue of the second edition was on November 7, 1990, after a hiatus that lasted more than 23 years.

      "summary": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.",

      "content": "عَدَن هي مدينة يمنية تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمة الاقتصادية لليمن، وثاني أهم مدينة يمنية بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن أحداثاً تاريخية هامة، وعرفت بأنها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمة حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمة، مما يجعلها واحدة من أكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظة عدن ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر أهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الأحمر، وتشكل عدن أنموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الإنتاجي، إذ جمعت بين الأنشطة الصناعية والسمكية والتجارية والسياحية والخدمية، وتنبع أهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من أهم الموانئ في المنطقة، ومنطقة تجارة حرة إقليمية ودولية. تكتسب المدينة أهميتها السياحية من شواطئها الدافئة ومنتجعاتها الجميلة، وتكتسب الصناعة مقوماتها من مجموعة مصانع ووحدات إنتاجية أهمها «مصفاة عدن». تتكون عدن من عدة مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصورة، دار سعد، البريقة.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كأحد المدن ذات العلاقة التجارية مع صور اللبنانية كون عدن كانت أحد المحطات المهمة لتجارة التوابل التي انتعشت لمدة ألفية كاملة. كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. وكانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة،  وشن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون إسقاط مملكة سبأ عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الإمبراطورية الساسانية على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الإسلام إلى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الإسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226، إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدولة الطاهرية وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياماً عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخاء اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينة عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. وخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، أصبحت عدن أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963،  أعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز. وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير بقيادة قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الإنجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية برئاسة قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمة للدولة.\nقامت الحركة التصحيحية باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وأدخلت العامل الأيديولوجي الماركسي في جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية وغيّرت اسمها إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وبدأوا بتأميم قطاعات واسعة من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القادة الشباب الجدد أول خطة خمسية لجميع المحافظات الجنوبية. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي أدت لاندلاع الحرب الأهلية في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينة عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحدة اليمنية واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد أربعة سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكومية السيطرة على المدينة، أعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمة. وظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  التي أعلن الرئيس هادي أنها عاصمة مؤقتة لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. إلا أن هذا القرار لم يكن سوى إعلانًا رمزيًا حيث أن تغيير العاصمة في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على أن الأخيرة لا تزال هي العاصمة.\n\nالتسمية\nعدن هي موطن ومقام للسفن وكلمة عدن تعني أقام بالمكان فكلمة «عادن» تعني مقيم ويقال «عدن البلد» أي توطن البلد.، ومن أقوال الجغرافيين عن المدينة:\n\nقال ياقوت الحموي: «هي مدينة مشهورة على ساحل بحر الهند من ناحية اليمن ردئة لا ماء بها ولا مرعى وشربهم من عين بينها وبين عدن مسيرة نحو اليوم وهو مع ذلك ردئ إلا أن هذا الموضع هو مرفأ مراكب الهند والتجار يجتمعون إليه لأجل ذلك فإنها بلدة تجارة، وتضاف إلى أبين وهو مخلاف عدن من جملته.»\nقال ابن منظور:«هي بلد على سيف البحر في أقصى بلاد اليمن.»\nقال ابن خلدون:«وعدن هذه من أمنع مدائن اليمن وهي على ضفة البحر الهندي وما زالت بلد تجارة من عهد التبابعة وأكثر بنائهم بالأخصاص ولذلك يطرقها تجار الحرير كثيراً.»\nوعن باب عدن قال الهمداني:«وهو شصر مقطوع في جبل كان محيطاً بموضع عدن من الساحل فلم يكن لها طريق إلى البر إلا للرّجل لمن ركب ظهر الجبل فقطع في الجبل باب مبلغ عرض الجبل حتى سلكه الدواب والجمال والمحامل والمحفات.»\n\nالتاريخ\nالتاريخ القديم\nعدن ميناء قديم وذكرها اليونان باسم (يونانية:Αραβία Εμπόριον - Arabia Emporion) وتعني ميناء تجارة العربية وذكرت عدن صراحة باسمها هذا في سفر حزقيال الذي يتحدث عن أورشليم وجاء فيه: \n\nكانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذا شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. كانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة من القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م  في بدايات القرن السابع ق.م، شن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان قُتل خلالها وفق النصوص السبئية ستة عشر ألف قتيل وتم استعباد أربعين ألف نسمة وتقديم ملوك أوسان قرابين للإله إيل مقه وفقا للكتابة التي كربئيل وتر الأول تركها في صرواح مخلداً فيها انتصاره.\nفي النصف الثاني من القرن الأول ق.م، عزم الإمبراطور الروماني أغسطس قيصر السيطرة على العربية السعيدة وبلوغ المحيط الهندي. وأُرسل حاكم مصر الروماني أيليوس غالوس عام 25 ق.م وانتهت الحملة بنتائج كارثية وفناء الجيش الروماني أمام أسوار مأرب. أسقط الحِميَّريون مملكة سبأ عام 275 للميلاد وسيطروا على عدن. دراسات أثرية حديثة غير مكتملة، ترجح أن الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمة المعروفة حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابة 136,382,757 لتر من الماء.\nسقطت مملكة حمير في الربع الأول من القرن السادس قبل الميلاد وذكر يوسف ذو نواس باب المندب في إحدى كتاباته فقد كانت قوات مملكة أكسوم تدخل اليمن من خلاله، أرسل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول أسطولاً لقتال اليهود الحِميَّريين ودعم مملكة أكسوم ومسيحيي نجران، دخل الأسطول عن طريق عدن. تشير المصادر البيزنطية أن الإمبراطورية الساسانية سيطرت على المدينة عام 671 للميلاد.\n\nالتاريخ الوسيط\nمع دخول الإسلام إلى اليمن في القرن السابع الميلادي، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. كانت عدن في سنين الإسلام الأولى تتبع مخلاف الجند (تعز) سيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد والصليحيون وبعد وفاة علي بن محمد الصليحي قام ابنه المكرم بتولية بنو زريع واستمرت عدن بتأدية الإتاوة السنوية حتى خفضتها الملكة أروى بنت أحمد الصليحي. عقب سقوط الدولة الصليحية استقل بنو زريع بعدن مستغلين انشغال الصليحيين بقبائل خولان. استمر الزريعيون بحكم عدن ولحج وأبين لأقل من أربعين سنة حتى سقطوا بسيطرة الأيوبيين على المدينة. دارت معركة كبيرة بين توران شاه بن أيوب وياسر بن بلال المحمدي وزير الدولة الزريعية وهزم الزريعيون وهرب المحمدي إلى تعز. من أهم الأسباب التي ساهمت في هزيمة الزريعيين كانت حروبهم المتواصلة مع بني مهدي في تهامة وخروج جيشهم لملاقاة الأيوبيين عوضا عن التحصن في عدن.\nخلال فترة الأيوبيين في اليمن، كانت صنعاء وما يجاورها أكثر رفضا لوجودهم من سواها من المناطق. تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226 إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجاريا. فقد كان ملوك بني رسول تجاراً كذلك وسنّوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة.\nتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودوفيكو دي فيرثاما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين.\n\nبدأ البرتغاليون بالتوسع في المحيط الهندي وبحلول العام 1498 م أدركوا أن عدن مفتاحهم لدخول البحر الأحمر. فاستشعر المماليك في مصر الخطر وأرسلوا قوة بقيادة حسين الكردي، قدم الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب مساعدات كبيرة للكردي ولكنه تعرض لهزيمة فادحة في معركة ديو. أرسل المماليك أسطولا ثانيا ولكن الملك الظافر رفض التعاون مع المماليك كونه نجح في صد البرتغاليين عن عدن دون عون منهم. غضب حسين الكردي وتحالف مع الإمام الزيدي المناوئ للطاهريين المتوكل شرف الدين وسقطت مدن الطاهريين تباعا باستثناء عدن. سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصبا على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياما عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخا اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nكانت الأوضاع مختلفة في شمال البلاد، حيث لم يعترف الزيدية بسلطة العثمانيين وثاروا مرات عديدة ضدهم آخرها ثورة الإمام المنصور بالله القاسم بن محمد بن القاسم الذي تمكن وابنه المؤيد بالله محمد توحيد القبائل وطرد العثمانيين. اعتمد الأئمة على مداخيل ميناء المخا ولم تكن عدن بتلك الأهمية التي ولي عليها العبادلة. على أواخر القرن الثامن عشر، عقد السلطان فضل العبدلي حلفا مع قبائل يافع على التمرد على الأئمة الزيدية واحتكار مداخيل عدن بينهم مناصفة. تخلص سلطان لحج من الأئمة ولكنه لم يف بوعده ليافع. كان الأئمة الزيدية لا يعترفون بالتوريث ويرون القتال لأجل الإمامة فطالت الحرب بين الناصر محمد بن إسحاق والمنصور الحسين بن المتوكل فانتهز العبدلي الفرصة ليعلن استقلاله بلحج وعدن. كان الإنجليز يزورون عدن والمخا من عام 1609 بقيادة السير هنري ميدلتون الذي سُجن وصودرت سفنه وقتل ثمانية من رجاله.\nحاول الإنجليز عقد معاهدات مع الأئمة الزيدية عقب إخراج العثمانيين من عدن، فزاروا صنعاء والمخا ولكنهم عاملوا سفير الإنجليز معاملة سيئة ورفضوا عرضه. كانت الأمور مختلفة عندما استقل العبادلة بلحج والمدينة، فوقعوا معاهدة مع الإنجليز عام 1802 تقضي ببنائهم مصنعا في كريتر وخصص مقبرة خاصة للرعايا الإنجليز مجاناَ، كان العبدلي يريد الحماية الإنجليزية من القبائل. قُتل السلطان فضل بن علي من قبل مسلحي يافع ثم غزا أحد مشايخ الحجرية لحج وحاصرها لخمسة أشهر وحاصرها العوالق كذلك بثمانية آلاف مقاتل ولم يغادروا إلا بعد أن دفع لهم السلطان أحمد بن عبد الكريم سبعة آلاف دولار. ثم هاجم آل فضل عدن سنة 1836.\n\nالاحتلال البريطاني\nأحكمت الإمبراطورية البريطانية سيطرتها على المدينة في يناير 1839، بسبعمائة من المشاة وقتلت 150 من المقاومة العدنية. ووفقاً للرواية الإنجليزية، فإن باخرة هندية تابعة لبريطانيا حطت رحالها في عدن عام 1837، فهاجمها عرب من عدن وسرقوا كل ما بداخلها. فقام الكابتن «ستافورد هاينز» بزيارة عدن في 28 ديسمبر من نفس السنة، وألتقى بسلطان لحج الذي نفى أي علاقة له بالحادثة، ولكن الكابتن هاينز لم يصدقه كونه رأى بضاعة السفينة تباع علناً في سوق المدينة، وفقا للرواية الإنجليزية. فطالب الإنجليز السلطان بدفع تعويضات قدرها 12,000 دولار دفع منها السلطان 7,808 على أن يعيد الباقي خلال سنة وأن يتخلى عن عدن للإنجليز مقابل معاش سنوي قدره 8,700 دولار،  إلا إن ابن السلطان العبدلي رفض المعاهدة، وقاتل الإنجليز فنزل الكابتن سميث بسبعمائة من المشاة محذراً ابن السلطان مطالباً إياه بالالتزام بالمعاهدة، فرفض السلطان وقُتل من الإنجليز خمسة عشر جنديا مقابل 150 عدني وكان عدد سكان المدينة حينها لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة.\n\nحاول العبادلة وآل فضل عام 1841 مهاجمة الإنجليز في عدن بقوة تعدادها خمسة آلاف مقاتل، تصدى الإنجليز لها وخسرت القبائل مئتي رجل وتراجعوا. أعلن الكابتن ستافورد هاينز عدن منطقة حرة. فانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود، واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود، واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. عام 1872، عاد العثمانيون إلى شمال اليمن وأسسوا ولاية اليمن وقسموها لأربع ألوية لواء صنعاء، لواء تعز، لواء عسير، ولواء الحديدة ولم يعترف العثمانيون بسلطة الإنجليز في الجنوب فسيطروا على الضالع التي فر سلطانها إلى عدن طالباً العون من الإنجليز. فسيطر الإنجليز على الضالع وأجبروا العثمانيين على ترسيم الحدود، وذلك الترسيم هو ما قسم اليمن إلى «شمال» و«جنوب»،  وتذكر المصادر البريطانية أن العرب لم يهتموا بهذا الخط الفاصل تلك الأيام،  وكان الأئمة الزيدية يقاتلون العثمانيين دون توقف، فأُنهك العثمانيون وتمكن الإمام يحيى حميد الدين إجبارهم على الاستسلام. ودعا الإمام يحيى القبائل المحمية من الإنجليز للوحدة، فعمد الإنجليز لتبني سياسات أكثر صرامة لحماية مصالحهم وعززوا من المشاعر الانفصالية.\nخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، كانت عدن قد أصبحت أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وكانت عدن جزءاً من الهند البريطانية إلى أن أصبحت مستعمرة عام 1937. وبحلول الخمسينيات أدرك الإنجليز أنهم لن يستطيعوا الاستمرار بإدارة عدن مباشرة، ففكروا بإقامة كيان بعيد عن موجة القومية العربية التي اجتاحت المنطقة، فأقاموا ما أسموه اتحاد إمارات الجنوب العربي، وهو اتحاد فيدرالي يشمل المحميات الغربية حول عدن ولكنه فشل لافتقار المشيخات للخبرة في الحكم،  وعارضت سلطنة لحج الاتحاد وكان هناك خلاف بين السلاطين عن هوية رئيسه.\n\nوبالإضافة لرفض السلطنة الكثيرية والسلطنة القعيطية التي كانتا تسيطران على حضرموت وسلطان سلطنة المهرة إقامة حكم اتحادي يجمعهم، ورفض النخبة الاجتماعية المتعلمة التي كانت مسيطرة على عدن الاتحاد مع المشيخات التي اعتبروها متخلفة وأمية إلى حد كبير. بينما كانت المشيخات تخشى إسقاطها في أسوأ السيناريوهات أو نفوذ سياسي محدود بهيمنة النخبة العدنية.\nففشل الاتحاد وأقام الإنجليز اتحاد الجنوب العربي، ولم يستمر لاشتعال ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963. اندلعت ثورة أكتوبر بسبب قتل البريطانيين لسبعة مواطنين من ردفان، وتأثراً بثورة 26 سبتمبر، وظهرت حركات مقاومة مثل جبهة التحرير القومية المدعومة من الجيش المصري، وأعلنت حالة الطوارئ (إنجليزية: Aden Emergency) في 10 ديسمبر 1963، عندما ألقى عناصر من جبهة التحرير القومية قنبلة أدت إلى مقتل المندوب البريطاني السامي. فأعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968، وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سمي ب«ًا لمقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nخرج آخر جندي بريطاني من عدن في 30 نوفمبر 1967، وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير اليد العليا على حساب جبهة تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل التي انقسم أعضائها ما بين منضم للجبهة القومية أو الرحيل لشمال اليمن، فرحل عبد الله الأصنج ومحمد باسندوة لشمال اليمن. تولى قحطان الشعبي رئاسة الدولة الجديدة وتم ضم مشيخات المحمية الشرقية في حضرموت والمهرة إلى الدولة الجديدة. تولى الشعبي دولة جديدة باقتصاد منهار، فغادر العمال المدنيين ورجال الأعمال وتوقف الدعم الإنجليزي وكان لإغلاق قناة السويس عام 1967 دوراً هاماً في اقتصاد الدولة فقد قلل عدد السفن العابرة لعدن بنسبة 75%.\nقسمت الدولة الجديدة لست محافظات في 11 ديسمبر 1967، وذلك لإنهاء لمظاهر القبلية في الدولة وتجاهل الحدود القبلية بين المشيخات البائدة. وفي 20 مارس 1968 عزل قحطان كل القيادات اليسارية من الحكومة وعضوية الحزب وتمكن من إخماد تمرد قادته فصائل يسارية في الجيش من شهر مايو نفس العام، وواجه تمردات جديدة من اطراف يسارية في شهور يوليو، أغسطس وديسمبر من 1968. ذلك أن كل الدول العربية استقبلت الجبهة القومية للتحرير استقبالاً بارداً، فأنظمة مثل مصر أرادوا دمج الجبهة القومية مع جبهة تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل،  حيث كان القسم اليساري أكثر عدداً من أنصار قحطان الشعبي، وأراد هؤلاء نظاما يقود الجموع ويواجه التحديات الكبيرة التي تواجه الدولة الجديدة أهمها إفلاس الخزينة.\nقام قحطان الشعبي بفصل وزير الداخلية محمد علي هيثم في 16 يونيو 1969، ولكن الأخير بعلاقاته مع القبائل والجيش، أعاد تجميع القوى اليسارية التي فرقها الرئيس قحطان الشعبي، وتمكنوا من اعتقاله ووضعه رهن الإقامة الجبرية في 22 يونيو من نفس العام،  وشُكِّلَت لجنة رئاسية من خمسة أشخاص، سالم رُبيِّع علي الذي أصبح رئيساً ومحمد صالح العولقي وعلي عنتر وعبد الفتاح إسماعيل ومحمد علي هيثم الذي أصبح رئيسا للوزراء. واتخذت هذه المجموعة خطاً يسارياً متطرفاً، فأعلنت تأييدها للفلسطينيين ولثورة ظفار وقوت علاقتها مع الاتحاد السوفيتي، فقطعت ألمانيا الغربية علاقتها بالدولة لاعترافها بألمانيا الشرقية وقطعت الولايات المتحدة علاقتها كذلك في أكتوبر عام 1969، وقامت القوى الجديدة بإصدار دستور جديد، تأميم البنوك الأجنبية وشركات التأمين وغيروا اسم الدولة إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية تماشيا مع منهج الماركسية اللينينية الذي انتهجوه. وتم تأسيس اقتصاد مخطط مركزيا. وكان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، ولكن إغلاق قناة السويس من قبل إسرائيل - عندما ضربت سفينة داخل المياه المصرية الإقليمية - قلل من النشاطات التجارية في الميناء.\nأراد سالم ربيع علي تبنّي منهجا عملياً، فتواصل مع رئيس اليمن الشمالي إبراهيم الحمدي وكان يريد علاقات طبيعية مع الدول الغربية، وفي عهده تأسست العلاقات بين اليمن الجنوبي والسعودية عام 1976،  كان الرئيس سالمين كما يُعرف، يطمع لمزيد من الدعم السوفييتي فعقد العلاقات مع السعودية أقلق السوفييت ودفعهم لزيادة المساعدات ولكن العلاقات مع السعودية توترت من جديد عام 1977 عقب اغتيال رئيس اليمن الشمالي إبراهيم الحمدي،  ويُعتقد أن سالم ربيع علي دبر عملية اغتيال أحمد حسين الغشمي انتقاماً لإبراهيم الحمدي. فخضع سالم ربيع علي لمحاكمة سريعة انتهت بإعدامه وتولي عبد الفتاح إسماعيل رئاسة اليمن الجنوبي. وتوترت العلاقات مع شمال اليمن، بسبب دعم فتاح للفصائل المعارضة لعلي عبد الله صالح وكان أكثر تعصباً ممن سبقه ونشطت العلاقات مع الاتحاد السوفيتي على نحو غير مسبوق، فقامت حرب الجبهة عام 1978 تدخل فيها الاتحاد السوفيتي والولايات المتحدة.\n\nتمكن علي ناصر محمد من إجبار عبد الفتاح إسماعيل الجوفي على الاستقالة لـ«أسباب صحية» ونفي إسماعيل إلى موسكو بعد أقل من سنتين على توليه الرئاسة،  رغم منهج جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وإزالتها للمظاهر القبلية، إلا أن القبيلة بقيت حية في السياسيين والعامة رغم تعرية مشايخ القبائل من سلطاتهم، فالمحاباة والمحسوبية القبلية والمناطقية بقيت في جنوب اليمن إذ كانت القوى السياسية تستدعي انتمائتها القبلية والمناطقية خلال الأزمات.\nوبحلول يناير 1986 كانت عدن ممزقة بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي الحاكم، عندما أقدم حراس الرئيس علي ناصر محمد على هجوم مفاجئ على مكتب الحزب السياسي في عدن في 13 يناير 1986، فكانت تلك بداية حرب 1986 الأهلية في جنوب اليمن. كان أساس الحرب مناطقيا، فعلي ناصر محمد من محافظة أبين بينما كان جل المقتولين في مكتب الحزب السياسي من الضالع ولحج. فقامت ألوية عسكرية من تلك المناطق بقصف عدن من البر والبحر، مما أجبر علي ناصر محمد على الهرب ونزح مئات الآلاف من المدنيين والعسكريين لشمال اليمن منهم عبد ربه منصور هادي. ولحق ذلك عمليات قتل وتصفية ممنهجة ضد أبناء محافظة أبين، بتهمة أنهم كانوا متعاونين مع علي ناصر محمد، فقُتل قرابة عشرة آلاف شخص وهاجر الآلاف نحو اليمن الشمالي جلهم كان من أبين وشبوة.\n\nوشكلت تلك الحرب نهاية دولة جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وتولى حيدر أبو بكر العطاس الرئاسة حتى 22 مايو 1990 واندماج اليمن الجنوبي مع اليمن الشمالي وقيام الجمهورية اليمنية، واعتبر حينها علي سالم البيض نائبا لعلي عبد الله صالح، وحيدر أبو بكر العطاس رئيساً للحكومة، وبعد انتخابات 1993، بدأت الصراعات ضمن الائتلاف الحاكم وقام نائب الرئيس علي سالم البيض بالاعتكاف في عدن، في أغسطس 1993 وتدهور الوضع الأمني العام في البلاد، وفشل الدمج التام للجيشين، فاشتبكت القوات الجنوبية التي نُقلت إلى عمران مع القوات الشمالية هناك، واشتبكت قوات العمالقة الشمالية التي نقلت إلى إبين مع القوات الجنوبية، ووقعت الأطراف السياسية على وثيقة العهد والاتفاق 1994، في العاصمة الأردنية، في 20 فبراير 1994، لمحاولة إنهاء الأزمة، وأدت الأحداث المتتابعة إلى اندلاع حرب صيف 1994، والتحق القادة العسكريين الجنوبيين الفارين بعد أحداث 1986 بصفوف القوات الموالية للرئيس السابق علي عبد الله صالح،  وساندوا جيش الوحدة في الحرب ضد رفاقهم السابقين عام 1994 في الحرب على الانفصاليين. وفي طليعة هؤلاء برزت مجموعة من ألمع الضباط، مثل الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي الذي أصبح وزير الدفاع آنذاك، ورئيس الأركان السابق اللواء عبد الله عليوة، واللواء سالم قطن الذي اغتاله مسلح قاعدي، وبعد الحرب عُيّن عبد ربه منصور هادي نائباً لرئيس الجمهورية، وظل في منصبه حتى 2012، عندما انتخب رئيساً للبلاد.\n\nالعاصمة المؤقتة عدن\nظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي ل25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله من القصر الجمهوري بعدن، وأعلن هادي عدن عاصمة مؤقتة في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلاً من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. وذلك بعد سيطرة الحوثيين على صنعاء في 21 سبتمبر 2015، وفرضهم حصاراً على القصر الجمهوري ومنزل الرئيس هادي في 20 يناير، وقدم هادي استقالته في 22 يناير إلى البرلمان الذي لم يعقد جلسة لقبول الاستقالة أو رفضها، وظل هادي قيد الإقامة الجبرية التي فرضها الحوثيون عليه، حتى تمكن من المغادرة إلى عدن في 21 فبراير 2015،  وتراجع عن استقالته، وأعلن بياناً قال فيه «أن جميع القرارات التي اتخذت من 21 سبتمبر باطلة ولا شرعية لها».\nونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  وتمكن وزير الدفاع محمود الصبيحي من مغادرة صنعاء إلى عدن والتقى فيها الرئيس هادي.\nفي 4 مارس 2016، اقتحم مسلحون مجهولون دار الأم تريزا في المدينة وقتلوا ستة عشر شخصاً بينهن أربع راهبات. كما تعرضت عدد من كنائس المدينة القديمة للتدمير على يد متطرفين إسلاميين منذ منتصف العام 2015.\n\nالتركيبة السكانية\nبلغ عدد سكان عدن 865,000 نسمة بحسب الإسقاط السكاني لعام 2015،  ووفقاً لنتائج التعداد السكاني لعام 2004 م كان تعداد عدن 589,419 نسمة، وهو يشكل ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن. ينمو عدد السكان بمعدل 3.77% سنوياً.\n\nسكان المديريات\nيتوزع السكان والمساكن والأسر على مستوى المديريات على النحو التالي:\n\nالتوزيع الحضري\nشهدت كل محافظات اليمن تحولات هامة في نسبة سكان الريف والحضر، بين تعداد اليمن 1994 وتعداد 2004 وتمثل هذا التحول في نمو سكان الحضر، حيث تشير نتائج تعداد 1994م أن نسبة سكان الحضر كانت (23,5%) بينما ارتفعت هذه النسبة لتصل عام 2004م إلى حوالي (28,64%)، مما يؤكد أن النمط الريفي هو السائد في الجمهورية اليمنية. وقد شهدت اليمن نمواً في سكان الحضر في المدن الرئيسة بشكل أكبر من المدن الأخرى ويتضح ذلك من خلال نمو السكان في العاصمة صنعاء ومدينة عدن والحديدة حيث يمثل الحضر في العاصمة صنعاء 97,7% بينما يمثل الريف 3.3% وتصل النسبة إلى 100% في عدن إلا أن التحضر في المدن الرئيسية في اليمن وخاصة العاصمة صنعاء تحضر زائف حيث ينتقل السكان من الريف إلى المدينة مع احتفاظهم بعاداتهم وتقاليدهم دون تغيير ومنها العادات السيئة كما أن الهجرة لا تغير من مستوى معيشة الفرد لتصبح الهجرة مجرد تغيير مكان الإقامة.\n\nالجغرافيا والمناخ\nالموقع\nتقع عدن على ساحل خليج عدن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي (363) كيلو متراً، وتقع بين دائرتي عرض 47- 12 شمال خط الاستواء،  وعلى ارتفاع 6 متر عن مستوى سطح البحر، وتحيط بها محافظة لحج من الشمال والشرق، ومحافظة أبين من الشمال الغربي، ولعدن منفذ جوي يتمثل في مطار عدن الدولي، ومنفذ بحري يتمثل في ميناء عدن، ولها طرق برية من الشمال يربطها بلحج وأبين وتعز.\n\nالتضاريس\nمدينة عدن مدينة ساحلية، حيث تطل على مسطح مائي كبير هو خليج عدن، الذي بدوره ينفتح على المحيط الهندي، كما أن شكل مدينة عدن بشكل شبه جزيرتين ساعد هذا العامل لتنفرد مدينة عدن بهذه الخصوصية مما أثر ذلك بشكل واضح في حدوث ظاهرة نسيم البر والبحر، التي تحدث بفعل التبادل الهوائي لليابسة والماء أثناء الليل والنهار، كما أثر موقعها من السطح المائي في المدى الحراري اليومي والسنوي، ولا يعني ذلك بأنه لا توجد فروق كبيرة في درجات الحرارة بالنسبة للصيف والشتاء.\nينحدر سطح مدينة عدن جنوباً، وتظهر المرتفعات في الجزء الجنوبي من عدن متمثلة في مرتفعات جبل شمسان التي تزيد أعلى قممها عن 500م، ومرتفعات جبل احسان وجبل المزلقم في عدن الصغرى، وهي أقل ارتفاعاً من جبل شمسان، ولا تختلف مرتفعات عدن عن بقية مرتفعات اليمن من حيث التكوين، فهي ذات أصل بركاني، وبالرغم من احتلال المرتفعات الجبلية مساحات كبيرة من المدينة إلا أن تأثيرها ضعيف ومحدود في مناخ مدينة عدن.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ عدن حار نسبياً خلال أيام السنة، ويصل متوسط درجة الحرارة في عدن خلال أيام السنة بحدود 27 درجة مئوية، وتبلغ نسبة الرطوبة بين 62% - 73%.، هطول الأمطار في عدن بصورة عامة قليل وغالباً ما تكون الأمطار شتوية ربيعية وتندر في الصيف.\n\nالبيئة\nالسواحل\nمعظم سواحل محافظة عدن على امتداد الشريط الساحلي هي سواحل رملية، وتمتلك المحافظة شواطئ ساحلية ومنها الساحل الذهبي بمديرية التواهي وساحل أبين بخور مكسر وشاطئ الغدير وشاطئ كود النمر بالبريقة.\n\nالجزر البحرية\nهناك حوالي 21 جزيرة حول شبه جزيرتي عدن وعدن الصغرى ورأس عمران، وهي في الغالب جزر صخرية تحيط بجزء منها شعاب مرجانية غير مكتملة وأغلبها تعتبر مناطق اصطياد، عدد من الجزر قائم عليها أنشطة عديدة وخاصة في جزيرة العمال وجزيرة صيرة.\n\nالتنوع الحيواني البري والأليف\nتعتبر اليمن من الدول الغنية بأنواع الطيور في الشرق الأوسط نظرا لتوافر العديد من البيئات الساحلية المناسبة التي ساعدت على اجتذاب العديد من الطيور المهاجرة في مواقع الأراضي الرطبة والسواحل والجزر، وسجلت منطقة عدن (خور مكسر- الحسوة) ضمن قائمة المناطق الهامة لمنظمة الطيور العالمية باعتبارها موئلاً منتظماً لآخر ثلاثة أنواع مهددة بالانقراض عالمياً هي: عقاب سعفاء كبرى، نورسية وعقاب ملكي شرقي.\nهناك العشرات من أنواع الطيور سجلت في الأراضي الرطبة في عدن ومنطقة مستنقع (كالتكس)، الغنية بتنوع كبير من الطيور المستوطنة والمهاجرة، ومنها الطيور التي تتواجد على مدار السنة، ويتواجد في المنطقة العديد من الطيور منها، طيور النحام الكبير والنحام القزم، وبلشون الصخر، وأبو ملعقة، والخرشنة الخطافية وطائر النورس.\n\nالاقتصاد والنقل\nيتمثل النشاط الصناعي في عدن، من مجموعة المصانع والوحدات الإنتاجية وفي طليعتها مصفاة النفط حيث تعتبر مصفاة البترول في عدن من أوائل المصافي التي أنشئت في المنطقة، وبدء في تشغيلها عام 1954م، وتتبع شركة مصافي عدن مرافق مثل ميناء ناقلات النفط، وشبكة صهاريج التخزين، ومركز لتموين السفن بالوقود.\nتاريخياً، كانت عدن محطة لاستيراد السلع من الساحل الأفريقي ومن أوروبا، والولايات المتحدة، والهند. واعتبارا من عام 1920، كانت عدن مركز تجاري رئيسي للتجارة في شبه الجزيرة العربية، وكان الميناء يقوم بتصدير كميات صغيرة من المنتجات المحلية، إلى معظم الموانئ العربية، وكانت عدن توفر الفحم والملح للسفن العابرة، وكان الميناء محطة لتوقف السفن، عند دخولها باب المندب.\n\nالنقل\nتاريخياً كان ميناء عدن المرفأ الرئيسي للنقل في المنطقة، وتحط سفن الركاب في مديرية التواهي،  وتخدم المدينة بواسطة مطار عدن الدولي الذي يبعد حوالي 10 كيلومتر (6 ميل) عن المدينة، ويعد المطار المقر الرئيسي لشركة طيران السعيدة ومركز عملياتها، ويعتبر المطار ثاني أكبر مطار في اليمن بعد مطار صنعاء الدولي، ويعتبر أفضل مطارات اليمن من حيث الموقع وذلك بسبب طبيعة اليمن الجبلية، إلا أن هذا المطار يحيط به بحر العرب من جهة الإقلاع والهبوط، يرجع تاريخ إنشاء مطار عدن إلى عام 1927 عندما قامت القوات البريطانية بتأسيس مطار عسكري في مديرية خور مكسر، وبعد الحرب العالمية الثانية قامت بريطانيا بتحديث عمراني واسع وشيدت بجانب المطار العسكري مطار عدن الدولي المعروف حالياً.\nكان «طيران اليمدا» الناقل الرسمي لجنوب اليمن، قبل الوحدة، وكان مقرها عدن، قبل دمجها مع الخطوط الجوية اليمنية في 1996.\nخلال أوائل القرن ال20 كانت عدن مركزاً بارزاً لتصدير البن الذي يزرع في المرتفعات الجبيلة. وأيضاً لتصدير اللبان والقمح والشعير والبرسيم والدخن، التي تنتج وتصدر من عدن. وكانت أوراق وسيقان البرسيم والدخن والذرة التي تنتج في عدن تستخدم أعلاف بصفة عامة. واعتباراً من عام 1920 كانت عدن تقوم بتحلية ماء البحر لإنتاج ملح الطعام، وبين عامي 1916 - 1917، أنتجت عدن أكثر من 120,000 طن من الملح، وقد أنتجت عدن أيضا البوتاس، التي تم تصديرها إلى مومباي.\n\nالمنطقة الحرة\nتمثل المنطقة الحرة التي افتتحت في عام 1991، بوابة اليمن الاقتصادية ونقطة التقاء قارتي آسيا وأفريقيا، وتكتسب المنطقة الحرة أهميتها الاستراتيجية من الموقع الخاص لميناء عدن، كونه يقع مباشرة على الطريق التجاري الرئيسي حول العالم ومن الشرق الأوسط إلى أوروبا وأمريكا، ويتميز بإمكانية توفير خدمات الترانزيت إلى شرق أفريقيا والبحر الأحمر وشبه القارة الهندية والخليج العربي. وتمثل المنطقة الحرة منطقة تخزين وتوزيع مناسبة لأفريقيا والبحر الأحمر والخليج العربي.\n\nالمياه\nترجح دراسات أثرية حديثة، أن الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمة المعروفة حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابة 13,638,2757 لتر من الماء.\n\nأهم المؤشرات الرئيسية لمدينة عدن:\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nتقسم الجمهورية اليمنية إدارياً في إطار نظام السلطة المحلية إلى 21 محافظة ، بما فيها محافظة عدن، وتقسم العاصمة الاقتصادية عدن إلى ثمانية مديريات كالتالي:\n\nالمديريات\nالخدمات العامة\nالتعليم\nيوجد في عدن 95 مدرسة منها 13 روضة أطفال، و82 مدرسة للتعليم الأساسي منها 29 مدرسة للذكور و29 مدرسة للبنات و29 مدرسة مشتركة للبنين والبنات، كما يوجد 29 مدرسة ثانوية منها 15 مدرسة للذكور و14 مدرسة للبنات وجميعها بنظام الفترتين، وحتى عام 2004م بلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور في التعليم الأساسي 57,941 والإناث 48,081 وبمجموع 104,622 طالباً، أما في التعليم الثانوي فبلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور 11,029 طالباً، والإناث 9,643 طالبة.\nأما مراكز ومعاهد التعليم المهني والتقني والفني فيبلغ عددها 13 مراكز ويلتحق فيها 2214 طالب ويشمل 453 مدرس والمعاهد الصحية معهداً واحداً، يلتحق فيه 864 طالب ويشمل 147 مدرس حسب إحصائيات 2010. وبالنسبة للتعليم العالي توجد في عدن جامعة حكومية واحدة، وهي جامعة عدن فيها 9 كليات، ويلتحق فيها أكثر من 29 ألف طالب حسب إحصائيات 2010.\n\nالصحة\nيوجد في العاصمة الاقتصادية عدن 15 مستشفى، منها 5 مستشفيات عامة حكومية، و6 تابعة للقطاع الخاص، و37 مركز صحي، وتوجد في المدينة 34 منشأة تقدم خدمات الأمومة والطفولة، ويبلغ عدد القوى العاملة التخصصية في المنشآت الصحية 2,825 متخصص.\n\nمناطق موبوئة\nفي يونيو 2015 أعلن فريق الصليب الأحمر الدولي الموجود في مناطق الصراع في اليمن خلال أحداث الحرب الأهلية اليمنية أن مدن كريتر والمعلا وخور مكسر والتواهي بمحافظة عدن جنوبي البلاد مناطق موبوءة بمرض «حمى الضنك»، وقالت السلطات الصحية في عدن إن هذه الحمى انتشرت بشكل ملفت وواسع منذ مطلع شهر مايو بعد تدهور الخدمات الصحية وتضرر منشئات البنية التحتية من كهرباء ومياه وصرف صحي جراء القتال المستمر في المدينة منذ أشهر.\n\nالبريد\nعرفت عدن البريد منذ 15 يونيو 1839 أي بعد سنة من الاحتلال البريطاني، برغم أن مكتب البريد الرسمي لم يدشن إلا عام 1857، اُستخدم في عدن الطوابع البريدية لكل من بريطانيا والهند إلى أن صارت تسمى مستعمرة عدن في 1 أبريل 1937، برغم أن طوابع هذه المرحلة لم تحمل أي إشارة مميزة، لكن استخدام الرقم 124 كرمز بريدي ينسب لعدن كجزء من النظام العددي البريدي الهندي.\nثم عندما صارت مستعمرة عام 1937 أصبح لها مجموعات من الطوابع البريدية التي تحتوي على صور ويطبع اسم عدن (Aden) عليها، وفي العام 1939 أصدرت مجوعة بريدية جديدة تحتوي على صورة للملك جورج السادس، لكن سلاطين حضرموت -الذين كانوا تحت مظلة محمية عدن التي تسيطر عليها بريطانيا منذ ثمانينات القرن التاسع عشر- رفضوا ذلك ولهذا أصدرت بريطانيا مجوعة بريدية منفصلة في عام 1942، ولكن هذه المرة مع إدراج عبارة وصور تعبر عن السلطنة الكثيرية في سيؤن والسلطنة القعيطية في الشحر والمكلا إضافة لصوَر السلاطين.\n\nالإعلام\nالصحافة\nتأسست صحيفة العمل الأسبوعية في 1957 في عدن، كان شعارها (الحرية، الخبز، والسلام)، ولم تسمح السلطات البريطانية، سوى بطبع 1500 نسخة أسبوعيا، وتم حظر الصحيفة بعد فترة وجيزة.\nوفي 1958 أُسست صحيفة الأيام في عدن، كصحيفة يومية مستقلة باللغة العربية، إبان الاحتلال البريطاني، وصدر العدد الأول في 30 يوليو 1958 وكان مؤسسها ورئيس تحريرها العميد محمد علي باشراحيل، وتوقفت عن الصدور بعد الاستقلال في عهد جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية، من ثم عاودت الصدور بعد تحقيق الوحدة اليمنية، وكان أول عدد للصدور الثاني في 7 نوفمبر 1990 بعد توقف دام أكثر من 23 عام، وفي العام 1998 كانت «الأيام» الصحيفة الأولى في اليمن التي تقوم الحكومة بمقاضاتها بموجب قانون جزائي، وتبعت تلك القضية قضايا أخرى حتى غدت بنهاية العام 2008 متحملة 73% من إجمالي عدد القضايا التي رفعتها وزارة الإعلام والحكومة اليمنية ضد الصحافة في اليمن. وعندما اشتدت وطأة الاحتجاجات والمصادمات في عدن في أبريل 2009، «غطت الأيام الأحداث بشكل موسع، وكانت صوَر الدماء والإصابات تعلو غلاف الصحيفة لأيام»  وأرسل الرئيس علي عبد الله صالح وفود إلى الصحيفة، مطالباً إياهم بتخفيف وطأة تغطيتهم، والتوقف عن استخدام صور المصابين ونزيف الدماء. وفي 12 مايو 2009 شنت قوات الأمن هجوماً على مقر صحيفة الأيام في عدن.\n\nالإذاعة والتلفزيون\nتأسست إذاعة عدن في 17 أغسطس 1954 تحت اسم «محطة عدن للإذاعة». وتبث حالياً على فترتين صباحية ومسائية. افتتح الاحتلال البريطاني قناة عدن في 11 سبتمبر 1964، عقب قيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر 1963م، واقتصر الإرسال التلفزيوني على تغطية الأحياء الآهلة بالسكان في مدينة عدن، وبالذات حيث يتواجد جنود وعائلات القوات البريطانية، وفي يناير 1979 انتقل مقر التلفزيون إلى «مبنى الإذاعة والتلفزيون» بالتواهي الذي تم تجهيزه، وكان حينها البث باللونين الأبيض والأسود، وفي مارس 1981 بدأ الانتقال التدريجي إلى البث الملون، وفي يونيو 1981م بدأ بث القناة عبر الأقمار الصناعية. وبعد الوحدة اليمنية في 22 مايو 1990م، كانت قناة عدن هي القناة الثانية الرسمية للتلفزيون اليمني.\n\nالثقافة\nاللهجات\nساهم دخول اليمنيين في الإسلام إلى هجرهم قلمهم القديم واستبداله بالأبجدية النبطية المتأخرة التي دون بها القرآن  يتحدث اليمنيون اليوم العربية باللهجة اليمنية وهي لهجة متطورة ومرتبطة ارتباطا وثيقا باللغة القديمة،  وهي ثلاث لهجات بتفرعات لهجة صنعانية ولهجة حضرمية ولهجة تعزية-عدنية، بالإضافة للهجة بدوية لسكان مأرب والجوف وشبوة وبادية حضرموت، ولكل من هذه اللهجات خصائص ومميزات.\n\nالموسيقى والشعر\nالفن العدني أو العدنيات هو فن من فنون الموسيقى العربية، ومن فنانو عدن القدامى إسكندر ثابت صالح ومحمد مرشد ناجي ومن الشعراء عبد الرحمن إبراهيم محمد وأحمد غالب محمد الجابري وعبد الله عبد الكريم محمد وعلي عبد الله جعفر أمان وفريد محمد بركات ولطفي جعفر أمان ومحسن علي بريك.\nلعبت «المزيكة العدنية» دوراً كبيراً في المجتمع العدني، وكان يطلق على الفنانين في اللهجة العدنية «المَطاربه» أي أهل الطرب، بدأت المزيكة العدنية في 1920 حين تشكل جيش محمية عدن، وبعده الحرس الوطني، حيث كانت هناك فرق لتلك القوات وكانت تلك الفرق تشارك في المناسبات وفي حفلات الزواج.\n\nالرياضة\nقبل الاستقلال\nتعود البداية الأولى للرياضة العدنية إلى عام 1902م، عندما تم تأسيس نادي للتنس العدني، ومقره في حي القطيع بكريتر، وأسس يوسف محمد خان «نادي الترفيه المتحد» (بالإنجليزية: Recreational Club United) في مدينة كريتر، وكان يعرف بملعب يوسف خان. وتعتبر مدينة عدن أول مدينة مُورِسَتْ الرياضة فيها في الجزيرة العربية، وتأسس في 1905 أول نادي أهلي في عدن تحت مسمى «نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي»، كأول نادي رياضي في اليمن والعالم العربي. وكان ينازل فرق جيش الاحتلال وفرق الاساطيل القادمة والمارة إلى ميناء عدن.\nوفي عام 1924 تأسس في كريتر «نادي الحسيني الرياضي»، كما ظهر نادي ثالث في التواهي باسم «نادي البامبوت»، والشيخ عثمان. وشهدت فترة الثلاثينيات ظهور عدد من الأندية ففي عام 1933م ظهر «نادي نجوم الليل» والعيدروسي ونجوم الصباح في كريتر، وفي التواهي ظهر «نادي الاتحاد الإسلامي» (الموالده).\nوكانت مباريات كرة القدم حتى ذلك العام تمارس بشكل ودي بين فرق المناطق كريتر، التواهي، الشيخ عثمان، حيث لم يكن وجود لاتحادات تنظم النشاط الرياضي. وفي عام 1934م أعلنت سلطة الاحتلال عن تأسيس جمعية رياضية أطلق عليها «الجمعية الرياضية العدنية»، وذلك بعد تزايد أعداد النوادي المحلية، وقد تم تعيين أعضائها من قبل الحاكم العام لعدن، وكان جميع أعضائها من الإنجليز، برئاسة حاكم عدن الإنجليزي «برنارد رايلي» كراعي للجمعية، ويتكون مجلس الإدارة من «هيكم بوتم» رئيساً، والهندي «روزاريو» سكرتيراً، وعضوية اثنين آخرين.\nوبدأت هذه الجمعية في إقامة أول بطولة للأندية وهي «بطولة كأس روزاريو»، شاركت في البطولة 6 أندية، ثلاثة من كريتر (الاتحاد المحمدي، الحسيني، نجوم الليل)، ومن التواهي (الموالده، والباميوت)، ومن الشيخ عثمان نادي الشيخ عثمان، ويضم لاعبين من مختلف الفرق الصغيرة في منظقة الشيخ عثمان، وقد أحرز هذه البطولة نادي الاتحاد المحمدي.\nومن أهم البطولات المقامة في عدن قبل الاستقلال، كأس روزاريو، وكأس رايلي، وكأس باسم باصفة النار الصومالية، وكأس أرامكو، وبطولة كيك منشرجي.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nبعد الاستقلال تأسس «اتحاد كرة القدم» في 18 يناير 1968م على انقاض «الجمعية الرياضية العدنية»، واتخذ الاتحاد قراراً بخصوص الأندية العدنية التي كانت قد بلغ عددها حوالي 64 نادي رياضي، قضى بتقليص ودمج الأندية في عدن ولحج إلى 16 نادي فقط، واضطرت الأندية للانضمام للفرق الكبيرة أو التوحد معها. وفي فبراير 1968م، ألغيت عدة نواد رياضية وبقي 12 نادي فقط، وفي ديسمبر 1968م، تم دمج نادي الإصلاح ونادي الشعب، في نادي واحد باسم الأخير في التواهي، وفي 1969م توحد في كريتر نادي الاتحاد المحمدي ونادي التضامن، تحت اسم نادي التضامن المحمدي.\nوفي «المؤتمر الرياضي العام الأول» في 1973م دمجت الأندية وقلصت مرة أخرى، ليصبح عددها 7 أندية فقط: هي نادي الأحرار، نادي الأهلي، نادي شمسان، نادي الشعب، نادي الهلال، نادي الشبيبة المتحدة، نادي التنس العدني. في 18 يوليو 1975م، كانت مرحلة تشكيل أندية المدن، وبداية مرحلة تسييس الأندية لصالح الجبهة القومية للتحرير، وقُرر تغيير أسمائها وتقليصها لتصبح 5 أندية هي نادي التلال وشمسان والميناء ونادي الوحدة ونادي الشعلة.\nفي 18 يوليو 1975 ظهر «نادي التلال الرياضي» برئاسة ياسين سعيد نعمان، كاسم جديد ل«نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي» الذي تأسس في 1905م، وفي 1976 م ظهر «الاتحاد اليمني لكرة القدم». وشارك نادي التلال في «مسابقة كأس 26 سبتمبر» في 1980، كأول مسابقة كروية يشارك فيها مع منتخبات من شمال اليمن وجنوبه، كمنتخب محافظة إب ومحافظة تعز ومحافظة حضرموت ولحج والحديدة، وذلك في ملعب الشهيد الظرافي بصنعاء، وتوج الهلال بطلاً لكأس 26 سبتمبر، بعد فوزه على منتخب الحديدة بخمسة أهداف نظيفة.\nكرة القدم هي الرياضة الأكبر شعبية في عدن، يوجد في عدن 9 ملاعب منها استاد 22 مايو الدولي، و10 أندية رياضية،  وفي نوفمبر 2010 استضافت عدن كأس الخليج العربي لكرة القدم 2010.\n\nالسياحة\nلا زالت الكثير من مواقع الجذب السياحي غير مطورة وتنقصها الخدمات جراء الحروب والاقتتال الدائم الذي يعاني منه اليمن فاليمن يمتلك أربعة مواقع ضمن مواقع التراث العالمي هي سقطرى وصنعاء القديمة وشبام ومدينة زبيد القديمة ورغم ارتفاع عدد السياح إلى 176.98% في اليمن ما بين 2004 -2003 إلا أن الحكومة لم تبدي اهتماما بالقطاع السياحي وارتفع معدل إقامة السياح من 7 أيام إلى 16 يوم وكلها مؤشرات إلى إمكانية تطوير القطاع السياحي في البلاد وأشارت بعض الدراسات أن تنمية قطاع السياحة في اليمن كفيل بإخراجه من دائرة البلدان الأقل نماء يأتي أغلب السياح إلى اليمن لزيارة سقطرى والآثار القديمة والتعرف على ثقافة الشعب اليماني وفنونه الشعبية والمهتمين بدراسة الثقافة العربية التي لم تتأثر بمؤثرات خارجية وذلك النتاج العزلة التي فُرضت على اليمن لعقود طويلة وأشارت وزارة السياحية اليمنية إلى ذلك في تقريرها الأخير بشأن التنمية السياحية بأن الخدمات السياحية متواضعة في اليمن وتنعدم تماما في القرى الصغيرة التي تلقى إقبالا سياحيا.\n\nمعالم ومواقع أثرية وسياحية\nالمتاحف\nالمتحف الوطني: للآثار، يقع في مدينة كريتر، ويطل على البحر المواجه لقلعة صيرة، بني في عهد السلطان فضل بن علي العبدلي خلال الفترة 1912م - 1918م، ويوجد به مجموعة من الآثار الحجرية (تعود إلى العصر الحجري) والعصر البرونزي، وكذلك مجموعة من القطع الحجرية المكتوبة بأنواع مختلفة من الخط اليمني القديم. وتماثيل وحلي وزخارف تعود إلى مملكة سبأ ومملكة حمير وقتبان وأوسان، وآثار إسلامية.\nالمتحف الحربي: يقع في شارع المتحف بمدينة كريتر، يعود تاريخه إلى العام 1918م حيث كان مدرسة للتعليم الابتدائي (بالإنجليزية: Residency School) وبعد الاستقلال عن بريطانيا، وفي 1971، جرى تحويله إلى متحف مخصص للتراث العسكري اليمني، بقرار من الرئيس سالم ربيع علي آنذاك، وكان يتألف من 7 صالات، وبعد الوحدة اليمنية جرت عملية ترميم له وافتتح مرة أخرى في 2001م وقسم إلى أربعة أجنحة، كل جناح ضم عدة قاعات، جرت عملية إعادة تأهيل لهذا المتحف في 2007م. وصل عدد زوار المتحف خلال العام 2007 إلى 2008 حوالي 17,000 زائر يمني ومائتي سائح أجنبي. كما ارتفع هذا العدد إلى حوالي 27,800 سائح في 2009.\n\nصور من عدن\nالتوأمة\nملاحظات\n\n\n== المراجع ==",
      "summary": "عَدَن هي مدينة يمنية تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمة الاقتصادية لليمن، وثاني أهم مدينة يمنية بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن أحداثاً تاريخية هامة، وعرفت بأنها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمة حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمة، مما يجعلها واحدة من أكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظة عدن ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر أهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الأحمر، وتشكل عدن أنموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الإنتاجي، إذ جمعت بين الأنشطة الصناعية والسمكية والتجارية والسياحية والخدمية، وتنبع أهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من أهم الموانئ في المنطقة، ومنطقة تجارة حرة إقليمية ودولية. تكتسب المدينة أهميتها السياحية من شواطئها الدافئة ومنتجعاتها الجميلة، وتكتسب الصناعة مقوماتها من مجموعة مصانع ووحدات إنتاجية أهمها «مصفاة عدن». تتكون عدن من عدة مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصورة، دار سعد، البريقة.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كأحد المدن ذات العلاقة التجارية مع صور اللبنانية كون عدن كانت أحد المحطات المهمة لتجارة التوابل التي انتعشت لمدة ألفية كاملة. كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. وكانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة،  وشن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون إسقاط مملكة سبأ عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الإمبراطورية الساسانية على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الإسلام إلى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الإسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226، إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدولة الطاهرية وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياماً عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخاء اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينة عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. وخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، أصبحت عدن أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963،  أعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز. وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير بقيادة قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الإنجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية برئاسة قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمة للدولة.\nقامت الحركة التصحيحية باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وأدخلت العامل الأيديولوجي الماركسي في جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية وغيّرت اسمها إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وبدأوا بتأميم قطاعات واسعة من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القادة الشباب الجدد أول خطة خمسية لجميع المحافظات الجنوبية. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي أدت لاندلاع الحرب الأهلية في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينة عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحدة اليمنية واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد أربعة سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكومية السيطرة على المدينة، أعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمة. وظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  التي أعلن الرئيس هادي أنها عاصمة مؤقتة لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. إلا أن هذا القرار لم يكن سوى إعلانًا رمزيًا حيث أن تغيير العاصمة في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على أن الأخيرة لا تزال هي العاصمة.",

      "content": "Aden (ɑːdɛn/ah-den, arabe : عدن ʿAdan) est une ville du Yémen, située à 170 km à l'est du détroit Bab el Mandeb. Elle est peuplée d'environ 990 000 habitants. C'est aussi un port naturel, construit sur un ancien site volcanique, déjà utilisé par le royaume antique d'Awsan entre les VIIe et Ve siècles av. J.-C.. La ville donne son nom au golfe d'Aden.\n\nÉtymologie\nAyant la même étymologie qu'Éden, Aden vient de l'akkadien edinnu, qui signifie « plaine ».\n\nGéographie\nAden est composée de plusieurs petites villes : \n\nCratère, la ville portuaire d'origine,\nLittle Aden, la ville industrielle, avec raffinerie de pétrole,\nMu'alla (en), le port moderne,\nTawahi (en), connu comme Steamer Point à l'époque coloniale,\nles stations de repos de Gold Mohur,\nKhormaksar (en), située sur l'isthme qui relie Aden au continent, avec notamment les missions diplomatiques de la ville, les bureaux principaux de l'université d'Aden et l'aéroport international de Khormaksar, ancienne base aérienne britannique et deuxième plus grand aéroport du Yémen.\nSur le continent se situent les sous-centres de Cheikh Othman (en), zone de l'ancien port, Al-Mansoura (en), ville planifiée par les Britanniques, et Madinat ash-Chaab (anciennement Madinat al-Itihad), le site désigné comme la capitale de la South Arabian Federation, où se situent une installation de dessalement de l'eau de mer et des facultés de l'Université d'Aden.\nLa capitale de la brève république démocratique populaire du Yémen, jusqu'à l'unification du Yémen du Nord et du Sud, a été déclarée zone de libre échange.\n\nHistoire\nHistoire antique\nLa position stratégique du port, entre l'Inde et l'Europe en fait dès l'Antiquité un lieu d'échanges commerciaux importants, notamment mentionné dans Le Périple de la mer Érythrée, sous son ancien nom de Porto. Le village sur le bord de mer est encore peu développé, sans fortification, une île plus qu'une péninsule.\nLes civilisations préislamiques, les royaumes himyarite ou sabéen ont pu y construire des tours de guet, mais il ne reste trace d'aucune fortification.\nElle peut et doit être l'antique Eudaemon (Heureuse).\n\nMoyen Âge\nLes historiens arabes Ibn al Mojawir et Abou Makhramah attribuent la première fortification d'Aden à Beni Zuree'a, et Muhammad Sultan Azim Qamarbandi Naqsh, Tarikh ul-Yémen. L'objectif semble avoir été double : empêcher l'accès de forces hostiles, maintenir les revenus en contrôlant la circulation des marchandises et en empêchant la contrebande. La forme originale paraît relativement faible. Après 1175, la reconstruction est plus solide et la ville populaire attire marins et marchands d'Égypte, de Sind, d'Afrique et même de Chine.\nZheng He, dans son expédition de 1413-1415, visite la région.\nEn 1421, l'empereur chinois Zhu Di, de la dynastie Ming, envoie deux grands émissaires, le grand eunuque Li Xing et le grand eunuque et amiral Zhou Man de Zheng He chargé de transmettre un édit impérial, avec don de chapeaux et de robes, au roi d'Aden. Les envoyés, à bord de trois navires chargés de trésors, partent de Sumatra pour Aden. Cet événement est enregistré dans le livreYing-yai Sheng-lan par Ma Huan, qui accompagne l'envoyé impérial. [réf. à confirmer] .\nAden est occupée par les Portugais entre 1513-1538 et 1547-1548. Elle est gouvernée par l'Empire ottoman entre 1538-1547 et 1548-1645[Passage contradictoire]. Après la domination ottomane, elle est gouvernée par le sultanat de Lahij, sous des imams Zaidi du Yémen[Qui ?].\nEntre 1538 et 1630[Passage contradictoire], Aden est sous souveraineté ottomane.\nLa ville, cédée par le sultan Muhsin bin Fadi, intègre l'Empire colonial britannique en 1838 pour y occuper une position centrale entre le canal de Suez, Zanzibar et Bombay jusqu'à l'indépendance de la république populaire du Yémen du Sud.\n\nDomination britannique 1838-1963\nAden, à cette époque, est encore un petit village avec une population de 600 Arabes, des Somaliens, des Juifs et des Indiens - logés pour la plupart dans des huttes de roseaux ou sur des nattes au milieu des ruines, rappelant une époque disparue de richesse et de prospérité. Haines estime qu'il peut devenir un grand centre commercial et cette prévision fut avérée : la période britannique en a fait un des ports les plus achalandés au monde.\nEn 1838, le Sultan Muhsin bin Fadl de l'état voisin de Lahej cède 194 km2 (75 miles carrés), dont Aden, à l'Empire britannique. Le 19 janvier 1839, le British East India Company débarque les Royal Marines à Aden, pour occuper le territoire et arrêter les attaques de pirates contre l'expédition britannique en Inde. Le port se trouve à peu près à égale distance du Canal de Suez, de Bombay et de Zanzibar, toutes régions alors sous influence britannique.\nAden a été un entrepôt et une étape pour les marins dans le monde antique, permettant de reconstituer les vivres et l'eau. Au milieu du XIXe siècle, il devient nécessaire de fournir également le charbon et l'eau des chaudières à vapeur. Aden offre alors une station de charbon à Steamer-Point.\nLa population croît : 6 000 en 1839, 15 000 en 1842, 17 000 en 1856, 19 289 en 1872, 34 860 en 1889 (et 35 932 en incluant la garnison de Périm).\nSa situation géographique est utilisée pour la contrebande d'armes, activité répandue dans le golfe d'Aden et en Somalie et contre laquelle le gouvernement britannique s'engage en 1909 aux côtés de la France et de l'Italie.\nJusqu'en 1937, l'établissement d'Aden est géré comme une partie du Raj britannique. Son territoire d'origine est agrandi en 1857 de 13 km2 avec l'île de Périm, en 1868 de 73 km2  avec l'archipel des Khuriya Muriya et en 1915 de 108 km2 avec l'île de Kamaran.\nEn 1937, son statut est modifié, l'établissement est détaché administrativement de l'Inde et devient la colonie d'Aden, une Crown colony britannique. Le changement de gouvernement entraîne le changement des unités monétaires, les roupies deviennent des shillings de l'Afrique de l'Est. L'arrière-pays d'Aden et l'Hadramaout sont également moins liés à la Grande-Bretagne, puisque le Protectorat d'Aden est supervisé à partir d'Aden même.\nEn décembre 1947 se déroule le Pogrom d'Aden contre les juifs de la ville. 82 juifs sont assassinés, des écoles incendiées et plus de 100 magasins pillés lors de ces émeutes antisémites. L'origine des violences s'explique par une grève générale de trois jours et une manifestation des habitants afin de contester le vote de l'Organisation des Nations unies sur le plan de partage de la Palestine.\nAprès la nationalisation par l'Egypte du canal de Suez en 1956, Aden devient la base principale de la région pour les Britanniques.\nAden envoie une équipe aux Jeux de l'Empire britannique et du Commonwealth de 1962 à Perth en Australie.\n\nLittle Aden : 1955-1967\nLittle Aden est toujours dominé par la raffinerie de pétrole, construite pour British Petroleum. Little Aden était bien connu des marins pour son port pétrolier, avec une mission d'accueil, près de la BP d'Aden, avec piscine et bar climatisé. Les zones d'hébergement pour le personnel de la raffinerie sont connus sous les noms d'origine arabe de Bureika et Ghadir.\nBureika consiste surtout en dortoirs, des logements en bois construits pour accueillir les milliers d'hommes qualifiés et des ouvriers importés pour construire la raffinerie, plus tard convertis en logements familiaux.\nGhadir housing est construit en pierre, en grande partie des carrières locales de granite. Beaucoup de ces logements sont encore debout et occupés par les plus riches habitants de Big Aden.\nLittle Aden comporte également de nombreux villages pittoresques de pêcheurs, comme Ghadir et ses casiers à homards.\n\nAvant l'indépendance : 1963-1967\nPour stabiliser Aden et le Protectorat d'Aden et les protéger des intentions égyptiennes, soutenues par le Yémen du nord, les Britanniques tentent d'unir progressivement les États disparates de la région en préparation de l'indépendance.\nLe 18 janvier 1963, la colonie d'Aden est incorporée dans la Fédération des émirats arabes du Sud contre la volonté du Yémen du nord, qui revendique la ville et le sud du Yémen. La population de la ville, l'État d'Aden, et la Fédération sont rebaptisés Fédération d'Arabie du Sud (Federation of South Arabia : FSA).\nUne insurrection contre la domination britannique, Aden Emergency, commence par une attaque à la grenade par le Front de libération nationale (FLN), communiste, contre le Haut Commissaire britannique, le 10 décembre 1963, tuant une personne et en blessant cinquante. L'état d'urgence est instauré.\nEn 1964, la Grande-Bretagne annonce son intention d'accorder l'indépendance à la FSA en 1968, l'armée britannique restant à Aden. La situation sécuritaire se détériore : FLN et FLOSY (Front pour la Libération du Sud Yémen Occupé) rivalisent.\nEn janvier 1967, des émeutes de masse ont lieu entre FLN et FLOSY, dans le vieux quartier arabe d'Aden-ville, jusqu'à la mi-février, malgré l'intervention des troupes britanniques. Durant cette période, ont lieu autant d'attaques contre les troupes britanniques par les deux parties qu'entre elles.\nLe 22 novembre 1966 une bombe avait fait exploser en vol un Douglas DC-3 de la compagnie Aden Airways (en). Il n'y eut aucun survivant parmi les 30 passagers et membres de l'équipage. Le 30 juin 1967 un second avion Vickers Viscount en réparation sur l'aéroport international d'Aden, est détruit au sol sans faire de victime.\nLe 30 novembre 1967, les Britanniques se retirent finalement, laissant Aden et le reste de la FSA sous le contrôle du FLN. Les Royal Marines, les premières troupes britanniques à s'installer à Aden en 1839, sont les dernières à partir, à l'exception d'un détachement des Royal Engineers.\n\nIndépendance : 1967-1975\nAden devient la capitale de la nouvelle république populaire du Yémen du Sud, rebaptisée république démocratique populaire du Yémen en 1970. Avec l'unification du nord et du sud du Yémen en 1990, Aden n'est plus capitale nationale, mais reste la capitale du gouvernorat d'Aden, qui couvre une superficie semblable à celle de la colonie d'Aden.\n\nHistoire récente\nPendant le détournement d'avion du Vol 181 Lufthansa, commencé le 13 octobre 1977, Aden est l'avant-dernier arrêt prévu des pirates de l'air. Le gouvernement refuse toute interaction avec les ravisseurs et la piste est bloquée. N'ayant de carburant que pour vingt minutes, le pilote est forcé d'atterrir à côté de la piste dans le sable.\nLe 29 décembre 1992, Al-Qaïda mène sa première attaque terroriste connue à Aden, le bombardement de l'Hôtel Gold Mohur (/ ˌ ɡoʊld mɔər /), où les militaires américains sont réputés séjourner sur la route de la Somalie pour l'opération Restore Hope. Un Yéménite et un touriste autrichien meurent dans l'attaque.\nAden est brièvement au centre de la république démocratique du Yémen sécessioniste, du 21 mai au 7 juillet 1994.\nLe 3 janvier 2000, des membres d'Al-Qaïda tentent d'attaquer un destroyer américain lance-missiles de classe Arleigh Burke The Sullivans (DDG-68), dans le cadre de l'attaque du millénaire. Mais le bateau transportant les explosifs, surchargé, coule avant d'approcher sa cible.\nLe 12 octobre 2000, Al-Qaïda réitère le même type d'attaque contre un autre destroyer, l'USS Cole, qui fait relâche dans le port d'Aden. Cette fois, la petite embarcation chargée d'explosifs saute à la hauteur de la salle des machines, fait un trou d'environ 10 m2 dans la coque, et cause la mort de dix-sept marins et en blesse cinquante autres. Les deux terroristes périssent aussi dans l'attentat-suicide.\nEn février 2015, lors de la guerre civile et la fuite du président Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi en direction de cette même ville, Aden devient capitale de facto.\nElle est aussi le théâtre de la bataille d'Aden de mars à juillet 2015.\nLe 6 décembre 2015, Jaafar Mohammed Saad, gouverneur d'Aden depuis le 9 octobre précédent, est tué dans un attentat à la voiture piégée revendiqué par Daech, qui cherche à asseoir son emprise sur le pays dans un contexte de guerre civile entre Houthis et loyalistes.\nLe 9 décembre 2015, des hommes armés font exploser une église qui date de l’époque britannique. Début 2016, des terroristes s'en prennent à l'église de la Sainte-Famille d'Aden. Quatre religieuses missionnaires de la Charité et douze personnes sont assassinées dans une attaque le 4 mars 2016.\nLe 6 mai 2016, l'aéroport de la ville rouvre.\nLe 4 septembre 2016, la raffinerie d'Aden est rouverte, un an après la fin de la bataille, permettant ainsi de mettre fin à la pénurie d'électricité.\nLe 19 septembre 2016, le siège de la Banque centrale est déplacé à Aden.\nEn août 2019, l'ONU fait état de nombreuses exactions commises à Aden par des miliciens formés et équipés par les Émirats arabes unis contre des Yéménites originaires du nord du pays : « Nous avons reçu de multiples sources des informations sur des arrestations, des détentions arbitraires, des déplacements forcés, des agressions physiques et des harcèlements, ainsi que sur des pillages et des actes de vandalisme commis par les forces de sécurité contre des centaines d'habitants [originaires] du Nord ».\n\nÉconomie\nAden possède un aéroport international : l'aéroport international d'Aden.\nVia Aden Cement Enterprises Ltd., le suisse Holcim possède une cimenterie dans la ville, employant 81 personnes.\nLa gestion du port est concédée depuis le 1er novembre 2008 à DP World Aden, coentreprise entre Dubai Ports World et Yemen Gulf of Aden Port Corporation, avec pour mission de gérer et développer le terminal de conteneurs.\nIl y a deux établissements quatre étoiles : les hôtels Mercure et Gold Mohur Hotel & Resort.\n\nTawahi\nTawahi (arabe : التواهي) est un quartier d'Aden. Pendant la période coloniale britannique, ce district s'est développé. Le quartier comprend également le « Steamer Point », un port colonial pour navires à passagers et navires-citernes. Aujourd'hui encore, les hôtels les plus touristiques y sont concentrés.\n\nKrater\nCratère, ou Kraytar, (arabe : كريتر), est le nom officieux d'un cratère de volcan éteint situé dans ce quartier d'Aden. Son nom officiel est Seera, le district de Sirah, (arabe : صيرة). Cette partie de la ville abrite environ 70 000 habitants.\n\nTransports\nLa ville est desservie par l'aéroport d'Aden, à 9,5 kilomètres du centre.\n\nCulture\nDu fait de sa longue période de colonisation Britannique, Aden est la ville et métropole la plus Anglophone de la péninsule Arabique. En 1985, 15 % de la population de la ville d'Aden parlait Anglais en seconde langue.\n\nAden en littérature\nArthur Rimbaud y a séjourné à partir de 1880 après son départ de France. La ville sert également de cadre aux romans des écrivains français Paul Nizan avec Aden Arabie, publié en 1931, Pierre Benoit avec Les Environs d'Aden, publié en 1940 et Henry de Monfreid qui évoque la ville à de nombreuses reprises dans ses récits.\n\nLégendes\nL'occupation humaine y remonterait au déluge.

      "content": "## Overview\nAden (Arabic: عَدَنْ ʿAdan) is a city in the Yemeni Coastal Plains, on the Gulf of Aden at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n\n## Understand\nIt was a major port on the Maritime Silk Road. Marco Polo described it as a hub of commerce, where goods arriving by ship from the East were transferred to smaller boats for the trip up the Red Sea and on to Alexandria and Christendom.\nAt one point it ruled a small empire, the part of Africa just across from it.\nIn the 19th century, it became a British protectorate.\nIt was the capital of South Yemen until Yemen was re-united in 1990.\nIt is a very picturesque city with a mix of traditional Arabic and British influences. It was the capital of the liberal South, but it has been changing due to the take-over of the tribal forces of the North. For instance the Soviets banned head scarves for women and for decades, women were relatively emancipated and could carry out university degrees abundantly. Now, the scarves are back on the street. There is also a sizeable Somali minority (war refugees).\n\n## Climate\nThe city swelters through a desert climate all year round, with high temperatures and little to no rain.\n\n## Get in\nAccess to Aden is available by car, airplane and bus. Airfare from Sana'a on Yemenia, the national carrier, is around 10,000 rials or US$55. Buses are generally comfortable and the journey from Sana'a to Aden takes about 8 hours. A ticket costs ~1500 rials. Be prepared to show a travel permit (Tashrih) on military checkpoints. You can't leave capital Sanaa without it. It's good idea to have also few photocopies of your passport ready. If you travel to Aden or elsewhere in Yemen by plane, no travel permit is required.\nThere are direct flights to many cities in the Middle East. If you are flying in from outside the region, it will be necessary to transfer in Egypt, Jordan or the United Arab Emirates.\n12.825345.03661 Aden International Airport (ADE  IATA).      (updated Jan 2023)\n\n## Get around\nprivate taxi\ncollective taxi (\"mer mer\") - costing 40 rials from Tawahi to Crater or Sirah for instance (ask for colour codes if you speak Arabic), cheap and easy to use along common routes\nby foot - for any climbing and to complement many collective taxi trips.\nTaxis are practical, yet always bargain with the taxi driver before getting in. Otherwise, they have the tendency to get it done at their high price. If you know the city very well, you can use the mini-buses along with the public. The mini-buses are easy to use; they follow an essentially circular path around the city. Find someone familiar with the area to explain their route as the fare for the buses is around 30 rials, or roughly a tenth of the average taxi ride.  There are also many boats that will take you whenever on a little cruise on the sea.\nAden International Airport is accessible, yet if you are in Yemen it is better to drive there. You can also rent cars from international companies.\n\n## See\nSunsets, lagoons (for bird-watching), the Aden museum, Crater (including a shopping district), people, beach and reservoirs.\n\n## Tawahi (Steamer Point)\n12.78333344.9833331 Big Ben Aden (بيغ بن عدن).

This causes cancer in the long-run, and also stains teeth and gums red. Tobacco version is very strong and spitting regularly is highly recommended. The sweet version is particularly tasty and doesn't induce the same urge to spit.\nchewing qat - the national past-time. This also causes cancer in the long-run; first-time use generally induces restlessness, insomnia and general mouth fatigue and aches\nclimbing on the mountain tops for great views of the city (beware of the no trespassing zone and take abundant water and sun screening equipment)\nbeach activities.\nAden is especially known for the beautiful beaches and swimming activities. Besides this, Aden has the only considerable nightlife in Yemen, and foreigners can enjoy wonderful Arabian nights.\nSport fishing: tunas and sharks can be hunted near the coast.\nA visit at the Gold Mohur Beach and Elephant Bay Hotel is a must. For women travelling alone, there is also a women-only beach at the Sheraton Hotel.  Excellent snorkeling is available although not as clear as Sharm El-Sheikh.\n\n## Buy\nBeautiful scarfs can be purchased in Crater as well as an abaya for the ladies. Spices can also be found in abundance.

Aden is known for its belly dancing events by overseas dancers (e.g. Iraqis and Syrians), which you can find in many tourist places, including Sheraton Aden, Diplomacy Resort, Bahara, Nashwan, and Hotel Aden.\nFruit juice bars offer very nice, cheap and wholesome drinks.\n\n## Sleep\nAden is the tourist and economic capital of Yemen. You have many chances to purchase alcohol, go to clubs and enjoy a sunset in the high-class hotels. There are many 5-star hotels and numerous others.\n\n## Budget\nThere are many budget, decent and clean hotels and resorts such as:\n12.7715644.988631 Elephant Bay.",
