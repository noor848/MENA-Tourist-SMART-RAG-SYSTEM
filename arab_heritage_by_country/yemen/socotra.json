      "content": "Socotra, locally known as Saqatri, is a Yemeni island in the Indian Ocean. Situated between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea near major shipping routes. The largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago, it comprises around 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies 380 kilometres (205 nautical miles) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 232 km (125 nmi) east of the Horn of Africa. The inhabitants of the island are called Socotrans, and they speak Arabic and Soqotri. \nSocotra is home to a high number of unique species that are endemic. Up to a third of its plant life is unique. Due to the island's unusual geography, it has been described as \"the most alien-looking place on Earth\". The island measures 132 km (82 mi) in length and 42 km (26 mi) across at its widest. In 2008, Socotra was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe island is under the control of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), \"secessionist\" faction in Yemen's ongoing civil war. The STC seized control of the island following a coup in 2020, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own governance.\n\nEtymology\nScholars' views vary regarding the origin of the island's name. One theory is that the term Socotra may derive from a Greek name that is derived from the name of a South Arabian tribe mentioned in Sabaic and Ḥaḍraumitic inscriptions as Dhū-Śakūrid (s³krd). Another theory is that the Arabic term Suqutra broken down as follows: Suq, means market, and qutra is a vulgar form of qatir, which refers to dragon's blood. The capital city of Socotra was Suq as reported by the Portuguese in the 16th century, which they referred to as market place.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThere was initially an Oldowan lithic culture in Socotra. Oldowan stone tools were found in the area around Hadibo in 2008. Socotra played an important role in the ancient international trade and appears as Dioskouridou (Διοσκουρίδου νῆσος), meaning \"the island of  Dioscurides\" in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a first-century AD Greek navigation aid.\nThe Hoq Cave contains a large number of inscriptions, drawings and archaeological objects. Further investigation showed that these had been left by sailors who visited the island between the first century BC and the sixth century AD. The texts are written in the Indian Brāhmī, South Arabian, Ethiopic, Greek, Palmyrene and Bactrian languages. This corpus of nearly 250 texts and drawings constitutes one of the main sources for the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in that time period.\n\nAntiquity\nIn 880, an Aksumite expeditionary force conquered the island, and an Oriental Orthodox bishop was consecrated. The Ethiopians were later dislodged by a large armada sent by Imam Al-Salt bin Malik of Oman. According to the Persian geographer Ibn al-Mujawir, who testifies having arrived in Socotra from India in 1222, there were two groups of people on the island, the indigenous mountain dwellers and the foreign coastal dwellers. There were large settlements of Indian traders from Sindh and Balochistan.\nIbn Hawqal, a 10th-century history chronicler, mentions Socotra in his book The Renaissance of Islam. He mentioned it as a prominent source of piracy, stating:  \"the island Socotra in particular was regarded as a dangerous nest of pirates, at which people trembled as they passed it. It was the point d'appui of the Indian pirates who ambushed the Believers there.\"\n\nMiddle ages\nIn 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed at Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle against the Mahra Sultanate. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to India. The lack of a proper harbor and the infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison, and the Portuguese abandoned the island in 1511. The Mahra sultans took back control of the island, and the inhabitants were converted to Islam.\n\nModern\nIn 1834, the East India Company stationed a garrison on Socotra, in the expectation that the Mahra sultan of Qishn and Socotra would accept an offer to sell the island. The lack of good anchorages proved to be as much a problem for the British as the Portuguese. The sultan refused to sell, and the British left in 1835. After the capture of Aden by the British in 1839, they lost interest in acquiring Socotra. In 1886, the British government decided to conclude a protectorate treaty with the sultan in which he promised this time to \"refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government\". In October 1967, in the wake of the departure of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate was abolished. \nOn 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of South Yemen. Between 1976 and 1979, the island served as a base for the Soviet Navy. Although the South Yemeni government and president, Ali Nasir Muhammad, had denied their existence. Slavery in the island was abolished under the rule of the Yemeni Socialist Party.\nSince Yemeni unification in 1990, Socotra has been a part of the Republic of Yemen, affiliated first to Aden Governorate. Then in 2004, it was moved to be a part of the Hadhramaut Governorate. Later in 2013, it became a governorate of its own.\nSocotra was impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which damaged 40 fishing boats, even though the island was 4,600 km (2,858 mi) away from the tsunami epicentre off the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia. In 2015, the cyclones Chapala and Megh struck the island, causing severe damage to its infrastructure.\nBeginning in 2015, the UAE began increasing its presence on Socotra, first with humanitarian aid in the wake of tropical cyclones Chapala and Megh, and eventually establishing a military presence on the island. On 30 April 2018, the UAE, as part of the ongoing Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen, landed troops on the island and took control of Socotra Airport and seaport. On 14 May 2018, Saudi troops were also deployed on the island, and a deal was brokered between the UAE and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of the airport and seaport to Yemen. In June 2020, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the island in a coup, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own government. Although in 2023, the Presidential Leadership Council, Yemen's internationally-recognized government, integrated the STC into the government and recognized the STC's rule of the archipelago. Under its rule, peaceful protests against the coup and the UAE's interference in Socotra were violently dispersed, and journalists who criticized the coup were arrested and beaten.\n\nGeography\nSocotra is one of the most isolated landforms on Earth of continental origin (i.e. not of volcanic origin). The archipelago was once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana and detached during the Miocene epoch, in the same set of rifting events that opened the Gulf of Aden to its northwest. The island is culturally and administratively a part of Yemen, but it geographically belongs to Africa as it represents a continental fragment that is geologically linked to the Somali Plate.\nThe archipelago consists of the main island of Socotra (3,665 km2 or 1,415 sq mi), three smaller islands, Abd al Kuri, Samhah and Darsa, and two rocky islets, Ka'l Fir'awn and Sābūnīyah, both uninhabitable by humans but important for seabirds. The island is about 125 kilometres (78 mi) long and 45 kilometres (28 mi) north to south. The distance from Socotra to Cape Guardafui, its nearest point in the African mainland, is 232 km (125 nmi), and about 351 km (190 nmi) from Ras Fartaq in mainland Arabia. It has three major physical regions:\n\nThe narrow coastal plains with its characteristic dunes, formed by monsoon winds blowing during three summer months. The wind takes up the coast sand in a spiral and, as a result, forms the snow-white Socotran sand dunes.\nThe limestone plateaus of Momi, Homhil and Diksam with its characteristic karst topography based on limestone rock areas intersected with inter-hill plains. For centuries until recently Socotra's main economic activity was subsistent transhumant animal husbandry, predominantly goats and sheep on these plateaus. The outcome is a unique and still active cultural landscape of agro-pastoralism with its characteristic rainwater harvesting systems.\nA central massif, the Hajhir Mountains, composed of granite and metamorphic rocks. rising to 1,503 metres (4,931 ft).\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Socotra is classified in the Köppen climate classification as BWh and BSh, meaning a transitional hot desert climate and a semi-desert climate with a mean annual temperature over 25 °C (77 °F). Yearly rainfall is light but is roughly spread throughout the year. Orographic lift provided by the interior mountains, especially during the northeast monsoon from October to December, results in the highest inland areas averaging as much as 800 millimetres (31.50 in) per year and receiving over 250 millimetres (9.84 in) per month during November and December. The southwest monsoon season from June to September brings strong winds and high seas. \nIn an extremely unusual occurrence, the normally arid western side of Socotra received more than 410 millimetres (16.14 in) of rain from Cyclone Chapala in November 2015. Cyclones rarely affect the island, but in 2015 Cyclone Megh became the strongest, and only, major cyclone to strike the island directly.\n\nEndemism\nThe Socotra archipelago has been dubbed the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean due to its ecological diversity and high rates of endemism. It has 835 vascular plant species, of which 37% are endemic. Six bird species, 95% of its terrestrial molluscs, and 90% of its reptiles are endemic to the archipelago. A 2016 genetic survey of all Socotran reptiles revealed unexpectedly high levels of cryptic diversity, indicating that the island's actual reptile diversity may be greater than currently recognized. Socotra is home to several native mammals, none of which are endemic.\n\nEndemic species\nDue to the dry conditions and small size of the island, its fauna tend to be small.\nThe island has several native bats and shrews, including the Etruscan shrew, which is the smallest mammal in the world by mass. Socotra is of particular interest to ornithologists. The island has been designated an endemic bird area.\nSome of the island's most striking species are its endemic plants and trees. Socotra has many native drought resistant plants which have adapted to the island's arid environment by developing large, bulbous stems in which they store their water.  One notable example is Dendrosicyos socotranus (cucumber tree) which is the only tree in the Cucurbitaceae family. This species, which can grow over six meters high, has specialized cells which expand to hold water during wet periods.\nDue to the island's long arid periods, several endemic flora have developed an evolutionary strategy of longevity,  prioritizing long individual life span over reproduction.  These endemic flora are found in dry, low-lying areas of the island, and they grow slowly and rarely fruit or flower. These slow-growing endemic species are particularly vulnerable to climate warming, as increasing dry periods may prevent them from reproducing. One example is the Dragon's Blood Tree, or Dracaena cinnabari, which may be the most well known example of Socotran endemism. The tree contains a bright red sap which is used commercially. D. cinnabari has a very distinct appearance: its trunk branches out into an umbrella-like crown with tightly packed leaves and widespread branches. This plant structure is observed in arid climates which have atmospheric moisture. Tightly packed leaves and wide spread branches facilitate the condensation of water from moisture in the air, and the shade provided by the umbrella crown may prevent evaporation of moisture from the soil. One dragon's blood forest remains on the island. The average age of these trees is approximately 300 years. This suggests that the forest is over-mature, and indicates a decline in new growth.\n\nEvolution\nSocotra's high rates of species diversity and endemism can be attributed to a long period of isolation, as well as extreme climatic conditions which vary spatially and depending on altitude.  These conditions have created a variety of ecological niches.  Researchers have attempted to date the origins of endemic species in convergence with the geological timeline of the island, which may help discern instances of vicariant speciation after the island split off from the mainland.\nPlant life on Socotra shares floristic similarities with northeast Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The genus Dirachma has two species – one is native to Socotra and the other is native to Somalia, over 1000 km away. These species share unique traits, including eight-part flowers. Several of the island's endemic species (members of the Echidnopsis genus, for example) are thought to have evolved from a single colonizing ancestor.  Once the colonizing ancestor was cut off from its original gene pool its descendents began to diversify rapidly.\nThe most ecologically diverse parts of Socotra are its wet refugia, such as its cliffs and escarpments. These areas receive significantly more rainfall and mist than the rest of the island. These isolated areas in numerous separate areas on the island have allowed for speciation to occur. Species in the refugia are twice as likely to be endemic as species on the rest of the island. The refugia are particularly sensitive to changes in the climate, and have probably expanded and retracted many times over the evolutionary history of the island. The largest wet refugium on the island is the Hajhir massif. Incredibly, fifty five of the endemic species on the mountains are endemic to that particular refugium.\n\nCurrent ecological threats\nSocotra has been experiencing a steady decline of vegetation and floral species diversity over the past several decades. These flora are vital for the survival of endemic fauna. Several factors, such as erosion, extreme weather events, and overgrazing may be responsible for this decline.  Intensified winds due to rising global temperatures threaten Socotra's old growth forests. Traditional land management which has been practiced by indigenous people on Socotra for thousands of years, is becoming less widespread as the island becomes more influenced by the outside world. Increasing populations of invasive species, such as rats and cats, also threaten the endemic flora and fauna. Species on socotra have evolved in very particular climatic conditions, and their ranges are very restricted. This makes them highly vulnerable to climate change. Without intervention, many of the island's endemic species may face extinction, including potentially numerous cryptic species that have yet to be formally described.\n\nDemographics\nMost of the inhabitants are indigenous Soqotri people from Al-Mahrah tribe, who are of Southern Arabian descent from Al Mahrah Governorate, and are said to be especially closely related with the Qara and Mahra groups of Southern Arabia. Some of the inhabitants are African, descending from former slaves who settled on the island. The majority of male residents on Socotra are reported to be in the J* subclade of Y-DNA haplogroup J. Several of the female lineages, notably those in mtDNA haplogroup N, are unique to the island.\nAlmost all inhabitants of Socotra, numbering about 50,000, live on the main island of the archipelago. The principal city, Hadibu (with a population of 8,545 at the census of 2004); the second largest town, Qalansiyah (population 3,862); and Qād̨ub (population 929) are all located on the north coast of the island of Socotra. Only about 450 people live on 'Abd-al-Kūrī and 100 on Samha; the island of Darsa and the islets of the archipelago are uninhabited.\n\nLanguage\nThe island is home to the Semitic language Soqotri, which is related to such other Modern South Arabian languages on the Arabian mainland as Mehri, Harsusi, Bathari, Shehri, and Hobyot, which became the subject of European academic study in the nineteenth century.\nThere is an ancient tradition of poetry and a poetry competition is held annually on the island. The first attested Socotran poet is believed to be the ninth-century Fatima al-Suqutriyya, a popular figure in Socotran culture. Socotra Swahili is extinct.\n\nReligion\nThe earliest account concerning the presence of Christians in Socotra stems from the early-medieval 6th century AD Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes Later the Socotrans joined the Assyrian church. During the 10th century, Arab geographer Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani recorded during his visits that most of the islanders were Christian.\nChristianity went into decline when the Mahra Sultanate took power in the 16th century, and the populace had become mostly Muslim by the time the Portuguese arrived later that century. An 1884 edition of Nature writes that the disappearance of Christian churches and monuments can be accounted for by a Wahhabi excursion to the island in 1800. Today the only remnants of Christianity are some cross engravings from the first century CE, a few Christian tombs, and some church ruins.\n\nTransport\nPublic transport on Socotra is limited to a few minibuses; car hire usually means hiring a 4WD car and a driver. Transport is a delicate matter on Socotra as road construction is considered locally to be detrimental to the island and its ecosystem. In particular, damage has occurred via chemical pollution from road construction while new roads have resulted in habitat fragmentation.\nThe only port on Socotra is 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of Hadibu. Ships connect the port with the Yemeni coastal city of Mukalla. The journey takes 2–3 days, and the service is used mostly for cargo. The UAE funded the modernization of the port on Socotra. \nYemenia and Felix Airways flew from Socotra Airport to Sana'a and Aden via Riyan Airport. As of March 2015, due to ongoing civil war involving Saudi Arabia's Air Force, all flights to and from Socotra were cancelled. During the deployment of Emirati troops and aid to the Island, multiple flight connections were made between Abu Dhabi and Hadibu as part of Emirati effort to provide Socotra residents with access to free healthcare and provide work opportunities. Currently, there are weekly scheduled flights from Cairo and Abu Dhabi to Socotra.\n\nTourism\nAmong 19th-century visitors to the island came British celebrity explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent, and their party, from mid December 1896 to mid February 1897.\nPrior to the construction of the Socotra airport, the island could only be reached by a cargo ship. The ideal time to visit Socotra is from October to April; the remaining months usually have heavy monsoon rainfall, making it difficult for tourists; flights also usually get cancelled. The island lacks any well-established hotels, although there are a few guesthouses for travelers to stay during their short visits. The island received over 1,000 tourists each year until 2014, which has since been affected by the civil war.\nTourism to the island has increased over the years as many operators have begun offering trips to the island, which Gulf Today claimed \"will become a dream destination despite the country's conflict\". In May 2021, the Ministry of Information stated that the UAE is violating the island and has been planning to control it for years, running illegal trips there for foreign tourists without obtaining any permission from the Yemeni government.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nGalápagos Islands, an archipelago of Ecuador which is also famous for its isolated geography and plant and animal species\nMasirah Island, another island with a rugged terrain off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula\nList of islands of Yemen\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrown, Gary; Mies, Bruno (2012).

      "content": "Socotra ou Socotora (en arabe et en langue mehri : سقطرى, soqotra) est une île du Yémen située en mer d'Arabie, non loin de l'entrée orientale du golfe d'Aden.\nElle se trouve à 234 kilomètres au large du cap Guardafui, qui constitue l'extrémité nord-est de la Somalie, et à 352 kilomètres au sud-est des côtes du gouvernorat d'Al Mahrah, au Yémen. Elle est la plus grande île de l'archipel de Socotra composé, outre Socotra, d'Abd al Kuri, Darsah, Samhah et des îlots rocheux de Sabuniyah et Ka'l Firawn. Socotra mesure 133 kilomètres de longueur et une quarantaine de kilomètres de largeur, pour une superficie de 3 579 km2.\nEn raison de sa biodiversité et de la présence de quelque 700 espèces uniques au monde, elle est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco au sein de l'archipel de Socotra et a été déclarée réserve de biosphère en 2003 par l'Unesco.\n\nHistoire\nSelon Edresi, géographe arabe du XIIe siècle, Alexandre le Grand, incité par Aristote, y aurait installé une colonie ionienne après avoir conquis l'Égypte.\nDans Le Périple de la mer Érythrée datant du Ier siècle, l'île est nommée Dioscoride (Dioscoridis Insula, signifiant en koinè île des Dioscures). Elle est décrite comme grande, semi-déserte et marécageuse, et possédant quelques rivières. La faune est composée de serpents, de grands lézards et de tortues. Ses habitants, (chrétiens nestoriens d'après le texte apocryphe des Actes de Thomas du IIIe siècle), sont un mélange d'Arabes, de Grecs et d'Indiens, pêcheurs et marins. Ils sont peu nombreux et vivent sur la côte septentrionale. Des ermites vivent dans les haghiers (creux dans le grès) du sud de l'île.\nVers 520, l'île est un comptoir égypto-byzantin qui commerce avec les chrétiens du Kerala, en Inde, en contournant l'empire Perse, ennemi des Byzantins.\nEn 1505, alors en expansion dans l'océan Indien et la mer Rouge, le Portugal y fonde un comptoir commercial. L'île sert de base aux Portugais pour défier les Mamelouks d’Égypte et rançonner les boutres marchands arabes. Par la suite, le comptoir est disputé par les Hollandais. Après avoir été pendant quelque temps un repaire de pirates, l'île passe en 1886 sous domination anglaise et intégrée jusqu'en 1967 au protectorat du Somaliland. Sa population est intégralement islamisée à partir de ce moment.\nDe 1967 à 1990, l'archipel de Socotra est revendiqué à la fois par la Somalie et le Yémen du Sud communiste, et l'île accueille une petite base militaire qui sert d'escale à la marine soviétique. Les conditions maritimes et météorologiques (embruns et vents de sable) dégradent les équipements électroniques rapidement et l'escale soviétique se limite, à la fin de la Guerre froide, au port et à une station-relais de communications ; ce que les satellites espions américains avaient pris pour une importante base s'est révélé être surtout des ferrailles et d'anciennes installations vétustes ou abandonnées.\nÀ partir de 1987, pendant la longue guerre civile somalienne, les gouvernements du Yémen ont officiellement proclamé Socotra comme territoire yéménite, mais à partir de 2015, c'est au Yémen que sévit la guerre civile et ce sont les Émirats arabes unis qui commencent à administrer, voire à coloniser Socotra, construisant de nouvelles infrastructures et des réseaux de télécommunication, faisant leurs propres recensements de la population locale, offrant aux habitants des contrats de travail, puis, en 2018, occupant militairement l'île malgré les protestations du gouvernement yéménite. Le 13 mai 2018, des troupes saoudiennes débarquent à leur tour à la demande du gouvernement yéménite et les occupants se retirent au profit de l'armée yéménite le lendemain, 14 mai.\nEn mai 2019, le gouvernement yéménite accuse les Émirats arabes unis de fournir une aide logistique aux séparatistes du Conseil de transition du Sud à Socotra, ce que nient les Émirats. En février 2020, un régiment de l'armée yéménite stationné à Socotra se rebelle contre le gouvernement d'Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi reconnu par l'ONU, et prête allégeance au Conseil de transition du Sud (CTS). Le 20 juin 2020, le CTS annonce avoir pris le contrôle de Socotra.\n\nGéographie\nSocotra est une île d'origine continentale. Elle faisait partie de l'ancien continent Gondwana dont elle s'est détachée au milieu du Pliocène, il y a environ 6 millions d'années, lors de la même distension continentale qui ouvrit le golfe d'Aden au nord-ouest.\nSituée à 234 kilomètres au large de la Somalie et à 352 kilomètres au sud-est du Yémen, l'île est peuplée et revendiquée par des populations issues de ces deux origines.\n\nSocotra est constituée d'une étroite plaine côtière, d'un plateau de grès truffé de cavernes karstique et de montagnes, les Haghier, s'élevant jusqu'à 1 525 mètres d'altitude. L'île mesure environ 140 kilomètres de longueur et une quarantaine de kilomètres de largeur, pour une superficie de 3 579 km2.\n\nClimat\nSocotra possède un climat tropical, désertique et semi-aride (classification de Köppen : BWh et BSh).\nLe climat chaud de Socotra est fortement influencé par les moussons. Les zones basses (les côtes ainsi qu'un bassin intérieur situé au centre de l'île) sont très sèches, tandis que les plateaux sont régulièrement arrosés.\nLa mousson d'été, qui dure de mai à septembre, n'apporte pas de pluies, mais des vents violents du sud-ouest qui atteignent des moyennes de 60 km/h à 100 km/h et rendent l'accès à l'île difficile par mer ou par air.\nDe novembre à mars, la mousson du nord-est apporte des pluies, parfois torrentielles, mais aussi des vents, moins violents mais souvent chargés de fines poussières. Les hauts plateaux sont dans la brume et bien arrosés. Les régions côtières connaissent de fortes averses sporadiques. Novembre et décembre sont les mois les plus frais de l'année, avant le retour de la chaleur dès janvier.\nDe fin mars à début mai, une saison de transition apporte des pluies bien réparties sur toute l'île. Ce sont les plus profitables de l'année pour la végétation. Les vents sont faibles et c'est paradoxalement la période la plus chaude.\nL'archipel est rarement touché par des tempêtes, mais des cyclones peuvent occasionnellement le traverser .\n\nEnvironnement\nDeux bras de mer ont séparé au Quaternaire l'archipel des deux continents africain et asiatique, induisant une évolution des espèces végétales et animales en vase clos jusqu'à ce que les humains introduisent de nouvelles espèces telles que les chèvres. Les recensements ont révélé que plus d'un tiers des 800 et quelques espèces de plantes de Socotra sont endémiques. Les botanistes rangent la flore de Socotra parmi les dix flores insulaires les plus menacées du monde.\nSocotra est considérée comme le joyau de la biodiversité de la mer d'Arabie.  Dans les années 1990, une équipe de biologistes des Nations unies a mené une enquête sur la flore et la faune de l'archipel. Près de 700 espèces endémiques y ont été recensées ; seules la Nouvelle-Zélande, Hawaii, la Nouvelle-Calédonie et les îles Galápagos surpassent ce nombre. \nLe long isolement géologique de l'archipel de Socotra, sa chaleur extrême et sa sécheresse se sont combinés pour créer une flore endémique unique et remarquable. Des études de terrain menées par le Centre pour les plantes du Moyen-Orient, appartenant au Jardin botanique royal d'Édimbourg, indiquent que 307 espèces de plantes sur 825 (37 %) de Socotra sont endémiques, c'est-à-dire qu'on ne les trouve nulle part ailleurs sur Terre. L'ensemble de la flore de l'archipel de Socotra a été reporté dans la liste rouge de l'UICN, avec 3 espèces de plantes en danger critique d'extinction et 27 espèces de plantes menacées d'extinction reconnues en 2004.\nL'une des plantes les plus originales de Socotra est le dragonnier de Socotra (Dracaena cinnabari), un étrange arbre en forme de parapluie. Sa sève rouge, présentée comme le sang des dragons mythiques, était recherchée comme colorant et est aujourd'hui utilisée comme peinture et vernis. Les divers aloès endémiques de Socotra, utilisés en médecine et en cosmétique, étaient également importants dans l'Antiquité. Parmi les autres plantes endémiques figurent une moracée pachycaule Dorstenia gigas, l’arbre-concombre Dendrosicyos socotranus, les rares grenadiers socotrans (Punica protopunica), Aloe perryi et Boswellia socotrana.\n\nL'archipel a aussi une riche faune, dont plusieurs espèces endémiques d'oiseaux, comme le Rufipenne de Socotra (Onychognathus frater), le Souimanga de Socotra (Nectarinia balfouri), le Bruant de Socotra (Emberiza socotrana), la Cisticole de Socotra (Cisticola haesitatus), Moineau de Socotra (Passer insularis), Grand-verdier de Socotra (Rhynchostruthus socotranus) et une espèce d’un genre monotypique, la Cisticole pâle (Incana incana). De nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux sont menacées par la prédation par des chats sauvages non indigènes. Avec un seul mammifère endémique, 6 espèces d'oiseaux endémiques et aucun amphibien, les reptiles constituent la faune de vertébrés de Socotran la plus représentative avec 31 espèces. Si l’on exclut les deux espèces récemment introduites, Hemidactylus robustus et Hemidactylus flaviviridis, toutes les espèces indigènes sont endémiques. L'endémisme est très élevé à la fois au niveau des espèces (29 sur 31, soit 94 %) et au niveau des genres (5 sur 12, soit 42 %). Au niveau des espèces, l'endémicité peut être encore plus élevée, des études phylogénétiques ayant révélé une diversité cachée non négligeable. Les espèces de reptiles comprennent les scinques, les lézards sans jambes et une espèce de caméléon, Chamaeleo monachus. Il existe de nombreux invertébrés endémiques, dont plusieurs araignées (telles que la tarentule Monocentropus balfouri) et trois espèces de crabes d'eau douce (un Socotra et deux Socotrapotamon). \nComme dans de nombreux systèmes insulaires isolés, les chauves-souris sont les seuls mammifères originaires de Socotra. En revanche, les récifs coralliens de Socotra sont variés, avec de nombreuses espèces endémiques. Socotra est également un des milieux hébergeant le papillon Bicyclus anynana.\nAu cours des deux mille ans d’établissements humains sur les îles, l’environnement a lentement et continuellement changé et, selon Jonathan Kingdon, « les animaux et les plantes qui restent ne représentent qu’une fraction dégradée de ce qui existait jadis ». Le Périple de la mer Érythrée, qui est daté entre le Ier et le IIIe siècle, raconte que l'île abritait des crocodiles et de grands lézards : la faune reptilienne actuelle semble donc être considérablement réduite. Il y a quelques siècles à peine, l'île comptait des rivières et des zones humides, des stocks plus importants d'arbres endémiques et des pâturages abondants. Les Portugais ont enregistré la présence de buffles  au début du XVIIe siècle. À présent, il n’y a plus que des ravins de sable, et de nombreuses plantes indigènes ne survivent que là où il y a plus d’humidité ou plus de protection contre le bétail. La faune résiduelle de Socotra est fortement menacée par les chèvres et autres espèces introduites.\nÀ la suite de la Guerre civile yéménite, Socotra a été isolée et les prix du gaz sont devenus élevés, ce qui a incité les habitants à exploiter le bois pour se chauffer. En décembre 2018, les Émirats Arabes Unis ont envoyé du gaz de cuisson aux résidents de Socotra afin de lutter contre la déforestation.\nL'île constitue une écorégion terrestre dans la classification du Fonds mondial pour la nature sous le nom de « brousses xériques de l'île de Socotra ». Elle appartient au biome des déserts et brousses xériques de l'écozone afrotropicale et fait partie de la liste « Global 200 » du WWF qui regroupe les régions biogéographiques les plus représentatives de la biodiversité planétaire. Elle est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco au sein de l'archipel de Socotra depuis 2008 et est considérée comme un point chaud de biodiversité par l'association Conservation International avec le reste la Corne africaine.\n\nListe des plantes\nPopulation\nLa plupart des habitants de l'archipel, au nombre de 42 842 en 2004, vivent à Socotra. La ville principale est Hadiboh avec une population estimée en 2004 à 8 545 habitants. Les autres villes sont Qulansiyah avec 3 862 habitants et Qād̨ub avec 929 habitants. Toutes les trois sont situées sur la côte Nord. Les îles d'Abd al Kuri et de Samhah ont une population de quelques centaines d'habitants, Darsah et les autres îles sont inhabitées.\nLa population est d'origine somalienne avec des métissages de différentes origines dont celles des différents conquérants de l'île, de religion musulmane sunnite et parle le soqotri, une langue non écrite, qui fait partie de la famille des langues sémitiques.\n\nÉconomie\nLes activités principales sont la pêche et l'élevage de bovins et de chèvres. Le climat ne permet que la culture de dattes, d'aromates et d'un peu de tabac. Les principaux produits commerciaux sont le ghî, du beurre clarifié, l'aloès et l'encens (Boswellia sp.).

      "content": "## Overview\nSocotra (Arabic: سقطرى ; Suquṭra) is an archipelago consisting mainly of four main islands and two smaller rocky islets in the Indian Ocean, an offshore territory of Yemen, near the Horn of Africa.\n\n## Understand\nDue to its remarkable biodiversity, with over a third of the local plant species found nowhere else, Socotra has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  With over 40,000 inhabitants, though, it's not just a nature reserve.\nThe island is new to tourism, so if you are looking for a luxurious vacation this is not the right destination.\nThe island is not under the control of the Yemani government and the current flights to it from other countries are illegal.\n\n## Cities\n12.6554.0333331 Hadiboh\n12.68916753.4877782 Qalansiyah\n12.63333353.953 Quadub\n12.343153.91674 Steroh\n12.66583354.065 Suq\n12.18555652.2330566 Kilmia\n\n## Other destinations\n12.70555653.5066671 Detwah lagoon\n12.58647254.354252 Hoq Cave\nHulaf\nSiqirah\n\n## Flora\nThe long geological isolation of the Socotra archipelago and its fierce heat and drought has combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora (which may, therefore, be vulnerable to introduced species such as goats and to climate change).\nThe known Socotran flora stands at over 940 species, including some 300 endemics, 16 of which are restricted to Abd Al Kuri and another 10 confined to Samha.\nMany are strange-looking remnants of ancient floras which long ago disappeared from the African /Arabian mainland.\nThey create a scene of weird vegetation and make the archipelago the world's tenth richest island group for endemic plant species.\nThere are certainly many more plant species that have yet to be discovered. For example, in the early years of the 21st century, Dr. Tony Miller of the Royal Botanical Garden in Edinburgh collected the first known specimens of a tiny carnivorous plant, which grows on moist tree trunks in the higher reaches of the Haggier Mountains.\nOnly in sheltered valleys and higher mountain areas is the vegetation more luxuriant.\nDifferent main types of vegetation can be recognised.\nThe most distinctive is the open deciduous shrub land of coastal plains and low inland hills dominated by the common shrub, Croton socotranus, and tree succulents such as the bizarre Adenium and Dendrosicyos.The higher altitudes are home of frankincense, Socotran Aloe and wild pomegranate. One of the most famous botanical curiosities of Socotra is the Dragon’s Blood Tree (Draecaenia Cinnabari), whose name is derived from the fact that by carving its trunk it pours out a red resin, it is said by the ancient belief, to be the blood of the dragon, also there is ancient belief that the tree grown on the same place where Cain killed his brother Abel, for this reason the tree called in Arabic (brothers blood's tree).\n\n## Fauna\nThe island of Socotra has a rich variety of plant and animal species, with a high degree of endemism. 12 mammal and more than 223 species of birds have been recorded here with new species being found every year.\nOver 48 of the bird species breed here, while 85 species are regular migrants or winter visitors.\nThere are eight bird species that can be found nowhere else, such as the Socotra Starling Onychognathus frater, the Socotra Sunbird Chalcomitra balfouri, Socotra Sparrow Passer insularis, Socotra BuntingEmberiza socotrana, Socotra WarblerIncana incana, Socotra CisticolaCisticola haesitatus and Socotra Golden-winged Grosbeak Rhynchostruthus socotranus\nAbout 12 species of mammals are known from Socotra, but all of them have been introduced by man or may occasionally come from the mainland. Further taxonomic studies are needed to clarify the status of a number of forms. The coastal area with the shores, sea-cliffs, rocky slopes, and small mangrove belts appear to be a suitable breeding habitat for sea birds.\nExtremely rich and interesting is the reptile fauna comprising 19 out of 22 endemic species. Nesting of sea turtles, probably Green Turtles but possibly Hawksbills, takes place on the north coast.\nOrnithologists believe that more detailed study of the ten endemic subspecies will lead to the splitting of some to full specific status. This most obvious bird to the visitor, however, is the ubiquitous Egyptian Vulture, known locally as saeedoh or Al Baladiya Socotri, or Municipal Bird, for its habit of cleaning up everything such as kitchen waste.\nHowever, this unique biodiversity in the island and its marine surroundings enriched with precious fish-wealth, coral reefs and other marine life has become threatened by predators who sniff their prey of such rare plants, animals, and birds. Also the exploitation of the fish wealth exposes it to loss.\nSocotra is an eco-tourism system with limited infrastructure and new to the international tourist market, and therefore the hotel accommodations are not quite like other destinations.\nThere are two information centers at the airport and in Hadibo.\n\n## When to go\nClimate is an important consideration. And this depends on your interest. Nature enthusiasts should go from early October to late April. The monsoon occurs in July till mid-August (during July in the south east and south west of the island, wind surfing activity can be arranged). Generally, wildlife and natural viewing is best from the end of January through May.\n\n## By plane\nCommercial flights to Socotra are intermittent and difficult. The only legal route is to take a Yemenia flight from the Yemeni city Mukalla. The only direct – but illegal – route from overseas is to take an Air Arabia flight from Abu Dhabi, as Yemen does not sanction it, because it doesn't have military control over the island. Any proof of travel to Socotra from the UAE, which militarily controls and administers Socotra using Southern Transitional Council militias since 2018, can result in difficulties in mainland Yemen, also because of the difficulty in providing consular assistance.\n12.63055653.9055561 Socotra Airport.

(updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Get around\nYou can go around the island only  by local tour company,  how will organize the complete tour Package like accommodation, car 4×4, tour guide, food full board, visa and sea tour. As tourism start in 1998 socotra guide was the first local tour company established on Socotra in 2003.\n\n## See\nSocotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea. Although the region is small, it is characterized by unique land and marine biodiversity.\nThe interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau.  While on the outer coastline, breathtaking natural beaches have pure white sand dunes and palm trees.  Socotra Island is very rich and is home to many rare spectacular species of reefs, fish, birds, plants, and trees which are not found anywhere else in the world. The limestone plateau and the Hagghier Mountains are the richest areas for endemic plant species, but endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation.  One of the most famous plants is the dragon's blood tree \"dracaena cinnabara\" which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth.  The tree got its name because if any damage is made to the bark then a dark red liquid oozes out.\nThere is also the Desert Rose (adenium obesium) which looks like a blooming elephant leg.  Also found in Socotra's landscape is the ever-strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree.  In addition there are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies.  There is so much beauty all around the island, it is difficult not the appreciate to magnificent scenery and wildlife.\n\n## Do\nCamp: With a bit of water for washing, a good meal and warm sleeping surrounded by virgin nature, camping on the beaches will provide a very special break from the every day routine in civilization!\nHiking:  The Scant, Tinnera, Firmihin, Dersmotin regions, are the most popular destinations for trekkers.  Hiking is for everyone and even for those who are less athletic.  However, for more difficult and high altitude trails, it is recommended to be accompanied by a local guide.\nCamel back ride: It is an opportunity to get to know and enjoy the spectacular scenery and relaxed the rhythm of ancient time.  This is more of a less active adventure.  The camel back rides provide a more relaxing ride over plateaus and colorful panoramas and mountains.\nSurf:  Socotra has excellent conditions for surfing. The best time to come for this activity is during the monsoon season from June up to late August.  In July the wind speed can reach up to 60 mph and you have to be aware of such conditions. Since the winds can be very rough it is recommended that only experienced surfers participate.\nScuba dive/ Snorkel: Dive into the tropical warm weather filled with coral reefs.  Enjoy swimming among the hundreds of species of fish and marine life such as barracudas, monkfish, dolphins, rays and even mantas.  Diving for all ages and levels.\nBird watching tours:  This is for anyone who has an interest in birds.  Excellent way to view nature and the highly diverse bird population while avoiding harming any wildlife.\nLocal boat safaris and fishing: Take one of the organized tours and be taken to incomparable destinations.  The trip to Shouab beach is a half day tour to discover the beauty of this remarkable destination. With the clear water and white sands you can snorkel and relax. While driving the boat, dolphins can be seen swimming right next to the boat.\nAlso go on a fascinating fishing experience with some of the locals.\nRemarkable volcanic caves: Explore the Hoq Cave with its overwhelming beauty and variety of crystal decorations.\nBeaches Shouab, Qalansia, Arher, Noget, Amaq among others\nWadis and fresh water pools Homhil, Wadi Dirhir and others\n\n## Eat\nSocotra is a remote island and therefore their cuisine is limited and simple.  Local restaurants often serve fresh fish, chicken, goat, rice, and potatoes.  The fish is highly recommended and all meals are typically served with flat Arabic bread.\nThere are also restaurants at each of the five hotels with a simple menu similar to that of the local restaurants.\nOranges, bananas, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, bottled water, and soft drinks can all be bought at shops in town.\nVegetables can be bought also but they are more expensive because they must be shipped over.\nIf you are camping in Socotra, your driver/guide will be responsible for your meals (typically some delicious freshly cooked fish). Although it's nice to help the driver you don't have to.\nShabwah Restaurant\nSocotra Holidays and Tours\nTaj Socotra Tourist Hotel\nHadramout Restaurant\nMa'aly Restaurant\n\n## Drink\nBecause Yemen is an Islamic country, there are no alcoholic beverages provided except at five-star hotels in the big cities on the mainland. Bottled water and soft drinks can be purchased at shops in town.\nBottled water is also available at the campsites, and tea is served with all the meals as well.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are four hotels in Hadibo: Taj Socotra Hotel, Socotra Tourist Hotel, Heathrow Hotel, Al-Gawhara (Diamond) Hotel  and Summerland Hotel.  These hotels may not be the most luxurious, but they do provide air-conditioning, televisions, and refrigerators in all of the rooms.  Most of the rooms at these hotels have their own bathroom, but there are a few rooms at the Hafijj Hotel and Socotra Hotel that must share bathrooms.  There is a restaurant in each of the hotels with simple yet delicious cuisine. Considering Socotra is a fairly new eco-tourism destination, their facilities are decent.  In addition, there is another hotel at the airport and several guest houses around the island.\nThe most popular lodging is camping on the beaches.  There are several campsites that allow tourists to barbecue on the beach with beautiful mountain views in the background.  Tourists can choose to purchase camping tour packages which include a driver or guide that will show tourists around the beaches as well as provide meals during their stay.  It is a fantastic way to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the island.\nHotel Heathrow, +966 59 529 2959, on the waterfront in Hadibu\nTaj Socotra Tourist Hotel, +967 5 660 626, on the western edge of Hadibu\nSummerland Hotel, +967 5 660 350\nHotel Al-Gawhara (Diamond)\n\n## Stay safe\nMany governments advise against all travel to Yemen, including Socotra. Do not take photos of military installations and equipment and the airport. Comply with orders and searches from Emirati and Saudi Arabian armed forces. Do not instruct your driver to drive quickly as you are approaching an armed checkpoint. You risk indefinite detention by the transitional government otherwise.\n\n## Stay healthy\nMalaria is not common, but malaria prophylaxis is recommended.  Cholera is not present on the island at all. The US CDC recommends having up to date polio and measles vaccinations. Rabies vaccinations are also advised due to the prevalence of rabies, and because hospitals in Yemen lack adequate stock of rabies vaccines.\nThe archipelago's two hospitals are small and basic, offer substandard service and are ill equipped, especially for life threatening illnesses and injuries. Pharmacies are located in Hadibo, but often suffer from a shortage of medicines. Medical evacuations are difficult to organise.\n12.6471854.017983 Khalifa bin Zayed Hospital, Hadibu.
