The Old City of Sanaʽa is a recognised UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Amanat Al Asimah Governorate, Yemen.  As of 2003, the district had a population of 63,398 inhabitants. The old fortified city has been inhabited for more than 2,500 years and contains many intact architectural sites. The oldest, partially standing architectural structure in the Old City of Sanaʽa is Ghumdan Palace. The city was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1986. Efforts are underway to preserve some of the oldest buildings some of which, such as the Samsarh and the Great Mosque of Sanaʽa, is more than 1,400 years old. Surrounded by ancient clay walls that stand 9–14 metres (30–46 ft) high, the Old City contains more than 100 mosques, 12 hammams (baths), and 6,500 houses. Many of the houses resemble ancient skyscrapers, reaching several stories high and topped with flat roofs. They are decorated with elaborate friezes and intricately carved frames and stained-glass windows.
British writer Jonathan Raban visited in the 1970s and described the city as "fortress-like, its architecture and layout resembling a labyrinth", further noting "It was like stepping out into the middle of a vast pop-up picture book. Away from the street, the whole city turned into a maze of another kind, a dense, jumbled alphabet of signs and symbols."
One of the most popular attractions is Suq al-Milh (Salt Market), where it is possible to buy salt along with bread, spices, raisins, cotton, copper, pottery, silverware, and antiques. The 7th-century Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr (the Great Mosque) is one of the oldest mosques in the world. The Bāb al-Yaman ("Gate of the Yemen") is an iconized entry point through the city walls and is more than 1,000 years old.
A commercial area of the Old City is known as Al Madina where development is proceeding rapidly. In addition to three large hotels, there are numerous stores and restaurants. The area also contains three parks.
Traditionally, the Old City was composed of several quarters (hara), generally centred on an endowed complex containing a mosque, a bathhouse, and an agricultural garden (maqshama). Human waste from households was disposed of via chutes. In the mountain air, it dried fairly quickly and was then used as fuel for the bathhouse. Meanwhile, the gardens were watered using gray water from the mosque's ablution pool.
One of these quarters was Qa' al-Yahud, or the Jewish Quarter, located on the Western side of the old city. It had a distinct architecture that was defined by buildings with larger floor plans, houses which had the main socializing room elevated to the top of the house, and tended to be shorter than the standard houses of the city.

The Great Mosque of Sana'a (Arabic: الجامع الكبير بصنعاء‎, al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr bi-Ṣanʿāʾ) is an ancient mosque in Sana'a, Yemen, and one of the oldest mosques in the world. The mosque is said to have been founded in the early Islamic period, suggested to be in 633. While the precise date of construction is unknown, the earliest recorded renovations occurred under Caliph al-Walid I in the early 8th century, implying a possible earlier date of construction. The mosque was reportedly built in part from spolia from the Himyarite-era Ghumdan Palace and from the Axumite Christian Church of al-Qalis that formerly occupied the site. The Great Mosque is the largest and most notable of over one hundred mosques in the Old City of Sana’a.
The building has undergone renovations in the 8th century, the 13th century, and during the Ottoman period. An important archaeological find was the Sana'a manuscript, discovered there during restoration in 1972. Today, the Great Mosque of Sana’a is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Old City of Sana'a.

Location
The city of Sana'a was the military center of the pre-Islamic kingdom of the Sabeans and was an important center for the Himyarite Kingdom. The mosque, commissioned by Muhammad, who instructed for its construction within the garden of the Persian governors, was built upon the ruins of Sheba's Ghumdan Palace, between the two areas of Sana'a at the time: al-Qati and al-Sirar. The Great mosque was built near the suq, which was already in place at the time of its construction.
In later years, city planning, expansion, and orientation were greatly influenced by the construction of the Great Mosque and two other mosques on the city's north side.

History
Around 630 CE (6 AH), according to early Islamic sources, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was said to have commanded the construction of the Great Mosque of Sana’a, and the mosque is known as the first mosque to have been built outside of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. During this post-Hijra period (622-632 CE), Sana'a was central in the propagation of the Islamic religion. Many of the archaeological finds discovered in the Great Mosque substantiate an argument for its construction to the era when Muhammad was alive, including several spolia from the Axumite Cathedral as well as from the Sabaean Ghumdan Palace. During the 7th century, the remains of pre-Islamic Sana'a were largely destroyed when it became the center for the spread of the Islamic faith during the early years of the Hijrah. This is evidenced by the architectural remains of pre-Islamic buildings found within the Great Mosque.
From 705 to 715 (86–96 AH), the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I expanded the mosque. An inscription found in the courtyard of the mosque dates to 753 CE,  in the Abbasid period.
In 876/7 CE, floods twice caused substantial damage to the mosque, after which it was renovated.
In the early 9th century, a minaret was constructed on the east side. In the year 911 CE, Karmatis invaded the city, damaging the mosque.
In the twelfth century, 1130 CE, the Isma`ili Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi restored much of the mosque. She was responsible for the sculpted ceilings of the mosque's eastern, western, and northern wings. The mosque's western minaret was built as a part of this restoration.
In the early 16th century, the mosque was renovated with a domed square structure and the paving of its courtyard.

Architecture
The Great Mosque is built in a style of stepped stone, which is linked to similar ancient Abyssinian Axumite stonework. The wooden ceilings, made of lacunari's wood, are carved and painted.

The central courtyard measures 80 by 60 metres (260 ft × 200 ft), with prayer halls arranged in a north–south direction. Halls with three aisles aligned along the east–west direction are built with materials of the pre-Islamic period brought from other areas. Within the courtyard is a domed structure dating back to the 16th century. It is an Ottoman building that resembles the Ka'ba in Mecca, however, it is argued that the two are not connected due to the alternating layers of colored materials, which is an ablaq technique, predating Islam within the region. This structure first served as the mosque's treasury, and later as a storage place for waqf and has a large library and other ancient manuscripts. This structure may originally have had a water feature such as an ablution pool beneath it for those wishing to purify themselves when visiting the mosque.The interior stone arcades of the flat roofs of the mosque are suggested to be Byzantine architectural features of the Axumite Empire. This is evidenced by the fact that the Axumite Empire erected its largest cathedral within the city of Sana'a and that remains of this cathedral, as well as from Gumdan palace and Christian and Jewish places of worship, are incorporated into the Great Mosque. Further evidence of this relation is an inscription in the pre-Islamic language of the region, Sabaic, in a reused stone arch support implies it is connected to Byzantine architecture.The western minaret, built during Queen Arwa bint Ahmad's restoration, is similar to those of the mosques of the same period built in Cairo, due to her close links with the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt.

Discoveries
In 1972–73, when plaster was removed by archaeologists, they discovered some 65 artifacts, including large quantities of old manuscripts and parchments, as well as the Sana'a manuscript, found by construction workers while renovating an attic wall. Four thousand rare Arabic manuscripts were also uncovered that are linked to the start of Islam, the Umayyad period, and Sheba's Palace of Ghamdan and its destruction. One of the Koran found here is said to have been written or compiled by Imam Ali, which is preserved by the mosque library. Early book bindings found at the mosque have been well documented by scholars such as Ursula Dreibholz (1997).
Other archaeological finds at the Great Mosque are remnants of vaults and old buildings connected to the capital when it contained the Axumite Church of al-Qalis, unearthed in 2006.

Preservation
The Great Mosque is included on the UNESCO World Heritage Site List, designated in 1986 as list no. 345, under Criteria: (iv)(v)(vi), which includes 103 mosques, 14 hammams, and over 6,000 houses of Sana'a, all built before the eleventh century. Preservation of the Great Mosque, which is of exceptional religious and historical value, has been supported by UNESCO's World Heritage Institute of Training and Research-Asia and Pacific (Shanghai). Analysis of the damage suffered by the mosque over several centuries includes evidence of floods, rains, soil subsidence, old electrical wiring and connections, groundwater seepage, vandalism, and wars, and also weak old buildings adjoining the mosque.
Repairs and maintenance, initiated in 2003, continue to be carried out in phases, such as electrical system renovation. Plastering has been redone, including restoration of the old traditional plaster known as qudad. Pavings have been improved and minarets are being restored. Improvements have been made in ablution areas and modern toilets were added. Other improvements have been made to the water supply and sewerage systems, as well as the removal of old buildings that do not match the historical and architectural features of the mosque.

The Dar al-Hajar (Arabic: دار الحجر, "Stone House" or "Rock Palace") is a former royal palace located in Wadi Dhar about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Sanaa, Yemen.  Built in 1920 as the summer retreat of Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, Imam of Yemen from 1904 to 1948, it sits on top of a structure built in 1786 for the scholar al-Imam Mansour.  The royal family resided in the palace until the North Yemen Civil War.  The palace is currently a museum.

History
The construction of the palace dates back to the late 18th century when the Imam of Yemen, Al-Mansur Ali bin Abbas, ordered his minister Ali bin Saleh Al-Amari (1736-1798), who was renowned for his expertise in architecture, astronomy, poetry, and literature, to build a summer palace for him in Wadi Dhahr. Historians narrate that it was built on the ruins of an ancient Sabaean palace known as the Fortress of Dhi Saydan, constructed by the Himyarites in 3000 B.C. The fortress was destroyed by the Turks four hundred years ago and was restored in the early 20th century by Imam Yahya Hamid al-Din after being passed down through several Yemeni Imams. It is currently a tourist attraction regularly visited by locals and foreigners. The construction remained in its initial form for years until Imam Yahya bin Hamid al-Din added the upper floor (the Mafraj).
The accounts regarding the founding and construction of Dar Al-Hajar vary. Some stories suggest that the palace was destroyed dozens of times but was always rebuilt. It is said that during their first invasion of Yemen, the Turks preferred to reside in this palace because of its unique architectural style and the valley, which, along with other surrounding sites and landscapes, forms a garden and orchard for the residents and visitors of this historical palace. These places are known for their perennial greenery, with the valley being famous for growing grapes, peaches, and quinces, in addition to the giant doum palm trees, which have begun to disappear due to the expansion of qat cultivation. It is also said that during Turkish rule, the country experienced heavy rains that led to the palace's collapse, leaving no trace of it.
Subsequently, Imam Abdullah Al-Mansur came to the area and rebuilt the three floors using black basalt stone, which is the structure that exists today. He then lived there, and after his death, Imam Al-Nasir resided in the palace. It is said that during his rule, there were some wars and conflicts between him and the people of Hamdan, who killed him while he was asleep. They took his body and buried him, along with his guards, in an area south of Wadi Dahr. The locals say that his grave still exists and is known to everyone.
After the death of Imam Al-Nasir, the imams were apprehensive about residing in this palace. Imam Yahya even built some other palaces in the valley. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to restore Dar Al-Hajar, adding several additional floors using fired bricks and incorporating other facilities such as the Mafraj, where he would receive people. The Imam also constructed a mosque adjacent to the palace and inscribed on its door "Built for God by Al-Mutawakkil ala Allah", which remains there to this day.

Architectural style
The palace consists of seven floors that are designed to align with the natural formation of the rock (the foundation of the structure). At its entrance, there is an ancient talouqa tree estimated to be 700 years old. The entry to the palace is through a wide passage paved with large stones, leading to a rest area. The Mafraj is located on the northern side, overlooking a circular water basin constructed from black basalt stone.

In popular culture
In 1974, Pier Paolo Pasolini used the palace as the home of Princess Dunya in his film The Arabian Nights.

Le Dar al-Hadjar (en arabe : دار الحجر, Dâr al-Ḥadjar) est un palais situé dans la vallée de Wadi Dhar à environ 15 km au nord-ouest de Sanaa, capitale du Yémen.  
Appelé également palais du Rocher (Rock Palace en anglais), il fut la résidence d'été de l'Imam Yahya. Le palais, érigé sur un rocher de 50 m de hauteur, fut construit dans les années 1920. Avec sa maison-tour de brique crue, dont les façades sont animées de frises géométriques en blanc de chaux, il représente très remarquablement l'architecture yéménite. 
Le 5 juin 2015 le site a été touché par des frappes aériennes de la coalition menée par les Saoudiens, bombardement qui visait des chiites Houthis.

Shibam (Arabic: شِبَام, romanized: Shibām), officially the Old Walled City of Shibam (Arabic: مدينة شبام القديمة وسورها), is a town in Wadi Hadhramaut in eastern Yemen with about 7,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of the Shibam District in the Hadhramaut Governorate. It is known for its mudbrick-made high-rise buildings, with some of the buildings reaching as high as 11 stories. The design centred around protecting the residents of the city from Bedouin attacks.
The city was founded around the 3rd century and became the capital of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in 300 AD. Its strategic location along ancient trade routes contributed to its prosperity. Shibam has been continuously inhabited for an estimated 1,700 years. In 1982, Shibam was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique architecture and cultural significance. It is sometimes informally referred to as the "Manhattan of the Desert" (مَانْهَاتَن ٱلصَّحْرَاء) or "Chicago of the Desert" (شِيْكَاغو ٱلصَّحْرَاء).

History
The first known inscription about the city dates from the 3rd century CE. According to al-Hamdani, the origins of the city of Shibam date back to the pre-Islamic period, when the town rose to prominence until it became the capital of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in 300 AD, after the destruction of its previous capital, Shabwa, located in the far west of the Hadhramaut Valley. It is not clear whether the current city is standing where the ancient city stood, a theory suggests that the city's rise of more than 6 meters from the surrounding floor plain might be because of the accumilation of ruins over a long period of time, although there hasn't been any archaeological excavations that back this theory up and it might be a natural outcrop of the mountain spur behind it.
There are two major archaeological sites near Shibam: Jujah and Gabusa. Jujah used to be a quarry for large squared building stones. Gabusa was the site of an Assyrian-style bronze lion's head.
In the 20th century, it was one of the three major cities of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, the others being Mukalla and Ash-Shihr.
The city was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982.
The 2008 Yemen cyclone flooded Shibam causing some of the buildings to collapse.
During the Yemen Civil War, the city suffered some damage after insurgents detonated a car bomb. There was also coalition bombing in the area. In 2015, UNESCO listed the city, along with Old Sana'a, as "cultural heritage at risk".

Culture
Architecture
Shibam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mudbrick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, the present town dates to 1533. Many houses, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.
Shibam is often called "the oldest skyscraper city in the world". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 m (98 feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. The city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name "the walled city of Shibam".

Threats
The mudbrick buildings are frequently threatened by wind, rain, and heat erosion, and require constant upkeep in order to maintain their structures. The city was heavily affected by flooding from a tropical storm in 2008. The foundations of many of the buildings in the city were compromised by the flood waters, eventually leading to their collapse. It was also the target of an Al Qaeda attack in 2009.
In 2015, Shibam was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger when violent civil war erupted in Yemen. Historic buildings were significantly damaged during heavy bombing in Sana'a, and remain at risk from armed conflict.

Geography
The town is located in the central-western area of Hadhramaut Governorate, in the desert of Ramlat al-Sab'atayn. Its main road links Sana'a and other cities of western Yemen to the far eastern territories. The nearest towns are Seiyun, seat of an airport, and Tarim, both in the east. Another road, departing from the village of Alajlanya, in the west, links Shibam to Mukalla, the governorate's capital on the Indian Ocean.

Climate
Shibam has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh). At an average temperature of 28.0 degrees Celsius (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), June is the hottest month of the year. January is the coldest month, with temperatures averaging 18.6 °C (65.5 °F).

Influence
The Dubai Global Village, an open-air shopping and entertainment complex in the United Arab Emirates, includes a Yemeni pavilion with mud-brick structures intended to evoke the architecture of Shibam.

شِبَام (بكسر الشين) هي بلدة أثرية ومركز مديرية شِبام في محافظة حضرموت في شرق اليمن. تشكل المدينة المسوّرة التي تعود إلى القرن السادس عشر أحد أقدم النماذج وأفضلها للتنظيم المدني الدقيق المرتكز على مبدأ البناء العمودي. وتعود تسميتها «بمانهاتن الصحراء» إلى مبانيها البرجية الشاهقة المنبثقة من الطين، يبلغ تعداد سكانها 16094 نسمة حسب الإحصاء الذي جرى عام 2004.
في 2 يوليو 2015 أضافت اليونسكو مدينة صنعاء القديمة وشبام على قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المعرضة للخطر.

التاريخ
وُصفت مدينة شِبَام المسورة التي تعود للقرن السادس عشر بأنها "مانهاتن" أو "شيكاغو" الصحراء، ترتفع المدينة من حافة جرف وادي حضرموت وتضم مجموعة من الأبراج الشاهقة المبنية من الطوب المجفف بالشمس. تقع المدينة في محطة توقف مهمة للقوافل على طريق التوابل والبخور عبر الهضبة العربية الجنوبية، وقد بنيت مساكنها التي يصل ارتفاعها إلى سبعة طوابق على مخطط شبكي محصن مستطيل الشكل من الشوارع والميادين.
بنيت المدينة على نتوء صخري يرتفع عدة مئات من الأمتار فوق قاع الوادي، وحلت محل مستوطنة سابقة دمرت جزئيًا بسبب فيضان هائل في 1532-1533. يعود تاريخ مسجد المدينة إلى القرنين التاسع والعاشر والقلعة من القرن الثالث عشر، لكن أول استيطان بشري فيها كان في فترة ما قبل الإسلام.
أصبحت المدينة عاصمة لمملكة حضرموت بعد تدمير العاصمة السابقة شبوة عام 300 بعد الميلاد والتي كانت تقع إلى الغرب على طول الوادي. في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر أعاد التجار العائدون من آسيا إحياء المدينة المسورة، ومنذ ذلك الحين توسعت إلى الضفة الجنوبية للوادي لتضم ضاحية جديدة.
في العصر الحديث ساهمت عدة عوامل في تدهور المدينة، كالتخلي عن نظام إدارة الفيضانات الزراعي القديم في الوادي، والضغط الزائد على أنظمة الصرف الصحي التقليدية من خلال إدخال إمدادات المياه الحديثة إلى جانب عدم كفاية الصرف، إلى جانب التغييرات في إدارة الثروة الحيوانية.
يعكس التصميم الكثيف لشبام المحاط بمنازل مرتفعة متجاورة داخل الأسوار الخارجية استجابة حضرية للحاجة إلى الملجأ والحماية من قبل العائلات المتنافسة، فضلاً عن مكانتها الاقتصادية والسياسية، لذا تعد مدينة شبام القديمة المحاطة بأسوار وموقعها في وادي حضرموت نموذجًا بارزًا للاستيطان البشري واستخدام الأراضي وتخطيط المدن. تعتبر الهندسة المعمارية المحلية لشبام، بما في ذلك تأثيرها المرئي الناشئ من السهل الفيضي للوادي والتصميم الوظيفي والمواد وتقنيات البناء، تصميما مميزا في الثقافة التقليدية العربية والإسلامية ولكنه ضعيف للغاية.
تشكل المناظر الطبيعية المحيطة بالأراضي المروية بكميات كبيرة والتي كانت ولا تزال تستخدم في الزراعة نظامًا اقتصاديًا متكاملًا يشمل الزراعة الفيضية واستخدام الطين لبناء المباني التي لا توجد في أي مكان آخر في المنطقة.

الجغرافيا
تقع مدينة شِبام في الجمهورية اليمنية في محافظة حضرموت وتعد في قلب المحافظة حيث تقع بين مدينة سيئون ومدينة القطن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء قرابة 990 كم، وعن عاصمة محافظة حضرموت المكلا 350 كيلومتر، وهي على بعد 21.5 كيلومتر عن مدينة سيئون، مركز وادي حضرموت.

الطقس
الصيف في شبام طويل وحار وجاف وغائم جزئيا، والشتاء قصير ومريح وجاف وصافي في الغالب. على مدار العام، تتراوح درجة الحرارة عادةً من 12 درجة مئوية إلى 39 درجة مئوية ونادراً ما تقل عن 8 درجات مئوية أو أعلى من 40 درجة مئوية.

Chibam ou Shibam, en arabe شبام, est une ville du Yémen, située dans le gouvernorat de l'Hadramaout à 480 kilomètres à l'est de la capitale Sanaa. Chibam est peuplée de 13 300 habitants (2004). La Chibam moderne est distante d'une centaine de mètres de l'ancienne, les deux quartiers étant séparés par la route no 5 et le Wadi Hadramaout.

Ville ancienne
La très ancienne ville de Chibam, dont la toute première occupation humaine remonte à l'époque préislamique, est remarquable par son architecture en immeubles de briques de terre crue de plusieurs étages séparés par un dédale de ruelles étroites. Elle fut à de nombreuses reprises la capitale du royaume hadramaout. Les habitations peuvent atteindre sept étages et sont construites suivant un plan quadrillé de rues et de places fortifiées et rectangulaires.
Shibam, qui est maintenant un site du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO, est connu pour son architecture. Les maisons de Shibam sont toutes faites de briques crues, chaque étage ayant une ou deux pièces. Bien que Shibam existe depuis environ 1 700 ans, la plupart des maisons de la ville datent du XVIe siècle. Cependant, beaucoup ont été reconstruites à de nombreuses reprises au cours des derniers siècles.
Située sur un éperon rocheux, la ville est enclose dans une enceinte rectangulaire d'environ 330 m par 250 m. La méthode de construction des immeubles en terre crue est ancestrale et suit un plan bien défini ; les plus anciennes datent du XVIe siècle. Pour lutter contre les intempéries, les façades sont recouvertes d'un enduit épais qu'il faut renouveler régulièrement. Son « urbanisme rigoureux fondé sur le principe de la construction en hauteur », lui vaut le surnom de « Manhattan du désert » et son inscription au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.
Un vaste programme de restauration architectural est en cours.

Ville moderne
Dans la culture
La vieille ville, de par son tracé des rues en quadrillage et l'importante hauteur de ses maisons à étages, est surnommée « la Manhattan du désert » en référence à l'arrondissement new-yorkais du même nom.
C'est à Chibam que Pier Paolo Pasolini a tourné le film Les Mille et Une Nuits sorti en 1974.
Sur Super Mario 64, dans le niveau Monde trempé-séché, une photographie de Chibam est utilisé pour illustrer le ciel. C'est le seul niveau du jeu utilisant une photographie d'une ville réelle en tant qu'illustration du ciel.

## Overview
Shibam is in the Hadhramaut region of Yemen. The unique, sixteenth century, mud-built, high rise apartment buildings for which the city is famous constitute a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city dates back to the second century AD, while the high rises were built in the Middle Ages to protect the citizens from Bedouin raids. The bizarre "skyline" that the high rises (some sixteen stories tall) bestow upon the city has led to the moniker, "Manhattan of the Desert."

As of March 2024 there are weekly flights from Cairo  CAI  IATA to Seiyun GXF   IATA which is relatively near (approximately 20 km) from Shibam.

## See
Al-Mihdhar mosque.

## Buy
The main streets of the city have a number of stores located in buildings. The stores sell some interesting souvenirs not found elsewhere in Yemen, particularly antique window frames and furniture. However, most of these are not real antiques but are new pieces, made to look old by the local craftsmen.
The main thing to buy is the original wooden Shibam locks and keys. These decorated pieces are actual keys that look similar to hairbrushes. The pins in the key are made to align with holes in the lock to unlock the door. These can be bought at most shops in the city.
The shopkeepers in Shibam are not prepared to bargain much. They insist that their prices are already low and that they do not intend to lower them by much. The traveller arriving from Sanaa, where the initial prices are usually exorbitant, may find this confusing at first.

## Drink
A small cafe on the square at the entrance to the city serves tea. You can also smoke a water pipe or play dominoes. A lot of locals usually sit in this square, making it a great place to get the feel of the country.

Zabid (Arabic: زَبِيد) (also spelled Zabīd, Zabeed and Zebid) is a town with an urban population of around 52,590 people, located on Yemen's western coastal plain. It is one of the oldest towns in Yemen, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. However, in 2000, the site was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The town was the capital of several ruling dynasties in Yemen over many centuries.

History
The town is one of the oldest in Yemen. It was originally a village known as al-Husayb that was inhabited by the Asha'ir tribe. It later took on the name of the Wadi Zabid, the valley to its south. According to tradition, the town's early history is associated with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who is said to have built the al-Asha'ir Mosque as the fifth mosque in the history of Islam. 
The present town was created circa 820 by Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Ziyad, the founder of the Ziyadid dynasty, who had been sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to suppress a rebellion of the Asha'ir and Akk tribes. It became the capital of the Ziyadids (up to 1016) and continued to serve this role under their successors, the Najahid dynasty (from 1022 to 1158) and the Mahdids (1158 to 1174). During this time the city grew in importance. Its mosques, including the al-Asha'ir Mosque and the Great Mosque, became centers of Islamic learning. Its location on the road between Mecca and Aden also granted the city economic prosperity.
In 1067, during the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Banu Najah clan under Sa'id Ibn Najah, the prince of Zabid, attacked the travel party of the Sulayhid sultan, Ali al-Sulayhi, and his wife Asma bint Shihab. They killed Ali and took Asma prisoner. She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid, and the severed head of her spouse was reportedly planted on a pole visible from her cell. After a year's imprisonment, she managed to get a message through to her son and daughter-in-law in Sanaa, and her son stormed Zabid and freed her.
Ali ibn Mahdi, a native of the Yemeni highlands, founded the Mahdid dynasty in the Tihama region. Al-Himyari and his followers burned down several districts north of Zabid. He had sworn to put the Abyssinians into slavery and ordered his men to kill everyone, including the handicapped. Out of desperation, the people of Zabid sought assistance from the Zaydi imam Ahmed ibn Sulayman against al-Himyari. The Zaydi imam ordered Fatiq III to be executed on account of his alleged homosexuality. Fatiq III was either killed by the Imam, the Mahdids, or his own soldiers. With this event, the slave dynasty came an end and the Mahdids took over Zabid in 1158.
After the Ayyubids took control of Yemen in 1174, Zabid continued to be the economic and political center of the region. Under the Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454), the official capital was moved to Ta'izz but the rulers continued to use Zabid as a winter residence. The city reached its apogee during this period and had a larger number of palaces, gardens, and religious institutions than any other city in Yemen. Al-Khazraji, a local 14th-century Arab writer, claimed that the city counted between 230 and 240 mosques. Even today, the city reportedly has the highest concentration of mosques in Yemen.
Hadım Suleiman Pasha extended the Ottoman Empire's authority to include Zabid in 1539. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of Yemen Eyalet.

Today, however, Zabid is at the economic margins of modern Yemen. Muhammad Abdul-Wali's novel Sana'a: An Open City tells the story of a young man who traveled to Zabid in the mid-20th century and was surprised to find the town had become a backwater. Some descendants of the Rasulids continue to use Zabid alongside their nobiliary particles.

Geography
Zabid has an urban population of around 52,590 persons. It is located on Yemen's western coastal plain, in the Tihama region.

World Heritage Site
Zabid was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. Zabid's Great Mosque occupies a prominent place in the town. The vestiges of its university can also be visited. In 2000, Zabid was listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger; the listing was made at the behest of the Yemeni government due to a state of poor upkeep and conservation. According to a UNESCO report, roughly "40% of the city's houses have been replaced by concrete buildings, and other houses and the ancient souk are in a deteriorating state. The ongoing Yemeni civil war also poses a threat to Zabid's heritage. Some historic homes were damaged by coalition bombing in 2015. Further concerns were raised in 2018 as fighting drew near to the city.

Economy
As of 1920, Zabid was one of two places in Arabia growing indigo. Zabid also grows and produces cotton. The British cite tribal disputes as dampening the economy in Zabid during the early 20th century.

Zabid, (en arabe : زبيد), ou Zebid, est une ville de l'ouest du Yémen, au sud de la péninsule arabique, sur la plaine côtière occidentale, à environ 100 km au sud est d'al-Hodeïda. Elle tient son nom du wadi Zabid, la vallée au sud.
Elle est l'une des plus anciennes cités du Yémen, dont elle a été la capitale entre le XIIIe et le XVe siècle. Son université était alors prestigieuse. Elle était une étape importante dans le commerce entre l'Afrique orientale et l'Asie.
La population urbaine est d'environ 23 000 personnes.
Aujourd'hui, cependant, Zabid est à la marge, intellectuellement et économiquement du Yémen moderne.

Histoire
Zabid aurait été fondée par Mohammed Ibn Ziyad en 819. C'est aussi la date de fondation de l'université, et le début de remarquables réalisations académiques en algèbre dans le monde arabe. Zabid a rapidement acquis une réputation de ville de chercheurs. À son apogée, sous les Rassoulides, elle offrait 5 000 places d'étudiants.
C'est jusqu'à aujourd'hui le siège de l'université religieuse des Shâfi'ites, l'une des quatre écoles sunnites de droit.
La vieille ville, médina, conserve ses vieux murs, et leurs quatre portes de la ville restent, et ses maisons étroites. Plus remarquables encore sont à l'ouest la mosquée, et les ruines de l'ancienne université  Al-Bayshiya.
La construction traditionnelle prédominante est à base de briques de boue. Les maisons sont basses, généralement sur un seul niveau. La façade comporte une porte d'entrée et deux fenêtres, et est souvent peinte en blanc de chaux. L'ornementation en stuc et les frises sont fréquentes.

Inscription sur la liste de l'UNESCO
Zabid a été déclarée site du patrimoine mondial par l'Unesco. 
Sa Grande Mosquée occupe une place prépondérante dans la ville. 
Les vestiges de son université peuvent également être visités.
En 2000, Zabid a été inscrite sur la Liste du patrimoine mondial en péril, à la demande du gouvernement yéménite, en raison d'un état de mauvais entretien et de conservation. Selon un rapport de l'Unesco, environ « 40 % des maisons de la ville ont été remplacées par des bâtiments en béton, et d'autres maisons et l'ancien souk sont dans un état de détérioration ».

Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.
Aden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.

Before gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly "Steamer Point"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.
Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.
Aden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.

Etymology
Aden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word "Aden" means resident, and it is said "Aden Al-Balad", meaning the settlement of the country. Among the sayings of geographers about the city:
Yaqut al-Hamwi said: "It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade." And it is added to Abyan, which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.
Ibn Manzur said: "It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen."
Ibn Khaldun said: "This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often."

History
Antiquity
Aden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name (Ancient Greek: Αραβία Εμπόριον, romanised: Arabia Emporion), which means an Arabic trade port. The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as Eudaemon (Ancient Greek: Ευδαίμων, meaning "blissful, prosperous") in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The same work describes Aden as "a village by the shore", which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage. Aden was more an island than a peninsula, as the isthmus (a tombolo) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the Book of Ezekiel, which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:"The merchants of Sheba and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants."At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient Indian Ocean trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Awsan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC. In the beginning of the seventh century BC, Karibʾil Watar I, king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Awsan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of Awsan made offerings to the god Almaqah, according to the inscription that Karibʾil Watar I left in Sirwah, commemorating his victory.
In the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. Aelius Gallus' Roman expedition to Arabia Felix (26–25 BCE) aimed to capture the Sabaean capital of Marib but failed due to extreme desert conditions, disease, and logistical challenges. After an unsuccessful week-long siege, the army, weakened by illness and dehydration, withdrew, losing most of its ~10,000 troops to environmental factors and disease" The Himyarites overthrew the Kingdom of Sheba in 275 AD and took control of Aden. Recent incomplete archaeological studies suggest that the Himyarites were the ones who built the huge water cisterns currently known as the "Cisterns of Aden", which stored approximately 136,382,757 liters of water.
The Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the Sasanian Empire took control of the city in 571 AD.
A local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that Cain and Abel are buried somewhere in the city.

Medieval history
Although the pre-Islamic Himyar civilisation was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the Hadhramaut make it clear that both the Himyar and the Sabean cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians Ibn al Mujawir and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.
With the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD. In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz). It was controlled by the state of Ziyadid and the Sulayhid. After the death of Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi, his son took charge of Zurayids, and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi reduced it. After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids’ preoccupation with the Khawlan tribes. The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids’ control of the city. A major battle took place between Turan Shah bin Ayyub and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz. One of the most important contributors to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in Tihama and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.
After 1175, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since then Aden has been a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from Egypt, Sindh, Gujarat, East Africa and even China. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century. It was visited by the medieval scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century, who described Aden's reservoirs, the Cisterns of Tawila, "These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens."
During the Ayyubid period in Yemen, Sana'a and its environs were more hostile to their presence than other regions. The Zaidi tribes were able to defeat the Ayyubids in 1226, but Omar bin Rasul, the founder of the Rasulid state, was able to repel them, so he tightened his control over Aden. The city regained its position during the days of the Rasulids, so they dug wells and built schools, and Aden flourished commercially. The kings of Bani Rasul were also merchants and enacted a number of laws and regulations to codify trade in the city.
The Banu Tahir were able to control Aden after the Banu Rasool, and the Italian traveller Lodovico di Verthama describes it as one of the most powerful cities seen on Earth during the days of the Tahirids.

In 1513, the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, launched an unsuccessful four-day naval siege of Aden. The Mamluks in Egypt sensed the danger and sent a force led by Hussein al-Kurdi. The victorious King Amer bin Abdul Wahhab provided great aid to the Kurds, but he suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Diu. The Mamluks sent a second fleet, but the victorious king refused to cooperate with the Mamluks because he had succeeded in repelling the Portuguese from Aden without their help. Hussein al-Kurdi became angry and allied with the Zaidi Imam, who was opposed to the Tahirids, al-Mutawakkil Sharaf al-Din, and the Tahirid cities fell successively, with the exception of Aden. The Ottoman Empire took control of the city in 1538. The Ottomans' goal was to prevent the Portuguese from controlling Aden, so the city witnessed difficult days, in addition to the fact that the port of Mocha gained greater importance at the expense of Aden during the sixteenth century. The city's population declined and it turned into a small village with a population of no more than 600 people. While its population was approximately eighty thousand people during the days of the Rasulid state.In 1421, China's Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor ordered principal envoy grand eunuch Li Xing and grand eunuch Zhou Man of Zheng He's fleet to convey an imperial edict with hats and robes to bestow on the king of Aden. The envoys boarded three treasure ships and set sail from Sumatra to the port of Aden. This event was recorded in the book Yingyai Shenglan by Ma Huan who accompanied the imperial envoy.
After Ottoman rule, Aden was ruled by the Sultanate of Lahej, under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the chief rulers on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.

Modern history
The situation was different in the north of the country, where the Zaidis did not recognise the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of Imam Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim, who and his son Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans. The imams relied on the revenues from the port of Mocha, and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan Fadl al-Abdali concluded an alliance with the Yafi tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolise Aden's revenues equally among them. The Sultan of Lahej got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfil his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognise inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq and Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden. The English had been visiting Aden and Mocha from 1609, led by Sir Henry Middleton, who was imprisoned, his ships confiscated, and eight of his men killed.
The British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mocha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for British subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi’ gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars. Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.

British administration 1839–1967
In 1609 The Ascension was the first English ship to visit Aden, before sailing on to Mocha during the fourth voyage of the East India Company.
British interests in Aden began in 1796 with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their privateers were tracked down over the subsequent decade. By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, Somalis, Jews, and Indians—housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity. As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the East India Company officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or Russian expansion through Persia. The emergence of Muhammad Ali of Egypt as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, Sir Robert Grant, was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing "places of strength" to protect the Indian Ocean.
The Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship Hugh Lindsay sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the Cape of Good Hope in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coal supplying station had been found. The British first stationed a coal depot on the island of Socotra in 1834. However, due to the lack of suitable infrastructure there, they quickly lost interest in Socotra and turned towards Aden instead.
In 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km2 (75 sq mi) including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to definitively conquer the territory (the so-called Aden Expedition) and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from Mokha. The port lies about equidistant from the Suez Canal, Bombay, and Zanzibar, which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an entrepôt and a way-station for ships in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish coal and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until November 1967.

Until 1937, Aden was governed as part of British India and was known as the Aden Settlement. Its original territory was enlarged in 1857 by the 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi) island of Perim, in 1868 by the 73 km2 (28 sq mi) Khuriya Muriya Islands, and in 1915 by the 108 km2 (42 sq mi) island of Kamaran. The settlement would become Aden Province in 1935.

In 1937, the settlement was detached from India and became the Colony of Aden, a British Crown colony. The change in government was a step towards the change in the official currency unit. When British India became independent in 1947, Indian rupees (divided into annas) were replaced in Aden by East African shillings. The hinterland of Aden and Hadhramaut were also loosely tied to Britain as the Aden Protectorate, which was overseen from Aden.

Aden's location also made it a useful entrepôt for mail passing between places around the Indian Ocean and Europe. Thus, a ship passing from Suez to Bombay could leave mail for Mombasa at Aden for collection (See Postage stamps and postal history of Aden). In December 1947, a three-day riot broke out in reaction to the drafting of the Partition Plan for Palestine. The riots and their repression by the Aden Protectorate Levies saw the killing of 76-82 Jews, 33 Arabs, 4 Muslim Indians and 1 Somali, in addition to looting and damaging of property. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, the British held on to Aden as an outpost in the region for another decade. The British authorities had already decided to further expand its port shortly before the Suez Canal's 1956 closure.
Aden sent a team of two to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia.

Federation of South Arabia and the Aden Emergency
In order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of North Yemen, the British attempted gradually to unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia (FSA).
An insurgency against British administration known as the Aden Emergency began with a grenade attack by the communist National Liberation Front (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a "state of emergency" was declared.
In 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that British troops would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY (Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen) vied for the upper hand.
In January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an Aden Airways DC3 plane in the air with no survivors.
The increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in From Barren Rocks to Living Stones.
On 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The Royal Marines, who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave – with the exception of a Royal Engineer detachment (10 Airfields Squadron left Aden on 13 December 1967). As part of a larger Royal Navy task force, HMS Albion's helicopters lifted off remaining Royal Marine commandos left to secure the airfield.

Post-independence
The last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and British support ceased. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country's economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.
The new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms. On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership. He was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year, and faced new rebellions from leftist parties in July, August and December 1968. This is because all Arab countries welcomed the front. National Liberation received a cold reception. Regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, where the leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan. They wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.

Qahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on 16 June 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to place him under house arrest on 22 June. A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. This group took an extreme leftist line, declaring its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution, and strengthening its relationship with the Soviet Union. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalised foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist–Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established. The port of Aden was the largest source of national income for the Republic of South Yemen, but the closure of the Suez Canal by Egypt between 1967 and 1975 - reduced commercial activities in the port.
Salem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and made attempts to restore normal relations with Western countries. During his presidency, relations between South Yemen and Saudi Arabia were established in 1976. President Salmin, as he is known, coveted more Soviet support, so the contract with Saudi Arabia worried him. The Soviets pushed them to increase aid, but relations with Saudi Arabia became strained again in 1977 following the assassination of North Yemeni President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. It is believed that Salem Rabie Ali orchestrated the assassination of Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi in revenge for Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Salem Rabie Ali was subjected to a quick trial that ended with his execution and Abdel Fattah Ismail assuming the presidency of South Yemen. Relations with North Yemen became tense, due to Fattah's support for the factions opposing Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was more fanatical than his predecessors. Relations with the Soviet Union became active in an unprecedented way, so the Front War broke out in 1978, in which the Soviet Union and the United States intervened.
Ali Nasser Muhammad was able to force Abd al-Fattah Ismail al-Jawfi to resign for "health reasons", and Ismail was exiled to Moscow two years after he assumed the presidency. Despite the approach of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and its removal of tribal aspects, tribalism remained alive among politicians and the public despite the exposure of its sheikhs. Tribes from their authorities. Tribal and regional favouritism and nepotism remained rife in southern Yemen, as political forces called on their tribal and regional affiliations during crises.

By January 1986, Aden was torn apart by the rivalry of two factions in the ruling Socialist Party, when President Ali Nasser Muhammad's guards launched a surprise attack on the political party's office in Aden on January 13, 1986. This was the beginning of the 1986 civil war in South Yemen. The basis of the war was regional. Ali Nasser Muhammad was from Abyan Governorate, while most of those killed in the political party office were from Al-Dhalea and Lahj. Military brigades from those areas bombed Aden from land and sea, forcing Ali Nasser Muhammad to flee and hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers to flee to northern Yemen, including Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. This was followed by systematic killings and liquidations against the people of Abyan Governorate, on charges that they were collaborating with Ali Nasser Muhammad. Nearly ten thousand people were killed and thousands migrated towards North Yemen, most of whom were from Abyan and Shabwa.
With the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of Aden Governorate which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.
On 29 December 1992, Al Qaeda conducted its first known terrorist attack in Aden, bombing the Gold Mohur Hotel, where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. A Yemeni and an Austrian tourist died in the attack.

That war marked the end of the state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas assumed the presidency until May 22, 1990, the unity of South Yemen with North Yemen, and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. At that time, Ali Salem Al-Baidh was considered Ali Abdullah Saleh's deputy, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas was considered prime minister, and after the 1993 elections. Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed. The southern forces, which were transferred to Amran, clashed with the northern forces there, and the forces of the northern giants, which were transferred to Amran, clashed. Abyan with the southern forces, and the political parties signed the 1994 Covenant and Agreement, in the Jordanian capital, on February 20, 1994, in an attempt to end the crisis, and successive events led to the outbreak of the Summer 1994 civil war, and the southern military leaders who fled after the events of 1986 joined the ranks of the forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and supported the Unity Army in the war against their former comrades in 1994 in the war against the separatists. At the forefront of these emerged a group of the brightest officers, such as President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who became Minister of Defense at the time, the former Chief of Staff, Major General Abdullah Aliwa, and Major General Salem Qatan, who was assassinated by an Al-Qaeda gunman. After the war, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi was appointed Vice President of the Republic, and remained in office. He held his position until 2012, when he was elected president of the country.
Members of al Qaeda attempted to bomb the US guided-missile destroyer The Sullivans at the port of Aden as part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The boat that had the explosives in it sank, forcing the planned attack to be aborted.
The bombing attack on destroyer USS Cole took place in Aden on 12 October 2000.
In 2007 growing dissatisfaction with unification led to the formation of the secessionist South Yemen Movement. According to The New York Times, the Movement's mainly underground leadership includes socialists, Islamists and individuals desiring a return to the perceived benefits of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.

Temporary capital and civil war
Aden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana’a, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2014, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, "All decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy."
President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the coup d'état that many consider to be the start of the Yemeni civil war. Others consider that the civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sana'a, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government.
Hadi declared in Aden that he was still Yemen's legitimate president and called on state institutions and loyal officials to relocate to Aden. In a televised speech on 21 March 2015, he declared Aden to be Yemen's "economic and temporary capital" while Sana'a is controlled by the Houthis.
Aden was hit by violence in the aftermath of the coup d'état, with forces loyal to Hadi clashing with those loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in a battle for Aden International Airport on 19 March 2015. After the airport battle, the entire city became a battleground for the Battle of Aden, which left large parts of the city in ruins and has killed at least 198 people since 25 March 2015.
Some Arab and foreign embassies were transferred to Aden, and Defense Minister Mahmoud Al-Subaihi was able to leave Sanaa for Aden and met with President Hadi. On March 4, 2016, unidentified gunmen stormed the Mother Teresa House in the city and killed sixteen people, including four nuns. A number of the old city's churches have also been destroyed by Islamic extremists since mid-2015.
On 14 July 2015, the Saudi Arabian Army launched an offensive to win control of the city. Within three days, the city was cleared of Houthi rebels, ending the Battle of Aden with a coalition victory.
Beginning on 28 January 2018, separatists loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in a coup d'état against the Hadi-led government.
On 30 December 2020, the undersecretary of labour and deputy minister of public works were killed along with between 20 and 30 others at the Aden airport while they conducted an international press briefing about their new arrangements with the STC, which includes the partition of forces inside Aden, as they returned from hiding in the Saudi capital. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, his ministers and his entourage were conducted to safety under the barrage of hostile fire.

Culture
Dialects
The entry of the Yemenis into Islam contributed to their abandoning their ancient script and replacing it with the late Nabataean alphabet in which the Qur’an was written. Today, Yemenis speak Arabic in the Yemeni dialect, which is a developed dialect and closely linked to the ancient language. It has three dialects with branches: the Sanani dialect, the Hadrami dialect, and the Taizi-Adeni dialect, in addition to the Bedouin dialect of the residents of Marib. Al-Jawf, Shabwa, and Inner Hadhramaut, and each of these dialects has characteristics and features.

Music and poetry
Adeni art or the Adeniyat is an art of Arabic music. Among the ancient artists of Aden are Iskander Thabet Saleh and Muhammad Murshid Naji, and among the poets are Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Muhammad, Ahmed Ghaleb Muhammad Al-Jabri, Abdullah Abdul Karim Muhammad, Ali Abdullah Jaafar Aman, Farid Muhammad Barakat, Lotfi Jaafar Aman, and Mohsen Ali Brik.
"Adeni music" played a major role in Aden society, and artists in the Aden dialect were called "al-Mutariba", meaning people of music. Adeni music began in 1920 when the army of the Aden Protectorate was formed, and after it the National Guard, where there were teams for those forces and those teams participated On special occasions and weddings.

Sports
Pre-independence
The first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee’ neighbourhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the "Recreational Club United" in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name "Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club", as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.
In 1924, the "Al-Husseini Sports Club" was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name "Al-Bamboot Club" and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933, the "Nujoom Al-Layl Club", Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the "Al-Ittihad Al-Islami Club" (Al-Mawlada) appeared.
Until that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the "Adeniya Sports Association", after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, Bernard Reilly, as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.
This association began holding the first club tournament, which was the "Rosario Cup Championship". Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.
Among the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.

Post-independence
After independence, the "Football Federation" was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the "Adeniya Sports Association". The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in Crater, under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.
In the "First General Sports Conference" in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicisation of the clubs in favour of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.
On July 18, 1975, the "Al-Tilal Sports Club" appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the "Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club", which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the "Yemeni Football Federation" appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the "September 26 Cup Competition" in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana’a, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.
Football is the most popular sport in Aden. There are 9 stadiums in Aden, including the May 22 International Stadium, and 10 sports clubs. In November 2010, Aden hosted the 2010 Arabian Gulf Football Cup.

Tourist sites
Aden has several historical and natural sites of interest to visitors. These include:

The historical British churches, one of which lies empty and semi-derelict in 2019.
The Zoroastrian Temple
The Cisterns of Tawila—an ancient water-catchment system located in the sub-centre of Crater
Sira Fortress
The Aden Minaret
Little Ben, a miniature Big Ben Clock Tower overlooking Steamer Point. Built during the colonial period, this was restored in 2012 after 3 decades of neglect since the British withdrawal of 1967.
The Landing Pier at Steamer Point is a 19th-century building used by visiting dignitaries during the colonial period, most notably Queen Elizabeth during her 1954 visit to the colony. This building was hit by an airstrike in 2015 and is currently in the process of being restored in 2019.
The Crescent Hotel which contained a number of artifacts relating to the Royal Visit of 1954 and which currently remains derelict as a result of a recent airstrike.
The Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej/National Museum—The National Museum was founded in 1966 and is located in what used to be the Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej. Northern forces robbed it during the 1994 Civil War, but its collection of pieces remains one of the biggest in Yemen.
The Aden Military Museum which features a painting depicting the 20 June 1967 ambush by Arab Police Barracks on a British Army unit when a number of the 22 soldiers killed that day were driving in two Land Rovers on Queen Arwa Road, Crater.
The Rimbaud House, which opened in 1991, is the two-story house of French poet Arthur Rimbaud who lived in Aden from 1880 to 1891. Rimbaud moved to Aden on his way to Ethiopia in an attempt for a new life. As of the late 1990s, the first floor of the house belonged to the French Consulate, a cultural centre and a library. The house is located in al-Tawahi—the European Quarter of Aden—and is politically and culturally debated for its French nature in an area previously colonised by Britain.
The fortifications of Jebal Hadid and Jebal Shamsan
The beaches of Aden and Little Aden—Some of the popular beaches in Aden consist of Lover's Bay Beach, Elephant Beach and Gold Beach. The popular beach in Little Aden is called Blue Beach. Some beaches are private and some are public, which is subject to change over time due to the changing resort industry. According to the Wall Street Journal, kidnappings on the beaches and the threat of Al Qaeda has caused problems for the resort industry in Aden, which used to be popular among locals and Westerners.
Al-Aidaroos Mosque
Main Pass – now called Al-Aqba Road is the only road into Aden through Crater. Originally an Arched Upper bridge known as Main Gate, it overlooked Aden city and was built during the Ottoman Empire. A painted crest of the 24th British army battalion is still visible on the brickwork adjacent to the Gate site and is believed to be the only remaining army Crest from colonial rule still visible in Aden. In March 1963 the bridge was removed by a British Army controlled explosion to widen the 2 lane roadway to the present 4 lane highway and the only reminder of this bridge is a quarter scale replica built at the end of the Al-Aqba road intersection known as the AdenGate Model roundabout.

Economy and transportation
The industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a centre to supply ships with fuel.
Historically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial centre for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.

Transport
Historically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations centre. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernisation and built Aden International Airport, known today, next to the military airport. Al-Yamda Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the Battle of Aden Airport and the 2015 military intervention in Yemen closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.  On 22 July, Aden International Airport was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months. The same day, a ship chartered by the World Food Programme carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.
Historically, Aden's harbour has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was 13 by 6 km (8 by 4 mi) in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called Tawahi.
During the British colonial period motor vehicles drove on the left, as in the United Kingdom. On 2 January 1977, Aden, along with the rest of South Yemen, changed to driving on the right, bringing it into line with neighbouring Arab states.
During the early 20th century, Aden was a prominent export centre for coffee grown in the Jubail highlands. And also to export frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa and millet, which are produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stems of clover, millet, and corn produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. Beginning in 1920, Aden was desalinating seawater to produce table salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced more than 120,000 tons of salt. Aden also produced potash, which was exported to Mumbai.

Economy
Historically, Aden would import goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, the British described it as "the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports." At the docks, the city provided coal to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was salt. Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the Bab-el-Mandeb; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. Yemen Airlines, the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden. On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with Yemenia.
During the early 20th century Aden was a notable centre of coffee production. Women processed coffee beans, grown in the Yemen highlands. Frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and millet was also produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stalks of the alfalfa, millet and maize produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. As of 1920, Aden was also gathering salt from salt water. An Italian company called Agostino Burgarella Ajola and Company gathered and process the salt under the name Aden Salt Works. There was also a smaller company from India, called Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalji & Company that owned a salt production firm in Aden. Both companies exported the salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced over 120,000 tons of salt. Aden has also produced potash, which was generally exported to Mumbai.
Aden produced jollyboats. Charcoal was produced as well, from acacia, and mainly in the interior of the region. Cigarettes were produced by Jewish and Greek populations in Aden. The tobacco used was imported from Egypt.
Since the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War spread to Aden in 2015, the city has been struck by constant protests over a range of issues, but especially concerning electricity generation. Aden's power grid is composed solely of diesel generators and is thus heavily dependent on imported fuel. The main power plant is al-Hasswa diesel power plant, which in June 2021 had only two turbines out of five running, producing up to 50 megawatts (MW) of power in a region where the deficit hovers around 300 MW. Nawfal al-Mojamal, the plant director, said "In its 35 years of existence, al-Hasswa station never had any kind of maintenance, except in 2016 ... when the two turbines were restored".

Free zone
The free zone, which was opened in 1991, represents Yemen's economic gateway and the meeting point of the continents of Asia and Africa. The free zone gains its strategic importance from the special location of the port of Aden, as it is located directly on the main trade route around the world and from the Middle East to Europe and America, and is distinguished by the possibility of providing transit services. To East Africa, the Red Sea, the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Gulf. The free zone represents a storage and distribution area suitable for Africa, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.

Geography and climate
Geography
Aden is located on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, and is about 363 kilometres away from the capital, Sana’a. It is located between latitudes 47 and 12 north of the equator, and at an altitude of 6 metres above sea level.

Landforms
The city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.
The surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.

Offshore islands
There are about 21 islands around the peninsulas of Aden, Aden Lesser, and Ras Amran. They are mostly rocky islands, some of which are surrounded by incomplete coral reefs, and most of them are considered fishing areas. A number of islands have many activities, especially on Al-Ummal Island and Sirah Island.

Wild and domestic animal diversity
Yemen is considered one of the countries rich in bird species in the Middle East due to the availability of many suitable coastal environments that helped attract many migratory birds to wetland sites, coasts and islands. The Aden region (Khor Maksar - Al-Haswah) was registered on the list of important areas of the World Bird Organization as a habitat. The last three species that are globally threatened with extinction are: the great eagle, the gull eagle, and the eastern king eagle.
There are dozens of bird species recorded in the wetlands of Aden and the Caltex swamp area, which are rich in a wide variety of endemic and migratory birds, including birds that are present throughout the year. There are many birds in the area, including great flamingos, dwarf flamingos, and rock egrets. And the spoonbill, the hooked tern and the seagull.

In June 2015, the International Red Cross team present in conflict areas in Yemen during the events of the Yemeni civil war announced that the cities of Crater, Al-Mualla, Khor Maksar and Al-Tawahi in the Aden Governorate in the south of the country were areas affected by dengue fever. The health authorities in Aden said that this fever had spread remarkably and widely. Since the beginning of May, health services have deteriorated and infrastructure facilities, such as electricity, water, and sanitation, have been damaged as a result of the ongoing fighting in the city for months.

Mail
Aden has known mail since June 15, 1839, that is, a year after the British occupation, although the official post office was not inaugurated until 1857. Postage stamps of both Britain and India were used in Aden until it became called the Aden Colony on April 1, 1937, although the stamps of this stage It bears no distinctive sign, but the use of the number 124 as a postal code is attributed to Aden as part of the Indian postal numerical system.
Then, when it became a colony in 1937, it had sets of postage stamps containing pictures and the name Aden printed on them. In 1939, a new postage set was issued containing a picture of King George VI, but the Sultans of Hadhramaut - who were under the umbrella of the Aden Protectorate - controlled Britain has had it since the 1880s - they refused to do so, and so Britain issued a separate postal set in 1942, but this time with the inclusion of a phrase and pictures expressing the Kathiri Sultanate in Sayun and the Qu’aiti Sultanate in Shihr and Mukalla, in addition to pictures of the sultans.

Media
Journalism
The weekly Al-Amal newspaper was founded in 1957 in Aden. Its slogan was (Freedom, Bread, and Peace). The British authorities allowed only 1,500 copies to be printed weekly, and the newspaper was banned shortly after.
In 1958, Al-Ayyam newspaper was established in Aden, as an independent daily newspaper in the Arabic language, during the British occupation. The first issue was published on July 30, 1958, and its founder and editor-in-chief was Brigadier General Muhammad Ali Bashraheel. It stopped publishing after independence during the era of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and then resumed publication. After achieving Yemeni unity, the first issue of the second edition was on November 7, 1990, after a hiatus that lasted more than 23 years. In 1998, Al-Ayyam was the first newspaper in Yemen that the government prosecuted under a criminal law. Other cases followed until it became public by the end of the year. 2008, responsible for 73% of the total number of cases filed by the Ministry of Information and the Yemeni government against the press in Yemen. When the protests and clashes intensified in Aden in April 2009, "Al-Ayyam covered the events extensively, and pictures of blood and injuries were on the cover of the newspaper for days." President Ali Abdullah Saleh sent delegations to the newspaper, asking them to reduce the severity of their coverage, and to stop using pictures of the injured and bleeding blood. On May 12, 2009, security forces launched an attack on the headquarters of Al-Ayyam newspaper in Aden.

Radio and television
Radio Aden was established on August 17, 1954, under the name "Aden Radio Station". It is currently broadcast in two periods, morning and evening. The British occupation opened the Aden Channel on September 11, 1964, following the revolution of October 14, 1963. Television transmission was limited to covering populated neighbourhoods in the city of Aden, especially where soldiers and families of the British forces were present. In January 1979, the television headquarters moved to the "Radio and Television Building" in Tawahi. Which was prepared, and at that time the broadcast was in black and white, and in March 1981 the gradual transition to colour broadcasting began, and in June 1981 the channel began broadcasting via satellite. After the Yemeni unification on May 22, 1990, Aden Channel was the second official channel of Yemeni TV.

عَدَن هي مدينة يمنية تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمة الاقتصادية لليمن، وثاني أهم مدينة يمنية بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن أحداثاً تاريخية هامة، وعرفت بأنها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمة حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمة، مما يجعلها واحدة من أكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظة عدن ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر أهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الأحمر، وتشكل عدن أنموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الإنتاجي، إذ جمعت بين الأنشطة الصناعية والسمكية والتجارية والسياحية والخدمية، وتنبع أهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من أهم الموانئ في المنطقة، ومنطقة تجارة حرة إقليمية ودولية. تكتسب المدينة أهميتها السياحية من شواطئها الدافئة ومنتجعاتها الجميلة، وتكتسب الصناعة مقوماتها من مجموعة مصانع ووحدات إنتاجية أهمها «مصفاة عدن». تتكون عدن من عدة مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصورة، دار سعد، البريقة.
ورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كأحد المدن ذات العلاقة التجارية مع صور اللبنانية كون عدن كانت أحد المحطات المهمة لتجارة التوابل التي انتعشت لمدة ألفية كاملة. كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. وكانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة،  وشن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون إسقاط مملكة سبأ عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الإمبراطورية الساسانية على عدن في 671 للميلاد.
بدخول الإسلام إلى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الإسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226، إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدولة الطاهرية وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياماً عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخاء اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.
احتلت بريطانيا مدينة عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. وخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، أصبحت عدن أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963،  أعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز. وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير بقيادة قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الإنجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية برئاسة قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمة للدولة.
قامت الحركة التصحيحية باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وأدخلت العامل الأيديولوجي الماركسي في جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية وغيّرت اسمها إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وبدأوا بتأميم قطاعات واسعة من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القادة الشباب الجدد أول خطة خمسية لجميع المحافظات الجنوبية. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي أدت لاندلاع الحرب الأهلية في 1986.
وقُصِفت مدينة عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحدة اليمنية واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد أربعة سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكومية السيطرة على المدينة، أعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمة. وظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  التي أعلن الرئيس هادي أنها عاصمة مؤقتة لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. إلا أن هذا القرار لم يكن سوى إعلانًا رمزيًا حيث أن تغيير العاصمة في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على أن الأخيرة لا تزال هي العاصمة.

التسمية
عدن هي موطن ومقام للسفن وكلمة عدن تعني أقام بالمكان فكلمة «عادن» تعني مقيم ويقال «عدن البلد» أي توطن البلد.، ومن أقوال الجغرافيين عن المدينة:

قال ياقوت الحموي: «هي مدينة مشهورة على ساحل بحر الهند من ناحية اليمن ردئة لا ماء بها ولا مرعى وشربهم من عين بينها وبين عدن مسيرة نحو اليوم وهو مع ذلك ردئ إلا أن هذا الموضع هو مرفأ مراكب الهند والتجار يجتمعون إليه لأجل ذلك فإنها بلدة تجارة، وتضاف إلى أبين وهو مخلاف عدن من جملته.»
قال ابن منظور:«هي بلد على سيف البحر في أقصى بلاد اليمن.»
قال ابن خلدون:«وعدن هذه من أمنع مدائن اليمن وهي على ضفة البحر الهندي وما زالت بلد تجارة من عهد التبابعة وأكثر بنائهم بالأخصاص ولذلك يطرقها تجار الحرير كثيراً.»
وعن باب عدن قال الهمداني:«وهو شصر مقطوع في جبل كان محيطاً بموضع عدن من الساحل فلم يكن لها طريق إلى البر إلا للرّجل لمن ركب ظهر الجبل فقطع في الجبل باب مبلغ عرض الجبل حتى سلكه الدواب والجمال والمحامل والمحفات.»

التاريخ
التاريخ القديم
عدن ميناء قديم وذكرها اليونان باسم (يونانية:Αραβία Εμπόριον - Arabia Emporion) وتعني ميناء تجارة العربية وذكرت عدن صراحة باسمها هذا في سفر حزقيال الذي يتحدث عن أورشليم وجاء فيه: 

كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذا شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. كانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة من القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م  في بدايات القرن السابع ق.م، شن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان قُتل خلالها وفق النصوص السبئية ستة عشر ألف قتيل وتم استعباد أربعين ألف نسمة وتقديم ملوك أوسان قرابين للإله إيل مقه وفقا للكتابة التي كربئيل وتر الأول تركها في صرواح مخلداً فيها انتصاره.
في النصف الثاني من القرن الأول ق.م، عزم الإمبراطور الروماني أغسطس قيصر السيطرة على العربية السعيدة وبلوغ المحيط الهندي. وأُرسل حاكم مصر الروماني أيليوس غالوس عام 25 ق.م وانتهت الحملة بنتائج كارثية وفناء الجيش الروماني أمام أسوار مأرب. أسقط الحِميَّريون مملكة سبأ عام 275 للميلاد وسيطروا على عدن. دراسات أثرية حديثة غير مكتملة، ترجح أن الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمة المعروفة حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابة 136,382,757 لتر من الماء.
سقطت مملكة حمير في الربع الأول من القرن السادس قبل الميلاد وذكر يوسف ذو نواس باب المندب في إحدى كتاباته فقد كانت قوات مملكة أكسوم تدخل اليمن من خلاله، أرسل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول أسطولاً لقتال اليهود الحِميَّريين ودعم مملكة أكسوم ومسيحيي نجران، دخل الأسطول عن طريق عدن. تشير المصادر البيزنطية أن الإمبراطورية الساسانية سيطرت على المدينة عام 671 للميلاد.

التاريخ الوسيط
مع دخول الإسلام إلى اليمن في القرن السابع الميلادي، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. كانت عدن في سنين الإسلام الأولى تتبع مخلاف الجند (تعز) سيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد والصليحيون وبعد وفاة علي بن محمد الصليحي قام ابنه المكرم بتولية بنو زريع واستمرت عدن بتأدية الإتاوة السنوية حتى خفضتها الملكة أروى بنت أحمد الصليحي. عقب سقوط الدولة الصليحية استقل بنو زريع بعدن مستغلين انشغال الصليحيين بقبائل خولان. استمر الزريعيون بحكم عدن ولحج وأبين لأقل من أربعين سنة حتى سقطوا بسيطرة الأيوبيين على المدينة. دارت معركة كبيرة بين توران شاه بن أيوب وياسر بن بلال المحمدي وزير الدولة الزريعية وهزم الزريعيون وهرب المحمدي إلى تعز. من أهم الأسباب التي ساهمت في هزيمة الزريعيين كانت حروبهم المتواصلة مع بني مهدي في تهامة وخروج جيشهم لملاقاة الأيوبيين عوضا عن التحصن في عدن.
خلال فترة الأيوبيين في اليمن، كانت صنعاء وما يجاورها أكثر رفضا لوجودهم من سواها من المناطق. تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226 إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجاريا. فقد كان ملوك بني رسول تجاراً كذلك وسنّوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة.
تمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودوفيكو دي فيرثاما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين.

بدأ البرتغاليون بالتوسع في المحيط الهندي وبحلول العام 1498 م أدركوا أن عدن مفتاحهم لدخول البحر الأحمر. فاستشعر المماليك في مصر الخطر وأرسلوا قوة بقيادة حسين الكردي، قدم الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب مساعدات كبيرة للكردي ولكنه تعرض لهزيمة فادحة في معركة ديو. أرسل المماليك أسطولا ثانيا ولكن الملك الظافر رفض التعاون مع المماليك كونه نجح في صد البرتغاليين عن عدن دون عون منهم. غضب حسين الكردي وتحالف مع الإمام الزيدي المناوئ للطاهريين المتوكل شرف الدين وسقطت مدن الطاهريين تباعا باستثناء عدن. سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصبا على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياما عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخا اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.

التاريخ الحديث
كانت الأوضاع مختلفة في شمال البلاد، حيث لم يعترف الزيدية بسلطة العثمانيين وثاروا مرات عديدة ضدهم آخرها ثورة الإمام المنصور بالله القاسم بن محمد بن القاسم الذي تمكن وابنه المؤيد بالله محمد توحيد القبائل وطرد العثمانيين. اعتمد الأئمة على مداخيل ميناء المخا ولم تكن عدن بتلك الأهمية التي ولي عليها العبادلة. على أواخر القرن الثامن عشر، عقد السلطان فضل العبدلي حلفا مع قبائل يافع على التمرد على الأئمة الزيدية واحتكار مداخيل عدن بينهم مناصفة. تخلص سلطان لحج من الأئمة ولكنه لم يف بوعده ليافع. كان الأئمة الزيدية لا يعترفون بالتوريث ويرون القتال لأجل الإمامة فطالت الحرب بين الناصر محمد بن إسحاق والمنصور الحسين بن المتوكل فانتهز العبدلي الفرصة ليعلن استقلاله بلحج وعدن. كان الإنجليز يزورون عدن والمخا من عام 1609 بقيادة السير هنري ميدلتون الذي سُجن وصودرت سفنه وقتل ثمانية من رجاله.
حاول الإنجليز عقد معاهدات مع الأئمة الزيدية عقب إخراج العثمانيين من عدن، فزاروا صنعاء والمخا ولكنهم عاملوا سفير الإنجليز معاملة سيئة ورفضوا عرضه. كانت الأمور مختلفة عندما استقل العبادلة بلحج والمدينة، فوقعوا معاهدة مع الإنجليز عام 1802 تقضي ببنائهم مصنعا في كريتر وخصص مقبرة خاصة للرعايا الإنجليز مجاناَ، كان العبدلي يريد الحماية الإنجليزية من القبائل. قُتل السلطان فضل بن علي من قبل مسلحي يافع ثم غزا أحد مشايخ الحجرية لحج وحاصرها لخمسة أشهر وحاصرها العوالق كذلك بثمانية آلاف مقاتل ولم يغادروا إلا بعد أن دفع لهم السلطان أحمد بن عبد الكريم سبعة آلاف دولار. ثم هاجم آل فضل عدن سنة 1836.

الاحتلال البريطاني
أحكمت الإمبراطورية البريطانية سيطرتها على المدينة في يناير 1839، بسبعمائة من المشاة وقتلت 150 من المقاومة العدنية. ووفقاً للرواية الإنجليزية، فإن باخرة هندية تابعة لبريطانيا حطت رحالها في عدن عام 1837، فهاجمها عرب من عدن وسرقوا كل ما بداخلها. فقام الكابتن «ستافورد هاينز» بزيارة عدن في 28 ديسمبر من نفس السنة، وألتقى بسلطان لحج الذي نفى أي علاقة له بالحادثة، ولكن الكابتن هاينز لم يصدقه كونه رأى بضاعة السفينة تباع علناً في سوق المدينة، وفقا للرواية الإنجليزية. فطالب الإنجليز السلطان بدفع تعويضات قدرها 12,000 دولار دفع منها السلطان 7,808 على أن يعيد الباقي خلال سنة وأن يتخلى عن عدن للإنجليز مقابل معاش سنوي قدره 8,700 دولار،  إلا إن ابن السلطان العبدلي رفض المعاهدة، وقاتل الإنجليز فنزل الكابتن سميث بسبعمائة من المشاة محذراً ابن السلطان مطالباً إياه بالالتزام بالمعاهدة، فرفض السلطان وقُتل من الإنجليز خمسة عشر جنديا مقابل 150 عدني وكان عدد سكان المدينة حينها لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة.

حاول العبادلة وآل فضل عام 1841 مهاجمة الإنجليز في عدن بقوة تعدادها خمسة آلاف مقاتل، تصدى الإنجليز لها وخسرت القبائل مئتي رجل وتراجعوا. أعلن الكابتن ستافورد هاينز عدن منطقة حرة. فانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود، واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود، واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. عام 1872، عاد العثمانيون إلى شمال اليمن وأسسوا ولاية اليمن وقسموها لأربع ألوية لواء صنعاء، لواء تعز، لواء عسير، ولواء الحديدة ولم يعترف العثمانيون بسلطة الإنجليز في الجنوب فسيطروا على الضالع التي فر سلطانها إلى عدن طالباً العون من الإنجليز. فسيطر الإنجليز على الضالع وأجبروا العثمانيين على ترسيم الحدود، وذلك الترسيم هو ما قسم اليمن إلى «شمال» و«جنوب»،  وتذكر المصادر البريطانية أن العرب لم يهتموا بهذا الخط الفاصل تلك الأيام،  وكان الأئمة الزيدية يقاتلون العثمانيين دون توقف، فأُنهك العثمانيون وتمكن الإمام يحيى حميد الدين إجبارهم على الاستسلام. ودعا الإمام يحيى القبائل المحمية من الإنجليز للوحدة، فعمد الإنجليز لتبني سياسات أكثر صرامة لحماية مصالحهم وعززوا من المشاعر الانفصالية.
خلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، كانت عدن قد أصبحت أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وكانت عدن جزءاً من الهند البريطانية إلى أن أصبحت مستعمرة عام 1937. وبحلول الخمسينيات أدرك الإنجليز أنهم لن يستطيعوا الاستمرار بإدارة عدن مباشرة، ففكروا بإقامة كيان بعيد عن موجة القومية العربية التي اجتاحت المنطقة، فأقاموا ما أسموه اتحاد إمارات الجنوب العربي، وهو اتحاد فيدرالي يشمل المحميات الغربية حول عدن ولكنه فشل لافتقار المشيخات للخبرة في الحكم،  وعارضت سلطنة لحج الاتحاد وكان هناك خلاف بين السلاطين عن هوية رئيسه.

وبالإضافة لرفض السلطنة الكثيرية والسلطنة القعيطية التي كانتا تسيطران على حضرموت وسلطان سلطنة المهرة إقامة حكم اتحادي يجمعهم، ورفض النخبة الاجتماعية المتعلمة التي كانت مسيطرة على عدن الاتحاد مع المشيخات التي اعتبروها متخلفة وأمية إلى حد كبير. بينما كانت المشيخات تخشى إسقاطها في أسوأ السيناريوهات أو نفوذ سياسي محدود بهيمنة النخبة العدنية.
ففشل الاتحاد وأقام الإنجليز اتحاد الجنوب العربي، ولم يستمر لاشتعال ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963. اندلعت ثورة أكتوبر بسبب قتل البريطانيين لسبعة مواطنين من ردفان، وتأثراً بثورة 26 سبتمبر، وظهرت حركات مقاومة مثل جبهة التحرير القومية المدعومة من الجيش المصري، وأعلنت حالة الطوارئ (إنجليزية: Aden Emergency) في 10 ديسمبر 1963، عندما ألقى عناصر من جبهة التحرير القومية قنبلة أدت إلى مقتل المندوب البريطاني السامي. فأعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968، وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سمي ب«ًا لمقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز.

بعد الاستقلال
خرج آخر جندي بريطاني من عدن في 30 نوفمبر 1967، وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير اليد العليا على حساب جبهة تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل التي انقسم أعضائها ما بين منضم للجبهة القومية أو الرحيل لشمال اليمن، فرحل عبد الله الأصنج ومحمد باسندوة لشمال اليمن. تولى قحطان الشعبي رئاسة الدولة الجديدة وتم ضم مشيخات المحمية الشرقية في حضرموت والمهرة إلى الدولة الجديدة. تولى الشعبي دولة جديدة باقتصاد منهار، فغادر العمال المدنيين ورجال الأعمال وتوقف الدعم الإنجليزي وكان لإغلاق قناة السويس عام 1967 دوراً هاماً في اقتصاد الدولة فقد قلل عدد السفن العابرة لعدن بنسبة 75%.
قسمت الدولة الجديدة لست محافظات في 11 ديسمبر 1967، وذلك لإنهاء لمظاهر القبلية في الدولة وتجاهل الحدود القبلية بين المشيخات البائدة. وفي 20 مارس 1968 عزل قحطان كل القيادات اليسارية من الحكومة وعضوية الحزب وتمكن من إخماد تمرد قادته فصائل يسارية في الجيش من شهر مايو نفس العام، وواجه تمردات جديدة من اطراف يسارية في شهور يوليو، أغسطس وديسمبر من 1968. ذلك أن كل الدول العربية استقبلت الجبهة القومية للتحرير استقبالاً بارداً، فأنظمة مثل مصر أرادوا دمج الجبهة القومية مع جبهة تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل،  حيث كان القسم اليساري أكثر عدداً من أنصار قحطان الشعبي، وأراد هؤلاء نظاما يقود الجموع ويواجه التحديات الكبيرة التي تواجه الدولة الجديدة أهمها إفلاس الخزينة.
قام قحطان الشعبي بفصل وزير الداخلية محمد علي هيثم في 16 يونيو 1969، ولكن الأخير بعلاقاته مع القبائل والجيش، أعاد تجميع القوى اليسارية التي فرقها الرئيس قحطان الشعبي، وتمكنوا من اعتقاله ووضعه رهن الإقامة الجبرية في 22 يونيو من نفس العام،  وشُكِّلَت لجنة رئاسية من خمسة أشخاص، سالم رُبيِّع علي الذي أصبح رئيساً ومحمد صالح العولقي وعلي عنتر وعبد الفتاح إسماعيل ومحمد علي هيثم الذي أصبح رئيسا للوزراء. واتخذت هذه المجموعة خطاً يسارياً متطرفاً، فأعلنت تأييدها للفلسطينيين ولثورة ظفار وقوت علاقتها مع الاتحاد السوفيتي، فقطعت ألمانيا الغربية علاقتها بالدولة لاعترافها بألمانيا الشرقية وقطعت الولايات المتحدة علاقتها كذلك في أكتوبر عام 1969، وقامت القوى الجديدة بإصدار دستور جديد، تأميم البنوك الأجنبية وشركات التأمين وغيروا اسم الدولة إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية تماشيا مع منهج الماركسية اللينينية الذي انتهجوه. وتم تأسيس اقتصاد مخطط مركزيا. وكان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، ولكن إغلاق قناة السويس من قبل إسرائيل - عندما ضربت سفينة داخل المياه المصرية الإقليمية - قلل من النشاطات التجارية في الميناء.
أراد سالم ربيع علي تبنّي منهجا عملياً، فتواصل مع رئيس اليمن الشمالي إبراهيم الحمدي وكان يريد علاقات طبيعية مع الدول الغربية، وفي عهده تأسست العلاقات بين اليمن الجنوبي والسعودية عام 1976،  كان الرئيس سالمين كما يُعرف، يطمع لمزيد من الدعم السوفييتي فعقد العلاقات مع السعودية أقلق السوفييت ودفعهم لزيادة المساعدات ولكن العلاقات مع السعودية توترت من جديد عام 1977 عقب اغتيال رئيس اليمن الشمالي إبراهيم الحمدي،  ويُعتقد أن سالم ربيع علي دبر عملية اغتيال أحمد حسين الغشمي انتقاماً لإبراهيم الحمدي. فخضع سالم ربيع علي لمحاكمة سريعة انتهت بإعدامه وتولي عبد الفتاح إسماعيل رئاسة اليمن الجنوبي. وتوترت العلاقات مع شمال اليمن، بسبب دعم فتاح للفصائل المعارضة لعلي عبد الله صالح وكان أكثر تعصباً ممن سبقه ونشطت العلاقات مع الاتحاد السوفيتي على نحو غير مسبوق، فقامت حرب الجبهة عام 1978 تدخل فيها الاتحاد السوفيتي والولايات المتحدة.

تمكن علي ناصر محمد من إجبار عبد الفتاح إسماعيل الجوفي على الاستقالة لـ«أسباب صحية» ونفي إسماعيل إلى موسكو بعد أقل من سنتين على توليه الرئاسة،  رغم منهج جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وإزالتها للمظاهر القبلية، إلا أن القبيلة بقيت حية في السياسيين والعامة رغم تعرية مشايخ القبائل من سلطاتهم، فالمحاباة والمحسوبية القبلية والمناطقية بقيت في جنوب اليمن إذ كانت القوى السياسية تستدعي انتمائتها القبلية والمناطقية خلال الأزمات.
وبحلول يناير 1986 كانت عدن ممزقة بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي الحاكم، عندما أقدم حراس الرئيس علي ناصر محمد على هجوم مفاجئ على مكتب الحزب السياسي في عدن في 13 يناير 1986، فكانت تلك بداية حرب 1986 الأهلية في جنوب اليمن. كان أساس الحرب مناطقيا، فعلي ناصر محمد من محافظة أبين بينما كان جل المقتولين في مكتب الحزب السياسي من الضالع ولحج. فقامت ألوية عسكرية من تلك المناطق بقصف عدن من البر والبحر، مما أجبر علي ناصر محمد على الهرب ونزح مئات الآلاف من المدنيين والعسكريين لشمال اليمن منهم عبد ربه منصور هادي. ولحق ذلك عمليات قتل وتصفية ممنهجة ضد أبناء محافظة أبين، بتهمة أنهم كانوا متعاونين مع علي ناصر محمد، فقُتل قرابة عشرة آلاف شخص وهاجر الآلاف نحو اليمن الشمالي جلهم كان من أبين وشبوة.

وشكلت تلك الحرب نهاية دولة جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وتولى حيدر أبو بكر العطاس الرئاسة حتى 22 مايو 1990 واندماج اليمن الجنوبي مع اليمن الشمالي وقيام الجمهورية اليمنية، واعتبر حينها علي سالم البيض نائبا لعلي عبد الله صالح، وحيدر أبو بكر العطاس رئيساً للحكومة، وبعد انتخابات 1993، بدأت الصراعات ضمن الائتلاف الحاكم وقام نائب الرئيس علي سالم البيض بالاعتكاف في عدن، في أغسطس 1993 وتدهور الوضع الأمني العام في البلاد، وفشل الدمج التام للجيشين، فاشتبكت القوات الجنوبية التي نُقلت إلى عمران مع القوات الشمالية هناك، واشتبكت قوات العمالقة الشمالية التي نقلت إلى إبين مع القوات الجنوبية، ووقعت الأطراف السياسية على وثيقة العهد والاتفاق 1994، في العاصمة الأردنية، في 20 فبراير 1994، لمحاولة إنهاء الأزمة، وأدت الأحداث المتتابعة إلى اندلاع حرب صيف 1994، والتحق القادة العسكريين الجنوبيين الفارين بعد أحداث 1986 بصفوف القوات الموالية للرئيس السابق علي عبد الله صالح،  وساندوا جيش الوحدة في الحرب ضد رفاقهم السابقين عام 1994 في الحرب على الانفصاليين. وفي طليعة هؤلاء برزت مجموعة من ألمع الضباط، مثل الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي الذي أصبح وزير الدفاع آنذاك، ورئيس الأركان السابق اللواء عبد الله عليوة، واللواء سالم قطن الذي اغتاله مسلح قاعدي، وبعد الحرب عُيّن عبد ربه منصور هادي نائباً لرئيس الجمهورية، وظل في منصبه حتى 2012، عندما انتخب رئيساً للبلاد.

ظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي ل25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله من القصر الجمهوري بعدن، وأعلن هادي عدن عاصمة مؤقتة في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلاً من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. وذلك بعد سيطرة الحوثيين على صنعاء في 21 سبتمبر 2015، وفرضهم حصاراً على القصر الجمهوري ومنزل الرئيس هادي في 20 يناير، وقدم هادي استقالته في 22 يناير إلى البرلمان الذي لم يعقد جلسة لقبول الاستقالة أو رفضها، وظل هادي قيد الإقامة الجبرية التي فرضها الحوثيون عليه، حتى تمكن من المغادرة إلى عدن في 21 فبراير 2015،  وتراجع عن استقالته، وأعلن بياناً قال فيه «أن جميع القرارات التي اتخذت من 21 سبتمبر باطلة ولا شرعية لها».
ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  وتمكن وزير الدفاع محمود الصبيحي من مغادرة صنعاء إلى عدن والتقى فيها الرئيس هادي.
في 4 مارس 2016، اقتحم مسلحون مجهولون دار الأم تريزا في المدينة وقتلوا ستة عشر شخصاً بينهن أربع راهبات. كما تعرضت عدد من كنائس المدينة القديمة للتدمير على يد متطرفين إسلاميين منذ منتصف العام 2015.

التركيبة السكانية
بلغ عدد سكان عدن 865,000 نسمة بحسب الإسقاط السكاني لعام 2015،  ووفقاً لنتائج التعداد السكاني لعام 2004 م كان تعداد عدن 589,419 نسمة، وهو يشكل ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن. ينمو عدد السكان بمعدل 3.77% سنوياً.

سكان المديريات
يتوزع السكان والمساكن والأسر على مستوى المديريات على النحو التالي:

التوزيع الحضري
شهدت كل محافظات اليمن تحولات هامة في نسبة سكان الريف والحضر، بين تعداد اليمن 1994 وتعداد 2004 وتمثل هذا التحول في نمو سكان الحضر، حيث تشير نتائج تعداد 1994م أن نسبة سكان الحضر كانت (23,5%) بينما ارتفعت هذه النسبة لتصل عام 2004م إلى حوالي (28,64%)، مما يؤكد أن النمط الريفي هو السائد في الجمهورية اليمنية. وقد شهدت اليمن نمواً في سكان الحضر في المدن الرئيسة بشكل أكبر من المدن الأخرى ويتضح ذلك من خلال نمو السكان في العاصمة صنعاء ومدينة عدن والحديدة حيث يمثل الحضر في العاصمة صنعاء 97,7% بينما يمثل الريف 3.3% وتصل النسبة إلى 100% في عدن إلا أن التحضر في المدن الرئيسية في اليمن وخاصة العاصمة صنعاء تحضر زائف حيث ينتقل السكان من الريف إلى المدينة مع احتفاظهم بعاداتهم وتقاليدهم دون تغيير ومنها العادات السيئة كما أن الهجرة لا تغير من مستوى معيشة الفرد لتصبح الهجرة مجرد تغيير مكان الإقامة.

الجغرافيا والمناخ
الموقع
تقع عدن على ساحل خليج عدن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي (363) كيلو متراً، وتقع بين دائرتي عرض 47- 12 شمال خط الاستواء،  وعلى ارتفاع 6 متر عن مستوى سطح البحر، وتحيط بها محافظة لحج من الشمال والشرق، ومحافظة أبين من الشمال الغربي، ولعدن منفذ جوي يتمثل في مطار عدن الدولي، ومنفذ بحري يتمثل في ميناء عدن، ولها طرق برية من الشمال يربطها بلحج وأبين وتعز.

التضاريس
مدينة عدن مدينة ساحلية، حيث تطل على مسطح مائي كبير هو خليج عدن، الذي بدوره ينفتح على المحيط الهندي، كما أن شكل مدينة عدن بشكل شبه جزيرتين ساعد هذا العامل لتنفرد مدينة عدن بهذه الخصوصية مما أثر ذلك بشكل واضح في حدوث ظاهرة نسيم البر والبحر، التي تحدث بفعل التبادل الهوائي لليابسة والماء أثناء الليل والنهار، كما أثر موقعها من السطح المائي في المدى الحراري اليومي والسنوي، ولا يعني ذلك بأنه لا توجد فروق كبيرة في درجات الحرارة بالنسبة للصيف والشتاء.
ينحدر سطح مدينة عدن جنوباً، وتظهر المرتفعات في الجزء الجنوبي من عدن متمثلة في مرتفعات جبل شمسان التي تزيد أعلى قممها عن 500م، ومرتفعات جبل احسان وجبل المزلقم في عدن الصغرى، وهي أقل ارتفاعاً من جبل شمسان، ولا تختلف مرتفعات عدن عن بقية مرتفعات اليمن من حيث التكوين، فهي ذات أصل بركاني، وبالرغم من احتلال المرتفعات الجبلية مساحات كبيرة من المدينة إلا أن تأثيرها ضعيف ومحدود في مناخ مدينة عدن.

المناخ
مناخ عدن حار نسبياً خلال أيام السنة، ويصل متوسط درجة الحرارة في عدن خلال أيام السنة بحدود 27 درجة مئوية، وتبلغ نسبة الرطوبة بين 62% - 73%.، هطول الأمطار في عدن بصورة عامة قليل وغالباً ما تكون الأمطار شتوية ربيعية وتندر في الصيف.

البيئة
السواحل
معظم سواحل محافظة عدن على امتداد الشريط الساحلي هي سواحل رملية، وتمتلك المحافظة شواطئ ساحلية ومنها الساحل الذهبي بمديرية التواهي وساحل أبين بخور مكسر وشاطئ الغدير وشاطئ كود النمر بالبريقة.

الجزر البحرية
هناك حوالي 21 جزيرة حول شبه جزيرتي عدن وعدن الصغرى ورأس عمران، وهي في الغالب جزر صخرية تحيط بجزء منها شعاب مرجانية غير مكتملة وأغلبها تعتبر مناطق اصطياد، عدد من الجزر قائم عليها أنشطة عديدة وخاصة في جزيرة العمال وجزيرة صيرة.

التنوع الحيواني البري والأليف
تعتبر اليمن من الدول الغنية بأنواع الطيور في الشرق الأوسط نظرا لتوافر العديد من البيئات الساحلية المناسبة التي ساعدت على اجتذاب العديد من الطيور المهاجرة في مواقع الأراضي الرطبة والسواحل والجزر، وسجلت منطقة عدن (خور مكسر- الحسوة) ضمن قائمة المناطق الهامة لمنظمة الطيور العالمية باعتبارها موئلاً منتظماً لآخر ثلاثة أنواع مهددة بالانقراض عالمياً هي: عقاب سعفاء كبرى، نورسية وعقاب ملكي شرقي.
هناك العشرات من أنواع الطيور سجلت في الأراضي الرطبة في عدن ومنطقة مستنقع (كالتكس)، الغنية بتنوع كبير من الطيور المستوطنة والمهاجرة، ومنها الطيور التي تتواجد على مدار السنة، ويتواجد في المنطقة العديد من الطيور منها، طيور النحام الكبير والنحام القزم، وبلشون الصخر، وأبو ملعقة، والخرشنة الخطافية وطائر النورس.

الاقتصاد والنقل
يتمثل النشاط الصناعي في عدن، من مجموعة المصانع والوحدات الإنتاجية وفي طليعتها مصفاة النفط حيث تعتبر مصفاة البترول في عدن من أوائل المصافي التي أنشئت في المنطقة، وبدء في تشغيلها عام 1954م، وتتبع شركة مصافي عدن مرافق مثل ميناء ناقلات النفط، وشبكة صهاريج التخزين، ومركز لتموين السفن بالوقود.
تاريخياً، كانت عدن محطة لاستيراد السلع من الساحل الأفريقي ومن أوروبا، والولايات المتحدة، والهند. واعتبارا من عام 1920، كانت عدن مركز تجاري رئيسي للتجارة في شبه الجزيرة العربية، وكان الميناء يقوم بتصدير كميات صغيرة من المنتجات المحلية، إلى معظم الموانئ العربية، وكانت عدن توفر الفحم والملح للسفن العابرة، وكان الميناء محطة لتوقف السفن، عند دخولها باب المندب.

النقل
تاريخياً كان ميناء عدن المرفأ الرئيسي للنقل في المنطقة، وتحط سفن الركاب في مديرية التواهي،  وتخدم المدينة بواسطة مطار عدن الدولي الذي يبعد حوالي 10 كيلومتر (6 ميل) عن المدينة، ويعد المطار المقر الرئيسي لشركة طيران السعيدة ومركز عملياتها، ويعتبر المطار ثاني أكبر مطار في اليمن بعد مطار صنعاء الدولي، ويعتبر أفضل مطارات اليمن من حيث الموقع وذلك بسبب طبيعة اليمن الجبلية، إلا أن هذا المطار يحيط به بحر العرب من جهة الإقلاع والهبوط، يرجع تاريخ إنشاء مطار عدن إلى عام 1927 عندما قامت القوات البريطانية بتأسيس مطار عسكري في مديرية خور مكسر، وبعد الحرب العالمية الثانية قامت بريطانيا بتحديث عمراني واسع وشيدت بجانب المطار العسكري مطار عدن الدولي المعروف حالياً.
كان «طيران اليمدا» الناقل الرسمي لجنوب اليمن، قبل الوحدة، وكان مقرها عدن، قبل دمجها مع الخطوط الجوية اليمنية في 1996.
خلال أوائل القرن ال20 كانت عدن مركزاً بارزاً لتصدير البن الذي يزرع في المرتفعات الجبيلة. وأيضاً لتصدير اللبان والقمح والشعير والبرسيم والدخن، التي تنتج وتصدر من عدن. وكانت أوراق وسيقان البرسيم والدخن والذرة التي تنتج في عدن تستخدم أعلاف بصفة عامة. واعتباراً من عام 1920 كانت عدن تقوم بتحلية ماء البحر لإنتاج ملح الطعام، وبين عامي 1916 - 1917، أنتجت عدن أكثر من 120,000 طن من الملح، وقد أنتجت عدن أيضا البوتاس، التي تم تصديرها إلى مومباي.

المنطقة الحرة
تمثل المنطقة الحرة التي افتتحت في عام 1991، بوابة اليمن الاقتصادية ونقطة التقاء قارتي آسيا وأفريقيا، وتكتسب المنطقة الحرة أهميتها الاستراتيجية من الموقع الخاص لميناء عدن، كونه يقع مباشرة على الطريق التجاري الرئيسي حول العالم ومن الشرق الأوسط إلى أوروبا وأمريكا، ويتميز بإمكانية توفير خدمات الترانزيت إلى شرق أفريقيا والبحر الأحمر وشبه القارة الهندية والخليج العربي. وتمثل المنطقة الحرة منطقة تخزين وتوزيع مناسبة لأفريقيا والبحر الأحمر والخليج العربي.

المياه
ترجح دراسات أثرية حديثة، أن الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمة المعروفة حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابة 13,638,2757 لتر من الماء.

أهم المؤشرات الرئيسية لمدينة عدن:

التقسيم الإداري
تقسم الجمهورية اليمنية إدارياً في إطار نظام السلطة المحلية إلى 21 محافظة ، بما فيها محافظة عدن، وتقسم العاصمة الاقتصادية عدن إلى ثمانية مديريات كالتالي:

المديريات
الخدمات العامة
التعليم
يوجد في عدن 95 مدرسة منها 13 روضة أطفال، و82 مدرسة للتعليم الأساسي منها 29 مدرسة للذكور و29 مدرسة للبنات و29 مدرسة مشتركة للبنين والبنات، كما يوجد 29 مدرسة ثانوية منها 15 مدرسة للذكور و14 مدرسة للبنات وجميعها بنظام الفترتين، وحتى عام 2004م بلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور في التعليم الأساسي 57,941 والإناث 48,081 وبمجموع 104,622 طالباً، أما في التعليم الثانوي فبلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور 11,029 طالباً، والإناث 9,643 طالبة.
أما مراكز ومعاهد التعليم المهني والتقني والفني فيبلغ عددها 13 مراكز ويلتحق فيها 2214 طالب ويشمل 453 مدرس والمعاهد الصحية معهداً واحداً، يلتحق فيه 864 طالب ويشمل 147 مدرس حسب إحصائيات 2010. وبالنسبة للتعليم العالي توجد في عدن جامعة حكومية واحدة، وهي جامعة عدن فيها 9 كليات، ويلتحق فيها أكثر من 29 ألف طالب حسب إحصائيات 2010.

الصحة
يوجد في العاصمة الاقتصادية عدن 15 مستشفى، منها 5 مستشفيات عامة حكومية، و6 تابعة للقطاع الخاص، و37 مركز صحي، وتوجد في المدينة 34 منشأة تقدم خدمات الأمومة والطفولة، ويبلغ عدد القوى العاملة التخصصية في المنشآت الصحية 2,825 متخصص.

مناطق موبوئة
في يونيو 2015 أعلن فريق الصليب الأحمر الدولي الموجود في مناطق الصراع في اليمن خلال أحداث الحرب الأهلية اليمنية أن مدن كريتر والمعلا وخور مكسر والتواهي بمحافظة عدن جنوبي البلاد مناطق موبوءة بمرض «حمى الضنك»، وقالت السلطات الصحية في عدن إن هذه الحمى انتشرت بشكل ملفت وواسع منذ مطلع شهر مايو بعد تدهور الخدمات الصحية وتضرر منشئات البنية التحتية من كهرباء ومياه وصرف صحي جراء القتال المستمر في المدينة منذ أشهر.

البريد
عرفت عدن البريد منذ 15 يونيو 1839 أي بعد سنة من الاحتلال البريطاني، برغم أن مكتب البريد الرسمي لم يدشن إلا عام 1857، اُستخدم في عدن الطوابع البريدية لكل من بريطانيا والهند إلى أن صارت تسمى مستعمرة عدن في 1 أبريل 1937، برغم أن طوابع هذه المرحلة لم تحمل أي إشارة مميزة، لكن استخدام الرقم 124 كرمز بريدي ينسب لعدن كجزء من النظام العددي البريدي الهندي.
ثم عندما صارت مستعمرة عام 1937 أصبح لها مجموعات من الطوابع البريدية التي تحتوي على صور ويطبع اسم عدن (Aden) عليها، وفي العام 1939 أصدرت مجوعة بريدية جديدة تحتوي على صورة للملك جورج السادس، لكن سلاطين حضرموت -الذين كانوا تحت مظلة محمية عدن التي تسيطر عليها بريطانيا منذ ثمانينات القرن التاسع عشر- رفضوا ذلك ولهذا أصدرت بريطانيا مجوعة بريدية منفصلة في عام 1942، ولكن هذه المرة مع إدراج عبارة وصور تعبر عن السلطنة الكثيرية في سيؤن والسلطنة القعيطية في الشحر والمكلا إضافة لصوَر السلاطين.

الإعلام
الصحافة
تأسست صحيفة العمل الأسبوعية في 1957 في عدن، كان شعارها (الحرية، الخبز، والسلام)، ولم تسمح السلطات البريطانية، سوى بطبع 1500 نسخة أسبوعيا، وتم حظر الصحيفة بعد فترة وجيزة.
وفي 1958 أُسست صحيفة الأيام في عدن، كصحيفة يومية مستقلة باللغة العربية، إبان الاحتلال البريطاني، وصدر العدد الأول في 30 يوليو 1958 وكان مؤسسها ورئيس تحريرها العميد محمد علي باشراحيل، وتوقفت عن الصدور بعد الاستقلال في عهد جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية، من ثم عاودت الصدور بعد تحقيق الوحدة اليمنية، وكان أول عدد للصدور الثاني في 7 نوفمبر 1990 بعد توقف دام أكثر من 23 عام، وفي العام 1998 كانت «الأيام» الصحيفة الأولى في اليمن التي تقوم الحكومة بمقاضاتها بموجب قانون جزائي، وتبعت تلك القضية قضايا أخرى حتى غدت بنهاية العام 2008 متحملة 73% من إجمالي عدد القضايا التي رفعتها وزارة الإعلام والحكومة اليمنية ضد الصحافة في اليمن. وعندما اشتدت وطأة الاحتجاجات والمصادمات في عدن في أبريل 2009، «غطت الأيام الأحداث بشكل موسع، وكانت صوَر الدماء والإصابات تعلو غلاف الصحيفة لأيام»  وأرسل الرئيس علي عبد الله صالح وفود إلى الصحيفة، مطالباً إياهم بتخفيف وطأة تغطيتهم، والتوقف عن استخدام صور المصابين ونزيف الدماء. وفي 12 مايو 2009 شنت قوات الأمن هجوماً على مقر صحيفة الأيام في عدن.

الإذاعة والتلفزيون
تأسست إذاعة عدن في 17 أغسطس 1954 تحت اسم «محطة عدن للإذاعة». وتبث حالياً على فترتين صباحية ومسائية. افتتح الاحتلال البريطاني قناة عدن في 11 سبتمبر 1964، عقب قيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر 1963م، واقتصر الإرسال التلفزيوني على تغطية الأحياء الآهلة بالسكان في مدينة عدن، وبالذات حيث يتواجد جنود وعائلات القوات البريطانية، وفي يناير 1979 انتقل مقر التلفزيون إلى «مبنى الإذاعة والتلفزيون» بالتواهي الذي تم تجهيزه، وكان حينها البث باللونين الأبيض والأسود، وفي مارس 1981 بدأ الانتقال التدريجي إلى البث الملون، وفي يونيو 1981م بدأ بث القناة عبر الأقمار الصناعية. وبعد الوحدة اليمنية في 22 مايو 1990م، كانت قناة عدن هي القناة الثانية الرسمية للتلفزيون اليمني.

الثقافة
اللهجات
ساهم دخول اليمنيين في الإسلام إلى هجرهم قلمهم القديم واستبداله بالأبجدية النبطية المتأخرة التي دون بها القرآن  يتحدث اليمنيون اليوم العربية باللهجة اليمنية وهي لهجة متطورة ومرتبطة ارتباطا وثيقا باللغة القديمة،  وهي ثلاث لهجات بتفرعات لهجة صنعانية ولهجة حضرمية ولهجة تعزية-عدنية، بالإضافة للهجة بدوية لسكان مأرب والجوف وشبوة وبادية حضرموت، ولكل من هذه اللهجات خصائص ومميزات.

الموسيقى والشعر
الفن العدني أو العدنيات هو فن من فنون الموسيقى العربية، ومن فنانو عدن القدامى إسكندر ثابت صالح ومحمد مرشد ناجي ومن الشعراء عبد الرحمن إبراهيم محمد وأحمد غالب محمد الجابري وعبد الله عبد الكريم محمد وعلي عبد الله جعفر أمان وفريد محمد بركات ولطفي جعفر أمان ومحسن علي بريك.
لعبت «المزيكة العدنية» دوراً كبيراً في المجتمع العدني، وكان يطلق على الفنانين في اللهجة العدنية «المَطاربه» أي أهل الطرب، بدأت المزيكة العدنية في 1920 حين تشكل جيش محمية عدن، وبعده الحرس الوطني، حيث كانت هناك فرق لتلك القوات وكانت تلك الفرق تشارك في المناسبات وفي حفلات الزواج.

الرياضة
قبل الاستقلال
تعود البداية الأولى للرياضة العدنية إلى عام 1902م، عندما تم تأسيس نادي للتنس العدني، ومقره في حي القطيع بكريتر، وأسس يوسف محمد خان «نادي الترفيه المتحد» (بالإنجليزية: Recreational Club United) في مدينة كريتر، وكان يعرف بملعب يوسف خان. وتعتبر مدينة عدن أول مدينة مُورِسَتْ الرياضة فيها في الجزيرة العربية، وتأسس في 1905 أول نادي أهلي في عدن تحت مسمى «نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي»، كأول نادي رياضي في اليمن والعالم العربي. وكان ينازل فرق جيش الاحتلال وفرق الاساطيل القادمة والمارة إلى ميناء عدن.
وفي عام 1924 تأسس في كريتر «نادي الحسيني الرياضي»، كما ظهر نادي ثالث في التواهي باسم «نادي البامبوت»، والشيخ عثمان. وشهدت فترة الثلاثينيات ظهور عدد من الأندية ففي عام 1933م ظهر «نادي نجوم الليل» والعيدروسي ونجوم الصباح في كريتر، وفي التواهي ظهر «نادي الاتحاد الإسلامي» (الموالده).
وكانت مباريات كرة القدم حتى ذلك العام تمارس بشكل ودي بين فرق المناطق كريتر، التواهي، الشيخ عثمان، حيث لم يكن وجود لاتحادات تنظم النشاط الرياضي. وفي عام 1934م أعلنت سلطة الاحتلال عن تأسيس جمعية رياضية أطلق عليها «الجمعية الرياضية العدنية»، وذلك بعد تزايد أعداد النوادي المحلية، وقد تم تعيين أعضائها من قبل الحاكم العام لعدن، وكان جميع أعضائها من الإنجليز، برئاسة حاكم عدن الإنجليزي «برنارد رايلي» كراعي للجمعية، ويتكون مجلس الإدارة من «هيكم بوتم» رئيساً، والهندي «روزاريو» سكرتيراً، وعضوية اثنين آخرين.
وبدأت هذه الجمعية في إقامة أول بطولة للأندية وهي «بطولة كأس روزاريو»، شاركت في البطولة 6 أندية، ثلاثة من كريتر (الاتحاد المحمدي، الحسيني، نجوم الليل)، ومن التواهي (الموالده، والباميوت)، ومن الشيخ عثمان نادي الشيخ عثمان، ويضم لاعبين من مختلف الفرق الصغيرة في منظقة الشيخ عثمان، وقد أحرز هذه البطولة نادي الاتحاد المحمدي.
ومن أهم البطولات المقامة في عدن قبل الاستقلال، كأس روزاريو، وكأس رايلي، وكأس باسم باصفة النار الصومالية، وكأس أرامكو، وبطولة كيك منشرجي.

بعد الاستقلال
بعد الاستقلال تأسس «اتحاد كرة القدم» في 18 يناير 1968م على انقاض «الجمعية الرياضية العدنية»، واتخذ الاتحاد قراراً بخصوص الأندية العدنية التي كانت قد بلغ عددها حوالي 64 نادي رياضي، قضى بتقليص ودمج الأندية في عدن ولحج إلى 16 نادي فقط، واضطرت الأندية للانضمام للفرق الكبيرة أو التوحد معها. وفي فبراير 1968م، ألغيت عدة نواد رياضية وبقي 12 نادي فقط، وفي ديسمبر 1968م، تم دمج نادي الإصلاح ونادي الشعب، في نادي واحد باسم الأخير في التواهي، وفي 1969م توحد في كريتر نادي الاتحاد المحمدي ونادي التضامن، تحت اسم نادي التضامن المحمدي.
وفي «المؤتمر الرياضي العام الأول» في 1973م دمجت الأندية وقلصت مرة أخرى، ليصبح عددها 7 أندية فقط: هي نادي الأحرار، نادي الأهلي، نادي شمسان، نادي الشعب، نادي الهلال، نادي الشبيبة المتحدة، نادي التنس العدني. في 18 يوليو 1975م، كانت مرحلة تشكيل أندية المدن، وبداية مرحلة تسييس الأندية لصالح الجبهة القومية للتحرير، وقُرر تغيير أسمائها وتقليصها لتصبح 5 أندية هي نادي التلال وشمسان والميناء ونادي الوحدة ونادي الشعلة.
في 18 يوليو 1975 ظهر «نادي التلال الرياضي» برئاسة ياسين سعيد نعمان، كاسم جديد ل«نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي» الذي تأسس في 1905م، وفي 1976 م ظهر «الاتحاد اليمني لكرة القدم». وشارك نادي التلال في «مسابقة كأس 26 سبتمبر» في 1980، كأول مسابقة كروية يشارك فيها مع منتخبات من شمال اليمن وجنوبه، كمنتخب محافظة إب ومحافظة تعز ومحافظة حضرموت ولحج والحديدة، وذلك في ملعب الشهيد الظرافي بصنعاء، وتوج الهلال بطلاً لكأس 26 سبتمبر، بعد فوزه على منتخب الحديدة بخمسة أهداف نظيفة.
كرة القدم هي الرياضة الأكبر شعبية في عدن، يوجد في عدن 9 ملاعب منها استاد 22 مايو الدولي، و10 أندية رياضية،  وفي نوفمبر 2010 استضافت عدن كأس الخليج العربي لكرة القدم 2010.

السياحة
لا زالت الكثير من مواقع الجذب السياحي غير مطورة وتنقصها الخدمات جراء الحروب والاقتتال الدائم الذي يعاني منه اليمن فاليمن يمتلك أربعة مواقع ضمن مواقع التراث العالمي هي سقطرى وصنعاء القديمة وشبام ومدينة زبيد القديمة ورغم ارتفاع عدد السياح إلى 176.98% في اليمن ما بين 2004 -2003 إلا أن الحكومة لم تبدي اهتماما بالقطاع السياحي وارتفع معدل إقامة السياح من 7 أيام إلى 16 يوم وكلها مؤشرات إلى إمكانية تطوير القطاع السياحي في البلاد وأشارت بعض الدراسات أن تنمية قطاع السياحة في اليمن كفيل بإخراجه من دائرة البلدان الأقل نماء يأتي أغلب السياح إلى اليمن لزيارة سقطرى والآثار القديمة والتعرف على ثقافة الشعب اليماني وفنونه الشعبية والمهتمين بدراسة الثقافة العربية التي لم تتأثر بمؤثرات خارجية وذلك النتاج العزلة التي فُرضت على اليمن لعقود طويلة وأشارت وزارة السياحية اليمنية إلى ذلك في تقريرها الأخير بشأن التنمية السياحية بأن الخدمات السياحية متواضعة في اليمن وتنعدم تماما في القرى الصغيرة التي تلقى إقبالا سياحيا.

معالم ومواقع أثرية وسياحية
المتاحف
المتحف الوطني: للآثار، يقع في مدينة كريتر، ويطل على البحر المواجه لقلعة صيرة، بني في عهد السلطان فضل بن علي العبدلي خلال الفترة 1912م - 1918م، ويوجد به مجموعة من الآثار الحجرية (تعود إلى العصر الحجري) والعصر البرونزي، وكذلك مجموعة من القطع الحجرية المكتوبة بأنواع مختلفة من الخط اليمني القديم. وتماثيل وحلي وزخارف تعود إلى مملكة سبأ ومملكة حمير وقتبان وأوسان، وآثار إسلامية.
المتحف الحربي: يقع في شارع المتحف بمدينة كريتر، يعود تاريخه إلى العام 1918م حيث كان مدرسة للتعليم الابتدائي (بالإنجليزية: Residency School) وبعد الاستقلال عن بريطانيا، وفي 1971، جرى تحويله إلى متحف مخصص للتراث العسكري اليمني، بقرار من الرئيس سالم ربيع علي آنذاك، وكان يتألف من 7 صالات، وبعد الوحدة اليمنية جرت عملية ترميم له وافتتح مرة أخرى في 2001م وقسم إلى أربعة أجنحة، كل جناح ضم عدة قاعات، جرت عملية إعادة تأهيل لهذا المتحف في 2007م. وصل عدد زوار المتحف خلال العام 2007 إلى 2008 حوالي 17,000 زائر يمني ومائتي سائح أجنبي. كما ارتفع هذا العدد إلى حوالي 27,800 سائح في 2009.

Aden (ɑːdɛn/ah-den, arabe : عدن ʿAdan) est une ville du Yémen, située à 170 km à l'est du détroit Bab el Mandeb. Elle est peuplée d'environ 990 000 habitants. C'est aussi un port naturel, construit sur un ancien site volcanique, déjà utilisé par le royaume antique d'Awsan entre les VIIe et Ve siècles av. J.-C.. La ville donne son nom au golfe d'Aden.

Étymologie
Ayant la même étymologie qu'Éden, Aden vient de l'akkadien edinnu, qui signifie « plaine ».

Géographie
Aden est composée de plusieurs petites villes : 

Cratère, la ville portuaire d'origine,
Little Aden, la ville industrielle, avec raffinerie de pétrole,
Mu'alla (en), le port moderne,
Tawahi (en), connu comme Steamer Point à l'époque coloniale,
les stations de repos de Gold Mohur,
Khormaksar (en), située sur l'isthme qui relie Aden au continent, avec notamment les missions diplomatiques de la ville, les bureaux principaux de l'université d'Aden et l'aéroport international de Khormaksar, ancienne base aérienne britannique et deuxième plus grand aéroport du Yémen.
Sur le continent se situent les sous-centres de Cheikh Othman (en), zone de l'ancien port, Al-Mansoura (en), ville planifiée par les Britanniques, et Madinat ash-Chaab (anciennement Madinat al-Itihad), le site désigné comme la capitale de la South Arabian Federation, où se situent une installation de dessalement de l'eau de mer et des facultés de l'Université d'Aden.
La capitale de la brève république démocratique populaire du Yémen, jusqu'à l'unification du Yémen du Nord et du Sud, a été déclarée zone de libre échange.

Histoire
Histoire antique
La position stratégique du port, entre l'Inde et l'Europe en fait dès l'Antiquité un lieu d'échanges commerciaux importants, notamment mentionné dans Le Périple de la mer Érythrée, sous son ancien nom de Porto. Le village sur le bord de mer est encore peu développé, sans fortification, une île plus qu'une péninsule.
Les civilisations préislamiques, les royaumes himyarite ou sabéen ont pu y construire des tours de guet, mais il ne reste trace d'aucune fortification.
Elle peut et doit être l'antique Eudaemon (Heureuse).

Moyen Âge
Les historiens arabes Ibn al Mojawir et Abou Makhramah attribuent la première fortification d'Aden à Beni Zuree'a, et Muhammad Sultan Azim Qamarbandi Naqsh, Tarikh ul-Yémen. L'objectif semble avoir été double : empêcher l'accès de forces hostiles, maintenir les revenus en contrôlant la circulation des marchandises et en empêchant la contrebande. La forme originale paraît relativement faible. Après 1175, la reconstruction est plus solide et la ville populaire attire marins et marchands d'Égypte, de Sind, d'Afrique et même de Chine.
Zheng He, dans son expédition de 1413-1415, visite la région.
En 1421, l'empereur chinois Zhu Di, de la dynastie Ming, envoie deux grands émissaires, le grand eunuque Li Xing et le grand eunuque et amiral Zhou Man de Zheng He chargé de transmettre un édit impérial, avec don de chapeaux et de robes, au roi d'Aden. Les envoyés, à bord de trois navires chargés de trésors, partent de Sumatra pour Aden. Cet événement est enregistré dans le livreYing-yai Sheng-lan par Ma Huan, qui accompagne l'envoyé impérial. [réf. à confirmer] .
Aden est occupée par les Portugais entre 1513-1538 et 1547-1548. Elle est gouvernée par l'Empire ottoman entre 1538-1547 et 1548-1645[Passage contradictoire]. Après la domination ottomane, elle est gouvernée par le sultanat de Lahij, sous des imams Zaidi du Yémen[Qui ?].
Entre 1538 et 1630[Passage contradictoire], Aden est sous souveraineté ottomane.
La ville, cédée par le sultan Muhsin bin Fadi, intègre l'Empire colonial britannique en 1838 pour y occuper une position centrale entre le canal de Suez, Zanzibar et Bombay jusqu'à l'indépendance de la république populaire du Yémen du Sud.

Domination britannique 1838-1963
Aden, à cette époque, est encore un petit village avec une population de 600 Arabes, des Somaliens, des Juifs et des Indiens - logés pour la plupart dans des huttes de roseaux ou sur des nattes au milieu des ruines, rappelant une époque disparue de richesse et de prospérité. Haines estime qu'il peut devenir un grand centre commercial et cette prévision fut avérée : la période britannique en a fait un des ports les plus achalandés au monde.
En 1838, le Sultan Muhsin bin Fadl de l'état voisin de Lahej cède 194 km2 (75 miles carrés), dont Aden, à l'Empire britannique. Le 19 janvier 1839, le British East India Company débarque les Royal Marines à Aden, pour occuper le territoire et arrêter les attaques de pirates contre l'expédition britannique en Inde. Le port se trouve à peu près à égale distance du Canal de Suez, de Bombay et de Zanzibar, toutes régions alors sous influence britannique.
Aden a été un entrepôt et une étape pour les marins dans le monde antique, permettant de reconstituer les vivres et l'eau. Au milieu du XIXe siècle, il devient nécessaire de fournir également le charbon et l'eau des chaudières à vapeur. Aden offre alors une station de charbon à Steamer-Point.
La population croît : 6 000 en 1839, 15 000 en 1842, 17 000 en 1856, 19 289 en 1872, 34 860 en 1889 (et 35 932 en incluant la garnison de Périm).
Sa situation géographique est utilisée pour la contrebande d'armes, activité répandue dans le golfe d'Aden et en Somalie et contre laquelle le gouvernement britannique s'engage en 1909 aux côtés de la France et de l'Italie.
Jusqu'en 1937, l'établissement d'Aden est géré comme une partie du Raj britannique. Son territoire d'origine est agrandi en 1857 de 13 km2 avec l'île de Périm, en 1868 de 73 km2  avec l'archipel des Khuriya Muriya et en 1915 de 108 km2 avec l'île de Kamaran.
En 1937, son statut est modifié, l'établissement est détaché administrativement de l'Inde et devient la colonie d'Aden, une Crown colony britannique. Le changement de gouvernement entraîne le changement des unités monétaires, les roupies deviennent des shillings de l'Afrique de l'Est. L'arrière-pays d'Aden et l'Hadramaout sont également moins liés à la Grande-Bretagne, puisque le Protectorat d'Aden est supervisé à partir d'Aden même.
En décembre 1947 se déroule le Pogrom d'Aden contre les juifs de la ville. 82 juifs sont assassinés, des écoles incendiées et plus de 100 magasins pillés lors de ces émeutes antisémites. L'origine des violences s'explique par une grève générale de trois jours et une manifestation des habitants afin de contester le vote de l'Organisation des Nations unies sur le plan de partage de la Palestine.
Après la nationalisation par l'Egypte du canal de Suez en 1956, Aden devient la base principale de la région pour les Britanniques.
Aden envoie une équipe aux Jeux de l'Empire britannique et du Commonwealth de 1962 à Perth en Australie.

Little Aden : 1955-1967
Little Aden est toujours dominé par la raffinerie de pétrole, construite pour British Petroleum. Little Aden était bien connu des marins pour son port pétrolier, avec une mission d'accueil, près de la BP d'Aden, avec piscine et bar climatisé. Les zones d'hébergement pour le personnel de la raffinerie sont connus sous les noms d'origine arabe de Bureika et Ghadir.
Bureika consiste surtout en dortoirs, des logements en bois construits pour accueillir les milliers d'hommes qualifiés et des ouvriers importés pour construire la raffinerie, plus tard convertis en logements familiaux.
Ghadir housing est construit en pierre, en grande partie des carrières locales de granite. Beaucoup de ces logements sont encore debout et occupés par les plus riches habitants de Big Aden.
Little Aden comporte également de nombreux villages pittoresques de pêcheurs, comme Ghadir et ses casiers à homards.

Avant l'indépendance : 1963-1967
Pour stabiliser Aden et le Protectorat d'Aden et les protéger des intentions égyptiennes, soutenues par le Yémen du nord, les Britanniques tentent d'unir progressivement les États disparates de la région en préparation de l'indépendance.
Le 18 janvier 1963, la colonie d'Aden est incorporée dans la Fédération des émirats arabes du Sud contre la volonté du Yémen du nord, qui revendique la ville et le sud du Yémen. La population de la ville, l'État d'Aden, et la Fédération sont rebaptisés Fédération d'Arabie du Sud (Federation of South Arabia : FSA).
Une insurrection contre la domination britannique, Aden Emergency, commence par une attaque à la grenade par le Front de libération nationale (FLN), communiste, contre le Haut Commissaire britannique, le 10 décembre 1963, tuant une personne et en blessant cinquante. L'état d'urgence est instauré.
En 1964, la Grande-Bretagne annonce son intention d'accorder l'indépendance à la FSA en 1968, l'armée britannique restant à Aden. La situation sécuritaire se détériore : FLN et FLOSY (Front pour la Libération du Sud Yémen Occupé) rivalisent.
En janvier 1967, des émeutes de masse ont lieu entre FLN et FLOSY, dans le vieux quartier arabe d'Aden-ville, jusqu'à la mi-février, malgré l'intervention des troupes britanniques. Durant cette période, ont lieu autant d'attaques contre les troupes britanniques par les deux parties qu'entre elles.
Le 22 novembre 1966 une bombe avait fait exploser en vol un Douglas DC-3 de la compagnie Aden Airways (en). Il n'y eut aucun survivant parmi les 30 passagers et membres de l'équipage. Le 30 juin 1967 un second avion Vickers Viscount en réparation sur l'aéroport international d'Aden, est détruit au sol sans faire de victime.
Le 30 novembre 1967, les Britanniques se retirent finalement, laissant Aden et le reste de la FSA sous le contrôle du FLN. Les Royal Marines, les premières troupes britanniques à s'installer à Aden en 1839, sont les dernières à partir, à l'exception d'un détachement des Royal Engineers.

Indépendance : 1967-1975
Aden devient la capitale de la nouvelle république populaire du Yémen du Sud, rebaptisée république démocratique populaire du Yémen en 1970. Avec l'unification du nord et du sud du Yémen en 1990, Aden n'est plus capitale nationale, mais reste la capitale du gouvernorat d'Aden, qui couvre une superficie semblable à celle de la colonie d'Aden.

Histoire récente
Pendant le détournement d'avion du Vol 181 Lufthansa, commencé le 13 octobre 1977, Aden est l'avant-dernier arrêt prévu des pirates de l'air. Le gouvernement refuse toute interaction avec les ravisseurs et la piste est bloquée. N'ayant de carburant que pour vingt minutes, le pilote est forcé d'atterrir à côté de la piste dans le sable.
Le 29 décembre 1992, Al-Qaïda mène sa première attaque terroriste connue à Aden, le bombardement de l'Hôtel Gold Mohur (/ ˌ ɡoʊld mɔər /), où les militaires américains sont réputés séjourner sur la route de la Somalie pour l'opération Restore Hope. Un Yéménite et un touriste autrichien meurent dans l'attaque.
Aden est brièvement au centre de la république démocratique du Yémen sécessioniste, du 21 mai au 7 juillet 1994.
Le 3 janvier 2000, des membres d'Al-Qaïda tentent d'attaquer un destroyer américain lance-missiles de classe Arleigh Burke The Sullivans (DDG-68), dans le cadre de l'attaque du millénaire. Mais le bateau transportant les explosifs, surchargé, coule avant d'approcher sa cible.
Le 12 octobre 2000, Al-Qaïda réitère le même type d'attaque contre un autre destroyer, l'USS Cole, qui fait relâche dans le port d'Aden. Cette fois, la petite embarcation chargée d'explosifs saute à la hauteur de la salle des machines, fait un trou d'environ 10 m2 dans la coque, et cause la mort de dix-sept marins et en blesse cinquante autres. Les deux terroristes périssent aussi dans l'attentat-suicide.
En février 2015, lors de la guerre civile et la fuite du président Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi en direction de cette même ville, Aden devient capitale de facto.
Elle est aussi le théâtre de la bataille d'Aden de mars à juillet 2015.
Le 6 décembre 2015, Jaafar Mohammed Saad, gouverneur d'Aden depuis le 9 octobre précédent, est tué dans un attentat à la voiture piégée revendiqué par Daech, qui cherche à asseoir son emprise sur le pays dans un contexte de guerre civile entre Houthis et loyalistes.
Le 9 décembre 2015, des hommes armés font exploser une église qui date de l’époque britannique. Début 2016, des terroristes s'en prennent à l'église de la Sainte-Famille d'Aden. Quatre religieuses missionnaires de la Charité et douze personnes sont assassinées dans une attaque le 4 mars 2016.
Le 6 mai 2016, l'aéroport de la ville rouvre.
Le 4 septembre 2016, la raffinerie d'Aden est rouverte, un an après la fin de la bataille, permettant ainsi de mettre fin à la pénurie d'électricité.
Le 19 septembre 2016, le siège de la Banque centrale est déplacé à Aden.
En août 2019, l'ONU fait état de nombreuses exactions commises à Aden par des miliciens formés et équipés par les Émirats arabes unis contre des Yéménites originaires du nord du pays : « Nous avons reçu de multiples sources des informations sur des arrestations, des détentions arbitraires, des déplacements forcés, des agressions physiques et des harcèlements, ainsi que sur des pillages et des actes de vandalisme commis par les forces de sécurité contre des centaines d'habitants [originaires] du Nord ».

Économie
Aden possède un aéroport international : l'aéroport international d'Aden.
Via Aden Cement Enterprises Ltd., le suisse Holcim possède une cimenterie dans la ville, employant 81 personnes.
La gestion du port est concédée depuis le 1er novembre 2008 à DP World Aden, coentreprise entre Dubai Ports World et Yemen Gulf of Aden Port Corporation, avec pour mission de gérer et développer le terminal de conteneurs.
Il y a deux établissements quatre étoiles : les hôtels Mercure et Gold Mohur Hotel & Resort.

Tawahi
Tawahi (arabe : التواهي) est un quartier d'Aden. Pendant la période coloniale britannique, ce district s'est développé. Le quartier comprend également le « Steamer Point », un port colonial pour navires à passagers et navires-citernes. Aujourd'hui encore, les hôtels les plus touristiques y sont concentrés.

Krater
Cratère, ou Kraytar, (arabe : كريتر), est le nom officieux d'un cratère de volcan éteint situé dans ce quartier d'Aden. Son nom officiel est Seera, le district de Sirah, (arabe : صيرة). Cette partie de la ville abrite environ 70 000 habitants.

Transports
La ville est desservie par l'aéroport d'Aden, à 9,5 kilomètres du centre.

Culture
Du fait de sa longue période de colonisation Britannique, Aden est la ville et métropole la plus Anglophone de la péninsule Arabique. En 1985, 15 % de la population de la ville d'Aden parlait Anglais en seconde langue.

Aden en littérature
Arthur Rimbaud y a séjourné à partir de 1880 après son départ de France. La ville sert également de cadre aux romans des écrivains français Paul Nizan avec Aden Arabie, publié en 1931, Pierre Benoit avec Les Environs d'Aden, publié en 1940 et Henry de Monfreid qui évoque la ville à de nombreuses reprises dans ses récits.

## Overview
Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ ʿAdan) is a city in the Yemeni Coastal Plains, on the Gulf of Aden at the southern end of the Red Sea.

## Understand
It was a major port on the Maritime Silk Road. Marco Polo described it as a hub of commerce, where goods arriving by ship from the East were transferred to smaller boats for the trip up the Red Sea and on to Alexandria and Christendom.
At one point it ruled a small empire, the part of Africa just across from it.
In the 19th century, it became a British protectorate.
It was the capital of South Yemen until Yemen was re-united in 1990.
It is a very picturesque city with a mix of traditional Arabic and British influences. It was the capital of the liberal South, but it has been changing due to the take-over of the tribal forces of the North. For instance the Soviets banned head scarves for women and for decades, women were relatively emancipated and could carry out university degrees abundantly. Now, the scarves are back on the street. There is also a sizeable Somali minority (war refugees).

## Climate
The city swelters through a desert climate all year round, with high temperatures and little to no rain.

## Get in
Access to Aden is available by car, airplane and bus. Airfare from Sana'a on Yemenia, the national carrier, is around 10,000 rials or US$55. Buses are generally comfortable and the journey from Sana'a to Aden takes about 8 hours. A ticket costs ~1500 rials. Be prepared to show a travel permit (Tashrih) on military checkpoints. You can't leave capital Sanaa without it. It's good idea to have also few photocopies of your passport ready. If you travel to Aden or elsewhere in Yemen by plane, no travel permit is required.
There are direct flights to many cities in the Middle East. If you are flying in from outside the region, it will be necessary to transfer in Egypt, Jordan or the United Arab Emirates.
12.825345.03661 Aden International Airport (ADE  IATA).      (updated Jan 2023)

## Get around
private taxi
collective taxi ("mer mer") - costing 40 rials from Tawahi to Crater or Sirah for instance (ask for colour codes if you speak Arabic), cheap and easy to use along common routes
by foot - for any climbing and to complement many collective taxi trips.
Taxis are practical, yet always bargain with the taxi driver before getting in. Otherwise, they have the tendency to get it done at their high price. If you know the city very well, you can use the mini-buses along with the public. The mini-buses are easy to use; they follow an essentially circular path around the city. Find someone familiar with the area to explain their route as the fare for the buses is around 30 rials, or roughly a tenth of the average taxi ride.  There are also many boats that will take you whenever on a little cruise on the sea.
Aden International Airport is accessible, yet if you are in Yemen it is better to drive there. You can also rent cars from international companies.

## See
Sunsets, lagoons (for bird-watching), the Aden museum, Crater (including a shopping district), people, beach and reservoirs.

## Do
Among activities carried out by the locals that you can easily sample:
snooker ("billiard")
hanging out at fresh juice bars or small restaurants with kubz (giant pita bread)
chewing betel (2 versions: tobacco, sweet). This causes cancer in the long-run, and also stains teeth and gums red. Tobacco version is very strong and spitting regularly is highly recommended. The sweet version is particularly tasty and doesn't induce the same urge to spit.
chewing qat - the national past-time. This also causes cancer in the long-run; first-time use generally induces restlessness, insomnia and general mouth fatigue and aches
climbing on the mountain tops for great views of the city (beware of the no trespassing zone and take abundant water and sun screening equipment)
beach activities.
Aden is especially known for the beautiful beaches and swimming activities. Besides this, Aden has the only considerable nightlife in Yemen, and foreigners can enjoy wonderful Arabian nights.
Sport fishing: tunas and sharks can be hunted near the coast.
A visit at the Gold Mohur Beach and Elephant Bay Hotel is a must. For women travelling alone, there is also a women-only beach at the Sheraton Hotel.  Excellent snorkeling is available although not as clear as Sharm El-Sheikh.

## Buy
Beautiful scarfs can be purchased in Crater as well as an abaya for the ladies. Spices can also be found in abundance. Other typical local products include: perfumes & incense, men and women's clothing, head scarves, honey, sweets.

## Eat
Foul beans and baguette bread or khobez (round pita bread)
''Khmir'' (sweet square doughnuts) and tea with milk
Dinner or lunch 
Moufa or mukbza restaurants have mufa fish, khobez rushwsh, mulwah, rateb (round bread).
''Zurbian'' a mixture of lamb and colored rice.
''Saiydia'' fish steak (tuna or king  fish) and rice.
Shwarma is the snacks in the evening, pita bread and tender grilled lamb meat with Salad

## Drink
There are few places in Aden where you can buy alcoholic drinks. Aden is known for its belly dancing events by overseas dancers (e.g. Iraqis and Syrians), which you can find in many tourist places, including Sheraton Aden, Diplomacy Resort, Bahara, Nashwan, and Hotel Aden.
Fruit juice bars offer very nice, cheap and wholesome drinks.

## Sleep
Aden is the tourist and economic capital of Yemen. You have many chances to purchase alcohol, go to clubs and enjoy a sunset in the high-class hotels. There are many 5-star hotels and numerous others.

## Budget
There are many budget, decent and clean hotels and resorts such as:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cisterns of Tawila, or the Tawila Tanks, is a historic site in Aden, Yemen designed to collect and store the rain that flows down from the Shamsan massif through Wadi Tawila, and to protect the city from periodic flooding. The site consists of a series of tanks of varying shape and capacity. They are connected to one another and located in Wadi Tawila to the southwest of Aden’s oldest district, Crater. Originally there were about 53 tanks, but only 13 remain following a succession of renovations, including those done by the British in the 19th century. The existing tanks have a combined capacity of about nineteen million gallons. The largest of the tanks are the Coghlan Tank at the center of the main site and the large, circular Playfair Tank, located at the lowest point, outside the main site.

History
The tanks were hewn from the volcanic rocks of Wadi Tawila and then lined with a special stucco that included volcanic ash to create a strong, natural cement that rendered the tanks' walls impermeable in order to retain water for extended periods.
Visitors to the Tanks are often surprised by the words on a plaque near the Coghlan Tank: "Regarding the original construction of which nothing is accurately known..." There is indeed little hard evidence and there are few reliable sources of information about the Tanks. One favored hypothesis is that Himyar, a pre-Islamic Arabian kingdom that ruled parts of Yemen from 115 B.C. to 525 A.D., started to build water tanks in the area that eventually became the Cisterns of Tawila. The Himyarites are known to have employed water-catchment tanks in other areas under their rule. The proposed Himyaritic origins of the tanks may help explain a recessed, rectangular area in the Coghlan tank that, according to the Director of the site, could have been used in pre-Islamic times for animal sacrifice (a ritual that the Himyarites were known to perform for a variety of occasions, including drought). 

The Tanks were mentioned in some manuscripts after the coming of Islam to Yemen in the 7th century A.D. "Aden has Tanks that store water when the rain falls", wrote Al-Hamdani in the 10th century. Al-Makdsi, writing three centuries later, also recorded the presence of wells and cisterns in Aden. By the time of the Rasulid dynasty (1229-1454 A.D.), the Tanks had fallen into disrepair. However, the Rassulids recognized the utility of the Tanks and began to restore them. This restoration has led some to claim that the Rassulids built the Tanks, thereby obscuring what are, in all probability, the far more ancient origins of the Tanks. After the Rassulids, the Tanks once again fell into disrepair, damaged by flooding and neglect and filled with the rubble of successive floods.
By the time of the British occupation of Aden (beginning in 1839), the Tanks had been almost completely buried by debris carried down the mountains by successive floods. Sir Robert L. Playfair rediscovered the tanks and recognized their potential value. Aden had no fresh water and was often cut off from mainland water supplies by hostile tribes. Playfair hoped that the Tanks, once repaired, could provide a reliable source of water for public consumption. The British accordingly set out to restore the tanks to their original function. However, in the process, the British modified the design and layout of the Tanks significantly from their original state. With the intention of storing the greatest quantity of water possible, British engineers replaced an intricate network of numerous, small, cascading cisterns along the valley walls with a few, larger tanks. The Tanks' ability to both control floods and store water was thus hampered, and the site that tourists visit today is very much a Victorian British creation. Further, the remodeling destroyed what archaeological evidence might have been present with regards to the original site, and this, coupled with the scarcity of documentary evidence, has made learning more about the Tanks' origins difficult.

Today, the cisterns are primarily a public park and a tourist attraction. They have not been filled for at least fifteen years and do not serve the city's water needs. They may still help with flooding, although the presence of structures in the saila, or flood course, that leads from the Tanks to the sea, impedes the flow of water. No significant restoration work has been conducted on the Tanks since the British colonial era ended in 1967. Time, floods, and visitors have taken their toll on the structures. In addition, construction on the tableland above the Tanks may threaten the entire system of wadis and dams that help channel floodwaters into the Tanks. The future of the Tanks remains uncertain.

صهاريج عدن أو صهاريج الطويلة في مدينة كريتر مديرية صيرة وتحديداً بوادٍ يعرف بوادي الطويلة في امتداد خط مائل من الجهة الشمالية الغربية لمدينة كريتر - عدن، التي تقع أسفل مصبات هضبة عدن المرتفعة حوالي 800 قدم عن سطح البحر.
هي خزانات مياه لتخزين مياه الأمطار لاستخدامها للزراعة وللشرب، وهي أيضاً لحماية مدينة عدن من السيول التي تسبب دماراً كبير حين نزولها كل عام، ولهذا بنيت هذه الصهاريج.
تعد صهاريج عدن من أبرز المعالم التاريخية والسياحية التي يحرص على زيارتها الزوار المحليون والسياح العرب والأجانب القادمون إلى مدينة عدن والتي تدل على عمق الحضارة اليمنية القديمة.
دراسات أثرية حديثة غير مكتملة، ترجح أن الحِمْيَرِيين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمة المعروفة حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابة 13,638,2757 لتر من الماء.

وقد ذكرها الهمداني في كتاب وصف بلاد العرب عدن جنوبية تهامية وهي أقدم أسواق العرب وهي ساحل يحيط به جبل لم يكن فيه طريق فقطع في الجبل باب بزبر الحديد، وصار لها طريقاً إلى البر، ودربا وموردها ماء يقال له الحيق أحساء في رمل في جانب فلاة إرم وبها في ذاتها بؤور ملح وشروب. الهمداني لم يَستخدم لفظة «صهاريج» بالصيغة المعيارية الحديثة، بل وصفها بكلمة «بؤر» (جمع بئر) كلمة بؤر هنا تُستخدم بمعنى جمع بئر.

شكلها
وتأخذ الهضبة شكلاً شبه دائري حيث يقع المصب عند رأس وادي الطويلة، وتتصل الصهاريج بعضها ببعض بشكل سلسلة وقد شيدت في مضيق يبلغ طوله 750قدماً تقريباً، ويحيط بها جبل شمسان بشكل دائري باستثناء منفذ يؤدي ويتصل بمدينة كريتر.

إنشائها
واختلفت المصادر التاريخية في تحديد الوقت الذي تم فيه بناء صهاريج عدن، فلم يجد الدارسون والباحثون الأثريون أي سند أو نقوش أو دلالة تشير إلى تاريخ بنائها.
ولعل ما يلفت النظر وجود لوحة مثبتة على جدار بالقرب من صهريج كوجلان مكتوب عليها «هذه الخزانات في وادي الطويلة مجهول تاريخها».
وكلمة (صهريج) لفظة مستعربة من اللغة الفارسية وتعني: حوض الماء.
الغرض من انشائها
بنيت الصهاريج بغرض معالجة مشكلة شح المياه العذبة في هذه المنطقة البركانية، من خلال إقامة منشآت مائية من آبار وحياض وصهاريج لحفظ مياه الأمطار. وهي تحمي المدينة من الفيضانات الموسمية، بتلقفها السيول من أعالي الهضبة وتخفيف اندفاعاتها وتغذية الآبار الجوفية عبر فتحات خاصة صممت بشكل دائري في قاع كل صهريج.

عددها
قدر الباحثون عدد صهاريج عدن (الطويلة) بنحو 55 صهريجاً معظمها مطمور تحت الأرض أو أصابه الخراب، وما هو قائم منها لا يزيد على 18 صهريجاً فقط تستوعب نحو 20 مليون جالون وتستقبل صهاريج الطويلة سنوياً عشرات الآلاف من الزوار والسياح العرب والأجانب لغرض الإطلاع على مكوناتها المدهشة وخزاناتها ومتحفها.

Sira Fortress/Castle (قلعة صيرة) is a military site in Aden, Yemen.  The original fortress dates to the 11th century, and is still in use today by the Yemeni military.  The fort is located on Sira Island, a rocky and tall volcanic outcropping which dominates the old harbor of Aden. Although it is referred to as a castle quite often, it is less of a castle and more of a fortification. Much of the fort's history is unknown, especially since there have been few archaeological studies done of the area. One theory is that construction was initiated around the year 1173 by a Turkish ruler of Aden named Prince Othman Al-Zangabili Al-Takriti.  The fortress was proven during subsequent attacks against Aden by the Portuguese and especially the Turks in 1517. Although the ancient harbor began to silt up and the primary commercial center eventually moved to the other side of the Aden Peninsula, the British continued to develop and garrison the fortress after their arrival in 1839. It is about a fifteen minute walk up the stairs and can be considered a bit steep. It is one of the most common tourist attractions in the city of Aden.

The Marib Dam (Arabic: سَدّ مَأْرِب Sadd Ma'rib, or سُدّ مَأْرِب Sudd Ma'rib) is a dam blocking wadi Adhanah  (أَذَنَة, also Dhanah ذَنَة) in the Balaq Hills, located in the Ma'rib Governorate in Yemen. The current dam was built in the 1980s and is close to the ruins of the ancient dam, first built in the 8th century BC. It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the Sabaean and Himyarite kingdoms around Ma'rib.
Other important ancient dams in Yemen include the Dam of Jufaynah, the Dam of Khārid, the Dam of Aḑraʾah, the Dam of Miqrān and the Dam of Yathʾān. Historically, Yemen has been recognized for the magnificence of its ancient water engineering. From the Red Sea coast to the limits of the Empty Quarter Desert are numerous ruins of small and large dams made of earth and stone.
In 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Marib Dam was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Ancient dam
The site of the great Dam of Marib, also called the Dam of 'Arim (Arabic: سَدّ ٱلْعَرِم, sadd al-ˁArim), is upstream (south-west) of the ancient city of Maʾrib, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Sheba. The Kingdom of Sabaʾ was a prosperous trading nation, with control of the frankincense and spice routes in Arabia and Abyssinia. The Sabaeans built the dam to capture the periodic monsoon rains which fall on the nearby mountains and so irrigate the land around the city. Some tentative archaeological findings suggest that simple earth dams and a canal network were constructed as far back as around 1750 BC, but the most reliable information dates the Great Dam of Marib to about the 8th century BC. It is counted by some as one of the most wonderful feats of engineering in the ancient world.
The medieval Arab geographer Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī describes it thus:

It is between three mountains, and the flood waters all flow to the one location, and because of that the water only discharges in one direction; and the ancients blocked that place with hard rocks and lead. The water from springs gathers there as well as floodwater, collecting behind the dam like a sea. Whenever they wanted to they could irrigate their crops from it, by just letting out however much water they needed from sluice gates; once they had used enough they would close the gates again as they pleased.

Construction
The date of the first construction of a dam at Ma’rib goes back to somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC. The earliest inscription on the dam is one placed there at the time of its construction or repair of parts of the dam undertaken by Yatha' Amar Watar I, son of Yada' El Zarih I, who reigned in 760–740 BC. The following repair was in the time of Yada' El Bayin II who reigned in 740–720 BC. Renovations were then carried out by Dhamar El Zarih I and Karab El Bayin who reigned in 700–680 BC. All repairs were minor, consisting of essential maintenance, such as removing dirt, opening water courses, or stopping up gaps. The Makrib Samah' El Yanuf II, son of Dhamar El Watar II, had his name carved into parts of the dam to mark the completion and repair of the dam.
The dam was composed of packed earth, triangular in cross section, 580 m (1,900 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 feet) high. It ran between two groups of rocks on either side of the river and was linked to the rock with substantial stonework. The dam's position allowed for a spillway and sluices between the northern end of the dam and the cliffs to the west. Around 500 BC, its height was increased to 7 metres (23 feet), the upstream slope (the water face) was reinforced with a cover of stones, and irrigation was extended to include the southern side as well as the northern side.
After the end of the Kingdom of Sabaʾ, the dam fell under the control of the Ḥimyarites around 115 BC. They undertook further reconstruction, creating a structure 14 metres (46 feet) high, with extensive waterworks at both the northern and southern ends, five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1,000-meter canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalized until 325 AD, and they allowed the irrigation of 100 km2 (25,000 acres).

Maintenance
The Muslim historian al-Isfahani (whose Annals were completed in 961 CE) maintains that a dam breach occurred some 400 years before the rise of Islam, but Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī assigns it to the time of Abyssinian rule.
Ancient South Arabian sources report that in about 145 BC, the dam suffered a major breach during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Sabaʾ, and that is the very breach that many scholars consider to have caused the Sayl al-ˁArim (Arabic: سَيْل ٱلْعَرِم, Flood of the ‘Arim) mentioned in the Quran; it is also mentioned in Arab proverbs which speak about the hands of Sabaʾ having separated at that time. The fighting between the Raydānites and the Sabaeans delayed the repair of the dam, and this caused devastating losses of crops and fruit, leading large numbers of people to disperse in search of new land capable of supporting life, so huge migrations ensued. It is still uncertain though whether it was that particular breach that caused the "flood of ˁArim" or not, since some migrations certainly took place in the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE, and they are also ascribed to the breaking of the Dam of Maʾrib. Generally speaking, the dam was repaired twice shortly before the coming of Islam, once by Sharḥabīl Yaˁfar bin Abī Karab Yasˁad in 450, and by Abrahah in 543. The inscriptions on the dam explain the costs of repair and the large number of workers involved.
The archaeology of the Ma'rib Dam shows the effects of siltation behind dams in antiquity, and measures to extend the operational life of the reservoir. The same problems of siltation encountered in the ancient dam were also faced in the construction of the new dam. Despite the increases in height, the dam suffered numerous breaches (recorded major incidents occurred in 449, 450, 542 and 548) and the maintenance work became increasingly onerous; the last recorded repairs took place in 557.

Final breach
Locals report that the final breach of the dam had been predicted by a king called ʿImrān, who was also a soothsayer, and later by the wife of the king. According to legend, the breach was caused by large rats gnawing at it with their teeth and scratching it with their nails. In 570 or 575, the dam was again overtopped, and this time left unrepaired. The final destruction of the Dam of Maʾrib is alluded to in the Quran (34: 15–17):

لَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَإٍ فِي مَسْكَنِهِمْ آيَةٌ ۖ جَنَّتَانِ عَن يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ ۖ كُلُوا مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ ۚ بَلْدَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ، فَأَعْرَضُوا فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ الْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُم بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِّن سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ
 "There was for [the tribe of] Sabaʾ in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], "Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord. But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees."The consequent failure of the irrigation system provoked the migration of up to 50,000 people from Yemen to other areas of the Arabian Peninsula, and even to the Levant.

Modern dam
A dam was built in the 1980s by Doğuş Group, close to the location of the old one, at the expense of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, whose tribe reportedly resettled from Ma'rib to his country, sometime during the 17th century, or in the 6th century, after the collapse of the historical dam. The opening ceremony took place on 20 December 1986, in the presence of Zayed and Ayhan Şahenk of Doğuş Group. The dam was considered by people inside and outside Yemen to have a positive effect on the agriculture and economy of the region of Ma'rib, and the country in general.

The dam is 38 m (125 ft) high, 763 m (2,503 ft) long, built of earth across the Wadi Dhana at 15°23′47″N 45°14′37″E, creating a storage capacity of 398 million cubic meters. The dam site is located 3 km (1.9 miles) upstream of the ruins of the Great Dam. The new dam, like the old, was designed to store water for irrigating the Ma'rib plains. However, the wadi bed at the new dam site consists of alluvial sand and gravel material 30–50 m (98–164 ft) thick. Seepage that emanates from this dam does not threaten its structure but results in the loss of water. As a way of capturing the seepage, consideration is being given to rebuilding the ancient Ma'rib dam, both as a functioning structure and as a historic monument and tourist attraction. The complexity and volume of work involved in this project make it necessary that several organizations work together under the aegis of UNESCO, using financial contributions from international organizations.  
The dam was damaged in an airstrike in 2015. Yemeni officials said that Saudi Arabian coalition forces were responsible for the airstrike.

سد مأرب: سد مائي يقع في محافظة مأرب اليمنية. المكانة الأيقونية لسد مأرب في شبه الجزيرة العربية قبل الإسلام تعود إلى العديد من العوامل، من بينها أبعاده الضخمة والابتكار. لكن الأهم من ذلك هو أن القرآن الكريم قد أشار إلى انهياره النهائي، ما جعله رمزا من رموز التحولات الكبيرة التي شهدتها المنطقة. ووفق التقارير الألمانية التي دونت عام 2010م، نتيجة القيام بدراسة لمدة 25 عامًا، والحصول على بعض العينات المختلفة من الفحم التي عثر عليه بداخل سد مأرب بواسطة التحليل بالكربون ١٤ المشع، والتي أرجعت تاريخ تلك العينات بناء وتأسيس سد مأرب إلى فترة ما فيما بين 600 ق م و400 ق م على أبعد تقدير، وهذا ما تؤكده نقوش المكربين "سمه علي ينوف بن ذمار علي" وابنه "يثع أمر بين" على الهيكل الجنوبي من السد الكبير.مع ذلك، فإن النقاش حول تأريخ تأسيس السد، لم يُغلق بعد، ويشكك بعض العلماء في المعايير الآثارية الألمانية، حيث يرجعون السد إلى القرن الأول قبل الميلاد على أقصى تقدير.
تشير النقوش السبئية إلى أن تأريخ نظم الري المتطورة في مأرب، متعددة المراحل، وموثقة من خلال عدة نقوش منذ القرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وأبرز من عمل على تحسين الري المكاربة: يثع أمر وتر بن يكرب ملك، وكربئيل وتر بن ذمار علي، ويدع إيل ذريح من سمه علي، والآخير قام بعمل قنوات ري في منطقة أبين، الواحة الشمالية من جنتي مأرب. مع ذلك، فإن السد الكبير يمثل المرحلة الأخيرة، وهو نتاج تراكم خبرات امتدت لأكثر من قرنين من الزمان. تُعدّ الأعمال الهيدروليكية المبكرة التي يُعترف بها حاليًا في موقع السد قد بدأت تحت قيادة مكرب سبأ، سمه علي بنوف ابن ذمار علي، وابنه يثع أمر بين، وذلك في القرنين السادس والخامس قبل الميلاد. فقد تم ذكر حفر مدخل مياه في الصخور على حافة وادي ذنة. ومع ذلك، لا يُمكن الجزم بناءً على البيانات المتاحة ما إذا كان هذا المدخل قد تم حجزه بواسطة سد يمتد عبر مجرى الوادي بالكامل، أو من خلال جدار تحويل بسيط جزئيًا على قاع الوادي. في الوقت الحالي، لا يوجد أي دليل على وجود سد في هذه الفترة المبكرة.
كان طول السد الترابي يبلغ 650 مترًا وارتفاعه 15 مترًا في قاع الوادي، في حين كان عرضه عند قاعدته حوالي 100 متر. ولتفادي الاختراقات المتكررة، تم حماية السد باستخدام أحجار مسطحة مغروسة في سطحه. اليوم، لم يتبقَ منه سوى الثلث الشمالي فقط.

التاريخ
بني السد من حجارة اقتطعت من صخور الجبال، حيث نحتت بدقة، ووضعت فوق بعضها البعض واستخدم الجبس لربط الحجارة المنحوتة ببعضها البعض، واستخدام قضبان أسطوانية من النحاس والرصاص يبلغ طول الواحدة منها ستة عشر متراً، وقطرها حوالي أربع سنتمرات توضع في ثقوب الحجارة فتصبح كالمسمار فيتم دمجها بصخرة مطابقة لها وذلك ليتمكن من الثبات أمام خطر الزلازل والسيول العنيفة. حسب التنقيبات الأثرية، فإن السد تعرض لأربعة انهيارات على الأقل، آخرها كان في العام 575. ولم تبذل جهود لترميمه من ذلك الحين بعد لغياب حكومة مركزية واضطراب الأمن في البلاد وتدخل القوى الأجنبية (الفرس) واستقلال زعماء القبائل بإقطاعياتهم.

بناء السد القديم
هناك اختلاف بين العلماء حول مرحلة بناء سد مأرب العظيم، ووفق أبحاث أثرية حديثة قام بها المعهد الألماني للآثار  عام 2010م، عثر على ستة عينات كربونية بداخل سد مأرب (Marib Dam) تم فحصها بواسطة التحليل كربون-14، وقد ارجعت  أقدم العينات تاريخ بناء سد مأرب فيما بين 600 ق م و400 ق م، وبمتوسط تقديري 500 قبل الميلاد. كما أشارات الدراسة إلى أن هناك ري زراعي بدائي استخدم في جنوب مأرب يعود إلى الألفية الثالثة ق م في عصر ما قبل السبئيين.إلا أن السد الشهير (Marib Dam) نفسه يعود إلى النصف الثاني من الألفية الأولى قبل الميلاد على أبعد تقدير، وفق متوسط ثلاثة عينات من الفحم عثر عليها في سد مأرب بواسطة كربون-14، وجاء جدول دراسة سد مأرب كالآتي:

بقى سد مأرب صامدا يؤدي عمله حتى الربع الثالث من القرن السادس الميلادي، وتعرض السد لعدة تصدعات ولكن نهايته كانت في العام 575 بعد الميلاد لغياب حكومة مركزية واضطراب الأمن في البلاد وتدخل القوى الأجنبية (الفرس) واستقلال زعماء القبائل بإقطاعياتهم.
في القرن السادس والخامس قبل الميلاد، وردت نصوص لمكاربة من السد، تشير إلى أعمال بناء. كان يبلغ طول السد الترابي 650 متراً، وعرضه 100م، وأرتفاعه نحو 15م. وبني في الجهة التي تسيل منها السيول فتمكن السد من حصر الماء وزود بثقوب أو أبواب لتسمح بقدر أكبر من التحكم بجهة المياه عقب استقرارها في الحوض. اُقتطعت حجارة السد من صخور الجبال ونحتت بدقة ووضعت فوق بعضها البعض واستخدم الجبس لربط الحجارة المنحوتة ببعضها البعض واستخدام قضبان أسطوانية من النحاس والرصاص يبلغ طول الواحدة منها ستة عشر مترا وقطرها حوالي أربع سنتمرات توضع في ثقوب الحجارة فتصبح كالمسمار فيتم دمجها بصخرة مطابقة لها وذلك ليتمكن من الثبات أمام خطر الزلازل والسيول العنيفة  كان يروي ما يقارب 24,000 آكر (قرابة 98 كم مربع)  وهو ماعنى أن سكان اليمن حققوا الاكتفاء الذاتي من ناحية احتياجهم للماء والغذاء، فالماء الناتج عن السد القديم كان يكفيهم للزراعة وإطعام مواشيهم.
ويعتبر سد مأرب من أرقى السدود من الناحية الهندسية. وقد قام المهندسون بمعاينة طبيعة الأرض قبل إنشاء السد، ثم بنوا عليها المخطط الهندسي الذي هو عبارة عن حائط حجري ضخم أقيم في مربط الدم عند مخرج السيل من الوادي، وبني على زاوية منفرجة، ممتدًا من الجنوب إلى الشمال مسافة ستمائة وخمسين مترًا، وله فتحات وأبواب تُفتح وتُغلق حسب الحاجة لمرور الماء منها المسايل المتصلة بها لإرواء الحقول والبساتين والمزارع.

تهدم السد
أول ثغرة موثقة مؤكدة حدثت لسد مأرب خلال الربع الثالث من القرن الرابع الميلادي تقريبًا، وقد جرت أعمال الإصلاح تحت سلطة الحميريين في عهد الملكين ثأران يهنعم وابنه ملكي كرب يهأمن (النقش: Ja 671+788).
ثم حدثت ثغرتان في عامي 454م و455م، أصلحهما الملك شُرَحبئيل يعفر. (النقشان: CIH 540; Gar Sharahbil A).
لاحقاً أصلح الملك أبرهة ثغرة جديدة في 547- 548م (النقشان: CIH 541, DAI GDN 2002-20).
يشير نقش لإتحاد ذو همدان إلى أعمال ترميم للسد، مؤرخ بأواخر العام 558م من عهد الملك أبرهة (النقش: Ja 547+544+546+545).
أدت ثغرة أخيرة إلى هجر نظام الري، يرى باحثون أنها المذكورة في سورة سبأ من القرآن الكريم: ﴿لَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَإٍ فِي مَسْكَنِهِمْ آيَةٌ جَنَّتَانِ عَنْ يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ كُلُوا مِنْ رِزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ بَلْدَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ ۝١٥ فَأَعْرَضُوا فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ الْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُمْ بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِنْ سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ ۝١٦﴾ [سبأ:15–16]
ترتب على ذلك فشل نظام الري، ما أدى لهجرة ما يصل إلى 50,000 شخصاُ من اليمن إلى مناطق أخرى من شبه الجزيرة العربية.

السد الحديث
في 2 أكتوبر 1984م تم وضع حجر الأساس للسد، وفي أواخر 1986م أعلن رئيس دولة الإمارات الراحل الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان تبرعه بإعادة بناء وتأهيل وتوسيع سد مأرب، وفي عام 2003م بدأ العمل في المرحلة الثانية من مشروع قنوات إعادة تأهيل سد مأرب بطول 69 كيلو متراً بتكلفة بلغت 23 مليون و910 آلاف دولار أمريكي بتمويل من صندوق أبو ظبي للتنمية.

مواصفات السد
تبلغ مساحة بحيرة السد 30 كيلومتر مربع، ويسع 400 مليون متر مكعب من الماء، فيما تعمل بوابة التصريف الخاصة به بطاقة قدرها 35 مترا مكعبا في الثانية وذلك لري حوالي 16 ألف هكتار من الأراضي الزراعية، ويبلغ عمق الجسم الخرساني للسد 60 مترا ومساحته 24 ألف متر مربع وطوله 763 مترا وعرضه عند مستوى سطح الوادي 337 مترا، وعند مخرج المياه من بوابة التصريف 195 مترا كما بلغ إجمالي حجم الردميات في جسم السد 3 ملايين متر مكعب، وأُزيلت 200 ألف متر مكعب من الصخور من جانبي الموقع وتغطية جسم السد بصخور بلغ حجمها 100 ألف متر مكعب.
في أغسطس 2020 شهد السد فيضان المياه من الأماكن المخصصة لذلك وهي المرة الأولى التي تتجاوز كمية المياه السعة القصوى للسد منذ إعادة بنائه قبل 34 عاماً، حيث تجاوز منسوب المياه حاجز الـ 550 مليون متر مكعب.

الحرب الأهلية 2015
قالت اليونسكو إنها تلقت معلومات عن أضرار لحقت بجدران «سد مأرب القديم» في 31 مايو 2015، إثر غارة جوية لطيران التحالف الذي ينفذ العمليات العسكرية ضد الحوثيين، لكن مصادر قبلية أكدت لبي بي سي عدم صحة الأنباء التي تحدثت عن تعرض سد مأرب للقصف وتحدثت عن تعمد الحوثيين والقوات الموالية لعلي عبد الله صالح نصب منصة صواريخ كاتيوشا في أعلى السد لقصف مدينة مأرب ومواقع المقاومة إلا أن السد لم يتعرض لغارات جوية.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Temple of Awwam (Arabic: معبد أوام, Sabaean: 𐩱𐩥𐩣), commonly known as Mahram Bilqis (Arabic: محرم بلقيس, romanized: Mḥrm blqīs, lit. 'Sanctuary of the Queen of Sheba') by locals, was the main Sabaean temple dedicated to their national god, Almaqah (frequently called "Lord of ʾAwwām"), and it is also the largest known temple complex in South Arabia, located near Marib in what is now Yemen. The temple is situated 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of ancient Marib, and was built in the outskirts of the city. Although usually major Sabaean sanctuaries are located outside urban centers, its placement was probably for reasons of religious privacy, and to facilitate the conduct of rituals by arriving pilgrims from remote areas of Sabaean territories. Nearly a thousand inscriptions have been discovered from the Temple, comprising the single most important collection of Ancient South Arabian inscriptions that provide the foundation for reconstructing an outline of the political history of Yemen in its first three centuries of the Christian era.
The temple was in operation from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC until the 4th century AD. Pilgrim rites began at the Harunum Temple, before moving to the Awwam Temple through a processional road connecting the two temples.
In 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Awam Temple was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Archaeology
The oldest inscription found in the complex was in reference to the building of the temple's massive enclosure known as The great wall of Awwam by  Mukarrib Yada`'il Dharih I in the middle of the 7th century BCE. Indicating a much earlier period for the temple's construction. Yada`'il inscription was carved outside the wall, and contains the following:

Yadaʿʾil Dharih, son of Sumhuʾalay, mukarrib of Saba', walled ʾAwwam, the temple of Almaqah, when he sacrificed to Athtar and [when] he established the whole community [united] by a god and a patron and a pact and a [secret] trea[ty. By Athtar and by Hawbas and by] Almaqah.
The largest part of the temple is occupied by an unguarded yard that is enclosed by a stone wall with an irregular oval ground plan. On the inner wall of the hall were several dozen highly important inscriptions from the late period of the Sabaean kingdom.
Partial excavation of Awwam peristyle in 1951–1952 by the American Foundation for the Study of Man that was led by Wendell Philips, cleared the entrance court almost completely and made numerous discoveries. Such as elaborate bronze statues, and the usage of the southern entrance in the elliptic wall for ablution rituals before entering the cella.

General plan of Awwam temple
The temple is situated in isolated site functioning mainly as religious sacred area. The place-name, 'wm (place of refuge), signify that sacredness attached to the sanctuary. There is a possibility that the temple developed from a small shrine into an enormous complex encompassing multiple structures associated with the temple i.e. houses for priests, auxiliary rooms, workshops for metalworkers, cemetery connected to the sanctuary, and a residential area which form the so-called protected enclave. Geomorphological investigations have shown that the Awwam temple was erected on high natural platform, making it even more impressive for the viewers.
Access to the complex was controlled by doors leading to hierarchical series of courtyards and halls that served as transitional areas.
The temple itself was oriented towards the rising sun (north-east) and consisted of eight pillars propylaeum marking the entrance, followed by large rectangular peristyle hall, and massive oval shaped enclosure with other exterior linked structures (nearby cemetery). Pillars are the most widespread architectural feature used in ancient South Arabian religious structures. The peristyle hall might have reflected the numbers of the 8 pillared propylaeum; There are 32 pillars (4 × 8) inside the peristyle hall, and 64 recessed false windows (8 × 8).
Statues of bronze bulls, horses, and humans used to be attached to the entrance gates of the temple. Many aspects of the decoration, geometrical and figural paintings, sculptures, large and precisely dressed stones, finely carved inscriptions painted red, and beautiful ornamental friezes on the wall's exterior, were meant to impress visitors and fill them with awe in the presence of god.

The peristyle hall
The hall has a semi-rectangular form, with a pillared 8 monolith propylaeum entrance, topped by square tenons designed to accommodate an architrave. The perimeter of the peristyle hall is approximately 42 m × 19 m and is flanked by the end of the oval-shaped enclosure in its western and eastern exterior walls. The interior of the structure contains a large library of inscribed stone blocks and 64 vertically double false windows motif with 32 pillars made from single monolith except two that once supported stone beams.
The number 8 seems to reflect a sacred number, since it is used at the entrance, interior pillars (8 × 4), and false windows (8 × 8). Ancient South Arabian buildings, including Awwam peristyle hall, appears to be pre-planned according to a system of prescribed measurements instead of full use of space. AFSM excavation in the paved courtyard revealed multiple South Arabian inscriptions, a group of broken column capitals, bronze plaques, altars, and numerous pottery statues, along with potsherds that date back roughly to 1500–1200 BCE.
Visitors of the sanctuary are obliged to go through the annex, then via a gate of three entrances into the peristyle hall. The gate could be closed if needed.
A visible water conduit made from alabaster used to run through the hall and into a bronze basin (69 × 200 cm) placed in a room for purification purposes. The water fell on the floor like a fountain, and it fell so long and with such force that it eventually cut through a copper basin placed under and then into the stone itself.

The oval shaped enclosure
The enclosure is defined by massive oval shaped wall that flank the peristyle hall from its western and eastern wings, the wall measures approximately 757 m long and 13 m high, however the original height can't be determined for certainty, and it's difficult to assess its full extent.
Many inscriptions, hundreds in quantity, were discovered in the sanctuary and nearby, only few that deals directly with the temple's construction. One of the terms used for the sanctuary was "gwbn"; the oracle sanctuary. The sanctuary includes a raised platform within the temple's sacred area representing primordial mound, which makes it more impressive when looked from a distance. It appears, from archeological investigation, that a cultic place was built around a wellspring inside the sanctuary.
The oval sanctuary is accessible from two gates, either through the northwestern gate, or from the peristyle hall one, the latter of which was the main entrance, while the former was exclusively built for priests. A third gate was discovered by AFSM, but  this was restricted to funerary rites usage as it was the cemetery entrance, and could only be accessed from the interior of the oval sanctuary.
The oval sanctuary precinct was the main and holy part of Awwam temple. It was an open space that contains several structures, courtyards, and wellspring. Most rituals were performed in the oval sanctuary, and according to Sabaean inscriptions, was the house of Almaqah. This holiness is demonstrated by the existence of three places for purification and to perform ablutions before entering the sacred spaces, primarily the oval sanctuary (dwelling house of Almaqah). Cleanness is emphasized by the discovered inscriptions that deals with physical and spiritual purity of worshipers. Several inscriptions attest that an individual who enter the sanctuary without performing purification rituals, will suffer severe consequences. Although no detailed information concerning the act of purification is mentioned in Sabaean inscriptions.

The 7th century BCE cemetery is attached to the Oval Sanctuary, and apparently accessed only from it. The cemetery hosts around 20,000 estimated burials during its long period of usage. That lengthy period created a large settlement of the dead, where passages and streets divide the tombs. The cemetery tombs were multi-storey structures (up to four) built using excellently polished and dressed limestone blocks. External walls were sometimes decorated with friezes and low relief of the dead's face.
According to South Arabian inscriptions the cemetery was known as "Mhrm Gnztn" (cemetery sacred enclave). Despite the sacredness of the cemetery, no surplus of epigraphic remains for the ritual ceremonies were found in the complex. Apparently the rituals were conducted in the Oval Sanctuary Precinct, then they enter the cemetery where further ceremonies took place before burial.
The memory of the dead was preserved by placing sculptural representations of them on their tombs, frequently inscribing their names.

Pilgrimage
The Awwam Temple was the most important site of pilgrimage in pre-Islamic Yemen, centered around the god Almaqah. The communal pilgrimage may have lasted between eight and ten days and it took place in the month of Dhu-Abhay (corresponding to February/March), the same month that Muhammad's Farewell Pilgrimage occurred in. Alongside the annual and communal pilgrimage, pilgrims could also conduct an ordinary visit to the Temple at any time of the year. These two rites have been compared to the Islamic Hajj and Umrah respectively. 
The Awwam Temple, like other pre-Islamic Yemeni temples was also associated with a sacred space known as a ḥaram or maḥram (“precinct, protected area, sacred household”). The temple was called bayt ("house, resident"). Some inscriptions call the Awwam Temple the byt ʾlmqh, "House of Almaqah". This is comparable to how the Kaaba is called al-Bayt al-Ḥarām, "the sacred house" in the Quran (5:2).
The pilgrimage rite to the Awwam Temple was considered obligatory in the Kingdom of Saba, to the point that the statue of the god Ta'lab of the Sum'ay tribe, the focus of another major Sabaean pilgrimage, directed its visitors to also perform the Awwam pilgrimage. The ceremonial procession appears to have begun at Ḥarūnum Temple before making its way to Awwam through a processional road that connected the two temples. The main entry site into the Awwam Temple for worshipers was through the west side of the complex and was controlled by a set of gates. Many inscriptions composed by worshipers and participants of the pilgrimage have been found, where Almaqah is thanked for allowing successful childbirth, or prayers are made for the birth of a son, or requests are made for protection from bad luck, harm, mischief, and more. The authors of these texts included both men and women. It appears that the management and feeding of pilgrims was managed by several personnel, including administrators and priests. Personnel were also involved in ensuring the safety of the pilgrims on the roads to the site. 
A number of policies appear to have been put into place in order to maintain the sanctity and purity of the Awwam Temple during pilgrimage. One was a ban on bringing animals into the temple, and any violations of this rule would have been met with fines that had to be paid to the king. Texts indicate that a requirement for pilgrims was that they be in a state of ritual purity upon entrance of sacred sites (and fines were also distributed for violating these). Achieving a state of purity was a multi-step process, facilitated by several rooms in the temple, including ritual washings (ablutions). Other Sabaic inscriptions offer information about how ritual purity was understood in Saba: certain foods had to be avoided, sexual intercourse had to be avoided for a few days, weapons (and related behavior) could not be carried, and so on. More detailed rules and regulations are known from other pilgrimage rituals in the Sabaean kingdom, especially the statue of the god Ta'lub in Marib, which might indirectly offer a better understanding for pilgrimage rites and rituals at Awwam. 
Recent discoveries suggest that a Maʿlaṣ festival was included among the ceremonies of the pilgrimage. Little about it is known, but the festival may be related to fertility or harvest, and not performing it was considered an offence.
A few temple hymns have been found, most importantly in the inscription Zaid Inan 11. One site at the complex was reserved for animal sacrifice, and sacrifices to Almaqah were performed on the seventh of the month of Dhu-Abhay (potentially analogous to the Islamic rites of ʿīd al-aḍḥā and ayyām at-tashrīq). Several dozen inscriptions describe the role of the Awwan Temple as an oracle temple. Spaces were reserved with communication with the oracle including a shrine inside the Sacred Sanctuary Precinct. Rooms were also present in this shrine for pilgrims to sleep where they would receive dreams sent by the oracle (a practice widely attested in the Near East that is called incubation). The oracle represented the manifestation of the god Almaqah. Circumambulation may have taken place, but no concrete evidence exists for this as of yet.

Barāqish or Barāgish or Aythel (Arabic: براقش) is a town in north-western Yemen, 120 miles to the east of Sanaa in al Jawf Governorate on a high hill. It is located in Wādī Farda(h), a popular caravan route because of the presence of water. It was known to the Greeks and Romans as Athlula (or Athrula), from the ancient Sabaean yθl (probably vocalized Yathill).
Barāqish was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age, one generation building their houses on the ruins of the earlier ones. In the main area of the site, there still remain the ruins of a dome, a mosque, a well and tower, as well as many pottery shards and pieces of glass. People lived in the town up to the 1960s, but it has since been abandoned, and is at present occupied by the military.

History and Archaeology
History
Its origins are very archaic, possibly 1000 BCE, but it reached its peak of importance in about 400 BCE when it became the capital of the Minaean Kingdom.
Paleolithic ceramic finds indicate the area was inhabited from at least the 10th century BC.
The city itself was dominated by Saba in the 6th century BC. and is mentioned in a document of Yitha'amar Bayyin II, mentioning a rebellion in the city. 
The Minaean kingdom eventually established itself in the 5th century BC, and the city is cited in a document dated to 343 BC. However, the Minean kingdom was recaptured by the Saba kingdom in the 2nd century BC.
The city was the capitol of the Minaean kingdom until they shifted their capital to Qarnāwu at some time. However, and Yathill remained a sort of religious center for them.
Under the Minean kingdom it was an important stop on the incense route. The ancient city of Yathill was surrounded by a wall 14 meters high, much of which is still visible today; this wall had 57 towers and two gates. Inscriptions mention that the wall was rebuilt by the Sabaeans in 450 BCE. 
The city was retaken by the Saba in the 2nd century BC.
The city was taken by the Romans under Aelius Gallus, Augustus's general. They left quickly, however, due to disease and poor water. According to Strabo and Cassius Dio, Gallus was under orders from Augustus to quell tribes to the north. The tomb of a Roman cavalryman, P. Cornelius, has been found there.
The city was taken by Hadhramaut in 242.

Archaeology
The ruins of a temple in the southern part of the city are considered by archaeologist to have been dedicated to the god Athtar. There is a necropolis near this temple, which contains numerous grave stelae.  The temple is very typical of the Minaean style and consists of 16 columns and beams. There are also a number of ancient inscriptions in the South Arabian alphabet through the city.
There is another temple in the center of the city but only four of its columns are still erect.
The city is mentioned in a number of Minaean language temple stelae across southern Arabia.
From 1989-90 and 2003-07, a team of Italian archaeologists excavated a temple with its roof intact in Baraqish. Inside they found a number of stone tables or altars with bulls' heads at each end, which are believed to have been a sanctuary to a god of healing.
In 2015, the city was reported as being badly destroyed when the Saudi Arabian military, supported by the US and Britain, bombed the site of Baraqish, which was occupied by Houthi forces.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socotra, locally known as Saqatri, is a Yemeni island in the Indian Ocean. Situated between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea near major shipping routes. The largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago, it comprises around 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies 380 kilometres (205 nautical miles) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 232 km (125 nmi) east of the Horn of Africa. The inhabitants of the island are called Socotrans, and they speak Arabic and Soqotri. 
Socotra is home to a high number of unique species that are endemic. Up to a third of its plant life is unique. Due to the island's unusual geography, it has been described as "the most alien-looking place on Earth". The island measures 132 km (82 mi) in length and 42 km (26 mi) across at its widest. In 2008, Socotra was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The island is under the control of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), "secessionist" faction in Yemen's ongoing civil war. The STC seized control of the island following a coup in 2020, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own governance.

Etymology
Scholars' views vary regarding the origin of the island's name. One theory is that the term Socotra may derive from a Greek name that is derived from the name of a South Arabian tribe mentioned in Sabaic and Ḥaḍraumitic inscriptions as Dhū-Śakūrid (s³krd). Another theory is that the Arabic term Suqutra broken down as follows: Suq, means market, and qutra is a vulgar form of qatir, which refers to dragon's blood. The capital city of Socotra was Suq as reported by the Portuguese in the 16th century, which they referred to as market place.

History
Prehistory
There was initially an Oldowan lithic culture in Socotra. Oldowan stone tools were found in the area around Hadibo in 2008. Socotra played an important role in the ancient international trade and appears as Dioskouridou (Διοσκουρίδου νῆσος), meaning "the island of  Dioscurides" in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a first-century AD Greek navigation aid.
The Hoq Cave contains a large number of inscriptions, drawings and archaeological objects. Further investigation showed that these had been left by sailors who visited the island between the first century BC and the sixth century AD. The texts are written in the Indian Brāhmī, South Arabian, Ethiopic, Greek, Palmyrene and Bactrian languages. This corpus of nearly 250 texts and drawings constitutes one of the main sources for the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in that time period.

Antiquity
In 880, an Aksumite expeditionary force conquered the island, and an Oriental Orthodox bishop was consecrated. The Ethiopians were later dislodged by a large armada sent by Imam Al-Salt bin Malik of Oman. According to the Persian geographer Ibn al-Mujawir, who testifies having arrived in Socotra from India in 1222, there were two groups of people on the island, the indigenous mountain dwellers and the foreign coastal dwellers. There were large settlements of Indian traders from Sindh and Balochistan.
Ibn Hawqal, a 10th-century history chronicler, mentions Socotra in his book The Renaissance of Islam. He mentioned it as a prominent source of piracy, stating:  "the island Socotra in particular was regarded as a dangerous nest of pirates, at which people trembled as they passed it. It was the point d'appui of the Indian pirates who ambushed the Believers there."

Middle ages
In 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed at Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle against the Mahra Sultanate. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to India. The lack of a proper harbor and the infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison, and the Portuguese abandoned the island in 1511. The Mahra sultans took back control of the island, and the inhabitants were converted to Islam.

Modern
In 1834, the East India Company stationed a garrison on Socotra, in the expectation that the Mahra sultan of Qishn and Socotra would accept an offer to sell the island. The lack of good anchorages proved to be as much a problem for the British as the Portuguese. The sultan refused to sell, and the British left in 1835. After the capture of Aden by the British in 1839, they lost interest in acquiring Socotra. In 1886, the British government decided to conclude a protectorate treaty with the sultan in which he promised this time to "refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government". In October 1967, in the wake of the departure of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate was abolished. 
On 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of South Yemen. Between 1976 and 1979, the island served as a base for the Soviet Navy. Although the South Yemeni government and president, Ali Nasir Muhammad, had denied their existence. Slavery in the island was abolished under the rule of the Yemeni Socialist Party.
Since Yemeni unification in 1990, Socotra has been a part of the Republic of Yemen, affiliated first to Aden Governorate. Then in 2004, it was moved to be a part of the Hadhramaut Governorate. Later in 2013, it became a governorate of its own.
Socotra was impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which damaged 40 fishing boats, even though the island was 4,600 km (2,858 mi) away from the tsunami epicentre off the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia. In 2015, the cyclones Chapala and Megh struck the island, causing severe damage to its infrastructure.
Beginning in 2015, the UAE began increasing its presence on Socotra, first with humanitarian aid in the wake of tropical cyclones Chapala and Megh, and eventually establishing a military presence on the island. On 30 April 2018, the UAE, as part of the ongoing Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen, landed troops on the island and took control of Socotra Airport and seaport. On 14 May 2018, Saudi troops were also deployed on the island, and a deal was brokered between the UAE and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of the airport and seaport to Yemen. In June 2020, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the island in a coup, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own government. Although in 2023, the Presidential Leadership Council, Yemen's internationally-recognized government, integrated the STC into the government and recognized the STC's rule of the archipelago. Under its rule, peaceful protests against the coup and the UAE's interference in Socotra were violently dispersed, and journalists who criticized the coup were arrested and beaten.

Geography
Socotra is one of the most isolated landforms on Earth of continental origin (i.e. not of volcanic origin). The archipelago was once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana and detached during the Miocene epoch, in the same set of rifting events that opened the Gulf of Aden to its northwest. The island is culturally and administratively a part of Yemen, but it geographically belongs to Africa as it represents a continental fragment that is geologically linked to the Somali Plate.
The archipelago consists of the main island of Socotra (3,665 km2 or 1,415 sq mi), three smaller islands, Abd al Kuri, Samhah and Darsa, and two rocky islets, Ka'l Fir'awn and Sābūnīyah, both uninhabitable by humans but important for seabirds. The island is about 125 kilometres (78 mi) long and 45 kilometres (28 mi) north to south. The distance from Socotra to Cape Guardafui, its nearest point in the African mainland, is 232 km (125 nmi), and about 351 km (190 nmi) from Ras Fartaq in mainland Arabia. It has three major physical regions:

The narrow coastal plains with its characteristic dunes, formed by monsoon winds blowing during three summer months. The wind takes up the coast sand in a spiral and, as a result, forms the snow-white Socotran sand dunes.
The limestone plateaus of Momi, Homhil and Diksam with its characteristic karst topography based on limestone rock areas intersected with inter-hill plains. For centuries until recently Socotra's main economic activity was subsistent transhumant animal husbandry, predominantly goats and sheep on these plateaus. The outcome is a unique and still active cultural landscape of agro-pastoralism with its characteristic rainwater harvesting systems.
A central massif, the Hajhir Mountains, composed of granite and metamorphic rocks. rising to 1,503 metres (4,931 ft).

Climate
The climate of Socotra is classified in the Köppen climate classification as BWh and BSh, meaning a transitional hot desert climate and a semi-desert climate with a mean annual temperature over 25 °C (77 °F). Yearly rainfall is light but is roughly spread throughout the year. Orographic lift provided by the interior mountains, especially during the northeast monsoon from October to December, results in the highest inland areas averaging as much as 800 millimetres (31.50 in) per year and receiving over 250 millimetres (9.84 in) per month during November and December. The southwest monsoon season from June to September brings strong winds and high seas. 
In an extremely unusual occurrence, the normally arid western side of Socotra received more than 410 millimetres (16.14 in) of rain from Cyclone Chapala in November 2015. Cyclones rarely affect the island, but in 2015 Cyclone Megh became the strongest, and only, major cyclone to strike the island directly.

Endemism
The Socotra archipelago has been dubbed the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean due to its ecological diversity and high rates of endemism. It has 835 vascular plant species, of which 37% are endemic. Six bird species, 95% of its terrestrial molluscs, and 90% of its reptiles are endemic to the archipelago. A 2016 genetic survey of all Socotran reptiles revealed unexpectedly high levels of cryptic diversity, indicating that the island's actual reptile diversity may be greater than currently recognized. Socotra is home to several native mammals, none of which are endemic.

Endemic species
Due to the dry conditions and small size of the island, its fauna tend to be small.
The island has several native bats and shrews, including the Etruscan shrew, which is the smallest mammal in the world by mass. Socotra is of particular interest to ornithologists. The island has been designated an endemic bird area.
Some of the island's most striking species are its endemic plants and trees. Socotra has many native drought resistant plants which have adapted to the island's arid environment by developing large, bulbous stems in which they store their water.  One notable example is Dendrosicyos socotranus (cucumber tree) which is the only tree in the Cucurbitaceae family. This species, which can grow over six meters high, has specialized cells which expand to hold water during wet periods.
Due to the island's long arid periods, several endemic flora have developed an evolutionary strategy of longevity,  prioritizing long individual life span over reproduction.  These endemic flora are found in dry, low-lying areas of the island, and they grow slowly and rarely fruit or flower. These slow-growing endemic species are particularly vulnerable to climate warming, as increasing dry periods may prevent them from reproducing. One example is the Dragon's Blood Tree, or Dracaena cinnabari, which may be the most well known example of Socotran endemism. The tree contains a bright red sap which is used commercially. D. cinnabari has a very distinct appearance: its trunk branches out into an umbrella-like crown with tightly packed leaves and widespread branches. This plant structure is observed in arid climates which have atmospheric moisture. Tightly packed leaves and wide spread branches facilitate the condensation of water from moisture in the air, and the shade provided by the umbrella crown may prevent evaporation of moisture from the soil. One dragon's blood forest remains on the island. The average age of these trees is approximately 300 years. This suggests that the forest is over-mature, and indicates a decline in new growth.

Evolution
Socotra's high rates of species diversity and endemism can be attributed to a long period of isolation, as well as extreme climatic conditions which vary spatially and depending on altitude.  These conditions have created a variety of ecological niches.  Researchers have attempted to date the origins of endemic species in convergence with the geological timeline of the island, which may help discern instances of vicariant speciation after the island split off from the mainland.
Plant life on Socotra shares floristic similarities with northeast Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The genus Dirachma has two species – one is native to Socotra and the other is native to Somalia, over 1000 km away. These species share unique traits, including eight-part flowers. Several of the island's endemic species (members of the Echidnopsis genus, for example) are thought to have evolved from a single colonizing ancestor.  Once the colonizing ancestor was cut off from its original gene pool its descendents began to diversify rapidly.
The most ecologically diverse parts of Socotra are its wet refugia, such as its cliffs and escarpments. These areas receive significantly more rainfall and mist than the rest of the island. These isolated areas in numerous separate areas on the island have allowed for speciation to occur. Species in the refugia are twice as likely to be endemic as species on the rest of the island. The refugia are particularly sensitive to changes in the climate, and have probably expanded and retracted many times over the evolutionary history of the island. The largest wet refugium on the island is the Hajhir massif. Incredibly, fifty five of the endemic species on the mountains are endemic to that particular refugium.

Current ecological threats
Socotra has been experiencing a steady decline of vegetation and floral species diversity over the past several decades. These flora are vital for the survival of endemic fauna. Several factors, such as erosion, extreme weather events, and overgrazing may be responsible for this decline.  Intensified winds due to rising global temperatures threaten Socotra's old growth forests. Traditional land management which has been practiced by indigenous people on Socotra for thousands of years, is becoming less widespread as the island becomes more influenced by the outside world. Increasing populations of invasive species, such as rats and cats, also threaten the endemic flora and fauna. Species on socotra have evolved in very particular climatic conditions, and their ranges are very restricted. This makes them highly vulnerable to climate change. Without intervention, many of the island's endemic species may face extinction, including potentially numerous cryptic species that have yet to be formally described.

Demographics
Most of the inhabitants are indigenous Soqotri people from Al-Mahrah tribe, who are of Southern Arabian descent from Al Mahrah Governorate, and are said to be especially closely related with the Qara and Mahra groups of Southern Arabia. Some of the inhabitants are African, descending from former slaves who settled on the island. The majority of male residents on Socotra are reported to be in the J* subclade of Y-DNA haplogroup J. Several of the female lineages, notably those in mtDNA haplogroup N, are unique to the island.
Almost all inhabitants of Socotra, numbering about 50,000, live on the main island of the archipelago. The principal city, Hadibu (with a population of 8,545 at the census of 2004); the second largest town, Qalansiyah (population 3,862); and Qād̨ub (population 929) are all located on the north coast of the island of Socotra. Only about 450 people live on 'Abd-al-Kūrī and 100 on Samha; the island of Darsa and the islets of the archipelago are uninhabited.

Language
The island is home to the Semitic language Soqotri, which is related to such other Modern South Arabian languages on the Arabian mainland as Mehri, Harsusi, Bathari, Shehri, and Hobyot, which became the subject of European academic study in the nineteenth century.
There is an ancient tradition of poetry and a poetry competition is held annually on the island. The first attested Socotran poet is believed to be the ninth-century Fatima al-Suqutriyya, a popular figure in Socotran culture. Socotra Swahili is extinct.

Religion
The earliest account concerning the presence of Christians in Socotra stems from the early-medieval 6th century AD Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes Later the Socotrans joined the Assyrian church. During the 10th century, Arab geographer Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani recorded during his visits that most of the islanders were Christian.
Christianity went into decline when the Mahra Sultanate took power in the 16th century, and the populace had become mostly Muslim by the time the Portuguese arrived later that century. An 1884 edition of Nature writes that the disappearance of Christian churches and monuments can be accounted for by a Wahhabi excursion to the island in 1800. Today the only remnants of Christianity are some cross engravings from the first century CE, a few Christian tombs, and some church ruins.

Transport
Public transport on Socotra is limited to a few minibuses; car hire usually means hiring a 4WD car and a driver. Transport is a delicate matter on Socotra as road construction is considered locally to be detrimental to the island and its ecosystem. In particular, damage has occurred via chemical pollution from road construction while new roads have resulted in habitat fragmentation.
The only port on Socotra is 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of Hadibu. Ships connect the port with the Yemeni coastal city of Mukalla. The journey takes 2–3 days, and the service is used mostly for cargo. The UAE funded the modernization of the port on Socotra. 
Yemenia and Felix Airways flew from Socotra Airport to Sana'a and Aden via Riyan Airport. As of March 2015, due to ongoing civil war involving Saudi Arabia's Air Force, all flights to and from Socotra were cancelled. During the deployment of Emirati troops and aid to the Island, multiple flight connections were made between Abu Dhabi and Hadibu as part of Emirati effort to provide Socotra residents with access to free healthcare and provide work opportunities. Currently, there are weekly scheduled flights from Cairo and Abu Dhabi to Socotra.

Tourism
Among 19th-century visitors to the island came British celebrity explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent, and their party, from mid December 1896 to mid February 1897.
Prior to the construction of the Socotra airport, the island could only be reached by a cargo ship. The ideal time to visit Socotra is from October to April; the remaining months usually have heavy monsoon rainfall, making it difficult for tourists; flights also usually get cancelled. The island lacks any well-established hotels, although there are a few guesthouses for travelers to stay during their short visits. The island received over 1,000 tourists each year until 2014, which has since been affected by the civil war.
Tourism to the island has increased over the years as many operators have begun offering trips to the island, which Gulf Today claimed "will become a dream destination despite the country's conflict". In May 2021, the Ministry of Information stated that the UAE is violating the island and has been planning to control it for years, running illegal trips there for foreign tourists without obtaining any permission from the Yemeni government.

Socotra ou Socotora (en arabe et en langue mehri : سقطرى, soqotra) est une île du Yémen située en mer d'Arabie, non loin de l'entrée orientale du golfe d'Aden.
Elle se trouve à 234 kilomètres au large du cap Guardafui, qui constitue l'extrémité nord-est de la Somalie, et à 352 kilomètres au sud-est des côtes du gouvernorat d'Al Mahrah, au Yémen. Elle est la plus grande île de l'archipel de Socotra composé, outre Socotra, d'Abd al Kuri, Darsah, Samhah et des îlots rocheux de Sabuniyah et Ka'l Firawn. Socotra mesure 133 kilomètres de longueur et une quarantaine de kilomètres de largeur, pour une superficie de 3 579 km2.
En raison de sa biodiversité et de la présence de quelque 700 espèces uniques au monde, elle est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco au sein de l'archipel de Socotra et a été déclarée réserve de biosphère en 2003 par l'Unesco.

Histoire
Selon Edresi, géographe arabe du XIIe siècle, Alexandre le Grand, incité par Aristote, y aurait installé une colonie ionienne après avoir conquis l'Égypte.
Dans Le Périple de la mer Érythrée datant du Ier siècle, l'île est nommée Dioscoride (Dioscoridis Insula, signifiant en koinè île des Dioscures). Elle est décrite comme grande, semi-déserte et marécageuse, et possédant quelques rivières. La faune est composée de serpents, de grands lézards et de tortues. Ses habitants, (chrétiens nestoriens d'après le texte apocryphe des Actes de Thomas du IIIe siècle), sont un mélange d'Arabes, de Grecs et d'Indiens, pêcheurs et marins. Ils sont peu nombreux et vivent sur la côte septentrionale. Des ermites vivent dans les haghiers (creux dans le grès) du sud de l'île.
Vers 520, l'île est un comptoir égypto-byzantin qui commerce avec les chrétiens du Kerala, en Inde, en contournant l'empire Perse, ennemi des Byzantins.
En 1505, alors en expansion dans l'océan Indien et la mer Rouge, le Portugal y fonde un comptoir commercial. L'île sert de base aux Portugais pour défier les Mamelouks d’Égypte et rançonner les boutres marchands arabes. Par la suite, le comptoir est disputé par les Hollandais. Après avoir été pendant quelque temps un repaire de pirates, l'île passe en 1886 sous domination anglaise et intégrée jusqu'en 1967 au protectorat du Somaliland. Sa population est intégralement islamisée à partir de ce moment.
De 1967 à 1990, l'archipel de Socotra est revendiqué à la fois par la Somalie et le Yémen du Sud communiste, et l'île accueille une petite base militaire qui sert d'escale à la marine soviétique. Les conditions maritimes et météorologiques (embruns et vents de sable) dégradent les équipements électroniques rapidement et l'escale soviétique se limite, à la fin de la Guerre froide, au port et à une station-relais de communications ; ce que les satellites espions américains avaient pris pour une importante base s'est révélé être surtout des ferrailles et d'anciennes installations vétustes ou abandonnées.
À partir de 1987, pendant la longue guerre civile somalienne, les gouvernements du Yémen ont officiellement proclamé Socotra comme territoire yéménite, mais à partir de 2015, c'est au Yémen que sévit la guerre civile et ce sont les Émirats arabes unis qui commencent à administrer, voire à coloniser Socotra, construisant de nouvelles infrastructures et des réseaux de télécommunication, faisant leurs propres recensements de la population locale, offrant aux habitants des contrats de travail, puis, en 2018, occupant militairement l'île malgré les protestations du gouvernement yéménite. Le 13 mai 2018, des troupes saoudiennes débarquent à leur tour à la demande du gouvernement yéménite et les occupants se retirent au profit de l'armée yéménite le lendemain, 14 mai.
En mai 2019, le gouvernement yéménite accuse les Émirats arabes unis de fournir une aide logistique aux séparatistes du Conseil de transition du Sud à Socotra, ce que nient les Émirats. En février 2020, un régiment de l'armée yéménite stationné à Socotra se rebelle contre le gouvernement d'Abdrabbo Mansour Hadi reconnu par l'ONU, et prête allégeance au Conseil de transition du Sud (CTS). Le 20 juin 2020, le CTS annonce avoir pris le contrôle de Socotra.

Géographie
Socotra est une île d'origine continentale. Elle faisait partie de l'ancien continent Gondwana dont elle s'est détachée au milieu du Pliocène, il y a environ 6 millions d'années, lors de la même distension continentale qui ouvrit le golfe d'Aden au nord-ouest.
Située à 234 kilomètres au large de la Somalie et à 352 kilomètres au sud-est du Yémen, l'île est peuplée et revendiquée par des populations issues de ces deux origines.

Socotra est constituée d'une étroite plaine côtière, d'un plateau de grès truffé de cavernes karstique et de montagnes, les Haghier, s'élevant jusqu'à 1 525 mètres d'altitude. L'île mesure environ 140 kilomètres de longueur et une quarantaine de kilomètres de largeur, pour une superficie de 3 579 km2.

Climat
Socotra possède un climat tropical, désertique et semi-aride (classification de Köppen : BWh et BSh).
Le climat chaud de Socotra est fortement influencé par les moussons. Les zones basses (les côtes ainsi qu'un bassin intérieur situé au centre de l'île) sont très sèches, tandis que les plateaux sont régulièrement arrosés.
La mousson d'été, qui dure de mai à septembre, n'apporte pas de pluies, mais des vents violents du sud-ouest qui atteignent des moyennes de 60 km/h à 100 km/h et rendent l'accès à l'île difficile par mer ou par air.
De novembre à mars, la mousson du nord-est apporte des pluies, parfois torrentielles, mais aussi des vents, moins violents mais souvent chargés de fines poussières. Les hauts plateaux sont dans la brume et bien arrosés. Les régions côtières connaissent de fortes averses sporadiques. Novembre et décembre sont les mois les plus frais de l'année, avant le retour de la chaleur dès janvier.
De fin mars à début mai, une saison de transition apporte des pluies bien réparties sur toute l'île. Ce sont les plus profitables de l'année pour la végétation. Les vents sont faibles et c'est paradoxalement la période la plus chaude.
L'archipel est rarement touché par des tempêtes, mais des cyclones peuvent occasionnellement le traverser .

Environnement
Deux bras de mer ont séparé au Quaternaire l'archipel des deux continents africain et asiatique, induisant une évolution des espèces végétales et animales en vase clos jusqu'à ce que les humains introduisent de nouvelles espèces telles que les chèvres. Les recensements ont révélé que plus d'un tiers des 800 et quelques espèces de plantes de Socotra sont endémiques. Les botanistes rangent la flore de Socotra parmi les dix flores insulaires les plus menacées du monde.
Socotra est considérée comme le joyau de la biodiversité de la mer d'Arabie.  Dans les années 1990, une équipe de biologistes des Nations unies a mené une enquête sur la flore et la faune de l'archipel. Près de 700 espèces endémiques y ont été recensées ; seules la Nouvelle-Zélande, Hawaii, la Nouvelle-Calédonie et les îles Galápagos surpassent ce nombre. 
Le long isolement géologique de l'archipel de Socotra, sa chaleur extrême et sa sécheresse se sont combinés pour créer une flore endémique unique et remarquable. Des études de terrain menées par le Centre pour les plantes du Moyen-Orient, appartenant au Jardin botanique royal d'Édimbourg, indiquent que 307 espèces de plantes sur 825 (37 %) de Socotra sont endémiques, c'est-à-dire qu'on ne les trouve nulle part ailleurs sur Terre. L'ensemble de la flore de l'archipel de Socotra a été reporté dans la liste rouge de l'UICN, avec 3 espèces de plantes en danger critique d'extinction et 27 espèces de plantes menacées d'extinction reconnues en 2004.
L'une des plantes les plus originales de Socotra est le dragonnier de Socotra (Dracaena cinnabari), un étrange arbre en forme de parapluie. Sa sève rouge, présentée comme le sang des dragons mythiques, était recherchée comme colorant et est aujourd'hui utilisée comme peinture et vernis. Les divers aloès endémiques de Socotra, utilisés en médecine et en cosmétique, étaient également importants dans l'Antiquité. Parmi les autres plantes endémiques figurent une moracée pachycaule Dorstenia gigas, l’arbre-concombre Dendrosicyos socotranus, les rares grenadiers socotrans (Punica protopunica), Aloe perryi et Boswellia socotrana.

L'archipel a aussi une riche faune, dont plusieurs espèces endémiques d'oiseaux, comme le Rufipenne de Socotra (Onychognathus frater), le Souimanga de Socotra (Nectarinia balfouri), le Bruant de Socotra (Emberiza socotrana), la Cisticole de Socotra (Cisticola haesitatus), Moineau de Socotra (Passer insularis), Grand-verdier de Socotra (Rhynchostruthus socotranus) et une espèce d’un genre monotypique, la Cisticole pâle (Incana incana). De nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux sont menacées par la prédation par des chats sauvages non indigènes. Avec un seul mammifère endémique, 6 espèces d'oiseaux endémiques et aucun amphibien, les reptiles constituent la faune de vertébrés de Socotran la plus représentative avec 31 espèces. Si l’on exclut les deux espèces récemment introduites, Hemidactylus robustus et Hemidactylus flaviviridis, toutes les espèces indigènes sont endémiques. L'endémisme est très élevé à la fois au niveau des espèces (29 sur 31, soit 94 %) et au niveau des genres (5 sur 12, soit 42 %). Au niveau des espèces, l'endémicité peut être encore plus élevée, des études phylogénétiques ayant révélé une diversité cachée non négligeable. Les espèces de reptiles comprennent les scinques, les lézards sans jambes et une espèce de caméléon, Chamaeleo monachus. Il existe de nombreux invertébrés endémiques, dont plusieurs araignées (telles que la tarentule Monocentropus balfouri) et trois espèces de crabes d'eau douce (un Socotra et deux Socotrapotamon). 
Comme dans de nombreux systèmes insulaires isolés, les chauves-souris sont les seuls mammifères originaires de Socotra. En revanche, les récifs coralliens de Socotra sont variés, avec de nombreuses espèces endémiques. Socotra est également un des milieux hébergeant le papillon Bicyclus anynana.
Au cours des deux mille ans d’établissements humains sur les îles, l’environnement a lentement et continuellement changé et, selon Jonathan Kingdon, « les animaux et les plantes qui restent ne représentent qu’une fraction dégradée de ce qui existait jadis ». Le Périple de la mer Érythrée, qui est daté entre le Ier et le IIIe siècle, raconte que l'île abritait des crocodiles et de grands lézards : la faune reptilienne actuelle semble donc être considérablement réduite. Il y a quelques siècles à peine, l'île comptait des rivières et des zones humides, des stocks plus importants d'arbres endémiques et des pâturages abondants. Les Portugais ont enregistré la présence de buffles  au début du XVIIe siècle. À présent, il n’y a plus que des ravins de sable, et de nombreuses plantes indigènes ne survivent que là où il y a plus d’humidité ou plus de protection contre le bétail. La faune résiduelle de Socotra est fortement menacée par les chèvres et autres espèces introduites.
À la suite de la Guerre civile yéménite, Socotra a été isolée et les prix du gaz sont devenus élevés, ce qui a incité les habitants à exploiter le bois pour se chauffer. En décembre 2018, les Émirats Arabes Unis ont envoyé du gaz de cuisson aux résidents de Socotra afin de lutter contre la déforestation.
L'île constitue une écorégion terrestre dans la classification du Fonds mondial pour la nature sous le nom de « brousses xériques de l'île de Socotra ». Elle appartient au biome des déserts et brousses xériques de l'écozone afrotropicale et fait partie de la liste « Global 200 » du WWF qui regroupe les régions biogéographiques les plus représentatives de la biodiversité planétaire. Elle est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco au sein de l'archipel de Socotra depuis 2008 et est considérée comme un point chaud de biodiversité par l'association Conservation International avec le reste la Corne africaine.

Liste des plantes
Population
La plupart des habitants de l'archipel, au nombre de 42 842 en 2004, vivent à Socotra. La ville principale est Hadiboh avec une population estimée en 2004 à 8 545 habitants. Les autres villes sont Qulansiyah avec 3 862 habitants et Qād̨ub avec 929 habitants. Toutes les trois sont situées sur la côte Nord. Les îles d'Abd al Kuri et de Samhah ont une population de quelques centaines d'habitants, Darsah et les autres îles sont inhabitées.
La population est d'origine somalienne avec des métissages de différentes origines dont celles des différents conquérants de l'île, de religion musulmane sunnite et parle le soqotri, une langue non écrite, qui fait partie de la famille des langues sémitiques.

Économie
Les activités principales sont la pêche et l'élevage de bovins et de chèvres. Le climat ne permet que la culture de dattes, d'aromates et d'un peu de tabac. Les principaux produits commerciaux sont le ghî, du beurre clarifié, l'aloès et l'encens (Boswellia sp.). Récemment, le tourisme a commencé à prendre de l'importance.

## Overview
Socotra (Arabic: سقطرى ; Suquṭra) is an archipelago consisting mainly of four main islands and two smaller rocky islets in the Indian Ocean, an offshore territory of Yemen, near the Horn of Africa.

## Understand
Due to its remarkable biodiversity, with over a third of the local plant species found nowhere else, Socotra has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  With over 40,000 inhabitants, though, it's not just a nature reserve.
The island is new to tourism, so if you are looking for a luxurious vacation this is not the right destination.
The island is not under the control of the Yemani government and the current flights to it from other countries are illegal.

## Flora
The long geological isolation of the Socotra archipelago and its fierce heat and drought has combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora (which may, therefore, be vulnerable to introduced species such as goats and to climate change).
The known Socotran flora stands at over 940 species, including some 300 endemics, 16 of which are restricted to Abd Al Kuri and another 10 confined to Samha.
Many are strange-looking remnants of ancient floras which long ago disappeared from the African /Arabian mainland.
They create a scene of weird vegetation and make the archipelago the world's tenth richest island group for endemic plant species.
There are certainly many more plant species that have yet to be discovered. For example, in the early years of the 21st century, Dr. Tony Miller of the Royal Botanical Garden in Edinburgh collected the first known specimens of a tiny carnivorous plant, which grows on moist tree trunks in the higher reaches of the Haggier Mountains.
Only in sheltered valleys and higher mountain areas is the vegetation more luxuriant.
Different main types of vegetation can be recognised.
The most distinctive is the open deciduous shrub land of coastal plains and low inland hills dominated by the common shrub, Croton socotranus, and tree succulents such as the bizarre Adenium and Dendrosicyos.The higher altitudes are home of frankincense, Socotran Aloe and wild pomegranate. One of the most famous botanical curiosities of Socotra is the Dragon’s Blood Tree (Draecaenia Cinnabari), whose name is derived from the fact that by carving its trunk it pours out a red resin, it is said by the ancient belief, to be the blood of the dragon, also there is ancient belief that the tree grown on the same place where Cain killed his brother Abel, for this reason the tree called in Arabic (brothers blood's tree).

## Fauna
The island of Socotra has a rich variety of plant and animal species, with a high degree of endemism. 12 mammal and more than 223 species of birds have been recorded here with new species being found every year.
Over 48 of the bird species breed here, while 85 species are regular migrants or winter visitors.
There are eight bird species that can be found nowhere else, such as the Socotra Starling Onychognathus frater, the Socotra Sunbird Chalcomitra balfouri, Socotra Sparrow Passer insularis, Socotra BuntingEmberiza socotrana, Socotra WarblerIncana incana, Socotra CisticolaCisticola haesitatus and Socotra Golden-winged Grosbeak Rhynchostruthus socotranus
About 12 species of mammals are known from Socotra, but all of them have been introduced by man or may occasionally come from the mainland. Further taxonomic studies are needed to clarify the status of a number of forms. The coastal area with the shores, sea-cliffs, rocky slopes, and small mangrove belts appear to be a suitable breeding habitat for sea birds.
Extremely rich and interesting is the reptile fauna comprising 19 out of 22 endemic species. Nesting of sea turtles, probably Green Turtles but possibly Hawksbills, takes place on the north coast.
Ornithologists believe that more detailed study of the ten endemic subspecies will lead to the splitting of some to full specific status. This most obvious bird to the visitor, however, is the ubiquitous Egyptian Vulture, known locally as saeedoh or Al Baladiya Socotri, or Municipal Bird, for its habit of cleaning up everything such as kitchen waste.
However, this unique biodiversity in the island and its marine surroundings enriched with precious fish-wealth, coral reefs and other marine life has become threatened by predators who sniff their prey of such rare plants, animals, and birds. Also the exploitation of the fish wealth exposes it to loss.
Socotra is an eco-tourism system with limited infrastructure and new to the international tourist market, and therefore the hotel accommodations are not quite like other destinations.
There are two information centers at the airport and in Hadibo.

## When to go
Climate is an important consideration. And this depends on your interest. Nature enthusiasts should go from early October to late April. The monsoon occurs in July till mid-August (during July in the south east and south west of the island, wind surfing activity can be arranged). Generally, wildlife and natural viewing is best from the end of January through May.

## By plane
Commercial flights to Socotra are intermittent and difficult. The only legal route is to take a Yemenia flight from the Yemeni city Mukalla. The only direct – but illegal – route from overseas is to take an Air Arabia flight from Abu Dhabi, as Yemen does not sanction it, because it doesn't have military control over the island. Any proof of travel to Socotra from the UAE, which militarily controls and administers Socotra using Southern Transitional Council militias since 2018, can result in difficulties in mainland Yemen, also because of the difficulty in providing consular assistance.

## By boat

## Get around
You can go around the island only  by local tour company,  how will organize the complete tour Package like accommodation, car 4×4, tour guide, food full board, visa and sea tour. As tourism start in 1998 socotra guide was the first local tour company established on Socotra in 2003.

## See
Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea. Although the region is small, it is characterized by unique land and marine biodiversity.
The interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau.  While on the outer coastline, breathtaking natural beaches have pure white sand dunes and palm trees.  Socotra Island is very rich and is home to many rare spectacular species of reefs, fish, birds, plants, and trees which are not found anywhere else in the world. The limestone plateau and the Hagghier Mountains are the richest areas for endemic plant species, but endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation.  One of the most famous plants is the dragon's blood tree "dracaena cinnabara" which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth.  The tree got its name because if any damage is made to the bark then a dark red liquid oozes out.
There is also the Desert Rose (adenium obesium) which looks like a blooming elephant leg.  Also found in Socotra's landscape is the ever-strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree.  In addition there are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies.  There is so much beauty all around the island, it is difficult not the appreciate to magnificent scenery and wildlife.

## Do
Camp: With a bit of water for washing, a good meal and warm sleeping surrounded by virgin nature, camping on the beaches will provide a very special break from the every day routine in civilization!
Hiking:  The Scant, Tinnera, Firmihin, Dersmotin regions, are the most popular destinations for trekkers.  Hiking is for everyone and even for those who are less athletic.  However, for more difficult and high altitude trails, it is recommended to be accompanied by a local guide.
Camel back ride: It is an opportunity to get to know and enjoy the spectacular scenery and relaxed the rhythm of ancient time.  This is more of a less active adventure.  The camel back rides provide a more relaxing ride over plateaus and colorful panoramas and mountains.
Surf:  Socotra has excellent conditions for surfing. The best time to come for this activity is during the monsoon season from June up to late August.  In July the wind speed can reach up to 60 mph and you have to be aware of such conditions. Since the winds can be very rough it is recommended that only experienced surfers participate.
Scuba dive/ Snorkel: Dive into the tropical warm weather filled with coral reefs.  Enjoy swimming among the hundreds of species of fish and marine life such as barracudas, monkfish, dolphins, rays and even mantas.  Diving for all ages and levels.
Bird watching tours:  This is for anyone who has an interest in birds.  Excellent way to view nature and the highly diverse bird population while avoiding harming any wildlife.
Local boat safaris and fishing: Take one of the organized tours and be taken to incomparable destinations.  The trip to Shouab beach is a half day tour to discover the beauty of this remarkable destination. With the clear water and white sands you can snorkel and relax. While driving the boat, dolphins can be seen swimming right next to the boat.
Also go on a fascinating fishing experience with some of the locals.
Remarkable volcanic caves: Explore the Hoq Cave with its overwhelming beauty and variety of crystal decorations.
Beaches Shouab, Qalansia, Arher, Noget, Amaq among others
Wadis and fresh water pools Homhil, Wadi Dirhir and others

## Eat
Socotra is a remote island and therefore their cuisine is limited and simple.  Local restaurants often serve fresh fish, chicken, goat, rice, and potatoes.  The fish is highly recommended and all meals are typically served with flat Arabic bread.
There are also restaurants at each of the five hotels with a simple menu similar to that of the local restaurants.
Oranges, bananas, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, bottled water, and soft drinks can all be bought at shops in town.
Vegetables can be bought also but they are more expensive because they must be shipped over.
If you are camping in Socotra, your driver/guide will be responsible for your meals (typically some delicious freshly cooked fish). Although it's nice to help the driver you don't have to.

## Drink
Because Yemen is an Islamic country, there are no alcoholic beverages provided except at five-star hotels in the big cities on the mainland. Bottled water and soft drinks can be purchased at shops in town.
Bottled water is also available at the campsites, and tea is served with all the meals as well.

## Sleep
There are four hotels in Hadibo: Taj Socotra Hotel, Socotra Tourist Hotel, Heathrow Hotel, Al-Gawhara (Diamond) Hotel  and Summerland Hotel.  These hotels may not be the most luxurious, but they do provide air-conditioning, televisions, and refrigerators in all of the rooms.  Most of the rooms at these hotels have their own bathroom, but there are a few rooms at the Hafijj Hotel and Socotra Hotel that must share bathrooms.  There is a restaurant in each of the hotels with simple yet delicious cuisine. Considering Socotra is a fairly new eco-tourism destination, their facilities are decent.  In addition, there is another hotel at the airport and several guest houses around the island.
The most popular lodging is camping on the beaches.  There are several campsites that allow tourists to barbecue on the beach with beautiful mountain views in the background.  Tourists can choose to purchase camping tour packages which include a driver or guide that will show tourists around the beaches as well as provide meals during their stay.  It is a fantastic way to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the island.

## Stay safe
Many governments advise against all travel to Yemen, including Socotra. Do not take photos of military installations and equipment and the airport. Comply with orders and searches from Emirati and Saudi Arabian armed forces. Do not instruct your driver to drive quickly as you are approaching an armed checkpoint. You risk indefinite detention by the transitional government otherwise.

## Stay healthy
Malaria is not common, but malaria prophylaxis is recommended.  Cholera is not present on the island at all. The US CDC recommends having up to date polio and measles vaccinations. Rabies vaccinations are also advised due to the prevalence of rabies, and because hospitals in Yemen lack adequate stock of rabies vaccines.
The archipelago's two hospitals are small and basic, offer substandard service and are ill equipped, especially for life threatening illnesses and injuries. Pharmacies are located in Hadibo, but often suffer from a shortage of medicines. Medical evacuations are difficult to organise.

La thula (pluriel thulur) est un genre poétique médiéval, très fréquent dans la mythologie nordique. Il s'agit d'une énumération de noms propres, probablement à but mnémotechnique en vue d'une récitation orale. Ainsi, on y trouve beaucoup de figure de styles qui facilitent leur apprentissage :

les allitérations : répétition d'une ou plusieurs consonnes
les assonances : répétition d'un même son vocalique dans plusieurs mots proches
les paronymies : rapport de deux mots dont les prononciations sont fort proches.
Il existe des thulur de noms de nains, de Valkyries, des mille noms d'Odin et même des thulur de noms de géants, d'animaux et d'armes (voir Nafnaþulur).

Exemples
Thula de noms de nains
Dans la Völuspá, la voyante qui fait son monologue donne une thula de noms de nains (strophes 11, 12 et suivantes) :

Dans son roman Le Hobbit, l'écrivain britannique J. R. R. Tolkien reprend plusieurs de ces noms et les attribue à ses personnages de nains : Thorin, Balin, Dvalin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur et Bombur. Ils se retrouvent tous, à l'exception de Balin, dans les thulur de noms de nains issus de la Völuspá. Le nom de Gandalf se retrouve aussi chez Tolkien, mais il est porté par un magicien.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taiz (Arabic: تَعِزّ, romanized: Taʿizz) is a city in southwestern Yemen. It is located in the Yemeni highlands, near the port city of Mocha on the Red Sea, at an elevation of about 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level. It is the capital of Taiz Governorate. As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of approximately 940,600 residents making it the third largest city in Yemen.

History
Medieval
The first reference to Taiz in historical sources dates back to the first half of the 12th century CE, when the sultan of the Sulayhid dynasty, Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi, built the Al-Qahira Castle. Taiz first became an urbanized area during the days of his brother Ali bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi.
The next historical reference to Taiz mentioned that Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi's minister, Prince Al-Mansur bin Al-Mufaddal bin Abi Al-Barakat, sold many of the country's castles and cities - except for the fortresses of Taiz and Sabr - to the ruler of Aden Al-Zari'i, the preacher Muhammad Ibn Saba, in exchange for one hundred thousand dinars.
Turan-Shah, the older brother of Saladin, ruled the city after he conquered Yemen in 1173 CE. Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city. In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the Ayyubid dynasty by Turan-Shah.
Taiz's expansion accelerated when the Rasulid dynasty, which ruled Yemen from 1229 to 1454, took over the city. The second Rasulid King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), moved his kingdom's capital from Sanaa to Taiz, due to its proximity to Aden.  Taiz was said to have reached its golden age during the Rasulid dynasty, whose sultans spent lavishly on palaces, mosques, and madrassas. Its neighborhoods also teemed with schools, guesthouses, markets, orchards, and lush gardens, and the city was considered to be a center for the study of the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence.
In 1332 Ibn Battutah visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen:

We went on ... to the town of Taʻizz, the capital of the king of Yemen, and one of the finest and largest towns in that country. Its people are overbearing, insolent, and rude, as is generally the case in towns where kings reside. Taʻizz is made up of three quarters; the first is the residence of the king and his court, the second, called ʽUdayna, is the military station, and the third, called al-Mahálib, is inhabited by the commonalty, and contains the principal market.

In 1500, the capital was moved to Sana'a by the ruler of the Taharid dynasty. In 1516 Taiz came under Ottoman control.

20th century
In 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the newly independent Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.
Taiz remained a walled city until 1948, when Imam Ahmed made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall. In the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen was opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations moved back to Sana'a.

1994 mass shooting
On March 25–26, 1994, a mass shooting took place in the city. A Yemeni killed eleven women and seven men, among them his wife and his mother, before he was arrested by police. When he was led away he managed to wrestle the gun from a police officer and kill another four people, three of them police officers, before he himself was shot dead. A total of 23 people were killed, including the suspect.

Yemeni uprising and war
During the Yemeni Revolution fighting in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
As part of the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, on 22 March 2015, the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the aftermath of their coup d'état in Sanaa. The city became the site of a military confrontation between Houthis and the forces loyal to Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The city was effectively under siege and the United Nations warned of an "extreme and irreversible" food shortage if fighting continued. In August 2015, Yemeni Member of Parliament Muhammad Muqbil Al-Himyari reported Houthi attacks on civilians in Taiz and appealed for help on Suhail TV (Yemen).
The 2015 confrontation expanded into a military campaign for control of this strategic city. Despite ceasefires and prisoner swaps, the battle continues to this day and the city has been described as a "volatile front line." The frontline runs through the city from east to west, and journeys across the frontline that once took 5 minutes now take 5 hours. Once known as the "cultural capital of Yemen", the war has bestowed a new name on Taiz: "city of snipers".
As of 2018, at least seven journalists had been killed in Taiz since the start of the war.
The fighting has also devastated Taiz's architectural heritage: Cairo Citadel was damaged by airstrikes in 2015, and the Taiz Museum was shelled in 2016, causing its manuscripts to be destroyed.

Geography
Climate
Taiz has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), bordering both a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) and a tropical savanna climate (Aw). The average daily temperature high during August is 32.5 °C (90.5 °F). Annual rainfall of Taiz is around 660 millimetres (26 in), but on Jabal Sabir it is probably around 1,000 millimetres (39.4 in) per year.

Landmarks
The city has many old quarters, with houses that are typically built with brown bricks, and mosques that are usually whitewashed. The most famous mosques in the city are the Ashrafiya, the Mua'tabiya Mosque, and the Mudhaffar Mosque. Other landmarks include Cairo Citadel, which looms above the city from the south, and the governor's palace, which rests on top of a mountain spur 450 m (1,480 ft) above the city centre. Taiz is also home to one of the best-known mountains in Yemen, Jabal Saber, almost 3,000 metres (1.9 miles) above sea level), which affords panoramic views over the city.

Economy
Historically, the mountainous city of Taiz was known for coffee production. The Mocha coffee produced in Taiz was considered some of the finest in the region in the early 20th century. Today, coffee remains a major part of the economy but mango, pomegranate, citrus, banana, papai, vegetables, cereals, onions, and qat are also grown in the surrounding landscapes. Taiz is also known for its cheese. It is produced in rural areas like Araf, Awshaqh, Akhuz, Bargah, Barah, Jumah, Mukyas, Suayra, Kamb and Hajda and sold in Bab al-Kabeer and Bab Musa markets. Industries in the city of Taiz include cotton-weaving, tanning and jewelry production.
However, since the outbreak of the civil war in 2015, Taiz's economy has been devastated by the fighting and the city's siege by Houthi rebels. Many goods are in short supply, and must be smuggled in across steep mountain roads to avoid sniper fire.

Transport
Taiz has many road connections with the rest of the country. However, as of January 2023, most roads to and from Ta'iz are controlled by the Houthis, who are besieging the city as part of the Yemeni Civil War. The city is served by Ta'izz International Airport. With the closing of this airport due to the civil war, the only way into and out of the city is via cars or small buses that goes through a longer and less serviced roads than the normal roads before the war. However, There was an agreement recently towards open roads in Taiz that will save time and effort for people to go in and out the city.

Zoo
Like Sana'a Zoo, this zoo held fauna caught in the wild, such as the Arabian leopard, as well as exotic animals such as African lions and gazelles. Due to the civil war, however, many of the animals held at the zoo have become sick or died due to lack of food.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Al-Qahira Castle is a historical castle in the ancient city of Taiz, Yemen. It is located on the northern slope of Mount Sabr, which is based on rocky highlands overlooking the city. It is said that the area was originally referred as the old Taiz, and later renamed as Al-Qahira. The castle is considered as the nucleus of the city of Taiz.
The sultan of the Sulayhids 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Sulayhi commissioned the castle in the first half of the 12th-century and it was expanded during the rule of his brother Ali ibn Muhammad al-Sulayhi.

Architecture
Al-Qahira Castle consists of two sections. The first section is called "Al-Adina" and includes gardens constructed in the form of a terrace built on the slope of the mountain. Water vapor and basins are carved and built-in one of the facades of the mountain, as well as the mansions scattered around it, surrounded by towers and parks. In this section, there are four palaces, each named Dar al-Adab, Dar al-Shajarah, Dar al-'Adil, and Dar al-'Amara. Dar al-'Amara was specially designated for the sultan and as the guest house for distinguished guests, and it was attached with the tunnels and secret passages connecting to the other palaces. The second part of the castle is referred to as "the area of the Maghreb", and consists of a number of palaces, guard towers, grain storage facilities, and water reservoirs. The wall of the castle is one of the most important historical artifacts of the city of Taiz, which was built in ancient times in order to contain all the neighborhoods of the old city. It is also believed to have been founded in the era of the Sulayhid dynasty and was built with complex engineering technology. Its height reaches 120 meters and a thickness of four meters, and it contained rooms for servants and guardians, some of which still remain today.
As for the castle wall, it connects with the old wall of Taiz, which had four main gates: Bab al-Kabir, Bab Musa, Bab al-Madjar, and Bab al-Nasr. Above the gate existed a watchtower guarding the city. The main entrance to the castle is located on the south side of the Al-Moayad area. It consists of a madrasa (school) built by the Sultan al-Muayyad in 1281, a small dome, a pond, and the remains of Sultan Al-Muayyed Park. The madrasa has a small sahn, and the park still stands until today.

Destruction
In 2015, during the course of the Yemeni Civil War, the castle was taken over by Houthi rebels, and struck by an airstrike of the Saudi-led coalitions afterwards. The local outlet stated that the castle was "destroyed", although the level of destruction remains unclear.
According to a UNESCO report, Al-Qahira Castle was damaged in two separate strikes: on May 10 and May 21, 2015. 30% of the castle was damaged in the second strike.
The castle was later taken over by al-Qaeda-linked Abu Al Abbas Brigades, who used it as a military barracks. On 26 August 2018, the castle was reported to be under the control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government who reopened it for visitors after defeating the UAE-backed Abu Al Abbas Brigades. The castle was closed for 4 years and was being used as barracks.

ASHRAFIYA MOSQUE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Madrasa and Mosque of Al-Ashrafiya or Al-Ashrafiya Mosque (Arabic: جامع ومدرسة الأشرفية) is a historical madrasa-mosque located in the old city of Taiz, Yemen at the foot of Mount Sabr in the southwestern part of the city. It is arguably the most notable preserved artifact of Taiz, given its distinct and beautiful design. It is considered to be one of the most important centers in the Islamic history of Yemen along with its complement, the Mudhaffar Mosque. It was supposedly built in two stages: (1) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Umar II (1295-6) or 800 Hijri, (2) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Isma'il I (1377-1400) and opened in 1382 or 803 Hijri. This compound can be found in the neighborhood of Ashrafiya, surrounded by a number of other locations and overlooks the Cairo Citadel. The mosque accommodates approximately 120 to 800 worshippers.

Architecture
The material used in the mosque construction is qadad; it's made of a lime plaster treated with slaked lime, oils and water. Since the mosque was built on top of storm drains, every part of the structure built above the foundation is made of red brick. Located in the northern part of the compound, the prayer room is the main space of this mosque. It forms a large rectangular area that spans approximately 25.40 meters east to west and is 7.65 meters wide from north to south.
The center of the mosque is sheltered by a large dome decorated with colorful motifs. The dome's square is neighbored by two separate hallways, each one covered by four smaller domes. In its earliest model, the mosque consisted of a single prayer hall along with eight smaller domes. In its first stage, the mosque had a prayer hall with eight small domes surrounding a much larger central dome. Also on the premises, a square courtyard can be found behind the main mosque building. A royal tomb chamber and several classrooms for the Quranic school surround the courtyard. Consequently, this creates an almost perfect square of the land plot. The south side of the courtyard contains a pair of non-homogenously designed minarets in the corners of the plot. Although they may appear the same to the naked eye from a distant glance, the minarets actually differ in dimensions and symmetry.
The mosque was decorated in stucco and painted ornament of high sophistication. The decorative program of the mosque is often considered a finer example than that of other mosques in the region. In addition, the qibla wall is decorated to match the exact design concept of the courtyard. It has a succession of adjacent arches with supporting columns, or arcades, that superimpose and get increasingly smaller.

Madrasa
Consistent with the Islamic architectural design of the Arabian Peninsula, domed buildings became very prominent with the architectural design of madrasas like the Ashrafiya Mosque. However, the Ashrafiya Mosque varied from other traditional models in that the library and Quranic school were integral to the structure of the mosque complex. The madrasa was mainly built of raw materials such as stone and plaster that had primarily been sourced locally. It is considered one of the most influential centers of education of the Shafiʽi Islamic school of thought and jurisprudence in the Islamic world. The school has a vast library with books in various subjects to satisfy the studies of the Muslim scholars and students belonging to the institution. Structurally, the madrasa has four accessible entrances. Above the main entrance is an inscription the reads the following:

Order of the building of this blessed school by our lord and king Sultan Al-Sayyid by the terms of the honorable king of the country and the religion Ismail bin Abbas bin Ali bin Dawud bin Yusuf God gave his kingdom and victory.

Tomb History in Yemen
In addition to a functional prayer hall and Islamic school, the mosque compound contains a burial yard where kings from the Rasulid dynasty that ruled Yemen were buried. In Yemen, the concept of tomb architecture as a part of a mosque compound began to emerge in the sixteenth century. This had been, in principle, a popular aspect of mosque planning in other parts of the Muslim world, especially in Saudi Arabia. Two of the holiest sites of the Muslim faith, Masjid al-Haram and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, located in Mecca and Medina, respectively, contain burial grounds for some of the most notable figures in Islam like the Prophet Muhammed, his family members, and his companions. Previously, in this region of Yemen, tombs and mosques were two separate entities until a dome was placed over the tomb of Murad Pasha in a mosque setting under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.

Impacts of War
Recently, the architectural integrity of this landmark has been compromised by the destruction caused by the Yemeni Civil War. An unexpected artillery shell launched by the Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and the forces of their former ally, Saleh, against the neighborhood of Al-Ashrafiya had caused significant structural damage to the historic mosque and the neighboring communities. In June 2015, severe damage to the mosque was caused when an artillery shell hit the eastern lighthouse. Although the intention was not to damage the minarets, locals have reported that the Houthis were trying to target a house nearby and missed, gravely destroying a piece of historic Yemeni and Muslim culture and society. Before then, Houthi militias had shelled the Ashrafiya Mosque several times, severely damaging the mosque and madrasa site.
The deputy director-general of tourism in the governorate of Taiz was a witness to this particular incident. He detailed that "On Wednesday, June 17th, 2015, at 4:30, the eastern minaret of the historic Al-Ashrafiya Mosque was suddenly bombed." This incident shook the entire area surrounding the mosque and even shattered the windows of the houses neighboring the mosque. Regarding the structural integrity of the mosque itself, the minaret was visibly damaged by the shell in its middle section leaving a widely visible crack. Concerned citizens and activist groups have long called for intervention to protect this mosque as a historical monument. They have even gone on to directly accuse the Houthis of "intentionally damaging the country’s historical ruins and of not respecting the mosque’s sanctity."
The implications of this war go beyond the worries of that period alone. Tourism, mainly for the purpose of visiting the city’s archaeological sites, has quickly decreased and come to a halt. In turn, there has been a recession for artisans of the region as tourist engagement was their primary source of income. Ultimately, the Al-Ashrafiya Mosque and Madrasa did not only serve as a cultural monument and school as its title suggests, but it also held an important role in the economic sector of the community because of its close ties with tourism.

Restoration and Preservation Status
Along with the destruction caused by war and conflict, the mosque faces degradation caused by many other environmental factors such as seismic movements, geological instability, and rooftop water seepage. Consequently, damage by physical and chemical means as well as anthropogenic degradation have been of significant concern to locals and government officials alike.
In the past decade, the project of restoring the Al-Ashrafiya Mosque and Madrasa has been prioritized and made an example for the purpose of rescue and restoration measures and rehabilitation within the Third International Architectural Conservation Conference and Exhibition in Dubai of 2012. The cooperation and participation of local community members throughout various phases of the project have been instrumental in facilitating a smooth and authentic reconstruction of the mosque to its historical origins.
As part of the final phase of the restoration project, the southern and northern walls, eastern domes, and the basement were restored with plaster resurfacing. In the process of preparing a task force, thirteen technicians were trained on documentation and restoration of gypsum motifs. These sessions were constructed and facilitated by a local expert knowledgeable about the specifics of the Islamic art and architecture field in this particular region. Mural paintings and gypsum decorations at the shrines and the open courtyard were chemically cleaned to more than fifty percent of their original state. Also, the central dome of the mosque, along with the wall of the prayer hall, were mechanically cleaned and consolidated up to sixty-five percent of their original state. In order to update the functionality of the structure, electrical wiring was installed throughout all parts of the premises besides the primary prayer hall. In July 2014, restoration efforts on the mosque were considered complete.

Jibla ou Dhu Jibla (en arabe : جِبْلَة) est une ville du Yémen, à 8 km au sud-sud-ouest d'Ibb. Elle se trouve à 2 200 m d'altitude, au pied du Jabal At-Taʿkar (جَبَل ٱلتَّعْكَر). La ville et ses environs sont proposés sur la liste indicative du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO. Elle abrite le palais et le mausolée de la reine Arwa al-Sulayhi (1048-1138).

Géographie
Bâtie au flanc d'une montagne de basalte, Jibla est entourée de cultures en terrasses : sorgho, jujubiers, caroubiers, ainsi que de cactées et euphorbes candélabres. Un aqueduc attribué à la reine Arwa est toujours en service.
La ville est faite de maisons de pierre sans enduit avec des décorations en stuc et en bois sculpté. Son architecture est similaire à celle d'Ibb mais ses rues sont pratiquement inaccessibles aux voitures ; située à l'écart de l'autoroute, elle est peu touchée par les constructions modernes ; elle compte plusieurs mosquées et monuments anciens dont le Palais de la reine Arwa (en) qui passe pour compter 365 chambres, la mosquée de cette reine, où se trouve son mausolée, et la mosquée Qubbat Bay az-Zum.

Histoire
De 1038 à 1138, Jibla est la capitale de la dynastie des Sulayhides qui se rattachent à l'ismaélisme, branche dissidente du chiisme. Le royaume atteint son apogée sous la reine Arwa, surnommée « Balkis la cadette » d'après le nom arabe de la reine de Saba biblique, qui établit sa capitale à Jibla et la dote de plusieurs mosquées et autres bâtiments publics. La mosquée, de style fatimide, comprend deux minarets, une cour et une nef surélevée ; le tombeau de la reine se trouve près du mihrab.
Au XVe siècle, trois ponts sont construits sur les deux rivières qui bordent la ville.
Au XIXe siècle, selon les géographes Conrad Malte-Brun et Eugène Cortambert, Jibla a des rues pavées, 1 200 maisons « la plupart hautes et bien bâties » ; son principal produit est le savon.
Le 8 juillet 2002, le gouvernement yéménite présente la candidature de Jibla au patrimoine de l'humanité de l'UNESCO. Des travaux de restauration et assainissement sont entrepris.

Attentat de 2002
Un hôpital est construit en 1967 par une mission américaine de la Convention baptiste du Sud ; il a une capacité de 77 lits. Le 30 décembre 2002, alors que l'établissement est en voie de transfert à une fondation yéménite, un faux blessé se présente avec une arme à feu dissimulée et ouvre le feu sur une réunion du personnel médical américain : le directeur William Koehn, la femme médecin Martha Myers et la logisticienne Kathleen Gariety sont tuées, le pharmacien Donald Caswell gravement blessé. Le tireur, Abed Abdel Razzak Kamel, ancien étudiant d'une école islamique, est capturé ; il dit avoir commis cet acte « parce qu'ils prêchaient le christianisme dans un pays musulman ». Les autorités yéménites attribuent ce triple meurtre à un groupe islamiste qui, deux jours plus tôt, avait tué à Sanaa le leader socialiste Jarallah Omar (en).

Al Mahwit (Arabic: المحويت Al-Maḥwīt) is the capital city of Al Mahwit Governorate, Yemen. It is located at an elevation of about 2000 metres.

The History
Al-Mahwit's development is fairly recent compared to some other Yemeni settlements. Its first known historical mention is in 1599 (1007 AH), in the Ghayat al-amani of Yahya ibn al-Husayn.
The old town of Al-Mahwit is situated around a mountain fortress. Until the 1970s, Al Mahwit was extremely isolated. The town had a population of about 10,000 in the early 1980s, after which infrastructure was developed and water, sanitation and electricity added.

Geography
The area is mountainous, set in the Haraz Mountains and attracts trekkers. Al-Mahwit is surrounded by several wadis such as Wadi Sama'a, Wadi Eyan, Wadi Juma't Saria, Wadi Hawar, Wadi Bour, Wadi Al- Hawdh, Wadi Thabab, Wadi Laa'a, Wadi Al-Ahjer and Wadi Naa'wan. Numerous villages are spread in the area that were built on and around rocks.

Climate
Al Mawhit has a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWk) with warm days and cool nights, typical of Yemen's highlands. Rain is concentrated in spring and summer, with a dry gap between the two rainy seasons. April, July and August are the only months with significant precipitation.

Economy
The area and surrounding governorate depends on agriculture, mainly the production of coffee, tobacco, corn, sorghum and qat.

Mukalla, officially the Mukalla City District, is a seaport and the capital city district of Yemen's largest governorate, Hadhramaut. The city is in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the Gulf of Aden, on the shores of the Arabian Sea, about 480 kilometres (300 miles) east of Aden. It is the most important port city in the Hadhramaut region. It is also the sixth-largest city in Yemen, with a population of approximately 595,000 as of 2023. The city is served by the nearby Riyan International Airport.

Etymology
The current name "Mukalla" (المكلا) is derived from the Arabic verb "kala" (كلا), meaning "to preserve" or "to nurture." This reflects the city's historical role as a safe harbor and bustling port, providing shelter and nurturing trade in the region.
However, several other names and epithets have been associated with Mukalla throughout its history, each offering insights into its development and cultural significance:

Al-Kheesa: This early name, meaning "bay" or "cove" in Arabic, highlights Mukalla's sheltered location and its early function as a fishing village.
Bandar Yaqoub: This name comes from the saint Yaqoub bin Yusuf, a man who settled in the city around the 12th century AD. His shrine remains a significant local landmark.
Bandar Omar: Named after a local figure, Omar bin Ali bin Sheikh Abu Bakr, who founded the Al-Rawda Mosque near Yaqoub's shrine.
Bandar Al-Naqeeb: Attributed to Captain Salah bin Hamad Al-Kassadi, a prominent ruler from the Al-Kassad dynasty that governed Mukalla in the 18th century.
Bandar Ghalib: This name emerged during the reign of Sultan Ghaleb bin Awad Al-Quaiti, who ruled the Hadhramaut region in the early 20th century.

History
Mukalla is not far from Qana, the ancient principal Hadrami trading post between India and Africa, with incense producing areas in its hinterland.

Mukalla was founded in 1035 as a fishing settlement. After witnessing a struggle for control by the Kathiri and Qu'aiti Sultanates in the 19th and 20th centuries, it became the capital of the Qu'aiti State of Hadhramaut. The Qu'aiti Sultanate was part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate until that merger, and a British Resident Advisor was stationed at Mukalla. The other major cities of the Sultanates were Ash-Shihr and Shibam.

Captain Haines, a British officer who surveyed Yemen in the 1830s, described Mukalla as a town of 4,500 inhabitants with a significant trade in slaves. British explorers Theodore Bent and Mabel Bent used Mukalla several times in the 1890s to enter and exit the Wadi Hadhramaut: “Our starting-point for the interior was Makalla, which is 230 miles from Aden, and is the only spot between Aden and Maskat which has any pretensions to the name of port. The name itself means 'harbour'… Here we were deposited in December 1893 by a chance steamer, one which had been chartered and on which for a consideration we were allowed to take passage. I took turns with the captain to sleep in his cabin, but there was nothing but the deck for the others.” In 1967, Mukalla lost its status of capital city of the Qu'aiti Sultanate as it became a part of the communist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and following the Yemeni unification in 1990, it became part of what is modern-day Yemen.

Yemeni Civil War
During the Yemeni Civil War, on 2 April 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stormed the central prison, freeing hundreds of prisoners including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked the central bank and seized 17 billion Yemeni riyals and 1 million U.S. dollars before taking control of the presidential palace in the city. During the Battle of Mukalla (2015), it was reported the entire city was under their control and they planned to establish an Islamic emirate in the wider Hadramaut region. 
On 3 November 2015, Cyclone Chapala struck Mukalla and destroyed the city's waterfront.
Mukalla was recaptured from Al Qaeda (AQAP) on 25 April 2016, after 2,000 Yemeni and Emirati troops of the Saudi-led coalition advanced into the city, taking control of its port and airport and setting up checkpoints throughout the city.

Economy
The main market souq is one of the main commercial hubs of the city. Mukalla port is located to the east of the town. The port is available for vessels with length not more than 150 metres (490 feet), as per Pilot Book Pilot Directions (as of 2010). At the same time two vessels with the length 150 metres (490 feet) each and about 20 small fishing vessels can stay alongside in Mukalla port (fishing vessel moored alongside one to another). The port is fitted with oil pipe line for tankers. Oil tanks located close to the port. A cement factory of the "RAYSUT" Omani-Yemeni company (Oman-Yemen company) located in the port and is able to receive cement in bulk from cement carriers.

Sights
The old town is open for tourists. Sights include the royal palace of the sultan. Guard towers that were outposts surmount the vicinity of the old town. Nearby are Hadhramaut Mountains, such as that of Husn Ghuraf.

Education
The HUCOM (College of Medicine) of the Hadhramout University is located in Mukalla.

Al Moukalla est une ville du Yémen, sur l'Océan indien, à 480 km d'Aden. 
C’est la capitale de la province de l’Hadramaout, desservie par le Riyan Airport.
C’est un port prospère et un important centre de pêche, voué à l'exportation. Avec environ 150 000 habitants, c’est la septième ville du Yémen. Le port d’Al Moukalla est actif depuis des siècles. Après la révolution de 1967, l’augmentation de la population (323 000 en 2007) entraîne le développement des faubourgs, ce qui retire à la ville une partie du charme qu'elle avait su préserver.

Histoire
Histoire ancienne
La ville aurait été fondée en 1035 comme port de pêche.
La région a longtemps été (historiquement) intégrée au sultanat d'Oman.

Histoire moderne
Elle a été un des deux centres urbains d'un État indépendant,  l’État Quaiti de Chihr et Moukalla (1858-1967), sous protectorat britannique de 1888 à 1967.
Parmi les tribus issues de Tamud, certaines ont vécu à Wadi Doan (en), à Al Mukalla ainsi qu'en Wadi Hadramaout. 
Une des dernières tribus bien connue de l’histoire de cette terre est celle d’Ahl Al Bar, dont le cheikh (chef de tribu) Al Cheik Abdallah Ben Saad Ben Omar Ben Abdourahman Al Bar a vécu à Wadi Doan et plus particulièrement à Kureba. Son fils Said Ben Abdallah Ben Saad Al Bar, navigateur du XXe siècle, est capturé en 1913 par l’armée française dans la colonie de Diégo Suarez à Madagascar, puis enrôlé de force dans l’armée pour la Première Guerre mondiale. 
Les petits-fils de ce chef de tribu sont actuellement émigrés en Indonésie, en Malaisie, à Bruneï, à Djibouti et au Soudan.

Histoire récente
La ville est occupée par les terroristes d'AQPA d'avril 2015 à avril 2016 lors de l'insurrection djihadiste au Yémen.
Le 24 avril 2016, les forces spéciales des Emirats arabes unis, aidées par les forces spéciales américaines, ont organisé un débarquement pour reprendre la ville. À la suite de cette opération, près de 250 membres supposés d'AQPA sont arrêtés.

Seiyun (also transliterated as Saywun, Sayoun or Say'un; Arabic: سَيْئُوْن  Hadhrami pronunciation: [seːˈwuːn], Literary Arabic: [sæjˈʔuːn]) is a city in the region and Governorate of Hadhramaut in Yemen. It is located in the middle of the Hadhramaut Valley, about 360 km (220 miles) from Mukalla, the capital of Mukalla District and the largest city in the area, via western route. It is 12 km (7.5 miles)  from Shibam and 35 km (22 miles) from Tarim, the other large cities in the valley.
It is said that the origin of the city was a resting point for travellers. There was a café with a woman named Seiyun there, and the area was named after her in her honor. Since then, the city has become the largest area of Hadhramaut valley. Prominent villages surrounding the city include Madurah, Mérida, Burr, Hazkir, and Houta Sultana.
It is served by Seiyun Airport. It is also well known for the Seiyun Palace of the Sultan of Kathiri built in the 1920s with mud and stones. It oversees the marketplace for merchants coming from outside.

History
Seiyun is first mentioned in the beginning of the 4th century, during the reign of King Dhamar who ruled the area around Hadhramaut Valley at the time and was known for destroying 60,000 columns in the area. Destruction of the columns confirms that the Hadhramaut region was undergoing an economic prosperity owing to the spread of grape cultivation in large areas under the climatic conditions different from the current ones.
Seiyun during the Islamic period emerged as a village in the era of the Rashidun Caliphate. It was administratively part of the city of Tarim. This was the case during the Umayyad period as well. In 708, it became administratively affiliated with the city of Shibam. The son of Haritha led the revolution in 1179 but it gained its autonomy only in the year 1501 when it became the capital of the valley in the era of Badr Abu Tuwairq (1501-1556), where an administrative unit consisting of a sultanate that extended from Ain Ba to the west of the city of Dhofar was founded. In the 18th-century, Yafa conquered the cities of Hadhramaut and took over many parts of Seiyun, where the state was established. In 1852, it became the capital of the State of Kathiri (Aden-Kathiri) which was within the British Aden Protectorate (1869 - 1963). Its fortified fortress, the Sultan's Palace, was the seat of Sultan al-Kathiri. Postage stamps from the Sultanate were sometimes inscribed "Kathiri State of Seiyun." After the independence from British colonialism, Seiyun became the capital of the Southern district in the fifth province of Hadhramaut.

Geography
Sayun District covers an area of approximately 804 square kilometers. It is located in the central part of Hadramaut Governorate and Wadi Hadramaut, at a latitude of 15.57° North and a longitude of 48.46° East. It is bordered by the districts of Tarim and Sah, to the south, Tarim and Al-Quf to the north, Tarim to the east, and Shibam to the west. Sayun is situated 320 kilometers from the governorate's capital, Al Mukalla.
The terrain consists of a relatively flat plain, part of the Wadi Hadramaut, surrounded by mountain ranges on the northern and southern sides, leading to the northern and southern plateaus. Several sub-valleys of Wadi Hadramaut pass through these mountain ranges, including Wadi Shuhuh, Wadi Jathmah, and Wadi Bin Salman in Tarim, and Wadi Mudar in Bur.

Climate
The climate is tropical with a high temperature in the summer (26 - 42 °C) and a mild temperature in the winter (6 - 28 °C). Rain is rare and usually falls from mid-spring until autumn.

Demographics
According to the 2004 census projections, the population of Sayun District was approximately 111,728 people. The population density was estimated at around 139 people per square kilometer. The residential areas are concentrated in the city and its suburbs, as well as in areas like Taribah, Taris, Al-Gharfah, Wadi Bur, and Mudawwarah. Urban areas constitute approximately 47.4% of the population, while rural areas constitute 52.6%. Sayun District accounts for 10.9% of the total population of the governorate and 14.3% of the population in Wadi Hadramaut and the Desert.

Architecture
As for its architectural development, it can be summarized as follows: In the 7th century AH, it was a small village located within the district of Shaharah - Al-Sahil. It then developed to include other buildings, and a wall was built around it during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq in the year 922 AH. This wall remained until the year 1347 AH.
Regarding the buildings, in the 7th century AH, they were confined to Shaharah - Al-Sahil until the 8th century AH. The cemetery of the city was established in the 7th century outside the city in the eastern direction. Taha ibn Umar later acquired a piece of land far from the city and built a mosque (Taha Mosque), but there were no other architectural features. In the 10th century AH, the urbanization expanded due to its status as the capital of the Kathiri Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq (922-977 AH). In the year 1120 AH, Ali ibn Abdullah Al-Sqaf obtained a piece of desert land in the tribal district and built a mosque on it. The urbanization continued in the 14th century when Abu Bakr bin Salim Al-Saban acquired a piece of desert land in Wadi Jatham and built a mosque on it. The Seiyun Mosque was built in the 9th century AH to accommodate this development. In the 14th century, the mosque was rebuilt as a Friday mosque, and there are four mosques in Seiyun where Friday prayers are held: Al-Jami Mosque, Taha Mosque, Al-Qarn Mosque, and Basalam Mosque. The oldest of them is the Al-Jami Mosque in Seiyun, which was the only mosque where Friday prayers were held.

City Landmarks
There are many ancient landmarks in Seiyun, the most prominent of which are:

Seiyun Museum Palace
The Kathiri Palace, also known as the "Dawil Palace," is located in the center of Seiyun, making it one of the most prominent landmarks in the city and all of Hadhramaut. It is considered one of the most magnificent mud-brick architectural masterpieces.
This palace was initially established as the residence of the Sultan during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Jafar Al Kathiri, famously known as "Abu Tuwairq" (922-977 AH). This indicates that the palace existed before the reign of Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who made it his official residence and added a mosque to it. He also renovated the palace and expanded it. The Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who emerged during a period of bloody conflicts that engulfed most of the territories of Hadhramaut, managed to occupy most of these territories, including Shahr.
In the year 1125 AH, Omar bin Jafar Al Kathiri renewed the construction of the palace. In 1272 AH, Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri arrived in Seiyun and made it the capital of his rule. He used the Dawil Palace as his ruling headquarters and renovated it. Later, his son Mansour bin Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri continued the construction of the palace in the period between 1355-1357 AH, adding adornments and making expansions, including the construction of the Al-Aqra, which is the entrance leading to the palace, and building a large hall in the façade and its surroundings. The palace remains in the same state until now.
Recently, part of the palace has been utilized as a museum, which was inaugurated in 1983. The museum houses ancient artifacts collected from various sites in Wadi Hadhramaut, including those excavated from the Ribat site. It also features sections dedicated to folk heritage and historical documents, including those related to the Kathiri Sultanate when Seiyun served as its capital. Additionally, part of the palace has been designated as an administration office for the Ministry of Culture. A theater was also built on the southeast side of the palace in 1982, accommodating over 5000 spectators.

Seiyun Olympic Stadium
Seiyun Olympic Stadium is one of the largest stadiums in Yemen and the largest in Hadhramaut, capable of accommodating over 35,000 spectators.

Qarat Al-Ar
Qarat Al-Ar houses an ancient fortress mentioned in the year 616 AH when it was cited by historians as the place where Sultan Abdullah bin Rashid Al Qahtani was imprisoned and killed. Later, the fortress was renewed in 855 AH during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Ali Al Kathiri, who used it as a prison for sultans.

Hisn Al-Fals
Hisn Al-Fals is an ancient fortress mentioned initially by historians in the year 603 AH. Its age is estimated to be around 400 years, as it was built during the reign of Sultan Badr Bintuwaireq or the period that followed. It is situated on a hill in the center of Al-Qarn neighborhood in Seiyun and served as an advanced military fortress, with its edges meeting the extensions of the historical wall of Seiyun.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hadhramaut (Arabic: حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Ḥaḍramawt ; Hadrami Arabic: حَضْرَمُوت, romanized: Ḥaḍramūt ) is a geographic region in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula which includes the Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Shabwah and Mahrah, Dhofar in southwestern Oman, and Sharurah in the Najran Province of Saudi Arabia, and sometimes the Aden, Abyan and Lahij governorates of Yemen at a more stretched historical definition. The region's people are known as the Hadharem. They formerly spoke Hadramautic, an old South Arabian language, but they now predominantly speak the Hadhrami dialect of Arabic.
Though the origins of the name are unknown, the name Hadhramaut is traditionally explained as a compound word meaning "death has come" or "court of death," derived either from the Arabic ḥaḍara ("he came") plus mawt ("death"), a folk nickname for Amer bin Qahtan, the region's legendary first settler, or from the Biblical Hebrew ḥaṣar ("court" or "dwelling") plus māweṯ ("death") as seen in Hazarmaveth. The name is of ancient origin and is reflected in the name of the modern-day Yemeni governorate of Hadhramaut.
The boundaries of Hadhramaut stretches from the Empty Quarter desert in the north down through its Wadi Hadhramaut and its coastal plain on the Arabian Sea, historically spanning from modern-day Aden in the west across Dhofar to the east but today spans Yemen's Shabwah from the west and Oman's Dhofar to the east. The region once comprised the Qu'aiti and Kathiri sultanates whose lands now form the Hadhramaut governorate, with tribal Hadhrami towns clustered around oasis wells in the wadis, where they farm wheat, millet, dates, coconuts and coffee, while Bedouin herders graze flocks on the plateau. Physically, the region divides into Inner Hadhramaut,centered on the main wadi and its tributaries, and Coastal Hadhramaut, a narrow plain backed by the steep Jowl escarpment rising to about 1,370 m; to the north the highland plateau (Haḍbat Ḥaḍramawt) slopes down sharply into the Empty Quarter, creating a transition from lush valley to arid desert.

Toponymy
The origins of the name Ḥaḍramawt is disputed, and numerous debated hypotheses regarding its meaning exist. The most popular folk etymology is that the word comes from a nickname of Amer bin Qahtan, who is thought to be the first person to dwell in the region, meaning "death has come", from the words in Arabic: حَضَر, romanized: ḥaḍara, lit. 'he came' and Arabic: مَوْت, romanized: mawt, lit. 'death'. Another theory is that it is a variant of the name of Islamic prophet Hud who was sent to this region or his last words "Ludara al-mawt," meaning "death has come."
The name Ḥaḍramawt has also been found within Biblical Hazarmaveth. The name means "court of death" and is composed of two parts: Hebrew: חֲצַרְ, romanized: ḥaṣar, lit. 'dwelling; court' and Hebrew: מָוֶת māweṯ "death". There, Hud was the descendant of ʿĀd, son of Joktan, the purported ancestor and progenitor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to tradition, the family of ʿĀd was the first to settle in the region, and when the sons of ʿĀd had died, Amer bin Qahtan, nicknamed "Hadhramaut", came to power.
Though the origins of the name are unknown, there are several scholarly proposals. Kamal Salibi says that the diphthong "-aw" is an incorrect vocalisation, noting that "-ūt" is a frequent ending for place names in the Ḥaḍramawt; given that "Ḥaḍramūt" is the colloquial pronunciation of the name, and also its ancient pronunciation, the correct reading of the name would thus be "place of ḥḍrm". Salibi proposes, then, that the name means "the green place", which is appropriate given its well-irrigated wadis, giving a lushness that contrasts with the surrounding high desert plateau.
Variations of the name are attested to as early as the middle of the 1st millennium BC. The names ḥḍrmt (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩩) and ḥḍrmwt (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩥𐩩) are found in texts of the Old South Arabian languages (Ḥaḍramitic, Minaic, Qatabanic and Sabaic), though the second form is not found in any known Ḥaḍramitic inscriptions. In either form, the word itself can be a toponym, a tribal name, or the name of the kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt. In the late fourth or early 3rd century BC, Theophrastus gives the name Άδρραμύτα, a direct transcription of the Semitic name into Greek.

History
Prehistory
The earliest human activities in the region date from the Middle Palaeolithic, with the local population using a Levallois technique for flake preparation until the appearance of tools produced by a desert-dwelling pre-agricultural population. From this latter period, or perhaps the succeeding one, can be dated several megalithic structures, large stone circles, and four dolmen-like strictures whose inner surfaces were decorated with repetitive rows of pecked meander or crenellated design.

Ancient
The Kingdom of Hadhramaut was established in the early 1st millennium BCE. Its capital was Shabwa, not far from the city of Teman (the capital of the Kingdom of Qataban), a tribal federation consisting of several tribes united by their common veneration of the lunar god Sin. Hadhramaut became independent from Sheba in c. 330 BCE.  Hadhramaut and its god Sin are mentioned in the inscription of Surwah by the Makrib Sabean writer Karib'il Watar I around 700–680 BCE.
The Kingdom, led by King Shahr-al-Khuraymat, allied with the Minaeans and the Kingdom of Qataban and became independent from the Kingdom of Sheba around 330 BCE, during which the Himyarite dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Sheba. The relationship between the Kingdom of Hadhramaut and the Himyarite Kingdom remained tense, with both sides waging wars against each other for control of the trade routes and territory in the region. Early Islamic authors believed the nomadic Kinda tribe that founded a kingdom in central Arabia were originally from Hadhramaut, although distinct from the settled Hadhrami population.

The Hadhrami are referred to as "Chatramotitai" in ancient Greek texts. Hadhramautic texts come later than Sabaean ones, and some Sabaean texts from Hadhramaut are known. Greek, Latin, Sabaean and Hadhramautic texts preserve the names of many kings of Hadhramaut, but there is as yet no definitive chronology of their reigns. Their capital was Shabwa in the northwest corner of the kingdom, along the Incense trade route. Eratosthenes called it a metropolis. It was an important cult centre as well. At first, the religion was South Arabian polytheism, distinguished by the worship of the Babylonian moon god Sin. By the sixth century, the monotheistic cult of Rahmanan was followed in the local temple.
The political history of Hadhramaut is not easy to piece together. Numerous wars involving Hadhramaut are referenced in Sabaean texts. From their inscriptions, the Hadhrami are known to have fortified Libna (now Qalat) against Himyar and to have fortified mwyt (Ḥiṣn al-Ghurāb حِصْن ٱلْغُرَاب) against the Kingdom of Aksum in the period following the death of Dhū Nuwās. The kingdom ceased to exist by the end of the 3rd century CE, having been annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom. Hadhramaut continued to be used in the full titulature of the kings of Sabaʾ and Dhu Raydān (Himyar).
In the 2nd century CE, Hadhramaut was known for its frankincense and myrrh trade. The incense trade route (southern incense route) that passed through the southern part of Hadhramaut helped the region flourish economically and culturally. The Kingdom of Hadhramaut played a significant role in connecting the cultures of Arabia, Mesopotamia, East Africa, and the Roman Empire.

Middle Ages
Islamic
Islam reached Hadhramaut in c. 630 after Islamic prophet Muhammad sent Wael bin Hajar as a da'i to the region. The tribes of the region and the ancient aristocracy initially resisted the religion for a considerable period with the city of Tarim being the only adopter of the religion. Nevertheless, companions of Muhammad like Miqdad ibn Aswad and Islamic military leaders like Qaisabah ibn Kalthum were from the region.
In the 11th century, the Hadhramaut region came under the rule of the Mahdids, who were of Banu Hadhrami origin. They established the Qasimi dynasty, which ruled the region for several centuries.
was reportedly from Hadhramaut. Several prophets before them are believed to have dwelt here, including Hud of ʿĀd. He is thought to be buried at Qabr Hud.

Portuguese and Ottoman Influence
In the 16th century, the Portuguese arrived in Hadhramaut and established several settlements along the southern coast. However, their influence was short-lived as the Yemeni Imams managed to drive them out by the 17th century. Subsequently, Hadhramaut came under Ottoman influence, and the Ottomans maintained control over the region until the early 20th century.

Modern
Sultanates and the British rule
The Qu'aiti sultans ruled the vast majority of Hadramaut, under a loose British protectorate, the Aden Protectorate, from 1882 to 1967, when the Hadhramaut was annexed by South Yemen. The Qu'aiti dynasty was founded by Umar bin Awadh al-Qu'aiti, a Yafa'i tribesman whose wealth and influence as hereditary Jemadar of the Nizam of Hyderabad's armed forces enabled him to establish the Qu'aiti dynasty in the latter half of the 19th century, winning British recognition of his paramount status in the region in 1882. The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937, appointing the British government as "advisors" in Hadhramaut. The British exiled him to Aden in 1945, but the Protectorate lasted until 1967.

Communist rule
In 1967, the former states of the British Aden Protectorate became an independent Communist state, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. South Yemen was united with North Yemen in 1990 as the Republic of Yemen.

Contemporary Yemen
The capital and largest city of Hadhramaut is the port Mukalla. Mukalla had a 1994 population of 122,400 and a 2003 population of 174,700, while the port city of Ash Shihr has grown from 48,600 to 69,400 in the same time. One of the more historically important cities in the region is Tarim. An important locus of Islamic learning, it is estimated to contain the highest concentration of descendants of Muhammad anywhere in the world.

Geography
Political geography
The borders of Hadhramaut have varied over time to include the territory between Aden and Dhofar, but it always included the Wadi Hadhramaut, the lands between the Wadi and the coast, and the desert region of the Empty Quarter north of the Wadi. This encompasses the current governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra in their entirety as well as parts of the Shabwah Governorate. The current governorate of Hadhramaut roughly incorporates the former territory of the two sultanates.
The Hadharem live in densely built towns centered on traditional watering stations along the wadis. Hadharem harvest crops of wheat and millet, tend date palm and coconut groves, and grow some coffee. On the plateau, Bedouins tend sheep and goats. Society is still highly tribal, with the old Seyyid aristocracy, descended from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, traditionally educated, strict in their Islamic observance, and highly respected in religious and secular affairs.

Physical geography
Hadhramaut is geographically divided into Inner Hadhramaut (Hadrami Arabic: حضرموت الداخل) which is made up of Wadi Hadhramaut, smaller tributary wadis south from the main wadi, and Coastal Hadhramaut (Hadrami Arabic: حضرموت الساحل) which consists of a narrow, arid coastal plain bounded by the steep escarpment of a broad plateau locally known as the Jowl (Hadrami Arabic: ٱلْجَوْل, romanized: al-Jawl, averaging 1,370 m (4,490 ft)). The undefined northern edge of Hadhramaut slopes down to the desert of the Empty Quarter, where the Hadhramaut Plateau or Highlands (Arabic: هَضْبَة حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Haḍbat Ḥaḍramawt) meets the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, elevation abruptly decreases.

Inner Hadhramaut
Mountains
The Hadhramaut Mountains (Arabic: جِبَال حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Jibāl Ḥaḍramawt), also known as the "Mahrat Mountains" (Arabic: جِبَال ٱلْمَهْرَة, romanized: Jibāl Al-Mahrah), are a mountain range in Yemen. They are contiguous with the Omani Dhofar Mountains to the northeast, and James Canton considered Aden in the southwest to be in the mountains' recesses.

Wadis
Wadi Hadhramaut (Arabic: وادي حضرموت) is the main wadi in the region, which has 16 tributary wadis, which are:

Economy
Historically, Hadhramaut was known for being a major producer of frankincense, which in the early 20th century was mainly exported to Mumbai in India. The region has also produced senna and coconut. Farming and fishing are other economic activities in the region, where 5.8% of Yemen's total agriculture comes from the Hadhramaut Governorate alone. Key agricultural products from this region include dates and various grains. Additionally, the fishing sector serves as a primary economic resource for the local population, benefiting from a lengthy coastline along the Arabian Sea that is rich in diverse fish and marine life.
The governorate's lands also hold mineral resources, notably oil and gold, further enhancing its economic significance. Currently, Hadhramaut produces approximately 260,000 barrels of oil per day; one of the most productive fields is Al Maseelah in the strip (14), which was discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is keen to develop its oil fields to increase oil production to increase national wealth in response to the requirements of economic and social development in the country. Oil contributes 30–40% of the nation's GDP, over 70% of total state revenues, and more than 90% of the value of the country's exports.

Oil and gas
A Soviet discovery in the southern governorate of Shabwah has proven only marginally successful even when taken over by a different group. A Western consortium began exporting oil from Masila in the Hadhramaut in 1993, and production there reached 67,000 m3/d (420,000 bbl/d) in 1999. There are new finds in the Jannah (formerly known as the Joint Oil Exploration Area) and east Shabwah blocks. Yemen's oil exports in 1995 earned about US$1 billion. Yemen's offshore oil and gas deposits are estimated to contain billions of barrels of oil and gas. Marib oil contains associated natural gas. In September 1995, the Yemeni Government signed an agreement that designated TotalEnergies of France to be the lead company for a project for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1997, Yemen Gas Company joined with various privately held companies to establish Yemen LNG (YLNG).

In August 2005, the government gave final approval to three LNG supply agreements, enabling YLNG to award a $2 billion contract to an international consortium to build the country's first liquefaction plant at Balhaf on the Arabian Sea coast. The project is a $3.7 billion investment over 25 years, producing approximately 6.7 million tons of LNG annually, with shipments likely to go to the United States and South Korea. Production of LNG began in October 2009. The Yemen government expects the LNG project to add $350 million to its budget and enable it to develop a petrochemicals industry.
Hadramout produces approximately 258.8 thousand barrels per day. One of the prominent oil fields is the Masila Basin Sector (14), discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is committed to developing its oil fields to increase oil production, aiming to enhance national wealth in response to the country's economic and social development needs. Oil contributes between 30% and 40% of the gross domestic product (GDP) value and represents more than 70% of the total general budget revenues of the state. Moreover, it constitutes more than 90% of the country's export value.

Culture
Music and dance
Hadhrami Music is one of the five main Yemeni musical genres or "colours" (alwan). It is native to the Hadhramaut region and regarded as one of the most prominent forms of Arabic music. Its unique maqamat are widely employed by composers and musicians throughout the Arabian Peninsula. It compasses vocal performances in the Hadhrami Arabic dialect and features melodic phrases and a characteristic humming-style known as the Dan.
Hadhramaut's strategic location along the ancient incense road has shaped a unique musical tradition. Indian and African musical elements have intermingled with indigenous forms over time. Besides, It has been deeply influenced by Sufism.

The region is renowned for its vast array of over four hundred distinct rhythmic patterns that vary by locality. These rhythms are closely tied to daily activities and special occasions—from planting and fishing to wedding celebrations. A key musical form in the region is al-Dan, a fixed melodic structure in which the melody precedes the lyrics; in contrast, in other songs, the lyrics typically come before the melody. Steps have been taken by the Yemeni government to include the Dan art on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, Cultural authorities in Yemen have already received initial approval from UNESCO to consider its inclusion.
Numerous art critics note that the Hadhrami Dan has played a pivotal role in shaping vocal traditions throughout the Arab world, particularly within the Gulf region. This distinctive musical form is regarded as a foundational element for many singing schools, with contemporary artists continuing to draw inspiration from its rich heritage and folkloric melodies.
The Hadhrami Dan has spread to the Arabian Gulf through the migration of Hadhrami musicians who settled in Gulf countries. Over time, local musicians integrated the Hadhrami Dan and other forms of the Dan and other Hadhrami musical forms into their own repertoires. Furthermore, Hadhrami music has significantly influenced the cultural landscapes of regions beyond the Arabian Peninsula, notably in parts of Africa and East Asia.

Several Hadhrami influential musicians and poets played an important role in shaping Hadhrami and the wider Arabian music. Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih (1932–2017), for example, modernised al-Dân songs by incorporating contemporary musical instruments, while poets such as Haddad al-Kaff (1910–1970) and Hussein al-Mihdhar (1932–2000) enriched the tradition with their lyrics. Additionally, Mohammed Juma Khan (1903–1963) is celebrated as a pioneer who blended his Punjabi musical influences with local traditions.
Moreover, several prominent non-Hadhrami Arab musicians have also embraced Hadhrami styles. These include Kuwaiti singer Abdallah Al Rowaished; Saudi singers Abdul Majeed Abdullah and Abdel Rab Idris, the latter of Hadhrami origin; as well as Emirati singers Ahlam and Hussain Al Jassmi.
The instruments used in Hadhrami music vary widely, encompassing percussion instruments, string instruments, wind instruments, and simple clapping techniques, often used individually or in combination. This includes notably the Qanbūs, which the Hadhrami migrants spread across the Indian Ocean across the  Muslim Southeast Asia areas (notably in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei).

Architecture
The Hadhramaut region has significant tourism potential due to its historical and cultural heritage. The ancient city of Shibam, known as "the Manhattan of the Desert," is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is famous for its high-rise mud-brick buildings and has attracted tourists worldwide. Other notable tourist attractions in the region include the historic towns of Tarim and Seiyun, the Wadi Hadramout with its lush palm groves, and the traditional mud-brick architecture found throughout the region.
Mukalla, a coastal city in the Hadhramaut region. The city's buildings exhibit intricate facades adorned with geometric patterns, reflecting local craftsmanship. Minarets with delicate latticework rise gracefully, reflecting a blend of architectural and spiritual significance. Mukalla's urban design features narrow alleys and courtyard houses, showcasing adaptation to the arid climate and fostering community interaction. The use of indigenous materials further emphasizes its connection to the local context.

Tarim has a distinctive Hadhrami architecture with filigreed facades and minarets. It has interconnected alleyways and courtyards. Tarim was the Islamic Capital of Culture in 2010. It has the world's tallest mudbrick minaret, located in the Al-Muhdhar Mosque. There are initiatives to protect and restore its mud structures.

Shibam, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mudbrick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.
Shibam is often called "the oldest skyscraper city in the world". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 m (98 feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. The city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name "the walled city of Shibam".

Habban, an ancient city within the Shabwa governorate, boasts a distinct architectural legacy characterized by ingenious mud and straw construction techniques. Notable features include towering mud structures with intricate carvings, reflecting both historical significance and artistic flair. Habban's architecture showcases a blend of utilitarian functionality and aesthetic charm. The enduring mud buildings' diverse architectural styles, including palaces, mosques, and tombs, capture the city's cultural tapestry. Rooted in Yemeni heritage, Habban's architecture is a living embodiment of the intersection between local culture and the built environment, reflecting the city's historical and cultural significance.

Demographics
The people of the region are known as the Hadharem, generally belong to the Semitic south Arabians who claim descent from Yarub bin Qahtan. There is, however, a large number of Sada (Hadrami Arabic: سادة, romanized: Sadah; Singular: Sayyid), or descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and of townsmen of northern origin, besides a considerable class of African or mixed descent. The Sada, descendants of Husain ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic Prophet, form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, the chiefs of which are known as Munsibs, who are looked on as the religious leaders of the people and are even, in some cases are regarded with great respect as saints. Among the leading families are that of Sheikh Abu Bakar bin Salem (Hadrami Arabic: الشيخ ابو بكر بن سالم) of ʽAynat, al-Aidarus (Hadrami Arabic: العيدروس) of Shihr and Wadi Dawan, Bin Sumayt (Hadrami Arabic: بن سميط) of Shibam and the Sakkaf (Hadrami Arabic: سقاف) of Seiyun. They do not bear arms, nor occupy themselves in trade, nor manual labour, nor even agriculture; though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes, they are well educated and are strict in their observance of religious duties, and owing to the respect due to their descent, they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual affairs.
The Mashayikh (Hadrami Arabic: المشايخ) is another highly regarded group that is second in prestige to the Sada. Like the Sada, they don't bear arms. Men from this group are given the honorific surname Sheikh (Hadrami Arabic: شيخ) and women are given the surname Sheikha (Hadrami Arabic: شيخة) which is different from the term Sheikh (Arabic: شيخ) that is used to refer to a tribal chief or a Muslim scholar. Prominent Mashayikh families include the ‘Amudi (Hadrami Arabic: العمودي), Ba Wazir (Hadrami Arabic: با وزير), and Ba ‘Abbad (Hadrami Arabic: با عبّاد) families.
The Qaba'il (Hadrami Arabic: القبائل) or tribesmen, as in the rest of Arabia, are the predominant class in the population. All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns and villages, others live a bedouin life, keeping however within the territory which is recognised as belonging to the tribe. They are divided into sections or families, each headed by a chief while the head of the tribe is called the muqaddam or sultan. He is the leader in peace and in war, but the tribesmen are not his subjects; he can only rule with their support. Historically, the most powerful tribes in Hadhramaut was the Qu’aiti, a branch of the Yafa'a tribe. Originally invited by the Sada to protect the settled districts against the marauding tribes, they established themselves as rulers of the country, and possessed the coastal districts with the towns of Mukalla and Shihr as well as Shibam in the interior. The family had accumulated great wealth and was  in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad in India as commander of the Arab levy composed of his tribesmen.
The townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Sada and the tribesmen; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, merchants, artificers, cultivators, and servants and are entirely dependent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live. The servile class contains a large African element, brought over formerly when the slave trade nourished on this coast; as all Islamic countries they are well treated, and often rise to positions of trust.

Hadhrami diaspora
Since the early 19th century, large-scale Hadhramaut migration has established sizable Hadhrami minorities all around the Indian Ocean, in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Africa, including Mombasa, Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Maharashtrian Konkan, Mangalore, Bhatkal, Gangolli, Malabar, Sylhet, Tanzania, the Malay Archipelago, Sri Lanka, southern Philippines and Singapore. In Hyderabad and Aurangabad, the community is known as Chaush and resides mostly in the neighborhood of Barkas. There are also settlements of Hadharem  in Gujarat, such as in Ahmadabad and Surat. In South India, the Nawayath community also descends from Hadrami traders.
Earlier, several sultans in the Malay Archipelago such as the Malacca Sultanate, Pontianak Sultanate or Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura were descents of Hadharem . In the 19th century, Hadhrami businessmen owned many of the maritime armada of barks, brigs, schooners and other ships in the Malay archipelago. In modern times, several Indonesian ministers, including former Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and former Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad are of Hadhrami descent, as is the former Prime Minister of East Timor, Mari Alkatiri (2006).
The Hadharem  have also settled in large numbers along the East African coast, and two former ministers in Kenya, Shariff Nasser and Najib Balala, are of Hadhrami descent. It has also been proved by genetic evidence that the Lemba people of Southern Africa bear some relation to the people of Hadramaut.
Within the Hadhramaut region there has been a historical Jewish population.
