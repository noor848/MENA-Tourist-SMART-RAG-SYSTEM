      "content": "Khartoum, also spelled Khartum, is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North (الخرطوم بحري al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī) and Omdurman (أم درمان Umm Durmān) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as al-Mogran or al-Muqran (المقرن; English: \"The Confluence\").\nKhartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.\nIn 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\nIn 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.\nKhartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word Khartoum is uncertain. Some Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words khar-tuom (Dinka-Bor dialect) or khier-tuom (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to \"place where rivers meet\". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.\nOne folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic khurṭūm (خرطوم 'trunk' or 'hose'), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. \nCaptain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic qurṭum (قرطم 'safflower', i.e., Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word Agartum, meaning \"the abode of Atum\", Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest Khartoum is derived from the Beja word hartoom, \"meeting\". Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, khartoum means \"we have acquired\" and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.\n\nHistory\n19th century\nIn 1821, Khartoum was established 24 km (15 mi) north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma'il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.\nA significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city's public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry \"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\". \nOn 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and the entire garrison was annihilated. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. \nWith the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was established as the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Herbert Kitchener became Governor-General of the Sudan in September 1898, and began a programme of reconstruction, Khartoum was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape. He ordered the mosques of Khartoum rebuilt and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens. He also prevented Christian missionaries from trying to proselytize the local Muslims.\n\n20th century\nThe city rapidly grew and developed under British administration. Under Reginald Wingate (1899–1916), the Governor-General's Palace in Khartoum was rebuilt using red bricks, with sandstone used for the corners. The buildings in Khartoum proper were modeled after Victorian architecture, with a distinct Middle Eastern influence as well as Mediterranean-style windows and balconies. The Gordon Memorial College (now the University of Khartoum) was opened in 1903, and a new railway to Port Sudan was completed in 1919. These developments prompted large migration from rural areas, resulting in an increase in the city's population. By 1930, Khartoum was estimated to have a population of over 50,000.\nKhartoum continued to grow after it was declared the capital of the newly independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. Within the following years, the Municipal Stadium, the Khartoum American School and the Bank of Sudan would be established. This large scale development would spurred rural to urban migration, by 1964 Khartoum's population had ballooned to 185,000. In the 1973 census Khartoum would have a population of 334,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\"\nIn 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed. The Organization of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur – fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict – have settled around Khartoum.\nIn 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.\nIn November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five \"Peace Camps\" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and \"the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat\". Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.\n\n21st century\nThe sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.\nThe African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir's government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.\nOn 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.\nOn 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.\nOn 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.\nOn 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.\nOn 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, which the RSF claimed to have captured. The Sudanese Armed Forces regained full control of Khartoum on 26 March 2025.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. \nKhartoum is relatively flat, at elevation 385 m (1,263 ft), as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation 364 m (1,194 ft) about 163 km (101 mi) away.\n\nClimate\nKhartoum features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert's vast arid areas and the Sahel's vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than 5 mm (0.20 in). The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.\nThe very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about 48 mm (1.9 in). The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only 121.3 mm (4.78 in) of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with 10 mm (0.39 in) or more and 19 days with 1 mm (0.039 in) or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed 39 °C (102 °F) in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above 15 °C (59 °F). Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around 30 °C (86 °F). The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below 30 °C (86 °F). This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.\n\nDemographics\nAlmost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.\n\nEconomy\nAfter the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.\nIn the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.\nAmong the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.\n\nRetailing\nThe Souq al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.\nAl Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.\nAfra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.\nIn 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\nEducation\nKhartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:\n\nKindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consisting of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).\nElementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.\nUpper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students' ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.\nHigher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the University of Khartoum and Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nTransportation\nKhartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.\nKhartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.\n\nKhartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.\nKhartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.\nSince independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.\nThe Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints' cathedral on Sharia al-Jama'a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.\nThe Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama'a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.\n\nBotanical gardens\nKhartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.\n\nClubs\nKhartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, the Coptic Club, the Syrian Club and the International Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew's Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).\n\nIn popular culture\nLiterature\nKhartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in \"Reading Khartoum\", the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.\n\nMovies\nSong of Khartoum (1955)\nKhartoum (1966 film) (1966)\nKhartoum Offside (2019)\n\nNotable people\nSara Berkai, Eritrean and British social enterprise founder and STEM educator, born in Khartoum\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKidnapped, tortured and thrown in jail: my 70 days in Sudan The Guardian, 2017\nWerner, Louis (April 2018). \"Khartoum: A Tale of Two Rivers\".

      "content": "الْخَرْطُوْم هيَ عاصمة السُّودان وحاضرة ولاية الخرطُوم، تقع عند نقطة التقاء النّيل الأبيض بالنّيل الأزرق (المقرن)، ليُشكلا معاً نهر النيل. وهي مركز الحكم في السُّودان حيث يوجد فيها مقر رئيس الجمهورية والحكومة، ورئاسة الوزارات المركزية المختلفة وقيادة القوات المسلحة السودانية والبعثات الدبلوماسية الأجنبية من سفارات وقنصليات، ومقر بعض المنظمات الإقليمية العربية والإفريقية ومعظم المؤسسات السياسية للدولة. وهي قلب أفريقيا بالنسبة لخطوط الطيران، وذلك لمرور خطوط الطيران التي تقطع شمال القارة تجاه جنوبها وتلك التي تمر عبر غرب القارة وشرقها. يوجد بالمدينة العديد من الجامعات والكليات الحكومية والخاصة والمؤسسات التعليمية المختلفة ورئاسات الشركات والبنوك الوطنية وفروع الشركات الأجنبية.\nيرجع تاريخ تأسيس الخرطوم كعاصمة، إلى العقود الأولى من القرن التاسع عشر أثناء فترة الحكم العثماني المصري في السودان حيثُ اتخذت عاصمة للبلاد، إلا أن تاريخها كموقع استيطان بشري أبعد من ذلك بكثير فقد سكنها الإنسان منذ العصر الحجري، كما كان موقعها موطن حضارة قديمة عُرفت بمملكة علوة وشهد القَرن الماضي أول مرحلة من مراحل ازدهارها عندما شُيّدت العمارة في العهد البريطاني المصري على النسق المعماري الإنجليزي والذي لا يزال ماثلاً للعيان في الأبنية القديمة بجامعة الخرطوم ومبنى وزارة المالية ومصلحة البريد والبرق وبعض المرافق الحكومية المطلة على النيل وتحول بعضها إلى متاحف مفتوحة للجمهور، وفي بعض الجسور القديمة المقامة على نهر النيل والتي تربطها بما يحيط بها من مناطق حضرية. يبلغ عدد سكان مدينة الخرطوم 2,682,431 نسمة، وهي بذلك سادس مدينة من حيث عدد السكان في إفريقيا (ولا يشمل الرقم باقي سكان العاصمة المثلثة البالغ عددهم 5,172,000 تقريباً) ويمثل سكانها مختلف الإثنيات والمجموعات السكانية من داخل السودان وخارجه بالإضافة إلى أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين وغيرهم من الوافدين السياسيين، والمناخ في الخرطوم معتدل في فصل الشتاء مع ارتفاع في درجات الحرارة في الصيف وهطول أمطار غزيرة في موسم الخريف، وتتميز المدينة بموقعها الإستراتيجي في وسط السودان حيث التقاء النيل الأزرق بالنيل الأبيض، الذي جعل منها منطقة جذب سياحي تزخر بالمعالم الطبيعية والأثرية، ومحور نقل واتصالات محليّة وإقليمية.\n\nالخرطوم الكبرى\nيتعين التمييز بين الخرطوم العاصمة القومية أو  العاصمة المثلثة كما يطلق عليها أحياناً، والخرطوم الولاية، وبينهما وبين الخرطوم المدينة، أو الخرطوم عموم كما تسمى. ويقصد بالعاصمة المثلثة التجمع الميتروبوليتي المتكوّن من المدن الثلاث التي تنتشر فيها المصالح والدواوين الحكومية وترتبط مع بعضها البعض جغرافياً وإدارياً واجتماعياً، وهي الخرطوم عموم الواقعة على الضفة الجنوبية والغربية للنيل الأزرق والضفة الشرقية للنيل الأبيض، والمدينة الثانية هي أم درمان وتقع على الضفة الغربية للنيل الأبيض ونهر النيل أي المجرى الذي يتكون من النيلين الأزرق والأبيض بعد التقائهما عند نقطة المقرن. والمدينة الثالثة هي الخرطوم بحري (أي الخرطوم شمال، كما تسمى باللغة الإنجليزية. لفظ بحري باللهجة المصرية يرادف لفظ شمال بالفصحى) وتقع على الضفة الشمالية للنيل الأزرق والضفة الشرقية لنهر النيل. وأما الخرطوم الولاية، أي ولاية الخرطوم فهذه تشمل المدن الثلاث وضواحيها وبعض المناطق المحيطة بها وهي إحدى ولايات السودان.\n\nأصل التسمية\nاختلفت الروايات حول سبب تسمية المدينة بهذا الاسم وحول أصل التسمية ومعنى اللفظ. فهناك من يقول بأن التسمية ترجع إلى شكل قطعة الأرض التي تقع عليها المدينة والتي يشقها نهري النيل ويلتقيان فيها مع بعضهما في شكل انحنائي يرسمان بينهما قطعة أرض أشبه بخرطوم الفيل وهو الرأي الراجح،\nإلا أن الرحالة البريطاني كابتن جيمس جرانت الذي رافق الكابتن جون اسبيك في رحلته الاستكشافية لمنابع النيل ذكر بأن الاسم مشتق من زهرة القرطم التي كانت تزرع بكثافة في المنطقة لتصديرها إلى مصر لاستخراج الزيت منها للإنارة وقد استخدمها الرومان عند غزوهم لمصر ووصولهم إلى شمال السودان حيث عثروا على زهرة القرطم في موقع الخرطوم الحالي واستخدموا الزيت المستخرج من حبوبها في علاج جروح جنودهم. وهناك أيضاً تفسيرات أخرى للاسم لا سند لها مثل «خور التوم» نسبة إلى شخص يدعى التوم.\nوالخرطوم في اللغة هو الأنف من الإنسان، حيث قال تعالى: (إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءاياتُنَا قَالَ أَسَاطِيرُ الأَوَّلِينَ سَنَسِمُهُ عَلَى الْخُرْطُومِ)،(قرأن كريم، سورة القلم، آية 15، 16) أي سوف نجعل له الوسم بالسواد على أنفه، وقيل على وجهه فيكون له وسمة. وقال قتادة سنسمه على الخرطوم بمعنى أن نضع سيما على أنفه. والمعنى من الآيات هو الوليد بن المغيرة.\nوالخرطوم هو أيضاً اسم لأنف السبع أو الفيل وهو ما يتماشى لغوياُ مع معنى تسمية الخرطوم.\n\nالتاريخ\nأُسست الخرطوم كمدينة على يد الجيش العثماني في عهد محمد علي باشا عندما أرسل جيشه لضم السودان إلى مُلكه بقيادة ابنه الثالث إسماعيل كامل باشا عام 1821م، واتخذها الأتراك في البداية معسكراً لجيوشهم ثم تحولت إلى عاصمة لهم في عهد عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي عام 1824م وذلك بعد تعيينه حكمدارا (حاكماً) على السودان خلفا للحكمدار محمد بك خسرو الدفتردار.\n\nالتاريخ القديم\nيعود تاريخ الخرطوم كمستوطنة بشرية إلى عصور سحيقة حيث أكدت المستحثات على أن الإنسان قد استوطن في موقع الخرطوم الحالي منذ سنة 400 قبل الميلاد، وتم العثور على أدوات تعود إلى العصر الحجري في منطقة خور أبو عنجة في مدينة أم درمان الحالية القريبة من الخرطوم، إضافة إلى بقايا أثرية لمستوطنات يرجع تاريخها إلى عهد مملكتي نبتة ومروي في الفترة من 750 قبل الميلاد إلى 350 بعد الميلاد.\nوتقول مصادر أخرى ترجع في تاريخها إلى القرن السادس عشر الميلادي بأن المكان الذي تقوم عليه الآن الخرطوم كان عبارة عن أحراش وغابات، وكان يبعد عن مدينة سوبا عاصمة مملكة علوة، إحدى الممالك المسيحية القديمة في السودان، حوالي 24 كيلومتر (15 ميل). وفي القرن السادس عشر قام سكان جزيرة توتي التي تقع في مجري نهر النيل المقابل للمكان - وكانوا ينتمون إلى قبيلة (المحس) النوبية - بزراعة المكان، قبل أن يقيم فيه أحد فقهائهم ويدعى الشيخ أرباب العقائد مدرسة لتعليم القرآن ويتحول تدريجياً إلى منطقة سكنية.\n\nالممالك المسيحية\nورد ذكر سوبا باعتبارها عاصمة لمملكة علوة وهي الآن المنطقة الجنوبية للخرطوم في كتب عدد من الرحالة العرب والمسلمين، فقد ذكرها اليعقوبي بقوله «والمملكة الثانية من النوبة الذين يقال لهم علوة وفي سنة 360 هجرية (970، ميلادية) زار منطقة الخرطوم أحمد بن حوقل، ودون في كتابه صورة الأرض أنه تجول في منطقة سوبا وذكر بأن بها جماعة من المسلمين، كما وصف منطقة النيل الأبيض وقال: «من وراء النيل نهر عظيم يسمى بحر أبيض سكانه جنس من النوبة» وصف ابن حوقل سوبا بأنها «أوسع من الحبشة وعمارتها أكثر مما بالحبشة، ويخترق نيل مصر فيما بين مدنهم ونواحيهم. وقراهم عامرة خصبة كثيرة التمر والزرع والخضر. ومن أعمر بلادهم نواحي علوة وهي ناحية لها قرى متصلة وعمارات مشتبكة حتى إن السائر ليجتاز في الرحلة الواحدة بقرى عدة غير متقطعة الحدود، ذوات مياه متصلة بسواق من النيل»، كذلك كتب عنها ابن سليم الأسواني في القرن العاشر الميلادي وقال إن «المسافة ما بين دنقلة إلى أول بلد علوة، أكثر مما بينها وأسوان. وفي ذلك من القرى والضياع والجزائر والمواشي والنخل والشجر والمقل الزرع والكرم، أضعاف ما في الجانب الذي يلي أرض الإسلام.. ومتملك علوة أكثر مالاً من متملك المقرة وأعظم جيشاً، وعنده من الخيل ما ليس عند المقرى، وبلده أخصب وأوسع»، أما أبو صالح الأرمني فقد ذكر عن سوبا بأن «بها جيش ومملكة عظيمة جداً وأعمال متسعة، وبها أربعمائة كنيسة. وهذه المدينة في شرقي الجزيرة الكبيرة بين البحرين الأبيض والأخضر، وجميع من بها نصارى يعاقبة، حولها ديارات متباعدة من البحر، ومنها ما هو على البحر، وبها كنيسة عظيمة جداً متسعة محكمة الوضع والبناء» هذه الكتابات تدل على أن منطقة الخرطوم كانت منطقة حضارة مزدهرة إبان العصر المسيحي في السودان، وقبل تخريبها من قبل جحافل الفونج حتى أصبح «خراب سوبا» مضرب أمثال شعبية في السودان.\nولا يعرف الكثير عن الخرطوم في عصر الفونج الذين أسسوا مُلكهم في السودان بتحالف مع قبائل العبدلاب واقاموا عاصمتهم في سنار، سوى استمرار مدارسها وخلاويها القرآنية في تدريس علوم الدين وأبرزها مدرسة اسلانج القرآنية بجزيرة إسلانج الواقعة في شمال مدينة الخرطوم وقد تأسس بها أول مسجد هو مسجد حمد النجيض الجموعي في عهد عجيب المانجلك واشتهرت بتعليم القرآن وتوافد اتباع الطريقة القادرية إحدى الطرق الصوفية الرئيسية في السودان.\n\nالعهد العثماني (1821- 1885)\nيبدأ التاريخ الحديث لمدينة الخرطوم مع مجيء الجيش العثماني لإيالة مصر إلى السودان بقيادة إسماعيل كامل باشا ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، والذي حط رحاله عليها وهو في طريقه إلى سنار عاصمة السلطنة الزرقاء التي كانت تحكم تلك المناطق في عام 1821م، وأقام فيها معسكراً لجنوده على بعد ميل واحد (1,6 كيلومتر) من ضفة النهر وفي منطقة السكة الحديدية الحالية، ولكنه اختار أولاً مدينة ود مدني الواقعة بين سنار والخرطوم عاصمة جديدة للبلاد. ولم يطب المقام للأتراك في مدينة ود مدني بسبب مناخها الجاف، ولذلك عندما جاء الأميرالاي عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي، الذي عُيّن حاكماً على السودان (1823 - 1825) م ومر على ملتقى النيلين (الأزرق والأبيض) وهو في طريقه إلى العاصمة ود مدني أُعجِب بالمكان وبقي في معسكر الخرطوم ثم أمر ببناء الثكنات والقلاع فيه. فقرر إبراهيم باشا، ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، الانتقال إلى الخرطوم القديمة واتخاذها عاصمة للسودان.\nبدأ الأتراك في بناء المدينة على طراز معماري جديد فشيدت المباني من الطوب الآجر وأُقيمت مباني الإدارات. وشهدت المدينة توسعاً في عهد خورشيد باشا حكمدار السودان في سنة 1826 م، وفي عام 1850 أمر الخديوي عباس بإنشاء مدرسة الخرطوم بينما قام الحكمدار عبد اللطيف 1849 - 1851 م بتأسيس حي «الحكمدارية» ليكون مجمعاً لمباني الإدارة العثمانية ومساكن للقادة. وفي عهد الحكمدار إسماعيل أيوب 1873 - 1877 م وُضِعت لبنات الصناعة في الخرطوم عندما تم تشييد معمل لصناعة الورق وآخر للبارود. وفي فترة الجنرال غوردون باشا حاكم عام السودان الإنجليزي المصري تم بناء «بوابة المسلمية» وكانت تقع في مكان كوبري (جسر) المسلمية الحالي، جنوب مستشفى الخرطوم، فوق خط السكة الحديدية، و«بوابة الكلاكلة» وكان موقعها مكان كوبري الحرية الحالي، الذي تم تشييده إبّان عهد الرئيس إبراهيم عبود في مطلع ستينات القرن الماضي.\nوورد في كتاب تاريخ الخرطوم للمؤرخ السوداني محمد إبراهيم أبو سليم بأن أهم احياء الخرطوم في العهد العثماني شملت حي الحكمدارية، حيث مركز الحكم، وحي المسجد، والأحياء الشعبية في أطراف المدينة التي كان يسكنها عامة الناس، ومنها حي سلامة الباشا، وحي هبوب ضرباني، وحي الكارة، وحي الترس، الذي أخذ اسمه من الحواجز الترابية التي أقيمت جنوبه لحماية المدينة من فيضان نهر النيل الأبيض، وحي بري المحس (وهو الحي الوحيد الذي لا يزال محافظاً على اسمه ولكنه تم تغيير مكانه إلى موقع آخر ليفسح المجال لبناء ثكنات الجيش البريطاني في فترة لاحقة (1900) والتي تحولت بعد الاستقلال (1956) إلى مباني داخليات لطلاب جامعة الخرطوم.\n\nعهد الدولة المهدية (1885- 1898)\nعاشت الخرطوم فترة تاريخية عصيبة منذ بداية الثورة المهدية باعتبارها مقر حكم الغزاة. وكان من المتوقع أن تزحف إليها قوات المهدي المناوئة للحكم العثماني في السودان ووكيله خديوي مصر، في أي وقت بعد أن حققت انتصارات باهرة على القوات العثمانية في مختلف مدن السودان، آخرها كان الانتصار الكبير على الجنرال الإنجليزي وليام هكس باشا في سنة 1883 م في واقعة شيكان القريبة من مدينة الأبيض على بعد 588 كيلومتر (365 ميل)، حيث طلب المهدي من أحد انصاره في منطقة الخرطوم وهو الشيخ محمد الطيب البصير بمحاصرة المدينة، وأرسل إليه قوات مساندة بقيادة الأمير محمد عثمان أبو قرجة، وبوصول مدد آخر من القوات يقوده الأمير عبد الرحمن النجومي، تمكن الأنصار من إحكام حصارهم للخرطوم، وضاقت الحلقة حولها بوصول المهدي نفسه والذي عسكر بجيشه في منطقة أبو سعد بأم درمان سنة 1884 م، قبل أن يدخلها منتصراً في 26 يناير / كانون الثاني 1885 م. وتقول المصادر البريطانية، بأن الخرطوم تعرضت لدمار كبير من قبل قوات الدراويش الفاتحة والتي تمكنت من دك حصون الأتراك ووقع غوردون باشا صريعاً في قصره المطل على النيل الأزرق، إلا أن مصادر المهدية تؤكد بإن خليفة المهدي عبد الله التعايشي أمر بعدم تخريب الخرطوم وعدم نقل مواد البناء منها إلى أم درمان، وأن المهدي قد غضب شديداً عندما علم بمقتل غوردون على يد قواته لأنه كان يريد القبض عليه حيّاً وأسره.\nأقام كبار أنصار المهدي من أمراء وقادة في قصور الدولة وبيوت الأعيان في حي المسجد بينما أقام المهدي في قصر يسمى «قصر الجاركوك» وكان قريباً من المسجد، وسكن الخليفة عبد الله التعايشي في سراي الحكمدار، أما أهالي الخرطوم فقد تم جمعهم في الطرف الجنوبي من المدينة، ولم تستمر إقامة قادة المهدية طويلاً في الخرطوم حيث انتقلوا إلى أم درمان التي اتخذوها مقراً جديدا للحكم في السودان في مايو / أيار من عام 1885 م.\n\nالحكم الثنائي (1898- 1956)\nفقدت الخرطوم مركزها كعاصمة للبلاد في عهد المهدية بعد أن اختار المهدي مدينة أم درمان الواقعة على الضفة الأخرى من نهر النيل عاصمة للدولة، فأقيمت بها منشآت ودوواين الحكم من بيت مال وثكنات للجيش وسور لحمايتها وغير ذلك. وفي تلك الفترة عانت الخرطوم من الإهمال الحكومي، وانتقلت التجارة والصناعة التقليدية إلى العاصمة الجديدة، إلا أن هزيمة الدروايش في معركة كرري في ديسمبر / كانون الأول عام 1898م، وخروج الخليفة عبد الله التعايشي من أم درمان أعاد الروح مجدداً إلى الخرطوم حيث قامت القوات البريطانية المصرية بقيادة اللورد كيتشنر بإعادة بناء المدينة باعتبارها العاصمة الرسمية للحكم الثنائي عام 1899 م، وقُدِمت عدة تصاميم هندسية لبناء الخرطوم الجديدة «الأنجلو-مصرية».\nوشهدت الخرطوم فترة استقرار سياسي واجتماعي حتى وقعت حادثة اغتيال السير سير لي إستاك حاكم عام السودان في القاهرة حيث قررت إنجلترا طرد الجيش المصري من السودان في ظرف أربعة وعشرين ساعة وإجلاء الموظفين المدنيين المصريين وذلك كرد فعل انتقامي على حادثة الاغتيال لتنفرد إنجلترا بحكم السودان مما أثار رد فعل عنيف وسط السودانيين الذين خرجوا في مظاهرات بقيادة جمعية اللواء الأبيض التي كان يرأسها الضابط السوداني علي عبد اللطيف والذي ألقي عليه القبض وأدُخل السجن، وأدى ذلك بدوره إلى تأجيج حالة الاستياء وسط سكان الخرطوم. وفي 27 نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني 1924 م تمردت وحدة عسكرية تابعة لقوة دفاع السودان الخاضعة للحكومة الاستعمارية. وكان يقود الوحدة الضابط السوداني عبد الفضيل الماظ. تحركت الوحدة من الخرطوم في اتجاه مدينة الخرطوم بحري الواقعة على الضفة الشمالية لنهر النيل الأزرق واعترضتها قوة إنجليزية في موقع قريب من جسر النيل الأزرق الذي يربط بين المدينتين واندلعت معركة سقط فيها العشرات من الجانبين وأحدثت موجة من الهلع وسط السكان الذين فرت أعداد منهم إلى الأحراش المحيطة بالمدينة وتمكنت القوة الإنجليزية من القضاء على تمرد الجنود والضباط السودانيين وذلك بمحاصرة الضابط عبد الفضيل الماظ في مستشفى الخرطوم وقصفه بالمدافع الثقيلة. وعرفت تلك الأحداث في السودان بثورة 1924.\nوفي أثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية إبّان حملة شرق إفريقيا، دخلت الخرطوم في أتون الصراع بين مجموعة دول الحلفاء في الحرب العالمية الثانية ومجموعة ما يسمى بدول المحور ممثلة بإيطاليا التي كانت تحتل الحبشة وإريتريا والصومال الإيطالي. وفي 23 أغسطس / آب 1940 م، أغارت طائرة حربية إيطالية على الخرطوم تلتها غارة جوية أخرى في اليوم التالي على أم درمان أدت إلى مصرع 3 أشخاص وفي 10 سبتمبر / أيلول من العام ذاته ألقت طائرة حربية إيطالية بقنابلها على مشارف الخرطوم.\nبانتصار الحلفاء طلب السودانيون من إنجلترا الوفاء بوعدها لهم بمنح السودان حق تقرير المصير وبدأت حكومتا الحكم الثنائي في مناقشة هذه المطالب مع الأحزاب السودانية وبعد استيلاء الضباط الأحرار على السلطة في مصر واختيار اللواء محمد نجيب رئيساً مجلس قيادة الثورة المصرية، جاء محمد نجيب إلى الخرطوم - وهو من مواليدها - لافتتاح البرلمان السوداني الجديد الذي سيتولى مهمة الاقتراع على استقلال السودان أو وحدته مع مصر. وشهدت الخرطوم إبّان زيارته أحداثاً دامية في مطار الخرطوم الدولي عندما اصطدمت أعداد كبيرة من المؤيدين للاستقلال التام للسودان وسقط عدد من القتلى والجرحى وعُرفت تلك الحوادث بحوادث مارس 1954.\nوفي يوم الأحد أول يناير / كانون الثاني شهدت الخرطوم احتفالات حاشدة حيث تم رفع علم الاستقلال على سارية سرايا الحاكم العام التي تغيّر اسمها إلى القصر الجمهوري.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nفي الفترة التي تلت استقلال السودان في عام 1956م شهدت الخرطوم عدة أحداث وفعاليات سياسية وطنية وإقليمية ودولية، فإلى جانب قيامها بدور العاصمة السياسية للسودان ومقراً للحكم فقد استضافت عدداً من المنظمات الإقليمية التي تم إبرام اتفاقيات إنشائها في السودان وأصبحت مدينة الخرطوم مقراً لها. ففي فبراير / شباط 1957، تم تأسيس الاتحاد الأفريقي لكرة القدم في الخرطوم التي كانت أول مقر له قبل انتقال المقر إلى القاهرة وفي الخرطوم تم تنظيم أول بطولة لكأس الأمم الإفريقية. وفي فبراير / شباط 1969، تم إنشاء اتحاد إذاعات الدول العربية في الخرطوم وانعقدت في التاريخ نفسه أول جلسة لجمعيته العامة في الخرطوم. وفي 11 مارس / آذار 1970 تم إنشاء المنظمة العربية للتنمية الزراعية لتكون المدينة مقراً لها. وفي الشهر ذاته من عام 1975 بدأ المصرف العربي للتنمية الاقتصادية في إفريقيا أعماله انطلاقاً منها وفي أبريل / نيسان تم في الخرطوم الإعلان عن إنشاء منظمة الأحزاب السياسية الإفريقية.\nوفي نوفمبر / تشرين الأول 1976 م، تأسست في الخرطوم الهيئة العربية للاستثمار والإنماء الزراعي.\nكما شهدت الخرطوم انعقاد عدة مؤتمرات قمة عربية وإفريقية مهمة حيث انعقد فيها في عام 1967 م، مؤتمر القمة العربي الرابع المعروف باسم قمة اللاءات الثلاثة، وفي عام 2006 م، مؤتمر القمة العربية الثامنة عشرة كما انعقد فيها مؤتمران للقمة الإفريقية أحدهما في عام 1978 والآخر في عام 2006 إلى جانب انعقاد مؤتمرات أخرى على مستوى وزاري مثل مؤتمر وزراء دفاع وقادة دول شرق أفريقيا في عام 2012 م.\nفي عام 1973، كانت المدينة مسرحاً لأزمة رهائن عندما قامت مجموعة تابعة لمنظمة أيلول الأسود الفلسطينية باقتحام حفل استقبال كان يقيمه عميد السلك الدبلوماسي بالخرطوم سفير المملكة العربية السعودية لوداع مستشار بالسفارة الأمريكية واحتجاز عدد من المدعوين وتقدمت بمطالب لم تتم الاستجابة لها، ومن بينها إطلاق سراح أحد رفاقها من السجون الأردنية فقامت باغتيال السفير الأمريكي الجديد آنذاك ومستشار السفارة المحتفى به، والقائم بالأعمال البلجيكي، وأفرجت عن الرهائن الآخرين بمن فيهم السفير السعودي والسفير الأردني ثم استسلمت للسلطات السودانية التي قامت باعتقال أفرادها وسلمتهم لاحقاُ لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية.\nوفي سبعينيات وثمانينيات القرن الماضي استقبلت الخرطوم موجات متعاقبة من اللاجئين والنازحين والمهجرين، الوافدين من مناطق النزاعات المسلحة والجفاف في البلدان المجاورة مثل تشاد وإريتريا وإثيوبيا وأوغندا أفلح بعضهم في الاندماج في مجتمعها، في حين أقام البعض الآخر في أحياء بضواحي المدينة. وفي منتصف الثمانينيات استقرت حول الخرطوم أعداد كبيرة من السودانيين النازحين من مناطق الصراع في جنوب السودان ودار فور\nوفي يوم 14 أغسطس / آب 1994 م، تم في الخرطوم اعتقال الفنزويلي كارلوس الملقب بابن آوى والمطلوب من قبل السلطات الأمنية في عدد من الدول الغربية وتم نقله من الخرطوم إلى باريس.\nأقام أسامة بن لادن في حي الرياض بالخرطوم في الفترة من عام 1991 وحتى 1996 م، قبل أن يتم أبعاده منها. وفي أعقاب تفجيرات السفارة الأمريكية في كل من كمبالا ودار السلام في عام 1998 م، اتهمت الولايات المتحدة تنظيم القاعدة الذي كان يتزعمه بمسؤولية التفجيرات وقامت في 20 أغسطس / آب من العام نفسه بشن هجمات بصواريخ كروز على مصنع الشفاء للأدوية بمدينة الخرطوم بحري القريبة من الخرطوم مما أدى إلى توتر دبلوماسي بينها وبين السودان، وأصبحت أنقاض المصنع منطقة جذب سياحي.\nأحدثت الوفاة المفاجئة لرئيس الحركة الشعبية لتحرير السودان ونائب الرئيس السوداني آنذاك جون قرنق في حادثة طيران في جنوب السودان في يوليو / تموز 2005 م، أعمال شغب عنيفة في الخرطوم لمدة ثلاثة أيام، قبل أن تتمكن قوات الأمن من السيطرة على الوضع.\nفي 23 أكتوبر / تشرين الأول 2012 م تعرض مصنع اليرموك للذخيرة بمنطقة الشجرة بالخرطوم إلى تفجيرات أعلنت الحكومة السودانية بأنها كانت نتيجة غارة جوية إسرائيلية.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع الخرطوم في منتصف المساحة المأهولة في السودان تقريباً شمال شرق وسط البلاد بين خط العرض16 درجة شمالاَ وخط العرض 15 درجة جنوباَ وخطي الطول 21 درجة غرباً و 24 درجة شرقاَ، وتتمدد مساحتها البالغة 20736 كيلو متر (12884 ميل) مربع بين الضفة الغربية لنهر النيل الأزرق من الناحيتين الشرقية والشمالية والضفة الشرقية للنيل الأبيض من الغرب وسهل الجزيرة تجاه الجنوب وهي المنطقة القابلة لتمدد المدينة عمرانياً.\nوتتوسط الخرطوم ولايات كسلا والقضارف والنيل والجزيرة والنيل الأبيض وشمال كردفان. وهي أيضأ قريبة من ولايات النيل الأزرق والشمالية وسنار وجنوب كردفان وتفصلها عن ولايات دار فور الكبرى أرض صحراوية وشبه صحراوية جرداء فقط.\n\nالصورة الطوبوغرافية\nتقع الخرطوم على ارتفاع 382 متر (1,253,28 قدم) فوق سطح البحر فوق أرض سهلية مستوية السطح مع انحدار طفيف نحو مجرى نهر النيل تتخللها تلال ونتوءات صخرية وكثبان رملية متفرقة مما يعطي صورة لتضاريس منبسطة مع تموجات طفيفة، وتتخلل هذا المشهد الطبيعي أيضاً طبقات وأرصفة أودية نيلية وخيران أبرزها خور جانقي في منطقة العُشَرَة والصحافة من جهة الشرق، ويتميز الجانب الذي يقع غرب النيل الأبيض بأنه أكثر انحداراً من جهة النيل الأزرق شرقاً، ولهذا فإن الخيران التي تقع في الغرب تصب معظمها في النيل إبّان موسم الأمطار في حين نجد الخيران الواقعة في الشرق غير منتظمة الفيضان ومعظمها ليس سوى جروف واسعة تفشل في الوصول إلى النيل خاصة في الأماكن التي تغطيها مكونات رملية. ويشكل النيلين الأزرق والأبيض أهم ظاهرة طبيعية للخرطوم حيث يلتقيان عند نقطة المقرن.\nجيولوجياً، تقع الخرطوم في حوض الخرطوم الذي يشكل جزء من حوض النيل الأزرق ويتكون من الصخور المتحولة والصخور النارية التي تنتمي إلى حزام الموزمبيق وتظهر بوضوح في منطقة السبلوقة شمال الخرطوم. والخصائص الجيولوجية المهمة في الخرطوم هي: الحجر الرملي النوبي، والحجر الرملي المغطى بالجبس والتكتلات الصخرية الرسوبية. وتبين من دراسة بنية القشرة الأرضية لحوض الخرطوم باستخدام 3 محطات رصد دائمة للزلازل في نطاق 40 كيلومتر (24,8 ميل) من وسط الخرطوم، بأن حوض الخرطوم هو واحد من عدة أحواض متصدعة في السودان مرتبطة مع نظام الأخدود الإفريقي الوسيط وأن سمك القشرة الأرضية تحت حوض الخرطوم يتراوح ما بين 33 (20,5 ميل) و 37 (22,9 ميل) كيلومتر بمتوسط قدره 35 (21,7 ميل) كيلومتر.\n\nملتقى النيلين الأزرق والأبيض\nيتميز النيل الأبيض الذي يأتي إلى الخرطوم من جهة الجنوب بإتساع مجراه وبطء جريانه وقلة انحداره حيث يشبه البحيرة الراكدة خاصة موسم فيضان النيل الأزرق. وبسبب قلة سرعة تياره تقل عمليات النحت في ضفافه ويزداد الإرساب، وعلى نقيض ذلك يتسم النيل الأزرق الذي ينبع من الهضبة الإثيوبية شرقاً بسرعة التيار وشدة الانحدار وعمق المجري. ويلاحظ المرء بوضوح ارتفاع ضفافه في المنطقة القريبة من المقرن على شارع النيل في الخرطوم حيث تم بناء حائط على الضفاف اتقاء لفيضانه، في حين تنعدم هذه الإنشاءات في ضفاف النيل الأبيض كما يلاحظ سرعة جريانه وقوة تياره من خلال دفعه لمياه النيل الأبيض إلى الوراء قليلاً عند التقائهما في نقطة المقرن، فضلاً عن ملاحظة الفارق في لون مياه مجراهما حيث يسود مياه النيل الأزرق لون الطمي البني الداكن، بينما تجري المياه شبه صافية بين ضفاف النيل الأبيض مما يعطيها بياضاً عند النظر إليها من علو، مقابل زرقة النيل الأزرق.\n\nالجزر النيلية\nوتشكل أيضاً معالم سياحية طبيعية يزورها العديد من السياح ويقصدها سكان العاصمة المثلثة للاسترواح والتنزه وأثناء العطلات والإجازات وأهم هذه الجزر:\n\nجزيرة توتي\n\nجزيرة توتي تقع بين النيل الأزرق من الشرق والجنوب، قبالة أجمل مناطق الخرطوم (شارع النيل والمقرن) وينطلق منها النيل في رحلته نحو الشمال بعد التقاء رافديه الأزرق والأبيض من جهة الغرب. تحتضن الجزيرة قرية صغيرة مساحتها 8 كيلو متر مربع (3 أميال مربعة). يعود تاريخ تأسيسها إلى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، وتتميز بشواطئها الرملية وبساتينها التي تنتج الفاكهة والخضر ومن بينها الليمون والبرتقال والجرجير. وتم ربطها بالخرطوم بجسر معلق طوله 310 متر. تستقبل القرية الزوار من العاصمة المثلثة والسياح لقضاء أوقات استجمام وترويح فيها، خاصة في أيام العطلات. وهناك محاولات لبناء منتجع سياحي كبير فيها.\n\nجزيرة التمساح\nتقع في وسط النيل الأزرق بالقرب من قرية أم دوم جنوب الخرطوم وعرفت بهذا الاسم نسبة لشكلها الذي يشبه شكل التمساح.\n\nجزيرة البط\nتوجد فيها أعداد كبيرة من الطيور المائية المستوطنة والمهاجرة.\n\nالغابات\nغابة السنط\nتقع في غرب الخرطوم بالقرب من مجرى نهر النيل الأبيض وتم إعلانها هي محمية طبيعية في عام 1939 م وتتكون معظم أشجارها من السنط الذي يقاوم مياه فيضانات النهر خلال فصل الخريف، وتأوي الغابة أنواع عديدة من الطيور المستوطنة والمهاجرة مثل الأوز وطير البقر وخطاف البحر وأبو منجل والبط والنورس النهري ومالك الحزين.\n\nالحزام الأخضر\nوهو نطاق من الأشجار من الأشجار الفارعة الارتفاع كأشجار البان التي تم استزراعها في الأطراف الجنوبية بغرض حماية المدينة من الزحف الصحراوي والحد من هبوب الرياح القوية نحو المدينة من الجهة التي لا يجري فيها أحد فرعي النيل، إلا أن التوسع العمراني في العقود الأخيرة قد تجاوز حدود هذا النطاق.\n\nالمناخ\nدرجات الحرارة\nتعتبر الخرطوم واحدة من المدن الرئيسية الأكثر حرارة في العالم. فقد تتجاوز درجات الحرارة فيها 48 درجة مئوية (118.4 درجة فهرنهايت) في منتصف الصيف، إلا أن المتوسط السنوي لدرجات الحرارة القصوى يبلغ حوالي 37.1 درجة مئوية (98.78 فهرنهايت)، مع ستة أشهر في السنة يزيد المتوسط الشهري لدرجة الحرارة فيها عن 38 درجة مئوية (100.4 فهرنهايت)، ولا يوجد في جدول حالة الطقس الخاص بالخرطوم معدلاً لدرجة الحرارة الشهرية يقل عن 30 درجة مئوية (86.5 فهرنهايت)، وهو ما تتم ملاحظته في جداول خاصة بمدن رئيسية أخرى ذات مناخ صحراوي حار مماثل كالرياض، أو بغداد أو فينيكس بولاية أريزونا. وفي كل الأحوال فإن درجات الحرارة في الخرطوم تهبط بمعدلات كبيرة خلال الليل، إلى أدنى من 15 درجة مئوية (59 فهرنهايت) في شهر يناير / كانون الثاني وقد تصل إلى 6 درجات مئوية (42.8 درجة فهرنهايت) عند مرور جبهة هوائية باردة.\n\nالأمطار\nيسود الخرطوم في معظم أشهر السنة المناخ الصحراوي الحار الجاف باستثناء شهري يوليو / تموز وأغسطس / آب، حيث تسقط الأمطار المدارية الشديدة، بمعدل يزيد قليلاً على 155 مليمتر (6.1 بوصة) سنوياً في المتوسط، وفي الفترة من ديسمبر / كانون الأول وحتى فبراير / شباط حيث تنخفض درجة الحرارة نسبياُ.\nوفي الشتاء وهي الفترة من ديسمبر / كانون الأول وحتى فبراير / شباط يكون الجو لطيفاً إلى حد ما، حيث تنخفض درجات الحرارة في الصباح وحتى الظهيرة وبعد غروب الشمس. وتتراوح درجة الحرارة خلال هذه الفترة ما بين 32 درجة مئوية (89.6 درجة فهرنهايت) 28 درجة مئوية (82.4 فهرنهايت).\n\nحركة الرياح\nثمة ظاهرة مناخية في السودان تعرف بالهبوب وهو عاصفة ترابية نشطة تحدث في مناطق وسط السودان بما فيها الخرطوم وذلك عندما تهب رياح جنوبية رطبة في شهري مايو / أيار ويوليو / تموز ويمكن أن تقلل بشكل مؤقت مدى الرؤية إلى الصفر.\nأنسب وقت لزيارة الخرطوم من حيث المناخ هي الفترة ما بين شهري نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني ومارس / آذار.\n\nالإدارة\nالخرطوم هي محلية من محليات ولاية الخرطوم التي تضم أيضاً الخرطوم بحري وأم درمان وشرق النيل ومحليات أُخرى.\nكانت تتكون محلية الخرطوم من ثلاث وحدات إدارية هي:\n\nوحدة الخرطوم وتضم أحياء ومناطق:\n\nُ\nالخرطوم شمال، البراري، امتداد ناصر، الخرطوم وسط، الديوم الشرقية، الديوم الغربية، الشجرة الجنوبية، الشجرة الشمالية، العمارات، الخرطوم1، الخرطوم 2، الخرطوم3، الخرطوم غرب، المنطقة الصناعية، الخرطوم السوق الشعبي، الكلاكلات.\n\nوحدة الشهدا وتشمل أحياء ومناطق:\nالصحافة وجبرة، الإمتداد، العشرة، السوق المحلي، السوق المركزي، الدوحة، وسوبا الشاحنات.\n\nوحدة الخرطوم شرق وتتبع لها:\nأركويت شرق، أركويت غرب، الطائف، المنشية، الجريف غرب، المطار، جاردن سيتي، الرياض.\nحالياً، تحتوي خارطة المحلية الإدارية على ست وحدات إدارية تشمل:-\n\nوحدة الخرطوم شمال الإدارية\nوحدة الخرطوم شرق الإدارية\nوحدة الخرطوم غرب الإدارية\nوحدة الخرطوم وسط الإدارية\nوحدة الشهداء وسوبا الإدارية\nوحدة الشجرة الإدارية\nوتتولى هذه الوحدات الإدارية مهمة تقديم الخدمات العامة للمواطنين على نحو أشبه بما تقوم به البلديات والجماعات الحضرية في عواصم أخرى، ويشرف على إدارة المحلية رئيس يسمى المعتمد، إلا أن والي الولاية يمثل أعلى سلطة إدارية في الخرطوم.\n\nالسياحة\nتعتبر الخرطوم إحدى المراكز السياحية المهمة في السودان، ليس فقط باعتبارها عاصمة البلاد وواحدة من أكبر مدنها، بل لوجود عدد من المقومات السياحية مثل المتاحف والآثار والحدائق والفضاءات الخضراء إلى جانب الأندية الرياضية والمهرجانات وغيرها من الفعاليات.\n\nالمتاحف\nهناك عدة متاحف في الخرطوم أهمها هي:\n\nالمتحف القومي المُطل على نهر النيل الأزرق وفي منطقة المقرن ويحتوي على مقتنيات أثرية من مختلف أنحاء السودان، يمتد تاريخها إلى عصور ما قبل التاريخ، وحتى فترة الممالك النوبية وتشتمل الصالات الداخلية للمتحف على العديد من المقتنيات المعروضة في شكل منحوتات وآنية فخارية وزجاجية وخشبية ومعدنية، وأدوات زينة وصور حائطية في حين يشتمل فناء المتحف على عدد من المعابد والمدافن والنصب التذكارية، والتماثيل القديمة بأحجام مختلفة، التي نقلت من مناطق استكشافها في شمال السودان، وأهمها معابد (سمنة شرق) و (سمنة غرب) وبوهين، ومقبرة الأمير (حجو تو حتب) وأعمدة كاتدرائية فرس. كما يضم المتحف مقتنيات أثرية يرجع تاريخها إلى العصر الحجري القديم وحتى نهاية فترة سلطنة سنار في عام 1821 م.\nمتحف التاريخ الطبيعي، يقع في شارع الجامعة ويحتوى على حيوانات محنطة وأخرى حيّة بهدف التعريف بما هو متوافر في السودان من زواحف وطيور ومواشي وحشرات تعريفاً علمياً، وتلعب جامعة الخرطوم دوراً مهماً في استمرارية هذا المتحف والحفاظ عليه، ومن الطيور الموجودة فيه صقر الجديان الذي يمثل شعار السودان.\nمتحف القصر، وتعرض فيه لوحات زيتية وصور فوتوغرافية لحكام السودان منذ الحكم الثنائي في عام 1889 م، وحتى فترة ما بعد الاستقلال وبعض السيارات الرئاسية التي كانوا يستخدمونها خلال فترة حكمهم وما تلقّاه الرؤساء الوطنيين من هدايا إضافة إلى الآلات الموسيقية وقطع الأواني والأثاث التي استخدمت في القصر الرئاسي. ويقع المتحف في مبنى كنيسة أثرية بيزنطية المعمار داخل جزء من الحديقة الجنوبية الشرقية للقصر.\nمتحف الإثنوغرافيا في ملتقى شارع الجامعة بشارع المك نمر وتعرض فيه نماذج من الأدوية التقليدية المستعملة في الحياة اليومية بالسودان ونماذج من أسلحة الصيد وأدوات الزراعة والإنتاج لدى القبائل المختلفة بالسودان إلى جانب نماذج من أزيائهم وآلاتهم لموسيقية، ومركز الفولكلور التابع للهيئة القومية للآداب والفنون.\nالمتحف الحربي (العسكري)، بوزارة الدفاع وفيه مجموعة من نماذج الأسلحة الأثرية المختلفة والأزياء العسكرية والدروع والصور والخرائط العسكرية التاريخية.\n\nالمعالم الأثرية\nالقباب العثمانية التي تقع شرق ساحة أبو جنزير في وسط الخرطوم ويرجع تاريخها إلى بدايات العهد العثماني بالسودان في سنة 1839 م، وتضم مقابر لمشاهير القادة والعسكريين الاتراك في السودان ومن بينهم مؤسس الخرطوم الحكمدار عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي.\nموقع سوبا شرق النيل الأثري جنوب الخرطوم بحرى، الذي يضم آثار عاصمة مملكة علوة المسيحية من القرن السادس إلى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، ومن بينها بقايا كنيسة قديمة.\nالمباني الأثرية ومنها القصر الجمهوري ومبنى البريد المركزي ومعمل إستاك وغيرها تضاف إلى ذلك المعالم السياحية في كل من أم درمان والخرطوم بحري على الضفاف الأخرى لنهري النيل (الأزرق والأبيض) والتي يمكن الوصول إليها من الخرطوم بسهولة.\n\nالحدائق النباتية والحيوانية\nتوجد في الخرطوم حديقة نباتية تبلغ مسلحتها 11 فدان وتحتوى على أنواع عديدة ونادرة من النباتات، كما توجد حديقة للحيوانات في غابة السنط ويجري العمل على إنشاء حديقة سفاري.\n\nالسياحة النهرية\nتشتهر الخرطوم أيضاً بالسياحة النهرية على نهر النيل حيث توجد البواخر النيلية وقوارب الفلوكة والزوارق والقوارب الشراعية والعبّارات والتي تمخر مياه النيلين الأزرق والأبيض وتعبر بركابها إلى جزيرة توتي وسط النيل حيث البساتين التقليدية النضرة. وتوجد المراكب بالقرب من المقرن وجزيرة توتي وجزيرة التمساح، وتقوم برحلات نهارية وليلية.\n\nرحلات السفاري\nيتميز السودان بتباين نطاقه المناخي والبيئي وهو ما يتّضح جلياً في وجود أنواع كثيرة من الحيوانات والطيور وتقوم شركات ومكاتب السفاري والرحلات البرية في الخرطوم بتنظيم رحلات مرخصة للصيد ذهاباً وإياباً منها رحلات سفاري الغزلان، وسفاري صيد البط، والحمام البري الذي يمتد موسم صيده من نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني وحتى فبراير / شباط من العام.\n\nالمناطق الطبيعية\nشلال السبلوقة\nيقع شلال السبلوقة على بعد 80 كيلو متر من الخرطوم ويتبع إدارياً لولاية نهر النيل وهو عبارة عن كتل صخرية في وسط مجرى نهر النيل تعترض تدفق المياه، ويعرف أيضاً باسم الشلال السادس أو الجندل السادس باعتباره سادس وآخر العقبات الصخرية وسط مجرى نهر النيل ويشكل مقصداً للسياح خاصة السياح العرب والأجانب وذلك لطبيعة المنطقة التي تجمع بين التلال والمياه والجزر والكثبان الصحراوية والحياة البرية وتقام فيها رحلات نيلية.\n\nمقرن النيلين\nالمقرن في الخرطوم هو نقطة تلاقي رافدي نهر النيل وهما النيل الأزرق القادم من الهضبة الإثيوبية والنيل الأبيض القادم من وسط أفريقيا في مشهد طبيعي يشد الانتباه، حيث يلاحظ المرء كيف تسير مياه النيل الأزرق الطينية الداكنة ومياه النيل الأبيض الصافية جنباً إلى جنب، ثم يختلطان مع بعضهما ويصبحان نهراً واحداً في مجرى واسع ذو مياه خفيفة الزرقة. وتوجد في المنطقة عدة منتزهات ومتاحف وفنادق وجسر يربط المنطقة بأم درمان.\n\nمنطقة جبل أولياء في الجنوب الغربي من الخرطوم، حيث السد القديم والبحيرة التي خلفه ويشكلان بيئة نهرية زاخرة بالأسماك والطيور والنباتات.\n\nالخدمات العامة\nالتعليم\nتعتبر الخرطوم قطباً مهماً للتعليم العالي في السودان، حيث تتركز فيها الجامعات والمعاهد العليا.وقد شهدت إنشاء أول مدرسة نظامية للسودان وأول كلية جامعية هي كلية غوردون التذكارية التي تحول فيما بعد إلى جامعة. كما يوجد بها العديد من المدارس بما في ذلك مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية المقيمة فيها. وتستضيف الخرطوم المعهد الدولي لتعليم اللغة العربية لغير الناطقين بها، الذي تم تأسيسه بالتعاون مع المنظمة العربية للتربية والثقافة والعلوم.\nعرفت الخرطوم التعليم منذ إنشائها على يد فقهاء مدارس خلاويها فقد تزامن تاريخ تأسيسها مع قيام المدارس القرآنية فيها والتي انحصر دورها على التعاليم المرتبطة بالعقيدة من تحفيظ سور القرآن وتفسيرها ومبادئ الفقه وقواعد اللغة العربية وأساسيات الحساب. وفي العهد العثماني تم افتتاح عدة مدارس نظامية حديثة في السودان من بينها مدرسة الخرطوم الابتدائية التي افتتحت سنة 1855 م، لتعليم أبناء الموظفين الأتراك تحت اشراف العالم رفاعة رافع الطهطاوي الذي نفي إلى السودان آنذاك، ومنذ ذلك الحين انتشرت المدارس في المدينة على اختلاف مراحلها ومناهج التدريس فيها. ويمكن تقسيم المدارس في الخرطوم إلى مدارس عامة حكومية أصبح لبعضها شهرة على نطاق السودان وأخرى خاصة يديرها القطاع الخاص وتشمل هذه الفئة مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية والتي ساهم بعضها بقدر كبير في مجال التعليم بالمدينة مثل مدارس البعثة المصرية وأكبرها مدرسة جمال عبد الناصر الثانوية ومدارس الكلية القبطية ومدارس كمبوني ومدرسة الراهبات والمدارس العالمية. وازداد عدد هذه المدارس في نهاية القرن الماضي ليشمل مدارس تدرس بلغات غير اللغتين العربية والإنجليزية السائدتين في المجال التعليمي في الخرطوم ومن بينها المدرسة الأرمنية والمدرسة التركية. ومن مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية: المدرسة البريطانية ومدرسة الاتحاد والمدرسة الأمريكية ومدرسة كامبريدج العالمية ومدرسة البارون والمدارس العالمية\nبلغ عدد المؤسسات التعليمية في ولاية الخرطوم في عام 2011م، حوالي 3000 منها 1600 مدرسة في مرحلة الأساس و450 في المرحلة الثانوية بالإضافة إلى المدارس الخاصة ومؤسسات التعليم قبل المدرسي ومراكز تعليم الكبار.\nجدول بالجامعات والمعاهد العليا الكبيرة الموجودة في الخرطوم:\n\nانظر أيضا\n\nقائمة الجامعات في السودان\n\nالرعاية الصحية\nتوجد في الخرطوم عدة مؤسسات صحية وطبية بما في ذلك المستشفيات والمستوصفات الطبية وعيادات الأطباء الخاصة والأخصائيين إلى جانب مكاتب مؤسسات التأمينات الصحية. ومن تلك المستشفيات، مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى الشعب ومستشفى العيون ومستشفى الذرة ومستشفى الأسنان وكلها تقع بوسط الخرطوم، إلى جانب مجموعة كبيرة من المستشفيات الخاصة منها مستشفى ابن سينا ومستشفى ابن خلدون والمستشفى السعودي والمستشفى التركي وغيرها. وتنتشر الصيدليات في المدينة ومجمعاتها العلاجية.\nوتتقاسم إدارة النظام الصحي في الخرطوم جهتان، هما الحكومة المركزية ووزارة الصحة الإقليمية. وتشرف الحكومة المركزية على حوالي 18 مستشفى في ولاية الخرطوم معظمها مستشفيات كبيرة وعامة منها مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى ابن سينا، بينما تشرف وزارة الصحة الإقليمية على المراكز الصحية وحوالي 30 مستشفى صغير في مدن العاصمة المثلثة وضواحيها. ونظراً للتنافس الكبير بين هذه المستشفيات والمؤسسات الصحية وعدم تكاملها فإن الكثير من الموارد يتم إهدارها حيث تحصل المستشفيات الكبيرة على دعم حكومي مما يجعلها تستقطب العدد الكبير من المرضى الأمر الذي يشكل حالة من التكدس إضافة إلى مشاكل التنقل على نحو يستدعي الإصلاح خاصة بعد التدهور الكبير في القطاع الصحي. وأول تحد يواجه الإصلاح هو التوسع في الخدمات ونقلها إلى خارج مركز العاصمة. وإلى جانب ذلك تشرف وزارة الصحة الإقليمية على نظام التأمين الصحي بقسط قدره 25 جنيه سوداني (4 دولارات) شهرياً لجميع افراد العائلة الواحدة بينما يدفع العمال حوالي 60% من صندوق التأمين الصحي وتغطي الحكومة النسبة المتبقية. وتتولى صناديق الزكاة والأعمال الخيرية دفع اقساط مقدرة من تأمينات الأسر.\nأكبر مستشفى في الخرطوم هو مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي الواقع على شارع الطابية بوسط الخرطوم وتبلغ عدد الأسرة فيه 750 سرير (عام 2013) وأصغرها هو المستشفى السويدي في حي الجريف غرب الواقع شرق المدينة بالقرب من مطار الخرطوم الدولي وعدد الأسرة فيه 30 سريراً. وهناك مستشفى الذرة بشارع القصر وبه حوالي 141 سرير ومستشفى ابن سينا بشارع اللواء محمد نجيب ويسع لحوالي 147 سرير.\nأما عدد المستوصفات والمراكز الصحية الأخرى فيبلغ حوالي 91 مستوصف و7 وحدات صحية خاصة و11 مركز صحي. ويوجد في الخرطوم القومسيون الطبي وهو هيئة طبية إدارية تقوم بمهمة استخراج شهادات التطعيم الدولية وتحديد القياة الصحية للأفراد لأغراض التعيين في وظائف معينة ومواقع بيع الأطعمة وغيرها من المهام ذات الصلة.\n\nالفندقة والمطاعم\nالفنادق\n\nتنتشر في مختلف أرجاء الخرطوم العديد من الفنادق على مختلف الدرجات ويتركز بعضها على ضفاف النيل بشارع النيل.\nومن تلك الفنادق فندق كورينثيا- برج الفاتح سابقاً وفندق كورال (الهيلتون سابقا) وفندق قصر الصداقة وفندق السلام روتانا وفندق جراند هوليداي وفندق مريديان (ريجينسى حاليا)وفندق شهرزاد وفنادق الأكروبول وصحارى وقباء وبلازا والبحرين وسنترال وكانون والحجاز ومشيريب والتاكا هاوس والفيصل سفاري بالاس والسواحلي والآراك وبحر الغزال وبيت الضيافة الألماني وفندق إفريقيا وفندق الرياض الجديد وغيرها.\n\nالمطاعم\n\nتوجد في الخرطوم عدة مطاعم تقدم مختلف الأطباق السودانية والأجنبية فهناك مطاعم تقدم أطباق لبنانية كما في مطعم البستان على شارع أفريقيا وأطباق باكستانية كما في مطعم سولت-إن-بيبر (ملح وفلفل) ومطعم الحبشة للطعام الإثيوبي في منطقة أركويت، والأطباق اليمنية في مطعم حضرموت في سوق الخرطوم 2، والصينية في مول (مجمع) عفراء والكورية في شارع إفريقيا والشاورما والكباب في شارع المطار، واللحوم في كانيفوري ويمكن تذوق الأطعمة السودانية التقليدية في المطعم الشعبي 15. معظم المطاعم تتركز في مناطق العمارات والخرطوم 2 والرياض. وبعض المطاعم مزود بشاشات عرض وموسيقى حية وإنترنت. ويزخر شارع أفريقيا وشارع النيل بالعديد من المطاعم والمقاهي.\n\nالأسواق والسوبرماركات\nتوجد بوسط الخرطوم سوقان رئيسيتان هما السوق العربي والسوق الأفرنجي. وكلاهما قريبان من بعضهما من حيث المسافة ولكنهما تختلفان من حيث السلع المعروضة. فالأولى سوق تقليدية تعرض فيها السلع والمنتوجات المحلية المختلفة من الحبوب والتوابل، إلى أدوات الزينة والذهب ومواد البناء والتشييد.والثانية تضم محلات تجارية تبيع السلع المستوردة من أقمشة وقطع اثاث وتحف وما شابه ذلك. وهناك أيضاً اسواقاً مركزية للخضر واللحوم، إلى جانب السوق الشعبي.\nتوجد في الخرطوم عدة سوبر ماركات محلية منتشرة في الأحياء الراقية، منها مول عفراء التجاري الذي تم تأسيسه في عام 4 م، بمنطقة أركويت وتتنوع الخدمات فيه من محلات تجارية ومطاعم وأماكن ترفيه إلى موقف للسيارات. وهناك مول مركز العمارات والواحة مول الذي يتكون من أربعة ابراج وبه منطقة خضراء ومحلات تجارية ومكاتب للشركات والافراد، ومركز واحة الخرطوم وهو واحد من المراكز التجارية الحديثة في الخرطوم.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nساعد موقع الخرطوم في وسط البلاد تقريباً على تسهيل ربطها بكافة عواصم ومدن ولايات السودان المختلفة، براً عبر الطرق الممهدة والطرق الموسمية وجواً عبر الطيران الداخلي وبالبواخر النيلية عبر نهر النيل وبقطارات السكك الحديدية. أما داخل المدينة فتتنوع وسائل النقل من سيارة الأجرة الصفراء اللون وحافلات المدينة وغيرها من الحافلات الأخرى على مختلف الأحجام وتسمى بالباصات، كما تستخدم الدراجات النارية ثلاثية العجلات المعروفة بالتوك توك وتعرف في الخرطوم باسم الرقشة، فضلاً عن القطارات والعبارات النيلية.\n\nالنقل الجوي\nيوجد في الخرطوم مطار واحد وهو مطار الخرطوم الدولي لخدمة الركاب داخل السودان وخارجه، ويعتبر أكبر مطار في السودان. ويقع وسط مدينة الخرطوم، رمزه في منظمة النقل الجوي الدولي (أياتا) هو KRT وفي المنظمة الدولية للطيران المدني (إيكاو) هو HSSS، ويبلغ طول مدرجه 2980 متر أي 9777 قدم ، وهو مرتبط بخطوط إلى معظم المطارات الدولية بالبلدان العربية ومن بينها خط جدة والقاهرة ودمشق وطرابلس ودبي، وعدد من المطارات بالدول الأوربية مثل مطارات أثينا ولندن وأمستردام واسطنبول والآسيوية مثل بكين والأفريقية كأسمرة وأديس أبابا ونيروبي وغيرها. ويرتبط المطار بخطوط داخلية تتجه نحو المطارات المنتشرة في ولايات السودان المختلفة مثل مطارات بورتسودان ونيالا والقضارف ودنقلا وكوستي.\nيجري العمل حالياً على إنشاء مطار دولي جديد، بعيداً عن مركز العاصمة وذلك لعدة أسباب أهمها وقوع المطار القديم في وسط المدينة مما يشكل خطورة على السكان وعائق أمام بناء المباني الشاهقة والمرتفعة في الخرطوم، فضلاً عن زيادة الطلب على الرحلات الدولية للخرطوم، مما يستدعي بناء مطار جديد يستوفي المعايير الدولية من حيث مدرجات الإقلاع والهبوط وصالات المسافرين وغيرها من المرافق الأخرى.\n\nالنقل النهري\nيوجد في الخرطوم ميناء نهري للنقل والسفر إلى المدن الواقعة على ضفاف النيل الأبيض جنوب الخرطوم حتى مدينة كوستي، كما يقدم خدمات سياحية تتمثل في الرحلات النيلية وخدمات القوارب الشراعية والزوارق في النيل. ويقع المقر الرئيسي للميناء في الخرطوم بحري. وهناك عبّارة (ويطلق عليها في السودان مَعدّية) نهرية تقوم برحلات منتظمة لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين الخرطوم وجزيرة توتي الواقعة في مجري نهر النيل.\n\nالطرق السريعة والجسور والأنفاق\n\nترتبط الخرطوم بمدن السودان المختلفة بشبكة من الطرق السريعة ومنها شارع الخرطوم - ود مدني والخرطوم - القضارف والخرطوم- بورتسودان والخرطوم -دنقلا وغيرها.\nأما في الداخل فهناك بعض الشوارع الرئيسية المشهورة من حيث طولها أو المنطقة التي تشقها ومنها شارع أفريقيا وشارع النيل أم درمان، وشارع القصر وهو أحد أطول شوارع الخرطوم وشارع عبيد ختم وشارع الجمهورية وشارع علي عبد اللطيف وشارع المك نمر. ويتم حالياً تنفيذ مشاريع لتوسعة شبكة الطرق الداخلية وتطويرها لتسهيل انسياب الحركة في المدينة مثل شارع النيل الخرطوم السريع والطريق الدائري.\n\nالخرطوم هي إحدى مدن العاصمة المثلثة ولذلك فهي ترتبط بأم درمان والخرطوم بحري بعدة جسور مقامة على النيلين:الأزرق والأبيض وهي:\n\nكوبري النيل الأبيض القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع أم درمان.\nكوبري الإنقاذ حيث يربط الخرطوم مع أم درمان.\nكوبري النيل الأزرق القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري بُري (القوات المسلحة)حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري توتي حيث يربط الخرطوم مع جزيرة توتي التي توجد في النيل الأزرق.\nكوبري المك نمر حيث يربط الخرطوم مع خرطوم بحري.\nكوبري المنشية حيث يربط الخرطوم مع شرق النيل.\nكوبري الدباسين حيث يربط بين الخرطوم وأمدرمان ويوجد علي النيل الأبيض (تحت الإنشاء).\nالسكك الحديدية\n\nتعتبر الخرطوم إحدى مراكز خطوط السكك الحديدية في السودان، حيث تتجه نحوها كافة الخطوط الممتدة من الولايات المختلفة شرقاً (من جهة كسلا - القضارف - ود مدني) وغرباً (من نيالا - الأبيض عبر تقاطع سنار في الوسط) وشمالاً (من وادي حلفا مروراً بأبو حمد وعطبرة) ومن كريمة في الشمال الغربي إلى الخرطوم، فضلاً عن ذلك تعمل قطارات السكك الحديدية على نقل الركاب داخل مدينة الخرطوم من مناطق الكلاكلة في أقصى جنوب المدينة إلى وسط الخرطوم. وتوجد محطة للقطارات في الخرطوم بحري. وكانت المدينة تعرف نظام الترامواي في ثلاثينيات القرن الماضي قبل أن تتم إزالة خطوطها بعد فترة الاستقلال في وجه التمدد العمراني وكثافة حركة المرور بوسط المدينة.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط العمراني\nتوالت عمليات تخطيط الخرطوم منذ تشكيل أول لجنة للتخطيط العمراني في عام 1927 م، وكان أبرزها تخطيط عام 1946 و1950 والذي شمل توسيع الطرق والشوارع وإنشاء الحدائق العامة والميادين ويناء امتدادات جديدة في الأحياء لاستيعاب موجات الهجرة السكانية نحو العاصمة. ونتيجة للنمو الديمغرافي والرغبة في تجميل العاصمة شهدت الخرطوم عملية تخطيط في عام 1958، خاصة في المنطقة القريبة من مقرن النيلين وبرز نمط معماري جديد مغاير للنمط الاستعماري، كما تكررت العملية التخطيطية في عام 1977 و1990 م في المنطقة نفسها.\nلا يوجد نمط معماري معين أو لون طلاء محدد تتميز به الخرطوم إذ توجد مختلف الأشكال والأنماط والألوان في المدينة، إلا أن من الممكن التمييز بين خطوط معمارية واضحة في طراز الأبنية من حيث تاريخ بنائها، ففي المنطقة الشمالية المطلة على النيل الأزرق يظهر النمط الكولونيالي الذي يعود إلى القرن التاسع عشر والعصر الفيكتوري وما قبله وفن العمارة المملوكية الإسلامية ويتمثل في مباني الوزارات والدواوين الحكومية القديمة التي بناها الأتراك ومن بينها سراي الحكمدار (القصر الجمهوري القديم) في المنطقة المحاذية للنيل الأزرق، ويلاحظ أن هذه المنطقة قد تم تخطيط شوارعها في عهد كتشنر على شكل العلم البريطاني (الصلبان المتقاطعة رأسياً وأفقياً وعرضياً) مستنداً في تخطيطه بشكل عام على مخطط وشنطن الأمريكي مع ادخال بعض العناصر العسكرية كبناء ثكنات الجنود (داخليات جامعة الخرطوم حالياً). (في عام 1908 م، تم تنفيذ مخطط ملكين وهو بمثابة تعديل لتخطيط كتشنر متأثر بتخطيط جاردن سيتي في القاهرة).\nويسود المنطقة التي تليها جنوباً معمار خمسينيات وستينيات القرن الماضي ومن أبرز أمثلته امتداد فندق السودان، وكلما ابتعدنا جنوباً من النيل أو اتجهنا نحو أطرافه الشمالية في منطقة المقرن نجد نماذج لأنماط العمارة المعاصرة مثل قصر المؤتمرات (المسمى بقاعة الصداقة) والذي بناه الصينيون في سبعينيات القرن الماضي وهو شبيه بمباني ميدان السلام الأبدي في بكين، والعمارة الحديثة ممثلة فندق كورينثيا، برج الفاتح سابقاً المبني على شكل بيضة نعام ضخمة ومبنى بنك السودان المركزي الجديد ذو الواجهة الزجاجية.\nتشمل العمارة الحديثة مباني الأبراج العالية مثل برج الاتصالات سوداتيل الذي يتكون من 29 طابقاً وبرج شركة بترودار وإدارة الخطوط الجوية السودانية وأبراج القوات المسلحة المصمم أحدها في شكل بارجة والآخر على شكل طائرة وهي من المباني التي تأحذ أشكالاً هندسية وفقاً لدور المؤسسة التي أنشأتها كمقر لها. وتتركز مباني الأبراج في وسط الخرطوم ومنطقتي المقرن وبري.\n\nالميادين والحدائق العامة\n\nأهتم مؤسسو مدينة الخرطوم بالخضرة في المدينة، فقاموا بتشجير شوارعها بأشجار ظليلة كأشجار اللبخ والنيم التي اقيمت على طول الضفة الشرقية للنيل الأزرق والتي تم جلبها من بلدان كالهند، كما شجعوا الأهالي على زراعة الأشجار وإقامة الحدائق في منازلهم وكانت تجرى وحتى سنوات قريبة مسابقات حول أجمل الحدائق المنزلية في منطقة الخرطوم عموم. وفي ستينيات القرن الماضي اقيمت حدائق في الأحياء البعيدة عن مركز المدينة مثل حديقة القرشي وفي سبعينيات القرن ذاته تم تخصيص مساحات واسعة مكسوة بالحشائش والشجيرات في المنطقة القريبة من المقرن. وفي السنوات الأخيرة تم نشر اشجار النخيل في عدد من شوارع المدينة وساحاتها الخضراء. وزاد الاهتمام بالحدائق العامة والبيئة الخضراء وذلك في ضوء تزايد نسبة انبعاث الكربون من السيارات والمصانع ومن هذه الحدائق الساحة الخضراء وهي عبارة عن فضاء متعدد الأغراض حيث توجد فيه ملاعب ومرافق رياضية متاحة للجمهور مضامير لرياضة المشي والعدو ومسرح ثقافي على الهواء الطلق وملاعب أطفال وأماكن ترويح وتحيط بها بضعة محلات تجارية صغيرة لبيع التحف وغيرها ومطاعم ومكتبة عامة.\nومن أبرز الحدائق العامة والمنتزهات الأخرى:\n\nوإلى جانب المنتزهات والحدائق العامة توجد بضعة بساتين توفر بعضها أماكن للرحلات الخلوية بعد الاتفاق مع أصحابها، ومنها بساتين الجريف غرب وبساتين جزيرة توتي.\nكما توجد في الخرطوم عدة ميادين وساحات عامة ومنها ميدان جمال عبد الناصر (المحطة الوسطى سابقاً) ميدان محطة السوق العربي وميدان أبو جنزير، وميدان الأمم المتحدة في وسط المدينة، وميدان المولد في الخرطوم جنوب.\nومع ذلك فأن الخرطوم في حاجة إلى مزيد من الساحات والميادين والمنتزهات والحدائق العامة الواسعة المساحة وإعادة تأهيل الأماكن الخضراء الحالية والعناية بها.\n\nالمساجد دور العبادة\n\nيدين أغلب سكان الخرطوم بالإسلام، ولذلك توجد بالمدينة أعداداً كبيرة من المساجد. وقد تسارعت وتيرة إنشاء المساجد في الخرطوم بالأحياء وبالمؤسسات وشرعت الطرق الصوفية والجماعات الدينية بإنشاء مساجد خاصة بها. وانتشرت في الآونة الأخيرة ظاهرة المساجد التي تقام في المؤسسات ومن بينها مسجد القوات المسلحة في مقر قيادة القوات المسلحة السودانية جوار قاعة الشهيد الزبير ومسجد القصر في ساحة القصر الجمهوري وغيرها من المساجد المنشرة بأحجام مختلفة في مقرات المؤسسات الحكومية وشركات القطاع الخاص والمؤسسات التعليمية والصحية. ومن المساجد الكبيرة والبارزة في وسط الخرطوم مسجد جامعة الخرطوم ومسجد الشهيد والجامع العتيق (مسجد الخرطوم الكبير) أو مسجد عباس سابقاً، الذي افتتحه الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا في 4 ديسمبر / كانون الأول 1901 م، عند زيارته للسودان. وتتنوع انماط الهندسة المعمارية لهذه المساجد من الطراز المملوكي القديم كما في جامع فاروق إلى الطراز العُثماني كما في مسجد النور والهندسة المعمارية الحديثة في مسجد جامعة الخرطوم. وتوجد بمعظم المساجد مدارس قرآنية تدرس علوم الفقه والتوحيد وغيرها من الدروس الدينية وخلاويها لتعليم النشء كيف الصلاة وغيرها من العبادات وتحفيظ القرآن.\n\nوللمسيحية تاريخاَ طويلاَ في الخرطوم يعود إلى دولة علوة التي اعتنقت الديانة المسيحية في سنة 580 ميلادية وكانت عاصمتها سوبا (إحدى ضواحي الخرطوم حاليا) قبل أن تتعرض للتخريب على يد الفونج في سنة 1504 م،\nثم في العهد العثماني عندما أصبح أراكيل باشا الأرمني المسيحي حاكماً عاماً للسودان في سنة 1857 وخلال فترة الحكم الثنائي الذي كان على رأسه حكام بريطانيون.\n(أنظر: ملحق حكام السودان).\nوفي 3 ابريل / نيسان 1846 قرر بابا الفاتيكان غريغوري السادس عشر إنشاء مطرانية رسولية لوسط أفريقيا مع أبرشية في الخرطوم وتتبع لها اليوم أربع كنائس في الخرطوم بما فيها كاتدرائية القديس متى والقديس بطرس في منطقة الامتداد الجديد بالخرطوم.\nوتتبع لهذه الكنائس مدارس ومنظمات من بينها مدرسة فيلا جيلدا للبنات التابعة للكنيسة الأرثوذكسية بشارع 21 أكتوبر، المتقاطع مع شارع الطيار جميل، ومدارس كمبوني على شارع القصر التي أسسها الأسقف دانيال كمبوني.\nوكان في الخرطوم كنيس يهودي يقع في شارع القصر (شارع فكتوريا سابقا) مبنى على طراز معابد السفارديم ويعمل على خدمة اليهود قبل مغادرتهم السودان في أواخر ستينيات القرن الماضي، إلى جانب مقبرة يهودية قديمة بالخرطوم عند مدخل المنطقة الصناعية، جنوب كوبري الحرية.\n\nأسماء الشوارع والميادين العامة في الخرطوم\nتفتقر الخرطوم إلى خطة واضحة فيما يتعلق بأسماء الأحياء السكنية والشوارع والميادين العامة، فضلا عن أن معظمها لا توجد عليه لوحات تدل علي اسمه ولا على ارقام العقارات والمنازل المطلة عليه حسبما هو وارد في خططها التخطيطية العديدة، وتتنوع مصادر الأسماء الموجودة والمتعارف عليها فبعض الأحياء السكنية مثلاً يحمل أسماء أحياء أو مدن عربية ظهرت بعض موجات الهجرة إلى تلك البلدان خاصة دول الخليج ومن هذه الأحياء: الرياض والطائف (مدن سعودية) والدوحة (مدينة قطرية) والمنشية والجاردن سيتي (أحياء مدن مصرية) والأندلس (مغربية) ووالقادسية (عراقية).\nومن أسماء الشوارع: شارع غوردون (نسبة للجنرال غوردون باشا) حاكم السودان في أواخر فترة حكم التركية السابقة في السودان وتبدل اسمه بعد استقلال السودان في عام 1956 وفي إطار سياسة السودنة إلي شارع الجامعة (نسبة إلى جامعة الخرطوم المطلة عليه)، وشارع فكتوريا (نسبة للملكة فكتوريا ملكة بريطانيا) وأصبح شارع القصر، وهناك شارع ونجت باشا سمي باسم (ريجنالد ونجت حاكم عام السودان في الفترة 1899 - 1916، وأصبح اسمه لاحقاً شارع البرلمان أما شارع السردار (وهو قائد القوات البريطانية إبان فترة الاستعمار الحكم الثنائي) أصبح شارع الجمهورية وشارع الدفتردار (نسب إلى الدفتردار محمد، صهر محمد على باشا في سنة 1821 م) أصبح شارع المك نمر (نسبة للمك نمر حاكم شندي الذي قتل قائد الجيش العثماني المصري في سنة 1821 م) وشارع إسماعيل باشا (نسبة إلى إسماعيل باشا نجل محمد علي باشا وقائد الحملة على السودان قي سنة 1821م) وأصبح شــارع علي عبد اللطيف (أحد رموز المقاومة الوطنية ضد الاستعمار البريطاني في السودان) وشارع محمد نجيب (أول رئيس وزراء مصر ي بعد ثورة تموز / يوليو 1952 م) ولم يتغير اسم الشارع تخليداً لذكرى محمد نجيب ذو الأصول والسودانية (أمه مصرية وأبوه سوداني) كذلك لم يتغير اسم شارع كاترينا نسبة إلى مدام كاترينا اليونانية الأصل وصاحبة متجر في ستينيات القرن الماضي كان يقع شرق حديقة القرشي بالخرطوم والتي بدورها كانت تعرف باسم حديقة عبود في عام 1960 نسبة إلى الرئيس إبراهيم عبود وتحولت إلى حديقة القرشي نسبة إلى شهيد ثورة أكتوبر أحمد القرشي والتي أطاحت بحكومة الرئيس عبود. ومن شوارع الخرطوم الأخرى التي تحمل أسماء سودانية شارع السيد عبد الرحمن (نسبة إلى عبد الرحمن المهدي زعيم طائفة الأنصار ورمز منم رموز الاستقلال) وشارع السيد علي الميرغني (زعيم طائفة الختمية وأحد رموز الاستقلال)، وشارع عبيد ختم الذي سمي على الشهيد عبيد ختم، وهي تسمية جديدة وشارع البلابل (نسبة إلى فرقة البلابل| الغنائية المشهورة في السودان). وأطلق على الشارع الرئيس المؤدي إلى مطار الخرطوم الدولي اسم شارع إفريقيا.\nأما الميادين العامة فمن أشهرها ميدان عباس (سمي على اسم الخديو عباس) وتحول اسمه لاحقاً إلى ميدان الأمم المتحدة ثم اقيمت في مساحته مكتبة القبة الخضراء وأخيراً مول الواحة، وهناك ميدان عبد المنعم محمد (أحد رجال الأعمال البارزين) تمت إعادة تسميته إلى ميدان نادي الأسرة.\nولعل من أبرز ساحات وميادين الخرطوم العامة ميدان أبو جنزير وسمي على اسم الشيخ أبو جنزير (وهو أحد شيوخ الصوفية في الخرطوم كان يدير خلوة لتدريس القرآن في هذا المكان حتى توفي ودفن فيه وأقيم عليه ضريحاً له كان موجودا حتى وقت فريب تحيط به سلسلة من الحلقات الحديدية الصنع)، كذلك يوجد في الخرطوم ميدان جاكسون بمنطقة الخرطوم غرب والذي لم يكن معروفاً بشكل واسع قبل أن يتم مؤخراً تحويل موقف حافلات الركاب العامة إليه من مواقفها بمنطقة وسط الخرطوم (وسمي الميدان والحي الذي يقع عليه بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى جاكسون باشا مهندس المساحة الإنجليزي ببلدية الخرطوم في عام 1920 م.\n\nمعالم الخرطوم\nالاقتصاد\nكتب ونستون تشرشل رئيس وزراء بريطانيا الأسبق، في كتابه حرب النهر، عن الخرطوم وقال «إن مدينة الخرطوم الواقعة عند التقاء النيلين الأزرق والأبيض، هي النقطة التي يجب أن تلتقي فيها التجارة حتماً مع الجنوب. وهي الصنبور الكبير الذي تمر من خلاله البضائع التي تم جمعها من منطقة واسعة وتنساب شمالا نحو ساحل البحر المتوسط. فهي معلم لأقصى حدود شمال السودان الخصب. وينساب النهر بين الخرطوم وأسوان لمسافة 1 كيلومتر عبر الصحراء القاحلة».\n\nلايزال اقتصاد الخرطوم يعتمد على التجارة وإعادة توزيع البضائع والسلع وعلى قطاع الخدمات، خاصة الخدمات المالية كالبنوك ومكاتب الصرافة والتأمينات وغيرها.\nوكانت التجارة في فترة الحكم الثنائي حكراً على ثلاث شركات بريطانية تهيمن على الصادر والوارد في السودان وهي: شركة متشل كوتس، وشركة سودان مركنتايل، وشركة جلاتلي هانكي وشركائهم، حيث يقوم التجار المحليون ببيع المحاصيل الزراعية السودانية من قطن وصمغ عربي وسمسم وفول سوداني لتلك الشركات التي تقوم بدورها تصدير السلع السودانية للخارج واستيراد سلع وبضائع أجنبية وبيعها لتجار الجملة المحليين.\nيتنوع النشاط الاقتصادي الحالي في المدينة من زراعي إلى صناعي وسياحي، ويتركز بصفة أساسية على قطاع الخدمات حيث نجد مجموعة كبيرة من السكان تعمل في دواوين الدولة وشركات وبنوك القطاع الخاص، كما أن هناك شريحة كبيرة من اصحاب رؤوس الأموال تمارس التجارة، أما سكان المناطق الريفية المحيطة بالمدينة وبعض القاطنين علي ضفاف النيل فيعملون بالزراعة والرعي ويمدون العاصمة بالخضر والفاكهة والألبان واللحوم والأسماك، ومنهم من يمارس صناعة الفخار والطوب.\n\nالمصارف والنشاط المالي\nتقع معظم المقار الرئيسية للبنوك التجارية في الخرطوم (حوالي 15 مصرفاً) من بينها بنك الخرطوم وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لبنك السودان المركزي إلى جانب الشركات الأجنبية المستثمرة في السودان كشركات جنوب شرقي آسيا بما فيها الشركات الصينية (مثل شركة النفط الوطنية الصينية) والماليزية (كشركة بتروناس) وغيرها وتوجد في الخرطوم بورصة باسم سوق الخرطوم للأوراق المالية تم انشائها في عام 1995 وبلغ عدد الأسهم المتداولة فيها في عام 2012 حوالي 183,491.5 ألف سهم وحجم التبادل في العام ذاته 3,073.5 مليون جنيه سوداني. ولعل وجود مسبك لضرب العملة المعدنية في الخرطوم يدل على الطابع التجاري والاقتصادي للمدينة.\n\nانظر أيضا:\n\nقائمة بنوك الخرطوم\n\nالأسواق\nتنشط في الخرطوم تجارة الجملة والتجزئة وتنتشر فيها الأسواق، فإلى جانب الأسواق الصغيرة في الأحياء توجد اسواقاً كبيرة أبرزها هي:\n\nالسوق العربي:\nيقع في وسط الخرطوم ويعد من اعرق مراكز التسوق والتجمع لمواطني

مجمع جياد الصناعي جنوب الخرطوم الذي يقوم بتصنيع السيارات والجرارات الزراعية إضافة إلى بعض قطع الغيار والحديد والالمنيوم.\n\nالقطاع العقاري\nيعتبر قطاع التشييد والعقارات مهماً فيها باعتبارها مدينة متروبوليتية تنمو بوتيرة سريعة. ويعتبر مشروع مدينة المقرن الذي تقوم بتنفيذه شركة السنط من المشروعات المهمة في هذا القطاع. تبلغ قيمته أكثر من أربعة (4) مليار دولار وتشمل تطوير عدة آلاف من الهكتارات من الأرض تشمل تطوير منطقة أعمال مركزية وبناء عقارات سكنية ووصف المشروع بأن الحلم الذي يراود الخرطوميين بجعل مدينتهم في مصاف المدن العالمية الراقية.\n\nالزراعة والبستنة\nتنتشر المزارع والبساتين في اطراف الخرطوم الشرقية والجنوبية حيث يتم إنتاج الفاكهة والخضر والدواجن والألبان. وهناك عدد من المشاريع العاملة في هذا المجال أهمها مشروع سندس الزراعي ومشروع سوبا الزراعي إلى جانب مشاريع لتربية المواشي والدواجن ومشروعات صيد الأسماك ومزارع للخضر والفاكهة وإنتاج الأعلاف. وهناك مزارع لتربية الحيوانات البرية منها: مزارع عيسى ومزارع معنى في سوبا شرق، ومراكز لتجميع الحيوانات البرية وأهمها مركز الكنغر في حي السلمي وهو واحد من ثلاثة مراكز منتشرة في العاصمة المثلثة أحدهما في الكدرو بالخرطوم بحري والآخر في أم درمان وجميعها تابع للقطاع الخاص.\n\nالأعياد والعطلات الرسمية\nالأعياد والعطلات الرسمية التي تغلق فيها دوواين الحكومة والأسواق الكبيرة أبوابها هي المناسبات نفسها التي تشمل السودان كله.\n\nالإعلام والاتصالات\nالإذاعة\nتوجد استوديوهات الإذاعة الوطنية والتلفزيون الوطني الموجه ارسالهما إلى كافة أرجاء السودان في مدينة أم درمان المجاورة وليس الخرطوم، ولكن توجد لمدينة الخرطوم إذاعة محلية خاصة بها بدأت بثها لأول مرة في 30 يونيو / حزيران 1992 م انطلاقاً من أستديوهات الهيئة القومية للإذاعة بأم درمان وكانت تعمل في اطار منظومة الإذاعات الإقليمية والموجهة بهدف سد جوانب القصور في الإذاعة السودانية الوطنية فيما يتعلق بقضايا ولاية الخرطوم المحلية وامتد ارسالها لمدة ساعتين يوميا على موجة متوسطة طولها 521 كيلو هيرتز وأول من اختير مديرا لها هو صلاح الدين التوم، وأول مذيعة هي نجوى مهدي واستمرت الإذاعة في البث على هذا المنوال حتى عام 1998 م ثم توقفت لتستأنف الإرسال مجدداً في العام الذي تلاه باسم هيئة اذاعة وتلفزيون الخرطوم ولمدة أربع ساعات يومياً وفي سبتمبر / ايلول 7 م، أصبحت إذاعة الخرطوم تبث برامجها طوال الأربع عشرين ساعة في اليوم ثم تقلّصت مدة الإرسال إلى 18 ساعة ولكن اضيفت إلى الإذاعة الموجة الجديدة إف إم 107.\n\nالتلفزيون\nللخرطوم قناة تلفزيونية محلية تعمل إلى جانب قناة تلفزيون السودان القومي. وتبث ارسالها على القمر الصناعي نايل سات.\n\nالصحف والمطبوعات\nتصدر معظم الصحف والمجلات

التيجاني يوسف بشير الذي كتب في قصيدته «الخرطوم»:\n\nالأندية الاجتماعية والرياضية\nتشتهر الخرطوم بالأندية والمراكز الثقافية والاجتماعية والرياضية العديدة، ويعود تاريخ تأسيس بعضها إلى فترات قديمة مثل نادي السودان Sudan Club الذي أسسه البريطانيون إبان الحكم الثنائي ليكون ملتقى اجتماعياً لموظفيهم، والنادي العربي وأسسه المصريون، إلى جانب أندية الجاليات المختلفة مثل النادي السوري والنادي الأرمني والنادي الألماني والنادي اليوناني والنادي الكاثوليكي والنادي الهندي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، ومعهد جوتة الألماني، وشهدت العقود القليلة الماضية تأسيس أندية سودانية مماثلة مثل نادي الضباط ونادي الشرطة.وتقام في هذه الأندية عدة فعاليات ثقافية واجتماعية ورياضية خاصة في مواسم الأعياد الدينية والوطنية.\nومن أهم الأندية الرياضية لكرة القدم في الخرطوم:\n\nنادي بري، وهو من أقدم أندية السودان الرياضية تأسس في عام 1908م.\nنادي النيل.\nنادي الأهلي الخرطوم.\nنادي الخرطوم الوطني.\n\nويوجد استاد رياضي كبير في منطقة الخرطوم جنوب هو ملعب الخرطوم، إلى جانب ملاعب للتنس التي تعد واحدة

الخرطوم \"Khartoum\" يحكي قصة حصار المهدي للخرطوم ومقتل غوردون باشا الذي لعب دوره الممثل تشارلتون هيستون، بينما مثل دور المهدي الممثل لورانس اوليفييه. والفيلم من إخراج باسيل ديردن وسيناريو الآن كايلو وإنتاج جوليان بلايستاين، ومدة عرضه 134 دقيقة. وقد وقامت بتوزيعه شركة \"Ultra Panavision 70\"، ويتعارض مع المفهوم السوداني لحصار الخرطوم باعتباره هدفاُ لتصفية الاستعمار، فهو يحتوي على مشاهد وعروض سلبية للمهدي وقواته.\n\nفعاليات أخرى\nمن الفعاليات السياحية في الخرطوم مشاهدة تغيير الحرس الجمهوري في أول يوم جمعة من كل شهر مام البوابة الجنوبية للقصر الجمهوري.واحتفالات المولد النبوي التي تقام سنوياً في

العلا، كاتبة سودانية.\n\nكبار زوار الخرطوم\nالمنظمات الدولية في الخرطوم\nهناك عدد من المنظمات الدولية العربية والإفرقية التي اتخذت من الخرطوم مقراً رئيسياً لها ومنها:\n\nالسكان\nتتنوع التركيبة السكانية للخرطوم نتيجة الهجرات العديدة إليها منذ عهود قديمة فإلى جانب الجنسيات والقوميات المختلفة التي قدمت ضمن جيوش محمد علي باشا واعداد الموظفين الكبيرة من أصول غير سودانية مثل الأتراك والجركس والأرناؤوط والأغريق والبنيان والسوريين والمصريين والأرمن والأكراد ووفدت مؤخراً إلى الخرطوم عمالة أجنبية شملت الأتراك ومن آسيا كالصينيين والبنغال وهاجرت إلى الخرطوم جماعات من البلدان الأفريقية المجاورة وغير المجاورة لأسباب سياسية واقتصادية ونتيجة لموجات الجفاف في بلدانها ومن بين هؤلاء المهاجرين لاجئين من إثيوبيا واريتريا وتشاد وزائير ومن الصومال وجنوب أفريقيا وسورية،\nهذا فضلاً عن الهجرات الداخلية من ولايات السودان المختلفة لأسباب عديدة في مقدمتها الهجرة التقليدية من الريف إلى الحضر ولأسباب القتال في بعضها كما في دارفور وجنوب كردفان.\nنما عدد سكان المدينة من 245,000 في عام 1955 إلى\n784000 نسمة في عام 1973، و1،343,000 شخص في عام 1983 ليصل إلى 3 ملايين فرد في تعداد عام 1993. ويشكل الذكور نسبة 54 في المائة من السكان، مما يعكس وضعا يهيمن فيه الذكور على عملية الهجرة إلى الخرطوم وتبين الإحصاءات الديمغرافية للخرطوم بأن حوالي 61 في المائة من السكان\nتتراوح أعمارهم بين 15-64 عاما مما يدل على أن منطقة الخرطوم الكبرى تستقطب المجموعات السكانية الأكثر إنتاجية وتعتبر أم درمان الجزء الأكثر اكتظاظا بالسكان\nبنسبة|نسبة تقدر بحوالي 43.5 في المائة من مجموع سكان العاصمة المثلثة، ولكنها الأقل نسبة من حيث عدد الأفراد في كل أسرة (6.1) فرد في حين أن الرقم هو (6.5) في الخرطوم بحري، و (6.4) في الخرطوم. ويشكل الأجانب نسبة لا تزيد على 1.4 في المائة من مجموع السكان وهو رقم أخذ في التزايد بشكل مضطرد منذ اكتشاف النفط، ونمو أعمال التصدير. وعند تصنيف السكان حسب الديانة يظهر بأن الإسلام هو دين الأغلبية بنسبة تبلغ 88.6 في المائة، مقابل 11.2 في المائة للمسيحيين الذين ازدادت أعدادهم في العقود الأخيرة بشكل ملحوظ نتيجة لتوافد أعداد كبيرة من النازحين واللاجئين\nمن جنوب السودان وجبال النوبة ومن إثيوبيا وأريتريا هرباً من الحروب الأهلية في مناطق سكناهم الأصلية. وعلى الرغم من أن معدل وفيات الأطفال الرضع قد انخفض في الخرطوم، فإنه لا يزال عالياً جدا. وكان معدل الأمية في الخرطوم قد بلغ في عام 1993 حوالي 26.4 في المائة لكلا الجنسين، (18.9 في المائة للذكور و35 في المائة للإناث) وفقا لصندوق الأمم المتحدة للسكان، ولكنها وفقاً لدراسات سودانية في عام 1998 لا تزيد عن 4 بالمائة.\nجدول ديموغرافي يبين النمو السكاني لمدينة الخرطوم والتجمع الحضري للعاصمة المثلثة خلال عقود\n\nمشاكل البيئية والاجتماعية\nتعاني الخرطوم من مشاكل بيئية واضحة تتمثل في مشكلة نقل النفايات ومشكلة الصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الأمطار ومشاكل طبيعية أخرى تتمثل في الفيضانات والأتربة والزحف الصحراوي ونحت التربة في ضفاف النيل.\nوتتمثل المشاكل الاجتماعية في ظاهرة التشرد واطفال الشوارع، نتيجة موجات اللاجئين التي شهدتها المدينة بسبب الحروب والقتال في الداخل وفي البلدان المجاورة والهجرة من الريف إلى المدينة وما نتج عن ذلك من انتشار السكن العشوائي في الأطراف الهامشية للمدينة والباعة المتجولين في أسواقها.\n\nمعرض صور\nلمزيد من

      "summary": "الْخَرْطُوْم هيَ عاصمة السُّودان وحاضرة ولاية الخرطُوم، تقع عند نقطة التقاء النّيل الأبيض بالنّيل الأزرق (المقرن)، ليُشكلا معاً نهر النيل. وهي مركز الحكم في السُّودان حيث يوجد فيها مقر رئيس الجمهورية والحكومة، ورئاسة الوزارات المركزية المختلفة وقيادة القوات المسلحة السودانية والبعثات الدبلوماسية الأجنبية من سفارات وقنصليات، ومقر بعض المنظمات الإقليمية العربية والإفريقية ومعظم المؤسسات السياسية للدولة. وهي قلب أفريقيا بالنسبة لخطوط الطيران، وذلك لمرور خطوط الطيران التي تقطع شمال القارة تجاه جنوبها وتلك التي تمر عبر غرب القارة وشرقها. يوجد بالمدينة العديد من الجامعات والكليات الحكومية والخاصة والمؤسسات التعليمية المختلفة ورئاسات الشركات والبنوك الوطنية وفروع الشركات الأجنبية.\nيرجع تاريخ تأسيس الخرطوم كعاصمة، إلى العقود الأولى من القرن التاسع عشر أثناء فترة الحكم العثماني المصري في السودان حيثُ اتخذت عاصمة للبلاد، إلا أن تاريخها كموقع استيطان بشري أبعد من ذلك بكثير فقد سكنها الإنسان منذ العصر الحجري، كما كان موقعها موطن حضارة قديمة عُرفت بمملكة علوة وشهد القَرن الماضي أول مرحلة من مراحل ازدهارها عندما شُيّدت العمارة في العهد البريطاني المصري على النسق المعماري الإنجليزي والذي لا يزال ماثلاً للعيان في الأبنية القديمة بجامعة الخرطوم ومبنى وزارة المالية ومصلحة البريد والبرق وبعض المرافق الحكومية المطلة على النيل وتحول بعضها إلى متاحف مفتوحة للجمهور، وفي بعض الجسور القديمة المقامة على نهر النيل والتي تربطها بما يحيط بها من مناطق حضرية. يبلغ عدد سكان مدينة الخرطوم 2,682,431 نسمة، وهي بذلك سادس مدينة من حيث عدد السكان في إفريقيا (ولا يشمل الرقم باقي سكان العاصمة المثلثة البالغ عددهم 5,172,000 تقريباً) ويمثل سكانها مختلف الإثنيات والمجموعات السكانية من داخل السودان وخارجه بالإضافة إلى أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين وغيرهم من الوافدين السياسيين، والمناخ في الخرطوم معتدل في فصل الشتاء مع ارتفاع في درجات الحرارة في الصيف وهطول أمطار غزيرة في موسم الخريف، وتتميز المدينة بموقعها الإستراتيجي في وسط السودان حيث التقاء النيل الأزرق بالنيل الأبيض، الذي جعل منها منطقة جذب سياحي تزخر بالمعالم الطبيعية والأثرية، ومحور نقل واتصالات محليّة وإقليمية.",

      "content": "Khartoum, en arabe : الخرطوم (al-Khurṭūm), est la capitale du Soudan. Elle est située au confluent du Nil Blanc (venant du Soudan du Sud) et du Nil Bleu (venant d'Éthiopie).\nLa ville elle-même compte plus de deux millions d'habitants ; avec les districts environnants d'Omdourman à l'ouest et de Bahri au nord, elle constitue une agglomération d'au moins sept millions d'habitants en 2023, la plus grande du pays.\n\nHistoire\nLa ville est fondée en 1821 par les troupes de Méhémet Ali, pour bénéficier d'une position jugée stratégique sur la route des caravanes entre Égypte et Éthiopie, au nord de l'ancienne cité de Soba. \nLes Britanniques prennent contrôle de la ville à l'issue de la guerre anglo-égyptienne de 1882. En 1884-1885, la ville est assiégée pendant neuf mois par les troupes de l'insurrection mahdiste, qui s'en emparèrent et massacrent les troupes anglo-égyptiennes, commandées par le général Gordon, qui contrôlaient alors le Soudan. En 1898, les Britanniques parviennent à reprendre la ville.\nSévèrement touchée par les aléas de la guerre durant ces années, la ville est entièrement reconstruite selon les plans d'un architecte britannique et devient la capitale du condominum anglo-égyptien, puis du Soudan à partir de l'indépendance de 1956.\nEn 1973, des terroristes palestiniens du groupe Septembre noir attaquent l'ambassade saoudienne et tuent deux diplomates américains et un belge.\n\nÀ la suite des attentats du 7 août 1998 contre les ambassades américaines à Nairobi (Kenya) et Dar es Salaam (Tanzanie), attentats imputés à Oussama ben Laden et Al-Qaïda, les États-Unis d'Amérique, en représailles, bombardent, le 20 août suivant, une usine de produits pharmaceutiques située à Khartoum (outre les frappes visant des camps en Afghanistan).\nLe 3 juin 2019, après le coup d'État qui renverse Omar el-Bechir, l'armée tue plus d'une centaine de manifestants qui protestaient contre le nouveau régime.\nAu moins 23 personnes sont tuées et plus de 130 sont blessées dans l'incendie d'une usine au nord de la ville, en décembre 2019.\nLe 1er juillet 2020, des militants ont exigé que la rue al-Zibar Basha à Khartoum soit renommée. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur était un marchand d'esclaves et la rue al-Zibar Basha mène à la base militaire où le massacre de Khartoum en 2019 a eu lieu.\nLe 26 octobre 2021, la ville a été bouclée à la suite d'un coup d'État militaire qui a fait au moins 7 morts, déclenchant des manifestations et des appels à la grève générale. Le Premier ministre Abdalla Hamdok a été arrêté lors du coup d’État et détenu avec d’autres membres du cabinet dans un lieu inconnu.\nLe 15 avril 2023, des combats entre les forces armées soudanaises et les RSF ont éclaté à travers le Soudan, y compris à Khartoum. Des combats ont été signalés au palais présidentiel, au siège des RSF, à l'aéroport international de Khartoum et à l'aéroport de Merowe, que les RSF prétendent avoir capturé. Les forces armées soudanaises ont repris le contrôle total de Khartoum le 26 mars 2025.\n\nGéographie\nKhartoum est située au centre-est du pays et au confluent du Nil Bleu et du Nil Blanc. Omdurman se trouve au nord-nord-ouest de la capitale, sur la rive gauche du Nil Blanc, et Bahri au nord. La position de cette dernière lui fait border les deux cours d'eau, à l'égal de Khartoum. L'île de Tuti est visible au centre du confluent, entre les trois villes.\n\nClimat\nKhartoum bénéficie d'un climat aride à longue saison sèche « hivernale », typique de la zone saharo-sahélienne qui marque la transition progressive entre le Sahara, espace aride, et le Sahel, espace semi-aride. Le climat y est extrêmement sec pendant une bonne partie de l'année avec près de neuf mois où les précipitations moyennes sont inférieures ou égales à 5 mm. La très longue saison sèche est elle-même subdivisée en une saison très sèche et chaude qui dure de novembre à mars et en une saison sèche et très chaude qui dure d'avril à juin. Pendant cette partie de l'année, les alizés continentaux, chauds et secs, associés au régime anticyclonique, venus des déserts, balayent la région, notamment l'harmattan (vent de secteur nord ou nord-est) : le ciel est parfaitement dégagé, le temps est clair, stable, très sec, et l'inhibition pluviométrique y est totale. La saison des pluies, très brève et irrégulière, dure environ un mois et le maximum pluviométrique est atteint en août avec près de 75 mm. En revanche, la saison des pluies résulte d'un changement du régime des vents : la région est alors soumise au régime dépressionnaire associé à la remontée vers le nord de la zone de convergence intertropicale. Les précipitations moyennes annuelles sont très faibles avec seulement 162 mm d'eau. On enregistre en moyenne six jours par an avec 10 mm ou plus et dix-neuf jours par an avec 1 mm ou plus de précipitations. \nLes températures les plus élevées se rencontrent à deux périodes de l'année : la première à la fin de la saison sèche, où les températures moyennes maximales dépassent constamment 40 °C d'avril à juin et la seconde au tout début de la saison sèche où les températures moyennes maximales dépassent 39 °C pendant les mois de septembre et d'octobre. Cependant, des pics à 40 °C ou plus sont susceptibles de se produire entre fin février et fin novembre. On enregistre, par an, jusqu'à 170 jours par an où le mercure atteint ou dépasse la barre des 40 °C. Ces deux maximums thermiques s'expliquent par le fait que dans cette zone, le soleil atteint son zénith à deux périodes bien différentes. Les températures moyennes maximales restent supérieures à 30 °C pendant les mois les moins chauds. Khartoum est l'une des grandes villes les plus chaudes du monde, avec une températures moyenne journalière annuelle de près de 30 °C. C'est aussi une des grandes villes les plus ensoleillées au monde, avec une durée moyenne annuelle d'ensoleillement tournant autour de 3 700 heures[réf. nécessaire].\n\nCulture\nLe musée national du Soudan conserve une partie des fresques de la cathédrale de Faras qui ont été sauvées de 1961 à 1964 dans le cadre d'une mission de l'UNESCO pour le sauvetage des temples de Nubie des eaux du lac Nasser, par l'équipe d'archéologues polonais de Kazimierz Michalowski[réf. nécessaire]. \n\nLa cathédrale qui a fonctionné sans interruption du VIIIe siècle au XIVe siècle contenait cent soixante-neuf fresques dont soixante-sept sont désormais conservées dans la collection du musée national de Varsovie, créé tout exprès pour les accueillir et au musée de Khartoum.\n\nEnseignement supérieur\nKhartoum est le siège principal de la plupart des principaux établissements d’enseignement du Soudan. Il existe quatre principaux niveaux d’enseignement :\n\nJardin d'enfants et garderie. Cela commence à l'âge de 3-4 ans et se compose de 1 à 2 niveaux (selon les parents).\nÉcole primaire. Les élèves de première année entrent à l’âge de 6-7 ans. Il comprend 8 niveaux, après lesquels, à 13-14 ans, les élèves sont prêts à passer les examens de certificat et à entrer au lycée.\nLycée. Dans ces trois méthodes scolaires, on ajoute quelques matières académiques principales telles que la chimie, la biologie, la physique et la géographie. Il y a trois niveaux à ce niveau. L'âge des étudiants varie entre 14-15 et 17-18 ans.\nEnseignement supérieur. Il existe plusieurs universités et collèges à Khartoum, notamment l'Université de Khartoum et l'Université soudanaise des sciences et technologies.\n\nTransports\nKhartoum abrite le plus grand aéroport du Soudan, l'aéroport international de Khartoum. C'est la plaque tournante principale de Sudan Airways, le principal transporteur du Soudan. Un nouvel aéroport était prévu dans la périphérie sud de la ville, mais avec la croissance rapide de Khartoum et l'étalement urbain qui en résulte, l'aéroport est toujours situé au cœur de la ville[réf. nécessaire].\n\nLe transport à Khartoum se limite au réseau routier, les bus et les véhicules personnels constituant les principaux types de véhicules. Comme dans de nombreuses villes du continent, certaines parties de Khartoum sont reliées par des bus privés.\n\nÉconomie\nAprès la signature de l'accord de paix global historique entre le gouvernement du Soudan et le Mouvement populaire de libération du Soudan (SPLA), le gouvernement du Soudan a lancé un projet de développement de grande envergure. En 2007, les plus grands projets à Khartoum étaient le projet de développement Al-Mogran, deux hôtels cinq étoiles, un nouvel aéroport, le pont El Mek Nimr (achevé en octobre 2007) et le pont Tuti qui relie Khartoum à l'île de Tuti[réf. nécessaire].\nAu XXIe siècle, Khartoum s’est développé grâce à la richesse pétrolière du Soudan (bien que l’indépendance du Soudan du Sud en 2011 ait eu un impact négatif sur l’économie du Soudan). Le centre de la ville possède des rues bordées d'arbres. Khartoum a la plus forte concentration d’activité économique du pays. La situation a changé à mesure que des développements économiques majeurs ont lieu dans d’autres régions du pays, comme l’exploration pétrolière dans le sud, le complexe industriel de Giad dans l’État d’Al Jazirah et le projet sucrier du Nil Blanc dans le centre du Soudan, et le barrage de Merowe dans le nord[réf. nécessaire].\nParmi les industries de la ville, on trouve l'imprimerie, la fabrication du verre, la transformation des aliments et le textile. Les produits pétroliers sont désormais produits dans l’extrême nord de l’État de Khartoum, fournissant du carburant et des emplois à la ville. L’une des plus grandes raffineries du Soudan est située dans le nord de Khartoum[réf. nécessaire].\n\nCommerce de détail\nLe Souq al Arabi est le plus grand marché en plein air de Khartoum. Le Bazar s'étend sur plusieurs pâtés de maisons dans le centre de Khartoum, juste au sud de la Grande Mosquée (Mesjid al-Kabir) et de la gare des minibus. Il est divisé en sections distinctes, dont une entièrement consacrée à l'or[réf. nécessaire].\nLes rues Al Qasr et Al Jamhoriyah sont considérées comme les rues principales les plus célèbres de l'État de Khartoum[réf. nécessaire].\nLe centre commercial Afra est situé dans la banlieue sud d'Arkeweet. Le centre commercial Afra dispose d'un supermarché, de points de vente au détail, de cafés, d'un bowling, de cinémas et d'une aire de jeux pour enfants[réf. nécessaire].\nEn 2011, le Soudan a ouvert la section hôtelière et une partie de l'aire de restauration de la nouvelle tour de l'hôtel Corinthia. La section Centre commercial/Shopping est encore en construction.\nKhartoum est connu pour le souk Libya, un des plus grands marchés de la région, comptant environ 3 800 boutiques.\n\nLieux de culte\nParmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées musulmanes.   Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Archidiocèse de Khartoum (Église catholique), Église intérieure du Soudan (Alliance baptiste mondiale), Presbyterian Church in Sudan (Communion mondiale d'Églises réformées)[réf. nécessaire].\n\nJumelages\nAnkara (Turquie)\n Istanbul (Turquie)\n Wuhan (Chine)\n Le Caire (Égypte)\n Amman (Jordanie)\n Saint-Pétersbourg (Russie)\n Asmara (Érythrée)\n Addis-Abeba (Éthiopie)\n Brasilia (Brésil)\n Hargeisa (Somalie)\n Dubaï (Émirats arabes unis)\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nMohammed Naguib (1901-1984), homme politique et président égyptien ;\nNessim Gaon (1922-2022), financier suisse ;\nMohammed Wardi (1932-2012), compositeur et chanteur soudanais ;\nAhmed al-Mirghani (1941-2008), homme politique soudanais ;\nIntisar el-Zein Soughayroun (1958-), archéologue et ministre soudanaise ;\nConstantin Pappas (1962-), doubleur français d'origine grecque né à Khartoum ;\nAmal Habani (1974-), journaliste et militante des droits humains ;\nNasredeen Abdulbari (1977 ou 1978-), homme politique, ministre de la Justice ;\nFayçal Agab (1978-), footballeur soudanais ;\nAlsarah (1982-), chanteuse américano-soudanaise ;\nIsmaïl Ahmed Ismaïl (1984-), athlète soudanais ;\nNagmeldin Ali Abubakr (1986-), sprinteur soudanais.\nAlaa Satir (1991-), artiste et dessinatrice soudanaise.\nYousra Elbagir (vers 1992-), journaliste soudanaise.\nAlmoez Ali (1996-), footballeur qatari\nEric Ernest Burgess (1891-1977), créateur de parfum anglais\nAbdulaziz Abdul Ghani Ibrahim\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nLaure Crombé, Enjeux d’échelles, enjeux politiques : l'approvisionnement et l'accès à l'eau dans les quartiers périphériques du Grand Khartoum (Soudan) (thèse de doctorat), Fribourg, 2017, 349 p.

      "content": "## Overview\nKhartoum (Arabic: الخرطوم Al-Khartum) is the capital of Sudan and is located where the Blue and White Niles merge to form the Nile. The huge, spread-out city is actually made out of three distinct cities (Khartoum, Khartoum North or Bahri, and Omdurman) which are divided by the Nile and its two arms. The Blue Nile flows between Khartoum and Bahri, the White Nile between Khartoum and Omdurman, and the merged Nile between Bahri and Omdurman. The confluence of the Blue and White Nile, known as Al-Mogran, lies just north of the bridge between Khartoum and Omdurman.\nKhartoum proper is the seat of the Sudanese government and is the largest of the three cities. The older part of the city lies beside the White Nile while the newer parts, such as Al-Amarat and Khartoum Two, spread out to the south, across the railway line and the ring road, and around the airport runway. The city, both the old part and its newer extensions, is laid out mostly in a grid. Omdurman has a more Middle Eastern atmosphere with maze-like streets and is home to the huge Souq Omdurman. Bahri is largely industrial and residential.\n\n## By plane\n15.58949732.5531611 Khartoum Airport (KRT  IATA). Is the main gateway into Sudan by air. The airport is served by various Middle Eastern and African airlines. Among the cities with direct connections with Khartoum are: EgyptAir (Cairo), Emirates (Dubai), Ethiopian Airlines (Addis Ababa), Gulf Air (Bahrain), Kenya Airlines (Nairobi), Qatar Airways (Doha) Turkish Airlines (Istanbul).\nSudan's national carrier Sudan Airways[dead link] links Khartoum and several African and regional capitals, and with Sudan's domestic airports at Port Sudan, Nyala, El-Fashir, Malakal, Juba, Dongola, Wadi Halfa and El-Obeid.\nGo early as the airport can get a bit chaotic. Be prepared for long waits and queue cutting. Immigration checks and other security checks can also take a long time. No departure tax should be paid anymore, as it's included in a ticket price.\nThere is a bank facility to change money open during the night when there are flights.\nGetting to town: the airport is located close to the city in Al-Amarat. Taxi fare from Khartoum airport to city was a fixed SDG 100 in 2015. You can also walk out to the main road about 200 m from the airport terminal and catch minibuses that cruise along the road. Alternatively you can book a metered taxi.\n\n## By bus\nThe chaotic Souq al-Shaabi used to be the main bus terminal for long distance south-bound buses in Khartoum, but a new terminal 15.52725232.5435852 Khartoum Land terminal (Meena al Barre) has been built which is more orderly. Buses leave for Port Sudan, Wad Medani, Kassala, El-Obeid, Karima (8 hr, SGD 275), Gedarif (6 hr, SGD 275) and other cities. Again, there are no buses to southern Sudan.\nBuses to Atbara depart from 15.62402832.5437783 Khartoum North Bus Station (also known as Shendi Bus Station).\n\n## By train\nRail services to Khartoum are limited, but investment have brought hopes of a rejuvenation of train travel. There is the daily Nile Express from Atbara as well as services three times per day from Wad Madani. Older, more infrequent trains run from Port Sudan, Wadi Halfa - for connections with ferries from Egypt - and even Nyala. There main station is 15.63377132.5405834 Khartoum North (Bahri).\n\n## By car\nDescribing Khartoum's traffic as chaotic is a bit of an understatement. The economic boom has put many more cars on the road, although driving attitudes have not changed, resulting in almost comical chaos at intersections. As Khartoum is laid out in a grid, there are many intersections for cars from all directions to barge in to fight for space. Having said that, the slow speed of vehicles ensures that they are very few major accidents, at least in the city. If you are not used to such driving conditions, it is better to resort to taxis.\nCar hire is available and costs a bit above the African average.  However if you want to head off in to the desert the costs mount further, as the 100 km is standard, and then there is an additional charge per kilometre. Fuel costs around SDG 27 (US$4.20) per litre (Nov 2016).  ‘Limousine’ is the Arabic word for car hire – try along Airport Road or Ibed Khetim Road (east of the airport) for car hire places.\n\n## By boat\nThere are no ferry services between the three cities as they are well connected by road bridges.\nThere is a ferry service between Khartoum proper and Tuti Island, a rural islet in the middle of the Blue Nile. In Khartoum, boats leave from the river bank along Nile Street opposite the Friendship Hall to the west of the city center. A ferry also runs between Tuti and Omdurman (except on Fridays)\n\n## Get around\nKhartoum is both easy and difficult to get around. It is easy in that much of the city is laid out on a grid, with long straight roads and the airport and Nile as easy reference places. It is difficult in that the city (or indeed the 3 cities) are very spread out, making walking a long and tiring option.\nMaps are hard to come by, but Google Earth offers some good high-resolution images.\n\n## By taxi\nThese come in three varieties; bright yellow and often beaten up Toyota Corollas Model 1977, small 6-seater minivans, and more modern metered taxis.\nFair \"foreigner\" prices for taxis are roughly: SDG 17.50 plus SDG 4.61 per km.\nMost taxi drivers speak no English, can't read maps, and often can't read Arabic either; they often even have little idea about Khartoum's geography, especially about other parts of the city to where you pick him up.\nLimoTrip, ☏ +249 18 359 1313, info@limotrip.net. Air conditioned metered taxis with two-way radio.\n\n## By minibus\nMinibuses are the cheapest way to get around Khartoum, especially between the three cities. There are easily thousands of minibuses and seeing all of them gather near the Great Mosque and Souk al-Arabi is a sight to behold. They are however quite complicated to use. None of them bear destination signs and you will have to be able to speak a little Arabic with their conductors to determine which minibus to take. They are also always packed to the brim. Fares are SDG 3-5 (June 2017).\nMost of the minibuses leave from the square near the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) or nearby in Khartoum proper.\n\n## By three-wheeled taxis\nCalled \"bajaj\" (like in India) or \"raksha\", they are cheaper than taxis but more expensive than buses so less than SDG 5 per trip. They are best used for short trips within each of Khartoum's three cities. It is better to use taxis or minibuses if you have to cross the Nile to travel between the three cities.\n\n## Khartoum (الخرطوم)\nNile Street or Shari'a Al-Nilشارع النيل الخرطوم: Probably the prettiest street in Khartoum. With the Blue Nile on one side, the street is lined with pretty, albeit decaying-looking, colonial buildings, most of which are used as ministries, schools and even a hotel, the Grand Holiday Villa Khartoum. The Presidential Palace, also fronting the Blue Nile, is a pretty building but you will not be allowed to walk in front of it - the guards will ask you to cross the road and proceed behind and around the building. You will also see the modern side of Khartoum along this street - the egg-shaped, Libyan-owned Al-Fateh Tower; Chinese-built Friendship Hall. The National Museum is also along Nile Street. The road is tree-lined most of the way (except towards the west) and has a sidewalk, so walking is quite pleasant. Many people sit on the concrete walls along the river.\n15.60832.5290351 Sudan Presidential Palace Museum. This museum is located in the grounds of the Presidential Palace and is housed in the impressive century old Palace Cathedral. The palace contains many relics and pieces related to Sudan's administrative and modern political history, from paintings of Sir Gordon Pasha to the Presidential cars of more recent rulers.\nThe Changing of the Guard: This is a ceremony held on the first Friday of every month, where the Black Guard and the White Guard of the Presidential Palace swap over. The ceremony is performed near the South Gate of the palace.\n15.61493832.4921222 Confluence of the Blue and White Nile. If you have the stamina, you will reach the confluence of the two branches of the Nile if you continue walking west along Nile Street for about 3–4 km from the Presidential Palace. The confluence is called Al-Mogran and it is best seen from the metal bridge (the old one, not the newer concrete one) linking Khartoum and Omdurman or Al-Mogran Family Park. It is said that one can actually see the two different colours from the different branches come together and flow separately for a distance downriver before mixing together. The Al-Mogran Family Park, which has a Ferris wheel and other rides, is located near the bridge. Warning: There is a signboard saying \"no photos\" from the bridge. Please heed it as people have been arrested for taking photos of the confluence!    (updated Jan 2019)\n15.60234232.5245263 Souq Arabi. If you want to see crowds and action, this is the place. The commercial heart of town, Souq Arabi (Arabian Market) can provide everything you need (see \"Buy\" section for more details on shopping options). The market is huge and spread over several squares in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. Come here to see Khartoumites go about their daily lives.\n15.60632.5084 National Museum of Sudan (متحف السودان القومي), 1 Nile Street (Next to the Friendship Hall, just west of the Libyan-financed Burj el-Fatih sail-hotel.). Open from Monday to Friday. Surprisingly impressive museum that has had a bit of a revamp.  The large hall contains exhibits that rival those in the ancient Egypt sections of the British Museum or the New York Met, however if you’ve arrived in Khartoum fresh from temple gazing in Egypt things may look familiar.  The gardens contain three temples relocated from Aswan.  The joy of the place is that you’ll have it all pretty much to yourself. Best visit in the mornings, and give yourself 2 hours, tends to close at 12:00 but not reopen at 15:00, contrary to the sign on the door.      (updated Jul 2022)\n15.6079932.5342375 Sudan Ethnographic Museum. A fascinating little museum on the corner of Al Gamaa street and Mak Nemir Avenue. This museum explores the various cultures and traditions of Sudan's numerous ethnic groups. Displays range from intricate handicrafts to models of traditional homes. This museum is certainly worth a visit, if you have the time.\n15.60191132.5091256 Sudan National Botanical Garden.   (updated May 2021)\n15.604632.52057 King Farouq Mosque (مسجد الملك فاروق).  (updated Jul 2022)\n15.61049232.5339148 St. Matthew's Cathedral. Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic cathedral, built in 1908.   (updated Jul 2022)\n\n## Omdurman\nKandahar, souq Libya. At this restaurant you choose the meat that you want cooked (usually a choice between camel and lamb), you then hand over the meat to be cooked as part of your meal. Kandahar is one of the few places in Khartoum where you can find camel meat. It is located in Souq Libya in the peripheries of Omdurman. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Bahri (Khartoum North)\n15.64638632.56155613 Bombed Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. a fascinating place to explore, and well off the Khartoum tourist trail (if Khartoum even has such a thing). Tomahawked in 1998 the remains are an eerie reminder of Sudan's precarious relationship with the West. It's quite easy to reach - get a minibus to Bahri, then get a taxi.  The guards are quite friendly and will let you in for a wander - a contribution would be gratefully received.\n15.61438132.64512814 Nuba Wrestling. Every Friday at 16:00 two teams of wrestlers battle it out in front of several hundred spectators – and it certainly is quite a spectacle and well worth the trip.  Finishes around 18:00 and cost SDG 2.  It’s about 12 km from central Khartoum next to souq Sita Al Haj Yousef – best get a taxi there but you can easily find a bus back to al-Arabi in central Khartoum for SDG 3-5.\n15.9778332.5497415 Umm Marrahi fort (30 km north of the city). Ruined fortress on the top of Umm Marrahi hill, the defences was built in the 2nd half of the 6th century AD by the kingdom of Alwa.   (updated May 2021)\n\n## Clubs\nThere are many professional and international clubs spread around the three cities. Providing for sport, cultural activities or simply a place to meet, they are a lively remnant of British influence.\nGreek club. Khartoum 2, entrance off Mak Nimir Ave. The hideout of Sudan's Greek community, it is open to the public and offers sports facilities (tennis, volleyball, basketball, football, running), a swimming pool (entrance fee SDG 30) and basic food and drinks.\nCoptic club.\nGerman club. Nothing especially German, a basketball court, a garden in the shade of trees and a swimming pool. It also serves as a hotel.\nIndian club. Omdurman. The center of the capital's large Indian community social life, it organizes events for all important Indian festivals.\nA wander around Tuti island is highly recommended if you want to see green rather than the brown of Khartoum. If you are heading to Omdurman, a good way of unwinding after the chaos of the souq is to catch the ferry across to Tuti from Omdurman (except Fridays) or take the Tuti Suspension Bridge. Aim for around 17:00-18:00 to enjoy Tuti in the early evening.\nA Nile cruise, several boats moored by Tuti Bridge are available for cruises. A cruise on some of the smaller boats can cost you as little as SDG 15.\n\n## Cultural centers\nCentre Culturel Français. Downtown, Ali Dinar St. Offers French courses, Sudanese Arabic courses, a library and cultural events (music, art, literature, conferences, movies). Ask for the program at: info@ccfkrt.org.\nGoethe Institute. Downtown, Al Mak Nimir St. Offers German courses, cultural events (music, art, literature, conferences, movies). Ask for the program at: info@khartum.goethe.org or http://www.goethe.de/khartum.\nBritish Council. Downtown, Abu Sinn St. Offers English courses, cultural events (music, art, literature, conferences, movies). Ask for the program at: info@sd.britishcouncil.org or http://www.britishcouncil.org/africa-sd-contact-us.htm.\nIranian Cultural Center. Al Amarat, corner of Airport Rd and St 27.\n\n## In the evening\nEvening tea on Nile Avenue. With the extension of Nile Avenue to Manshia complete, the stretch of road between Mak Nimir and Manshia bridges has become the place to be of Khartoum's evening life. Innumerable tea ladies cater to the needs of the crowd enjoying the grass while watching the road and the river.\n\n## Music\nConcerts. The Sudanese music scene is active. Artists of the moment play live in clubs, mostly on weekend evenings. Look for the Arabic posters that dot the city or ask the locals.\nWeddings. It is common for Sudanese to hire star musicians to perform one or two of their favourite piece at wedding ceremonies. The footage of the performance usually ends up as an unofficial video clip on the Sudanese TV channels.\nCreative events. Khartoum youth and amateur scene can be spotted at one of the numerous and often changing cultural events. Whether Wapi (British Council), Makaan, Space or Khartoum Open Mic', they offer a scene for young musicians, hip hoppers, dancers, slammers and poets. Most accurate information is to be found on Facebook.\nKhartoum International Music Festival.\n\n## Movies\nCinemas. The last commercial cinemas closed in 2009 but the open air buildings of the Coliseum (Souk al Arabi), Halfaya and Watania(Khartoum North) or Watania (Omdurman) can still be spotted. Afra Mall movie theaters still shows movies, mainly Bollywood or Egyptian.\nFilm festivals. The European Union and the Embassy of Venezuela organize yearly film festivals. The French Cultural Center offers free weekly projections as does occasionally the Goethe Institute.\n\n## Buy\nMost shopping is still done in street markets or souqs. The souqs here are not as attractive those in other Middle Eastern countries but are still interesting enough for a glimpse of Sudanese economics. And you can certainly buy everything you need, including handicrafts if you are a tourist, from these markets. Prices are not amazingly low due to transport costs for imported (mainly Chinese) goods, but cheaper than in Afra Mall or proper shops. Upmarket, Khartoum has only one shopping mall with a supermarket, several shops and food outlets.\n\n## Khartoum\nSouq Arabi In the city centre, this is your classical chaotic market teeming with people. The market is divided in to several sections, each focussing on a certain product. There is even one block devoted to gold, although it certainly looks less sophisticated and organised than its counterpart in Dubai. However, this souq is a bit lacking in term of handicrafts and fresh foodstuff. You are better off going to Souq Omdurman (see below) for handicrafts.\n15.55932532.5549721 Afra Mall, Africa Road in the southern suburb of Arkawet. Afra is Khartoum's and Sudan's only mall but don't expect too much. Afra is already starting to lose it new shininess - it is more like a small neighbourhood mall rather than those you would find in Hong Kong, Singapore or Dubai. It has a supermarket and retail outlets selling clothes and other things you would expect to find in a mall. You can find money changers and pre-paid mobile telephone kiosks too.  Afra Mall is certainly not a must-see attraction, nor a place to head for a night out.    (updated Jan 2011)\n15.58524732.5443422 Al-Amarat Centre. For visitors this is probably your best bet for tracking down imported foodstuffs and household items.  Prices are high of course, but you are paying for convenience.    (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Khartoum North (Bahri)\nSaad Gishra. This is a covered market place; it is Bahri's main shopping market. Prices here can be a little higher than those in Souq Omdurman; however, it is much more easily navigable for tourists. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Eat\nKhartoum has a good sprinkling of restaurants, with new ones popping up every couple of months – other than restaurants attached to hotels there is little quality eating to be had in Khartoum’s city centre. Amarat hosts the majority of the better eateries, although Ridyah and Khartoum 2 also have some places.  Omdurman and Barhi have a light sprinkling of simple restaurants. All restaurants have about 15% government tax and 3-14% service charge.\n\n## Amarat\n15.57610332.5452281 Universal, Amarat St. 27. Italian flavoured, offering pleasant al fresco dining, priced with the expat wallet in mind.    (updated Jan 2011)\nMat'am 15 Cha'abi - Popular Restaurant 15, Al-Amarat, St 15 (on the square off Macro Supermarket /Syrian Fresh Food 2, facing Kanon Hotel). Serves north of Sudan traditional gurasa (a large thick wheat pancake) or kisra (large thin pancake) with your choice of sauce (bamya based with lamb or chicken) or yoghurt with sugar (gha'ib). Also has a juice bar. Very cheap (all dishes under SDG 5), it is a favourite of local workers and touk touk drivers. (updated Jan 2011)\nAmwaj Restaurant, Africa St, Al-Amarat (on the corner with Street 15 or \"Shari'a Khamsa ta-Ashaara\"), ☏ +249 91 828 8890. Big, airy and spotless, and really good food. Extremely popular with locals and visitors. Menu offers shawarmas, kebabs, grilled chicken, lamb stews and others, all accompanied by bread, soup and salad. Delicious fruit juices and shakes too. Dishes cost SDG 20-60. (updated Jan 2011)\nRoyal Broast, Airport Road, Al-Amarat. Another popular place a few doors from Amwaj. (updated Jan 2011)\nLaziz Delicious Restaurant, Al-Amarat Street 1. Nice place to eat in. They have another branch in Ryad area. (updated Jan 2011)\nAfra Mall Chinese restaurant food court, Afra Mall, Africa Street, Arkawet. Located on the first floor of Khartoum's only shopping mall. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Khartoum 2\n15.59577132.5368362 Assaha Restaurant. Would be considered an excellent restaurant in any city, and a Jewel in Khartoum. Good atmosphere with professional and knowledgeable wait staff. They have lots on the menu including luncheons, light meals and full dinners. A large selection of appetizers, mains, dessert and a \"hubble bubble\" cost about SDG 90 per person with everything included. They charge 12% government tax and 14% service charge.    (updated Jan 2011)\nAl Bawadi Tourist Restaurant, Ahmed Makki Abdu St (east of Souk Khartoum 2), ☏ +249 90 692 1951. A renowned table for spicy grilled chicken and broast. Mains cost SDG 15-20. (updated Jan 2011)\nHadramawt Restaurant, Khartoum 2 St 47 (west Souk Khartoum 2), ☏ +249 12 222 5252. Yemeni restaurant offering the traditional salta, fahsa, mandi, lahm hanith and fatah for dessert. Mains cost around SDG 15. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## East of the airport\n15.56151932.5625753 Habesha Ethiopian restaurant, +249 912302410 (Arkaweet Area, east of Afra Mall). Good atmosphere, good food and very affordable. The restaurant is on two floors (there is a pleasant internet cafe on the 3rd floor), upstairs is more lively with Ethiopian pop on the plasma screen. About SDG 25 each for a big meal and coffee. A good choice if you are looking for somewhere with music playing and a bit of atmosphere.    (updated Jan 2011)\nSalt 'n' Pepper, Buri area, north end of Obeid Khatim Street (Next to Buri family park), ☏ +249 91 011 0916. Only Pakistani restaurant in Sudan. Speciality in Pakistani spicy tasty dishes. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Bahri\n15.62370832.5571364 Asian Biryani Restaurant (Khartoum North). As the name suggests this place specialises in Biryanis - and very tasty they are too. More of a cafe than a restaurant this is a good choice for lunch rather than a slap-up dinner. Lamb Biryani and some salad for SDG 8. The restaurant, and the supermarket next door, sells excellent mango juice for SDG 1 a bottle (Maaza). Easy to get to, head over the Burri Bridge, take the first right, and it's on your left.    (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Downtown\nPapa Costa. In the center of Khartoum, and reasonably priced. Service charges are minimal, food is reasonably good, but service level is so-so. You can choose food from steak to pasta. They charge 3% service charge and 10% government tax. (updated Jan 2011)\n\n## Drink\nIt's best to prepare yourself to be alcohol-free for your stay: there are places serving 'special tea' dotted around and non-alcoholic beers are available, but in general it's more hassle than it's worth to track down alcohol during a short visit.  For long-termers, however, the market does exist - via diplomatic bags and other routes... apparently.\n\n## Sleep\nA 5% tourism tax and 15% VAT may well be added to your bill - Khartoum's hotels are inconsistent in telling you about these taxes in advance, and (especially for cheaper hotels) inconsistent in paying this money to the tax authorities. Ask if there are any hidden extras before booking.\n\n## Budget\nBlue Nile Sailing Club. An alternative to Khartoum's hotels, on the river's southern bank just east of the confluence, the club often accommodates overlanders and accommodates tent camping on its grounds. The club is fenced, monitored, inexpensive and offers expansive river views. It is also home to a river gunboat that once belonged to Horatio Kitchener and now houses the club's offices. (updated Jan 2019)\nKhartoum Youth Hostel, House no 66, Street 47, Khartoum 2,, ☏ +249 183480385 , +249 912500322 (mobile). Opened in 2007 and part of Hostelling International this is the best option for non-camping travellers on a budget. Dorm bed $5.00, double room $10.00.. (updated Jul 2019)\n\n## Mid-range\nDowntown Hotel and Business Center, el jami Ave, 11111, ☏ +249 183742131, reception@dtbusinesshotel.com. Good option for those who like old British city center which turned into multicultural hub of people from all around Africa doing business there. Downtown Hotel is situated in a big 5 store building right next Gold Market, Grand Mosque and major shopping center Waha. It's managed by British, Polish and Sudanese friends. It's still needs some adjustments and work on details, elevator doesn't work and hotel parking is occupied by street vendors but for US$35 it's possible to have very decent, well furnished room with bathroom and big bed for couples. They have coffee&restaurant on the groundfloor with green backyard. There are multiple activities like training and business center, Artists in Residence programs, design studio and other creative units. Double Room US$35, Twin Room US$45. (updated Jan 2011)\n15.57042232.546351 Lisamin Safari Hotel, 41st Amaret. Opened in late 2007, this hotel is a welcome addition to Khartoum’s rather drab hotel stock. Lebanese run, and housing an excellent Lebanese restaurant (The Cedar Tree) this hotel is very Dubai-esque and is certainly worth checking out if your budget can stretch to the room rates. Wireless internet available for a fee. US$144 single, US$156 double, suites from US$168 (inc VAT and tourism tax).

Small 17-room hotel in the Riyadh suburb – the big attraction is the breezy roof terrace where excellent European breakfasts and dinners are served.

A bit of a strange one this – based in an attractive, if slightly kitsch, dry stone palace, the Assaha Village combines a large restaurant, conference facilities and even a ‘museum’ with intimate, Middle Eastern themed bedrooms. Its part of a small chain with sister hotels in Beirut and Doha. Prices, however, are sky-high at SDG 360 for a single room and SDG 480 for a double.\n15.60724932.5162815 Grand Holiday Villa, Nile Street (West of the city center towards the confluence of the Blue and White Nile, along the banks of the Blue Nile), ☏ +249 1 83774039, fax: +249-183-773961, grandholidayvilla@hotmail.com.

(updated Aug 2024)\n\n## Go next\nSabaloga Gorge: This gorge is also known as the 6th Cataract.  It is 80-95 km (50 to 60 miles) north of Khartoum and can be reached in about 2½ hours.  It is essential that a 4-wheel drive vehicle be used, and it is wise, as is true in all cases in traveling outside Khartoum, to travel with at least two vehicles.  On arrival, visitors can stroll around a Sudanese village and inspect Ansar forts that once bombarded steamers on their way to relieve General Gordon.  It is advisable to take this trip in the cooler months.\nJebel Awlia: This dam was completed in 1937 and is 40-50 km (25 to 30 miles) south of Khartoum on the Jebel Awlia road.  A 4-wheel drive vehicle is not required for this trip as the road is paved to the dam.  However, if you intend to cross the dam and travel on the other side, a 4 WD will be needed. The area around the dam itself has a number of large trees and flat grassy land which are ideal for picnics.   For those interested in bird watching, there are numerous birds to be seen, such as pelican, herons, kingfisher, wader, and plovers.  One of the fringe benefits of a trip to Jebel Awlia is a short drive up to the dam.  Here the fishermen sell their catch, which they have just brought in.  The prices are about half of what they might be in Khartoum.  Bring along suitable wrapping and ice and coolers for any fish purchased.\nMeroe: This site is approximately 200 km north of Khartoum.  There is also a hotel in Shendi (very basic) where one could be based.  The trip should be arranged with a tour agency unless someone in the party really knows his/her way around the desert tracks.  There are some paved roads to Meroe but you do have to drive off the main road on to some sandy areas. Four-wheel driver vehicles are a necessity for this trip.  The Pharaonic influence left its imprint in the hieroglyphic language, the religion of Amon, and  building of the pyramids, which were a simplified version of the Egyptian model with no rooms or corridors.  The Greek and Roman architectural influence is evident in the pillars of temples and the classical forms of the statues of men and women.  The Meroe ruins are a four-hour drive from Khartoum.  But there are various other sites in the area, so a two or three day trip should be contemplated, and a knowledgeable guide is essential for the best understanding of the ruins.  National Geographic’s book Splendors of the Past provides excellent background for such a trip.\nDinder National Park: (12°19'N 034°47'E) The Dinder National Park is said to be one of the most unique in the world.  It is totally “unorganized,” and the visitor can truly see game in its natural state.  The site is about 480 km (300 miles) south of Khartoum on the Blue Nile near the Roseires Dam.  Travel by 4-wheel transportation from there to the park is recommended.  Inside the park there is a small tourist area consisting of round, grass thatched huts.  Inside these huts are beds, a chair and a table.  The huts are burned and rebuilt every year after the flood season.  This park is only accessible for a few months of the year from December through May.  It is essential that the visitor traveling to Dinder make thorough preparations for the trip.\nThe Red Sea Area - [Port Sudan]:  The Red Sea is noted for its magnificent under water diving, the clearness of its water and the variety of marine species.  Visitors generally reach the area by flying Sudan Air.  Daily, one hour and a half flights are available, but you may drive on paved road to Port Sudan in about 12–14 hours.  Travelers should be completely self-sufficient with all fuel as well as food and water.  It is about 815 km (510 miles) to Port Sudan.  Visitors may want to stay at the Red Sea Hotel.  This hotel is booked for most of the year, and it is necessary to have reservations confirmed in advance.  The Hilton Hotel has opened in Port Sudan. It is located about half an hour drive from the airport, along the harbor.  Outdoor swimming pool, three restaurants, and a gymnasium, are some of the facilities available.  For more enquiries, call 31139810 or fax 31131183.\nErkowit: This area is 39 km southwest of Port Sudan, and it is the only developed summer resort in Sudan.  The altitude is 1,200 ft (370 m) above sea level.\nJebel Barkal Unesco World Heritage site - [Northern state]:Jebel Barkal or Gebel Barkal (Arabic: جبل بركل) is a very small mountain located some 400 km north of Khartoum, in Karima town in Northern State in Sudan, on a large bend of the Nile River, in the region called Nubia. Around 1450 BC, the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III extended his empire to that region and considered Gebel Barkal its southern limit. There, he campaigned near the city of Napata that, about 300 years later, became the capital of the independent kingdom of Kush. The 25th Dynasty Nubian king Piye later greatly enlarged the New Kingdom Temple of Amun in this city and erected his Year 20 Victory stela within it.\nThe ruins around Gebel Barkal include at least 13 temples and 3 palaces, that were for the first described by European explorers in the 1820s, although only in 1916 were archeological excavations started by George Reisner under a joint expedition of Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston. From the 1970s, explorations continued by a team from the University of Rome La Sapienza, under the direction of Sergio Donadoni, that was joined by another team from the Boston Museum, in the 1980s, under the direction of Timothy Kendall. The larger temples, such that of Amun, are even today considered sacred to the local population.\nFor these reasons, the mountain, together with the historical city of Napata and other ancient sites, were considered by UNESCO, in 2003, World Heritage Sites.\nBuses leave daily from Khartoum to Kerma, however the most comfortable and convenient way of getting there is by car. The route is tarmacked, but you will still require the best part of a day to get there.",
