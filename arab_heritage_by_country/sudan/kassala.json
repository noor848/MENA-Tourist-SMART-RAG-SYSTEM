Built on the banks of the Gash River, it is a market city and is famous for its fruit gardens. Many of its inhabitants are from the Hadendawa sub-tribe of the Beja ethnic group.\nThe city was formerly a railroad hub, however, as of 2006 there was no operational railway station in Kassala and much of the track leading to and from the city has been salvaged or fallen into disrepair. Kassala's location along the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway makes it an important trade center.\n\nHistory\nIn 1834, the Egyptian Army established Kassala as a garrison town following its conquest of Sudan in 1821. When the Mahdist state was established, the Egyptian garrison in Kassala found itself besieged by Mahdist forces. Under the terms of the 1884 Hewett Treaty, Abyssinian forces led by Ras Alula attempted to rescue the Egyptians. Although Ras Alula successfully defeated the Mahdists at the Battle of Kufit, he was unable to breach Kassala’s defenses and liberate the Egyptians. In 1886, after prolonged resistance, the Egyptian garrison finally surrendered to the Mahdists under Osman Digna.\nOn July 17, 1894, Italy annexed Kassala to Italian Eritrea. The Italians fortified the town and brought stability to the region by pacifying the Beja, the dominant local population. However, Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 changed Kassala's fate. Italy was forced to evacuate the town after failing to hold it until the arrival of advancing Anglo-Egyptian forces, who re-occupied Kassala and incorporated it into Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.\nIn the early 1900s, a railway was constructed, first linking Kassala to the Red Sea port of Port Sudan—built in 1906 to replace Suakin—and later, in 1929, extending to Sennar on the southern frontiers of the Gezira Cotton Scheme. When the Anglo-Egyptian forces re-established control over Sudan, Kassala developed into a thriving trade center serving the Ethiopian hinterlands. Horticulture was introduced in the fertile lands near the Gash and Barka rivers, and the British later introduced cotton cultivation. The Kassala Cotton Company, a subsidiary of the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, played a role in these developments.\nIn July 1940, during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced the local British garrison to withdraw from Kassala. The Italians then occupied the city with brigade-sized units: on July 4, 1940 the Italians started their offensive with 2,500 men (and one brigade of cavalry) supported by 24 tanks, while to defend Kassala for Britain there were 1,300 colonial soldiers with their British officers who -after some initial heavy fighting- were easily defeated. The Italians later appointed as mayor of Kassala the future hero of Eritrean independence, Hamid Idris Awate. In mid-January 1941, the Italians withdrew from the city and a British garrison returned.\nIn 2003, Kassala's population was estimated at 530,950 inhabitants. The town is ethnically diverse, comprising groups such as the Beja, Beni-Amer, Amarar, Bishari, Rashaida, and Halanga, as well as significant immigrant communities from northern and western Sudan, including the Fula and Nuba peoples.  The Ethiopian-Eritrean War (1998–2000) displaced an estimated 110,000 Eritreans refugees to the Kassala area, particularly from the border towns of Barentu and Teseney, which were overrun by the Ethiopian Army.\nIn 2025, during the Sudanese civil war (2023-present), Kassala had been involved in conflict for the first time since the war began 2 years ago. The RSF attacked Kassala with drones on 3 May 2025. The attack targeted the fuel storage area at the Kassala Airport. This attack marks the second furthest drone attack by the RSF from controlled areas by the RSF. RSF later attacked Port Sudan.\n\nClimate\nKassala has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) characterized by high temperatures, low precipitation, and abundant sunshine. April through June marks the hottest period of the year, followed by the wet season from July through September, marked by higher humidity levels and intermittent rainfall. The rest of the year is very dry, with nearly no precipitation from November to March.\n\nCurrent status\nThe Kassala region had a child mortality rate of 62 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, slightly higher than the national average of 52 child deaths per 1,000.\nThe Khatmiyya Mosque, built in 1840 by the Egyptians and damaged during the Mahdist War, is the city's most important cultural site.  It is an important site for the Sufi Khatmiyya order.\n\nEducation\nThe city is home to Kassala University, a public university established in 1990 to replace the East University, and an important institution for development in the east of Sudan.\nIncluding Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Faculty of Education,Faculty of Economic and Administration, Faculty of Computer science and IT and more.\n\nNotable people\nBushara Abdel-Nadief (footballer)\nAisha Musa Ahmad (singer)\nHassan Al-Turabi (politician)\nMuhannad El Tahir (footballer)\nNizar Hamid (footballer)\nNoor Uthman Muhammed\n\nSee also\n2007 Sudan floods\nRailway stations in Sudan\nToteil\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nKassala program, Ockenden International",

      "content": "## Overview\nKassala is a city in Kassala State (Wilayat Kassala) in Sudan. It is a market town that is famous for its fruit gardens. Kassala is an important trading centre because it lies on the main highway between Khartoum and Port Sudan.\n\n## Understand\nMany of its inhabitants are from the Hadendawa people.\n\n## Get in\nBuses leave Kassala for Khartoum (7 hours), Gedaref (3 hours) and Port Sudan (7 hours). The better bus companies tend to get booked up early, so if you want a comfortable journey book tickets a few days in advance. Otherwise, turn up at the bus station and take one of the more ramshackle options.\nSmaller buses and minibuses head to destinations around Kassala, like Halfa al-Jadida, Khashm al-Ghirba and Aroma.\nYou need a permit to enter Kassala, and these are checked thoroughly at the entrance to the city, just before arriving at the bus station. You can get a permit from the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs in Khartoum (close to Khartoum University), which can take a couple of hours or several days depending on their mood. If you leave the city on a day trip, you may well have trouble getting back in. As of March 2010, the permit to Kassala can easily be obtained at the Permits Office across from Dandas Hotel (southeast corner of the intersection) with one photo, three copies of your passport and Sudanese Visa, and a form you fill out on location. The whole process is free and takes about 5 minutes.\nTo Eritrea, the border is apparently open, and the place to head for is Souq Tesenei, a small bus station in the 'Aamiriya district.\n\n## Get around\nSouq ash-Sha'abi is Kassala's bus station, just off the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway and quite a distance from the centre of town. Local buses and taxis meet most bus arrivals.\nAl-Mowgif al-'Aam is the central bus station, a large square in the middle of the souqs. Buses a tourist might need to use include Khatmiya (for the old quarter of Khatmiya, Tomb of Seyid Hassan and the cafes on Totil Mountain), Souq ash-Sha'abi (for the inter-city bus station), Banat (for the Gash river and colonial railway quarter), and the lorries to Sawagi Janubiya and Sawagi Shamaliya, the two areas of farmland to the south and north.\n\n## See\nThe souqs are lively and colourful, with many people dressed in clothes unique to their tribe.\nSouq an-Niswaan is the \"women's souq\" where baskets and mats are made, as well as coffee making equipment and incense.\nSouq ar-Rashaida is where the Rashaida tribe gather, selling their bright red and black robes for women and coloured jellabiyas for men.\nKhatmiya is the old part of Kassala, underneath the mountains of Taka, Totil and Aweitila (huge, you can't miss them). The main sight is the tomb of Seyyid Hassan, a local holy man who is buried in a roofless dome next to a semi-ruined mosque. Locals tell you that he is so holy that when it rains, not a drop falls through the hole in the roof. Next to the tomb is a Qur'anic school for boys.\n15.431636.42181 Tomb of Seyyid Hassan.    (updated Jan 2021)\nBehind the tomb, you can climb the slopes of Jebel Totil. On the lower slopes, there are several cafes built into the rock, serving the best coffee in Kassala. There is also the famous well of Totil. If you drink from it, legend has it that you will return to Kassala one day.\nThe Gash River runs through Kassala, but for most of the year it is a dry sandy riverbed, used for football practice in the evenings. In the rainy season, water cascades down from the Eritrean mountains and charges through the city, making the riverbanks a popular place to walk in the evenings. However, the Gash is a dangerous river, having flooded in 2007 and 2003, causing huge amounts of damage to the whole city.\nOn the other side of the Gash, you reach an area called Sikka Hadiid, which is the old railway quarter. The original railway station still stands, all impressive and colonial but abandoned now. Around this are British built round brick huts, which used to house railway workers and is now a popular place for students to live.\nTo the south, the Sawagi Janubiyya (southern gardens) is a collection of villages surrounded by mango and guava orchards alongside the Gash.\n\n## Do\n15.411736.42631 Taka Mountains Nature Preserve. Dramatic mountains just south of Kassala- Climbing is popular but to reach the summit, you need special equipment. However, climbing half way is possible in about one hour and offers amazing views.    (updated Jan 2021)\nDrink coffee at one of Kassala's hundreds of tea stalls or at a cafe on Totil mountain.\nTake a walk through Sawagi Janubiyya. Cross the Gash bridge and take the road to your left which leads you through the Sawagi villages. After five kilometres or so, you can get alongside the Gash, and if it is dry, you can cross over to the mountains and Khatmiya.\nJabal Kasala is a mountain that rises 748 m2 (8,050 ft²) above the surrounding area with small summit area, steep slopes and local relief of 300 m.\n\n## Buy\nKassala is famous for its coffee, which is traditionally served in a clay coffee pot called a jebbana. These are sold quite cheaply in Souq an-Niswan, along with wooden mortar and pestles for grinding the beans and ginger, roasting trays, jebbana stands and tiny coffee cups.\n\n## Eat\nFuul (mashed fava beans) is the main dish found in Kassala, and there are lots of fuul stalls around. The best ones are between the Souq an-Niswaan and Hotel Hipton, where the fuul is mixed with ta'amiya, cheese, tuna or egg, and topped with sesame oil, garlic and a herb called shumaar.\nAt-Tabaq as-Souri on the main square is a good place for sandwiches and shawarma. They also serve baklava and other sweets, and is one of the only cafes in Kassala where local women eat.\nFor more local dishes, like tagaliya and bamiya (both gloopy okra-based sauces) served with ghuraasa (a spongy pancake type bread) or kisra (very thin, slightly sour bread), and various bits of meat (ask for shiyya if you aren't keen on offal), try some of the restaurants in the middle of the souq.\nOn the road to Khatmiya, the bus passes a livestock market opposite a large cemetery. Here, there are stalls selling sheep, which are slaughtered to order and cooked in the restaurant next door.\n\n## Drink\nKassala is famous for its coffee (jebbana), spiced with ginger (zinjabil) and cinnamon (girfa') and served in a clay coffee pot, with incense and popcorn on the side. The best place for the full treatment is at one of the cafes on the slopes of Totil mountain. Otherwise, Kassala is full of tea stalls, where coffee is served in smaller coffee pots made from recycled Pif-Paf cans.\njebbana - coffee.\nbi dawa thagiil - with lots of ginger and cinnamon.\nbi dawa khafiif - with a little ginger.\nsaliiga - without ginger.\nshay - tea.\nshay kerkedeh - pink hibiscus tea.\nshay bi laban - tea with hot milk.\nfawgu jumaada - with lumpy bits of milk (some people do ask for it!).\nshay faransi - literally \"French tea\", this is actually coffee with milk.\nFruit juices are excellent in Kassala, and made fresh at many stalls in the souq, so you can ask for one without sugar. Mango and guava are the best, but orange tends to be diluted with a lot of water and mixed with bucketloads of sugar, so avoid it. Local juices include aradeeb (a brown tangy juice, similar to tamarind) and sha'iir (made from a white powder and a bit like cold malted milk).\n15.4521136.397861 Riyad hotel, ☏ +249 0914937704.    (updated Dec 2022)\n\n## Sleep\nTwo of the best hotels in Kassala are the Telal ash-Sharg and the Hipton. Others include the Safa, Bashir, Totil and Medina. They are all located in the streets behind the Mowgif al-'Aam bus station. Some foreigners don't get a choice where they stay, as the security police will escort them to a particular place, usually one of the ones mentioned above. Cheaper places like the Hotel Africa and the many basic lakondas (courtyards filled with beds) sometimes won't accept foreigners.\n15.45196236.401151 Hipton Hotel, ☏ +249 411822357.
