      "content": "Nuri is a place in modern Sudan on the west side of the Nile, near the Fourth Cataract. Nuri is situated about 15 km north of Sanam, and 10 km from Jebel Barkal.\n\nHistory\nNuri is the second of three Napatan burial sites and the construction of pyramids at Nuri began when there was no longer enough space at El-Kurru. More than 20 ancient pyramids belonging to Nubian kings and queens are still standing at Nuri, which served as a royal necropolis for the ancient city of Napata, the first capital of the Nubian Kingdom of Kush. It is probable that, at its apex, 80 or more pyramids stood at Nuri, marking the tombs of royals. The pyramids at Nuri were built over a period of more than three centuries, from circa 670 BCE for the oldest (pyramid of Taharqa), to around 310 BCE (pyramid of king Nastasen).  \n\nThe earliest known pyramid (Nu. 1) at Nuri belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 meters square by 40 or by 50 metres high. The pyramid of Taharqa was situated so that when observed from Jebel Barkal at sunrise on Egyptian New Year's Day, the beginning of the annual flooding of the Nile, the sun would rise from the horizon directly over its point.\nTantamani, successor of Taharqa, was buried at el-Kurru, but all following Napatan kings and many of their queens and children until Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 315 BC) were buried here, some 80 royals. The pyramids at Nuri are, in general, smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily degraded (caused by both humans and nature), but often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built at least in part from reused pyramid stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramid chapels.\nThe pyramids were partially excavated by George Reisner in the early 20th century. In 2018, a new archaeological expedition began work at the site, directed by Pearce Paul Creasman.\nThe pyramids of Nuri, together with other buildings in the region around Gebel Barkal, have been placed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 2003.\n\nTombs at Nuri\nSee List of monarchs of Kush for more information.\n\nThe royal family of Kush was buried in the cemeteries of Nuri and el-Kurru.\nThe King's Mothers were buried in the southern group, but this is not an area exclusively used for the burial of King's Mothers. Most of the King's Wives were buried in the parallel rows just north of Taharqa's tomb. The tombs to the far north were much smaller and may have been built for wives of lesser rank. It was also found by Dows Dunham, an experienced archaeologist, that there were references to two other kings in three of the pyramids including King Taharqa. But, if they are buried there, their tombs have yet to be located and excavated.\n\n Nuri 1 – King Taharqa, the earliest and largest of the Nuri pyramids\n Nuri 2 – King Amaniastabarqa\n Nuri 3 – King Senkamanisken\n Nuri 4 – King Siaspiqa\n Nuri 5 – King Malonaqen\n  Nuri 6 – King Anlamani, son of King Senkamanisken\n Nuri 7 – King Karkamani\n Nuri 8 – King Aspelta, son of King Senkamanisken and Queen Naparaye\n Nuri 9 – King Aramatle-qo, son of Aspelta\nNuri 10 – King Amaninatakilebte\n Nuri 11 – King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 12 – King Amanineteyerike, son of King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 13 – King Harsiotef\n Nuri 14 – King Akhraten\n Nuri 15 – King Nastasen\n Nuri 16 – King Talakhamani\n Nuri 17 – King Baskakeren, son of King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 18 – King Analmaye\n Nuri 19 – King Nasakhma\n Nuri 20 – King Atlanersa, Son of Taharqa\nNuri 21 – Possibly Takahatenamun, Queen.

It is noted that looting was present in all of the pyramids as they were accessible by digging a hole through the ground. Based on objects found within and around the tombs, it is likely that these looters came hundreds of years later. Of what remained, several fragments and completed Napatan red ware pottery were found within several tombs.\n\nSee also\nNubian pyramids\nPyramids at El-Kurru\nPyramids of Jebel Barkal\nPyramids of Meroë\nSedeinga pyramids\n\nReferences\nLiterature\nDows Dunham.
