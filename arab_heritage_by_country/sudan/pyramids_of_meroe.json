      "content": "The Pyramids of Meroë are a large number of Nubian pyramids, encompassing three cemeteries near the ancient city of Meroë. The Meroë pyramids date to the later stage of the Kingdom of Kush (3rd century BCE–4th century CE) and were burial places for Kushite monarchs, other members of the royal family, and important officials and dignitaries.\nThe three cemeteries collectively encompass over a thousand graves, out of which at least 147 were pyramids. The majority of the pyramids (at least 82) are from the southern cemetery and were not burials of royals.\nOn 8 September 2020, the pyramids were threatened for the first time by floods.\n\nPyramids and burials\nSecurely identified pyramids are marked with bold text.\n\nSouthern cemetery\nThe southern cemetery was used for royal Kushite burials for the first two or three generations in the Meroitic period (270 BCE onwards). The southern cemetery includes c. 220 burials, at least 90 of which had superstructures. Of these 90, at least 24 were pyramids. The tombs in this cemetery have been heavily pillaged.\n\nBeg.

The western cemetery contains no burials of monarchs and was instead used by non-royal elites. There are over 800 graves in the western cemetery, out of which at least 82 were pyramids.\n\nBeg.
