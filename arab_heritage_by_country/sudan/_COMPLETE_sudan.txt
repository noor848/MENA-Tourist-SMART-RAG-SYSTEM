Meroë (; also spelled Meroe; Meroitic: 𐦨𐦡𐦷𐦡𐦥𐦢, romanized: Medewi; Arabic: مرواه, romanized: Meruwah and مروي, Meruwi; Ancient Greek: Μερόη, romanized: Meróē) was an ancient city on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km north-east of the Kabushiya station near Shendi, Sudan, approximately 200 km north-east of Khartoum. Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah (Arabic: البجراوية). This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC, until its collapse in the 4th century AD. The Kushitic Kingdom of Meroë gave its name to the "Island of Meroë", which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah and the Blue Nile.
The city of Meroë was on the edge of Butana. There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana: Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. The first of these sites was given the name Meroë by the Persian king Cambyses, in honor of his sister who was called by that name. The city had originally borne the ancient appellation Saba, named after the country's original founder. The eponym Saba, or Seba, is named for one of the sons of Cush (see Genesis 10:7). The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.
The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Meroë represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It was one of the earliest and most advanced states found on the African continent. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, one's understanding of Meroë in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.
The site of the city of Meroë is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups, of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids.

History
Meroë was the southern capital of the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush spanned the period c. 800 BC – c. 350 AD. Initially, its main capital was farther north at Napata. King Aspelta moved the capital to Meroë, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly c. 591 BC, just after the sack of Napata by Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II.
Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Meroë was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people. According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, Meroitic "d" was transcribed in foreign languages as "r", with the native name of the city being Medewi.

First Meroitic Period (542–315 BC)
The Kings ruled over Napata and Meroë. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Meroë. The Main temple of Amun was located in Napata. Kings and many queens are buried in Nuri, some queens are buried in Meroë, in the West Cemetery. The earliest king was Analmaye (542–538 BC) and the last king of the first phase is Nastasen (335–315 BC)
In the fifth century BC, Greek historian Herodotus described it as "a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians."
Excavations revealed evidence of important, high ranking Kushite burials from the Napatan Period (c. 800 – c. 280 BC) in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western Cemetery. The importance of the town gradually increased from the beginning of the Meroitic Period, especially from the reign of Arakamani (c. 280 BC) when the royal burial ground was transferred to Meroë from Napata (Gebel Barkal). Royal burials formed the Pyramids of Meroë, containing the remains of the Kings and Queens of Meroë from c. 300 BC to about 350 AD.

Second Meroitic Period (3rd century BC)
The seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings and many queens are buried in Meroë, in the South Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. The first King of the period was Aktisanes (Early 3rd century BC) and the last king of the period was Sabrakamani (first half 3rd century BC).

Third Meroitic Period (270 BC – 1st century AD)
The seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings are buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. Meroë flourished and many building projects were undertaken. The first king of the period is Arakamani (270–260 BC), the last ruler is Queen Amanitore (mid/late 1st century AD)
Many artifacts were found in Meroitic tombs from around this time.

Conflict with Rome
Rome's conquest of Egypt led to border skirmishes and incursions by Meroë beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BC, in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, the Roman governor of Egypt, Publius Petronius, invaded Nubia to end the Meroitic raids. He pillaged northern Nubia and sacked Napata (22 BC) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed some of the statues, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BC between Rome and Meroë under Augustus and Amanirenas, respectively. One looted head, from a statue of the emperor Augustus, was buried under the steps of a temple in Meroë; it is now kept in the British Museum.

The next recorded contact between Rome and Meroë was in the autumn of 61 AD. The Emperor Nero sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country, who reached the city of Meroë where they were given an escort, then proceeded up the White Nile until they encountered the swamps of the Sudd. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa.
The period following Petronius' punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Meroë. L. P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country. The kingdom of Meroë began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.
Meroë is mentioned briefly in the 1st century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea:

2. On the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the Berbers. Along the shore are the Fish-Eaters, living in scattered caves in the narrow valleys. Farther inland are the Berbers, and beyond them the Wild-flesh-Eaters and Calf-Eaters, each tribe governed by its chief; and behind them, farther inland, in the country towards the west, there lies a city called Meroe.

Fourth Meroitic Period (1st century – 4th century AD)
Kings were buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. In 350 AD Meroë was destroyed by Axum. The first king of the fourth period was Shorkaror (1st century AD), while the last rulers may have been King Yesebokheamani or King Talakhidamani in the 4th century AD. The Aksumite presence was short lived before Meroë was taken by the Kingdom of Alodia.
A stele of Ge'ez of an unnamed ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum thought to be Ezana was found at the site of Meroë; from its description, in Greek, he was "King of the Aksumites and the Omerites," (i.e. of Aksum and Himyar) it is likely this king ruled sometime around 330. Another inscription in Greek gives the regnal claims of Ezana:

I, Ezana, King of the Axumites and Himyarites and of Reeidan and of the Sabaites and of Sileel (?) and of Hasa and of the Bougaites and of Taimo...
While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Axumites destroyed the Kingdom of Kush, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300.

Meroë in Jewish legend
Jewish oral tradition avers that Moses, in his younger years, had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan (Kush), as far as the city of Meroë, which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall, and governed by a renegade king. To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country, Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge, each containing an ibis, only to be released when they approached the enemy's country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country. Having successfully laid siege to the city, the city was eventually subdued by the betrayal of the king's daughter, who had agreed to deliver the city to Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her, under the solemn assurance of an oath.

Civilization
Meroë was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong iron industry. Metalworking is believed to have taken place in Meroë, possibly through bloomeries and blast furnaces. Archibald Sayce reportedly referred to it as "the Birmingham of Africa", because of perceived vast production and trade of iron (a contention that is a matter of debate in modern scholarship).
The centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannah-oriented forms of subsistence.
At the time, iron was one of the most important metals worldwide, and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Meroë traded ivory, slaves, rare skins, ostrich feathers, copper, and ebony.  Meroë also exported textiles and jewelry. Their textiles were based on cotton and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BC. Furthermore, Nubia was very rich in gold. It is possible that the Egyptian word for gold, nub, was the source of name of Nubia. Trade in "exotic" animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy.
Apart from the iron trade, pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Meroë kingdom. The production of fine and elaborately decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle Nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory.
The sakia, was used to move water, in conjunction with irrigation, to increase crop production.
At its peak, the rulers of Meroë controlled the Nile Valley north to south, over a straight-line distance of more than 1,000 km (620 mi).
The King of Meroë was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother, or Kandake. However, the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of treasurers, seal bearers, heads of archives and chief scribes, among others.
Although the people of Meroë also had southern deities such as Apedemak, the lion-son of Sekhmet (or Bast, depending upon the region), they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were Amun, Tefnut, Horus, Isis, Thoth and Satis, though to a lesser extent.
The collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.

Language
The Meroitic language was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct around 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180 and 170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.
By the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs, used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (c. 700 – 300 BC), and first appears in the 2nd century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.
It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she proposes, are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Claude Rilly, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, proposes that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, instead belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.

Archaeology
The site of Meroë was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist Frédéric Cailliaud (1787–1869), who published an illustrated in-folio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription.
As Margoliouth notes in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, small scale excavations occurred in 1834, led by Giuseppe Ferlini, who, as Margoliouth states, "discovered (or professed to discover) various antiquities, chiefly in the form of jewelry, now in the museums of Berlin and Munich." Margoliouth continues,

The ruins were examined in 1844 by C. R. Lepsius, who brought many plans, sketches and copies, besides actual antiquities, to Berlin. Further excavations were carried on by E. A. Wallis Budge in the years 1902 and 1905, the results of which are recorded in his work, The Egyptian Sudan: its History and Monuments… Troops were furnished by Sir Reginald Wingate, governor of the Sudan, who made paths to and between the pyramids, and sank shafts, &c. It was found that the pyramids were regularly built over sepulchral chambers, containing the remains of bodies either burned or buried without being mummified. The most interesting objects found were the reliefs on the chapel walls, already described by Lepsius, and containing the names with representations of queens and some kings, with some chapters of the Book of the Dead; some steles with inscriptions in the Meroitic language, and some vessels of metal and earthenware. The best of the reliefs were taken down stone by stone in 1905, and set up partly in the British Museum and partly in the museum at Khartoum. In 1910, in consequence of a report by Professor Archibald Sayce, excavations were commenced in the mounds of the town and the necropolis by J[ohn] Garstang on behalf of the University of Liverpool, and the ruins of a palace and several temples were discovered, built by the Meroite kings.

World Heritage listing
In June 2011, the Archeological Sites of Meroë were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.
During the Sudanese civil war (2023–present) on 14 January 2024, the Sudanese Armed Forces launched airstrikes in the ancient Meroitic sites of Naqa and Musawwarat es-Sufra, which are both designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, following incursions there by the Rapid Support Forces.

Méroé est une cité antique de Nubie, capitale du royaume de Koush qui marque le début de l'ère méroïtique et correspond également à la dernière phase de ce royaume. Elle est connue pour ses nécropoles à pyramides à forte pente relativement bien conservées. Le site est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 2003.
Cette cité a formé la capitale du royaume de Koush pendant plusieurs siècles. Le royaume koush de Méroé, qui a donné son nom à l'île de Méroé, fait aujourd'hui partie du Soudan moderne, une région limitée par le Nil (de la rivière Atbara à Khartoum), la rivière Atbara et le Nil Bleu.

Contexte historique
Un État, indépendant de sa puissante voisine l'Égypte, s'était développé de -2500 à -1500 dans la zone de l'actuel Soudan. Sa capitale était Kerma. Après une phase de conquête, Kerma fut vaincue et la Nubie intégrée pendant cinq siècles au territoire égyptien. Il faut alors attendre le VIIIe siècle avant notre ère pour voir un nouveau pouvoir royal indépendant émerger en Nubie, autour de la nouvelle capitale Napata. Cette période est notamment restée célèbre en raison d'un court épisode de domination de l'Égypte par le royaume de Koush durant la XXVe dynastie. Défaits par les Assyriens, les Nubiens refluèrent ensuite vers le sud, la capitale se déplaçant à Méroé au Ve siècle avant notre ère.

Le site de Méroé
Située en aval de la sixième cataracte du Nil en Nubie, cette cité donne son nom à une brillante civilisation qui se développe depuis la première cataracte jusqu’au confluent des deux Nil et sans doute plus au sud, entre le IVe siècle avant et le IVe siècle de notre ère. Influencée par ses voisins, surtout l’Égypte lagide des Ptolémées puis l'Égypte romaine, mais aussi le Proche-Orient et la Perse, elle connaît un âge d’or au Ier siècle avant notre ère.
C'est sous le règne de Néron, en 61/63, qu'une expédition romaine achève la reconnaissance de la route entre Syène (Assouan) et Méroé.
La nécropole royale est découverte par les explorateurs français Frédéric Cailliaud, Pierre-Constant Letorzec et Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds en 1822.
Le site de Méroé est très étendu et les fouilles n’ont qu’à peine effleuré les vestiges. Il se compose d'au moins quatre lieux différents. Le premier est une zone urbaine étendue dans dans laquelle des palais, des ateliers et des sanctuaires ont été dégagés, dont un sanctuaire de l'eau remarquable, précédemment identifié comme des « bains royaux ». Plus à l'est, les trois nécropoles de Begrawiyah Ouest, Sud et Nord comptent environ deux cents pyramides au total. 
Loin vers l’est, fermant cette immense plaine, les pyramides royales construites au sommet de deux petites collines étaient encore quasi intactes en 1834. Cette année-là, Giuseppe Ferlini, un aventurier italien, médecin militaire au service de l'armée de Méhémet Ali, découvre un trésor dans la sépulture de la reine Amanishakhéto en se servant des dessins et plans de Cailliaud. Pour y parvenir, Ferlini ordonne le démantèlement de la pyramide, la transformant en un amas de pierre. Les bijoux de la reine sont actuellement exposés à Munich et à Berlin (Ägyptisches Museum).
La connaissance du Méroïtique restant parcellaire, les rois et reines qui se succèdent ne sont souvent pour nous qu’un nom sur une table d’offrandes funéraires ou le décor d’une pyramide.
Plusieurs femmes accèdent au pouvoir sous le titre de candace. En -33, la candace Amanishakhéto refuse de se soumettre aux Romains. Le royaume vit encore deux cents ans, avant de s'éteindre pour des raisons encore mal connues.
Vers 350, Ezana, le roi d’Aksoum, affirme sur deux stèles qu’il a combattu victorieusement les Noba (Nubiens), traversant l’ancien territoire des Kasou (Koushites). On en a conclu qu’à cette époque, le royaume de Méroé avait succombé sous les coups des Éthiopiens.

## Overview
Meroë is an ancient city along the eastern bank of the Nile River in Northern Sudan, approximately 200 km (120 mi) northeast of Khartoum. The site is home to more than 200 Nubian pyramids in three separate groups.

## Understand
This was the heartland of the Kingdom of Kush, a major power from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Their vast empire extended from the Mediterranean to the heart of Africa. This area contains the royal city of the kings and the nearby religious site of Naqa and Musawwarat es Sufra.
In 2024, UNESCO issued a plea to protect the area from the country's civil unrest. High risks of looting and illicit trafficking of property are present because of the reduced security of the site. Additionally UNESCO does not want the militaries to use the site or to target the site.

## By road
Meroë is readily reached from Khartoum by road. All buses from Khartoum-Atbara and Shendi-Atbara will pass the pyramids and they're not hard to miss. Just ask to get off at Bajarawiya (small town adjacent to Meroë).

## By air
The nearest airport is in Shendi, roughly 45 km (30 mi) to the southwest. Shendi airport has no regular, commercial flights but charter flights may be organized to this airport from Khartoum. But since Meroë is easy to reach from Khartoum by road, this option is mainly for persons will little time and/or deep pockets. If you are paying for a charter flight, you should ask the pilot to fly over Meroë, providing scenic aerial views which may justify the expense.

## Get around
The best way to get around in Meroe (and most of Africa) is by car. The best way to get there is to fly to Khartoum and drive to Meroe.

## See
The most popular (and best probably) thing to see in Meroe is the pyramids of Meroe.
There are three parts to the Pyramids of Meroe.
1. The south cemetery features nine royal pyramids. Four of the pyramids belonged to kings and five belonged to queens. One hundred and ninety-five other tombs complete the cemetery.
2. The north cemetery contains forty-one royal pyramids. Thirty belonged to kings, six to queens and five to other royals. The cemetery has three more non-royal tombs for a total of forty-four.
3. The west cemetery is a non-royal site. It contains some one hundred and thirteen tombs.

## Sleep
16.9470233.768381 Meroe Tented Camp, ☏ +249 011 487961. The only lodging option near Meroë, with a spectacular location to watch sunset over the pyramids. The camp is comfortable, but utilitarian... these are tents after all. Each tent has electricity, a private veranda (for views of the pyramids at sunrise/sunset!), beds and a few furnishings. Toilets are in a concrete building behind the tents with one toilet assigned to each tent. Showers have cold water only. Food is available... mostly Italian cuisine thanks to its Italian owners. Locals occasionally stop by to offer crafts and camel rides. US$95/120.
If you have your own tent & supplies, camping is permitted in the desert except within 100 m (300 ft) of any of the pyramids. It may be possible to find accommodation in one of the few tiny villages near the site, collectively called Bagrawiyah.

The Pyramids of Meroë are a large number of Nubian pyramids, encompassing three cemeteries near the ancient city of Meroë. The Meroë pyramids date to the later stage of the Kingdom of Kush (3rd century BCE–4th century CE) and were burial places for Kushite monarchs, other members of the royal family, and important officials and dignitaries.
The three cemeteries collectively encompass over a thousand graves, out of which at least 147 were pyramids. The majority of the pyramids (at least 82) are from the southern cemetery and were not burials of royals.
On 8 September 2020, the pyramids were threatened for the first time by floods.

Pyramids and burials
Securely identified pyramids are marked with bold text.

Southern cemetery
The southern cemetery was used for royal Kushite burials for the first two or three generations in the Meroitic period (270 BCE onwards). The southern cemetery includes c. 220 burials, at least 90 of which had superstructures. Of these 90, at least 24 were pyramids. The tombs in this cemetery have been heavily pillaged.

Beg. S 4 – Queen (non-ruling) Kanarta
Beg. S 5 – King Amanislo
Beg. S 6 – King Arakamani
Beg. S 10 – Queen (non-ruling) Bartare (a.k.a. Karatari)
Beg. S 503 – Queen (non-ruling) Khennuwa

Northern cemetery
After briefly using the southern cemetery, the northern cemetery became the main site for royal burials. The northern cemetery contains 41 known pyramids, from 30 kings, eight queens regnant, and three other individuals (crown princes?).

Treasures and artifacts of the North Cemetery
Numerous treasures were discovered in the pyramids since the 19th century.

Western cemetery
The western cemetery saw the longest continuous use, with burials dating back to the 9th century BCE. The western cemetery contains no burials of monarchs and was instead used by non-royal elites. There are over 800 graves in the western cemetery, out of which at least 82 were pyramids.

Jebel Barkal or Gebel Barkal (Arabic: جبل بركل, romanized: Jabal Barkal) is a mesa or large rock outcrop located 400 km north of Khartoum, next to Karima in Northern State in Sudan, on the Nile River, in the region that is sometimes called Nubia. The jebel is 104 m tall, has a flat top, and came to have religious significance for both ancient Kush and ancient Egyptian occupiers. In 2003, the mountain, together with the extensive archaeological site at its base (ancient Napata), were named as the center of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Jebel Barkal area houses the Jebel Barkal Museum.

History
The earliest occupation of Jebel Barkal was that of the Kerma culture, which was also known as Kush, but this occupation is so far known only from scattered potsherds.
Around 1450 BCE, the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III conquered Barkal and built a fortified settlement (Egyptian menenu) there as the southern limit of the Egyptian empire. The city and region around it came to be called Napata, and the Egyptian occupation of Jebel Barkal extended through most of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Egyptians built a complex of temples at the site, centered on a temple to Amun of Napata—a local, ram-headed form of the main god of the Egyptian capital city of Thebes, Egypt. In the last years of the New Kingdom and after its collapse in 1169 BC, there was little construction at Jebel Barkal. Apart from the temples, no trace of this Egyptian settlement has yet been found at the site.

Jebel Barkal was the capital city of the Kingdom of Kush as it returned to power in the years after 800 BCE as the Dynasty of Napata. The Kushite kings who conquered and ruled over Egypt as the 25th Dynasty, including Kashta, Piankhy (or Piye), and Taharqa, all built, renovated, and expanded monumental structures at the site.
After the Kushites were driven out by the Assyrian conquest of Egypt in the mid-7th century BC, they continued to rule Kush with Jebel Barkal and the city of Meroë as the most important urban centers of Kush. Jebel Barkal's palaces and temples continued to be renovated from the 7th-early 3rd centuries BC. Most of the royal pyramid burials of the kings and queens of Kush during this time were built at the site of Nuri, 9 km to the northeast of Jebel Barkal.
In 270 BCE, the location of Kushite royal burials was moved to Meroë, inaugurating the Meroitic period of the Kingdom of Kush. Jebel Barkal continued to be an important city of Kush during the Meroitic period. A sequence of palaces were built, most notably by King Natakamani, new temples were built and older temples were renovated. During the 1st century BC - 1st century AD, eight royal pyramid burials were built at Jebel Barkal (rather than at Meroë), for reasons that are not clear, but perhaps reflecting the prominence of one or more families from the city.
After the collapse of Kush during the 4th century AD, Jebel Barkal continued to be occupied in the medieval (Christian) period of Nubia, as attested by architectural remains, burials, and burial inscriptions.

Temples
The ruins around Jebel Barkal include at least 13 temples that were built, renovated, and expanded over a period of over 1,500 years. The temples were described for the first time by a series of European explorers beginning in the 1820s. Their drawings and descriptions, particularly those of Frédéric Cailliaud (1821), Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds (1821), and Karl Richard Lepsius (1844), record significant architectural details that have since disappeared. In 1862 five inscriptions from the Third Intermediate Period were recovered by an Egyptian officer and transported to the Cairo Museum, but not until 1916 were scientific archeological excavations performed by a joint expedition of Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston under the direction of George Reisner. From the 1970s, explorations continued by a team from the University of Rome La Sapienza, under the direction of Sergio Donadoni, that was joined by another team from the Boston Museum, in the 1980s, under the direction of Timothy Kendall.

Temple of Amun and Temple of Mut
The larger temples, such as the Temple of Amun, are even today considered sacred to the local population. The carved wall painted chambers of the Temple of Mut are well preserved.

Temple B700 at Jebel Barkal
Temple B700, built by Atlanersa and decorated by Senkamanisken, is now largely destroyed. It received the sacred bark of Amun from the nearby B500 on certain cultic occasions, and may have served during the coronation of the kings of the early Napatan period, in the mid 7th century BC. The Temple was decorated by Senkamanisken, where he is shown clubbing enemies.
The hieroglyphic inscription on the Temple described the role of the god Amun in selecting Senkamanisken as king:

I said of you [while you were still] in your mother's womb that you were to be ruler of Kemet ["Black Land", probably meaning Egypt and Kush]. I knew you in the semen, while you were in the egg, that you were to be lord. I made you receive the Great Crown, which Re caused to appear on the first good occasion. [Inasmuch as] a father makes his son excellent, it is I who decreed kingship to you. [So] who shall share it with you? For I am the Lord of Heaven. As I give to Re, [so] he gives to his children, from gods to men. It is I who gives you the royal charter.... No other [can] decree (who is to be) king. It is I who grants kingship to whomever I will.

Pyramids
Jebel Barkal served as a royal cemetery during the Meroitic Kingdom. The earliest burials date back to the 3rd century BC.

History of Excavation of the Site
Napata’s urban remains have not yet been significantly excavated, but rubble heaps indicate that the area was probably home to major settlement in antiquity. There are no traces of a pre-Egyptian settlement, though this may change as more is uncovered at the site. The earliest buildings found at Napata date from the middle of the eighteenth Dynasty. The first archaeologist to work at the site was George A. Reisner who worked there from 1916-1920 and excavated a number of buildings. His first excavation at Napata was a large Meroitic structure (Named “B 100”) that dated to the first century CE. At first, Reisner assumed this to be an “administrative building”, though it is now known to have been a palace.

Le Gebel Barkal (ou Djebel Barkal) est le promontoire rocheux qui domine le site de Napata (Soudan), site d'un temple d'Amon célèbre et capitale du royaume de Koush à dater de la XXVe dynastie égyptienne.
Les Égyptiens le nommaient la « montagne Pure » et le considéraient comme le lieu où résidait le dieu Amon. De fait, dès Thoutmôsis III, le site est attesté et ne cessera de se développer alors.

La montagne Pure
D'une altitude peu élevée ce mont semble surgir du plateau désertique pour former une haute falaise devant laquelle un piton rocheux se dresse comme s’il avait été détaché de la masse principale.
On a longtemps ignoré cet aspect particulier de la montagne dans le choix du site par les anciens Égyptiens jusqu'à ce qu'un rapprochement de certaines représentations retrouvées dans d'anciens temples éclaire ce point. En effet, on peut voir sur un relief du temple de Ramsès II à Abou Simbel ainsi que sur un relief du temple de Mout de Napata, le dieu Amon figuré assis sous une sorte de dais devant lequel se dresse un uræus colossal.
Ce rapprochement entre ces représentations uniques en leur genre et le Gebel Barkal est alors plus net aux yeux des égyptologues qui déjà avaient remarqué la propension singulière des anciens Égyptiens à être fascinés par les formations rocheuses. L'hypothèse d'un tel choix concerne la Cime Thébaine qui domine les nécropoles de l'antique capitale dynastique du Nouvel Empire et dont la forme pyramidale n'échappe à personne et n'est contestée nulle part, bien qu'aucune intervention humaine sur cette formation ne soit venue confirmer la théorie.
À Napata, le Gebel Barkal et son piton rocheux seraient donc apparus aux yeux des anciens prêtres de la même manière comme une manifestation de la divinité, et il est vrai que sous certains angles cette aiguille de roche ressemble à un cobra couronné soit d'un disque solaire soit de la couronne blanche, la « hedjet ».
Restait à vérifier l'hypothèse sur place. Les équipes archéologiques ont alors gravi la falaise et son piton et découvert qu'à son sommet les anciens étaient en effet intervenus. Ils avaient taillé dans la roche une stèle monumentale aux noms de Thoutmôsis III et de Taharqa que Nastasen restaura sous son règne. La présence de petites cavités sur l'ensemble de l'encadrement de la stèle dont certaines encore munies de tenons en bronze atteste pour le reste qu'une feuille d'or y était fixée.
Ainsi chaque matin, l'ensemble étant orienté vers le sud, les premiers rayons du soleil frappaient la stèle dorée et l'éclat du Gebel Barkal devait être visible toute la journée à des kilomètres à la ronde tel un phare diurne au milieu de la vallée du Nil.
Le Gebel Barkal était donc bien une manifestation tangible du dieu Amon pour les anciens Égyptiens et Nubiens et devait exercer sur eux une certaine fascination.

Le temple d'Amon de Napata
Dès Thoutmôsis III, un petit temple est bâti au pied de la montagne en l'honneur de l'Amon local qui sans doute intégra par syncrétisme une ancienne divinité nubienne représentée sous la forme d'un bélier. Ce sanctuaire sera par la suite agrandi par les Ramsès puis ne cessera d'être embelli au fur et à mesure que le culte du dieu grandissait, chaque souverain, notamment de la XXVe dynastie, souhaitant laisser sa marque dans l'édification du temple du dieu dynastique. En cela, le développement du site est comparable à celui du temple d'Amon-Rê de Karnak même si les proportions de l'ensemble restent plus modestes.

Le temple se développe sur un axe est-ouest idéal et au dernier stade de son évolution mesurait près de cent cinquante mètres de longueur pour une largeur de plus de quarante en façade. Celle-ci était marquée par un premier pylône d'architecture égyptienne alignant ses deux môles massifs autrefois ornés de mats à oriflammes. Suivait une première cour péristyle sur ses quatre côtés qui donnait sur un second pylône de proportion analogue au premier et à la même ornementation. Ce dernier ouvrait sur une seconde cour munie en son centre d'une chapelle reposoir pour la barque divine et protégée par un vaste kiosque soutenu par quatre rangées de sept colonnes, conférant à l'ensemble un aspect hypostyle. Suivait précisément une salle hypostyle ouverte sur la seconde cour à l'instar de celle du temple de Louxor et comportant elle dix-huit colonnes papyriformes.
Par un troisième pylône qui remonte à la période du Nouvel Empire, le sanctuaire proprement dit commençait. Remontant à une haute époque, il subit de nombreuses modifications notamment à la suite des adjonctions des pharaons kouchites. Dans ce qui devait être la cour du temple initial fondé à la XVIIIe dynastie ils rajoutèrent notamment dix colonnes supportant un toit la transformant ainsi en une salle plongée dans la pénombre comme il sied à l'approche d'un lieu saint. Cette salle ouvrait au nord sur une chapelle secondaire et par l'ouest au travers d'un quatrième pylône sur une seconde salle à colonnes comportant une chapelle pour la barque divine en son centre et distribuant le naos principal placé dans l'axe du temple et des sanctuaires secondaires de part et d'autre.
Le temple fut également doté d'un dromos constitué de criosphinx dont certains exemplaires furent prélevés sur le site du temple d'Amenhotep III à Soleb. De même, deux lions couchés d'une facture remarquable et remontant à la même époque encadraient le pylône du temple. D'autres sculptures prestigieuses ornaient ce sanctuaire dont une série de colosses à l'image des souverains de Koush que les armées de Psammétique II firent tomber et martelèrent lors de leur razzia sur Napata au VIIe siècle avant notre ère.
La comparaison avec l'exemple thébain ne s'arrête pas là. Un peu plus au sud, Taharqa fit bâtir ou restaurer en l'honneur de Mout un sanctuaire semi-rupestre qu'il dota d'une salle soutenue par des colonnes aux chapiteaux hathoriques ainsi que de deux pylônes encadrant une cour. Le sanctuaire qui s'enfonçait dans la roche comportait de plus une série de piliers décorés de grandes figures du dieu Bès associé au culte de la parèdre d'Amon.
Ainsi, si par sa proximité presque intime avec le Gebel Barkal, le sanctuaire de Mout remplissait un rôle particulier dans la théologie qui s'exprimait sur ce site, par sa position méridionale il rappelait son exemple de Thèbes et devait être non moins intimement lié aux cérémonies du grand temple d'Amon de Napata.
D'autres temples furent par la suite édifiés entre ces deux principaux sanctuaires de sorte que sur tout le front de la falaise s'alignaient pas moins de treize temples disposés en éventail.
Ce site est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en Afrique au Soudan.

Nuri is a place in modern Sudan on the west side of the Nile, near the Fourth Cataract. Nuri is situated about 15 km north of Sanam, and 10 km from Jebel Barkal.

History
Nuri is the second of three Napatan burial sites and the construction of pyramids at Nuri began when there was no longer enough space at El-Kurru. More than 20 ancient pyramids belonging to Nubian kings and queens are still standing at Nuri, which served as a royal necropolis for the ancient city of Napata, the first capital of the Nubian Kingdom of Kush. It is probable that, at its apex, 80 or more pyramids stood at Nuri, marking the tombs of royals. The pyramids at Nuri were built over a period of more than three centuries, from circa 670 BCE for the oldest (pyramid of Taharqa), to around 310 BCE (pyramid of king Nastasen).  

The earliest known pyramid (Nu. 1) at Nuri belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 meters square by 40 or by 50 metres high. The pyramid of Taharqa was situated so that when observed from Jebel Barkal at sunrise on Egyptian New Year's Day, the beginning of the annual flooding of the Nile, the sun would rise from the horizon directly over its point.
Tantamani, successor of Taharqa, was buried at el-Kurru, but all following Napatan kings and many of their queens and children until Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 315 BC) were buried here, some 80 royals. The pyramids at Nuri are, in general, smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily degraded (caused by both humans and nature), but often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built at least in part from reused pyramid stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramid chapels.
The pyramids were partially excavated by George Reisner in the early 20th century. In 2018, a new archaeological expedition began work at the site, directed by Pearce Paul Creasman.
The pyramids of Nuri, together with other buildings in the region around Gebel Barkal, have been placed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 2003.

Tombs at Nuri
See List of monarchs of Kush for more information.

The royal family of Kush was buried in the cemeteries of Nuri and el-Kurru.
The King's Mothers were buried in the southern group, but this is not an area exclusively used for the burial of King's Mothers. Most of the King's Wives were buried in the parallel rows just north of Taharqa's tomb. The tombs to the far north were much smaller and may have been built for wives of lesser rank. It was also found by Dows Dunham, an experienced archaeologist, that there were references to two other kings in three of the pyramids including King Taharqa. But, if they are buried there, their tombs have yet to be located and excavated.

Tomb artifacts
Numerous artifacts were found in the Nuri tombs, mainly excavated in 1916 by the Harvard University–Boston Museum of Fine Arts Expedition. It is noted that looting was present in all of the pyramids as they were accessible by digging a hole through the ground. Based on objects found within and around the tombs, it is likely that these looters came hundreds of years later. Of what remained, several fragments and completed Napatan red ware pottery were found within several tombs.

El-Kurru was the first of the three royal cemeteries used by the Kushite royals of Napata, also referred to as Egypt's 25th Dynasty, and is home to some of the royal Nubian Pyramids. It is located between the 3rd and 4th cataracts of the Nile about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the river in what is now Northern state, Sudan. El-Kurru was first excavated by George Reisner in 1918 and 1919 and after his death his assistant Dows Dunham took over his work and published the excavation report on El-Kurru in 1950. The El Kurru cemetery was primarily used from about 860 BC until 650 BC. The first tomb with a name attached to it is that of King Piye (also known as King Piankhy) dating to about 750 BC, the sixteen earlier tombs possibly belong to Piye's royal predecessors. The last 25th dynasty king, Tantamani, was buried at El Kurru around 650 BC. The subsequent Napatan rulers chose to be buried at the royal cemetery at Nuri instead. However, in the mid-4th century the 20th king, whose name is unknown, chose to have his tomb, as well as that of his queen, built at El Kurru.

History and description
Reisner thought that the earliest tomb, Tum.1, dated back to the time of Pharaoh Sheshonq I of Ancient Egypt (c. 860 BC) and predates the Kingdom of Napata by some 200 years. At the present, some scholars (Hakem, Torok) think the early cemetery stretches back to the Ramesside period and date the earliest burials to the end of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 1070 BC). However, other scholars, including Kendall, more or less agree with Reisner's chronology, and move the date of initial use to 850-830 BC as opposed to Reisner's proposed date of 860 BC.
The cemetery is divided into three parts by two wadis. The central section seems to be the oldest and contains several tumulus type tombs that predate the Kingdom of Napata. The highest part of the cemetery contains four tumulus tombs (Tum. 1, 2, 4 and 5). Tum. 6 is located to the north, across the northern wadi. To the east of the tumuli is a row of at least eight pyramids. One of them partially intrudes on a tumulus tomb (Tum. 19). According to Dunham and Reisner, the southernmost of this row of pyramids (Ku.8) belongs to King Kashta and (presumably to) his wife Pebatjma, and tomb Ku.9 belongs to King Alara, however there are no written records of names associated with these tombs. Before this row is another row of pyramids which includes those of Piye, Shabaka and Tantamani.
The southern pyramids are located to the south of the pyramid of Pebatjma, across the southern wadi. These are the pyramids of the Queens: Naparaye (Ku.3), Khensa  (Ku.4), Qalhata (Ku.5), and Ku.6 which possibly belongs to Arty.
As mentioned previously, not all of the tombs at El-Kurru are pyramids. Tombs Tum. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (tum. standing for tumulus), and Ku.19 are all Nubian style tumuli that consist of a rock-cut pit covered by a circular mound of gravel, pebbles, and rubble. This style of tumulus is also seen in C-Group burials and at burials at Kerma. However, the style of the tumuli changed with time. Tum.6 and Ku.19 both have circular enclosure walls, which are sturdier than the rubble piles that topped the previous tombs, and had offering chapels. The following ten tombs built, Ku. 14, 13, 11, 10, 9, 23, 21, 8, 20, 7, also had offering chapels (except for Ku.21 and Ku.20) and had square plan rather than circular. Reisner believed that these square tombs were mastabas, flat topped structures, but scholars Lohwasser and Kendall argue that they were actually topped with small pyramids that were removed when the tombs were looted. King Piye's tomb (Ku.17) marks another change in the building style of the tombs at El-Kurru, he was buried in a vaulted chamber that was both rock cut and built with stone masonry. The royal pyramids built after King Piye's were similarly monumental and King Tanwetamani (Ku.16) and Queen Qalhata's (Ku.5) tombs are even exquisitely painted with scenes of the Egyptian underworld. Unfortunately, both the interior and exterior of almost all of the tombs at El-Kurru were looted, leaving the tombs in disrepair. However, the artifacts that were left behind indicate that these rulers were incredibly wealthy and successful.
In the medieval period, when the region was part of the Christian kingdom of Makuria, El-Kurru constituted a walled settlement functioning until about 1200. In this period, Christian Nubians carved various graffiti into pyramid Ku. 1, including monograms, Christian symbols and, most remarkably, a multitude of boats, perhaps commemorating "some kind of river procession."

Ku.2 – dates to 362-342 BC, belongs to an unknown queen, likely the queen of the unknown king buried in Ku.1.

Horse burials
Some 120 metres (390 ft) to the north-west of pyramids K.51–K.55, four rows of graves were found which contained horse burials (Ku.201-224). The rows contained four, eight, eight, and four graves respectively. The four graves in the first row likely date to the time of Piye, the tombs in the second row date to the time of Shabaka, the tombs in the third row date to the time of Shebitqo, and the tombs in the fourth and last row date to the time of Tantamani.
The tombs had all been robbed, but enough remained to determine that the horses were all buried in an upright position. The horses were buried with all their trappings.

Recent archaeological work
In 2013 archaeological work once again commenced at El Kurru. In collaboration with the National Council for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM), and partially funded by the Qatar Sudan Archaeological Project (QSAP), Dr. Geoff Emberling (Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, Michigan) and Dr. Rachael J. Dann (Associate Professor, Egyptian & Sudanese Archaeology, University of Copenhagen) co-direct excavation, survey, documentation and conservation work at the site. Much of this work is discussed here:

Naqa or Naga'a (Arabic: ٱلـنَّـقْـعَـة, romanized: An-Naqʿah) is a ruined ancient city of the Kushite Kingdom of Meroë in modern-day Sudan. The ancient city lies about 170 km (110 miles) north-east of Khartoum, and about 50 km (31 miles) east of the Nile River located at approximately MGRS 36QWC290629877. Here smaller wadis meet the Wadi Awateib coming from the center of the Butana plateau region, and further north at Wad ban Naqa from where it joins the Nile. Naqa was only a camel or donkey's journey from the Nile, and could serve as a trading station on the way to the east; thus it had strategic importance.
Naqa is one of the largest ruined sites in the country and indicates an important ancient city once stood in the location. It was one of the centers of the Kingdom of Meroë,  which served as a bridge between the Mediterranean world and Africa. The site has two notable temples, one devoted to Amun and the other to Apedemak which also has a Roman kiosk nearby. With Meroë and Musawwarat es-Sufra it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.

Research
The first European travellers reached Naqa in 1822, before Hermann von Pückler-Muskau did in 1837. In 1843, it was visited by Richard Lepsius and his Prussian Egypt-Sudan expedition. He copied some of the inscriptions and representations of the temple standing here. In 1958 a team from Berlin's Humboldt University visited Naqa and documented the temple and restored part of the site along with the nearby site of Musawwarat es-Sufra in the 1960s.
Since 1995, Naqa has been excavated by a German-Polish team with the participation of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It is directed by Professor Dietrich Wildung and is financed by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and also includes Polish archaeologist Professor Lech Krzyżaniak, and a small group of Polish archaeologists from Poznań. Krzyżaniak later received the Grand Officer of the Order of the Two Niles in 2002 for his work.

Structure
Naqa comprises several Meroitic temples dating to 4th century BC to 4th century AD. The remains of various temples were found, but the two largest and most significant temples of Naqa are the Amun and Apedemak temples, also known as the Temple of the Lion. Both are still well preserved.

Temple of Amun
The Amun temple of Naqa was founded by King Natakamani and is 100 metres in length and has several statues of the ruler. The temple is aligned on an east-west axis and is made of sandstone, which has been somewhat eroded by the wind. The temple is designed in the Egyptian style, with an outer court and colonnade of rams similar to the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal and Karnak, and leads to a hypostyle hall containing the inner sanctuary (naos). The main entrances and walls of the temple contain relief carvings.
In 1999 the German-Polish archaeology team explored the area of the inner sanctuary of the temple. The reverse and sides of the stela contain undeciphered Meroitic hieroglyphs and is considered by the discovery team to be one of the best examples of Meroitic art found to date. After excavation, reconstruction and measurement of the temple of Amun for over a decade, on 1 December 2006, the Sudanese authorities regained management, giving responsibility to the Ministry of Culture.
Another Amun temple named Naqa 200 and located on the slope of the nearby Gebel Naqa, the mountain overlooking the settlement of Naqa, has been excavated since 2004. It was built by Amanikhareqerem and is similar to the Temple of Natakamani and is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD, although some finds do not correspond to the precise dating, adding to an already fuzzy understanding of Nubian chronology.

Temple of Apedemak
Located to the west of the temple of Amun is the temple of Apedemak (or the Lion Temple). Apedemak  was a lion-headed warrior god worshipped in Nubia. The god was used as a sacred guardian of the deceased hereditary chief, prince or king.  Anyone who touched the chief's grave was said to be cursed by this Apedemak.
The temple is considered a classic example of Kushite architecture. The front of the temple is an extensive gateway, and depicts Natakamani and Amanitore on the left and right exerting divine power over their prisoners, symbolically with lions at their feet. Who the prisoners are exactly is unclear, although historical records have revealed that the Kushites frequently clashed with invading desert clans. Towards the edges are fine representations of Apedemak who is represented by a snake emerging from a lotus flower. On the sides of the temple are depictions of the gods Amun, Horus and Apedemak keeping company in the presence of the king. On the rear wall of the temple is the largest depiction of the lion god, and is illustrated receiving offering from the king and queen. He is depicted as a three-headed god with four arms. The north-front shows the goddesses Isis, Mut, Hathor, Amesemi and Satet.

Roman kiosk
The Roman kiosk is a small temple near the main temple building, which has strong Greco-Roman  Hellenistic elements. The entrance to the kiosk is Egyptian and is topped by a lintel with a row of sacred uraeus (cobras) but the sides consist of columns with florid Corinthian capitals and arched windows in the Roman style. Recent excavations at the building showed that it was probably devoted to the worship of Hathor. The goddess Isis was known to have absorbed some characteristics of Hathor.

Other
Standing at the foot of the sandstone cliffs of Jabal Naqa is the temple named "500". It was built by Shanakdakhete around 135 BC, making it the oldest building on the site. The texts on the temple walls are the oldest known writings in Meroitic hieroglyphs. Judging by the reliefs, the temple was dedicated to the Theban triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, as well as Apedemak. In 1834, Giuseppe Ferlini discovered treasure which was severely damaged. A thorough excavation and restoration has been made since.

Naqa est une ancienne ville en ruines du royaume de Méroé au Soudan actuel. La ville antique se trouve environ 170 km au nord-est de Khartoum et environ 50 km à l'est du Nil. Elle est située près du MGRS 36QWC290629877. Des petits oueds y rejoignent l'oued Awateib, venant du centre du plateau de la Butana. 
Naga était une étape sur le chemin de l'orient et avait donc une importance stratégique.
Naga est l'un des plus grands sites de ruines du Soudan. Elle a été l'un des centres du royaume de Méroé, qui a servi de pont entre le monde méditerranéen et l'Afrique.
Le site compte deux temples remarquables, l'un dédié à Amon et l'autre à Apédémak, ainsi qu'à la chapelle d'Hathor, tous trois datant du Ier siècle de notre ère.

Recherche
Les premiers voyageurs européens ont visité Naga à partir de 1822, dont Hermann von Pückler-Muskau en 1837 et Richard Lepsius en 1843.
Lepsius a copié certaines des inscriptions et figures représentées. 
En 1958, une équipe de l'université Humboldt a visité Naga, documenté et restauré en partie le temple, ainsi que le site proche de Musawwarat es-Sofra dans les années 1960.
Depuis 1995, Naga est fouillée par une équipe germano-polonaise, avec la participation du Musée égyptien de Berlin et de la Fondation du Patrimoine Culturel Prussien, dirigée par le Professeur Dietrich Wildung et financée par la Fondation allemande pour la recherche (DFG), et comprend également l'archéologue polonais Lech Krzyżaniak et un petit groupe d'archéologues polonais de Poznań.

Bâtiments
Naga comprend plusieurs temples dont la datation s'étend du IVe siècle avant notre ère au IVe siècle de notre ère, ainsi que les ruines d'une agglomération urbaine et plusieurs lieux de sépulture. Les vestiges de plusieurs temples ont été trouvés, mais les deux plus grands et plus importants temples de Naqa sont le temple d'Amon et le temple d'Apédémak (également connu comme « Temple du Lion »), qui sont encore bien conservés.

Temple d'Amon
Amon est une divinité de la mythologie égyptienne qui, sous la forme d'Amon-Rê, devient le centre du système théologique le plus complexe de l'Égypte antique. 
Le temple d'Amon de Naga a été fondée par le roi Natakamani et s'étend sur près de cent mètres ; il possède plusieurs statues de ce roi. Le temple est aligné sur un axe est-ouest et est constitué de grès, qui a été érodé par le vent.  
Le temple est conçu dans le style égyptien, avec une cour extérieure et une allée de béliers, semblable à celle du temple d'Amon au Gebel Barkal ou à celle de Karnak. Cette allée conduit à une salle hypostyle contenant le sanctuaire intérieur. Les entrées principales et les murs du temple sont décorés des sculptures en relief.

En 1999, une équipe germano-polonaise d'archéologie a exploré la zone du sanctuaire intérieur du temple, où la principale statue du dieu était conservée à l'origine. Ils ont découvert un « autel » peint en bon état, qui comprend l'iconographie et des noms écrits en hiéroglyphes du roi Natakamani et sa femme Amanitore, les fondateurs du temple. Cet autel est considéré comme unique tant au Soudan qu'en Égypte, pour la période concernée. 
Une cinquième statue du roi Natakamani a également été découverte dans cette chambre, avec une stèle commémorative en pierre de la reine Amanishakhéto, qui aurait gouverné les Méroïtes avant le règne de Natakamani et d'Amanitore. L'avers montre un délicat relief sculpté de la reine et déesse qui était la partenaire du dieu-lion méroïtique Apédémak. L'arrière et les côtés de la stèle présentent des hiéroglyphes méroïtiques non déchiffré, et est considéré par l'équipe de la découverte pour être l'un des meilleurs exemples d'art méroïtique trouvé à ce jour. 
Après les fouilles, recherches et la reconstruction du temple d'Amon qui ont duré plus d'une décennie, le 1er décembre 2006, les autorités Soudanaises ont repris la gestion du site, en confiant sa responsabilité au Ministère de la Culture.
Un autre temple d'Amon, nommé Naqa 200 a été fouillé depuis 2004. Il a été construit par Amanikhareqerem et est semblable au temple de Natakamani et est daté du IIe ou IIIe siècle de notre ère, bien que certaines découvertes puissent contrarier la datation précise, ajoutant un peu plus d'incompréhension à une chronologie nubienne déjà floue.

Temple d'Apédémak
Situé à l'ouest du temple d'Amon est le temple de Apédémak (ou « Temple du Lion »). Apédémak est un dieu guerrier à la tête de lion, adoré en Nubie. Ce dieu a la fonction de gardien sacré du chef héréditaire, de prince ou de roi défunt. Toute personne qui a touché la tombe du chef est réputée maudite par Apédémak.

Le temple est considéré comme un exemple classique de l'architecture koushite. La façade du temple est une vaste passerelle, et dépeint Natakamani et Amanitore, respectivement à gauche et à droite, exerçant un pouvoir divin sur leurs prisonniers. Ils sont représentés symboliquement avec des lions à leurs pieds. Déterminer qui sont les prisonniers n'est pas évident, bien que de documents historiques aient révélé que les Kouchites étaient souvent en conflit et subissaient les invasions de tribus du désert. 
Aux angles, on trouve des représentations d'Apédémak figuré par un serpent sortant d'un lotus en fleur. Sur les côtés du temple, on trouve des représentations des dieux Amon, Horus et Apédémak se tenant en présence du roi. Sur le mur arrière du temple se trouve la plus grande représentation du dieu, illustrée par le réception des offrandes faites par le roi et la reine. Il est dépeint comme un dieu à trois têtes et quatre bras. À l'intérieur du temple se trouve une sculpture du dieu Sarapis, représenté avec une barbe de style gréco-romain. Un autre dieu avec une couronne est représenté, sans être formellement identifié ; il pourrait être d'origine perse.
Bien que l'architecture du temple d'Apédémak soit fortement influencée par les anciens égyptiens, et présente quelques formes classiques égyptiennes, certaines des représentations du roi et de la reine sont de bons exemples des différences entre l'art égyptiens et l'art kouchite. Le roi Natakamani et la reine Amanitore sont représentés avec des têtes rondes et les épaules larges, Amanitore avec des hanches exceptionnellement larges, ce qui est plus typique de l'art africain. Ainsi le temple d'Apédémak illustre profondément le mélange des influences artistiques des koushites, en particulier lorsque l'on observe le kiosque romain à côté, clairement influencé par la Grèce antique et par Rome. La représentation d'Apédémak en serpent et le lotus en fleur sont aussi inhabituels, et au début des archéologues de Naqa ont même imaginé que le temple avait des connexions en Inde, étant donné que les routes commerciales de l'Inde conduisaient au port antique d'Adulis (dans l'actuelle Érythrée) sur la mer Rouge. Ces connexions sont toujours recherchées par les archéologues modernes.

Kiosque romain
Le kiosque romain est un petit temple près du temple principal, à forte influence hellénistique. L'entrée du kiosque est égyptienne, surmontée d'un linteau avec une rangée d'uræus (cobras sacrés). Les côtés sont décorés de colonnes corinthiennes aux chapiteaux fleuris et de fenêtres cintrées, dans le style romain. Les fouilles récentes du bâtiment ont révélé qu'il était probablement consacré au culte d'Hathor. En témoigne la découverte d'une statue d'Isis, déesse égyptienne antique, dont le culte se propageait dans tout le monde Gréco-Romain. Isis est la déesse de la maternité et de la fertilité ; elle était adorée comme l'idéal de la mère, la femme, la maîtresse de la nature et de la magie. La déesse Isis est connue pour avoir absorbé plusieurs caractéristiques d'Hathor.

« Temple 500 »
Le « temple 500 » se trouve en position légèrement excentrée, au pied des falaises de grès. À en juger par les reliefs, il était dédié à la triade thébaine d'Amon, Mout et Khonsou, ainsi qu'à Apédémak. Des travaux de fouille minutieuse et de restauration ont été réalisés depuis. 
D'après des inscriptions en hiéroglyphes méroïtiques, il a été construit par Shanakdakhete. Cette reine est habituellement considérée comme ayant régné vers la fin du IIe et le début du Ier siècle av. J.-C. avant notre ère. Si tel est le cas, alors le temple est le plus ancien bâtiment du site, et des textes sur les murs du temple sont les plus anciens écrits en hiéroglyphes méroïtiques. Cependant, cette datation est contestée, précisément pour des raisons paléographiques, par Claude Rilly qui place Shanakdakhete à la fin du Ier siècle avant notre ère. La chronologie des souverains du royaume de Koush n'est en effet pas encore établie de manière consensuelle entre les chercheurs.

« Temple 200 »
Le « temple 200 » est un petit complexe cultuel qui se trouve immédiatement au sud du grand temple d'Amon. Il est composé de trois éléments : un reposoir de barque ou autel, puis un kiosque ouvert, puis le temple lui-même, composé d'un bâtiment rectangulaire et d'un petit pylône à deux môles. Ses bas-reliefs sont très mal préservés et le plus souvent seuls les pieds des figures sont visibles. Néanmoins, les chercheurs ont pu reconnaître plusieurs formes différentes d'Amon et le dieu-lion Apedemak.

Musawwarat es-Sufra (Arabic:المصورات الصفراء al-Musawwarāt as-sufrā, Meroitic: Aborepi, Old Egyptian: jbrp, jpbr-ˁnḫ), also known as Al-Musawarat Al-Sufra, is a large Meroitic temple complex in modern Sudan, dating back to the early Meroitic period of the 3rd century BC. It is located in a large basin surrounded by low sandstone hills in the western Butana, 180 km northeast of Khartoum, 20 km north of Naqa and approximately 25 km south-east of the Nile. With Meroë and Naqa it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011. Constructed in sandstone, the main features of the site include the Great Enclosure, the Lion Temple of Apedemak and the Great Reservoir. Most significant is the number of representations of elephants, suggesting that this animal played an important role at Musawwarat es-Sufra.

The site of Musawwarat es-Sufra was originally mentioned by Linant de Bellefonds in 1822, and then shortly thereafter by Frédéric Cailliaud. The first detailed description of the site was made by Carl Richard Lepsius. Archaeological fieldwork was conducted by the Butana expedition of the Humboldt University of Berlin under the direction of archaeologist Fritz Hintze from 1960 until 1970. The team re-erected the Lion Temple, collapsed in antiquity, and constructed a new roof. These investigations continued after a gap of several decades and are ongoing.

Lion Temple
The Lion Temple is a single-chambered rectangular 14.21 m in length, 9.13 m in width and 4.7 m in height temple with pylon and six columns made of drums. Erected by King Arnekhamani and dedicated to Apedemak the temple bears inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphs and representations of elephants and lions on the rear inside wall as well as reliefs of Apedemak depicted as a three-headed god on the outside walls. A 3D model of the Lion Temple can be seen here. An Animation of the Lion Temple 3D model can be view here.

Great Enclosure
The Great Enclosure is the main structure of the site. Much of the large labyrinth-like building complex, which covers approximately 45,000 m2, was erected in the third century BC.  According to Hintze, "the complicated ground plan of this extensive complex of buildings is without parallel in the entire Nile valley".  The maze of courtyards includes three (possible) temples, passages, low walls, preventing any contact with the outside world, about 20 columns, ramps and two reservoirs.
There were many sculptures of animals, such as elephants and most of the walls of the complex bear graffiti and masons’ or pilgrims' marks both pictorial and in Meroitic or Greek script. The scheme of the site is, so far, without parallel in Nubia and ancient Egypt, and there is some debate about the purpose of the buildings, with earlier suggestions including a college, a hospital, and an elephant-training camp.  According to the scholar Basil Davidson, at least four Kushite queens — Amanirenas, Amanishakheto, Nawidemak and Amanitore — probably spent part of their lives in Musawwarat es-Sufra.

Great Reservoir
The Great Reservoir is a Hafir to retain as much as possible of the rainfall of the short, wet season. It is 250 m in diameter and excavated 6.3 m into the ground.

3D Models with laser-scanning
The Zamani Project document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations. The documentation of the Great Enclosure of Musawwarat es-Sufra and the Apedemak (Lion) Temple is based on terrestrial laser-scanning  and was carried out in 2009. 3D models, animations, plans and images of some of the temples are online available at www.zamaniproject.org

Old Dongola (Old Nubian: ⲧⲩⲛⲅⲩⲗ, Tungul; Arabic: دنقلا العجوز, Dunqulā al-ʿAjūz) is a deserted Nubian town in what is now Northern State, Sudan, located on the east bank of the Nile opposite the Wadi Howar. An important city in medieval Nubia, and the departure point for caravans west to Darfur and Kordofan, from the fourth to the fourteenth century Old Dongola was the capital of the Makurian state. A Polish archaeological team has been excavating the town since 1964.
The urban center of the population moved downstream 80 km (50 miles) to the opposite side of the Nile during the nineteenth century, becoming the modern Dongola.

History
Foundation and heyday
The archaeological site encompassing Old Dongola has about 200 ha. Its southern part features a citadel and urban buildings, while in the north, splendid suburban residences have been uncovered. There are also cemeteries associated with subsequent phases of the town's functioning, including Islamic domed tombs.
Old Dongola was founded in the fifth century as a fortress. On the citadel, which was the royal residence, numerous palaces and public buildings were located. In the mid-sixth century with the arrival of Christianity it became the capital of Makuria, The town was further expanded, including the area outside the citadel. Several churches were built. These include, to use the names contemporary archeologists have given them, Building X and the Church with the Stone Pavement. These two structures were erected about 100 meters apart from the walled town centre, indicating that at this time the town already extended over the original walls of the fortress. Building X was soon replaced by the Old Church.

In the middle of the seventh century, the two main churches were destroyed, but rebuilt soon after. Building material was taken from the Old Church and used to repair the city walls. Archeologists believe this destruction is evidence of the First (642) and Second Battles of Dongola (652).

At the end of the seventh Century, the Church of the Granite Columns was erected over the Old Church. Adorned with 16 granite columns, each with richly decorated granite capitals, the Church of the Granite Columns perhaps was the cathedral of Old Dongola.
The city's heyday was in the ninth–eleventh centuries, but building activity lasted until the fourteenth century. The Church of the Stone Pavements was replaced with the Cruciform Church at this time. Other buildings in use in Old Dongola at this time include many other churches, at least two palaces, and a sizable monastery on its north side. Several houses were well equipped and had bath rooms and wall paintings.

The Book of Knowledge, a travelogue compiled by a Spanish monk soon after 1348, mentions that Genoese merchants had settled in Old Dongola; they may have penetrated there as a consequence of the commercial treaty of 1290 between Genoa and Egypt.

The Great Monastery of St Anthony
About 1.5 km to the north-east of the citadel lies the so-called Kom H where the monastery was uncovered. According to the inscription it is dedicated to St Anthony the Great but the Monastery of the Holy Trinity is also referred to in literature. It was probably one of the first Christian building projects in Dongola. Archbishop of Dongola, Georgios, who died in 1113, was buried in one of the crypts in the church. The inscription on his funerary stela indicates that St Anthony the Great was the patron of the monastery. In the rich assemblage of texts in Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian found in the archbishop's crypt, a dedication to the Holy Trinity also appears.
Approximately 100 compositions, dated to the eleventh–thirteenth century, were uncovered on the walls of the monastery buildings. Many of these paintings are unique, both from the artistic and iconographical point of view. They depicted Christ, Mary, the Apostles, scenes from the Old and New Testament, as well as dignitaries.

The Throne Hall
The monumental representative building interpreted as the Throne Hall of the Makurian kings is a massive defence-like building of 28 m by 18 m by 12 m situated on a rocky spur to the east from the fortress. It was built in the 9th century. The building had two stories; the height of the walls was 6.5 m on the ground floor and 3.5 m on the upper floor. In 1317 it was turned into a mosque, an event which is preserved in a foundation stela erected by Sayf al-Din Abdullah Barshambu. The ceremonial Throne Hall on the first floor was turned into a prayer room. The mosque remained in use until 1969, when the building was converted in a historic monument.

Decline
During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the town was in decline. It was attacked by Arabs several times. A surviving inscription erected in Old Dongola bears the date of 1317, is commonly understood to be the record of a military expedition sent by the Sultan of Egypt to place his nominee Abdullah, perhaps a Muslim Nubian, on the throne. The royal court left Dongola in 1364.

Under the Funj, Old Dongola became the capital of the Northern provinces. The French traveller Charles-Jacques Poncet visited the city in 1699, and in his memoirs he described it as located on the slope of a sandy hill. His description of Old Dongola continues:

The houses are ill built, and the streets half deserted and fill'd with heaps of sand, occasion'd by floods from the mountains. The castle is in the very center of the town. It is large and spacious, but the fortifications are inconsiderable. It keeps in awe the Arabians, who are masters of the open country.
Intensive trade relations with the Far East, as well as Europe, continued in this period. However, trade declined after the rise of the Shaigiya Confederacy. In 1812, the Mamluks fled to Sudan to escape purges in Egypt and conquered Old Dongola. They founded the city of New Dongola downriver, which grew in size, shifting the economic and trade center of the region away from Old Dongola.

Islamic cemetery
A large Islamic cemetery with numerous qubbas, erected in the 17th century, testify to the importance of Old Dongola also in postmedieval times.

Polish archaeological expedition to Old Dongola
Polish archaeological and conservation works in Dongola were initiated by Kazimierz Michałowski. The Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw has conducted research at the site since 1964, with the support of the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums. The first head of the expedition was architect Antoni Ostrasz. Later, Stefan Jakobielski and Włodzimierz Godlewski directed the works for 60 years. Since 2017, the "UMMA: Urban Metamorphosis of the community of a Medieval African capital city" project (ERC Starting Grant), headed by Artur Obłuski, has been active in studies of the youngest layers of the site.
In May 2021, archaeologists led by Obłuski announced the discovery of a new church's apse decorated with paintings describing two rows of colossal figures, as well as an attached wall and the nearby dome of a large tomb in Old Dongola, which might have been a cathedral and the largest known church from medieval Nubia. Obłuski reported: "The apse is about 9 meters deep. This means that the eastern part of the building has been preserved to the impressive height of three floors of a typical block of flats. And this gives a great chance that there are more paintings and inscriptions under our feet, just like in Faras". In February 2023, the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology headed by Obłuski announced the discovery of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs inscribed on stone blocks and figural decorations as elements from a Pharaonic temple. Further, the Polish archaeologists discovered various unusual wall paintings probably from the thirteenth century. One of these paintings is a portrait of the Virgin Mary, and another depicts a scene with the archangel Michael and a Nubian king. Holding the king in his arms, the archangel presents him to Jesus sitting on a cloud and extending a hand for the king to kiss. “This is completely uncommon for Byzantine Christian art, which generally does not show a lot of interaction or contact between mortals and immortals,” said team leader Artur Obłuski.

Le Vieux Dongola (en ancien nubien Tungul, en grec Timikleos, en arabe Dunqulā al-ʿAjūz نقلا العجوز) est un site archéologique localisé sur la rive Est du Nil à l'opposé de l'oued Howar, dans ce qui est aujourd'hui l'État du Nord, au Soudan. Ville importante de la Nubie médiévale, et point de départ des caravanes vers le Darfour et le Kordofan, elle est capitale de la Makurie du IVe au XIVe siècle. Une équipe d'archéologues polonais fouille le site depuis 1964.
Le centre urbain actuel, la Dongola moderne, est situé à quelque 80 km en aval sur la rive opposée du Nil.

Histoire
La ville de Vieux Dongola est fondée au Ve siècle, d'abord en tant que forteresse, mais une ville s'établit rapidement autour d'elle. Avec l'arrivée du christianisme au milieu du VIe siècle, la ville devient la capitale de Makurie et plusieurs églises y sont construites, dont le « Bâtiment X » et l'« église du Pavage de Pierre », d'après les noms donnés par les archéologues modernes. Ces deux structures ont été édifiées à 100 m de distance du centre-ville fortifié, indiquant qu'au temps de leur érection, la ville s'étendait déjà au-delà des murailles originelles de la forteresse. Le « Bâtiment X » a été rapidement remplacé par la « Vieille Église ».

Les deux églises principales sont détruites au milieu du VIIe siècle, puis reconstruites peu après. Les matériaux de construction de la « Vieille Église » ont alors servi à la réparation des murs de la cité. Les archéologues pensent qu'il s'agit là de preuves de la première (en) (642) puis de la deuxième (652) bataille de Dongola. Ornée de 16 colonnes de granite chacune coiffée d'un chapiteau de granite riche décoré, l'« Église des Colonnes de Granite » était peut-être la cathédrale de Vieux Dongola.

Vieux Dongola atteint son apogée au Xe siècle. L'« église du Pavage de Pierre » est remplacée par l'« Église cruciforme » à cette époque. On trouve également en usage à l'époque d'autres églises, au moins deux palais et un monastère assez important au nord. Plusieurs maisons sont bien équipées et possèdent salles de bains et des peintures murales.
Le Libro del Conoscimiento, un récit de voyage compilé par un moine espagnol peu après 1348 mentionne l'établissement de marchands génois à Vieux Dongola, qu'ils auraient atteint à la suite du traité commercial de 1290 entre Gênes et l'Égypte.

Salle du Trône
La « salle du Trône » est une structure massive de type défensive de 28 par 18 par 12 m située sur un éperon rocheux à l'est de la forteresse. Construite au IXe siècle, ce bâtiment abritait la salle du trône des rois de Makurie. En 1317, elle est transformée en mosquée ; cet évènement est consigné dans une stèle érigée par Sayf al-Din Abdullah Barshambu. La salle du trône cérémonielle du rez-de-chaussée est alors transformée en salle de prière. La mosquée reste utilisée jusqu'en 1969, puis le bâtiment est converti en monument historique.

Cathédrale
En 2021, les archéologues du Centre polonais d'archéologie méditerranéenne, dirigés par le professeur Artur Obluski découvrent, au centre de la ville,  les ruines d'une église qui est probablement le plus grand édifice chrétien de la Nubie médiévale. L'abside a un diamètre de 6 m et l'église atteint une largeur de 26 m. Les sondages effectués montrent que l'édifice mesurerait 9 m de haut et que ses murs, probablement couverts de peintures, seraient bien préservés. Compte tenu de sa taille les archéologues estiment qu'il s'agirait d'une cathédrale. Les fouilles doivent se poursuivre en 2022.

Déclin
La ville décline cependant entre les XIIIe et XIVe siècles. Elle est attaquée plusieurs fois par les Arabes. Une inscription datée de 1317 constitue la trace d'une expédition militaire envoyée par le sultan d'Égypte pour placer son protégé Abdullah, peut être un Nubien musulman, sur le trône. Sous le sultanat Funj, Vieux Dongola devient la capitale des provinces du Nord. L'explorateur français Charles-Jacques Poncet visite la ville en 1699, et la décrit dans ses mémoires comme localisée sur les versants d'une colline sablonneuse.

Cimetière islamique
Un grand cimetière islamique avec de nombreuses qubbas, érigé au XVIIe siècle, témoigne de l'importance de Dongola même après les temps médiévaux.

Kerma was the capital city of the Kerma culture, which was founded in present-day Sudan before 3500 BC. Kerma is one of the largest archaeological sites in ancient Nubia. It has produced decades of extensive excavations and research, including thousands of graves and tombs and the residential quarters of the main city surrounding the Western, or Lower, Deffufa.
The locale that is now Kerma was first settled by hunter-gatherers around 8350 BC, during the Mesolithic. Between 5550 BC and 5150 BC, the site was mostly abandoned, possibly due to decreased Nile flow during this time interval. A second hiatus in occupation occurred between 4050 BC and 3450 BC, likely as a result of minimal flow from the White Nile. Around 3000 BC, agriculture developed and a cultural tradition began around Kerma. Kerma later developed into a large urban center that was built around a large adobe temple known as the Western Deffufa, which was built after 1750 BC. A state society formed between 2550 BC and 1550 BC, with a significant decrease in cattle breeding being evidenced by the archaeological record around 1750 BC. Evidence for copper metallurgy appears from c. 2200–2000 BC. As a capital city and location of royal burials, Kerma sheds light on the complex social structure present in this society.

Settlement periods
Pre-Kerma (c. 3500–2500 BC) No C-Group culture Phase
Early Kerma (c. 2500–2050 BC) C-Group Phase Ia–Ib
Middle Kerma (c. 2050–1750 BC) C-Group Phase Ib–IIa
Classic Kerma (c. 1750–1580 BC) C-Group Phase IIb–III
Final Kerma (c. 1580–1500 BC) C-Group Phase IIb–III
Late Kerma – "New Kingdom" (c. 1500–1100? BC) "New Kingdom"

Kerma and its artifacts
By 1700 BC, Kerma was host to a population of at least 10,000 people. Different to those of ancient Egypt in theme and composition, Kerma's artefacts are characterized by extensive amounts of blue faience, which the Kermans developed techniques to work with independently of Egypt, and by their work with glazed quartzite and architectural inlays.

Kerma's cemetery and royal tombs
Kerma contains a cemetery with over 30,000 graves. The cemetery shows a general pattern of larger graves ringed by smaller ones, suggesting social stratification. The site includes at its southern boundary burial mounds, with four extending upwards of 90 metres (300 feet) in diameter. These are believed to be the graves of the city's final kings, some of which contain motifs and artwork reflecting Egyptian deities such as Horus. Generally, influence from Egypt may be observed in numerous burials, especially with regards to material evidence such as pottery and grave goods. For example, Second Intermediate Egyptian ceramics from Avaris, such as Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware, have been discovered within Kerma burials. In addition, artifacts such as scarab seals and amulets are prolific, indicating extensive trade with ancient Egypt as well as an exchange of cultural ideas. After the sacking of Kerma, the cemetery was used to host the kings of the 25th or "Napatan" dynasty of the Kingdom of Kush from Upper (Southern) Nubia.

Religious tradition
Some scholars note an animistic tradition rather than a polytheistic one in pre-New Kingdom Kerma, in contrast to the later Napatan and Meroitic periods: animals depicted during the Classical Kerma period do not show anthropomorphic features like their Egyptian counterparts, and mesas like Jebel Barkal were treated in animistic fashion,  After the New Kingdom Egyptian takeover of Upper Nubia, anthropomorphic deities came to prominence. This cultural exchange was bidirectional, as New Kingdom Egyptians began to treat Jebel Barkal as a sacred site, a tradition they likely learned from the indigenous Kerma culture.

Archaeology
Early 20th century
Early archaeology at Kerma started with an Egyptian and Sudanese survey by George Reisner, an American with joint appointments at Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Reisner later led these two institutions in the so-called "Harvard-Boston" expedition during three field seasons at Kerma (1913–1916). He worked in Egypt and Sudan for 25 years, 1907–1932. 
As Kerma was one of the earliest sites to be excavated in this region, Reisner's contributions to the region's archaeology are fundamental. A basic chronology of Kerman culture was established based on the work of Reisner's Harvard-Boston expedition; this provided the scaffolding for all other findings in the region. Reisner's precise excavation techniques, site reports, and other publications made later reinterpretation of his results possible.

The Lower/Western Deffufa (a massive tomb structure) was found closer to the river (19°36'2"N, 30°24'37"E); the Upper/Eastern Deffufa is a few kilometers away from the river in a cemetery (19°36'15"N, 30°26'41"E). The deceased in most burials were slightly flexed, lying on their sides. Reisner saw many links to ancient Egyptian culture through his architectural techniques and the dimensions of the Lower/Western Deffufa's base (52.3 m × 26.7 m, or 150 × 100 Egyptian cubits). He assumed it was a fort. He did not conduct further excavations of the settlement suspected to surround the Lower Deffuffa.
The Upper/Eastern Deffufa was located amidst thousands of low, round graves, with clear stylistic differences among the northern, middle, and southern parts of the cemetery. The most elaborate tombs were found in the southern part. Reisner assumed that the large, quadrangular deffufa structures were funerary chapels associated with the largest mound graves, not tombs per se. He interpreted these based on his knowledge of ancient Egyptian funerary practices, and since many of the grave goods found were Egyptian, he had no reason to think otherwise.
Reisner fit this archaeology into his understanding of ancient life along the Nile, assuming that Kerma was a satellite city of the ancient Egyptians. It was not until the late 20th century that excavations by Charles Bonnet and the University of Geneva confirmed that this was not the case. They instead uncovered a vast independent urban complex that ruled most of the Third Cataract for centuries.

Late 20th century to present
Decades after Reisner's excavations, Bonnet's refutation of the idea that Kerma was an Egyptian satellite city was accepted. "The patient and diligent work of Bonnet and his colleagues unearthed the foundations of numerous houses, workshops, and palaces, proving that as early as 2000 BC Kerma was a large urban center, presumably the capital city and a burial ground of the kings of Kush." From 1977 to 2003, Bonnet and an international team of scholars excavated at Kerma.
Bonnet's Swiss team has excavated the following types of sites at Kerma: ancient town, princely tomb, temple, residential/administrative buildings, Napatan buildlings, a Napatan potter's workshop, Meroitic cemeteries, fortifications, and Neolithic grain pits and huts. Among many other unique finds, Bonnet uncovered a bronze forge in the main city. "It is within the walls of the religious center that a bronze workshop was built. The workshop consisted of multiple forges and the artisans' techniques appear to have been quite elaborate. There is no comparable discovery in Egypt or in Sudan to help us interpret these remains."
In 2003, Bonnet and his archaeological team discovered black granite statues of pharaohs of Egypt's Twenty-fifth Dynasty near Kerma. The statues are displayed onsite in the Kerma Museum.

Bioarchaeology
Mortuary practices in Kerma varied over time, as can be seen in the archaeological record. The large cemetery around the Upper/Eastern Deffufa is arranged with older graves in the northern part and more-recent (and -complex) graves and tombs in the southern part. "In the Early Kerma period, 2500-2050 BC, burials are marked by a low, circular superstructure of slabs of black sandstone, stuck into the ground in concentric circles. White quartz pebbles reinforce the structure." Smaller burials surround larger tombs of important individuals. Tombs progress from simple mounds to Egyptian-inspired pyramid complexes. This transition did not begin until long after pyramids fell out of fashion in Egypt.
Bonnet notes that sacrificial victims appear and become increasingly common in the Middle Kerma period. Because burial chambers can be easily entered, one could question the likelihood of the sacrifice of a wife and/or child when a man dies without any ethnohistorical evidence to support this in the culture. In fact Buzon and Judd question this assumption by analyzing traumata and indicators of skeletal stress in these "sacrificial victims."
Most skeletons have been found in a slightly contracted or contracted position on their sides. Because of the arid desert climate, natural mummification is very common. Without the normal processes of decomposition to skeletonize the body, soft tissues, hairs, and organic grave goods are still often found (e.g., textiles, feathers, leather, fingernails). Grave goods include faience beads, cattle skulls, and pottery. Skeletal collections, like other archaeological evidence, continue to be re-examined and re-interpreted as new research questions arise. Two recent studies highlight the kinds of questions that bioarchaeologists are asking of the skeletal material excavated from Kerma.
Kendall suggests that large tombs in the Upper Deffufa contained the bodies of dozens or hundreds of sacrificed victims. A later bioarchaeological examination of these remains , with samples drawn from the "sacrificial corridors" and interments outside of the large tumulus corridors, showed no significant differences between the skeletal-stress markers of sacrificed versus non-sacrificed individuals. Accompanying individuals in the tumuli at Kerma have been interpreted as wives sacrificed upon the death of the husband, but the bioarchaeological evidence does not support this conclusion. A prior study noted no difference in the frequency of traumatic injury.
Traumatic injury in the Kerma remains is viewed through the lens of modern traumatic-injury patterns. "Many aspects of the Kerma injury pattern were comparable to clinical [modern] observations: males experienced a higher frequency of trauma, the middle-aged group exhibited the most trauma, the oldest age cohort revealed the least amount of accumulated injuries, a small group experienced multiple trauma and fractures occurred more frequently than dislocations or muscle pulls." Parry fractures, which often occur when an individual is fending off a blow from an attacker, are common. These do not necessarily result from assault, however, and Judd does acknowledge this. She does not use the same parsing strategy when considering that Colles' fractures (of the wrist, which usually occur when an object falls onto one's hands) may have resulted from being pushed from a height (as distinct from other interpersonal violence), and this is not acknowledged.
S.O.Y. Keita conducted an anthropological study in which he examined the crania of groups in the North African region, including samples from Kerma c. 2000 BC and the Maghreb c. 1500 BC, as well as First Dynasty crania from the royal tombs in Abydos, Egypt. The results determined that the predominant pattern of the First Dynasty Egyptian crania was a "Southern" or a "tropical African variant" (though other patterns were also observed), which had affinities with Kerma Kushites. The general results demonstrated greater affinity with Upper Nile Valley groups but also suggested a clear change from earlier craniometric trends. The gene flow and movement of northern officials to the important southern city may explain the findings.

Kerma est, actuellement, une petite ville du Soudan, située sur la rive Est du Nil, un peu au sud de la troisième cataracte et au centre de la Nubie antique. Cette région est nommée Haute-Nubie, entre les deuxième et quatrième cataractes, par rapport à la Basse-Nubie, plus au Nord, entre la première et deuxième cataracte, et le Soudan central autour de la sixième cataracte. Elle était la capitale du royaume de Kerma, ou royaume couchite, qui régna sur la Nubie entre −2500 environ, et −1480, sur 1 000 km du Nord au Sud.
Kerma est l'un des plus grands sites archéologiques de l'ancienne Nubie. Des décennies de fouilles et de recherches approfondies y ont mis au jour des milliers de tombes ainsi qu'un ensemble de quartiers résidentiels autour de la Deffufa, le temple principal. En tant que capitale et emplacement des sépultures royales, elle éclaire la structure sociale complexe de cet ancien royaume.
Les populations de Kerma parlaient des langues chamito-sémitiques de la branche couchitique.
La pratique d'une fouille horizontale, sur une très faible épaisseur, a néanmoins permis de retrouver jusqu'à dix villes superposées.
À un kilomètre du site de Kerma, les archéologues, sous la direction de l'archéologue spécialiste du Soudan, Charles Bonnet, ont découvert le site de Doukki Gel dont les bâtiments approximativement circulaires et datés vers 1800 AEC soulèvent de nombreuses questions.

Archéologie
Fouilles
L'ancienne cité de Kerma, identifiée à proximité du site de Doukki Gel, était le centre de ce puissant royaume rival de l'Égypte, dont les textes des anciens Égyptiens signalent qu'il verrouillait l'accès aux routes commerciales permettant d'acheminer vers le royaume pharaonique les produits du reste de l'Afrique. C'était, à quelques kilomètres en amont de la Troisième cataracte, un endroit stratégique permettant de contrôler les communications le long de la vallée du Nil.
Les fouilles systématiques pratiquées dans les années 2000 par la mission archéologique de l'Université de Genève au Soudan confirment ce rôle et démontrent que la culture dont elle fut l'origine jeta les bases d'une civilisation proto-urbaine au cœur même du Soudan contemporain. L’égyptologue Charles Bonnet, accompagné de Louis Chaix et Matthieu Honegger y découvrent des statues de pharaons de la XXVe dynastie (qui régna bien plus tard sur l'Égypte) suggérant que les dirigeants napatéens reconnaissaient un lien historique fort entre leur capitale et Kerma. Malgré ses murs de protection, la ville de Kerma n'a pas résisté à l'appétit des pharaons de la XVIIIe dynastie. Au début du -XVe siècle, ils conquièrent toute la Nubie jusqu'au sud de la quatrième cataracte. Une occupation qui permet de contrôler un carrefour entre l'Afrique centrale, la Corne de l'Afrique et les côtes de la mer Rouge.
En archéologie le nom de Kerma désigne quatre phases de développement de cette culture :

Kerma ancien: environ 2450-2050
Kerma moyen: environ 2050-1750
Kerma classique: environ 1750-1480
Kerma final: environ 1480-1450
Les trois premières phases qui s'étalent de l'Ancien Empire (Ve dynastie) au début du Nouvel Empire (XVIIIe dynastie), sont caractérisées par une production de céramique spécifique pour chacune d'entre elles, dont l'étude permet d'établir une chronologie précise des différents sites qu'elles recouvrent, ainsi que l'étendue de l'influence du royaume sur la région et au-delà, pendant toute cette période de la haute Antiquité. La dernière période marque la transition entre la fin du royaume et l’occupation égyptienne.

Céramique
Dans le domaine de la céramique, les traits les plus caractéristiques, partie supérieure noir lustré et partie inférieure de couleur rouge d'oxyde de fer, relèvent de pratiques plus généralement employées dans une aire très vaste, qui va jusqu'à la culture de Nagada I (3900-3500), en Haute-Égypte. On recouvrait le vase par un engobe riche en oxyde de fer, qui allait donner la couleur rouge après cuisson. Mais avant cuisson cet engobe ayant été posé, le vase était soigneusement poli, ce qui allait produire, sur la partie noire ce bel effet métallique. Pour obtenir le noir, au moment de la cuisson, on enfonçait le vase retourné dans la cendre : cette zone allait cuire en réduction, c'est ce qui allait lui donner la couleur noire. Cette technique, a cessé d'être employée, au-dessous de la deuxième cataracte, après Nagada, mais elle a continué d'être employée au-dessus de la 2e cataracte, au Sud, en Nubie, et en particulier à Kerma. La bande blanche permet de dater les céramiques de la période dite « Kerma classique » (1750-1500).

Linguistique
Des éléments linguistiques indiquent que les peuples Kerma parlaient des langues afro-asiatiques de la branche couchitique. Le nobiin (nubien) contient aujourd'hui un certain nombre de mots clés liés au pastoralisme qui sont d'origine couchitique orientale. Ceci suggère que les populations du Kerma — qui, avec la culture du Groupe C, habitaient la vallée du Nil juste avant l'arrivée des premiers locuteurs nubiens — parlaient des langues chamito-sémitiques.

Anthropologie
L'analyse craniométrique des fossiles de Kerma a montré qu'ils étaient morphologiquement proches des Égyptiens prédynastiques de Nagada (4000-3200 avant notre ère) qui eux-mêmes sont étroitement apparentés à d'autres populations afro-asiatiques de la corne de l'Afrique. Les Kermans étant plus éloignés des Égyptiens dynastiques de Gizeh (-323/330) et des Égyptiens prédynastiques de Badari (-4400/-4000), à 300 km plus au Nord de Nagada.

Le site révélateur de l'histoire
La ville a été fouillée entre 1977 et 2002 par la mission archéologique suisse au Soudan.

Mésolithique et Néolithique
Ce site, du cours moyen du Nil soudanais, occupe, à cette époque une vaste plaine propice à l'agriculture et favorable à la sédentarisation de populations qui migrèrent dans la région dès le Mésolithique.
Le Nil ayant eu plusieurs cours situés plus à l'est de l'actuel, on rencontre à environ 10 km plus à l'est du site de pré-Kerma, un site, Boucharia, qui a apporté des témoins de l'émergence précoce de la poterie sur le continent africain, vers le IXe millénaire AEC. De la poterie non néolithique.
Sur un ancien bras du Nil qui s’écoulait à une dizaine de kilomètres à l’est du cours actuel, les sites d'El Barga (7500-5500) et Kadruka (5000-4000) ont livré plus d'une centaine de sites, avec des habitats et des cimetières. Toutes ces formes d'occupation se sont réparties en chapelets le long du cours d'eau. En particulier le site d'El Barga a révélé, un fonds de cabane mésolithique (7500-7200) et un cimetière de 41 tombes (entre 7800-7000). « Sur le même site mais plus au sud, un cimetière néolithique composé de 103 tombes, datées entre 6000 et 5500 av. J.-C. constitue aujourd’hui le premier cimetière néolithique connu sur le continent ».
Après une occupation mésolithique et néolithique constante (cimetières néolithiques de Kadruka) dans la région de Kerma, « un changement » est intervenu au début du quatrième millénaire « entraînant l’abandon ou le déclin des coutumes funéraires existantes, accompagné d’une délocalisation des sites ». Cette période correspond au développement du Prédynastique en Égypte, et cette proximité temporelle, singulière, reste inexpliquée en 2011.

IVe et première moitié du IIIe millénaire
L’agglomération pré-Kerma (3500-2500 AEC) apparait au milieu du quatrième millénaire avant notre ère à environ 5 km. à l'est de Kerma, et au centre de sa nécropole orientale. Les populations pratiquent l'élevage et se déplacent encore. Mais ce site indique le passage vers une sédentarité qui sera conditionnée par l'agriculture. Cette première agglomération se distingue par son architecture, issue d'une tradition d'Afrique noire : on y décèle l'emprise des palissades ainsi que des contreforts composés de pieux et de terre rapportée, organisés en arc de cercle ou en rangées parallèles. Ces palissades et contreforts ceinturent les huttes d'habitations, quelques bâtiments rectangulaires et les enclos à bétail ainsi que les fosses de stockage ou greniers enterrés. Plus surprenant à cette époque, on a la trace, nette, sur 200 m d'une fortification, large de 8 m.
Au milieu du troisième millénaire, la cité de Kerma est déjà très étendue. Une rue est à l'origine de la ville. Dans un sens, elle se dirige vers le port de Kerma, sur le Nil, dans l'autre sens, elle allait vers une autre ville, à 1 km, Doukki Gel où les derniers bâtiments découverts laissent à penser à une « influence » de l'Afrique centrale.
La ville s’est d’abord développée autour des résidences des puissants chefs du clan, qui contrôlaient la région et son commerce. Vers -2400, la ville est centrée autour d’un monumental édifice cultuel bâti en briques crues, nommé, aujourd'hui, la Deffufa. Il y a, en fait, deux Deffufa (« construction faite par l'homme ») à Kerma. La Deffufa occidentale a traversé 40 périodes de reconstruction. Elle a eu de nombreuses formes différentes qui ont été englobées par les reconstructions successives. À la fin de la période classique, elle a eu l’apparence d’un temple égyptien 
D’un plan rectangulaire de cinquante mètres de côté sur trente, pour une hauteur de plus de vingt mètres encore aujourd’hui, la Deffufa occidentale se trouve au centre d’une vaste enceinte également en brique, qui délimite un espace de plus de vingt hectares dans lequel plusieurs enclos contenaient d’autres structures : des habitats spacieux, des chapelles secondaires, des greniers, des ateliers et autres édifices caractéristiques d’une société organisée et hiérarchisée.
Les sépultures de l'époque ont livré un grand nombre d'objets manufacturés attestant le développement de la métallurgie du cuivre mais aussi du bronze, de l'artisanat en ébénisterie et en ivoire. Enfin, la production d'une céramique caractéristique de la région a permis d’établir plusieurs phases de datation du développement de Kerma et de sa civilisation.

Fin du IIIe millénaire
À la fin du troisième millénaire, les architectes remplacent peu à peu les matériaux organiques qui constituent les bâtiments officiels par de la brique, conservant par tradition les formes et proportions du plan initial. Des structures palatiales sont construites et le temple de la ville s'étend.
Les sépultures royales, beaucoup plus imposantes, comportent outre un riche mobilier funéraire, des tombes subsidiaires destinées à l'aristocratie d'alors. Ces tombes révèlent également que l'entourage immédiat du roi est « sacrifié » le jour de ses funérailles. Par cette pratique rituelle, il reçoit donc le « privilège » d'accompagner son souverain dans l'au-delà.

Le site de Kerma est alors en plein essor et de nombreuses constructions attestent l'existence d'une élite organisée autour de la monarchie. Kerma finit de soumettre l'ensemble de la région. Dès lors le royaume nubien et sa capitale représentent un danger pour les expéditions commerciales égyptiennes. Déjà à la fin de l’Ancien Empire, les expéditions menées par les nomarques d’Assouan font état de ces risques qu’il y avait à vouloir traverser la région sans compter avec les populations nubiennes. Néanmoins, les rapports avec l'Égypte sont, en général, harmonieux. Le commerce concerne l'or, l'ivoire, l'ébène et la gomme.
Cette situation engendra au Moyen Empire de fréquents conflits et l'extension du domaine égyptien au-delà de la seconde cataracte. Ils verrouillent leur position par de puissantes forteresses qui s'édifièrent le long du parcours du Nil en amont d'Assouan. En réaction, on assiste à Kerma à l'édification de puissantes murailles en briques protégeant la cité. Fossés, tours, poternes, tout l'arsenal des défenses fortifiées démontrent que le royaume entendait défendre sa place face à l'appétit grandissant de son voisin du nord.
Signe des temps, les sépultures contemporaines ont livré tout un arsenal qui accompagnait les défunts dans leur mort.
Pendant un temps l'équilibre des forces semble garantir à la capitale nubienne une certaine impunité et prospérité. À l'issue du Moyen Empire, il est d'ailleurs attesté que le royaume de Kerma a poussé son avantage jusqu'en Haute-Égypte, allant même jusqu'à passer une alliance avec les Hyksôs qui contrôlaient le delta du Nil. On a retrouvé un grand nombre d'objets d'origine égyptienne dans les fouilles de la cité, reliques probables de pillages que les troupes nubiennes ont ramenées dans leur capitale.

Guerre et occupation égyptienne au milieu du IIe millénaire
Cette alliance de la dernière chance ne suffit pas toutefois à éviter la réaction du royaume de Thèbes qui peu à peu gagne en puissance. Il parvient à repousser les coalisés et à reconquérir le terrain perdu au nord comme au sud inaugurant les grandes conquêtes de la XVIIIe dynastie. Dès les premiers règnes, les efforts sont alors concentrés sur la Nubie et les troupes de Pharaon mettent à sac toute la région.
Thoutmôsis Ier (r. 1504-1492) met le siège devant la capitale nubienne, qui cède à la pression. Les Égyptiens rasent ses fortifications, incendient ses maisons et pillent le palais royal et les temples de la cité. La cité et son royaume ne s’en relèveront pas.

Le Royaume de Koush / Kerma
Le Royaume de Kerma fut la première civilisation à unir les différentes régions de la Nubie, pays de l'or, et a tôt attisé les convoitises des pharaons, qui y multiplièrent les expéditions militaires et commerciales. Après le réveil de l'Égypte sous le Nouvel Empire, les troupes égyptiennes se sont étendues au sud. Sous le règne de Thoutmôsis Ier, vers -1520, toute la Nubie du nord était annexée.
Sous Thoutmôsis Ier, l'Égypte a fait plusieurs campagnes au sud. Cela a finalement abouti à l'annexion de la Nubie (Kerma / Koush) vers -1504. La situation s'inversera bien plus tard avec l'épisode des pharaons nubiens. Après la conquête, la culture Kerma fut de plus en plus « égyptienne », mais les rébellions se poursuivirent pendant 220 ans (jusqu'à environ -1300). Pendant le Nouvel Empire, le royaume de Kerma / Koush est devenu une province clé de l'Empire égyptien, économiquement, politiquement et spirituellement. De grandes cérémonies pharaoniques eurent lieu à Gebel Barkal près de Napata, et les lignées royales des deux régions semblent s'être mariées. L'étendue de la continuité culturelle et politique entre le royaume de Kerma et le royaume de Koush est difficile à déterminer au plan chronologique. Le royaume de Koush, plus égyptien, émergea, peut-être de Kerma, et retrouva l'indépendance de la région vis-à-vis de l'Égypte au cours de la Troisième Période intermédiaire (-1085 / -750). Se constitua alors dans le bassin du Nil moyen un « empire koushite » qui allait perdurer durant quelque mille ans. Cette période est traditionnellement divisée en deux époques : celle de Napata, qui a duré de -750 à -300, et celle de Méroé, qui a duré de -300 à 340. Initialement, les rois kouchites continuèrent à utiliser Kerma pour les enterrements royaux et les cérémonies spéciales, ce qui suggère une certaine connexion. De plus, l'aménagement des enceintes funéraires royales de Kerma et de Napata (la capitale de Koush) est conçu de la même manière. Des caches de statues des pharaons de Koush ont également été découvertes à Kerma, suggérant que les dirigeants napatéens reconnaissaient un lien historique fort entre leur capitale et Kerma.

Suakin or Sawakin (Arabic: سواكن, romanized: Sawākin, Beja: Oosook) is a port city in northeastern Sudan, on the west coast of the Red Sea. It was formerly the region's chief port, but is now secondary to Port Sudan, about 50 kilometres (30 mi) north.
Suakin used to be considered the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea, but the old city built of coral is now in ruins. In 1983, the adjacent historic mainland town, known as the Geyf, had a population of 18,030 and the 2009 population was estimated at 43,337. Ferries run daily from Suakin to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.

Etymology
The Beja name for Suakin is Oosook. This is possibly from the Arabic word suq, meaning market. In Beja, the locative case for this is isukib, whence Suakin might have derived. The spelling on Admiralty charts in the late 19th century was "Sauakin", but in the popular press "Suakim" was predominant.

History
Ancient
Suakin was likely Ptolemy's Port of Good Hope, Limen Evangelis, which is similarly described as lying on a circular island at the end of a long inlet. Under the Ptolemies and Romans, though, the Red Sea's major port was Berenice to the north. The growth of the Muslim caliphate shifted trade first to the Hijaz and then to the Persian Gulf.

Medieval
The collapse of the Abbasids and growth of Fatimid Egypt changed this and Al-Qusayr and Aydhab became important emporia, trading with India and ferrying African pilgrims to Mecca. Suakin was first mentioned by name in the 10th century by al-Hamdani, who says it was already an ancient town. At that time, Suakin was a small Beja settlement, but it began to expand after the abandonment of the port of Badi to its south. The Crusades and Mongol invasions drove more trade into the region: there are a number of references to Venetian merchants residing at Suakin and Massawa as early as the 14th century.

One of Suakin's rulers, Ala al-Din al-Asba'ani, angered the Mamluk sultan Baybars by seizing the goods of merchants who died at sea nearby. In 1264, the governor of Qus and his general Ikhmin Ala al-Din attacked with the support of Aydhab. Al-Asba'ani was forced to flee the city. The continuing enmity between the two towns is testified to by reports that after the destruction of Aydhab by Sultan Barsbay in 1426, the refugees, who fled to Suakin instead of Dongola, were all slaughtered.
Despite the town's formal submission to the Mamluks in 1317, O. G. S. Crawford believed that the city remained a center of Christianity into the 13th century. Muslim immigrants such as the Banu Kanz gradually transformed this: Ibn Battuta records that in 1332, there was a Muslim "sultan" of Suakin, al-Sharif Zaid ibn-Abi Numayy ibn-'Ajlan, who was the son of a Meccan sharif. Following the region's inheritance laws, he had inherited the local leadership from his Bejan maternal uncles. With the decline of Mamluk power in the late 14th century, the Hedareb tribe took over the port city and made it their capital. Suakin then established itself as the most important north east African port along the Red Sea. In the fifteenth century, Suakin was briefly part of the Adal Sultanate. Suakin was sieged by the Portuguese in 1513 and captured briefly in 1541.

Ottoman
Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, the Ottoman Empire became the major power in the Red Sea. After a brief period of Ottoman-Portuguese struggles in the Red Sea, Özdemir Pasha occupied Suakin in the early 1550s. Though it was only loosely controlled, until the Ottoman province of Habesh was established in 1555 with the residence of its pasha in Suakin. The Ottomans restored the two main mosques - Shafi'i and Hanafi, strengthened the walls of the fort and built new roads and buildings. As the Portuguese explorers discovered and perfected the sea route around Africa and the Ottomans were unable to stop this trade, the local merchants began to abandon the town.
Some trade was kept up with the Sultanate of Sennar, but by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found two-thirds of the homes in ruins. The Khedive Isma'il received Suakin from the Ottomans in 1865 and attempted to revitalize it: Egypt built new houses, mills, mosques, hospitals, and a church for immigrant Copts.

British rule
The British Army was involved at Suakin in 1883–1885 and Lord Kitchener was there in this period leading the Egyptian Army contingent. Suakin was his headquarters and his force survived a lengthy siege there.
The Australian colonial forces of Victoria offered their torpedo boat HMVS Childers and gunboats HMVS Victoria and HMVS Albert, which arrived in Suakin on 19 March 1884 on their delivery voyage from Britain, only to be released as fighting had moved inland. They departed on 23 March, arriving in Melbourne on 25 June 1884. An essentially civilian military force of 770 men from New South Wales, including some of the Naval Brigade, arrived in Suakin in March 1885 and served until mid-May.

After the defeat of the Mahdist State, the British preferred to develop the new Port Sudan, rather than engage in the extensive rebuilding and expansion that would have been necessary to make Suakin comparable. By 1922, the last of the British had left.

21st century
Since 2000, Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums has undertaken research and documented the history of Suakin, and in 2022, the online project Sudan Memory published historical photographs, architectural drawings and a 3D reconstruction of the town on its website.
On 17 January 2018, as part of a rapprochement with Sudan, Turkey was granted a 99-year lease over Suakin island. Turkey plans to restore the ruined Ottoman port city on the island.
On 12 June 2022, some 15,000 sheep drowned in the sinking of the Badr 1 in the port of Suakin.

Buildings of Suakin
The buildings of Suakin were largely constructed of madrepore, or rock-coral, taken from the sea-bed. The vernacular style of construction under the Ottomans was akin to that of Jiddah in Arabia and Mitsiwa in Ethiopia. The houses, which had a white plaster finish, were up to four storeys in height and often built in blocks or terraces of three or more, separated by narrow streets. They had large casement windows (Arab. rushān) and doors of Java teak surmounted by carved stone door-hoods and denticulated parapets. From the 1860s an Egyptian style of architecture began to incorporate features from Egypt and Europe. As the buildings had no plaster covering, they decayed quickly and the town fell into ruin.
A detailed description of the buildings of Suakin, including measured plans and detailed sketches, can be found in The Coral Buildings of Suakin: Islamic Architecture, Planning, Design and Domestic Arrangements in a Red Sea Port by Jean-Pierre Greenlaw, Kegan Paul International, 1995, ISBN 0-7103-0489-7.

Climate
Suakin has a very hot desert climate (Köppen BWh) with brutally hot and humid, though dry, summers and very warm winters. Rainfall is minimal except from October to December, when easterly winds can give occasional downpours: in November 1965 as much as 445 millimetres (17.5 in) fell, but in the whole year from July 1981 to June 1982 no more than 3 millimetres (0.1 in) was recorded.

Suakin, Sawakin ou Souakim (arabe : سواكن - Sawākīn) est un port soudanais sur la mer Rouge. Il a été construit sur une île de 20 km2, rattachée au continent par une digue depuis le xixe siècle.
À l’origine, Suakin était le port principal de la région, mais, depuis quelques années, il est dépassé par Port-Soudan qui se trouve environ 60 kilomètres au nord.
L’ancienne ville, construite principalement en corail est fréquemment citée dans la littérature. Rimbaud y a notamment travaillé. Plusieurs marchands, dont des coptes, avaient des résidences secondaires à Suakin.

Géographie
Histoire
Antiquité
Le site correspond à peu près à l'emplacement de "Ptolémaïs Thérôn" (ou Thérân), que donne Le Périple de la mer Érythrée.
D'autres noms sont donnés : Limen Evangelis, Evangelon Portus, Port de Bonne espérance.

Moyen Âge
L'archéologue britannique Osbert Crawford pense que la ville était un foyer important du christianisme au XIIIe siècle en particulier comme point de départ pour les pèlerins désirant se rendre à Jérusalem.

Période ottomane
En 1517, le sultan Selim Ier prend la ville qui devient, pour les cinquante années suivantes, la résidence du pacha (gouverneur) de l’Empire ottoman pour l'eyalet d’Abyssinie ("Habeş Eyaleti" en turc).

Suakin et les guerres mahdistes (fin du XIXe siècle)
XXe siècle
Jusqu'au début du XXe siècle, Suakin qui était alors l'un des principaux ports de commerce de la région, ainsi qu'un important point de passage pour les pèlerins se rendant à La Mecque perd de son attrait au profit de Port-Soudan, situé à 60 kilomètres plus au nord que les britanniques ont fondé en 1905 et dont les installations portuaires sont capables d’accueillir des navires de gros tonnage. La ville délaissée tombe alors en ruine.

XXIe siècle
Dans le cadre d’un partenariat stratégique avec le Soudan, Khartoum, le 26 décembre 2017, a cédé à la Turquie la souveraineté sur l'île de Suakin, jadis garnison ottomane sur la mer Rouge, via un bail de 99 ans, afin que les turcs puissent restaurer les lieux où l'héritage architectural ottoman est omniprésent, et y construire également une port en eau profonde à usage civil et militaire.

Littérature
La ville apparaît dans le roman Bakhita (2017), de Véronique Olmi.

## Overview
Suakin is a port city in Northern Sudan. Once considered the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea, the old city built of coral is now in ruins.

## Understand
Suakin was likely Ptolemy's Port of Good Hope, Limen Evangelis, which is similarly described as lying on a circular island at the end of a long inlet. Suakin was first mentioned by name in the 10th century by al-Hamdani, who says it was already an ancient town. At that time, Suakin was a small Beja settlement, but it began to expand after the abandonment of the port of Badi to its south. The Beja were originally Christian. Despite the town's formal submission to the Muslim Mamluks in 1317, O. G. S. Crawford believed that the city remained a center of Christianity into the 13th century. Muslim immigrants such as the Banu Kanz gradually transformed this: Ibn Battuta records that in 1332, there was a Muslim "sultan" of Suakin, al-Sharif Zaid ibn-Abi Numayy ibn-'Ajlan, who was the son of a Meccan sharif. Suakin was sieged by the Portuguese in 1513 and captured briefly in 1541.
Ottoman sultan Selim I nominally added the port to the territory of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, though it was only loosely controlled, until the Ottoman province of Habesh was established in 1555 with the residence of its pasha in Suakin. The Ottomans restored the two main mosques – Shafi'i and Hanafi, strengthened the walls of the fort and built new roads and buildings – but by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found two-thirds of the homes in ruins and described it as a place of "ill-faith, avarice, drunkenness and debauchery". The Khedive Isma'il of Egypt received Suakin from the Ottomans in 1865 and attempted to revitalize it, building new houses, mills, mosques, hospitals, and a church for immigrant Copts.
The British Army was involved at Suakin in 1883–1885 and Lord Kitchener was there in this period leading the Egyptian Army contingent. Suakin was his headquarters and his force survived a lengthy siege in the city. After the defeat of the Mahdist State, the British preferred to develop the new Port Sudan, rather than engage in the extensive rebuilding and expansion that would have been necessary to make Suakin comparable. By 1922, the last of the British had left.
Since 2000, Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums has undertaken research and documented the history of Suakin, and in 2022, the online project Sudan Memory published historical photographs, architectural drawings and a 3D reconstruction of the town on its website. In January 2018, as part of a rapprochement with Sudan, Turkey was granted a 99-year lease over Suakin Island. Turkey plans to restore the ruined Ottoman port city on the island.

Omdurman (Arabic: أم درمان, romanized: Umm Durmān) is a major city in Sudan. It is the second most populous city in the country, located in the State of Khartoum. Omdurman lies on the west bank of the River Nile, opposite and northwest of the capital city of Khartoum. The city acts as an important road hub, with the Nile boosting transportation even further.

Etymology
The name Omdurman (Umm Durmān) literally translates as "Mother of Durmān", but who she was or might have been is unknown.

History
After the siege of Khartoum, followed by the building of the tomb of the Mahdi after his death from typhus, the city grew rapidly. However, in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 (which actually took place in the nearby village of Kerreri), Lord Kitchener decisively defeated the Mahdist forces. The following year British forces defeated Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, the Khalifa, as the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat; ensuring British control over the Sudan.
In September 1898, the British army of twenty thousand well drilled men equipped with the latest arms, Maxim guns and Martini-Henry rifles under the command of General Horatio Herbert Kitchener invaded Sudan. In the battle of Omdurman, the British Army faced Sudanese defenders consisting of over 52,000 poorly armed desert tribesmen dervishes; in the space of five hours the battle was over. The Sudanese defenders suffered many casualties, with at least 10,000 killed. By contrast there were fewer than four hundred casualties on the British side with forty-eight British soldiers losing their lives. Then, General Kitchener proceeded to order the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb and in the words of Winston Churchill, "carried off the Mahdi's head in a kerosene can as a trophy".
Kitchener restored Khartoum as the capital and, from 1899 until 1956 Sudan was jointly governed by Great Britain and Egypt. Although most of the city was destroyed in the battle, the Mahdi's tomb was restored and refurbished.
On 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group of the Justice and Equality Movement moved into the city where they engaged in heavy fighting with Sudanese government forces. Their goal was to topple Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government.
During the Sudanese civil war, the city was occupied by the Rapid Support Forces between April 2023 and May 2025.

Climate
Omdurman features a hot arid climate, with only the summer months seeing noticeable precipitation. The city averages a little over 155 millimetres (6.1 in) of precipitation per year. Based on annual mean temperatures, the city is one of the hottest major cities in the world. Temperatures routinely exceed 40 °C (104 °F) in mid-summer.
Its average annual high temperature is 37.1 °C (99 °F), with six months of the year seeing an average monthly high temperature of at least 38 °C (100 °F). Furthermore, throughout the year, none of its monthly average high temperatures falls below 30 °C (86 °F). During the months of January and February, while daytime temperatures are generally very warm, nights are relatively cool, with average low temperatures just above 15 °C (59 °F).

Airport
Khartoum Airport serves Omdurman.

New Khartoum International Airport
According to Sudanese officials, in 2005 a new airport facility had been proposed 30 miles (50 km) south of Omdurman. Arguably speaking to be within the non-defined boundaries of Omdurman, the project was estimated to be completed by 2012 with an estimated budget of $530 million.
Construction began in 2019 but as of 2021 had been suspended.
Omdurman's location in the center of the country, almost within the national capital, facilitates its connection to all the capitals and cities of the various states of Sudan, by land via paved roads and seasonal roads. Within the city, transportation varies from yellow taxis, city buses, and other buses of various sizes, known as "buses." Three-wheeled motorcycles, known as "tuk-tuks" and known in Khartoum as "raqshas," are also used, in addition to trains and Nile ferries.[1]
Omdurman is one of the three capital cities and is therefore connected to Khartoum and Khartoum Bahri by several bridges built over the Blue and White Nile rivers.

Omdourman (ou Omdurman, en arabe: أم درمان,) située sur le Nil, en face de la capitale, Khartoum, est la plus grande ville du Soudan. Elle comptait 2,4 millions d'habitants en 2009. Elle forme avec Khartoum et Bahri le centre culturel et industriel du pays. La ville constitue un important carrefour routier, le Nil stimulant encore davantage les transports.

Histoire
En 1884, Muhammad Ahmad ibn Abd Allah Al-Mahdi, le « Mahdi », fait construire son quartier militaire dans le village d'Omdourman. 
La ville abrite son tombeau.
En 1898, les Britanniques menés par le général Kitchener défont les troupes mahdistes à la bataille d'Omdurman, assurant la conquête du Soudan anglo-égyptien. Winston Churchill, qui a participé à la bataille, en tirera un livre à succès, La guerre du fleuve.
Le 10 mai 2008, le groupe rebelle du Mouvement pour la justice et l'égalité (MJE) du Darfour a investi la ville et engagé de violents combats avec les forces gouvernementales soudanaises. Son objectif était de renverser le gouvernement d'Omar Hassan el-Béchir.
Pendant la guerre civile soudanaise, la bataille d'Omdurman a éclaté.

Climat
Omdurman bénéficie d'un climat chaud et aride, avec des précipitations notables uniquement pendant les mois d'été. La ville reçoit en moyenne un peu plus de 155 millimètres de précipitations par an. D'après les températures moyennes annuelles, la ville est l'une des grandes villes les plus chaudes du monde. Les températures dépassent régulièrement les 40 °C au milieu de l'été.
Sa température maximale annuelle moyenne est de 37,1 °C, avec une température maximale mensuelle moyenne d'au moins 38 °C pendant six mois de l'année. De plus, tout au long de l'année, aucune de ses températures maximales mensuelles moyennes ne descend en dessous de 30 °C. En janvier et février, si les températures diurnes sont généralement très chaudes, les nuits sont relativement fraîches, avec des températures minimales moyennes légèrement supérieures à 15 °C.

Éducation
Omdourman compte de nombreux établissements d'enseignement, dont l'université islamique d'Omdourman.

Sport
Omdourman compte trois équipes de football : Al Hilal Omdurman, Al Merreikh Omdurman et Al Mourada Omdurman.
Le stade Al Meirreikh d'Omdurman abrita le 18 novembre 2009 le match Algérie-Égypte pour l'ultime journée de qualification à la coupe du monde de football 2010 et qui s'est soldé par la victoire de l'Algérie 1-0. La population de la ville a chaleureusement accueilli les deux sélections.

Aéroport
Selon les responsables soudanais, un nouvel aéroport avait été proposé en 2005 à 50 km au sud d'Omdurman. Se situant vraisemblablement dans les limites non définies d'Omdurman, le projet devait être achevé en 2012, avec un budget estimé à 530 millions de dollars. Les travaux ont débuté en 2019, mais étaient suspendus en 2021.
La situation d'Omdurman au centre du pays, presque au cœur de la capitale nationale, facilite sa liaison avec toutes les capitales et villes des différents États du Soudan, par voie terrestre via des routes goudronnées et des routes saisonnières. En ville, les transports varient: taxis jaunes, bus urbains et autres autobus de différentes tailles, appelés « bus ». Des motos à trois roues, appelées « tuk-tuks » et « raqshas » à Khartoum, sont également utilisées, ainsi que les trains et les ferries sur le Nil.
Omdurman est l'une des trois capitales et est donc reliée à Khartoum et Khartoum Bahri par plusieurs ponts construits sur les fleuves Nil Bleu et Nil Blanc.

Militaire
La base aérienne de Wadi Sayyidna est la principale des forces armées soudanaises.

Personnalités
Josef Ohrwalder (1856-1913), missionnaire autrichien mort à Omdourman.
Hawa Jah Al Rasoul ou Hawa al-Tagtaga (1926-2012), chanteuse et militante soudanaise,
Khalida Zahir (1927 – 2015), médecin et militante féministe soudanaise.
Fatima Abdel Mahmoud (1945-2018), femme politique soudanaise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Khalifa House Museum is an ethnographic museum, located opposite the tomb of  Muhammad Ahmad in the city of Omdurman in Sudan. Towards the end of the 19th century, it was the residence of the successor of the Mahdi, Khalifa Abdallahi ibn Muhammad and the headquarters of the administration of the Mahdi State. The House was converted into a museum in 1928 during the Anglo-Egyptian condominium.

The historical building
The Khalifa House is a low, two-storied building with a series of linked courtyards. The ground floor was built in 1888 and the upper floor in 1891. Its traditional mudbrick structure is of great historical importance, since it exhibits the style and architecture prevailing at the period.

The ethnographic museum
The Khalifa House Museum contains artefacts relating to the Mahdist state (1885–1898), such as suits of mail, Mahdist coins, flimsy banknotes issued by Gordon during the Siege of Khartoum, swords and personal belongings of the Khalifa. Some rooms are dedicated to the Battle of Omdurman showcasing rifles, a Maxim automatic gun, banners, spears and robes obtained from the battle field. The collection also includes photographs of Khartoum during this time and its subsequent occupation by the British.
The courtyards house other historical items, such as the cupola saved from the ruins of the original Mahdi's tomb and also the first car in Sudan, an Arrol-Johnston motor tractor.

Restoration
In 2018, the Khalifa House Museum was awarded funding by the British Council for the Western Sudan Community Museums Project. During the two-year funding period, the building and its extensive collection were restored. Staff were given training in material conservation, collection management, storage and protection of the displays. The collections were photographed and digitised, and this data was shared with another British Council Cultural Protection Funded project, Sudan Memory. This project is a British-Sudanese cooperation with the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) of Sudan.
Reports in September 2024 suggested that the museum had been looted in the context of the Sudanese civil war. Among the items missing were the swords used Osman Digna and Abd al-Rahman al-Nujoumi during the Mahdist War.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Khartoum, also spelled Khartum, is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.
Khartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North (الخرطوم بحري al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī) and Omdurman (أم درمان Umm Durmān) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as al-Mogran or al-Muqran (المقرن; English: "The Confluence").
Khartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.
In 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.
In 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.
Khartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.

Etymology
The origin of the word Khartoum is uncertain. Some Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words khar-tuom (Dinka-Bor dialect) or khier-tuom (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to "place where rivers meet". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.
One folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic khurṭūm (خرطوم 'trunk' or 'hose'), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. 
Captain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic qurṭum (قرطم 'safflower', i.e., Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word Agartum, meaning "the abode of Atum", Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest Khartoum is derived from the Beja word hartoom, "meeting". Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, khartoum means "we have acquired" and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.

History
19th century
In 1821, Khartoum was established 24 km (15 mi) north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma'il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.
A significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city's public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry "that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town". 
On 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and the entire garrison was annihilated. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. 
With the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was established as the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Herbert Kitchener became Governor-General of the Sudan in September 1898, and began a programme of reconstruction, Khartoum was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape. He ordered the mosques of Khartoum rebuilt and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens. He also prevented Christian missionaries from trying to proselytize the local Muslims.

20th century
The city rapidly grew and developed under British administration. Under Reginald Wingate (1899–1916), the Governor-General's Palace in Khartoum was rebuilt using red bricks, with sandstone used for the corners. The buildings in Khartoum proper were modeled after Victorian architecture, with a distinct Middle Eastern influence as well as Mediterranean-style windows and balconies. The Gordon Memorial College (now the University of Khartoum) was opened in 1903, and a new railway to Port Sudan was completed in 1919. These developments prompted large migration from rural areas, resulting in an increase in the city's population. By 1930, Khartoum was estimated to have a population of over 50,000.
Khartoum continued to grow after it was declared the capital of the newly independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. Within the following years, the Municipal Stadium, the Khartoum American School and the Bank of Sudan would be established. This large scale development would spurred rural to urban migration, by 1964 Khartoum's population had ballooned to 185,000. In the 1973 census Khartoum would have a population of 334,000 inhabitants.
In 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: "The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat."
In 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed. The Organization of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur – fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict – have settled around Khartoum.
In 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.
In November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five "Peace Camps" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and "the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat". Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.

21st century
The sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.
The African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.
On 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir's government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.
On 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.
On 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.
On 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.
On 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.
On 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, which the RSF claimed to have captured. The Sudanese Armed Forces regained full control of Khartoum on 26 March 2025.

Geography
Location
Khartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. 
Khartoum is relatively flat, at elevation 385 m (1,263 ft), as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation 364 m (1,194 ft) about 163 km (101 mi) away.

Climate
Khartoum features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert's vast arid areas and the Sahel's vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than 5 mm (0.20 in). The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.
The very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about 48 mm (1.9 in). The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only 121.3 mm (4.78 in) of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with 10 mm (0.39 in) or more and 19 days with 1 mm (0.039 in) or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed 39 °C (102 °F) in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above 15 °C (59 °F). Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around 30 °C (86 °F). The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below 30 °C (86 °F). This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.

Demographics
Almost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.

Economy
After the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.
In the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.
Among the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.

Retailing
The Souq al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.
Al Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.
Afra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.
In 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.

Education
Khartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:

Kindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consisting of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).
Elementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.
Upper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students' ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.
Higher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the University of Khartoum and Sudan University of Science and Technology.

Transportation
Khartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.
Khartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.

Khartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.
Khartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.

Architecture
The architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.
Since independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.

Culture
Museums
The largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.
The Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints' cathedral on Sharia al-Jama'a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.
The Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama'a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.

Botanical gardens
Khartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.

Clubs
Khartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, the Coptic Club, the Syrian Club and the International Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.

Places of worship
The places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew's Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).

In popular culture
Literature
Khartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in "Reading Khartoum", the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.

الْخَرْطُوْم هيَ عاصمة السُّودان وحاضرة ولاية الخرطُوم، تقع عند نقطة التقاء النّيل الأبيض بالنّيل الأزرق (المقرن)، ليُشكلا معاً نهر النيل. وهي مركز الحكم في السُّودان حيث يوجد فيها مقر رئيس الجمهورية والحكومة، ورئاسة الوزارات المركزية المختلفة وقيادة القوات المسلحة السودانية والبعثات الدبلوماسية الأجنبية من سفارات وقنصليات، ومقر بعض المنظمات الإقليمية العربية والإفريقية ومعظم المؤسسات السياسية للدولة. وهي قلب أفريقيا بالنسبة لخطوط الطيران، وذلك لمرور خطوط الطيران التي تقطع شمال القارة تجاه جنوبها وتلك التي تمر عبر غرب القارة وشرقها. يوجد بالمدينة العديد من الجامعات والكليات الحكومية والخاصة والمؤسسات التعليمية المختلفة ورئاسات الشركات والبنوك الوطنية وفروع الشركات الأجنبية.
يرجع تاريخ تأسيس الخرطوم كعاصمة، إلى العقود الأولى من القرن التاسع عشر أثناء فترة الحكم العثماني المصري في السودان حيثُ اتخذت عاصمة للبلاد، إلا أن تاريخها كموقع استيطان بشري أبعد من ذلك بكثير فقد سكنها الإنسان منذ العصر الحجري، كما كان موقعها موطن حضارة قديمة عُرفت بمملكة علوة وشهد القَرن الماضي أول مرحلة من مراحل ازدهارها عندما شُيّدت العمارة في العهد البريطاني المصري على النسق المعماري الإنجليزي والذي لا يزال ماثلاً للعيان في الأبنية القديمة بجامعة الخرطوم ومبنى وزارة المالية ومصلحة البريد والبرق وبعض المرافق الحكومية المطلة على النيل وتحول بعضها إلى متاحف مفتوحة للجمهور، وفي بعض الجسور القديمة المقامة على نهر النيل والتي تربطها بما يحيط بها من مناطق حضرية. يبلغ عدد سكان مدينة الخرطوم 2,682,431 نسمة، وهي بذلك سادس مدينة من حيث عدد السكان في إفريقيا (ولا يشمل الرقم باقي سكان العاصمة المثلثة البالغ عددهم 5,172,000 تقريباً) ويمثل سكانها مختلف الإثنيات والمجموعات السكانية من داخل السودان وخارجه بالإضافة إلى أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين وغيرهم من الوافدين السياسيين، والمناخ في الخرطوم معتدل في فصل الشتاء مع ارتفاع في درجات الحرارة في الصيف وهطول أمطار غزيرة في موسم الخريف، وتتميز المدينة بموقعها الإستراتيجي في وسط السودان حيث التقاء النيل الأزرق بالنيل الأبيض، الذي جعل منها منطقة جذب سياحي تزخر بالمعالم الطبيعية والأثرية، ومحور نقل واتصالات محليّة وإقليمية.

الخرطوم الكبرى
يتعين التمييز بين الخرطوم العاصمة القومية أو  العاصمة المثلثة كما يطلق عليها أحياناً، والخرطوم الولاية، وبينهما وبين الخرطوم المدينة، أو الخرطوم عموم كما تسمى. ويقصد بالعاصمة المثلثة التجمع الميتروبوليتي المتكوّن من المدن الثلاث التي تنتشر فيها المصالح والدواوين الحكومية وترتبط مع بعضها البعض جغرافياً وإدارياً واجتماعياً، وهي الخرطوم عموم الواقعة على الضفة الجنوبية والغربية للنيل الأزرق والضفة الشرقية للنيل الأبيض، والمدينة الثانية هي أم درمان وتقع على الضفة الغربية للنيل الأبيض ونهر النيل أي المجرى الذي يتكون من النيلين الأزرق والأبيض بعد التقائهما عند نقطة المقرن. والمدينة الثالثة هي الخرطوم بحري (أي الخرطوم شمال، كما تسمى باللغة الإنجليزية. لفظ بحري باللهجة المصرية يرادف لفظ شمال بالفصحى) وتقع على الضفة الشمالية للنيل الأزرق والضفة الشرقية لنهر النيل. وأما الخرطوم الولاية، أي ولاية الخرطوم فهذه تشمل المدن الثلاث وضواحيها وبعض المناطق المحيطة بها وهي إحدى ولايات السودان.

أصل التسمية
اختلفت الروايات حول سبب تسمية المدينة بهذا الاسم وحول أصل التسمية ومعنى اللفظ. فهناك من يقول بأن التسمية ترجع إلى شكل قطعة الأرض التي تقع عليها المدينة والتي يشقها نهري النيل ويلتقيان فيها مع بعضهما في شكل انحنائي يرسمان بينهما قطعة أرض أشبه بخرطوم الفيل وهو الرأي الراجح،
إلا أن الرحالة البريطاني كابتن جيمس جرانت الذي رافق الكابتن جون اسبيك في رحلته الاستكشافية لمنابع النيل ذكر بأن الاسم مشتق من زهرة القرطم التي كانت تزرع بكثافة في المنطقة لتصديرها إلى مصر لاستخراج الزيت منها للإنارة وقد استخدمها الرومان عند غزوهم لمصر ووصولهم إلى شمال السودان حيث عثروا على زهرة القرطم في موقع الخرطوم الحالي واستخدموا الزيت المستخرج من حبوبها في علاج جروح جنودهم. وهناك أيضاً تفسيرات أخرى للاسم لا سند لها مثل «خور التوم» نسبة إلى شخص يدعى التوم.
والخرطوم في اللغة هو الأنف من الإنسان، حيث قال تعالى: (إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءاياتُنَا قَالَ أَسَاطِيرُ الأَوَّلِينَ سَنَسِمُهُ عَلَى الْخُرْطُومِ)،(قرأن كريم، سورة القلم، آية 15، 16) أي سوف نجعل له الوسم بالسواد على أنفه، وقيل على وجهه فيكون له وسمة. وقال قتادة سنسمه على الخرطوم بمعنى أن نضع سيما على أنفه. والمعنى من الآيات هو الوليد بن المغيرة.
والخرطوم هو أيضاً اسم لأنف السبع أو الفيل وهو ما يتماشى لغوياُ مع معنى تسمية الخرطوم.

التاريخ
أُسست الخرطوم كمدينة على يد الجيش العثماني في عهد محمد علي باشا عندما أرسل جيشه لضم السودان إلى مُلكه بقيادة ابنه الثالث إسماعيل كامل باشا عام 1821م، واتخذها الأتراك في البداية معسكراً لجيوشهم ثم تحولت إلى عاصمة لهم في عهد عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي عام 1824م وذلك بعد تعيينه حكمدارا (حاكماً) على السودان خلفا للحكمدار محمد بك خسرو الدفتردار.

التاريخ القديم
يعود تاريخ الخرطوم كمستوطنة بشرية إلى عصور سحيقة حيث أكدت المستحثات على أن الإنسان قد استوطن في موقع الخرطوم الحالي منذ سنة 400 قبل الميلاد، وتم العثور على أدوات تعود إلى العصر الحجري في منطقة خور أبو عنجة في مدينة أم درمان الحالية القريبة من الخرطوم، إضافة إلى بقايا أثرية لمستوطنات يرجع تاريخها إلى عهد مملكتي نبتة ومروي في الفترة من 750 قبل الميلاد إلى 350 بعد الميلاد.
وتقول مصادر أخرى ترجع في تاريخها إلى القرن السادس عشر الميلادي بأن المكان الذي تقوم عليه الآن الخرطوم كان عبارة عن أحراش وغابات، وكان يبعد عن مدينة سوبا عاصمة مملكة علوة، إحدى الممالك المسيحية القديمة في السودان، حوالي 24 كيلومتر (15 ميل). وفي القرن السادس عشر قام سكان جزيرة توتي التي تقع في مجري نهر النيل المقابل للمكان - وكانوا ينتمون إلى قبيلة (المحس) النوبية - بزراعة المكان، قبل أن يقيم فيه أحد فقهائهم ويدعى الشيخ أرباب العقائد مدرسة لتعليم القرآن ويتحول تدريجياً إلى منطقة سكنية.

الممالك المسيحية
ورد ذكر سوبا باعتبارها عاصمة لمملكة علوة وهي الآن المنطقة الجنوبية للخرطوم في كتب عدد من الرحالة العرب والمسلمين، فقد ذكرها اليعقوبي بقوله «والمملكة الثانية من النوبة الذين يقال لهم علوة وفي سنة 360 هجرية (970، ميلادية) زار منطقة الخرطوم أحمد بن حوقل، ودون في كتابه صورة الأرض أنه تجول في منطقة سوبا وذكر بأن بها جماعة من المسلمين، كما وصف منطقة النيل الأبيض وقال: «من وراء النيل نهر عظيم يسمى بحر أبيض سكانه جنس من النوبة» وصف ابن حوقل سوبا بأنها «أوسع من الحبشة وعمارتها أكثر مما بالحبشة، ويخترق نيل مصر فيما بين مدنهم ونواحيهم. وقراهم عامرة خصبة كثيرة التمر والزرع والخضر. ومن أعمر بلادهم نواحي علوة وهي ناحية لها قرى متصلة وعمارات مشتبكة حتى إن السائر ليجتاز في الرحلة الواحدة بقرى عدة غير متقطعة الحدود، ذوات مياه متصلة بسواق من النيل»، كذلك كتب عنها ابن سليم الأسواني في القرن العاشر الميلادي وقال إن «المسافة ما بين دنقلة إلى أول بلد علوة، أكثر مما بينها وأسوان. وفي ذلك من القرى والضياع والجزائر والمواشي والنخل والشجر والمقل الزرع والكرم، أضعاف ما في الجانب الذي يلي أرض الإسلام.. ومتملك علوة أكثر مالاً من متملك المقرة وأعظم جيشاً، وعنده من الخيل ما ليس عند المقرى، وبلده أخصب وأوسع»، أما أبو صالح الأرمني فقد ذكر عن سوبا بأن «بها جيش ومملكة عظيمة جداً وأعمال متسعة، وبها أربعمائة كنيسة. وهذه المدينة في شرقي الجزيرة الكبيرة بين البحرين الأبيض والأخضر، وجميع من بها نصارى يعاقبة، حولها ديارات متباعدة من البحر، ومنها ما هو على البحر، وبها كنيسة عظيمة جداً متسعة محكمة الوضع والبناء» هذه الكتابات تدل على أن منطقة الخرطوم كانت منطقة حضارة مزدهرة إبان العصر المسيحي في السودان، وقبل تخريبها من قبل جحافل الفونج حتى أصبح «خراب سوبا» مضرب أمثال شعبية في السودان.
ولا يعرف الكثير عن الخرطوم في عصر الفونج الذين أسسوا مُلكهم في السودان بتحالف مع قبائل العبدلاب واقاموا عاصمتهم في سنار، سوى استمرار مدارسها وخلاويها القرآنية في تدريس علوم الدين وأبرزها مدرسة اسلانج القرآنية بجزيرة إسلانج الواقعة في شمال مدينة الخرطوم وقد تأسس بها أول مسجد هو مسجد حمد النجيض الجموعي في عهد عجيب المانجلك واشتهرت بتعليم القرآن وتوافد اتباع الطريقة القادرية إحدى الطرق الصوفية الرئيسية في السودان.

العهد العثماني (1821- 1885)
يبدأ التاريخ الحديث لمدينة الخرطوم مع مجيء الجيش العثماني لإيالة مصر إلى السودان بقيادة إسماعيل كامل باشا ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، والذي حط رحاله عليها وهو في طريقه إلى سنار عاصمة السلطنة الزرقاء التي كانت تحكم تلك المناطق في عام 1821م، وأقام فيها معسكراً لجنوده على بعد ميل واحد (1,6 كيلومتر) من ضفة النهر وفي منطقة السكة الحديدية الحالية، ولكنه اختار أولاً مدينة ود مدني الواقعة بين سنار والخرطوم عاصمة جديدة للبلاد. ولم يطب المقام للأتراك في مدينة ود مدني بسبب مناخها الجاف، ولذلك عندما جاء الأميرالاي عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي، الذي عُيّن حاكماً على السودان (1823 - 1825) م ومر على ملتقى النيلين (الأزرق والأبيض) وهو في طريقه إلى العاصمة ود مدني أُعجِب بالمكان وبقي في معسكر الخرطوم ثم أمر ببناء الثكنات والقلاع فيه. فقرر إبراهيم باشا، ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، الانتقال إلى الخرطوم القديمة واتخاذها عاصمة للسودان.
بدأ الأتراك في بناء المدينة على طراز معماري جديد فشيدت المباني من الطوب الآجر وأُقيمت مباني الإدارات. وشهدت المدينة توسعاً في عهد خورشيد باشا حكمدار السودان في سنة 1826 م، وفي عام 1850 أمر الخديوي عباس بإنشاء مدرسة الخرطوم بينما قام الحكمدار عبد اللطيف 1849 - 1851 م بتأسيس حي «الحكمدارية» ليكون مجمعاً لمباني الإدارة العثمانية ومساكن للقادة. وفي عهد الحكمدار إسماعيل أيوب 1873 - 1877 م وُضِعت لبنات الصناعة في الخرطوم عندما تم تشييد معمل لصناعة الورق وآخر للبارود. وفي فترة الجنرال غوردون باشا حاكم عام السودان الإنجليزي المصري تم بناء «بوابة المسلمية» وكانت تقع في مكان كوبري (جسر) المسلمية الحالي، جنوب مستشفى الخرطوم، فوق خط السكة الحديدية، و«بوابة الكلاكلة» وكان موقعها مكان كوبري الحرية الحالي، الذي تم تشييده إبّان عهد الرئيس إبراهيم عبود في مطلع ستينات القرن الماضي.
وورد في كتاب تاريخ الخرطوم للمؤرخ السوداني محمد إبراهيم أبو سليم بأن أهم احياء الخرطوم في العهد العثماني شملت حي الحكمدارية، حيث مركز الحكم، وحي المسجد، والأحياء الشعبية في أطراف المدينة التي كان يسكنها عامة الناس، ومنها حي سلامة الباشا، وحي هبوب ضرباني، وحي الكارة، وحي الترس، الذي أخذ اسمه من الحواجز الترابية التي أقيمت جنوبه لحماية المدينة من فيضان نهر النيل الأبيض، وحي بري المحس (وهو الحي الوحيد الذي لا يزال محافظاً على اسمه ولكنه تم تغيير مكانه إلى موقع آخر ليفسح المجال لبناء ثكنات الجيش البريطاني في فترة لاحقة (1900) والتي تحولت بعد الاستقلال (1956) إلى مباني داخليات لطلاب جامعة الخرطوم.

عهد الدولة المهدية (1885- 1898)
عاشت الخرطوم فترة تاريخية عصيبة منذ بداية الثورة المهدية باعتبارها مقر حكم الغزاة. وكان من المتوقع أن تزحف إليها قوات المهدي المناوئة للحكم العثماني في السودان ووكيله خديوي مصر، في أي وقت بعد أن حققت انتصارات باهرة على القوات العثمانية في مختلف مدن السودان، آخرها كان الانتصار الكبير على الجنرال الإنجليزي وليام هكس باشا في سنة 1883 م في واقعة شيكان القريبة من مدينة الأبيض على بعد 588 كيلومتر (365 ميل)، حيث طلب المهدي من أحد انصاره في منطقة الخرطوم وهو الشيخ محمد الطيب البصير بمحاصرة المدينة، وأرسل إليه قوات مساندة بقيادة الأمير محمد عثمان أبو قرجة، وبوصول مدد آخر من القوات يقوده الأمير عبد الرحمن النجومي، تمكن الأنصار من إحكام حصارهم للخرطوم، وضاقت الحلقة حولها بوصول المهدي نفسه والذي عسكر بجيشه في منطقة أبو سعد بأم درمان سنة 1884 م، قبل أن يدخلها منتصراً في 26 يناير / كانون الثاني 1885 م. وتقول المصادر البريطانية، بأن الخرطوم تعرضت لدمار كبير من قبل قوات الدراويش الفاتحة والتي تمكنت من دك حصون الأتراك ووقع غوردون باشا صريعاً في قصره المطل على النيل الأزرق، إلا أن مصادر المهدية تؤكد بإن خليفة المهدي عبد الله التعايشي أمر بعدم تخريب الخرطوم وعدم نقل مواد البناء منها إلى أم درمان، وأن المهدي قد غضب شديداً عندما علم بمقتل غوردون على يد قواته لأنه كان يريد القبض عليه حيّاً وأسره.
أقام كبار أنصار المهدي من أمراء وقادة في قصور الدولة وبيوت الأعيان في حي المسجد بينما أقام المهدي في قصر يسمى «قصر الجاركوك» وكان قريباً من المسجد، وسكن الخليفة عبد الله التعايشي في سراي الحكمدار، أما أهالي الخرطوم فقد تم جمعهم في الطرف الجنوبي من المدينة، ولم تستمر إقامة قادة المهدية طويلاً في الخرطوم حيث انتقلوا إلى أم درمان التي اتخذوها مقراً جديدا للحكم في السودان في مايو / أيار من عام 1885 م.

الحكم الثنائي (1898- 1956)
فقدت الخرطوم مركزها كعاصمة للبلاد في عهد المهدية بعد أن اختار المهدي مدينة أم درمان الواقعة على الضفة الأخرى من نهر النيل عاصمة للدولة، فأقيمت بها منشآت ودوواين الحكم من بيت مال وثكنات للجيش وسور لحمايتها وغير ذلك. وفي تلك الفترة عانت الخرطوم من الإهمال الحكومي، وانتقلت التجارة والصناعة التقليدية إلى العاصمة الجديدة، إلا أن هزيمة الدروايش في معركة كرري في ديسمبر / كانون الأول عام 1898م، وخروج الخليفة عبد الله التعايشي من أم درمان أعاد الروح مجدداً إلى الخرطوم حيث قامت القوات البريطانية المصرية بقيادة اللورد كيتشنر بإعادة بناء المدينة باعتبارها العاصمة الرسمية للحكم الثنائي عام 1899 م، وقُدِمت عدة تصاميم هندسية لبناء الخرطوم الجديدة «الأنجلو-مصرية».
وشهدت الخرطوم فترة استقرار سياسي واجتماعي حتى وقعت حادثة اغتيال السير سير لي إستاك حاكم عام السودان في القاهرة حيث قررت إنجلترا طرد الجيش المصري من السودان في ظرف أربعة وعشرين ساعة وإجلاء الموظفين المدنيين المصريين وذلك كرد فعل انتقامي على حادثة الاغتيال لتنفرد إنجلترا بحكم السودان مما أثار رد فعل عنيف وسط السودانيين الذين خرجوا في مظاهرات بقيادة جمعية اللواء الأبيض التي كان يرأسها الضابط السوداني علي عبد اللطيف والذي ألقي عليه القبض وأدُخل السجن، وأدى ذلك بدوره إلى تأجيج حالة الاستياء وسط سكان الخرطوم. وفي 27 نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني 1924 م تمردت وحدة عسكرية تابعة لقوة دفاع السودان الخاضعة للحكومة الاستعمارية. وكان يقود الوحدة الضابط السوداني عبد الفضيل الماظ. تحركت الوحدة من الخرطوم في اتجاه مدينة الخرطوم بحري الواقعة على الضفة الشمالية لنهر النيل الأزرق واعترضتها قوة إنجليزية في موقع قريب من جسر النيل الأزرق الذي يربط بين المدينتين واندلعت معركة سقط فيها العشرات من الجانبين وأحدثت موجة من الهلع وسط السكان الذين فرت أعداد منهم إلى الأحراش المحيطة بالمدينة وتمكنت القوة الإنجليزية من القضاء على تمرد الجنود والضباط السودانيين وذلك بمحاصرة الضابط عبد الفضيل الماظ في مستشفى الخرطوم وقصفه بالمدافع الثقيلة. وعرفت تلك الأحداث في السودان بثورة 1924.
وفي أثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية إبّان حملة شرق إفريقيا، دخلت الخرطوم في أتون الصراع بين مجموعة دول الحلفاء في الحرب العالمية الثانية ومجموعة ما يسمى بدول المحور ممثلة بإيطاليا التي كانت تحتل الحبشة وإريتريا والصومال الإيطالي. وفي 23 أغسطس / آب 1940 م، أغارت طائرة حربية إيطالية على الخرطوم تلتها غارة جوية أخرى في اليوم التالي على أم درمان أدت إلى مصرع 3 أشخاص وفي 10 سبتمبر / أيلول من العام ذاته ألقت طائرة حربية إيطالية بقنابلها على مشارف الخرطوم.
بانتصار الحلفاء طلب السودانيون من إنجلترا الوفاء بوعدها لهم بمنح السودان حق تقرير المصير وبدأت حكومتا الحكم الثنائي في مناقشة هذه المطالب مع الأحزاب السودانية وبعد استيلاء الضباط الأحرار على السلطة في مصر واختيار اللواء محمد نجيب رئيساً مجلس قيادة الثورة المصرية، جاء محمد نجيب إلى الخرطوم - وهو من مواليدها - لافتتاح البرلمان السوداني الجديد الذي سيتولى مهمة الاقتراع على استقلال السودان أو وحدته مع مصر. وشهدت الخرطوم إبّان زيارته أحداثاً دامية في مطار الخرطوم الدولي عندما اصطدمت أعداد كبيرة من المؤيدين للاستقلال التام للسودان وسقط عدد من القتلى والجرحى وعُرفت تلك الحوادث بحوادث مارس 1954.
وفي يوم الأحد أول يناير / كانون الثاني شهدت الخرطوم احتفالات حاشدة حيث تم رفع علم الاستقلال على سارية سرايا الحاكم العام التي تغيّر اسمها إلى القصر الجمهوري.

التاريخ المعاصر
في الفترة التي تلت استقلال السودان في عام 1956م شهدت الخرطوم عدة أحداث وفعاليات سياسية وطنية وإقليمية ودولية، فإلى جانب قيامها بدور العاصمة السياسية للسودان ومقراً للحكم فقد استضافت عدداً من المنظمات الإقليمية التي تم إبرام اتفاقيات إنشائها في السودان وأصبحت مدينة الخرطوم مقراً لها. ففي فبراير / شباط 1957، تم تأسيس الاتحاد الأفريقي لكرة القدم في الخرطوم التي كانت أول مقر له قبل انتقال المقر إلى القاهرة وفي الخرطوم تم تنظيم أول بطولة لكأس الأمم الإفريقية. وفي فبراير / شباط 1969، تم إنشاء اتحاد إذاعات الدول العربية في الخرطوم وانعقدت في التاريخ نفسه أول جلسة لجمعيته العامة في الخرطوم. وفي 11 مارس / آذار 1970 تم إنشاء المنظمة العربية للتنمية الزراعية لتكون المدينة مقراً لها. وفي الشهر ذاته من عام 1975 بدأ المصرف العربي للتنمية الاقتصادية في إفريقيا أعماله انطلاقاً منها وفي أبريل / نيسان تم في الخرطوم الإعلان عن إنشاء منظمة الأحزاب السياسية الإفريقية.
وفي نوفمبر / تشرين الأول 1976 م، تأسست في الخرطوم الهيئة العربية للاستثمار والإنماء الزراعي.
كما شهدت الخرطوم انعقاد عدة مؤتمرات قمة عربية وإفريقية مهمة حيث انعقد فيها في عام 1967 م، مؤتمر القمة العربي الرابع المعروف باسم قمة اللاءات الثلاثة، وفي عام 2006 م، مؤتمر القمة العربية الثامنة عشرة كما انعقد فيها مؤتمران للقمة الإفريقية أحدهما في عام 1978 والآخر في عام 2006 إلى جانب انعقاد مؤتمرات أخرى على مستوى وزاري مثل مؤتمر وزراء دفاع وقادة دول شرق أفريقيا في عام 2012 م.
في عام 1973، كانت المدينة مسرحاً لأزمة رهائن عندما قامت مجموعة تابعة لمنظمة أيلول الأسود الفلسطينية باقتحام حفل استقبال كان يقيمه عميد السلك الدبلوماسي بالخرطوم سفير المملكة العربية السعودية لوداع مستشار بالسفارة الأمريكية واحتجاز عدد من المدعوين وتقدمت بمطالب لم تتم الاستجابة لها، ومن بينها إطلاق سراح أحد رفاقها من السجون الأردنية فقامت باغتيال السفير الأمريكي الجديد آنذاك ومستشار السفارة المحتفى به، والقائم بالأعمال البلجيكي، وأفرجت عن الرهائن الآخرين بمن فيهم السفير السعودي والسفير الأردني ثم استسلمت للسلطات السودانية التي قامت باعتقال أفرادها وسلمتهم لاحقاُ لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية.
وفي سبعينيات وثمانينيات القرن الماضي استقبلت الخرطوم موجات متعاقبة من اللاجئين والنازحين والمهجرين، الوافدين من مناطق النزاعات المسلحة والجفاف في البلدان المجاورة مثل تشاد وإريتريا وإثيوبيا وأوغندا أفلح بعضهم في الاندماج في مجتمعها، في حين أقام البعض الآخر في أحياء بضواحي المدينة. وفي منتصف الثمانينيات استقرت حول الخرطوم أعداد كبيرة من السودانيين النازحين من مناطق الصراع في جنوب السودان ودار فور
وفي يوم 14 أغسطس / آب 1994 م، تم في الخرطوم اعتقال الفنزويلي كارلوس الملقب بابن آوى والمطلوب من قبل السلطات الأمنية في عدد من الدول الغربية وتم نقله من الخرطوم إلى باريس.
أقام أسامة بن لادن في حي الرياض بالخرطوم في الفترة من عام 1991 وحتى 1996 م، قبل أن يتم أبعاده منها. وفي أعقاب تفجيرات السفارة الأمريكية في كل من كمبالا ودار السلام في عام 1998 م، اتهمت الولايات المتحدة تنظيم القاعدة الذي كان يتزعمه بمسؤولية التفجيرات وقامت في 20 أغسطس / آب من العام نفسه بشن هجمات بصواريخ كروز على مصنع الشفاء للأدوية بمدينة الخرطوم بحري القريبة من الخرطوم مما أدى إلى توتر دبلوماسي بينها وبين السودان، وأصبحت أنقاض المصنع منطقة جذب سياحي.
أحدثت الوفاة المفاجئة لرئيس الحركة الشعبية لتحرير السودان ونائب الرئيس السوداني آنذاك جون قرنق في حادثة طيران في جنوب السودان في يوليو / تموز 2005 م، أعمال شغب عنيفة في الخرطوم لمدة ثلاثة أيام، قبل أن تتمكن قوات الأمن من السيطرة على الوضع.
في 23 أكتوبر / تشرين الأول 2012 م تعرض مصنع اليرموك للذخيرة بمنطقة الشجرة بالخرطوم إلى تفجيرات أعلنت الحكومة السودانية بأنها كانت نتيجة غارة جوية إسرائيلية.

الجغرافيا
الموقع
تقع الخرطوم في منتصف المساحة المأهولة في السودان تقريباً شمال شرق وسط البلاد بين خط العرض16 درجة شمالاَ وخط العرض 15 درجة جنوباَ وخطي الطول 21 درجة غرباً و 24 درجة شرقاَ، وتتمدد مساحتها البالغة 20736 كيلو متر (12884 ميل) مربع بين الضفة الغربية لنهر النيل الأزرق من الناحيتين الشرقية والشمالية والضفة الشرقية للنيل الأبيض من الغرب وسهل الجزيرة تجاه الجنوب وهي المنطقة القابلة لتمدد المدينة عمرانياً.
وتتوسط الخرطوم ولايات كسلا والقضارف والنيل والجزيرة والنيل الأبيض وشمال كردفان. وهي أيضأ قريبة من ولايات النيل الأزرق والشمالية وسنار وجنوب كردفان وتفصلها عن ولايات دار فور الكبرى أرض صحراوية وشبه صحراوية جرداء فقط.

الصورة الطوبوغرافية
تقع الخرطوم على ارتفاع 382 متر (1,253,28 قدم) فوق سطح البحر فوق أرض سهلية مستوية السطح مع انحدار طفيف نحو مجرى نهر النيل تتخللها تلال ونتوءات صخرية وكثبان رملية متفرقة مما يعطي صورة لتضاريس منبسطة مع تموجات طفيفة، وتتخلل هذا المشهد الطبيعي أيضاً طبقات وأرصفة أودية نيلية وخيران أبرزها خور جانقي في منطقة العُشَرَة والصحافة من جهة الشرق، ويتميز الجانب الذي يقع غرب النيل الأبيض بأنه أكثر انحداراً من جهة النيل الأزرق شرقاً، ولهذا فإن الخيران التي تقع في الغرب تصب معظمها في النيل إبّان موسم الأمطار في حين نجد الخيران الواقعة في الشرق غير منتظمة الفيضان ومعظمها ليس سوى جروف واسعة تفشل في الوصول إلى النيل خاصة في الأماكن التي تغطيها مكونات رملية. ويشكل النيلين الأزرق والأبيض أهم ظاهرة طبيعية للخرطوم حيث يلتقيان عند نقطة المقرن.
جيولوجياً، تقع الخرطوم في حوض الخرطوم الذي يشكل جزء من حوض النيل الأزرق ويتكون من الصخور المتحولة والصخور النارية التي تنتمي إلى حزام الموزمبيق وتظهر بوضوح في منطقة السبلوقة شمال الخرطوم. والخصائص الجيولوجية المهمة في الخرطوم هي: الحجر الرملي النوبي، والحجر الرملي المغطى بالجبس والتكتلات الصخرية الرسوبية. وتبين من دراسة بنية القشرة الأرضية لحوض الخرطوم باستخدام 3 محطات رصد دائمة للزلازل في نطاق 40 كيلومتر (24,8 ميل) من وسط الخرطوم، بأن حوض الخرطوم هو واحد من عدة أحواض متصدعة في السودان مرتبطة مع نظام الأخدود الإفريقي الوسيط وأن سمك القشرة الأرضية تحت حوض الخرطوم يتراوح ما بين 33 (20,5 ميل) و 37 (22,9 ميل) كيلومتر بمتوسط قدره 35 (21,7 ميل) كيلومتر.

ملتقى النيلين الأزرق والأبيض
يتميز النيل الأبيض الذي يأتي إلى الخرطوم من جهة الجنوب بإتساع مجراه وبطء جريانه وقلة انحداره حيث يشبه البحيرة الراكدة خاصة موسم فيضان النيل الأزرق. وبسبب قلة سرعة تياره تقل عمليات النحت في ضفافه ويزداد الإرساب، وعلى نقيض ذلك يتسم النيل الأزرق الذي ينبع من الهضبة الإثيوبية شرقاً بسرعة التيار وشدة الانحدار وعمق المجري. ويلاحظ المرء بوضوح ارتفاع ضفافه في المنطقة القريبة من المقرن على شارع النيل في الخرطوم حيث تم بناء حائط على الضفاف اتقاء لفيضانه، في حين تنعدم هذه الإنشاءات في ضفاف النيل الأبيض كما يلاحظ سرعة جريانه وقوة تياره من خلال دفعه لمياه النيل الأبيض إلى الوراء قليلاً عند التقائهما في نقطة المقرن، فضلاً عن ملاحظة الفارق في لون مياه مجراهما حيث يسود مياه النيل الأزرق لون الطمي البني الداكن، بينما تجري المياه شبه صافية بين ضفاف النيل الأبيض مما يعطيها بياضاً عند النظر إليها من علو، مقابل زرقة النيل الأزرق.

الجزر النيلية
وتشكل أيضاً معالم سياحية طبيعية يزورها العديد من السياح ويقصدها سكان العاصمة المثلثة للاسترواح والتنزه وأثناء العطلات والإجازات وأهم هذه الجزر:

جزيرة توتي

جزيرة توتي تقع بين النيل الأزرق من الشرق والجنوب، قبالة أجمل مناطق الخرطوم (شارع النيل والمقرن) وينطلق منها النيل في رحلته نحو الشمال بعد التقاء رافديه الأزرق والأبيض من جهة الغرب. تحتضن الجزيرة قرية صغيرة مساحتها 8 كيلو متر مربع (3 أميال مربعة). يعود تاريخ تأسيسها إلى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، وتتميز بشواطئها الرملية وبساتينها التي تنتج الفاكهة والخضر ومن بينها الليمون والبرتقال والجرجير. وتم ربطها بالخرطوم بجسر معلق طوله 310 متر. تستقبل القرية الزوار من العاصمة المثلثة والسياح لقضاء أوقات استجمام وترويح فيها، خاصة في أيام العطلات. وهناك محاولات لبناء منتجع سياحي كبير فيها.

جزيرة التمساح
تقع في وسط النيل الأزرق بالقرب من قرية أم دوم جنوب الخرطوم وعرفت بهذا الاسم نسبة لشكلها الذي يشبه شكل التمساح.

جزيرة البط
توجد فيها أعداد كبيرة من الطيور المائية المستوطنة والمهاجرة.

الغابات
غابة السنط
تقع في غرب الخرطوم بالقرب من مجرى نهر النيل الأبيض وتم إعلانها هي محمية طبيعية في عام 1939 م وتتكون معظم أشجارها من السنط الذي يقاوم مياه فيضانات النهر خلال فصل الخريف، وتأوي الغابة أنواع عديدة من الطيور المستوطنة والمهاجرة مثل الأوز وطير البقر وخطاف البحر وأبو منجل والبط والنورس النهري ومالك الحزين.

الحزام الأخضر
وهو نطاق من الأشجار من الأشجار الفارعة الارتفاع كأشجار البان التي تم استزراعها في الأطراف الجنوبية بغرض حماية المدينة من الزحف الصحراوي والحد من هبوب الرياح القوية نحو المدينة من الجهة التي لا يجري فيها أحد فرعي النيل، إلا أن التوسع العمراني في العقود الأخيرة قد تجاوز حدود هذا النطاق.

المناخ
درجات الحرارة
تعتبر الخرطوم واحدة من المدن الرئيسية الأكثر حرارة في العالم. فقد تتجاوز درجات الحرارة فيها 48 درجة مئوية (118.4 درجة فهرنهايت) في منتصف الصيف، إلا أن المتوسط السنوي لدرجات الحرارة القصوى يبلغ حوالي 37.1 درجة مئوية (98.78 فهرنهايت)، مع ستة أشهر في السنة يزيد المتوسط الشهري لدرجة الحرارة فيها عن 38 درجة مئوية (100.4 فهرنهايت)، ولا يوجد في جدول حالة الطقس الخاص بالخرطوم معدلاً لدرجة الحرارة الشهرية يقل عن 30 درجة مئوية (86.5 فهرنهايت)، وهو ما تتم ملاحظته في جداول خاصة بمدن رئيسية أخرى ذات مناخ صحراوي حار مماثل كالرياض، أو بغداد أو فينيكس بولاية أريزونا. وفي كل الأحوال فإن درجات الحرارة في الخرطوم تهبط بمعدلات كبيرة خلال الليل، إلى أدنى من 15 درجة مئوية (59 فهرنهايت) في شهر يناير / كانون الثاني وقد تصل إلى 6 درجات مئوية (42.8 درجة فهرنهايت) عند مرور جبهة هوائية باردة.

الأمطار
يسود الخرطوم في معظم أشهر السنة المناخ الصحراوي الحار الجاف باستثناء شهري يوليو / تموز وأغسطس / آب، حيث تسقط الأمطار المدارية الشديدة، بمعدل يزيد قليلاً على 155 مليمتر (6.1 بوصة) سنوياً في المتوسط، وفي الفترة من ديسمبر / كانون الأول وحتى فبراير / شباط حيث تنخفض درجة الحرارة نسبياُ.
وفي الشتاء وهي الفترة من ديسمبر / كانون الأول وحتى فبراير / شباط يكون الجو لطيفاً إلى حد ما، حيث تنخفض درجات الحرارة في الصباح وحتى الظهيرة وبعد غروب الشمس. وتتراوح درجة الحرارة خلال هذه الفترة ما بين 32 درجة مئوية (89.6 درجة فهرنهايت) 28 درجة مئوية (82.4 فهرنهايت).

حركة الرياح
ثمة ظاهرة مناخية في السودان تعرف بالهبوب وهو عاصفة ترابية نشطة تحدث في مناطق وسط السودان بما فيها الخرطوم وذلك عندما تهب رياح جنوبية رطبة في شهري مايو / أيار ويوليو / تموز ويمكن أن تقلل بشكل مؤقت مدى الرؤية إلى الصفر.
أنسب وقت لزيارة الخرطوم من حيث المناخ هي الفترة ما بين شهري نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني ومارس / آذار.

الإدارة
الخرطوم هي محلية من محليات ولاية الخرطوم التي تضم أيضاً الخرطوم بحري وأم درمان وشرق النيل ومحليات أُخرى.
كانت تتكون محلية الخرطوم من ثلاث وحدات إدارية هي:

وحدة الخرطوم وتضم أحياء ومناطق:

ُ
الخرطوم شمال، البراري، امتداد ناصر، الخرطوم وسط، الديوم الشرقية، الديوم الغربية، الشجرة الجنوبية، الشجرة الشمالية، العمارات، الخرطوم1، الخرطوم 2، الخرطوم3، الخرطوم غرب، المنطقة الصناعية، الخرطوم السوق الشعبي، الكلاكلات.

وحدة الشهدا وتشمل أحياء ومناطق:

وحدة الخرطوم شرق الإدارية
وحدة الخرطوم غرب الإدارية
وحدة الخرطوم وسط الإدارية
وحدة الشهداء وسوبا الإدارية
وحدة الشجرة الإدارية
وتتولى هذه الوحدات الإدارية مهمة تقديم الخدمات العامة للمواطنين على نحو أشبه بما تقوم به البلديات والجماعات الحضرية في عواصم أخرى، ويشرف على إدارة المحلية رئيس يسمى المعتمد، إلا أن والي الولاية يمثل أعلى سلطة إدارية في الخرطوم.

السياحة
تعتبر الخرطوم إحدى المراكز السياحية المهمة في السودان، ليس فقط باعتبارها عاصمة البلاد وواحدة من أكبر مدنها، بل لوجود عدد من المقومات السياحية مثل المتاحف والآثار والحدائق والفضاءات الخضراء إلى جانب الأندية الرياضية والمهرجانات وغيرها من الفعاليات.

المتاحف
هناك عدة متاحف في الخرطوم أهمها هي:

المتحف القومي المُطل على نهر النيل الأزرق وفي منطقة المقرن ويحتوي على مقتنيات أثرية من مختلف أنحاء السودان، يمتد تاريخها إلى عصور ما قبل التاريخ، وحتى فترة الممالك النوبية وتشتمل الصالات الداخلية للمتحف على العديد من المقتنيات المعروضة في شكل منحوتات وآنية فخارية وزجاجية وخشبية ومعدنية، وأدوات زينة وصور حائطية في حين يشتمل فناء المتحف على عدد من المعابد والمدافن والنصب التذكارية، والتماثيل القديمة بأحجام مختلفة، التي نقلت من مناطق استكشافها في شمال السودان، وأهمها معابد (سمنة شرق) و (سمنة غرب) وبوهين، ومقبرة الأمير (حجو تو حتب) وأعمدة كاتدرائية فرس. كما يضم المتحف مقتنيات أثرية يرجع تاريخها إلى العصر الحجري القديم وحتى نهاية فترة سلطنة سنار في عام 1821 م.
متحف التاريخ الطبيعي، يقع في شارع الجامعة ويحتوى على حيوانات محنطة وأخرى حيّة بهدف التعريف بما هو متوافر في السودان من زواحف وطيور ومواشي وحشرات تعريفاً علمياً، وتلعب جامعة الخرطوم دوراً مهماً في استمرارية هذا المتحف والحفاظ عليه، ومن الطيور الموجودة فيه صقر الجديان الذي يمثل شعار السودان.
متحف القصر، وتعرض فيه لوحات زيتية وصور فوتوغرافية لحكام السودان منذ الحكم الثنائي في عام 1889 م، وحتى فترة ما بعد الاستقلال وبعض السيارات الرئاسية التي كانوا يستخدمونها خلال فترة حكمهم وما تلقّاه الرؤساء الوطنيين من هدايا إضافة إلى الآلات الموسيقية وقطع الأواني والأثاث التي استخدمت في القصر الرئاسي. ويقع المتحف في مبنى كنيسة أثرية بيزنطية المعمار داخل جزء من الحديقة الجنوبية الشرقية للقصر.
متحف الإثنوغرافيا في ملتقى شارع الجامعة بشارع المك نمر وتعرض فيه نماذج من الأدوية التقليدية المستعملة في الحياة اليومية بالسودان ونماذج من أسلحة الصيد وأدوات الزراعة والإنتاج لدى القبائل المختلفة بالسودان إلى جانب نماذج من أزيائهم وآلاتهم لموسيقية، ومركز الفولكلور التابع للهيئة القومية للآداب والفنون.
المتحف الحربي (العسكري)، بوزارة الدفاع وفيه مجموعة من نماذج الأسلحة الأثرية المختلفة والأزياء العسكرية والدروع والصور والخرائط العسكرية التاريخية.

المعالم الأثرية
القباب العثمانية التي تقع شرق ساحة أبو جنزير في وسط الخرطوم ويرجع تاريخها إلى بدايات العهد العثماني بالسودان في سنة 1839 م، وتضم مقابر لمشاهير القادة والعسكريين الاتراك في السودان ومن بينهم مؤسس الخرطوم الحكمدار عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي.
موقع سوبا شرق النيل الأثري جنوب الخرطوم بحرى، الذي يضم آثار عاصمة مملكة علوة المسيحية من القرن السادس إلى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، ومن بينها بقايا كنيسة قديمة.
المباني الأثرية ومنها القصر الجمهوري ومبنى البريد المركزي ومعمل إستاك وغيرها تضاف إلى ذلك المعالم السياحية في كل من أم درمان والخرطوم بحري على الضفاف الأخرى لنهري النيل (الأزرق والأبيض) والتي يمكن الوصول إليها من الخرطوم بسهولة.

الحدائق النباتية والحيوانية
توجد في الخرطوم حديقة نباتية تبلغ مسلحتها 11 فدان وتحتوى على أنواع عديدة ونادرة من النباتات، كما توجد حديقة للحيوانات في غابة السنط ويجري العمل على إنشاء حديقة سفاري.

السياحة النهرية
تشتهر الخرطوم أيضاً بالسياحة النهرية على نهر النيل حيث توجد البواخر النيلية وقوارب الفلوكة والزوارق والقوارب الشراعية والعبّارات والتي تمخر مياه النيلين الأزرق والأبيض وتعبر بركابها إلى جزيرة توتي وسط النيل حيث البساتين التقليدية النضرة. وتوجد المراكب بالقرب من المقرن وجزيرة توتي وجزيرة التمساح، وتقوم برحلات نهارية وليلية.

رحلات السفاري
يتميز السودان بتباين نطاقه المناخي والبيئي وهو ما يتّضح جلياً في وجود أنواع كثيرة من الحيوانات والطيور وتقوم شركات ومكاتب السفاري والرحلات البرية في الخرطوم بتنظيم رحلات مرخصة للصيد ذهاباً وإياباً منها رحلات سفاري الغزلان، وسفاري صيد البط، والحمام البري الذي يمتد موسم صيده من نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني وحتى فبراير / شباط من العام.

المناطق الطبيعية
شلال السبلوقة
يقع شلال السبلوقة على بعد 80 كيلو متر من الخرطوم ويتبع إدارياً لولاية نهر النيل وهو عبارة عن كتل صخرية في وسط مجرى نهر النيل تعترض تدفق المياه، ويعرف أيضاً باسم الشلال السادس أو الجندل السادس باعتباره سادس وآخر العقبات الصخرية وسط مجرى نهر النيل ويشكل مقصداً للسياح خاصة السياح العرب والأجانب وذلك لطبيعة المنطقة التي تجمع بين التلال والمياه والجزر والكثبان الصحراوية والحياة البرية وتقام فيها رحلات نيلية.

مقرن النيلين
المقرن في الخرطوم هو نقطة تلاقي رافدي نهر النيل وهما النيل الأزرق القادم من الهضبة الإثيوبية والنيل الأبيض القادم من وسط أفريقيا في مشهد طبيعي يشد الانتباه، حيث يلاحظ المرء كيف تسير مياه النيل الأزرق الطينية الداكنة ومياه النيل الأبيض الصافية جنباً إلى جنب، ثم يختلطان مع بعضهما ويصبحان نهراً واحداً في مجرى واسع ذو مياه خفيفة الزرقة. وتوجد في المنطقة عدة منتزهات ومتاحف وفنادق وجسر يربط المنطقة بأم درمان.

منطقة جبل أولياء في الجنوب الغربي من الخرطوم، حيث السد القديم والبحيرة التي خلفه ويشكلان بيئة نهرية زاخرة بالأسماك والطيور والنباتات.

الخدمات العامة
التعليم
تعتبر الخرطوم قطباً مهماً للتعليم العالي في السودان، حيث تتركز فيها الجامعات والمعاهد العليا.وقد شهدت إنشاء أول مدرسة نظامية للسودان وأول كلية جامعية هي كلية غوردون التذكارية التي تحول فيما بعد إلى جامعة. كما يوجد بها العديد من المدارس بما في ذلك مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية المقيمة فيها. وتستضيف الخرطوم المعهد الدولي لتعليم اللغة العربية لغير الناطقين بها، الذي تم تأسيسه بالتعاون مع المنظمة العربية للتربية والثقافة والعلوم.
عرفت الخرطوم التعليم منذ إنشائها على يد فقهاء مدارس خلاويها فقد تزامن تاريخ تأسيسها مع قيام المدارس القرآنية فيها والتي انحصر دورها على التعاليم المرتبطة بالعقيدة من تحفيظ سور القرآن وتفسيرها ومبادئ الفقه وقواعد اللغة العربية وأساسيات الحساب. وفي العهد العثماني تم افتتاح عدة مدارس نظامية حديثة في السودان من بينها مدرسة الخرطوم الابتدائية التي افتتحت سنة 1855 م، لتعليم أبناء الموظفين الأتراك تحت اشراف العالم رفاعة رافع الطهطاوي الذي نفي إلى السودان آنذاك، ومنذ ذلك الحين انتشرت المدارس في المدينة على اختلاف مراحلها ومناهج التدريس فيها. ويمكن تقسيم المدارس في الخرطوم إلى مدارس عامة حكومية أصبح لبعضها شهرة على نطاق السودان وأخرى خاصة يديرها القطاع الخاص وتشمل هذه الفئة مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية والتي ساهم بعضها بقدر كبير في مجال التعليم بالمدينة مثل مدارس البعثة المصرية وأكبرها مدرسة جمال عبد الناصر الثانوية ومدارس الكلية القبطية ومدارس كمبوني ومدرسة الراهبات والمدارس العالمية. وازداد عدد هذه المدارس في نهاية القرن الماضي ليشمل مدارس تدرس بلغات غير اللغتين العربية والإنجليزية السائدتين في المجال التعليمي في الخرطوم ومن بينها المدرسة الأرمنية والمدرسة التركية. ومن مدارس الجاليات الأجنبية: المدرسة البريطانية ومدرسة الاتحاد والمدرسة الأمريكية ومدرسة كامبريدج العالمية ومدرسة البارون والمدارس العالمية
بلغ عدد المؤسسات التعليمية في ولاية الخرطوم في عام 2011م، حوالي 3000 منها 1600 مدرسة في مرحلة الأساس و450 في المرحلة الثانوية بالإضافة إلى المدارس الخاصة ومؤسسات التعليم قبل المدرسي ومراكز تعليم الكبار.

الرعاية الصحية
توجد في الخرطوم عدة مؤسسات صحية وطبية بما في ذلك المستشفيات والمستوصفات الطبية وعيادات الأطباء الخاصة والأخصائيين إلى جانب مكاتب مؤسسات التأمينات الصحية. ومن تلك المستشفيات، مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى الشعب ومستشفى العيون ومستشفى الذرة ومستشفى الأسنان وكلها تقع بوسط الخرطوم، إلى جانب مجموعة كبيرة من المستشفيات الخاصة منها مستشفى ابن سينا ومستشفى ابن خلدون والمستشفى السعودي والمستشفى التركي وغيرها. وتنتشر الصيدليات في المدينة ومجمعاتها العلاجية.
وتتقاسم إدارة النظام الصحي في الخرطوم جهتان، هما الحكومة المركزية ووزارة الصحة الإقليمية. وتشرف الحكومة المركزية على حوالي 18 مستشفى في ولاية الخرطوم معظمها مستشفيات كبيرة وعامة منها مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى ابن سينا، بينما تشرف وزارة الصحة الإقليمية على المراكز الصحية وحوالي 30 مستشفى صغير في مدن العاصمة المثلثة وضواحيها. ونظراً للتنافس الكبير بين هذه المستشفيات والمؤسسات الصحية وعدم تكاملها فإن الكثير من الموارد يتم إهدارها حيث تحصل المستشفيات الكبيرة على دعم حكومي مما يجعلها تستقطب العدد الكبير من المرضى الأمر الذي يشكل حالة من التكدس إضافة إلى مشاكل التنقل على نحو يستدعي الإصلاح خاصة بعد التدهور الكبير في القطاع الصحي. وأول تحد يواجه الإصلاح هو التوسع في الخدمات ونقلها إلى خارج مركز العاصمة. وإلى جانب ذلك تشرف وزارة الصحة الإقليمية على نظام التأمين الصحي بقسط قدره 25 جنيه سوداني (4 دولارات) شهرياً لجميع افراد العائلة الواحدة بينما يدفع العمال حوالي 60% من صندوق التأمين الصحي وتغطي الحكومة النسبة المتبقية. وتتولى صناديق الزكاة والأعمال الخيرية دفع اقساط مقدرة من تأمينات الأسر.
أكبر مستشفى في الخرطوم هو مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي الواقع على شارع الطابية بوسط الخرطوم وتبلغ عدد الأسرة فيه 750 سرير (عام 2013) وأصغرها هو المستشفى السويدي في حي الجريف غرب الواقع شرق المدينة بالقرب من مطار الخرطوم الدولي وعدد الأسرة فيه 30 سريراً. وهناك مستشفى الذرة بشارع القصر وبه حوالي 141 سرير ومستشفى ابن سينا بشارع اللواء محمد نجيب ويسع لحوالي 147 سرير.
أما عدد المستوصفات والمراكز الصحية الأخرى فيبلغ حوالي 91 مستوصف و7 وحدات صحية خاصة و11 مركز صحي. ويوجد في الخرطوم القومسيون الطبي وهو هيئة طبية إدارية تقوم بمهمة استخراج شهادات التطعيم الدولية وتحديد القياة الصحية للأفراد لأغراض التعيين في وظائف معينة ومواقع بيع الأطعمة وغيرها من المهام ذات الصلة.

الفندقة والمطاعم
الفنادق

تنتشر في مختلف أرجاء الخرطوم العديد من الفنادق على مختلف الدرجات ويتركز بعضها على ضفاف النيل بشارع النيل.
ومن تلك الفنادق فندق كورينثيا- برج الفاتح سابقاً وفندق كورال (الهيلتون سابقا) وفندق قصر الصداقة وفندق السلام روتانا وفندق جراند هوليداي وفندق مريديان (ريجينسى حاليا)وفندق شهرزاد وفنادق الأكروبول وصحارى وقباء وبلازا والبحرين وسنترال وكانون والحجاز ومشيريب والتاكا هاوس والفيصل سفاري بالاس والسواحلي والآراك وبحر الغزال وبيت الضيافة الألماني وفندق إفريقيا وفندق الرياض الجديد وغيرها.

المطاعم

توجد في الخرطوم عدة مطاعم تقدم مختلف الأطباق السودانية والأجنبية فهناك مطاعم تقدم أطباق لبنانية كما في مطعم البستان على شارع أفريقيا وأطباق باكستانية كما في مطعم سولت-إن-بيبر (ملح وفلفل) ومطعم الحبشة للطعام الإثيوبي في منطقة أركويت، والأطباق اليمنية في مطعم حضرموت في سوق الخرطوم 2، والصينية في مول (مجمع) عفراء والكورية في شارع إفريقيا والشاورما والكباب في شارع المطار، واللحوم في كانيفوري ويمكن تذوق الأطعمة السودانية التقليدية في المطعم الشعبي 15. معظم المطاعم تتركز في مناطق العمارات والخرطوم 2 والرياض. وبعض المطاعم مزود بشاشات عرض وموسيقى حية وإنترنت. ويزخر شارع أفريقيا وشارع النيل بالعديد من المطاعم والمقاهي.

الأسواق والسوبرماركات
توجد بوسط الخرطوم سوقان رئيسيتان هما السوق العربي والسوق الأفرنجي. وكلاهما قريبان من بعضهما من حيث المسافة ولكنهما تختلفان من حيث السلع المعروضة. فالأولى سوق تقليدية تعرض فيها السلع والمنتوجات المحلية المختلفة من الحبوب والتوابل، إلى أدوات الزينة والذهب ومواد البناء والتشييد.والثانية تضم محلات تجارية تبيع السلع المستوردة من أقمشة وقطع اثاث وتحف وما شابه ذلك. وهناك أيضاً اسواقاً مركزية للخضر واللحوم، إلى جانب السوق الشعبي.
توجد في الخرطوم عدة سوبر ماركات محلية منتشرة في الأحياء الراقية، منها مول عفراء التجاري الذي تم تأسيسه في عام 4 م، بمنطقة أركويت وتتنوع الخدمات فيه من محلات تجارية ومطاعم وأماكن ترفيه إلى موقف للسيارات. وهناك مول مركز العمارات والواحة مول الذي يتكون من أربعة ابراج وبه منطقة خضراء ومحلات تجارية ومكاتب للشركات والافراد، ومركز واحة الخرطوم وهو واحد من المراكز التجارية الحديثة في الخرطوم.

النقل والمواصلات
ساعد موقع الخرطوم في وسط البلاد تقريباً على تسهيل ربطها بكافة عواصم ومدن ولايات السودان المختلفة، براً عبر الطرق الممهدة والطرق الموسمية وجواً عبر الطيران الداخلي وبالبواخر النيلية عبر نهر النيل وبقطارات السكك الحديدية. أما داخل المدينة فتتنوع وسائل النقل من سيارة الأجرة الصفراء اللون وحافلات المدينة وغيرها من الحافلات الأخرى على مختلف الأحجام وتسمى بالباصات، كما تستخدم الدراجات النارية ثلاثية العجلات المعروفة بالتوك توك وتعرف في الخرطوم باسم الرقشة، فضلاً عن القطارات والعبارات النيلية.

النقل الجوي
يوجد في الخرطوم مطار واحد وهو مطار الخرطوم الدولي لخدمة الركاب داخل السودان وخارجه، ويعتبر أكبر مطار في السودان. ويقع وسط مدينة الخرطوم، رمزه في منظمة النقل الجوي الدولي (أياتا) هو KRT وفي المنظمة الدولية للطيران المدني (إيكاو) هو HSSS، ويبلغ طول مدرجه 2980 متر أي 9777 قدم ، وهو مرتبط بخطوط إلى معظم المطارات الدولية بالبلدان العربية ومن بينها خط جدة والقاهرة ودمشق وطرابلس ودبي، وعدد من المطارات بالدول الأوربية مثل مطارات أثينا ولندن وأمستردام واسطنبول والآسيوية مثل بكين والأفريقية كأسمرة وأديس أبابا ونيروبي وغيرها. ويرتبط المطار بخطوط داخلية تتجه نحو المطارات المنتشرة في ولايات السودان المختلفة مثل مطارات بورتسودان ونيالا والقضارف ودنقلا وكوستي.
يجري العمل حالياً على إنشاء مطار دولي جديد، بعيداً عن مركز العاصمة وذلك لعدة أسباب أهمها وقوع المطار القديم في وسط المدينة مما يشكل خطورة على السكان وعائق أمام بناء المباني الشاهقة والمرتفعة في الخرطوم، فضلاً عن زيادة الطلب على الرحلات الدولية للخرطوم، مما يستدعي بناء مطار جديد يستوفي المعايير الدولية من حيث مدرجات الإقلاع والهبوط وصالات المسافرين وغيرها من المرافق الأخرى.

النقل النهري
يوجد في الخرطوم ميناء نهري للنقل والسفر إلى المدن الواقعة على ضفاف النيل الأبيض جنوب الخرطوم حتى مدينة كوستي، كما يقدم خدمات سياحية تتمثل في الرحلات النيلية وخدمات القوارب الشراعية والزوارق في النيل. ويقع المقر الرئيسي للميناء في الخرطوم بحري. وهناك عبّارة (ويطلق عليها في السودان مَعدّية) نهرية تقوم برحلات منتظمة لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين الخرطوم وجزيرة توتي الواقعة في مجري نهر النيل.

الطرق السريعة والجسور والأنفاق

ترتبط الخرطوم بمدن السودان المختلفة بشبكة من الطرق السريعة ومنها شارع الخرطوم - ود مدني والخرطوم - القضارف والخرطوم- بورتسودان والخرطوم -دنقلا وغيرها.
أما في الداخل فهناك بعض الشوارع الرئيسية المشهورة من حيث طولها أو المنطقة التي تشقها ومنها شارع أفريقيا وشارع النيل أم درمان، وشارع القصر وهو أحد أطول شوارع الخرطوم وشارع عبيد ختم وشارع الجمهورية وشارع علي عبد اللطيف وشارع المك نمر. ويتم حالياً تنفيذ مشاريع لتوسعة شبكة الطرق الداخلية وتطويرها لتسهيل انسياب الحركة في المدينة مثل شارع النيل الخرطوم السريع والطريق الدائري.

الخرطوم هي إحدى مدن العاصمة المثلثة ولذلك فهي ترتبط بأم درمان والخرطوم بحري بعدة جسور مقامة على النيلين:الأزرق والأبيض وهي:

كوبري النيل الأبيض القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع أم درمان.
كوبري الإنقاذ حيث يربط الخرطوم مع أم درمان.
كوبري النيل الأزرق القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.
كوبري بُري (القوات المسلحة)حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.
كوبري توتي حيث يربط الخرطوم مع جزيرة توتي التي توجد في النيل الأزرق.
كوبري المك نمر حيث يربط الخرطوم مع خرطوم بحري.
كوبري المنشية حيث يربط الخرطوم مع شرق النيل.
كوبري الدباسين حيث يربط بين الخرطوم وأمدرمان ويوجد علي النيل الأبيض (تحت الإنشاء).
السكك الحديدية

تعتبر الخرطوم إحدى مراكز خطوط السكك الحديدية في السودان، حيث تتجه نحوها كافة الخطوط الممتدة من الولايات المختلفة شرقاً (من جهة كسلا - القضارف - ود مدني) وغرباً (من نيالا - الأبيض عبر تقاطع سنار في الوسط) وشمالاً (من وادي حلفا مروراً بأبو حمد وعطبرة) ومن كريمة في الشمال الغربي إلى الخرطوم، فضلاً عن ذلك تعمل قطارات السكك الحديدية على نقل الركاب داخل مدينة الخرطوم من مناطق الكلاكلة في أقصى جنوب المدينة إلى وسط الخرطوم. وتوجد محطة للقطارات في الخرطوم بحري. وكانت المدينة تعرف نظام الترامواي في ثلاثينيات القرن الماضي قبل أن تتم إزالة خطوطها بعد فترة الاستقلال في وجه التمدد العمراني وكثافة حركة المرور بوسط المدينة.

توالت عمليات تخطيط الخرطوم منذ تشكيل أول لجنة للتخطيط العمراني في عام 1927 م، وكان أبرزها تخطيط عام 1946 و1950 والذي شمل توسيع الطرق والشوارع وإنشاء الحدائق العامة والميادين ويناء امتدادات جديدة في الأحياء لاستيعاب موجات الهجرة السكانية نحو العاصمة. ونتيجة للنمو الديمغرافي والرغبة في تجميل العاصمة شهدت الخرطوم عملية تخطيط في عام 1958، خاصة في المنطقة القريبة من مقرن النيلين وبرز نمط معماري جديد مغاير للنمط الاستعماري، كما تكررت العملية التخطيطية في عام 1977 و1990 م في المنطقة نفسها.
لا يوجد نمط معماري معين أو لون طلاء محدد تتميز به الخرطوم إذ توجد مختلف الأشكال والأنماط والألوان في المدينة، إلا أن من الممكن التمييز بين خطوط معمارية واضحة في طراز الأبنية من حيث تاريخ بنائها، ففي المنطقة الشمالية المطلة على النيل الأزرق يظهر النمط الكولونيالي الذي يعود إلى القرن التاسع عشر والعصر الفيكتوري وما قبله وفن العمارة المملوكية الإسلامية ويتمثل في مباني الوزارات والدواوين الحكومية القديمة التي بناها الأتراك ومن بينها سراي الحكمدار (القصر الجمهوري القديم) في المنطقة المحاذية للنيل الأزرق، ويلاحظ أن هذه المنطقة قد تم تخطيط شوارعها في عهد كتشنر على شكل العلم البريطاني (الصلبان المتقاطعة رأسياً وأفقياً وعرضياً) مستنداً في تخطيطه بشكل عام على مخطط وشنطن الأمريكي مع ادخال بعض العناصر العسكرية كبناء ثكنات الجنود (داخليات جامعة الخرطوم حالياً). (في عام 1908 م، تم تنفيذ مخطط ملكين وهو بمثابة تعديل لتخطيط كتشنر متأثر بتخطيط جاردن سيتي في القاهرة).
ويسود المنطقة التي تليها جنوباً معمار خمسينيات وستينيات القرن الماضي ومن أبرز أمثلته امتداد فندق السودان، وكلما ابتعدنا جنوباً من النيل أو اتجهنا نحو أطرافه الشمالية في منطقة المقرن نجد نماذج لأنماط العمارة المعاصرة مثل قصر المؤتمرات (المسمى بقاعة الصداقة) والذي بناه الصينيون في سبعينيات القرن الماضي وهو شبيه بمباني ميدان السلام الأبدي في بكين، والعمارة الحديثة ممثلة فندق كورينثيا، برج الفاتح سابقاً المبني على شكل بيضة نعام ضخمة ومبنى بنك السودان المركزي الجديد ذو الواجهة الزجاجية.
تشمل العمارة الحديثة مباني الأبراج العالية مثل برج الاتصالات سوداتيل الذي يتكون من 29 طابقاً وبرج شركة بترودار وإدارة الخطوط الجوية السودانية وأبراج القوات المسلحة المصمم أحدها في شكل بارجة والآخر على شكل طائرة وهي من المباني التي تأحذ أشكالاً هندسية وفقاً لدور المؤسسة التي أنشأتها كمقر لها. وتتركز مباني الأبراج في وسط الخرطوم ومنطقتي المقرن وبري.

الميادين والحدائق العامة

أهتم مؤسسو مدينة الخرطوم بالخضرة في المدينة، فقاموا بتشجير شوارعها بأشجار ظليلة كأشجار اللبخ والنيم التي اقيمت على طول الضفة الشرقية للنيل الأزرق والتي تم جلبها من بلدان كالهند، كما شجعوا الأهالي على زراعة الأشجار وإقامة الحدائق في منازلهم وكانت تجرى وحتى سنوات قريبة مسابقات حول أجمل الحدائق المنزلية في منطقة الخرطوم عموم. وفي ستينيات القرن الماضي اقيمت حدائق في الأحياء البعيدة عن مركز المدينة مثل حديقة القرشي وفي سبعينيات القرن ذاته تم تخصيص مساحات واسعة مكسوة بالحشائش والشجيرات في المنطقة القريبة من المقرن. وفي السنوات الأخيرة تم نشر اشجار النخيل في عدد من شوارع المدينة وساحاتها الخضراء. وزاد الاهتمام بالحدائق العامة والبيئة الخضراء وذلك في ضوء تزايد نسبة انبعاث الكربون من السيارات والمصانع ومن هذه الحدائق الساحة الخضراء وهي عبارة عن فضاء متعدد الأغراض حيث توجد فيه ملاعب ومرافق رياضية متاحة للجمهور مضامير لرياضة المشي والعدو ومسرح ثقافي على الهواء الطلق وملاعب أطفال وأماكن ترويح وتحيط بها بضعة محلات تجارية صغيرة لبيع التحف وغيرها ومطاعم ومكتبة عامة.
ومن أبرز الحدائق العامة والمنتزهات الأخرى:

وإلى جانب المنتزهات والحدائق العامة توجد بضعة بساتين توفر بعضها أماكن للرحلات الخلوية بعد الاتفاق مع أصحابها، ومنها بساتين الجريف غرب وبساتين جزيرة توتي.
كما توجد في الخرطوم عدة ميادين وساحات عامة ومنها ميدان جمال عبد الناصر (المحطة الوسطى سابقاً) ميدان محطة السوق العربي وميدان أبو جنزير، وميدان الأمم المتحدة في وسط المدينة، وميدان المولد في الخرطوم جنوب.
ومع ذلك فأن الخرطوم في حاجة إلى مزيد من الساحات والميادين والمنتزهات والحدائق العامة الواسعة المساحة وإعادة تأهيل الأماكن الخضراء الحالية والعناية بها.

المساجد دور العبادة

يدين أغلب سكان الخرطوم بالإسلام، ولذلك توجد بالمدينة أعداداً كبيرة من المساجد. وقد تسارعت وتيرة إنشاء المساجد في الخرطوم بالأحياء وبالمؤسسات وشرعت الطرق الصوفية والجماعات الدينية بإنشاء مساجد خاصة بها. وانتشرت في الآونة الأخيرة ظاهرة المساجد التي تقام في المؤسسات ومن بينها مسجد القوات المسلحة في مقر قيادة القوات المسلحة السودانية جوار قاعة الشهيد الزبير ومسجد القصر في ساحة القصر الجمهوري وغيرها من المساجد المنشرة بأحجام مختلفة في مقرات المؤسسات الحكومية وشركات القطاع الخاص والمؤسسات التعليمية والصحية. ومن المساجد الكبيرة والبارزة في وسط الخرطوم مسجد جامعة الخرطوم ومسجد الشهيد والجامع العتيق (مسجد الخرطوم الكبير) أو مسجد عباس سابقاً، الذي افتتحه الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا في 4 ديسمبر / كانون الأول 1901 م، عند زيارته للسودان. وتتنوع انماط الهندسة المعمارية لهذه المساجد من الطراز المملوكي القديم كما في جامع فاروق إلى الطراز العُثماني كما في مسجد النور والهندسة المعمارية الحديثة في مسجد جامعة الخرطوم. وتوجد بمعظم المساجد مدارس قرآنية تدرس علوم الفقه والتوحيد وغيرها من الدروس الدينية وخلاويها لتعليم النشء كيف الصلاة وغيرها من العبادات وتحفيظ القرآن.

وللمسيحية تاريخاَ طويلاَ في الخرطوم يعود إلى دولة علوة التي اعتنقت الديانة المسيحية في سنة 580 ميلادية وكانت عاصمتها سوبا (إحدى ضواحي الخرطوم حاليا) قبل أن تتعرض للتخريب على يد الفونج في سنة 1504 م،
ثم في العهد العثماني عندما أصبح أراكيل باشا الأرمني المسيحي حاكماً عاماً للسودان في سنة 1857 وخلال فترة الحكم الثنائي الذي كان على رأسه حكام بريطانيون.
(أنظر: ملحق حكام السودان).
وفي 3 ابريل / نيسان 1846 قرر بابا الفاتيكان غريغوري السادس عشر إنشاء مطرانية رسولية لوسط أفريقيا مع أبرشية في الخرطوم وتتبع لها اليوم أربع كنائس في الخرطوم بما فيها كاتدرائية القديس متى والقديس بطرس في منطقة الامتداد الجديد بالخرطوم.
وتتبع لهذه الكنائس مدارس ومنظمات من بينها مدرسة فيلا جيلدا للبنات التابعة للكنيسة الأرثوذكسية بشارع 21 أكتوبر، المتقاطع مع شارع الطيار جميل، ومدارس كمبوني على شارع القصر التي أسسها الأسقف دانيال كمبوني.
وكان في الخرطوم كنيس يهودي يقع في شارع القصر (شارع فكتوريا سابقا) مبنى على طراز معابد السفارديم ويعمل على خدمة اليهود قبل مغادرتهم السودان في أواخر ستينيات القرن الماضي، إلى جانب مقبرة يهودية قديمة بالخرطوم عند مدخل المنطقة الصناعية، جنوب كوبري الحرية.

أسماء الشوارع والميادين العامة في الخرطوم
تفتقر الخرطوم إلى خطة واضحة فيما يتعلق بأسماء الأحياء السكنية والشوارع والميادين العامة، فضلا عن أن معظمها لا توجد عليه لوحات تدل علي اسمه ولا على ارقام العقارات والمنازل المطلة عليه حسبما هو وارد في خططها التخطيطية العديدة، وتتنوع مصادر الأسماء الموجودة والمتعارف عليها فبعض الأحياء السكنية مثلاً يحمل أسماء أحياء أو مدن عربية ظهرت بعض موجات الهجرة إلى تلك البلدان خاصة دول الخليج ومن هذه الأحياء: الرياض والطائف (مدن سعودية) والدوحة (مدينة قطرية) والمنشية والجاردن سيتي (أحياء مدن مصرية) والأندلس (مغربية) ووالقادسية (عراقية).
ومن أسماء الشوارع: شارع غوردون (نسبة للجنرال غوردون باشا) حاكم السودان في أواخر فترة حكم التركية السابقة في السودان وتبدل اسمه بعد استقلال السودان في عام 1956 وفي إطار سياسة السودنة إلي شارع الجامعة (نسبة إلى جامعة الخرطوم المطلة عليه)، وشارع فكتوريا (نسبة للملكة فكتوريا ملكة بريطانيا) وأصبح شارع القصر، وهناك شارع ونجت باشا سمي باسم (ريجنالد ونجت حاكم عام السودان في الفترة 1899 - 1916، وأصبح اسمه لاحقاً شارع البرلمان أما شارع السردار (وهو قائد القوات البريطانية إبان فترة الاستعمار الحكم الثنائي) أصبح شارع الجمهورية وشارع الدفتردار (نسب إلى الدفتردار محمد، صهر محمد على باشا في سنة 1821 م) أصبح شارع المك نمر (نسبة للمك نمر حاكم شندي الذي قتل قائد الجيش العثماني المصري في سنة 1821 م) وشارع إسماعيل باشا (نسبة إلى إسماعيل باشا نجل محمد علي باشا وقائد الحملة على السودان قي سنة 1821م) وأصبح شــارع علي عبد اللطيف (أحد رموز المقاومة الوطنية ضد الاستعمار البريطاني في السودان) وشارع محمد نجيب (أول رئيس وزراء مصر ي بعد ثورة تموز / يوليو 1952 م) ولم يتغير اسم الشارع تخليداً لذكرى محمد نجيب ذو الأصول والسودانية (أمه مصرية وأبوه سوداني) كذلك لم يتغير اسم شارع كاترينا نسبة إلى مدام كاترينا اليونانية الأصل وصاحبة متجر في ستينيات القرن الماضي كان يقع شرق حديقة القرشي بالخرطوم والتي بدورها كانت تعرف باسم حديقة عبود في عام 1960 نسبة إلى الرئيس إبراهيم عبود وتحولت إلى حديقة القرشي نسبة إلى شهيد ثورة أكتوبر أحمد القرشي والتي أطاحت بحكومة الرئيس عبود. ومن شوارع الخرطوم الأخرى التي تحمل أسماء سودانية شارع السيد عبد الرحمن (نسبة إلى عبد الرحمن المهدي زعيم طائفة الأنصار ورمز منم رموز الاستقلال) وشارع السيد علي الميرغني (زعيم طائفة الختمية وأحد رموز الاستقلال)، وشارع عبيد ختم الذي سمي على الشهيد عبيد ختم، وهي تسمية جديدة وشارع البلابل (نسبة إلى فرقة البلابل| الغنائية المشهورة في السودان). وأطلق على الشارع الرئيس المؤدي إلى مطار الخرطوم الدولي اسم شارع إفريقيا.
أما الميادين العامة فمن أشهرها ميدان عباس (سمي على اسم الخديو عباس) وتحول اسمه لاحقاً إلى ميدان الأمم المتحدة ثم اقيمت في مساحته مكتبة القبة الخضراء وأخيراً مول الواحة، وهناك ميدان عبد المنعم محمد (أحد رجال الأعمال البارزين) تمت إعادة تسميته إلى ميدان نادي الأسرة.
ولعل من أبرز ساحات وميادين الخرطوم العامة ميدان أبو جنزير وسمي على اسم الشيخ أبو جنزير (وهو أحد شيوخ الصوفية في الخرطوم كان يدير خلوة لتدريس القرآن في هذا المكان حتى توفي ودفن فيه وأقيم عليه ضريحاً له كان موجودا حتى وقت فريب تحيط به سلسلة من الحلقات الحديدية الصنع)، كذلك يوجد في الخرطوم ميدان جاكسون بمنطقة الخرطوم غرب والذي لم يكن معروفاً بشكل واسع قبل أن يتم مؤخراً تحويل موقف حافلات الركاب العامة إليه من مواقفها بمنطقة وسط الخرطوم (وسمي الميدان والحي الذي يقع عليه بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى جاكسون باشا مهندس المساحة الإنجليزي ببلدية الخرطوم في عام 1920 م.

معالم الخرطوم
الاقتصاد
كتب ونستون تشرشل رئيس وزراء بريطانيا الأسبق، في كتابه حرب النهر، عن الخرطوم وقال «إن مدينة الخرطوم الواقعة عند التقاء النيلين الأزرق والأبيض، هي النقطة التي يجب أن تلتقي فيها التجارة حتماً مع الجنوب. وهي الصنبور الكبير الذي تمر من خلاله البضائع التي تم جمعها من منطقة واسعة وتنساب شمالا نحو ساحل البحر المتوسط. فهي معلم لأقصى حدود شمال السودان الخصب. وينساب النهر بين الخرطوم وأسوان لمسافة 1 كيلومتر عبر الصحراء القاحلة».

لايزال اقتصاد الخرطوم يعتمد على التجارة وإعادة توزيع البضائع والسلع وعلى قطاع الخدمات، خاصة الخدمات المالية كالبنوك ومكاتب الصرافة والتأمينات وغيرها.
وكانت التجارة في فترة الحكم الثنائي حكراً على ثلاث شركات بريطانية تهيمن على الصادر والوارد في السودان وهي: شركة متشل كوتس، وشركة سودان مركنتايل، وشركة جلاتلي هانكي وشركائهم، حيث يقوم التجار المحليون ببيع المحاصيل الزراعية السودانية من قطن وصمغ عربي وسمسم وفول سوداني لتلك الشركات التي تقوم بدورها تصدير السلع السودانية للخارج واستيراد سلع وبضائع أجنبية وبيعها لتجار الجملة المحليين.
يتنوع النشاط الاقتصادي الحالي في المدينة من زراعي إلى صناعي وسياحي، ويتركز بصفة أساسية على قطاع الخدمات حيث نجد مجموعة كبيرة من السكان تعمل في دواوين الدولة وشركات وبنوك القطاع الخاص، كما أن هناك شريحة كبيرة من اصحاب رؤوس الأموال تمارس التجارة، أما سكان المناطق الريفية المحيطة بالمدينة وبعض القاطنين علي ضفاف النيل فيعملون بالزراعة والرعي ويمدون العاصمة بالخضر والفاكهة والألبان واللحوم والأسماك، ومنهم من يمارس صناعة الفخار والطوب.

المصارف والنشاط المالي
تقع معظم المقار الرئيسية للبنوك التجارية في الخرطوم (حوالي 15 مصرفاً) من بينها بنك الخرطوم وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لبنك السودان المركزي إلى جانب الشركات الأجنبية المستثمرة في السودان كشركات جنوب شرقي آسيا بما فيها الشركات الصينية (مثل شركة النفط الوطنية الصينية) والماليزية (كشركة بتروناس) وغيرها وتوجد في الخرطوم بورصة باسم سوق الخرطوم للأوراق المالية تم انشائها في عام 1995 وبلغ عدد الأسهم المتداولة فيها في عام 2012 حوالي 183,491.5 ألف سهم وحجم التبادل في العام ذاته 3,073.5 مليون جنيه سوداني. ولعل وجود مسبك لضرب العملة المعدنية في الخرطوم يدل على الطابع التجاري والاقتصادي للمدينة.

الأندية الاجتماعية والرياضية
تشتهر الخرطوم بالأندية والمراكز الثقافية والاجتماعية والرياضية العديدة، ويعود تاريخ تأسيس بعضها إلى فترات قديمة مثل نادي السودان Sudan Club الذي أسسه البريطانيون إبان الحكم الثنائي ليكون ملتقى اجتماعياً لموظفيهم، والنادي العربي وأسسه المصريون، إلى جانب أندية الجاليات المختلفة مثل النادي السوري والنادي الأرمني والنادي الألماني والنادي اليوناني والنادي الكاثوليكي والنادي الهندي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، ومعهد جوتة الألماني، وشهدت العقود القليلة الماضية تأسيس أندية سودانية مماثلة مثل نادي الضباط ونادي الشرطة.وتقام في هذه الأندية عدة فعاليات ثقافية واجتماعية ورياضية خاصة في مواسم الأعياد الدينية والوطنية.

كبار زوار الخرطوم
المنظمات الدولية في الخرطوم
هناك عدد من المنظمات الدولية العربية والإفرقية التي اتخذت من الخرطوم مقراً رئيسياً لها ومنها:

السكان
تتنوع التركيبة السكانية للخرطوم نتيجة الهجرات العديدة إليها منذ عهود قديمة فإلى جانب الجنسيات والقوميات المختلفة التي قدمت ضمن جيوش محمد علي باشا واعداد الموظفين الكبيرة من أصول غير سودانية مثل الأتراك والجركس والأرناؤوط والأغريق والبنيان والسوريين والمصريين والأرمن والأكراد ووفدت مؤخراً إلى الخرطوم عمالة أجنبية شملت الأتراك ومن آسيا كالصينيين والبنغال وهاجرت إلى الخرطوم جماعات من البلدان الأفريقية المجاورة وغير المجاورة لأسباب سياسية واقتصادية ونتيجة لموجات الجفاف في بلدانها ومن بين هؤلاء المهاجرين لاجئين من إثيوبيا واريتريا وتشاد وزائير ومن الصومال وجنوب أفريقيا وسورية،
هذا فضلاً عن الهجرات الداخلية من ولايات السودان المختلفة لأسباب عديدة في مقدمتها الهجرة التقليدية من الريف إلى الحضر ولأسباب القتال في بعضها كما في دارفور وجنوب كردفان.
نما عدد سكان المدينة من 245,000 في عام 1955 إلى
784000 نسمة في عام 1973، و1،343,000 شخص في عام 1983 ليصل إلى 3 ملايين فرد في تعداد عام 1993. ويشكل الذكور نسبة 54 في المائة من السكان، مما يعكس وضعا يهيمن فيه الذكور على عملية الهجرة إلى الخرطوم وتبين الإحصاءات الديمغرافية للخرطوم بأن حوالي 61 في المائة من السكان
تتراوح أعمارهم بين 15-64 عاما مما يدل على أن منطقة الخرطوم الكبرى تستقطب المجموعات السكانية الأكثر إنتاجية وتعتبر أم درمان الجزء الأكثر اكتظاظا بالسكان
بنسبة|نسبة تقدر بحوالي 43.5 في المائة من مجموع سكان العاصمة المثلثة، ولكنها الأقل نسبة من حيث عدد الأفراد في كل أسرة (6.1) فرد في حين أن الرقم هو (6.5) في الخرطوم بحري، و (6.4) في الخرطوم. ويشكل الأجانب نسبة لا تزيد على 1.4 في المائة من مجموع السكان وهو رقم أخذ في التزايد بشكل مضطرد منذ اكتشاف النفط، ونمو أعمال التصدير. وعند تصنيف السكان حسب الديانة يظهر بأن الإسلام هو دين الأغلبية بنسبة تبلغ 88.6 في المائة، مقابل 11.2 في المائة للمسيحيين الذين ازدادت أعدادهم في العقود الأخيرة بشكل ملحوظ نتيجة لتوافد أعداد كبيرة من النازحين واللاجئين
من جنوب السودان وجبال النوبة ومن إثيوبيا وأريتريا هرباً من الحروب الأهلية في مناطق سكناهم الأصلية. وعلى الرغم من أن معدل وفيات الأطفال الرضع قد انخفض في الخرطوم، فإنه لا يزال عالياً جدا. وكان معدل الأمية في الخرطوم قد بلغ في عام 1993 حوالي 26.4 في المائة لكلا الجنسين، (18.9 في المائة للذكور و35 في المائة للإناث) وفقا لصندوق الأمم المتحدة للسكان، ولكنها وفقاً لدراسات سودانية في عام 1998 لا تزيد عن 4 بالمائة.

تعاني الخرطوم من مشاكل بيئية واضحة تتمثل في مشكلة نقل النفايات ومشكلة الصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الأمطار ومشاكل طبيعية أخرى تتمثل في الفيضانات والأتربة والزحف الصحراوي ونحت التربة في ضفاف النيل.
وتتمثل المشاكل الاجتماعية في ظاهرة التشرد واطفال الشوارع، نتيجة موجات اللاجئين التي شهدتها المدينة بسبب الحروب والقتال في الداخل وفي البلدان المجاورة والهجرة من الريف إلى المدينة وما نتج عن ذلك من انتشار السكن العشوائي في الأطراف الهامشية للمدينة والباعة المتجولين في أسواقها.

Khartoum, en arabe : الخرطوم (al-Khurṭūm), est la capitale du Soudan. Elle est située au confluent du Nil Blanc (venant du Soudan du Sud) et du Nil Bleu (venant d'Éthiopie).
La ville elle-même compte plus de deux millions d'habitants ; avec les districts environnants d'Omdourman à l'ouest et de Bahri au nord, elle constitue une agglomération d'au moins sept millions d'habitants en 2023, la plus grande du pays.

Histoire
La ville est fondée en 1821 par les troupes de Méhémet Ali, pour bénéficier d'une position jugée stratégique sur la route des caravanes entre Égypte et Éthiopie, au nord de l'ancienne cité de Soba. 
Les Britanniques prennent contrôle de la ville à l'issue de la guerre anglo-égyptienne de 1882. En 1884-1885, la ville est assiégée pendant neuf mois par les troupes de l'insurrection mahdiste, qui s'en emparèrent et massacrent les troupes anglo-égyptiennes, commandées par le général Gordon, qui contrôlaient alors le Soudan. En 1898, les Britanniques parviennent à reprendre la ville.
Sévèrement touchée par les aléas de la guerre durant ces années, la ville est entièrement reconstruite selon les plans d'un architecte britannique et devient la capitale du condominum anglo-égyptien, puis du Soudan à partir de l'indépendance de 1956.
En 1973, des terroristes palestiniens du groupe Septembre noir attaquent l'ambassade saoudienne et tuent deux diplomates américains et un belge.

À la suite des attentats du 7 août 1998 contre les ambassades américaines à Nairobi (Kenya) et Dar es Salaam (Tanzanie), attentats imputés à Oussama ben Laden et Al-Qaïda, les États-Unis d'Amérique, en représailles, bombardent, le 20 août suivant, une usine de produits pharmaceutiques située à Khartoum (outre les frappes visant des camps en Afghanistan).
Le 3 juin 2019, après le coup d'État qui renverse Omar el-Bechir, l'armée tue plus d'une centaine de manifestants qui protestaient contre le nouveau régime.
Au moins 23 personnes sont tuées et plus de 130 sont blessées dans l'incendie d'une usine au nord de la ville, en décembre 2019.
Le 1er juillet 2020, des militants ont exigé que la rue al-Zibar Basha à Khartoum soit renommée. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur était un marchand d'esclaves et la rue al-Zibar Basha mène à la base militaire où le massacre de Khartoum en 2019 a eu lieu.
Le 26 octobre 2021, la ville a été bouclée à la suite d'un coup d'État militaire qui a fait au moins 7 morts, déclenchant des manifestations et des appels à la grève générale. Le Premier ministre Abdalla Hamdok a été arrêté lors du coup d’État et détenu avec d’autres membres du cabinet dans un lieu inconnu.
Le 15 avril 2023, des combats entre les forces armées soudanaises et les RSF ont éclaté à travers le Soudan, y compris à Khartoum. Des combats ont été signalés au palais présidentiel, au siège des RSF, à l'aéroport international de Khartoum et à l'aéroport de Merowe, que les RSF prétendent avoir capturé. Les forces armées soudanaises ont repris le contrôle total de Khartoum le 26 mars 2025.

Géographie
Khartoum est située au centre-est du pays et au confluent du Nil Bleu et du Nil Blanc. Omdurman se trouve au nord-nord-ouest de la capitale, sur la rive gauche du Nil Blanc, et Bahri au nord. La position de cette dernière lui fait border les deux cours d'eau, à l'égal de Khartoum. L'île de Tuti est visible au centre du confluent, entre les trois villes.

Climat
Khartoum bénéficie d'un climat aride à longue saison sèche « hivernale », typique de la zone saharo-sahélienne qui marque la transition progressive entre le Sahara, espace aride, et le Sahel, espace semi-aride. Le climat y est extrêmement sec pendant une bonne partie de l'année avec près de neuf mois où les précipitations moyennes sont inférieures ou égales à 5 mm. La très longue saison sèche est elle-même subdivisée en une saison très sèche et chaude qui dure de novembre à mars et en une saison sèche et très chaude qui dure d'avril à juin. Pendant cette partie de l'année, les alizés continentaux, chauds et secs, associés au régime anticyclonique, venus des déserts, balayent la région, notamment l'harmattan (vent de secteur nord ou nord-est) : le ciel est parfaitement dégagé, le temps est clair, stable, très sec, et l'inhibition pluviométrique y est totale. La saison des pluies, très brève et irrégulière, dure environ un mois et le maximum pluviométrique est atteint en août avec près de 75 mm. En revanche, la saison des pluies résulte d'un changement du régime des vents : la région est alors soumise au régime dépressionnaire associé à la remontée vers le nord de la zone de convergence intertropicale. Les précipitations moyennes annuelles sont très faibles avec seulement 162 mm d'eau. On enregistre en moyenne six jours par an avec 10 mm ou plus et dix-neuf jours par an avec 1 mm ou plus de précipitations. 
Les températures les plus élevées se rencontrent à deux périodes de l'année : la première à la fin de la saison sèche, où les températures moyennes maximales dépassent constamment 40 °C d'avril à juin et la seconde au tout début de la saison sèche où les températures moyennes maximales dépassent 39 °C pendant les mois de septembre et d'octobre. Cependant, des pics à 40 °C ou plus sont susceptibles de se produire entre fin février et fin novembre. On enregistre, par an, jusqu'à 170 jours par an où le mercure atteint ou dépasse la barre des 40 °C. Ces deux maximums thermiques s'expliquent par le fait que dans cette zone, le soleil atteint son zénith à deux périodes bien différentes. Les températures moyennes maximales restent supérieures à 30 °C pendant les mois les moins chauds. Khartoum est l'une des grandes villes les plus chaudes du monde, avec une températures moyenne journalière annuelle de près de 30 °C. C'est aussi une des grandes villes les plus ensoleillées au monde, avec une durée moyenne annuelle d'ensoleillement tournant autour de 3 700 heures[réf. nécessaire].

Culture
Le musée national du Soudan conserve une partie des fresques de la cathédrale de Faras qui ont été sauvées de 1961 à 1964 dans le cadre d'une mission de l'UNESCO pour le sauvetage des temples de Nubie des eaux du lac Nasser, par l'équipe d'archéologues polonais de Kazimierz Michalowski[réf. nécessaire]. 

La cathédrale qui a fonctionné sans interruption du VIIIe siècle au XIVe siècle contenait cent soixante-neuf fresques dont soixante-sept sont désormais conservées dans la collection du musée national de Varsovie, créé tout exprès pour les accueillir et au musée de Khartoum.

Enseignement supérieur
Khartoum est le siège principal de la plupart des principaux établissements d’enseignement du Soudan. Il existe quatre principaux niveaux d’enseignement :

Jardin d'enfants et garderie. Cela commence à l'âge de 3-4 ans et se compose de 1 à 2 niveaux (selon les parents).
École primaire. Les élèves de première année entrent à l’âge de 6-7 ans. Il comprend 8 niveaux, après lesquels, à 13-14 ans, les élèves sont prêts à passer les examens de certificat et à entrer au lycée.
Lycée. Dans ces trois méthodes scolaires, on ajoute quelques matières académiques principales telles que la chimie, la biologie, la physique et la géographie. Il y a trois niveaux à ce niveau. L'âge des étudiants varie entre 14-15 et 17-18 ans.
Enseignement supérieur. Il existe plusieurs universités et collèges à Khartoum, notamment l'Université de Khartoum et l'Université soudanaise des sciences et technologies.

Transports
Khartoum abrite le plus grand aéroport du Soudan, l'aéroport international de Khartoum. C'est la plaque tournante principale de Sudan Airways, le principal transporteur du Soudan. Un nouvel aéroport était prévu dans la périphérie sud de la ville, mais avec la croissance rapide de Khartoum et l'étalement urbain qui en résulte, l'aéroport est toujours situé au cœur de la ville[réf. nécessaire].

Le transport à Khartoum se limite au réseau routier, les bus et les véhicules personnels constituant les principaux types de véhicules. Comme dans de nombreuses villes du continent, certaines parties de Khartoum sont reliées par des bus privés.

Économie
Après la signature de l'accord de paix global historique entre le gouvernement du Soudan et le Mouvement populaire de libération du Soudan (SPLA), le gouvernement du Soudan a lancé un projet de développement de grande envergure. En 2007, les plus grands projets à Khartoum étaient le projet de développement Al-Mogran, deux hôtels cinq étoiles, un nouvel aéroport, le pont El Mek Nimr (achevé en octobre 2007) et le pont Tuti qui relie Khartoum à l'île de Tuti[réf. nécessaire].
Au XXIe siècle, Khartoum s’est développé grâce à la richesse pétrolière du Soudan (bien que l’indépendance du Soudan du Sud en 2011 ait eu un impact négatif sur l’économie du Soudan). Le centre de la ville possède des rues bordées d'arbres. Khartoum a la plus forte concentration d’activité économique du pays. La situation a changé à mesure que des développements économiques majeurs ont lieu dans d’autres régions du pays, comme l’exploration pétrolière dans le sud, le complexe industriel de Giad dans l’État d’Al Jazirah et le projet sucrier du Nil Blanc dans le centre du Soudan, et le barrage de Merowe dans le nord[réf. nécessaire].
Parmi les industries de la ville, on trouve l'imprimerie, la fabrication du verre, la transformation des aliments et le textile. Les produits pétroliers sont désormais produits dans l’extrême nord de l’État de Khartoum, fournissant du carburant et des emplois à la ville. L’une des plus grandes raffineries du Soudan est située dans le nord de Khartoum[réf. nécessaire].

Commerce de détail
Le Souq al Arabi est le plus grand marché en plein air de Khartoum. Le Bazar s'étend sur plusieurs pâtés de maisons dans le centre de Khartoum, juste au sud de la Grande Mosquée (Mesjid al-Kabir) et de la gare des minibus. Il est divisé en sections distinctes, dont une entièrement consacrée à l'or[réf. nécessaire].
Les rues Al Qasr et Al Jamhoriyah sont considérées comme les rues principales les plus célèbres de l'État de Khartoum[réf. nécessaire].
Le centre commercial Afra est situé dans la banlieue sud d'Arkeweet. Le centre commercial Afra dispose d'un supermarché, de points de vente au détail, de cafés, d'un bowling, de cinémas et d'une aire de jeux pour enfants[réf. nécessaire].
En 2011, le Soudan a ouvert la section hôtelière et une partie de l'aire de restauration de la nouvelle tour de l'hôtel Corinthia. La section Centre commercial/Shopping est encore en construction.
Khartoum est connu pour le souk Libya, un des plus grands marchés de la région, comptant environ 3 800 boutiques.

Lieux de culte
Parmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées musulmanes.   Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Archidiocèse de Khartoum (Église catholique), Église intérieure du Soudan (Alliance baptiste mondiale), Presbyterian Church in Sudan (Communion mondiale d'Églises réformées)[réf. nécessaire].

## Overview
Khartoum (Arabic: الخرطوم Al-Khartum) is the capital of Sudan and is located where the Blue and White Niles merge to form the Nile. The huge, spread-out city is actually made out of three distinct cities (Khartoum, Khartoum North or Bahri, and Omdurman) which are divided by the Nile and its two arms. The Blue Nile flows between Khartoum and Bahri, the White Nile between Khartoum and Omdurman, and the merged Nile between Bahri and Omdurman. The confluence of the Blue and White Nile, known as Al-Mogran, lies just north of the bridge between Khartoum and Omdurman.
Khartoum proper is the seat of the Sudanese government and is the largest of the three cities. The older part of the city lies beside the White Nile while the newer parts, such as Al-Amarat and Khartoum Two, spread out to the south, across the railway line and the ring road, and around the airport runway. The city, both the old part and its newer extensions, is laid out mostly in a grid. Omdurman has a more Middle Eastern atmosphere with maze-like streets and is home to the huge Souq Omdurman. Bahri is largely industrial and residential.

## By plane
15.58949732.5531611 Khartoum Airport (KRT  IATA). Is the main gateway into Sudan by air. The airport is served by various Middle Eastern and African airlines. Among the cities with direct connections with Khartoum are: EgyptAir (Cairo), Emirates (Dubai), Ethiopian Airlines (Addis Ababa), Gulf Air (Bahrain), Kenya Airlines (Nairobi), Qatar Airways (Doha) Turkish Airlines (Istanbul).
Sudan's national carrier Sudan Airways[dead link] links Khartoum and several African and regional capitals, and with Sudan's domestic airports at Port Sudan, Nyala, El-Fashir, Malakal, Juba, Dongola, Wadi Halfa and El-Obeid.
Go early as the airport can get a bit chaotic. Be prepared for long waits and queue cutting. Immigration checks and other security checks can also take a long time. No departure tax should be paid anymore, as it's included in a ticket price.
There is a bank facility to change money open during the night when there are flights.
Getting to town: the airport is located close to the city in Al-Amarat. Taxi fare from Khartoum airport to city was a fixed SDG 100 in 2015. You can also walk out to the main road about 200 m from the airport terminal and catch minibuses that cruise along the road. Alternatively you can book a metered taxi.

## By bus
The chaotic Souq al-Shaabi used to be the main bus terminal for long distance south-bound buses in Khartoum, but a new terminal 15.52725232.5435852 Khartoum Land terminal (Meena al Barre) has been built which is more orderly. Buses leave for Port Sudan, Wad Medani, Kassala, El-Obeid, Karima (8 hr, SGD 275), Gedarif (6 hr, SGD 275) and other cities. Again, there are no buses to southern Sudan.
Buses to Atbara depart from 15.62402832.5437783 Khartoum North Bus Station (also known as Shendi Bus Station).

## By train
Rail services to Khartoum are limited, but investment have brought hopes of a rejuvenation of train travel. There is the daily Nile Express from Atbara as well as services three times per day from Wad Madani. Older, more infrequent trains run from Port Sudan, Wadi Halfa - for connections with ferries from Egypt - and even Nyala. There main station is 15.63377132.5405834 Khartoum North (Bahri).

## By car
Describing Khartoum's traffic as chaotic is a bit of an understatement. The economic boom has put many more cars on the road, although driving attitudes have not changed, resulting in almost comical chaos at intersections. As Khartoum is laid out in a grid, there are many intersections for cars from all directions to barge in to fight for space. Having said that, the slow speed of vehicles ensures that they are very few major accidents, at least in the city. If you are not used to such driving conditions, it is better to resort to taxis.
Car hire is available and costs a bit above the African average.  However if you want to head off in to the desert the costs mount further, as the 100 km is standard, and then there is an additional charge per kilometre. Fuel costs around SDG 27 (US$4.20) per litre (Nov 2016).  ‘Limousine’ is the Arabic word for car hire – try along Airport Road or Ibed Khetim Road (east of the airport) for car hire places.

## By boat
There are no ferry services between the three cities as they are well connected by road bridges.
There is a ferry service between Khartoum proper and Tuti Island, a rural islet in the middle of the Blue Nile. In Khartoum, boats leave from the river bank along Nile Street opposite the Friendship Hall to the west of the city center. A ferry also runs between Tuti and Omdurman (except on Fridays)

## Get around
Khartoum is both easy and difficult to get around. It is easy in that much of the city is laid out on a grid, with long straight roads and the airport and Nile as easy reference places. It is difficult in that the city (or indeed the 3 cities) are very spread out, making walking a long and tiring option.
Maps are hard to come by, but Google Earth offers some good high-resolution images.

## By taxi
These come in three varieties; bright yellow and often beaten up Toyota Corollas Model 1977, small 6-seater minivans, and more modern metered taxis.
Fair "foreigner" prices for taxis are roughly: SDG 17.50 plus SDG 4.61 per km.
Most taxi drivers speak no English, can't read maps, and often can't read Arabic either; they often even have little idea about Khartoum's geography, especially about other parts of the city to where you pick him up.
LimoTrip, ☏ +249 18 359 1313, info@limotrip.net. Air conditioned metered taxis with two-way radio.

## By minibus
Minibuses are the cheapest way to get around Khartoum, especially between the three cities. There are easily thousands of minibuses and seeing all of them gather near the Great Mosque and Souk al-Arabi is a sight to behold. They are however quite complicated to use. None of them bear destination signs and you will have to be able to speak a little Arabic with their conductors to determine which minibus to take. They are also always packed to the brim. Fares are SDG 3-5 (June 2017).
Most of the minibuses leave from the square near the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) or nearby in Khartoum proper.

## By three-wheeled taxis
Called "bajaj" (like in India) or "raksha", they are cheaper than taxis but more expensive than buses so less than SDG 5 per trip. They are best used for short trips within each of Khartoum's three cities. It is better to use taxis or minibuses if you have to cross the Nile to travel between the three cities.

## Khartoum (الخرطوم)
Nile Street or Shari'a Al-Nilشارع النيل الخرطوم: Probably the prettiest street in Khartoum. With the Blue Nile on one side, the street is lined with pretty, albeit decaying-looking, colonial buildings, most of which are used as ministries, schools and even a hotel, the Grand Holiday Villa Khartoum. The Presidential Palace, also fronting the Blue Nile, is a pretty building but you will not be allowed to walk in front of it - the guards will ask you to cross the road and proceed behind and around the building. You will also see the modern side of Khartoum along this street - the egg-shaped, Libyan-owned Al-Fateh Tower; Chinese-built Friendship Hall. The National Museum is also along Nile Street. The road is tree-lined most of the way (except towards the west) and has a sidewalk, so walking is quite pleasant. Many people sit on the concrete walls along the river.
15.60832.5290351 Sudan Presidential Palace Museum. This museum is located in the grounds of the Presidential Palace and is housed in the impressive century old Palace Cathedral. The palace contains many relics and pieces related to Sudan's administrative and modern political history, from paintings of Sir Gordon Pasha to the Presidential cars of more recent rulers.
The Changing of the Guard: This is a ceremony held on the first Friday of every month, where the Black Guard and the White Guard of the Presidential Palace swap over. The ceremony is performed near the South Gate of the palace.
15.61493832.4921222 Confluence of the Blue and White Nile. If you have the stamina, you will reach the confluence of the two branches of the Nile if you continue walking west along Nile Street for about 3–4 km from the Presidential Palace. The confluence is called Al-Mogran and it is best seen from the metal bridge (the old one, not the newer concrete one) linking Khartoum and Omdurman or Al-Mogran Family Park. It is said that one can actually see the two different colours from the different branches come together and flow separately for a distance downriver before mixing together. The Al-Mogran Family Park, which has a Ferris wheel and other rides, is located near the bridge. Warning: There is a signboard saying "no photos" from the bridge. Please heed it as people have been arrested for taking photos of the confluence!    (updated Jan 2019)
15.60234232.5245263 Souq Arabi. If you want to see crowds and action, this is the place. The commercial heart of town, Souq Arabi (Arabian Market) can provide everything you need (see "Buy" section for more details on shopping options). The market is huge and spread over several squares in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. Come here to see Khartoumites go about their daily lives.
15.60632.5084 National Museum of Sudan (متحف السودان القومي), 1 Nile Street (Next to the Friendship Hall, just west of the Libyan-financed Burj el-Fatih sail-hotel.). Open from Monday to Friday. Surprisingly impressive museum that has had a bit of a revamp.  The large hall contains exhibits that rival those in the ancient Egypt sections of the British Museum or the New York Met, however if you’ve arrived in Khartoum fresh from temple gazing in Egypt things may look familiar.  The gardens contain three temples relocated from Aswan.  The joy of the place is that you’ll have it all pretty much to yourself. Best visit in the mornings, and give yourself 2 hours, tends to close at 12:00 but not reopen at 15:00, contrary to the sign on the door.      (updated Jul 2022)
15.6079932.5342375 Sudan Ethnographic Museum. A fascinating little museum on the corner of Al Gamaa street and Mak Nemir Avenue. This museum explores the various cultures and traditions of Sudan's numerous ethnic groups. Displays range from intricate handicrafts to models of traditional homes. This museum is certainly worth a visit, if you have the time.

15.61049232.5339148 St. Matthew's Cathedral. Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic cathedral, built in 1908.   (updated Jul 2022)

## Omdurman
Kandahar, souq Libya. At this restaurant you choose the meat that you want cooked (usually a choice between camel and lamb), you then hand over the meat to be cooked as part of your meal. Kandahar is one of the few places in Khartoum where you can find camel meat. It is located in Souq Libya in the peripheries of Omdurman. (updated Jan 2011)

## Bahri (Khartoum North)
15.64638632.56155613 Bombed Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. a fascinating place to explore, and well off the Khartoum tourist trail (if Khartoum even has such a thing). Tomahawked in 1998 the remains are an eerie reminder of Sudan's precarious relationship with the West. It's quite easy to reach - get a minibus to Bahri, then get a taxi.  The guards are quite friendly and will let you in for a wander - a contribution would be gratefully received.
15.61438132.64512814 Nuba Wrestling. Every Friday at 16:00 two teams of wrestlers battle it out in front of several hundred spectators – and it certainly is quite a spectacle and well worth the trip.  Finishes around 18:00 and cost SDG 2.  It’s about 12 km from central Khartoum next to souq Sita Al Haj Yousef – best get a taxi there but you can easily find a bus back to al-Arabi in central Khartoum for SDG 3-5.
15.9778332.5497415 Umm Marrahi fort (30 km north of the city). Ruined fortress on the top of Umm Marrahi hill, the defences was built in the 2nd half of the 6th century AD by the kingdom of Alwa.   (updated May 2021)

## Clubs
There are many professional and international clubs spread around the three cities. Providing for sport, cultural activities or simply a place to meet, they are a lively remnant of British influence.
Greek club. Khartoum 2, entrance off Mak Nimir Ave. The hideout of Sudan's Greek community, it is open to the public and offers sports facilities (tennis, volleyball, basketball, football, running), a swimming pool (entrance fee SDG 30) and basic food and drinks.
Coptic club.
German club. Nothing especially German, a basketball court, a garden in the shade of trees and a swimming pool. It also serves as a hotel.
Indian club. Omdurman. The center of the capital's large Indian community social life, it organizes events for all important Indian festivals.
A wander around Tuti island is highly recommended if you want to see green rather than the brown of Khartoum. If you are heading to Omdurman, a good way of unwinding after the chaos of the souq is to catch the ferry across to Tuti from Omdurman (except Fridays) or take the Tuti Suspension Bridge. Aim for around 17:00-18:00 to enjoy Tuti in the early evening.
A Nile cruise, several boats moored by Tuti Bridge are available for cruises. A cruise on some of the smaller boats can cost you as little as SDG 15.

## Cultural centers
Centre Culturel Français. Downtown, Ali Dinar St. Offers French courses, Sudanese Arabic courses, a library and cultural events (music, art, literature, conferences, movies). Ask for the program at: info@ccfkrt.org.

Iranian Cultural Center. Al Amarat, corner of Airport Rd and St 27.

## In the evening
Evening tea on Nile Avenue. With the extension of Nile Avenue to Manshia complete, the stretch of road between Mak Nimir and Manshia bridges has become the place to be of Khartoum's evening life. Innumerable tea ladies cater to the needs of the crowd enjoying the grass while watching the road and the river.

## Music
Concerts. The Sudanese music scene is active. Artists of the moment play live in clubs, mostly on weekend evenings. Look for the Arabic posters that dot the city or ask the locals.
Weddings. It is common for Sudanese to hire star musicians to perform one or two of their favourite piece at wedding ceremonies. The footage of the performance usually ends up as an unofficial video clip on the Sudanese TV channels.
Creative events. Khartoum youth and amateur scene can be spotted at one of the numerous and often changing cultural events. Whether Wapi (British Council), Makaan, Space or Khartoum Open Mic', they offer a scene for young musicians, hip hoppers, dancers, slammers and poets. Most accurate information is to be found on Facebook.
Khartoum International Music Festival.

## Movies
Cinemas. The last commercial cinemas closed in 2009 but the open air buildings of the Coliseum (Souk al Arabi), Halfaya and Watania(Khartoum North) or Watania (Omdurman) can still be spotted. Afra Mall movie theaters still shows movies, mainly Bollywood or Egyptian.
Film festivals. The European Union and the Embassy of Venezuela organize yearly film festivals. The French Cultural Center offers free weekly projections as does occasionally the Goethe Institute.

## Buy
Most shopping is still done in street markets or souqs. The souqs here are not as attractive those in other Middle Eastern countries but are still interesting enough for a glimpse of Sudanese economics. And you can certainly buy everything you need, including handicrafts if you are a tourist, from these markets. Prices are not amazingly low due to transport costs for imported (mainly Chinese) goods, but cheaper than in Afra Mall or proper shops. Upmarket, Khartoum has only one shopping mall with a supermarket, several shops and food outlets.

## Khartoum
Souq Arabi In the city centre, this is your classical chaotic market teeming with people. The market is divided in to several sections, each focussing on a certain product. There is even one block devoted to gold, although it certainly looks less sophisticated and organised than its counterpart in Dubai. However, this souq is a bit lacking in term of handicrafts and fresh foodstuff. You are better off going to Souq Omdurman (see below) for handicrafts.
15.55932532.5549721 Afra Mall, Africa Road in the southern suburb of Arkawet. Afra is Khartoum's and Sudan's only mall but don't expect too much. Afra is already starting to lose it new shininess - it is more like a small neighbourhood mall rather than those you would find in Hong Kong, Singapore or Dubai. It has a supermarket and retail outlets selling clothes and other things you would expect to find in a mall. You can find money changers and pre-paid mobile telephone kiosks too.  Afra Mall is certainly not a must-see attraction, nor a place to head for a night out.    (updated Jan 2011)
15.58524732.5443422 Al-Amarat Centre. For visitors this is probably your best bet for tracking down imported foodstuffs and household items.  Prices are high of course, but you are paying for convenience.    (updated Jan 2011)

## Khartoum North (Bahri)
Saad Gishra. This is a covered market place; it is Bahri's main shopping market. Prices here can be a little higher than those in Souq Omdurman; however, it is much more easily navigable for tourists. (updated Jan 2011)

## Eat
Khartoum has a good sprinkling of restaurants, with new ones popping up every couple of months – other than restaurants attached to hotels there is little quality eating to be had in Khartoum’s city centre. Amarat hosts the majority of the better eateries, although Ridyah and Khartoum 2 also have some places.  Omdurman and Barhi have a light sprinkling of simple restaurants. All restaurants have about 15% government tax and 3-14% service charge.

## Amarat
15.57610332.5452281 Universal, Amarat St. 27. Italian flavoured, offering pleasant al fresco dining, priced with the expat wallet in mind.    (updated Jan 2011)
Mat'am 15 Cha'abi - Popular Restaurant 15, Al-Amarat, St 15 (on the square off Macro Supermarket /Syrian Fresh Food 2, facing Kanon Hotel). Serves north of Sudan traditional gurasa (a large thick wheat pancake) or kisra (large thin pancake) with your choice of sauce (bamya based with lamb or chicken) or yoghurt with sugar (gha'ib). Also has a juice bar. Very cheap (all dishes under SDG 5), it is a favourite of local workers and touk touk drivers. (updated Jan 2011)
Amwaj Restaurant, Africa St, Al-Amarat (on the corner with Street 15 or "Shari'a Khamsa ta-Ashaara"), ☏ +249 91 828 8890. Big, airy and spotless, and really good food. Extremely popular with locals and visitors. Menu offers shawarmas, kebabs, grilled chicken, lamb stews and others, all accompanied by bread, soup and salad. Delicious fruit juices and shakes too. Dishes cost SDG 20-60. (updated Jan 2011)
Royal Broast, Airport Road, Al-Amarat. Another popular place a few doors from Amwaj. (updated Jan 2011)
Laziz Delicious Restaurant, Al-Amarat Street 1. Nice place to eat in. They have another branch in Ryad area. (updated Jan 2011)
Afra Mall Chinese restaurant food court, Afra Mall, Africa Street, Arkawet. Located on the first floor of Khartoum's only shopping mall. (updated Jan 2011)

## Khartoum 2
15.59577132.5368362 Assaha Restaurant. Would be considered an excellent restaurant in any city, and a Jewel in Khartoum. Good atmosphere with professional and knowledgeable wait staff. They have lots on the menu including luncheons, light meals and full dinners. A large selection of appetizers, mains, dessert and a "hubble bubble" cost about SDG 90 per person with everything included. They charge 12% government tax and 14% service charge.    (updated Jan 2011)
Al Bawadi Tourist Restaurant, Ahmed Makki Abdu St (east of Souk Khartoum 2), ☏ +249 90 692 1951. A renowned table for spicy grilled chicken and broast. Mains cost SDG 15-20. (updated Jan 2011)
Hadramawt Restaurant, Khartoum 2 St 47 (west Souk Khartoum 2), ☏ +249 12 222 5252. Yemeni restaurant offering the traditional salta, fahsa, mandi, lahm hanith and fatah for dessert. Mains cost around SDG 15. (updated Jan 2011)

## East of the airport
15.56151932.5625753 Habesha Ethiopian restaurant, +249 912302410 (Arkaweet Area, east of Afra Mall). Good atmosphere, good food and very affordable. The restaurant is on two floors (there is a pleasant internet cafe on the 3rd floor), upstairs is more lively with Ethiopian pop on the plasma screen. About SDG 25 each for a big meal and coffee. A good choice if you are looking for somewhere with music playing and a bit of atmosphere.    (updated Jan 2011)
Salt 'n' Pepper, Buri area, north end of Obeid Khatim Street (Next to Buri family park), ☏ +249 91 011 0916. Only Pakistani restaurant in Sudan. Speciality in Pakistani spicy tasty dishes. (updated Jan 2011)

## Bahri
15.62370832.5571364 Asian Biryani Restaurant (Khartoum North). As the name suggests this place specialises in Biryanis - and very tasty they are too. More of a cafe than a restaurant this is a good choice for lunch rather than a slap-up dinner. Lamb Biryani and some salad for SDG 8. The restaurant, and the supermarket next door, sells excellent mango juice for SDG 1 a bottle (Maaza). Easy to get to, head over the Burri Bridge, take the first right, and it's on your left.    (updated Jan 2011)

## Downtown
Papa Costa. In the center of Khartoum, and reasonably priced. Service charges are minimal, food is reasonably good, but service level is so-so. You can choose food from steak to pasta. They charge 3% service charge and 10% government tax. (updated Jan 2011)

## Drink
It's best to prepare yourself to be alcohol-free for your stay: there are places serving 'special tea' dotted around and non-alcoholic beers are available, but in general it's more hassle than it's worth to track down alcohol during a short visit.  For long-termers, however, the market does exist - via diplomatic bags and other routes... apparently.

## Sleep
A 5% tourism tax and 15% VAT may well be added to your bill - Khartoum's hotels are inconsistent in telling you about these taxes in advance, and (especially for cheaper hotels) inconsistent in paying this money to the tax authorities. Ask if there are any hidden extras before booking.

## Budget
Blue Nile Sailing Club. An alternative to Khartoum's hotels, on the river's southern bank just east of the confluence, the club often accommodates overlanders and accommodates tent camping on its grounds. The club is fenced, monitored, inexpensive and offers expansive river views. It is also home to a river gunboat that once belonged to Horatio Kitchener and now houses the club's offices. (updated Jan 2019)
Khartoum Youth Hostel, House no 66, Street 47, Khartoum 2,, ☏ +249 183480385 , +249 912500322 (mobile). Opened in 2007 and part of Hostelling International this is the best option for non-camping travellers on a budget. Dorm bed $5.00, double room $10.00.. (updated Jul 2019)

## Mid-range
Downtown Hotel and Business Center, el jami Ave, 11111, ☏ +249 183742131, reception@dtbusinesshotel.com. Good option for those who like old British city center which turned into multicultural hub of people from all around Africa doing business there. Downtown Hotel is situated in a big 5 store building right next Gold Market, Grand Mosque and major shopping center Waha. It's managed by British, Polish and Sudanese friends. It's still needs some adjustments and work on details, elevator doesn't work and hotel parking is occupied by street vendors but for US$35 it's possible to have very decent, well furnished room with bathroom and big bed for couples. They have coffee&restaurant on the groundfloor with green backyard. There are multiple activities like training and business center, Artists in Residence programs, design studio and other creative units. Double Room US$35, Twin Room US$45. (updated Jan 2011)
15.57042232.546351 Lisamin Safari Hotel, 41st Amaret. Opened in late 2007, this hotel is a welcome addition to Khartoum’s rather drab hotel stock. Lebanese run, and housing an excellent Lebanese restaurant (The Cedar Tree) this hotel is very Dubai-esque and is certainly worth checking out if your budget can stretch to the room rates. Wireless internet available for a fee. US$144 single, US$156 double, suites from US$168 (inc VAT and tourism tax).    (updated Jul 2016)
15.57185332.5673862 Bougainvilla Guesthouse, ☏ +249 92 261 5445. Small 17-room hotel in the Riyadh suburb – the big attraction is the breezy roof terrace where excellent European breakfasts and dinners are served. Although the rooms themselves are nothing special, they are clean and have the essentials of a/c, wireless internet and satellite TV, although standard rooms involve sharing a bathroom. A favourite with visiting aid workers and other westerners. Double en suite US$91, single en suite US$65, Single outside bathroom US$4, incl. breakfast.    (updated Nov 2017)

## Splurge
15.55726432.5549013 Al Salam Rotana, Africa Street (Near Afra Mall), ☏ +249 1 87007777, fax: +249 1 8700 7788, alsalam.hotel@rotana.com. Opened in mid 2007, this is the only hotel in Khartoum that offers international five-star standard. Nice big rooms, perfectly equipped. Pool, gym, restaurant and lobby bar, conference facilities and Wifi (fee). Rooms are around US$300 incl. taxes.    (updated Nov 2017)
15.59581232.5366434 Assaha Lebanese Village, ☏ +249 183481919. A bit of a strange one this – based in an attractive, if slightly kitsch, dry stone palace, the Assaha Village combines a large restaurant, conference facilities and even a ‘museum’ with intimate, Middle Eastern themed bedrooms. Its part of a small chain with sister hotels in Beirut and Doha. Prices, however, are sky-high at SDG 360 for a single room and SDG 480 for a double.
15.60724932.5162815 Grand Holiday Villa, Nile Street (West of the city center towards the confluence of the Blue and White Nile, along the banks of the Blue Nile), ☏ +249 1 83774039, fax: +249-183-773961, grandholidayvilla@hotmail.com. The hotel has undergone extensive renovation and many facilities have been updated to international standards. The swimming pool is among the largest in Sudan. Features: unlimited free WiFi, Nile Terrace Restaurant (water sprayers on year round), free breakfast. The restaurant serves continental cuisine and comes highly recommended. Rooms start at US$100 and include a continental breakfast.

## Registration and other legal requirements
All foreigners are required to register within three days of arrival.
To register, go to the  Aliens Registration Bureau at Shari'a Al Sahafa Zat, Khartoum, close to Sudan University for Science and Technology, with passport sized photos required and SDG 540 (as of November 2018), US$ not accepted. Registration can also be done at the airport departure terminal. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes.
The travel permit and the photo permit are no longer required as of 2018.

## Go next
Sabaloga Gorge: This gorge is also known as the 6th Cataract.  It is 80-95 km (50 to 60 miles) north of Khartoum and can be reached in about 2½ hours.  It is essential that a 4-wheel drive vehicle be used, and it is wise, as is true in all cases in traveling outside Khartoum, to travel with at least two vehicles.  On arrival, visitors can stroll around a Sudanese village and inspect Ansar forts that once bombarded steamers on their way to relieve General Gordon.  It is advisable to take this trip in the cooler months.
Jebel Awlia: This dam was completed in 1937 and is 40-50 km (25 to 30 miles) south of Khartoum on the Jebel Awlia road.  A 4-wheel drive vehicle is not required for this trip as the road is paved to the dam.  However, if you intend to cross the dam and travel on the other side, a 4 WD will be needed. The area around the dam itself has a number of large trees and flat grassy land which are ideal for picnics.   For those interested in bird watching, there are numerous birds to be seen, such as pelican, herons, kingfisher, wader, and plovers.  One of the fringe benefits of a trip to Jebel Awlia is a short drive up to the dam.  Here the fishermen sell their catch, which they have just brought in.  The prices are about half of what they might be in Khartoum.  Bring along suitable wrapping and ice and coolers for any fish purchased.
Meroe: This site is approximately 200 km north of Khartoum.  There is also a hotel in Shendi (very basic) where one could be based.  The trip should be arranged with a tour agency unless someone in the party really knows his/her way around the desert tracks.  There are some paved roads to Meroe but you do have to drive off the main road on to some sandy areas. Four-wheel driver vehicles are a necessity for this trip.  The Pharaonic influence left its imprint in the hieroglyphic language, the religion of Amon, and  building of the pyramids, which were a simplified version of the Egyptian model with no rooms or corridors.  The Greek and Roman architectural influence is evident in the pillars of temples and the classical forms of the statues of men and women.  The Meroe ruins are a four-hour drive from Khartoum.  But there are various other sites in the area, so a two or three day trip should be contemplated, and a knowledgeable guide is essential for the best understanding of the ruins.  National Geographic’s book Splendors of the Past provides excellent background for such a trip.
Dinder National Park: (12°19'N 034°47'E) The Dinder National Park is said to be one of the most unique in the world.  It is totally “unorganized,” and the visitor can truly see game in its natural state.  The site is about 480 km (300 miles) south of Khartoum on the Blue Nile near the Roseires Dam.  Travel by 4-wheel transportation from there to the park is recommended.  Inside the park there is a small tourist area consisting of round, grass thatched huts.  Inside these huts are beds, a chair and a table.  The huts are burned and rebuilt every year after the flood season.  This park is only accessible for a few months of the year from December through May.  It is essential that the visitor traveling to Dinder make thorough preparations for the trip.
The Red Sea Area - [Port Sudan]:  The Red Sea is noted for its magnificent under water diving, the clearness of its water and the variety of marine species.  Visitors generally reach the area by flying Sudan Air.  Daily, one hour and a half flights are available, but you may drive on paved road to Port Sudan in about 12–14 hours.  Travelers should be completely self-sufficient with all fuel as well as food and water.  It is about 815 km (510 miles) to Port Sudan.  Visitors may want to stay at the Red Sea Hotel.  This hotel is booked for most of the year, and it is necessary to have reservations confirmed in advance.  The Hilton Hotel has opened in Port Sudan. It is located about half an hour drive from the airport, along the harbor.  Outdoor swimming pool, three restaurants, and a gymnasium, are some of the facilities available.  For more enquiries, call 31139810 or fax 31131183.
Erkowit: This area is 39 km southwest of Port Sudan, and it is the only developed summer resort in Sudan.  The altitude is 1,200 ft (370 m) above sea level.
Jebel Barkal Unesco World Heritage site - [Northern state]:Jebel Barkal or Gebel Barkal (Arabic: جبل بركل) is a very small mountain located some 400 km north of Khartoum, in Karima town in Northern State in Sudan, on a large bend of the Nile River, in the region called Nubia. Around 1450 BC, the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III extended his empire to that region and considered Gebel Barkal its southern limit. There, he campaigned near the city of Napata that, about 300 years later, became the capital of the independent kingdom of Kush. The 25th Dynasty Nubian king Piye later greatly enlarged the New Kingdom Temple of Amun in this city and erected his Year 20 Victory stela within it.
The ruins around Gebel Barkal include at least 13 temples and 3 palaces, that were for the first described by European explorers in the 1820s, although only in 1916 were archeological excavations started by George Reisner under a joint expedition of Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston. From the 1970s, explorations continued by a team from the University of Rome La Sapienza, under the direction of Sergio Donadoni, that was joined by another team from the Boston Museum, in the 1980s, under the direction of Timothy Kendall. The larger temples, such that of Amun, are even today considered sacred to the local population.
For these reasons, the mountain, together with the historical city of Napata and other ancient sites, were considered by UNESCO, in 2003, World Heritage Sites.
Buses leave daily from Khartoum to Kerma, however the most comfortable and convenient way of getting there is by car. The route is tarmacked, but you will still require the best part of a day to get there.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kassala (Arabic: كسلا, Tigrinya: ከሰላ) is the capital of the state of Kassala in eastern Sudan.  In 2003 its population was recorded to be 530,950. Built on the banks of the Gash River, it is a market city and is famous for its fruit gardens. Many of its inhabitants are from the Hadendawa sub-tribe of the Beja ethnic group.
The city was formerly a railroad hub, however, as of 2006 there was no operational railway station in Kassala and much of the track leading to and from the city has been salvaged or fallen into disrepair. Kassala's location along the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway makes it an important trade center.

History
In 1834, the Egyptian Army established Kassala as a garrison town following its conquest of Sudan in 1821. When the Mahdist state was established, the Egyptian garrison in Kassala found itself besieged by Mahdist forces. Under the terms of the 1884 Hewett Treaty, Abyssinian forces led by Ras Alula attempted to rescue the Egyptians. Although Ras Alula successfully defeated the Mahdists at the Battle of Kufit, he was unable to breach Kassala’s defenses and liberate the Egyptians. In 1886, after prolonged resistance, the Egyptian garrison finally surrendered to the Mahdists under Osman Digna.
On July 17, 1894, Italy annexed Kassala to Italian Eritrea. The Italians fortified the town and brought stability to the region by pacifying the Beja, the dominant local population. However, Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 changed Kassala's fate. Italy was forced to evacuate the town after failing to hold it until the arrival of advancing Anglo-Egyptian forces, who re-occupied Kassala and incorporated it into Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
In the early 1900s, a railway was constructed, first linking Kassala to the Red Sea port of Port Sudan—built in 1906 to replace Suakin—and later, in 1929, extending to Sennar on the southern frontiers of the Gezira Cotton Scheme. When the Anglo-Egyptian forces re-established control over Sudan, Kassala developed into a thriving trade center serving the Ethiopian hinterlands. Horticulture was introduced in the fertile lands near the Gash and Barka rivers, and the British later introduced cotton cultivation. The Kassala Cotton Company, a subsidiary of the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, played a role in these developments.
In July 1940, during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced the local British garrison to withdraw from Kassala. The Italians then occupied the city with brigade-sized units: on July 4, 1940 the Italians started their offensive with 2,500 men (and one brigade of cavalry) supported by 24 tanks, while to defend Kassala for Britain there were 1,300 colonial soldiers with their British officers who -after some initial heavy fighting- were easily defeated. The Italians later appointed as mayor of Kassala the future hero of Eritrean independence, Hamid Idris Awate. In mid-January 1941, the Italians withdrew from the city and a British garrison returned.
In 2003, Kassala's population was estimated at 530,950 inhabitants. The town is ethnically diverse, comprising groups such as the Beja, Beni-Amer, Amarar, Bishari, Rashaida, and Halanga, as well as significant immigrant communities from northern and western Sudan, including the Fula and Nuba peoples.  The Ethiopian-Eritrean War (1998–2000) displaced an estimated 110,000 Eritreans refugees to the Kassala area, particularly from the border towns of Barentu and Teseney, which were overrun by the Ethiopian Army.
In 2025, during the Sudanese civil war (2023-present), Kassala had been involved in conflict for the first time since the war began 2 years ago. The RSF attacked Kassala with drones on 3 May 2025. The attack targeted the fuel storage area at the Kassala Airport. This attack marks the second furthest drone attack by the RSF from controlled areas by the RSF. RSF later attacked Port Sudan.

Climate
Kassala has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) characterized by high temperatures, low precipitation, and abundant sunshine. April through June marks the hottest period of the year, followed by the wet season from July through September, marked by higher humidity levels and intermittent rainfall. The rest of the year is very dry, with nearly no precipitation from November to March.

Current status
The Kassala region had a child mortality rate of 62 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, slightly higher than the national average of 52 child deaths per 1,000.
The Khatmiyya Mosque, built in 1840 by the Egyptians and damaged during the Mahdist War, is the city's most important cultural site.  It is an important site for the Sufi Khatmiyya order.

Education
The city is home to Kassala University, a public university established in 1990 to replace the East University, and an important institution for development in the east of Sudan.
Including Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Faculty of Education,Faculty of Economic and Administration, Faculty of Computer science and IT and more.

Kassala (en italien Cassala) est la capitale de l'État de Kassala à l'est du Soudan. Sa population en 1993 s'élevait à 234 622 habitants.

Histoire
La ville était  à l'origine un camp militaire pour les soldats Ottomans du vice-roi égyptien Méhémet Ali en 1840 lors de son offensive militaire au Soudan. En 1885, la ville est conquise par les Mahdistes. En 1894, après la bataille de Kassala, le royaume d'Italie s'empare de la ville. Cependant, il la restitue en 1897 au royaume d'Égypte. En 1899, elle tombe sous la tutelle du Soudan anglo-égyptien.
En juillet 1940, durant la campagne d'Afrique de l'Est, les Forces italiennes avancent de l'Afrique orientale italienne pour contraindre les Britanniques à partir. Les Italiens occupent donc la ville avec une unité de brigade. À la mi-janvier 1941, ils se retirent permettant alors le retour des Britanniques.

En 1956, le Soudan anglo-égyptien proclame son indépendance sous le nom de la République du Soudan. Depuis les années 1960, la ville est devenue la destination d'un nombre important d'Éthiopiens et d'Érythréens réfugiés du conflit qui oppose ces deux pays.

## Overview
Kassala is a city in Kassala State (Wilayat Kassala) in Sudan. It is a market town that is famous for its fruit gardens. Kassala is an important trading centre because it lies on the main highway between Khartoum and Port Sudan.

## Understand
Many of its inhabitants are from the Hadendawa people.

## Get in
Buses leave Kassala for Khartoum (7 hours), Gedaref (3 hours) and Port Sudan (7 hours). The better bus companies tend to get booked up early, so if you want a comfortable journey book tickets a few days in advance. Otherwise, turn up at the bus station and take one of the more ramshackle options.
Smaller buses and minibuses head to destinations around Kassala, like Halfa al-Jadida, Khashm al-Ghirba and Aroma.
You need a permit to enter Kassala, and these are checked thoroughly at the entrance to the city, just before arriving at the bus station. You can get a permit from the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs in Khartoum (close to Khartoum University), which can take a couple of hours or several days depending on their mood. If you leave the city on a day trip, you may well have trouble getting back in. As of March 2010, the permit to Kassala can easily be obtained at the Permits Office across from Dandas Hotel (southeast corner of the intersection) with one photo, three copies of your passport and Sudanese Visa, and a form you fill out on location. The whole process is free and takes about 5 minutes.
To Eritrea, the border is apparently open, and the place to head for is Souq Tesenei, a small bus station in the 'Aamiriya district.

## Get around
Souq ash-Sha'abi is Kassala's bus station, just off the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway and quite a distance from the centre of town. Local buses and taxis meet most bus arrivals.
Al-Mowgif al-'Aam is the central bus station, a large square in the middle of the souqs. Buses a tourist might need to use include Khatmiya (for the old quarter of Khatmiya, Tomb of Seyid Hassan and the cafes on Totil Mountain), Souq ash-Sha'abi (for the inter-city bus station), Banat (for the Gash river and colonial railway quarter), and the lorries to Sawagi Janubiya and Sawagi Shamaliya, the two areas of farmland to the south and north.

## See
The souqs are lively and colourful, with many people dressed in clothes unique to their tribe.
Souq an-Niswaan is the "women's souq" where baskets and mats are made, as well as coffee making equipment and incense.
Souq ar-Rashaida is where the Rashaida tribe gather, selling their bright red and black robes for women and coloured jellabiyas for men.
Khatmiya is the old part of Kassala, underneath the mountains of Taka, Totil and Aweitila (huge, you can't miss them). The main sight is the tomb of Seyyid Hassan, a local holy man who is buried in a roofless dome next to a semi-ruined mosque. Locals tell you that he is so holy that when it rains, not a drop falls through the hole in the roof. Next to the tomb is a Qur'anic school for boys.
15.431636.42181 Tomb of Seyyid Hassan.    (updated Jan 2021)
Behind the tomb, you can climb the slopes of Jebel Totil. On the lower slopes, there are several cafes built into the rock, serving the best coffee in Kassala. There is also the famous well of Totil. If you drink from it, legend has it that you will return to Kassala one day.
The Gash River runs through Kassala, but for most of the year it is a dry sandy riverbed, used for football practice in the evenings. In the rainy season, water cascades down from the Eritrean mountains and charges through the city, making the riverbanks a popular place to walk in the evenings. However, the Gash is a dangerous river, having flooded in 2007 and 2003, causing huge amounts of damage to the whole city.
On the other side of the Gash, you reach an area called Sikka Hadiid, which is the old railway quarter. The original railway station still stands, all impressive and colonial but abandoned now. Around this are British built round brick huts, which used to house railway workers and is now a popular place for students to live.
To the south, the Sawagi Janubiyya (southern gardens) is a collection of villages surrounded by mango and guava orchards alongside the Gash.

## Do
15.411736.42631 Taka Mountains Nature Preserve. Dramatic mountains just south of Kassala- Climbing is popular but to reach the summit, you need special equipment. However, climbing half way is possible in about one hour and offers amazing views.    (updated Jan 2021)
Drink coffee at one of Kassala's hundreds of tea stalls or at a cafe on Totil mountain.
Take a walk through Sawagi Janubiyya. Cross the Gash bridge and take the road to your left which leads you through the Sawagi villages. After five kilometres or so, you can get alongside the Gash, and if it is dry, you can cross over to the mountains and Khatmiya.
Jabal Kasala is a mountain that rises 748 m2 (8,050 ft²) above the surrounding area with small summit area, steep slopes and local relief of 300 m.

## Buy
Kassala is famous for its coffee, which is traditionally served in a clay coffee pot called a jebbana. These are sold quite cheaply in Souq an-Niswan, along with wooden mortar and pestles for grinding the beans and ginger, roasting trays, jebbana stands and tiny coffee cups.

## Eat
Fuul (mashed fava beans) is the main dish found in Kassala, and there are lots of fuul stalls around. The best ones are between the Souq an-Niswaan and Hotel Hipton, where the fuul is mixed with ta'amiya, cheese, tuna or egg, and topped with sesame oil, garlic and a herb called shumaar.
At-Tabaq as-Souri on the main square is a good place for sandwiches and shawarma. They also serve baklava and other sweets, and is one of the only cafes in Kassala where local women eat.
For more local dishes, like tagaliya and bamiya (both gloopy okra-based sauces) served with ghuraasa (a spongy pancake type bread) or kisra (very thin, slightly sour bread), and various bits of meat (ask for shiyya if you aren't keen on offal), try some of the restaurants in the middle of the souq.
On the road to Khatmiya, the bus passes a livestock market opposite a large cemetery. Here, there are stalls selling sheep, which are slaughtered to order and cooked in the restaurant next door.

## Drink
Kassala is famous for its coffee (jebbana), spiced with ginger (zinjabil) and cinnamon (girfa') and served in a clay coffee pot, with incense and popcorn on the side. The best place for the full treatment is at one of the cafes on the slopes of Totil mountain. Otherwise, Kassala is full of tea stalls, where coffee is served in smaller coffee pots made from recycled Pif-Paf cans.
jebbana - coffee.
bi dawa thagiil - with lots of ginger and cinnamon.
bi dawa khafiif - with a little ginger.
saliiga - without ginger.
shay - tea.
shay kerkedeh - pink hibiscus tea.
shay bi laban - tea with hot milk.
fawgu jumaada - with lumpy bits of milk (some people do ask for it!).
shay faransi - literally "French tea", this is actually coffee with milk.
Fruit juices are excellent in Kassala, and made fresh at many stalls in the souq, so you can ask for one without sugar. Mango and guava are the best, but orange tends to be diluted with a lot of water and mixed with bucketloads of sugar, so avoid it. Local juices include aradeeb (a brown tangy juice, similar to tamarind) and sha'iir (made from a white powder and a bit like cold malted milk).

## Sleep
Two of the best hotels in Kassala are the Telal ash-Sharg and the Hipton. Others include the Safa, Bashir, Totil and Medina. They are all located in the streets behind the Mowgif al-'Aam bus station. Some foreigners don't get a choice where they stay, as the security police will escort them to a particular place, usually one of the ones mentioned above. Cheaper places like the Hotel Africa and the many basic lakondas (courtyards filled with beds) sometimes won't accept foreigners.

Port Sudan (Arabic: بور سودان, romanized: Būr Sūdān, Beja: Bar'uut) is a major port city on the Red Sea in eastern Sudan, and the capital of Red Sea State. Port Sudan is Sudan's main seaport and the source of 90% of the country's international trade. The population of Port Sudan was estimated in the 2008 Census of Sudan to be 394,561 people.
Port Sudan has historically been a centre for commercial activity, particularly in the shipping industry. 
Due to the civil war in the country that started in 2023, the Sudanese government has largely been operating from Port Sudan as a result of intense fighting in the capital city Khartoum from April 2023 to May 2025, leading to it being described as a de facto capital of the country. Port Sudan also has emerged as a refuge for internally displaced persons in Sudan.

History
Founding and early history
Port Sudan was built between 1905 and 1909 by the administration of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to replace Suakin—the historic, coral-choked Arab port. An oil pipeline was built between the port and Khartoum in 1977.

Early 21st century
In 2009, Israel allegedly used naval commandos to attack Iranian arms ships at Port Sudan as part of Operation Birds of Prey. In 2020, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian Navy would begin construction on a base with capacity for 300 personnel and four warships in Port Sudan. The facility would provide Russia with a naval base in the nation for at least 25 years. The plan was ultimately suspended, though Sudanese leadership has indicated that it is possible for the construction to go ahead in the future.
In 2016, it was reported that residents of Port Sudan face water scarcity. Following the October–November 2021 Sudanese coup d'état, the Beja tribal council initiated a weeklong blockade of the city's ports. Following negotiations with military officials, the blockade was lifted.

Sudanese civil war (2023–present)
During the Sudanese civil war (2023–present), Port Sudan has emerged as a leading destination and refuge for internally displaced persons fleeing war in other parts of the country. Internally-displaced refugees in the city reportedly face extreme heat and shortages of food and water.
By late October 2023, Reuters reported that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controlled most of Khartoum, causing the government led by Abdul Fattah el-Burhan to have largely relocated to Port Sudan. General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, "has threatened to establish a cabinet" in Port Sudan, "with the intention of creating an alternative or second capital." Hemedti, leader of the RSF, in turn, warned that this would lead to him declaring his own rival government based in Khartoum or another city he controlled. Analysts have raised concerns of a lasting split similar to that of Libya during its civil wars. Port Sudan has been described as becoming a "de facto" capital of Sudan.
Iran and Russia have been trying to negotiate with Sudan to build a naval base in the city.
On 4 May 2025, the RSF launched a drone attack on Port Sudan for the first time since the beginning of the war, targeting the Osman Digna Air Base, "a goods warehouse and some civilian facilities" and causing "limited damage". A day later, another RSF drone attack occurred targeting fuel depots, leading to a fire. Some Arab nations condemned the actions.

Economy
The city has an oil refinery and handles 90% of the country's international trade. Major exports include oilseed, senna, and hides and skins. Imports include construction materials, heavy machinery, and vehicles.

Transport
The city has a modern container port to handle imports and exports. The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.
The main airport is Port Sudan New International Airport. There is now a tarred road linking Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. Port Sudan also has a 1067mm gauge rail link with Khartoum. There is also an international ferry from Jeddah.
In 2023 a new seaport was proposed about 200km north of Port Sudan at Abu Amama. A 450km road to the farming hub at Abu Hamad would also be provided. This new seaport is opposite Jeddah which shortens the ferry trip from Jeddah.

Education
The city is home to the Red Sea University, established in 1994.

Places of worship
Places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques, but there are also Christian churches and temples including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches) and Coptic Orthodox Churches.

Climate
Port Sudan has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with extremely hot summers and moderately hot winters, requiring the acquisition of fresh water from Wadi Arba'at in the Red Sea Hills and from salt-evaporating pans. Temperatures can easily exceed 30 °C (86 °F) in winter and 45 °C (113 °F) in summer. Over 90% of the annual rainfall falls between October and January, mostly in November, with the wettest month on record being November 1947 with 182 millimetres (7.2 in), whilst the wettest year was from July 1923 to June 1924 with 231 millimetres (9.1 in). Average annual rainfall is 76 millimetres (3.0 in), and no rainfall occurred between January 1983 and June 1984. The  mean temperature year round (the average of all daily highs and nighttime lows) is 28.4 °C (83.1 °F).

Demographics
The population consists mainly of Sudanese Arabs, including the native Beja people, with small Asian and European minorities.

Sport
Hay Al-Arab SC founded in 1928, and 	Hilal Alsahil SC founded in 1937, both play at the Port Sudan Stadium in the football	Sudan Premier League. The city's third team is Al-Merreikh Al-Thagher.

Notable people
Gawaher (Pop singer)
Ra'ouf Mus'ad (Playwright)
