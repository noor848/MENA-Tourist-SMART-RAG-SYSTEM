      "content": "Aleppo is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's largest city by urban area, and was the primary economic centre until it was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria. Aleppo is also the largest city in Syria's northern governorates and one of the largest cities in the Levant region.\nAleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.\nAt the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.\n\nEtymology\nProto-Semitic Origins\nThe etymology of the name Aleppo (Arabic: Ḥalab, حلب) is ancient and rooted in the long history of the region.\nThe name Ḥalab is believed to originate from a Semitic root, possibly the Proto-Semitic root ḥlb, meaning “to milk” or “milk.” This connection might have arisen due to the area's association with pastoralism and the production of milk. Another possibility is that the name refers to the color “white,” as the root ḥlb could metaphorically describe the pale or white hue of certain local soils or materials. Similarly, the modern-day nickname al-Shahbāʾ (Arabic: الشهباء), meaning \"the white-colored mixed with black\", is said to be derived from its famed white marble.\n\nAmorite Origins and Hittite Influence\nDuring the second millennium BCE, it became a key city of the Amorite state, who referred to it as Ḥalab. The Hittites, a contemporary Anatolian Empire within the region, referred to the city as Ḥalpa or Ḥalpu in their inscriptions. This indicates the name was already well-established by this time.\n\nAramaic and Akkadian Adaptations\nIn Aramaic, the city retained a similar name, with forms like Ḥalba. Akkadian sources also refer to the city as Ḥalab.\n\nGreek and Roman Periods\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Aleppo was known as Beroea (Βέροια in Greek), a name likely assigned by the Seleucid rulers after the Macedonian city of the same name. Despite this, the local population continued to use the original Semitic name.\n\nIslamic Period\nWith the advent of Islam and the Arabization of the region, the name Ḥalab (Arabic: حلب) remained in use, reflecting its deep historical continuity. The Arabic form also preserved its earlier meanings, with folklore often associating the name with the prophet Abraham, who is said to have “milked” his livestock in the area to provide for travelers.\n\nModern-day English\nThe adoption of “Aleppo” into English likely coincided with the Crusades (11th–13th centuries) and subsequent increased trade and travel between Europe and the Middle East. By the late 14th to early 15th centuries, the term Aleppo was well-established in English literature and travel accounts.\nThe earliest documented use of “Aleppo” in English occurs in translations of medieval texts and chronicles, such as the travel writings of Marco Polo, where the city is mentioned as a key trading hub. Additionally, it was featured in maps and documents produced during the European Renaissance as a center of commerce on the Silk Road.\n\nHistory\nPre-history and pre-classical era\nAleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. The earliest occupation of the site was around 8,000 BC, as shown by excavations in Tallet Alsauda.\nAleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus. The first record of Aleppo comes from the third millennium BC, in the Ebla tablets when Aleppo was referred to as Ha-lam (𒄩𒇴). This has been identified as an early form of Ḥalab due to an interchange of /m/ and /b/ that has been attested in Sumerian texts, including with the cuneiform sign Lam. Some historians, such as Wayne Horowitz, identify Aleppo with the capital of an independent kingdom closely related to Ebla, known as Armi, although this identification is contested. The main temple of the storm god Hadad was located on the citadel hill in the center of the city, when the city was known as the city of Hadad.\n\nNaram-Sin of Akkad mentioned his destruction of Ebla and Armanum, in the 23rd century BC. However, the identification of Armani in the inscription of Naram-Sim as Armi in the Eblaite tablets is heavily debated, as there was no Akkadian annexation of Ebla or northern Syria.\nIn the Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian Empire period, Aleppo's name appears in its original form as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time. Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad. The kingdom of Yamḥad (c. 1800–1525 BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab,' was one of the most powerful in the Near East during the reign of Yarim-Lim I, who formed an alliance with Hammurabi of Babylonia against Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria.\n\nHittite period\nYamḥad was devastated by the Hittites under Mursili I in the 16th century BC. However, it soon resumed its leading role in the Levant when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.\nTaking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Baratarna, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni instigated a rebellion that ended the life of Yamhad's last king Ilim-Ilimma I in c. 1525 BC, Subsequently, Parshatatar conquered Aleppo and the city found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni, the Hittites and Egypt. Niqmepa of Alalakh who descends from the old Yamhadite kings controlled the city as a vassal to Mitanni and was attacked by Tudhaliya I of the Hittites as a retaliation for his alliance to Mitanni. Later the Hittite king Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni, and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Suppiluliumas installed his son Telepinus as king and a dynasty of Suppiluliumas descendants ruled Aleppo until the Late Bronze Age collapse. However, Talmi-Šarruma, grandson of Suppiluliumas I, who was the king of Aleppo, had fought on the Hittite side, along with king Muwatalli II during the Battle of Kadesh against the Egyptian army led by Ramesses II.\n\nAleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites as the center of worship of the Storm-God. This religious importance continued after the collapse of the Hittite empire at the hands of the Assyrians and Phrygians in the 12th century BC, when Aleppo became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, whose king renovated the temple of Hadad which was discovered in 2003.\nIn 2003, a statue of a king named Taita bearing inscriptions in Luwian was discovered during excavations conducted by German archeologist Kay Kohlmeyer in the Citadel of Aleppo. The new readings of Anatolian hieroglyphic signs proposed by the Hittitologists Elisabeth Rieken and Ilya Yakubovich were conducive to the conclusion that the country ruled by Taita was called Palistin. This country extended in the 11th-10th centuries BC from the Amouq Valley in the west to Aleppo in the east down to Maharda and Shaizar in the south. Due to the similarity between Palistin and Philistines, Hittitologist John David Hawkins (who translated the Aleppo inscriptions) hypothesizes a connection between the Syro-Hittite states Palistin and the Philistines, as do archaeologists Benjamin Sass and Kay Kohlmeyer. Gershon Galil suggests that King David halted the Arameans' expansion into the Land of Israel on account of his alliance with the southern Philistine kings, as well as with Toi, king of Ḥamath, who is identified with Tai(ta) II, king of Palistin (the northern Sea Peoples).\n\nState of Bit Agusi\nDuring the early years of the 1st millennium BC, Aleppo was incorporated into the Aramean realm of Bit Agusi, which held its capital at Arpad. Bit Agusi along with Aleppo and the entirety of the Levant was conquered by the Assyrians in the 8th century BC and became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians. The region remained known as Aramea and Eber Nari throughout these periods.\n\nClassical antiquity (Beroea)\nAlexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC. Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301 and 286 BC. He called it Beroea (Βέροια), after Beroea in Macedon; it is sometimes spelled as Beroia. Beroea is mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:4.\nNorthern Syria was the center of gravity of the Hellenistic world and Greek culture in the Seleucid Empire. As did other Greek cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or boulē composed of free Hellenes.\nBeroea remained under Seleucid rule until 88 BC when Syria was conquered by the Armenian king Tigranes the Great and Beroea became part of the Kingdom of Armenia. After the Roman victory over Tigranes, Syria was handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province. Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class or Aramaic speaking populace.\nThe Roman era saw an increase in the population of northern Syria that accelerated under the Byzantines well into the 5th century. In Late Antiquity, Beroea was the second largest Syrian city after Antioch, the capital of Roman Syria and the third largest city in the Roman world. Archaeological evidence indicates a high population density for settlements between Antioch and Beroea right up to the 6th century. This agrarian landscape still holds the remains of large estate houses and churches such as the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nThe names of several bishops of the episcopal see of Beroea, which was in the Roman province of Syria Prima, are recorded in extant documents. The first whose name survives is that of Saint Eustathius of Antioch, who, after being bishop of Beroea, was transferred to the important metropolitan see of Antioch shortly before the 325 First Council of Nicaea. His successor in Beroea Cyrus was for his fidelity to the Nicene faith sent into exile by the Roman Emperor Constantius II. After the Council of Seleucia of 359, called by Constantius, Meletius of Antioch was transferred from Sebastea to Beroea but in the following year was promoted to Antioch. His successor in Beroea, Anatolius, was at a council in Antioch in 363. Under the persecuting Emperor Valens, the bishop of Beroea was Theodotus, a friend of Basil the Great. He was succeeded by Acacius of Beroea, who governed the see for over 50 years and was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the Council of Ephesus in 431. In 438, he was succeeded by Theoctistus, who participated in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Prima sent in 458 to Emperor Leo I the Thracian about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. In 518, Emperor Justin I exiled the bishop of Beroea Antoninus for rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. The last known bishop of the see is Megas, who was at a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536. After the Arab conquest, Beroea ceased to be a residential bishopric, and is today listed by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see.\nVery few physical remains have been found from the Roman and Byzantine periods in the Citadel of Aleppo. The two mosques inside the Citadel are known to have been converted by the Mirdasids during the 11th century from churches originally built by the Byzantines.\n\nMedieval period\nEarly Islamic period\nThe Sasanian Persians led by King Khosrow I pillaged and burned Aleppo in 540, then they invaded and controlled Syria briefly in the early 7th century. Soon after Aleppo was taken by the Rashidun Muslims under Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in 637. It later became part of Jund Qinnasrin under the Umayyad Caliphate. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity, being home to the great poet al-Mutanabbi and the philosopher and polymath al-Farabi. In 962, the city was sacked by the Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas. Subsequently, the city and its emirate became a temporary vassal of the Byzantine Empire. For the next few decades, the city was disputed by the Fatimid Caliphate and Byzantine Empire, with the nominally independent Hamdanids in between, eventually falling to the Fatimids in 1017. In 1024, Salih ibn Mirdas launched an attack on Fatimid Aleppo, and after a few months was invited into the city by its population. The Mirdasid dynasty then ruled the city until 1080, interrupted only in 1038–1042, when it was in the hands of the Fatimid commander-in-chief in Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, and in 1057–1060, when it was ruled by a Fatimid governor, Ibn Mulhim. Mirdasid rule was marked by internal squabbles between different Mirdasid chieftains that sapped the emirate's power and made it susceptible to external intervention by the Byzantines, Fatimids, Uqaylids, and Turkoman warrior bands.\n\nSeljuq and Ayyubid periods\nIn late 1077, Seljuk emir Tutush I launched a campaign to capture Aleppo during the reign of Sabiq ibn Mahmud of the Mirdasid dynasty, which lasted until 1080, when his reinforcements were ambushed and routed by a coalition of Arab tribesmen led by Kilabi chief Abu Za'ida at Wadi Butnan. After the death of Sharaf al-Dawla of the Uqaylid dynasty in June 1085, the headman in Aleppo Sharif Hassan ibn Hibat Allah Al-Hutayti promised to surrender the city to Sultan Malik-Shah I. When the latter delayed his arrival, Hassan contacted the Sultan's brother Tutush. However, after Tutush defeated Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, who had intended to take Aleppo for himself, in the battle of Ain Salm, Hassan went back on his commitment. In response, Tutush attacked the city and managed to get hold of parts of the walls and towers in July 1086, but he left in September, either due to the advance of Malik-Shah or because the Fatimids were besieging Damascus. In 1087, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib became the Seljuk governor of Aleppo under Sultan Malik Shah I. During his bid for the Seljuk throne, Tutush had Aq Sunqur executed and after Tutush died in battle, the town was ruled by his son Ridwan.\nThe city was besieged by Crusaders led by the King of Jerusalem Baldwin II in 1124–1125, but was not conquered after receiving protection by forces of Aqsunqur al Bursuqi arriving from Mosul in January 1125.\nIn 1128, Aleppo became capital of the expanding Zengid dynasty, which ultimately conquered Damascus in 1154. In 1138, Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos led a campaign, which main objective was to capture the city of Aleppo. On 20 April 1138, the Christian army including Crusaders from Antioch and Edessa launched an attack on the city but found it too strongly defended, hence John II moved the army southward to take nearby fortresses. On 11 October 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the seventh deadliest earthquake in recorded history.\nIn 1183, Aleppo came under the control of Saladin and then the Ayyubid dynasty. When the Ayyubids were toppled in Egypt by the Mamluks, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo An-Nasir Yusuf became sultan of the remaining part of the Ayyubid Empire. He ruled Syria from his seat in Aleppo until, on 24 January 1260, the city was taken by the Mongols under Hulagu in alliance with their vassals the Frankish knights of the ruler of Antioch Bohemond VI and his father-in-law the Armenian ruler Hethum I. The city was poorly defended by Turanshah, and as a result the walls fell after six days of siege, and the citadel fell four weeks later. The Muslim population was massacred and many Jews were also killed. The Christian population was spared. Turanshah was shown unusual respect by the Mongols, and was allowed to live because of his age and bravery. The city was then given to the former Emir of Homs, al-Ashraf, and a Mongol garrison was established in the city. Some of the spoils were also given to Hethum I for his assistance in the attack. The Mongol Army then continued on to Damascus, which surrendered, and the Mongols entered the city on 1 March 1260.\n\nMamluk period\nIn September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks negotiated for a treaty with the Franks of Acre which allowed them to pass through Crusader territory unmolested, and engaged the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260. The Mamluks won a decisive victory, killing the Mongols' Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and five days later they had retaken Damascus. Aleppo was recovered by the Muslims within a month, and a Mamluk governor placed to govern the city. Hulagu sent troops to try to recover Aleppo in December. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat.\n\nThe Mamluk governor of the city became insubordinate to the central Mamluk authority in Cairo, and in Autumn 1261 the Mamluk leader Baibars sent an army to reclaim the city. In October 1271, the Mongols led by general Samagar took the city again, attacking with 10,000 horsemen from Anatolia, and defeating the Turcoman troops who were defending Aleppo. The Mamluk garrisons fled to Hama, until Baibars came north again with his main army, and the Mongols retreated.\nOn 20 October 1280, the Mongols took the city again, pillaging the markets and burning the mosques. The Muslim inhabitants fled for Damascus, where the Mamluk leader Qalawun assembled his forces. When his army advanced following the Second Battle of Homs in October 1281, the Mongols again retreated, back across the Euphrates. In October 1299, Ghazan captured the city, joined by his vassal Armenian King Hethum II, whose forces included some Templars and Hospitallers.\nIn 1400, the Mongol-Turkic leader Tamerlane captured the city again from the Mamluks. He massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city. After the withdrawal of the Mongols, all the Muslim population returned to Aleppo. On the other hand, Christians who left the city during the Mongol invasion, were unable to resettle back in their own quarter in the old town, a fact that led them to establish a new neighbourhood in 1420, built at the northern suburbs of Aleppo outside the city walls, to become known as al-Jdeydeh quarter (\"new district\" Arabic: جديدة).\n\nOttoman era\nAleppo became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516 as part of the vast expansion of the Ottoman borders during the reign of Selim I. The city then had around 50,000 inhabitants, or 11,224 households according to an Ottoman census. In 1517, Selim I obtained a fatwa from Sunnite religious leaders and unleashed violence on the Alawites, killing 9,400 men, which is known as the Massacre of the Telal. It was the centre of the Aleppo Eyalet; the rest of what later became Syria was part of either the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Sidon or Raqqa. Following the Ottoman provincial reform of 1864 Aleppo became the centre of the newly constituted Vilayet of Aleppo in 1866.\nAleppo's agriculture was well-developed in the Ottoman period. Archaeological excavations revealed water mills in its river basin. Contemporary Chinese source also suggests Aleppo in the Ottoman period had well-developed animal husbandry.\nDuring his travels to the Levant in the 17th century, French traveler Jacques Goujon recounted how the Maronite community in Aleppo, facing financial difficulties and considering conversion to Islam due to their inability to pay the jizya tax, was aided by the Franciscans who bought their church, enabling them to meet their tax obligations.\nMoreover, thanks to its strategic geographic location on the trade route between Anatolia and the east, Aleppo rose to high prominence in the Ottoman era, at one point being second only to Constantinople in the empire. By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced Damascus as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. This is reflected by the fact that the Levant Company of London, a joint-trading company founded in 1581 to monopolize England's trade with the Ottoman Empire, never attempted to settle a factor, or agent, in Damascus, despite having had permission to do so. Aleppo served as the company's headquarters until the late 18th century.\n\nAs a result of the economic development, many European states had opened consulates in Aleppo during the 16th and the 17th centuries, such as the consulate of the Republic of Venice in 1548, the consulate of France in 1562, the consulate of England in 1583 and the consulate of the Netherlands in 1613. The Armenian community of Aleppo also rose to prominence in this period as they moved into the city to take up trade and developed the new quarter of Judayda. The most outstanding among Aleppine Armenian merchants during the late 16th and early 17th centuries were Khwaja Petik Chelebi, the richest merchant in the city, and his brother Khwaja Sanos Chelebi, who monopolized Aleppine silk trade and were important patrons of the Armenians.\n\n \nHowever, the prosperity Aleppo experienced in the 16th and 17th century started to fade as silk production in Iran went into decline with the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1722. By mid-century, caravans were no longer bringing silk from Iran to Aleppo, and local Syrian production was insufficient for Europe's demand. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. According to Halil İnalcık, \"Aleppo ... underwent its worst catastrophe with the wholesale destruction of its villages by Bedouin raiding in the later years of the century, creating a long-running famine which by 1798 killed half of its inhabitants.\"\nThe economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo's decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo. The city nevertheless continued to play an important economic role and shifted its commercial focus from long-distance caravan trade to more regional trade in wool and agricultural products. This period also saw the immigration of numerous \"Levantine\" (European-origin) families who dominated international trade. Aleppo's mixed commercial tribunal (ticaret mahkamesi), one of the first in the Ottoman Empire, was set up around 1855.\n\nReference is made to the city in 1606 in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. The witches torment the captain of the ship the Tiger, which was headed to Aleppo from England and endured a 567-day voyage before returning unsuccessfully to port. Reference is also made to the city in Shakespeare's Othello when Othello speaks his final words (ACT V, ii, 349f.): \"Set you down this/And say besides that in Aleppo once,/Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk/Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,/I took by th' throat the circumcised dog/And smote him—thus!\" (Arden Shakespeare Edition, 2004). The English naval chaplain Henry Teonge describes in his diary a visit he paid to the city in 1675, when there was a colony of Western European merchants living there.\n\nThe city remained under Ottoman rule until the empire's collapse, but was occasionally riven with internal feuds as well as attacks of cholera from 1823. Around 20–25 percent of the population died of plague in 1827. In 1850, a Muslim mob attacked Christian neighbourhoods, tens of Christians were killed and several churches looted. Though this event has been portrayed as driven by pure sectarian principles, Bruce Masters argues that such analysis of this period of violence is too shallow and neglects the tensions that existed among the population due to the commercial favor afforded to certain Christian minorities by the Tanzimat Reforms during this time which played a large role in creating antagonism between previously cooperative groups of Muslim and Christians in the eastern quarters of the city. By 1901, the city's population was around 110,000.\nIn October 1918, Aleppo was captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Forces and the 5th Cavalry Division of the Allied forces from the Ottoman Empire during the World War I. At the end of war, the Treaty of Sèvres made most of the Vilayet of Aleppo, including the cities of Urfa, Marash, and Aintab, part of the newly established nation of Syria. However, Kemal Atatürk annexed most of the Vilayet of Aleppo as well as Allied-controlled Cilicia to Turkey in his War of Independence. The Muslim Arab and Kurdish residents in the province supported the Turks in this war against the French, including the leader of the Hananu Revolt, Ibrahim Hananu, who directly coordinated with Atatürk and received weaponry from him. The outcome, however, was disastrous for Aleppo, because as per the Treaty of Lausanne, most of the vilayet was made part of Turkey with the exception of Aleppo and Alexandretta; thus Aleppo was cut from its northern satellites which connected it to the Anatolian cities beyond on which Aleppo depended heavily in commerce. Moreover, the Sykes-Picot division of the Near East separated Aleppo from most of Mesopotamia, including its twin city of Mosul, which also harmed the economy of Aleppo. The outcome of these newly created borders was epochal, as they redirected Syria's would-be capital from Aleppo to Damascus.\n\nFrench mandate\nThe State of Aleppo was declared by French General Henri Gouraud in September 1920 as part of a French plan to make Syria easier to administer by dividing it into several smaller states. France became more concerned about the idea of a united Syria after the Battle of Maysaloun.\nBy separating Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud wanted to capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities and turn it into political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to address it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to satisfy Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again. Damascus's relative economic weakness was further exacerbated by the economic success of Beirut during the 1920s, a territory part of the larger French Mandate at the time.\n\nThe limited economic resources of the Syrian states made the option of completely independent states undesirable for France, because it threatened an opposite result: the states collapsing and being forced back into unity. This was why France proposed the idea of a Syrian federation that was realized in 1923. Initially, Gouraud envisioned the federation as encompassing all the states, even Lebanon. In the end however, only three states participated: Aleppo, Damascus, and the Alawite State. The capital of the federation was Aleppo at first, but it was relocated to Damascus. The president of the federation was Subhi Barakat, an Antioch-born politician from Aleppo.\n\nThe federation ended in December 1924, when France merged Aleppo and Damascus into a single Syrian State and separated the Alawite State again. This action came after the federation decided to merge the three federated states into one and to take steps encouraging Syria's financial independence, steps which France viewed as too much.\n\nWhen the Syrian Revolt erupted in southern Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections that were supposed to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians that the people in Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. Syrian nationalists had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a punitive measure against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt, however, the result was respected. This was the last time that independence was proposed for Aleppo.\nBad economic situation of the city after the separation of the northern countryside was exacerbated further in 1939 when Alexandretta was annexed to Turkey as Hatay State, thus depriving Aleppo of its main port of Iskenderun and leaving it in total isolation within Syria.\n\nPost-independence\nThe increasing disagreements between Aleppo and Damascus led eventually to the split of the National Block into two factions: the National Party, established in Damascus in 1946, and the People's Party, established in Aleppo in 1948 by Rushdi al-Kikhya, Nazim Qudsi and Mustafa Bey Barmada. An underlying cause of the disagreement, in addition to the union with Iraq, was Aleppo's intention to relocate the capital from Damascus. The issue of the capital became an open debate matter in 1950 when the Popular Party presented a constitution draft that called Damascus a \"temporary capital.\"\n\nThe first coup d'état in modern Syrian history was carried out in March 1949 by an army officer from Aleppo, Hussni Zaim. However, lured by the absolute power he enjoyed as a dictator, Zaim soon developed a pro-Egyptian, pro-Western orientation and abandoned the cause of union with Iraq. This incited a second coup only four months after his. The second coup, led by Sami Hinnawi (also officer from Aleppo), empowered the Popular Party and actively sought to realize the union with Iraq. The news of an imminent union with Iraq incited a third coup the same year: in December 1949, Adib Shishakly led a coup preempting a union with Iraq that was about to be declared.\n\nSoon after Shishakly's domination ended in 1954, a union with Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser was implemented in 1958. The union, however, collapsed three and a half years later when a junta of young Damascene officers carried out a separatist coup. Aleppo resisted the separatist coup, but eventually it had no choice but to recognize the new government.\n\nIn March 1963 a coalition of Baathists, Nasserists, and Socialists launched a new coup whose declared objective was to restore the union with Egypt. However, the new government only restored the flag of the union. Soon thereafter disagreement between the Baathists and the Nasserists over the restoration of the union became a crisis, and the Baathists ousted the Nasserists from power. The Nasserists, most of whom were from the Aleppine middle class, responded with an insurgency in Aleppo in July 1963.\nAgain, the Ba'ath government tried to absorb the dissent of the Syrian middle class (whose center of political activism was Aleppo) by putting to the front Amin al-Hafiz, a Baathist military officer from Aleppo.\n\nPresident Hafez al-Assad, who came to power in 1970, relied on support from the business class in Damascus. This gave Damascus further advantage over Aleppo, and hence Damascus came to dominate the Syrian economy. The strict centralization of the Syrian state, the intentional direction of resources towards Damascus, and the hegemony Damascus enjoys over the Syrian economy made it increasingly hard for Aleppo to compete. Despite this, Aleppo remained a nationally important economic and cultural center.\n\nOn 16 June 1979, thirty-two military cadets were massacred by antigovernmental Islamist rebel group Muslim Brotherhood. In the subsequent violence around fifty people were killed. On 10 July a further twenty-two Syrian soldiers were killed. Both terrorist attacks were part of the Islamist uprising in Syria. In 1980, events escalated into the a large-scale military operation in Aleppo, where Syrian government responded with military and security forces, sending in tens of thousands of troops backed by tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters. Several hundred rebels were killed in and around city and eight thousand were arrested. By February 1981, the Islamist uprising in the city of Aleppo was suppressed.\nSince the late 1990s, Aleppo has become one of the fastest growing cities in the Levant and the Middle East. The opening of the industrial city of Shaykh Najjar and the influx of new investments and flow of the new industries after 2004 also contributed to the development of the city. In 2006, Aleppo was named by the Islamic Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) as the capital of Islamic culture.\nBefore the Syrian civil war, Aleppo was the third largest city in the Middle East after Cairo and Beirut in terms of the number of Christians.\n\nSyrian civil war\nOn 12 August 2011, some months after protests had begun elsewhere in Syria, anti-government protests were held in several districts of Aleppo, including the city's Sakhour district. During this demonstration, which included tens of thousands of protesters, security forces shot and killed at least twelve people. Two months later, a pro-government demonstration was held in Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, in the heart of the city. According to the New York Times, the 11 October 2011 rally in support of Bashar al-Assad was attended by large crowds, while state and local media claimed more than 1.5 million attended and stated that it was one of the largest rallies ever held in Syria.\nIn early 2012, rebels began bombing Aleppo after the spread of anti-government protests. On 10 February 2012, suicide car bombs exploded outside two security compounds — the Military Intelligence Directorate's local headquarters, and a Syrian Internal Security Forces barracks — reportedly killing 28 (four civilians, thirteen military personnel and eleven security personnel) and wounding 235. On 18 March 2012, another car bomb blast in a residential neighbourhood reportedly killed two security personnel and one female civilian, and wounded 30 residents.\n\nIn late July 2012, the conflict reached Aleppo in earnest when rebels in the city's surrounding countryside mounted their first offensive there, apparently trying to capitalise on momentum gained during the Damascus assault. Then, some of the civil war's \"most devastating bombing and fiercest fighting\" took place in Aleppo, often in residential areas. In the summer, autumn and winter of 2012 house-to-house fighting between armed opposition and government forces continued, and by the spring 2013 the Syrian Army had entrenched itself in the western part of Aleppo (government loyalist forces were operating from a military base in the southern part of the city) and the Free Syrian Army in the eastern part with a no man's land between them. One estimate of casualties by an international humanitarian organization is that by this time 13,500 had been killed in the fighting — 1,500 under 5 years of age — and that another 23,000 had been injured. Local police stations in the city, used as bases of government forces and hated and feared by residents, were a focus of much of the conflict.\n\nAs a result of the severe battle, many sections in Al-Madina Souq (part of the Old City of Aleppo World Heritage Site), including parts of the Great Mosque of Aleppo and other medieval buildings in the ancient city, were destroyed and ruined or burnt in late summer 2012 as the armed groups of the Syrian Arab Army and the Free Syrian Army fought for control of the city. By March 2013, a majority of Aleppo's factory owners transferred their goods to Turkey with the full knowledge and facilitation of the Turkish government.\nA stalemate that had been in place for four years ended in July 2016, when Syrian Army troops closed the last supply line of the rebels into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counter-offensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign. The rebels agreed to evacuate from their remaining areas in December 2016. Syrian government victory with Russian aerial bombardment was widely seen as a potential turning point in Syria's civil war. On 22 December, the evacuation was completed with the Syrian Army declaring it had taken complete control of the city. Red Cross later confirmed that the evacuation of all civilians and rebels was complete.\nWhen the battle ended, 500,000 refugees and internally displaced persons returned to Aleppo, and Syrian state media said that hundreds of factories returned to production as electricity supply greatly increased. Many parts of the city that were affected are undergoing reconstruction. On 15 April 2017, a convoy of buses carrying evacuees was attacked by a suicide bomber in Aleppo, killing more than 126 people, including at least 80 children. Syrian state media reported that the Aleppo shopping festival took place on 17 November 2017 to promote industry in the city. A YPG commander stated in February 2018 that Kurdish fighters had shifted to Afrin to help repel the Turkish assault. As a result, he said the pro-Syrian government forces had regained control of the districts previously controlled by them. In February 2020, government forces achieved a major breakthrough when they captured the last remaining rebel-held areas in Aleppo's western periphery, thus decisively ending the clashes that began with the Battle of Aleppo over eight years prior.\nThe city suffered damage due to the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.\n\nTakeover by Syrian opposition\nOn 29 November 2024, Syrian opposition groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured the city during the Battle of Aleppo  as part of the offensive in northwestern Syria.\n\nGeography\nAleppo lies about 120 km (75 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea, on a plateau 380 m (1,250 ft) above sea level, 45 km (28 mi) east of the Syrian-Turkish border checkpoint of Bab al-Hawa. The city is surrounded by farmlands from the north and the west, widely cultivated with olive and pistachio trees. To the east, Aleppo approaches the dry areas of the Syrian Desert.\n\nThe city was founded a few kilometres south of the location of the current old city, on the right bank of Queiq River which arises from the Aintab plateau in the north and runs through Aleppo southward to the fertile country of Qinnasrin. The old city of Aleppo lies on the left bank of the Queiq. It was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected. The radius of the circle is about 10 km (6.2 mi). The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. The old city was enclosed within an ancient wall that was last rebuilt by the Mamluks. The wall has since disappeared. It had nine gates and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.\nOccupying an area of more than 190 km2 (73 sq mi), Aleppo is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Middle East. According to the new major plan of the city adopted in 2001, it is envisaged to increase the total area of Aleppo up to 420 km2 (160 sq mi) by the end of 2015.\n\nClimate\nAleppo has a hot steppe climate (Köppen: BSh). The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, namely the Alawiyin Mountains and the Nur Mountains, largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate (rain shadow effect). The average high and low temperature throughout the year is 23.8 and 11.1 °C (74.8 and 52.0 °F). The average precipitation is 329.4 mm (12.97 in). More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.\n\nArchitecture\nAleppo is characterized with mixed architectural styles, having been ruled by, among others, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.\n\nVarious types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city. The quarters of al-Jdayde district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings. Baroque architecture of the 19th and early 20th centuries is common in al-Azizyah district, including the Villa Rose. The new Shahbaa district is a mixture of several styles, such as Neo-classic, Norman, Oriental and even Chinese architecture.\nSince the old city is characterized with its large mansions, narrow alleys and covered souqs, the modern city's architecture has replenished the town with wide roads and large squares such as the Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, the Liberty Square, the President's Square and Sabaa Bahrat Square\n\nThere is a relatively clear division between old and new Aleppo. The older portions of the city, with an approximate area of 160 ha (0.6 sq mi) are contained within a wall, 5 km (3.1 mi) in circuit with nine gates. The huge medieval castle in the city — known as the Citadel of Aleppo — occupies the center of the ancient part, in the shape of an acropolis.\nBeing subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.\nThe mainly white-stoned old town was built within the historical walls of the city, pierced by the nine historical gates, while the newer quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. The new quarter known as al-Jdayde is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. After Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of al-Jdayde. The inhabitants of the new quarters were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.\nThus, the Old City of Aleppo — composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls — has an approximate area of 350 ha (1.4 sq mi) housing more than 120,000 residents.\n\nDemographics\nHistorical population\nAccording to the Aleppine historian Sheikh Kamel Al-Ghazzi (1853–1933), the population of Aleppo was around 400,000 before the disastrous earthquake of 1822. Followed by cholera and plague attacks in 1823 and 1827 respectively, the population of the city declined to 110,000 by the end of the 19th century. In 1901, the total population of Aleppo was 108,143 of which Muslims were 76,329 (70.58%), Christians — mostly Catholics — 24,508 (22.66%) and Jews 7,306 (6.76%).\nAleppo's large Christian population swelled with the influx of Armenian and Assyrian Christian refugees during the early 20th-century and after the Armenian and Assyrian genocides of 1915. After the arrival of the first groups of Armenian refugees (1915–1922) the population of Aleppo in 1922 counted 156,748 of which Muslims were 97,600 (62.26%), native Christians — mostly Catholics —  22,117 (14.11%), Jews 6,580 (4.20%), Europeans 2,652 (1.70%), Armenian refugees 20,007 (12.76%) and others 7,792 (4.97%). However, even though a large majority of the Armenians arrived during the period, the city has had an Armenian community since at least the 1100s, when a considerable number of Armenian families and merchants from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia settled in the city. The oldest Armenian church in the city is from 1491 as well, which indicates that they have been there long before.\nThe second period of Armenian flow towards Aleppo marked with the withdrawal of the French troops from Cilicia in 1923. After the arrival of more than 40,000 Armenian refugees between 1923 and 1925, the population of the city reached up to 210,000 by the end of 1925, of which more than a quarter were Armenians.\nAccording to the historical data presented by Al-Ghazzi, the vast majority of the Aleppine Christians were Catholics until the latter days of the Ottoman rule. The growth of the Oriental Orthodox Christians is related with the arrival of the Assyrian survivors from Cilicia and Southern Turkey, while on the other hand, large numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians from the Sanjak of Alexandretta arrived in Aleppo, after the annexation of the Sanjak in 1939 in favour of Turkey.\n\nIn 1944, Aleppo's population was around 325,000, with 112,110 (34.5%) Christians among which Armenians numbered 60,200. Armenians formed more than half of the Christian community in Aleppo until 1947, when many groups of them left for Soviet Armenia within the frames of the Armenian Repatriation Process (1946–1967).\n\nPre-civil war status\nAleppo was the most populous city in Syria, with a population of 2,132,100 as indicated in the latest official census in 2004 by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Its subdistrict (nahiya) consisted of 23 localities with a collective population of 2,181,061 in 2004. According to the official estimate announced by the Aleppo City Council, the population of the city was 2,301,570 by the end of 2005. As a result of the Syrian civil war, however, the city eastern half's population under the control of the opposition had plummeted to an estimated 40,000 by 2015.\n\nMuslims\nMore than 80% of Aleppo's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. They are mainly Syrian Arabs, followed by Turkmens and Kurds. Other Muslim groups include small numbers of ethnic Circassians, Chechens, Albanians, Bosniaks, Greeks and Bulgarians.\n\nChristians\nUntil the beginning of the Battle of Aleppo in 2012, the city contained one of the largest Christian communities in the Middle East. There were many Oriental Orthodox Christian congregations, mainly Armenians and Assyrians (locally known as Syriacs). Historically, the city was the main centre of French Catholic missionaries in Syria.\nThe Christian population of Aleppo was slightly more than 250,000 before the Syrian civil war, representing about 12% of the total population of the city. However, as a consequence of the war, the Christian population of the city decreased to less than 100,000 as of the beginning of 2017, of whom around 30% were ethnic Armenians.\nA significant number of the Assyrians in Aleppo speak Aramaic, hailing from the city of Urfa in Turkey. The large community of Oriental Orthodox Christians belongs to the Armenian Apostolic and Syriac Orthodox churches. However, there is a significant presence of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch as well.\nThere is also a large number Eastern Catholic Christians in the city, including Melkite Greeks, Maronites, Chaldeans, Syrian Catholics and the followers of the Latin Church. Evangelical Christians of different denominations are a minority in the city.\nSeveral districts of the city have a Christian and Armenian majority, such as the old Christian quarter of al-Jdayde. Around 50 churches are operated in the city by the above-mentioned congregations. However, according to the Deputy Chairman of the commission for UNESCO of the Russian Federation, Alexander Dzasokhov, around 20 churches suffered great destruction during the battles in Aleppo, with the most notable being the National Evangelical Church, as well as the surrounding historic churches of al-Jdayde district. On 25 December 2016, following the government victory, Christmas was publicly celebrated in Aleppo for the first time in four years.\n\nJews\nThe city was home to a significant Jewish population from ancient times. The Great Synagogue, built in the 5th century, housed the Aleppo Codex. In the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela recorded that the Jewish community in Aleppo consisted of 5,000 people, calling it one of the largest communities in Bilād al-Shām.\nThe Jews of Aleppo were known for their religious commitment, Rabbinic leadership, and their liturgy, consisting of Pizmonim and Baqashot. After the Spanish Inquisition, the city of Aleppo received many Sephardic Jewish immigrants, who eventually joined with the native Aleppo Jewish community. Peaceful relations existed between the Jews and surrounding population. In the early 20th century, the town's Jews lived mainly in Al-Jamiliyah, Bab Al-Faraj and the neighbourhoods around the Great Synagogue. Unrest in Palestine in the years preceding the establishment of Israel in 1948 resulted in growing hostility towards Jews living in Arab countries, culminating in the Jewish exodus from Arab lands. In December 1947, after the UN decided the partition of Palestine, an Arab mob attacked the Jewish quarter. Homes, schools and shops were badly damaged. Soon after, many of the town's remaining 6,000 Jews emigrated. In 1968, there were an estimated 700 Jews still remaining in Aleppo.\nThe houses and other properties of the Jewish families which were not sold after the migration, remain uninhabited under the protection of the Syrian Government. Most of these properties are in Al-Jamiliyah and Bab Al-Faraj areas, and the neighbourhoods around the Central Synagogue of Aleppo. In 1992, the Syrian government lifted the travel ban on its 4,500 Jewish citizens. Most traveled to the United States, where a sizable number of Syrian Jews currently live in Brooklyn, New York. The last Jews of Aleppo, the Halabi family, were evacuated from the city in October 2016 by the Free Syrian Army and now live in Israel.\nThe Jews from Aleppo referred to their city as \"Aram Tzova\" (ארם צובא) after the ancient Aramean city of Aram-Zobah mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nSpoken languages\nThe Arabic dialect of Aleppo is a type of Syrian Arabic, which is of the North Levantine Arabic variety. Much of its vocabulary is derived from the Syriac language. The Kurdish language is the second most spoken language in the city, after Arabic. Kurds in Aleppo speak the Northern Kurdish (also known as Kurmanji). Syrian Turkmen population of Aleppo speak the Kilis and Antep dialect of the Turkish language. Most Armenians speak the Western form of the Armenian language. The Syriac language is rarely spoken by the Syriac community during daily life, but commonly used as the liturgical language of the Syriac Church. The members of the small Greco-Syrian community in Aleppo speak Arabic. English and French are also spoken.\n\nCulture\nArt\nAleppo is considered one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the Aleppine Muwashshahs, Qudud Halabiya and Maqams (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). In December 2021, the Qudud Halabiya was included into the UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list as Intangible cultural heritage.\nAleppines in general are fond of Arab classical music, the Tarab, and it is not a surprise that many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, Sabah Fakhri, Shadi Jamil, Abed Azrie and Nour Mhanna. Many iconic artists of the Arab music like Sayed Darwish and Mohammed Abdel Wahab were visiting Aleppo to recognize the legacy of Aleppine art and learn from its cultural heritage.\nAleppo is also known for its knowledgeable and cultivated listeners, known as sammi'a or \"connoisseur listeners\". Aleppine musicians often claim that no major Arab artist achieved fame without first earning the approval of the Aleppine sammi'a.\nAleppo hosts many music shows and festivals every year at the citadel amphitheatre, such as the \"Syrian Song Festival\", the \"Silk Road Festival\" and \"Khan al-Harir Festival\".\nAl-Adeyat Archaeological Society founded in 1924 in Aleppo, is a cultural and social organization to preserve the tangible and intangible heritage of Aleppo and Syria in general. The society has branches in other governorates as well.\n\nMuseums\nNational Museum of Aleppo.\nMuseum of the popular traditions known as the Aleppine House at Beit Achiqbash in al-Jdayde.\nAleppo Citadel Museum.\nMuseum of medicine and science at Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili.\nAleppo Memory Museum at Beit Ghazaleh in al-Jdayde.\nZarehian Treasury of the Armenian Apostolic Church at the old Armenian church of the Holy Mother of God, Al-Jdeydeh.\n\nCuisine\nAleppo is surrounded by olive, nut and fruit orchards, and its cuisine is the product of its fertile land and location along the Silk Road. The International Academy of Gastronomy in France awarded Aleppo its culinary prize in 2007. The city has a wide selection of different types of dishes, such as kebab, kibbeh, dolma, hummus, ful halabi, za'atar halabi, muhshi. Ful halabi is a typical Aleppine breakfast meal: fava bean soup with a splash of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and Aleppo's red peppers. The za'atar of Aleppo (thyme) is a kind of oregano which is popular in the regional cuisines.\n\nThe kibbeh is one of the favourite foods of the locals, and the Aleppines have created more than 17 types of kibbeh dishes, which is considered a form of art for them. These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kәbbe sәmmāʔiyye), yogurt (kәbbe labaniyye), quince (kәbbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kәbbe ḥāmḍa), pomegranate sauce and cherry sauce. Other varieties include the \"disk\" kibbeh (kәbbe ʔrāṣ), the \"plate\" kibbeh (kәbbe bәṣfīḥa or kәbbe bṣēniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kәbbe nayye). Kebab Halabi – influenced by Armenian and Turkish tastes – has around 26 variants including: kebab prepared with cherry (kebab karaz), eggplant (kebab banjan), chili pepper with parsley and pine nut (kebab khashkhash), truffle (kebab kamayeh), tomato paste (kebab hindi), cheese and mushroom (kebab ma'juʔa), etc. The favourite drink is Arak, which is usually consumed along with meze, Aleppine kebabs and kibbehs. Al-Shark beer – a product of Aleppo – is also among the favourite drinks. Local wines and brandies are consumed as well.\nAleppo is the origin of different types of sweets and pastries. The Aleppine sweets, such as mabrumeh, siwar es-sett, balloriyyeh, etc., are characterized by containing high rates of ghee butter and sugar. Other sweets include mamuniyeh, shuaibiyyat, mushabbak, zilebiyeh, ghazel al-banat etc. Most pastries contain Aleppine pistachios and other types of nuts.\n\nLeisure and entertainment\nUntil the break-out of the Battle of Aleppo in July 2012, the city was known for its vibrant nightlife. Several night-clubs, bars and cabarets operated at the centre of the city as well as at the northern suburbs. The historic quarter of al-Jdayde was known for its pubs and boutique hotels, situated within ancient oriental mansions, providing special treats from the Aleppine flavour and cuisine, along with local music.\nClub d'Alep, opened in 1945, is a unique social club known for bridge games and other nightlife activities, located in a 19th-century mansion in the Aziziyah district of central Aleppo.\nThe Aleppo Public Park, opened in 1949, is one of the largest planted parks in Syria, located near in the Aziziyah district, where Queiq River breaks through the green park.\nThe Blue Lagoon water park – heavily damaged during the battles – was one of the favourite places among the locals, as it was the first water park in Syria. Aleppo's Shahba Mall – one of the largest shopping centres in Syria – was also among the most visited locations for the locals. It has received major damages during the civil war.\n\nHistorical sites\nSouqs and khans\nThe city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south. The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of 13 km (8.1 mi).\nAl-Madina Souq, as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (ﻗﻴﺴﺎﺭﻳﺎﺕ). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized by their façades, entrances and fortified wooden doors.\n\nGates of Aleppo and other historic buildings\nThe old part of the city is surrounded with 5 km-long (3.1 mi), thick walls, pierced by the nine historical gates (many of them are well-preserved) of the old town. These are, clockwise from the north-east of the citadel:\n\nBab al-Hadid, Bab al-Ahmar, Bab al-Nairab, Bab al-Maqam, Bab Qinnasrin, Bab Antakeya, Bāb Jnēn, Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Nasr.\nThe most significant historic buildings of the ancient city include:\n\nThe Citadel, a large fortress built atop a huge, partially artificial mound rising 50 m (160 ft) above the city, dates back to the first millennium BC. Recent excavations unearthed a temple and 25 statues dating back to the first millennium BC. Many of the current structures date from the 13th century. The Citadel had been extensively damaged by earthquakes, notably in 1822.\nAl-Shibani building, al-Halawiyah Madrasa, al-Muqaddamiyah Madrasa, al-Zahiriyah Madrasa, al-Sultaniyah Madrasa, al-Firdaws Madrasa, Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili, Beit Junblatt, Bab al-Faraj Clock Tower, etc.\n\nThe following are among the important historic mansions of al-Jdayde Christian quarter:\n\nBeit Wakil, an Aleppine mansion built in 1603, with unique wooden decorations. One of its decorations was taken to Berlin and exhibited in the Museum of Islamic Art, known as the Aleppo Room.\nBeit Achiqbash, an old Aleppine house built in 1757. The building is home to the Popular Traditions Museum since 1975, showing fine decorations of the Aleppine art.\nBeit Ghazaleh, an old 17th-century mansion characterized with fine decorations, carved by the Armenian sculptor Khachadur Bali in 1691. It was used as an Armenian elementary school during the 20th century.\n\nPlaces of worship\nGreat Mosque of Aleppo (Jāmi' Bani Omayya al-Kabīr), founded c. 715 by Umayyad caliph Walid I and most likely completed by his successor Sulayman. The building contains a tomb associated with Zachary, father of John the Baptist. Construction of the present structure for Nur al-Din commenced in 1158. However, it was damaged during the Mongol invasion of 1260 and was rebuilt. The 45 m-high (148 ft) tower (described as \"the principal monument of medieval Syria\") was erected in 1090–1092 under the first Seljuk sultan, Tutush I. It had four façades with different styles. The tower was completely destroyed during the Syrian civil war in March 2013 (reported on 24 March 2013).\nAl-Nuqtah Mosque (\"Mosque of the drop [of blood]\"), a Shī'ah mosque, which contains a stone said to be marked by a drop of Husayn's blood. The site is believed to have previously been a monastery, which was converted into a mosque in 944.\nAl-Shuaibiyah Mosque, Al-Qaiqan Mosque, Mahmandar Mosque, Altun Bogha Mosque, Al-Sahibiyah Mosque, Bahsita Mosque, Al-Tawashi Mosque, Al-Otrush Mosque, Al-Saffahiyah Mosque, Khusruwiyah Mosque, Al-Adiliyah Mosque, Bahramiyah Mosque, etc.\nChurches of al-Jdayde quarter: the Forty Martyrs Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, the Dormition of Our Lady Greek Orthodox church, Mar Assia al-Hakim Syrian Catholic church, the Maronite Cathedral of Saint Elijah, the Armenian Catholic Cathedral of Our Mother of Reliefs and the Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral of Virgin Mary.\nCentral Synagogue of Aleppo or al-Bandara synagogue, dating to the 9th century. The synagogue was destroyed during an anti-Jewish pogrom in 1947. In the 1980s, the building was restored, but destroyed again during the civil war.\n\nHammams\nAleppo was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion, when many of the prominent structures of the city were destroyed. Before the civil war, 18 hammams were operating in the old city, including:\n\nHammam al-Nahhasin built during the 12th century near khan al-Nahhaseen.\nHammam al-Sultan built in 1211 by Az-Zahir Ghazi.\nHammam al-Bayadah of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\nHammam Yalbugha built in 1491 by the Emir of Aleppo Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.\nHammam al-Jawhary, hammam Azdemir, hammam Bahram Pasha, hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\nAs a city with an ancient architectural style characterized by covered markets, khans, baths, and schools, in addition to mosques and churches, the city is an archaeological treasure in need of continuous care and maintenance. The city was significantly replanned after the end of World War II. In 1954, an architectural plan was adopted by the French architect André Guitton, who proposed the construction of several wide avenues through the city to accommodate the entry of cars. Between 1954 and 1983, many old neighborhoods were demolished under this pretext for expansion, particularly in the northern areas such as Bab al-Faraj and Bab Janin. However, growing awareness of the importance of these buildings ultimately led to the cancellation of Guitton's plan in 1979 and its replacement by a plan by the Swiss urban engineer Stefano Bianco, who launched the idea of preserving the ancient urban fabric of Old Aleppo. This paved the way for UNESCO to include the Old City of Aleppo on the World Heritage List in 1986.\n\nNearby attractions and the Dead Cities\nAleppo's western suburbs are home to a group of historical sites and villages which are commonly known as the Dead Cities. Around 700 abandoned settlements in the northwestern parts of Syria before the 5th century, contain remains of Christian Byzantine architecture. Many hundreds of those settlements are in Mount Simeon (Jabal Semaan) and Jabal Halaqa regions at the western suburbs of Aleppo, within the range of Limestone Massif. Dead Cities were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\".\n\nThe most notable Dead cities and archaeological sites in Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd near Aleppo include: Kalota Castle and churches northwest of Aleppo, Kharab Shams Byzantine basilica of the 4th century, the half-ruined Roman basilica in Fafertin village dating back to 372 AD, the old Byzantine settlement of Surqanya village at the northwest of Aleppo, the 4th-century Basilica of Sinhar settlement, the Mushabbak Basilica dating back to the second half of the 5th century, the 9th-century BC Assyrian settlement of Kafr Nabu, Brad village and the Saint Julianus Maronite monastery (399–402 AD) where the shrine of Saint Maron is located, the 5th-century Kimar settlement of the Roman and Byzantine eras, the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites of the 5th century, the Syro-Hittite Ain Dara temple of the Iron Age dating back to the 10th and 8th centuries BC, the ancient city of Cyrrhus with the old Roman amphitheatre and two historic bridges, etc.\n\nTransportation\nHighways and roads\nThe main highway leading to and within the city is the M4 Highway, which runs in the eastern side of the city from south to north along the Queiq River. Driving south on M4 Highway gives access to M5 Highway leading to Homs, Hama, and Damascus. The northern bypass of the city called Castello Road leads through Azaz to the border with Turkey and further to the city of Gaziantep. Driving east on M4 Highway gives access to the coastal road leading to Latakia and Tartus. Within the city, main routes include Al Jalaa Street, Shukri Al-Quwatly Street, King Faisal Street, Bab Antakya Street, Ibrahim Hanano Street and Tishreen Boulevard.\n\nPublic transport\nThe city of Aleppo is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network of buses and minibuses. New modern buses are used to connect the city with Damascus and the other Syrian cities to the east and the south of Aleppo. The city is also served by local and inter-city share taxis.\n\nRailway\nAleppo was one of the major stations of Syria that was connected to the Baghdad Railway in 1912, within the Ottoman Empire. The connections to Turkey and onwards to Ankara still exist today, with a twice weekly train from Damascus. It is perhaps for this historical reason that Aleppo is the headquarters of Syria national railway network, Chemins de Fer Syriens. As the railway is relatively slow, much of the passenger traffic to the port of Latakia had moved to road-based air-conditioned coaches. But this has reversed in recent years with the 2005 introduction of South Korean built DMUs providing a regular bi-hourly express service to both Latakia and Damascus, which miss intermediate stations.\nHowever, after the break-out of the civil war in 2011, the Syrian railway network has suffered major damage and is partially out of use. Reconstruction of the Damascus-Aleppo railway line was started in 2020, after its completion and securing rail transport will be resumed.\nThe opening scene in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express takes place on the railway station in Aleppo: \"It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express.\"\n\nAirport\nAleppo International Airport (IATA: ALP, ICAO: OSAP) is the international airport serving the city. The airport serves as a secondary hub for Syrian Air. The history of the airport dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. It was upgraded and developed in the years to 1999 when the new current terminal was opened.\nThe airport was closed since the beginning of 2013 as a result of the military operations in the area. However, following the Syrian government's recapture of eastern Aleppo during the Battle of Aleppo, an airplane conducted its first flight from the airport in four years.\n\nEconomy\nTrade and industry\nThe main role of the city was as a trading place throughout the history, as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from India, the Tigris and Euphrates regions and the route coming from Damascus in the South, which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast. Although trade was often directed away from the city for political reasons , it continued to thrive until the Europeans began to use the Cape route to India and later to use the route through Egypt to the Red Sea.\nThe commercial traditions in Aleppo have deep roots in the history. The Aleppo Chamber of commerce founded in 1885, is one of the oldest chambers in the Middle East and the Arab world. According to many historians, Aleppo was the most developed commercial and industrial city in the Ottoman Empire after Constantinople and Cairo. However the post-Ottoman conditions favored other cities, such as Haifa, whose economy thrived more in the new circumstances. The issue was that the city's hinterland wasn't included in the \"customs-free zone\" between the newly established British and French mandates which hurt the city's economic growth.\n\nAs the largest urban area in pre-civil war Syria, Aleppo was considered the capital of Syrian industry. The economy of the city was mainly driven by textiles, chemicals, pharmaceutics, agro-processing industries, electrical commodities, alcoholic beverages, engineering and tourism. It occupied a dominant position in the country's manufacturing output, with a share of more than 50% of manufacturing employment, and an even greater export share.\n\nPossessing the most developed commercial and industrial plants in Syria, Aleppo is a major centre for manufacturing precious metals and stones. The annual amount of the processed gold produced in Aleppo is around 8.5 tonnes, making up to 40% of the entire manufactured gold in Syria.\nThe industrial city of Aleppo in Sheikh Najjar district is one of the largest in Syria and the region. Occupying an area of 4,412 ha (10,900 acres) in the north-eastern suburbs of Aleppo, the total investments in the city counted more than US$3.4 billion during 2010. Still under development, it is envisaged to open hotels, exhibition centres and other facilities within the industrial city.\nIn July 2022, the Aleppo Thermal Power Plant, which generates 200 megawatts of electricity for the city and its surroundings, was put into partial operation after restoration.\nThe old traditional crafts are well-preserved in the old part of the city. The famous laurel soap of Aleppo is considered to be the world's first hard soap.\n\nConstruction\nIn the 2000s, Aleppo was one of the fastest-growing cities in Syria and the Middle East. Many villagers and inhabitants of other Syrian districts are migrating to Aleppo in an effort to find better job opportunities, a fact that always increases population pressure, with a growing demand for new residential capacity. New districts and residential communities have been built in the suburbs of Aleppo, many of them were still under construction as of 2010.\nTwo major construction projects are scheduled in Aleppo: the \"Old City Revival\" project and the \"Reopening of the stream bed of Queiq River\":\n\nThe Old City revival project completed its first phase by the end of 2008, and the second phase started in early 2010. The purpose of the project is the preservation of the old city of Aleppo with its souqs and khans, and restoration of the narrow alleys of the old city and the roads around the citadel.\nThe restoration of Queiq River is directed towards the revival of the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream bed and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2008 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.\nLike other major Syrian cities, Aleppo is suffering from the dispersal of informal settlements: almost half of its population (around 1.2 million) is estimated to live in 22 informal settlements of different types.\n\nEducation\nAs the main economic centre of Syria, Aleppo has a large number of educational institutions. According to the UNICEF, there are around over 1280 schools in Aleppo and its suburbs that welcomed 485,000 new students as of September 2018, and around 25,000 students resumed their learning as of December 2021.\nNot to mention there are some colleges. In addition to the University of Aleppo, there are state colleges and private universities which attract large numbers of students from other regions of Syria and the Arab countries. The number of the students in Aleppo University is more than 60,000. The university has 18 faculties and 8 technical colleges in the city of Aleppo.\nCurrently, there are two private universities operating in the city: al-Shahba University (SU) and Mamoun University for Science and Technology (MUST). Branches of the state conservatory and the fine arts school are also operating in the city.\nAleppo is home to several Christian schools, such as St. Mariam's Christian School (the city's main Christian school) and Armenian private schools as well as two international schools: International School of Aleppo and Lycée Français d'Alep.\n\nSport\nThe city of Aleppo is considered as important centre of team sports with football being the most popular in the city. The five major sporting clubs of the city are al-Ittihad SC, al-Hurriya SC, al-Yarmouk SC, Jalaa SC and Ouroube SC. Many other sport clubs are located in several districts of the city including al-Herafyeen SC, Shorta Aleppo SC, Ommal Aleppo SC, Nayrab SC, al-Shahbaa SC, al-Qala'a SC and Aleppo Railways SC.\n\nBasketball is also played in the city. All of the 5 Aleppine major sport clubs participate in the men's and women's top division of the Syrian Basketball League, in which both Jalaa SC and Al-Ittihad SC consecutively dominated winning the league from 1956 to 1993.\nIn July 2022, international qualifying matches were played in Aleppo for the first time since the beginning of the conflict. In the Hamadaniah Arena, the Syrian national team met the teams of Iran and Bahrain as part of the qualification for the World Cup.\nOther sports being practiced by the major clubs in the city include tennis, handball, volleyball, athletics, table tennis and swimming.\nWith a capacity of 53,200 seats, the Aleppo International Stadium is the largest sports venue in Syria. Other major sport venues in the city include the Al-Hamadaniah Sports Arena, Bassel al-Assad Swimming Complex, and Al-Hamadaniah Olympic Swimming and Diving Complex.\nOn 29 January 2017, Aleppo hosted the first sports event since 2012, when the local football rivals al-Ittihad SC and al-Hurriya SC played at the Ri'ayet al-Shabab Stadium, within the frames of the 2016–17 Syrian Premier League.\n\nMunicipality\nThe city of Aleppo is the capital of Aleppo Governorate and the centre of Mount Simeon District. Aleppo City Council is the governing body of the city. The first municipality council was formed in 1868. However, the governor being appointed directly by the president of the republic, has a supreme authority over the city and the entire governorate. But the city is managed directly by the mayor.\n\nSubdivisions\nDistricts in Aleppo can be considered in four categories:\n\nOld quarters inside the walls of the ancient city.\nOld quarters outside the walls of the ancient city.\nModern neighborhoods, including a newly developed area called The New Aleppo.\nInformal settlements.\n\nIntegrated Urban Development in Aleppo\nThe \"Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo\" (UDP) is a joint programme between the German Development Cooperation (GTZ) and the Municipality of Aleppo. The programme promotes capacities for sustainable urban management and development at the national and municipal level.\nThe Programme has three fields of work:\n\nAleppo City Development Strategy (CDS): promoting support structures for the municipality, including capacity building, networking, and developing municipal strength in the national development dialogue.\nInformal Settlements (IS): includes strategy and management development of informal settlements.\nThe Project for the Rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo (OCA): includes further support for the rehabilitation of the Old City, as well as for a city development strategy oriented to the long term.\nThe UDP cooperates closely with other interventions in the sector, namely the EU-supported 'Municipal Administration Modernization' programme. It is planned to operate from 2007 to 2016.\n\nPreservation of the ancient city\nAs an ancient trading centre, Aleppo has impressive souqs, khans, hammams, madrasas, mosques and churches, all in need of more care and preservation work. After World War II the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of \"preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo\" paving the way for UNESCO to declare the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.\n\nSeveral international institutions have joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality are implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.\nThe German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) has made a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAleppo is twinned with:\n\n Brest, Belarus (2010)\n Gaziantep, Turkey (2005, 2025)\n Izmir, Turkey (1995)\n Lyon, France (2000)\n Osmangazi, Turkey (2010)\n\nNotable people\nSee also\nPinus halepensis\nTulipa aleppensis\nAleppo Room\nJaysh Muhammad in Bilad al-Sham\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBasan, Osman Aziz (2010).

      "summary": "Aleppo is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's largest city by urban area, and was the primary economic centre until it was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria. Aleppo is also the largest city in Syria's northern governorates and one of the largest cities in the Levant region.\nAleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.\nAt the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.",

      "content": "حَلَب هي مدينة في شمال سوريا وهي مركز محافظة حلب التي تعد أكبر المحافظات السورية من ناحية تعداد السكان بعدد سكان رسمي يفوق 4.045 مليون (تقديرات 2004) كما أنها تعتبر العاصمة الاقتصادية لسوريا. تقع شمال غرب سوريا على بعد 310 كم (193 ميلاً) من دمشق. كما أنها تعد أكبر مدن بلاد الشام،  وكانت عاصمة لمملكة يمحاض الأمورية، وتعاقبت عليها بعد ذلك حضاراتٌ عدة مثل الحثية و‌الآرامية و‌الآشورية و‌الفارسية و‌الهيلينية و‌الرومانية و‌البيزنطية والإسلامية. وفي العصر العباسي برزت حلب كعاصمة للدولة الحمدانية التي امتدت من حلب إلى الجزيرة الفراتية و‌الموصل. تعد حلب واحدة من أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم وثاني اقدم مدن سوريا بعد العاصمة دمشق وذلك منذ بداية الألفية السادسة قبل الميلاد، حيث أظهرت الحفريات في تل السودة وتل الأنصاري الواقعتين جنوب المدينة القديمة أن المنطقة كانت قد احتلت في الجزء الأخير من الألفية الثالثة على الأقل  ويظهر هذا في أول ذكر لحلب في الألواح المسمارية المكتشفة في مملكة إيبلا و‌بلاد الرافدين حيث لوحظ تفوقها العسكري والتجاري. مثل هذا التاريخ ربما يرجع إلى كونها نقطة تجارية إستراتيجية في منتصف الطريق بين البحر الأبيض المتوسط و‌بلاد الرافدين وفي كونها في نهاية طريق الحرير الذي يمر عبر آسيا الوسطى و‌بلاد الرافدين. وبقيت حلب لقرون أكبر المدن السورية وثالث مدينة في الدولة العثمانية بعد إسطنبول و‌القاهرة. تحولت التجارة إلى البحر عندما تم افتتاح قناة السويس عام 1869 وبدأت أهمية حلب بالتراجع بشكل بطيء. تلقت حلب أكبر الضربات عند بداية القرن العشرين، فعند سقوط الخلافة العثمانية بعد الحرب العالمية الأولى سلخت عن حلب أجزاؤها الشمالية (معظمها ضمن الأقاليم السورية الشمالية) التي ضمت إلى تركيا عام 1920 بالاتفاق بين أتاتورك و‌سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي. خسرت حلب التجارة مع مدن هذه الأقاليم خاصة المدن التي كانت تابعة لولاية حلب تاريخيا كعنتاب و‌مرعش و‌أضنة و‌مرسين، كما خسرت السكك الحديدية المهمّة التي كانت تصلها بالموصل. أدت اتفاقية سايكس بيكو وفصل العراق عن سورية إلى كساد وتدهور كبير في اقتصاد حلب. وفي عام 1940 فقدت حلب إمكانية وصولها إلى البحر بعد خسارتها لمنفذها الرئيسي على البحر الأبيض المتوسط في الإسكندرونة. تراجع موقع حلب السياسي بسبب جعل مدينة دمشق عاصمة لسوريا. رغم كل هذه الضربات، بقيت هذه المدينة عاصمة اقتصادية لسوريا، فهي تضم أهم المعامل الصناعية وهي أيضا تشكل مركزا للمناطق الزراعية في سوريا، وخاصة زراعة القطن الضرورية لمعامل النسيج المزدهرة في المدينة. كانت حلب وريفها تعطي معظم الناتج الإجمالي السوري حتى نهاية الخمسينات  أصبحت المدينة القديمة في مدينة حلب من مواقع التراث العالمي اليونسكو في عام 1986. وقد نالت المدينة لقب عاصمة الثقافة الإسلامية عن الوطن العربي في عام 2006 م. وخلال أحداث الأزمة السورية، تضررت حلب بشكل كبير إنسانيا واقتصاديا بفعل القتال والقصف ونقل المعامل إلى تركيا، وتوقفت عجلة الاقتصاد في المدينة وتعرض الكثير من معالمها الأثرية للدمار مثل مئذنة المسجد الأموي واحتراق معظم أسواق حلب القديمة.\n\nالتسمية\nكما هو حال معظم المدن القديمة، هنالك عدة نظريات حول اسم المدينة حيث ذكرت في الكثير من المخطوطات والوثائق التاريخية القديمة؛ وقد ورد ذكر حلب في رُقم مملكة إبلا باسم أرمان في عهد ريموش بن سرجون الأكدي في الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد.\nبينما يرى البعض أنها وردت باسم آران على مسلة نارام سين في ديار بكر والتي تعود للألف الثالث قبل الميلاد وسميت باسم هليا في مخلفات مملكة ماري (تل الحريري) ودعيت حلبو عندما كانت عاصمة لمملكة يمحاض الأمورية في حوالي 1800 قبل الميلاد بينما أطلقت عليها الكتابات الآشورية خلابا وخلوان.\nوذكرت حلب منذ القرن السادس عشر قبل الميلاد باسم خرب في الآثار المصرية. وقد ورد اسم خلبو في إحدى النصوص التي تعود إلى زمن رمسيس الثاني، بينما أظهر نص آخر يعود إلى ذات العهد لفظ حلبو حيث خسر ملكها أمام رمسيس الثاني نتيجة لتدخله لصالح ملوك الحيثيون على المصريين في معركة قادش.بينما عرفت المدينة باسم بيروا Beroe إبان قيام دولة السلوقيين عقب انقسام إمبراطورية الإسكندر المقدوني. بينما يعتقد آخرون أن سلوقس الأول نيكاتور مؤسس الحكم السلوقي أطلق على المدينة عام 312 قبل الميلاد اسم Bereoa بيروا وتلفظ بالفرنسية بيريه BERE، على اسم مسقط رأس فيليب الثاني المقدوني والد الإسكندر المقدوني، وبقيت حلب تحمل هذا الاسم طيلة العصور اليونانية والرومانية والبيزنطية.اختلفت وجهات النظر حول اسم حلب ذاته حيث أن البعض عزا الاسم إلى تعريب كلمة حلبا السريانية التي تعني البيضاء فقيل حلب. وقال البعض الآخر بأن لفظة حلب آرامية وأن الآشوريين والمصريين الأقدمين سموها حلبو. بينما ذكر أحد مؤرخي المدينة وهو خير الدين الأسدي أن أصل كلمة حلب يعود إلى حَلْ رب فيقال حَلْ لَب حيث أن معنى كلمة حَلْ هو المحل وكلمة لَبْ هو التجمع فيصبح معنى كلمة حلب هو موضع التجمع. وقد ذكرت المدينة أيضاً باسم آرام صوبا حيث ورد هذا الاسم في سِفر الملوك الثاني من كتاب العهد القديم. أما لفظة الشهباء ففسرها البعض بأنها من الشهب وهو البياض يتخلله السواد، حيث لقبت بهذا اللقب لبياض تربتها وحجارتها. ويرجح آخرون بأن أصل كلمة الشهباء يعود إلى بقرة شهباء قيل أن النبي إبراهيم كان يحلبها فقيل حلب الشهباء، وقد قوبل هذا الطرح بالعديد من الانتقادات من المؤرخين الذين اعتبروه محض أسطورة تنافي العلم والمنطق. بالنسبة للاسم في اللغات الأجنبية، يتم استخدام كلٍ من Alep وAleppo دون تمييز رغم أن Aleppo هي عبارة عن نسخةٍ إيطالية من الاسم في الأساس.\n\nالتاريخ\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nنادراً ما تم التطرق إلى حلب من قبل علماء الآثار، حيث أن المدينة الحديثة تحتل ذات الموقع الذي كانت تحتله المدينة القديمة، وقد أظهرت الحفريات في تل السودا أن المدينة احتلت هذا الموقع منذ حوالي الـ 5000 سنة.\n\nعصر البرونز\nوصفت حلب في السجلات التاريخية كمدينة هامة في وقت متاخر مقارنة بدمشق، والتي سبقتها ببضعة الاف من السنين فقط .. وتكتسب مدينة  حلب العريقة اهميتها التاريخية بكونها ثاني اقدم المدن السورية بعد مدينة دمشق حيث أن حلب ذكرت للمرة الأولى في الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، عندما كانت عاصمة مملكة مستقلة مرتبطة بإبلا هي مملكة أرمان أو أرمي كما سميت في إبلا وأرماني كما سميت من قبل الأكديين. حيث يصف عالم الآثار جوفاني بيتيناتو مملكة أرمان بأنها كانت تشبه مملكة إبلا في النرجسية. قام نارام سين الأكادي بتدمير كلتا المملكتين إبلا وأرمان في القرن الثالث وعشرين قبل الميلاد.\n\nالعصر البرونزي المتوسط\nفي فترة الدولة البابلية القديمة، ظهرت تسمية حلبا لأول مرة. وكانت وقتها عاصمةً لسلالة العموريين لمملكة يمحاض (حوالي 1800-1600 قبل الميلاد) والمعروفة أيضاً باسم أرض حلب كانت الأقوى في الشرق الأدنى آنذاك. دمرت على أيدي الحثيين تحت قيادة مرسيليس الأول في القرن الـ 16 قبل الميلاد. ومع ذلك، ما لبثت حلب أن استعادت دورها الريادي في سوريا بعدما خفّت القوة الحيثيون في المنطقة نتيجة للصراعات الداخلية.\n\nالعصر البرونزي المتأخر\nقام الملك الميتاني بارشطار ملك إحدى الممالك الحورية باستغلال فراغ السلطة الناجم عن ضعف الحثيين وغزا حلب في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، لتجد حلب نفسها على خط المواجهة ما بين مملكة الميتانيين والحيثيين ومصر. واستعاد الملك الحثي سابيليوليوما الأول حلب من بين أيدي الميتانيين في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، فقد كان لحلب أهمية مقدسة لدى الحيثيون وغدت مركز عبادة إله العاصفة المقدس.\n\nالعصر الحديدي\nعندما انهارت مملكة الحيثيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، أصبحت حلب جزءاً من مملكة أرفاد الآرامية السور-حيثية (والمعروفة أيضاً باسم بيت اغوشي والتي تعرف في هذه الأيام بتل رفعت) في بداية الألفية الأولى قبل الميلاد. كما وأصبحت عاصمة في نهايات القرن 9 قبل الميلاد. أصبحت حلب قسماً من الإمبراطورية الآشورية الثانية، قبل أن تسقط في يد المملكة البابلية الثانية، والإمبراطورية الأخمينيية الفارسية.\n\nالعهد الهيليني والروماني والفارسي\nاستولى الإسكندر المقدوني على المدينة عام 333 ق.م، وأقام سلوقس الأول مستعمرةً هيلينية في المدينة بين 301-286 قبل الميلاد، وسماها بيرويا على اسم مدينة بيرويا في مقدونيا.\nاستمرت بيرويا تحت حكم السلوقيين مدة 300 عام حتى سلمها آخر سلالتهم للقائد بومبيوس الكبير عام 64 قبل الميلاد، وأصبحت بذلك جزءاً من مقاطعة سوريا الرومانية. ظلت المدينة تحت الحكم الروماني ثلاثة قرونٍ أخرى، رغم أن روما لم تفرض عليها أسلوب الإدارة الرومانية نظراً لأنها مقاطعة إغريقية قديمة يتكلم سكانها اللغة اليونانية. كانت حلب وقتها أو بيرويا المدينة الثانية من حيث الأهمية في سوريا بعد أنطاكية في القرن 6. وتحفل المنطقة بالعديد من اللقى الأثرية والأديرة والكنائس لعل أشهرها دير مار سمعان العمودي أو سان سيمون، و‌ضريح مار مارون حيث يوجد قبر مؤسس الطائفة القديس مارون في منطقة براد غرب حلب. ذكرت بيرويا أيضاً مرتين في العهد القديم في السفر 13:3.\nسقطت حلب أيضاً في يد الإمبراطورية الساسانية عندما غزت سوريا في بدايات القرن السابع.\n\nعهد الفتح الإسلامي\nفتحت مدينة حلب بقيادة أبو عبيدة بن الجراح وخالد بن الوليد عام 637 ميلادي، لتشكل جزءاً من دولة الخلافة الراشدة ثم الأموية ومن بعدها العباسية. وفي عام 944 غدت عاصمة الدولة الحمدانية تحت حكم سيف الدولة الحمداني، عاشت المدينة عصراً ذهبياً أيام الأمير سيف الدولة وكانت أحد الثغور الهامة للدفاع عن العالم الإسلامي في وجه المد البيزنطي، احتلت المدينة لفترة قصيرة بين عامي 974 و987، أثناء الصراع البيزنطي السلجوقي، تمت محاصرة حلب أيضاً مرتين أثناء الحروب الصليبية عامي 1098 و1124 إلا أن الجيوش الصليبية لم تتمكن من احتلالها لمناعة تحصينها.\nفي 9 آب عام 1138، تعرضت المدينة لزلزال مدمرٍ دمرها والمناطق المحيطة، ويصنف على أنه الزلزال الخامس من بين الزلازل التاريخية الأشد دماراً في العصور القديمة.\n\nعهد الغزو المغولي والدفاع الأيوبي\nانضوت المدينة تحت حكم صلاح الدين في عهد الدولة الأيوبية منذ عام 1183.في 24 كانون الثاني لعام 1260، تم احتلال المدينة من قبل المغول تحت قيادة هولاكو  بالتعاون مع حاكم أنطاكية بوهيموند السادس، دافعت عن المدينة حامية متواضعة من قبل الملك الأيوبي غياث الدين طوران شاه وسقطت المدينة بعد 6 أيامٍ من القصف المستمر بالمنجنيقات، وسقطت القلعة بعدها بأربعة أسابيع، تم ذبح السكان بوحشية. إلا أن الملك طوران شاه لم يذبح وأبدي له احترام لبسالته على غير عادة المغول. وتابع بعدها الجيش المغولي تقدمه نحو دمشق ليحاصرها ويقتحمها هي الأخرى في 1 آذار عام 1260.\nاستعاد المملوكيون زمام المبادرة بعد انتصارهم في موقعة عين جالوت في 3 أيلول / سبتمبر عام 1260 بقيادة الملك المظفر سيف الدين قطز وتم قتل القائد النسطوري كتبغا الموالي لهولاكو واستعادة دمشق بعدها بخمسة أيام وحلب بعدها بشهر.\nاستقلت حلب عن الدولة المملوكية المركزية في القاهرة عندما قام الملك الظاهر بيبرس المملوكي بإعلان الانفصال، وأرسل قواته في خريف عام 1261 لاستعادة المدينة. في تشرين الأول لعام 1271 هاجم المغول مرةً أخرى حلب بجيشٍ يضم عشرة آلاف فارس قادمين من الأناضول بعد هزيمتهم للتركمان الذين حاولوا المساعدة في حماية المدينة، ونجحوا في احتلالها وتقدموا نحو حماة، لكن الظاهر بيبرس أعد جيشاً قويا تمكن من إجبار المغول على الجلاء عن حلب مرة أخرى.\nاستولى المغول مجدداً على المدينة في 20 تشرين الأول 1280، وعاثوا فيها فساداً وتدميراً في الجوامع والأسواق، وهرب السكان نحو دمشق، ليقوم القائد المملوكي المنصور سيف الدين قلاوون بتجهيز قواته للرد، وما إن رأى المغول الجحافل تتقدم حتى تراجعوا هرباً إلى ما بعد نهر الفرات.\nعادت حلب للحكم الذاتي إذاً عام 1317. وفي عام 1400 قام القائد المغولي تيمورلنك بأسر المدينة  وذبح الكثير من السكان ويقال بأنه أمر ببناء تلة من جماجم السكان استخدم فيها عشرين ألف جمجمة ، وبعد تراجع المغوليين، عاد السكان المسلمون خاصةً ليحتموا في المدينة، أما المسيحيون فقد قام بعضهم ممن لم يستطيعوا الدخول مرة أخرى بإنشاء حي جديد عام 1420 خارج حدود السور الشمالي تم تسميته بالحي الجديد أو الجديدة. ولعبوا دور همزة الوصل في التجارة بين تجار حلب والمحيط الخارجي لتمتعهم بحماية نسبية من قبل الممالك الصليبية في القدس وأنطاكية.\n\nالفترة العثمانية\nأضحت حلب جزءاً من الدولة العثمانية عام 1516، وكان تعداد السكان في نفس الفترة حوالي 50000 نسمة، وكانت مركز ولاية حلب وعاصمة سوريا.\nنظراً لموقعها الاستراتيجي القريب من الأناضول، لعبت حلب دوراً محورياً في الدولة العثمانية، وكانت المدينة الثانية بعد القسطنطينية، والمدينة الرئيسية للتجارة بين بلاد الشرق والغرب. وإذا كانت السفارات الغربية واقعة في إسطنبول، فإنّ المهام القنصلية الرئيسية كانت تتم في حلب، وابتداءً من القرن الثامن عشر بشكل خاص بدأ القناصل والتجار الأوروبيون يتمنون السكن في حلب مع عائلاتهم مؤسسين بذلك سلالات راسخة. لكن الاقتصاد في المدينة تأثر بشدة بعد افتتاح قناة السويس عام 1869، حيث انتعشت دمشق اقتصادياً وعادت لها أهميتها الحيوية كمركز العاصمة السورية مرة أخرى بعد أفول نجمها كما في أيام الأمويين والأيوبيين.\n\nمن الشواهد على ذيوع صيت حلب في تلك الفترة ذكرها مرتين في قصص السير وليم شكسبير عام 1606 في قصة ماكبث. اسشتهاد آخر نراه في قصة عطيل.\n\nاستمرت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني حتى انهيار الإمبراطورية. مع نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى، حددت معاهدة سيفر مقاطعة حلب كجزء من سوريا، بينما تم وعد الأرمن بتحقيق استقلال هضبة أرمينيا من قبل فرنسا في المعاهدة الفرنسية الأرمنية المبرمة عام 1916، لكن مصطفى كمال أتاتورك رفض هذه المعاهدة واستمر بضم حلب والأناضول وأرمينيا إلى تركيا وخاض حروباً لاستقلال التراب التركي، وقد دعم السكان العرب والأكراد في المدينة النضال التركي بدايةً ضد الفرنسيين باعتقادهم أنه سيجلب لهم الاستقلال، ومن أشهرهم إبراهيم هنانو الذي قام بالتنسيق في فترة من الفترات مع كمال أتاتورك، لكن النهاية جاءت كارثية على حلب؛ فمع عقد معاهدة لوزان تم انتزاع معظم مقاطعة حلب باستثناء حلب نفسها ولواء الإسكندرونة، وهكذا تم سلخ حلب عن الأناضول ومدنه التي كانت تضمها علاقات تجارية مكثفة. الأسوأ من ذلك كان معاهدة سايكس - بيكو التي قسمت بلاد الشام وفصلتها عن العراق. وزادت عزلة حلب أكثر بعد أن تم أيضاً سلخ لواء الإسكندرونة عام 1939، فتم حرمان حلب من مينائها الرئيسي ليجعلها معزولة تماماً.\n\nمرحلة الانتداب الفرنسي\nقامت ولاية حلب بعد إعلان الجنرال الفرنسي هنري غورو في أيلول عام 1920 الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا والذي قسم البلد لدويلات لتسهيل التحكم بها بغرض تأديب السوريين على تصديهم لفرنسا في معركة ميسلون. كان هدف غورو تعزيز التنافس التجاري بين كل من حلب ودمشق آملا أن ينقلب إلى انقسامٍ سياسي على مبدأ فرق تسد الاستعماري، فقام بدعم الامتيازات الاقتصادية في حلب ليزعج الدمشقيين وأعلن دمشق عاصمة ليستفز الحلبيين، كان هدف غورو إغراء حلب بالامتيازات الاقتصادية لجعلها ترفض أي فكرةٍ للوحدة مع دمشق التي تم إفقارها نسبياً.\nلكن محدودية الموارد في سوريا وترابط علاقات مدنها الاقتصادية وقتها جعلت الحكومة الفرنسية غير قادرة على استخدام فكرة الولايات المنفصلة لأنها هددت بحصول رد فعل عكسي في الولايات الفقيرة لتنادي بالوحدة مرةً أخرى، وقامت فرنسا حينها باقتراح قيام فيدرالية ولايات سوريا عام 1923 (بما فيها ولاية لبنان)، ليتم في النهاية ضم ولاياتٍ ثلاث، ولاية حلب ودمشق واللاذقية، تم تحديد حلب كعاصمةٍ في البداية، ثم ما لبثت أن أعيدت دمشق عاصمة؛ وكان رئيس الفيدرالية هو السيد صبحي بركات من مواليد مدينة حلب.\nتم إيقاف العمل بالفيدرالية عام 1924 عندما قامت فرنسا، ولنفس أسباب التفرقة، بفصل حلب ودمشق في ولاية وجعل ولاية اللاذقية ولاية منفصلةً للعلويين بعد أن استشعر الفرنسيون خطر نزعة استقلالية بعد فترةٍ من اتحاد الولايات الثلاث.\nوبعد هذا بقليل في عام 1925 قامت في السويداء جبل الدروز الثورة السورية الكبرى بقيادة سلطان باشا الأطرش؛ أرادت فرنسا الرد على السوريين فأوعزت إلى البرلمان الحلبي (وكان جلّ أعضائه من الموالين لها) بالانعقاد وإعلان الانفصال عن دمشق. ولكن الوطنيين في حلب بقيادة إبراهيم هنانو ثاروا بقوة وأحبطوا المشروع الفرنسي بعد أن أقاموا الاحتجاجات والتظاهرات وقاموا بقطع الطرق المؤدية إلى البرلمان يوم التصويت لمنع أعضائه من الوصول والتصويت على قرارهم المتوقع. وفي عام 1930 كانت حلب جزءاً من الجمهورية السورية، في عام 1936 تم توقيع معاهدة الاستقلال مع فرنسا وقيام حكومة الملك فيصل، ونالت حلب استقلالها كجزء من سوريا مجدداً في عام 1946 بعد أن قامت حكومة فيشي الفرنسية بنقض المعاهدة السابقة وإعادة احتلال سوريا عام 1941.\n\nما بعد الاستقلال\nشاركت حلب بقوة في الحياة السياسية ما بعد الاستقلال، فكان أول رئيس حكومة وطنية من حلب وهو سعد الله الجابري، وبعد فترة تبعه ناظم القدسي و‌معروف الدواليبي، وكان محمد ناجي عطري أخر رئيس حكومة من مدينة حلب. والحلبي الوحيد الذي وصل إلى منصب رئيس الجمهورية هو أمين الحافظ بدعم من حزب البعث في 27 تموز / يوليو 1963. كما نشأت في حلب عدة حركات مثلاً حزب الشعب عام 1948 بقيادة رشدي الكيخيا و‌ناظم القدسي والذي اتخذ من مدينة حلب مقراً رئيساً له. كما تأسست فيها حركة الإخوان المسلمين في سوريا في عام 1937،\nعانت المدينة من نزاع مسلح بين حركة الإخوان المسلمين والحكومة السورية بين عامي 1979 و‌1982، ويعتقد بأنها ثاني مدينة سقط فيها قتلى ضمن هذا النزاع بعد حماة.\n\nالثورة السورية 2011-2024\nشهدت المدينة عدداً من الأحداث بعدَ اندلاع حركة الاحتجاجات السورية 2011، فقد خرجت أول مظاهرة مناهضة لنظام الأسد وحزب البعث فيها في «جمعة العزة» بتاريخ 25 مارس 2011، ثمَّ أصبحت المظاهرات فيها حدثاً شبه أسبوعيّ أو حتى يومي، وأخذت بالتوسع شيئاً فشيئاً، ولو أنها لم تصل إلى قوة حركة الاحتجاجات في باقي مناطق سوريا. في تاريخ 30 يونيو 2011 أطلقت تنسيقيات الاحتجاجات عُنوان «بركان حلب» على يوم الخميس ذاك في مُحاولة لتأجيج المُظاهرات في المدينة أكثر، وأدى ذلك إلى خروج المظاهرات في أكثر من عشرة مناطق في المدينة وحُدوث محاولات للاعتصام في ساحة سعد الله الجابري الرئيسية بها، كما سقط قتيل خلال تلك المسيرات.\n\nفي 12 أغسطس 2011 خرجت مظاهرات ضخمة في المدينة هي الأولى من نوعها تحت شعار «جمعة لن نركع إلا لله»، وبسبب هذا أطلق الأمن النار على المُحتجين فسقطَ 3 قتلى في حيّ الصاخور، وأدى ذلك إلى تأجيج المظاهرات به أكثر وأكثر. وفي تاريخ 17 أغسطس 2011 تكرَّرت محاولات مُشابهة لتحريك المدينة بعدَ إطلاق شعار «أربعاء بدر حلب» على ذلك اليوم، وأدى ذلك إلى خروج مظاهرات ضخمة مشابهة للتي خرجت يوم بركان حلب ووصل خلالها الثوار إلى ساحة سعد الله الجابري في قلب المدينة،  وفي يوم الثلاثاء 6 سبتمبر خرجت مظاهرة كبيرة ضد النظام من الجامع الأموي وذلك في تشييع مفتي حلب إبراهيم السلقيني الذي كان قد توفي قبلها بيوم، ويَقول معارضون للنظام أن المخابرات السورية هي التي قتلته، وذلك إثر موقفه المؤيد للثورة السورية.\nومنذ بداية عام 2012 أصبحت المظاهرات السلمية ضد النظام حاشدة ويومية في حلب وتركزت في عدة أحياء مثل صلاح الدين والسكري وبستان القصر و‌الجامعة وغيرها، وكان يسقط عشرات القتلى من جمعة إلى جمعة في هذه المظاهرات، في 20 يوليو 2012 اندلعت اشتباكات مسلحة عنيفة داخل المدينة بين الجيش السوري الحر وقوات النظام في ما عرف لاحقا بمعركة حلب، ومن ثم بدأ الجيش السوري قصفه العنيف على أحياء في المدينة، وقد أدى هذا القصف لمقتل أكثر من 4000 شخص بعد أشهر من المعارك معظمهم مدنيون  كما ذكرت الأمم المتحدة ان أكثر من 200 الف شخص فروا من حلب منذ بدء المعارك فيها.\nآخر تقييم لمنظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة (اليونسكو) لحجم الأضرار في المواقع الأثرية في مدينة حلب القديمة بين أن ثلث المدينة تم تدميره بالكامل  خلال سنوات الحرب في سوريا وأضافت أن 60% من مدينة حلب القديمة قد تضرر بشكل كبير و30% تم تدميره كليا.\n\nمعركة حلب 2024\nفي يوم 29 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني، دخلت قوات المعارضة أحياء الحمدانية وحلب الجديدة في مدينة حلب بعد تنفيذ هجوم انتحاري مزدوج بسيارتين مفخختين. وفي النصف الثاني من اليوم، سيطرت قوات المعارضة على خمسة أحياء من مدينة حلب، وهي الحمدانية، حلب الجديدة، الجميلية، وصلاح الدين. ووردت تقارير عن اشتباكات في مناطق أخرى من المدينة، بما في ذلك وسطها. كما استولت قوات المعارضة على 20 بلدة وقرية أخرى، من بينها مدينة سراقب الاستراتيجية وسط انهيار خطوط دفاع القوات المسلحة السورية. وشملت القرى والبلدات التي استولت عليها قوات المعارضة: خان السبل، الطليحية، الترنبة، وجوباس في ريف إدلب، وخان طومان، شغيدلة، خَلْصَة، الحاضر، القراصي، بَرْنة، العيس، تلحدية، زيتان، المنصورة، والبوابية في ريف حلب.\nبحلول نهاية يوم 29 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، سيطرت قوات المعارضة على أجزاء من أحياء السكري، الفرقان، الأعظمية، وسيف الدولة في مدينة حلب، وسيطرت على الساحة الرئيسية في وسط المدينة.\nفي الساعات الأولى من يوم 30 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، استولت قوات المعارضة على قلعة حلب ومقر المحافظ في المدينة، وأعلنت السيطرة على \"أكثر من نصف مدينة حلب\". بحلول الصباح، سيطرت قوات المعارضة على معظم مدينة حلب، مما أجبر القوات المسلحة السورية على الانسحاب نحو السفيرة.\n\nالمناخ\nيمكن اعتبار المناخ في حلب مناخاً شبه قاري، نظراً لأن سلسلة الجبال المحاذية للبحر الأبيض المتوسط الشاملة جبال اللاذقية وجبال الأمانوس تقوم بحجب تأثيرات المناخ المتوسطي على المدينة. معدل درجات الحرارة يتراوح بين 18-20 درجة مئوية، ومتوسط هطول الأمطار حوالي 385 ملم. 80% من الأمطار تحصل بين شهري تشرين الأول و‌آذار. من النادر تساقط الثلوج وإن كانت المدينة تشهدها كل بضع سنوات. ومتوسط درجة الرطوبة حوالي 58%.\n\nالديموغرافيا السكانية\nتعداد السكان تاريخياً\nحسب المؤرخ شيخ كامل الغزي، فإن تعداد حلب بلغ حوالي 400,000 نسمة قبل زلزلة حلب الكبرى. والذي تبعه انتشار موجة من الطاعون والكوليرا في أعوام 1823 و1827. أدت هذه الكوارث إلى انخفاض عدد السكان بشكل حاد ليصل 110,000 في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر  في عام 1901، بلغ التعداد الكلي لمدينة حلب 108,143 نسمة شكل المسلمون منهم 76,329 نسمة بنسبة (70.58%)، بينما شكل المسيحيون 24,508 نسمة (22.66%)، واليهود نسبة 7,306 (6.76%).\n\nالنازحون الأرمن لمدينة حلب\nإلا أن تعداد سكان المدينة عاد ليزداد بعد استقبالها للنازحين الأرمن في بدايات القرن العشرين (1915–1922). وصل التعداد السكاني للمدينة عام 1922 إلى 156,748 شكل المسلمون منهم 97,600 (62.26%)، المسيحيون 22,117 (14.11%)، اليهود 6,580 (4.20%)، الأرمن 20,007 (12.76%)، وجنسيات أخرى 7,792 (4.97%).جاءت الموجة الثانية للنازحين الأرمن مع انسحاب القوات الفرنسية من كيليكية عام 1923.، وذلك بعد وصول أكثر من 40,000 ألف لاجئ أرمني بين 1923-1925، ووصل التعداد الكلي للمدينة إلى 210,000 نسمة مع نهاية عام 1925 وشكل الأرمن ربع السكان.\nوفقاً للمعطيات التاريخية المقدمة من قبل شيخ كامل الغزي، فإن الغالبية من مسيحيي المدينة كانوا من الكاثوليك حتى نهايات فترة الحكم العثماني. إن ازدياد أعداد المسيحيين الأورثودوكس ارتبطت بقدوم النازحين الأرمن من أرمينيا ومرتفعات تركيا الجنوبية، ومن الناحية الأخرى لتدفق أعداد من النازحين الأورثودوكس عند تهجيرهم من لواء الآسكندرونة عندما تم إلحاق سنجق الإسكندرونة عام 1939 بتركيا.في عام 1944، كان تعداد السكان حوالي 325,000، شكل المسيحيون منهم حوالي 112,110 (34.5%) نصفهم من الأرمن 60,200.\nكانت مدينة حلب تضم تعدادا هاما من اليهود أيضاً في العصور القديمة. وبها معبد يهودي بني في القرن الخامس الميلادي. كانت أحياء اليهود التقليدية تشمل أحياء الجميلية، باب النصر، والمناطق المجاورة للمعبد.\nثم بدأت موجات هجرة اليهود نحو فلسطين تظهر بعد إعلان قيام دولة إسرائيل من طرف واحد من قبل المهاجرين اليهود الأوروبيين ومع تواطؤ كل من بريطانيا والولايات المتحدة الأمريكية.\nعام 1968، كان لا يزال يقطن مدينة حلب أكثر من 700 يهودي على الأقل \nحاولت الحكومة السورية بداية الحفاظ على الرعايا اليهود؛ فمثلاً وحتى يومنا هذا، ظلت أملاك اليهود غير مسكونة حتى بعد هجرتهم، إذ تركت الحكومة السورية حجوزاتها على المساكن شريطة أن لا يهاجر الرعايا اليهود السوريون إلى الأراضي التي احتلها الكيان الإسرائيلي. إلا أن معظم اليهود قد هاجروا بدايةً إلى الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، ليشكلوا جالية معتبرة في بروكلين - نيويورك بشكل أساسي، أما البقية فقد غادروها في النهاية وتوجهوا إلى إسرائيل.\n\nالوضع الديموغرافي الحالي وتناغم السكان\nالمدينة حالياً هي الأكثر كثافةً سكانياً في القطر، مع تعداد وصل حتى 2,181,061 نسمة وفق أرقام مسح عام 2004. وفي أواخر العام 2005 أعلن مجلس المدينة وصول التعداد إلى 2,301,570 مليون نسمة.\nغالبية سكان حلب هم العرب وأقلية من الأكراد و‌الأرمن والشركس والتركمان وغيرهم، وتتجانس فيها الإثنيات والأديان منذ القدم لتتمتع المدينة بالتنوع والمشاركة والتعاون بين كافة الأعراق والطوائف من السكان بشكل رائع وجميل يعتبر مضرباً للمثل في الشرق الأوسط.\nتقريبا 85% من سكان حلب هم من المسلمين السنة العرب، وسكان حلب من الديانة المسيحية هم التجمع الثاني من حيث الحجم بعد مدينة بيروت (بين 10% و15%) في المنطقة، وتحتضن بين جنباتها حوالي 45 كنيسة أو مبنى كنسي تنتمي للطوائف المتنوعة فهناك السريان واللاتين والموارنة والكاثوليك والأرثوذكس والكلدانيين يتعايشون جميعاً في جو من الود والإخاء. كانت حلب أيضًا موطنًا لإحدى أغنى المجتمعات المسيحية الشرقية وأكثرها تنوعًا في الشرق، تاريخياً قطن المسيحيون في أحياء معروفة مثل الجديدة والعزيزية والسليمانية، محطة بغداد، العروبة والميدان. وإن بدؤوا بالانتشار خارج هذه الأحياء التقليدية مع ازدياد عدد السكان وظهور الأحياء السكنية الحديثة. قبل الحرب الأهلية السورية كانت مدينة حلب ثالث مدينة في الشرق الأوسط بعد القاهرة وبيروت من حيث عدد المسيحيين،  حيث ضمت المدينة قبل الحرب الأهلية السورية بين 160,000 إلى 250,000 مسيحي.\nيتميز أهل حلب بلهجتهم المحلية المميزة والتي تستعير كثيراً من الكلمات من اللغة التركية نظراً لقرب المسافة الجغرافية.\n\nالديانة\nالإسلام\nأكثر من 80% من سكان حلب هم من المسلمين السُنّة، وهم أساساً من العرب، ويليهم كل من التركمان والأكراد. تشمل الجماعات الإسلامية الأخرى أعدادًا صغيرة من الشركس والشيشانيين والألبان والبوشناق واليونانيين والبلغار.\nالمناطق الشمالية الغربية من حلب، ولا سيما حي الشيخ مقصود، يقطنها الأكراد بشكل رئيسي. منذ بداية الحرب الأهلية السورية، تتم حماية هذه المناطق من حلب بواسطة الميليشيات الكردية، وبالتالي فهي أكثر المناطق أمانًا بالمقارنة مع باقي المناطق في حلب. لم تتحدَّ قوات الحكومة المركزية أو جيوش المتمردين الجيش الكردي ولم تتعد على المناطق الكردية. العديد من غير الأكراد في حلب فروا إلى الأحياء الخاضعة للسيطرة الكردية. وشكلّ الأكراد حوالي 7% إلى 10% من سكان المدينة قبل الحرب.\n\nالمسيحية\nكانت حلب أيضًا موطنًا لإحدى أغنى المجتمعات المسيحية الشرقية وأكثرها تنوعًا في الشرق. وتاريخياً خصوصًا خلال الحكم العثماني عمل المسيحيون في التجارة وأقاموا في أحياء خاصة فيهم أبرزها الجديّدة، وشيّدت في الحي ذاته بيوت فخمة تدل على ثراء ورفاهية أصحابها، فضلًا عن مختلف المرافق التي تتيح لهذا الحيّ أن يعيش حياته المستقلة منها حمامات عامة مثل حمام برهم. في تلك الحقبة كان مسيحيو حلب أكثر ثراءً من المسلمين. كانت الطوائف الأرثوذكسية وغيرها من الطوائف المسيحية تزداد ثروة وثقافة ونفوذًا طوال القرن الثامن عشر. فالحماية الأجنبية لم تمنحها امتيازات سياسية فحسب، بل وفرت لأبنائها أيضًا، وهم العاملون بالتجارة مع أوروبا في ذلك الحين، منافع تجارية ومالية. وقد اغتنى، بنوع خاص، اليونانيون والأرمن والمسيحيون السوريون الناطقون بالضاد، فارتفع مع هذا الغنى مستواهم الثقافي واشتد شعورهم الطائفي. خلال القرن الثامن عشر ازدهرت الحياة الثقافية وقام في حلب نخبة من الأدباء والمفكّرين المسيحيين كان لهم دور في النهضة العربية الحديثة. وقام المسيحيون بدور كبير في عهد الانتداب وكانوا العمود الفقري لأهم الدوائر والمؤسسات ولمعوا في المهن الحرّة كالطب والمحاماة والهندسة كما تابعوا نشاطهم التجاري التقليدي متأقلمين مع الأوضاع الجديدة. وظلّت الطبقة العاملة تتقن المهن التقليدية كالبناء، والنسيج وعملوا على إدخال التصنيع الحديث. ونبغ خاصة الأرمن في الصناعات الميكانيكية ومن «مهاجرين» أصبحوا أرباب عمل ونخبة ثريّة. وساهم المسيحيون في الحياة السياسية كنوّاب ووزراء وعملوا مع إخوانهم المسلمين للحصول على الاستقلال التام. كانت الغالبية من مسيحيي المدينة من الكاثوليك حتى نهايات فترة الحكم العثماني، وقد ارتبط ازدياد أعداد المسيحيين الأرثوذكس المشرقيين بقدوم النازحين الأرمن والسريان من قيليقية وطور عبدين في تركيا هربًا من الإبادة الجماعية الأرمنية والسريانية، ومن الناحية الأخرى لتدفق أعداد من النازحين الأرثوذكس العرب (روم أنطاكيون) عند تهجيرهم من لواء الاسكندرون عندما تم إلحاق سنجق الإسكندرونة عام 1939 بتركيا. في عام 1944، كان تعداد السكان حوالي 325,000 نسمة وشكّل المسيحيون حوالي 112,110 (34.5%) وكان نصفهم من الأرمن أي 60,200 نسمة.\nقبل الحرب الأهلية السورية كانت مدينة حلب ثالث مدينة في الشرق الأوسط بعد القاهرة وبيروت من حيث عدد المسيحيين،  حيث ضمت المدينة قبل الحرب الأهلية السورية بين 160,000 إلى 250,000 مسيحي. مع تواجد للعديد من الطوائف المسيحية الشرقية، وخاصةً من الأرمن والسريان. تاريخياً كانت المدينة المركز الرئيسي للمبشرين الكاثوليك الفرنسيين في سوريا. وكان عدد سكان حلب المسيحيين أكثر بقليل من 250,000 نسمة قبل الحرب الأهلية السورية، وهو ما يمثل حوالي 12% من إجمالي سكان المدينة. ومع ذلك، نتيجة للحرب الأهلية السورية، انخفض عدد السكان المسيحيين في المدينة إلى أقل من 100,000 اعتبارًا من بداية عام 2017، وكان منهم حوالي 30% من الإثنية الأرمنية. ويتحدث عدد كبير من السريان في حلب اللغة السريانية، وينحدرون من مدينة أورفة في تركيا، ويتبعون في الغالب الكنيسة السريانية الأرثوذكسية والكنيسة السريانية الكاثوليكية. ومع ذلك، هناك وجود كبير لأتباع بطريركية أنطاكية وسائر المشرق للروم الأرثوذكس. هناك أيضاً عدد كبير من المسيحيين الكاثوليك الشرقيين في المدينة بما في ذلك الروم الملكيين والموارنة والكلدان وأتباع الطقوس اللاتينية. المسيحيون البروتستانت من مختلف الطوائف هم أقلية في المدينة.\nتتمتع العديد من أحياء المدينة بأغلبية مسيحية وأرمنية، مثل الحي المسيحي القديم في الجديدة. وتعمل حوالي 50 كنيسة في المدينة والتي تديرها مختلف الطوائف المسيحية. ومع ذلك، وفقًا لنائب رئيس لجنة اليونسكو التابعة للاتحاد الروسي ألكساندر دزاسوخوف، عانت حوالي 20 كنيسة من الدمار الشديد خلال المعارك في حلب،  وأبرزها الوطنية الكنيسة الإنجيلية، وكذلك الكنائس التاريخية المحيطة بحي الجديدة. وفي 25 ديسمبر من عام 2016، بعد انتصار الحكومة، تم الاحتفال بعيد الميلاد علانية في حلب لأول مرة منذ أربع سنوات.\n\nاليهودية\nكانت المدينة موطناً لعدد كبير من السكان اليهود منذ العصور القديمة. وتم بناء الكنيس العظيم في القرن الخامس، وضم الكنيس مخطوطة حلب. عُرف يهود حلب بالتزامهم الديني والقيادة الحاخامية والليتورجية، والتي تكونت من البيزمونيم والبقشوت. بعد ظهور محاكم التفتيش الإسبانية، استقبلت مدينة حلب العديد من المهاجرين اليهود السفارديم، الذين انضموا في النهاية إلى الجالية اليهودية المحلية في حلب. كانت هناك علاقات سلمية بين اليهود والسكان المحيطين بهم. في أوائل القرن العشرين، كان يهود المدينة يعيشون بشكل رئيسي في حي الجميلية وباب الفرج والأحياء المحيطة بالكنيس الكبير. أدت الاضطرابات في فلسطين في السنوات التي سبقت قيام دولة إسرائيل في عام 1948 إلى تزايد العداء لليهود الذين يعيشون في البلدان العربية، وبلغت ذروتها في الهجرة اليهودية من الأراضي العربية. هاجم حشد عربي الحي اليهودي في ديسمبر من عام 1947 عقب قرار الأمم المتحدة بتقسيم فلسطين. وتعرضت المنازل والمدارس والمتاجر لأضرار بالغة. بعد فترة وجيزة، هاجر العديد من يهود المدينة البالغ تعدادهم ستة آلاف. وفي عام 1968 كان هناك ما يقرب من 700 يهودي لا يزالون في حلب.\nلم يتم بيع المنازل والممتلكات الأخرى للعائلات اليهودية بعد الهجرة، ولا تزال غير مأهولة تحت حماية الحكومة السورية. معظم هذه العقارات موجودة في مناطق الجميلية وباب الفرج والأحياء المحيطة بالكنيس المركزي في حلب. في عام 1992، رفعت الحكومة السورية حظر السفر على 4,500 مواطن يهودي. وسافر معظمهم إلى الولايات المتحدة، حيث يعيش عدد كبير من اليهود السوريين حاليًا في بروكلين في نيويورك. تم إجلاء آخر يهود حلب المُتبقين في المدينة، من أفراد عائلة الحلبي، في أكتوبر عام 2016 من قبل الجيش السوري الحر، وتعيش العائلة الآن في إسرائيل.\n\nالطراز المعماري\nتتميز مدينة حلب بتعدد الطرز المعمارية الموجودة فيها، إذ تجمع أنماطاً معماريةً سلجوقية وبيزنطيةً إضافةً للطرز المملوكية والعثمانية، ممن تعاقبوا عليها على مر السنين.\nيوجد في المدينة العديد من المباني القديمة العائدة للقرنين الثالث والرابع عشر ميلادي، مثل الخانات والمدارس الدينية والحمامات، إضافةً للمباني الدينية كالجوامع والكنائس.\nوظهرت في حلب في القرنين السادس والسابع عشر بيوت مملوكة للعديد من العائلات الحلبية الثرية تتميز بواجهاتها الحجرية الغاية في الجمال، في القرن ال 19 ومطلع القرن العشرين كان طراز العمارة الباروكية هو السائد، ومثاله بناء فيلا روز الشهير في منطقة العزيزية. بينما يجمع حي الشهباء الجديدة الراقي العديد من الطرز المعمارية الشرقية، والكلاسيكية الغربية وحتى الصينية\nوذلك بفضل مهارة الصناع الحلبيين في قد الصخور، خصوصاً من الحجر الأبيض الذي تشتهر به مدينة حلب.\n\nمعالم المدينة القديمة\nيوجد نسبياً انقسام واضح بين حدود المدينة القديمة والمدينة الحديثة في حلب. الجزء القديم موجودٌ ضمن جدار المدينة القديم الذي يشكل دائرةً نصف قطرها 5 كيلومترات، وله 9 بوابات. (باستثناء حي الجديدة الذي بني بعد الغزوات المغولية في القرن الخامس عشر عل الرغم أنه يعد جزءاً من المدينة القديمة) في مركز المدينة القديمة تقع قلعة حلب الضخمة على تلة مرتفعة، مشرفة بذلك على كافة أحياء المدينة القديمة. ويتوسطها مدرجٌ واسع هو مدرج القلعة الذي تقام فيه العديد من الحفلات.\n\nأبواب حلب القديمة\nأبواب حلب جزءٌ أساسي ومهم من السور، ومن ذاكرة المدينة، فقد كانت هذه الأبواب منفذ أهل حلب عبر السور المنيع الذي رد عنهم هجمات الغزاة على مر العصور، حتى أنه يمكن القول أن كل ضربة سيف أو سقطة رمح أو طلقة منجنيق، لابد أنها وقد تركت أثراً أو حفرة أو ندبة على هذه الأبواب. عدد هذه الأبواب تسعة، اندثر منها أربعة وحوفظ على خمسة منها في المدينة القديمة:\n\nباب الحديد\nباب أنطاكية\nباب النصر\nباب قنسرين\nباب الفرج\nباب المقام\nباب الجنان أو باب جنين في اللهجة الحلبية.\nباب الأحمر\nباب النيرب\n\nالحفاظ على المدينة القديمة\nباعتبارها مدينةً ذات طرازٍ معماري قديم تميزه الأسواق المسقوفة والخانات والحمامات والمدارس، إضافةً للمساجد والكنائس، فإن المدينة كنزُ أثري بحاجة للعناية والصيانة المستمرة. تمت إعادة تخطيط المدينة بشكل واضح بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية. وفي عام 1954 اعتمد مخطط معماري من قبل المعماري الفرنسي أندريه جوتون، والذي اقترح شق عددٍ من الجادات العريضة عبر المدينة لتتناسب مع دخول السيارات. بين أعوام 1954-1983 تم هدم العديد من الأحياء القديمة تحت هذه الذريعة بغرض التوسع، خصوصاً في المناطق الشمالية مثل باب الفرج وباب جنين لكن الوعي المتزايد بأهمية هذه المباني أدى في النهاية لإلغاء مخطط جوتون عام 1979 وليتم الاستعاضة عنه بتخطيط لمهندس المدن السويسري ستيفانو بيانكو، والذي أطلق فكرة المحافظة على النسيج العمراني القديم لحلب القديمة. الأمر الذي مهد الطريق لليونسكو لتضم مدينة حلب القديمة إلى التراث العالمي عام 1986.\nقام العديد من المعاهد العالمية بالتضافر مع الجهات المحلية وجمعية آثار حلب، لإعادة تأهيل المدينة القديمة بإضافة نمط حياة عصري إليها مع المحافظة على الطابع التراثي.\nتقوم هنالك شراكة بين مؤسسة ألمانيا التقنية GTZ و‌مؤسسة الآغا خان ضمن برنامج الآغا خان لحماية المدن القديمة ساهمت في كثير من الأعمال للحفاظ وتأهيل المدينة القديمة\n\nالأسواق والخانات في مدينة حلب\nمدينة حلب مدينةُ تجارية بامتياز، فقد جذب موقع المدينة الاستراتيجي على طريق الحرير العديد من السكان من كافة الأعراق والمعتقدات ليقطنوا فيها ويستفيدوا من وقوعها بين الصين وبلاد الرافدين من

مشهورة بأطباقها اللذيذة وبحب أهلها للقمة الهنيئة، ويُقال (حلب أرض المحاشي والكبب) أو كما يُقال بين السكان المحليين (حلب ام المحاشي والكبب)، لذلك ليس من المفاجئ بأن يفوز مطبخها بجائزة التذوق العالمية من قبل أكاديمية الطهي والتذوق العالمية من فرنسا عام 2007\nولكن في الحقيقة، فإن حلب كانت عاصمةً للطبخ قبل جائزة باريس بكثير، ربما يعود السبب إلى تمازج عديد من الإثنيات فيها، الأمر الذي ساعد على تعدد أنواع الأطباق، نظراً لأنها كانت جزءاً من الدولة العثمانية. فهي تحتوي على الكثير من الأصناف مثل الكباب، الكبة، اليبرق (محشي ورق العنب)، محاشي الباذنجان والكوسا، اللحمة بالكرز، السماقية، السفرجلية.\nيعتبر إفطار الفول المدمس إفطاراً تقليدياً في مدينة حلب، مضافاً إليه الزيت وعصير الليمون والفلفل الأحمر. وتعتبر الكبة أحد اختصاصات المطبخ الحلبي الأثيرة وأكثر أكلة محبوبة من قبل السكان،

والمواصلات\nالسكك الحديدية\nكانت مدينة حلب من المدن الأولى في سوريا التي تصلها خطوط النقل الحديدي، وذلك عندما قامت السلطات العثمانية ببناء سكة حديد بغداد عبر المدينة عام 1919 (ومنها أخذت محطة القطار اسمها محطة بغداد)، والتي تمتد حتى أنقرة وما تزال موجودةً حتى يومنا هذا، وتوجد أيضاً خطوط تصل ما بين حلب ودمشق ضمن خط حديد الحجاز الشهير الذي أنشئ أيضاً بدعم من الإمبراطور غليوم الألماني بغرض تسهيل نقل الحجاج إلى الحرمين الشريفين في الحجاز وحتى إسطنبول، ولهذه الأسباب التاريخية يتواجد مقر شركة الخطوط الحديدية السورية في حلب وليس في دمشق. نظراً لقدم عمر هذه الشبكات فقد تباطأت حركة الشحن والنقل للمسافرين خصوصاً نحو ميناء اللاذقية، إلا أن هذه الحركة عادت لتنشط 2005 مع استقدام قطارات الترين سيت الكورية الجنوبية لتصبح هناك رحلات منتظمة لكل من اللاذقية ودمشق كل ساعتين، مع خدمة جيدة

      "summary": "حَلَب هي مدينة في شمال سوريا وهي مركز محافظة حلب التي تعد أكبر المحافظات السورية من ناحية تعداد السكان بعدد سكان رسمي يفوق 4.045 مليون (تقديرات 2004) كما أنها تعتبر العاصمة الاقتصادية لسوريا. تقع شمال غرب سوريا على بعد 310 كم (193 ميلاً) من دمشق. كما أنها تعد أكبر مدن بلاد الشام،  وكانت عاصمة لمملكة يمحاض الأمورية، وتعاقبت عليها بعد ذلك حضاراتٌ عدة مثل الحثية و‌الآرامية و‌الآشورية و‌الفارسية و‌الهيلينية و‌الرومانية و‌البيزنطية والإسلامية. وفي العصر العباسي برزت حلب كعاصمة للدولة الحمدانية التي امتدت من حلب إلى الجزيرة الفراتية و‌الموصل. تعد حلب واحدة من أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم وثاني اقدم مدن سوريا بعد العاصمة دمشق وذلك منذ بداية الألفية السادسة قبل الميلاد، حيث أظهرت الحفريات في تل السودة وتل الأنصاري الواقعتين جنوب المدينة القديمة أن المنطقة كانت قد احتلت في الجزء الأخير من الألفية الثالثة على الأقل  ويظهر هذا في أول ذكر لحلب في الألواح المسمارية المكتشفة في مملكة إيبلا و‌بلاد الرافدين حيث لوحظ تفوقها العسكري والتجاري. مثل هذا التاريخ ربما يرجع إلى كونها نقطة تجارية إستراتيجية في منتصف الطريق بين البحر الأبيض المتوسط و‌بلاد الرافدين وفي كونها في نهاية طريق الحرير الذي يمر عبر آسيا الوسطى و‌بلاد الرافدين. وبقيت حلب لقرون أكبر المدن السورية وثالث مدينة في الدولة العثمانية بعد إسطنبول و‌القاهرة. تحولت التجارة إلى البحر عندما تم افتتاح قناة السويس عام 1869 وبدأت أهمية حلب بالتراجع بشكل بطيء. تلقت حلب أكبر الضربات عند بداية القرن العشرين، فعند سقوط الخلافة العثمانية بعد الحرب العالمية الأولى سلخت عن حلب أجزاؤها الشمالية (معظمها ضمن الأقاليم السورية الشمالية) التي ضمت إلى تركيا عام 1920 بالاتفاق بين أتاتورك و‌سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي. خسرت حلب التجارة مع مدن هذه الأقاليم خاصة المدن التي كانت تابعة لولاية حلب تاريخيا كعنتاب و‌مرعش و‌أضنة و‌مرسين، كما خسرت السكك الحديدية المهمّة التي كانت تصلها بالموصل. أدت اتفاقية سايكس بيكو وفصل العراق عن سورية إلى كساد وتدهور كبير في اقتصاد حلب. وفي عام 1940 فقدت حلب إمكانية وصولها إلى البحر بعد خسارتها لمنفذها الرئيسي على البحر الأبيض المتوسط في الإسكندرونة. تراجع موقع حلب السياسي بسبب جعل مدينة دمشق عاصمة لسوريا. رغم كل هذه الضربات، بقيت هذه المدينة عاصمة اقتصادية لسوريا، فهي تضم أهم المعامل الصناعية وهي أيضا تشكل مركزا للمناطق الزراعية في سوريا، وخاصة زراعة القطن الضرورية لمعامل النسيج المزدهرة في المدينة. كانت حلب وريفها تعطي معظم الناتج الإجمالي السوري حتى نهاية الخمسينات  أصبحت المدينة القديمة في مدينة حلب من مواقع التراث العالمي اليونسكو في عام 1986. وقد نالت المدينة لقب عاصمة الثقافة الإسلامية عن الوطن العربي في عام 2006 م. وخلال أحداث الأزمة السورية، تضررت حلب بشكل كبير إنسانيا واقتصاديا بفعل القتال والقصف ونقل المعامل إلى تركيا، وتوقفت عجلة الاقتصاد في المدينة وتعرض الكثير من معالمها الأثرية للدمار مثل مئذنة المسجد الأموي واحتراق معظم أسواق حلب القديمة.",

      "content": "Alep (en arabe : حلب / ḥalab) est une ville de Syrie, chef-lieu du gouvernorat d'Alep, le gouvernorat de Syrie le plus peuplé, situé dans le nord-ouest du pays. Pendant des siècles, Alep a été la ville la plus grande de la région syrienne et la troisième plus grande ville de l'Empire ottoman (après Constantinople et Le Caire). Avec une population de 2 132 100 habitants en 2004, Alep était la ville la plus peuplée du pays et du Levant avant l'arrivée de la guerre civile.\nSituée à l'emplacement de l'antique Bérée (en grec ancien : Βέροια / Béroia ; en latin : Berœa), Alep est une ancienne métropole, l'une des plus vieilles villes du monde à avoir été constamment habitée, étant habitée depuis le VIe millénaire av. J.-C. Son importance historique est attribuée à son emplacement stratégique en tant que centre de commerce à mi-chemin entre la mer Méditerranée et la Mésopotamie (l'Irak moderne), puis à sa situation sur la route de la soie.\nLorsque le canal de Suez a été inauguré en 1869, le commerce a été dévié vers la mer et Alep commença à décliner doucement. À la chute de l'Empire ottoman après la Première Guerre mondiale, Alep céda le nord de son arrière-pays à la Turquie moderne de la même manière que le chemin de fer Berlin-Bagdad.\nDans les années 1940, la ville a perdu son principal accès à la mer lorsqu'Antioche et Alexandrette sont rattachées à la Turquie. Ce déclin a contribué à la préservation de l'ancienne ville d'Alep, son architecture médiévale et son patrimoine traditionnel classé au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité par l'Unesco en 1986. Au cours des années 1990 et 2000, la ville montre un nouveau dynamisme et une forte croissance, mais elle subit d'importantes destructions au cours de la bataille d'Alep de 2012 à 2016.\n\nToponymie\nL'interprétation selon laquelle le nom de la ville viendrait de « halab Ibrahim » (« Abraham a trait ») (arabe : حَلَب ḥalab, traire (le lait) ou Alep) est totalement contestée sur le plan historique et linguistique.[réf. nécessaire]\nLe nom francophone Alep dérive du nom arabe prononcé Halab. Une hypothèse fait remonter ce mot à l'amorrite Halaba au deuxième millénaire av. J.-C. signifiant « blanc » en référence à la couleur de la terre et du marbre abondant dans la région. Elle a aussi pour surnom en arabe moderne ach-Chahbaa' (الشهباء), qui veut aussi dire « la blanche ».\n\nGéographie\nLa ville d'Alep est située au nord-ouest de la Syrie, au bord de la rivière Qouweiq (connue pour le massacre portant son nom), sur un plateau à 380 mètres d'altitude, à 120 km de la mer Méditerranée et à 45 km de la frontière turque.\n\nClimat\nLa situation septentrionale d'Alep en Syrie permet à la ville de bénéficier d'un climat méditerranéen, plutôt sec et avec des influences continentales se caractérisant par des étés très chauds et secs et par des hivers frais et pluvieux contrairement au sud de la Syrie, caractérisée par un climat désertique chaud.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nC'est une des plus anciennes villes habitées au monde : elle existe déjà à l'époque paléo-babylonienne (2004–1595 av. J.-C.), sous le nom de Halab. Des fouilles archéologiques à Tell as-Sawda et Tell al-Ansari, juste au sud de l'ancienne ville d'Alep, montrent que la zone était occupée par les Amorrites au moins dans la dernière partie du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. ; de plus Alep est mentionnée pour la première fois dans des tables cunéiformes exhumées à Ebla et en Mésopotamie, faisant partie de l'État amorrite de Yamkhad et connu pour ses compétences militaires et commerciales.\nEn 1595 av. J.-C., elle est prise par les Hittites et devient une grande étape pour les caravanes entre la Syrie et la Mésopotamie.\nVers l'an mille av. J.-C., Alep devient la plaque tournante du marché du savon dans le monde connu, position qu'elle garde jusqu'aux temps modernes. En 738 av. J.-C., elle est rattachée à l'Assyrie sous le nom de Halman. Elle est conquise par Alexandre le Grand en 333 av. J.-C. et passe ensuite aux Séleucides, avec Séleucos Ier qui y établit une colonie hellénistique baptisée Beroia, d'après la ville éponyme de Macédoine (et francisée en Béroé). Le Nord de la Syrie est alors en plein épanouissement économique et culturel et certaines cités, comme Beroia, jouissent d'une grande autonomie avec une boulè prenant des mesures sans contraintes au sein de l'Empire séleucide.\nElle est ensuite occupée en 88 av. J.-C. par Tigrane le Grand et entre dans le royaume d'Arménie, mais Tigrane est vaincu par les Romains et Pompée fait de la Syrie en 64 av. J.-C. une province romaine. Cela donne une certaine stabilité à la région pendant trois siècles dont Beroia profite largement. La province est administrée par un légat. L'administration et l'élite continuent à parler grec qui sert également de lingua franca dans tout le Moyen-Orient.\nLa prospérité de la période romaine implique un accroissement de population, notamment dans le Nord de la Syrie, qui se poursuit avec encore plus d'intensité sous l'ère byzantine, jusqu'à la fin du Ve siècle. Beroia est à la fin de l'Antiquité la deuxième ville de Syrie romaine après Antioche (capitale de la Syrie romaine et troisième ville de l'Empire romain). Les découvertes archéologiques apportent la preuve d'une grande densité de population et de nombreux villages dans le Nord de la Syrie entre Antioche et Beroia, jusqu'au VIe siècle. Il y avait de grands domaines agricoles, des villas romaines et de grandes églises, comme en témoignent les ruines de l'église Saint-Siméon-le-Stylite au mont Siméon. Beroia est citée dans le deuxième livre des Maccabées (13, 3) de l'Ancien Testament.\n\nPériode romaine et byzantine\nLes noms de plusieurs évêques de Beroia de la province de Syria Prima sont rapportés dans les documents écrits qui nous sont parvenus. L'un des premiers est saint Eustathe d'Antioche qui, après avoir été évêque de Beroia, est devenu patriarche d'Antioche, juste avant le premier concile de Nicée en 325. Son successeur sur le siège de Beroia est l'évêque Cyrus dont on rappelle la fidélité au symbole de Nicée qui lui vaut l'exil de la part de l'empereur Constance II. Après le concile de Séleucie en 359, convoqué par Constance, Mélèce est transféré de Sebastia à Beroia (Béroé), mais l'année suivante, il est promu au siège d'Antioche. Son successeur à Beroia est Anatolius qui assiste au concile d'Antioche en 363. Sous la persécution de l'empereur Valens, l'évêque est un certain Theodotus, ami de Basile le Grand. Acace de Béroé lui succède et reste en place pendant cinquante ans. Il participe au premier concile de Constantinople en 381 et au concile d'Éphèse de 431. Théoctiste arrive ensuite en 438. Il participe au concile de Chalcédoine en 451 et signe en 458 une supplique des évêques de la province de Syrie à l'empereur Léon le Thrace à propos du meurtre de Protérius d'Alexandrie. En 518, l'empereur Justin Ier exile l'évêque de Béroé (Beroia) Antonin pour avoir rejeté le concile de Chalcédoine. Le dernier évêque connu de ce siège est Megas, qui participe à un synode en 536, convoqué par Mennas de Constantinople. Après la conquête arabe, Béroé cesse d'être un siège ecclésiastique. C'est aujourd'hui un siège titulaire (in partibus) pour l'Église catholique.\nQuelques rares éléments architectoniques demeurent de cette période, notamment dans la citadelle d'Alep. Ses deux mosquées sont d'anciennes églises byzantines reconverties en mosquées sous les Mirdassides au XIe siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nEn 540, le roi persan sassanide Khosro Ier incendie la ville; que Justinien reprendra et rebâtira.\nElle est conquise par les Arabes commandés par Khalid ibn al-Walid en 637. La ville s'étend et de nouveaux remparts sont érigés pour intégrer l'expansion. Les musulmans bâtissent les principaux monuments de la ville : la grande mosquée, bâtie en 715 par le calife Al Walid, reconstruite en 1129 par Nur ad-Din, la Madrassé Halawiyé (école), sur l'emplacement de l'ancienne cathédrale Sainte-Hélène, la citadelle, bâtie par l'émir hamdanide Ali Sayf al-Dawla, les souks (marchés couverts), les khans (caravansérails).\nSous les Omeyyades, la ville connaît une certaine stagnation. En 944, elle devient la capitale des Hamdanides. C'est l'âge d'or d'Alep. L'émir Sayf al-Dawla en fait un prestigieux centre littéraire et le point chaud de la lutte entre les musulmans et les Byzantins. En 962, Alep est prise et incendiée par le général byzantin Nicéphore II Phocas. La ville est reprise par les Hamdanides et reconstruite mais ne recouvre pas sa splendeur. Elle passe ensuite aux Fatimides puis aux Seldjoukides. Possession du sultanat de Roum, elle est conquise en 1086 par Tutuş, émir de Damas, qui se proclame ensuite sultan seldjoukide de Syrie. À sa mort, ses émirats sont partagés entre ses deux fils, qui se détestent. Il va s'ensuivre une rivalité entre les deux émirats qui va survivre longtemps à l'extinction de la descendance de Tutuş.\nEn 1098 et 1124, Alep est assiégée par les croisés, qui échouent devant ses murs. En représailles aux exactions commises par le comte d'Édesse en 1123 dans les environs d'Alep, le cadi de la ville fait détruire le chœur de la plupart des églises et les transforme en mosquées. Lié à Mossoul qui le protège des attaques des Latins, l'émirat se retrouve dans l'empire zengide, avant de devenir le centre du pouvoir de Nur ad-Din.\nEn 1138 a lieu un des tremblements de terre les plus mortifères de l'histoire. En 1183, il revient à Saladin et à la dynastie des Ayyoubides. Alep devient alors un grand centre de vie intellectuelle et religieuse ; de nombreuses madrasas y sont élevées ; sa citadelle et ses murailles sont rebâties.\nEn 1260, Alep est prise par les Mongols avant d'être reprise par les mamelouks en 1317. Après sa prise en main par les mamelouks, ces derniers décident d'entamer une reconstruction de la cité qui retrouve sa magnificence. Dans la deuxième moitié du XIVe siècle, on rapporte que les édifices construits à Alep dépassent en beauté ceux de Damas, plusieurs institutions religieuses et éducatives sont construites ainsi que des Khans remarquables, La ville retrouve à cette période une place commerciale et artisanale majeure et devient un carrefour de circulation des biens et marchandises dans la région.\nEn 1400, le Turco-Mongol Tamerlan reprend la cité aux mamelouks. Il préside au massacre d'une grande partie de ses habitants et il ordonne qu'une tour de vingt mille crânes soit érigée à l’extérieur de la ville. Après le retrait des Mongols, la population musulmane retourne à Alep, alors que les chrétiens préfèrent s'établir dans le nouveau quartier de Jdeïdé-Salibé au cours du XVe siècle.\nLa ville renaît au XVe siècle pour devenir une grande place commerciale entre l'Orient et l'Occident, pratiquant surtout le commerce de la soie.\n\nÉpoque ottomane\nEn 1516, elle est annexée par l'Empire ottoman, qui la conserve jusqu'en 1918. Au XVIIe siècle, la ville est la troisième de l'Empire avec 120 000 habitants. Elle est la capitale du pachalik d'Alep puis du vilayet d'Alep.\nEn 1682, dans son ouvrage Théâtre de la Turquie, où sont représentées les choses les plus remarquables qui s'y passent…, le missionnaire capucin Michel Febvre décrit une ville cosmopolite où quatorze religions différentes cohabitent formant autant de nations et de langues. Parmi les non-chrétiens, il cite les Turcs, les Arabes, les Kurdes, les Druzes, les Turcomans, les Yazidis et les Juifs. Parmi les chrétiens, il cite les maronites, les grecs-orthodoxes, les Arméniens, les syriaques, les nestoriens, les coptes ; les minorités chrétiennes sont spécialisées dans la production textile ; certains font partie d'une véritable aristocratie, comme le laisse découvrir la maison Ghazaleh, splendide demeure ottomane, ayant appartenu pendant deux siècles à une riche famille chrétienne.\nÀ partir du XVIIe siècle, le déclin des voies commerciales terrestres entre l'Extrême-Orient et le Proche-Orient entraîne celui de la ville. Celle-ci reste cependant un centre économique et culturel important : en 1706, la première imprimerie du Proche-Orient est créée par le patriarche Athanase IV d'Antioche pour répandre les textes religieux chrétiens.\nLe XIXe siècle est particulièrement troublé à cause du déclin de l'Empire ottoman. Entre 1812 et 1819, la ville est occupée par les janissaires révoltés. En 1822, Alep subit des destructions à la suite d'un séisme. En 1832, la ville passe sous administration égyptienne comme toute la Syrie. Les tensions entre les communautés sont exacerbées. En 1860, a lieu un pogrom antichrétien. Au XIXe siècle, Alep joue un certain rôle dans la renaissance arabe : c'est d'Alep qu'est originaire le grand réformateur al-Kawakibi. À la fin du XIXe siècle, la ville se modernise et la périphérie se développe. De nombreux ingénieurs allemands y demeurent au début du XXe siècle pendant la construction du Bagdadbahn, ce qui attire des espions britanniques, parmi lesquels Lawrence d'Arabie, qui descendent au fameux nouvel hôtel Baron.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nEn octobre 1918, lors de la bataille d'Alep, la ville est enlevée aux Turcs par les insurgés arabes et les Britanniques d'Edmund Allenby. Elle est rattachée à la Syrie sous mandat français. Elle est l'éphémère capitale de l'État d'Alep entre 1920 et 1925. Agatha Christie y séjourne en 1930.\nCependant, jusqu'en 1940, le tissu historique reste presque intact, une majorité des Alépins continuant de vivre dans la vieille ville. En 1944, la population de la ville s'élève à environ 325 000 habitants dont 112 110 (34,5 %) sont chrétiens (parmi lesquels 60 200 sont d'origine arménienne). En décembre 1947, le pogrom d'Alep, une émeute antisémite, éclate dans la ville faisant 75 morts et de nombreuses destructions dans la communauté juive locale. Le jardin public d'Alep est inauguré en 1949 ; de grands travaux modernisent la ville à cette époque.\nEn 1973, après que Hafez el-Assad a proposé une constitution laïque pour le pays, des émeutes islamistes éclatent à Alep. Celui-ci est contraint de trouver un compromis et fait inscrire dans la Constitution que le Président doit être musulman. La fin des années 1970 est marquée par le massacre de l'École d'artillerie d'Alep le 16 juin 1979 par les Frères musulmans qui exécutent 83 cadets de l'armée, principalement des Alaouites.\nÀ partir des années 1990, à la suite de mesures de libéralisation des échanges avec la Turquie, la ville connaît une période de croissance, et devient la capitale économique du pays, appréciée pour son dynamisme et son esprit d'entreprise. Elle connaît également une forte croissance démographique provoquée par un exode rural.\n\nEn 2006, la ville gagne le titre de Capitale arabe de la culture islamique.\n\nAvant la guerre civile syrienne\nAvant le conflit, Alep atteint presque trois millions d'habitants, les sunnites arabes sont majoritaires et représentent 65 % de la population, les Kurdes 20 %, les chrétiens 10 %, les alaouites 5 %, sans compter une petite minorité de Druzes et d'ismaéliens. La population est jeune, près de 40 % de sa population a moins de 15 ans.\nC'est une ville industrielle et commerçante, véritable capitale économique de la Syrie. Les quartiers de l'ouest et du centre, avec notamment Chahba et Haleb el-Jedid (le Nouvel Alep), sont les plus riches, habités par la bourgeoisie, les chrétiens et les Alépins d'origine. Les quartiers est, comme Sakhour, Chaar, Salheen et Hanano, sont les plus modestes, peuplés par une population originaire des campagnes. Le quartier d'Hamdaniyé, au sud-est, est celui des fonctionnaires, là où les alaouites sont également les plus présents. Les Kurdes occupent quant à eux principalement le quartier de Cheikh Maqsoud, au nord.\n\nLa guerre civile des années 2010\nÀ partir de 2011, la ville est le théâtre de manifestations contre le régime de Bachar el-Assad, sans être toutefois les plus massives observées dans le pays. La population est divisée et conserve le souvenir de la répression du siège de 1980 et 1981.\nLa bataille d'Alep commence le 19 juillet 2012 par une offensive des rebelles. Rapidement, ces derniers s'emparent de plusieurs quartiers mais échouent à emporter la totalité de la ville. Alep se retrouve alors divisée entre les quartiers ouest, tenus par le régime, et les quartiers est, tenus par l'opposition.\n\nPendant plusieurs années, loyalistes et rebelles s'affrontent dans la ville d'Alep. Des dizaines des factions armées combattent dans les deux camps. De 2012 à 2014, le groupe rebelle dominant à Alep est le Liwa al-Tawhid, affilié à l'Armée syrienne libre, mais ce dernier se désagrège après la mort de son chef Abd al-Qader Salah. En 2015, plusieurs dizaines de groupes insurgés se rassemblent au sein de la coalition Fatah Halab. De son côté, l'armée arabe syrienne est progressivement supplantée par des groupes paramilitaires locaux et des milices chiites irakiennes, libanaises et afghanes soutenus par l'Iran. L'État islamique en Irak et au Levant s'implante également à Alep en 2013, mais il en est chassé en janvier 2014 par les rebelles. De leur côté, les Kurdes des YPG tiennent un quartier au nord de la ville, et nouent ponctuellement des alliances opportunistes, tantôt avec le régime et tantôt avec les rebelles.\nL'intervention militaire de la Russie à la fin de l'année 2015 finit par faire pencher la balance en faveur du régime. En juillet 2016, Alep-Est est totalement encerclée. Depuis l'extérieur, l'Armée de la conquête parvient en août à faire une percée et à briser le siège, mais ce dernier est rétabli en septembre. Deux cent cinquante à trois cent vingt-six mille personnes se retrouvent alors encerclées dans les quartiers est.\nAu cours de la bataille, les bombardements commis aussi bien par les forces aériennes du régime que par les tirs d'artillerie rebelles font des milliers de victimes civiles, essentiellement dans les quartiers est. Proportionnellement, les frappes loyalistes et russes sont cependant d'une ampleur bien supérieure. Le camp loyaliste largue des barils explosifs par hélicoptère (y compris certaines contenant du chlore, on parle alors d'attaques chimiques attribuées aux deux camps, mais seules des attaques commises par le régime ont pu être mises en évidence), et bombarde intentionnellement les casernes des Casques blancs de la Défense civile syrienne et les hôpitaux. Après le début du siège, la population commence également à souffrir de la faim.\nLe souk d'Alep est gravement incendié les 28 et 29 septembre 2012, la mosquée Khousrouwiyah datant du XVIe siècle est détruite par des bombardements rebelles à l'été 2014, ainsi que l'entrée de la citadelle d'Alep. La mosquée al-Atrouche est gravement endommagée, la bibliothèque des Waqifiyya incendiée, et le minaret de la mosquée omeyyade d'Alep tombe sous les bombardements. En tout, cent vingt-et-un bâtiments historiques sont détruits ou endommagés dans la vieille ville d'Alep. En octobre 2016, l'ONU annonce qu'Alep-Est pourrait être « totalement détruite » d'ici à la fin 2016. La bataille d'Alep prend fin le 22 décembre 2016 et se conclut par une victoire du régime syrien et de ses alliés après plus de quatre ans de violents combats, et le déplacement de la population assiégée. Les réflexions sur la reconstruction de la ville ont commencé.\n\nChute d'Alep (2024)\nDans la nuit du 29 au 30 novembre 2024, Alep est prise par le commandement des opérations militaires de l'opposition syrienne. Ce dernier instaure trois couvre-feu du 29 novembre au 1er décembre et prévoit de remettre l'administration de la ville au gouvernement de salut syrien (GSS) après la fin des opérations de déminage. Le 4 décembre 2024, le président du GSS, Mohammed al-Bachir, effectue « une visite d'inspection dans la ville d'Alep pour superviser le travail de revitalisation des institutions ». Le 8 décembre 2024, l'administration d'Alep est officiellement transférée au comité d'intervention d'urgence du GSS, réactivé le 27 novembre 2024 dans le cadre de l'opération Dissuasion de l'agression.\n\nPatrimoine\nLa vieille ville\nLa vieille ville d'Alep est constituée d'un tissu urbain singulier qui témoigne de sa longue histoire marquée par différentes civilisations. Certaines constructions historiques se démarquent, notamment la citadelle d'Alep qui domine l'ensemble, mais aussi la grande mosquée, le souk, les madrasas et hammams.\nCe quartier historique est inscrit au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO en 1986. La municipalité commence un projet de réhabilitation en 1992, et crée le Directoire de la vieille ville en 1999 en ce sens. Mais à partir de 2012, de grandes destructions sont observées lors de la bataille d'Alep pendant la guerre civile.\n\nÉglises d'Alep\nÀ partir du XVIIe siècle, les missionnaires catholiques venus d'Europe se déploient auprès des chrétiens orientaux de la ville qui existent ici depuis les origines du christianisme et formant une élite chrétienne encore présente aujourd'hui dans la ville. Cependant sur les 250000 chrétiens présents avant la guerre civile, les observateurs estiment qu'il n'en restait plus que 40000 à Alep-Ouest en 2017.\n\nCathédrale Notre-Dame d'Alep (melkite) ;\nCathédrale des Quarante-Martyrs (Alep) (arménienne), du XVe siècle ;\nCathédrale Saint-Joseph d'Alep (rite chaldéen) ;\nCathédrale Saint-Élie d'Alep (rite maronite) ;\nCathédrale Saint-François-d'Assise d'Alep (rite latin) ;\nCathédrale du Prophète Élie (Alep), siège de l'archidiocèse grec-orthodoxe d'Alep et d'Alexandrette ;\nÉglise de la Dormition-de-la-Vierge-Marie d'Alep (grecque orthodoxe)\nÉglise Sainte-Assia (Alep) (syriaque) ;\nÉglise de la Sainte-Mère-de-Dieu (Alep) (arménienne) ;\nÉglise Saint-Michel-Archange (melkite) ;\nÉglise presbytérienne d'Alep (protestante) fondée en 1920.\nAlep se trouve dans plusieurs juridictions :\n\nArchéparchie d'Alep des arméniens ;\nArchéparchie d'Alep des maronites ;\nArchéparchie d'Alep des melchites ;\nArchéparchie d'Alep des Syriens ;\nArchidiocèse grec-orthodoxe d'Alep et d'Alexandrette ;\nVicariat apostolique d'Alep.\n\nCuisine\nL'évolution la plus visible en termes de pratiques alimentaires concerne le développement des repas pris à l'extérieur. L'offre est croissante et contribue à ce déplacement progressif du lieu de consommation des repas. De nombreuses rues de la ville se transforment rapidement avec les nouveaux commerces et nouveaux espaces de consommation. L'émergence de nouvelles modes et pratiques alimentaires se fait au travers de ces nouveaux espaces de consommations. À l'origine, les restaurants sont destinés aux voyageurs de passage. Ils accueillent actuellement les familles, les hommes d'affaires et les groupes d'amis. La ville offre un éventail d'espaces de restauration à ambiances, décors, tablées et clientèles très variées. Certains restaurants délimitent un espace pour les femmes et les familles, et un espace pour les hommes.[réf. souhaitée]\n\nCulture\nListe de personnalités nées à Alep\nAutres personnalités :\n\nAbu Firas al-Hamdani, poète ;\nAl-Mutanabbi, poète ;\nÉmile Benveniste (né Ezra), linguiste (1902–1976).\n\nÉconomie\nAlep était, avant la guerre, la capitale économique du pays, avec plus de 97 000 entreprises privées, et 35 % des emplois manufacturiers du pays.\nAlep, carrefour routier et ferroviaire historique affaibli au XXe siècle, a retrouvé son ancienne activité commerciale dans les années 1990. Son artisanat traditionnel est alors toujours florissant, et son activité industrielle se développe (industries agroalimentaires, textiles, cimenterie, verrerie, chimie, constructions mécaniques, etc.). La zone industrielle de Cheikh Najjar est aussi grande que la ville d'Alep elle-même. Elle comptait près de 3 000 usines, et représentait à elle seule le tiers de la production industrielle du pays, et le quart de ses exportations au déclenchement de la guerre civile en Syrie en 2012. La zone a été l'une des premières régions à être prise par la rébellion. Celle-ci a démantelé nombres d'usines et vendu les machines et autres équipements hors du pays.\nMalgré son classement au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité, le tourisme n'était pas très développé avant la guerre. Pourtant la croissance de la ville s'accompagna dans les années 2000 d'un développement croissant de services pour les touristes : hôtels, restaurants et commerces reprennent ainsi possession des maisons nobles de la ville, des khans. Cette croissance s'est brutalement stoppée avec le début de la guerre…\nAlep possède un aéroport international (code AITA : ALP) ; l'aéroport était le deuxième aéroport international de Syrie avant la guerre.\n\nSport\nLa ville accueille sur son territoire le stade international d'Alep qui a déjà accueilli une compétition internationale. La ville est aussi connue pour son club de football, Al Ittihad Alep, l'un des meilleurs de Syrie aux côtés du Club Al Jalaa Sport. Club Al Jalaa a été fondé en 1949 sous le nom الشبيبة الرياضية « la jeunesse sportive ». Dans ce club sont pratiqués plusieurs sports (tels que le tennis, le football, le volleyball, la natation) mais la renommée du club est surtout due au basket, un des sports les plus populaires à Alep.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nListe des émirs d'Alep\nZengides\nPachalik d'Alep\nvilayet d'Alep\nBataille d'Alep (1918)\nBataille d'Alep\nCitadelle d'Alep\nGrande Mosquée d'Alep\nCulture de la Syrie\nChrétiens d'Orient\nCodex d'Alep\nSavon d'Alep\nAéroport international d'Alep\nGare d'Alep\nListe des aires urbaines du Moyen-Orient\nLac Jabbūl\nBataille de Maskin\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\nRessource relative à la géographie : Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire \nRessource relative aux beaux-arts : Grove Art Online \nRessource relative à la musique : MusicBrainz  \n\n Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de la Syrie",
      "summary": "Alep (en arabe : حلب / ḥalab) est une ville de Syrie, chef-lieu du gouvernorat d'Alep, le gouvernorat de Syrie le plus peuplé, situé dans le nord-ouest du pays. Pendant des siècles, Alep a été la ville la plus grande de la région syrienne et la troisième plus grande ville de l'Empire ottoman (après Constantinople et Le Caire). Avec une population de 2 132 100 habitants en 2004, Alep était la ville la plus peuplée du pays et du Levant avant l'arrivée de la guerre civile.\nSituée à l'emplacement de l'antique Bérée (en grec ancien : Βέροια / Béroia ; en latin : Berœa), Alep est une ancienne métropole, l'une des plus vieilles villes du monde à avoir été constamment habitée, étant habitée depuis le VIe millénaire av. J.-C. Son importance historique est attribuée à son emplacement stratégique en tant que centre de commerce à mi-chemin entre la mer Méditerranée et la Mésopotamie (l'Irak moderne), puis à sa situation sur la route de la soie.\nLorsque le canal de Suez a été inauguré en 1869, le commerce a été dévié vers la mer et Alep commença à décliner doucement. À la chute de l'Empire ottoman après la Première Guerre mondiale, Alep céda le nord de son arrière-pays à la Turquie moderne de la même manière que le chemin de fer Berlin-Bagdad.\nDans les années 1940, la ville a perdu son principal accès à la mer lorsqu'Antioche et Alexandrette sont rattachées à la Turquie. Ce déclin a contribué à la préservation de l'ancienne ville d'Alep, son architecture médiévale et son patrimoine traditionnel classé au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité par l'Unesco en 1986. Au cours des années 1990 et 2000, la ville montre un nouveau dynamisme et une forte croissance, mais elle subit d'importantes destructions au cours de la bataille d'Alep de 2012 à 2016.",

      "content": "## Overview\nAleppo (حلب, Ḥalab) is the largest city in Syria, with a population of 2.1 million in 2021. One of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world, it has a wealth of historical sites, and its old city is listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Understand\nAs it is in any Muslim country, the call to prayer is called out from mosques five times a day starting in the early morning. Aleppo's muezzins are traditionally well known for their beautiful calls to prayer.\nAleppo is a fairly conservative city. Dress appropriately to avoid any problems and to avoid standing out too much. Men should wear shirts and trousers and women should not wear anything that is too revealing.  If you follow that simple dress code you should not have any problems. Head scarves are not necessary unless you want to enter a mosque or church but even then grey robes are available at no extra charge.\nPrior to the Syrian Civil War, Aleppo was known for its large Armenian community, many of whom were descended from refugees fleeing the Armenian Genocide, but it is unknown how many remain after the war.\nAleppo was the epicenter of the fighting during much of the Syrian Civil War which erupted as a result of the Arab Spring in 2010. Syrian government forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad eventually prevailed over the rebel groups following Russian intervention in 2016, thus returning all of the city of government control, but not before it had suffered over 30,000 deaths and much of the old city had been destroyed.\nThere are no hostile feelings towards Americans or Westerners in general (although Americans tend to be subjected to more scrutiny by the authorities than other nationalities). You could, however, find yourself in trouble if you engage in open criticism of and against the Syrian government or the president.  Your best bet is to avoid political conversations all together just to avoid any possible problems. If you do engage in political discussions with Syrians, be aware that they might face intense questioning by the secret police if you are overheard. As a general rule, always assume that you are being watched by the plain-clothes policemen (mukhabarat). You will notice that not many uniformed policemen can be seen in the streets, but this is because the police have a wide network of plain-clothes officers and informants.\nFriday is a holy day and most shops and historic sites are closed so plan accordingly for this.\nStealing is looked down upon and thus is not very common.  Crime is generally low and you should feel safe to walk around in any part of the city at any time day or night. But as in any city, it's a good idea to keep an eye on your belongings, particularly in the souk.\nMeals are a bit later than in the U.S. but similar to the times in some European countries.  Lunch is from 13:00 to 15:00 and dinner around 20:00. Syrians take a siesta in the middle of the day, from about 15:00 to 18:00, but this means that the night life is very active.  You can return to the markets and public squares that you visited during the day and by 22:00 they will be bustling with people selling food and treats and drinks.  It is a like a street fair every night.\nAleppo is a beautiful and historic city, but is too dangerous to recommend visiting.\n\n## Climate\nAleppo has a cool steppe climate. The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, the Alawiyin Mountains and the Nur Mountains, largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate (rain shadow effect). More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.\n\n## Get in\nAs of 2019, travel to Aleppo is difficult as major highways are blocked by the civil war and travel on roads that are can take a long time due to frequent military checkpoints. It is however possible to travel overland from Damascus independently or by bus. Travel from Turkey is not possible.\n\n## By plane\nAs of 2023 there's a limited number of scheduled flight to Aleppo, including a few international flights per week, to Yerevan (EVN IATA) and Erbil (EBL IATA). However, flights often have to be cancelled at short notice as the airport is a frequent target of Israeli missile strikes.\n36.1846537.2273451 Aleppo International Airport (مطار حلب الدولي) (7 km east of the city centre). ALP  IATA.      (updated Oct 2021)\n\n## By train\nAll long distance trains, including international trains, are cancelled indefinitely.  National operator CFS do run a local commuter train from the suburb and major refugee camp Jibreen, of little use to visitors.\n\n## Get around\nTaxis are everywhere, probably more taxis than people.  They are easy to take and very affordable but just make sure it is a licensed taxi.\nMinibuses: Called \"serveece\", these are small white vans that drive around and you can hop on and off by signalling to the driver. They get very full in rush hours.\nRental cars: Hertz and other rental car agencies are available in Aleppo but the driving can be very hectic and if you are not accustomed to driving in a place with few rules and almost no regard for street signs you should probably not attempt to drive on your own.\n\n## See\n36.19933237.1627691 Citadel of Aleppo. On a hill in the centre of the city and is visible from almost anywhere. Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, but the current structure dates from the 13th century. The citadel survived the fighting relatively intact and there are daily tours as of 2017.      (updated Oct 2017)\n36.19800337.1564212 Al-Madina Souq. With a total length of almost 13 kilometers, this used to be the largest souk in the world and had all of the shopping you could want to do from gold and silver, boxes, clothing, fabric and soap. Severely damaged during the civil war. A small part of the souk called al-Saqatiyah reopened in 2019. Bargaining is encouraged and if you know some Arabic it will get you a much better price.      (updated Oct 2019)\n36.20196137.14973 Central Synagogue of Aleppo. First built in the Byzantine period, perhaps as early as the 9th century before BCE.

After extensive reparation, the museum re-opened in October 2019.      (updated Jun 2020)\n36.19683337.1570668 Bimaristan Arghan. A beautiful mental hospital turned into a museum. Entrance is free and you can wander around and look at exhibits, which include old medical equipment, herbs, biographies of famous Arab scientists and other interesting artifacts. The main attractions, however, are the courtyard and two separate spaces reserved for the mentally ill.    (updated Feb 2018)\n36.20605337.1565819 Popular Traditions Museum (بيت أجقباش في الجديدة). Housed in Beit Achiqbash, a prime example of an Aleppine courtyard mansion, built in the mid 18th Century.

(updated Mar 2024)\n\n## Mosques\n36.19949237.15691110 Great Mosque of Aleppo (جامع حلب الكبير). Also known as the Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo is the largest and one of the oldest mosques in Aleppo, built between the 11th and 14th centuries. Its minaret, dating back to 1090 along with other parts of the mosque was destroyed during the Syrian civil war in April 2013. Both the mosque and its minaret are to be rebuilt during the coming years.      (updated Oct 2017)\n36.19985437.16018511 Al-Saffahiyah Mosque. Built in 1425.

Seat of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Aleppo, built in 1972.   (updated Aug 2024)\n\n## Do\nWalk around the city at least a few times to really get a feel for what it is like. It is a vibrant and lively place that will continually surprise you. Any amount of time spent walking around the city will reveal another historical site or point of interest. Check out the Christian section of the city to see a different part of Aleppo. If you want to shop for clothes, al-Telal street is bustling nearly every night with crowds checking out the shops and street stands piled high with every type of clothing imaginable.\n\n## Buy\nGold: Although the prices are as high as they have ever been, gold is still a worthwhile purchase here. There is a special gold pattern called the Aleppo weave or chain that is made only in Aleppo. All gold is sold by weight and is 22 carat.\nBoxes: Aleppo is also famous for its intricate inlay work that can be found in boxes of all shapes and sizes. These boxes are beautiful and can be found at almost all of the shops in the souq. A great, affordable gift to take home.\nWraps/tablecloths: There are many nice wraps that can be worn as shawls or used as tablecloths that are also available everywhere in the souqs. Another good gift.\nSweets: Pistachios are everywhere in Aleppo and accordingly there are many different kinds of sweets made from the pistachio. These usually come in a decorative box and are yet another good gift.\nCoffee and spices: It is impossible to walk through the souq without being caught up in the scent of freshly ground coffee and spices like cumin. You can also buy very ornate pots to make your coffee in.\nSoap: One of the most famous Aleppine products is its olive oil soap. Many factories produce this using traditional techniques. The price varies depending on the proportion of olive and laurel oil, prices and assortment is better in the shops just in the 2 roads south of the Clock Tower rather than in the Souq's tourist traps, even if most shop keepers speak very little English (prices per kilo are clearly shown).\n\n## Eat\nThe area around Aleppo is famous for its pistachio farming, so be sure to try the baklava and other pistachio-based sweets while you're here.\nCommon Syrian street food like falafels and shwarma are excellent and available throughout the city. In the souks you will also find tiny restaurants with a few stools serving up dishes like Fuul (pronounced “fool”), a  bean soup served with fresh bread, onions and mint. If you are adventurous, look for the men frying curry-flavoured pancakes near the entrance to the souk. The pancakes are wrapped in bread and topped with hot sauce. Also try to buy some of the freshly made pita bread that is sold everywhere as it is delicious.\nFor breakfast, a fresh glass of juice and cheese sandwich can be had from the juice stands near the clock tower. Many cafés also serve great ice cream for a treat.\nIf you are tired after a day of wandering around the souk, try one of the cafés near the base of the citadel. They offer light snacks and drinks, including a wide range of coffees and refreshing glasses of minted lemonade.\nTravellers on a strict budget should be prepared to eat very similar meals everyday as there is not a lot of variety in the diet at the cheaper end of the range.\nThere are plenty of good restaurants around and meals are very affordable.\n36.20757237.1579841 Haj Abdo. Having been around since 1885, Haj Abdo is considered the best parlor of ful - a stew of cooked fava beans - in town.   (updated Nov 2020)\n\n## In the Christian Quarter (El Jedeide) district\nLa Gondole, ☏ +963 21 4124095. Cafe and restaurant featuring a Swimming pool with a sitting table around the pool and outdoors bar under the sunshine.\nAl Mir, ☏ +963 21 3336580. Cafe and restaurant featuring a rerrace with views over the Aleppo Citadel.\nBeit Sissy. A particularly good choice. It has a beautiful courtyard and their shish kebab in cherry sauce is out of this world!\nSheraton Hotel. It may seem wrong to come to Syria and head for the Sheraton but they do offer an excellent buffet breakfast, which, if you're willing to splurge, makes a nice change from the typical Syrian fare and will set you up well for a day of exploring. They also do a fine cup of coffee.\n\n## In Aziziyeh\nAl- Challal\nWANES  Restaurant\n\n## Drink\nAlcohol is permitted but not widely available. You can find stores selling liquor on a few streets near the clocktower. Try Zaki al-Arsuzi (across from Al Kommeh restaurant) and Jbrail Dalal streets.  There is a liquor store a few metres away from the Aleppo Hotel (on a side street from the clocktower).  In the new city there is a store at Al Hateb square.  Restaurants and hotels that cater to Westerners will generally serve alcoholic beverages.\nThere is one local beer, called Al-Sharq, while the Damascus brew Barada may also be found. Neither are exactly lethal - 3.7% and 3.4% respectively.\nA wide range of other beers from the Middle East and Europe can also be found, along with wines from Syria, Lebanon and France.\nArak is a local aniseed spirit which can be found at some small shops.\n36.19780737.1610951 Al Attar Cafe (مطعم و كافتيريا العطار) (In front of Aleppo citadel). Popular café with magnificent views over the entrance of Aleppo citadel.    (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Budget\nAl-Gawaher – Bab al-Faraj Street, Behind Library. Perhaps the best backpacker spot in Aleppo. Rooms have satellite TV and both en suite and shared bathrooms are very clean. Many have balconies and others overlook a common area, where travellers often meet to chat. The rooftop gives great views over the city and is another nice spot to spend the evening. Staff are friendly and English is spoken. Tours can be arranged to the Dead Cities, Apamea and other sites. The only possible downside is that staff are late risers and so getting breakfast can be a problem. Breakfast is not included. There is, however, free coffee and tea available 24/7.\nHotel Alnagm Alakhdar (aka Hotel Green Star) – Around the corner from the Al-Gawaher on Sharia Hammam Al Tal (next to the Sheraton parking entrance off the Clock Tower end of Bab El Faraj - it could not be more central - 963-21-212 60 23, mob. 963 -944-25 76 45), it also has a nice roof terrace but the atmosphere is not nearly as lively. The rooms come with sinks and fans or air-con. There are no TVs in the rooms but two shared ones: one in the lounge and the second one on the top floor. Try to get one on the top floor that opens onto the roof terrace. Staff speak a little English but are very helpful. Breakfast is not included.\nHotel Kaser Alandaloss - Just off Bab Al-Faraj Street, in sight of the clock tower on a small block, nestled between a couple of soap merchant stores. The rooms are nice, and they have excellent showers and a comfortable central area to sit, eat, use the internet. There's no option for breakfast, but if you want some tea or some food, they are more than likely to make some for you.\n\n## Mid-range\n36.21666537.1668811 Dar Halabia Hotel, Bab Antakya (Inside the old souk), ☏ +963 933 100 068.    (updated Jul 2018)\n\n## Splurge\n36.21288437.1491032 Park Hotel, Baghdad Station St, ☏ +963 21 223 3283, fax: +963 21 2233250, info@parkhotelsyria.com. Located in the middle of the city centre. Ten minutes walk to the city centre, and 5 minutes by car to the old souks. Free WiFi internet access in all around the hotel with high speed line. Laundry and pressing service. Airport pick-up and drop-off service.    (updated Jan 2018)\n36.20475737.1540563 Sheraton Hotel Aleppo, Al Khandaq St, ☏ +963 21 212 1111. Reopened in 2018, this is the most luxurious hotel available in Aleppo. Despite its name, the hotel is not part of the Sheraton hotel chain.      (updated Sep 2018)\n36.20502337.1499044 Baron Hotel (Corner of Baron St and Yarmouk St). A colonial throwback - the hotel opened in 1909 - whose former guests include Agatha Christie (who wrote much of Murder on the Orient Express here), T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), Ataturk and Teddy Roosevelt. During latter years the hotel developed the charm of a place that had seen better days. Residents and visitors alike also took the effort to pop into the bar to have a drink and marvel a showpiece at a bygone era. Bombarded during the civil war and forced to close in 2014, it is as of 2017 unclear if and when this historic hotel will reopen.      (updated Oct 2017)\nBeit Wakil (from Jdeideh Square, walk down the street into the old city and turn right at the first alley, called Sissi St), ☏ +963 21 2117083, fax: +963 21 2117082, betwakil@scs-net.org. A great small boutique hotel in the Christian quarter. Renovated old building with a nice courtyard. The restaurant is very good but a bit touristy. Doubles US$121.\nRamsis Hotel, ☏ +963 21 2111102, fax: +963 21 2216700, info@ramsishotel.com. Very centrally located close to the citadel and old Christian quarter, one minute away from the museum. A three-star, deluxe hotel. Very comfortable and well-furnished 28 rooms and 8 suites, a street side cafeteria (Down Town Cafe), an open terrace restaurant (The Green Roof), a gift shop, a news-stand and internet access.\n\n## Connect\nAn internet access in the old town and near the main attractions (the Citadel, the Souq and the Grand Mosque) can be found at Tara Cafe. It is located in the underground lair of the caravansary of the Adlliyah Mosque and provides standard rates for internet access. It is not an internet cafe, but rather a cafe that provides internet access as a service on laptops that can be rented by the hour.\nThe Friends Cafe Net is also located in the area of the Citadel. From the entrance to the Citadel, walk straight (south) to a block with shawarma & chicken outlets on the ground floor. The cafe is just behind the block in a small street called \"Jnenyt al-Fariq(1)\". From the outlets, follow the street to your right, turn left then immediately right.\nThe closest internet cafe to most of the budget hotels, in the Bab al-Faraj area, is the Concord, which is in an ice cream parlor and cafe by the same name. It charges an outrageous rate for Aleppo and Syria and general.\nThe other internet cafe within walking distance is at Adam Cafe, across the street from the Baron Hotel. Nevertheless, the internet cafe is in the bottom story of an all-male tea house which may make female customers feel uncomfortable. If you wander around the new Christian quarter of al-Aziziyeh you can find many internet cafes such as Area 51, Montana and Kool Net which offer high speed access. All of the aforementioned cafes provide discount cards for chunks of time.\n\n## Stay safe\nMany buildings in the city, particularly in the Salaheddin neighborhood and surrounding areas, have been damaged severely by the civil war. Buildings can and do collapse, often with deadly consequences. Stay away from buildings that have sustained heavy damage or look structurally unstable.\n\n## Go next\nDamascus",
