      "content": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic period\nThe site of the Umayyad Mosque is attested as a place of worship since the Iron Age. Damascus was the capital of the Aramaean state Aram-Damascus and a large temple was dedicated to Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain, and was erected at the site of the present-day mosque. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of King Hazael, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus.\nThe Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city afterwards. Under the rule of the Seleucids in the Hellenistic period, probably in the 2nd century BC, the temple was formally dedicated to the Greek god Zeus, who was assmilated to Haddad-Ramman. After the Roman Empire conquered Damascus in 64 BC, they introduced worship of the equivalent Roman god, Jupiter. Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple, probably beginning in the reign of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD). The later Damascus-born architect Apollodorus may have been involved in the design.\nThe new Temple of Jupiter became the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter and was served as a response to the Second Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early Roman period, some funded by contributions from individuals. The temple was further renovated and embellished during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193–211). The remains of the western propylaeum visible today most likely date from his tme. By the 4th century, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, outer wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second inner wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in Roman Syria.\nIn 391, the Temple of Jupiter was converted into a cathedral by the Christian emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395). The church was likely one of the largest of the time. It served as the seat of the Bishop of Damascus, who ranked second within the Patriarchate of Antioch after the patriarch himself.\n\nUmayyad construction\nFoundation and construction\nDamascus was captured by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. In 661, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty, which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The Byzantine cathedral had remained in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims was constructed on the southeastern part of the building. The musalla did not have the capacity to house the rapidly growing number of Muslim worshippers in Damascus. The city otherwise lacked sufficient free space for a large congregational mosque. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I (r. 705–715), resolved to construct such a mosque on the site of the cathedral in 706.\nAl-Walid personally supervised the project and had most of the cathedral, including the musalla, demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building, though it preserved the outer walls of the temenos (sanctuary or inner enclosure) of the Roman-era temple. While the church (and the temples before it) had the main building located at the centre of the rectangular enclosure, the mosque's prayer hall is placed against its south wall. The architect recycled the columns and arcades of the church, dismantling and repositioning them in the new structure. Besides its use as a large congregational mosque for the Damascenes, the new house of worship was meant as a tribute to the city. \nIn response to Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered all the other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 711, or in 715, shortly after al-Walid's death, by his successor, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715–717). According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 gold dinars were spent on the project. The historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship notes that the field army of Damascus, numbering some 45,000 soldiers, were taxed a quarter of their salaries for nine years to pay for its construction. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek, and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the labor force which consisted of 12,000 people. The extravagant costs also attracted initial resentment among the population and criticism from some Muslim writers.     \nThe mosque subsequently held major religious and cultural significance throughout its history, while also having a strong influence on later Islamic architecture. It was commonly regarded as one of the \"wonders of the world\" by medieval Muslim authors, who praised its architecture and decoration. Some medieval authors even claim that of the five wonders the mosque ranks fourth for its superlative beauty and extraordinary cost while its decoration ranks fifth.\n\nLayout design\nThe plan of the new mosque was innovative and highly influential in the history of early Islamic architecture. The earliest mosques before this had been relatively plain hypostyle structures (a flat-roof hall supported by columns), of which the Prophet's Mosque in Medina was an important model. The new mosque in Damascus introduced a more basilical plan to this model, with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave. The central nave, which leads from the main entrance to the mihrab (niche in the qibla wall) and features a central dome, provided a new aesthetic focus which may have been designed to emphasize the area originally reserved for the caliph during prayers, near the mihrab. There is some uncertainty as to whether the dome was originally directly in front of the mihrab (as in many later mosques) or in its current position mid-way along the central nave. Scholars have attributed the design of the mosque's plan to the influences of Byzantine Christian basilicas in the region. Rafi Grafman and Myriam Rosen-Ayalon have argued that the first Umayyad Al-Aqsa Mosque built in Jerusalem, begun by Abd al-Malik (al-Walid's father) and now replaced by later constructions, had a layout very similar to the current Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and that it probably served as a model for the latter.\nThe mosque initially had no minaret towers, as this feature of mosque architecture was not established until later. However, at least two of the corners of the mosque's outer wall had short towers, platforms, or roof shelters which were used by the muezzin to issue the call to prayer (adhān), constituting a type of proto-minaret. These features were referred to as a mi'd͟hana (\"place of the adhān\") or as a ṣawma῾a (\"monk's cell\", due to their small size) in historical Arabic sources. Arabic sources indicated that they were former Roman towers which already stood at the corners of the temenos before the mosque's construction and were simply left intact and reused after construction.\n\nDecoration\nThe mosque was richly decorated. A rich composition of marble paneling covered the lower walls, though only minor examples of the original marbles have survived today near the east gate. The walls of the prayer hall were raised above the level of the old temenos walls, which allowed for new windows to be inserted in the upper walls. The windows had ornately carved grilles that foreshadowed the styles of windows in later Islamic architecture.\nThe most celebrated decorative element of all was the revetment of mosaics, which originally covered much of the courtyard and the interior hall. The best-preserved remains are still visible in the courtyard today.\nBy some estimates, the original mosque had the largest area of gold mosaics in the world, covering approximately 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). The mosaics depict landscapes and buildings in a characteristic late Roman style. They reflected a wide variety of artistic styles used by mosaicists and painters since the 1st century CE, but the combined use of all these different styles in the same place was innovative at the time. Similar to the Dome of the Rock, built earlier by Abd al-Malik, vegetation and plants were the most common motif, but those of the Damascus mosque are more naturalistic. In addition to the large landscape depictions, a mosaic frieze with an intricate vine motif (referred to as the karma in Arabic historical sources) once ran around the walls of the prayer hall, above the level of the mihrab. The only notable omission is the absence of human and animal figures, which was likely a new restriction imposed by the Muslim patron. \n\nHistorical Arabic sources, often written in later centuries, suggest that both the craftsmen and the materials employed to create the mosque's mosaics were imported from the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. The 12th-century historian Ibn Asakir claimed that al-Walid pressured the Byzantine emperor into sending him 200 craftsmen by threatening to destroy all churches inside Umayyad territory if he refused. Many scholars, based on such evidence from Arabic sources, have accepted a Byzantine (Constantinopolitan) origin for the mosaics, while some, such as Creswell, have interpreted the story as a later embellishment of Muslim historians with a symbolic political significance.\nArt historian Finbarr Barry Flood notes that historical sources report many other apparent gifts of artisans and materials from the Byzantine emperors to the Umayyad caliphs and other rulers, probably reflecting a widespread admiration for Byzantine craftsmanship that continued in the early Islamic period. He notes that while Byzantine influence is indeed apparent in the mosque's mosaic imagery, there are multiple ways in which Byzantine mosaicists could have contributed to its production, including a collaboration with local craftsmen. Some scholars argue that the mosaic techniques in both the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque, including their distinctive colour scheme, are more clearly consistent with the craftsmanship of Syro-Palestinian or Egyptian mosaicists. Archeologist Judith McKenzie suggests that the mosaics could have been designed by local artisans who oversaw their production, while any mosaicists sent from Constantinople could have been working under their supervision. A recent 2022 study of the chemical composition of mosaic tesserae in the Umayyad Mosque concluded that the majority were produced in Egypt around the time of the mosque's construction, matching other recent studies of samples from the Dome of the Rock and Khirbat al-Majfar that came to the same conclusion.\n\nScholars have long debated the meaning of the mosaic imagery. Some historical Muslim writers and some modern scholars have interpreted them as a topographical representation of all the cities in the known world (or within the Umayyad world), some have interpreted them as a representation of Damascus itself and the Barada River, and other scholars interpret them as a depiction of Paradise. The earliest known interpretation of the mosaics is by the 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, who suggested a topographical meaning, commenting that \"there is hardly a tree or a notable town that has not been pictured on these walls.\" An early example of the Paradise interpretation dates from the writings of Ibn al-Najjar in the 12th century. This interpretation has been favoured by more recent scholarship. Some of the Qur'anic inscriptions that were originally present on the qibla wall of the mosque, mentioning the Day of Judgment and promising the reward of a heavenly garden (al-janna), may support this interpretation. Another clue is an account by historian Ibn Zabala in 814, which reports that one of the mosaicists who worked for al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (contemporary with the construction in Damascus) directly explained the mosaics there as a reproduction of the trees and palaces of Paradise, which suggests that the contemporary Umayyad mosaics in Damascus had the same intention.\nIn this interpretation, the lack of human figures in these scenes possibly represents a Paradise that stands empty until the arrival of its human inhabitants at the end of time. Other motifs in the mosaics have been cited to support a paradisal meaning and the imagery has been compared with both the descriptions of Paradise in the Qur'an and the earlier iconography of paradisal imagery in Late Antique art. According to Judith McKenzie, there is a similarity between certain architectural elements depicted in the Umayyad mosaics and those shown in Pompeian frescoes (such as broken pediments and tholoi with tented roofs and Corinthian columns), as well as some early Christian and Byzantine art, which are most likely depictions of the architecture of Hellenistic Alexandria. In Roman and Late Antique art, Alexandrian and Egyptian landscapes had a paradisal connotation. McKenzie argues that the Umayyad mosaics, extending these traditions, can thus be understood as a depiction of Paradise. The possibility also remains that the mosaic scenes combine more than one of these meanings at the same time; for example, by using paradisal imagery to represent Damascus or the Umayyad realm as an idealized, earthly paradise.\n\nThe mihrab\nThe original mihrab was one of the first concave mihrabs in the Islamic world, the second one known to exist after the one created in 706–707 during al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. The exact appearance of the mosque's original main mihrab is uncertain, due to the multiple repairs and restorations that took place over the centuries. Ibn Jubayr, who visited the mosque in 1184, described the inside of the mihrab as filled with miniature blind arcades whose arches resembled \"small mihrabs\", each filled with inlaid mother-of-pearl mosaics and framed by spiral columns of marble. This mihrab was famed across the Islamic world for its beauty, as noted by other writers of the era.\nIts appearance may have been imitated by other surviving mihrabs built under the Mamluk sultans al-Mansur Qalawun and al-Nasir Muhammad in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as the richly decorated mihrab of Qalawun's mausoleum in Cairo (completed in 1285). Scholars generally assume that the mihrab described by Ibn Jubayr dated from a restoration of the mosque in 1082. Another restoration occurred after 1401 and this version, which survived until another fire in 1893, was again decorated with miniature arcades, while its semi-dome was filled with coffering similar to Roman architecture. Finbarr Barry Flood has suggested that the perpetuation of the mihrab's arcaded decoration across several restorations indicates that the medieval restorations were aimed at preserving at least some of the original mihrab's appearance, and therefore the 8th-century Umayyad mihrab may have had these features.\n\nAbbasid and Fatimid era\nFollowing the toppling of the Umayyads in 750, the Abbasid dynasty came to power and moved the capital of the Caliphate to Baghdad. Apart from the attention given for strategic and commercial purposes, the Abbasids had no interest in Damascus. Thus, the Umayyad Mosque reportedly suffered under their rule, with little recorded building activity between the 8th and 10th centuries. However, the Abbasids did consider the mosque to be a major symbol of Islam's triumph, and thus it was spared the systematic eradication of the Umayyad legacy in the city. In 789–90 the Abbasid governor of Damascus, al-Fadl ibn Salih ibn Ali, constructed the Dome of the Treasury with the purpose of housing the mosque's funds. The so-called Dome of the Clock, standing in the eastern part of the courtyard, may have also been erected originally by the same Abbasid governor in 780. The 10th-century Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi credited the Abbasids for building the northern minaret (Madhanat al-Arous, meaning 'Minaret of the Bride') of the mosque in 831 during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This was accompanied by al-Ma'mun's removal and replacement of Umayyad inscriptions in the mosque.\nBy the early 10th century, a monumental water clock had been installed by the entrance in the western part of the southern wall of the mosque, which was consequently known as Bab al-Sa'a ('Gate of the Clock') at the time but is known today as Bab al-Ziyada. This clock seems to have stopped functioning by the middle of the 12th century. Abbasid rule over Syria began crumbling during the early 10th century, and in the decades that followed, it came under the control of autonomous realms who were only nominally under Abbasid authority. The Fatimids of Egypt, who adhered to Shia Islam, conquered Damascus in 970, but few recorded improvements of the mosque were undertaken by the new rulers. The Umayyad Mosque's prestige allowed the residents of Damascus to establish the city as a center for Sunni intellectualism, enabling them to maintain relative independence from Fatimid religious authority. In 1069, large sections of the mosque, particularly the northern wall, were destroyed in a fire as a result of an uprising by the city's residents against the Fatimids' Berber army who were garrisoned there.\n\nSeljuk and Ayyubid era\nThe Sunni Muslim Seljuk Turks gained control of the city in 1078 and restored the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Seljuk ruler Tutush (r. 1079–1095) initiated the repair of damage caused by the 1069 fire. In 1082, his vizier, Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fadl, had the central dome restored in a more spectacular form; the two piers supporting it were reinforced and the original Umayyad mosaics of the northern inner façade were renewed. The northern riwaq ('portico') was rebuilt in 1089. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1104–1128), repaired the northern wall in 1110 and two inscribed panels located above its doorways were dedicated to him. In 1113, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul, Sharaf al-Din Mawdud (r. 1109–1113), was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque. As the conflict between Damascus and the Crusaders intensified in the mid-12th century, the mosque was used as a principal rallying point calling on Muslims to defend the city and return Jerusalem to Muslim hands. Prominent imams, including Ibn Asakir, preached a spiritual jihad ('struggle') and when the Crusaders advanced towards Damascus in 1148, the city's residents heeded their calls; the Crusader army withdrew as a result of their resistance.\n\nDuring the reign of the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din Zangi, which began in 1154, a second monumental clock, the Jayrun Water Clock, was built on his personal orders. It was constructed outside the eastern entrance to the mosque, called Bab Jayrun, by the architect Muhammad al-Sa'ati, was rebuilt by al-Sa'ati following a fire in 1167, and was eventually repaired by his son, Ridwan, in the early 13th century. It may have survived into the 14th century. The Arab geographer al-Idrisi visited the mosque in 1154.\nDamascus witnessed the establishment of several religious institutions under the Ayyubids, but the Umayyad Mosque retained its place as the center of religious life in the city. Muslim traveler Ibn Jubayr described the mosque as containing many different zawaya (religious lodges) for religious and Quranic studies. In 1173, the northern wall of the mosque was damaged again by the fire and was rebuilt by the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin (r. 1174–1193), along with the Minaret of the Bride, which had been destroyed in the 1069 fire. During the internal feuds between later Ayyubid princes, the city was dealt a great deal of damage, and the mosque's eastern minaret—known as the 'Minaret of Jesus'—was destroyed at the hands of as-Salih Ayyub of Egypt while besieging as-Salih Ismail of Damascus in 1245. The minaret was later rebuilt with little decoration. Saladin, along with many of his successors, were buried around the Umayyad Mosque (see Mausoleum of Saladin).\n\nMamluk era\nThe Mongols, under the leadership of the Nestorian Christian Kitbuqa, with the help of some submitted Western Christian forces, captured Damascus from the Ayyubids in 1260 while Kitbuqa's superior Hulagu Khan had returned to the Mongol Empire for other business. Bohemond VI of Antioch, one of the Western Christian generals in the invasion, ordered Catholic Mass to be performed in the Umayyad Mosque. However, the Muslim Mamluks of Egypt, led by Sultan Qutuz and Baybars, wrested control of the city from the Mongols later in the same year, killing Kitbuqa in the Battle of Ain Jalut, and the purpose of the Mosque was returned from Christian to its original Islamic function. In 1270, Baybars, by now sultan, ordered extensive restorations to the mosque, particularly its marble, mosaics and gildings. According to Baybars' biographer, Ibn Shaddad, the restorations cost the sultan 20,000 dinars. Among the largest mosaic fragments restored was a 34.5 by 7.3 metres (113 by 24 ft) segment in the western portico called the \"Barada panel\". The mosaics that decorated the mosque were a specific target of the restoration project and they had a major influence on Mamluk architecture in Syria and Egypt.\nIn 1285, the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya started teaching Qur'an exegesis in the mosque. When the Ilkhanid Mongols under Ghazan invaded the city in 1300, Ibn Taymiyya preached jihad, urging the citizens of Damascus to resist their occupation. The Mamluks under Sultan Qalawun drove out the Mongols later that year. When Qalawun's forces entered the city, the Mongols attempted to station several catapults in the Umayyad Mosque because the Mamluks had started fires around the citadel to prevent Mongol access to it. The attempt failed as the Mamluks burned the catapults before they were placed in the mosque.\nThe Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Tankiz, carried out restoration work in the mosque in 1326–1328. He reassembled the mosaics on the qibla wall and replaced all the marble tiles in the prayer hall. Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad also undertook major restoration work for the mosque in 1328. He demolished and completely rebuilt the unstable qibla wall and moved the Bab al-Ziyadah gate to the east. Much of that work was damaged during a fire that burned the mosque in 1339. Islamic art expert, Finbarr Barry Flood, describes the Bahri Mamluks' attitude towards the mosque as an \"obsessive interest\" and their efforts at maintaining, repairing, and restoring the mosque were unparalleled in any other period of Muslim rule. The Arab astronomer Ibn al-Shatir worked as the chief muwaqqit ('religious timekeeper') and the chief muezzin at the Umayyad Mosque from 1332 until he died in 1376. He erected a large sundial on the mosque's northern minaret in 1371, now lost. A replica was installed in its place in the modern period. The Minaret of Jesus was burnt down in a fire in 1392.\nThe Mongol conqueror Timur besieged Damascus in 1400. He ordered the burning of the city on 17 March 1401, and the fire ravaged the Umayyad Mosque. The eastern minaret was reduced to rubble, and the central dome collapsed. Another fire damaged the mosque in October 1479, causing the Mamluk sultan Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496) to sponsor repair works. This included the reconstruction of the southwestern minaret in 1488.\n\nOttoman era\nDamascus was conquered from the Mamluks by the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Selim I in 1516. The first Friday prayer performed in Selim's name in the Umayyad Mosque was attended by the sultan himself. The Ottomans used an endowment system (waqf) for religious sites as a means to link the local population with the central authority. The waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was the largest in the city, employing 596 people. Supervisory and clerical positions were reserved for Ottoman officials while religious offices were held mostly by members of the local ulema (Muslim scholars). Although the awqaf (plural of \"waqf\") were taxed, the waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was exempted from taxation. In 1518, the Ottoman governor of Damascus and supervisor of the mosque's waqf, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, had the mosque repaired and redecorated as part of his architectural reconstruction program for the city.\nThe prominent Sufi scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi taught regularly at the Umayyad Mosque starting in 1661.\nThe khatib (preacher) of the Umayyad Mosque was one of the three most influential religious officials in Ottoman Damascus, the other two being the Hanafi mufti and the naqib al-ashraf. He served as a link between the imperial government in Constantinople and the elites of Damascus and was a key shaper of public opinion in the city. By 1650 members of the mercantile and scholarly Mahasini family held the position, retaining it for much of the 18th and early and mid-19th centuries, partly due to their links with the Shaykh al-Islam in the imperial capital. In the late 19th century, another Damascene family with connections in Constantinople, the Khatibs, vied for the position. After the death of the Mahasini preacher in 1869, a member of the Khatibs succeeded him.\nThe mosque's prayer hall was once again ravaged and partly destroyed by fire in 1893. A laborer engaging in repair work accidentally started the fire when he was smoking his nargila (water pipe). The fire destroyed the inner fabric of the prayer hall and caused the collapse of the mosque's central dome. The Ottomans fully restored the mosque, largely maintaining the original layout. The restoration process, which lasted nine years, did not attempt to reproduce the original decoration. The central mihrab was replaced and the dome was rebuilt in a contemporary Ottoman style. The rubble and damaged elements from the fire, including some of the original pillars and mosaic remains, were simply disposed of.\n\nUntil 1899 the mosque's library included the \"very old\" Qubbat al-Khazna collection; \"most of its holdings were given to the German emperor Wilhelm II and only a few pieces kept for the National Archives in Damascus.\"\nIt is the burial place of the first three officers of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons who died on mission, in this case the Istanbul-Cairo expedition in 1914. They were Navy Lieutenant Fethi Bey and his navigator, Artillery First Lieutenant Sadık Bey and Artillery Second Lieutenant Nuri Bey.\n\nModern era\nThe Umayyad Mosque underwent major restorations in 1929 during the French Mandate over Syria and in 1954 and 1963 under the Syrian Republic.\nIn the 1980s and in the early 1990s, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad ordered a wide-scale renovation of the mosque. The methods and concepts of Assad's restoration project were heavily criticized by UNESCO, but the general approach in Syria was that the mosque was more of a symbolic monument rather than a historical one and thus, its renovation could only enhance the mosque's symbolism.\nIn 1990s, Mohammed Burhanuddin constructed a zarih of the martyrs of the Battle of Karbala, whose heads were brought to the Mosque after their defeat at the hands of the then Umayyad caliph, Yazid I.\nIn 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque.\nOn March 15, 2011, the first significant protests related to the Arab Spring and eventually the Syrian civil war began at the Umayyad Mosque when 40–50 worshippers gathered outside the complex and chanted pro-democracy slogans. Syrian security forces swiftly quelled the protests and cordoned off the area during Friday prayers to prevent large-scale demonstrations.\n\nAfter the Fall of the Assad regime and the victory of opposition forces in the civil war, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa gave a victory speech from Umayyad Mosque during which he declared a new era in Syria's history.\n\nArchitecture\nThe ground plan of the Umayyad Mosque is rectangular in shape and measures 97 meters (318 ft) by 156 meters (512 ft). A large courtyard occupies the northern part of the mosque complex, while the prayer hall or haram ('sanctuary') covers the southern part. The mosque is enclosed by four exterior walls which were part of the temenos of the original Roman temple.\n\nSanctuary\nThree arcades make up the interior space of the sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards Mecca. The arcades are supported by two rows of stone Corinthian columns. Each of the arcades contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular arches, while the second level is made up of double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by the arcades of the courtyard. The three interior arcades intersect in the center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the qibla wall and faces the mihrab and the minbar. The central transept divides the arcades into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures 136 meters (446 ft) by 37 meters (121 ft) and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.\nFour mihrabs line the sanctuary's rear wall, the main one being the Great Mihrab which is located roughly at the center of the wall. The Mihrab of the Sahaba, named after the sahaba ('companions of Muhammad') is situated in the eastern half. According to the 9th-century Muslim engineer Musa ibn Shakir, the latter mihrab was built during the mosque's initial construction and it became the third niche-formed mihrab in Islam's history.\nThe central dome of the mosque is known as the 'Dome of the Eagle' (Qubbat an-Nisr) and located atop the center of the prayer hall. The original wooden dome was replaced by one built of stone following the 1893 fire. It receives its name because it is thought to resemble an eagle, with the dome itself being the eagle's head while the eastern and western flanks of the prayer hall represent the wings. With a height of 36 meters (118 ft), the dome rests on an octagonal substructure with two arched windows on each of its sides. It is supported by the central interior arcade and has openings along its parameter.\n\nCourtyard\nIn the courtyard (sahn), the level of the stone pavement had become uneven over time due to several repairs throughout the mosque's history. Recent work on the courtyard has restored it to its consistent Umayyad-era levels. Arcades (riwaq) surround the courtyard supported by alternating stone columns and piers. There is one pier in between every two columns. Because the northern part of the courtyard had been destroyed in an earthquake in 1759, the arcade is not consistent; when the northern wall was rebuilt the columns that were supporting it were not. The courtyard and its arcades contain the largest preserved remnants of the mosque's Umayyad-era mosaic decoration.\nSeveral domed pavilions stand in the courtyard. The Dome of the Treasury is an octagonal structure decorated with mosaics, standing on eight Roman columns in the western part of the courtyard. Its 8th-century mosaics were largely remade in the late 20th-century restoration. In a mirror position on the other side of the courtyard is the Dome of the Clock, another octagonal domed pavilion. Near the middle of the courtyard, sheltering an ablutions fountain at ground level, is a rectangular pavilion which is a modern reconstruction of a late Ottoman pavilion.\n\nMinarets\nWithin the Umayyad Mosque complex are three minarets. The Minaret of Isa on the southeast corner, the Minaret of Qaytbay (also called Madhanat al-Gharbiyya) on the southwest corner, and the Minaret of the Bride located along the northern wall.\n\nMinaret of the Bride\nThe Minaret of the Bride was the first one built and is located on the mosque's northern wall. The exact year of the minaret's original construction is unknown. The bottom part of the minaret most likely dates back to the Abbasid era in the 9th century. While it is possible that the Umayyads built it, there is no indication that a minaret on the northern wall was a part of al-Walid I's initial concept. Al-Muqaddasi visited the minaret in 985 when Damascus was under Abbasid control and described it as \"recently built\". The upper segment was constructed in 1174. This minaret is used by the muezzin for the call to prayer (adhan) and there is a spiral staircase of 160 stone steps that lead to the muezzin's calling position.\nThe Minaret of the Bride is divided into two sections; the main tower and the spire which are separated by a lead roof. The oldest part of the minaret, or the main tower, is square in shape, has four galleries, and consists of two different forms of masonry; the base consists of large blocks, while the upper section is built of dressed stone. There are two light openings near the top of the main tower, before the roof, with horseshoe arches and cubical capitals enclosed in a single arch. A smaller arched corbel is located below these openings. According to local legend, the minaret is named after the daughter of the merchant who provided the lead for the minaret's roof who was married to Syria's ruler at the time. Attached to the Minaret of the Bride is the 18th-century replica of the 14th-century sundial built by Ibn al-Shatir.\n\nMinaret of Isa\nThe Minaret of Isa is around 77 meters (253 ft) in height and the tallest of the three minarets. Some sources claim it was originally built by the Abbasids in the 9th century. The main body of the current minaret was built by the Ayyubids in 1247, but the upper section was constructed by the Ottomans. The main body of the minaret is square-shaped and the spire is octagonal. It tapers to a point and is surmounted by a crescent (as are the other two minarets). Two covered galleries are situated in the main body and two open galleries are located on the spire. Islamic belief holds that Isa (Jesus) will descend from heaven during the time of the Fajr prayer and will pray behind the Mahdi. He will then confront the Antichrist. According to local Damascene tradition, relating from hadith, Isa will reach earth via the Minaret of Isa, hence its name. Ibn Kathir, a prominent 14th-century Muslim scholar, backed this notion.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nThe Minaret of Qaytbay was built by Qaytbay in 1488. He also commissioned its renovation due to the 1479 fire. The minaret displays strong Islamic-era Egyptian architectural influence typical of the Mamluk period. It is octagonal in shape and built in receding sections with three galleries. It is generally believed that both the Minaret of Jesus and the Western Minaret were built on the foundation of ancient Roman towers. In October 2025, nearly one year after the fall of the Assad regime, the name of Hafez al-Assad, which had been inscribed on the Qaytbay Minaret following earlier restoration works, was removed.\n\nInfluence on mosque architecture\nThe Umayyad Mosque is one of the few early mosques in the world to have maintained the same general structure and architectural features since its initial construction in the early 8th century. Its Umayyad character has not been significantly altered. Since its establishment, the mosque has served as a model for congregational mosque architecture in Syria as well as globally. According to Flood, \"the construction of the Damascus mosque not only irrevocably altered the urban landscape of the city, inscribing upon it a permanent affirmation of Muslim hegemony, but by giving the Syrian congregational mosque its definitive form it also transformed the subsequent history of the mosque in general.\" The influence of the Umayyad Mosque's ground plan can be found in many mosques in the historic Muslim world, such as the al-Azhar Mosque and Baybars Mosque in Cairo, the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, and the Bursa Grand Mosque and Edirne's Grand Mosque in Turkey.\n\nReligious significance\nAccording to some, the mosque is the fourth holiest site of Islam. A Christian tradition dating to the 6th century developed an association between the former cathedral structure and John the Baptist. Legend had it that his head was buried there. Ibn al-Faqih relays that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of John the Baptist, known as Yahya ibn Zakariya by Muslims. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.\nAccording to one hadith reported by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, the Great Mosque of Damascus is the site where Jesus will descend from heaven at his Second Coming, appearing on a \"white minaret\". Most Muslim theologians interpret this passage as symbolic rather than literal. In a study of Muslim sources, William Richard Oakes suggests that some aspects of this hadith could date from the late Umayyad period, when the mosque was built, rather than from Muhammad's time, when Damascus had not yet been conquered by Muslims.\nTwo shrines commemorating the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is also compared in Shi'a tradition to that of John the Baptist, exist within the building premises.\n\nSee also\nAblaq\nGreat Mosque of Aleppo\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nReligious significance of the Syrian region\nTimeline of Islamic history\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003). \"Syria in the times of Apollodorus of Damascus\".

      "summary": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.",

      "content": "جامع بني أمية الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الأموي، هو المسجد الذي أمر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من أشهر المساجد وأفخمها، وأحد عجائب الإسلام السبعة في العالم.\nبدأ بناء الجامع الأموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، وأوفد إمبراطور بيزنطة مئة فنان يوناني للمشاركة في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحالة والمؤرخين والأدباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور وأطروا بشكل خاص على زينة سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائية الملونة، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. إلا أن أغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى أُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بأنها «تمثل الصناعة الأهلية السورية وليس الفن اليوناني أو البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الأموي أيضًا بكونه أول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنية نتيجة طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسة يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. أما مئذنته الشمالية، وهي أقدم مآذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت أيضاً منارةً لمدينة دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتأمل والصلاة، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنة المربعة إلى سائر أنحاء سوريا وشمال إفريقيا والأندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من آثاره المسيحية سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانية في مدح المسيح على أحد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد أيضاً على الفتحة التي وضع فيها رأس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل إلى دمشق. وأُلحق بالمسجد مقبرة تضم رفات صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\nاحترقت أجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الأولى عام 1069م، والثانية على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثة عام 1893م. وكانت آخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.\n\nالموقع\nيقع الجامع الأموي في وسط مدينة دمشق القديمة، المنطقة المدرجة على لائحة التراث العالمي.\n\nالتاريخ\nقبل الإسلام\nيعود تاريخ المسجد الأموي في سورية إلى 1200 سنة قبل الميلاد، حيث كانت دمشق عاصمة لدولة آرام دمشق خلال العصر الحديدي. وقد كان آراميو غرب سوريا يعبدون «حدد الآرامي،» إله الخصب والرعد والمطر حسب معتقدهم، لذلك أقاموا معبداً مخصصاً له في موقع «المسجد الأموي» المعاصر. ولا يُعرف بالضبط كيف بدأ المعبد، لكن يعتقد أنه اتَّبع النموذج المعماري الكنعاني السامي التقليدي. وهو يشبه معبد القدس، ويتألف من فناء مسور وغرفة صغيرة للعبادة. وقد بقي حجر واحد من المعبد الآرامي يعود لحكم الملك حازائيل، وهو حالياً يُعرض في متحف دمشق الوطني.\nواصل معبد حدد الآرامي القيام بدوره المركزي في المدينة حتى غزا الرومان دمشق في عام 64م فأقاموا فيه معبداً للإله جوبيتر، فقاموا بإعادة تكوين وتوسيع المعبد تحت إشراف مهندس معماري وُلد في دمشق يدعى أبولودوروس، وهو من صمم ونفذ التصميم الجديد. وقد أُعجب السكان المحليين بتماثُل وأبعاد «معبد جوبيتر اليوناني الروماني.» وباستثناء زيادة حجم المبنى، حافظ الرومانيون على معظم تصميمه الأصلي، وتُرِك الفناء المسور سليماً إلى حد كبير. وأقيمت في وسط الفناء غرفة داخلية، وكان هناك برج واحد في كل من الزوايا الأربع للفناء. كما استخدمت الأبراج للطقوس تمشياً مع التقاليد الدينية السامية القديمة حيث قُدِّمت الأضاحي في الأماكن المرتفعة.\nأصبح المعبد الروماني الجديد السلطة التشريعية الدينية في مدينة دمشق بسبب حجمه الكبير، وكان الغرض من تشييده (وقد أصبح فيما بعد المركز الرئيسي للعبادة في الإمبراطورية الرومانية) أن يكون منافساً للمعبد العبري في القدس. وقد أضيف لـ«معبد جوبيتر» المزيد من الإضافات خلال الفترة الأولى من الحكم الروماني للمدينة، وأصبح أغلب كهنة المعبد أثرياء بسبب التبرعات التي كانوا يجمعونها من المواطنين الأثرياء في دمشق. وقد وُسِّعت البوابة الشرقية لفناء المعبد في عهد سيبتيموس سيفيروس (حكم 193-211 م).\nبحلول القرن الرابع للميلاد أصبح المعبد مشهوراً بسبب حجمه وجماله وفُصل عن المدينة بمجموعتين من الجدران. وكان الجدار الأول، الذي يعتبر الأكبر، يمتد على مساحة واسعة شملت السوق. أما الجدار الثاني فيحيط بحرم معبد جوبيتر الأصلي. وكان هذا المعبد الأكبر في سوريا الرومانية. وفي نهاية القرن الرابع للميلاد، تحديداً في عام 391، حُوِّل معبد جوبيتر إلى كاتدرائية القديس يوحنا بأمر من الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الأول (حكم بين 379 و395 للميلاد). لكن هذه الكاتدرائية المسيحية لم تكن مكرسة مباشرة ليوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى، وكُرِّست لاحقًا من القرن السادس للميلاد، إذ تشير الأسطورة المحلية أن رأس يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى - دُفن هناك. وكانت الكاتدرائية بمثابة مقر أسقف دمشق، الذي يحتل المرتبة الثانية ضمن بطريركية أنطاكية بعد البطريرك نفسه.\nولا تزال أطلال المعبد باقية في منطقة سوق الحريم وحتى منطقة القيمرية.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي وقيام المسجد\nفي عام 634، تمت محاصرة دمشق من طرف الجيوش الإسلامية بقيادة خالد بن الوليد، ونجح خالد بضمها للأراضي الإسلامية صلحا. بعد عقود من فتح دمشق، أصبحت الخلافة الإسلامية تحت حكم السلالة الأموية، الذين اختاروا دمشق لتكون العاصمة الإدارية للعالم الإسلامي. وقد كلف الخليفة الأموي السادس، الوليد بن عبد الملك (705–715م) الصناع والمهندسين، ببناء المسجد في موقع الكاتدرائية البيزنطية في عام 706 م. قبل هذا، كانت الكاتدرائية لا تزال قيد الاستخدام من طرف المسيحيين المحليين، ولكن قد شُيِّدت غرفة صلاة (المصلي) للمسلمين في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من المبنى. الوليد، الذي أشرف شخصياً على المشروع، أمر بهدم معظم الكاتدرائية، بما في ذلك المصلى، وغُيِّر تخطيط المبنى تماما، ليستخدم بصفته مسجداً كبيراً لصلاة الجماعة لمواطني دمشق ومعلماً دينياً لمدينة دمشق.احتج المسيحيون على هذه الخطوة، وردا على هذا الاحتجاج أمر الوليد باسترجاع جميع الكنائس المصادرة الأخرى في المدينة إلى المسيحيين كتعويض. واكتمل بناء المسجد في عام 715 م، بعد وقت قصير من وفاة الوليد، وخلفه سليمان بن عبد الملك (715–717م) في الحكم.\nووفقا لمؤرخ القرن العاشر ابن الفقيه، أُنفق ما بين 600 ألف و 1,000,000 دينار على المشروع، وقد اشتغل به حرفيون أقباط، فضلا عن عمال فارسيين وهنديين ويونانيين الذين يشكلون الجزء الأكبر من القوة العاملة التي تتألف من 12 ألف شخص. ويذكر ابن الفقيه أيضا أن العمال وجدوا مغارة تعود للكنيسة البيزنطية أثناء بناء المسجد، وكانت هذه المغارة تحتوي على صندوق يوجد به رأس القديس يوحنا المعمدان حسب المعتقد المسيحي، أو النبي يحيى بن زكريا في الإسلام. فأمر الوليد بتركه على حاله، وجعل عمودا قائما على المغارة كعلامة مميزة ثم وضع فوقه تابوت عليه اسم النبي يحيى.\n\nفي أعقاب الانتفاضة التي أنهت حكم الأمويين عام 750م على يد العباسيين، وأصبحت الخلافة الإسلامية تحت حكم السلالة العباسية الذين قاموا نقل عاصمة الخلافة من دمشق إلى بغداد. وبصرف النظر عن موقع دمشق الإستراتيجي والتجاري، لم يكن للعباسيون مصالح في دمشق. وبالتالي، فإن المسجد الأموي قد عانى في بداية حكمهم، مع القليل من نشاط البناء المسجل بين القرنين 8 و 10 . ومع ذلك، فإن العباسيين نظروا للمسجد ليكون رمزا رئيسيا لانتصار الإسلام، وبالتالي نجا المسجد من منهجية القضاء على تركة الأمويين في مدينة دمشق. . وقام الفضل بن صالح بن علي الحاكم العباسي في دمشق، ببناء قبة في القسم الشرقي من المسجد في 780م. وبعد تسع سنوات، بدأ بتشييد قبة الخزينة بغرض إدخار أموال المسجد  وجاء في مذكرات الجغرافي المقدسي، أن العباسيين قاموا ببناء المئذنة الشمالية («مئذنة العروس») من المسجد في عام 831 في عهد الخليفة المأمون (813-833). وقد أمر المأمون بإزالة واستبدال النقوش الأموية في المسجد.\nبحلول القرن 10م، رُكِّبت ساعة ضخمة عند المدخل في الجزء الغربي من الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد (باب زيادة) ويبدو أن هذه الساعة قد توقفت عن عملها بحلول منتصف القرن 12م.\n\nأصبح الحكم العباسي على بلاد الشام متداعيا خلال القرن 10، وفي العقود التي تلت ذلك، أصبحت بلاد الشام خاضعة لحكم الأمراء المحليين، وكانت تابعة للخلافة العباسية اسميا فقط. وفي عام 970م، قام الفاطميون من مصر، بغزوا دمشق، وأجرى الفاطميون بعض التحسينات المسجلة للمسجد. وسمح لسكان دمشق بممارسة مذهبهم السني داخل الجامع الأموي في سكان، وتمكينهم من الحفاظ على الاستقلال النسبي من السلطة الدينية الفاطمية الشيعية. وفي 1069، دُمِّرت أجزاء كبيرة من المسجد، خاصة الجدار الشمالي، في حريق نتيجة لانتفاضة سكان مدينة دمشق ضد الجيش الفاطمي بسبب الاعتداءات من طرف الثكنات الفاطمية في حق سكان دمشق.\n\nعصر السلاجقة والأيوبيين\nفي سنة 1078م، استعاد سلاجقة الأتراك مدينة دمشق من أيدي الفاطميين، وأصبحت دمشق تابعة للخلافة العباسية اسميا فقط. وشرع الملك السلجوقي تتش بن ألب أرسلان (حكم 1079-1095) لإصلاح الأضرار الناجمة عن الحريق الذي أصاب المسجد سنة 1069، وفي عام 1082م، قام أبو نصر أحمد بن الفضل وزير تتش السلجوقي، بإعادة تشييد القبة المركزية في شكل أكثر إثارة؛ وقام أيضا بترميم اثنين من الأرصفة دعم وتجديد الفسيفساء الأموية الأصلية من الواجهة الداخلية الشمالية للمسجد. وأعيد بناء الرواق الشمالي في عام 1089م. وفي عام 1110م، قام ظاهر الدين طغتكين (حكم 1104-1128) وهو أحد أتابكة السلاجقة في دمشق، بإصلاح الجدار الشمالي وخُصص نقشان له أدرجا فوق مدخل. وفي عام 1113، اُغتيل شرف الدين مودود (حكم 1109-1113) أحد أتابكة السلاجقة في الموصل في الجامع الأموي. وبما أن الصراع بين دمشق والصليبيين زاد في منتصف القرن 12م، كان المسجد الأموي بمثابة نقطة التجمع الرئيسية لدعوة المسلمين للدفاع عن المدينة واستعادة القدس إلى أيدي المسلمين. ويُعتبر ابن عساكر أحد الأئمة البارزين الذي بشروا بالجهاد، وعندما تقدم الصليبيون نحو دمشق سنة 1148، استجاب سكان المدينة لدعوات المطالبة بالجهاد؛ وعلى إثر هذا انسحب الجيش الصليبي نتيجة المقاومة البطولية لسكان دمشق.\n\nوفي عام 1154 م، خلال عهد نور الدين زنكي، بنيت ساعة أثرية ثانية، وساعة جيرون المائية، بأوامر شخصية من نور الدين. وشيدت الساعة من خارج المدخل الشرقي للمسجد (باب جيرون) من قبل وأعاد بناؤها المعماري محمد الساعاتي، بعد حريق أصاب المسجد في عام 1167، كما رُمِّمت في نهاية المطاف على يد ابنه، رضوان، في أوائل القرن 13. وقد نجت من حريق في القرن 14. وقد زار الجغرافي العربي الإدريسي المسجد الأموي عام 1154.\nوفي العهد الأيوبي شهدت دمشق إنشاء العديد من المؤسسات الدينية، وأُبقي على الجامع الأموي في مكانه كمركز للحياة الدينية في المدينة. ووصف الرحالة الأندلسي ابن جبير أهمية المسجد كمركز شامل للعلوم الدينية، نظرا لاحتوائه العديد من الزوايا المختلفة للدراسات الدينية والقرآنية. وفي عام 1173، تعرض الجدار الشمالي للمسجد مرة أخرى لأضرار بسبب اندلاع حريق، وأعيد بناؤه من قبل السلطان الأيوبي صلاح الدين (حكم 1174-1193)، جنبا إلى جنب مع مئذنة العروس، التي كانت قد دمرت في الحريق الذي وقع سنة 1069م، وخلال النزاعات الداخلية بين الأمراء الأيوبيين لاحقًا، تعرضت مدينة دمشق بسب هذه النزاعات لأضرار كبيرة، وفي عام 1245م، دُمِّرت المئذنة الشرقية للمسجد المعروفة بمئذنة عيسى على يد الصالح أيوب سابع خلافاء بني أيوب بمصر، في أثناء محاصرته لدمشق في عهد الصالح إسماعيل الأمير الأيوبي لدمشق. وقد أعيد بناء المئذنة لاحقًا مع إضافة زخرفة قليلة لها.\nدُفن صلاح الدين الأيوبي مع العديد من خلفائه، حول المسجد الأموي.\n\nدولة المماليك\nوفي عام 1260م. تحالف المغول، بقيادة كتبغا مع القوات الصليبية، واستولوا على دمشق من الأيوبيين، وقد أمر بوهيموند السادس أمير إمارة أنطاكية، بإقامة القداس الكاثوليكي في «المسجد الأموي». ومع ذلك، استطاع المماليك بقيادة قطز وبيبرس، استرجاع مدينة دمشق لاحقًا في نفس العام. وفي عام 1270، أمر بيبرس بترميمات واسعة النطاق للمسجد، لا سيما الرخام والفسيفساء والايرمينيه. ووفقا لكاتب سيرة بيبرس، ابن شداد، أن تكلفة ترميمات التي أقيمت في عهد بيبرس بلغت 20,000 ديناراً. وكان من بين أكبر الشظايا التي أضيفت للمسجد هي قطعة فسيفساء يبلغ طولها 34.5 متر وعرضها 7.3 متر، وقد أقيمت هذه الفسيفساء في الرواق الغربي وتسمى لوحة بردى. وكانت هذه القطعة من الفسيفساء التي زينت المسجد جزء من مشروع الترميم الذي شمل المسجد، وكان لها تأثير كبير في عمارة المماليك في مصر والشام.\nفي عام 1285م، بدأ العالم ابن تيمية بتدريس تفسير القرآن في المسجد. وفي عام 1300م، قام إلخانية المغول بقيادة محمود غازان بغزو مدينة دمشق، فقام ابن تيمية بحثّ مواطني دمشق على الجهاد ومقاومة الاحتلال. واستطاع المماليك بقيادة قلاوون بطرد المغول لاحقًا من تلك السنة. وعندما دخلت قوات قلاوون إلى المدينة، حاول المغول إقامة عدة مجانيق في «المسجد الأموي» لكن محاولتهم باءت بالفشل. وشرع المماليك بحرق المجانيق قبل أن توضع في المسجد.\nوفي الأعوام الممتدة مابين 1326-1328م، قام الوالي المملوكي في الشام، تانكيز، بأعمال ترميم في المسجد، وأمر بإعادة تجميع لوحات الفسيفساء على جدار القبلة واستبدال كل البلاط في قاعة الصلاة بالرخام. كما قام السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون بأعمال ترميم رئيسية للمسجد في عام 1328. وقد هدمت قبلة الجدار غير المستقرة وأُعيد بناؤها ونُقلت بوابة باب زيادة إلى الجهة الشرقية من المسجد. وقد تضرر جزء كبير من هذه الأعمال خلال الحريق الذي أحرق المسجد في عام 1339. وقد وصف خبير الفن الإسلامي، فينبار ب.فلوود. دور المماليك البحرية في إعادة ترميم المسجد الأموي بالهوس، وجهودهم في صيانة وإصلاح واستعادة المسجد كانت لا مثيل لها في أي فترة أخرى من حكم الإسلامي لدمشق. وقد قضى عالم الفلك العربي ابن الشاطر معظم حياته في وظيفة التوقيت ورئاسة المؤذنين في الجامع الأموي من عام 1332 حتى وفاته في عام 1376. وقد قيل أنه قام بتنصيب مزولة كبيرة على المئذنة الشمالية للمسجد في عام 1371. وفي عام 1392م احترقت مئذنة عيسى خلال حريق أصاب المسجد عام 1392م .\nوفي عام 1400، غزا تيمور دمشق. وأصدر أوامره بإحراق المدينة يوم 17 آذار/مارس، وقد دمر الحريق أجزاء كبيرة من المسجد الأموي. وانهارت المئذنة الشرقية والقبة المركزية. ورُمِّمت لاحقًا، وأضيفت مئذنة في جهة الجنوب الغربي من المسجد خلال عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488م.\n\nالدولة العثمانية\nفي عام 1516م، سيطر العثمانيون على دمشق بقيادة سليم الأول بعد انتصارهم على المماليك في معركة مرج دابق. وحضر سليم الأول لتأدية صلاة الجمعة في الجامع الأموي . واستخدم العثمانيون نظام الوقف للمواقع الدينية كوسيلة لربط السكان المحليين مع السلطة المركزية. وكان وقف الجامع الأموي هو الأكبر في المدينة، ووظِّف 596 شخص. وخُصصت أغلب الوظائف الإشرافية والكتابية للمسؤولين العثمانيين في حين خُصصت المكاتب الدينية في الغالب للعلماء المحليين. على الرغم من أن الأوقاف تخضع للضريبة، فقدأُعفي الجامع الأموي منها. وفي عام 1518، قام جانبيردي الغزالي الوالي العثماني لدمشق والمشرف العام لوقف المسجد، بعمليات إصلاح وتزيين المسجد كجزء من برنامجه بإعادة إعمار مدينة دمشق.\nوفي عام 1661م عُيِّن الباحث الصوفي البارز عبد الغني النابلسي للتدريس في المسجد الأموي.\n\nوفي عام 1893م شب حريق أدى إلى تدمير معظم الفسيفساء والألواح الرخامية، ولكن أُعيدا في وقت لاحق. وقد دمر الحريق أيضا النسيج الداخلي لقاعة الصلاة وتسبب في انهيار القبة الوسطى للمسجد. والسبب الرئيسي لهذا الحريق هو أحد العمال الذين كانوا يقومون بأعمال ترميم للمسجد، وقد كان هذا العامل يقوم بطريق الخطأ بتدخين النارجيلة. وقد قام العثمانيون بإعادة تشييد كامل المسجد، ولكن اُحتفظ بالهيكل الأصيل احتفاظاً كبيراً.\nوفي عام 1899م، أعطيت معظم محتويات قبة الخزنة إلى الإمبراطور الألماني فيلهلم الثاني واُحتفظ بعدد قليل من القطع في الأرشيف الوطني في دمشق\"\n\nسوريا الحديثة\nالانتداب الفرنسي\nفي عام 1929، كان أهالي دمشق يجتمعون في الجامع الأموي كل جمعة، ليقوموا بمظاهرات منددة ضد سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي، ولم يقتحم الفرنسيون الجامع طيلة وجودهم في سوريا لمعرفتهم بمكانة الجامع الأموي عند أهل الشام.\nوقد خضع المسجد الأموي لترميمات كبرى خلال الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا، واستمرت حتى عام 1963 في ظل الجمهورية السورية الأولى.\n\nما بعد الاستعمار\nفي الثمانينات وفي أوائل التسعينات، أمر الرئيس السوري حافظ الأسد بعملية تجديد واسعة النطاق للمسجد. وشملت الترميمات المئذنة الغربية للمسجد (مئذنة قيتابي) والواجة الغربية للجامع، والجدار الشمالي للجامع المطل على ضريح صلاح الدين، كما أعيد تبليط المدخل الغربي للجامع، وتجديد الأرضيات وتبديل القواعد الحجرية التالفة للأعمدة، ومعالجة الخشبيات التالفة وترميم وإصلاح الصالات وإعادة إنشاء وتركيب قبة داخل صحن الجامع، إضافةً لإنشاء شبكة إطفاء خاصة بالمسجد.\nوقد انتهت أعمال الترميم والإصلاح في سنة 1414هـ / 1994م، وأعيد افتتاح المسجد.\nوفي عام 2001، زار البابا يوحنا بولس الثاني المسجد، لرؤية أثار مقام يوحنا المعمدان. وكانت هذه هي المرة الأولى التي يقوم فيها البابا بزيارة إلى مسجد.\nوفي 15 مارس 2011، بدأت أول الاحتجاجات التي تتعلق بالحرب الأهلية السورية في المسجد الأموي عندما اجتمع مابين 40-50 مصلٍّ، حيث قام المتظاهرون برفع شعارات تطالب بالديمقراطية. لكن قوات الأمن السورية قامت بقمع الاحتجاجات بسرعة، وطُوِّق المسجد خلال صلاة الجمعة لمنع ظهور مظاهرات الواسعة النطاق.\n\nالعمارة\nالفناء وحرم الجامع\nأرضية المسجد الأموي هي مستطيلة الشكل وهي بقياس 97 متر عرض و 156 متر طول. ويحتل الفناء الجزء الأكبر من المسجد وهو يغطي الجزء الخارجي الشمالي من المسجد، في حين يغطي حرم الجامع الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. ويحيط فناء المسجد أربعة جدران خارجية. أما الأرصفة الحجرية للفناء فقد أصبحت متفاوتة بمرور الزمن بسبب الإصلاحات التي مر بها المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وقد سُويَّت مؤخرًا. أما الأروقة المحيطة بالفناء فقد دُعِمت بأعمدة حجرية وأرصفة بشكل متناوب. ويوجد رصيف واحد بين كل عمودين. نظراً لأن الجزء الشمالي من الفناء قد دمر في زلزال وقع في عام 1759، كما أن الممرات ليست متسقة؛ ويرجع ذلك لعدم وجود الأعمدة التي كانت تدعم ذلك، عندما أعيد بناء الجدار الشمالي. كما يوجد أيضاً داخل صحن الجامع عمودان ذوو رأس نحاسي مزخرف كانا يستعملان للإضاءة.\nوتتكون المساحة الداخلية من الحرم من ثلاثة أروقة. وهي موازية لاتجاه الصلاة نحو مكة المكرمة. ودُعِمت الأروقة بصفين من الأعمدة الكورنثية. وكل واحد من هذه الأروقة ينقسم إلى مستويين. ويتألف المستوى الأول من أقواس نصف دائرية كبيرة، في حين أن المستوى الثاني يتكون من أقواس مزدوجة. ويتكرر هذا النمط في أروقة الفناء. أما الأروقة الداخلية الثلاثة تتقاطع في وسط الحرم مع رواق كبير، يوازي جدار القبلة («اتجاه الصلاة») ويواجه المحراب والمنبر. وينقسم الجناح المركزي في الأروقة إلى نصفين ويتكون من أحد عشر قوسًا. والحرم الشريف هو بقياس 136 متر طول و37 متر عرض.\nكما يوجد داخل فناء الجامع ثلاث منشئات صغيرة وهي:\n\nقبة الخزنة\n\nأنشئت قبة الخزنة بداية في العهد العباسي في عام 789م، واستخدمت كخزنة لأموال الجامع، ومن ثم أصبحت مكتبة لكتب ومخطوطات الجامع النفيسة.\n\nقبة الوضوء\nأنشئت قبة الوضوء بداية في العهد العباسي، وانهارت بعد وقوع زلزال في عام 1759م، وقد جددت في العهد العثماني بأمر من والي دمشق عثمان باشا الكرجي، وتقع في وسط الفناء وهي مجوفة مثمنة من رخام قائمة على أربعة أعمدة رخامية في وسطها أنبوب ماء من النحاس يمج الماء إلى الأعلى.\n\nقبة الساعات\nتقع في الجهة الشرقية من فناء الجامع الأموي، ويعود تاريخها إلى العهد العثماني، أما عن تسميتها بقبة الساعات، فيعود إلى العصر العثماني الذي نقل إليها الساعات الموجودة على باب الجامع، وجعل منها مركز التوقيت.\n\nالمحاريب\nيوجد أربعة محاريب على خط جدار الحرم، وأهمها محراب الصحابة الكبير الذي يقع تقريبًا في وسط الجدار. ويقع محراب صحابة النبي في النصف الشرقي. ووفقا للمهندس العباسي موسى بن شاكر، بُني المحراب الأخير خلال مرحلة التشييد الأولى للمسجد، وأصبح المحراب ثالث محراب متخصص في تاريخ الإسلام. وهو أقدم محراب في المسجد، حيث كان يصلي المسلمين قبل إنشاء المسجد، ويسمى أيضاً محراب المالكية. أما المحاريب الباقية فهي:\n\nمحراب الخطيب\nمحراب الحنفية\nمحراب الحنابلة\n\nواجهة الحرم\nزُيين الفناء والحرم الشريف للجامع الأموي بواجهة فخمة تزيد المسجد فخامة ووقاراً معروفة بواجهة الحرم، وتقع في الجهة الجنوبية من المسجد، وتطل على الفناء والذي يضم 25 باباً خشبياً تنفتح مباشرة على الحرم.\nويعتقد المؤرخون أن واجهة الحرم كانت مماثلة للأسلوب والنمط المعماري لبقية الأروقة من حيث تناوب العضائد والأعمدة، وأعيد بناء الواجهة من غير أعمدة بعد حريق وقع عام 1067، وحلَّ محل هذه الأعمدة عضائد يرتفع في منتصفها كتلة فخمة مازالت على وضعها الأموي الأصلي، وتتألف هذه الكتلة من ثلاثة أبواب بقناطر نصف دائرية ترتكز على عضادتين يتوسطهما عمودان، وفوق هذه الأبواب الثلاثة قوس كبير يحتوي ثلاثة نوافذ.\nوقد وُضِع على جانبي هذه الكتلة برجان صغيران تعلوهما قبتان صغيرتان من الرصاص فوقهما ثلاث تفاحات وهلال من النحاس.\nوفي عهد الوليد كانت هذه الواجهة بما فيها مكسوّة بـالفسيفساء، سقط معظمها إثر الحرائق والزلازل التي أصابت المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وبقيت على حالها حتى الستينات من القرن الماضي حيث تمت عملية ترميم واستصناع الفسيفساء بإشراف وزارة الأوقاف والمديرية العامة للمتاحف، وكُسيت هذه الواجهة برسوم فسيفسائية مستوحاة من الأسلوب الأموي الأصيل.\n\nقبة النسر\nهي إحدى إنجازات الوليد بن عبد الملك وأكبر قبة في المسجد الأموي، وقد جددت هذه القبة في عهد نظام الملك وزير ملك شاه السلجوقي في عام 1075، وقام صلاح الدين الأيوبي بتجديد ركنين منها في عام 1179، واستبدلت القبة الخشبية الأصلية وبنائها من الحجر في أعقاب الحريق الذي وقع عام 1893.\nوتقع القبة فوق مركز قاعة الصلاة، بارتفاع 45 متر وقطرها 16 مترًا، وترتكز القبة على طبقة تحتية مثمنة مع اثنين من النوافذ المقوسة على جانبيها، ودُعِمت بأعمدة الممرات الداخلية المركزية.\nووصفها ابن جبير قائلا فيها:\n\nأما عن تسميتها بقبة النسر فيقول ابن جبير في كتابه أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم:\n\nالمآذن والمشاهد\nالمآذن\nيحتوي المسجد الأموي على ثلاث مآذن وهي مئذنة العروس و مئذنة النبي عيسى ومئذنة قايتباي.\n\nمئذنة العروس\nتعتبر مئذنة العروس أقدم مئذنة شيدت في المسجد، وتقع في الجدار الشمالي للمسجد. لكن تاريخ تشييدها الدقيق غير معروف. أما الجزء السفلي من المئذنة يعود إلى الحقبة العباسية في القرن التاسع حسب المراجع التي وصلتنا. وقد يكون العباسيون قد بنوها فوق المئذنة الأموية القديمة، ولكن لا يوجد دليل قطعي يؤكد أن مئذنة الجدار الشمالي (مئذنة العروس) كانت جزءًا من المسجد الأصلي الذي بناه الخليفة الوليد. وقد ذكر شمس الدين المقدسي في مذكراته أن المئذنة قد شيدت في أواخر القرن العاشر الميلادي، أثناء زيارته لموقع المئذنة خلال الحكم العباسي لدمشق في عام 985م حيث وصفها أنها شيدت مؤخرًا، أما الجزء العلوي من المئذنة شُيِّدَ في عام 1174. ويستخدم هذه المئذنة المؤذن للدعوة للصلاة، ويوجد درج لولبي يتكون من 160 درجة يؤدي بدوره إلى غرفة المؤذن.\n\nوتنقسم مئذنة العروس إلى قسمين؛ البرج الرئيسي متصل بمئذنة صغيرة ثانية من خلال ممر مسقوف ينتهي بشرفة خشبية مضلعة يعلوها قبة صنوبرية بتفاحات وهلال دائري. تعود إلى العصر المملوكي. ويعتبر البرج الرئيسي أقدم جزء من المئذنة، وهو مربع الشكل، له أربعة معارض، ويتألف من شكلين مختلفين من البناء؛ حيث تتكون القاعدة من كتل كبيرة، في حين بُني الجزء العلوي من الحجر. كما يوجد اثنين من فتحات الضوء بالقرب من أعلى البرج الرئيسي قبل السطح، مع أقواس على شكل حدوة الحصان مقوسنة تحت قوس واحد. وفي القرن 18 عُلِّقت مزولة أصلية تعود للقرن 14 التي بناها ابن الشاطر.\n\nمئذنة عيسى\nتقع مئذنة عيسى في الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية للمسجد الأموي، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي 77 متر، كما تعتبر أطول المآذن الثلاث. وتذكر بعض المصادر أن المئذنة بنيت من طرف العباسيين في القرن التاسع، بينما تعزو مصادر أخرى أن الهيكل الأصلي يعود للعهد الأموي، وقد ظلت مئدنة عيسى إحدى أطول 5 بنايات بشرية لأكثر من 400 عام، ما بين القرن 8 والقرن 12 م. وتنقسم المئذنة إلى قسمين متنافرين، حيث أن القسم السفلي بُنِى في العهد الأيوبي في عام 1247، بينما شيد القسم العلوي في العهد العثماني. الجزء السفلي للمئذنة هو على مربع الشكل وتحتوي على نوافذ عثمانية مقوسنة، شبيهة بنوافذ مئذنة العروس، أما الجزء العلوي فيأتي مباشرة وبانتقال غير متناسب هندسياً إلى جذع مثمن الأضلاع عثماني الطراز، يتضمن شرفتين للمؤذن بمقرنصات خفيفة بدون مظلات ساترة، ويعلو المئذنة قلنسوة مخروطية الشكل يعلوها ثلاث تفاحات وهلال كامل الاستدارة.\nأما عن سبب تسميتها بمئذنة عيسى، فهي بسبب الاعتقاد الشعبي السائد بأن النبي عيسى سينزل في آخر الزمان في هذا الموقع لمحاربة الدجال. ويدعم ابن كثير هذه الفكرة، وهو أحد العلماء المسلمين البارزين في القرن الرابع عشر.\n\nمئذنة قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنة قايتباي المعروفة أيضا بالمئذنة الغربية، في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488. وهي أحد أهم المعالم الإسلامية المصرية النموذجية في دمشق، في الفترة المملوكية، وتعتبر أول مئذنة شيدت في دمشق على هذا الطراز، والمئذنة هي مثمنة الشكل وتنقسم إلى ثلاثة أجزاء. ويوجد اعتقاد أن مئذنة عيسى ومئذنة قايتباي بنيا فوق أبراج رومانية قديمة، لكن بعض العلماء شككوا في صحة هذا الاعتقاد. في أكتوبر 2025، بعد مرور ما يقارب العام على سقوط نظام الأسد، أُزيل اسم حافظ الأسد الذي كان منقوشاً على مئذنة قايتباي عقب أعمال ترميم سابقة.\n\nالمشاهد\nالمشاهد هي عبارة عن صالات واسعة ضمن المسجد الأموي، وقد اختلفت وظيفتها باختلاف الزمن، ويحتوي الجامع الأموي بدمشق على أربعة مشاهد تقع على يمين ويسار البابين الشرقي والغربي، وسُميت بدايةً بأسماء الخلفاء الراشدين الأربعة وهي تتوزع كالتالي:\n\nمشهد أبي بكر\nيقع مشهد أبي بكر الصديق في الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية من المسجد الأموي ويستعمل الآن كمتحف للجامع.\n\nمشهد عمر\nيقع مشهد عمر بن الخطاب في الجهة الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأموي ويستعمل الآن كمقر لإدارة المسجد.\n\nمشهد عثمان\nيقع مشهد الخليفة عثمان بن عفان في الجهة الشمالية الغربية من المسجد ويستعمل الآن كقاعة شرف لاستقبال كبار الضيوف.\n\nمشهد علي والحسين\nيقع مشهد الخليفة علي بن أبي طالب في الزاوية الشمالية الشرقية من المسجد الأموي، ويحتوي على مزار ومقام رأس الإمام الحسين بن علي، وقد غلبت عليه تسمية مشهد الحسين.\n\nبئر الجامع\nيقع بئر الجامع في الحرم الشريف، ويقابل محراب الصحابة، ويعتبر البئر من أقدم منشآت الجامع، وقد أنشأ في حرم الجامع قبل توسعة الوليد، وقد شُيِّد بهدف تزويد المصلين بماء الوضوء والشرب. وقد حافظ الوليد على هذا البئر وأضاف إليه عمودين نفيسين مع توابعهما قدر ثمنهم بألف وخمس مئة دينار ذهبي، دفعها الوليد لخالد بن يزيد أثناء التجهيزات التي أجريت على البئر .\n\nأبواب الجامع\nيحتوي المسجد الأموي على أربعة أبواب رئيسية وهي:\n\nباب جيرون\nهو أحد أبواب الجامع الأموي الأربعة، ويقع على الحائط الشرقي للجامع ويقابل حي النوفرة، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير وإلى جانبيه بابان صغيران، أما عن تسميته بـ باب جيرون فتوجد عدة نظريات تشرح ذلك، فالمؤرخون العرب ينسبوه إلى جيرون بن سعد بن عاد، ويعتقد أنه هو الذي بنى مدينة جيرون التي سميت لاحقا بدمشق، ويوجد تحليل آخر للاسم وهو لغوي مشتق من الجذر جار، وهو للدلالة على الأحياء المجاورة، ويطلق على هذا الباب الآن أسم باب النوفرة نسبةً لـ حي النوفرة المقابل له.\n\nباب العمارة/باب الكلاسة\nهو أحد أبواب الجامع الأموي الأربعة، ويقع على الحائط الشمالي للجامع تحت مئذنة العروس من ناحية العمارة، وهو مؤلف من بوابة واحدة تطل على صحن فناء الجامع الأموي، وقد سُمي بعدة أسماء نذكر منها باب الفراديس، وباب الناطفانيين لكونه كان يطل على الحي المشهور بصناعة الناطف، ويسمى أيضا باب الكلاسة نسبة إلى حي الكلاسة المقابل له، ويعرف أيضاً بباب العمارة نسبةً لحي العمارة القريب منه.\n\nباب بريد\nهو أحد أبواب الجامع الأموي الأربعة، ويقع على الحائط الغربي للجامع مقابل ساحة المسكية، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير وإلى جانبيه بابان صغيران، كما أن باب بريد يقابل باب جيرون، ويشرح المؤرخون العرب هذه التسمية بأن بريد هو شقيق جيرون، وهو ابن عاد بن عوص بن إرم بن سام بن نوح وقد سميت البوابتان الرئيستان باسمهما، ويطلق على هذا الباب أيضا اسم باب المسكية نسبةً لسوق المسكية المقابل له.\n\nباب الزيادة\nهو أحد أبواب الجامع الأموي الأربعة، ويقع في الجهة الغربية من الحائط الجنوبي مقابل سوق الصاغة، وهو الباب الوحيد المؤدي مباشرة لحرم المسجد، وقد سُمي بهذا الاسم لكونه أُحدث زيادةً في سور المعبد عند بناء الجامع في عهد الوليد، ويعرف أيضاً باسم باب الساعات في نهاية الألفية الأولى حيث وصفه ابن عساكر بقوله:\n\nوقد زود الجامع الأموي في كل العهود بساعة شمسية، وساعة فلكية، وساعات أخرى، اختلفت أشكالها وأحجامها باختلاف العصور، وقد اشتهرت منها ساعة وصفها بدقة الرحالة ابن جبير قائلاً:\n\nوفي عام 1200، انتقلت هذه الساعات إلى باب جيرون، وانتقلت هذه التسمية أيضاً إلى باب جيرون.\nويعرف باب الزيادة الآن باسم باب الصاغة نسبةً لسوق الصاغة المقابل له. ويسمى أيضا بـ باب القوافين نسبة إلى سوق القوافين القديم وحي القوافين الذي كان موجوداً هناك آنذاك.\n\nالتأثيرات الهندسية على المسجد\nالمسجد الأموي هو أحد المساجد القليلة في العالم الإسلامي التي حافظت على نفس الهيكل العام والمعالم المعمارية، منذ بنائه الأول في أوائل القرن الثامن، وطابعه الأموي لم يتغير إلى حد كبير. ومنذ إنشائه استعمل المسجد لتأدية صلاة الجماعة في سوريا، ووفقًا للمؤرخ فينبار باري فلوود، فإن «بناء مسجد دمشق لم يغير المشهد الحضري لمدينة دمشق فقط، بل أكد أثر هيمنة العمارة الأموية في العالم الإسلامي، وأضاف المسجد الأموي في دمشق بعدا أخر في عمارة المساجد في سوريا والعالم الإسلامي بشكل عام». ومن أمثلة المساجد التي تأثرت بالمسجد الأموي كنموذج أولي هي:\n\nالجامع الأزهر\nمسجد بيبرس في القاهرة\nالمسجد الكبير في قرطبة في إسبانيا\nالمسجد الكبير في مدينة بورصة\nجامع السليمية في تركيا.\n\nخطباء الجامع الأموي\nاعتلى سدة منبر الجامع وإمامة المصلين فيه، عدد من أشهر علماء بلاد الشام عبر التاريخ، منهم:\n\nعلماء عائلة الخطيب الحسني\nالشيخ عبد القادر الخطيب\nأحمد معاذ الخطيب\nمحمد سعيد رمضان البوطي وابنه من بعده\n\nمعرض الصور\nالمراجع\nهوامش\nوصلات خارجية\n\nجولة افتراضية ثلاثية الأبعاد في المسجد الأموي\nالجامع الأموي - وزارة السياحة السورية\nصور

      "summary": "جامع بني أمية الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الأموي، هو المسجد الذي أمر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من أشهر المساجد وأفخمها، وأحد عجائب الإسلام السبعة في العالم.\nبدأ بناء الجامع الأموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، وأوفد إمبراطور بيزنطة مئة فنان يوناني للمشاركة في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحالة والمؤرخين والأدباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور وأطروا بشكل خاص على زينة سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائية الملونة، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. إلا أن أغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى أُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بأنها «تمثل الصناعة الأهلية السورية وليس الفن اليوناني أو البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الأموي أيضًا بكونه أول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنية نتيجة طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسة يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. أما مئذنته الشمالية، وهي أقدم مآذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت أيضاً منارةً لمدينة دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتأمل والصلاة، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنة المربعة إلى سائر أنحاء سوريا وشمال إفريقيا والأندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من آثاره المسيحية سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانية في مدح المسيح على أحد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد أيضاً على الفتحة التي وضع فيها رأس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل إلى دمشق. وأُلحق بالمسجد مقبرة تضم رفات صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\nاحترقت أجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الأولى عام 1069م، والثانية على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثة عام 1893م. وكانت آخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.",
