      "content": "Bosra (Arabic: بُصْرَىٰ, romanized: Buṣrā), formerly Bostra (Greek: Βόστρα) and officially called Busra al-Sham (Arabic: بُصْرَىٰ ٱلشَّام, romanized: Buṣrā al-Shām), is a town in southern Syria, administratively belonging to the Daraa District of the Daraa Governorate and geographically part of the Hauran region.\nBosra is an ancient city mentioned in 14th century BC Egyptian sources. A key Nabatean city, it became the prosperous provincial capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea following the dissolution of the Nabatean kingdom. With the advent of Christianity Bostra flourished as a Metropolitan Archbishopric under the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. It also became a Latin Catholic titular see and the episcopal see of a Melkite Catholic Archeparchy.\nThroughout its history under various Muslim rulers the city maintained its strategic importance as Syria's southern gateway. It attracted attention from Damascus' rulers and was governed by various lords, serving as a hub for Islamic learning and endowments. However it declined into a village during the Ottoman era, only to be revitalized in the 20th century with the construction of the Hijaz railway and growing archaeological interest, later prompting tourism-focused development by the Syrian government. Today it is a major archaeological site and has been declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\nAccording to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Bosra had a population of 19,683 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the nahiyah (\"subdistrict\") of Bosra, which consisted of nine localities with a total population of 33,839 in 2004. Bosra's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslim, although the town has a small Shia Muslim community.\n\nHistory\nBosra was the first Nabatean city in the 2nd century BC. The Nabatean Kingdom was conquered by Cornelius Palma, a general of Trajan, in 106 AD.\nAccording to John Malalas it was called Bostra (Ancient Greek: Βόστρα) after Bostras, a Roman general who was dispatched to the country.\n\nRoman period\nUnder the Roman Empire Bosra was renamed Nova Trajana Bostra and was the residence of the legio III Cyrenaica. It was made capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. The city flourished and became a major metropolis at the juncture of several trade routes, in particular the Via Traiana Nova, a Roman road that connected Damascus to the Red Sea. It became an important centre for food production and during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab Bosra began to mint its own coins. The two Councils of Arabia were held at Bosra in 246 and 247 AD.  The Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud mention Bosra as a town on the border outside Israel, but with a sizeable Jewish population. In the Jerusalem Talmud, it states that Resh Lakish was in Bosra when he saw them sprinkling water to the goddess Aphrodite.  In the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Avoda Zara (58b) it likewise mentions how Resh Lakish interacted with the population in Bosra. There are also rabbis who were identified as the sage from Bosra, such as Rabbi Jonah of Bosra.  The Talmud (Shabbat 29b) also notes that there was a synagogue in Bosra.\n\nByzantine period\nBy the Byzantine period, which began in the 5th century, Christianity had become the dominant religion in Bosra (Βόσρα in Greek-Byzantine). The city became a Metropolitan archbishop's seat (see below) and a large cathedral was built in the 6th century. Bosra was conquered by the Sasanian Persians in the early 7th century but was recaptured during the Byzantine reconquest.\n\nIslamic era\nBosra played an important part in the early life of Muhammad, as described in the entry for the Christian monk Bahira. The forces of the Rashidun Caliphate under general Khalid ibn al-Walid captured the city from the Byzantines in the Battle of Bosra in 634. Throughout Islamic rule Bosra would serve as the southernmost outpost of Bilad al-Sham, its prosperity being mostly contingent on the political importance of that city. Bosra held additional significance as a centre of the pilgrim caravan between Damascus and the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the destinations of the annual hajj pilgrimage. Early Islamic rule did not alter the general architecture of Bosra, with only two structures dating to the Umayyad era (721 and 746) when Damascus was the capital of the Caliphate. As Bosra's inhabitants gradually converted to Islam the Roman-era holy sites were utilized for Muslim practices. In the 9th century, Ya'qubi wrote that Bosra was the capital of the Hauran province.\n\nAfter the end of the Umayyad era in 750, major activity in Bosra ceased for around 300 years until the late 11th century. In the last years of Fatimid rule, in 1068, a number of building projects were commissioned. With the advent of Seljuk rule in 1076 increasing focus was paid to Bosra's defences. In particular the Roman theatre was transformed into a fortress, with a new floor added to the interior staircase tower. With the coming to power of the Burid dynasty in Damascus, the general Kumushtakin was allotted the entireHauran plain as a fief by the atabeg Tughtakin. Under Kumushtakin, efforts to enhance the Muslim nature of the city increased with the construction of a number of Islamic edifices. One of these projects was the restoration of the Umari Mosque, which had been built by the Umayyads in 721. Another mosque commissioned was the smaller al-Khidr Mosque at the northwestern part of the city, which was established under Kumushtakin in 1134. Kumushtakin also had a madrasa constructed alongside the Muslim shrine honoring the mabrak an-naqa (\"camel's knees\"), which marked the imprints of the camel the prophet Muhammad rode on when he entered Bosra in the early 7th century. In 1147 King Baldwin III of Jerusalem led a Crusader force to capture the city but his attempt was thwarted since the Damascene army led by Mu'in ad-Din Unur managed to garrison Bosra's citadel.\nA golden age of political and architectural activity in Bosra began during the reign of Ayyubid sultan al-Adil I (1196–1218). One of the first architectural developments in the city was the construction of eight large external towers in the Roman theatre-turned-fortress. The project began in 1202 and was completed in 1253, towards the end of the Ayyubid period. The two northern corner towers alone occupied more space than the remaining six. After al-Adil's death in 1218 his son as-Salih Ismail inherited the fief of Bosra and lived in its newly fortified citadel. During Ismail's rule Bosra gained political prominence. Ismail used the city as his base when he claimed the sultanate in Damascus on two separate occasions, reigning between 1237–38 and 1239–45.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596 Bosra appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Nafs Busra, being part of the nahiyah of Bani Nasiyya in the Qada of Hauran. It had a Muslim population consisting of 75 households and 27 bachelors, and a Christian population of 15 households and 8 bachelors. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit- or other trees,  goats and/or beehives and water mill.\nWhen James Silk Buckingham visited Bosra in 1816, he described \"a large ruined edifice, which was originally an oblong square, with one semicircular end,\" containing \"a miserable work of the Greek Christians, by whom it was no doubt used as a place of worship up to the period of its destruction.\" He also noted \"an old building, with a high square tower attached to it… with many Arabic inscriptions in different parts of it,\" as well as another plain building \"with crosses sculptured in the doors and walls, and the whole appearance that of an early place of Christian worship.\" Among the structures of Bosra he was shown was the Serait-el-Bint-el-Yahoodi or \"Palace of the Jew's Daughter,\" though he could not \"learn the origin of this name, or obtain an account of any tradition connected with it.\" He remarked further on the El-Hamam bath, with pointed arches in alternating black and white stone, and on \"a large building entirely constructed out of the ruins of more ancient edifices,\" containing \"Cufic, Arabic, and Greek\" inscriptions and \"a mixture of antiquity and freshness, of wealth and poverty, of skill and ignorance.\" He described ascending a great square tower of sixty-four steps, with stone doors on its stages and an open space at the top, from which \"we enjoyed a commanding view of the ruins of Bosra.\" Buckingham also saw \"a Roman arched gateway, not unlike that of Jerash,\" Corinthian colonnades standing in the town's streets, and the castle of Bosra, which he thought showed \"a mixture of styles which rendered it exceedingly difficult to say in what age or by what people they were constructed,\" containing Roman sculpture and Arabic inscriptions dated to 722 AH.\nAccording to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Busra had a total population of 26.355, consisting of 22.485 Muslims, 3.096 Orthodox Greeks, 594 Catholic Greeks, and 180 Protestants.\n\nModern era\nToday Bosra is a major archaeological site, containing ruins from Roman, Byzantine and Muslim times, its main feature being the well-preserved Roman theatre. Every year a national music festival is held in the main theatre.\nSignificant social and economic changes have affected Bosra since the end of the French Mandate in 1946. Whereas until the 1950s the shopkeepers of Bosra were from Damascus, since then most have lived in the town. In the late Ottoman era and the French Mandate period the agricultural relationship was between the small landowner and the sharecroppers, but since the agrarian reforms in the late 1950s and 1960s the relevant relationship has been between the landowners and the wage laborers. Many of its residents have found work in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, sending the proceeds to their relatives in Bosra. Social changes and increased access to education have largely diminished traditional clan life according to historian Hanna Batatu.\nDuring the presidency of Hafez al-Assad (1970–2000), Bosra and the surrounding villages were largely free of government interference and for the most part were politically dominated by members of the prominent al-Mokdad clan, who served as intermediaries of sorts between the residents of the town and the governor of Daraa and the Ba'ath Party branch secretary.\nOn 14 October 2012, there was intense gunfire from government forces stationed at checkpoints on the main road running through the town. On 13 November 2012, fierce fighting was reported in the east of the town. By January 2013, after 22 months of conflict during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, some refugees fleeing Bosra were speaking of escalating violence, with many bodies being left in the streets. On 15 January 2013, it was reported that the citadel was used by the army to shell the town on a daily basis. After the beginning of February 2014 the city was under the control of the Syrian Army. However on 31 January 2015, the Army's 5th Division confronted a contingent from the rebels near the famous Roman theatre – fierce firefights broke out between the groups. On 1 February 2015, the Army forces shelled areas in the east of the town. On 25 March 2015, Syrian rebels seized the town, ousting Syrian soldiers and allied militiamen after four days of intense battle.\nBosra was recaptured by the Syrian Arab Army on 2 July 2018 following the surrender of the rebel forces. The recapture was a part of the Daraa Offensive, which involved the surrender and/or reconciliation of many rebel groups in the area.\n\nLandmarks\nOf the city that once counted 80,000 inhabitants there remains today only a village among the ruins. The 2nd-century Roman theatre of Bosra, constructed probably under Trajan, is the only monument of this type with its upper gallery in the form of a covered portico fully preserved. It was fortified between 481 and 1231.\nThere are also Nabatean and Roman monuments, Christian churches, mosques, and Madrasahs within the half-ruined enceinte of the city. The structure of the cathedral, a central plan with eastern apses flanked by two sacristies, exerted a decisive influence on the evolution of Christian architectural forms and to a certain extent on Islamic style. Al-Omari Mosque of Bosra is one of the oldest surviving mosques in Islamic history.\nClose by are the Kharaba Bridge and the Gemarrin Bridge, both Roman bridges.\n\nClimate\nBosra has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). Rainfall is higher in winter than in summer. The average annual temperature in Bosra is 16.4 °C (61.5 °F). About 247 mm (9.72 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nDemographics\nIn the late 1990s, Bosra had an estimated population of 12,000. Its population increased to 19,683 according to the 2004 census by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics. The population of its metropolitan area was 33,839.\nBosra's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims and are mostly divided between seven major clans. The leading clan is the al-Miqdad whose members immigrated to Bosra from al-Suwayda in the mid-18th-century. During this era they also dominated the nearby villages of Ghasm, Maaraba and Samaqiyat. However, the oldest clan of Bosra are the Hamd, a largely fair-skinned people, many members of which have blond hair and blue eyes. They claim to be descendants of the ancient Roman governor of Bosra, although other townspeople believe they are of Crusader origins. Regarding land ownership, the Hamd clan owns around 1,000 hectares in the town while the al-Miqdad clan owns roughly 12,000. The latter's members were historically influential in the Hauran region and beyond, having had one of their own in the Ottoman parliament of Abdul Hamid II in Constantinople during the Young Turks period and in the Syrian parliament during the French Mandate period. As of the late 1990s, members of the al-Miqdad clan occupied the positions of mayor, the chief imam of the main al-Omari Mosque, the chief of the town's bureau of antiquities as well as manager of Bosra's carpet workshop and the owner of the principal coffeehouse. While their members traditionally resided in the eastern quarter of old Bosra, they are currently prevalent throughout the town.\nBosra also has a small Shia Muslim community of some fifty families. According to Palestinian American historian Hanna Batatu, the Shia inhabitants of Bosra were \"relatively recent arrivals\" and immigrated to the town from the city of Nabatieh in South Lebanon. Most of the working members of the Shia community are artisans or laborers. Batatu also asserts that social changes in Bosra since Syrian independence have led to tribal diffusion, with intermarriage between the clans and between the Sunni and Shia communities having increased significantly.\n\nNotable people\nSaint Timon the Deacon, 1st century, Christian proto-deacon and bishop of Bosra\nBeryllus of Bostra, 3rd century, Bishop\nShimon ben Lakish, 3rd century, amora of the second generation and rabbi\nTitus of Bostra, fl. 4th century, Christian theologian\nSaint Antipater of Bostra, fl. 5th century, Christian bishop\nBahira, c. 600, Assyrian monk\nIbn Kathir (1301–1373), Islamic scholar\n\nReferences\nSources\nBatatu, H.

      "content": "Bosra (parfois Bostra, en arabe بصرى) est une ville du sud de la Syrie, ancienne capitale de la région du Hauran, dans le gouvernorat de Deraa. Située dans une région très fertile, au débouché des caravanes venant d’Arabie, Bosra connut la prospérité et joua un important rôle commercial, comptant jusqu’à 50 000 habitants.\nJadis capitale de la province romaine d'Arabie, très tôt christianisée, Bosra devint une étape importante sur l'ancienne route caravanière de La Mecque. Elle conserve, enserrés dans ses épaisses murailles, un théâtre romain du IIe siècle, des ruines paléochrétiennes et plusieurs mosquées plus tardives.\nBosra est inscrite au Patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.\n\nLa ville moderne\nLa ville actuelle s'est développée sur les vestiges de la cité ancienne qui était à peu près dépeuplée il y a un siècle.\nSelon le Bureau central syrien des statistiques (CBS), Bosra comptait 19 683 habitants lors du recensement de 2004. C'est le centre administratif du nahiyah (« sous-district ») de Bosra, qui comprenait neuf localités et comptait une population totale de 33 839 habitants en 2004. Les habitants de Bosra sont majoritairement musulmans sunnites, bien que la ville abrite une petite communauté musulmane chiite.\n\nHistoire\nSituée à 141 km de Damas, au cœur de la région fertile du Hauran, sur un plateau basaltique, Bosra entre dans l’histoire à l’époque hellénistique. Ses roches noires, employées dans la construction depuis des siècles, confèrent à la région entière beaucoup d'originalité. De plus, la dureté du basalte a permis aux monuments de résister à l'usure.\nLa ville est mentionnée pour la première fois dans des archives égyptiennes en 1350 av. J.-C. sous le nom de Busrana, mais ne se développe réellement qu'à partir du IIe siècle av. J.-C. Selon François Villeneuve, aux IIIe et IIe siècles av. J.-C., l'État nabatéen se bâtit et sort progressivement de l'ombre. « Pétra se construit peu à peu et les Nabatéens poussent leurs incursions de plus en plus loin vers le nord, jusque dans la région de Bosra en Syrie. » Sous les rois Arétas III et Arétas IV, elle tombe sous la coupe des Nabatéens. À cette époque, elle devient une capitale régionale de la Nabatène, titre qui lui sera accordé officiellement au Ier siècle sous Rabbel II.\nEn 106, elle devient la capitale de la province romaine d’Arabie créée par Trajan après l’annexion de la Nabatène. Étant sur le principal axe de communication, la Via Nova Trajana, elle bénéficie de cette position et de l’installation de 5000 légionnaires : Bosra devint assez rapidement la garnison définitive de la legio III Cyrenaica. Agrandie et embellie d'édifices publics, organisée autour d'un cardo et d'un decumanus, elle est rebaptisée Nova Trajana Bostra sous Trajan, entre 98 et 117. Au cours du même siècle, on y construit le grand théâtre de 17 000 places, un des plus vastes de l’Orient romain, demeuré presque intact jusqu'à nos jours.\nDès le début du IIIe siècle, le christianisme, en pleine expansion, va changer le paysage urbain : de nombreuses églises sont bâties, ainsi qu'une cathédrale dédiée aux saints Serge, Bacchus et Léonce.\nPour la tradition musulmane, c’est à Bosra que le moine chrétien nestorien Bahira aurait reconnu Mahomet, alors âgé de dix ans, qui accompagnait son oncle \"Abou Talib\", comme étant le paraclet annoncé dans l'évangile de Jean. Après la conquête musulmane de Bosra en 632, la région devient le champ de bataille des musulmans et des byzantins, qui se disputent le contrôle de la Syrie. Trente-six mosquées, dont la mosquée El Omari, sont construites, de nombreux chrétiens sont obligés de se convertir. Les Seldjoukides, gouvernant la ville à partir de la fin du XIe siècle ap. J.-C., y rétablissent la prospérité, et la protègent des Croisés.\nLes Ayyoubides font du théâtre romain, fortifié par Nour Ed Din, une véritable citadelle, qui sera ensuite conquise par les Mongols, mais le sultan turc Baybars la restaure en 1261. La ville demeure pour une longue période un passage obligatoire des pèlerins musulmans. Puis Bosra décline, au point de n'être plus qu'un simple village jusqu'à nos jours. Pendant le Mandat français, des cavaliers autochtones sous commandement français, dégagent et restituent l'axe de la Via Recta qui traverse le site. Ces premières restitutions sont inaugurées par le président de la république de l’État de Syrie, Sheikh Tajeddine el-Hassani (Damas 1885-1943). Par la suite, plusieurs campagnes de fouilles archéologiques ont été menées, principalement sur le monumental théâtre romain, le plus vaste et le mieux préservé du Moyen-Orient, inscrivant Bosra sur les circuits du tourisme moderne. Les habitants de la vieille ville, dont certains vivaient même dans des habitats de construction romaine, sont peu à peu relogés dans de nouveaux quartiers.\n\nLa ville est prise par les rebelles le 25 mars 2015, lors de la guerre civile syrienne. Le 29 juin 2018, des tirs d'artillerie de l'Armée Syrienne endommagent partiellement le théâtre.\n\nSite archéologique\nEnceinte et fortifications\nLe rempart au nord-ouest\nLa portion de l'enceinte urbaine qui s’étend vers le nord à partir de la porte ouest et conduit au camp romain a été fouillée, puis restaurée au cours des années 1990. Un tronçon en appareil pseudo-isodome à bossages a été mis au jour, du même type que celui du rempart de Suweidâ’. Une tour rectangulaire saillante a été relevée.\n\nLe rempart de la ville au sud-ouest\nLe rempart de la ville au sud-ouest est visible à partir de la porte ouest « Bâb al Hawâ’ » en direction du sud. Les tronçons sont construits en gros appareil non taillé pouvant remonter à des périodes anciennes. Un sondage de 2001 a permis d’identifier un premier état de l'enceinte, datable de l’époque du Bronze Moyen II. Ce rempart a été reconstruit au tournant de l'ère chrétienne, à l’époque de la céramique nabatéenne et de la céramique sigillée orientale. Il a connu une nouvelle phase reconstruction à l’époque byzantine, vers le VIe siècle.\n\nLe rempart nord et est\nDans la large rue qui constitue actuellement la limite nord de la vieille ville et suit le tracé sud du camp romain, une tranchée creusée pour installer une canalisation a permis d’observer plusieurs niveaux de circulation en cailloutis, puis en dalles de basalte qui appartenait à une rue dallée, sans doute de direction est-ouest, datant au plus tôt du Ve siècle.\n\nThéâtre, amphithéâtre, cirque\nLe théâtre romain et la citadelle arabe\nAprès la prise de la ville, en 106 après J.-C., les Romains ont presque aussitôt entrepris la construction du théâtre. On suppose qu'il a été achevé sous Trajan, mort en 117.\nLe décor de la scaenae frons est certainement d’époque sévérienne, mais le théâtre a dû rester en construction une bonne partie du IIe siècle, à en juger par le style des chapiteaux de la colonnade qui orne le sommet de la cavea.\nEn 635, Bosra tombe aux mains des Arabes et le théâtre romain trouve un usage défensif. À partir de la fin du XIe siècle, et jusqu'au milieu du XIIe, le théâtre subit une métamorphose radicale : l'édifice est transformé en une solide forteresse qui doit protéger cet important centre de commerce et son réseau routier. Le théâtre est renforcé, comblé et entouré de constructions militaires : recouvert de toutes parts, il restera caché au monde durant sept siècles.\n\nLes tours nord et nord-ouest de la citadelle ont été restaurées au cours des années 1930. Les diverses maisons installées à l’intérieur furent détruites et, en 1947, la restauration des monuments fut confiée à Sleiman Mukdad, qui élabora un plan général de la ville antique et fit le recensement des monuments nécessitant des travaux. Son œuvre la plus importante est le dégagement des deux niveaux de constructions voûtées qui occupaient l'ensemble de la cavea du théâtre.\n\nComme maire de Bosra, Sleiman Mukdad participa à la conception des quartiers modernes pour reloger les familles qui avaient été déplacées à la suite de l’évacuation du site archéologique.\nUn festival biennal de spectacles de musique et de danse a été créé au théâtre antique en 1980.\n\nLes musées de la citadelle\nUn dépôt lapidaire créé en 1933 est à l'origine des collections actuelles de l'antiquarium de la citadelle, augmentées de statues gréco-romaines et d'inscriptions nabatéennes, grecques, latines et arabes.\n\nLe cirque (« hippodrome »)\nLe cirque, du IIe ou IIIe siècle ap. J.-C., apparaît clairement sur les photos aériennes. Il est situé à l'extérieur de la ville, au sud et à proximité du théâtre. Le bâtiment, qui mesure un peu plus de 440 m de long et environ 130 m de large, a été dégagé. Il est très ruiné : seuls subsistent des murs et soutènements de gradins. L'ensemble peut être observé depuis l'espace central.\n\nL’amphithéâtre\nUn grand bâtiment elliptique de 120 × 65 m est visible sur les vues aériennes : c'est l'amphithéâtre, presque entièrement arasé, mais discernable grâce aux campagnes de fouilles effectuées sur les fondations depuis la fin du XIXe siècle. Une partie du mur extérieur a été dégagée. L'amphithéâtre se trouve juste au nord du cirque et à l'ouest du théâtre, formant avec ceux-ci un vaste ensemble consacré aux spectacles.\n\nSources, aqueducs, réservoirs, thermes, hammams\nLe réservoir Est « birket an-Nabatiyah »\nCe réservoir, appelé aussi « réservoir des Nabatéens », est construit à ciel ouvert, tout comme le réservoir sud-est « birket al-Hâjj ». Une canalisation rejoignait le réservoir à l'angle sud-est pour l’alimentation en eau de la ville.\n\nLe réservoir sud-est « birket al-Hâjj »\nLes deux grands réservoirs d'eau sont distants d'environ 500 m. Ils sont de forme carrée, d'environ 150 m de côté, entourés de quais et de bordures de pierre où figurent des inscriptions en écriture nabatéenne qui les rendent tous deux datables du Ier siècle.\nLes deux réservoirs ont été déblayés de 1960 à 1975, puis rénovés en 1986-1987.\n\nLa retenue d’eau du quartier de l'Ouest (prétendue « naumachie »)\nOn observe dans quartier de l’Ouest une vaste dépression en fer à cheval dont le fond humide et fertile a été transformé en cultures, limitée à l’ouest par un mur en appareil cyclopéen dans sa partie sud, et en appareil quadrangulaire à bossages dans la partie centrale. Selon Butler, il s’agirait d’un aménagement pour les jeux nautiques (naumachies) ; d’après Peters, cet espace servait de stockage pour les marchandises et le bétail. Cet espace est toujours utilisé pour des cultures maraîchères irriguées naturellement. Il se trouve sur la ligne qui descend du secteur de la source pérenne de la ville, au nord.\n\nLe hammam Manjak\nCe hammam mamelouk, construit par l’émir Manjak en 1372, est l’un des bâtiments les plus luxueux de la Bosra islamique. Le bâtiment est placé le long de la rue nord-sud, en face de la Grande Mosquée. Le complexe allongé s’articule en fonction de la suite fonctionnelle des opérations du bain. À la pièce d’accueil au sud succèdent vers le nord plusieurs salles de bains et, derrière elles, les installations techniques avec les réservoirs d’eau et le chauffage. L’organisation du plan, les techniques de construction et les détails stylistiques rapprochent le hamman Manjak des bains mamelouks de Damas.\n\nLe camp romain et ses thermes\nLe camp est datable par une borne mentionnant la légion IIIa Cyrenaica (IGLS XIII, 9449) et de nombreux blocs sculptés épars d’époque romaine impériale et byzantine. La légion VIa Ferrata s'est installée à Bostra en 106, suivie de la IIIa Cyrenaica vers 125.\nL’existence du camp légionnaire a été parfois mise en doute, mais sa localisation au nord-est de la ville moderne a été établie dans les années 1970 par les travaux de Sleiman Mukdad. L’estimation des dimensions du camp est rendue difficile par les champs cultivés. Certains murs modernes semblent reproduire assez fidèlement le tracé des murs antiques, mais ceux-ci sont toujours masqués par l’accumulation des pierres. Les dimensions approximatives du camp peuvent être estimées à 440 m d’est en ouest et 350 m du nord au sud. Sa superficie serait donc d’environ 15,40 ha, alors que la superficie des autres camps légionnaires peut atteindre 25 à 27 ha, pour une moyenne de 20 ha. Bostra est donc un des camps légionnaires les plus petits du monde romain, mais proche par sa surface de camps de Pannonie et de Germanie inférieure.\n\nThermes du camp romain\nAu sud-ouest sont visibles les vestiges des thermes du camp et, au nord, la porte du camp, dégagée d’abord par Sleiman Mukdad dans les années 1970, puis par l’équipe archéologique française entre 1997 et 2001. Cette porte est large de 2,70 m ; elle est munie de deux piédroits en appareil de pierre de taille soigné, comportant des remplois. Le passage est encadré par deux tours rectangulaires, saillantes de 5 m par rapport aux piédroits, qui délimitent un passage antérieur large de 5 m.\n\nLa source al-Jahîr\nLa source al-Jahîr, située près de l’angle sud-ouest du camp romain, est une source pérenne située à 6 m de profondeur. C’est la source la plus importante de Bosra, qui explique probablement l’ancienneté et la permanence de l’occupation humaine sur ce site. Elle a sans doute été aménagée depuis l’Antiquité. Deux bassins bordés de hauts murs sont visibles actuellement. Des escaliers permettent d’accéder au niveau de l'eau. L’ensemble du secteur fait l’objet de restaurations et de réaménagements urbains.\n\nVoirie\nLa « rue du théâtre »\nCette voie monumentale, dallée et bordée de colonnes, relie la rue principale est-ouest à la zone du théâtre et de l'amphithéâtre. Elle est bien conservée, datable du IIIe siècle.\n\nLa rue principale est-ouest, entre arc nabatéen et tétrapyle\nLa rue principale de Bosra est une voie monumentale qui traverse toute la ville d'est en ouest, depuis l’arc nabatéen jusqu'à la porte Ouest « Bâb al-Hawâ’ ». Cette rue constituait l’axe majeur de la ville, sans doute bien avant l’époque nabatéenne. À l’époque sévérienne (première moitié du IIIe siècle), cette voie principale prend la forme d'un decumanus monumental, avec une chaussée dallée bordée de trottoirs protégés du soleil et des intempéries par des portiques à colonnades ioniques, sur lesquelles s'ouvraient les boutiques, les thermes et les espaces publics des marchés. Les intersections avec les rues nord-sud sont marquées par des aménagements monumentaux comme l’arc central et la place ronde ornée d'un tétrapyle d'une architecture complexe, comparable à ceux de Palmyre et Jerash.\n\nLa rue du sud au nord, du nymphée vers la mosquée d'Omar\nPartant du sud (carrefour de l'exèdre et du nymphée), cette rue monumentale, dégagée dans les années 1990, a conservé son dallage antique disposé en oblique. Elle desservait les deux entrées des thermes du nord. Ses deux portiques d'ordre ionique abritaient des files de boutiques.\n\nLa rue nord-sud coupant la place du tétrapyle\nCette rue datant de l'époque romaine impériale n'a guère été fouillée, mais son tracé est connu : elle joignait la place du tétrapyle à la source principale de la ville au nord. Vers le sud, à partir de la place du tétrapyle, elle conduit à l’amphithéâtre. Elle était probablement bordée de portiques ioniques d’époque sévérienne, comme la rue principale.\n\nLa rue principale est-ouest du tétrapyle à la porte ouest « Bâb al-Hawâ’ »\nDepuis la place du tétrapyle, la rue principale mène à la porte ouest « Bâb al-Hawâ’ ». La chaussée pavée antique est bordée de trottoirs, autrefois abrités par des portiques à colonnades ioniques.\n\nLa rue est-ouest, de la rue nord-sud à la mosquée de Fâtima\nCette rue antique d’époque romaine, qui joignait les quartiers nord-ouest et nord-est de Bosra, a été dégagée sur une portion limitée, au croisement avec la rue nord-sud et au nord de l’îlot des thermes du centre.\n\nLa rue sud-nord de la mosquée d’Omar au camp romain\nCette rue, datée de l’époque romaine à l’époque médiévale, est le prolongement de la rue joignant le nymphée au camp romain, au nord du carrefour avec la rue est-ouest. Le tracé d’origine de cette rue est très probablement d’époque romaine. Les superstructures datent vraisemblablement de l’époque sévérienne.\n\nDécor urbain\nL'arc nabatéen et les massifs à demi-colonnes nabatéennes\nCe monument de conception romaine, datable du Ier siècle apr. J.-C., marque la limite entre deux secteurs de la ville. L’arc unique repose sur quatre piles rectangulaires. L'ensemble est orné de pilastres, niches et demi-colonnes. Le style des chapiteaux du niveau médian se rattache au style des façades rupestres nabatéennes de Pétra. Un fronton, disparu, couronnait le bâtiment sur ses deux faces.\nL’arc nabatéen à l’est et la porte ouest (ou « Bâb al-Hawâ’ », porte des Vents) ont été restaurés de 1955 à 1968 par Sleiman Mukdad.\n\nLe nymphée (dit autrefois « kalybé »)\nLe nymphée (dit autrefois « kalybé », forme locale de petit temple), aisément repérable par ses deux colonnes corinthiennes jointes par une pièce d'entablement très décorée, est une fontaine monumentale dont on a retrouvé deux bassins et des arrivées d'eau. La datation du monument est rendue difficile par les remplois successifs et les tremblements de terre, mais les archéologues proposent une construction en trois phases, des années 100 à 300 ap. J.-C. environ.\n\nL'exèdre monumentale (dite autrefois « nymphée »)\nCette construction du IIe siècle, qui présente quatre colonnes en façade et une abside centrale en arrière-plan, flanquée de deux murs droits, est située à l'angle d'un des grands carrefours de la ville. Plutôt qu'une fontaine monumentale, l'édifice du IIe siècle semble avoir eu une fonction cultuelle. Il s'agirait dans ce cas d'un temple dédié à une divinité importante liée à la politique romaine.\n\nL’arc central « Bâb al-Qandîl »\nCet arc, en réalité un octopyle datant de Philippe l'Arabe (milieu du IIIe siècle), marquait l'entrée dans la rue du théâtre. Il est aujourd'hui réduit à sa façade nord..\n\nLe cryptoportique\nLe cryptoportique est une galerie voûtée rectiligne de la période romaine, établie sous l'un des deux portiques de la rue principale est-ouest, côté nord, entre l'entrée du marché (macellum) et la place du tétrapyle, de manière à compenser la déclivité du terrain en cet endroit. La galerie, longue de 108 m et large de 5 m, se terminait aux deux extrémités par une abside, celle de l’extrémité ouest se trouvant partiellement détruite afin de laisser place au tétrapyle.\n\nLe tétrapyle et la place ronde\nLe tétrapyle de Bosra est assez semblable à ceux de Jerash et de Palmyre : c'est un monument décoratif du IVe siècle, formé de quatre piliers, chacun d'eux étant constitué de quatre colonnes, au milieu d'une place ronde aménagée au carrefour de la rue principale est-ouest et de la rue sud-nord qui conduit à la source principale. Il ne subsiste de cet ensemble architectural que les soubassements des piliers et des fragments de chapiteaux corinthiens.\n\nLa porte ouest ou porte des Vents « Bâb al-Hawâ’ »\nLa porte, très simple, aux piliers ornés de deux niches, est percée à travers le rempart, à l'extrémité ouest de l'axe principal. Elle date probablement du IIIe siècle.\nDe 1955 à 1968, Sleiman Mukdad consacra ses efforts à la rénovation de l’arc nabatéen à l’est et de la porte Ouest (« Bâb al-Hawâ’ », porte des Vents).\n\nForum, marché, bâtiments publics\nLe forum et le marché (macellum)\nLe forum, au nord du cryptoportique, est une grande place dallée qui n'a guère livré que quelques fragments de chapiteaux et autres éléments architecturaux d'un portique.\nLe marché s'étend à l'est du forum : les fouilles ont révélé un bâtiment de plan octogonal, agrémenté de colonnes, certaines se trouvant murées à la suite d'une conversion en maison d'habitation.\n\nLa basilique de Bahîra et son annexe\nL'édifice basilical du IIe – IIIe siècle, dit « de Bahîra », d'après le nom d'un moine nestorien, est situé au nord de l’église des saints Serge, Bacchus et Léonce. D'usage inconnu, il comportait, à l’origine, une façade s’ouvrant par un arc sur un atrium à colonnes surmontées de chapiteaux ioniques. Il reste une partie de l’abside en cul-de-four.\nUn bâtiment parallèle, au nord de la basilique, conserve une abside au décor élaboré, constitué de quatre niches à frontons et coquilles. Cette abside est incorporée dans une maison moderne.\n\nThermes, bains\nLes thermes du Centre (« Khân ad-Dibs »)\nTrès vaste établissement des IIe et IIIe siècles au point central dans la ville, en usage jusqu'à l'époque byzantine, les thermes du Centre occupaient un vaste rectangle de 105 × 65 m, bordé de boutiques. Ils proposaient des salles thermales et des exercices sportifs, comme partout ailleurs dans l'Empire romain, avec un parcours de pièces froides, tièdes et chaudes, trois palestres, des portiques et autres exèdres et niches décoratives.\n\nLes thermes du Sud\nLes thermes du Sud sont situés sur la rue principale, entre le palais « de Trajan » et la zone du théâtre. Ils ont été fondés au IIe siècle apr. J.-C. et ont connu plusieurs extensions avec de nouvelles salles et palestres, jusqu'à l'abandon de l'ensemble vers le VIIIe siècle, à l’époque omeyyade.\n\nMaisons, palais\nLe palais dit « de Trajan »\nCette vaste construction est en réalité une demeure d’époque byzantine (Ve – VIe siècle), comprenant deux corps de bâtiments et les vestiges d'un portique, disposés autour d'une cour carrée.\n\nLe quartier d’habitations à l’est des thermes du Sud\nCe quartier, situé au sud de la rue principale est-ouest, entre la palestre est des thermes du Sud et le « nouveau prétoire », a été dégagé dans les années 1990 par la Direction générale des Antiquités de Syrie. Il est constitué de maisons séparées par des ruelles, dont la plus importante, orientée nord-sud, rejoignait la rue principale à l’est de l'église des thermes.\nLe « nouveau prétoire » présente sa façade sur la rue principale. Son identification est rendue possible par une inscription byzantine qui fait mention de la construction d'un nouveau prétoire, probablement en cet endroit, en 490.\nLe rez-de-chaussée d'une « maison omeyyade », avec des écuries, est conservé entre l'église des thermes du Sud et le « nouveau prétoire ».\nPrès de là se trouvent les vestiges d'une église byzantine dite « église des thermes du Sud » et ceux d'un temple d'origine nabatéenne, transformé dans les siècles suivants, puis recouvert lors de la construction de l'église  byzantine.\n\nLe mausolée Saint-Georges (ou mausolée Saint-Élias)\nCette maison antique, probablement byzantine, située au nord-ouest de la mosquée al-Khidr, sur la rue nord-sud qui rejoint la place du tétrapyle, comporte une salle allongée couverte par quatre arcs transversaux. Elle abrite un tombeau de saint. D’après sa situation, le mausolée Saint-Georges pourrait, dans un premier état, avoir constitué le fond du portique de cette rue.\n\nLes « belles maisons »\nCe groupe de maisons du IIe  ou  IIIe siècle présente la façade de rue la mieux conservée de Bosra, à l’angle nord-ouest du carrefour entre la rue nord-sud et la rue est-ouest. Le mur est conservé au rez-de-chaussée sur une longueur de 28 m à partir du coin de la rue. Six portes sont encore en place. Au-dessus de chaque porte se trouvait une fenêtre dont une est conservée.\n\nÉglises\nLa grande église à plan centré (ou cathédrale de l'Est)\nLes fouilles entreprises à partir de 1985 ont montré que cette grande église byzantine recouvre des bâtiments antérieurs nabatéen et romain, avec des remplois massifs d'éléments appartenant à chacune de ces périodes. Dans le plan carré du bâtiment nabatéen est venu s'inscrire une église byzantine à abside et colonnade circulaire faite de grandes colonnes corinthiennes certainement issues d'un temple romain antérieur. L'ensemble atteignant une portée de 33 m, il faut imaginer une couverture à coupole centrale en bois, comme l'était celle du monastère Saint-Siméon-le-Stylite, dans le Nord de la Syrie.\n\nL’église des Saints Serge, Bacchus et Léonce et le Palais « épiscopal » Saint-Serge\nUne inscription, aujourd'hui disparue, indiquait la date de la consécration de l’église en 512 par Julianos, archevêque de Bosra, ce qui lui vaut le surnom de « Cathédrale ». L'église de plan carré, avec un espace central à colonnade en forme de tétraconque, était couverte d'une coupole, avec une vaste abside et une iconostase pour le clergé. Les éléments visibles sont des remplois d'éléments nabatéens et romains, avec de belles fresques dont certaines sont encore assez bien conservées.\n\nMosquées, madrasas\nLa mosquée de Fâtima\nLa mosquée, du XIIIe siècle ou XIVe siècle, est située près de l’église des Saints Serge, Bacchus et Léonce. Son plan est rectangulaire, de 11 × 21 m, formant une longue salle voûtée en plein ceintre. Elle comporte un minaret carré, détaché du bâtiment principal, daté de 1306.\n\nL’école coranique (madrasa) de Abû al-Fidâ’\nL’école coranique (madrasa) de Abû al-Fidâ’ (ou ad-Dabbagha « des tanneries »), située au bord du réservoir, a certainement alimenté en eau la citadelle et les bains construits à la même époque. L'inscription au milieu de la façade donne 1225 pour la construction, l'architecte étant un certain Mukannâ Ibn ‘Abbâd, avec al-Mu‘azzam ‘Îsâ, frère du gouverneur ayyoubide en titre as-Sâlih Ismâ‘îl, comme maître d’œuvre.\n\nLa mosquée de Yâqût\nLes inscriptions, sur la façade ouest, la désignent comme la mosquée funéraire de Shihâb al-dîn Yûsuf, mort en 1257, fils du commandant de la citadelle Yâqût. Elle est divisée en deux salles.\n\nLa mosquée al-Khidr\nCette petite mosquée située entre le tétrapyle (24) et la source d’al-Jahîr (44) porte le nom d’al-Khidr, personnage légendaire populaire et vénéré comme un saint dans le monde islamique.\nEn 1955, l’édifice de la mosquée al-Khidr a été consolidé par le Service des Antiquités.\n\nLa mosquée d’Omar (Grande Mosquée, mosquée du Vendredi)\nLa mosquée d’Omar doit son nom au calife ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattâb (634-644), sous lequel la Syrie a été conquise par l’Islam. Selon deux inscriptions, la fondation de la mosquée et de son minaret remonte aux environs de 720-750, à l’époque omeyyade. La tour de la grande mosquée de Bosra a été longtemps considérée comme le minaret conservé le plus ancien du monde islamique. Cependant, les recherches montrent que les constructions existantes ont été réalisées aux XIIe et XIIIe siècles. Le plan carré à arcades est inspiré de la mosquée des Omeyyades de Damas. Entre 1967 et 1981, les parties hautes de la mosquée d’Omar et de la mosquée al-Mabrak ont été restaurées en vue de leur utilisation, en même temps que la madrasa Abû al-Fidâ’.\n\nLa mosquée Mubârak (ou Basmeen)\nConstruite au Xe siècle et restaurée au XIIIe siècle, la mosquée Mubârak est située à 50 m environ à l’ouest de la mosquée Musalla al-Mal‘ab. Elle a été construite sur le rempart Est. Elle est constituée d’une petite salle rectangulaire en largeur, dont la porte s’ouvre vers le nord et couverte par deux arcs transversaux qui supportent les dalles de couverture. La niche de prière est aménagée dans le mur sud, en remployant un couronnement de niche antique.\n\nLa mosquée Musalla al-Mal‘ab, ou mosquée « anonyme »\nLe petit bâtiment, au sud-est du cimetière, présente une petite salle quadrangulaire, faite de remplois antiques. Le toit a été construit selon la technique hauranaise, avec une couverture de dalles de basalte.\n\nLa mosquée Jâmi‘ al-Mabrak an-Naqa (mosquée de l'Agenouillement de la Chamelle)\nÀ l’angle nord-est de la Bosra antique et médiévale se trouve le complexe nommé « Jâmi‘ al-Mabrak », du XIIIe siècle, qui occupe une place particulière parmi les constructions islamiques de la ville, car il est relié par des légendes aux premiers temps de l’Islam.\nD’après la tradition, le Prophète Muhammad, jeune homme, est venu prier là au moment de son séjour à Bosra. Le nom de « Mabrak an-Naqa », c’est-à-dire « le lieu de l'Agenouillement de la Chamelle », évoque le moment où le Prophète a mis pied à terre ; il est mis en relation avec la pierre placée devant la niche de prière (mihrab) de la partie sud-ouest du monument. Le bloc présente à sa face supérieure des traces en creux comme en laissent des chameaux agenouillés sur le sable. Suivant une autre tradition, c’est l’endroit où s’est reposé le chameau qui a transporté la première copie du Coran du Hijâz à Damas. Cependant, les auteurs arabes médiévaux ne mentionnent pas de chameau dans leur énumération des lieux de pèlerinages syriens. L’important pour eux était que Muhammad a séjourné à Bosra et que le moine Bahîra lui a annoncé son destin de Prophète. La position de la mosquée est en accord avec cette tradition : elle est la plus proche, en effet, de la « basilique de Bahîra ».\nLa coupole avait déjà disparu entièrement au début du XXe siècle. De graves dégâts dans la construction furent réparés dans les années 1960. Une restauration systématique effectuée en 1986-1989 avec l'Institut archéologique allemand a de nouveau rendu possible l'utilisation de l’édifice pour le culte.\n\nNécropoles, tombeaux\nLa nécropole de Tell Aswad\nIl subsiste deux tombeaux monumentaux visibles à l'ouest de l'amphithéâtre. L'un présente un plan carré de 3 m de côté, l'autre est un monument circulaire à deux exèdres. Tous deux sont construits en basalte local.\n\nPersonnalités liées\nTitus de Bostra, évêque de Bosra au IVe siècle.\n\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\nButler, H.
