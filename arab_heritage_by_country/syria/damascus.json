      "content": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as ṯmśq (𓍘𓄟𓊃𓈎𓅱) in the 15th century BC.\nThe etymology of the ancient name ṯmśq is uncertain. It is attested as Imerišú (𒀲𒋙) in Akkadian, Damašq (𐡃𐡌𐡔𐡒‎) in Old Aramaic and Dammeśeq (דַּמֶּשֶׂק) in Biblical Hebrew. A number of Akkadian spellings are found in the Amarna letters, from the 14th century BC: Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒋡), Dimašqì (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒄀), and Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒋡).\nLater Aramaic spellings of the name often include an intrusive resh (letter r), perhaps influenced by the root dr, meaning \"dwelling\". Thus, the English and Latin name of the city is Damascus, which was imported from Greek Δαμασκός and originated from the Qumranic Darmeśeq (דרמשק), and Darmsûq (ܕܪܡܣܘܩ) in Syriac, meaning \"a well-watered land\".\nAccording to ancient Greek tradition, there were three myths about the origin of the city's name (Δαμασκός). One claims it was named after the giant Ascus (Ἄσκος). Another says it was named after Damaskos, the son of Hermes and the nymph Alimede, who traveled from Arcadia to Syria and founded a city bearing his name. A third version holds that Damaskos was a man who, after Dionysus made Syria fertile with vineyards, cut them down with an axe. Enraged, Dionysus pursued and flayed him. His original name was Darmaskos, which later evolved into Damaskos.\nIn Arabic, the city is called Dimashq (دمشق Dimašq). The city is also known as aš-Šām by the citizens of Damascus, of Syria and other Arab neighbors and Turkey (Şam). Aš-Šām is an Arabic term for \"Levant\" and for \"Syria\"; the latter, and particularly the historical region of Syria, is called Bilād aš-Šām (بلاد الشام, lit. 'land of the Levant'). The latter term etymologically means \"land of the left-hand side\" or \"the north\", as someone in the Hijaz facing east, oriented to the sunrise, will find the north to the left. This is contrasted with the name of Yemen (اَلْيَمَن al-Yaman), correspondingly meaning \"the right-hand side\" or \"the south\". The variation ش ء م (š-ʾ-m'), of the more typical ش م ل (š-m-l), is also attested in Old South Arabian, 𐩦𐩱𐩣 (šʾm), with the same semantic development.\n\nGeography\nDamascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau 680 m (2,230 ft) above sea level and about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north–south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor, and the east–west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The Anti-Lebanon Mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean Sea, so the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times, the Barada River mitigated this, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada River emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake because in years of severe drought, it does not even exist.\nThe modern city has an area of 105 km2 (41 sq mi), out of which 77 km2 (30 sq mi) is urban, while Jabal Qasioun occupies the rest.\n\nThe old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river Barada which is almost dry (3 cm (1 in) left). To the southeast, north, and northeast it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: Midan in the southwest, Sarouja and Imara in the north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of Jabal Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centered on the important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher Ibn Arabi. These new neighborhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the Europe regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as al-Akrad (the Kurds) and al-Muhajirin (the migrants). They lay 2–3 km (1–2 mi) north of the old city.\nFrom the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial center began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centered on the area known as al-Marjeh or \"the meadow\". Al-Marjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall in it. The courts of justice, post office, and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanized residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Marjeh and al-Salihiyah. The commercial and administrative center of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.\n\nIn the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. In 1956–1957, the new neighborhood of Yarmouk became a second home to many Palestinian refugees. City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western Mezzeh neighborhood and most recently along the Barada valley in Dummar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at Barzeh in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.\nDamascus used to be surrounded by an oasis, the Ghouta region (Arabic: الغوطة, romanized: al-ġūṭä), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water, and various sources to the west are tapped by water contractors. The flow of the Barada dropped with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. The lower aquifers are polluted by the city's runoff from heavily used roads, industry, and sewage.\n\nClimate\nDamascus has a cool arid climate (BWk) in the Köppen-Geiger system, due to the rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are prolonged, dry, and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Autumn is brief and mild, but has the most drastic temperature change, unlike spring where the transition to summer is more gradual and steady. Annual rainfall is around 130 mm (5 in), occurring from October to May.\n\nHistory\nEarly settlement\nCarbon-14 dating at Tell Ramad, on Damascus's outskirts, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 BC. But evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus's walls until the second millennium BC.\n\nLate Bronze\nSome of the earliest Egyptian records are the Amarna letters, from 1350 BC, when Damascus (called Dimasqu) was ruled by king Biryawaza. Circa 1260 BC, the Damascus region and the rest of Syria became a battleground between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, ending with a signed treaty between Hattusili III and Ramesses II. The former handed over control of the Damascus area to the latter in 1259 BC. The arrival of the Sea Peoples around 1200 BC marked the end of the Bronze Age in the region and brought about new development of warfare. Damascus was only a peripheral part of this picture, which mostly affected the larger population centers of ancient Syria. But these events contributed to Damascus's emergence as an influential center during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.\nDamascus is mentioned in Genesis 14:15 as existing at the time of the War of the Kings. According to the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews, Damascus (along with Trachonitis) was founded by Uz, the son of Aram. In Antiquities i. 7, Josephus reports:\n\nNicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: \"Abraham reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity became a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abraham is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is a village named after him, The Habitation of Abraham.\n\nAram-Damascus\nDamascus is first documented as an important city during the arrival of the Aramaeans, a Semitic people, in the 11th century BC. By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these was Aram-Damascus, centered on its capital, Damascus. The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle adopted the name \"Dimashqu\" for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still undeveloped and sparsely populated area, they established a water distribution system by constructing canals and tunnels that maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The Romans and the Umayyads later improved the network, which still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city. The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as Aram-Zobah, based in the Beqaa Valley.\nThe city gained preeminence in southern Syria when Ezron, the claimant to Aram-Zobah's throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. He overthrew the city's tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this state expanded south, it prevented the Kingdom of Israel from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east. Under Ezron's grandson, Ben-Hadad I (880–841 BC), and his successor Hazael, Damascus annexed Bashan (modern-day Hauran region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC, when Ben-Hadad II was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging Samaria. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.\nAnother possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which was trying to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King Hadadezer of Damascus led a Levantine coalition that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by King Ahab of Israel in the Battle of Qarqar against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus was victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. But after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus tried to invade Israel but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa'a valleys.\nBy the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a Dark Age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural center of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria led by Tiglath-Pileser III went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became subjugated by their rule. One effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with Arabia. In 694 BC, the town was called Šaʾimerišu (Akkadian: 𒐼𒄿𒈨𒊑𒋙𒌋) and its governor was named Ilu-issīya. Assyrian authority dwindled by 609–605 BC, and Syria-Palestine fell into the orbit of Pharaoh Necho II's Egypt. By 572 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonians had conquered all of Syria, but Damascus's status under Babylon is relatively unknown.\n\nHellenistic period\nDamascus was conquered by Alexander the Great. After his death in 323 BC, it became the site of a struggle between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires. Control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander's generals, made Antioch the capital of his empire, which led to the decline of Damascus's importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as Syrian Laodicea in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek hippodamian system and renamed it \"Demetrias\".\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey annexed the western part of Syria. The Romans occupied Damascus and incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the Decapolis which itself was incorporated into the province of Syria and granted autonomy.\nDamascus was entirely redesigned by the Romans after Pompey conquered the region. The Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the Via Recta) and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus. The gate originally had three arches, with the central arch for chariots and others for pedestrians.\n\nIn 23 BC, Caesar Augustus gave Herod the Great lands controlled by Zenodorus, and some scholars believe Herod was also granted control of Damascus. Either control of Damascus reverted to Syria upon Herod the Great's death or it was part of the lands given to Herod Philip that were given to Syria with his death in 33/34 AD.\nIt is speculated that control of Damascus was gained by Aretas IV Philopatris of Nabatea between the death of Herod Philip in 33/34 AD and the death of Aretas in 40 AD, but there is substantial evidence that Aretas did not control the city before 37 AD and there are many reasons it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 AD. In fact, all these theories stem not from any actual evidence outside the New Testament but rather \"a certain understanding of 2 Corinthians 11:32\" and in reality \"neither from archaeological evidence, secular-historical sources, nor New Testament texts can Nabatean sovereignty over Damascus in the first century AD be proven.\" Roman emperor Trajan, who annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, creating the province of Arabia Petraea, had previously been in Damascus, as his father Marcus Ulpius Traianus was governor of Syria from 73 to 74 AD, where he met the ethnically Greek architect and engineer Apollodorus of Damascus, who joined him in Rome when he was a consul in 91 AD and built several monuments during the 2nd century.\nDamascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the 2nd century and in 222 it was upgraded to a colonia by Emperor Septimius Severus. During the Pax Romana, Damascus and the entire Roman province of Syria began to prosper. Damascus's importance as a caravan city was evident, with the trade routes from southern Arabia, Palmyra, Petra, and the Silk Road all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. Circa 125 AD the Roman emperor Hadrian promoted the city of Damascus to \"Metropolis of Coele-Syria\".\nLittle remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city had a lasting effect. Roman architects brought together the city's Greek and Aramaean foundations and fused them into a new layout measuring about 1,500 by 750 m (4,920 by 2,460 ft), surrounded by a wall. The wall had seven gates, but only the eastern gate, Bab Sharqi, remains. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters (16 feet) below the modern city.\n\nThe old borough of Bab Tuma was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local Eastern Orthodox community. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Paul and Saint Thomas both lived in that neighborhood. Roman Catholic historians also consider Bab Tuma the birthplace of several Popes, such as John V and Gregory III. Accordingly, a community of Jewish Christians converted to Christianity with the advent of Saint Paul's proselytization.\nDuring the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the city was besieged and captured by Shahrbaraz in 613 along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners. It was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.\n\nRashidun period\nThe Prophet Muhammad's first indirect interaction with the people of Damascus was when he sent a letter, through his companion Shiya ibn Wahab, to Harith ibn Abi Shamir, the king of Damascus. The letter stated: \"Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours.\"\n\nAfter most of the Syrian countryside was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate during the reign of Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), Damascus itself was conquered by the Arab Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid in August–September 634 CE. His army had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634 but without success. With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid's forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation. In August, the two sides met along the Yarmouk River where they fought a major battle which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying Muslim rule in Syria and Palestine. While the Muslims administered the city, the population of Damascus remained mostly Christian—Eastern Orthodox and Monophysite—with a growing community of Muslims from Mecca, Medina, and the Syrian Desert. The governor assigned to the city which had been chosen as the capital of Islamic Syria was Mu'awiya I.\n\nUmayyad and Abbasid periods\nFollowing the fourth Rashidun caliph Ali's death in 661, Mu'awiya was chosen as the caliph of the expanding Islamic empire. Because of the vast amounts of assets his clan, the Umayyads, owned in the city and because of its traditional economic and social links with the Hijaz as well as the Christian Arab tribes of the region, Mu'awiya established Damascus as the capital of the entire Caliphate. With the ascension of Caliph Abd al-Malik in 685, an Islamic coinage system was introduced, and all the surplus revenue of the Caliphate's provinces was forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the city's Muslim minority an advantage over the Aramaic-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.\nAbd al-Malik's successor al-Walid initiated the construction of the Grand Mosque of Damascus (known as the Umayyad Mosque) in 706. The site originally had been the Christian Cathedral of St. John and the Muslims maintained the building's dedication to John the Baptist. By 715, the mosque was complete. Al-Walid died that same year and was succeeded at first by Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik and then by Umar II, who each ruled for brief periods before the reign of Hisham in 724. With these successions, the status of Damascus was gradually weakening, as Suleiman chose Ramla as his residence and Hisham chose Resafa. Following the murder of the latter in 743, the Caliphate of the Umayyads—which by then stretched from Spain to India—was crumbling as a result of widespread revolts. During the reign of Marwan II in 744, the capital of the empire was relocated to Harran in the Jazira region.\n\nOn 25 August 750, the Abbasids, having already beaten the Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus were ostracised, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterwards, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It mostly disappeared from written records for the next century, and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.\nOn 24 November 847, a multiple earthquake struck and destroyed Damascus, killing about 70,000 people.\nAhmad ibn Tulun, a dissenting Turkish wali appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878–79. Out of respect for the Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu'awiya's grave. Tulunid rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the Qarmatians, who adhered to Shia Islam. Due to their inability to control the vast land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the Ikhshidids, took control of it. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab Hamdanid dynasty of Aleppo 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the Fatimids in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.\n\nThe Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the city's Sunni Arabs, who frequently revolted. The Turk Alptakin drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines during the Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes from attempting to annex the city. But by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph al-Aziz wrested control of the city back and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city were \"magnificent\" but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of al-Hakim (996–1021). In 998, he executed hundreds of Damascus citizens for incitement. Three years after his mysterious disappearance, a rebellion began in southern Syria against the Fatimids but was stifled by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, Anushtakin al-Duzbari, in 1029. This victory gave him mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords but gaining the admiration of Damascus's citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to Aleppo, where he died in 1041. From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city's history. By then, Damascus lacked a city administration and had an enfeebled economy and a greatly reduced population.\n\nSeljuq and Ayyubid periods\nWith the arrival of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (madrasas) and hospitals (maristans). Damascus soon became one of the most important centers of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq died in 1104, his mentor (atabeg), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status, and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the moral authority of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.\nWhile the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and Diyarbakir, the Crusaders, who arrived in the Levant in 1097, conquered Jerusalem, Mount Lebanon and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader's rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included Homs, the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights as part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din Mawdud of Mosul, Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110. In 1126, the Crusader army led by Baldwin II fought Burid forces led by Toghtekin at Marj al-Saffar near Damascus; however, despite their tactical victory, the Crusaders failed in their objective to capture Damascus.\n\nFollowing Toghtekin's death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Muluk Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of Mosul, Imad al-Din Zengi, took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 Isma'ili Muslims were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at Banias, to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of Tyre. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 2,000 knights and 10,000 infantry. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city. Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. Mu'in al-Din Unur, his mamluk (\"slave soldier\") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk's backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.\nIn 1144, Zengi conquered Edessa, a crusader stronghold, which led to a new crusade from Europe in 1148. In the meantime, Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls and was driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.\nIn 1164, King Amalric of Jerusalem invaded Fatimid Egypt, requested help from Nur ad-Din. The Nur ad-Din sent his general Shirkuh, and in 1166 Amalric was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. When Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin, who defeated a joint crusader-Byzantine siege of Damietta. Saladin eventually overthrew the Fatimid caliphs and established himself as Sultan of Egypt. He also began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Damascus and Nur ad-Din's other Syrian possessions. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. Saladin also besieged Kerak in 1183, but was forced to withdraw. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187 and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July. Acre fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself was captured in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the Third Crusade in 1189, led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, though the last drowned en route.\nThe surviving crusaders, joined by new arrivals from Europe, put Acre to a lengthy siege which lasted until 1191. After re-capturing Acre, Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192, recovering most of the coast for the Christians, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the Crusaders to fulfill their vows, after which they all returned home. Local crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.\nSaladin died in 1193, and there were frequent conflicts between different Ayyubid sultans ruling in Damascus and Cairo. Damascus was the capital of independent Ayyubid rulers between 1193 and 1201, from 1218 to 1238, from 1239 to 1245, and from 1250 to 1260. At other times it was ruled by the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt. During the internecine wars fought by the Ayyubid rulers, Damascus was besieged repeatedly, as, e.g., in 1229.\nThe patterned Byzantine and Chinese silks available through Damascus, one of the Western termini of the Silk Road, gave the English language \"damask\".\n\nMamluk period\nAyyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1260, in which the Mongols led by Kitbuqa entered the city on 1 March 1260, along with the King of Armenia, Hethum I, and the Prince of Antioch, Bohemond VI; hence, the citizens of Damascus saw for the first time for six centuries three Christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets. However, following the Mongol defeat at Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260, Damascus was captured five days later and became the provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal. Following their victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, the Mongols led by Ghazan besieged the city for ten days, which surrendered between 30 December 1299, and 6 January 1300, though its Citadel resisted. Ghazan then retreated with most of his forces in February, probably because the Mongol horses needed fodder, and left behind about 10,000 horsemen under the Mongol general Mulay. Around March 1300, Mulay returned with his horsemen to Damascus, then followed Ghazan back across the Euphrates. In May 1300, the Egyptian Mamluks returned from Egypt and reclaimed the entire area without a battle. In April 1303, the Mamluks managed to defeat the Mongol army led by Kutlushah and Mulay along with their Armenian allies at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar, to put an end to Mongol invasions of the Levant. Later on, the Black Death of 1348–1349 killed as much as half of the city's population.\nIn 1400, Timur, the Turco-Mongol conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal, Timur sacked the city on 17 March 1401. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women were taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name Burj al-Ru'us (between modern-day Al-Qassaa and Bab Tuma), originally \"the tower of heads\".\nRebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.\n\nOttoman period\nIn early 1516, the Ottoman Empire, wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, tekkiye and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in al-Salihiyah. This was to be the first of Damascus's great Ottoman monuments.\nDuring this time, according to an Ottoman census, Damascus had 10,423 households.\nThe Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great Hajj caravans to Mecca, Damascus was treated with more attention by the Porte than its size might have warranted—for most of this period, Aleppo was more populous and commercially more important. In 1559 the western building of Sulaymaniyya Takiyya, comprising a mosque and khan for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and soon afterward the Salimiyya Madrasa was built adjoining it.\n\nEarly in the nineteenth century, Damascus was noted for its shady cafes along the banks of the Barada. A depiction of these by William Henry Bartlett was published in 1836, along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, see  Cafes in Damascus. Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including several churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors.\n\nAmerican Missionary E.C. Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was 'about' 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews, and 100,000 'Mohammedans' with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians. In the meantime, American writer Mark Twain visited Damascus, then wrote about his travel in The Innocents Abroad, in which he mentioned: \"Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!\". In November 1898, German emperor Wilhelm II toured Damascus, during his trip to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nModern period\n20th century\nIn the early years of the 20th century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political coloring, largely in reaction to the turkicisation program of the Committee of Union and Progress government established in Istanbul in 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by Jamal Pasha, governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the Arab Revolt and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.\n\nOn 1 October 1918, T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, the third arrival of the day, the first being the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden. Two days later, 3 October 1918, the forces of the Arab revolt led by Prince Faisal also entered Damascus. A military government under Shukri Pasha was named and Faisal ibn Hussein was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension arose in November 1917, when the new Bolshevik government in Russia revealed the Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab East between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the \"complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.\" The Syrian National Congress in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the Versailles Conference had granted France a mandate over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General Mariano Goybet crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the Battle of Maysalun and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus the capital of their League of Nations Mandate for Syria.\nWhen in 1925 the Great Syrian Revolt in the Hauran spread to Damascus, the French suppressed it with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between Al-Hamidiyah Souq and Medhat Pasha Souq was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as al-Hariqa (\"the fire\"). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels from infiltrating the Ghouta, and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars. Reporter George Seldes viewed 308 bodies, and suggested there might be more dead under the rubble—and that a maximum might be one thousand.  \"When the Muslims, who had rebelled, threatened to kill all Christians, General Maurice Sarrail gave the civilian population time to evacuate, then ordered Fort Gouraud to fire some warning shots, then shell the rebel sector.\"  \nOn 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied Syria-Lebanon campaign, Damascus was captured from the Vichy French forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force. The French agreed to withdraw in 1946, following the British intervention during the Levant Crisis, thus leading to the full independence of Syria. Damascus remained the capital and has been unchanged even following the start of Ba'athist rule in 1963.\nIn 1979, the Old City of Damascus, with its collection of archaeological and historical religious sites, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nCivil war\nBy January 2012, clashes between the regular army and rebels reached the outskirts of Damascus, reportedly preventing people from leaving or reaching their houses, especially when security operations there intensified from the end of January into February.\nBy June 2012, bullets and shrapnel shells smashed into homes in Damascus overnight as troops battled the Free Syrian Army in the streets. At least three tank shells slammed into residential areas in the central Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, according to activists. Intense exchanges of assault rifle fire marked the clash, according to residents and amateur video posted online.\nThe Damascus suburb of Ghouta suffered heavy bombing in December 2017 and a further wave of bombing started in February 2018, also known as Rif Dimashq Offensive.\nOn 20 May 2018, Damascus and the entire Rif Dimashq Governorate came fully under government control for the first time in 7 years after the evacuation of IS from Yarmouk Camp. In September 2019, Damascus entered the Guinness World Records as the least liveable city, scoring 30.7 points on the Economist's Global Liveability Index in 2019, based on factors such as: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. However, the trend of being the least liveable city on Earth started in 2017, and continued as of 2024.\n\nSyrian rebels, led by the HTS rebel group entered Damascus on 8 December 2024 after a series of offensives, capturing Sednaya Prison and later resulting in the collapse of Ba'athist Syria.\nOn 23 February 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suweyda, and the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Syrian territory south of Damascus. Syria's new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa rejected Netanyahu's demands. Hours later, Israel conducted a wave of airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria.\n\nEconomy\nThe historical role that Damascus played as an important trade center has changed in recent years due to political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus has also held an annual international trade exposition every fall, since 1954.\nThe tourism industry in Damascus has a lot of potential, however, the civil war has hampered these prospects. The abundance of cultural wealth in Damascus has been modestly employed since the late 1980s with the development of many accommodation and transportation establishments and other related investments. Since the early 2000s, numerous boutique hotels and bustling cafes opened in the old city which attracts plenty of European tourists and Damascenes alike.\nIn 2009 new office space was built and became available on the real estate market. Marota City and Basilia City are two new development projects in Damascus. These two projects are viewed as post-war reconstruction efforts. The Damascus stock exchange formally opened for trade in March 2009, and the exchange is the only stock exchange in Syria. It is located in the Barzeh district, within Syria's financial markets and securities commission. Its final home is to be located in the upmarket business district of Yaafur.\nDamascus is home to a wide range of industrial activities, such as textile, food processing, cement, and various chemical industries. The majority of factories are run by the state, however limited privatization in addition to economic activities led by the private sector, were permitted starting in the early 2000s with the liberalization of trade that took place.\nTraditional handcrafts and artisan copper engravings are still produced in the old city.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nIn the 2004 Census of Population conducted by Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria), Damascus had a population of 1,552,161 living in 309,317 of its 345,097 total dwellings.\nDamascus is the center of a crowded metropolitan area with an estimated population of 5 million. The metropolitan area of Damascus includes the cities of Douma, Harasta, Darayya, Al-Tall and Jaramana.\nThe city's growth rate is higher than in Syria as a whole, primarily due to rural-urban migration and the influx of young Syrian migrants drawn by employment and educational opportunities. The migration of Syrian youths to Damascus has resulted in an average age within the city that is below the national average. Nonetheless, the population of Damascus is thought to have decreased in recent years as a result of the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Damascenes are Syrian Arabs. The Kurds are the second largest ethnic minority, with a population of approximately 300,000. They reside primarily in the neighborhoods of Wadi al-Mashari (\"Zorava\" or \"Zore Afa\" in Kurdish) and Rukn al-Din. Other minorities include Palestinians, Armenians, Assyrians, Turkmens, Circassians and a small Greek community.\n\nReligion\nIslam is the largest religion. The majority of Muslims are Sunni while Alawites and Twelver Shi'a comprise sizeable minorities. Alawites live primarily in the neighbourhoods of Mezzeh 86 and Sumariyah part of the Mezzeh district, in addition to the neighbourhood of Eish al-Warwar in the district of Barzeh. Twelvers primarily live near the Shia holy sites of Sayyidah Ruqayya and Sayyidah Zaynab. It is believed that there are more than 200 mosques in Damascus, the most well-known being the Umayyad Mosque.\nChristians represent about 10%–15% of the population. Several Eastern Christian rites have their headquarters in Damascus, including the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Christian districts in the city are Bab Tuma, Qassaa and Ghassani. Each have many churches, most notably the ancient Chapel of Saint Paul, St. Paul Cathedral, Our Lady of the Dormition Cathedral, and St Georges Cathedral in Bab Tuma. At the suburb of Soufanieh a series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004. The Patriarchal See of the Syriac Orthodox is based in Damascus, Bab Touma.\nA smaller Druze minority inhabits the city, notably in the mixed Christian-Druze suburbs of Tadamon, Jaramana, and Sahnaya.\nThere was a small Jewish community namely in what is called Harat al-Yahud (\"the Jewish quarter\"). They are the remnants of an ancient and much larger Jewish presence in Syria, dating back at least to Roman times, if not before to the time of King David. There was once a significant Jewish community in Damascus, but as of 2023, no Jews remain.\n\nSufism\nSufism throughout the second half of the 20th century has been an influential current in the Sunni religious practises, particularly in Damascus. The largest women-only and girls-only Muslim movement in the world happens to be Sufi-oriented and is based in Damascus, led by Munira al-Qubaysi. Syrian Sufism has its stronghold in urban regions such as Damascus, where it also established political movements such as Zayd, with the help of a series of mosques, and clergy such as Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, Sa'id Hawwa, Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi.\n\nHistorical sites\nThe Ancient City of Damascus was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1979. Beginning with the Aramaic kingdom (11th-7th centuries BC), Damascus grew into the political and urban hub for the region. Today, the ancient city encompasses over 125 cultural heritage sites that represent Damascus's long history, including archaeological and architectural remains from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Ottoman periods. Tragically, ongoing conflict and war continues to threaten the archaeological heritage and prevent archaeological discovery of Damascus.\n\nThe Citadel of Damascus is in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Damascus Straight Street (referred to in the account of the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the Via Recta, was the decumanus (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate), where St George's Cathedral, the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church, is notably located. Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of Bab Sharqi Street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is located. Shias, Fatemids, and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad Caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain's head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. All other remaining members of Imam Husain's family (left alive after Karbala) along with the heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near Bab al-Saghir), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called Ru'ûs ash-Shuhadâ-e-Karbala or ganj-e-sarha-e-shuhada-e-Karbala. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where devotees say Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin used to pray while in captivity.\nThe Harat Al Yehud or Jewish Quarter is a recently restored historical tourist destination popular among Europeans before the outbreak of civil war. Vacationers can enjoy the neighborhood and scenic ancient homes abandoned by the completely departed Syrian Jewish community.\n\nWalls and gates of Damascus\nThe Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 86.12 hectares is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:\n\nBab al-Faradis (\"the gate of the orchards\", or \"of the paradise\")\nBab al-Salam (\"the gate of peace\"), all on the north boundary of the Old City\nBab Tuma (\"Touma\" or \"Thomas's Gate\") in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,\nBab Sharqi (\"eastern gate\") in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan\nBab Kisan in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into Chapel of Saint Paul marking this event,\nBab al-Saghir (The Small Gate)\nBab al-Jabiya at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the southwest.\nOther areas outside the walled city also bear the name \"gate\": Bab al-Faraj, Bab Mousalla and Bab Sreija, both to the south-west of the walled city.\n\nChurches in the old city\nChapel of Saint Paul\nHouse of Saint Ananias\nMariamite Cathedral of Damascus\nCathedral of the Dormition of Our Lady\nSaint John the Damascene Church\nSaint Paul's Laura\nSaint George's Syriac Orthodox Cathedral\n\nIslamic sites in the old city\nUmayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus\nSayyidah Ruqayya Mosque\nBab Saghir Cemetery\nMausoleum of Saladin\nNabi Habeel Mosque\n\nMadrasas\nAl-Adiliyah Madrasa\nAz-Zahiriyah Library\nNur al-Din Madrasa\n\nKhans\nKhan Jaqmaq\nKhan As'ad Pasha\nKhan Sulayman Pasha\n\nOld Damascene houses\nAzm Palace, originally built in 1750 as the residence for the Ottoman governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha al-Azm, housing the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.\nBayt al-Aqqad\nBayt Farhi, a large late-18th-century courtyard Jewish mansion built for the prominent Farhi family.\nMaktab Anbar, a mid-19th-century Jewish private mansion, restored by the Ministry of Culture in 1976 to serve as a library, exhibition center, museum and craft workshops.\nBeit al-Mamlouka, a 17th-century Damascene house, serving as a luxury boutique hotel within the old city since 2005.\n\nThreats to the future of the old City\nDue to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation), a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a 1,400 m (4,600 ft) stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.\n\nState of old Damascus\nIn spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:\n\nSouq al-Atiq, a protected buffer zone, was destroyed in three days in November 2006;\nKing Faysal Street, a traditional hand-craft region in a protected buffer zone near the walls of Old Damascus between the Citadel and Bab Touma, is threatened by a proposed motorway.\nIn 2007, the Old City of Damascus and notably the district of Bab Tuma have been recognized by The World Monument Fund as one of the most endangered sites in the world.\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction.\n\nEducation\nDamascus is the main center of education in Syria. It is home to Damascus University, which is the oldest and largest university in Syria. After the enactment of legislation allowing private higher institutions, several new universities were established in the city and the surrounding area, including:\n\nSyrian Virtual University\nInternational University for Science and Technology\nSyrian Private University\nArab International University\nUniversity of Kalamoon\nYarmouk Private University\nWadi International University\nAl-Jazeera University\nEuropean University Damascus\nThe institutes play an important rule in the education, including:\n\nHigher Institute of Business Administration\nHigher Institute of Applied Science and Technology\nHigher Institute of Dramatic Arts\nNational Institute of Administration\nIn Damascus, Higher education in Syrian Arab Republic started with sustainable development steps through Damascus University. \n\nAdditional:\nSyrian International Academy for Training and Development\n\nTransportation\nDamascus is linked with other major cities in Syria via a motorway network. The M5 connects Damascus with Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Turkey in the north and Jordan in the south. The M1 is going from Homs onto Latakia and Tartus.\nThe M4 links the city with Al-Hasakah and Iraq. The M1 highway connects the city to western Syria and Beirut.\nThe main airport is Damascus International Airport, approximately 20 km (12 mi) away from the city, with connections to a few Middle Eastern cities. Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.\n\nStreets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles. Many taxi companies operate in Damascus. Fares are regulated by law and taxi drivers are obliged to use a taximeter.\nPublic transport in Damascus depends extensively on buses and minibuses. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two endpoints and possibly an important station along the line. Between 2019 and 2022, more than 100 modern buses were delivered from China as part of the international agreement. These deliveries strengthened and modernized the public transport of Damascus.\nServed by Chemins de Fer Syriens, the former main railway station of Damascus was al-Hejaz railway station, about 1 km (5⁄8 mi) west of the old city. The station is now defunct and the tracks have been removed, but there still is a ticket counter and a shuttle to Damascus Qadam station in the south of the city, which now functions as the main railway station.\nIn 2008, the government announced a plan to construct a Damascus Metro. The green line will be an essential west–east axis for the future public transportation network, serving Moadamiyeh, Sumariyeh, Mezzeh, Damascus University, Hijaz, the Old City, Abbassiyeen and Qaboun Pullman bus station. A four-line metro network is expected to be in operation by 2050.\n\nCulture\nDamascus was chosen as the 2008 Arab Capital of Culture. The preparation for the festivity began in February 2007 with the establishing of the Administrative Committee for \"Damascus Arab Capital of Culture\" by a presidential decree. Museums in Damascus includes National Museum of Damascus, Azem Palace, Military Museum, October War Panorama Museum, Museum of Arabic Calligraphy and Nur al-Din Bimaristan\n\nSports and leisure\nPopular sports include football, basketball, swimming, tennis, table tennis, equestrian and chess. Damascus is home to many football clubs that participate in the Syrian Premier League including al-Jaish, al-Shorta, Al-Wahda and Al-Majd. Many Other sports clubs are located in several districts of the city: Barada SC, Al-Nidal SC, Al-Muhafaza, Qasioun SC, al-Thawra SC, Maysalun SC, al-Fayhaa SC, Dummar SC, al-Majd SC and al-Arin SC.\nThe fifth and the seventh Pan Arab Games were held in Damascus in 1976 and 1992 respectively.\nThe now modernized Al-Fayhaa Sports City features a basketball court and a hall that can accommodate up to 8,000 people. In late November 2021, Syria's national basketball team played there against Kazakhstan, making Damascus host of Syria's first international basketball tournament in almost two decades.\nThe city also has a modern golf course located near the Ebla Cham Palace Hotel on the southeastern outskirts of Damascus.\nDamascus has a busy nightlife. Coffeehouses offer Arabic coffee, tea and  nargileh (water pipes). Card games, tables (backgammon variants), and chess are activities frequented in cafés. These coffeehouses had an international reputation in the past, as indicated by Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration, Cafes in Damascus, to a picture by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837. Current movies can be seen at Cinema City which was previously known as Cinema Dimashq.\n\nTishreen Park is one of the largest parks in Damascus. It is home to the annual Damascus Flower Show. Other parks include al-Jahiz, al-Sibbki, al-Tijara, al-Wahda, etc... The city's famous Ghouta oasis is also a weekend destination for recreation. Many recreation centers operate in the city including sports clubs, swimming pools, and golf courses. The Syrian Arab Horse Association in Damascus offers a wide range of activities and services for horse breeders and riders.\n\nNearby attractions\nMadaya: a small mountainous town and well-known holiday resort.\nBloudan: a town located 51 km (32 mi) north-west of Damascus, its moderate temperature and low humidity in summer attracts many visitors from Damascus and throughout Syria, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.\nZabadani: a city close to the border with Lebanon. Its mild weather along with the scenic views, made the town a popular resort both for tourists and for visitors from other Syrian cities.\nMaaloula: a town dominated by speakers of Western Neo-Aramaic.\nSaidnaya: a city located in the mountains, 1,500 metres (4,921 ft) above sea level, it was one of the episcopal cities of the ancient Patriarchate of Antioch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nNotable people\nSee also\nDamascus Document\nList of World Heritage in Danger\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003).

      "summary": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.",

      "content": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمة الجمهورية العربية السورية، ومركز محافظة دمشق. وهي إحدى أقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ أحد عشر ألف عام تقريبًا، وأقدم مدينة - عاصمة في العالم. أصبحت عاصمة منطقة سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عدة نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، أوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظة سامية قديمة بمعنى الأرض المسقية؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينة الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديدة، مشكلاً بذلك غوطة دمشق؛ وأيضًا يتميز موقع المدينة بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسمية دمشق على المدينة القديمة حتى القرون الوسطى، حين أخذت المدينة بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتألف دمشق من خمسة عشر منطقة سكنية متصلة بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينة تعدّ المركز الإداري لمحافظة دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي إداريًا لمحافظة ريف دمشق. حسب إحصاءات عام 2013 فإن عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك ثاني أكبر المدن السورية بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب إحصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك أكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن أكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهرة، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 105 كم2؛ غالبية سكان دمشق التقليدية هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنة على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيرة العدد، من أصول أوروبية - بلقانية بشكل أساسي - وعربية، بدواع مختلفة، انسجم أغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينة؛ تحوي دمشق أيضًا أعدادًا كبيرة من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السورية، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمة، فإن دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامة في الدولة السورية، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمة الدستورية العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمة، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينة تجارية، تقصدها القوافل للراحة أو التبضع، كانت المدينة إحدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهة إلى فارس أو آسيا الصغرى أو مصر أو الجزيرة العربية. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في إغناء المدينة وتحويلها إلى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي أيضًا، فالمدينة كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول أهمها الدولة الأموية - أكبر دولة إسلامية من حيث المساحة في التاريخ، وفيها أقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزة في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الأيوبي والظاهر بيبرس. أما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجارة، والصناعة المنتشرة في الضواحي، والسياحة، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحدة من أفضل المقاصد السياحية في العالم، إلا أنّ الأزمة السورية المندلعة منذ 2011، أفضت إلى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينة، وبروز أزمات اجتماعية واقتصادية فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nأي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الأهلية، تم تصنيف دمشق على أنها المدينة الأقل ملاءمةً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحدة الاستخبارات الاقتصادية. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 أسوأ مدينة في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف أيضًا بأسماء عديدة منها الشام و مدينة الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانة إقليمية بارزة على صعيد الفنون، والآداب، والسياسة؛ وحظيت باهتمام الأدباء والشعراء والرحالة ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّة والأدبيّة، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:\n\nأصل التسمية\nمن أقدم الوثائق التي ذكرت فيها دمشق على مرِّ التاريخ رُقم مدينة إيبلا العائدة إلى حوالي عام 2000 ق.م، إذ وردَ ذكرها تحتَ مُسمَّى داماسكي. كما أن ذكرها جاءَ أكثرَ من مرَّة في النصوص المصريَّة القديمة، ومن أبرزها ألواح تحتمس الثالث العائدة إلى القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، حيثُ ذكرت باسم تيمساك، وفي رسائل تل العمارنة باسم تيماشكي. وفي الفترات التي تبعت ذلك تعاقبت عدة أسماء عليها مع كل دولة جديدة كانت تحكم المنطقة، فأطلق عليها الآشوريون دَمَشْقا وأحياناً استخدموا اسم إيميري شو أيضًا، والآراميون كانوا يُطلقون عليها اسم ديماشقو، كما ورد اسمي دارميساك أو دارميسيق في بعض النصوص الآرامية الذي قد يَعني «الدَّار/الأرض المسقية» أو «المكان الوافر بالمياه» أو «أرض الحجر الكلسي». ومنه في العصور الأنتيكية، عرف في اللغة اللاتينية، ومنها اللغات الأوروبية المعاصرة ببعض التحريف في النطق ليُصبح داماسْكُس (باللاتينية: Damascus).\nبعد الفتح الإسلامي للشام عُرفت المدينة بالكثير من الأسماء، منها دمشق الشام تمييزاً لها عن مدينة غرناطة في الأندلس التي سُميت أيضاً دمشق العرب، وذاتَ العِماد لكثرة الأعمدة في أبنيتها، وباب الكعبة لوُجودها على طريق مكة، والفَيْحَاء لاتساعها ورائحتها الزكية، بالإضافة إلى عدة أسماء وألقاب أخرى منها جِلَّق وحصن الشام وفسطاط المسلمين. كما تُسمَّى أيضاً الشام، على طريقة تسمية الفرع باسم الأصل. يُوجد خلاف كبيرٌ وافتراضات عديدة بشأن أصل اسم دمشق نفسه وطريقة اشتقاقه في العربية؛ فأنصار الجذر العربي للاسم يرونه ناجمًا عن مصطلح دَمْشَقَ في العربية القديمة أي «إذا أسرع»، ولذلك يُقال أن المدينة سُميت باسمها لأن «أبناءها دَمْشَقوا – أي أسرعوا – في بنائها». أما غالب المؤرخين الذين أعادوا اللفظة لكونها سريانية، أو لاتينية، لا العربية، فيرون أنه اشتق من كلمة دُومَسْكَس بمعنى المسك أو الرائحة الطيِّبة، فيما يَرى آخرون أنها سُمِّيت تيمناً بالقائد اليونانيّ دماس الذي أسَّسَ المدينة، ونظراً إلى ذكر المدينة في رسائل تل العمارنة والكرنك في مصر باللغة الهيروغليفيِّة تحتَ مُسمَّى دِمَشْقُوا ودَمْشَقَا؛ كما ساد الاعتقاد بأن الكلمة مشتقة من اسم أحد أحفاد النبي نوح دَمَاشِق.\nفي الأيام الراهنة، تعرف دمشق في اللهجة السورية باسم الشام؛ أما أكثر ألقابها شهرة فهي، مدينة الياسمين، وجلّق، والفيحاء، إلى جانب عدد من الألقاب الأقل انتشارًا مثل درة الشرق، شامة الدنيا، شام شريف والتي كانت منتشرة بشكل رسمي خلال سوريا العثمانية، كنانة الله، الدار المسقية.\n\nالتاريخ\nما قبل العصر البرونزي\nبحسب عمليات التنقيب والبحث التي تركزت في الغوطة ووادي نهر بردى فإن منطقة دمشق مأهولة بالبشر منذ ما يقارب 10,000 عام أي خلال مرحلة الصيد والانتقال، وقد عثر إضافة لآثار الإنسان العاقل على آثار لإنسان نياندرتال، وأبرز ما آثر عن تلك الحقبة فؤوس ومقاحف حجرية وغيرها من الأدوات اليدوية، غير أن الفترة الممتدة من انقراض إنسان نياندرتال قبل 40,000 عام وحتى 30,000 عام تلبث شديدة الغموض في تاريخ دمشق، وكذلك في تاريخ سائر الشرق الأوسط عمومًا، ثم تعود الآثار البشرية والحضرية للظهور مع دخول العصر الزراعي قبل 30,000 عام تقريبًا، إذ عثر على العديد من القرى والمستوطنات البدائية، خصوصًا في منطقة تل الأسود وتل الغريفة،  وقد عُثر في هاتين البقعتين من دمشق على أقدم مخازن الحبوب في العالم وبعض حبيبات من الشعير والقمح المتفحم، أما عن نمط الحياة حينها فقد بنى السكان الأوائل أكواخًا بيضوية صغيرة الحجم استخدم في بنائها الطين واللبن والقصب وهي من المواد التي كانت متوفرة بكثرة في المستنقعات والبحيرات التي كانت تسوّر المدينة، وجفّت مع تتالي الحُقب.\nوبحسب تحليل مادة الكربون 14 فإن موقع تل الرماد يرجع تاريخه إلى النصف الثاني من الألف السابع قبل الميلاد وربما نحو 6300 قبل الميلاد، وقد شهدت المستوطنة البشرية تطورًا حياتيًا فاستعمل الحجر في بنائها ورصفت شوارعها بالحجارة أيضًا، وعثر في موقع تل الغريقة على أقبية ومخازن ومواقد للشيْ، وطور السكان نظام سقاية بسيط، كما عثر أيضًا على عدد وافر من عظام الماعز والغنم وغيرها من الحيوانات المدجنة، ورغم عدم تمكن المنقبين من وضع تصور دقيق حول الفن والحياة الاجتماعية والدين في دمشق خلال تلك الفترة، إلا أنّ المكتشفات تدلّ على وجود نوع من الفن وحياة اجتماعية متكاملة في كلا الموقعين. مستوطنة تل الغريقة دمرت في الألف الخامس قبل الميلاد، غير أنه خلال الفترة نفسها بنيت مستوطنة ثالثة شمال الغوطة، ويشير الباحثون إلى أن عددًا من السكان عاد إلى التنقل بدلاً من الاستقرار بدليل آثار المنازل الضعيفة الصنع، والتي تشير إلى تنقل مستمر بين المناطق، وإلى وفرة عظام الحيوانات، ما يدلّ على امتهان الرعي. كما يشير تحليل الكربون 14 في ولعلّ تطور الحركة العمرانية في المدينة يبدأ من الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد. كانت دمشق جزءًا من مقاطعة آمورو القديمة في عهد مملكة الهكسوس، ما بين 1720-1570 قبل الميلاد، وتذكر بعض السجلات المصرية القديمة من رسائل تل العمارنة حوالي 1350 قبل الميلاد، أنها كانت تسمى في ذلك العهد ديماسكو، وأنها تحت سيطرة ملك مصر القديمة بيرياوازا. حوالي عام 1260 قبل الميلاد، أصبحت دمشق فضلا عن بقية البلاد، ساحة معركة بين الحيثيين من الشمال والمصريين من الجنوب، وانتهت المعركة بتوقيع معاهدة بين هاتوسيلي الثالث ورمسيس الثاني، والتي سلمت مقاليد السيطرة على منطقة دمشق لرمسيس الثاني عام 1259 قبل الميلاد. وحوالي 1200 قبل الميلاد، وصلت شعوب البحر إلى دمشق، ما وضع علامة على نهاية العصر البرونزي في المنطقة ودخول العصر الحديدي؛ والذي لم تكن دمشق فيه، في الجزء الطرفي في الصورة، بل أثرت على عدد من المراكز السكانية في سوريا القديمة.\n\nفي سوريا الآرامية\nيعود ظهور دمشق كمدينة على جانب من الأهمية إلى فترة سوريا الآرامية حوالي القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد؛ إذ أسس الآراميون سلسلة ممالك متحالفة مع بعضها البعض كانت آرام دمشق المذكورة في الكتاب المقدس إحداها؛ ويعود لتلك الفترة اكتساب دمشق لأقدم أشكال اسمها الحالي ديماشقو. أنشأ الآراميون نظام توزيع للمياه، وبنوا الترع وقنوات الري على أطراف نهر بردى، وهو ما ساهم بازدهار الزراعة وزيادة عدد السكان، خصوصًا من ناحية وفود قبائل آرام زوبة من سهل البقاع المجاور لدمشق، واستقرارهم في المدينة، وهو ما جعل دمشق تابعة لمركزهم في البقاع، حتى القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد، حين تمكّن إيزرون عام 965 قبل الميلاد من الإطاحة بـآرام زوبة مؤسسًا الكيان المستقل المعروف بآرام دمشق؛ التي بزرت كالقوة المتفوقة في جنوب سوريا الآرامية، وسعت للتوسع واحتكار طرق التجارة مع الشرق، وحاربت مملكة إسرائيل، لاسيّما في عهد بن حدد الأول (880 - 841 قبل الميلاد)، وفي عهد خلفه حزائيل غدت باشان المعروفة اليوم باسم حوران إلى مملكته؛ إلا أن بن حدد الثاني فشل في حصار السامرة ووقع في الأسر، ما اضطره إلى فتح المجال التجاري لليهود في دمشق؛ بكل الأحوال فإن التهديد الذي شكلته الإمبراطورية الآشورية كان أحد أهم أسباب عقد معاهدة السلام بين آرام دمشق ومملكة إسرائيل، لمواجهة الخطر المشترك على كليهما.\nفي عام 853 قبل الميلاد، قام الملك هدادايزر من دمشق بقيادة تحالف سوريا الآرامية، وقد شمل هذا التحالف قوات من شمال مملكة حماة، والقوات التي وفرها أحاب ملك إسرائيل؛ واحتدم القتال في معركة قرقر ضد الجيش الآشوري، والذي انتهى بانتصار التحالف الآرامي. قتل هدادايزر على يد خليفته حزائيل الثاني، وإنهار التحالف المعقود مع مملكة إسرائيل، فحاولت آرام دمشق غزوا مملكة إسرائيل مجددًا لكن الغزو الآشوري الثاني أفضى لإلغاء الخطة. أمر حزائيل الثاني بالتراجع إلى الجزء المحصن من دمشق، في حين نهب الآشوريون ما تبقى من المملكة، إلا أنهم فشلوا من دخول مدينة دمشق ذاتها، معلنين سيادتهم على حوران والبقاع. وبحلول القرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، تمكنت الإمبراطورية الآشورية من الاستيلاء على جميع الممالك الآرامية في سوريا بما فيها دمشق؛ وبالرغم من الاضطرابات السياسية والثورات التي شهدتها هذه الفترة، إلا أن المدينة اشتهرت كمركز تجاري وثقافي في سوريا الآرامية؛ كما ازدهرت كموقع للقوافل التجارية نحو الشرق والجنوب؛ ولم تضمحل اللغة أو الثقافة الآرامية بل انتشرت نحو الأجزاء الشرقية من الهلال الخصيب؛ وبحلول سنة 605 قبل الميلاد اضمحلت السيطرة الآشورية بعد سقوط نينوى بيد الميديين والبابليين، الذين ورثوا حكم سوريا، التي أضحت أو بعض أجزائها على الأقل ومنها دمشق ضمن نطاق سيطرة الفرعون نخاو الثاني، لفترة وجيزة، إلا أن الإمبراطورية البابلية الثانية تمكنت من استعادتها بعد فترة قصيرة. وأصبحت المدينة لاحقا بعد صعود الأخمينيين جزأ من إمبراطوريتهم.\n\nفي سوريا الأنتيكية\nلحوالي الألف عام وبدءًا من 331 قبل الميلاد، كانت دمشق جزءًا من سوريا الأنتيكية، أساسًا عبر حكمي الدولة السلوقية ثم ولاية سوريا الرومانية؛ وخلال بعض الفترات كانت دمشق جزءًا من ممالك الحكم الذاتي السورية، كدولة الأنباط في القرن الأول، ومملكة تدمر في القرن الثالث، ويذكر أن سكان دمشق استنجدوا بالملك النبطي الحارث الثالث عام 84 لحمايتهم من قطاع الطرق، وبذلك بلغت الدولة النبطية أقصى اتساعها. واكتسبت دمشق وضع مدينة حرّة، وهو ما كان يعفيها من الضرائب ويشجّع فيها التجارة، وشكلت حلف المدن العشر أو «الديكابوليس» بدءًا من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد؛ ومنحت في عهد الإمبراطور هادريان وضح متروبول أي مدينة كبرى، وإن لم تكن مركزًا لولاية حتى عام 400 حين قسّم البيزنطيون البلاد إلى أربعة ولايات، والتي كانت دمشق بموجبها عاصمة ولاية فينيقيا الثانية. ولعلّ أكبر كارثة حلّت بالمدينة، الاجتياح الفارسي عام 614 بقيادة كسرى الثاني، والذي انتهى عام 629 حين تمكن هرقل من طرد الفرس في سوريا.\n\nمكثت دمشق سريانية اللغة والثقافة في العصور الأنتيكية، رغم انتشار اليونانية فيها لاسيّما في الطبقات العليا، ولم تحلّ لغة الانثقاف مكان اللغة الأصلية كما حصل في مناطق عديدة لاسيّما في الساحل، وبرزت من دمشق شخصيات سورية يونانية الثقافة على مستوى الإمبراطورية مثل أبولودور؛ وشهدت دمشق في مرحلة سوريا الأنتيكية، ازدهارًا عمرانيًا، وتخطيطًا على نمط هيبوداموس وتوسعًا، واحتوت كعواصم العالم الإغريقي، مسارح، وساحات لسباق الخيل، وحمامات، وأقواس نصر، ومدافن فخمة، ويعود لتلك الحقبة من تاريخ دمشق، نمو سورها، وأبوابها، ويضيف بعض المؤرخين قلعتها. خلال مرحلة ما قبل الميلاد، انتشرت عبادة الإله الآرامي حدد - وهو المقابل لجوبتير الروماني، وزيوس اليوناني، ضمن سياسة توفيق الآلهة - في المدينة؛ ووصف بكونه سيّد دمشق، وشيّد على اسمه معبد جوبتير؛ ووجدت في دمشق جماعات ضخمة من يهود سوريا من مرحلة قبل الميلاد، وانتشرت فيها المسيحية منذ قرنها الأول، وحسب سفر أعمال الرسل، فإن القديس بولس، تحوّل إلى المسيحية قرب دمشق،أع 9:3] ومنها انطلق في النشاط التبشيري، بعد أن تمّت تدليته في سلة من إحدى نوافذ السور، إذ أراد الحاكم إلقاء القبض عليه وقتله.2كو 11:33]\n\nالخلافة الراشدة والأموية\nفي سبتمبر 635م فتح خالد بن الوليد دمشق سلمًا بعد ستة أشهر من الحصار، ومنح في إثرها الأمان لسكانها حسب صكّ التسليم المبرم بينه وبين أسقفها سرجون بن منصور؛ وهو الصك الذي استسلمت بموجبه سائر المدن السورية؛ وفي العام التالي (13هـ/636م) وقعت معركة اليرموك الحاسمة في تاريخ فتوح الشام. بعد الفتح استقرّ الولاة في دمشق، وبذلك انتقلت عاصمة البلاد من أنطاكية إليها؛ وبعد أربع سنوات من الفتح عيّن معاوية بن أبي سفيان واليًا على دمشق، خلفًا لأخيه يزيد بن أبي سفيان؛ وخلال فتنة مقتل عثمان أعلن معاوية التمرد على الخليفة علي بن أبي طالب، واستقلّ بحكم الشام، وبسط نفوذه في مصر عبر عامله عمرو بن العاص، وبعد خمس سنوات من القتال، انتهت الحرب في عام الجماعة (40هـ) بإعلان الدولة الأموية وعاصمتها دمشق؛ وبذلك يكون معاوية قد حكم دمشق أربعين عامًا عشرون منها كوالي، وعشرون أخرى كخليفة.\n\nوخلال «الفتنة الثانية» والتي كان قائدها في دمشق يزيد بن معاوية، نقل إلى دمشق رأس الإمام الحسين وعدد من نساء أهل البيت منهم السيدة زينب؛ كما استقر في دمشق عدد من زوجات النبي، والصحابة، ودفنوا فيها. خلال الصراع بين فروع الأسرة الأموية على الحكم وقعت معركة مرج راهط قرب دمشق بين أتباع الأمويين وأتباع عبد الله بن الزبير، والتي ثبتت البيت المرواني وزعيمه مروان بن الحكم في السلطة؛ وفي أعقاب حكمه لا سيّما أيام ابنه عبد الملك، وحفيديه الوليد وهشام، عاشت دمشق أزهى أيامها، فمع توسع الدولة وتدفق أموال الجباية على عاصمتها تكاثرت في دمشق القصور والحمامات وغيرها من المباني والمحال العامة، ويروي المؤرخون أن الناس إذا التقوا بعضهم في أيّام الوليد وهشام، كان حديثهم عن العمارة، وفنون البناء، ومجمل ما يمكن استنتاجه من خلال مصادر المؤرّخين، أن مدينة دمشق في العهد الأموي كانت تحفل بحلّة جميلة بعد أن نعمت بالمركز الممتاز، والخير العميم، والازدهار الاقتصادي، ويحدّث المؤرخون عن أحواض المياه والنواعير والسّقايات التي كانت منبّثة على أطراف الشوارع، وعلى أبواب المباني العامّة، وفي الأسواق والسّاحات، وعند أبواب المدينة، ولقد عدّد ابن عساكر عشرين منها كانت باقية إلى عهده يرجع أكثرها إلى عصر بني أميّة؛ ولعلّ «دار الإمارة» التي شيدها معاوية لتكون مقرًا له والتي سميت أيضًا «الدار الخضراء» نظرًا لقبتها الخضراء، إحدى أول وأبرز المشاهد العمرانية الأمويّة في المدينة، كما شيّد الأمويون مستشفيان كبيران داخل المدينة ودارًا للخيول.\nوبنى الوليد الجامع الأموي وأسرف في تزينه بالفسيفساء، وكذلك الحال في حلب، وكان الجامع الأموي مسجد دمشق الوحيد داخل الأسوار إلى جانب مصليين صغيرين خارجها، ولم يبن الأمويون سواهم. ونتيجة هذا الازدهار استقر حولها على ضفاف نهر بردى عدد من القبائل، وشقّ «نهر يزيد» من نهر بردى لتأمين الريّ لمساحة أكبر من الأراضي؛ كما اهتمّ الوليد أيضًا بالطرقات وربط المدن بعضها ببعض لا سيّما بين دمشق والبادية، حيث شيّد الأمويون ما يزيد عن عشرين قصرًا للتنزه وممارسة الرياضات المختلفة، وشهدت المدينة بالتزامن مع ذلك نهضة ثقافيّة. وبعد وفاة هشام أصيبت الدولة بالتصدع، وتعاقب عليها ضعاف الخلفاء، واندلعت فيها فتن دامية بين العرب من القيسية واليمنية، وخلع البيت الأموي نفسه خليفتين، ونقل مروان بن محمد آخر الأمويين، عاصمته إلى حران، ولم يتوقف تداعي صرح الدولة في عهده، وبختام العصر الأمويّ زال عهد دمشق الذهبي.\n\nالخلافة العباسية\nتابعت قوات الثورة العباسية تقدمها في أملاك الدولة بعد انتصارها على الأمويين في معركة الزاب عام 749م، حتى فرضت حصارًا على دمشق دام شهرًا ونصف الشهر، ثم تمكّن المحاصِرون من نقب السور عند باب الصغير، وفتحت المدينة للعباسيين، الذين ارتكبوا فيها قسطًا وافرًا من عمليات القتل، والنهب، والتدمير، وقد ذكرها مؤرخو تلك الفترة ومنهم المقدسي. وقد أهملت المدينة في العصر العباسي الاول، ولم تول أية أهمية، وشهدت عدة ثورات ضد الولاة العباسيين، منها ثورة عثمان الأزدي عام 753، وثورة 850 ضد المتوكل على الله لما مارسه واليها من «استذلال» لأهلها، ثم عام 868 بقيادة عيسى بن الشيخ الذي أعلنها دولة مستقلة استمرت حتى عام 896، حيث كلف المعتمد على الله أماجور التركي بالقضاء على دولة عيسى بن الشيخ، وهو ما تمّ له فعلاً. كذلك فقد اندلعت فتن وحروب أهلية بين القيسية واليمانية داخل المدينة بين 792 - 796، وفي عام 802 أيضًا. ويذكر أنّ المتوكل على الله أراد نقل حاضرة الخلافة من سامراء إلى دمشق، وكتب لواليه فيها بذلك، غير أنه لم يمكث فيها سوى شهرين وعاد إلى سامراء تحت ضغط رجال دولته الأتراك. ولم يترك العباسيون أثرًا معماريًا هامًا في المدينة باستثناء ما ذهب إليه عدد من المؤرخين بأن قبة الخزنة في الجامع الأموي إنما بنيت في خلافة محمد المهدي عام 774.\n\nخلال القرن العاشر الذي تميّز بضعف الدولة في بغداد، وانتشار الدويلات المستقلة في أرباضها، تتالى على حكم دمشق الطولونيون حتى عام 906، ثم الإخشيديون، وتعرضت المدينة في عهدهم لغارات شنها القرامطة والبيزنطيون؛ وتلا الإخشيد الحمدانيون 968 حين استعادها الإخشيد مجددًا عام 967، وكانت جزءًا من أملاك خلفائهم الفاطميين حتى 947، حين استنجد أهل دمشق بالقائد التركي أفتكين الذي وصل حمص، فزحف منها إلى دمشق للسيطرة عليها، وقد وقعت اثنتي عشرة معركة بين أفتكين والقائد الفاطمي جوهر، كان آخرها معركة الشاغور، التي خرجت بنتيجتها الشام عن حكم الفاطميين؛ إلا أنهم عادوا بعد فترة قصيرة، وساءت أيام الفاطميين أحوال المعيشة وهجرها السكان بنتيجة الغلاء، فانخفض عدد قاطنيها بشكل كبير، وقامت ثورات أحداث عامي 982 و999، واستمرّ حكم الفاطميين حتى 1075 حين سيطر عليها السلاجقة، بقيادة تتش بن ألب أرسلان ثم ابنه دقاق؛ اهتم السلاجقة بالناحية الدينية في دمشق خصوصًا إثر انتشار المذهب الشيعي في أعقاب سيطرة الفاطميين على المدينة، فأنشؤوا عددًا من المدارس الدينية مجانًا، كما اعتنوا ببناء البيمارستانات، وقد تحولت دمشق إلى دولة سلجوقية مستقلة بعد انفراط عقد الدولة السلجوقية الموحدة إلى مجموعة من الدول المسيطرة على المدن الكبرى في الشام.\n\nبعد نجاح الحملة الصليبية الأولى في تأسيس إمارات لها في الساحل الشامي، بلغت حدود مملكة بيت المقدس أطراف دمشق الجنوبية في الجولان، وتعرضت حوران لغارات عديدة من قبلهم، وهو ما هدد أمن دمشق واقتصادها، لكون حوران مصدر قمحها؛ وأبرمت دمشق السلجوقية عام 1110 هدنة مع مملكة بيت المقدس، وفي 1129 اتهم السلاجقة الإسماعيليون بالخيانة وقتل 6,000 إسماعيلي من سكان المدينة مع قادتهم؛ وشهد عام 1132 انتقام الإسماعيلية باغتيال تاج الدين البوري، حاكم دمشق السلجوقي؛ واستغلّ صليبيو القدس الوضع مجهزين جيشًا من 60,000 جندي للهجوم على المدينة، فقام تاج الدين بوري بالتحالف مع عماد الدين زنكي بهدف منع تقدم الجيش وهو ما نجح في تحقيقه؛ وفي عام 1148 ضربت الحملة الصليبية الثانية حصارًا حول دمشق إلا أنه باء بالفشل بجهود نور الدين زنكي حاكم حلب، الذي عاد فخلع السلاجقة عام 1154 موحدًا سوريا تحت حكمه؛ وبعد وفاة نور الدين واندثار الدولة الزنكية، تبعت دمشق حكم صلاح الدين والدولة الأيوبية التي شملت في عهده الشام، ومصر، والحجاز، واليمن؛ إلا أنه بعد وفاته عام 1193 انقسمت دولته بين الورثة، فكانت دمشق دولة أيوبية مستقلة بين 1193 - 1201، و1218 - 1245، و1250 - 1260. خلال فترة الحروب الصليبية، اكتسبت دمشق سمعة كبيرة لدى الصليبيين، فالحرير والخشب المزخرف والمطعم وغيرها من سلع الرفاهية إنما كانت تنقل عبر دمشق ومنها إلى أوروبا.\n\nعهد السلطنة المملوكية\nاعتبر المماليك الذين حكموا البلاد بدءًا من 1250 دمشق ثاني مدنهم بعد القاهرة لموقعها الحربي وغنى أراضيها؛ واعتبروها مركز نيابة بلاد الشام. وتتالت على دمشق في القرن الثالث عشر غزوات المغول المتلاحقة، وأشدها «غزوة غازان» التي وقعت في عام 1300، وقد بلغ عدد قتلى سكان المدينة حوالي مائة ألف شخص حسب ما نقل عن قدماء المؤرخين، إلى جانب إحراق مكتباتها وأسواقها، غير أنهم فشلوا في اقتحام قلعتها لمناعة موقعها وحصانة سورها المزدوج، فخرجوا من المدينة وأعيدت الخطبة لسلطان مصر.\n\nوفي عام 1402، قام المغول بحملة ثانية على دمشق بقيادة تيمورلنك، وقد أحرقت المدينة بما فيها الجامع الأموي، وسُبي منها بنتيجة الحملة عدد وافر من الصنّاع والحرفيين والعلماء إلى سمرقند، فساهموا بنهضتها الثقافية. وفي عهد السلطان برسباي (1422 - 1438) أصيبت بلاد الشام بدءًا من حلب وانتهاءً بالكرك بوباء مجاعة، حتى مات الناس من الجوع أو من الطاعون، ولعلّ عدم إيلاء المماليك للزراعة الاهتمام الكافي من ساهم في انتشاره، ويقول نقولا زيادة أنه لو لم تكن دمشق غزيرة المياه وخصبة الأراضي لما عادت إليها الحياة المزدهرة بسرعة ما كان، على أن المماليك لم يهملوا الزراعة فحسب بل الأمن أيضًا وباستثناء قلعة دمشق التي يتولى شؤون حراستها حامية معينة من القاهرة، فإن أحياء دمشق وحاراتها كانت معرضة لغزو البدو وقطاع الطرق، هذا ما دفع أهالي الأحياء لتسليح أنفسهم وتنظيم فرق من أهالي الحيْ تتولى الدفاع عن الحي، ثم أصبح لهذه القوى من الأمن ذاتي ما يشبه نقابات خاصة؛ كذلك فقد حُصر بآل السيوفي منصب شيخ المدينة، يتناقله أعضائها بالوراثة، ومن مهام شيخ المدينة تمثيل الأهالي ومطالبهم أمام الوالي، والتوسط لهم في القضايا المختلفة. رغم ذلك فإن عدد سكان المدينة كان ينمو باطراد وحينها كان حي الصالحية أكبرها، إضافة إلى ظهور أحياء جديدة وضواحي على أطرافها، وإلى جانب النمو الديموغرافي فإن نموًا اقتصاديًا شهدته المدينة خلال القرنين الرابع عشر والخامس عشر، وقامت عدد من الأسواق كسوق الدباغين وسوق الخيل وسوق ساروجة الذي كان أكبرها وأسرعها نموًا. وقد اهتم المماليك بتأسيس المدارس الشرعية الإسلامية ومنها المدرسة الظاهرية التي اشتهرت بزخرفتها، وأداروا ستة مستشفيات كبيرة تعرف باسم «البيمارستان» خلال مدة حكمهم، ومنذ القرن الخامس عشر غدت دمشق مركزًا هامًا للصوفيين، وقد برز من المدينة خلال حكم المماليك عدد من الشعراء والمؤرخين والفقهاء وغيرهم.\n\nفي سوريا العثمانية\nأوليت دمشق أهمية خاصة خلال زمن الدولة العثمانية ولقبت «بالشام الشريف»؛ وبعد معركة مرج دابق، دخل السلطان سليم الأول دمشق يوم 26 سبتمبر 1516، وكان أول أعماله ترميم الجامع الأموي؛ وقضى السلطان سليم في دمشق فترتين الأولى عام 1516، والثانية بعد عودته من مصر عام 1517، حيث أنفق معظمها في تنظيم الشؤون الإدارية للولاية، وفي عام 1524 ثارت دمشق بقيادة واليها جان بردي الغزالي، وانضمت إليها مدن أخرى كحمص وحماه، فسار فرحات باشا والي حلب بأمر من سليمان القانوني إليها، فقضى على التمرد قبل امتداده.\nبين العصرين المملوكي والعثماني استمرت الكتابة في مصنفات تربية الأطفال وتأديبهم، ونذكر من مصنفات تلك الحقبة ابن حجر الهيتمي (974-909هـ/1566 – 1503 م) الذي وضع وهو في مكة مصنفه الشهير\"تحرير المقال في آداب وأحكام وفوائد يحتاج إليها مؤدبو الأطفال. ويبين الهيتمي في مؤلفه هذا ما يحتاج إليه مؤدبو الأطفال من المعارف المتصلة بالتربية، ويعرض لأهم المبادئ التربوية التي توجه عمل المؤدبين في دور العلم.\nووقف المؤرخون الدمشقيون اللاحقون (م1546) أمام انتشار ظاهرة فساد الأخلاق في فترة القرن الذي سبقهم، والتي كانت محل استهجان ورفض ونقد لموقف السلطة السياسية منها، وبخاصة فيما يتصل بارتكاب الفواحش والجهر بها من شرب الخمر، وممارسة اللواط، وانتشار بنات الهوى في الأسواق.\nويكشف ابن طولون الصالحي (ت:953هـ/1546م) بأن لبنات الهوى بيوتاً خاصة بهن؛ إذ يذكر في أحداث شهر جمادى الأولى سنة 885هـ/ تموز 1480م أنه تم تخريب «..بيوت بنات الخطأ بين جامع التوبة وجامع الجديد بعد أن اشتريت القيسارية من ابن الصقر التاجر بمبلغ ثلاثين أشرفية، ثم انتقلت بنات الخطأ إلى جوار المدرسة اليونسية بالشرف الأعلى» \nغير أن اهتمام العثمانيين بالمدينة لم ينقص، فشيّدوا التكية السليمانية، ورمموا حي الصالحية، الذين لا يزالا ماثلين إلى اليوم، كأحد منجزات العثمانيين المعمارية المبكرة في سوريا، ولم يكن استقرار الولاة من شيم العهد العثماني، وهكذا تعاقب على دمشق في 148 سنة الأولى من حكم العثمانيين فيها ما لا يقلّ عن 138 واليًا ولم يدم منهم في وظيفته مدة سنتين إلا ثلاثة وثلاثون واليا؛ وبين عامي 1815 و1895 توالى 61 والي بمعدل والي في كل سنة ونصف. وكان الولاة دائمي النزاع مع الولايات المجاورة، فعلى سبيل المثال نشبت الحرب بين والي دمشق ووالي طرابلس الشام بين عامي 1664 و1667.\n\nأصبحت دمشق ميناءً بريًا للقوافل التجارية بين مختلف مناطق الدولة، وحسب شهادة الرحالة الفرنسي لوران دارفيو في القرن السابع عشر، فإن سكّان دمشق يحبون العيش برفاهة واقتناء الآثاث الفاخر، وأن منازل المدينة توحي بالعظمة لروعتها، أما فيما يخصّ التجارة فقد كتب درافيو أن دمشق واحدة من الأسواق الرئيسية في الدولة العثمانية فهي محط القوافل التجارية القادمة من مكة والهند وبلاد فارس محمّلة بمختلف السلع، ومكان لصناعة الأقمشة التي اشتهرت بها المدينة. وإلى جانب القوافل التجاريّة، فإن المدينة والتي كانت نقطة تجمّع لقوافل الحجاج المسلمين، قد اعتمدت على قوافل الحج في تأمين الوفرة النقدية وتنشيط عمليات البيع والشراء. لسوء الحظ، فإن قوافل الحج في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر قد تعرضت لهجمات من قبل البدو أو من قبل مقاتلي الحركة الوهابية وفشل الولاة المتعاقبون في الغالب في تأمين الحجيج ولعلّ أكبر الحوادث ما وقع عام 1757 حين نهبت القافلة التي كانت تحوي ستين ألف حاج بكامل ما تحمل. ونتيجة انعدام الأمن خلال تلك المرحلة انخفض عدد الحجاج إلى نحو ألفي حاج فقط ما أثر على اقتصاد دمشق بشكل بالغ السوء.\nفي عام 1724 أسندت ولاية دمشق إلى إسماعيل باشا العظم وهو «خير وال عرفته المدينة في العصر العثماني»، وله يعود تشيييد قصر العظم الذي اعتبره فيليب حتي «أروع أثر عربي في القرن الثامن عشر»، وفي عام 1771 دخلت المدينة في حوزة والي عكا ضاهر العمر إلا أنه اضطر للتنازل عنها سلمًا في العام التالي. وفي عام 1782 غدا أحمد باشا الجزار واليًا وكان حكمه قاسيًا إذ أضنك الشعب بالضرائب وضاعف من الأتاوة على التجار، وأصيبت دمشق وغوطتها بالقحط والجفاف عام 1793، وحين أعيد تعيينه واليًا عام 1803 أغلق أهل دمشق باب المدينة في وجه مندوبه سليمان باشا، ولذلك فرض عليهم غرامات طائلة وصادر أملاكهم ومكث واليًا إلى أن توفي عام 1804 قبل أن يعود الولاة العثمانيين المتعاقبين على تسيير شؤونها.\n\nوفي فبراير 1831 ثارت دمشق بعد إعلان الوالي ضريبة جديدة اعتبرها السكان باهظة، وشكّل أهالي حي الميدان ذي الغالبية الفقيرة نواة المنتفضين، الذين قاموا بمحاصرة الوالي وكبار حاشيته في القلعة، ثم اقتحموها قاتلين الوالي وكبار حاشيته، وساحلين جثته جارين إياها من حي إلى حي في شوارع دمشق.\nوفي العام نفسه، دخل إبراهيم باشا دمشق سلمًا باسم والده والي مصر محمد علي باشا، وكان حكم إبراهيم باشا في الشام إصلاحيًا من مختلف الجوانب، رغم الفترة القصيرة التي مكث بها في السلطة، إذ اضطر للانسحاب بضغط القوى الكبرى العسكري في 17 سبتمبر 1840. في عام 1845 نهب البدو قافلة تجار دمشق المتوجهة إلى بغداد وكانت مكونة من ثلاثة آلاف جمل فأفلس تجار المدينة وأصبحت طريق التجارة مع بغداد تمرّ بحلب والموصل أي أطول مما كانت عليه بثلاث مرات، وفي عام 1851 طبّق نظام التجنيد الإجباري للمرة الأولى بعد سقوط حكم محمد علي مع ما تركه من آثار سلبية تمثلت بالهجرة الداخليّة والخارجيّة على حد سواء وتراجع الاقتصاد وقسمة العائلات للحصول على إعفاء الرجل الوحيد؛ وشهدت دمشق مجازر 1860 التي أفضت لقتل آلاف المسيحيين؛ على أنّ الهزيع الأخير من القرن التاسع عشر كان عهد نهضة، لاسيّما في عهود الولاة المصلحين أمثال مدحت باشا، وغدت دمشق خلال تلك الفترة، إحدى ميادين النهضة العربية وتأسست بها صحف ومجلات، وانتشرت المدارس وأسست نواة الجامعة السورية، والجمعيات السياسية، والمسرح برعاية أبو خليل القباني، وتزايدت الآثار العمرانية وشقت ساحات المدينة البازرة أمثال ساحة المرجة فضلاً عن انطلاق سكة حديد الحجاز والاتصال بالتلغراف معها.\n\nدمشق المعاصرة\nعانت دمشق خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى من ضنك العيش بنتيجة المجاعة التي اجتاحت البلاد وموجات الهجرة، فضلاً عن كونها مقر الجيش العثماني الخامس، وتعسّف الحاكم العسكري جمال باشا السفّاح، الذي أسس ديوانًا للأحكام العرفية فيها، وبلغ ذروة قرارته بإعدام سبعة من وجهاء المدينة في 6 مايو 1916 وهو ما تحوّل إلى عيد للشهداء. في 30 سبتمبر 1918 انسحبت القوات العثمانية والوالي العثماني من دمشق مؤذنًة بانتهاء عصر سوريا العثمانية. وفي اليوم التالي وصلتها قوات من جيش الثورة العربية الكبرى، وبعدها بأيام فيصل بن الحسين، الذي نصّب في دمشق يوم 8 آذار/مارس 1920 ملكًا على سوريا (التي كانت تعني كامل بلاد الشام) خلال حفل إعلان الاستقلال وإنشاء المملكة السورية العربية. غير أن عهد الاستقلال لم يستمرّ طويلاً، إذ دخلت القوات الفرنسية دمشق بعد معركة ميسلون في 24 يوليو 1920، وفي سبتمبر أعلنت دولة دمشق المصغّرة ضمن خطة الانتداب الفرنسي لتقسيم سوريا إلى دويلات. في عام 1922 نقلت عاصمة البلاد إلى حمص ضمن الاتحاد السوري، على أن تبقى دمشق عاصمة إقليم دمشق فقط، وهو ما ألغي عام 1925 بعودة دمشق عاصمة الدولة السورية.\nعام 1925 وصلت الثورة السورية الكبرى إلى دمشق، وتحولت الغوطة إلى إحدى معاقلها الرئيسية، ولعلّ أبرز مرحلة في تلك الفترة أحداث 18 أكتوبر حين استولى الثوار على أحياء الميدان والشاغور ووصلوا حتى سوق البزورية وقصر العظم مقر مندوبي المفوضيّة الفرنسيّة العليا، وطردوا جميع عناصر الشرطة واستطاعوا الاستيلاء على ما فيها من أسلحة، وبلغ التماس ساحة المرجة، إلا أن قصف المدينة بالمدفعية الثقيلة من قاسيون أجبر المقتحمين على الانسحاب. في 1936 كانت دمشق شرارة الإضراب الستيني، وبعدها انطلقت منها احتجاجات 1939، التي أفضت لنزول وحدات الجيش الفرنسي السنغالية واحتلالها ساحات المدينة. خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية، نشبت معركة دمشق عام 1941 والتي أفضت لسيطرة الحلفاء ممثلين بالجيش البريطاني وقوات فرنسا الحرة على المدينة. بعد نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية، اندلعت من دمشق انتفاضة الاستقلال التي شهدت قصف دمشق للمرة الثانية، ونزول قوات بريطانية فيها، وبشكل عام أدت الانتفاضة لنيل الجلاء. بعد الاستقلال كانت دمشق مسرحًا لعدد من الانقلابات العسكرية أهمها انقلاب آذار 1949 وانقلاب 1954، الذي انطلق من حلب وأدى إلى حالة فوضى في دمشق لمدة يومين تخللتها عمليات سلب ونهب. وكرد فعل على حرب فلسطين وإنشاء إسرائيل، شهدت المدينة عام 1948 احتجاجات ومظاهرات تعرضت خلالها مواقع لليهود في المدينة وعدد من مقار البعثات الدبلوماسية، بما فيها مقر الأمم المتحدة، لعمليات نهب واعتداء، وكان أكبر هذه الاعتداءات تفجير كنيس المنشارة. خلال تمرد الإخوان المسلمين في الثمانينات، وقعت في دمشق عدة تفجيرات بين 1981 - 1986، واستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخة كان أكبرها تفجير الأزبكية. تأثرت المدينة بالصراع مع إسرائيل، فتعرضت دمشق الكبرى لاستهدافات صهيونية في أزمنة الحرب، مثل حرب حزيران 1967، وخارج أزمنة الحرب مثل اغتيال عماد مغنية عام 2008 وقصف مركز البحوث العلمية في جمرايا مرتين في 2013.\nتطورت المدينة على صعيد الخدمات والتخطيط العمراني وزادت المرافق العامة وغدت أكثر حداثة، وبرزت المشاريع المعمارية الضخمة فيها؛ كما أفضت الهجرة من الريف إلى المدينة والنزوح من الجولان وفلسطين إلى نشوء ضواحٍ سكنية ملحقة بدمشق مثل مخيم اليرموك والحجر الأسود.\n\nالثورة السورية\nاندلعت الأزمة السورية في مارس 2011، وشهدت دمشق احتجاجات سلمية لمدَّة سنة كاملة، قابلها النظام بعنف مفرط، ممَّا أنشأ أنواع مختلفة من الاحتجاجات المعارضة، التي تحولت إلى نزاع مسلح مع النظام؛ في 6 يناير 2012 انفجرت أول سيارة مفخخة في دمشق ما أسفر عن مقتل 26 شخصًا؛ وتكررت عمليات الاستهداف فيما بعد ولعلّ عملية بركان دمشق وزلزال سوريا، التي استهدفت قيادات بارزة في النظام، أهم عملية تفجير داخل المدينة. أيضًا، فإن المعارك الحربية، احتدمت في مناطق ريف دمشق، عازلةً المدينة عن أجزاء واسعة من ريفها، وعن بعض ضواحيها، وأفضت لحركة نزوح واسعة إلى المدينة؛ وبشكل عام تكررت الاشتباكات والمعارك في ريف دمشق وبعض ضواحي المدينة نفسها كمخيم اليرموك، وكذلك الاستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخة، وبقذائف الهاون والصواريخ، ما بعد مرحلة تحول الأزمة إلى صيغة العسكرة الكاملة؛ في حين عانت المدينة من الغلاء، وانقطاع الطرق، وانتشار الحواجز الأمنية بشكل كثيف إضافة إلى نزوح الآلاف من المناطق المحيطة بدمشق إلى المناطق الأمنة.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالتشكل الجيولوجي\nبدأ تشكل المنطقة التي تحتلها دمشق حاليًا منذ العصر الطباشيري، وتشير المعلومات المتوافرة أنه مع بداية الزمن الرابع كانت تغطي المنطقة بحيرة واسعة امتدت من الكسوة حتى الضمير، وكانت شواطئها أعلى من شواطئ بحيرة العتيبة الحالية بحوالي 125 مترًا، ويقوم نهر بردى ونهر الأعوج برفدها بالمياه باستمرار إضافة إلى الأمطار والأودية الفرعية والأنهار الموسمية الأخرى، ما أدى إلى قيام مناخ بارد وماطر وانتشار غابات كثيفة. منذ حوالي 500,000 سنة حصل جفاف نسبي في المناخ فتراجعت مياه البحيرة حتى بلغ ارتفاعها 15 مترًا فقط، وأدى تراجعها إلى تشكل تربة غوطة دمشق ومنطقة التربة السوداء الخصبتين نتيجة جملة نشاطات سيلية حتية، ولم يبق من هذه البحيرة سوى بحيرة العتيبة حاليًا، مع العلم أنه قبل حوالي 10,000 سنة حصل جفاف مناخي آخر أدى إلى تراجع مستوى ما تبقى من البحيرة لحدود 6 أمتار فقط.\n\nالموقع\nدمشق مدينة داخلية تبعد حوالي 80كم عن البحر الأبيض المتوسط قبالة سلسلة جبال لبنان الشرقية، وتقع على هضبة بارتفاع 690م عن سطح البحر، وتبعد عنها بيروت 85 كم إلى الغرب، وكل من عمان 180 كم والقدس 220 كم إلى الجنوب. وقد نوّه الجغرافيون والرحالة لحسن موقعها منذ القديم، حيث أن المياه المتوفرة بكثرة من الأنهار والينابيع والتربة الخصبة والمناخ المعتدل، ساهمت في عمران المدينة وازدهارها؛ ومما قاله فيها ابن حوقل: «هي أجمل مدينة من مدن الشام تقع في أرض مستوية.» تمتد المدينة من السفح الجنوبي لجبل قاسيون نحو الشرق إلى البادية وتحيط بها الغوطة من جميع الجهات، فهي قائمة في وسط الغوطة. كانت البساتين الخصبة سبب وجود دمشق الأساسي وغناها عبر العصور، مرتوية من فروع نهري بردى في الشمال، والأعوج في الجنوب، وكلاهما شديدي التشعب في سواقٍ تغطي المدينة والغوطة أيضًا. يتغذى كلا النهرين من ذوبان ثلوج سلسلة لبنان الشرقية، لاسيّما جبل الشيخ، الذي اكتسب اسمه لكونه مجللاً دومًا بالثلج الأبيض. يشكل جبل الشيخ أيضًا، مع سلسلته الجبلية، النهاية والحد لسهول دمشق الخصبة من ناحية الغرب. أما الجبل المحيط بالمدينة بحد ذاتها من ناحية الغرب أيضًا ليشكل «إسورة دمشق» فهو جبل قاسيون، الذي تبلغ أعلى قممه 1170 م فوق سطح البحر، ويعدّ أحد مراكز المدينة السياحية الهامة.\nتبلغ مساحة المدينة 105 كم2 بما فيها العمران المنتشر على جبل قاسيون، أما من دون احتساب العمران المنتشر على الجبل فتبلغ مساحتها 77 كم2.\n\nالأحياء والمناطق\nتعدّ المدينة القديمة أساس دمشق التاريخي، وهو ذات سور وعشرة أبواب تاريخية، وينصّفها الشارع الشارع المستقيم على نسق العمارة الرومانية، وتحوي عددًا من المعالم البارزة مثل القلعة، والجامع الأموي، وقصر العظم، وقصر الخضراء، وعدد من الأسواق التقليدية؛ والكثير من النمط العماري المعروف باسم البيوت العربية، وتعدّ من أهم معالم سوريا السياحية، وهي مدرجة على لائحة التراث العالمي منذ 1979. خارج المدينة القديمة، بدأت الأحياء بالنشوء منذ القرن الثالث عشر مع ساروجة، والشاغور، والميدان، وتابعت نموّها حتى القسم الثاني من القرن العشرين، فزحف العمران نحو سفوح قاسيون وبساتين الغوطة؛ في المحصلة فإنّ بلدات مستقلة عن دمشق باتت تعدّ جزءًا من المدينة، مثل برزة، وجوبر، والمزة، فضلاً عن الإنشاءات السكنية الحديثة مثل مشروع دمر، وكفر سوسة؛ في الآونة الراهنة تقسّم دمشق إلى 15 منطقة، تقسم هذه الأحياء بدورها إلى 95 حيًا، أما تاريخيًا فحتى بداية القرن العشرين كان التقسيم التقليدي لدمشق، يجعلها في ثمانية أثمان. بكل الأحوال، وبنتيجة توّسع المدينة، فهي ملتصقة بضواحيها، التي تتبع إداريًا محافظة ريف دمشق، بعض هذه التوسعات إنشاءات حديثة مثل جرمانا وأشرفية صحنايا، والبعض الآخر بلدات تاريخية مثل عربين، ودوما؛ يذكر أن عدد من أهالي دمشق انتقل من المدينة إلى الضواحي، لكون تكلفة الحياة وأسعار العقارات فيها أقل، ومن الشائع - كما في عدد كبير من مناطق العالم - أن يكون مكان استقرار الأفراد في المدينة، بينما مركز عملهم في الضواحي، أو العكس. وخلال الأزمة السورية أفضت المعارك والقصف، إلى دمار واسع في عدد كبير من هذه الضواحي، فضلاً عن هجرة معظم سكانها لداخل مدينة دمشق أو مناطق سورية أخرى.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ دمشق يتميز بكونه قاريًا جافًا إلى شبه جاف، إذ إن قمم سلسلة جبال لبنان الشرقية تمنع تأثيرات البحر المتوسط من الوصول إلى المدينة، وسوى ذلك فإن انفتاحها من ناحية الشرق والجنوب الشرقي على بادية الشام يجعلها عرضة لتأثيرات مناخية من البادية. أما درجات الحرارة فيبلغ مدى تغيرها خلال العام 18 درجة مئوية، تتجاوز خلال فصل الصيف الأربعين وتنخفض في فصل الشتاء لحوالي سبع درجات، وفي بعض الأوقات لما دون الصفر ما يؤدي إلى إصابة المزروعات بالصقيع فضلاً عن تساقط الثلوج. وعموما لا يتجاوز معدل الهطول المطري السنوي في دمشق بين 200 ملم، وهي غير منتظمة السقوط ما يجعل الاعتماد عليها في الزراعة أمرًا صعبًا، غير أن الروافد المائية وعلى رأسها نهر بردى يغني عن ذلك. أما الرياح التي تهبّ على دمشق فلها نوعان الرياح الغربية والجنوبية الغربية التي تكون محملة بدرجات عالية من الرطوبة، والرياح الشرقية القادمة من البادية التي تهبّ عادة في فصل الصيف مسببة ارتفاعًا في درجات الحرارة وعادة ما تكون محملة بالغبار.\n\nالسكان\nيَبلغ عدد سكان دمشق وريفها مُجتمعين وفقَ إحصاء عام 2010 حوالي 4.4 ملايين نسمة، مُوزعين كـ1,724 ألف نسمة في محافظة دمشق و2,701 ألف نسمة في محافظة ريف دمشق، و50% من هؤلاء ذكور في دمشق فيما أن نسبتهم تصل إلى حوالي 52% في ريفها، وبذلك يكون عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى أكبر تجمّع بشري في سوريا، ويقطنه حوالي 19.5% من الشعب، كما تعدّ المدينة بذلك أكبر مدن بلاد الشام، والرابعة في الوطن العربي. أما على صعيد مدينة دمشق الإدارية دون ضواحيها، فإنها تحتل المرتبة الثانية في سوريا بعد مدينة حلب، وبفارق ضئيل عن مدينة حمص، وهي المدن المليونية الثلاث في سوريا.\nكان مجموع سكان المدينة وريفها قد بلغ حسب إحصاء 2004 حوالي 4 ملايين نسمة، منهم 1.5 مليون في المدينة و2.5 في الريف. وأما في إحصاء 2007 فكان مجموع عدد السكان في المُحافظتين 4.15 ملايين نسمة، حيث احتلَّت ريف دمشق المرتبة الثانية بعد حلب بـ2,487,000 نسمة تليها دمشق في المرتبة الثالثة بـ1,669,000 نسمة، وأما حمص فكانت لا تزال في المرتبة الرَّابعة آنذاك بفارق 22 ألف نسمة عن دمشق. وفيما يخصُّ المستقبل يُتوقع أن يَصل عدد سكان دمشق وحدها بحلول عام 2025 إلى أكثر من 5.6 ملايين نسمة، وأما ريفها فسيَبلغ عدد سكانه 4.6 ملايين نسمة، لكن 80% من الزحف العمراني سيكون باتجاه الريف، وستزداد نسبة الأحياء العشوائية في محيط المدينة. لا يُمكن الحصول على إحصائيات دقيقة للتعداد التاريخي لسكان دمشق، وعُموماً يُوجد الكثير من التضارب في الإحصائيات المسجَّلة. مع تحسُّن الأمن والخدمات الصحية وتوفر الغذاء في فترة النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر والنصف الأول من القرن العشرين، بدأ ازدياد مضطرب في نمو السكان بالنسبة إلى المعدًّلات التاريخية، حيث تضاعف المعدل مرَّات خلال العقود الأخيرة. حسب آخر إحصاء سكاني عام 2010، بلغ عدد سكان المدينة وريفها 4.4 ملايين نسمة.\n\nيَتألف التركيب العرقيُّ لسكان دمشق بشكل أساسي من عرب سوريا الذين يمثلون حوالي 95% من إجمالي السكان، ويَليهم الأكراد بنسبة 4%، وبالإضافة إلى هؤلاء تُوجد أقليَّات أخرى من الأرمن والسريان والتركمان والشركس والأذريين والبشناق والألبان وهم من وفدوا إليها خلال العهد العثماني، تمثل معاً الـ1% المتبقية. الغالبية العُظمى من السكان هي من المسلمين الذي يمثلون 93% من سكان المدينة، تاريخيًا من السُّنَّة، مع هجرة حديثة للمدينة أو ضواحيها من سائر الطوائف. بشكل مميز تعدّ ضاحية الست زينب في الجنوب وحي شارع الأمين ذات أقلية شيعية اثني عشرية معتبرة، وضاحية حرستا (ضاحية الأسد سابقًا) وعش الوروار في الشمال، ذات غالبية علوية. يشكل المسيحيون حوالي 7% من سكان دمشق، وهم يتبعون أساسًا بطريركية أنطاكية وسائر المشرق للروم الأرثوذكس وبطريركية الروم الكاثوليك. بقي في دمشق عدد ضئيل من اليهود، إذ انخفضت أعدادهم بشكل كبير خلال النصف الثاني من القرن العشرين.\nعدد الطلاب في دمشق وريفها كبير وهذا يجعل المدينة من «المدن الفتيّة». بلغ عدد المتقدمين في دمشق لامتحانات شهادة التعليم الأساسي والشهادة الثانويّة بمختلف فروعها 64,262 طالبا مقابل 42,994 طالبا في ريفها. تبلغ نسبة الأميّة في المدينة حسب إحصاءات عام 2001 نحو 5.2% من السكان فقط وهي رابع محافظة سورية من حيث القضاء على الأمية، رغم ذلك فإن 33.3% من السكان أي ثلث دمشق حاصلون على التعليم الابتدائي فقط، وطبق الإحصاءات نفسها فإن 6.6% من السكان فقط حاصلون على شهادة جامعيّة؛ علمًا بأن دمشق تحقق أفضل النتائج في البلاد من هذه الناحية. أغلب الطبقات الأميّة والقليلة التعليم هي متقدمة في العُمر بينما تنال أغلب الأجيال الجديدة تعليمًا كاملاً، في حين تبلغ نسبة التسرّب الدراسي 7% من مجموع الطلاب فقط.\n\nالإدارة\nحسب المادة الخامسة من دستور سوريا فإن دمشق عاصمة البلاد، وهي بالتالي مقر الحكومة المركزية والهيئات السيادية في الدولة، كالرئاسة، والحكومة، والبرلمان، وأيضًا مقر البعثات الدبلوماسية، وأول قنصلية دبلوماسية افتتحت في دمشق هي قنصلية الكرسي الرسولي عام 1762؛ وتقع غالب مقرات البعثات الأجنبية في مناطق المالكي والمزّة. من ناحية إدارية، فإن دمشق هي محافظة سورية، وهي أصغر المحافظات الأربع عشر من حيث المساحة، والوحيدة التي فصل عنها الريف ومدن الضواحي، لتشكل محافظة أخرى هي محافظة ريف دمشق، ويقع مقرها في حرستا. طبقًا للقانون السوري، يعيّن رئيس الجمهورية المحافظ ويعفيه من منصبه، في حين يقوم ناخبي المحافظة بانتخاب مجلس مدينة لمتابعة تنفيذ القضايا الإدارية اليومية فيها. تقوم فروع دمشق من الهلال الأحمر السوري، والدفاع المدني السوري، والشرطة السورية، بمهام الإسعاف، والإطفاء، والطوارئ، وإدارة المرور، وحفظ الأمن الداخلي في المدينة؛ ويكون للضواحي فروعها الخاصة التابعة لمحافظة ريف دمشق. في مجلس الشعب السوري، تمثل دمشق منذ 1990 بعدد 29 نائبًا، وهو أعلى من حقها في التوزيع في حال توزيع النواب تناسبيًا لأعداد الناخبين بعشرة مقاعد، كما تعدّ دائرة انتخابية واحدة؛ تقليديًا فإن دمشق تنتخب الحزب الوطني خلال مرحلة الجمهورية الأولى، عدا انتخابات 1961 حين حصل الإخوان المسلمون 4 مقاعد مقابل 3 للحزب الوطني ومستقلين لسائر المقاعد، وهي آخر انتخابات تعددية جرت في سوريا، أما جميع الانتخابات اللاحقة خلال عهد الجمهورية الثانية كانت لمرشحي الجبهة الوطنية التقدمية.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتقليديًا فإن دمشق مدينة تجارية، ورغم تغيّر طبيعة طرق التجارية من القوافل التقليدية إلى الوسائل الحديثة، فإن دور المدينة كسوق استهلاكية وإنتاجية هامة في سوريا، ومصدرة لمنتجاتها للخارج لاسيّما دول مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربية لم يتوقف. منذ 1954 يقام سنويًا معرض دمشق الدولي وقد شاركت به عام 2009 ثمانية وأربعين دولة، ويعدّ أقدم معرض يقام في الشرق الأوسط، إلى جانب عدد من المعارض التخصصية الأقل أهمية. وفي عام 2012 تم وضع أول ميزانية مالية لمحافظة دمشق، حيث وضعت ميزانية قدرها 25 مليار ليرة سورية (حوالي نصف مليار دولار). خُصِّص 10% من الميزانية للمشاريع الطارئة، وتركز الباقي على مشاريع التنمية والخدمات العامة، كشق الطرقات وبناء الجسور وحفر الأنفاق. في عام 2009 افتتح سوق دمشق للأوراق المالية، بوصفه الأول والوحيد في سوريا. كما تحتوي دمشق على عدة نشاطات صناعية، فإلى جانب الصناعات التقليدية، مثل الحلويات الدمشقية، والسيف الدمشقي، والتطعيم بالخزف، والمنسوجات اليدوية بأنواعها، والتي تراجع دورها وأهميتها في العصور الحديثة، فإن ضواحي دمشق تحوي عددًا من المدن الصناعية مثل مدينة حوش بلاس الصناعية ومدينة عدرا، وتحوي مصانع عامّة وخاصة، بشكل خاص لصناعة المواد الغذائية المعتمد على إنتاج الغوطة الزراعي والحيواني، ومواد البناء، والملابس والمنسوجات، والعطور، وبعض الصناعات الثقيلة. أما بالنسبة لسوق العقارات في دمشق فهو مزدهر، وحسب تقرير أعده مستشاري المؤسسة العقارية كوشمان ويكفيلد آند، والذي أفاد أن دمشق تعدّ ثامن أغلى مناطق العالم من حيث سعر المتر المربع في عام 2009.\n\nرغم أن قطاع السياحة قد دمّر بالكامل بنتيجة الأزمة السورية، فإنّ دمشق تعدّ مدينة سياحية بامتياز، ووضعت حسب بعض التصنيفات ضمن قائمة المواقع السياحية الأكثر أهمية في العالم؛ وقد قدّر عدد السيّاح الأجانب في سوريا عام 2010 بنحو 6 ملايين سائح، لتحتل بذلك المرتبة الثالثة في النمو السياحي. نتيجة ذلك، فإن دمشق تحوي جميع عناصر الصناعة السياحية، كالفنادق، وبشكل خاص البيوت العربية التقليدية التي تحولت إلى فنادق في المدينة القديمة، والفنادق الحديثة مثل فندق الفورسيزون وفندق الشام، فضلاً عن المطاعم ومن أشهرها بوابة دمشق، وصالات الرقص والترفيه، والمكاتب السياحية لتنظيم الرحلات إلى المواقع المختلفة.\n\nخدمات\nالإعلام\nمنذ تأسيسهما أواسط القرن العشرين، فإن دمشق مقر الإذاعة والتلفزيون السوري الرسمي، وكذلك الصحف الوطنيّة الثلاث صحيفة تشرين، وصحيفة الثورة، والبعث؛ خلال الفترة الممتدة بين 1963 - 2004 كانت الدولة السورية تحتكر وسائل الإعلام، خارج هذه الفترة وجدت ومنذ 1878 وجدت في دمشق منابر إعلامية خاصة لاسيّما الصحف والمجلات، حاليًا يوجد أكثر من 60 صحيفة ومجلة تصدر في دمشق. تعدّ دمشق أيضًا مقرًا للعديد من الإذاعات والتلفزات الخاصة، مع مكاتب إعلامية دائمة لعدد من القنوات الإقليمية أو الدولية؛ فضلاً عن كونها مقر وكالة الأنباء الرسمية سانا.\n\nالتعليم\nعام 2005 كانت دمشق تحوي 426 مدرسة حكوميّة ابتدائيّة و81 مدرسة حكوميّة ثانويّة و47 مدرسة حكوميّة مهنيّة، في حين يحوي ريفها 937 مدرسة ابتدائيّة و130 مدرسة ثانوية و81 مدرسة مهنيّة، كانت الدولة السوريّة ومنذ العام 1963 تحتكر القطاع التعليمي بكامل مفاصله، ففي عام 2004 سُمح لقطاع الخاص بالاستثمار في السلك التعليمي وشهدت العاصمة تأسيس عدد وافر من المدارس الخاصة الوطنية أمثال «واحة الشام» أو فروع لمدارس في المنطقة العربية أمثال «مدرسة الشويفات»، على أن الطبقات الثريّة في المجتمع وحدها من تتجه نحو المدارس الخاصة بسبب أقساطها المرتفعة وغير المتلائمة مع متوسط دخل المواطن. في عام 1913، أنشئت أول جامعة بالمفهوم المعاصر في دمشق وهي «مدرسة الحقوق» التي أنشئت أواخر العهد العثماني، وشكلت نواة «الجامعة السوريّة» التي أنشأت في عهد صبحي بركات عام 1923، وحوّل اسمها لاحقًا إلى جامعة دمشق، وهي مدارة من قبل الحكومة السوريّة ويبلغ عدد الكليات التابعة لها 16 كلية و11 معهد عالي؛ ويبلغ عدد الطلاب فيها 115,256 طالب بموجب إحصاءات العام 2007؛ إلى جانب التعليم الحكومي الشبه مجاني بهذه الصيغة، هناك التعليم الموازي والتعليم المفتوح في جامعة دمشق؛ هناك أيضًا الجامعة الافتراضية السورية، والمعهد العالي لإدارة الأعمال والمعهد العالي للعلوم التطبيقية والتكنولوجيا، بعد السماح للقطاع الخاص الاستثمار في حقل التعليم العالي انتشرت في ضواحي دمشق عدد من الجامعات الخاصة أمثال الجامعة السورية الخاصة والجامعة العربية الدولية والجامعة الدولية للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالرياضة\nيتوفر في مدينة دمشق منشآت رياضية لعدة رياضات شعبية مثل كرة القدم، وكرة السلة، والسباحة، والتنس، وتنس الطاولة والفروسية والشطرنج. وقد برز الاهتمام بالمنشآت الرياضية في أعقاب استضافة المدينة لأحداث رياضية هامة منها دورة الألعاب العربية الخامسة والسابعة بين عامي 1976 و1992 على التوالي، ومهرجان الشباب العربي عام 1981، إلى جانب العديد من الفعاليات الأخرى الأصغر حجمًا. كما تعدّ دمشق موطن لكثير من الأندية العريقة التي تنشط في الدوري الممتاز السوري لكرة القدم، هي نادي الجيش، ونادي الوحدة، ونادي المجد. تحوي دمشق مدينة الفيحاء الرياضية التي تضم ملعبًا لكرة القدم وصالات مغلقة لكرة اليد والسلة والطائرة ونوادي ومنشآت للجودو ورفع الأثقال والجمباز وملاعب تنس ومسابح. كما يوجد أيضًا ثلاث منشآت رياضية كبيرة في المدينة هي ملاعب تشرين والجلاء والعباسيين، ويوجد أيضا ميدان للفروسية وآخر للرماية في صحنايا على مقربة من دمشق.\n\nالصحة\nتحوي دمشق 43 مشفى خاص، وثلاثة مشافي كبيرة تديرها الحكومة أهمها مشفى تشرين، ومشفى المواساة الجامعي؛ تدير الحكومة أيضًا عددًا من المراكز الصحية موزعين على قطاعات دمشق الخمسة عشر، تقدم نحو 2.5 مليون خدمة طبية سنوية حسب الأرقام الرسمية. تقليديًا، فإنّ البيمارستانات كانت مشافي دمشق التاريخية، وأهمها البيمارستان النوري.\n\nمعالم\nأسواق\nتحوي مدينة دمشق نمطًا تقليديًا من الأسواق المسقوفة، داخل الأسوار وخارجها، أبرز أسواق دمشق المسقوفة أربع: سوق الحميدية، وسوق مدحت باشا، والبزورية، والحريقة، فضلاً عن وجود الأسواق التخصصية مثل سوق الصاغة المتخصص ببيع المجوهرات والمصاغ؛ بشكل عام يمكن إحصاء خمسين سوقًا تقليديًا متنوع الاستخدامات في مدينة دمشق؛ وتشكل فضلاً عن كونها ذات أهمية تراثية وأثرية كبيرة، أحد شرايين المدينة الاقتصادية حتى وقتنا الراهن. ويلاحظ بشكل خاص في سوريا العثمانية ازدهار «الخانات»، وهي بناء مربع من طابقين في وسطه ساحة مكشوفة يستخدم في الدور الأسفل كمستودع للبضائع والمعاملات التجارية وفي الدور الأعلى كمنامة للتجار، على أن أغلب الخانات تحولت لمتاحف، وأبرزها خان أسعد باشا. الأشكال الحديثة من الأسواق، يمكن تقسيمها إلى فئتين: الشوارع التي تكثر فيها المحلات التجارية مثل شارع الشعلان، وشارع الحمراء، ويعدّ البعض منطقة أبو رمانة بوصفها الوسط التجاري لدمشق الحديثة؛ والمراكز التجارية الكبيرة، وتحوي دمشق عددًا كبيرًا منها مثل: مالكي بلازا مول، شام سيتي سنتر، قاسيون مول، والآب تاون.\n\nحدائق وأضرحة ونصب\nتقليديًا يعدّ جبل قاسيون الفسحة الرئيسية لسكان دمشق، إلى جانب الجبل فإنّ مدينة دمشق تحوي 172 حديقة عامة تديرها محافظة دمشق، و790 حديقة خاصة ملحقة بالمنازل؛ تبلغ المساحة التقريبية لحدائق دمشق 1.4 مليون كليومتر مربع، أهم حدائق دمشق العامة وأكبرها حديقة تشرين، وحديقة السبكي، وحديقة التجارة. أبرز النصب العامة في مدينة دمشق، نصب الجندي المجهول في جبل قاسيون؛ ونصب ساحة المرجة التاريخي الذي أقيم لمناسبة ربط المدينة بالتغراف، ونصب السيف الدمشقي في ساحة الأمويين، والذي غدا «رمزًا من رموز مدينة دمشق المعمارية»؛ ونصب صلاح الدين الأيوبي مقابل سور القلعة؛ كما يترفع نصب يوسف العظمة في وسط ساحة المحافظة، شاهرًا سيفه.\nتحوي دمشق 33 مقبرة عامة، أبرزها مقبرة باب الصغير ومقبرة الدحداح والتي تحوي قبورًا لشخصيات تاريخية عديدة؛ في المقبرتين المذكورتين تصل كلفة القبر لحوالي 500.000 ليرة سورية وغالبًا ما تتوارثه العائلة؛ غلاء أسعار القبور في دمشق دفع شرائح من السكان لدفن موتاها في الضواحي، على سبيل المثال في حرستا لا تتجاوز تكلفة القبر 20.000 ليرة سورية. أما أبرز الأضرحة، فسوى ضريح يوحنا المعمدان - يحيى - في الجامع الأموي، وضريح الست زينب في الضاحية المعروفة بالاسم في جنوب دمشق؛ فإن دمشق تحوي أكثر من 65 ضريحًا ألّفت حولها كتب مثل كتاب مشيدات دمشق ذوات الأضرحة؛ هذه الأضرحة تتنوع لشخصيات دينية مثل أم سلمة وحفصة بنت عمر بن الخطاب من أمهات المؤمنين، وصحابة مثل بلال الحبشي ودحية الكلبي، وأمراء مثل نور الدين زنكي، وصلاح الدين الأيوبي، والظاهر بيبرس، وفلاسفة وعلماء مثل محي الدين بن عربي والفارابي، وأخيرًا شخصيات سياسية معاصرة مثل شكري القوتلي.\n\nدور الثقافة\nتأسس المسرح في دمشق على يد أبو خليل القباني في القرن التاسع عشر، ويعدّ أول مسرح عربي حديث؛ في الأيام الراهنة تحوي دمشق 25 مسرحًا تديرها وزارة الثقافة أو الجهات الخاصة موزعة على 151 دار، أبرز مسارح دمشق دار أوبرا دمشق في ساحة الأمويين. أول دور السينما في دمشق تأسس عام 1916 حاليًا تحوي دمشق 36 دار للسينما بعضها لا زال في الخدمة منذ تلك الفترة؛ وتحوي دمشق أيضًا تسعة متاحف سورية، أبرزها المتحف الوطني الذي يحوي آثارًا من مختلف المحافظات السورية، فضلاً عن متحف دمشق التاريخي المؤسس لتوثيق الحياة في مدينة دمشق عبر القرون، إلى جانب المتاحف التخصصية، مثل متحف الخط العربي، والمتحف الحربي السوري، وغيرهما من متاحف المدينة السبعة. على صعيد المكتبات العامة، فإنّ المكتبة الظاهرية تعدّ من أكبر مكتبات الشرق من حيث المخطوطات القديمة والمؤلفات المحفوظة بها، والمكتبة الوطنية السورية التي افتتحت عام 1984 لتكون دارًا عامة للكتب في المدينة. إلى جانب المراكز الثقافية الوطنية، تحوي دمشق عددًا من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية الملحقة بالبعثات الدبلوماسية، وتحوي الضواحي في مجمل محافظة ريف دمشق على 132 مركزًا ثقافيًا تابعًا لوزارة الثقافة.\n\nدور العبادة\nتحوي دمشق على حوالي 200 مسجد، و36 كنيسة، و10 كنس يهودية، لم يبق في الخدمة حاليًا منها سوى اثنان وبشكل غير متصل.\nويعدّ الجامع الأموي، أشهر مساجد دمشق، ومعالمها الدينية إجمالاً، واعتبره البعض رابع المساجد شهرة في الإسلام، تاركًا آثاره المعمارية على عدد من الأبنية الأخرى داخل وخارج سوريا. كما مساجد بارزة أخرى ذات أنماط أيوبية - مملوكية، أو عثمانية نذكر منها على المثال التكية السليمانية، وهناك أيضًا المساجد الحديثة؛ ويمكن تصنيف مساجد دمشق بثلاث تصنيفات المساجد بأصلها، والمساجد التي أنشأت كمدارس، والمساجد التي أنشأت كأضرحة. وتعدّ المدينة مقرًا دائمًا لثلاثة صروح بطريركية إنطاكية أبرزها الكنيسة المريمية، وكنيسة الزيتون، وتوجد إلى جانب هذه الكنائس الأثرية كنائس حديثة النمط المعماري مثل كنيسة الصليب في القصاع. إلى جانب دور العبادة، فإن الجهات المديرة لهذه الأماكن، تدير عددًا من المؤسسات المتصلة بها مثل مجمع الدراسات الإسلامية.\n\nنمط العمارة\nالأسلوب المعماري التقليدي في دمشق، هو ما يعرف في سوريا باسم البيت العربي وهو الأساس المعماري في المدينة القديمة، التي تتميز بالشوارع المرصوفة بالحجارة، والأزقة الضيقة، والإسراف في الزخرفة والتطعيم. منذ أواخر القرن التاسع عشر وبداية القرن العشرين، تطور أسلوب العمارة في دمشق، وانفتح على أساليب متعددة فرضتها تدخلات المعماريين الأجانب في عمارة بعض المنشآت العامة ثم تسربت اتجاهات العمارة الأوروبية الشائعة بواسطة المعماريين المحليين الذين درسوا في الغرب؛ وفي عام 1936 وضع أول مخطط تنظيمي شامل لمدينة دمشق على يد المعماري الفرنسي دانجييه عام 1936، والذي اهتم بصورة خاصة بتخطيط الشوارع الرئيسية وإنشاء الساحات الكبيرة الدائريّة، وفي عام 1963 قام المعماري الفرنسي ميشيل إيكوشار بتخطيط عمراني جديد لدمشق ساهم في توسعها نحو الجبال والشمال بشكل كبير، وقد صدرت عدة مخططات تنظيمية أخرى كان آخرها عام 2010، ركز هذا التخطيط الأخير على الضواحي والتوسعات.\nويمكن ملاحظة أنواع معمارية مختلفة في المدينة، مكتب عنبر على سبيل المثال يتبع نمط المحلي مضافًا إليه العمارة الباروكية، بينما محطة حديد الحجاز تتبع النمط الكلاسيكي الجديد مع طغيان العناصر المحلية في الزخرفة والتطعيم وجميع التفاصيل البناء الداخلية، وكذلك حال مبنى البرلمان، أما حي الصالحية يغلب عليه الطراز المتوسطي مثل مدرسة الفيحاء، في حين أن الطراز الكولونيالي يمكن أن تصنف ضمنه عدة أبنية منها مبنى العابد. الطراز الأوروبي التقليدي الذي ساد في القرن التاسع عشر وبدايات القرن العشرين، يصنّف ضمنه عدد كبير من أبنية دمشق التي بنيت في تلك الفترة، أبرزها فندق الشرق؛ ويعود للطراز المعماري الحديث كل من مبنى المكتبة الوطنية السورية، ومبنى دار أوبرا دمشق، والبنك المركزي.\n\nطرق النقل والساحات\nتنظم حركة النقل والمواصلات في دمشق، عدد من المحاور والطرق السريعة والعادية، المزودة بالجسور والأنفاق، أبرزها المتحلق الجنوبي، الذي يمرّ فوق مدينة دمشق رابطًا إياها بالريف، ومنتهيًا في شارع شكري القوتلي وسط المدينة؛ ويمتدّ المتحلق الشمالي بطول 37 كم، الذي يتصل مع الضواحي في الهامة مارًا فوق وادي بردى، وينتهي في حي الميدان. كذلك فإن ساحة الأمويين، وساحة العباسيين، تعدّان أبرز ساحتين في قلب المدينة وأكبرهما، وتقوم عقدة قصر الشعب وجسر المهاجرين المقام الأساسي في عقد المواصلات للقسم الغربي من المدينة، وعقدة القابون أساس قسمها الشرقي؛ وتقليديًا في ساحة المرجة تعدّ ساحة وسط مدينة دمشق. أما الطرق السريعة لخارج دمشق الكبرى، فأقدمها وأهمها طريق بيروت الشام، الذي يصلّ دمشق أيضًا بالمناطق الغربية من ريفها كالزبداني؛ والطريق الثاني هو طريق الأردن، الذي يربط دمشق بالمحافظات الجنوبية حتى عمان، والطريق الثالث شمالاً نحو حمص وحلب؛ وهناك أيضًا طريق تدمر وطريق المطار، بالاتجاه الشرقي من دمشق.\n\nبين 1903 - 1962 كان ترام دمشق يستخدم داخل المدينة؛ أما سكك الحديد في دمشق بدأت عام 1895 بربط دمشق ببيروت، عبر عدة محطات على الطريق، وأنشأ عام 1900 الخط الحديدي الحجازي لربط المدينة بجنوبها حتى المدينة المنورة، وبشمالها حتى حلب واسطنبول، إلا أنه متوقف منذ الحرب العالمية الأولى، ومستبدل بآخر محلي يربط دمشق بحمص ومنها إلى سائر المحافظات الشمالية والغربية؛ كشفت الحكومة السوريّة مؤخرًا عن مشروع ربط المدن القريبة في ريف دمشق بالمدينة عن طريق سكك الحديد أيضًا، في حين تنفذ حاليًا مشروعًا لربط المدينة بسكك الحديد مع درعا والقنيطرة. وفي عام 2008، أعلنت الحكومة عن خطة لبناء مترو دمشق مع وقت افتتاح الخط الأخضر، ومن المقرر افتتاح المرحلة الأولى منه عام 2015، والمرحلة الرابعة والأخيرة عام 2050. أما المطار الرئيسي منذ 1975 هو مطار دمشق الدولي، على بعد 20 كيلومتر من مركز المدينة، وولجه 5.5 مليون مسافر خلال عام 2010 بزيادة تقدر 50% عما كان عليه عدد الوالجين خلال عام 2004؛ قبل مطار دمشق كان مطار المزة يعدّ بوابة دمشق الجويّة، وحوّل للاستعمال العسكري بعد افتتاح مطار دمشق.\nالنقل العام يتم من خلال سيارات الأجرة أو الحافلات الصغيرة التي تربط ضواحي المدينة بعضها ببعض، ويبلغ عدد مجمل الخطوط 100 خط يصل بعضها إلى قلب المدينة، وبعضها الآخر إلى الضواحي، مع تفوق لسيارات الأجرة. تواجه دمشق في السنوات الأخيرة أزمة مرورية متزايدة، حيث تسجَّل فيها 250 سيارة جديدة كل يوم، وهناك 40 عقدة مرورية بها بحاجة إلى حل، ويقدر إجمالي النقص في الحافلات العامة بمقدار 1,800 إلى 2,200 حافلة للنقل العام لتلبية احتياجات المدينة، فضلاً عن غياب المرائب التأرضيّة. وتعدّ سرعة السيارات في دمشق، مراقبة عبر هيئة مرور دمشق، التي وزعت ضوابط للعدادات وكاميرات مراقبة في شوارع المدينة.\n\nالثقافة\nثقافة أهل دمشق تعدّ جزءًا من الثقافة السورية بشكل عام، مؤثرة ومتأثرة بها، فبينما تعدّ دمشق أصل العراضة الشامية، ورقصة السيف والترس التي انتقلت إلى المدن الأخرى، فإنّ الأنماط التقليدية للغناء، وأغاني دمشق التراثية التي يعود تأليف أشهرها لأبي خليل القباني، وفدت من ناحية النمط والأسلوب من حلب. من عادات دمشق شبه المندثرة، إقامة الاحتفالات الخاصة لمناسبات الولادة، أو الختان، ويتم تقليديًا في عمر سبع سنوات؛ والاحتفالات التي تقام في الحمامات العامة، وحضور الحكواتي والكركوزاتي أو مسرح خيال الظل؛ وقد فصّل عدد كبير من المؤرخين أنواع الاحتفالات التي تقام في دمشق، ومجالس اللهو والطرب التقليدية منها الأصفهاني في كتاب الأغاني، من ناحية المطبخ السوري في دمشق، فللمدينة بعض أصناف من الأطباق تختصّ بها وحدها مثل حراء بأصبعو، كما تعدّ السيارين أو السياحة في بساتين الغوطة أو جبل قاسيون، أحد عناصر ثقافة دمشق، والتي حسب ما ذكره المؤرخون، ذات أصول معينة، ففي سبع سبوت في العام تتم في الغوطة، وفي خمسة أخمسة في العام تتم في قاسيون، إلى جانب الاحتفال ببدأ فصل الربيع أو النوروز من عموم أهل دمشق. اللهجة السورية السائدة في دمشق ذات ألف مثقلة أكثر من باقي المدن والمناطق وهو ما يميّزها؛ في الدراما السورية، ومع مسلسل أيام شامية عام 1992 برز نمط جديد يعرف باسم مسلسلات البيئة الشامية، والذي يوّثق الحياة اليومية لأهل دمشق من مختلف الصعد والجوانب في مرحلة سوريا العثمانية، أو بدايات الانتداب الفرنسي، يذكر أنّ مسلسل باب الحارة حقق في جزءه الثاني جماهيرية شعبيّة في الوطن العربي دفعت صحيفة الواشنطن بوست لاعتباره أحد الأعمال التلفزيونية العشرة الأكثر متابعة حول العالم. رغم ذلك، فإنّ هذه الطائفة من الدراما استقطبت انتقادات واسعة وذهب عدد متزايد من النقاد لاعتبارها لا تنقل واقع دمشق شكل أمين بل بشكل مشوّه. وقد أنشأت القرية الشامية، كمنطقة تحاكي دمشق في تلك المرحلة. في عام 2008 تم اختيار دمشق عاصمة للثقافة العربية، وأقيمت العديد من الفعاليات والنشاطات ضمن الاحتفالات، وصدرت العديد من الأعمال التوثيقية حول دمشق للمناسبة.\n\nفي الشعر والأدب\nمن شعرها في وصف دمشقعائشة الباعونية[من ]\n\nعبر التاريخ، وصفت دمشق ومدحت في العديد من الآداب العالمية من قبل الرحالة، والشعراء، والروائيين، بعضهم أجانب مثل الرحالة الفرنسي لامارتين، والبعض الآخر عرب. مدح دمشق في الأدب العربي يعود لما قبل الإسلام حتى، وقد مدح حسان بن ثابت دمشق ببضع أبيات؛ أما أبرز من مدح دمشق في الأدب القديم، فيذكر البحتري، وأبي تمام في الشعر، وابن جبير والمقدسي في أدب الرحلات، كما وضعت مؤلفات مستقلة في وصف دمشق مثل كتاب «النجوم الزاهرة في أخبار دمشق والقاهرة»، وكتاب «نزهة الأنام في محاسن الشام» للبدري. حديثًا، ومنذ النهضة العربية في القرن التاسع عشر، فإن معظم شعراء العرب البارزين، من سوريين وغير سوريين، قد كتبوا عن دمشق، منهم أحمد شوقي، محمود درويش، سعيد عقل، عمر أبو ريشة، نزار قباني، بشارة الخوري وسواهم. هذه الأعمال جمعت في ديوان دمشق الذي أطلق لمناسبة احتفالية دمشق عاصمة الثقافة العربية؛ والبعض منها، تحولت إلى أغاني مثل قصيدتي شام يا ذا السيف وقرأت مجدك لسعيد عقل وقد غنتهما فيروز، والقصيدة الدمشقية لنزار قباني وقد غنتها أصالة نصري.\n\nمدن شقيقة\nالمدن الشقيقة لدمشق هي:\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر أيضًا\nالجدول الزمني لتاريخ دمشق.\n\nالمراجع\nكتب\nمواقع خارجية\n\nموقع محافظة

      "summary": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمة الجمهورية العربية السورية، ومركز محافظة دمشق. وهي إحدى أقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ أحد عشر ألف عام تقريبًا، وأقدم مدينة - عاصمة في العالم. أصبحت عاصمة منطقة سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عدة نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، أوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظة سامية قديمة بمعنى الأرض المسقية؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينة الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديدة، مشكلاً بذلك غوطة دمشق؛ وأيضًا يتميز موقع المدينة بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسمية دمشق على المدينة القديمة حتى القرون الوسطى، حين أخذت المدينة بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتألف دمشق من خمسة عشر منطقة سكنية متصلة بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينة تعدّ المركز الإداري لمحافظة دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي إداريًا لمحافظة ريف دمشق. حسب إحصاءات عام 2013 فإن عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك ثاني أكبر المدن السورية بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب إحصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك أكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن أكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهرة، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 105 كم2؛ غالبية سكان دمشق التقليدية هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنة على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيرة العدد، من أصول أوروبية - بلقانية بشكل أساسي - وعربية، بدواع مختلفة، انسجم أغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينة؛ تحوي دمشق أيضًا أعدادًا كبيرة من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السورية، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمة، فإن دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامة في الدولة السورية، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمة الدستورية العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمة، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينة تجارية، تقصدها القوافل للراحة أو التبضع، كانت المدينة إحدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهة إلى فارس أو آسيا الصغرى أو مصر أو الجزيرة العربية. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في إغناء المدينة وتحويلها إلى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي أيضًا، فالمدينة كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول أهمها الدولة الأموية - أكبر دولة إسلامية من حيث المساحة في التاريخ، وفيها أقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزة في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الأيوبي والظاهر بيبرس. أما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجارة، والصناعة المنتشرة في الضواحي، والسياحة، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحدة من أفضل المقاصد السياحية في العالم، إلا أنّ الأزمة السورية المندلعة منذ 2011، أفضت إلى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينة، وبروز أزمات اجتماعية واقتصادية فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nأي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الأهلية، تم تصنيف دمشق على أنها المدينة الأقل ملاءمةً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحدة الاستخبارات الاقتصادية. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 أسوأ مدينة في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف أيضًا بأسماء عديدة منها الشام و مدينة الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانة إقليمية بارزة على صعيد الفنون، والآداب، والسياسة؛ وحظيت باهتمام الأدباء والشعراء والرحالة ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّة والأدبيّة، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:",

      "content": "## Overview\nDamascus (دمشق Dimaşk) is the capital and largest city of Syria. A city of immense historical importance, Damascus was the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. As a city of immense religious importance, Damascus is home to the Street Called Straight, where the Apostle Paul (Saul) converted to Christianity; the Minaret of ʿĪsā, where Muslims believe ʿĪsā (Jesus) will return to the Earth to herald in the End of Days; and the Umayyad Mosque, where the relics of John the Baptist (Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyā) are kept. Damascus is the City of Jasmine and is a major cultural center in both the Islamic and Arabic worlds, and in safer times has been a major tourist destination.\n\n## Understand\nEstablished between 10,000 to 8,000 BCE, Damascus is credited with being one of, if not the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. The world heritage listed old-walled city, in particular, feels very ancient and largely consists of a maze of narrow alleys, punctuated by enigmatic doors that lead into pleasing, verdant courtyards and blank-faced houses. The old city still has an authentic medieval feel to it, although this was quickly vanishing due to the increasing tourist traffic as the city continued to be highlighted as an attraction. Life, however, goes on in the old-walled city, which is still the religious and social center of the city.\nDue to the Syrian Civil War which began in 2011, many services in the city, including transportation, accommodation and consular services, have been severely disrupted. Power interruptions are frequent, the Syrian pound currency has been subject to hyperinflation (to the point where prices listed here are meaningless) and the war is not far from mind even during the brief moments when life goes on normally. Many have left the country, been drafted into military service or killed in action. On December 8, 2024, rebel groups entered Damascus and captured it, ending the Assad regime. The city is home to about 2.5 million people (2022), and the metropolitan area to 5 million.\nLarge parts of the article describes the situation before the war. While the security situation is generally improving in Syria and especially in Damascus, travel to most of Syria is still considered very unsafe by most governments.\n\n## By plane\nAs of mid 2025, flights to Damascus are limited, but beginning to increase. Several major carriers are resuming flights with scheduled services now available from regional hubs such as Istanbul and Doha. National carrier SyrianAir operates a small regional network with flights from Abu Dhabi, Amman, Baghdad, Dubai, Doha and Kuwait City several times per week.\nOnly taxi companies are allowed to pickup customers from the airport. Taxi fares may vary depending on your bargaining skills. There are also buses departing to and from Baramkeh bus station in the center of town (airport buses are the only ones which serve this bus station now - all other services have moved to the new out of town Soumaria bus station). There are departures every half an hour, 24 hours a day. At the airport, come out of the terminal and turn right - you will find the bus at the end of the building. There is a small ticket office. The bus will drop you a bit far from the Old City, but there many taxis around to get you there. Make sure to ask for the meter.\n33.411136.51251 Damascus International Airport (مَطَار دِمَشْق الدَّوْلِيّ). DAM  IATA. The airport is relatively well-equipped with most standard services. Getting Syrian pounds at Damascus International Airport might be tricky, as the change counters only accept US dollars. There are two ATMs in the main lobby that accept credit cards and foreign debit cards, but they tend to be unreliable. Your best bet is to bring a small amount of US dollars with you into Syria, and change it at the airport until you can withdraw from Damascus ATMs.      (updated Jan 2024)\n\n## By train\nAs of early 2025, all long-distance train services to Damascus are still suspended, including the once-weekly sleeper trains from Istanbul and Tehran. The historic Hejaz station in the city centre remains closed and future services will depart and arrive at from Al-Qadam railway station south of the city centre.\n33.476536.29052 Al-Qadam railway station.    (updated Jun 2021)\n\n## By car\nIt isn't a very good idea to rent a car in Damascus. There is almost always a traffic jam, especially in summer, and parking tends to be difficult too; although that isn't the situation in suburbs.\n\n## By bus\nMicro buses, also known as servees, are one of the main sources of transportation in Damascus. You can go from one place to another in Damascus with one or at most two journeys. When on the bus, give any passenger a coin and they will pass it to the driver and return the change. Remember to tell that passenger how many people you are paying for, whether you are in a group, or that you are paying \"for one\" (\"waahid\") if you are alone. The route is written (in Arabic only) on the roof sign. Micro buses do not generally have fixed stops except at very busy points, just beckon to the driver and they will stop near you (Al yameen, andak iza samaht).\nThere are also many city buses. One useful bus is #15, which runs from Al-Marjeh Square (Souq Sarouja\\Old Town) to the Western Bus Station, which serves Beirut and Amman.\n\n## Get around\nAt rush hours (10:00-16:00), the best way of transport is on foot. Smoking is absolutely forbidden on all public transport.\n\n## By foot\nA very good idea is to go on foot especially for a sightseeing, and it's the only way to get around in Old Damascus. Walking in the new city however, should be reserved to the nicer areas of Maliki and Abu-Rumaneh, as the new city tends to be pollution clogged. The driving culture in Damascus is not the safest, so beware as a pedestrian, especially in the new city. Cars will not hesitate to come extremely close to pedestrians or other cars in order to pass.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis are plentiful in Damascus, making them a great mode of transportation. The taxis of Star Taxi, a private company, are more expensive than normal taxis, but they are also more comfortable and safer. You can call their headquarters and they will send the nearest taxi to your door. Taxis with the Damascus Governorate logo on the side and a number on the roof sign are normally equipped with a meter, and it is best to use only these when hailing a taxi on the street. You should normally leave a tip as well as the fare on the meter. At night, taxi drivers do not usually use the meter, so you may be best off negotiating the price before you get in. A service taxi to Amman or Beirut takes around 4 hours and run 24 hours. Do not hesitate to take them; they are clean vehicles with air conditioning.\n\n## See\nThe Souq al-Hamidiyya, a broad street packed with tiny shops, is entered through columns from a Roman temple built on a site that had been occupied by an even older temple. The souqs themselves smell of cumin and other distinctive spices and you can find passages dedicated to everything from leather and copper goods to inlaid boxes and silk scarves.\nAt the end of Souq al-Hamidiyya stands the great Umayyad Mosque; this building with three minarets is an architectural wonder. It was an Assyrian temple, then a Roman temple to Jupiter, a church when Rome converted to Christianity, then a mosque and a church together, and finally a mosque until now. All the symbols are still pretty much there and some Christian drawings can still be very clearly seen on the walls inside. The mosque contains the grave of John the Baptist (prophet Yahya to Muslims) inside the main lounge. Muslims also believe that this is the site where Jesus will descent back to Earth on his Second Coming. Women are asked to be to cover their hair, arms and legs. Abayas (full-body covers) are provided with the entrance ticket. It is one of the most sacred sites of Islam, and it welcomes foreign tourists, who are allowed to walk around the prayer area.\nAt the other end of Souq al-Hamidiyya is a fort-like section of the extant city wall that is the Citadel (but make sure to visit Aleppo's Citadel for a truly amazing experience).\nNearby, you can visit the Mausoleum of Salah al-Din, known in the west as Saladin, the chief anti-crusader. There's a great statue of him on horseback right next to the citadel, which will make you gasp. If you walk all the way around it, there are two dejected Frankish knights underneath the horse's slightly lifted tail. These two knights are identified by inscriptions as Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, and Reynald de Chatillon, lord of Kerak, an important fortress in the Holy Land. Both were captured during Salah al-Din's definitive victory at Hattin; Guy was imprisoned in Damascus and eventually released, but Reynald was executed as punishment for his many atrocities.\n\n## Old Damascus\n33.511636.30381 Temple of Jupiter.

The peak is accessible at any time, although the view is perhaps most spectacular at night when the whole city is lit up and the minarets of mosques are bathed in green light. The Umayyad Mosque in the old town is particularly impressive when viewed from the mountain. There is a wide range of food and refreshment available on the peak from stalls to fancy restaurants that serve good local cuisine and alcohol. Check the price before you get too comfortable though as it is a well-known scam for taxi drivers to take you to their 'favorite' cafe, where you'll end up paying a fortune for a cup of tea.\nVisit a restaurant in old Damascus. There are many restaurants in the old quarter each with their own unique character, but perhaps the most famous (and touristy) is \"Beit Jabri\", although \"Al-Khawali\" is considered by many to be the best dining experience in the old city. Another restaurant in the old city, Narcissus Palace, located close to Maktab Anbar, would offer an enlightening experience. Every night, a singer and band play old Arabic music and create an amazing atmosphere in the restaurant. A good idea, when considering these restaurants, is to go for breakfast, and then go sightseeing. The breakfast is very cheap.\nRelax at a Hooka cafe \"Narjelah\" Hooka cafes are popular in Damascus and are easy to find. When visiting the old city, you'll get a more cultural or traditional experience. You'll probably find a crowd of tea-drinking, backgammon-playing men all smoking hooka.  In the modern city, most cafes cater to a younger crowd and are a big part of the night life offering a huge variety of flavored tobacco ranging from double apple which is the most common, to cappuccino. In almost every major restaurant, hookas are available, including the restaurants in the old city.\n33.51222236.2786111 Damascus Opera House.   (updated Jul 2021)\n\n## Hammams\nBathing in a hammam, i.e., a Turkish bath, is a great way of both soaking up the atmosphere of Old Damascus and to be rejuvenated after a long day. Two baths that are familiar with Western tourists are Nur-al-Din Bath and Bakri Bath. A visit to either includes towels, soap, scrub, a massage and a tea. The price is typically composed of bath entry, scrub, sauna, massage, and extras such as tea or soap. Nur-al-Din is for men only, Bakri might be able to accommodate women or mixed groups upon prior arrangement. Bakri Bath: for women each day except Friday 10:00-17:00.\nNur-al-Din Bath (between the Azem Palace and Straight Street).

Prices are cheap, and since very few stores depend on tourists for their income, most will leave you alone to browse until you are ready to buy.  Small stores are found throughout the old city, although the Souq al-Hamidiyya, located along the Roman straight street, offers the highest density of shops.  The souq is a fantastic experience, but be prepared for the crowds.\n33.51094536.3016441 Al-Hamidiyah Souq (سُوق ٱلْحَمِيدِيَّة).   (updated Jan 2024)\n\n## Budget\nAl-Rabie Hotel, Sharia bahsa, Souq saroujah (on an attractive side street about a 5-10 minute walk from the citadel), ☏ +963 11 231-8374, alrabiehotel@hotmail.com. It has an attractive courtyard, and clean rooms.  Breakfast is included in the price.  Some of the rooms that share a bath are a bit of a hike from the bath and shower rooms. No alcohol allowed on the premises. The design of the hotel is beautiful but staff can be very rude and don't expect to be made to feel welcome.\nHotel Al-Ghazal, Sharia souq saroujah (in souq Saroujah, at the street turning out towards Jisr-Al-Thawra, the revolution bridge), ☏ +963 11 231-3736, info@ghazalhotel.com.

For breakfast, they serve the usual range of teas and coffees and good water pipe free of charge. You can bring alcohol to drink in the courtyard. Rooms and facilities are new. Several new, clean bathrooms with hot water and also a hostel portion in the same structure. There is safe for valuables. Owners are helpful and service-minded, but they speak less English than their competitors and don't arrange tours or otherwise on a regular basis (but could still probably help out if you ask). English spoken enough to arrange rooms, get/give directions and special circumstances. For foreign students of Arabic, the hotel staff are very accommodating and surprisingly insightful with the limited English they speak. If you are a light sleeper, you should avoid rooms close to the kitchen, bathrooms and reception area. The rooms facing onto the courtyard are peaceful. 9.

Offers all the services of a five-star hotel, double king-sized beds, modern equipment, terrace cafe, basement cinema cafe, reading lounges, restaurant, salon, VIP area, Wi-Fi.\n\n## Drink\nThe coffee houses of Old Damascus were something to experience. Hours could dissolve over a cup of shay (tea) or ahwa (coffee) among the smoke of a nargileh (water pipe) . An-Naufara (which means 'The Fountain') was a wonderful place to do this, just east of the Umayyad Mosque. There was even a Hakawati (a traditional story teller) present at 19:00 most nights.\nIf you were craving a European coffee, you could have headed for Abu Rommeneh street and looked for the Bennetton clothing store. There were a number of fancy cafés in the area, including the Middle Eastern chain Inhouse Coffee, which is similar to Starbucks in its prices and atmosphere. Free Wi-Fi was offered at each location throughout the city.\nApart from that, many bars and nightclubs had been set up in Damascus.  These were usually busy at night time, but they still provided nice alcoholic beverages and dances.\nClubs in Damascus that weren't all prostitutes (around Bab Sharqi): La Serai, La Vida Loca.\nMany establishments have closed because of the war; as of mid-2016 there have been reports of businesses gradually returning to the Old City or Old Quarter of Damascus.\nOld Town establishments which have reopened include:\nLa Marionnette Pub, الشهبندر مقابل وزارة التربية, ☏ +963 958 741 013.

Established in 1945, this café was for a long time the main meeting place of the cultural elite in Damascus.   (updated Jul 2021)\n\n## Sleep\nSouq-Al-Saroujah is where you find the cluster of backpacker hotels.  Martyr's Square or \"Merjeh\" in Arabic is the other place worth considering if you're on a tight budget, though many of the places double as brothels. However, at least the hotels below can be recommended.  Women alone should avoid hotels at Merjeh Square, because it's the red light district of Damascus.\nMost hotels in Damascus claiming to be 5 stars are actually closer to what Western travellers know as 2 stars. The Syrian government runs its own accreditation agency that gives highly suspect inflated ratings to hotels owned by Syrian chains and those that have paid \"baksheesh\" (bribes) to the authorities. Due to the American sanctions of Syria, credit cards linked to US banks will not be accepted (this is pretty much every credit card in the world).\n\n## Stay safe\nSee the Syria article for information on the security situation.\nIn rural and modern areas of Damascus, people have been known to be perfectly healthy, but to imitate beggars in order to get money. Often, they will attempt to con you by giving more money and have many tricks to do so. Exercise caution.\nAlso, for your safety, do not take advice or recommendations, especially about accommodation, doctors and dentists, from taxi drivers.\nDamascus itself has not been an active war zone for several years now. Nonetheless, the political by-products of the war continue to negatively impact travellers. In particular, checkpoints are everywhere in the city and its environs, staffed by underpaid and notoriously corrupt soldiers and policemen. Especially if you are not Arab, Russian, or Iranian, you can expect to be repeatedly shaken down for bribes (ranging from food and cigarettes to cash). Do not get in these people's bad books under any circumstances; Syria is not a country where the rule of law applies. Nonetheless, Damascus is physically safe for tourists who are respectful and willing to \"pay to play\". Travelling with a guide at all times is strongly recommended, if only to make such interactions less stressful.\n\n## Connect\nMost hotels can arrange international phone calls, but prices are very expensive.  Most internet cafes are set up for VOIP, and offer a much cheaper alternative, although the price does reflect the quality of the connection.\nInternet access is widely available, although the Syrian government censors traffic, which can cause some interesting quirks in connectivity.\n\n## Cope\nVery few large banks will cash American Express Traveller Cheques in Damascus and elsewhere in Syria. ATMs and credit cards are not a reliable option.\nATMs are not always in operation. Change houses exist in many areas in Damascus, especially near the large souks. The euro, British pound, and American dollar can be changed at these shops, usually commission-free. Be sure to look up the current exchange rate before changing money so you do not get cheated. Many shops, especially in the old city), also change money. Though it is illegal, it is a handy option when you're already shopping in the old city and need to change some cash quickly. Just ask around the shopkeepers for a money changer and you will soon be directed to a store that does currency exchange.\n\n## Embassies\nCanada, Lot 12 Mezze Autostrade.
