      "content": "Ebla (Sumerian: 𒌈𒆷 eb₂-la, Arabic: إبلا, modern: تل مرديخ, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium BC and in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nStarting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC. It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC.\nEbla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite, and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status, and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated from 1964 and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to 2500 BC–2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid-3rd millennium BC's Levant.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"Ebla\" may derive from a word meaning \"white rock\", possibly referring to the limestone outcrop on which the city was built.\n\nHistory\nChalcolithic\nArtifacts from the late Ubaid and late Chalcolithic periods were recovered from the central mound.\n\nEarly Bronze\nEbla was first settled around 3500 BC; its growth was supported by many satellite agricultural settlements. The city benefited from its role as an entrepôt of growing international trade, which probably began with an increased demand for wool in Sumer. Archaeologists designate this early habitation period \"Mardikh I\"; it ended around 3000 BC.\nMardikh I is followed by the first and second kingdoms era between about 3000 and 2000 BC, designated \"Mardikh II\". I. J. Gelb considered Ebla a part of the Kish civilization, which was a cultural entity of East Semitic-speaking populations that stretched from the center of Mesopotamia to the western Levant.\n\nFirst kingdom\nEbla was the most prominent kingdom among the Syrian states during the first kingdom period between about 3000 and 2300 BC, particularly during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, known as \"the age of the archives\" after the Ebla tablets.\nMardiikh IIA: The early period between 3000 and 2400 BC is designated \"Mardikh IIA\". General knowledge about the city's history prior to the written archives is obtained through excavations. The first stages of Mardikh IIA is identified with building \"CC\", and structures that form a part of building \"G2\", which was apparently a royal palace built c. 2700 BC. Toward the end of this period, a hundred years' war with Mari started. Mari gained the upper hand through the actions of its king Saʿumu, who conquered many of Ebla's cities. In the mid-25th century BC, king Kun-Damu defeated Mari, but the state's power declined following his reign.\n\nMardikh IIB1: The archive period, which is designated \"Mardikh IIB1\", lasted from c. 2400 BC until c. 2300 BC. The end of the period is known as the \"first destruction\", mainly referring to the destruction of the royal palace (called palace \"G\" and built over the earlier \"G2\"), and much of the acropolis. During the archive period, Ebla had political and military dominance over the other Syrian city-states of northern and eastern Syria, which are mentioned in the archives. Most of the tablets, which date from that period, are about economic matters but also include royal letters and diplomatic documents.\n\nThe written archives do not date from before Igrish-Halam's reign, which saw Ebla paying tribute to Mari, and an extensive invasion of Eblaite cities in the middle Euphrates region led by the Mariote king Iblul-Il. Ebla recovered under King Irkab-Damu in about 2340 BC; becoming prosperous and launching a successful counter-offensive against Mari. Irkab-Damu concluded a peace and trading treaty with Abarsal. This Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal is one of the earliest-recorded treaties in history.\n\nGeography\nAt its greatest extent, Ebla controlled an area roughly half the size of modern Syria, from Ursa'um in the north, to the area around Damascus in the south, and from Phoenicia and the coastal mountains in the west, to Haddu in the east. Large parts of the kingdom were under the direct control of the king and were administered by governors; the rest consisted of vassal kingdoms. One of the most important of these vassals was Armi, which is the city most often mentioned in the Ebla tablets. Ebla had more than sixty vassal kingdoms and city-states, including Hazuwan, Burman, Emar, Halabitu and Salbatu.\nAccording to Archi, these are \"the twelve Syrian cities long allied with Ebla that (presumably) assisted in some way during the expedition against Mari: NIrar, Ra’ak, Burman, Dub, Emar, Garmu, Lumnan, Ibubu, Ursaum, Utik, Kakmium, and Iritum (Irridu).\" Furthermore, the following cities were under Ebla's hegemony at that time, and annually delivered tribute: Dub, Dulu, Harran, Ibubu, Iritum, Kablul, Sanapzugum, Ursaum, and Utik.\nModern scholars have termed the king's chief official  \"the vizier\". The most powerful vizier was Ibrium, who campaigned against Abarsal during the term of his predecessor Arrukum. Ibrium held office for 18 years with warfare occurring in all but one year. During the reign of Isar-Damu, Ebla continued the war against Mari, which defeated Ebla's ally Nagar, blocking trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Ebla conducted regular military campaigns against rebellious vassals, including several attacks on Armi, and a campaign against the southern region of Ib'al – close to Qatna. In order to settle the war with Mari, Isar-Damu allied with Nagar and Kish. Some scholars have suggested that the Kish in question was not the Mesopotamian city but rather a town near Nagar in the Khabur area. The campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. The alliance also attacked Armi and occupied it, leaving Ibbi-Sipish's son Enzi-Malik as governor. Ebla suffered its first destruction a few years after the campaign, probably following Isar-Damu's death.\n\nFirst destruction of Ebla\nThe first destruction occurred c. 2300 BC; palace \"G\" was burned, baking the clay tablets of the royal archives and preserving them. Many theories about the cause and the perpetrator have been posited:\n\nHigh (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato supports an early dating for Ebla that would put the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash – who boasted of taking tribute from Mari – or Lugalzagesi of Umma, who claimed to have reached the Mediterranean.\nAkkadian hypothesis: Both kings Sargon of Akkad and his grandson Naram-Sin claimed to have destroyed a town called Ibla, The discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, considers Sargon a more likely culprit; his view is supported by Trevor Bryce, but rejected by Michael Astour. The conquest of Armanum and Ebla on the Mediterranean coast by Naram-Sin is mentioned in several of his inscriptions:\n\"Whereas, for all time since the creation of mankind, no king whosoever had destroyed Armanum and Ebla, the god Nergal, by means of (his) weapons opened the way for Naram-Sin, the mighty, and gave him Armanum and Ebla. Further, he gave to him the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain, and the Upper Sea. By means of the weapons of the god Dagan, who magnifies his kingship, Naram-Sin, the mighty, conquered Armanum and Ebla.\"\nMari's revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the destruction happened approximately three or four years after the battle at Terqa. Archi and Biga say the destruction was caused by Mari in retaliation for its humiliating defeat at Terqa. This view is supported by Mario Liverani. Archi says the Mariote king Isqi-Mari destroyed Ebla before ascending the throne of his city.\nNatural catastrophe: Astour says a natural catastrophe caused the blaze which ended the archive period. He says the destruction was limited to the area of the royal palace and there is no convincing evidence of looting. He dates the fire to c. 2290 BC (Middle Chronology).\n\nSecond kingdom\nThe second kingdom's period is designated \"Mardikh IIB2\", and spans the period between 2300 and 2000 BC. The second kingdom lasted until Ebla's second destruction, which occurred anytime between 2050 and 1950 BC, with the 2000 BC dating being a mere formal date. The Akkadians under Sargon of Akkad and his descendant Naram-Sin invaded the northern borders of Ebla aiming for the forests of the Amanus Mountain; the intrusions were separated by roughly 90 years and the areas attacked were not attached to Akkad. Archi accept that the Ibla mentioned in the annals of Sargon and Naram-Sin is the Syrian Ebla but do not consider them responsible for the destruction which ended the Archive period. By the time of Naram-Sin, Armi was the hegemonic city in northern Syria and was destroyed by the Akkadian king.\n\nA new local dynasty ruled the second kingdom of Ebla, but there was continuity with its first kingdom heritage. Ebla maintained its earliest features, including its architectural style and the sanctity of the first kingdom's religious sites. A new royal palace was built in the lower town, and the transition from the archive period is marked only by the destruction of palace \"G\". Little is known about the second kingdom because no written material have been discovered aside from one inscription dating to the end of the period.\nThe second kingdom was attested in contemporaneous sources; in an inscription, Gudea of Lagash asked for cedars to be brought from Urshu in the mountains of Ebla, indicating Ebla's territory included Urshu north of Carchemish in modern-day Turkey. Texts that dates to the seventh year of Amar-Sin (c. 2040 BC), a ruler of the Ur III empire, mention a messenger of the Ensí (\"Megum\") of Ebla. The second kingdom was considered a vassal by the Ur III government, but the nature of the relation is unknown and it included the payment of tribute. A formal recognition of Ur's overlordship appears to be a condition for the right of trade with that empire.\nThe second kingdom disintegrated toward the end of the 21st century BC, and ended with the destruction of the city by fire, although evidence for the event has only been found outside of the so-called \"Temple of the Rock\", and in the area around palace \"E\" on the acropolis. Conflict may have preceded the fire; according to Astour, it could have been the result of a Hurrian invasion c. 2030 BC, led by the former Eblaite vassal city of Ikinkalis. The destruction of Ebla is mentioned in the fragmentary Hurro-Hittite legendary epic \"Song of Release\" discovered in 1983, which Astour considers as describing the destruction of the second kingdom. In the epic, an Eblaite assembly led by a man called \"Zazalla\" prevents king Meki from showing mercy to prisoners from Ebla's former vassal Ikinkalis, provoking the wrath of the Hurrian storm god Teshub and causing him to destroy the city.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nThird kingdom\nThe third kingdom is designated \"Mardikh III\"; it is divided into periods \"A\" (c. 2000–1800 BC) and \"B\" (c. 1800–1600 BC). In period \"A\", Ebla was quickly rebuilt as a planned city. The foundations covered the remains of Mardikh II; new palaces and temples were built, and new fortifications were built in two circles – one for the low city and one for the acropolis. The city was laid out on regular lines and large public buildings were built. Further construction took place in period \"B\".\n\nThe first known king of the third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who described himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite in the view of Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.\nBy the beginning of the 18th century BC, Ebla had become a vassal of Yamhad, an Amorite kingdom centered in Aleppo. Written records are not available for this period, but the city was still a vassal during Yarim-Lim III of Yamhad's reign. One of the known rulers of Ebla during this period was Immeya, who received gifts from the Egyptian Pharaoh Hotepibre, indicating the continuing wide connections and importance of Ebla. The city was mentioned in tablets from the Yamhadite vassal city of Alalakh in modern-day Turkey; an Eblaite princess married a son of King Ammitaqum of Alalakh, who belonged to a branch of the royal Yamhadite dynasty.\nEbla was destroyed by the Hittite King Mursili I in about 1600 BC. Indilimma was probably the last king of Ebla; a seal of his crown prince Maratewari was discovered in the western palace \"Q\". Alternatively, Maratewari  could well be the last king according to Archi, who also argued that the \"Song of Release\" epic describes the destruction of the third kingdom and preserves older elements.\n\nLater periods\nEbla never recovered from its third destruction. It was a small village in the phase designated \"Mardikh IV\" (1600–1200 BC), and was mentioned in the records of Alalakh as a vassal to the Idrimi dynasty. \"Mardikh V\" (1200–535 BC) was a rural, Early Iron Age settlement that grew in size during later periods. Further development occurred during \"Mardikh VI\", which lasted until c. 60 AD. \"Mardikh VII\" began in the 3rd century AD and lasted until the 7th century, after which the site was abandoned.\n\nSite\nLayout\nEbla consisted of a lower town and a raised acropolis in the center. During the first kingdom, the city had an area of 56 hectares and was protected by mud-brick fortifications. Ebla was divided into four districts – each with its own gate in the outer wall. The acropolis included the king's palace \"G\", and one of two temples in city dedicated to Kura (called the \"Red Temple\"). The lower city included the second temple of Kura in the southeast called \"Temple of the Rock\". During the second kingdom, a royal palace (Archaic palace \"P5\") was built in the lower town northwest of the acropolis, in addition to temple \"D\" built over the destroyed \"Red Temple\".\n\nDuring the third kingdom, Ebla was a large city nearly 60 hectares in size, and was protected by a fortified rampart, with double chambered gates. The acropolis was fortified and separated from the lower town. New royal palace \"E\" was built on the acropolis (during Mardikh IIIB), and a temple of Ishtar was constructed over the former \"Red\" and \"D\" temples (in area \"D\"). The lower town was also divided into four districts; palace \"P5\" was used during Mardikh IIIA, and replaced during Mardikh IIIB by the \"Intermediate Palace\".\nOther third kingdom buildings included the vizier palace, the western palace (in area \"Q\"), the temple of Shamash (temple \"N\"), the temple of Rasap (temple \"B1\") and the northern palace (built over the \"Intermediate Palace\"). In the north of the lower town, a second temple for Ishtar was built, while the former \"Temple of the Rock\" was replaced by a temple of Hadad.\n\nRoyal burials\nThe kings of the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal mausoleum located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum \"G4\"). This first kingdom tomb was probably built during the reign of the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.\nThe third kingdom royal necropolis was discovered beneath palace \"Q\" (the western palace); it contains many hypogea but only three were excavated. Those tombs were natural caves in the bedrock of the palace's foundation; they all date to the 19th and 18th centuries BC and had a similar plan consisting of an entrance shaft, burial chambers and a dromos, or entryway, connecting the shaft to the chamber.\n\nHypogeum G4\nThe tomb found in the royal palace \"G\" is designated hypogeum \"G4\"; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.\nExcavated between 1992 and 1995, it is located underneath the western sector of the palace at a depth of almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west–east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west–east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.\n\nWestern palace tombs\nThe tombs were found under the floor of Building Q, which was built in the Isin-Larsa period.\n\nThe tomb of the princess: dating to c. 1800 BC, it is the oldest and smallest of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained the remains of a young woman.. The dromos is an enlargement of a natural cave with steps partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved with stones. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.\nThe tomb of the cisterns: this tomb is the most damaged in the necropolis. It consists of a double room burial; the earliest, (Q79A), was built at the same period of the tomb of the princess, and was badly damaged when the tomb was reused, and a dromos was built in the place of Q79A toward the end of the 17th century BC (leading to the founding of burial Q79B). This was probably the resting place of a king; a club (a symbol of royal power) was discovered in Q79A.\nThe tomb of the lord of the goats: the largest in the necropolis, it includes two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The recovered body is not identified; archaeologists call it \"the Lord of the Goats\" after one of the grave goods, a throne decorated with bronze goat heads. It could be king Immeya; a silver cup inscribed with his name was among the grave goods.\n\nGovernment\nThe first kingdom's government consisted of the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was also a monarchy, but little is known about it because of a lack of written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.\n\nAdministration of the first kingdom\nThe queen shared the running of affairs of state with the king. The crown prince was involved in internal matters and the second prince was involved in foreign affairs. Most duties, including military ones, were handled by the vizier and the administration, which consisted of 13 court dignitaries – each of whom controlled between 400 and 800 men forming a bureaucracy with 11,700 people. Each of the four quarters of the lower city was governed by a chief inspector and many deputies. To oversee royal interest, the king employed agents (mashkim), collectors (ur) and messengers (kas).\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMany client kingdoms owed allegiance to Ebla and each was ruled by its own king (En); those vassal kings were highly autonomous, paying tribute and supplying military assistance to Ebla. The administrative center in the capital was named the \"SA.ZA\"; it included the royal palaces, storerooms and some temples. Regions beyond the walls of the capital were collectively named in Eblaite texts \"uru-bar\" (literally meaning outside of the city). The villages and towns under the central authority were either ruled directly from the capital, or had appointed officials. The titles of the civil servants do not clearly define the bearer's responsibilities and authority as each town had its own political traditions.\n\nLugal: while in Mesopotamia a lugal designated a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was directly under the authority of the capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was under the authority of the grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities directly under the authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.\nUgula: the title is translated as superintendent; some ugulas were independent rulers and some represented the highest authority of a tribal group. Many cities had an appointed ugula as their head of administration such as the city of Darum.\n\nChora\nThe regions under the direct control of the king that were economically vital for the capital are called the \"chora\" by archaeologists. Regions under direct control of the king extended beyond the chora and it is difficult to determine the exact size of the kingdom and the chora due to the constant military expansion of Ebla which added new territories; some of those were ruled directly while others were allowed to retain their own rulers as vassals.\nGenerally, the chora is the core region of Ebla that includes the economic hinterland supporting the capital. It includes the cities and villages where the king or his vizier had palaces, towns that included important sanctuaries of gods related to the royal institution, towns visited by the monarch during the different rituals he participated in (such as the renewal of royalty ritual), and other cities such as the ones where textiles were delivered. The chora spans around 3000 km2; from west to east it includes the plains east of Jabal Zawiya, the Maṭkh swamp, al-Hass mountain and mount Shabīth. Areas directly on the borders of the chora such as al-Ghab, al-Rouge plain and al-Jabbul have close cultural affinity with the chora.\n\nPeople, language, and culture\nThe first and second kingdoms\nMardikh II's periods shared the same culture. the population of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 (2400–2300 BC) is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semite-speakers close to their Northwestern Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, one of the oldest attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others said it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East Semitic language which exhibits both West and East Semitic features.\nEbla held several religious and social festivals, including rituals for the succession of a new king, which normally lasted for several weeks. The Eblaite calendars were based on a solar year divided into twelve months. Two calendars were discovered; the \"old calendar\" used during the reign of Igrish-Halam, and a \"new calendar\" introduced by vizier Ibbi-Sipish. Many months were named in honor of deities; in the new calendar, \"Itu be-li\" was the first month of the year, and meant \"the month of the lord\". Each year was given a name instead of a number.\nWomen received salaries equal to those of men and could accede to important positions and head government agencies. The Eblaites imported Kungas from Nagar, and used them to draw the carriages of royalty and high officials, as well as diplomatic gifts for allied cities. Society was less centered around the palace and the temple than in Mesopotamian kingdoms. The Eblaite palace was designed around the courtyard, which was open toward the city, thus making the administration approachable. This contrasts with Mesopotamian palaces, which resembled citadels with narrow entrances and limited access to the external courtyard. Music played an important part in the society and musicians were both locals, or hired from other cities such as Mari. Ebla also hired acrobats from Nagar, but later reduced their number and kept some to train local Eblaite acrobats.\n\nThe third kingdom\nThe Mardikh III population was predominately Semitic Amorite. The Amorites were mentioned in the first kingdom's tablets as neighbors and as rural subjects, and they came to dominate Ebla after the destruction of the second kingdom. The city witnessed a great increase in construction, and many palaces, temples and fortifications were built. The Amorite-speaking Eblaites worshiped many of the same deities as the Paleo-Syrian-speaking Eblaites of earlier periods, and maintained the sanctity of the acropolis in the center of the city. The third kingdom's iconography and royal ideology were under the influence of Yamhad's culture; kingship was received from the Yamhadite deities instead of Ishtar of Ebla, which is evident by the Eblaite seals of Indilimma's period.\n\nGenetics\nAncient DNA analysis on 10 human remains dating to the Early and Middle Bronze Age from Ebla found that Eblaites were a mixture of Copper age Levantines and Mesopotamians, and were genetically similar to contemporaneous Levantines.\nOne Early Bronze Age (2700-2500 BC) individual carried haplogroup E1b1b1b2a-M123, a lineage likely linked to the diffusion of Afroasiatic languages. Another Early Bronze Age (2572-2470 cal BCE) individual belonged to J1a2a1a2-P58, while four Middle Bronze Age (2000-1800 BC) individuals carried haplogroups J1a2a1a2-P58 (x2), G2a and the West Asian  T1a1-L162 which was present since the middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) Levant.\n\nEconomy\nDuring the first kingdom period, the palace controlled the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; the palace distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It is estimated that around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed in the hands of villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.\nEbla derived its prosperity from trade; its wealth was equal to that of the most important Sumerian cities, and its main commercial rival was Mari. Ebla's main articles of trade were probably timber from the nearby mountains, and textiles. Handicrafts also appear to have been a major export, evidenced by the quantity of artifacts recovered from the palaces of the city. Ebla possessed a wide commercial network reaching as far as modern-day Afghanistan. It shipped textiles to Cyprus, possibly through the port of Ugarit, but most of its trade seems to have been directed by river-boat towards Mesopotamia – chiefly Kish. The main palace G was found to contain artifacts dating from Ancient Egypt bearing the names of the pharaohs Khafre and Pepi I.\nEbla continued to be a center of trade during the second kingdom, evidenced by the surrounding cities that appeared during its period and were destroyed along with the city. Trade continued to be Ebla's main economic activity during the third kingdom; archaeological finds show there was an extensive exchange with Egypt and coastal Syrian cities such as Byblos.\n\nReligion\nEbla was a polytheistic state. During the first kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon of the first Ebla included pairs of deities which are classified into three types: couples (the most common type) such as a male deity and his female consort; divine twosomes such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons;and \"divine pairs\" who were actually a single deity with two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first pair-type, couples, included Hadabal (dNI-da-KUL), who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu (\"his wife\"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. Among the divine pairs were artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.\nThe first Eblaites worshiped many other deities, such as the Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family. Ishtar was also worshiped but was mentioned only five times in one of the monthly offering lists, while Ishara was far more important, appearing 40 times. Other deities included Damu; the Mesopotamian god Utu; Ashtapi; Dagan; Hadad (Hadda) and his consort Halabatu (\"she of Halab\"); and Shipish, the goddess of the sun who had a temple dedicated to her cult. The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.\nDuring the third kingdom, Amorites worshiped common northern Semitic gods; the unique Eblaite deities disappeared. Hadad was the most important god, while Ishtar took Ishara's place and became the city's most important deity apart from Hadad.\n\nBiblical connection theories\nAt the beginning of the process of deciphering the tablets, Giovanni Pettinato made claims about possible connections between Ebla and the Bible, citing alleged references in the tablets to the existence of Yahweh, the Patriarchs, Sodom and Gomorrah and other Biblical references. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely discredited and the academic consensus is that Ebla \"has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the Biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrah\". In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible; Ebla is now studied as a civilization in its own right. The claims led to a bitter personal and academic conflict between the scholars involved, as well as what some described as political interference by the Syrian authorities.\n\nExcavations\nIn 1964, Italian archaeologists from the University of Rome La Sapienza under the direction of Paolo Matthiae began excavating at Tell Mardikh. In 1968, they recovered a statue dedicated to the goddess Ishtar bearing the name of Ibbit-Lim, mentioning him as king of Ebla. That identified the city, long known from Lagashite and Akkadian inscriptions. In the next decade, the team discovered a palace (palace G) dating from c. 2500–2000 BC. Finds in the palaces include a small sculpture made out of precious materials, Lapis lazuli, black stones and gold.\nThirteen full and fragmentary lenticular cuneiform tablets were found in the palace throne room, thought to have been there versus the archive because of the city's fall. In a storeroom off the throne room, the nearly complete standard of the queen and fragments believed to come from the standard of the king were found. Other artifacts included wood furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl and composite statues created from colored stones. A silver bowl bearing king Immeya's name was recovered from the \"Tomb of the Lord of the Goats\", together with Egyptian jewels and an Egyptian ceremonial mace presented by pharaoh Hotepibre.\nAbout 17,000 cuneiform tablet fragments were discovered; when put together, they constitute 2,500 complete tablets, making the archive of Ebla one of the biggest from the 3rd millennium BC. About 80% of the tablets are written using the usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs, while the others exhibited an innovative, purely phonetic representation using Sumerian cuneiform of a previously unknown Semitic language, which was called \"Eblaite\". Bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the tablets, allowing them to be translated. The tablets provide many important insights into the cultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. They also provide insight into the everyday lives of the inhabitants, and contain information about state revenues, Sumerian-Eblaite dictionaries, diplomatic exchanges with foreign rulers, school texts, hymns and myths.\n\nLibrary\nThe over 4000-year-old tablets constitute the oldest library ever found. At Ebla, \"the archives or library constituted an orderly collection of records at least 500 years older than any other that had been found anywhere before.\" There is evidence of their arrangement and classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of the fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves. They found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.\nThese features were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, which may be far older than was assumed to be the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served – at least partially – as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.\nWhile the absolute chronology of the archive is not yet certain a relative chronology for the 50-year period has been established. Because Ebla did not use Mesopotamian style year names or year numbers and the name of rulers was rarely mentioned in the texts scholars used script changes, grammar changes, and most importantly a prosopography of the members of the court, especially the wives and daughters of the king. The most relevant tablets for this effort were a series of yearly metal accounts and monthly linen accounts.\nMost of the recovered tablets and tablet fragments were stored at the Idlib Regional Museum in Syria. Their current condition is unknown.\n\nLegacy\nEbla's first kingdom is an example of early Syrian centralized states, and is considered one of the earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, who consider it the first-recorded world power. Ebla's discovery changed the former view of Syria's history as a bridge between Mesopotamia and Egypt; it proved the region was a center of civilization in its own right.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nAs a result of the Syrian Civil War, excavations of Ebla stopped in March 2011. By 2013, it was under control of an opposition armed group called Arrows of the Right, who took advantage of its elevated location to use it as an observation point to watch for incoming government air attacks, as well as attempting to protect the site from looting. Many tunnels were dug and a crypt full of human remains was discovered; the remains were scattered and discarded by the robbers, who hoped to find jewelry and other precious artifacts. Besides excavations by rebels, nearby villagers also began digging at the site with the aim of finding and looting artifacts; some villagers removed carloads of soil suitable for making ceramic liners for bread-baking ovens from the tunnels.\nThe site was captured by the Syrian Armed Forces on 30 January 2020 during the 5th Northwestern Syria offensive, along with surrounding villages.\n\nSee also\nAzi (scribe)\nBiblical archaeology\nDugurasu\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nList of kings of Ebla\nMari, Syria\nShort chronology timeline\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBonechi, Marco. \"More on the Ebla gatekeepers\", Revue d’Assyriologie et d’archéologie Orientale, vol. 106, pp. 33–36, 2012\nCatagnoti, Amalia. \"In the aftermath of the war.

      "summary": "Ebla (Sumerian: 𒌈𒆷 eb₂-la, Arabic: إبلا, modern: تل مرديخ, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium BC and in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nStarting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC. It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC.\nEbla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite, and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status, and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated from 1964 and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to 2500 BC–2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid-3rd millennium BC's Levant.",

      "content": "Ebla (arabe : إبلا ʾĪblā) (ou Tall Mardikh, arabe : تل مرديخ Tall Mardīḵ) est une ancienne ville de la Syrie des IIIe et IIe millénaires av. J.-C., dont les ruines se trouvent à l'emplacement du site archéologique de Tell Mardikh. Il se situe à 60 km au sud d'Alep sur la route de Hama, après la bifurcation en direction de Lattaquié. Il occupe une position stratégique, à la porte d'un col contrôlant l'accès à la mer Méditerranée.\nLe site se présente sous la forme d'un tell ovale de 60 hectares dominé par une acropole centrale. Il a été découvert en 1964 et fouillé par les équipes du professeur Paolo Matthiae (de l'université La Sapienza de Rome) en 1968.\nEbla est une riche cité dès le IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. Ses rois commencent à partir de 2 500 av. J.-C. à étendre leur domination sur le Moyen Euphrate et sur une partie de la Syrie. Les fouilles ont permis de mettre au jour une salle d'archives, riche de plus de 17 000 tablettes et fragments de tablettes d'argile gravées en sumérien et en éblaïte, la langue locale. Ces textes ont fourni des informations précieuses sur l'économie, le commerce, l'industrie, l'administration et la diplomatie de ce puissant royaume. Des archives économiques, des traités d'alliance avec les États voisins, des relations de guerre et de paix, des épopées et des hymnes religieux montrent qu'Ebla fut l'une des plus puissantes cités-États de la Syrie entre 2500 et 2400 av. J.-C.\nIl est possible de visiter les vestiges dégagés de palais, de temples et d'autres édifices. Alors que la documentation écrite concerne les XXVe et XXIVe siècles av. J.-C., les monuments, les objets et œuvres d'art dégagés datent essentiellement du début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C., la dernière période pendant laquelle Ebla florissait avant sa destruction finale.\n\nRedécouverte, fouilles et dégradations\nLe site de Tell Mardikh commence à être fouillé par une équipe archéologique italienne dirigée par Paolo Matthiae en 1964, dans le but de trouver des informations sur la Syrie intérieure du IIe millénaire. Après de premières campagnes qui n'ont fourni que des résultats modestes, une statue portant une inscription a été découverte en 1968 et a permis l'identification du site fouillé : il s'agit de l'antique ville d'Ebla, capitale d'un royaume déjà connu par plusieurs textes et dont on cherchait la localisation. \nLes fouilles du site connaissent surtout une grande notoriété en 1975, quand sont mis au jour plus de 14 000 tablettes et fragments de tablettes datant d'environ 2400 av. J.-C., période pour laquelle on n'imaginait pas qu'il existait en Syrie une administration utilisant l'écriture cunéiforme. La région était tenue pour être « en retard » par rapport à la Basse Mésopotamie. Une polémique éclata même, lorsque des journaux anglo-saxons prétendirent que ces archives révélaient des informations sur le temps des Patriarches de la Bible, et que le gouvernement syrien cherchait à occulter. La polémique retomba finalement une fois les tablettes publiées, et lorsqu'il fut prouvé qu'elles n'avaient que des rapports très lointains avec la Bible. \nLes fouilles mirent au jour peu d'espaces datant du IIIe millénaire et dégagèrent essentiellement des bâtiments du début du IIe millénaire. Elles se sont poursuivies chaque année sous la direction de Paolo Matthiae jusqu'à leur interruption par la guerre civile en 2011. Elles apportent des informations précieuses sur la culture de la Syrie intérieure du IIe millénaire. Il en est de même pour l'édition et surtout l'analyse des tablettes du IIIe millénaire, effectuées notamment par Alfonso Archi, Pelio Fronzaroli et Giovanni Pettinato.\n\nGuerre civile syrienne\nDepuis le début de la guerre civile syrienne en 2011, les fouilles du site ont été abandonnées. Le site a été investi par des groupes armés, et il a rapidement fait l'objet de fouilles clandestines, dans des nécropoles encore non explorées par les fouilles régulières. Des analyses d'images satellites du site datant de 2014 indiquent que les zones fouillées ont été profondément dégradées, si ce n'est détruites, avec des engins mécanisés, et que les fouilles clandestines se sont étendues sur une surface très large, où sont repérables de nombreuses fosses.\n\nLe royaume d'Ebla durant la période « proto-syrienne » (c. 2500-2300 av. J.-C.)\nLe premier niveau d'habitation du site (Mardikh I) correspond à la seconde moitié du IVe millénaire. Le second niveau (Mardikh II) couvre la majorité du IIIe millénaire. Il est divisé en plusieurs sous-périodes ; le niveau II A correspond au premier grand développement de la ville, entre 3000 et 2500 environ, qui marque le début de la période dite « proto-syrienne ». Le niveau II B couvre la seconde moitié du IIIe millénaire, soit l'Âge du bronze ancien, correspondant à la période des dynasties archaïques III, ainsi qu'aux périodes des empires d'Akkad et d'Ur III de Basse Mésopotamie. Cette seconde sous-période est avant tout connue grâce aux nombreuses tablettes documentant la vie du royaume vers les XXVe – XXIVe siècles (niveau Mardikh II B1), qui ont fait la renommée du site. Il s'agit de l'apogée d'Ebla en tant que puissance politique.\n\nLe palais royal et les archives\nLes archéologues ont fouillé peu de bâtiments datant de la période proto-syrienne. Le mieux connu est le « palais G », datant du XXIVe siècle, situé au centre de l'Acropole. Il s'agit du plus ancien palais connu en Syrie. Les structures identifiées sur ce tell pour la phase antérieure doivent correspondre à un premier état de cet édifice, contemporain de l'émergence de la royauté à Ebla : sur la pente sud, le bâtiment G2 avait sans doute une fonction de stockage ; au nord-est du secteur palatial, une construction comprenant une grande quantité de silex devait servir d'atelier de production et d'espace de stockage. Le palais de l'époque proto-syrienne devait s'étendre sur environ 10 000 m2 sur le secteur nord de la colline et disposer d'au moins un étage. Mais seuls quelques secteurs ont pu être dégagés, couvrant 2 500 m2. Quelques parties ont pu être identifiées. D'abord le « quartier administratif », au sud, au pied de l'acropole où se trouvait la chancellerie avec ses archives. S'y trouvait une petite cour intérieure, disposant d'un portique sur son côté sud. Une pièce disposée au sud de ce secteur était sans doute la salle du trône, autour de laquelle ont été récemment mis au jour de petites pièces, où ont été trouvés divers objets. On a également mis au jour une cuisine dans ce secteur. La « cour des audiences », située plus en hauteur, dominait la ville et était reliée au secteur précédent par une porte monumentale. Elle a pu servir de place publique assurant la communication entre l'espace public et le palais proprement dit. Ses façades étaient apparemment bordées de portiques à colonnes en bois, au moins sur deux côtés. Un podium placé sous le portique nord devait supporter le trône du roi lors des audiences. Sur le côté nord, la cour donnait accès à un bâtiment du palais. Sur le côté est, elle ouvrait sur l'accès principal au palais royal, par une porte monumentale ouvrant sur un escalier menant au sommet de l'acropole. Un complexe situé au sud a pu servir de résidence aux dignitaires du palais.\n\nC'est dans le quartier administratif qu'ont été exhumées la plupart des tablettes des archives royales de cette période. La grande majorité des documents a été trouvée dans la « salle des archives ». Elle contenait environ 14 700 tablettes et fragments de tablettes, dont au moins 1 700 tablettes complètes et 9 500 avec des lacunes. Il s'agit d'une salle rectangulaire. Les tablettes étaient disposées par groupe de quinze, sur trois rangées d'étagères de bois (80 cm de profondeur et 50 cm de hauteur environ) alignées le long des murs nord et est. La face principale des tablettes était tournée vers l'extérieur, les plus grandes étant posées sur le sol. Elles étaient classées de façon thématique, et sont restées disposées ainsi après l'incendie qui a ravagé le palais lors de sa destruction, malgré la disparition des étagères. \nSur le mur est se trouvaient les tablettes enregistrant les livraisons de tissus. Dans l'angle se trouvaient les tablettes relatives à des livraisons de métaux précieux et de cuivre. Le long du mur nord, l'étagère supérieure portait les listes lexicales sumériennes et des textes de chancellerie (décrets royaux, donations, traités). Les autres étagères portaient des comptes rendus relatifs à l'agriculture et à l'élevage, ainsi que des listes bilingues éblaïte/sumérien. \nLe vestibule de la salle des archives a livré d'autres tablettes. D'autres pièces du palais ont fourni des lots de tablettes conséquents : environ 900 dans le portique est de la cour des audiences (beaucoup de tablettes de livraisons alimentaires - farine et huile) et 500 dans un magasin de forme trapézoïdale du quartier administratif. En tout, plus de 17 000 tablettes et fragments ont été mis au jour, mettant en lumière les activités de l'administration du palais durant les trois derniers règnes précédant la destruction du site. \nLa majorité des tablettes étaient rédigées en sumérien, langue d'un peuple vivant en Basse Mésopotamie, qui était alors la plus prestigieuse culturellement dans le Moyen-Orient, mais également dans une langue sémitique locale inconnue auparavant, et qui a finalement été baptisée « éblaïte ».\n\nInstitutions et administration du royaume\nL'État éblaïte était dirigé par le résident principal du palais, le roi. Il portait le titre sumérien de EN, habituellement traduit par « seigneur » (porté également par le roi d'Uruk), qui correspond à l'éblaïte malkum/malikum. Trois règnes sont documentés par les archives du palais : ceux d'Igrish-Halam, d'Irkab-Damu et d'Isar-Damu, dont les durées de règnes sont encore mal connues. Une liste des rois précédents a pu être établie, notamment à partir de tablettes de listes de rois relatives au culte des ancêtres dynastiques. L'épouse principale du roi (la reine, maliktum) jouait un grand rôle, notamment religieux.\nUn rituel royal qui correspondait au moins en partie à des noces royales est bien connu. Son interprétation est débattue, car il semble comprendre également l'intronisation du roi. Or celle-ci n'est pas mentionnée dans les tablettes le décrivant qui nous sont disponibles, mais dont l'association à la première cérémonie est évidente dans des documents administratifs. On comprend mal l'association entre le mariage et l'intronisation, qui ne semble pas due à des circonstances particulières. Quoi qu'il en soit, ce rituel durait au moins sept jours, durant lesquels le couple royal et les principaux dignitaires du royaume se rendaient en différents lieux : le temple du dieu Kura, patron du royaume, puis le mausolée dynastique, avant de revenir au palais pour effectuer d'autres rituels, présentant souvent un caractère agraire, avant que les noces ne soient conclues par un grand banquet précédant la consommation du mariage.\n\n« Quand le dieu Soleil s’avance vers la porte de la chambre de Kura, la reine est assise à la gauche du roi. Le roi et la reine portent les vases d’huile quand les dieux et les souverains entrent dans leurs deux chambres. Le roi et la reine ne donnent pas les provisions quand les dieux et les souverains se tiennent dans leur chambre. Pendant qu'ils sont assis sur les trônes de leurs pères, le soir précédent les provisions ont été remises... tandis qu’ils restent dans le mausolée pour leurs rites de sept jours, quatre vêtements à la manière de Mari sont tissés pour Kura et Barama, pour le roi et pour la reine. (...) Personne ne mange les premiers-nés du troupeau du roi et de la reine. Puis la reine mange les premiers nés [du troupeau] du roi et alors leurs premiers-nés ils mangent aussi (...). Tandis que le roi fait dans le temple un sacriﬁce à la divinité de Shagish, une statue est érigée pour l’esprit protecteur du roi, une statue est érigée pour l’esprit protecteur de la reine, telle qu’elle a été composée et produite par les fabricants de statues. Le roi offre sur une coupe dans sa main un simulacre d’argent de la déesse Ishkhara en bois de buis avec la tête en argent et la ceinture en argent. Le roi sur une coupe dans sa main offre un simulacre de la Lionne en bois de buis avec la tête en argent et la ceinture en argent et la chaîne... et nous restons là pour deux cérémonies de sept jours et sept jours. Quand nous avons célébré pour ce jour leur cérémonie de sept jours, la tête de Kura est voilée et le roi et la reine sortent. Puis ils retournent au temple des dieux pour manger les cabris de l’offrande. »\n\n— Extrait du rituel royal d'Ebla.\nDans les documents disponibles, le rôle du souverain est essentiellement religieux ; il incarnait le royaume, notamment dans les relations internationales où sa famille est intégrée dans les alliances interdynastiques (voir plus bas). Sa légitimité s'appuyait notamment sur le culte des ancêtres dynastiques divinisés, auxquels on offrait régulièrement des sacrifices. La cité de Darib semble avoir joué un rôle important dans ce culte funéraire, et les rois y étaient peut-être enterrés.\nL'administration du royaume était dirigée par une dizaine de personnages appelés LUGAL, terme sumérien signifiant « grand homme ». Il désignait en Basse Mésopotamie des personnages de rang royal, mais dans le contexte éblaïte ce n'était pas le cas, et on le traduit par « seigneur » (qui devait être rendu en éblaïte par ba'lum). Ces dignitaires dirigeaient le personnel dépendant du palais. Ils apparaissent surtout dans les tablettes d'enregistrement des dons et contributions (mu-DU) qui sont dirigés vers les entrepôts royaux. Ils étaient une vingtaine au maximum, mais leur nombre a diminué et ils n'étaient plus que douze lors de la fin du royaume. À partir du règne d'Irkab-Damu, un de ces personnages, Arrukum, prend progressivement seul la direction de l'administration du royaume. Il devient alors une sorte de premier ministre, ou « vizir ». Le roi perd alors une grande partie de son rôle politique. Arrukum est ensuite remplacé par Ibrium peu avant la mort d'Irkab-Damu. Il reste à ce poste une quinzaine d'années, avant que son propre fils Ibbi-Zikir ne prenne sa place à sa mort, pour environ dix-sept ans. Ce vizir dirige lui-même les armées du royaume.\nD'autres personnages importants dans l'administration éblaïte étaient les « Anciens » (ÁB.BA), sans doute une quarantaine de notables locaux. Par ailleurs, le palais administrait le territoire grâce à une cohorte de scribes qui tenaient la comptabilité et entretenaient ses archives. Un réseau de fonctionnaires était chargé de superviser les activités économiques du palais (appelés UGULA dans les textes). Les communautés ne dépendant pas directement de cet organisme devaient s'acquitter de redevances en nature (grain et huile notamment).\nFinalement, même si la nature de la royauté éblaïte reste mal connue par bien de ses aspects, il est clair qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un système autocratique dans lequel le souverain exerçait un pouvoir incontesté. Il devait composer avec plusieurs membres de l'oligarchie du royaume, en premier lieu le groupe des LUGAL dont une lignée finit par prendre une partie des fonctions monarchiques. Ebla était donc dominée par une élite ayant la main sur les affaires politiques et économiques.\n\nEbla dans les relations internationales\nMalgré leur caractère essentiellement administratif, les archives du palais royal d'Ebla nous donnent des informations sur le contexte international de la période, grâce à la présence d'actes de chancellerie (des lettres diplomatiques et un traité de paix) et d'enregistrements des entrées et sorties de présents effectués dans le cadre des relations diplomatiques. Néanmoins, ces textes sont souvent peu explicites, et il est difficile de les situer dans l'ordre chronologique interne, en encore plus de trouver les correspondances avec les événements attestés par les sources provenant d'autres sites contemporains. De ce fait, de nombreuses incertitudes demeurent.\nLes relations internationales d'Ebla sont essentiellement marquées par sa rivalité avec le plus puissant royaume situé dans son voisinage, Mari, localisé à sa frontière orientale et dominant la région du moyen Euphrate. À la fin du XXVe et au début du  XXIVe siècle, Ebla est un État vassal de Mari, et verse un tribut à son roi et à ses principaux dignitaires, comme le montrent les archives datant du règne d'Irkab-Damu.\n\n« Ainsi (parle) Enna-Dagan, roi de Mari, au souverain d'Ebla : Anubu, le roi de Mari, a battu les villes d'Aburu et Ilgi dans le territoire de Belan ; dans la région montagneuse de Labanan il a laissé des montagnes de ruines. Sa'umu, le roi de Mari, a battu les villes de Tibalat et llwani : dans la région vallonnée d'Angai il a laissé des montagnes de ruines. Sa'umu, le roi de Mari, a battu le territoire des villes de Ra'aq, Nirum, Ashaldu et Baul près de Nakhal et a laissé des montagnes de ruines. Alors Istup-sar, roi de Mari, a battu les villes d'Emar et Lalanium et le territoire d'Ebla : à Emar et Lalanium il a laissé derrière lui des montagnes de ruines. Alors Iblul-il a battu les villes de Shadab et Addalini et Arisum dans le territoire de Birman, dans le pays de Sugurum et a laissé derrière lui des montagnes de ruines ; et ensuite les villes de Sharan et Dammium, Iblul-il, le roi de Mari, les a battues et a laissé des montagnes de ruines. Il est alors parti vers les villes de Nerat et Hazuwan, Iblul-il, le souverain de Mari, a reçu le tribut d'Ebla quand il était dans la ville de Mane et il a pillé Emar et a laissé des montagnes de ruines. Et ensuite les villes de Nakhal et Lubat et Shabab, du territoire de Gasur, il a battu et il a laissé sept montagnes de ruines, Iblul, le souverain de Mari. »\n\n— Lettre d'Enna-Dagan, le nouveau roi de Mari, au souverain d'Ebla, vers 2380.\nMais Mari connaît ensuite une période d'affaiblissement, et le tribut est diminué. La puissance d'Ebla semble augmenter sous l'impulsion du vizir Ibrium : elle soumet notamment le royaume d'Emar, situé sur l'Euphrate, juste en face du royaume de Tuttul, vassal de Mari. C'est de cette période que daterait le traité passé entre Ebla et le royaume d'Abarsal (quelque part dans la région entre les zones d'influence d'Ebla et de Mari), qui est le plus ancien accord diplomatique dont on ait conservé la version écrite. Peu de temps après, Mari et Ebla concluent finalement une paix qui semble entériner un statut d'égalité entre les deux.\nLe vizir Ibbi-zikir poursuit l'ascension politique d'Ebla, remportant plusieurs victoires contre des petits royaumes voisins qui affermissent son pouvoir. Cette situation aboutit à un conflit contre Mari, qui se termine par la victoire des Éblaïtes dirigés par leur vizir, à proximité de Tuttul. Pour assurer sa victoire face à un voisin qui reste puissant, Ebla cherche l'alliance de deux rivaux de Mari, les royaumes de Nagar (aujourd'hui Tell Brak, en Syrie du nord) et de Kish (au nord de la Basse Mésopotamie). Des mariages unissent des princesses éblaïtes à des princes des deux royaumes alliés. Finalement, une paix est conclue à nouveau avec Mari.\nEbla est alors à son apogée : son royaume s'étend sur une grande partie de la Syrie centrale et il dispose de nombreux vassaux. Le royaume dirigé par le vizir Ibbi-zikir semble faire jeu égal avec les autres grandes puissances régionales, Mari et Nagar (Tell Brak). À en juger par la présence d'objets égyptiens dans le palais royal, notamment un vase en albâtre portant le nom de Pépi Ier, il existe peut-être même des échanges diplomatiques entre Ebla et la vallée du Nil.\n\nActivités économiques\nUne économie palatiale\nL'économie du royaume éblaïte était dominée par le palais royal, qui employait une majeure partie des travailleurs. Ceux-ci étaient rémunérés par l'administration palatiale en rations d'entretien, constituées de grain, d'huile et de laine. Les terres du palais étaient attribuées à des membres de la famille royale, ou bien de l'aristocratie, à qui les exploitants reversaient une partie du produit des cultures de façon à entretenir leur train de vie. Ces personnes disposaient des plus grands domaines. À côté, une foule de dépendants du palais disposait du même type de terres mais en quantité moindre. C'était l'administration centrale qui décidait en dernier lieu de l'attribution des terres, contrôlant ainsi ce système. Les temples ne disposaient pas de domaines, à la différence de ce qui se passait en Mésopotamie méridionale à la même période. Le culte était pris en charge par le palais.\nLa maison du roi, qui constituait le cœur de l'organisme palatial (SA.ZA dans les textes), entretenait des centaines de serviteurs (GURUŠ). Mais ils ne constituaient qu'une minorité des dépendants du palais. Ceux-ci étaient regroupés par unités familiales. Ils étaient répartis en groupes de 500 à 1 000 personnes ('iranum), dirigés par des surveillants (UGULA) et subdivisés en groupes de 20 travailleurs (É.DURU). Les artisans et marchands travaillant pour le palais résidaient plutôt dans la ville même, dans les faubourgs (URU.BAR) où se trouvaient également leurs espaces de travail. En tout, le personnel travaillant pour le palais au sens large comprenait environ 5 000 personnes. Si on estime qu'ils étaient généralement des chefs de familles composées en moyenne de 4 personnes, la population du royaume éblaïte était constituée d'au moins environ 20 000 personnes, si on s'en tient aux dépendants du palais.\nÀ côté du palais, de ses administrateurs et de sa foule de dépendants, il existait des communautés rurales qui restaient plus ou moins indépendantes. Elles devaient cependant acquitter des impôts en nature au pouvoir central. Il existait peut-être un commerce privé, en dehors des circuits commerciaux contrôlés par le palais. Les activités qui se déroulaient en dehors de la sphère palatiale sont cependant très mal connues, car peu documentées.\n\nAgriculture et élevage\nEbla était située au centre d'une plaine qui est toujours aujourd'hui très fertile, sous un climat méditerranéen, dans une zone qui dispose encore de plus de 200 millimètres de précipitations annuelles moyennes, et les bonnes années plus de 400 voire 500 millimètres. Cela permettait de pratiquer une agriculture sèche (non irriguée), mais de nature plutôt extensive, et non intensive comme l'était l'agriculture irriguée de Basse Mésopotamie, ce qui explique sans doute les différences dans les structures agraires entre les deux régions.\nUne trentaine de tablettes listant des champs ont pu être analysées. Certaines sont de type « cadastral », enregistrant les possessions de divers membres de la cour, même s'il est impossible de connaître leur taille, car les valeurs des unités de mesure de surface éblaïtes sont inconnues. Les domaines les plus vastes étaient ceux de la famille royale, en priorité du roi, et du vizir, puis des membres de la haute administration. Ils comprenaient généralement des champs éparpillés sur plusieurs terroirs, et n'étaient donc pas d'un seul tenant. Parfois, les terres d'un village étaient attribuées à un seul et même personnage. Une centaine de ces villages sont connus par les textes, ce qui semble indiquer un habitat de type dispersé.\nConcernent les types de cultures, les champs se divisaient en trois grandes catégories reprenant la « trilogie méditerranéenne ». Les champs céréaliers (GÁNA.KEŠDA) couvraient la plus grande partie du terroir. Environ les deux tiers des domaines étaient exclusivement céréaliers, le reste combinant différentes cultures. Un compte-rendu non datable montre qu'à une période le palais disposait de plus de 31 000 tonnes d'orge. Un quart à un tiers de la surface agricole serait couverte d'oliveraies (GIŠÌ.GIŠ). La vigne (GIŠGEŠTIN) était également cultivée. Les olives et le raisin étaient pressés dans les villages et les centres des domaines ruraux, comme l'attestent les mentions de pressoirs et de chais à vin dans certains documents. Il existait différentes qualités d'huile d'olive : une huile nouvelle, une huile amère, des huiles aromatisées (dont on se servait pour se parfumer), etc. On stockait ce produit dans des jarres : au moment de la fin du palais, ses réserves comptaient environ 4 000 jarres d'huile, 7 000 autres se trouvant dans les entrepôts des faubourgs. Selon les calculs effectués par A. Archi à partir de ces données, il a été évalué que les réserves totales du palais contenaient 330 000 litres d'huile, et en extrapolant à partir de cette donnée il a estimé qu'il aurait pu y avoir au moins 7 600 hectares d'oliveraies sur le territoire éblaïte.\nL'élevage était également une activité économique importante dans l'économie d'Ebla, dans une région relativement sèche qui permettait un élevage pastoral de type extensif. Les moutons sont de loin le type de bétail le plus présent dans les sources administratives. Le dénombrement des moutons dépendant du palais montrent qu'il y en avait énormément : il y en aurait eu entre 70 000 et 80 000 puis plus de 100 000 lors des derniers temps des archives. En saison sèche, ils paissaient dans les finages villageois du royaume, mais en saison humide ils étaient envoyés dans les zones de steppes plus lointaines qui étaient alors suffisamment herbeuses pour les nourrir. Des pasteurs étaient chargés de surveiller les troupeaux. Ils étaient élevés généralement pour leur laine, mais une dizaine de milliers était consacrée à l'alimentation, notamment celle des dieux (lors des sacrifices) et de l'entourage royal. Les bovins étaient également importants dans l'économie agricole éblaïte (plus de 8 000 têtes selon des comptes).\n\nArtisanat et commerce\nLes activités artisanales à Ebla sont peu documentées par les textes en comparaison de l'agriculture. Là encore le contrôle de l'administration royale est important. Le palais d'Ebla employait des ouvriers textiles (travail de la laine et du lin), des forgerons et orfèvres, ainsi que des personnes spécialisées dans la transformation des produits agricoles, notamment des femmes (minoterie, boulangerie, brasserie, vinification, parfums, etc.). Certains de ces produits faisaient l'objet d'envois vers d'autres royaumes : c'est le cas de l'huile d'olive et de produits textiles, qui étaient apparemment les activités de manufacture les plus importantes contrôlées par le palais royal. La métallurgie était également une activité de premier plan, puisque le palais employait près de 500 ferronniers, ce qui constitue le plus grand regroupement d'artisans connu pour cette période, même en comptant les archives sumériennes. Les métaux travaillés (cuivre, argent, or) provenaient probablement de l'Anatolie voisine.\nLes échanges sont connus par les tablettes de l'administration du palais enregistrant les entrées et les sorties d'objets. Il s'agit d'échanges effectués avec d'autres cours royales, probablement plus de type diplomatique que commercial. Mais ces sources révèlent ce à quoi devait ressembler le commerce international qui transparaît dans certaines sources. On sait que le palais employait ses propres marchands et qu'il s'arrangeait parfois pour leur assurer le monopole du commerce avec certains royaumes, comme cela se voit dans les clauses du traité passé avec Abarsal. Ebla se trouvait sur des routes commerciales importantes, notamment celles qui reliaient les zones d'extraction de métaux et de bois, en Anatolie et au nord du Levant, les ports de la façade méditerranéenne, et la riche Basse Mésopotamie qui était un lieu de consommation important de ces produits mais également un espace de transit de biens venant d'autres régions. Parmi les trouvailles effectuées dans le palais royal, il y a des objets venus d'Égypte, ainsi que du lapis-lazuli d'Afghanistan, ce qui témoigne de l'importance de l'échelle des échanges internationaux dans lesquels Ebla se trouvait impliquée. Les échanges de produits à l'intérieur du royaume se faisaient essentiellement dans le cadre des redistributions de produits par le palais à ses dépendants, et dans celui des impôts versés à l'État. Il semble que les fêtes religieuses aient été l'occasion de l'organisation de foires, comme c'est le cas à des périodes plus tardives de l'Antiquité.\n\nLa religion d'Ebla\nLes divinités du panthéon éblaïte sont connues essentiellement grâce aux listes d'offrandes données chaque mois par le palais aux temples. On y découvre la plus ancienne religion de Syrie qui soit connue, offrant des parallèles avec les sources des périodes suivantes, notamment Emar et Ugarit. Le fonds culturel est essentiellement sémitique, mais on remarque des particularités locales ainsi que des influences sumériennes et dans une moindre mesure hourrites. Le grand dieu du royaume éblaïte est Kura, inconnu par ailleurs. En revanche, les autres divinités principales du panthéon éblaïte se retrouvent ailleurs aux périodes suivantes : Dagan, dieu de la fertilité très important en Syrie ; le dieu de l'Orage Adda (Addu, Hadad) ; le dieu-soleil désigné par l'idéogramme sumérien UTU ; Rashap (Reshep), divinité infernale ; Ishkhara, déesse de la fertilité et divinité chthonienne ; Ashtar (Ishtar, Astarté), déesse céleste identifiée à la planète Vénus ; le dieu Kakkab (« étoile ») ; Kamish (le futur dieu moabite Kemoch), sans doute une autre divinité chthonienne. Plusieurs divinités inconnues par ailleurs ou impossibles à identifier apparaissent dans les textes en plus de Kura, comme sa parèdre Barana ou NI-da-KUL dont la lecture du nom n'est pas comprise. Parmi les divinités non sémitiques, se trouve le dieu sumérien Enki, la déesse Ninki, ainsi que la déesse hourrite Hebat.\nQuelques textes religieux ont également été exhumés, rédigés en sumérien et/ou en éblaïte. Des hymnes sont dédiés à des divinités importantes du panthéon. L'hymne au dieu-soleil Shamash est le plus long texte littéraire rédigé en éblaïte. On a aussi retrouvé le fragment d'un mythe mettant en scène des divinités sumériennes (Enki, Enlil, Utu), inconnu ailleurs. Le dernier type de texte religieux connu sont des collections d'exorcismes servant à conjurer des maux : morsures de serpents et d'insectes, maladies (notamment des maux de dents). Plusieurs rituels ayant lieu dans des temples ainsi que des fêtes dédiées aux divinités principales du panthéon sont attestées. Les Éblaïtes disposaient pour cela d'un calendrier religieux en parallèle à leur calendrier commun. On peut ajouter à ce tableau les rituels liés à la royauté évoqués précédemment, qui avaient un aspect religieux du fait de l'imbrication entre religieux et politique et du caractère sacré du pouvoir politique.\n\n« … une table d'offrande … un plateau d'offrande (est placé) devant (la statue du) dieu de la nuit. Un plateau d'offrande avec ..., un plateau d'offrande avec des « pains purs », un contenant d'huile, un contenant de bière, un contenant zibar de vin, un vase avec un jet d'eau pour le dieu de la nuit. (...) pour un tissu noir avec lequel parer (la statue de) la femme du dieu de la nuit. Offrande de plateaux avant la nuit. (...) (Ce sont) des offrandes sacrificielles pour le dieu de la nuit à l'occasion de ... du roi. »\n\n— Extrait du rituel au dieu de la nuit à Ébla (v. 2370 av. J.C.).\nL'édifice cultuel le mieux connu pour la période proto-syrienne est un temple localisé dans la partie sud-est de la ville basse (zone H), le « Temple du Rocher » ou « Temple HH », qui doit son surnom au fait que ses fondations reposent sur un rocher. Il s'agit d'un édifice de dimensions 29 × 22 mètres, d'orientation est-ouest, constitué de deux pièces : un vestibule (à l'est) qui ouvre par une petite porte (1,40 mètre de large) sur une cella (à l'ouest) de disposition mesurant 10,50 mètres de long et 7,80 mètres de large chacune. Elles sont entourées de murs d'une épaisseur allant de 5,60 à plus de 6 mètres. Il s'agit d'un des plus anciens exemples connus de temples in antis (où les murs latéraux dépassent le mur de la façade vers l'extérieur) courants durant la Haute Antiquité syrienne, type attesté dans les temples éblaïtes des périodes suivantes, ainsi que sur d'autres sites voisins (Alep, Alalakh). On ne sait pas à quel dieu il était attribué : P. Matthiae propose Kura (ou bien Hadad). Après la première destruction d'Ebla, cet édifice est remplacé par deux temples : le « Temple HH4 », mesurant 17,30 × 10,90 mètres, lui aussi de type in antis, composé d'un vestibule et d'une cella allongée ; et le petit « Temple HH5 » (10,50 × 5,50 mètres), voisin du précédent et de forme semblable. Ces deux temples sont détruits à la fin de la période proto-syrienne. Un sondage sous le temple d'Ishtar de l'époque paléo-syrienne a conduit à la découverte d'un autre temple de l'époque proto-syrienne, le « Temple rouge » (ou Temple D2), nommé ainsi en raison de la couleur de ses briques. Son organisation est très similaire à celle du Temple du Rocher. Par sa proximité au secteur palatial, il semble important dans le culte officiel, et pourrait être le temple de Kura du secteur palatial (Saza), où se déroule une partie du principal rituel royal (puisque deux sanctuaires du dieu sont mentionnés dans le texte rituel).\n\nRéalisations artistiques\nLes fouilles des niveaux proto-syriens du palais royal ont permis de mettre au jour certains éléments de la décoration intérieure du bâtiment. Le seuil du quartier administratif et les marches de l'escalier d'honneur comportaient des incrustations de nacre. La cour intérieure du quartier administratif et la salle du trône disposaient de panneaux muraux dont certains étaient incrustés de feuilles d'or, d'éléments en calcaire ou en lapis-lazuli formant des figures, les seules parties de ces œuvres à avoir passé l'épreuve du temps ; la structure porteuse était sans doute en bois. Certains de ces panneaux représentaient des processions de fonctionnaires rendant hommage au souverain. Ces réalisations ont des parallèles à Mari à la même période, et même dans les objets incrustés de Sumer comme l'étendard d'Ur.\nLe quartier administratif a également livré des statuettes composites, dont on a surtout conservé les éléments de coiffure, réalisés dans de la stéatite ou parfois en lapis-lazuli. Le corps des statues était en pierre dure ou en métal, et pouvait être orné de pierres précieuses, voire d'or. La décoration comprenait également des meubles marquetés et décorés parfois de petites figurines en marbre. On a identifié des tables ou des sièges faisant partie du mobilier du palais grâce à ce type de figurines. Elles représentaient parfois des rondes animales, ou bien des combats de héros et d'animaux mythologiques. Généralement, les thèmes de ces scènes comme ceux des sceaux-cylindres exhumés dans le palais sont identiques à ceux de la Mésopotamie contemporaine, malgré quelques originalités éblaïtes, comme la figure de la déesse domptant deux lions. Certaines scènes devaient représenter des mythes locaux qui nous sont inconnus. Tout cela témoigne en tout cas de la présence à Ebla d'une tradition d'artistes de qualité qui n'avaient rien à envier à ceux de Sumer.\nLes fouilles ayant eu lieu dans le palais royal au début des années 2000 ont conduit à la découverte de nouveaux objets de la période archaïque. Les plus remarquables trouvailles ont eu lieu dans une petite pièce disposée sur le côté sud de la salle du trône, sans doute destinée à stocker les objets offerts au roi lors d'audiences : du lapis-lazuli brut, des incrustations en coquille et calcaire parfois recouverts de feuilles d'or, représentant des animaux ou des personnages et des parties de statuettes, dont des feuilles d'or destinées à recouvrir ce type d'objet et des chevelures en stéatite. Un sondage dans le secteur FF a permis de retrouver les restes d'un bâtiment de cette même époque, où ont été récupérés des fragments de peintures murales à motifs géométriques, témoignage unique sur la pratique de la peinture dans des bâtiments de la Syrie intérieure dans la seconde moitié du IIIe millénaire.\n\nLa fin d'Ebla\nPeu de temps après le mariage d'une princesse éblaïte avec le prince mésopotamien de Kish, le palais royal d'Ebla est détruit et brûlé, selon toute vraisemblance dans la violence. Se pose donc la question de savoir qui est le responsable de cette chute. Le coupable idéal est l'empire d'Akkad, venu de Basse Mésopotamie et qui a soumis les autres grands royaumes de Mésopotamie du nord et de Syrie après 2340. On a pendant un temps attribué la destruction d'Ebla à Naram-Sîn, qui a régné sur Akkad vers le milieu du XXIIIe siècle, avant de privilégier son grand-père Sargon d'Akkad, fondateur de l'empire dans les dernières décennies du XXIVe siècle. Ces deux rois ont en tout cas mené des offensives en Syrie et soumis la région d'Ebla. Ils déclarent tous les deux avoir dominé la ville. Mais une autre hypothèse dit qu'Ebla a été détruite avant le règne de Sargon, ce qui invaliderait la destruction causée par les Akkadiens. Dans ce cas, c'est donc plutôt à Mari, l'ennemie héréditaire, qu'il faudrait attribuer la destruction du royaume éblaïte, qui aurait eu lieu au plus tard vers le milieu du XXIVe siècle. Mais cette hypothèse ne repose sur aucune preuve. Il semble qu'une seconde destruction ait dévasté le site après la première, alors que le palais ait été réoccupé après son premier abandon. L'auteur de cette seconde catastrophe est encore plus énigmatique que pour la première. Si les rois d'Akkad ne sont pas responsables de la première destruction, peut-être ont-ils causé la seconde, mais celle-ci est généralement datée d'une période plus tardive.\n\nEbla durant la période « paléo-syrienne » (c. 2000-1600 av. J.-C.)\nAu début du IIe millénaire s'ouvre une nouvelle période de l'histoire d'Ebla, dénommée par les fouilleurs la période « paléo-syrienne ». Elle correspond à la période paléo-babylonienne (ou amorrite) de Mésopotamie et à l'âge du bronze moyen du Moyen-Orient. Si la période précédente était surtout connue surtout ar les sources épigraphiques, celle-ci l'est grâce aux découvertes de bâtiments et d'oeuvres artistiques.\nLe XXe siècle avant J.-C. voit un renouveau de la ville d'Ebla, dans le contexte d'une Syrie dominée par des dynasties d'origine amorrite. C'est de cette période que date la statue de basalte du roi Ibbit-Lim qui a permis l'identification du site. En l'absence de sources épigraphiques, on ne sait presque rien sur le destin de la cité à cette période, d'autant plus que les archives de la cité de Mari, la source la plus importante pour l'histoire de la Syrie à la période amorrite, mentionnent très peu Ebla. Selon toute vraisemblance, ce royaume est alors dans la mouvance du puissant royaume d'Alep, le Yamhad.\nEbla est apparemment reconstruite suivant un plan prédéterminé, et elle connaît alors une extension plus grande qu'à la période proto-syrienne. La ville est comprise dans une vaste enceinte, disposant de plusieurs forts et portes. En son centre se trouvait l'acropole, elle-même défendue par sa propre muraille. La ville basse s'étendait à ses pieds, organisée autour d'une première ceinture de bâtiments officiels (temples et palais) aux pieds de l'acropole. Puis se trouvaient les quartiers d'habitation, où ont également été dégagés quelques bâtiments administratifs. Le tracé des rues suivait un plan relativement ordonné : des radiales partaient des portes et rejoignaient l'acropole, tandis que d'autres rues suivaient un plan perpendiculaire (axes est-ouest et nord-sud).\n\nL'acropole\nUne acropole d'environ 3 hectares dominait la ville d'Ebla, à l'emplacement du palais royal paléo-syrien. Cet espace contient deux monuments importants, mais les constructions n'y sont pas bien conservées. Cet ensemble est en réalité une citadelle, défendue par un rempart construit avec des blocs de pierre pour sa partie inférieure (sans doute haute de 4 mètres) et des briques crues sur la partie supérieure.\n\nLe palais royal\nLe nord de l'acropole était occupé par le palais E, identifié par P. Matthiae comme étant le palais royal. L'érosion l'a très durement touché et il n'en reste que peu de traces. Il a néanmoins été possible d'identifier une cour entourée de plusieurs salles (des pièces d'apparat ?) sur deux côtés, et fermée au sud par une loggia.\n\nLe temple D\nSur la partie ouest de l'acropole, au point le plus élevé, se dressait le Temple D ou « grand temple ». Son plan était de facture classique : on pénétrait d'abord dans une salle allongée de 28 × 11 mètres, avant d'accéder à un vestibule précédé d'un porche, ouvrant sur la cella comportant une niche où se trouvait la statue de la divinité principale du sanctuaire, probablement la déesse Ishtar. Cette salle a livré un bassin lustral à deux vasques, décoré de bas-reliefs représentant une scène rituelle. C'est aussi dans cet édifice qu'on a retrouvé la statue fragmentaire en basalte inscrite au nom du roi Ibbit-Lim qui a permis d'identifier le site de Tell Mardikh comme étant l'antique Ebla.\nDevant le temple D, une place était entourée de petites chapelles, constituant une zone sacrée, avec notamment le Petit Temple, où on a exhumé des statues votives et une stèle en basalte sculptée sur quatre faces, représentant une scène religieuse sur plusieurs registres, dominée par la figure d'Ishtar vêtue d'un kaunakès, debout sur un taureau, symbole de fertilité dans cette région (bien que son animal-attribut soit habituellement le lion). Il s'agissait probablement de la divinité principale de la cité à cette période.\n\nLa ville basse\nAu pied de l'acropole et jusqu'à l'enceinte extérieure s'étendait l'espace appelé « ville basse » par les archéologues qui ont fouillé le site. L'acropole était ceinturée, au moins sur sa partie occidentale, par un ensemble de monuments publics (temples et palais) qui prolongeaient ses fonctions, mais devaient être plus accessibles.\n\nLe système des fortifications\nLe périmètre de la ville basse était délimité par une enceinte extérieure qui protégeait la cité. Elle était construite sur un remblai fait de terre prise à l'extérieur de la ville et mêlée à des pierres provenant des ruines des périodes précédentes. À l'extérieur, la base des murs était protégée par un parement de blocs de pierres sur 5 mètres de hauteur. La base des murs était large de 40 mètres environ et leur hauteur a pu atteindre 22 mètres.\nLe système de défense était renforcé par une série de portes fortifiées et de fortins, auxquels les archéologues modernes ont donné des noms suivant leur localisation, leur nom antique étant perdu. Au nord-ouest, la « porte d'Alep » jouxtait la « forteresse AA » à l'ouest. Le côté ouest était défendu par le « fort V », et dans la zone Z, aux pieds du rempart, ont été dégagées plusieurs habitations cossues dont la « résidence occidentale » qui a pu avoir une fonction administrative. La « porte de Damas », au sud-ouest, était protégée par une tour de défense et un fortin. L'angle sud-est de la muraille comprenait une autre forteresse et la « porte du désert » (ou de la steppe). Le côté est de la muraille était défendu par la « Forteresse M », mesurant 27 × 13 mètres et constituée de deux rangées de pièces parallèles. Le côté nord-est était défendu par une autre forteresse, au nord de laquelle on trouvait une dernière porte (« porte de l'Euphrate »).\n\nLe palais Q\nLe palais Q, ou palais occidental, était situé à l'ouest de la ville basse, juste au pied du Grand Temple de l'acropole. D'orientation nord-sud, il avait une longueur de 115 mètres et une largeur maximale de 65 mètres environ et comprenait au moins une cinquantaine de pièces. Certains de ses murs sont encore bien conservés, leurs ruines s’élevant parfois à 3 mètres. La partie sud pourrait avoir compris un portique à colonnes servant d'entrée. Il ouvrait sur une suite de cours conduisant sur les pièces d'apparat, dont une salle du trône avec un portique à deux colonnes, et sur des espaces d'intendance avec des magasins où on a retrouvé des jarres de stockage. Sur sa partie nord au moins, le palais disposait d'un étage attesté par les restes d'escaliers. Il servait apparemment de résidence au prince héritier durant les dernières décennies d'Ebla, d'où le nom de « palais du prince » qui lui est parfois donné. Ce palais est en tout cas lié à la fonction royale, puisqu'il jouxte le temple dédié au culte des ancêtres royaux (« Temple B ») et que sous son sol ont été creusées des tombes pour les membres de la famille royale.\n\nLes tombes royales\nLe palais Q était bâti au-dessus de tombes souterraines, creusées dans des cavités naturelles aménagées pour accueillir les membres de la famille royale ayant vécu entre la fin du XIXe siècle et la première moitié du XVIIe siècle. On y accédait par un couloir à escaliers creusé sous l'édifice. Une dizaine de tombes ont été identifiées, dont seulement trois ont été inviolées durant l'Antiquité.\nLa plus ancienne des trois est la « tombe de la princesse » (v. 1800 av. J.-C.), où se trouvait le corps d'une jeune fille. Son accès était fermé par une grande dalle de calcaire. La défunte portait des bijoux en or (une épingle, un collier, des bracelets). La tombe comportait également plus de soixante-dix vases en céramique, des vases en pierre et une amphore en pâte de verre.\nLa tombe suivante, celle du « seigneur aux capridés » (v. 1750 av. J.-C.) occupait trois salles. Elle a été pillée lors de la destruction d'Ebla vers 1600 et le corps a disparu. On y a cependant retrouvé une soixantaine de vases en céramique, des vases en pierre, d'autres pièces de vaisselle (notamment une coupe en argent inscrite au nom d'Immeya, sans doute le défunt), des objets en ivoire dont le manche d'une masse d'armes incrustée d'un cylindre en argent au nom d'un pharaon obscur de la XIIIe dynastie. La tombe doit son nom au fait qu'on y a exhumé quatre statuettes en bronze représentant des capridés qui servaient sans doute à décorer un trône en bois et bronze.\nLa dernière sépulture est la « tombe des citernes » (première moitié du XVIIe siècle), nommée ainsi car installée dans une ancienne citerne, à laquelle on accédait depuis la précédente via un escalier. Ses pilleurs n'y ont laissé que des tessons de céramique et quelques bijoux, ainsi qu'une masse d'armes.\nLa richesse de ces tombes (en dépit des pillages) permet de les attribuer à des membres de la famille royale d'Ebla. Chacune des trois sépultures comprenait divers objets provenant d'Égypte : les deux masses d'armes de la tombe du seigneur aux capridés et de la tombe des citernes, ainsi que des vases en albâtre. Il s'agit peut-être de cadeaux diplomatiques, mais ils pourraient aussi provenir d'échanges commerciaux. D'autres objets rappellent ceux qui étaient produits par les artisans de la Babylonie amorrite.\n\nLe palais P\nUn dernier complexe palatial a été identifié au nord de la ville basse, le « palais P » ou « palais nord ». Il est peut-être bâti sur un ancien palais royal qui servait de centre administratif dans la dernière phase de la période proto-syrienne. Il était de forme trapézoïdale et couvrait environ 3 500 m2. Sa partie centrale était une zone résidentielle apparemment réservée au roi, et on y a même identifié ce qui pourrait être une salle du trône, parce qu'une estrade en pierre bâtie sur un de ses côtés aurait pu servir pour porter le trône royal. Une salle proche disposait d'un grand bassin en basalte. Les pièces situées au nord de l'édifice étaient des magasins. Il est possible que ce palais n'ait eu alors aucune fonction administrative, mais plutôt un rôle cultuel lié à la proximité du Temple P. Mais les fonctions exactes des trois espaces palatiaux identifiés pour cette période restent sujet à caution.\n\nLes temples\nLe « Temple P2 » se trouve dans la partie nord-ouest de la ville basse, dans une zone sacrée située entre le palais Q et le palais P, que P. Matthiae considère consacrée à la déesse Ishtar, en lien avec le temple de l'acropole. Le temple P2 est un édifice mesurant 33 × 20 mètres, disposant de murs très épais, ce qui en fait le plus grand temple de cette période dans la ville et même parmi ceux connus pour toute la Syrie d'alors. Il était constitué d'une grande pièce centrale précédée d'un porche in antis. Des fragments de statues représentant des souverains et des hauts dignitaires y ont été exhumées. La plus complète, haute de plus de 1 mètre, représente un dignitaire assis sur un siège, dans un style typique de la Syrie de cette période, qui trouve des parallèles à Alalakh ou Qatna. Un bassin cultuel sculpté a été mis au jour dans ce sanctuaire. On a également dégagé dans cette aire sacrée un « Monument P3 », qui présente un caractère massif. Il mesure 52,40 mètres de long pour 42 de large, est bâti avec des blocs de pierre entourant une cour (de 23,20 × 12,40 mètres) inaccessible de l'extérieur. Aucun mobilier n'y a été identifié. P. Matthiae a proposé d'y voir un endroit où on gardait des lions, animaux emblématiques de la déesse Ishtar. Le secteur P a également été le lieu de trouvailles de différents objets : figurines en terre cuite, deux serpents en bronze, un sceau-cylindre en hématite portant une scène cultuelle mettant peut-être en scène Ishtar, des coupes, ainsi que des fragments de métaux et pierres précieuses (or, argent, lapis-lazuli).\nDans la partie nord-est de la ville basse, un « Temple N », peut-être le temple du dieu-soleil Shamash, a été dégagé en retrait par rapport au reste des constructions. Un troisième temple dans cette partie de la ville vers le sud-ouest, le « Temple C », aurait été dédié au dieu chthonien Rashap. Il est de dimensions réduites ; on y a retrouvé deux bassins lustraux à deux vasques, sur lesquels ont été sculptées des scènes cultuelles.\nUn autre sanctuaire a été identifié non loin du précédent, le « Temple B2 ». Il était organisé autour d'un espace central entouré de plusieurs pièces, le tout formant un bâtiment de forme irrégulière. Les murs de la salle principale étaient bordés de banquettes et d'un podium, et les petites pièces disposées autour comportaient des plates-formes identifiées comme étant des autels. Selon le fouilleur du site, il s'agissait d'un bâtiment dédié au culte des ancêtres royaux, pratique religieuse bien connue pour le Bronze récent grâce aux trouvailles épigraphiques d'Ugarit et archéologiques de Qatna. La salle centrale aurait servi pour les banquets organisés en l'honneur des défunts, tandis que les salles adjacentes auraient été des cellae dédiées aux différents rois décédés.\nEnfin, le sanctuaire le plus récemment mis au jour pour cette période se trouve dans la partie sud-est de la ville basse, au-dessus de l'ancien Temple du Rocher. On lui connaît un premier état le « Temple HH3 », dont il ne reste que les fondations. Il est ensuite remplacé vers 1800 par le « Temple HH2 », mieux connu. Il s'agissait d'un temple in antis à façade, d'environ 25 mètres de long pour 16 de large, composé de 3 salles ayant toutes la même largeur (9,10 mètres) : un vestibule de 2,50 mètres de long, une ante-cella de 2,30 mètres de long et enfin une cella allongée (entre 9,50 et 10,50 mètres, le fond ayant disparu). Comme pour le Temple du Rocher, sa divinité tutélaire est inconnue.\n\nLes résidences et le palais méridional\nLes monuments construits au pied de l'acropole devaient être bordés par des quartiers résidentiels s'étendant au moins jusqu'à l'enceinte extérieure. Les fouilles des années 2000 ont permis de faire progresser la connaissance de ces secteurs. Quelques maisons ont été fouillées dans la ville basse juste au sud-ouest de l'acropole (zones B, Z et FF) et dans d'autres lieux de fouilles dispersés (zones A et Z près de deux portes, zone N au nord de l'acropole), certains de ces endroits montrant un échantillon de quartier d'habitat. Ces maisons étaient construites avec un soubassement de pierre, les parties supérieures des murs et sans doute le toit (en terrasse) étant en briques d'argile crues et les murs intérieurs recouverts d'enduit. L'organisation interne de ces résidences présentait des caractéristiques typiques des maisons du Levant de cette période. Les plus petites comptaient souvent un vestibule ouvrant sur un espace central d'où on parvenait à deux ou trois pièces. Les plus grandes avaient une organisation similaire mais comprenaient plus de salles. Elles utilisaient également des matériaux de meilleure qualité, puisque leur sol était peut-être couvert de dalles ou de calcaire broyé par endroits, alors que la plupart des résidences avaient des sols en terre battue. Plus on trouve de pièces, plus celles-ci présentent une division fonctionnelle de l'espace : il est ainsi possible de repérer des espaces de stockage, de cuisine, ou destinés aux activités économiques liées aux échanges.\nLe palais FF est de loin la plus grande résidence mise au jour, avec ses 1 000 m2. Il a été désigné comme le « palais méridional ». Son organisation s'inspirait en effet du modèle de palais royal, notamment avec de vastes espaces de réception ; il jouxtait des écuries. Il pourrait s'agir de la résidence d'un grand dignitaire chargé de l'accueil de messagers (le vizir ?).\n\nLa destruction du site\nVers 1600, la ville d'Ebla est détruite à la suite d'un conflit. Là encore, le contexte de la destruction reste obscur. En l'état actuel des connaissances, le plus vraisemblable est de la relier aux offensives menées en Syrie par les Hittites, qui ravagent à la même époque d'autres cités de la mouvance du Yamhad, d'abord Alalakh sous Hattusili Ier (v. 1625-1600 av. J.-C.), puis la capitale Alep sous le règne de Mursili Ier (v. 1600-1585 av. J.-C.). Ils font ensuite subir le même sort à Babylone. En 1983 de notre ère, une tablette fut découverte dans les ruines de Hattusa, la capitale hittite, rédigée en hittite et en hourrite. Elle racontait le récit épique de la prise d'Ebla par un souverain hourrite inconnu, un certain Pizikarra de Ninive. Si l'on accepte la valeur historique de ce texte, il faut envisager que Pizikarra a agi pour le compte du roi hittite. Quoi qu'il en soit, le site d'Ebla est alors abandonné, même si le nom de la ville apparaît encore dans le récit d'une campagne du pharaon Thoutmôsis III au XVe siècle.\n\nPhases tardives\nLe site de Tell Mardikh a livré quelques trouvailles archéologiques des périodes plus tardives de l'Antiquité, mais il n'est alors plus qu'un modeste établissement rural. La période de domination achéménide (v. Ve – IVe siècle av. J.-C.) semble indiquer un renouveau de l'importance du site. Dans la partie nord de l'acropole, un petit édifice administratif (un « palazzetto » d'après les fouilleurs) comprenant plusieurs pièces organisées autour d'une cour rectangulaire a été dégagé. Le site de Tell Mardikh semblerait alors être un centre administratif ou agricole servant pour le pouvoir perse. Des restes de résidences du IIIe siècle de notre ère et d'un petit monastère datant des siècles suivants ont été mis au jour, après quoi il n'y a plus de trace d'une occupation durable du site.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nSyrie : Mémoire et Civilisation, Paris, Institut du monde arabe - Flammarion, 1993\nPaolo Matthiae, Aux origines de la Syrie : Ebla retrouvée, Paris, Gallimard, coll. « Découvertes Gallimard / Archéologie » (no 276), 1996\n(en) Amalia Catagnoti, « Ebla », dans Raymond Westbrook (dir.), A History of Ancient Near Eastern Law, vol. 1, Leyde, Brill, coll. « Handbuch der Orientalistik », 2003, p. 227-239\n(en) Alfonso Archi et Maria Giovanna Biga, « A Victory over Mari and the Fall of Ebla », Journal of Cuneiform Studies, no 55,‎ 2003, p. 1-44\nPietro Mander, « Les dieux et le culte à Ebla », dans Gregorio del Olmo Lete (dir.), Mythologie et religion des sémites occidentaux : Volume I.

      "summary": "Ebla (arabe : إبلا ʾĪblā) (ou Tall Mardikh, arabe : تل مرديخ Tall Mardīḵ) est une ancienne ville de la Syrie des IIIe et IIe millénaires av. J.-C., dont les ruines se trouvent à l'emplacement du site archéologique de Tell Mardikh. Il se situe à 60 km au sud d'Alep sur la route de Hama, après la bifurcation en direction de Lattaquié. Il occupe une position stratégique, à la porte d'un col contrôlant l'accès à la mer Méditerranée.\nLe site se présente sous la forme d'un tell ovale de 60 hectares dominé par une acropole centrale. Il a été découvert en 1964 et fouillé par les équipes du professeur Paolo Matthiae (de l'université La Sapienza de Rome) en 1968.\nEbla est une riche cité dès le IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. Ses rois commencent à partir de 2 500 av. J.-C. à étendre leur domination sur le Moyen Euphrate et sur une partie de la Syrie. Les fouilles ont permis de mettre au jour une salle d'archives, riche de plus de 17 000 tablettes et fragments de tablettes d'argile gravées en sumérien et en éblaïte, la langue locale. Ces textes ont fourni des informations précieuses sur l'économie, le commerce, l'industrie, l'administration et la diplomatie de ce puissant royaume. Des archives économiques, des traités d'alliance avec les États voisins, des relations de guerre et de paix, des épopées et des hymnes religieux montrent qu'Ebla fut l'une des plus puissantes cités-États de la Syrie entre 2500 et 2400 av. J.-C.\nIl est possible de visiter les vestiges dégagés de palais, de temples et d'autres édifices. Alors que la documentation écrite concerne les XXVe et XXIVe siècles av. J.-C., les monuments, les objets et œuvres d'art dégagés datent essentiellement du début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C., la dernière période pendant laquelle Ebla florissait avant sa destruction finale.",
