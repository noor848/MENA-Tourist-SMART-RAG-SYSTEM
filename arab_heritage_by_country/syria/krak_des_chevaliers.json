      "content": "Krak des Chevaliers (French: [kʁak de ʃ(ə)valje]; Arabic: قلعة الحصن, romanized: Qalʿat al-Ḥiṣn, Arabic: [ˈqalʕat alˈħisˤn]; Old French: Crac des Chevaliers or Crac de l'Ospital, lit. 'karak [fortress] of the hospital'; from Classical Syriac: ܟܪܟܐ, romanized: karəḵā, lit. 'walled city') is a medieval castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.\nThe Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 the Mamluk Sultanate captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the knights to surrender.\nRenewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\nToday, the village of al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n\nEtymology\n\"Krak\" is derived from karak, the Syriac word for a walled city or fortress. Before the arrival of the crusaders, the local Arab ruler had established a fortification on the site manned by Kurds, giving it the name, in Arabic, of Ḥoṣn al-Akrād (حصن الأكراد), or \"fort of the Kurds\". Following the construction of the present castle, the crusaders (whose elite spoke either Old French or, in Tripoli, possibly Old Occitan) corrupted that name into Le Crat and then, as a result of confusing it with karak, the name evolved into Le Crac.\nBecause of its association with the Knights Hospitallers, it was known as Crac de l'Ospital (Fortress of the Hospital) during the Middle Ages. The name was later romanticised to become Krak des Chevaliers in French in the 19th century, meaning \"Fortress of the Knights\".\n\nLocation\nThe castle sits atop a 650-metre-high (2,130 ft) hill east of Tartus, Syria, in the Homs Gap. On the other side of the gap, 27 kilometres (17 mi) away, was the 12th-century castle of Gibelacar (Hisn Ibn Akkar). The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of Tripoli and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range, and to the south, Lebanon. The surrounding area is fertile, benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall. Compared to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.\nProperty in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.\n\nHistory\nOrigins and Crusader period\nAccording to the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Shaddad, in 1031, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo and Homs, Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr, established a settlement of Kurdish tribesmen at the site of the castle, which was then known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ\". Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids' access to the coast of Tripoli after they lost nearby Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimids in 1029. Due to Nasr's garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Akrād\" (Fortress of the Kurds). The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the Jibal al-Alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli. When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.\nIn January 1099, on the journey to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day, Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains, and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.\nThe origins of the order of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but it probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order that cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many Crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s, the order became militarised when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, that offered protection to pilgrims.\n\nBetween 1142 and 1144 Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted property in the county to the order. According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a \"palatinate\" within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state, which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Further, Raymond II could not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.\nAfter acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel. In 1163, the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.\nDrought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards, Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188, Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle, decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.\nAnother earthquake struck in 1202, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.\n\nThe first half of the 13th century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271, and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King Andrew II of Hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the \"key of the Christian lands\". He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the Master and 40 to the brothers. Geoffroy de Joinville, uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades Jean de Joinville, died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle's chapel.\nThe main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders, although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to pay tribute to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203, the garrison was making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.\n\nIn the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252, after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268, Master Hugues Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000 people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.\nAs for Hugues Revel, some of the castellans of this castle are identified: Pierre de Mirmande (Grand Commander) and Geoffroy le Rat (Grand Master).\nBaibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271, Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle, the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3 March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege, only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, who was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived, he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.\nRain interrupted the siege, but on 21 March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29 March, the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner, causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward, they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission, (aman), for them to surrender on 8 April 1271. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs (prayer niches) were added to the interior.\n\nLater history\nDuring the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the castle housed a company of local janissaries and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hisn al-Akrad, attached first to the Tripoli Sanjak and later Homs, both part of the Tripoli Eyalet. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area, and in the 18th century the district was mainly controlled by local notables from the Dandashi family. In 1894, the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of auxiliary soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result, the capital of the district was then moved to nearby Talkalakh.\nAfter the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291, European familiarity with the castles of the Crusades declined. It was not until the 19th century that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871, he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; which included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.\nPaul Deschamps visited the castle in February 1927. Since Rey had visited in the 19th century, a village of 500 people had been established within the castle. Renewed inhabitation had damaged the site: underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed. Deschamps and fellow architect François Anus attempted to clear some of the detritus; General Maurice Gamelin assigned 60 Alawite soldiers to help. Deschamps left in March 1927, and work resumed when he returned two years later. The culmination of Deschamp's work at the castle was the publication of Les Châteaux des Croisés en Terre Sainte I: le Crac des Chevaliers in 1934, with detailed plans by Anus. The survey has been widely praised, described as \"brilliant and exhaustive\" by military historian D. J. Cathcart King in 1949 and \"perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written\" by historian Hugh Kennedy in 1994.\nAs early as 1929, there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under French control. On 16 November 1933, Krak des Chevaliers was given into the control of the French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1 million between them in compensation. Over the following two years, a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120 workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal'at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.\n\nSeveral of the castle's former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al-Husn has since developed. Many of the al-Husn's roughly 9,000 Muslims residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site.\nThe Syrian Civil War began in 2011, prompting UNESCO to raise concerns that the war might damage cultural sites including Krak des Chevaliers. The castle was shelled in August 2012 by the Syrian Arab Army, damaging the Crusader chapel. It was damaged again in July 2013 by an airstrike conducted by the Syrian Arab Air Force during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013. The Syrian Arab Army captured the castle and village after the Battle of Hosn in March 2014. Since then, UNESCO has published periodic reports about the state of the site, reconstruction and conservation measures.\n\nArchitecture\nWriting in the early 20th century, T. E. Lawrence, popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, remarked that Krak des Chevaliers was \"perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world, [a castle which] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the Crusading buildings of Syria\". Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration; in the Levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design. Kennedy suggests that \"The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers.\"\n\nKrak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a \"walled suburb\" known as a burgus, no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle, the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.\n\nInner ward\nBetween 1142 and 1170, the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.\n\nWhen Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south, which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.\nAt the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12th century, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.\n\nChapel\nThe current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170. Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel. The later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in France, but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at Margat. It was divided into three roughly equal bays. A cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins. Oriented roughly east to west, it was 21.5 metres (71 ft) long and 8.5 metres (28 ft) wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall. When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the cornice, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935, a second chapel was discovered outside the castle's main entrance, however it no longer survives.\n\nOuter ward\nThe second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing 9 metres (30 ft) high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Château Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s, a postern was added to the north wall.\nArrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimise the amount of dead ground around the castle. Machicolations crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped, archers would have had to crouch inside them. The box machicolations were unusual: those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at Saône or Margat, and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the Citadel of Aleppo. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall-walk known as a chemin de ronde. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy, the defences of the outer wall were \"the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east ... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine\".\nWhen the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for 137 metres (450 ft), and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.\n\nFrescoes\nDespite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978, medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel makes them difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Syria\nList of Crusader castles\nList of World Heritage in Danger\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nKrak des Chevaliers photos and information\nUNESCO Crac des Chevaliers",

The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.\nThe Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area.

Cette conquête met fin à 129 ans d'invincibilité du fort.\nThomas Edward Lawrence, en le découvrant en 1909, le jour de son 21e anniversaire, le qualifie de « plus beau des châteaux du monde, certainement le plus pittoresque que j’ai vu, une véritable merveille. »\n\nSituation géographique et chronologie\nDominant d'environ cinq-cents mètres la plaine d'El-Bukeia, situé à proximité du Liban (huit kilomètres), le krak des Chevaliers fait partie d'un réseau défensif qui parcourt les frontières des anciens États latins d'Orient et contrôle la trouée d'Homs, point stratégique au carrefour des routes reliant Homs, à l'est, à la ville côtière de Tortose, à l'ouest, et Antioche, au nord, à Tripoli puis Beyrouth, au sud. C'est l'un des châteaux croisés les plus prestigieux et les mieux conservés.\n\nAntiquité\nLe Moyen-Orient fut toujours un point de rencontre des civilisations. S'y croisèrent Babyloniens, Égyptiens, Hittites, Hébreux, Romains, Perses, Byzantins, Arabes, Kurdes, Turcs seldjoukides puis ottomans, autant de cultures militaires différentes qui créèrent là une nouvelle architecture dont la quintessence reste de nos jours incarnée par le krak des Chevaliers.\nLa bataille de Qadesh opposant Ramsès II aux Hittites aux environs de 1274 avant notre ère a probablement eu lieu sur le Tell Nébi Mend à cinquante kilomètres au sud-est du krak ; elle est relatée sur les bas-reliefs du temple de Louxor. On y voit une forteresse hérissée de hautes tours et de créneaux. Qadesh va ensuite décliner au profit de la cité antique d'Émèse, mieux située. Les Romains dans un premier temps, puis les Byzantins après le Grand Schisme d'Orient dresseront dans la région de l'actuelle Syrie de nombreuses forteresses de tradition hellénique pour résister à la pression persane qui seront autant de modèles pour les fortifications construites par les armées arabo-musulmanes après qu'elles eurent conquis cette région de 634 à 639.\n\nConquête arabo-musulmane\nD'abord sous la domination omeyyade, la construction reprend de plus belle, mais des fortifications byzantines sont aussi remaniées et transformées en véritables palais, les bâtisseurs profitant de la présence d'antiques infrastructures (barrage sur l'Oronte et son aqueduc) pour faire fleurir des jardins au milieu du désert. Ces constructions continuèrent après la prise du pouvoir par les Abbassides en 750, et déclinèrent au fur et à mesure que l'armée, composée essentiellement de Turcs d'une tradition militaire moins basée sur les fortifications, s'emparait du pouvoir. De 945 à 1055, des Iraniens établiront même la dynastie des Bouyides.\nDurant la même période, arrivent deux évènements majeurs engageant l'avenir de la région. D'abord, en 909, les fatimides chiites s'opposent au pouvoir abbasside de Bagdad et fondent une dynastie qui règnera sur tout le Maghreb et s'étendra au début du XIe siècle jusqu'en Palestine. Al Hakim lance alors une répression contre les chrétiens d'Orient et les pèlerins chrétiens, traditionnellement bien tolérés. Il détruit les édifices chrétiens de Jérusalem. Cette fermeture soudaine des lieux et routes de pèlerinage sera l'un des événements qui conduisirent au déclenchement des croisades. En second lieu, les Seldjoukides, turcophones islamisés (sunnites) originaires de steppes à l'est de la mer d'Aral se lancent à la conquête du Moyen-Orient. Ils s'emparent de Bagdad en 1055, et prennent l'est de l'Anatolie aux Byzantins lors de la bataille de Manzikert en 1071, et leur sultanat s'étend alors sur l'Iran, l'est de l'Anatolie, la Syrie et la Palestine jusqu'aux frontières de l'Égypte fatimide. Le krak est alors reconstruit sur le site d'une petite forteresse, sans doute occupée depuis l'antiquité, en 1031 par les Abbassides qui y installent une garnison kurde pour résister à la pression seldjoukide. La forteresse devint connue sous le nom de Hisn al-Akrād la « forteresse des Kurdes ».\n\nLa première croisade\nEn janvier 1099, à l'arrivée de la première croisade, la garnison kurde fut évincée par Raymond de Saint-Gilles qui abandonna les lieux presque immédiatement, son objectif étant Jérusalem. Il tenta en vain de reprendre la forteresse en avril 1102 et c'est finalement Tancrède, le régent d'Antioche, qui s'en empara en 1110 et y installa une garnison franque sous l'autorité du comte de Tripoli. En 1115, une offensive d'Arslan, l'émir d'Alep, fut repoussée.\nAu fil des années, l'importance du krak des Chevaliers crut parallèlement à l'influence des croisés vers l'est mais le coût de sa maintenance conduisit Raymond II à le confier à la garde des Hospitaliers (1142). C'est de cette époque que date le nom « krak des Chevaliers ». La forteresse pouvait accueillir une garnison de 2 000 hommes. \nSous l'impulsion des Hospitaliers, plusieurs autres ouvrages défensifs furent construits dans les environs et le krak des Chevaliers fut dès lors relié par signaux de feu et par pigeons voyageurs aux fortifications de Gibelacar et Chastel Rouge (Hospitaliers) et de Chastel Blanc et Arima (Templiers).\n\nLa deuxième croisade\nÀ partir du milieu du XIIe siècle, à la suite de la chute des Seldjoukides, aux victoires de Zengi sur les croisés (perte d'Édesse), à l'échec du siège de Damas par la deuxième croisade, et à l'arrivée au pouvoir de Nur ad-Din, un front musulman uni se dessine et la pression sur les croisés — et donc sur le krak des Chevaliers — se fait plus forte.\nEn 1157, un important tremblement de terre ébranle le château et Raymond du Puy, le grand maître des Hospitaliers, le fait restaurer et agrandir grâce à un financement du roi de Bohême. Ce fut la première d'une série de quatre phases de travaux qui s'échelonnèrent sur un siècle et demi (1144-1170, 1170-1202, 1250-1271 et 1271-1285).\nEn 1163, Nur ad-Din tente de s'emparer du krak mais son armée est mise en déroute au pied même de la forteresse par une attaque surprise de la cavalerie franque qui poursuit et décime les fuyards. Un second siège échoue aussi en 1167.\nUn second tremblement de terre (1170) ayant causé des dégâts considérables, le krak des Chevaliers est reconstruit et consolidé en incluant de nombreux éléments d'architecture militaire empruntés aux Byzantins.\nSaladin eut beau infliger de nombreuses défaites aux croisés, il ne peut s'emparer du krak des Chevaliers. À sa mort, en 1193, l'unité des musulmans se fragmente et le danger se fait moindre pour la forteresse qui entre alors dans son âge d'or, couvrant une surface totale de 2,5 hectares protégée par deux enceintes concentriques entièrement indépendantes. Le krak héberge une garnison de 2 000 hommes et posséde des vivres pour cinq ans.\n\nLa chute du krak\nAu début du XIIIe siècle, plusieurs attaques sont repoussées (1207, 1218) et, en 1223, la forteresse sert de point de rassemblement à une armée franque réunie pour attaquer Hama. D'autres attaques ont encore lieu, toutes aussi stériles que les précédentes.\nVers la seconde moitié du XIIIe siècle, cependant, l'essoufflement du mouvement croisé avait réduit la garnison à moins de trois-cents hommes, la citadelle étant tenue par l'ordre militaire des Hospitaliers et, avec l'arrivée au pouvoir de Baybars, sultan des Mamelouks, les territoires sur lesquels le krak levait traditionnellement tribut étaient passés en mains ennemies. Ce n'était désormais plus qu'une question de temps avant que Baybars lui-même ne vienne attaquer la forteresse, ce qu'il fit en 1271. La première enceinte céda, la création de brèches dans certaines tours ainsi que la chute de la première enceinte, les défenseurs se replièrent dans le haut château, mais le sultan ne put malgré tout s'emparer du krak que par la ruse : il envoya une fausse missive, émanant prétendument du grand maître des Templiers, enjoignant aux assiégés de se rendre. Ceux-ci négocièrent leur vie contre la promesse de retourner dans leur pays d'origine et, le 8 avril, la citadelle changea de mains\n\nListe des dignitaires Hospitaliers\nListe des dignitaires Hospitaliers :\n\nChâtelains\nJean de Anio.

Les invasions timourides de Tamerlan (1400-1401) et celles des Ottomans en 1516 ignorèrent même le site. Par la suite, le fort fut connu sous le nom de Qalaʿat al-Hosn.\nLe château servit ensuite de résidence à un gouverneur et, en 1859, l'expédition de Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey le trouva en excellent état. En 1920, le krak passa sous contrôle du mandat français et, afin de permettre la restauration du site, un village qui s'était installé dans ses murs fut reconstruit sur un emplacement qu'il occupe encore aujourd'hui. Les faibles finances des conservateurs des Beaux-Arts ne permettant qu'une seule restauration — il avait fallu racheter les murs aux villageois — celle-ci dut se faire au détriment d'autres sites tout aussi remarquables mais moins connus. Les forteresses de Margat et de Saladin (également appelé « château de Saône ») firent les frais de ce choix.\nLe krak passa finalement sous le contrôle de la Syrie lors de l'adhésion de cette dernière à l'ONU et est aujourd'hui un site touristique. Cependant, contrairement aux châteaux forts islamiques, la Syrie ne l'a guère entretenu depuis cinquante ans et il se trouve chaque année dans un état de dégradation plus avancé.\nLors de la Guerre civile syrienne, il semble que le krak serve de retranchement aux opposants au régime et qu'il ait subi des bombardements durant l'été 2012.\nLe 13 juillet 2013, la citadelle du krak des Chevaliers est touchée par des bombardements de l'armée de Bachar el-Assad. Plusieurs vidéos, diffusées via les réseaux sociaux depuis le 13 juillet, montrent qu'il y a au moins une frappe qui a touché la citadelle, provoquée par le raid aérien lancé par un MiG selon le militant qui filme la scène. Le 20 mars 2014, le château, jusque-là tenu par la rébellion est repris par les forces gouvernementales.\n\nArchitecture\nCe majestueux krak des Chevaliers est devenu en un siècle de construction l'un des exemples d'architecture militaire défensive les plus aboutis de son époque et même du Moyen Âge.\nUne utilisation intelligente de la topographie et d'éléments d'architecture empruntés aux cultures européenne, byzantine et arabe ont rendu cette place imprenable pour peu qu'elle soit défendue par une garnison suffisante (Baybars utilisa la ruse plutôt que la force car il savait cette stratégie vouée à l'échec alors que le krak n'était plus défendu que par trois-cents hommes).\nLa protection de son système d'entrée était révolutionnaire : un long corridor, débouchant dans la salle d'armes de l'enceinte extérieure, entrecoupé de « sas », avec une voûte percée de nombreux assommoirs - pour accabler les assaillants sous les projectiles (pierres, sable fondu…).\nCe corridor est équipé (en entrée et sortie) de lourdes portes en bois (avec un système de poulies), permettant de bloquer les attaquants qui auraient réussi à survivre assez longtemps pour parvenir jusque-là…\n\nTerrain\nLa forteresse, dominant les alentours, est construite sur une colline de 750 mètres de haut aux flancs abrupts, ce qui rend la poliorcétique de l'époque inefficace.\nEn outre, de gros travaux de terrassement ont encore renforcé cet avantage naturel dont des grands talus de vingt-deux mètres à la base des courtines afin d'empêcher la sape.\n\nConstruction\nXIIe siècle\nÀ la suite des tremblements de terre de 1157 et 1170, le krak est quasiment détruit et entièrement reconstruit. On ne sait rien ou presque de son plan avant ces destructions. Les travaux engagés à partir de 1170 forment le noyau central de la forteresse actuelle. C'est en fait une grande galerie triangulaire de 270 m de long et de près de neuf mètres de large où vivaient les frères hospitaliers. Conçue comme une caserne fortifiée, cette galerie est voûtée en croisée d'ogive et est d'abord flanquée de cinq tours carrées. Une chapelle fut construite dès 1170 dans la tour nord-est, puis remplacée au même endroit par une chapelle plus grande dès 1180. Cette chapelle a une voûte en berceau et présente sur les côtés une série d'arcatures aveugles à l'image de l'architecture religieuse de l'Europe méditerranéenne à la même époque (Languedoc et Provence) et est caractéristique des chapelles édifiées en Terre Sainte par les croisés.\nToute la cour centrale de l'édifice repose sur un vaste grenier voûté qui pouvait contenir, d'après des auteurs contemporains, jusqu'à cinq ans de vivres et de fourrage. L'eau de boisson nécessaire à tenir un tel siège était drainée depuis les terrasses au sommet des tours et stockée dans des réservoirs.\nUne sixième tour, « la tour des latrines », sera construite au nord-ouest de la forteresse vers 1190. Elle abrite douze latrines et communique avec le dortoir des frères et permet de garder des conditions sanitaires satisfaisantes même en cas de siège prolongé. En outre, elle commande une poterne dissimulée sur sa face nord-est qui permet aux assiégés de tenter des sorties pour prendre l'ennemi à revers par surprise.\nLa construction d'un second mur d'enceinte débute au nord dans les dernières années du siècle.\n\nXIIIe siècle\nEn 1202, après un nouveau tremblement de terre, d'autres travaux sont engagés qui renforcent considérablement le krak autant contre les attaques que contre les séismes. Ainsi, un « glacis » est construit sur les flancs sud et ouest de la forteresse. Il s'agit d'un appareillage de pierres de taille en pente forte qui s'appuie sur la muraille et l'« encoquille ». Ce glacis remplit deux fonctions distinctes : d'abord, il renforce le mur intérieur contre les séismes qui ont déjà ravagé plusieurs fois le krak ; ensuite, il abrite une galerie percée d'archères, ce qui augmente encore la puissance de feu de la place forte.\nDans le même temps, le flanc sud est considérablement modifié. Les tours carrées sont remplacées par deux tours rondes et une troisième en fer à cheval est construite au milieu de la muraille. Elle constitue un renfort défensif sur le flanc sud particulièrement exposé aux attaques. Un niveau est ajouté à la galerie primitive. La tour au milieu du flanc ouest est aussi modifiée et s'arrondit.\nLa cour intérieure est également remaniée et un bâtiment s'adosse maintenant au flanc est.\nEn 1250, saint Louis s'installe en Orient et prend la tête des Francs. Il amène avec lui des architectes qui aideront les croisés à défendre leurs places fortes. Un nouveau rempart est alors construit, probablement sur les conseils de ces architectes. Ce rempart mesure neuf mètres de haut, est placé à une distance de dix-sept à vingt-cinq mètres de la forteresse centrale et est défendu par douze tours rondes à la manière des standards de l'architecture militaire européenne de l'époque, ce qui rend les projectiles moins efficaces, ces tours ne présentant pas d'angles saillants plus fragiles. Le second mur est placé en contrebas du noyau central, ce qui permet aux défenseurs de tirer sur les attaquants depuis les deux positions.\nCe mur possède une seule porte à l'est qui débouche à l'intérieur sur une rampe étroite menant après des virages serrés à l'entrée de la muraille intérieure. Cette rampe rend la progression des assaillants difficile, et empêche l'utilisation d'un bélier contre la porte des fortifications centrales.\nUn cloître est aussi bâti probablement à la même époque. S'adossant au bâtiment de la cour centrale, il prend pour modèle les cloîtres d'Île-de-France, ce qui semble indiquer qu'il fut construit en l'honneur de Saint Louis, ou tout du moins par ses architectes.\nDes écuries sont également construites contre le flanc sud de la muraille extérieure.\n\nXXIe siècle\nEn 2012, les insurgés syriens s'emparent du krak ; l’armée syrienne parvient à reconquérir la place forte. L'intérieur du château a souffert et porte la marque des combats qui ont précédé cette reconquête, malgré l'attention de l'armée syrienne à limiter les dommages à l'extérieur de l'édifice.\nEn 2013, alors que les combats font rage en Syrie, le krak des Chevaliers est inscrit par l’Unesco sur sa liste du patrimoine mondial en péril. Les combats entraînent des dommages, notamment dans l’église et la grande salle, célèbre pour ses colonnettes et ses voûtes inspirées par l’architecture gothique. \nÀ la suite de sa reprise définitive par l'armée syrienne en 2014, un important programme de restauration est lancé par le gouvernement syrien. En 2016, la citadelle bénéficie de l’aide d’archéologues hongrois pour restaurer le clocher de l’église. En 2018, celle-ci rouvre ses portes fermées depuis 2012. En novembre 2020, plus de quatre-cents étudiants d'une université locale participent à un chantier de restauration et de défrichage du site du château afin de le protéger des feux de forêt qui ont ravagé le centre et le nord-ouest de la Syrie l'été précédent.\n\nRôle stratégique\nLe krak jouera un rôle essentiel dans la stratégie défensive des Francs en terre sainte. Le roi de Hongrie André II le définit comme étant « la clef des terres chrétiennes », tandis que le chroniqueur Ibn al-Athîr l'appelait « l'os en travers de la gorge des musulmans ». Cette importance stratégique est due à deux facteurs principaux : sa position géographique et son imprenabilité supposée et avérée, tant il est vrai qu'il ne fut jamais repris par la force après avoir été réduit par les croisés en 1109 puis rendu quasiment invulnérable par les travaux ultérieurs.\n\nDéfense des États latins\nLe krak est un nœud principal dans le maillage de forteresses qui assurent la défense et la domination des territoires francs. Du haut de ses tours, on aperçoit les places fortes de Chastel Blanc à l'est et de la forteresse de Gibelacar au sud. Des feux d'alarme pouvaient être allumés et prévenir de proche en proche en cas d'attaque toutes les forteresses du comté de Tripoli.\nUn autre avantage de la position géographique du krak est paradoxalement qu'il n'est pas situé sur une route principale, ce qui rend plus difficile une attaque de grande envergure. Fort de sa victoire à Hattin, et disposant d'une armée de près de 40 000 hommes, Saladin, lors de sa remontée vers le nord, décida de ne pas attaquer le krak car il savait l'entreprise hasardeuse. Les hospitaliers organisèrent ensuite de nombreux raids sur les convois d'approvisionnement de l'arrière-garde ce qui gêna considérablement la suite de la reconquête musulmane.\n\nUne base arrière lors des conquêtes croisées\nDe par sa localisation géographique à la frontière entre les royaumes croisés et les terres musulmanes, sa puissance défensive et sa taille (il a pu accueillir jusqu'à 2 000 cavaliers en armes) le krak est une base idéale pour mener des attaques et des raids contre les villes et les forces musulmanes. Ainsi, en 1230, l'émir de Homs refusant de payer son tribut au comte de Tripoli, Templiers et Hospitaliers rassemblent au krak une armée de trois-cents cavaliers et 2 700 piétons puis lancent une série de raids et de pillages qui ravageront les terres autour de Homs jusqu'à ce que l'émir cède. Ces raids sont destructeurs et leur rapidité les rend imparables, le krak servant de point de repli une fois le pillage effectué.\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nRéférences\nBibliographie\nPar ordre chronologique de parution :\n\nGuillaume Rey, Études sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'île de Chypre, Imprimerie nationale, Paris, 1871 [lire en ligne] ;\nPaul Deschamps, Les châteaux des croisés en Terre Sainte.

      "content": "## Overview\nKrak des Chevaliers (also \"Crac des Chevaliers\" - 'Castle of the Knights') located near Homs in Syria is widely recognised as the archetypal Crusader castle. Described by T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia) as \"perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world\", this somewhat isolated site is located magnificently (750 m or 2,300 ft above sea level) and is, indeed, extremely well-preserved. Today it represents one of the premier tourist attractions in central Syria and is one of the country's world heritage sites. The castle sustained some damage during the Syrian Civil War.\n\n## Understand\nKrak des Chevaliers was the easternmost of five Crusader fortifications guarding the only major pass (known as the 'Homs Gap' in the Orontes river Valley) between Antakya in Turkey and Beirut in the Lebanon. The castle was built and expanded at Qal'at al-Hisn by the Order of the Knights of St John in the years between 1142 and 1271. It covers 3 hectares in area and, at the height of its powers, it housed a garrison of up to 2000 men. The castle held out against several fierce attacks (including one by the famous Saladin), and was rumoured to be impregnable. The Krak, however, was eventually lost by the naive crusaders to the Mamluk Sultan Baybars in 1271, who tricked the defenders into abandoning the castle by means of a faked letter from the Crusader Count of Tripoli.\nThe castle has two main parts: an outer wall with 13 towers and an inner wall and keep. The two walls are separated by a moat (now full of stagnant water), which was used to fill the baths and water the horses. Walk through the main entrance, an imposing gate in the 5m (16ft) thick wall and past the towers which defended the castle, and you enter a courtyard. A corridor covered in delicate carvings leads to a large vaulted hall, where you can see an old oven, a well and some latrines. The chapel in the courtyard was converted to a mosque after Sultan Baybars captured the castle - it still retains its pulpit (mihrab). The top floor of the Tower of the Daughter of the King is now a café with great views.\n\n## Get in\nKrak des Chevaliers is an easy day trip from Tartus or Hama, the latter city being the most attractive base from which to visit, if somewhat more distant (one-way microbus trip just under 2 hours). Buses also run from Homs and will drop visitors off at the castle. Bus fares are less than US$1 and the trip takes less than an hour each way. A taxi from Damascus cost around US$60 round trip also including the driver waiting outside, depending on your bargaining skills. Some hotels in Damascus offer bus trips to the castle, but it constitutes a very long day out for the one site.\nOn the whole, it's best to arrive early as by mid-late morning the castle can be almost submerged in hordes of tourists from Damascus. Sunrise is also a great time to enjoy the view of the castle in a magnificent light. Ditto sunset.\n\n## See\n34.75685836.2947131 Krak des Chevaliers (حصن الفرسان).
