      "content": "Masyaf (Arabic: مصياف Miṣyāf) is a city in northwestern Syria. It is the center of the Masyaf District in the Hama Governorate. As of 2004, Masyaf had a religiously diverse population of approximately 22,000 Ismailis, Alawites and Christians. The city is well known for its large medieval castle, particularly its role as the headquarters of the Nizari Ismailis and their elite Assassins unit.\n\nEtymology\nThroughout the Islamic era and until the modern day, the Arabic name of the city was pronounced in a number of different ways by the inhabitants of the region as Maṣyaf, Maṣyat or Maṣyad. The Arabic name is a local pronunciation that evolved from the Assyrian name Manṣuate. The \"nṣw\" in Manṣuate correlates with the Arabic \"nṣṣ\", which means \"to set up\", according to orientalist scholar Edward Lipinsky. Moreover, Lipinsky suggests that the Assyrian name was likely a configuration of the Assyrian word manṣuwatu which correlates with the Arabic word minaṣṣatu(n), both of which translate as \"raised platform\". This translation is indicative of the promontory that the Masyaf fortress occupies which overlooks the rest of the city and the surrounding area.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nMasyaf is the most probable site of the ancient Aramean city of Mansuate that existed in the 8th century BC. It later served as the administrative center of an Assyrian province by the same name in modern-day central Syria. Masyaf is also likely the site of Marsyas. Roman and Byzantine historians mentioned a city named \"Marsyas\" that governed the al-Ghab and Beqaa plains to the north and south of the site, respectively.\nMasyaf and its fortress were first mentioned by Crusader chroniclers in 1099. However, because a fortification at Masyaf likely existed prior to the 11th century, it is probable that the Aleppo-based Hamdanid dynasty built a fort at Masyaf, due to its position as an outpost overlooking the mountain roads. At that time, the fortress was a part of Jund Qinnasrin (Chalcis Province) of the Fatimid Caliphate. In the autumn of 999, Basil II, the Byzantine emperor, destroyed the fortifications at Masyaf as part of his campaign to gain control of Antioch and its environs from the Muslims.\nThe area would later come under Seljuk rule, but in 1099, the Crusaders attempted to wrest control of Masyaf (and the more strategically important Rafania) following their capture of Tripoli. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin, launched a military campaign to prevent the loss of the area and reached a short-lived accommodation with the Crusaders whereby Masyaf and Hisn al-Akrad would remain in Muslim hands, but have to pay tribute to the Crusaders. Sometime later, Masyaf was controlled by the Mirdasid dynasty. In 1127, the Mirdasids sold it to the Shaizar-based Banu Munqidh family.\n\nNizari Ismaili era\nIn 1140, Masyaf was captured by the Nizari Ismailis, a sect of Ismaili branch of Shia. The fortress was being defended by a Banu Munqidh mamluk (slave warrior) named Sunqur, who the Ismaili force managed to ambush and kill. The Ismailis had chosen Syria as their new home and successively settled in the cities of Aleppo and Damascus and the fortress of Banias, each time being persecuted and massacred by the authorities or mobs of local residents incited by clerics who accused the Ismailis of being heretics or causing problems. Consequently, the surviving Ismaili leadership decided that establishing bases in Syria's cities and thus relying on the goodwill of various umara (princes) was untenable. Instead, they chose to settle in Jabal Ansariyah, a coastal mountain range dotted with fortresses, including Masyaf.\n\nFollowing its capture, Masyaf served as the principal fortress for the Ismailis' chief da'i. Together with other fortresses acquired at around the same time, including al-Kahf, Khawabi, al-Qadmus and al-Rusafa, the Ismailis were able to carve an autonomous territory for themselves amid hostile Crusader states and local Muslim dynasties nominally affiliated with the Abbasid Caliphate. Masyaf served as the headquarters of the Ismaili da'i Rashid ad-Din Sinan and his elite unit of fida'i who were known as the Assassins.\nIn the mid-1170s, the Ayyubid sultan Saladin set about conquering Syria, ousting the Crusaders and uniting the Muslim world under Sunni Islam. The Ismailis considered Saladin a more dangerous threat than the Crusaders and allied with Saladin's rival in Aleppo to defeat the Ayyubids. Sinan's men launched two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Saladin and in 1176, Saladin launched a punitive expedition against the Assassins in the strongly-defended fortress of Masyaf. Within a few days of the siege, Saladin withdrew due to an urgent need to redeploy against the Crusaders who were attacking Ayyubid territory in the Beqaa. He arranged a truce with Sinan mediated by the Ayyubid emir of Hama, Shihab al-Din Mahmud al-Harimi, Saladin's uncle.\n\nMamluk rule\nA wall around the town of Masyaf was built in 1249 by the Persian leader of the Ismailis, Taj al-Din Abu'l Futuh. In 1260, the Mongols under Hulagu conquered most of northern Syria and briefly occupied Masyaf. However, following the Mongols' rout at the Battle of Ain Jalut at the hand of the Bahri Mamluks later that year, they withdrew from Masyaf and it once again fell under Ismaili control.\nIn 1262, Masyaf's rulers were ordered to pay tribute to the Mamluk sultan Baibars and some time after, the sultan had Masyaf's emir Najm al-Din Ismail replaced by Sarim al-Din Mubarak. Mubarak was later imprisoned in Cairo by Baibars and Najm ad-Din was briefly restored as emir before Masyaf was fully incorporated into the sultanate in 1270. Ismailis continued inhabiting it throughout Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the century, Masyaf became a major stopping point on the Mamluk postal route and was controlled by a commander who answered directly to the sultan due to its strategic role as a frontier fortress.\nIn 1320, the historian and Ayyubid emir of Hama, Abu'l Fida, noted that Masyaf was a \"center of the Ismailian Doctrine\" and that it was \"beautiful\" with gardens and a spring from which flowed a small stream. According to Ibn Battuta, who passed by the town in 1355, Masyaf was the center of a district belonging to the province of Tripoli and containing the fortress villages of al-Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, al-Ulayqa and al-Maniqa. Masyaf was later separated from Tripoli and transferred to the authority of Damascus province. In the mid-15th century, under Sultan Barsbay, a road was built that connected Masyaf with Tripoli, but the postal route no longer passed through the town. In 1446, the historian Khalil al-Zahiri described Masyaf as \"a pleasant town, with an extensive countryside\".\n\nOttoman era\nMasyaf, along with the rest of Syria, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1516–17 following the Ottoman victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Masyaf became a part of the liwa (district) of Homs, and along with the other Ismaili fortresses in its vicinity (qala' al-da'wa), was responsible for paying a special tax. The town had a khan (caravanserai) which paid tolls to the Ottoman authorities. The tolls were abolished later in the mid-16th century. According to the Sufi traveler Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, the emir of Masyaf in the early 1690s was a descendant of the Arab Tanukh tribe named Sulayman.\nIn 1703, the Raslan clan, an Alawite tribe, took over Masyaf and controlled it for about eight years until it was restored to the Ismailis following the intervention of the Ottoman authorities. During this period, the majority of Masyaf's Ismaili inhabitants followed the Nizari sect although there was a small Tayyibi minority too. In 1788, the emir of Masyaf, Mustafa ibn Idris, built a sabil (ablutions fountain) and a house that would be used by himself and successive Ismaili emirs.\nIn 1808, the Raslan clan led by Sheikh Mahmud Raslan attacked Masyaf, killing its Ismaili chief, Mustafa Milhim, and his son, and captured the fortress. About 300 of the town's Ismaili inhabitants were also killed, while many others, including the da'i (religious chief) of Masyaf, fled for Homs, Hama and other areas in central Syria, settling in those places temporarily. The Ismailis had already been in the process of being gradually expelled from Jabal Ansariyah by Alawite clans. The Ottoman governor of Damascus, Kunj Yusuf Pasha, intervened in the matter, dispatching a force of 4,000–5,000 soldiers to recapture the town. After three months of fighting, the Raslans surrendered Masyaf. Ismaili control over the town and its fortress was restored in 1810.\nTwo years after the resettlement of Masyaf by the Ismailis, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt recorded an estimated population of 280 families, most of which were Ismaili and 30 were Christian. Burchardt noted that the town's citadel, many houses, the mosque and most other buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed from previous fighting. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Masyaf's population continued to decrease.\n\nModern era\nThe Allied Powers captured Syria from the Ottomans in 1917, after which the residents largely abandoned the fortress of Masyaf. British general T. E. Lawrence rested in Masyaf and remarked that the fortress was being used as a poorhouse at the time. During the French Mandate over Syria, the French separated the Jabal Ansariyah range from the rest of Syria to form the Alawite State. Masyaf was made a part of the State of Damascus, but in 1929, a number of rural Alawite villages in its immediate vicinity, including al-Rusafa, al-Bayyadiyah, Akakir, Maryamin and Abu Qubays, were ceded to the Alawite State. The latter merged with the rest of Syria in 1936. In 1939, Masyaf and its district was transferred from the Province of Hama to the Province of Latakia. Throughout the 1930s, rooms in the fortress were still being used by local residents.\nIn 1947, a year after Syria became independent from France, 3,808 Ismailis were recorded to be living in Masyaf. The Syrian government under President Amin al-Hafiz established Masyaf as a center for carpet weaving in 1965. The weaving workshops mostly employed women. In the 1960s, Masyaf's Ismaili community largely identified with the Nasserist movement, in contrast to the Alawites who dominated the surrounding villages who were mostly associated with the Baathists.\nIn 1970, much of the town of Masyaf still remained within the confines of the city walls. However, by 1998, its population and urban space had expanded considerably outside the walls. The fortress is situated in the northeastern part of Masyaf's old city. The walls remained in place, but the homes and gardens of local residents were built immediately alongside them. Within the walls is a mosque dating to the 12th century and according to local residents, is associated with Saladin. The fortress is considered a national monument and is directly under the authority of the Syrian Directorate of Antiquities.\nIn the Syrian Civil War after 2015, an alleged missile production facility in Masyaf and a base near the town, thought to be used by Iranian forces and militias, became repeatedly targets of airstrikes attributed to Israel.\nOn 8 September 2024, Israel launched a series of airstrikes as well as a ground raid by the Shaldag unit, targeting an underground precision missile factory reportedly built by Iran.\n\nGeography\nMasyaf is situated along the foothills of the eastern slopes of the Jabal Ansariyah coastal mountain range. The average elevation of Masyaf is 485 meters. It is just west of the al-Ghab Plain. The area is marked by gardens, orchards and fields of wheat and barley which are cultivated by local residents. To the north and south of Masyaf flow seasonal streams which feed into a tributary of the Orontes River, called al-Sarout.\nThe city of Hama is 45 kilometers to the east and Baniyas is 54 kilometers to the west. Hama is connected to the town via a road north of Masyaf which passes through al-Laqbah and Deir Shamil. Nearby villages include al-Rusafa to the southeast, al-Bayda to the south, al-Suwaydah to the southwest, Rabu to the west, Biqraqa to the northwest, Hurayf and Hayalin to the north, Zaynah to the northeast and al-Shiha to the east.\n\nClimate\nMasyaf has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is much more rainfall in Masyaf than in summer. The average annual temperature in Masyaf is 17.6 °C (63.7 °F). About 1,049 mm (41.30 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Masyaf had a population of 22,508 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the Masyaf District and the Masyaf Subdistrict. The latter had a population of 68,184 in 2004. In the mid-1940s, its inhabitants were predominantly Ismailis. Today, it is a religiously mixed city of Ismailis and Alawites, with a Christian minority.\n\nIn popular culture\nMasyaf is featured as the base of operations of the Assassin Order during the Third Crusade in the Assassin's Creed games series (mainly in Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). The village appears built on a rock, with the Masyaf fortress at the top.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Masyaf at Wikimedia Commons",

Elle est le chef-lieu du district de Masyaf. La ville et sa forteresse se trouvent sur le flanc est du massif côtier appelé Jabal Ansariya. Vers le Xe siècle, les Nusayrîs (appelés aussi Alaouites) infiltrent la région, qui reste actuellement leur fief.\n\nHistoire\nLe château de Masyaf a été construit pendant la période de domination byzantine. Sa situation en fait le point de contrôle de la route est-ouest entre Hama et Baniyas et la route nord-sud d’Antioche à Homs (Émese). La forteresse s'élève sur un éperon rocheux qui domine de 20 m la dépression fertile d’al-Ghâb irriguée par l’Oronte.\nRaymond de Saint-Gilles, marchant sur Tripoli, la prend en 1103. Rachid ad-Din Sinan et les Nizârites venus d’Alamut se sont installés dans la région où ils ont acheté le château de Qadmus (La Cademois des croisés) puis celui d’Al-Kahf en 1134. À partir de là et jusqu’en 1140, la secte réalise un programme d'acquisition rapide de huit châteaux dont Masyaf. La ville devient ainsi la capitale d’une principauté que les croisés appellent les « Territoires des assassins ».\nEn 1157, un tremblement de terre frappe la région détruisant la forteresse de Chayzar.\nEn 1163, Rachid ad-Din Sinan prend la direction de la secte. Il fait de Masyaf sa résidence et reprend pour lui le titre de « vieux de la Montagne ».\n\nLes relations entre Chrétiens, Nizârites et Sunnites se compliquent du fait d'alliances tactiques et de collusions, entremêlées de périodes de paix. En mai 1176, Saladin assiège Masyaf, mais renonce rapidement pour continuer ses campagnes dans le nord de la Syrie, après avoir conclu un accord dont on ne connaît pas le contenu.En 1192, Saladin parvient à convaincre le roi Richard Ier d'Angleterre dit Cœur de Lion de préserver le territoire des assassins. Bien plus, les Chrétiens, les Musulmans Sunnites ou Ismaéliens procèdent à des échanges commerciaux très lucratifs.\nEn 1193, Saladin meurt en mars et Rachid ad-Din Sinan, en septembre. Les Nizârites perdent ainsi un adversaire mais aussi leur chef le plus marquant.\n\nEn 1256, la forteresse d’Alamut se rend sans combat à l'armée mongole d'Houlagou Khan qui déferlait sur l'Iran. Elle est entièrement rasée. C'est la fin des Nizârites en Perse.\nMasyaf est à son tour assiégée et prise par les Mongols en 1260. La même année le mamelouk Baybars prend le pouvoir en Égypte. À la fin de l’année, après la bataille d’Aïn Djalout à laquelle les Nizârites participent à ses côtés, Baybars reprend Masyaf aux Mongols. Les Nizârites récupèrent ainsi quatre forteresses perdues devant les Mongols. Finalement Baybars incorpore Masyaf à l’État mamelouk en 1270. La dernière place forte nizârite est la forteresse voisine d’Al-Kahf qui tombe aux mains de Baybars en 1273. Les Nizârites n’ont plus de place forte, l’influence des Alaouites ou Nusayrîs s’accroît dans la région.\nEn 1516, Masyaf passe sous l’autorité ottomane (en 1830-1841 d'Égypte). Au XIXe siècle, Nizârites et Alaouites continuent de se disputer la suprématie à Masyaf.\nEn 1920, pendant le mandat français, la domination des Alaouites est consacrée par la création du « territoire autonome des Alaouites ». En 1922, ce territoire devient l'État Alaouite, puis en 1930 \"Territoire ou Gouvernement de Lattaquié\".\nEn 2000, le programme d’aide aux villes historiques (Historic Cities Support Program) (HCSP) de l’Aga Khan a commencé une campagne de préservation de la ville et de la citadelle de Masyaf.\n\nLe site\nLe château lui-même a conservé une grande partie de son enceinte extérieure. Il occupe un éperon rocheux d'une dizaine de mètres de largeur. Il est entouré d'une courtine en assez petit appareil dans laquelle est englobé un donjon rectangulaire, qui domine l'ensemble. La construction offre des éléments hétérogènes réemployés, des colonnes gréco-romaines et byzantines notamment. Ces indices laissent supposer que le site était occupé antérieurement. La partie la mieux conservée est l'entrée surmontée de mâchicoulis et d'un chemin de ronde à meurtrières.\n\nCulture populaire\nEn novembre 2007, la citadelle apparaît dans le jeu vidéo Assassin's Creed et dans une suite quatre ans plus tard, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, ce qui la rendra célèbre.\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nRéférences\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nAlamut\nIsmaélisme\nNizârites/Assassins\nHassan ibn al-Sabbah\nNusayrites/Alaouites\nVieux de la Montagne\nAssassin's Creed\n\nLiens externes\n(en) « Castle of Masyaf »(Archive.org • Wikiwix • Archive.is • Google • Que faire ?), sur iis.ac.uk, The Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2008\n(en) Anthony Campbell, « The Assassins of Alamut », 2004\n(ar) « Masyaf »\n\nBibliographie\nJanine Sourdel et Dominique Sourdel, Dictionnaire historique de l'islam, PUF, coll. « Quadrige », 2004, 1056 p.
