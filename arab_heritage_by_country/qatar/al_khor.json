      "content": "Al Khor (Arabic: الخور; also spelled Al Khawr), officially Al Khor and Al Thakhira, is a municipality in northeastern Qatar. Al Khor City, the municipal seat, is located on the northeast coast of Qatar, around 50 kilometres (31 miles) from the capital, Doha and is considered to be one of Qatar's major cities. Al Thakhira is the second most significant settlement in the municipality after Al Khor City.\nThe region was ruled by the Al Muhannadi tribe, which consists of seven Bedouin families, before Qatar gained its independence in 1971. Tourism has been increasing in recent years owing to the municipality's various resorts, natural areas and cultural attractions. Fishing was the historical mainstay of most of the municipality's inhabitants.\n\nEtymology\nAl Khor Municipality derives its name from the city of the same name. In Arabic, Al Khawr means \"bay\"; it was so named because Al Khor City was near a bay. Formerly, the city was known as \"Khor Al-Shaqiq\".\n\nHistory\nAl Khor Municipality was established in July 1972, alongside Qatar's four other initial municipalities, and supervises the city of Al Khor in addition to other settlements in the municipality. As of 2017, Ibrahim Issa Nasser Al Fadalah was the mayor of the municipality.\n\nMunicipal seat\nAl Khor City, the municipal seat, is a coastal city located 57 kilometres (35 miles) north of the capital Doha. In the past, it was well known for the role it played in Qatar's bustling pearling industry, as well as for its harbour which is filled with fishing boats and small crafts. Several beaches, renovated forts and cultural attractions are found in the city.\n\nGeography\nAl Khor is situated in northern Qatar, bordered by the municipalities of Al Shamal to the north, Al Daayen and Umm Salal to the southeast, and Al-Shahaniya to the southwest. In addition to the main municipal headquarters in Al Khor City, there are Ministry of Municipality and Environment branches in Al Thakhira and Al Ghuwariyah.\nMuch of Al Khor's territory lies along the Qatari Peninsula's eastern coast, including the eastern boundaries of the municipality's two main cities – Al Khor City and Al Thakhira. Numerous beaches are located in this area, including Al-Farka Beach in Al Khor City and Al Thakhira Beach. A seafront promenade stretched over a 28,000-square-metre (300,000 sq ft) area known as Al Khor Corniche runs through the municipal seat.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the municipality accommodates 170 rawdas, 49 wadis, 57 jeris (places where water flows), seven jeryan (multiple jeris), seven plains, 22 hills, five highlands, 13 sabkhas, 17 capes, four bays, and three coral reefs. Four islands are found off its shores, the most important of which is Al Khor Island (also known as Jazirat Bin Ghanim).\nWhite mangrove forests in Qatar can be found in greatest abundance near Al Khor and Al Thakhira. This species of mangroves is well-adapted to the saline conditions of the northeast coast. At least eight mangrove sites exist in Qatar, and all are protected areas as of a 2006 Emiri decree.\n\nClimate\nThe following is climate data for the municipal seat, Al Khor.\n\nAdministration\nThe municipality is divided into 3 zones which are then divided into 454 blocks. Two of its main districts, Simaisma and Al Jeryan, are geographically located in Al Daayen.

At present, Ras Laffan accommodates the world's largest GTL plant, the Pearl GTL which was constructed as by a partnership between Royal Dutch Shell and QatarEnergy. Qatar is also the world's second largest supplier of helium, which can be extracted from natural gas. All of the country's helium is produced by Qatargas' two helium plants in Ras Laffan, which were commissioned in 2005 and 2013, respectively. In June 2017, amidst the Qatar diplomatic crisis, the government ordered the two plants to be shut down indefinitely.\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural activities such as fishing and pearling were traditional mainstays of the inhabitants of this region.

This project is based on a two-million square meter plot owned by Baladna in the Umm Al Hawaya locality of the municipality.\nOne of the most important agricultural research stations in Qatar is located in Rawdat Al Faras. The research station, established in 1976, consists of a laboratory, a warehouse and five palm tree fields hosting thousands of palm trees.\nCapitalizing on the municipality's rich maritime tradition, the 101,000-square-metre (1,090,000 sq ft) facility of the Aquatic Fisheries and Research Centre was completed in Ras Matbakh by Ashghal in 2017 at a cost of QR 237.7 million.\nThree major government-owned plant nurseries are located in Al Khor; two are in the village of Al Rashida, and one is in Rawdat Bakheela.
