          "content": "Souq Waqif (Arabic: سوق واقف, romanized: Sūq Wāqif, lit. 'the standing market') is a marketplace (souq) in Doha, the capital of Qatar. The souq sells traditional garments, spices, handicrafts, and souvenirs. It is also home to restaurants and shisha lounges. The original building is an example of traditional Qatari architecture and dates back to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. It was renovated in 2006.\n\nLocation\nIt is located in the district of Al Souq, which is situated in the centre of Doha. As it was a market used for trading activities, the area used to be located immediately on the shore to allow for boats to access it from Doha Bay. Souq Waqif's position relative to the bay was significantly altered throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s due to land reclamation for the Doha Corniche, which shifted the coastline approximately 335 metres (1,099 ft) northward.\nAs of the 2020s, the area between the souq and the coast comprises a northern expansion of the market itself, Abdullah Bin Jassim Street, and Souq Waqif Park. The current distance from the northern edge of Souq Waqif to the coast is about 215 metres (705 ft). This space encompasses two major roadways: Abdullah Bin Jassim Street, a 20 metres (66 ft) wide four-lane road with a 40 km/h speed limit, and Al Corniche Road, a 35 metres (115 ft) wide eight-lane thoroughfare with an 80 km/h limit. These roads account for over 25% of the distance between the souq and the coast. While the physical distance is relatively short, pedestrian access is complicated by traffic infrastructure.\n\nHistory\nThe souq was founded at least a century ago in proximity to the dry river bed known as Wadi Musheireb. The name \"Souq Waqif\" stems from the fact that traders used to set up shop at the gates to show off their wares. It was a gathering place where Bedouins and locals would trade a variety of goods, primarily livestock goods. \nHowever, with the boom in prosperity in the 1990s, the souq fell into decline and in 2003, most of it was destroyed in a fire. This event initiated a restoration program by the government in 2006, with the purpose of preserving its architectural and historical identity. The first phase of restoration was funded by the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Buildings constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008. Traditional heating methods are employed by utilizing wood and bamboo imported from various areas of Asia.\n\nTourism and attractions\nThe Souq is a major tourist attraction in Doha.\nA yearly spring festival around April hosts many theatricals, acrobatics and musical performances. An event featuring WWE wrestlers, called Souq Waqif Storm, attracted the most spectators. There was discussion over the possibility of a repeat festival.\nA sharp spike in tourism took place in Souq Waqif during football events such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 Asian Cup. During the Asian Cup, Souq Waqif attracted many individuals from different backgrounds and nationalities, where they gathered with their countries flag and sang chants to show their support. The World Cup saw approximately double the number of visitors, with fans representing their country by bringing billboards and structures. During these events the number of tourists increased significantly, as it was the prime gathering place of fans, with celebrations running late into the night.\n\nShops\nThe Souq has the first hotel that opened in Qatar named Bismillah, which was opened in the early 1900s, by a wealthy businessman named Abdullah Al Thani. Both of the historic buildings are very large and fancy. They have tiled balconies where you can watch people in the Souq. These apartments' kitchenettes and living rooms are in the modern Arabesque style.\nAlongside the boutique hotel, there are may shops around the Souq. There is a section for women, where we see them selling traditional women clothing, and they also sell perfumes and different strong Arabic smells, and jewellery shops where they sell Gold. Other than the women section the Souq has shops for men clothing, souvenirs, small supermarkets, and many family owned shops that sell traditional Qatari souvenirs. There is also many different restaurants that serve different cuisine, mostly Qatari and Middle Eastern.\n\nPet area\nThere are pet stalls in Souq Waqif which sell a variety of domestic pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles and birds. The sub-par living conditions of the pets has been the subject of advocacy campaigns in recent years, with proponents arguing that the animals suffer from a lack of proper healthcare and exposure to adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, some customers allege that stall owners falsify vaccination records. There is also a separate area in the souq reserved for falcon handling. The falcon souq, as it is called, sells not only falcons but also the needed accessories such as landing pads and GPS guidance systems for the birds.\n\nAl Rayyan Theatre\nA 980-seat indoor theatre known as Al Rayyan Theatre is located in the souq.\n\nSee also\nSouq Al Wakrah\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe official Website of Souq Waqif Art Center",

          "content": "The National Museum of Qatar is a national museum in Doha, Qatar. The current building opened to the public on 28 March 2019, replacing the previous building which opened in 1975. The building was designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel who was inspired by the desert rose crystal, which is found in Qatar. The museum site includes Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani's palace, which is the heart of the Qatari national identity.\n\nCollection\nA tour of the museum takes visitors through a loop of galleries that address three major, interrelated themes. The galleries are loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the natural history of the desert and the Persian Gulf, artefacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars, the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of oil to the present. The displays and installations that explore these themes present audiovisual displays with carefully selected treasures from the museum's collections. These collections currently consist of approximately 8,000 objects and include archaeological artefacts, architectural elements, heritage household and travelling objects, textiles and costumes, jewelry, decorative arts, books, and historical documents.\nThe museum's mission is to celebrate the culture, heritage, and future of Qatar and its people, embodying the pride and traditions of Qataris while offering international visitors a dialogue about rapid change and modernization.\nSince its inauguration, the museum contained materials which signify Qatar's cultural heritage, such as Bedouin ethnographic materials, maritime artifacts and environmental items. Ancient artifacts, most of which are locally derived, are also housed in the museum.\n\nArchaeological artifacts\nBritish archaeologist Beatrice de Cardi and her team were commissioned to undertake expeditions in Qatar from November 1973 to January 1974 in order to collect artifacts to display in the museum. Their most significant discoveries were at the site of Al Da'asa, which contained numerous Ubaid potsherds dating to the Neolithic period. Artifacts from the earlier Danish expeditions launched throughout the 1950s and 1960s, previously housed at the Doha Public Library, were also put on display in the museum.\nThe museum's antiquities department had an active role in surveys and excavations after De Cardi's expedition ended. They excavated the archaeological sites of Al Wusail and Zubarah.\n\nEthnographic materials\nMaterials documenting Bedouin ethnography range widely in theme. Certain objects on display were historically used as tools and weapons by the Bedouin, whereas others are products such as jewellery, pottery and costumes. Traditional poems are featured in the museum; most notable are works composed by Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a and former emir Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani.\nIn 2015, Sheikh Mubarak bin Saif Al Thani presented the first written draft of the anthem to the Qatar National Museum to be put on display. It was originally scheduled to be moved to the new museum upon its completion.\n\nHistory\nUpon Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani's accession to the throne in 1972, he drew up plans for a national museum in order to document the country's heritage and traditions. That year, he contracted Michael Rice & Company to design the structural and functional aspects of the museum. It was decided that the building would enclose the Old Amiri Palace, a dilapidated early-20th century palace previously occupied by Qatar's former emir, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani. A lagoon was also created to provide a venue for showcasing traditional dhows and pearling equipment.\nOriginally named the Qatar National Museum, it was inaugurated on 23 June 1975. Originally, its facilities included a 100-seat auditorium and a library. In 1980, the museum was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The royal palace which the museum was built around was refurbished in 2015 in preparation for the opening of the new museum.\nAn online platform called Explorer was launched in 2023 by the museum. The platform gives viewers access to online collections, an archaeology and heritage map as well as an interactive timeline of the museum.\nA Memorandum of Cooperation was signed by the NMoQ’s director of partnerships and sponsorships and the director of the National Museum of Mongolia in December 2023. The cooperation also includes an exhibition in Mongolia in 2024, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\nThe NMoQ participated in the Expo 2023 Doha, with activities and workshops for families centred around Qatar’s traditions, culture and natural environment.\nIn September 2023, the Museum received the Green Apple Award for Best Environmental Practices 2023 and in July 2024, the Museum received a Carbon Neutrality Certificate.\nDuring the 2024 Summer Olympics, the NMoQ's Jiwan restaurant provided a week's menu for Le Dalí at the Le Meurice hotel in France. The menu focuses on traditional Middle Eastern as well as regional culinary dishes.\n\nNew building\nThe new building was constructed on the site of the old building. It was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel who was inspired by the desert rose and grows around the original twentieth century palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani. The historic palace was restored by Berlin-based architecture and engineering firm ZRS Architekten Ingenieure. This important monument to Qatar's past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ. The relation between the new building and the old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by Sheikha Al Mayassa as a way to \"define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others […]\" and of \"celebrating our identity\".\nThe 430,000 square foot (40,000 m2) museum is made up of interlocking discs that create cavities to protect visitors from the desert heat. Located on a 1.5 million ft² site at the south end of Doha's Corniche, the NMoQ building rises from the sea and is connected to the shore by two pedestrian bridges and a road bridge.\n\nOriginally, the museum was scheduled to open in 2016, but its opening was pushed back to 28 March 2019. Time magazine named it one of the World's Greatest Places to Visit in 2019, citing the integration of \"immersive video screens and dioramas\" into Jean Nouvel's architectural design.\nThe museum welcomed more than 450,000 visitors in less than a year of its opening. The  museum attracts people as it depicts Qatar's history not through paintings and sculptures but with 21st-century lights, sounds and visuals.\n\nContractor\nThe main building was contracted to a Korea-based company; Hyundai Engineering & Construction in 2011. The project involved the construction of the new National Museum next to the existing Qatar National Museum, which is located across from the Doha Corniche. The museum is designed according to the Bedouin tradition of Qatar. It includes a building in the shape of a desert rose and a 1.2 million ft² landscaped park. The project also includes a 115,000 m2 park with an artificial lagoon and parking spaces for 400 vehicles, a 220-seat auditorium, a research center, laboratories, a dedicated food forum, two restaurants, a café, and two museum shops, one for children.\n\nExhibitions\n\"American Muscle Cars in Qatar\", National Museum of Qatar, October 2021 to February 2022.\n\"Seagrass Tales, Dugong Trails\", National Museum of Qatar, June 2021 to September 2021.\n\"Mal Lawal 3\", National Museum of Qatar, June 2021 to September 2021.\n\"Pipilotti Rist: Your Brain to Me, My Brain to You\", curated by Tom Eccles and Bouthayna Baltaj, March 2022 to January 2023.\n\"A Sneak Peek at Qatar Auto Museum Project\", March 2022 to January 2023.\n\"On the Move\", October 2022 to January 2023.\n\"The Majlis: A Meeting Place\", November 2022 to March 2023.\n\"HERMÈS HERITAGE: HARNESSING THE ROOTS\", March 2023 to April 2023.\nOlafur Eliasson: \"The curious desert\", National Museum of Qatar, until August 2023.\n\"The Shape of Time: Art and Ancestors of Oceania from The Metropolitan Museum of Art\", October 2023 to January 2024.\n\"Growing Kopi, Drinking Qahwa; Stories of Coffee in Qatar and Indonesia\", October 2023 to February 2024.\n\"Benchellal: Monumental Sculpting Past Tomorrow\", curated by Al Shaima Ayoub, November 2024 to January 2025.\n\"MANZAR: Art and Architecture from Pakistan 1940s to Today\", organized by the Art Mill Museum, November 2024 to January 2025.\n\"Ultraleggera: A Design Journey with Marcello Gandini\", in collaboration with the Qatar Auto Museum and the Museo Nazionale dell’Automobile, April 2025 to June 2025.\n\"Latino Americano | Modern and Contemporary Art from the Malba and Eduardo Costantini Collections\", April 2025 to July 2025.\n\nDirectors\nFrom 2013 to 2023, the director of the museum was Sheikha Amna.

          "title": "Zubarah",
          "content": "Zubarah (Arabic: الزبارة), also referred to as Al Zubarah or Az Zubarah, is a ruined, ancient town located on the northwestern coast of the Qatar peninsula in the Al Shamal municipality, about 65 miles or 105 kilometres from the capital Doha. It was founded by the Bani Utbah tribal confederation who migrated from Kuwait in the mid-eighteenth century. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.\nIt was once a successful center of global trade and pearl fishing positioned midway between the Strait of Hormuz and the west arm of the Persian Gulf. It is one of the most extensive and best-preserved examples of an 18th–19th century settlement in the region. The layout and urban fabric of the settlement have been preserved in a manner unlike any other settlements in the Persian Gulf, providing insight into the urban life, spatial organization, and the social and economic history of the Persian Gulf before the discovery of oil and gas in the 20th century.\nCovering an area of around 400 hectares (60 hectares inside the outer town wall), Zubarah is Qatar's most substantial archaeological site. The site comprises the fortified town with a later inner and an earlier outer wall, a harbour, a sea canal, two screening walls, Qal'at Murair (Murair fort), and the more recent Al Zubara Fort.\n\nEtymology\nThe most widely accepted etymology of Zubarah links it the Arabic term for an elevated sand mound or small hill, a definition supported by the site's natural topography. The original settlement was established upon a raised area overlooking the sea, a feature that would have afforded both strategic advantage and visibility along the coastline. This interpretation is consistent with the Arabic usage of terms such as zuba (زُبى), which denotes high ground.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nDuring the early Islamic period, trade and commerce boomed in northern Qatar. Settlements began to appear on the coast, primarily between the towns of Zubarah and Umm Al Maa. A village dating back to the early Islamic period was discovered near the town.\nBetween September 1627 and April 1628, a Portuguese naval squadron led by D. Goncalo da Silveira set several neighboring coastal villages ablaze. Zubarah's settlement and growth during this period is attributed to the dislodging of people from these adjacent settlements.\n\nSettlement\nThe origins of Zubarah are the subject of some historical dispute. The 1986 history book Qatar's Memorial claimed that a functioning, self-governing settlement existed in the area prior to the arrival of the Bani Utbah tribal confederation. It supported this claim by invoking two purported historical documents; however, they were later exposed as forgeries produced by Qatari authorities amid a territorial dispute with Bahrain over sovereignty of the site.\nBy contrast, the more widely accepted narrative places the foundation and rise of Zubarah within the broader context of the Bani Utbah migration. Sometime before 1698, the Bani Utbah clans, comprising families from the Anaza tribe including the Al Sabah, Al Khalifa, and Al Jalahma, migrated from the Najd region of central Arabia in response to prolonged drought. Their migration path took them through Al Aflaj, Qatif, and Al Ahsa, eventually reaching Freiha in northwestern Qatar, near the future site of Zubarah.\nUpon settling in Freiha, the Utub formed an alliance with local Qatari tribes, most notably the Al-Maadeed, a powerful clan affiliated with Bani Khalid, as well as the Al Sulaim. This coalition became known as the Bani Utbah, which later expanded to include other Najdi and Banu Tamim families. They established Freiha as a fortified coastal hub with access to maritime trade routes and pearling waters. After successive military skirmishes with the dominant Al Musallam tribe, who were a Bani Khalid tribe under nominal Ottoman support, the Bani Utbah tribes were forced to depart to Iraq in 1716, followed by Kuwait.\nIn the mid-18th century, likely during the 1760s, several tribes of the Bani Utbah, including factions of the Al Bin Ali, Al-Maadeed and Al Jalahmah, returned to Qatar's northern coast and began to settle in Zubarah, approximately 100 metres (330 ft) from their earlier settlement at Freiha. By this time, the area had grown into a small but active coastal village. Its existence as a recognized port is attested in a 1766 manuscript of Lamʿ al-Shihāb fī Sīrat Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, which records that Sheikh Sulayman Al Humaid of the Bani Khalid issued an ultimatum forbidding trade between Uyayna and coastal settlements under his control, including Zubarah. The passage suggests that by the mid-18th century, Zubarah was already recognized as a port of economic significance within Bani Khalid territory.\nShortly thereafter, Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa of the Al Khalifa family migrated from Kuwait and was invited by the inhabitants of Zubarah, comprising various Bani Utbah tribes such as the Al Bin Ali and Al Jalahimah, to settle in the town. At the time, nearby Al Huwaila as well as several other northern settlements remained under the authority of the Al Musallam clan. As the Al Khalifa's influence in Zubarah expanded, they faced growing resistance from the Al Musallam leadership, who sought to reassert their authority.\n\nInitial development\nAs the influence of the Al Khalifa branch of the Bani Utbah expanded in Zubarah during the 1760s, tensions with the Al Musallam clan, then acting as local representatives of the Bani Khalid, began to escalate. The Al Musallam demanded tribute from the new arrivals, but Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa refused, prompting a series of skirmishes between the two factions. In response to the growing threat, Al Khalifa initiated the construction of a fortified settlement. Completed by 1768, the structure became known as Qal'at Murair, a coastal stronghold with defensive walls, watchtowers, and a canal linking it to the sea. Other defensive installations, including additional forts and towers built by earlier settlers, existed throughout the area.\nTo reinforce his political position, Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa also forged alliances through intermarriage with prominent tribal families, including the Al Bin Ali and Al Bu Kuwara. Following several successive skirmishes over their refusal to pay taxes, the Al Khalifa launched a successful assault on Al Huwaila, leading to the flight of the Al Musallam leadership to Najd.\nFollowing the expulsion of the Bani Khalid, who ruled over much of northern Qatar, the Bani Utbah focused on developing Zubarah into a major port town. With a naturally sheltered harbor and newly reinforced defenses, it soon emerged as one of the principal emporiums and pearl trading centres of the Persian Gulf. The town attracted merchants from across the region, developing extensive trade links with India, Oman, Iraq, and Kuwait. Exports such as dates and pearls passed through its harbor alongside imports of spices and metals.\nThe abolition of trade taxes under the Utub further stimulated commercial activity, drawing traders from other Gulf ports. The town's prosperity further increased after the Ottoman–Persian War (1775–1776) and the subsequent Persian occupation of Basra. The disruption of commerce in southern Iraq prompted many Basran merchants and refugees to relocate to Zubarah, contributing to its rapid expansion.\nAmong these new arrivals was the affluent merchant Muhammad ibn Husayn ibn Rizq al-Ruzayqi and his son Ahmad, who played a major role in Zubarah's development. With the support of Khalifa bin Muhammad, who succeeded his father in 1777, the elder bin Rizq constructed a large residential complex that doubled as a commercial hub. At Ahmad's request, the scholar and jurist Uthman ibn Sanad al-Basri was invited to the town to serve as the supreme judge. In his biography, first published in 1813, ibn Sanad documented the administration and personages of Zubarah during this period, noting the arrival of other prominent figures such as the theologian Abd al-Djalil al-Tabatabai.\nAlso during the 1770s, merchants and residents from across Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar relocated to Zubarah in response to instability in the Gulf, including recurring attacks and outbreaks of plague. The ongoing conflict between the Bani Khalid and the rising Wahhabi movement also contributed to Zubarah's emergence as a safe and prosperous alternative. Among those born during this period of expansion was Thani bin Mohammed, founder of the House of Thani, who would later become an influential pearl trader. His commercial success earned his tribe, the Al-Maadeed, increased political influence in the town.\n\n1783 Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain\nTensions between Zubarah and Persian-ruled Bahrain escalated in 1782 following an incident on the island of Sitra. A servant of the Al Khalifa family named Salem had been dispatched to purchase palm trunk, ropes, and other materials. While there, he and his companions were attacked by local Shi‘a residents; Salem was killed, several others were wounded, and their belongings were looted. Survivors returned to Zubarah, prompting outrage among its leaders. Sheikh Ahmad bin Muhammad Al Khalifa, angered by the killing of his retainer, sent a formal protest to Nasr Al-Madhkur, the Persian-appointed ruler of Bahrain and Bushehr. When Nasr failed to respond seriously, the Al Khalifa used the incident as justification for retaliation. \nWith the support of fellow Utub tribes, they launched an assault on Bahrain on 9 September 1782, plundering and destroying the town of Manama. A brief land battle ensued between the Arab tribes and Persian defenders, in which both sides suffered casualties. The people of Zubarah returned to the mainland after three days with a seized Persian gallivat that had been used to collect the annual treaty. On 1 October, the Persian governor of Shiraz, Ali Murad Khan, ordered Nasr Al-Madhkur to launch a full-scale counterattack against Zubarah and sent him reinforcements from the Persian mainland. Approximately 2,000 Persian troops were dispatched, and by December 1782, they began preparations for a landing on the Qatari coast.\nIn May 1783, Nasr's fleet arrived off the coast of Qatar and began disembarking at Ras Ushayriq near Zubarah. Due to low tide, the ships were forced to anchor offshore while the army advanced overland. Zubarah was besieged for nearly a month. Mediation efforts by Rashid bin Matar, the former ruler of Julfar (present-day Ras Al Khaimah), led to negotiations in which the Utub offered to return goods and ships previously seized from Persian ports such as Bandar Rig and from Bahrain. However, Nasr Al-Madhkur rejected the proposal and pressed ahead with his campaign. \nOn a Friday in December 1783, Persian forces landed between Zubarah and Freiha and launched a final assault. They were repelled in a decisive battle by a coalition of local Qatari tribes, which included the Al Maadeed of Freiha. Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa, the nephew of Nasr Al-Madhkur, was killed in combat along with many of his soldiers. The Persian army was routed, and its remnants fled the battlefield.\nFollowing the defeat of Nasr Al-Madhkur's forces, his sword was seized by the Al Ibn Salama branch of the Al Bin Ali tribe, who had assisted the Al Khalifa in the defense of Zubarah. The sword later came into the possession of Sheikh Sultan bin Salama, remaining with his descendants until 1915, when it was formally presented as a gift to the ruler of Qatar at the time, Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani.\nAfter the invasion, Sheikh Ahmed bin Muhammad bin Khalifa assumed control of the island, expelling the Persians and installing a governor on his behalf. His primary residence, however, remained in Zubarah, while a garrison was established in Qal'at Ad-Diwan, located south of present-day Manama.\n\nDespite the instability surrounding Zubarah after the siege of Zubarah and the conquest of Bahrain in 1783, it flourished as a trading centre and its port grew larger than that of Qatif's by 1790. Al Zubarah developed into a center of Islamic education during this century. The first almanac produced in Qatar, and one of the earliest preserved local literary works in the nation, was produced here in 1790 – the Zubarah Almanac, authored by the Maliki Sunni scholar ‘Abd al Rahman al-Zawāwī. This calendar outlined the months and days of the year, specified prayer times, and included observations on agriculture and seasonal variations.\nThe town came under threat from 1780 onward due to the intermittent raids launched by the Wahhabis on the Bani Khalid strongholds in nearby Al Ahsa. The Wahhabis speculated that the population of Zubarah would conspire against the regime in Al Ahsa with the help of the Bani Khalid. They also believed that its residents practiced teachings contrary to the Wahhabi doctrine and regarded the town as an important gateway to the Persian Gulf. Saudi general Sulaiman ibn Ufaysan led a raid against the town in 1787. In 1792, a massive Wahhabi force conquered Al Ahsa, forcing many refugees to flee to Zubarah. Wahhabi forces besieged Zubarah and several neighboring settlements two years later to punish them for accommodating asylum seekers. The local chieftains were allowed to continue carrying out administrative tasks but were required to pay a tax.\n\nCommunal life\nZubarah was at that time a well-organised town, with many of the streets running at right angles to one another and some neighbourhoods built according to a strict grid pattern. This layout suggests that the town was laid out and built as part of a major event, although seemingly constructed in closely dated stages. An estimate of the population at the height of the town has been calculated to a maximum number of between 6,000 and 9,000 people.\nMost of the settler's dietary requirements were fulfilled by consuming livestock animals. Remnants of sheep, goat, birds, fish, and gazelle were among the waste collected from the palatial compounds. The wealthiest members of the community consumed mainly livestock, whereas the poorer residents relied on fish as their primary source of protein. Social, economic, and political activity was most likely centered in the souq. The discovery of numerous ceramic tobacco pipe bowls indicates a reluctant acceptance and growing social addiction to smoking tobacco. Coffee pots, mainly of Chinese origin, were used by Zubarah's inhabitants to drink Arabic coffee.\n\nLater developments and decline (19th century)\nThe town was occupied by the Wahhabis in 1809. After the Wahhabi amir was made aware of advancements by hostile Egyptian troops on the western frontier in 1811, he reduced his garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah to re-position his troops. Said bin Sultan of Muscat capitalized on this opportunity and attacked the Wahhabi garrisons in the eastern peninsula. The Wahhabi fortification in Zubarah was set ablaze and the Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power. Following the attack, the town was abandoned for a short period. However, later archaeological discoveries indicate that the town may have been partially abandoned shortly before the 1811 attack.\nFrom around 1810, the British Empire became more influential in the Persian Gulf area, stationing political agents in various ports and cities to protect their trading routes. In one of the first descriptions of the salient towns in Qatar, Major Colebrook described Zubarah as such in 1820:\n\n\"protected by a tower and occupied at present merely for the security of fishermen that frequent it. It has a Khor (creek) with three fathoms water which Buggalahs may enter.\"\nCaptain George Barnes Brucks gave his account of Zubarah four years later. He stated:\n\n\"(it was) a large town, now in ruins. It is situated in a bay, and has been, before it was destroyed, a place of considerable trade.\"\nZubarah was eventually resettled in the late 1820s. It remained a pearl fishing community but on a significantly smaller scale than previously. The reconstructed town barely covered 20% of its predecessor. A new town wall was constructed much closer to the shore than the earlier town wall. This phase of Zubarah was not as organized in the layout of the streets and its buildings. Houses were still built in the traditional courtyard form, but on a smaller scale and more irregular in their shape. Additionally, evidence of decorated plaster known from earlier buildings was not found in the newly constructed buildings.\nIn 1868, the Al Khalifa launched a major naval attack on the eastern portion of Qatar. In the aftermath of this attack, a sovereignty treaty was signed between the Al Thani and the British, uniting the entire Qatari Peninsula under the leadership of the Al Thani. Nearly all of the authority that the Al Khalifa held in Zubarah was diminished, except for informal treaties they had signed with a few local tribes.\n\nAl Khalifa contention\nOn 16 August 1873, assistant political resident Charles Grant falsely reported that the Ottomans had sent a contingent of 100 troops under the command of Hossein Effendi from Qatif to Zubarah. This report angered the Emir of Bahrain, as he had previously signed a treaty with the Naim tribe residing in Zubarah in which they agreed to be his subjects, and the report implied that the Ottomans were encroaching on his territory. When questioned by the Emir, Grant referred him to political resident Edward Ross. Ross informed the Emir that he believed he had no right to protect tribes residing in Qatar. In September, the Emir reiterated his sovereignty over the town and the Naim tribe. Grant argued that there was no special mention of the Naim or Zubarah in any British treaties signed with Bahrain. A government official agreed with his views and concurred \"that it was desirable that the Chief of Bahrain should, as far as practicable abstain from interfering in complications on the mainland.\"\nThe Al Khalifa witnessed another opportunity to renew their claim on the town in 1874 after a Bahraini opposition leader named Nasir bin Mubarak moved to Qatar. They believed that Mubarak, with the assistance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, would attack the Naim living in Zubarah as a prelude to an invasion of Bahrain. As a result, a body of Bahraini reinforcements were sent to Zubarah, much to the disapproval of the British who suggested that the Emir was involving himself in complications. Edward Ross made it apparent that a government council decision advised the Emir that he should not interfere in the affairs of Qatar. However, the Al Khalifa remained in frequent contact with the Naim, drafting 100 tribe members in their army and offering them financial assistance.\n\nIn September 1878, several Zubarans were involved in an act of piracy on a passing boat which resulted in the deaths of four people. Political resident Edward Ross demanded that the Ottoman authorities punish the townspeople for the crime, and extended an offer of British naval assistance. He met with wāli Abdullah Pasha in Basra to finalize the deal. Shortly after the British–Ottoman meeting, Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani and Nasir bin Mubarak attacked Zubarah with a force of 2,000 armed men. By 22 October, Jassim bin Mohammed's army, having sacked the town, surrounded Murair Fort, which was fortified by 500 members of the Naim tribe. The Naim eventually surrendered to Jassim bin Mohammed's forces on unfavorable terms and most of the Zubarah's residents were relocated to Doha. The incident aggravated the ruler of Bahrain due to his treaty with the Naim tribe. There were reports in 1888 that Jassim intended to restore the city so that it could serve as a base for his son-in-law to attack Bahrain, but he renounced his plans after being warned by the British.\n\nRe-settlement of Al Bin Ali in 1895\nAt the request of Jassim bin Mohammed, several members of the Al Bin Ali, an Utub tribe, relocated from Bahrain to Zubarah in 1895 after renouncing their allegiance to the Bahraini emir. The Bahraini emir, fearful that Jassim bin Mohammed was preparing to launch an invasion, issued a warning to him and informed the political resident in Bahrain of the dispute. Upon being made aware of the proceedings, the British requested the Ottomans, who had been acting in concert with Jassim bin Mohammed, to abort the settlement. Much to the indignation of the Ottomans, the British sent a naval ship to Zubarah shortly after and seized seven of the Al Bin Ali's boats after the tribe's leader refused to comply with their directive. The Ottoman governor of Zubarah, under the belief that the British were infringing on Ottoman dominion, relayed the events to the Ottoman Porte, who began assembling a large army near Qatif. Jassim bin Mohammed also congregated a large number of boats near the coast. Subsequently, the governor of Zubarah declared Bahrain as Ottoman territory and threatened that the Porte would provide military support to Qatari tribes who were preparing to launch a naval invasion. This invoked a harsh reprisal from Britain, who, after issuing a written notice, opened fire on Zubarah's port, destroying 44 dhows. The incursion and subsequent Ottoman retreat prompted Jassim bin Mohammed and his army to surrender on unfavorable terms, in which he was instructed to hoist the Trucial flag at Zubarah. He was also ordered to pay 30,000 rupees.\n\nAbandonment (20th and 21st century)\nWith its population already depleted, much of the remaining population migrated to other regions in Qatar in the early 20th century due to the inadequate water supply in the town.\nJ.G. Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf gives the following account of Zubarah in 1908:\n\n\"A ruined and deserted town on the west side of the Qatar Promontory, about 5 miles south of Khor Hassan. It stands at the foot of a deep bay of the same name, of which the western point is Ras 'Ashairiq and which contains a small island, also called Zubarah . The town was formerly the stronghold of the Al Khalifah ruling family of Bahrain : its site is still frequented by the Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar. The town was walled and some 10 or 12 forts stood within a radius of 7 miles round it, among them Faraihah, Halwan, Lisha, Ain Muhammad, Qal'at Murair, Rakaiyat, Umm-ash-Shuwail and Thaghab [...]. All of these are now ruinous and deserted, except Thaghab, which the people of Khor Hassan visit to draw water. Murair is said to have been connected with the sea by a creek which enabled sailing boats to discharge their cargoes at its gate, but the inlet is now silted up with sand.\"\n\nIn 1937, a conflict broke out between Qatari loyalists and the Naim tribe who had defected to Bahrain, precipitating Bahrain's subsequent territorial claims to Zubarah. A proposal for Zubarah to become an oil terminal was a contributing factor in the conflict. Qatar's emir, Abdullah bin Jassim, referred to the Bahraini claim on Zubarah as \"imaginary\" and \"not based on logic\". He also alleged that Bahrain assisted the Naim in the form of arms and finances. That year, in the aftermath of the conflict and subsequent out-migration, Abdullah bin Jassim began the construction of Al Zubara Fort to compensate for the reduced garrison. It was completed in 1938. Qal'at Murair, the hitherto principal fort of the town, was abandoned soon after Al Zubara Fort was erected.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the political adviser in Bahrain, Charles Belgrave, reported that just a few Bedouin of the Naim tribe lived, albeit nomadically, in the ruined town. The area was gradually abandoned towards the end of the 20th century and was used primarily for beach camps. The fort also housed a coast guard station until the 1980s.\n\nGeography\nZubarah encompasses a 400-hectare stretch on the northwestern coast of the Qatar peninsula and is located approximately 105 km (65 mi) from the Qatari capital Doha. It is situated over a low, coastal hillock. The two main habitat types are the sabkha and the stony desert. The northern and south-eastern section of the site are bounded by sabkhas. Historically, fresh water was scarcely available. In an attempt to amass a water supply, Murair Fort was constructed 1.8 km (1.1 mi) eastward of the original settlement, on the margins of the desert scarp. The fort served to facilitate wells that tapped the shallow freshwater lenses.\nHolocene deposits are densely scattered in the sabkha and mud plain areas located near the city ruins and the sea. Most of the buildings in Zubarah were constructed using materials from these deposits. An area encompassing the city ruins and the project, which is labeled a proto-sabkha habitat, also contains large quantities of Holocene fossils. Eocene limestone is predominant further inland where the habitat is a stony, arid desert.\nZubarah Beach is located near the archaeological site and is open only to those on guided tours.\n\nFlora and fauna\nVegetation in Zubarah is sparse, although three of the most recurrent species of seagrasses in the Persian Gulf have been collected and recorded in the area. This includes Halophila ovalis, Halophila stipulacea and Halodule uninervis.\nAround 48 fish species, 40 mollusc species, 17 reptile species, and 170 arthropod species were recorded in the expanse of the town. A preliminary investigation of Zubarah uncovered four previously unknown species of tardigrades. Eleven species of Heterotardigrada, a class of the tardigrade, have been found to occur in the area. Spiny-tailed lizards are the most prominent reptile species in the area. They are commonly spotted on vegetation. Mesalina brevirostris, a species of short-nosed lizard, is another reptile species that is densely scattered throughout the area.\n\nEconomy and trade\nPearling activities\nZubarah was primarily an emporium and pearling settlement that capitalized on its proximity to pearl beds, possession of a large harbour, and its central position on the Gulf routes. Its economy depended on the pearl diving season, which took place during the long summer months. Pearling drew Bedouin from the interior of Qatar as well as people from all over the Persian Gulf to dive, trade, and safeguard the town from attack while the town's men were at sea.\nBoats from Zubarah would sail out to the pearl beds found along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, from Bahrain to the United Arab Emirates. The trips lasted several weeks at a time. Men worked in pairs to harvest mollusks potentially hiding pearls inside them. One man would dive for about a minute and the other remained on the ship to pull the diver back to safety with his harvest.  \nThe archaeological evidence for pearling on site comes primarily from the tools used by the divers such, as pearl boxes, diving weights, and small measuring weights used during trading.\n\nGlobal trade\nZubarah was the focal point of an extensive regional trade network during its peak in the late eighteenth century. Until the introduction of the cultured pearl in the early 1900s, the trade in pearls constituted the Persian Gulf's most important industry, employing up to a third of the male population in the region. Zubarah, being one of the focal pearling and trading towns, contributed to the geopolitical, social, and cultural trajectories of Gulf history which shape the region today.\nCeramics, coins, and the remains of foodstuffs from the excavations attest to Zubarah's far-reaching trade and economic links in the late 18th century, with material deriving from eastern Asia, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, Africa, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Diving weights and other material cultures show how closely the connection between the daily life in the town and the pearl fishing and trading were. The discovery of coffee cups and tobacco pipes in the excavations reveals the growing importance of these commodities all over the Persian Gulf during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The etching of a merchant's dhow –a traditional wooden boat of Arabia– found incised into the plaster in a room of a courtyard building, details how intimately the town's inhabitants associated their daily lives with long-distance maritime trade and commerce. Date trade also had an important role in the local economy.\n\nMarketplace\nA complex array of small storage rooms have been identified as part of the souq (market) of Zubarah. The wide variety of trade objects that have been found in the rooms points towards the area's classification as a place of trade. The souq would have been the centre of the town and of its economy. Various commodities, including ironsmithing, were sold at this souq.\n\nHistorical architecture\nInfrastructure\nThe architecture consisted mainly of courtyard houses, a traditional form of Arabic architecture found throughout the Middle East. A series of small rooms were organized around a large central courtyard, where the majority of daily activity took place. Typically, a portico opened out onto the courtyard on the south side, which offered shelter from the sun. The houses of Zubarah were constructed from soft local stone, or from limestone quarried from the northern settlement of Freiha. The stone was then protected by a thick gypsum plaster coating. Features such as doorways and niches were decorated with geometric stucco designs. Housing units were accessible by a doorway and a bent corridor, in order to avert unauthorized viewing into the household, and to prevent sand from blowing into the house. Traces of what seem to be tent placements and/or palm-leaf and palm-matt huts found near the beach may be associated with transient members of the Zubaran society. These interim dwellings likely housed the people who were the primary producers of Zubarah's wealth: the pearl fishers and mariners who harvested the pearl banks each season.\nThe most impressive and colossal of the building complexes measures 110 by 110 m (360 by 360 ft) in size and is commonly referred to as 'the palace'. This structure follows the same form as the domestic architecture seen elsewhere in Zubarah, but on a much larger scale. Nine interconnected compounds, each comprising a courtyard surrounded by a range of rooms, made up the interior of this structure. Plaster stucco decoration was used to embellish internal entrances and rooms. The discovery of internal staircases indicates that the compounds were multi-storeyed. The nine compounds of the complex were enclosed by a high circuit wall with circular towers at the four corners, each of which was capable of supporting a small cannon. The size and visual dominance of the palatial compound suggest that it was occupied by a family of wealthy and powerful sheikhs who were community leaders in the social and economic life of the town.\n\nFortifications\nThe protection of the town and its people's wealth was a clear priority. A large wall was built in the late-18th-century town and its bay in a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) arc from shore to shore. The wall was defended by 22 semi-circular towers placed at regular intervals. It was faced by a parapet with a walkway, most likely to provide leverage for gunners. Access to the town was limited to a few defended gateways from the landside, or via its harbour. There was no sea wall, but a stout fort defended the main landing area on the sandy beach.\nDespite its defensive fortifications, Zubarah was attacked on several occasions. In addition to two major attacks carried out at the behest of Nasr Al-Madhkur in 1778, and 1782, the residents of the town were engaged in a war with the Banu Kaab of Khuzestan during the late eighteenth century.\n\nIndustry\nA large number of date-presses (madbassat) are found in houses throughout the town. They are small rooms with ridged plastered floors sloping to one corner where a jar would have been placed. Dates were packed in sacks and placed on the floor with weights on top to squeeze out the date juice – a sweet sticky syrup (dibs). The jar would collect and preserve the syrup for later consumption or use in cooking. In 2014, a site was excavated which revealed the largest yet-discovered date-pressing site in the country and region. There were 27 date presses found overall, including 11 found in one lone complex.\n\nAttractions\nAl Zubara Fort\nZubarah is well known for the fortress of 1938, which was officially named after the town. The Al Zubara Fort follows a traditional concept with a square ground plan with sloping walls and corner towers. Three of the towers are round while the fourth, the southeast tower, is rectangular; each is topped with curved-pointed crenellations, with the fourth as the most machicolated tower. The fort's design recalls earlier features common in Arab and Gulf fortification architecture but varies by being constructed on concrete foundations. It marks the transition from solely stone-built structures to cement-based ones, albeit in a traditional design.\n\nOriginally, the fort was built as a base for the Qatari military and police to protect Qatar's northwest coast as part of a series of forts along Qatar's coastline. It was restored in 1987 with the removal of some much later auxiliary buildings erected to house the Qatari forces. After opening, the fort quickly became a major heritage attraction and, for a while, a local museum. Due to the unsuitable conditions in the fort for displaying and storing finds, the objects were relocated to Doha in 2010. Starting in 2011, the Qatar Museums Authority conducted a project of monitoring and restoration to ensure the upkeep of the fort. Between 2010 and 2013, parts of the fort were inaccessible to visitors.\n\nQal'at Murair\nThe Murair Fort (Qal'at Murair in Arabic), situated 1.65 km (1.03 mi) east of the town of Zubarah, was built shortly after the town's settlement. The fort served to espouse Zubarah and especially entrenched the town's primary freshwater source: groundwater reached by shallow wells. Within the fortification walls were a mosque, domestic buildings, and at least one large well. Around the fort, several enclosures attest to the presence of fields, plantations, or holding pens for animals, suggesting that this was also an agricultural settlement.\nShortly after the foundation of Zubarah, two screening walls were constructed from the outer town wall toward Qal'at Murair. These two walls, oriented east-west, include round towers placed at regular intervals, which strengthened their defensive capabilities. The screening walls likely served to secure the transportation of water from the wells inside Qal'at Murair to Zubarah. In the hot summers of the Persian Gulf, water was a valuable commodity. The walls also channeled general traffic to and from the town over open salt flats.\n\nTourism\nZubarah was added to UNESCO's World Heritage tentative list in 2008. Since 2009, the site has been the subject of joint research by the Qatar Islamic Archaeology and Heritage Project (QIAH) and Copenhagen University, and development as a protected heritage site. For protection, most of the site is enclosed within a fenced area. Additionally, visitors must pass a guard to enter the heritage town.\nPrior to its addition to the World Heritage List, there was no visitor centre in the town. Other visitor facilities were sparse. An information stand in a parking lot next to the Al Zubara Fort provided an overview and introduction to the site, fort, and town. There were restrooms located near the fort, but there were no refreshments available in the vicinity.\nOn June 22, 2013, UNESCO added the site to its World Heritage List. The UNESCO report stated that the town was distinguished by its degree of preservation and its evidenced sustainment by pearl diving and commerce. Following its inclusion in the list, the partially restored fort was transformed into a visitor centre and several rooms were designated for showcasing the subjects of pearling and astronomy.\n\nGuided tours of the town are offered, and field trips to the site are being integrated into various schools' history curriculum. There is also a self-guided tour, where the visitor is guided by signposts. Tourism increased rapidly after the town's renovations were completed in 2014, attracting more than 30,000 visitors in the first three months of the year. This was a 170% increase from the entire 2013 season.\n\nSports\nThe town currently hosts the Tour of Al Zubarah, a men's one-day cycle race which was rated as 2.2 by the UCI and forms part of the UCI Asia Tour. It was selected as the host of the tournament to procure more media attention to the region, thereby amplifying tourism. In addition, Zubarah is one of the host cities of the ladies' and men's Tour of Qatar and has been described as one of the toughest and longest stages in the course.\nA horse racing event known as Al Zubarah Cup is staged in the town. A horse breeding farm, which is planned to be one of the largest in the region, is currently being constructed in the town. The project is funded by the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club.\n\nEducation\nDevelopments\nThe planned Qatar–Bahrain Friendship Bridge, slated to be the longest fixed link in the world, will connect the northwest coast of Qatar near Zubarah with Bahrain, specifically, south of Manama. Its location several kilometres south of Zubarah is planned so as to have negligible impact on the heritage site. It was originally expected to be constructed by 2022, but has faced numerous delays. In February 2024, during a meeting of Qatari–Bahraini Follow-up Committee, both Qatari and Bahraini officials confirmed they were \"taking necessary steps to implement the project\".\nAn expansion of Zubarah Road –a one-lane road leading to the archaeological site– was announced in 2014 by the Public Works Authority. It is planned to introduce three additional lanes.\n\nArchaeology and conservation\nIn March 1956, the site of Zubarah was included in the first Danish expeditions of Qatar and a team of archaeologists from Aarhus University and Moesgård Museum provided preliminary reconnaissance of the area. In 1962, Moesgård Museum archaeologist Hans Jørgen Madsen returned to the ruins in Zubarah and conducted further surveys.\nThe Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) and its predecessor carried out two excavation projects in Zubarah, with the first during the early 1980s, and the latter from 2002 to 2003. The excavations in the 1980s were the more comprehensive of the two.\nIn 2009, the QMA jointly launched the Qatar Islamic Archaeology and Heritage Project (QIAH) with the University of Copenhagen. The QIAH is a ten-year research, conservation, and heritage initiative to investigate archaeological sites, preserve their fragile remains, and work towards the presentation of the sites to the public. The project is an initiative by the Qatar Museums Authority's chairperson H.E. Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and vice-chairperson H.E. Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani.\n\nThe QIAH project carried out a complete topographic survey of the Zubarah site, the adjacent Murair site, and the Al Zubara Fort. Archaeological excavations have been undertaken at Zubarah and Qal`at Murair, supported by landscape studies in the hinterland. Numerous sites belonging to different chronological periods have been identified and recorded, and exploratory excavations have been conducted at a number of important localities, especially Freiha and Fuwayrit.\nA team from the University of Hamburg recorded the architectural remains of Zubarah in great detail with a 3D scanner. To preserve the architectural remains, a restoration program has been launched using a special, saline-resistant mortar and plasters to maximise the visitor experience, while abiding by UNESCO heritage guidelines. The conservation work aims to preserve the authenticity of the site, as well as to preserve areas that can be enjoyed by visitors to the site through, among other means, interactive displays on mobile devices.\n\nSovereignty disputes\nThere have been separate claims made by Qatar and Bahrain over the territory of Zubarah since the time of Ottoman rule. Following the signing of the 1868 sovereignty treaty by the Al Thani, the earliest recorded disagreement over ownership occurred in 1873, when the Bahraini emir claimed sovereignty over Zubarah after he received false news of a military party that was supposedly en route to sack Zubarah. In 1937, prior to the start of the 1937 Qatari–Bahraini conflict, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain alerted the local political resident to the long-running dispute. He, in turn, referred the issue to the political resident in Bushehr. The political resident in Bushehr wrote back, stating:\n\nPersonally I am of opinion that Zubara definitely belongs to Qatar but I am writing to His Majesty's Government, pending their decision you should avoid giving any opinion at all to Bahrain Government on the matter including the fact that I am referring the question.\nHamad ibn Isa wrote again to the political resident in Bahrain in 1939 to inform him that Abdullah Al Thani had constructed a fort in Zubarah. He contended that the construction was illegal because he held sovereignty over the land. A settlement was reached in 1944 during a meeting mediated by the Saudis, in which Qatar recognized Bahrain's customary rights, such as grazing, and visiting with no formalities necessary. However, Abdullah broke the accord when he constructed a fort in the town. The strenuous relationship between the two countries improved in 1950 after Ali Al Thani ascended to the throne.\nIn 1953, Bahrain again reiterated its claims over Zubarah when it sent a party of students and teachers to Zubarah who proceeded to write 'Bahrain' on the walls of Al Zubara Fort. Furthermore, the Bahrain Education Department published maps that alleged Bahraini sovereignty over the entire northwest coast of the peninsula. Ali responded by occupying the fort in 1954 and later added police in 1956.\nFollowing the independence of Qatar from the British Empire in 1971, Bahrain continued to dispute Qatari sovereignty over Zubarah until the case was settled in Qatar's favour by a ruling from the International Court of Justice in 2001.\nThe issue of sovereignty came up again following the onset of the Qatar diplomatic crisis. In June 2018, the Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (DERASAT) held a conference on the history of the Al Khalifa family's control of Qatar until 1868, during which they urged the Bahraini government to renew its claims over Zubarah. In August, the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa publicly met with the Naim tribe, natives of Zubarah who in the past professed allegiance to the King of Bahrain, and said in a statement that \"we will not forget the illegal aggression against Zubarah\", referring to Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani's excursion against the Naim tribe in 1937.\n\nIn popular culture\nAn independent and modernized Zubarah (spelled Zubara) is the setting for much of Larry Correia's and Micheal Kupari's military thriller Dead Six.\n\nSee also\nBani Utbah\nHistory of Qatar\nHistory of Bahrain\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAbu Hakima, A.M.

          "summary": "Zubarah (Arabic: الزبارة), also referred to as Al Zubarah or Az Zubarah, is a ruined, ancient town located on the northwestern coast of the Qatar peninsula in the Al Shamal municipality, about 65 miles or 105 kilometres from the capital Doha. It was founded by the Bani Utbah tribal confederation who migrated from Kuwait in the mid-eighteenth century. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.\nIt was once a successful center of global trade and pearl fishing positioned midway between the Strait of Hormuz and the west arm of the Persian Gulf. It is one of the most extensive and best-preserved examples of an 18th–19th century settlement in the region. The layout and urban fabric of the settlement have been preserved in a manner unlike any other settlements in the Persian Gulf, providing insight into the urban life, spatial organization, and the social and economic history of the Persian Gulf before the discovery of oil and gas in the 20th century.\nCovering an area of around 400 hectares (60 hectares inside the outer town wall), Zubarah is Qatar's most substantial archaeological site. The site comprises the fortified town with a later inner and an earlier outer wall, a harbour, a sea canal, two screening walls, Qal'at Murair (Murair fort), and the more recent Al Zubara Fort.",

They are located at the southern side of the defensive system established at the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century to protect the rawda, a depression where precious rainwater is collected after flowing downward from higher ground. In Arabic, barzan means \"high place\".\nThe buildings were restored in 2003. The towers measure 16 m (52 ft) high. The fort links to two other fortified buildings towards the west and another tower towards the north. Barzan Towers may have been built near the sea to keep an observant eye on pearl divers, as a look-out for approaching ships, and as an observatory for tracking the moon. The Barzan Towers have been rebuilt with features such as air-conditioners.\nOriginally built with coral rock and limestone cementing the structures featured traditional Qatari design and building methods including marazim wooden channels to drain rainwater during storms away from the building walls, a majilis room between the towers to receive guests, and four-layer roofs with \"danchal\" wood pole construction, basgijl, woven bamboo strips, mangrove mesh and a layer of compressed mud.\n\nHistory\nThe Barzan Towers were built in the late 19th century and were renovated by Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani in the early 20th century to serve as watchtowers against the incoming Ottoman soldiers. Although his father had defeated the Ottomans several years before in the Battle of Al Wajbah, Mohammed remained weary of renewed military tensions. They were also used by the native Qataris to scrutinize the new moon during the holy month of Ramadan, since keeping track of the moon was essential. The towers were restored in 2003 by the Qatari authorities.\n\nGeography\nThe Barzan Towers are situated on a low hill called Jebel Lusail in the town of Umm Salal Mohammed, in the municipality of Umm Salal that is about 10 km (6.2 mi) from the coast and 15 km (9.3 mi) north of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. On one side of the towers, huge, modern houses stand, while on the other are makeshift shacks. The former fortified house, sometimes referred to as castle, of Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani is located beside the towers. An oasis full of green trees, animals and palm trees can also be found behind the towers.\n\nStructure\nThe Barzan Towers have walls which are 1 metre (3.3 ft) thick at the base, and are further reinforced by buttresses. One tower has walls in the form of cones and a massive staircases in the other. These walls were built by first merging and blending overlapping raw pieces of coral stones with limestone and cementing the two with a mud mortar after, which is similar to the construction of the walls of Al Zubara Fort. The walls were then covered with a gypsum-based plaster once dry. The Barzan Towers have a roof that was built with four layers. The first layer is composed of a series of danchal wood poles, which were sometimes painted with bitumen for protection. The danchal poles were then covered by a layer of basgijl, a layer of woven bamboo strips. A carefully constructed net of mangrove branches was added, followed by a layer of compressed mud to protect the towers from the sun during the hot summers. The towers were also built with some external features such as a room for receiving guests, called majilis, which was built as an L-shaped pavilion with windows for ventilation, and a mosque which has a prayer room that was also used as a school for teaching the Quran to children, called madrassa. Traditional marazims protect the walls' surfaces and were built as wooden channels that stretch out from the roof to drain rainwater in case of storms. The marazims were built on top of the majilis and the mosque.\n\nGallery\nClick on the thumbnail to enlarge.\n\nSee also\nLusail\nAl Koot Fort\nZubarah Fort\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nVideo of Barzan Towers site\nQatar Museums Authority\nQatar Tourism Authority\nQatar Visitor",

At the present, it is designated as a major tourist destination for Qatar.\nKhor Al Adaid was officially designated as a nature reserve by the Qatari government in 2007. Qatar has proposed the site's inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list, but as of 2025, it remains on UNESCO's Tentative List.\n\nEtymology\nKhor is the Arabic term for \"creek\". The second constituent, adaid, derives from the Arabic root 'adad, referring to a number or multitude. In this context, the term refers to a group of households historically engaged in the craft of ship repair. Owing to this local expertise, pearl diving vessels would frequent the area to have their ships serviced.\n\nHistory\nSettlement and subsequent conflicts\nThe area of Khor Al Adaid was a point of friction between Qatar and polities in what is now Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Khor Al Adaid had served as a refuge for pirates from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (now part of the UAE) during the 19th century. Members of the Bani Yas tribe migrated and settled in the area on three separate occasions; 1835, 1849 and 1869. According to a historical overview of Khor Al Adaid written by the British government in India, \"in 1836, Al-Kubaisat, a section of the Bani-Yas, under Sheikh Khadim-bin-Nahman, being desirous of avoiding the consequences of certain recent piracies, seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves at Odeid. [...] In 1849, there was a fresh secession, followed by a second compulsory return; at length, in 1869, a party under Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim again settled at Odeid, and repudiated their allegiance to the parent State.\"\n\nAmong the settlers in 1835 was the pirate Jasim bin Jabir, who was joined there by his crew. The residents of eastern Qatar abetted the pirates of Khor Al Adaid in their pillaging of vessels off the coast of Abu Dhabi, resulting in a British naval force being sent to the settlement in 1836 to accost the piratical acts. The British ordered the chiefs of major Qatari towns to immediately desist from sending supplies to the pirates and instructed them to seize the pirate's boats. Additionally, the British naval force set fire to one of the pirate's vessels. As a result, Jassim bin Jabir relocated to Doha in September 1836.\nAfter receiving approval from the British in May 1837, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, wishing to punish the seceders, sent his troops to sack the settlement at Khor Al Adaid; 50 of its inhabitants were killed and its houses and fortifications were dismantled during the event. The British claimed that \"the leniency and moderation with which he [the Sheikh] used his victory induced the seceders to return to Abu Dhabi\".\nIn 1851, after arriving on the Qatari coast in preparation to invade Bahrain, the Saudi ruler Faisal bin Turki notified Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah, Maktoum bin Butti bin Suhail of Dubai, and Saeed bin Mutlaq Al-Mutairi that he was going to launch a massive reconstruction effort in Khor Al Adaid. \nIn 1869, the Bani Yas tribe once again seceded from Abu Dhabi to resettle in Khor Al Adaid under Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim. According to a description of Khor Al Adaid made sometime after this migration, the colony was inhabited by approximately 200 Bani Yas tribespeople who owned a total 30 pearling ships. The area was well protected, containing a small fort with two towers in the center of the town.\n\nOttoman control\nThe Qatari Peninsula came under Ottoman control in late 1871 after Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, recognized as ruler of the peninsula, agreed to Ottoman control in exchange for protection from the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Abu Dhabi and agreed to fly the Ottoman flag at his palace. In January 1872, Qatar was formally incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as a province in Najd with Sheikh Jassim being appointed its kaymakam (sub-governor). According to a British memorandum written in 1879 by Adolphus Warburton Moore, \"in August 1873 they [the Ottomans] were reported by the Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf to have established an influence over all the Guttur coast as far as the Odeid boundaries\".\nFor his part, Buttye-bin-Khadim, sheikh of the Bani Yas at Khor Al Adaid, refused to submit to Abu Dhabi, and stated that his people were in their own right at Odeid, and independent of both Qatar and the Ottomans. The territorial limits of the colony were declared to extend from Ras-al-Hala, midway to Wakrah in Qatar, continuously along the southern coast through Odeid to a point abreast of the island of Sir Bani Yas. He further claimed the island of Dalma and other islets within that circuit. He asserted that this territory constituted the ancient home of the Al-Kubaisat. He then admitted he had been offered the Turkish flag by Sheikh Jassim, but had refused it, saying he was under British protection. Communications between British officials reveal that rumors persisted that Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim flew the Ottoman flag on Fridays. These rumors were later found to be true, with future communiques confirming the occasional hoisting of the Ottoman flag in Khor Al Adaid.\nIn June 1873, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi wrote to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf requesting permission to launch a naval invasion of Khor Al Adaid, but was rejected by the British government. He requested permission again in November 1874, but was informed that the British government could not permit such a proceeding. This was despite his claims to have recently received letters from Ottoman local officials claiming that Khor Al Adaid was under their protection.\n\nPiracy incidents\nShortly after the peninsula came under Ottoman control, the British government reprimanded the Ottomans on numerous occasions for failing to prevent piratical acts from being carried out off Khor Al Adaid's coast. Adolphus Warburton Moore's memo states, \"During the summer of 1876 there was a marked increase of piratical acts along the Guttur coast.\" Select instances are given:\n\n\"In the month of August a rumour reached the Officiating Resident, to the effect that another party of the Beni Hajir had seized a boat belonging to the Oman pearl divers at Odeid.\"\n\"In the same month the Chief of Aboothabee complained that two of his boats, which had anchored in the Bay of Odeid, had been attacked from the shore, one man being wounded, and one killed.\"\n\"Again in August a section of the Beni Hajir, residing at Odeid, under the rule of Sheikh Salim bin Shafee, embarked from that port, and made an attack upon a boat belonging to Guttur, from which property to the value of $400 was plundered.\"\nThe British memo also mentions the 1869 defection of the Bani Yas tribe from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and subsequent resettlement of Khor Al Adaid. Discussing the Sheikh's response to their defection, the memo states:\n\nIn regard to these dissidents Colonel Prideaux wrote (16th September 1876): \"The Chief of Aboothabee, though naturally incensed at the defection of his tribesmen, has throughout behaved with praiseworthy moderation and forbearance; and although by frequent appeals to this Residency he continues to assert his claims upon Odeid, he has never attempted to enforce them by any act which might be deemed inconsistent with his treaty obligations.\" I do not doubt that if the question at issue were simply between the Chief of Aboothabee and his refractory tribesmen, it might be satisfactorily arranged without any great difficulty but it is to some degree complicated by the fact that the Chief of Odeid is in possession of a Turkish flag which he occasionally hoists, and under the protection of which it is believed that he would voluntarily place himself if any attempt were made to coerce him.\nIn addition to hoisting the Ottoman flag (alongside the Trucial flag), it was found that the Sheikh of Khor Al Adaid had been paying an annual tribute of 40 to 50 dollars to the Ottomans through Sheikh Jassim around 1877. Although Khor Al Adaid had likely been under Ottoman protection for two to three years by that point, aside from the small contingent of Ottoman officials who came to settle terms, there was no Ottoman presence in the village to speak of. This absence was mainly attributed to the area's limited potable water availability.\n\nBritish response to piracy\nThe British, after conducting an investigation into these so-called piratical acts, concluded that the culprits were not the Bani Hajer, but the Al Murrah tribe; and that the Sheikh of Khor Al Adaid had not been implicated, but that \"he was too weak to prevent his ports being made use of\". Colonel Prideaux, who was the acting Persian Gulf Resident in Edward Charles Ross' absence, suggested that the British should facilitate a reconciliation between the Bani Yas in Khor Al Adaid and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi so that the area, including its territorial waters, would fall under the umbrella of British protection. He claimed that, should this prove unsuccessful, the British government would do well to provide assistance to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in exercising his authority over the land, by force if necessary. He predicted that the Ottomans would not intervene.\nAfter much deliberation, the British Government concurred with Colonel Prideaux's view and empowered the Resident to use his best endeavors to promote a reunion between the colonists at Khor Al Adaid and the main body of the Bani Yas tribe of Abu Dhabi, and further authorized him \"to afford assistance, if necessary, to the Trucial Chief of Abuthabi in coercing the seceders.\" The British Government established the following facts regarding the piracy:\n\nThat the acts of piracy complained of were committed by members of the Al Murrah tribe, a tribe nominally dependent on the Ottoman Government.\nThat the pirates proceeded on their expedition from ports belonging to the Chief of Khor Al Adaid.\nThat the Chief of Khor Al Adaid in no way countenanced or assisted the use of his ports as a starting place for piratical expeditions.\nThat the reason why the Chief of Khor Al Adaid was too weak to prevent the piracy was due to his and his follower's secession from the Bani Yas tribe inhabiting Abu Dhabi.\nThat the reason why the Chief of Abu Dhabi has not yet invaded Khor Al Adaid is, that he has been prevented from so doing by the British Government.\nAccompanying these findings were two directives issued by the British Government:\n\nThat endeavours be made to induce the Ottoman Government to take measures to restrain the piratical proceedings of the Al Murrah tribe; and\nThat measures be taken by the Royal Navy to prevent the ports of Khor Al Adaid from being used as a rendezvous for pirates.\nThe British Government also instructed their liaison to the Ottomans, the British Ambassador in Constantinople Austen Henry Layard, to relay to the Ottoman Government the need to send forces to the weaker Sheikhs in Qatar so that they could subvert piracy in their ports, but the liaison was advised not to make any reference to Khor Al Adaid, \"because it was doubtful whether the Turkish Government exercised any substantial authority over the Chief of that place, and it was inexpedient to provoke a discussion on the point.\" In June 1877, yet another act of piracy was committed by ships belonging to Khor Al Adaid upon sailors from Al Wakrah, several of whom were captured. Following the incident, Colonel Prideaux wrote to Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim of Khor Al Adaid warning him to accept reunification with the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi, otherwise \"other steps will be taken\", while also writing to Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi to reassure him of British support for his efforts to preside over the settlement at Khor Al Adaid.\nIn the aftermath of the piracy in June, Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim, while admitting his men forcibly captured sailors from Al Wakrah, did not comply with British demands to release the prisoners. Thus, in October 1877, Colonel Prideaux recommended sending warships to Khor Al Adaid as punishment for violating the Perpetual Maritime Truce, unless its inhabitants submit to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's rule. Edward Charles Ross informed the British Government in December that attempts at reconciliation between Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim were met without success.\n\nInvasion and destruction\nIn 1878, it was reported that the British Government and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had made a plan to invade Khor Al Adaid, supposedly to curtail the piracy of its inhabitants. In response, Sheikh Jassim threatened to occupy Khor Al Adaid, as he had perceived the proposed military excursion to be in violation of Qatar's territorial integrity. Climatically, a massive invasion of Khor Al Adaid was launched by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in concert with the British in 1879. Recounting the incident, British records state that:\n\nSir A. Layard [Austen Henry Layard], writing on the 28th May, reported that Sadık Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, had read to him a telegram from the Wali of Basra, complaining that Zaid-bin-Khalifa, with 70 boats and accompanied by an English war steamer and the British Consul at Bushire, had attacked Odeid, which he described as a dependency of the Turkish district of Catar (El-Katr). The inhabitants having fled, the village was pillaged and destroyed, and all the boats carried off. The Porte hoped that some explanation would be afforded of this descent upon Turkish territory. Lord Cranbrook, to whom the papers were referred, declined to give any detailed expression of opinion until he had consulted the Government of India; but in the meantime he drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the correspondence of 1877, in which the India Office recommended that a discussion with the Porte in regard to the status of Odeid should, if possible, be avoided.\nIn 1881, Sheikh Jassim once again announced to the Political Resident his intention to occupy Khor Al Adaid in order to re-inhabit it and to defend Qatar from pirates and naval invasions. After being reminded that the territory was under the protection of the British, he rescinded his plans. On 31 August 1886, it was reported that Sheikh Jassim and several of his followers departed Doha to settle Khor Al Adaid. He was warned against his plan by a British official, and the Royal Navy dispatched a vessel to prevent him from advancing. Eventually, he returned to Doha without establishing a settlement in Khor Al Adaid.\nIn April 1889, Sheikh Jassim sent a letter to the Wali of Basra in which he reported that Sheikh Zayed was preparing to invade Qatar and pleaded for support, claiming that Sheikh's Zayed's forces numbered close to 20,000 troops while he could barely muster 4,000 troops. Although the Wali believed that Sheikh Jassim was inflating figures for his own gain, he instructed Akif Pasha, Mutasarrıf of Najd Sanjak, to take preventative measures in Qatar by reinforcing Khor Al Adaid with 500 men. Before the troops were dispatched, Akif Pasha was summoned to Basra in August 1888 to discuss administrative reforms in Bahrain and Qatar with the Wali. During the meeting, Akif Pasha recommended appointing a mudir to Khor Al Adaid with a salary of 750 kurushes and a gendarmerie force. He claimed that this, along with other steps taken by the Porte, would result in the establishment of a thriving village in Khor Al Adaid which could potentially generate large amounts of tax revenue. Furthermore, he stated, such measures would help repel foreign incursions. However, the prime underlying motive behind these reforms were to reduce British influence in the Persian Gulf. After these decisions were written into a bill by the Council of Ministers, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, having received the bill on 13 January 1890, signed it into effect on 2 February 1890.\n\nResettlement attempts by the Ottomans and Sheikh Jassim\nBy 1890 news had broken about the newly commissioned project by the Ottomans to rebuild Khor Al Adaid. The British grew concerned over this as an Ottoman settlement in what they considered territory of Abu Dhabi would be exceedingly difficult to disperse through diplomatic means. In British political circles, rumors were circulating in January 1891 that the Ottomans had installed mudirs (governors) in Khor Al Adaid and north-bound Zubarah, and that 400 Ottoman troops were en route to garrison the towns. These rumors are confirmed by declassified communications between the Wali of Basra and the Office of the Grand Vizier exchanged in mid-January.\nIn February 1891, the British learnt that Sheikh Jassim, under the aegis of the Ottomans, had returned to his plans of occupying Khor Al Adaid. He reportedly asked around 40 members of the Kubaisat tribe living in Al Wakrah to settle in Khor Al Adaid in an attempt to rebuild the village. The tribe replied that they were willing to adhere to this proposal, provided that one of Jassim's sons serves as their sheikh, as most of the tribe members refused to live under an Ottoman governor. At the same time, Sheikh Jassim was under pressure by the Ottomans to agree to their proposals to install administrative officials at Khor Al Adaid and Zubarah and to establish a customs house at Al Bidda. While he was not overtly concerned about the first proposal as he had not yet found willing participants to resettle these two places, he vehemently opposed the establishment of an Ottoman customs house in Qatar. All prospects of resettling Khor Al Adaid were abandoned when Sheikh Jassim, unsatisfied with the increasing usurpation of control by the Ottomans, resigned as kaymakam of Qatar in August 1892. This culminated in the Battle of Al Wajbah in March 1893 in which Sheikh Jassim's forces defeated the Ottomans troops stationed in Doha, resulting in a downsizing of Ottoman presence in the peninsula.\n\nResettlement proposal by Sheikh Zayed\nSheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi and Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, held a meeting in October 1903 in which they discussed the rebuilding and resettlement of Khor Al Adaid. In January 1904, the Assistant Political Agent in Bahrain received a letter from Sheikh Zayed regarding the same topic:\n\nThe rebuilding of Odeid will have a detrimental effect on Al Bidda and Wakra, from which places it will draw some of their residents. Odeid possesses one of the most secure harbours for native craft on this side of the Persian Gulf. It will become a centre for the pearl trade in that region much to the disadvantage of Al Bidda which now has a large share of the trade on account of its proximity to the central pearl banks. A new market will be opened for our enterprising British Indians who would probably share in the Katr pearl trade which is now exclusively in the hands of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani and his nephews. The port is situated about thirty miles nearer to Bahrein than to Abu Dhabi for sailing vessels, so that possibly it will draw some of its supplies from Bahrein. And finally it will put an effectual stop to Turkish pretensions to it.\nThe extra responsibility devolving upon His Majesty’s Government by the venture may be described as nominal only. After the severe check received by the Turks in their attempt on Bahrein in 1895 they will hardly lay themselves open again to any similar demoralizing rebuff by instigating the Katr Arabs to attack Odeid by sea and should they be so ill-advised as to do so, the Arabs of that region are not likely to listen to them after what they experienced on the occasion referred to. The only other danger is that it may be open to attack from the land side by raiding Bedouins. The nearest water-supply accessible to an hostile party is in the vicinity of Wajba about fifty miles away, so that an attempt would be attended with serious risks, the contingency is therefore remote in the extreme.\nSheikh Zayed wrote to the Political Resident, also in 1904, asking for permission to reoccupy Khor Al Adaid. He received a negative response from the British, according to a communique written by Assistant Secretary to the Government of India R. E. Holland which stated \"that while the Government of India are prepared to prevent the place being occupied by anyone other than himself, they are not disposed under present conditions to assist him in reoccupying it.\"\n\nOttoman administrative reforms\nMore than thirty years after the Ottomans established a protectorate in the Qatari Peninsula, they designated four administrative districts (nehiye) on the peninsula in December 1902, with Khor Al Adaid (simply referred to as Adide by the Porte) being among them. Ottoman sources allege that this was in response to British disturbance of the nomadic tribespeople in Qatar by installing numerous poles in the peninsula, including five in Zubarah and Khor Al Adaid. The British officially protested and refused to recognize Ottoman jurisdiction over the peninsula, especially over Khor Al Adaid. They demanded that the Ottomans not station administrative officials in these districts, to which the Ottomans promised they would comply. However, by early 1903, the Ottomans had already appointed the first mudir – Yusuf Effendi in Al Wakrah.\nAbdülkarim Vefik Efendi (known to British intelligence as Agha Abdul Karim bin Agha Hasan), a former tax official in Qatif, was the mudir-designate for Khor Al Adaid. In March 1903, British sources indicated that the mudir-designate was reassigned elsewhere. According to Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Abdülkarim Efendi requested a reassignment from the Mutasarrıf of al-Hasa after being made aware of the desolateness of Khor Al Adaid. Abdülkarim Efendi stated, according to Kemball, that a mudir of Kurdish origins had been assigned in his place and was awaiting orders in Basra. Amidst heavy pressure from the British to rescind their assignment of government officials in Qatar, the Porte abolished all its mudir posts on the peninsula in 1904.\nIt was reported that in August 1910, the Ottomans had again assigned a mudir in the peninsula, this time to the Khor Al Adaid district. British intelligence identified the mudir as Sulaiman Effendi. A British government official deemed this move \"a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty over the neighbourhood of El Katr\" and was instructed to hand in a written protest pointing out that \"El Odeid is in the territory of one of the Trucial Chiefs who are under the protection of His Majesty’s Government”. However, when HMS Redbreast was sent to inspect Khor Al Adaid later that year, it found no evidence of an Ottoman mudir.\n\nLater Ottoman period\nA brief description of Khor Al Adaid is given in 1910 by W. Graham Greene:\n\nInformation about this locality is very meagre. Anchorage is reported to exist in from six to ten fathoms close to the shore of the northern entrance point of Khor al Odeid, which is described as a winding inlet five miles in length opening out into a lagoon about five miles long and three miles wide. Landing from boats would probably be easy on the shore of the inlet and lagoon, the depths of which vary considerably.\"\n\nJ. G. Lorimer's comprehensive Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, published in 1908 and 1915 as a handbook for British political agents, offers a more complete account of Khor Al Adaid:\n\nIn English formerly known as \"Khore Alladeid.\" An inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi Principality at its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles, almost due west, from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet. [...]\nThere are now no permanent inhabitants at 'Odaid, and it is not visited by Bedouins from the interior; but fishermen from Abu Dhabi spend some months here in winter, and fine mullet are caught by them. A village occupied by seceders from Abu Dhabi; of the Qubaisat section of the Bani Yas, has existed at Odaid at various times. The village was situated on the south side of the creek at a short distance from the entrance and consisted of about 100 houses: the inhabitants lived by fishing and obtained their drinking water from 4 wells which were less than a mile from the place and contained brackish water at 2 fathoms below the surface; they had no dates or cultivation. Prior to 1866 the defenses of this village consisted of a fort with two towers, of 7 other detached towers, and of blockhouses protecting the wells. The settlement was finally abandoned in 1880.\n\nLater 20th century\nThroughout the 20th century, Khor Al Adaid was the focus of border disputes between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The UAE Emirate of Abu Dhabi desired to have a border with Qatar here, but it was agreed in 1974 that Khor Al Adaid should border Saudi Arabia instead. However, that did not stop the issue from continuing into the 21st century, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia holding another discussion regarding Khor Al Adaid and their borders in 2005.\n\n21st century\nIn November 2021, Saudi Arabia and Qatar demarcated the Qatar–Saudi Arabia border and Qatar was given access to the entirety of Khor Al Adaid by moving the border further south.\n\nGeography\nKhor Al Adaid is located in the southwestern extremity of Qatar in Al Wakrah Municipality. It forms the southern boundary of the southern desert region, which occupies 34.7% of Qatar's total area. Of the four sub-regions of the southern desert, Khor Al Adaid is a part of the sand dunes sub-group. The area is characterized by uneven terrain and sand dunes reaching heights of 38 metres (125 ft) to 67 metres (220 ft).\nIn terms of regional geography, Khor Al Adaid makes up a part of the broader Trucial Coast region, characterized by shallow, evaporative environments where carbonate sediments actively form. The area's coastal landscape is diverse, featuring sabkhas and tidal flats along the shoreline, with land-attached beaches and southward-prograding spits. Moving seaward, the environment transitions to open-marine subtidal sediments rich in mollusc remains. The eastern Qatar coastline also hosts isolated coral reef banks and ooid deposits. Unlike much of the Trucial Coast, where onshore winds prevail, Khor Al Adaid experiences predominantly offshore winds. This wind pattern influences the local geography, allowing quartz-rich eolian dunes to move towards the shoreline. Consequently, the coastal deposits in the Khor Al Adaid area primarily comprise siliciclastic sand, with small amounts of carbonate shell material.\nThe khor (inlet) at Khor Al Adaid consists of a winding channel, 9.7 km (6 miles) long, which runs inland in a south-westerly direction; within it opens out into a lagoon 9.7 km (6 miles) long from north-north-east to south-south-west and 4.8 km (3 miles) wide. The lagoon contains soundings of as much as 6 fathoms; but ordinary vessels on account of reefs, cannot approach within 4.8 km (3 miles) of the entrance of the khor. A ridge of stony hills, 91 m (300 feet) high on the south side of the entrance, is called Jabal Al 'Odaid; and on the north side of the creek, overlooking it, are sand hills known as Niqa Al Maharaf. Niqa Al Maharaf forms the southern extremity of a narrow range of high white sand hills skirting the coast known as Naqiyan, with the northern extremity going by the name Naqiyan Abu Qasbatain.\nIn a 2010 survey of Khor Al Adaid's coastal waters conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority, it was found that its average depth was 4 meters (13 ft) and its average pH was 7.93. The waters had a salinity of 57.09 psu, an average temperature of 26.13 °C (79 °F) and 6.02 mg/L of dissolved oxygen.\n\nNature reserve\nThe UNESCO-recognized Khor Al Adaid Reserve is Qatar's largest nature reserve. Also known by its English name Inland Sea, the area was declared a nature reserve in 2007 and occupies an area of approximately 1,833 km2 (708 sq mi). Historically, the area was used for camel grazing by nomads, and is still used for the same purpose to a lesser extent. Various flora and fauna are supported in its ecosystem, such as ospreys, dugongs and turtles. The appearance and the quick formation of its sabkhas is distinct from any other system of sabkhas, as is the continuous infilling of its lagoon.\n\nTourism\nKhor Al Adaid's beach is a popular tourist attraction in Qatar. The most common routes to the beach are via Mazrat Turaina and Mesaieed.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2010 census, the settlement comprised 14 housing units and 4 establishments. There were 42 people living in the settlement, of which all were male. Out of the 42 inhabitants, all were 20 years of age or older. The literacy rate stood at 64.3%.\nEmployed people made up the entire population.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKhawr al Udayd at Geographic.org",

          "content": "Al Wakrah (Arabic: الوكرة, romanized: al-Wakra) is the capital city of the Al Wakrah Municipality in Qatar. Al Wakrah's eastern edge touches the shores of the Persian Gulf and Qatar's capital Doha is situated immediately north of the city. Governed by Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, it was originally a small fishing and pearling village. Over the years, it evolved into a small city with a population of more than 80,000 and is currently one of Qatar's most populous cities.\nThe city was historically used as a pearling center during the period in which Qatar's economy was almost entirely dependent on the bustling pearling industry. According to the United States Hydrographic Office, by 1920, there were approximately 300 ships situated in the town. A following study carried out by the British in 1925 stated that there were 250 boats in Wakrah's port. Al Wakrah was thought to encompass the so-called 'Pirate Coast', as stated by a report written in 1898. Once the country began large-scale oil operations in the mid-20th century, Al Wakrah became more important due to its proximity to the Mesaieed Industrial Area, Qatar's main industrial manufacturing hub and oil terminal.\nIt has undergone extensive development and growth since the turn of the 21st century while also being steadily encroached on by rapidly expanding Doha from the north. Notable milestones in the city's modern history include the 2019 inauguration of Al Janoub Stadium, a venue for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the opening of Souq Al Wakrah in 2014, the Al Wakrah Main Road Project, and the city's integration into the Doha Metro's Red Line in 2019.\n\nEtymology\nThe city's name derives from the Arabic word wakar (lit. 'bird's nest'). According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, this name was given in reference to a nearby hill (likely Jebel Al Wakrah) which accommodated the nests of several birds.\n\nHistory\nFormation\nArnold Burrowes Kemball, a British Political Resident, wrote with reference to Al Wakrah in 1845, providing significant historical context for the town's establishment. According to Kemball's account, Al Wakrah did not exist at the time of Persian Gulf resident John MacLeod's 1822 survey of Qatar's east coast. He states that the town was founded by Ali bin Nasir, chief of the Ajman tribe, who had previously resided in Al Bidda (modern Doha). Following a dispute with the Bahraini ruler, Ali bin Nasir and his followers faced the destruction of their dwellings in Al Bidda and the threat of forcible relocation to Bahrain. To evade this punitive measure, they established their new settlement at the foot of Jebel Al Wakrah. Architectural evidence suggests that Al Wakrah may have served as the first urban centre of Qatar.\n\nAl Khalifa rule\nIn 1851, the Battle of Mesaimeer took place in Mesaimeer, to the west of Al Wakrah. The conflict primarily involved Qatari forces led by Mohammed bin Thani and Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, then under Bahraini suzerainty, against the invading army of Faisal bin Turki, Imam of Emirate of Nejd, who was seeking to stage his third invasion attempt of Bahrain from the peninsula. Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces, nominally allied with Qatar, remained largely uninvolved in the fighting. The battle lasted from 2 June to 4 June of that year, with the Qatari leader Mohammed bin Thani agreeing to a separate peace agreement with Faisal bin Turki, angering his former Bahraini allies.\nOn 25 July, 1851, a peace agreement was reached between the Bahrainis and Wahhabis. The resulting accord stipulated that Ali bin Khalifa would pay 4,000 German krones annually as zakat to Faisal, while the latter agreed to restore Al Bidda Fort to Ali bin Khalifa and to abstain from interference in Qatari affairs or on behalf of Abdullah bin Ahmed's sons. However, the chief of Al Wakrah, Rashid bin Faddal, objected to this agreement, preferring to stay under Wahhabi rule. As a result, he left Qatar, migrating to the coast of Fars.\nIn 1863, the Bahraini ruler Muhammad bin Khalifa sent his cousin Mohammed bin Ahmed to act as deputy emir of Qatar. The Qataris soon compelled him to return to Bahrain after he arrested and deported the ruler of Al Wakrah, as well as many other notables from the town to Bahrain. The incident was reported by the Acting Political Resident in a dispatch dated 13 April 1863. According to the dispatch, the reason given for the evacuation was to eliminate a haven for debtors and disreputable characters who were perceived as detrimental to trade and peace in the region.\nIn 1866, an event known as the Al Wakrah Incident occurred. Bahrain arrested a Qatari Bedouin of the Na'im tribe in Al Wakrah market and deported him to Bahrain. The caravan, preparing for the customary pearl diving expedition, was attacked and its goods confiscated. When resistance was offered, the Na'im leader, Ali bin Thamer, was apprehended and sent to Bahrain. Upon his arrival, he was incarcerated.\nIn 1867, the Na'im tribal elders appealed to Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani for assistance, recognizing his growing influence and reputation for justice. Jassim mobilized a general levy of Qatari forces and marched on Al Wakrah, seeking to apprehend the Bahraini representative Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, who took shelter in Al Wakrah Fort. The besieging forces intensified their efforts to the point where they nearly captured the fortress. Lacking sufficient defensive capabilities, Ahmed was compelled to flee to Al Khuwayr, a location in the northern part of mainland Qatar, from where he dispatched a message to the ruler of Bahrain reporting the events.\n\nQatari–Bahraini War\nIn an act of deception, the Al Khalifa then lured Jassim to Bahrain in 1867, by writing a letter admonishing the Bahraini representative assuring him that no ill will was harbored towards Jassim. He also released the Na'im chief, Ali bin Thamer. However, upon his arrival, he was imprisoned. Following this, Muhammad bin Khalifa assembled a naval fleet to raid Qatar, sparking the Qatari–Bahraini War.\nBahrain succeeded in gaining support from Abu Dhabi, as Doha and Al Wakrah have long been harbors of refuge for Omani seceders, and launched a naval assault. As a result, Al Wakrah, along with neighboring Doha, was sacked by the combined Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces that year in an incident commonly known as the Second Destruction of Doha. A British record later stated \"the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\".\n\nIn June 1868, the Qataris attempted to launch a counterattack against the Bahrainis, but, were defeated in the Battle of Damsah. The aftermath of the Battle of Damsah saw the Qatari forces execute a strategic withdrawal, prompting a pursuit by Bahraini troops to Al Wakrah. At this location, the Qatari contingent mounted a defense in the Battle of Jebel Wakrah, successfully encircling the Bahraini forces and capturing two of their commanders. The engagement concluded with a negotiated exchange of prisoners, following which Jassim bin Mohammed returned to his seat of power in Doha.\nAs a result of the war, in 1868, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Pelly, the British Resident in Bahrain, issued a warrant for a Mohammed bin Khalifa's arrest and effectively deposed him as hakim of Bahrain. Pelly traveled to Al Wakrah, where he met with Mohammed bin Thani and signed a landmark agreement in which the British recognized the Al Thani as the rulers of Qatar.\n\nOttoman rule (1871–1916)\n19th century\nAlmost immediately after Qatar succumbed to Ottoman control, Major Ömer Bey compiled a report on the major towns in the peninsula. The article, published in January 1872, reflected on the depopulation of Al Wakrah resulting from the war by estimating a meager population of 400 while approximating the town's fleet at 50 ships. Abu Al-Qassim Munshi, a British resident in Qatar, wrote a memo regarding the districts of Qatar in 1872. In it, he mentions that \"in the year 1218 [1803 in the Gregorian calendar], Al Wakrah was ruled by the Al-Boo-Aynain tribe\", although J. G. Lorimer claims that the Al Buainain tribe migrated to Al Wakrah from Ar Ru'ays and Fuwayrit sometime after 1828.\nIn 1885, a group of 100 Al Wakra natives from the Al-Buainain and Al-Jehran tribes left the town and settled at Al Ghariyah due to a dispute with Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani. A coalition, led by Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab, was formed to resist Sheikh Jassim. A meeting was summoned between Sheikh Jassim and Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab and the discussion was mediated by an Ottoman commander of an Al Bidda-situated gunboat. The Ottoman commander's proposal that the coalition be left alone infuriated Sheikh Jassim. This incited tribesmen loyal to Sheikh Jassim to attack Al Ghariyah, but they were defeated, with the Bani Hajer tribe suffering a few casualties.\nIn August 1887, during the Qatari–Abu Dhabi War, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi lodged a formal complaint with British authorities regarding a maritime incident involving Qatari vessels. According to Zayed's account, a baghlah originating from Al Wakrah allegedly engaged in acts of piracy. The vessel was reported to have first plundered a Bahraini boat in the vicinity of Ashat Island. Subsequently, the same vessel approached a baghlah crewed by members of the Qubaisi tribe, who were engaged in pearl diving activities. The report states that the Qubaisi divers, unaware of the impending threat, were caught off guard. The aggressors opened fire on the Qubaisi vessel, resulting in the death of a crew member identified as Ashkan. Zayed attributed this act of aggression to the instigation of Jassim bin Mohammed, the de facto ruler of Qatar, and Ali bin Rashid of Al Wakrah.\nA British survey conducted on the area in 1890 asserted that the town, still suffering from the effects of the 1867 war, had since been rebuilt. The surveyors wrote that the Al Wakrah had 12 forts, at least 1,000 inhabitants, and several boats. Jebel Al Wakrah, an 26 m (85 ft) high rocky hill, was noted 1 mi (1.6 km) south of the town.\n\n20th century\nA conflict occurred off the coast of Al Wakrah in 1900 between individuals of the Al Bin Ali tribe and Amamara tribe after a fleet of Amamara vessels were blown into the Al Bin Ali's ships by strong winds. A relative of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani defused the situation after the initial exchange of gunfire and no casualties were recorded. Nonetheless, the British Political Resident arrived in Al Wakrah that year and issued a 1,000 rupee fine to the Al Bin Ali tribe after his investigation found them guilty.\nAt the end of 1902, the Ottomans installed Ottoman administrative officials in Al Wakrah and Zubarah in an attempt to assert their authority. This was in addition to the already existing Ottoman administrative officials in Doha. An Ottoman, Yusuf Bey, was appointed as Mudir of Al Wakrah in the spring of 1903. Due to British discontent, Yusuf Bey's appointment was short-lived, and he was later called to act as the assistant Kaymakam of Qatar and did not return to Al Wakrah. Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani was appointed as Mudir by the Ottomans in place of Yusuf Bey the same year. This elicited fresh protests by the British government, who refused the Ottoman's rights to appoint any administrative official in Qatar. In November 1904, the Ottomans abolished the post altogether upon further urging by the British.\n\nFrom December 1907, there was a series of disputes between the governor, Sheikh Abdulrahman, and the Al-Buainain tribe. The Al-Buainain tribe had objected to paying the annual boat tax, and in reprisal, the sheikh fined the tribe 10,000 Qatari riyals and expelled 6 of the tribe's leaders. As retribution, one of the tribe leader's sons attempted to shoot Sheikh Abdulrahman. His attempt was foiled, and he was imprisoned; however, he was later forgiven and released in return for the payment of the tax. The Al Buainains later sent an envoy, Ahmed bin Khater, to the Ottomans in Basra to request that a military garrison be erected in Al Wakrah to help accost the sheikh of Qatar, Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani. The envoy returned with two letters from the Ottomans addressed to Jassim bin Mohammed. A fortnight later, the Al-Buainain tribe appealed to a Mutasarrıf of Al-Hasa, Mahir Pasha. This reinvigorated tensions between the British and the Ottomans due to the British perception that this provided the Ottomans an opportunity to exert more authority over the Qatar Peninsula.\nBritish diplomat J. G. Lorimer describes Al Wakrah in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia, first published in 1908. His account states that the town accommodated 250 houses and had a population of roughly 1,000. It was said to be located 10 mi (16 km) away from one of Qatar's primary pearling villages, Al Bidda. The records also stated that the town's original inhabitants were migrants from Al Bidda. Al Wakrah was described as \"independent of Bidda and other towns; and as thriving and more cheerful in appearance than Bidda, to which it was equal in size\".\n\nBritish protectorate (1916–1971)\nA British survey carried out in 1925 recounts Al Wakrah in exhaustive detail. Concerning the infrastructure and borders, it asserts that most houses in Al Wakrah were made of mud and stone, as no other building materials were available. The town originally formed a compact block, but in the preceding years a detached quarter known as Rumailah sprung up about 800 yards (730 m) northward. There were 8,000 inhabitants at the time of the census, with 2,000 individuals belonging to the Al-Buainain tribe, 1,500 Huwala people, 850 members of the Al-Khulaifat tribe, 1,000 black Africans, and 2,000 black African slaves. Other ethnic groups and tribes comprised the remaining 650 inhabitants. The Al-Khulaifat and Al-Maadeed tribes were described as being the sole inhabitants of the Rumailah quarter. The report also described the inhabitants of Al Wakrah as primarily being pearl divers, sailors, and fishermen. It further reported Al Wakrah as being a market place with 75 shops.\n\nPost declaration of independence\nAfter Qatar became independent  in 1971, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani assumed control of the state in February 1972. One of his main policies was the decentralization of Qatar's housing and major infrastructure projects. To promote growth outside of Doha, in 1972 he ordered the construction of a jetty and approach channel in Al Wakrah. \nThe city's first park, Al Wakrah Public Park, was completed during the mid-1980s. Furthermore, during the 1980s, the Municipal Council of Al Wakrah Municipality initiated major beach clean-ups, the construction of new roundabouts, and the naming of unmarked streets. In March 1986, the Ministry of Public Works signed a deal to build a secondary school for boys in Al Wakrah at a cost of QR 12.9 million.\nAn urban development plan was enacted in Al Wakrah in 2008. The most prominent features of this plan were the development of Al Wakra Beach, the development of the city center, and the expansion of the southern portion of the city. The plan's main purpose was to improve the infrastructure in order to accommodate more than 600,000 residents.\nAl Janoub Stadium, a retractable-roof football stadium and was inaugurated on 16 May 2019. This was the second of the eight stadiums built for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, after the renovation of Khalifa International Stadium. It was designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid (1950–2016) together with the firm AECOM.\nAt a press conference held at the Ministry of Education in September 2017, it was announced that Al Wakrah joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities, becoming the first Qatari city to do so. Al Wakra received the UNESCO Learning City Award in 2021 for its provision of educational opportunities to its residents. The city was also recognized for the formation of a Worker's Support and Insurance Fund, sustainability and recycling programs, and a workers' education program in which free personal computers were allocated.\n\nGeography\nAl Wakrah is a coastal city with the Persian Gulf to its immediate east and is approximately 15 km (9.3 mi) south of the capital Doha. \nIn a 2010 survey of Al Wakrah's coastal waters conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority, it was found that its average depth was a shallow 2.25 meters (7 ft 5 in) and its average pH was 7.95. The waters had a salinity of 49.14 psu, an average temperature of 22.78 °C (73.00 °F) and 6.6 mg/L of dissolved oxygen.\nAl Wakra's coastline features distinctive geological formations dating back to the Quaternary period. Prominent among these are ridges composed of cemented calcareous sandstone, colloquially termed calcarenite, and limestone exhibiting a pseudo-oolitic structure. These formations, presenting as modest escarpments or low-lying ridges, are parallel to the shoreline. Similar lithological structures are observable at various points along Qatar's coast, including the vicinities of Fuwayrit and Al Ghariyah. Geological evidence suggests these features were sculpted during a previous interglacial epoch, when ocean levels were higher.\n\nNear Jebel Al Wakrah, the coastline's topography is characterized by the presence of relict coastal dunes composed of eolianite, a sedimentary rock formed by the lithification of wind-deposited sand. These geological formations, now manifesting as low-relief hills, date back to the Late Pleistocene epoch, coinciding with a period of lower eustatic sea levels.\n\nAl Wakrah Spit\nThe Al Wakrah Spit is a sandy, narrow spit that extends approximately 2.5 km (1.6 mi) into the Persian Gulf, forming a natural barrier. Historically, the spit was connected to the mainland at its northern extremity. However, subsequent coastal dynamics led to its separation from the shore by 1973. The morphology of the spit is characterized by two distinct inlets that bisect its length, creating a series of sandy ridges. The spit's evolution is primarily governed by the dominant north-westerly wind, locally referred to as the shamal. This prevailing atmospheric current generates wave fronts in a north-to-south direction, shaping the spit's form and orientation.\nTo the west of the spit lies a lagoon, nestled between the natural formation and the artificially modified coastline of Al Wakrah. This protected body of water experiences a tidal range typical of the eastern Qatar coast, averaging between 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in) and 1 metre (3 ft 3 in). The offshore area adjacent to the spit is characterized by sand banks, formed through the action of longshore currents.\nThe sedimentary composition of the spit and its environs comprises a heterogeneous mixture of white oolitic sand, shell fragments, and detritus from coral reefs. Occasional storm events result in wave overtopping, depositing sand onto the muddy substrate of the sheltered lagoonal area to the west.\n\nWildlife\nCommon vegetation found in Al Wakrah include horbith (Leobordea platycarpa), jrnah (Monsonia heliotropioides), woolly-winged milkwort (Polygala erioptera) evening stock (Matthiola longipetala), kebaisha (Erodium glaucophyllum), and lomi albar (Atractylis carduus). Other common flora found around the area of Jebel Al Wakrah are rigid flax (Linum strictum) and barseem (Hymenocarpos circinnatus). \nIn the 1980s, Al Wakrah saw the afforestation of the mangrove species Avicennia marina as part of a broader initiative to prevent coastal erosion and habitat loss along Qatar's coastline. The seedlings planted in Al Wakrah and other coastal areas have since grown into thriving forests. Roughly 112 hectares (280 acres) of mangroves are found off Al Wakrah's coast as of 2015.\nIn the southern region of Al Wakrah, honey badgers (locally al zerembal) have been observed.\n\nClimate\nSimilar to other cities in Qatar, Al Wakrah has a mild average temperature in January, February, March, November and December. The summer season is in April, May, June, July, August, September, October and November. Al Wakrah has dry periods in January, February, March, April, May, June, July and August. On average, the warmest month is July and the coolest month is January.\n\nHistoric architecture\nHistoric architecture is abundant in Al Wakrah, particularly in its coastal areas, and it is captured in mosques, old homes, and the harbour. One significant landmark is the Al Wakrah Fort, which dates back to the early 20th century. It was built above the ruins of an older fort that had belonged to the Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. It has two round towers and was previously used as a police office. Date presses (known locally as madabis) were discovered within the confines of the Al Wakrah Fort. Strategically constructed with military objectives in mind, these madabis served as vital nutritional reservoirs for soldiers amidst extended periods of political turbulence. More historic wind towers are found in the city than in anywhere else on the peninsula.\n\nHouses\nThe house of Sheikh Ghanim Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, located on the beach, is considered to be an important historic landmark. This building has two storeys and its windows were designed to represent ornamental shapes. It was refurbished in 2004 under the supervision of the Restoration Departments of Qatar Museums Authority (QMA). Still-preserved madabis (date presses) were found here.\nAbdullah bin Saad House, formerly owned by Abdullah bin Saad Al Mutallaq, is located in a remote section on the south-east coast of the city and is considered to be a historic landmark. The house was constructed in the early 20th century; most likely around 1920. After the municipality assumed ownership of the house in 1984, it was renovated two years later and eventually re-opened as a museum.\n\nMosques\nPreviously, Al Wakrah's largest mosque was Al Ayouni Mosque, constructed around 1935. It was built near the coast because it was the most active and populated section of the city. After a new mosque was built closer to the main road, the mosque became defunct. It has a square shape, measures 17 by 16 m (56 by 52 ft), and lies 67 cm (26 in) above ground elevation. A rare characteristic of the mosque is its single entrance on the east side; a majority of other mosques in Qatar constructed during this period had three entrances. The outdoor praying area is accessible from five pathways separated by narrow columns. Adjacent to this is the prayer hall, which can be accessed from three different entrances in the outdoor area.\nAbu Manaratain Mosque, a relatively small mosque, was erected in 1940 near the shore. It may have previously had two minarets, as its name indicates. It measures 8 by 27 m (26 by 89 ft). In the past, there was another mosque that neighbored Abu Manaratain on the west, but it was later disassembled. There are five entrances to the mosque. The minaret is funnel-shaped and extends 9 m (30 ft) high. There is no outdoor praying area; only an indoor prayer hall.\nBuilt around 1940, the Al Subaiei Mosque, near Al Wakrah Museum, has since been renovated, with older building materials being replaced by concrete blocks. It has been used continuously since its construction. As a result of continuous additions and structural improvements, it now measures 13 by 22 m (43 by 72 ft). The minaret has a square base and extends 5.5 m (18 ft) metres high.\n\nDevelopments\nAl Wakrah Development Project\nIn 2008, municipal officials released their master plan for the development of Al Wakrah. Future plans were to heavily reflect on the city's historic pearling tradition. Developments were said to include a continuous public waterfront, a water park, a golf course, a maritime museum, several hotels and a cultural center. The project, dubbed the Al Wakrah Development Project, featured the Al Wakrah New Downtown, which was divided into seven sections, including:\n\nThe Wakrah Gateway, an exclusive zone for large-scale government offices and public services.\nSouth Square, which will accommodate a range of office complexes, residential units, and middle and lower-level retail outlets.\nThe Festival Bay, containing a minimum of two resort hotels, several business hotels, a maritime museum, a marina, and an arts and cultural center.\nWakrah Sands will host the main family attractions, such as family parks, recreation precincts, and retail and cultural establishments.\nWakrah Residence will mainly act as a housing area, being set to contain multi-purpose residential complexes.\nWakrah College, a segment for Al Wakrah's educational institutions.\nWakrah Trade Center is purposed for malls and retail complexes.\nThe Al Wakrah Development Project was part of the more extensive Qatar National Master Plan, which outlined several urban development goals for the future. The plan's goals for Al Wakrah were devised on the notion that the city's population would increase to 600,000 by 2030. Currently, it is unknown whether the Al Wakrah New Downtown project and the other smaller-scale projects are still underway or have been abandoned.\n\nAl Wakrah Main Road Project\nAshghal (the Public Works Authority) embarked on a QR 600 million overhaul of the city's road system in late 2018. As part of the project, 9 km (5.6 mi) of road extending from G-Ring Road to Mesaieed Road underwent development. This included converting the main road from two lanes to three lanes, installing an additional four intersections, and converting roundabouts to controlled intersections. Furthermore, a tunnel that runs in both directions for 160 m (520 ft) starting at Al Wakrah Metro Station was constructed. Pedestrians and cyclists also received an additional 6.1 km (3.8 mi) of exclusive paths. The project was carried out in three distinct phases and was originally anticipated to be completed by 2020. Later, the completion date was revised to late 2024.\n\nVisitor attractions\nA large quota of public parks and entertainment projects has been allocated for Al Wakrah. One of the most significant projects was Al Wakrah Heritage Village. The village includes Souq Al Wakrah, Al Wakrah Corniche, and a gated mosque stretching over 3 km of waterfront next to Al Wakrah Port. The village was first conceived of as part of the Al Wakrah Development Project, which was unveiled to the public in 2008. Six years after first being announced, the village officially opened in December 2014. There are more than a hundred shops in the souq selling traditional crafts as well as several restaurants.\n\nThe construction of the Wakrah Mall, the multi-storeyed mall located opposite Al Wakra Hospital, was launched by the Ezdan Group. In December 2016, the mall was officially opened to the public, with over 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m2) of retail space.\n\nPublic beaches\nThere are two main public beaches in the city, Souq Al Wakrah Beach and Al Wakrah Family Beach. They are located a few minutes apart from each other. Souq Al Wakrah Beach was opened to the public in mid-2017 as a family-oriented beach which also caters to certain water sports. Initially, the beach was free of charge but this policy was revised to charge for specific activities. Also located on the beach is a large playground area, which was opened in 2018. The playground contains not only children's play equipment but also has facilities for playing football and volleyball.\nAl Wakrah Family Beach is one of the most popular beaches in the country. The beach is flat and has very low waters. Among the facilities here are a children's playground, barbecue pits, parking lots, changing rooms, and a few gazebos. There is also an area to play football and volleyball.\n\nSouq Al Wakrah\nSouq Al Wakrah was opened in late 2014, in conjunction with Qatar National Day. Situated directly on Al Wakrah Beach, the souq incorporates traditional architectural features and heritage elements, and includes both old-fashioned houses and commercial spaces.\nThe market complex includes a variety of dining establishments situated along the coastline. There are also replica dhows installed on the shore. Adjacent to the market is the Souq Al Wakrah Hotel, established in 2018 and operated by the Tivoli Hotels Group.\n\nAl Wakrah Public Park\nConstructed in the mid-1980s, Al Wakrah Public Park was the city's first park. It is spread over an area of 47,000 square meters and is accessible through the Pearl Monument. Aside from containing cycling and pedestrian tracks, hundreds of trees belonging to native species have been planted throughout the park.\n\nHealthcare\nAl Wakrah Hospital, a facility of Hamad Medical Corporation, opened in December 2012. It is a general hospital that has 325 beds and is staffed by 217 doctors. With its associated buildings, it covers an area of more than 300,000 m2. The hospital provides modern medical and surgical facilities to Qatar's southern sector, which includes the cities of Al Wakrah and Mesaieed. The facilities contain surgical, obstetrics, gynecology, dentistry, dermatology and children's wards. A specialized diabetes center was created in December 2014.\n\nEducation\nAl Wakrah Public Library, the city's first library, was opened in 1985. It was the sixth library to be established in the country. At the time, the library comprised a collection of 15,000 Arabic-language books and 2,000 foreign books. A children's area was also included within the library. \nThe Dar Abdulrahman Darwish Fakhroo Quran Learning Center for Women is found in the center of the city.\nSchools in Al Wakrah include:\n\nSports\nAl Wakrah has a multi-sports club called the Al-Wakrah Sports Club, whose football team competes in the top tier of Qatari football, the Qatar Stars League. The club's home ground is the Saoud bin Abdulrahman Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 seats.\nThe city played a part in hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup through Al Janoub Stadium, formerly known as Al Wakrah Stadium, which has a capacity of 40,000 spectators. In addition to the stadium, a marketplace, a school, restaurants, and parkland are all located in a central plaza. Al Wakrah Sports Club was handed control of the stadium to replace the Saoud bin Abdulrahman Stadium once the 2022 World Cup came to an end. The design of the stadium, conceived by Zaha Hadid, takes the form of the sails of a dhow.\n\nTransportation\nKarwa Transportation Company (Mowasalat) has connected Al Wakrah to the rest of the cities in Qatar using its bus route. Currently, several buses are operating there.\nThere are roughly slightly under 3,000 streets running through Al Wakrah. Transit between Wakrah and the capital Doha is mainly facilitated by two highways: the 22 kilometres (14 mi)-long G Ring Road, completed in late 2019, and the southern section of the Doha Expressway. \nOther important roads which extend through Al Wakrah proper include Al Wakrah Road and Al Wukair Road. Al Wakrah Road is thoroughfare boasting a 40 metres (130 ft) right-of-way, accommodating four lanes of traffic and a spacious central median measuring approximately 12 metres (39 ft) in width.\nTransportation infrastructure in the city will be overhauled as part of the Al Wakrah Main Road Project launched by Ashghal in late 2018. After several delays, the estimated completion date was revised to late 2024.\n\nRail\nThe elevated Al Wakra station currently serves the Red Line of the Doha Metro. As part of the metro's Phase 1, the station was inaugurated on 8 May 2019, along with all other Red Line stations. It is located on Al Wakrah Road.\nAmong the station's facilities are a Masraf Al Rayyan ATM, a Qatar National Bank ATM, a prayer room, restrooms and a carpark. There are a total of five metrolinks, which is the Doha Metro's feeder bus network, servicing the station:\n\nM127, which serves Souq Al Wakra.\nM128, which serves Al Wakrah South.\nM130, which serves Ezdan Village 4-7 (Al Wukair).\nM131, which serves Ezdan Village 3 and 8–11 (Al Wukair).\nM134, which serves Al Wakrah South and Al Wakrah Hospital\n\nAdministration\nWhen free elections of the Central Municipal Council first took place in Qatar during 1999, Al Wakrah was designated the constituency seat of constituency no. 10. It would remain the headquarters of constituency no. 10 for the next three consecutive elections until the fifth municipal elections in 2015, when it was made the headquarters of constituency no. 20. Also included in its constituency is Mesaieed (as of the 2015 elections), Al Wukair, Ras Abu Fontas, Khor Al Adaid, Wadi Abu Saleel, Al Mashaf, and Al Naqiyan East. In the inaugural municipal elections in 1999, Ahmed Jassim Al-Muftah won the elections, receiving 57.2%, or 636 votes. Hassan Abbas Abdul Rahim was elected in the 2002 elections. He retained his seat successfully in the next two elections in 2007 and 2011. For the 2015 elections, Mansour Ahmad Yousif Al-Khater was elected municipal representative.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2010 census, the city comprised 8,436 housing units and 796 establishments. There were 79,457 people living in the city, of which 75% were male and 25% were female. Out of the 79,457 inhabitants, 81% were 20 years of age or older and 19% were under the age of 20. The literacy rate stood at 98.4%.\nEmployed persons made up 73% of the total population. Females accounted for 12% of the working population, while males accounted for 88% of the working population.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nAl Wakrah is twinned with:\n\n Ramsar, Iran (2010)\n Djougou, Benin (2014)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Al Wakrah travel guide from Wikivoyage",
          "summary": "Al Wakrah (Arabic: الوكرة, romanized: al-Wakra) is the capital city of the Al Wakrah Municipality in Qatar. Al Wakrah's eastern edge touches the shores of the Persian Gulf and Qatar's capital Doha is situated immediately north of the city. Governed by Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, it was originally a small fishing and pearling village. Over the years, it evolved into a small city with a population of more than 80,000 and is currently one of Qatar's most populous cities.\nThe city was historically used as a pearling center during the period in which Qatar's economy was almost entirely dependent on the bustling pearling industry. According to the United States Hydrographic Office, by 1920, there were approximately 300 ships situated in the town. A following study carried out by the British in 1925 stated that there were 250 boats in Wakrah's port. Al Wakrah was thought to encompass the so-called 'Pirate Coast', as stated by a report written in 1898. Once the country began large-scale oil operations in the mid-20th century, Al Wakrah became more important due to its proximity to the Mesaieed Industrial Area, Qatar's main industrial manufacturing hub and oil terminal.\nIt has undergone extensive development and growth since the turn of the 21st century while also being steadily encroached on by rapidly expanding Doha from the north. Notable milestones in the city's modern history include the 2019 inauguration of Al Janoub Stadium, a venue for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the opening of Souq Al Wakrah in 2014, the Al Wakrah Main Road Project, and the city's integration into the Doha Metro's Red Line in 2019.",

          "content": "Al Khor (Arabic: الخور; also spelled Al Khawr), officially Al Khor and Al Thakhira, is a municipality in northeastern Qatar. Al Khor City, the municipal seat, is located on the northeast coast of Qatar, around 50 kilometres (31 miles) from the capital, Doha and is considered to be one of Qatar's major cities. Al Thakhira is the second most significant settlement in the municipality after Al Khor City.\nThe region was ruled by the Al Muhannadi tribe, which consists of seven Bedouin families, before Qatar gained its independence in 1971. Tourism has been increasing in recent years owing to the municipality's various resorts, natural areas and cultural attractions. Fishing was the historical mainstay of most of the municipality's inhabitants.\n\nEtymology\nAl Khor Municipality derives its name from the city of the same name. In Arabic, Al Khawr means \"bay\"; it was so named because Al Khor City was near a bay. Formerly, the city was known as \"Khor Al-Shaqiq\".\n\nHistory\nAl Khor Municipality was established in July 1972, alongside Qatar's four other initial municipalities, and supervises the city of Al Khor in addition to other settlements in the municipality. As of 2017, Ibrahim Issa Nasser Al Fadalah was the mayor of the municipality.\n\nMunicipal seat\nAl Khor City, the municipal seat, is a coastal city located 57 kilometres (35 miles) north of the capital Doha. In the past, it was well known for the role it played in Qatar's bustling pearling industry, as well as for its harbour which is filled with fishing boats and small crafts. Several beaches, renovated forts and cultural attractions are found in the city.\n\nGeography\nAl Khor is situated in northern Qatar, bordered by the municipalities of Al Shamal to the north, Al Daayen and Umm Salal to the southeast, and Al-Shahaniya to the southwest. In addition to the main municipal headquarters in Al Khor City, there are Ministry of Municipality and Environment branches in Al Thakhira and Al Ghuwariyah.\nMuch of Al Khor's territory lies along the Qatari Peninsula's eastern coast, including the eastern boundaries of the municipality's two main cities – Al Khor City and Al Thakhira. Numerous beaches are located in this area, including Al-Farka Beach in Al Khor City and Al Thakhira Beach. A seafront promenade stretched over a 28,000-square-metre (300,000 sq ft) area known as Al Khor Corniche runs through the municipal seat.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the municipality accommodates 170 rawdas, 49 wadis, 57 jeris (places where water flows), seven jeryan (multiple jeris), seven plains, 22 hills, five highlands, 13 sabkhas, 17 capes, four bays, and three coral reefs. Four islands are found off its shores, the most important of which is Al Khor Island (also known as Jazirat Bin Ghanim).\nWhite mangrove forests in Qatar can be found in greatest abundance near Al Khor and Al Thakhira. This species of mangroves is well-adapted to the saline conditions of the northeast coast. At least eight mangrove sites exist in Qatar, and all are protected areas as of a 2006 Emiri decree.\n\nClimate\nThe following is climate data for the municipal seat, Al Khor.\n\nAdministration\nThe municipality is divided into 3 zones which are then divided into 454 blocks. Two of its main districts, Simaisma and Al Jeryan, are geographically located in Al Daayen. Additionally, the village of Madinat Al Kaaban is geographically located in Al Khor but serves as an administrative district for Al Shamal.\n\nAdministrative zones\nThe following administrative zones are found in Al Khor Municipality as of 2015:\n\nDistricts\nOther settlements in Al Khor include:\n\nEducation\nThere were 21 public schools in Al Khor as recorded in the 2016 education census – 11 were exclusively for girls and 10 were for boys.

The north-east portion of the municipality, known as Ras Laffan, was converted to a natural gas processing center. At present, Ras Laffan accommodates the world's largest GTL plant, the Pearl GTL which was constructed as by a partnership between Royal Dutch Shell and QatarEnergy. Qatar is also the world's second largest supplier of helium, which can be extracted from natural gas. All of the country's helium is produced by Qatargas' two helium plants in Ras Laffan, which were commissioned in 2005 and 2013, respectively. In June 2017, amidst the Qatar diplomatic crisis, the government ordered the two plants to be shut down indefinitely.\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural activities such as fishing and pearling were traditional mainstays of the inhabitants of this region.

This project is based on a two-million square meter plot owned by Baladna in the Umm Al Hawaya locality of the municipality.\nOne of the most important agricultural research stations in Qatar is located in Rawdat Al Faras. The research station, established in 1976, consists of a laboratory, a warehouse and five palm tree fields hosting thousands of palm trees.\nCapitalizing on the municipality's rich maritime tradition, the 101,000-square-metre (1,090,000 sq ft) facility of the Aquatic Fisheries and Research Centre was completed in Ras Matbakh by Ashghal in 2017 at a cost of QR 237.7 million.\nThree major government-owned plant nurseries are located in Al Khor; two are in the village of Al Rashida, and one is in Rawdat Bakheela.

          "content": "Lusail (Arabic: لوسيل, ALA-LC: Lūsayl, Arabic pronunciation: [luːˈsajl]) is the second-largest city in Qatar after Doha, and the economic capital of Qatar, located on the coast, in the southern part of the municipality of Al Daayen. Lusail lies about 23 kilometres (14 mi) north of the Doha city centre, just north of the West Bay Lagoon, on over 38 square kilometres (15 sq mi) and will eventually have the infrastructure to accommodate 450,000 people. Of these, it is estimated that there will be 250,000 or fewer residents, 190,000 office workers and 60,000 retail workers.\nIt is planned to have marinas, residential areas, island resorts, commercial districts, luxury shopping and leisure facilities, a golf course community, man-made islands, and several entertainment districts. Development is being carried out by the state-controlled developer Qatari Diar along with Parsons Corporation and Dorsch-Gruppe.\nLusail Stadium was one of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and hosted the final. It is also the site of a Formula One race track where the first Qatar Grand Prix was held in 2021.\n\nEtymology\nLusail's name is derived from \"al wassail,\" a plant that grows bountifully in the area.\n\nHistory\n20th century\nIn 1908, J. G. Lorimer recorded Lusail in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. He wrote:\n\nA village on the east coast of Qatar about 15 miles north of Dohah: the principal residence at the present time of Shaikh Jasim, the head of the Al Thani family of Qatar. About 500 yards inland of the place is Jabal Lusail, a rocky hillock of some height which forms a landmark well known to mariners. On the summit of Jabal Lusail is a double-storeyed tower visible from several miles inland; and at the foot of the hill are three wells, one on the north and two on the west side; the water of these is extremely brackish. The village of Lusail consists of about 50 substantial stone and mud houses of Hamaidat and 2 or 3 of Ma'adhid, the latter being personal retainers of the Shaikh. To the village belong 9 pearl boats, 2 other sea-going vessels, and 3 fishing boats. Animals of transport are 20 horses and 70 camels. The house of the Shaikh stands about 200 yards to the south of the village: it was built about 1901 and is a four-sided, high-walled building of stone and plaster, adjoined by a few yards and out-houses and by a small mosque. It is called a fort, but it contains no guns. \n\nIn an earlier 1904 transcript of Lorimer's Gazetteer, he remarks that Sheikh Jassim first settled in Lusail in 1903 with a few allied tribes. Sheikh Jassim died and was buried in Lusail in July 1913. His base of operations, known as the \"Founder's Fort,\"' is recognized as a cultural icon of Qatar.\nHistoric evidence of the practice of date syrup manufacturing using a traditional date press called madbasa has been found in Lusail. While many of these presses have been abandoned or destroyed over the years,  a remaining installation can be observed at the historic residence of Sheikh Jassim.\n\n21st century\nPlans for the development of Lusail City were first announced in 2005. After a cabinet resolution was passed in 2002, Lusail along with its suburbs of Al Kharayej and Jabal Thuaileb became the first areas of Qatar where foreigners could own real estate. In December 2013, Qatari Diar announced that more than 80% of the plots in Lusail have been purchased. It was stated in April 2018 that over 80% of the city's infrastructure projects were completed.\nOn 26 November 2022, during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a large fire broke out in a building under construction near Qetaifan Island North about 3.5 km away from Lusail Stadium where multiple World Cup games were scheduled to occur. The Civil Defense controlled the fires in three warehouses and no injuries or casualties were sustained.\nIn March 2023, the United Nations House at Lusail was opened. As the main representative office of the United Nations in the country, it will serve to improve the partnership between the Qatari government and the UN.\n\nGeography\nBoundaries of the city  run from the Persian Gulf in the east, to the Al Khor Coastal Road in the west, and for roughly 7 km (4.3 mi) north of the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Doha. Not included in city boundaries is the district of Al Egla which hosts the Doha Golf Club.\nTwo nearby settlements to the south of the original town of Lusail, Al Kharayej and Jabal Thuaileb (Fox Hills), have been incorporated into Lusail as standalone districts. At the time the project was launched, these places were not inhabited. The only standing structures in the area were an Ooredoo station, a cement factory, and three farms, one of which was still in use. Youth would commonly use the area for recreational off-roading and on occasion, waste was dumped in its sabkhas (salt flats). Located to the north of the city are several abandoned fishing villages.\nGroundwater quality in the area is poor. On the city's border with the Persian Gulf, the groundwater elevation is 1 meter above sea level and flows east-to-west. Salinity levels are highest on the eastern side, at 40 ppt, compared to a low of 18 ppt in the western section; these levels are too high for consumption or use in agriculture. Because of the groundwater's high salinity, only salt- and drought-tolerant plants grow in this area. A geographic survey found 25 species of plants within city limits; all of which are found abundantly elsewhere on the peninsula.\nExcept for dogs and camels kept on a local farm, no mammals were recorded in the area during the initial environmental impact assessment. However, several species of snakes and lizards were found, including the spiny-tailed lizard which is common to Qatar. Nine species of birds were found to occur in the area, particularly in its mudflats. Grass coverage in its mudflat area is less than 30%, with most grass being found in soils with the highest sand content.\n\nDistricts\nLusail has 19 designated districts as part of the city's master plan. They are:\n\nGolf District\nAs its name suggests, the main attraction of the Golf District is its 18-hole golf course. Many high-end villas are situated within the golf course's vicinity. The city's education guidelines state that there will be one school occupying upwards of 55,000 m2 (590,000 sq ft) for kindergarten to secondary students.\n\nNorth Residential District\nOnce fully completed, the North Residential District will feature 895 large villas spread over an area of 126 hectares. As part of the city's educational plan, there will be six schools in this district, 4 of which are kindergartens, with the other two accommodating kindergarten to secondary students.\n\nWaterfront Residential District\nHigh-rise housing units with a panoramic view of Lusail's coastline are under construction here. Two schools are planned for here.\n\nAl Kharayej Towers\nOriginally a rural settlement on the outskirts of Doha, Al Kharayej has been reformed as a district of Lusail under the name Al Kharayej Towers. Bounded by the Golf District and the Waterfront Residential District, this district will consist of 42 high-rise apartment complexes built in a mixed-Arabic style. A 7,750 m2 (83,400 sq ft) kindergarten will serve this district.\n\nStadium District\nAs a result of Qatar winning the hosting rights to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, it was decided that a massive stadium should be constructed in Lusail. The outcome was the Lusail Iconic Stadium, which hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final game between Argentina and France. Sports fans are able to access the district through the Lusail LRT and the Doha Metro.\n\nEnergy City 1\nFirst launched in 2006, Energy City 1 is meant to be a major business hub for the country's oil and gas industry. The International Mercantile Exchange, a trading platform for energy, will be centered in the district. Microsoft was said to be assisting in developing the technology infrastructure. In July 2013, CEO of Energy City Hesham Al Emadi revealed that, as a result of many requests for office space by non energy-related companies, the city will be converted to a mixed-use facility.\n\nWaterfront Commercial District\nAlso known as Seef Lusail, the Waterfront Commercial District will serve as a hub for shopping malls and other commercial establishments. A small amount of land in this district has been designated for residential and office use. City developers have planned two kindergartens for this district.\n\nFox Hills\nDevelopment of Fox Hills as a residential district was commenced in 2006. In 2013, officials claimed that it would receive its first inhabitants for its under-development residential complexes in 2014.\nIn 2015, the community was said to accommodate 9,200 apartments ranging from 5 to 7 stories. Many of the buildings were constructed with traditional architectural elements in order to represent Qatari heritage. Most major infrastructure projects for electricity, water, and streets were completed in the same year.\nNumerous parks are found in this district, including the Crescent Park. Three schools are planned for the northern section: a kindergarten, a primary school, and a secondary school. In the southern section, two schools are under construction.\n\nAl Erkyah\nLocated along the Al Khor Coastal Road, Al Erkyah will be a mixed-use district comprising mainly open space, commercial and medical facilities. According to the education guidelines published by the city, one 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) primary school will be based here.\n\nEnergy City 2\nThis district, found next to the industrial-oriented Energy City 1, will consist mainly of residential units, especially for residents who are employed in Energy City 1. In the future it is planned to contain a school for children aged 3 to 18 spanning a roughly 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) area.\n\nEntertainment City\nA designated entertainment district, Entertainment City will contain over 2,000 housing units, 11 hotels, and several theme parks, nightclubs, and shopping malls. Place Vendôme is a major mall being constructed in the city and will feature a canal that runs the length of the mall, an amusement park, and a cinema complex. In regards to education, there will be one 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) primary school here.\n\nEntertainment Island\nThis district will play host to a large-scale museum in the future.\n\nMedical and Education District\nMost of Lusail's medical and education facilities will be based here. Furthermore, there will be a small amount of residences here. Much green space will be spread throughout the district.\n\nQatarEnergy District\nServing Qatar's chief energy company QatarEnergy, this district will host the new headquarters of QP. Transport will be facilitated by the Lusail LRT and the adjacent Al Khor Coastal Road.\n\nMarina District\nOne of the main attractions of the Marina district will be Katara Hospitality's tourism complex known as Lusail Marina Iconic Development. When completed, the complex will feature leisure facilities, luxury restaurants, and upwards of 800 hotel and apartment rooms.\nAnother attraction is the Marina Twin Towers, which comprises 8,236 m2 (88,650 sq ft) of office space. Retail demand will be mainly be met by Lusail Marina Mall, which will cover an area of 57,605 m2 (620,060 sq ft).\nIt is planned for two primary schools to be built here, one exclusively for boys and the other exclusively for girls.\n\nQetaifan Islands\nIn large part, Qetaifan Island North will consist of tourist attractions such as water parks and hotels.\nQetaifan Island South is composed of three islands. Prospective luxury villas, a marina waterfront, and marketplaces will be built here. Furthermore, a school for primary and secondary students is planned.\n\nBoulevard Commercial\nAs the central hub of Lusail, retail and office space will be found here. Its street and buildings will be inspired by the Champs-Élysées avenue in France. Three kindergartens are in the works for this district.\nLusail Boulevard in Downtown Lusail embodies a quintessential contemporary urbanism fused with Qatar's cultural fabric. A dynamic shopping, commercial, and residential destination, Lusail Boulevard is designed to be one of the focal points of Lusail’s downtown and provide easy access to pedestrians.\n\nLusail Plaza Towers\nThis district will contain office and commercial towers. Lusail's tallest structure is found here, the Lusail Plaza Towers. Two buildings are 301 metres (988 ft) and the two other 215 m (705 ft) high and have 220 floors in the four towers complex. It was begun in 2020 and will be completed in October 2023 (core and shell+ lobby finishings)  The 1.1 million-square-metre development is host to the headquarters for the Qatar National Bank, Qatar Central Bank and Qatar Investment Authority alongside several other global organisations including Qatari Diar. Lusail Plaza Towers was designed by Foster & Partners.\n\nLandmarks\nLusail Marina Arch\nLusail Marina Arch is a 74 metres (243 ft) tall sculpture at Marina Interchange.\n\nAl Wahda Arches\nDesigned by Erik Behrens, Al Wahda Arches stand at 100 metres (330 ft) tall. It is located at the beginning of the Lusail Expressway, and its design is meant to represent the net that the pearl divers of Qatar's past would have used. Construction was completed in 2020, and the structure consists of two slanted arches with a connected net.\n\nSports\nLocated just outside the city is the Losail International Circuit, which has hosted the Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix every year since 2004. Since 2007 it has been the opening round of the MotoGP world championship, and in 2008 floodlights were installed in the facility, making it the only race on the calendar to be held at night. In November 2021, the track also hosted the inaugural Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix as a replacement for the canceled Australian Grand Prix. Recently the track signed a new 10-year contract with F1, meaning that the track will host the Qatar Grand Prix until 2033. WEC (FIA World Endurance Championship) will also hold an endurance race on the track from 2024. This will make Losail the first track in the Middle East to hold F1, MotoGP, and WEC in the same season.\nThe first Qatari Diar Triathlon was held in the Spring of 2019 in Lusail City-Marina Promenade. The city was also announced as host of the 2025 T100 Triathlon World Championship final.\nLusail Sports Arena is another sporting venue in the city and hosted matches of the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship. Constructed at a cost of $318 million, it has a capacity of 15,300 spectators and opened its doors in 2012.\nLusail Stadium, with a capacity of 88,000+ people, hosted the Final of the 2022 FIFA 'World' Cup. The stadium's design is inspired from the sail of a traditional dhow as the city is located north of Doha on the eastern coast, which is a historic focal point of pearling vessels. The architects are MANICA Architecture and Foster and Partners.\nThe city will host matches for the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup including the final phase.\n\nEducation\nAs part of Lusail's master plan, the city is ultimately set to contain 36 schools with a capacity for 26,000 students. Upwards of 75,000 m2 (810,000 sq ft) has already been reserved for school buildings by the Lusail City Real Estate Development Company; these schools are expected to be commissioned by 2019. Universities in Lusail include Lusail University, UKM - Qatar (The National University of Malaysia - Qatar), and CUQ Ulster University.\n\nEconomy\nNumerous non-energy-related companies are also headquartered in Lusail. Hotel operator and developer Katara Hospitality is based in the city, as is Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company and its subsidiaries, such as Lusail Real Estate Development Company and utilities company Marafeq Qatar. Qatari Diar was responsible for launching the Lusail City Development Project in 2005.\nThe Lusail Industrial Area hosts many construction companies. In the Lusail Ready-Mix Batching Plant Zone, two ready-mix batching plants are maintained by Qatar Alpha Beton Ready Mix, one ready-mix batching plant is maintained by SMEET, REDCO owns a precast plant, Qatar Concrete has 1 ready-mix batching plant, and HBK ReMIX operates a ready-mix factory.\n\nInfrastructure\nUtilities\nA network of gas pipelines will transport synthetic natural gas (SNG) to the city. Distributed by a gas pipeline with a length upwards of 150 km2 (58 sq mi), up to 28,000 m3 (990,000 cu ft) per hour of natural gas will be fed from the Lusail City Gas Farm. Lusail's SNG system was developed as part of a joint venture between the National Gas Company of Oman and Qatari company Petro Serv Limited. In regards to power stations, 66 kV and 11 kV substations will be constructed. The latter will be built underground in specialized structures. Portions of the 66 kV substations connecting from mainland Lusail to the Qetaifan Islands are planned to be set up under the sea bed and run through utility tunnels.\n\nGreen spaces\nNumerous public parks are housed throughout Lusail's districts. In the Fox Hills district, for example, 33 parks provide around 10.3 hectares of green space. One of the largest parks is called Crescent Park. This park includes a forested area, an all-giraffe zoo, playgrounds, water features, bike trails, kiosks, monuments, and several sports fields. In addition, there are several small-to-mid-sized parks known as pocket gardens which contain fewer facilities than parks. There are 18 of these situated in the Marina district, occupying an overall space of more than 26,000 m2 (280,000 sq ft). Also in the Marina district are roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) of promenades along the waterfront.\n\nHousing & accommodation\nOnce fully completed, Lusail is expected to house 250,000 residents. Future developments will see this capacity potentially increase to 450,000. Currently, 22 hotels are operating or under construction in the city.\nKatara Hospitality stated that they would be constructing a luxury resort comprising a water park and a four-star hotel on the Qetaifan Island North in October 2017. Another project by Katara Hospitality, 'Katara Towers', was launched in October 2012 at a cost of QR 2.2 billion. Equipped with two hotels, high-end apartments, and other facilities, the project was scrapped after a short time. It was revealed by the company that they had relaunched the project in August 2017 and were estimating a completion date of 2020.\n\nTourism\nQatar has launched several large tourism projects, including the Lusail City complex. The Tourism Ministry is projecting an eventual arrival rate of 6 million to 7 million visitors annually, a dramatic increase from the 2022 figure of 2.6 million arrivals from abroad. Place Vendôme Mall, Katara Towers, Al Maha Island, Lusail Winter Wonderland, Crescent Park, Lusail Marina, Lusail Pedestrian Bridges and Qetaifan islands are among the most important tourist centers of Lusail.\n\nAl Maha Island\nLusail Winter Wonderland, crowned as Al Maha Island's key attraction is a 93,000 m2 theme park offering 50 amusement rides. It will include a 150-foot Ferris wheel, 25 family rides, 15 children rides, and 10 thrill rides. It also has a 395 rollercoaster. Al Maha Island also includes The Arena, a concert venue and fan zone, with a capacity of 3,000-5000 spectators area.\n\nTransport\nTransport in Lusail is facilitated by six main roads which connect to Doha in the south, connect to Lusail Highway in the east and north and connect to Al Khor Highway in the west.\nDoha Metro's Red Line runs through Lusail, providing its residents with convenient access to Doha and Al Wakrah. Lusail station opened to the public on 10 December 2019 along with three other Red Line stations, over six months after the opening of the line's first 13 stations. It is located on Al Khor Coastal Road (also known as Route Q1A) and is the northern terminus of the Red Line. There is one metrolink, which is the Doha Metro's free feeder bus network, servicing the station:\n\nM145, which serves Doha Festival City in Umm Salal Municipality.\nQatar Rail is involved in the construction of the Lusail LRT. First designed in August 2007, the Lusail LRT will be spread over a distance of 33.1 km (20.6 mi), of which 10.4 km (6.5 mi) will be underground and the remaining 22.7 km (14.1 mi) will be overground. The network will connect to the Doha Metro Red Line through the Lusail Main Station and the Lusail Marina Station.\n\nSee also\nThe Pearl-Qatar\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLusail website\nLusail City – Development Profile",

La ville nouvelle compte environ 200 000 habitants sur 35 km2.\nOn y trouve notamment le circuit international de Losail.\nLa ville a accueilli des matchs du Championnat du monde masculin de handball 2015, dont la finale. En 2022, Lusail accueille plusieurs matchs de la Coupe du monde de football dont la finale opposant l'Argentine à la France.\n\nGéographie\nLusail est située à 22 km au nord du centre de Doha. Elle se déploie sur 38 km2, bordée à l'est par le golfe Persique.\n\nHistorique\nLa construction de la ville est lancée en 2006, deux ans après l'organisation du premier Grand Prix moto du Qatar sur le circuit international de Losail. Le site, identifié jusqu'alors comme une route dans le désert, est revenu pour une référence historique, il s'agit du lieu où cheikh Jassim al-Thani (en) a établi le premier fort de l'émirat au début du XIXe siècle.\nAprès l’attribution de l'organisation de la Coupe du monde de football 2022 en décembre 2010, le projet accélère. La ville devient le plus gros chantier de développement urbain entrepris pour un coût estimé à 45 milliards de dollars, un cinquième de l'investissement du pays pour les infrastructures liées à l'organisation de la Coupe du monde de football. La ville doit accueillir la finale de la compétition dans un stade de 86 000 personnes à construire et imagine autour une ville futuriste avec un parc zoologique de girafes, un dôme de ski et un parc d'attractions.\nEn 2014, le plan de construction de la ville prévoit dix-neuf quartiers d'affaires, d'habitations, de centres commerciaux et d'hôtellerie prévus pour une population de 450 000 personnes, 250 000 résidents et 200 000 employés et travailleurs. Les étrangers peuvent investir dans l’immobilier à Lusail, le plus souvent avec un bail de 99 ans. L'île de Qetafian, presque-île construite artificiellement, est prévue comme le centre touristique de Lusail avec des stations balnéaires, des plages et un port de plaisance permettant d'accueillir de luxueux yachts. Le plan comprend également la construction de deux parcours de golf, de stations balnéaires implantées sur l'île, d'un réseau de métro léger (3 lignes, 19 km, 25 stations). L'un des premiers projets fini a été le quartier résidentiel de Fox Hills.\nEn avril 2022, un centre commercial de grande taille, sur quatre étages et une surface de 1 150 000 m2, intitulé Place Vendôme et inspiré du style architectural parisien, est inauguré dans la ville. Pendant la Coupe du monde, de nombreux officiels de la FIFA logent dans les deux luxueux hôtels des Katara Towers, autour duquel de nombreux travaux sont encore en cours au moment de la compétition.\n\nNotes et références\n(en) Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé « Lusail » (voir la liste des auteurs).\n\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nKatara Towers\nStade de Lusail\nLusail (métro de Doha)\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\n\n Portail du Qatar",

          "content": "## Overview\nOnce little more than a minuscule pearl fishing village, Doha (Arabic: الدوحة ad-Dawḥa), Qatar's capital, with more people than the rest of Qatar combined, has emerged to become one of the pearls of the Middle East. It is one of the most rapidly-developing cities on the Persian Gulf, akin to the development seen in nearby Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and is aiming to become a centre of international trade and travel.\nWe also cover the neighbouring cities of Al Rayyan and Lusail in this article, as they are effectively part of the Doha urban area.\n\n## Understand\nFor most of its history, Doha was a poor fishing village dependent on pearl diving, and was regarded as a sleepy backwater until the early 1990s. Following the accession of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani as Emir in 1995, however, Qatar quickly began to modernize, and Doha is now taking huge strides to catch up with other nearby Gulf cities. Development was accelerated by hosting the Asian Games in 2006 and the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The city is very much a work-in-progress, with a rapidly growing skyline and new buildings sprouting up almost like mushrooms.\nFor most visitors, Doha is synonymous with Qatar, as the vast majority of the country's population resides in the capital city. Doha has an astonishingly diverse population – only 13% of its residents are Qataris. Although Arabic is Qatar's official language, English is the lingua franca; most retail and service staff are foreigners and do not speak Arabic. Doha is also now one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, as workers continue to pour in to help build the developing economy.\nDoha is fairly liberal by the standards of the Islamic world, though less so than its main rival Dubai and most Western countries. Alcohol and pork are legal for non-Muslim foreign residents, and non-Muslim women are not required to wear the hijab, though dressing in very skimpy outfits is still illegal. That said, Qatar is an absolute monarchy, so criticising the Emir is a crime. Homosexuality is also a crime that carries the death penalty (though not actively enforced), so gay visitors should be as discreet as possible.\nIf you've visited before, be assured that Doha today is not the same as it was just a couple of years ago, and will be very different again in a few years time.\n\n## Read\nMohanalakshmi Rajakumar, From Dunes to Dior. Written by a resident Indian-American, this is a collection of insightful essays about life as an expatriate in Doha.\nMohanalakshmi Rajakumar, Love Comes Later. Set in Doha and London, this novel examines Qatari culture and how young Qataris are now challenging the status quo. The book is not available in Qatar as it has been banned by the Qatari Ministry of Culture.\n\n## By plane\n25.27305651.6080561 Hamad International Airport (DOH IATA). The primary point of entry for most travellers, it is the hub and base for Qatar Airways, which has positioned itself as one of the \"Big Three\" Middle Eastern airlines. It has built a far-reaching network, flying to destinations in Europe, South and East Asia, Australia, Africa and the Americas.\nCompared to Dubai, the home of Qatar Airways' arch-rival Emirates, Doha is served by much fewer other carriers. The major European airlines usually provide a single connection to Doha from their main hubs (e.g. Lufthansa from Frankfurt, KLM from Amsterdam), but minor ones do not. Pretty much all airlines of the Middle East, Turkey included (but not Israel), provide connections to Doha. Relatively few Asian airlines do so, however, with the exception of a relatively good choice of connections to India and Pakistan.\nQatar Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance (which includes e.g. British Airways), and an increasing number of their connections are also on offer as codeshare flights by Oneworld members.\nIf you're arriving from outside of the Persian Gulf region, probably the most economical way to visit is to use Qatar as an intermediate stopover en route to another destination. Prices of tickets originating in or terminating in Doha are artificially high because of limited competition, while prices for transit tickets are very competitive, as Qatar Airways continues working to build Doha as a global transit hub.\nPublic Wi-Fi is provided free of charge throughout the airport.\n\n## By car\nSeveral car rental agencies are found in and around Doha International Airport. The rental desks are not that easy to find and the signs to them are poor.  They are on the lower floor in the car park area.  The popular agencies include Hertz, Avis[dead link] and Budget. These rental agencies offer seasonal discounts and it is advisable to check their websites before booking. If you're looking to rent a car, it is best to reserve in advance, to ensure a good price and minimise wait times. As of late 2013, visitors can drive a rental car for six months with an international driving licence. However, the laws regarding driving licences change almost yearly; visitors are advised to verify this information before arrival.\nDriving in Qatar is on the right hand side of the road, with similar traffic rules to elsewhere in the world. However, because Doha residents come from all corners of the globe, driving styles vary wildly. Also, road rage is becoming more of a problem.\nExpansion of the road network has not kept up with the explosive population growth, so drivers will encounter frequent traffic jams and numerous diversions due to road construction. With the addition of new roads, and the renaming of old roads, even the latest available road maps may be out-of-date.  This also applies to satellite imagery, which can be outdated, even when it is only a few months old.  So do not rely on Google Earth, OpenStreetMap or your TomTom.\n\n## By metro\nThe Doha Metro[dead link], which opened in May 2019, is the third rapid transit system in the Gulf, representing a new wave of transit projects in the region. It has three lines: the Red Line from Lusail in the north to Al Wakra in the south or the airport depending on the train, the east-west Gold Line that features a stop at the National Museum, and the Green Line, which focuses on educational institutions in particular and has a stop at the National Library. Msheireb serves as the transfer station between every line.\nLike the Dubai Metro, there are premium cars with better seating and higher prices. A one-way trip costs QR 2 (QR 10 for VIP) and a day pass costs QR 6 (QR 30 for VIP). You pay by tapping your card when you enter and exit the system. Cards are not expensive and can be purchased at any station. You don’t have to do anything special to get the day pass; after you pay for 3 rides the system will not charge you for the rest of the day.\nThere are free \"metrolink\"[dead link] feeder bus services for \"last-mile\" connectivity to areas not served by the Metro (see the link for schedules and routes). In addition, there is a free (with Metro trip) ride-sharing service called \"metroexpress\"[dead link], but it only serves two stations (West Bay and DICC) and requires registration and a separate account.\nEvery metro station has a restroom with baby changing table and an ablution room, right after the turnstiles. The two rooms are next to each other; the women’s rooms are indicated by a person wearing black clothing, and the men’s rooms by the person wearing white clothing.\n\n## By bus\n25.2852451.536342 Public bus, Al Ghanim (main bus station) (near the Gold Souq), info@mowasalat.com. The public bus system is operated by the government-owned Mowasalat, which runs a wide network of routes catering for most of Doha, along with adjacent and surrounding towns. Fares within the city cost between QR 3-9 and are payable with exact change, or with a Karwa Smartcard [dead link], available for purchase at the bus station. For visitors, the route maps can be cryptic, with fairly infrequent service on some routes; additionally buses are frequently behind schedule. There are dedicated sections at the front of buses for women and families; however, in practice, some routes, particularly those to and from industrial areas, are used predominantly by male labourers and best avoided by women travellers. Timetables are online, some available to download; route maps are available only at the main bus station.\nShuttle bus, ☏ +974 4458 8888 (Mowasalat), info@mowasalat.com. Daily 06:00-00:00 every 15 min. In order to ease ever-increasing traffic congestion, Mowasalat  operates a free shuttle bus service, servicing passengers with two routes in the West Bay (downtown) area; plans are underway to offer more routes. A route map (Arabic and English) is available for download. Friday service is 'family only', i.e. solo men are not permitted. Free.\n\n## By tour bus\nDoha Bus, ☏ +974 4442 2444, +974 5534 2964 (mobile), admin@dohabus.com. It offers a hop-on, hop-off tourist bus service, with stops at various locations between the Marriott Hotel and the Pearl-Qatar. Buses arrive at each stop every 20 minutes. Tickets are QR 180 (adult), QR 90 (children) and valid for 24 hours; bookings can be made on-line at its website, also via telephone and email. If you're doing this on your last day in Doha, they will arrange to pick you up at one of the main stops along the route and transfer you back to the airport for a not-unreasonable QR 50. (updated Mar 2023)\n\n## By taxi\nOther than public transport, the only alternative to not renting a vehicle is taxis. There are many taxi services, two of them also operated by Mowasalat: Karwa and Al Million. Uber is also a popular alternative to these two. Keep in mind that TaxiF services are, at the time of editing, illegal, so do not book a ride from them. The other main \"Limousine\" taxis are available, which are unmarked, much more expensive (often two to four times the cost of Karwas) and may not carry a meter. If you feel sure about the fare, you can negotiate it up front, but it is advisable to insist on a meter.\nBecause of increasing complaints regarding taxis, some precautions should be taken. For nearly all journeys within Doha the tariff should be set to '1', and for journeys at night or outside of Doha it should be set to '0'. Airport taxis have a single tariff, which begins at QR 25. Reports of tampered meters are on the rise (look for black tape or paper), as are reports of drivers locking the doors or refusing to open the trunk without extra payment. If the driver refuses to use the meter, the ride should be free, but you may have trouble exercising this right. If you have problems, you can call the police at 999, at which point the driver will suddenly be very cooperative.\nThe demand for taxis far exceeds the supply and waiting times may vary greatly. During morning business hours, companies usually require 24 hours notice if you need a taxi; however in practice, even this is unreliable as the scheduled taxi often doesn't show up. At other times, it may take upwards of 90 minutes for an on-call taxi to arrive, and hailing one may be impossible in many places. The only places where you are guaranteed to find a taxi (normal or limousine) are at major malls, the airport and international hotels. The acute shortage has led to a thriving market for unlicensed, or unofficial, taxi services, most with a steady clientele. For visitors, the best way to find a reliable driver is to ask around – many residents, particularly expats, hire such drivers regularly and will happily share contact information.\nOccasionally, you may find a local driver will stop and offer to give you a ride if he or she sees you looking lost on the side of the road. It is customary to offer some money at the end, though sometimes they will refuse to take it. If a driver slows down and flashes their headlights, they are usually signalling they're willing to give you a lift; beckon them over with a wave in response. However, hitchhiking always has its risks, and it is not an advisable practice for solo women.\n\n## By tram\nThere is a tram service in Lusail and Msheireb Downtown, the latter being free to use.\n\n## Museums\nThe National Museum, Museum of Islamic Art, and Museum of Modern Art have a single three-day ticket for QR 85. Alternatively you can visit just one of them for QR 50.\n25.29527851.5391671 Museum of Islamic Arts, Next to Doha Port, on the Corniche (Route 76 bus; shuttle bus), ☏ +974 4422 4444.

Built in 1880 during the Ottoman period, this big white fort is in what is now the parking lot of Souq Waqif. At the time it was built, however, the fort was on the outskirts of the city.

There is a section of spice shops, another of textiles, and even a quarter with falcons for sale. Stables with Arabian horses are not far from the falcons, and camels are kept near Al Koot Fort and the parking lot. Also look for places to buy souvenirs, sit down to smoke a Sheesha, or enjoy food at one of the restaurants bordering it. Traditionally-dressed Qatari police occasionally patrol the souq area, in the morning mounted on camels and in the evening on horseback.

There are still a few notable old villas and mosques which predate the mostly 1970s-era buildings; given the pace of redevelopment in Doha it is unclear how much longer they will survive.

As with in most of the Middle East, be prepared to bargain.\nAlso, be aware that most of the luxury malls and some souks schedule \"Family Days\", most commonly Fridays, weekends and public holidays, where all single men should in theory be turned away at the door.

However, iftar or the breaking of the fast after sunset, is a very elaborate event, as locals gather for large communal meals.  Many establishments set up large tents for iftar, and non-Muslim visitors are welcome to partake in them; just make sure you reserve way in advance due to their popularity.\nAs Qatar is a Muslim country, nearly all food in Doha is halal. Pork is not served at restaurants, but is available to foreign residents with a liquor license at the two liquor stores run by the Qatar Distribution Company (QDC).

A popular breakfast spot, and one of the few very few places that serves traditional Qatari cuisine.    (updated Oct 2022)\nFor local street food, nothing beats the home-made goodness dished out by the Pancake Ladies in Souq Waqif every evening in the square by the car park. The crepe-like mankouche is particularly tasty, filled with your choice of labneh (cheese), za’atar, or the less-traditional Nutella for QR5. Other local specialties feature meat, chicken, and fish, and there are even a couple of vegetarian options.\nThere are also many good restaurants in Souq Waqif worth trying. Perhaps the best include Tagine (Moroccan) and Le Gourmet, particularly good for sheesha and a cup of tea. These are not as inexpensive as the Pancake Ladies but are good for ambiance and people watching.\nParisa, Al Souq Street (Go down the main thoroughfare of Souq Waqif towards the Corniche.

Despite being banned, some restaurants still include a 10% service charge in the bill. Should your bill include a service charge, feel free to strike it from the total and leave a tip on the table instead.\n\n## Alcohol\nAlcohol is strictly regulated in Qatar, as it is a Muslim country, and for visitors is only available in bars attached to large 5-star international hotels. Bars are required to see identification (i.e. a passport) at the door, although this is rarely enforced. Residents with a special liquor license may purchase alcohol at the QDC (Qatar Distribution Company) on the outskirts of town. The importation of alcohol is strictly disallowed – all bags are scanned by x-ray upon arrival at Hamad International Airport and customs will confiscate any bottles of alcohol they find. They will issue a claims receipt, which will allow you to pick up your bottles again when you leave Qatar.\nSome of the places favoured by local expats are the Crystal Lounge[dead link] and Waham Poolside Lounge (W Doha Hotel), Sky View Bar (La Cigale Hotel), the Belgian Café [formerly dead link]  (InterContinental at West Bay Lagoon), and Trader Vic's (Hilton). The Irish Harp (in the basement of the Sheraton near City Center Mall) has frequent live music.\n\n## Tea and coffee\nKarak is the local specialty, a very sweet concoction made from tea and evaporated milk available from stalls everywhere, some of them drive-through (just park your car outside and honk). A particularly popular place is Chapati & Karak (☏ +974 4408 1408) at Katara Cultural Village.\nMost international coffee chains (including the ubiquitous Starbucks) are well-represented here, especially in shopping malls.\n25.2624951.528921 PappaRoti, C Ring Rd, ☏ +974 4421 2001, info@papparoti.ae. Daily 12:00-00:00. This branch of the popular Malaysian café chain offers a good selection of coffee and teas, along with special roti buns.\n\n## Sleep\nCompared to Dubai, which has hundreds of accommodation facilities, Doha does not offer that much variety with less than a hundred hotel properties and some other accommodations. There are quite a few 5-star international chain hotels in Doha and there are scores of new 5-star hotels on the rise, such as the Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, and Intercontinental.

In a slightly out of the way location, but since nowhere in Doha is really walkable, that's not a huge strike against it. It has two towers of excellent 4-star rooms and a selection of restaurants few hotels can match: the Mexican is acceptable, the pan-Asian quite good, the buffet nothing special, and the Indian really great. Alcohol is available in the restaurants, but there is no cocktail lounge or bar.

A comfortable 4-star hotel with a few pleasant surprises. The Indian restaurant is one of the best in town (and, because it's in a hotel, it serves alcohol). The pub on the hotel's ground floor is a large club that on weekends comes alive as a disco under the guidance of a Filipino cover band and hundreds of Asian workers letting loose after a hard 6-day work week. The Library Bar, on the hotel's top floor, has a small, slightly worn clubby field populated by large-bellied expats.

Other smaller, private hospitals will charge for any emergency services.\n999 is the emergency number for ambulance, police, and fire service. You will likely need to give directions or a nearby landmark. Response times in Doha are dependent on traffic, and there have been reports of long waits for ambulances, along with long waits for English-speaking operators. Medical teams however are highly skilled and all fluent in English.\nHMC operates A&E departments at the medical centers listed below.\n25.2931251.5018881 Hamad General Hospital, Hamad Medical City, Al Rayyan Rd, ☏ +974 4439 4444. 24 hours.\n25.2381551.4301232 Abu-Bakr Al-Sidiq Health Center, Furousiya St (Al Rayyan), ☏ +974 4468 1792.\n25.25582651.5576733 Airport Health Center, Al Matar St (Old Airport, near Family Food Center), ☏ +974 4467 5633.\n25.27703151.5454744 Umm Ghuwailina Health Center, Simaisma St, ☏ +974 4443 3892.\n25.27975251.4322255 Al Rayyan Health Center, Furousiya St, ☏ +974 4481 2668.\n\n## Stay safe\nDoha is a very safe city as far as crime goes, but exercise the usual precautions. You can call 999 if you need emergency police assistance.\n\n## Racism\nThere is informal segregation in place to prevent migrant labourers, who are overwhelmingly male and in Qatar without their families, from mingling with Qataris. For example, some shopping malls and public spaces enforce a \"Families-only entry policy\" (which includes single women) on weekends and public holidays. In theory, the prohibition should apply to all single men (Qatari or otherwise), but in practice the level of enforcement will vary based on your ethnicity. Asian (East, South and SE Asian) or African men will likely prohibited from entry during this time, while white or Qatari men will usually be admitted with no issues, or might just be expected to claim that their wives or mothers have already entered the mall. Even if you can prove you are a tourist or hold a Western passport, it is generally not wise to contest being banned from certain public spaces, or else you risk being further questioned or detained by police. One workaround is to join a tour group that is touring the public space you want to enter, as these groups will clearly and obviously signal that you are a tourist and not a migrant worker. Most notably, the eight largest malls in Doha and most parks ban access to all non-Arab and non-white men on weekends and holidays (or any other periods when a large number of migrant workers are likely to be on break). The Villaggio Mall and Souq Wakrah also ban access to non-Arab and non-white men on Fridays.\nNonetheless, tourist attractions will generally not turn you away, regardless of your background, so long as you are wearing smart casual dress (i.e. clean clothing and bottoms that cover your knees). For experiential travellers, visiting the Asian Town mall, which is devoted to migrant workers, may be of interest to better understand and appreciate the racialized experiences of Qatar's migrant worker majority.\n\n## Connect\nPre-paid SIM cards and top-up cards for Ooredoo and Vodafone can be purchased at mobile phone shops, as well as at Carrefour and Lulu hypermarkets.\nFree Wi-Fi is available in Souq Waqif, public parks including the Sheraton Park and Rumaila Park, and along the Corniche. Some coffee shops also offer free connection. Ooredoo HotSpots are scattered throughout Doha, mainly in hotels and cafés. HotSpot[dead link] cards in denominations of QR 30, 50, and 70 are available in any Ooredoo shop.\n\n## Currency exchange centres\nFor especially large denominations or more unusual currencies it is best to call beforehand to ensure the centre has the desired currency and amount on hand.\n25.2880851.535616 Lari Exchange, Souq Ahmed bin Ali (entrance on Al Teeb St), ☏ +974 4441 9010, fax: +974 4441 2224, lariex@qatar.net.qa.\nAldar Exchange.\n25.28651.535987 Al Zaman Exchange (next to the Alfarden Centre Building), ☏ +974 4444 1448, fax: +974 4432 5110, najada.doha@alzaman.com.qa.

This is the most reliable and unbiased source for local news.\nThe Peninsula, also available in print.\nGulf Times, also available in print.\nMarhaba lists current and upcoming events and exhibits in Doha.\nAl Jazeera English provides good regional coverage, but only rarely covers events within Qatar itself.\nBBC World Service broadcasts locally on 107.4MHz.\n\n## Go next\n25.03780251.4062278 Singing Sand Dunes. In the desert 40 km southwest of Doha are the so-called Singing Sand Dunes. This is one of 30 sites in the world with \"singing\" sand, once attributed to evil djinn. When the humidity is low and the wind blows along the sand, an eerie humming sound can be heard, which can be amplified by running across the sand, or by sledding down it. Large plastic bags (e.g. garbage bags) or large pieces of cardboard work particularly well for this. The dunes are a bit off road and can be tricky to find. Head SW of Doha on Salwa Rd; after about 13 km you will pass a large roundabout; after you come to the Mobil Petrol station make a U-turn and turn right on Messaieed Road. Drive past two roundabouts, then take the next right. Take the left fork at the T-junction, and you will see the dunes on your right. It is possible to make the trip in a 2WD, but a 4WD is better to get close to the bottom of the dunes. Free.\n\n## Caves\nThere are a number of karst caves in Qatar, the most well-known of them a short distance from Doha. All caves have not been fully explored, and it is believed that there is an extensive network of tunnels connecting many of them.\n25.17515351.2117119 Dhal Al Misfir (Misfir Sinkhole) (north of Salwa Rd). The most well-known of Qatar's caves, this 40 m-deep formation contains fibrous, faintly phosphorescent gypsum crystals. There is also a resident flock of cave-dwelling Little Owls (Athene noctua). For safety reasons the site is surrounded by a chainlink fence but the gate is unlocked and visitors may enter freely.\n25.12272451.22821210 Mudhlem Cave, Mukaynis (south of Salwa Rd near Earth Satellite Station). A 150 m-deep cave not far from the Misfir Sinkhole. The mouth is about 15m wide and there is a pool of brackish water at the bottom, which was once used as a source of drinking water by the local Bedouin. The cave is now a popular geocache site.\n\n## Desert safari\nIf you want to get out of the city, the desert awaits. Whereas you could take your rental car out to the sand dunes, unless you are familiar with the route or GPS, you run the risk of damaging your rental car and getting lost. The alternative is to go through one of Qatar's many licensed tour companies, which can arrange a trip. Additionally, there are a handful of sights outside of Doha which can only be accessed with prior government permission, which a tour company can arrange on your behalf. This will cost you several hundred Qatari riyals, and may require a minimum of four persons to join in the fun. At international hotels, the receptionists can advise you, and hire a driver for you. Otherwise, there are several tour companies that can arrange a trip by phone or via their website.\nBeyond sand dune trips, several of these companies can arrange for overnight desert camping, excursions to historical sites, and city tours.\n[formerly dead link]  Al Jasra Travel, 25 Ibn Dirham St (Al Mansoura), ☏ +974 4443 0737, fax: +974 4443 0787, info@aljasratravel.com.\nArabian Adventures, Al Asmakh St, ☏ +974 4436 1461, fax: +974 4436 1471, info@arabianadventureqatar.net.\nBlack Pearl Tourism, Al Sadd St, Bin Jeham Al Kuwari Complex (Al Sadd), ☏ +974 4435 7333, info@blackpearl.co.\nGulf Adventures Tourism, 29 Aspire Zone St (Al Rayyan), ☏ +974 4422 1888, fax: +974 4422 1866, info@gulf-adventures.com.\nQatar Inbound Tours, Concord Qatar, Rawdat Al Khail, Doha, ☏ +974 77451196, +974 55531002, info@inboundtoursqatar.com.

Drive south to visit the dhow harbor in Al Wakrah, and then hit the beach and go dune bashing near Mesaieed. Or drive north to see the fortress and prehistoric gravemounds near Umm Salal Muhammad, and continue on to kayak through the mangrove forests near Al Khor.",
