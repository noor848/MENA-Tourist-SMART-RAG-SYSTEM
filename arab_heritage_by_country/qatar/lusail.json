      "content": "Lusail (Arabic: لوسيل, ALA-LC: Lūsayl, Arabic pronunciation: [luːˈsajl]) is the second-largest city in Qatar after Doha, and the economic capital of Qatar, located on the coast, in the southern part of the municipality of Al Daayen. Lusail lies about 23 kilometres (14 mi) north of the Doha city centre, just north of the West Bay Lagoon, on over 38 square kilometres (15 sq mi) and will eventually have the infrastructure to accommodate 450,000 people. Of these, it is estimated that there will be 250,000 or fewer residents, 190,000 office workers and 60,000 retail workers.\nIt is planned to have marinas, residential areas, island resorts, commercial districts, luxury shopping and leisure facilities, a golf course community, man-made islands, and several entertainment districts. Development is being carried out by the state-controlled developer Qatari Diar along with Parsons Corporation and Dorsch-Gruppe.\nLusail Stadium was one of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and hosted the final. It is also the site of a Formula One race track where the first Qatar Grand Prix was held in 2021.\n\nEtymology\nLusail's name is derived from \"al wassail,\" a plant that grows bountifully in the area.\n\nHistory\n20th century\nIn 1908, J. G. Lorimer recorded Lusail in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. He wrote:\n\nA village on the east coast of Qatar about 15 miles north of Dohah: the principal residence at the present time of Shaikh Jasim, the head of the Al Thani family of Qatar. About 500 yards inland of the place is Jabal Lusail, a rocky hillock of some height which forms a landmark well known to mariners. On the summit of Jabal Lusail is a double-storeyed tower visible from several miles inland; and at the foot of the hill are three wells, one on the north and two on the west side; the water of these is extremely brackish. The village of Lusail consists of about 50 substantial stone and mud houses of Hamaidat and 2 or 3 of Ma'adhid, the latter being personal retainers of the Shaikh. To the village belong 9 pearl boats, 2 other sea-going vessels, and 3 fishing boats. Animals of transport are 20 horses and 70 camels. The house of the Shaikh stands about 200 yards to the south of the village: it was built about 1901 and is a four-sided, high-walled building of stone and plaster, adjoined by a few yards and out-houses and by a small mosque. It is called a fort, but it contains no guns. \n\nIn an earlier 1904 transcript of Lorimer's Gazetteer, he remarks that Sheikh Jassim first settled in Lusail in 1903 with a few allied tribes. Sheikh Jassim died and was buried in Lusail in July 1913. His base of operations, known as the \"Founder's Fort,\"' is recognized as a cultural icon of Qatar.\nHistoric evidence of the practice of date syrup manufacturing using a traditional date press called madbasa has been found in Lusail. While many of these presses have been abandoned or destroyed over the years,  a remaining installation can be observed at the historic residence of Sheikh Jassim.\n\n21st century\nPlans for the development of Lusail City were first announced in 2005. After a cabinet resolution was passed in 2002, Lusail along with its suburbs of Al Kharayej and Jabal Thuaileb became the first areas of Qatar where foreigners could own real estate. In December 2013, Qatari Diar announced that more than 80% of the plots in Lusail have been purchased. It was stated in April 2018 that over 80% of the city's infrastructure projects were completed.\nOn 26 November 2022, during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a large fire broke out in a building under construction near Qetaifan Island North about 3.5 km away from Lusail Stadium where multiple World Cup games were scheduled to occur. The Civil Defense controlled the fires in three warehouses and no injuries or casualties were sustained.\nIn March 2023, the United Nations House at Lusail was opened. As the main representative office of the United Nations in the country, it will serve to improve the partnership between the Qatari government and the UN.\n\nGeography\nBoundaries of the city  run from the Persian Gulf in the east, to the Al Khor Coastal Road in the west, and for roughly 7 km (4.3 mi) north of the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Doha. Not included in city boundaries is the district of Al Egla which hosts the Doha Golf Club.\nTwo nearby settlements to the south of the original town of Lusail, Al Kharayej and Jabal Thuaileb (Fox Hills), have been incorporated into Lusail as standalone districts. At the time the project was launched, these places were not inhabited. The only standing structures in the area were an Ooredoo station, a cement factory, and three farms, one of which was still in use. Youth would commonly use the area for recreational off-roading and on occasion, waste was dumped in its sabkhas (salt flats). Located to the north of the city are several abandoned fishing villages.\nGroundwater quality in the area is poor. On the city's border with the Persian Gulf, the groundwater elevation is 1 meter above sea level and flows east-to-west. Salinity levels are highest on the eastern side, at 40 ppt, compared to a low of 18 ppt in the western section; these levels are too high for consumption or use in agriculture. Because of the groundwater's high salinity, only salt- and drought-tolerant plants grow in this area. A geographic survey found 25 species of plants within city limits; all of which are found abundantly elsewhere on the peninsula.\nExcept for dogs and camels kept on a local farm, no mammals were recorded in the area during the initial environmental impact assessment. However, several species of snakes and lizards were found, including the spiny-tailed lizard which is common to Qatar. Nine species of birds were found to occur in the area, particularly in its mudflats. Grass coverage in its mudflat area is less than 30%, with most grass being found in soils with the highest sand content.\n\nDistricts\nLusail has 19 designated districts as part of the city's master plan. They are:\n\nGolf District\nAs its name suggests, the main attraction of the Golf District is its 18-hole golf course. Many high-end villas are situated within the golf course's vicinity. The city's education guidelines state that there will be one school occupying upwards of 55,000 m2 (590,000 sq ft) for kindergarten to secondary students.\n\nNorth Residential District\nOnce fully completed, the North Residential District will feature 895 large villas spread over an area of 126 hectares. As part of the city's educational plan, there will be six schools in this district, 4 of which are kindergartens, with the other two accommodating kindergarten to secondary students.\n\nWaterfront Residential District\nHigh-rise housing units with a panoramic view of Lusail's coastline are under construction here. Two schools are planned for here.\n\nAl Kharayej Towers\nOriginally a rural settlement on the outskirts of Doha, Al Kharayej has been reformed as a district of Lusail under the name Al Kharayej Towers. Bounded by the Golf District and the Waterfront Residential District, this district will consist of 42 high-rise apartment complexes built in a mixed-Arabic style. A 7,750 m2 (83,400 sq ft) kindergarten will serve this district.\n\nStadium District\nAs a result of Qatar winning the hosting rights to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, it was decided that a massive stadium should be constructed in Lusail. The outcome was the Lusail Iconic Stadium, which hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final game between Argentina and France. Sports fans are able to access the district through the Lusail LRT and the Doha Metro.\n\nEnergy City 1\nFirst launched in 2006, Energy City 1 is meant to be a major business hub for the country's oil and gas industry. The International Mercantile Exchange, a trading platform for energy, will be centered in the district. Microsoft was said to be assisting in developing the technology infrastructure. In July 2013, CEO of Energy City Hesham Al Emadi revealed that, as a result of many requests for office space by non energy-related companies, the city will be converted to a mixed-use facility.\n\nWaterfront Commercial District\nAlso known as Seef Lusail, the Waterfront Commercial District will serve as a hub for shopping malls and other commercial establishments. A small amount of land in this district has been designated for residential and office use. City developers have planned two kindergartens for this district.\n\nFox Hills\nDevelopment of Fox Hills as a residential district was commenced in 2006. In 2013, officials claimed that it would receive its first inhabitants for its under-development residential complexes in 2014.\nIn 2015, the community was said to accommodate 9,200 apartments ranging from 5 to 7 stories. Many of the buildings were constructed with traditional architectural elements in order to represent Qatari heritage. Most major infrastructure projects for electricity, water, and streets were completed in the same year.\nNumerous parks are found in this district, including the Crescent Park. Three schools are planned for the northern section: a kindergarten, a primary school, and a secondary school. In the southern section, two schools are under construction.\n\nAl Erkyah\nLocated along the Al Khor Coastal Road, Al Erkyah will be a mixed-use district comprising mainly open space, commercial and medical facilities. According to the education guidelines published by the city, one 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) primary school will be based here.\n\nEnergy City 2\nThis district, found next to the industrial-oriented Energy City 1, will consist mainly of residential units, especially for residents who are employed in Energy City 1. In the future it is planned to contain a school for children aged 3 to 18 spanning a roughly 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) area.\n\nEntertainment City\nA designated entertainment district, Entertainment City will contain over 2,000 housing units, 11 hotels, and several theme parks, nightclubs, and shopping malls. Place Vendôme is a major mall being constructed in the city and will feature a canal that runs the length of the mall, an amusement park, and a cinema complex. In regards to education, there will be one 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) primary school here.\n\nEntertainment Island\nThis district will play host to a large-scale museum in the future.\n\nMedical and Education District\nMost of Lusail's medical and education facilities will be based here. Furthermore, there will be a small amount of residences here. Much green space will be spread throughout the district.\n\nQatarEnergy District\nServing Qatar's chief energy company QatarEnergy, this district will host the new headquarters of QP. Transport will be facilitated by the Lusail LRT and the adjacent Al Khor Coastal Road.\n\nMarina District\nOne of the main attractions of the Marina district will be Katara Hospitality's tourism complex known as Lusail Marina Iconic Development. When completed, the complex will feature leisure facilities, luxury restaurants, and upwards of 800 hotel and apartment rooms.\nAnother attraction is the Marina Twin Towers, which comprises 8,236 m2 (88,650 sq ft) of office space. Retail demand will be mainly be met by Lusail Marina Mall, which will cover an area of 57,605 m2 (620,060 sq ft).\nIt is planned for two primary schools to be built here, one exclusively for boys and the other exclusively for girls.\n\nQetaifan Islands\nIn large part, Qetaifan Island North will consist of tourist attractions such as water parks and hotels.\nQetaifan Island South is composed of three islands. Prospective luxury villas, a marina waterfront, and marketplaces will be built here. Furthermore, a school for primary and secondary students is planned.\n\nBoulevard Commercial\nAs the central hub of Lusail, retail and office space will be found here. Its street and buildings will be inspired by the Champs-Élysées avenue in France. Three kindergartens are in the works for this district.\nLusail Boulevard in Downtown Lusail embodies a quintessential contemporary urbanism fused with Qatar's cultural fabric. A dynamic shopping, commercial, and residential destination, Lusail Boulevard is designed to be one of the focal points of Lusail’s downtown and provide easy access to pedestrians.\n\nLusail Plaza Towers\nThis district will contain office and commercial towers. Lusail's tallest structure is found here, the Lusail Plaza Towers. Two buildings are 301 metres (988 ft) and the two other 215 m (705 ft) high and have 220 floors in the four towers complex. It was begun in 2020 and will be completed in October 2023 (core and shell+ lobby finishings)  The 1.1 million-square-metre development is host to the headquarters for the Qatar National Bank, Qatar Central Bank and Qatar Investment Authority alongside several other global organisations including Qatari Diar. Lusail Plaza Towers was designed by Foster & Partners.\n\nLandmarks\nLusail Marina Arch\nLusail Marina Arch is a 74 metres (243 ft) tall sculpture at Marina Interchange.\n\nAl Wahda Arches\nDesigned by Erik Behrens, Al Wahda Arches stand at 100 metres (330 ft) tall. It is located at the beginning of the Lusail Expressway, and its design is meant to represent the net that the pearl divers of Qatar's past would have used. Construction was completed in 2020, and the structure consists of two slanted arches with a connected net.\n\nSports\nLocated just outside the city is the Losail International Circuit, which has hosted the Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix every year since 2004. Since 2007 it has been the opening round of the MotoGP world championship, and in 2008 floodlights were installed in the facility, making it the only race on the calendar to be held at night. In November 2021, the track also hosted the inaugural Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix as a replacement for the canceled Australian Grand Prix. Recently the track signed a new 10-year contract with F1, meaning that the track will host the Qatar Grand Prix until 2033. WEC (FIA World Endurance Championship) will also hold an endurance race on the track from 2024. This will make Losail the first track in the Middle East to hold F1, MotoGP, and WEC in the same season.\nThe first Qatari Diar Triathlon was held in the Spring of 2019 in Lusail City-Marina Promenade. The city was also announced as host of the 2025 T100 Triathlon World Championship final.\nLusail Sports Arena is another sporting venue in the city and hosted matches of the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship. Constructed at a cost of $318 million, it has a capacity of 15,300 spectators and opened its doors in 2012.\nLusail Stadium, with a capacity of 88,000+ people, hosted the Final of the 2022 FIFA 'World' Cup. The stadium's design is inspired from the sail of a traditional dhow as the city is located north of Doha on the eastern coast, which is a historic focal point of pearling vessels. The architects are MANICA Architecture and Foster and Partners.\nThe city will host matches for the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup including the final phase.\n\nEducation\nAs part of Lusail's master plan, the city is ultimately set to contain 36 schools with a capacity for 26,000 students. Upwards of 75,000 m2 (810,000 sq ft) has already been reserved for school buildings by the Lusail City Real Estate Development Company; these schools are expected to be commissioned by 2019. Universities in Lusail include Lusail University, UKM - Qatar (The National University of Malaysia - Qatar), and CUQ Ulster University.\n\nEconomy\nNumerous non-energy-related companies are also headquartered in Lusail. Hotel operator and developer Katara Hospitality is based in the city, as is Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company and its subsidiaries, such as Lusail Real Estate Development Company and utilities company Marafeq Qatar. Qatari Diar was responsible for launching the Lusail City Development Project in 2005.\nThe Lusail Industrial Area hosts many construction companies. In the Lusail Ready-Mix Batching Plant Zone, two ready-mix batching plants are maintained by Qatar Alpha Beton Ready Mix, one ready-mix batching plant is maintained by SMEET, REDCO owns a precast plant, Qatar Concrete has 1 ready-mix batching plant, and HBK ReMIX operates a ready-mix factory.\n\nInfrastructure\nUtilities\nA network of gas pipelines will transport synthetic natural gas (SNG) to the city. Distributed by a gas pipeline with a length upwards of 150 km2 (58 sq mi), up to 28,000 m3 (990,000 cu ft) per hour of natural gas will be fed from the Lusail City Gas Farm. Lusail's SNG system was developed as part of a joint venture between the National Gas Company of Oman and Qatari company Petro Serv Limited. In regards to power stations, 66 kV and 11 kV substations will be constructed. The latter will be built underground in specialized structures. Portions of the 66 kV substations connecting from mainland Lusail to the Qetaifan Islands are planned to be set up under the sea bed and run through utility tunnels.\n\nGreen spaces\nNumerous public parks are housed throughout Lusail's districts. In the Fox Hills district, for example, 33 parks provide around 10.3 hectares of green space. One of the largest parks is called Crescent Park. This park includes a forested area, an all-giraffe zoo, playgrounds, water features, bike trails, kiosks, monuments, and several sports fields. In addition, there are several small-to-mid-sized parks known as pocket gardens which contain fewer facilities than parks. There are 18 of these situated in the Marina district, occupying an overall space of more than 26,000 m2 (280,000 sq ft). Also in the Marina district are roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) of promenades along the waterfront.\n\nHousing & accommodation\nOnce fully completed, Lusail is expected to house 250,000 residents. Future developments will see this capacity potentially increase to 450,000. Currently, 22 hotels are operating or under construction in the city.\nKatara Hospitality stated that they would be constructing a luxury resort comprising a water park and a four-star hotel on the Qetaifan Island North in October 2017. Another project by Katara Hospitality, 'Katara Towers', was launched in October 2012 at a cost of QR 2.2 billion.

      "title": "Lusail",
      "content": "Lusail ou Losail (en arabe : لوسيل) est une ville nouvelle au Qatar, située sur la côte dans la partie nord de la subdivision d'Umm Salal, à environ 15 kilomètres au nord du centre-ville de Doha, juste au nord du Lagon de la Baie Ouest. La ville nouvelle compte environ 200 000 habitants sur 35 km2.\nOn y trouve notamment le circuit international de Losail.\nLa ville a accueilli des matchs du Championnat du monde masculin de handball 2015, dont la finale. En 2022, Lusail accueille plusieurs matchs de la Coupe du monde de football dont la finale opposant l'Argentine à la France.\n\nGéographie\nLusail est située à 22 km au nord du centre de Doha. Elle se déploie sur 38 km2, bordée à l'est par le golfe Persique.\n\nHistorique\nLa construction de la ville est lancée en 2006, deux ans après l'organisation du premier Grand Prix moto du Qatar sur le circuit international de Losail. Le site, identifié jusqu'alors comme une route dans le désert, est revenu pour une référence historique, il s'agit du lieu où cheikh Jassim al-Thani (en) a établi le premier fort de l'émirat au début du XIXe siècle.\nAprès l’attribution de l'organisation de la Coupe du monde de football 2022 en décembre 2010, le projet accélère. La ville devient le plus gros chantier de développement urbain entrepris pour un coût estimé à 45 milliards de dollars, un cinquième de l'investissement du pays pour les infrastructures liées à l'organisation de la Coupe du monde de football. La ville doit accueillir la finale de la compétition dans un stade de 86 000 personnes à construire et imagine autour une ville futuriste avec un parc zoologique de girafes, un dôme de ski et un parc d'attractions.\nEn 2014, le plan de construction de la ville prévoit dix-neuf quartiers d'affaires, d'habitations, de centres commerciaux et d'hôtellerie prévus pour une population de 450 000 personnes, 250 000 résidents et 200 000 employés et travailleurs. Les étrangers peuvent investir dans l’immobilier à Lusail, le plus souvent avec un bail de 99 ans. L'île de Qetafian, presque-île construite artificiellement, est prévue comme le centre touristique de Lusail avec des stations balnéaires, des plages et un port de plaisance permettant d'accueillir de luxueux yachts. Le plan comprend également la construction de deux parcours de golf, de stations balnéaires implantées sur l'île, d'un réseau de métro léger (3 lignes, 19 km, 25 stations). L'un des premiers projets fini a été le quartier résidentiel de Fox Hills.\nEn avril 2022, un centre commercial de grande taille, sur quatre étages et une surface de 1 150 000 m2, intitulé Place Vendôme et inspiré du style architectural parisien, est inauguré dans la ville. Pendant la Coupe du monde, de nombreux officiels de la FIFA logent dans les deux luxueux hôtels des Katara Towers, autour duquel de nombreux travaux sont encore en cours au moment de la compétition.\n\nNotes et références\n(en) Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé « Lusail » (voir la liste des auteurs).\n\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nKatara Towers\nStade de Lusail\nLusail (métro de Doha)\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\n\n Portail du Qatar",

      "content": "## Overview\nOnce little more than a minuscule pearl fishing village, Doha (Arabic: الدوحة ad-Dawḥa), Qatar's capital, with more people than the rest of Qatar combined, has emerged to become one of the pearls of the Middle East. It is one of the most rapidly-developing cities on the Persian Gulf, akin to the development seen in nearby Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and is aiming to become a centre of international trade and travel.\nWe also cover the neighbouring cities of Al Rayyan and Lusail in this article, as they are effectively part of the Doha urban area.\n\n## Understand\nFor most of its history, Doha was a poor fishing village dependent on pearl diving, and was regarded as a sleepy backwater until the early 1990s. Following the accession of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani as Emir in 1995, however, Qatar quickly began to modernize, and Doha is now taking huge strides to catch up with other nearby Gulf cities. Development was accelerated by hosting the Asian Games in 2006 and the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The city is very much a work-in-progress, with a rapidly growing skyline and new buildings sprouting up almost like mushrooms.\nFor most visitors, Doha is synonymous with Qatar, as the vast majority of the country's population resides in the capital city. Doha has an astonishingly diverse population – only 13% of its residents are Qataris. Although Arabic is Qatar's official language, English is the lingua franca; most retail and service staff are foreigners and do not speak Arabic. Doha is also now one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, as workers continue to pour in to help build the developing economy.\nDoha is fairly liberal by the standards of the Islamic world, though less so than its main rival Dubai and most Western countries. Alcohol and pork are legal for non-Muslim foreign residents, and non-Muslim women are not required to wear the hijab, though dressing in very skimpy outfits is still illegal. That said, Qatar is an absolute monarchy, so criticising the Emir is a crime. Homosexuality is also a crime that carries the death penalty (though not actively enforced), so gay visitors should be as discreet as possible.\nIf you've visited before, be assured that Doha today is not the same as it was just a couple of years ago, and will be very different again in a few years time.\n\n## Read\nMohanalakshmi Rajakumar, From Dunes to Dior. Written by a resident Indian-American, this is a collection of insightful essays about life as an expatriate in Doha.\nMohanalakshmi Rajakumar, Love Comes Later. Set in Doha and London, this novel examines Qatari culture and how young Qataris are now challenging the status quo. The book is not available in Qatar as it has been banned by the Qatari Ministry of Culture.\n\n## By plane\n25.27305651.6080561 Hamad International Airport (DOH IATA). The primary point of entry for most travellers, it is the hub and base for Qatar Airways, which has positioned itself as one of the \"Big Three\" Middle Eastern airlines. It has built a far-reaching network, flying to destinations in Europe, South and East Asia, Australia, Africa and the Americas.\nCompared to Dubai, the home of Qatar Airways' arch-rival Emirates, Doha is served by much fewer other carriers. The major European airlines usually provide a single connection to Doha from their main hubs (e.g. Lufthansa from Frankfurt, KLM from Amsterdam), but minor ones do not. Pretty much all airlines of the Middle East, Turkey included (but not Israel), provide connections to Doha. Relatively few Asian airlines do so, however, with the exception of a relatively good choice of connections to India and Pakistan.\nQatar Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance (which includes e.g. British Airways), and an increasing number of their connections are also on offer as codeshare flights by Oneworld members.\nIf you're arriving from outside of the Persian Gulf region, probably the most economical way to visit is to use Qatar as an intermediate stopover en route to another destination. Prices of tickets originating in or terminating in Doha are artificially high because of limited competition, while prices for transit tickets are very competitive, as Qatar Airways continues working to build Doha as a global transit hub.\nPublic Wi-Fi is provided free of charge throughout the airport.\n\n## By car\nSeveral car rental agencies are found in and around Doha International Airport. The rental desks are not that easy to find and the signs to them are poor.  They are on the lower floor in the car park area.  The popular agencies include Hertz, Avis[dead link] and Budget. These rental agencies offer seasonal discounts and it is advisable to check their websites before booking. If you're looking to rent a car, it is best to reserve in advance, to ensure a good price and minimise wait times. As of late 2013, visitors can drive a rental car for six months with an international driving licence. However, the laws regarding driving licences change almost yearly; visitors are advised to verify this information before arrival.\nDriving in Qatar is on the right hand side of the road, with similar traffic rules to elsewhere in the world. However, because Doha residents come from all corners of the globe, driving styles vary wildly. Also, road rage is becoming more of a problem.\nExpansion of the road network has not kept up with the explosive population growth, so drivers will encounter frequent traffic jams and numerous diversions due to road construction. With the addition of new roads, and the renaming of old roads, even the latest available road maps may be out-of-date.  This also applies to satellite imagery, which can be outdated, even when it is only a few months old.  So do not rely on Google Earth, OpenStreetMap or your TomTom.\n\n## By metro\nThe Doha Metro[dead link], which opened in May 2019, is the third rapid transit system in the Gulf, representing a new wave of transit projects in the region. It has three lines: the Red Line from Lusail in the north to Al Wakra in the south or the airport depending on the train, the east-west Gold Line that features a stop at the National Museum, and the Green Line, which focuses on educational institutions in particular and has a stop at the National Library. Msheireb serves as the transfer station between every line.\nLike the Dubai Metro, there are premium cars with better seating and higher prices. A one-way trip costs QR 2 (QR 10 for VIP) and a day pass costs QR 6 (QR 30 for VIP). You pay by tapping your card when you enter and exit the system. Cards are not expensive and can be purchased at any station. You don’t have to do anything special to get the day pass; after you pay for 3 rides the system will not charge you for the rest of the day.\nThere are free \"metrolink\"[dead link] feeder bus services for \"last-mile\" connectivity to areas not served by the Metro (see the link for schedules and routes). In addition, there is a free (with Metro trip) ride-sharing service called \"metroexpress\"[dead link], but it only serves two stations (West Bay and DICC) and requires registration and a separate account.\nEvery metro station has a restroom with baby changing table and an ablution room, right after the turnstiles. The two rooms are next to each other; the women’s rooms are indicated by a person wearing black clothing, and the men’s rooms by the person wearing white clothing.\n\n## By bus\n25.2852451.536342 Public bus, Al Ghanim (main bus station) (near the Gold Souq), info@mowasalat.com. The public bus system is operated by the government-owned Mowasalat, which runs a wide network of routes catering for most of Doha, along with adjacent and surrounding towns. Fares within the city cost between QR 3-9 and are payable with exact change, or with a Karwa Smartcard [dead link], available for purchase at the bus station. For visitors, the route maps can be cryptic, with fairly infrequent service on some routes; additionally buses are frequently behind schedule. There are dedicated sections at the front of buses for women and families; however, in practice, some routes, particularly those to and from industrial areas, are used predominantly by male labourers and best avoided by women travellers. Timetables are online, some available to download; route maps are available only at the main bus station.\nShuttle bus, ☏ +974 4458 8888 (Mowasalat), info@mowasalat.com. Daily 06:00-00:00 every 15 min. In order to ease ever-increasing traffic congestion, Mowasalat  operates a free shuttle bus service, servicing passengers with two routes in the West Bay (downtown) area; plans are underway to offer more routes. A route map (Arabic and English) is available for download. Friday service is 'family only', i.e. solo men are not permitted. Free.\n\n## By tour bus\nDoha Bus, ☏ +974 4442 2444, +974 5534 2964 (mobile), admin@dohabus.com. It offers a hop-on, hop-off tourist bus service, with stops at various locations between the Marriott Hotel and the Pearl-Qatar. Buses arrive at each stop every 20 minutes. Tickets are QR 180 (adult), QR 90 (children) and valid for 24 hours; bookings can be made on-line at its website, also via telephone and email. If you're doing this on your last day in Doha, they will arrange to pick you up at one of the main stops along the route and transfer you back to the airport for a not-unreasonable QR 50. (updated Mar 2023)\n\n## By taxi\nOther than public transport, the only alternative to not renting a vehicle is taxis. There are many taxi services, two of them also operated by Mowasalat: Karwa and Al Million. Uber is also a popular alternative to these two. Keep in mind that TaxiF services are, at the time of editing, illegal, so do not book a ride from them. The other main \"Limousine\" taxis are available, which are unmarked, much more expensive (often two to four times the cost of Karwas) and may not carry a meter. If you feel sure about the fare, you can negotiate it up front, but it is advisable to insist on a meter.\nBecause of increasing complaints regarding taxis, some precautions should be taken. For nearly all journeys within Doha the tariff should be set to '1', and for journeys at night or outside of Doha it should be set to '0'. Airport taxis have a single tariff, which begins at QR 25. Reports of tampered meters are on the rise (look for black tape or paper), as are reports of drivers locking the doors or refusing to open the trunk without extra payment. If the driver refuses to use the meter, the ride should be free, but you may have trouble exercising this right. If you have problems, you can call the police at 999, at which point the driver will suddenly be very cooperative.\nThe demand for taxis far exceeds the supply and waiting times may vary greatly. During morning business hours, companies usually require 24 hours notice if you need a taxi; however in practice, even this is unreliable as the scheduled taxi often doesn't show up. At other times, it may take upwards of 90 minutes for an on-call taxi to arrive, and hailing one may be impossible in many places. The only places where you are guaranteed to find a taxi (normal or limousine) are at major malls, the airport and international hotels. The acute shortage has led to a thriving market for unlicensed, or unofficial, taxi services, most with a steady clientele. For visitors, the best way to find a reliable driver is to ask around – many residents, particularly expats, hire such drivers regularly and will happily share contact information.\nOccasionally, you may find a local driver will stop and offer to give you a ride if he or she sees you looking lost on the side of the road. It is customary to offer some money at the end, though sometimes they will refuse to take it. If a driver slows down and flashes their headlights, they are usually signalling they're willing to give you a lift; beckon them over with a wave in response. However, hitchhiking always has its risks, and it is not an advisable practice for solo women.\n\n## By tram\nThere is a tram service in Lusail and Msheireb Downtown, the latter being free to use.\n\n## Museums\nThe National Museum, Museum of Islamic Art, and Museum of Modern Art have a single three-day ticket for QR 85. Alternatively you can visit just one of them for QR 50.\n25.29527851.5391671 Museum of Islamic Arts, Next to Doha Port, on the Corniche (Route 76 bus; shuttle bus), ☏ +974 4422 4444.

VCUQatar have a small gallery, with exhibitions which change every few months, in their campus on Education City, which is open to everyone (sign in at reception). Because of the ongoing building works at Education City, it's a nightmare to get from Mathaf to here, but when the trams are running it should be an easy side-trip from there!\n25.2868951.528898 Msheireb Museums (متاحف_مشيرب). M-Sa 09:00-17:00; open F until 21:, closed Su.

Built in 1880 during the Ottoman period, this big white fort is in what is now the parking lot of Souq Waqif. At the time it was built, however, the fort was on the outskirts of the city. It was used as an ethnographic museum, the building is undergoing renovations and is closed, although it is still a popular place to take photos.\n25.288951.5356411 Fanar Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, Abdullah Bin Jassim St (near the Corniche and Souq Waqif), ☏ +974 4425 0169, info@fanar.qa.

The house is not open to the public, but can be viewed from the outside.\n25.288451.532914 Souq Waqif. Closed for lunch 12:30-15:30. Souq Waqif is the renovated Arabic market quarter, where one can easily wander around the maze-like corridors for hours. The souq is organized more or less by what is sold. There is a section of spice shops, another of textiles, and even a quarter with falcons for sale. Stables with Arabian horses are not far from the falcons, and camels are kept near Al Koot Fort and the parking lot. Also look for places to buy souvenirs, sit down to smoke a Sheesha, or enjoy food at one of the restaurants bordering it. Traditionally-dressed Qatari police occasionally patrol the souq area, in the morning mounted on camels and in the evening on horseback. The souq was completely rebuilt on the site of an older souq, and therefore can feel somewhat artificial; however it is a very popular place for locals, particularly on weekends.\n25.3160151.53156415 Msheireb Enrichment Centre, barge docked off the Corniche, next to the Sheraton, ☏ +974 33197482, +974 33192305, mec@msheireb.com.

The village is open only for Ramadan, Eid, and special cultural festivals.\n25.28352651.53351420 Al Najada (south of Souq Waqif). For a glimpse of some older Qatari architecture, it can be worthwhile to wander around some of the older neighborhoods surrounding Souq Waqif, particularly the small neighborhood to the immediate south of the souq. There are still a few notable old villas and mosques which predate the mostly 1970s-era buildings; given the pace of redevelopment in Doha it is unclear how much longer they will survive. Best explored on foot. (As the current inhabitants are exclusively male immigrants, women will feel uncomfortable without a male companion.)      (updated Jan 2024)\n25.32146851.44278621 House of Sheikh Abdullah bin Thani Al-Thani, Al Luqta St (near the Education City Roundabout).

The building is not open to the public, but can be viewed from the outside.\n\n## Other sights\n25.294551.523922 Corniche. The visual highlight of Doha is Al-Corniche, a long seaside promenade that curves around Doha Bay and affords pretty views of Palm Tree Island and the city's skyscrapers. In the afternoons you will see plenty of locals strolling, often trying to get out of the way of the odd crazy Western ex-pat on rollerblades. It's also a good place for jogging. Cycling is prohibited. If you're looking to have the scenery all to yourself, go on a Friday morning.      \nHighlights along the Corniche (from east to west) include an informal morning fish market, the MIA (Museum of Islamic Art), the 'Water Pots' fountain, the giant Oyster and Pearl sculpture, the Dhow Harbour (with traditional wooden dhows), and a giant 'Orry' statue (the mascot for the 2006 Asian Games).\nHighlights along the Corniche (from east to west) include an informal morning fish market, the MIA (Museum of Islamic Art), the 'Water Pots' fountain, the giant Oyster and Pearl sculpture, the Dhow Harbour (with traditional wooden dhows), and a giant 'Orry' statue (the mascot for the 2006 Asian Games).\n25.3008751.5173823 Al Bidda Park (Rumeila Park), The Corniche.

However, iftar or the breaking of the fast after sunset, is a very elaborate event, as locals gather for large communal meals.  Many establishments set up large tents for iftar, and non-Muslim visitors are welcome to partake in them; just make sure you reserve way in advance due to their popularity.\nAs Qatar is a Muslim country, nearly all food in Doha is halal. Pork is not served at restaurants, but is available to foreign residents with a liquor license at the two liquor stores run by the Qatar Distribution Company (QDC).

A particularly popular place is Chapati & Karak (☏ +974 4408 1408) at Katara Cultural Village.\nMost international coffee chains (including the ubiquitous Starbucks) are well-represented here, especially in shopping malls.\n25.2624951.528921 PappaRoti, C Ring Rd, ☏ +974 4421 2001, info@papparoti.ae.

There are quite a few 5-star international chain hotels in Doha and there are scores of new 5-star hotels on the rise, such as the Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, and Intercontinental. More modest choices come in shorter supply.\n\n## Budget\n25.31676751.4643321 Doha B - Qatar Youth Hostels Association, 17 Al Rayyan St (behind Al-Ali market), ☏ +974 4421 7157, info@qataryha.com.\nLa Villa Hotel, QR 130 if you book online.

In a slightly out of the way location, but since nowhere in Doha is really walkable, that's not a huge strike against it. It has two towers of excellent 4-star rooms and a selection of restaurants few hotels can match: the Mexican is acceptable, the pan-Asian quite good, the buffet nothing special, and the Indian really great. Alcohol is available in the restaurants, but there is no cocktail lounge or bar. There is a disco attached to the hotel that has a door policy to match Studio 54 at its 1970s' peak (again though, showing up in a Maserati will get you whisked inside).\n25.28340951.5278836 Mercure Doha, Wadi Musherib St, ☏ +974 4446 2222, fax: +974 4443 9186, reservations@mercure.com.qa.

A comfortable 4-star hotel with a few pleasant surprises. The Indian restaurant is one of the best in town (and, because it's in a hotel, it serves alcohol). The pub on the hotel's ground floor is a large club that on weekends comes alive as a disco under the guidance of a Filipino cover band and hundreds of Asian workers letting loose after a hard 6-day work week. The Library Bar, on the hotel's top floor, has a small, slightly worn clubby field populated by large-bellied expats. But the beer is cold and the mural around the walls is something to behold.\n25.32915851.5314729 Somerset West Bay Doha, Diplomatic Area, ☏ +974 4420 3333, enquiry.doha@the-ascott.com.

Other smaller, private hospitals will charge for any emergency services.\n999 is the emergency number for ambulance, police, and fire service. You will likely need to give directions or a nearby landmark.

You can call 999 if you need emergency police assistance.\n\n## Racism\nThere is informal segregation in place to prevent migrant labourers, who are overwhelmingly male and in Qatar without their families, from mingling with Qataris. For example, some shopping malls and public spaces enforce a \"Families-only entry policy\" (which includes single women) on weekends and public holidays. In theory, the prohibition should apply to all single men (Qatari or otherwise), but in practice the level of enforcement will vary based on your ethnicity. Asian (East, South and SE Asian) or African men will likely prohibited from entry during this time, while white or Qatari men will usually be admitted with no issues, or might just be expected to claim that their wives or mothers have already entered the mall. Even if you can prove you are a tourist or hold a Western passport, it is generally not wise to contest being banned from certain public spaces, or else you risk being further questioned or detained by police. One workaround is to join a tour group that is touring the public space you want to enter, as these groups will clearly and obviously signal that you are a tourist and not a migrant worker. Most notably, the eight largest malls in Doha and most parks ban access to all non-Arab and non-white men on weekends and holidays (or any other periods when a large number of migrant workers are likely to be on break). The Villaggio Mall and Souq Wakrah also ban access to non-Arab and non-white men on Fridays.\nNonetheless, tourist attractions will generally not turn you away, regardless of your background, so long as you are wearing smart casual dress (i.e. clean clothing and bottoms that cover your knees). For experiential travellers, visiting the Asian Town mall, which is devoted to migrant workers, may be of interest to better understand and appreciate the racialized experiences of Qatar's migrant worker majority.\n\n## Connect\nPre-paid SIM cards and top-up cards for Ooredoo and Vodafone can be purchased at mobile phone shops, as well as at Carrefour and Lulu hypermarkets.\nFree Wi-Fi is available in Souq Waqif, public parks including the Sheraton Park and Rumaila Park, and along the Corniche. Some coffee shops also offer free connection. Ooredoo HotSpots are scattered throughout Doha, mainly in hotels and cafés. HotSpot[dead link] cards in denominations of QR 30, 50, and 70 are available in any Ooredoo shop.\n\n## Currency exchange centres\nFor especially large denominations or more unusual currencies it is best to call beforehand to ensure the centre has the desired currency and amount on hand.\n25.2880851.535616 Lari Exchange, Souq Ahmed bin Ali (entrance on Al Teeb St), ☏ +974 4441 9010, fax: +974 4441 2224, lariex@qatar.net.qa.\nAldar Exchange.\n25.28651.535987 Al Zaman Exchange (next to the Alfarden Centre Building), ☏ +974 4444 1448, fax: +974 4432 5110, najada.doha@alzaman.com.qa.

This is the most reliable and unbiased source for local news.\nThe Peninsula, also available in print.\nGulf Times, also available in print.\nMarhaba lists current and upcoming events and exhibits in Doha.\nAl Jazeera English provides good regional coverage, but only rarely covers events within Qatar itself.\nBBC World Service broadcasts locally on 107.4MHz.\n\n## Go next\n25.03780251.4062278 Singing Sand Dunes. In the desert 40 km southwest of Doha are the so-called Singing Sand Dunes. This is one of 30 sites in the world with \"singing\" sand, once attributed to evil djinn. When the humidity is low and the wind blows along the sand, an eerie humming sound can be heard, which can be amplified by running across the sand, or by sledding down it. Large plastic bags (e.g. garbage bags) or large pieces of cardboard work particularly well for this. The dunes are a bit off road and can be tricky to find. Head SW of Doha on Salwa Rd; after about 13 km you will pass a large roundabout; after you come to the Mobil Petrol station make a U-turn and turn right on Messaieed Road. Drive past two roundabouts, then take the next right. Take the left fork at the T-junction, and you will see the dunes on your right. It is possible to make the trip in a 2WD, but a 4WD is better to get close to the bottom of the dunes. Free.\n\n## Caves\nThere are a number of karst caves in Qatar, the most well-known of them a short distance from Doha. All caves have not been fully explored, and it is believed that there is an extensive network of tunnels connecting many of them.\n25.17515351.2117119 Dhal Al Misfir (Misfir Sinkhole) (north of Salwa Rd). The most well-known of Qatar's caves, this 40 m-deep formation contains fibrous, faintly phosphorescent gypsum crystals. There is also a resident flock of cave-dwelling Little Owls (Athene noctua). For safety reasons the site is surrounded by a chainlink fence but the gate is unlocked and visitors may enter freely.\n25.12272451.22821210 Mudhlem Cave, Mukaynis (south of Salwa Rd near Earth Satellite Station). A 150 m-deep cave not far from the Misfir Sinkhole. The mouth is about 15m wide and there is a pool of brackish water at the bottom, which was once used as a source of drinking water by the local Bedouin. The cave is now a popular geocache site.\n\n## Desert safari\nIf you want to get out of the city, the desert awaits. Whereas you could take your rental car out to the sand dunes, unless you are familiar with the route or GPS, you run the risk of damaging your rental car and getting lost. The alternative is to go through one of Qatar's many licensed tour companies, which can arrange a trip. Additionally, there are a handful of sights outside of Doha which can only be accessed with prior government permission, which a tour company can arrange on your behalf. This will cost you several hundred Qatari riyals, and may require a minimum of four persons to join in the fun. At international hotels, the receptionists can advise you, and hire a driver for you. Otherwise, there are several tour companies that can arrange a trip by phone or via their website.\nBeyond sand dune trips, several of these companies can arrange for overnight desert camping, excursions to historical sites, and city tours.\n[formerly dead link]  Al Jasra Travel, 25 Ibn Dirham St (Al Mansoura), ☏ +974 4443 0737, fax: +974 4443 0787, info@aljasratravel.com.\nArabian Adventures, Al Asmakh St, ☏ +974 4436 1461, fax: +974 4436 1471, info@arabianadventureqatar.net.\nBlack Pearl Tourism, Al Sadd St, Bin Jeham Al Kuwari Complex (Al Sadd), ☏ +974 4435 7333, info@blackpearl.co.\nGulf Adventures Tourism, 29 Aspire Zone St (Al Rayyan), ☏ +974 4422 1888, fax: +974 4422 1866, info@gulf-adventures.com.\nQatar Inbound Tours, Concord Qatar, Rawdat Al Khail, Doha, ☏ +974 77451196, +974 55531002, info@inboundtoursqatar.com.
