      "content": "Leptis or Lepcis Magna, (Arabic: لبدة الكبرى, romanized: Libda al-Kubrā) also known by other names in antiquity, was a prominent city of the Carthaginian Empire and Roman Libya at the mouth of the Wadi Lebda in the Mediterranean.\nEstablished as a Punic settlement prior to 500 BC, the city experienced significant expansion under Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211), who was born in the city. The 3rd Augustan Legion was stationed here to defend the city against Berber incursions. After the legion's dissolution under Gordian III in 238, the city was increasingly open to raids in the later part of the 3rd century. Diocletian reinstated the city as provincial capital, and it grew again in prosperity until it fell to the Vandals in 439. It was reincorporated into the Eastern Empire in 533 but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the Muslim invasion in c. 647 and was subsequently abandoned.\nAfter being abandoned, the city was remarkably preserved as it lay buried beneath layers of sand dunes. In the 1920s, the city was unearthed by Italian archaeologists during Italy's occupation of Libya. Its ruins are within present-day Al-Khums, Libya, 130 km (81 mi) east of Tripoli. They are among the best-preserved Roman sites in the Mediterranean.\n\nNames\nThe Punic name of the settlement was written LPQ (Punic: 𐤋𐤐𐤒) or LPQY (𐤋𐤐𐤒𐤉). This has been tentatively connected to the Semitic root (present in Arabic) LFQ, meaning \"to build\" or \"to piece together\", presumably in reference to the construction of the city.\nThis name was hellenized as Léptis (Ancient Greek: Λέπτις), also known as Léptis Megálē (Λέπτις μεγάλη, \"Greater Leptis\") distinguishing it from the \"Lesser Leptis\" closer to Carthage in modern-day Tunisia. It was also known by the Greeks as Neápolis (Νεάπολις, \"New Town\"). The latinization of these names was Lepcis or Leptis Magna (\"Greater Leptis\"), which also appeared as the \"Leptimagnese City\" (Latin: Leptimagnensis Civitas). The Latin demonym was \"Leptitan\" (Leptitanus). It was also known as Ulpia Traiana as a Roman colony, after Emperor Trajan of the Ulpia gens. Its Italian name is Lepti Maggiore, and in Arabic it is named Labdah (لَبْدَة).\n\nHistory\nPunics\nThe Punic city was founded in the second half of the 7th century BC. Little is known about Leptis during this time, but it appears to have been powerful enough to repel Dorieus's attempt to establish a Greek colony nearby around 515 BC. Like most Punic settlements, Leptis became part of the Carthaginian Empire and fell under Rome's control with Carthage's defeat in the Punic Wars. Leptis remained highly independent for a period after about 111 BC.\n\nRoman Republic\nThe Roman Republic sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. The city prospered and was even allowed to coin its own money in silver and bronze. Reflecting its blend of cultures, its coins bore Punic inscriptions but images of Hercules and Dionysus. Soon Italian merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior. The city depended primarily on the fertility of its surrounding farmland, where many olive-presses have been excavated. By 46 BC, its olive oil production was of such an extent that the city was able to provide three million pounds of oil annually to Julius Caesar as tax.\n\nRoman Empire\nKenneth D. Matthews Jr. writes:\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, Leptis Magna was classified as a civitas libera et immunis, or a free community, over which the governor had an absolute minimum of control. As such Leptis retain its two suphetes at the head of its government, with the mhzm, similar to the Roman aediles, as minor magistrates. In addition there were such sacred officials as the ʾaddir ʾararim or praefectus sacrorum, the nēquim ēlīm, and probably a sacred college of fifteen members.\n\nLeptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post. The city grew rapidly under Roman administration. During the reign of Nero, an amphitheater was constructed. The settlement was elevated to municipium in AD 64 or 65 and to colonia under Trajan (r. 98–117). The first known bishop of Leptis Magna was a certain priest called Victor who became pope in 189.\nLeptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in AD 193, as the hometown of emperor Septimius Severus. Septimius favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In AD 205, he and the imperial family visited the city and bestowed great honors. Among the changes that Severus introduced were the creation of a magnificent new forum and the rebuilding of the docks. The natural harbor had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used.\nLeptis prospered through trans-Saharan trade in various valuable goods, including ivory, wild animals for the gladiatorial arena, gold dust, carbuncle, precious woods like ebony, and ostrich feathers.\nLeptis overextended itself during this period.  During the Crisis of the 3rd Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the 365 tsunami, large parts of the city had been abandoned.  Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus, who demanded bribes to protect the city during a major tribal raid.  The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian I.  Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished \"for bringing false accusations\".  It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I.\n\nVandal Kingdom\nIn 439, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in AD 523 when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city.\n\nByzantine Empire\nBelisarius, general of Emperor Justinian I, recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of the Roman Empire ten years later, and in 533–4 it was re-incorporated into the empire. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Empire, but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. In 544, under the prefecture of Sergius, the city came under intensified attack of Berber tribes, and after some successes, Sergius was reduced to retreating into the city, with the  Leuathae tribal confederation camped outside the gate demanding payments. Sergius admitted eighty deputies into the city to present their demands, but when Sergius moved to leave the conference he was detained by the robe by one deputy and crowded by others. This provoked an officer of the prefect's guard to kill the deputy laying hands on the prefect, which resulted in a general massacre. The Berbers reacted with an all-out attack and Sergius was eventually forced to abandon Leptis and retreat to Carthage.\n\nIslamic conquest\nBy the 6th century, the city was fully Christianized. During the decade 565–578 AD, Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the Berber tribes as far south as the Fezzan in the Libyan desert and converted the Garamantes. Numerous new churches were built in the 6th century, but the city continued to decline, and by the time of the Arab conquest around 647 the city was mostly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force and a population of less than 1,000 inhabitants. By the 10th century, the city of Al-Khums had fully absorbed it.\n\nExcavation\nToday, the site of Leptis Magna is the site of some of the most impressive ruins of the Roman period.\n\nPart of an ancient temple was brought from Leptis Magna to the British Museum in 1816 and installed at the Fort Belvedere royal residence in England in 1826. It now lies in part of Windsor Great Park. The ruins are located between the south shore of Virginia Water and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.\n\nWhen Italians conquered Italian Libya in the early 20th century, they dedicated huge efforts to the rediscovery of Leptis Magna. In the early 1930s, Italian archeological research was able to show again the buried remains of nearly all the city. A 4th to 3rd century BC necropolis was found under the Roman theatre.\nIn June 2005, it was revealed that archaeologists from the University of Hamburg had been working along the coast of Libya when they uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century. The mosaics show with exceptional clarity depictions of a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue and staring at his slain opponent.  The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a balneae within a Roman villa at Wadi Lebda in Leptis Magna. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of representational mosaic art ever seen—a \"masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii.\"  The mosaics were originally discovered in the year 2000 but were kept secret in order to avoid looting. They are currently on display in the Leptis Magna Museum.\nThere were reports that Leptis Magna was used as a cover for tanks and military vehicles by pro-Gaddafi forces during the First Libyan Civil War in 2011. When asked if the historic site could be targeted in an airstrike, NATO refused to rule out the possibility of such an action, saying that it had not been able to confirm the rebels' report that weapons were being hidden at the location. Shortly after the war, Libyan archaeologist Hafed Walda reported that Leptis Magna, along with nearby Rasaimergib Fort and the western Tripolis of Sabratha, had \"so far seen no visible loss\" from either fighting on the ground or bombings conducted by international forces.\nIn the midst of the Second Libyan Civil War and the disappearance of governmental and international support for the site, people living in the area organized to voluntarily protect and maintain Leptis Magna.\n\nClimate change\nSince they are located on the coast, Leptis Magna ruins are vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included them in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Leptis Magna ruins are threatened by rising water levels, unless they can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nLibya in the Roman era\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBabelon, E.C.F.

      "content": "لبدة الكبرى مدينة من مدن الشمال الأفريقي الكبرى السابقة، وتقع على الساحل المتوسطي عند مصب وادي لبده الذي يكون مرفأ طبيعيا على بعد 3 كيلومترات شرقي مدينة الخمس، التي تبعد 120 كم شرق مدينة طرابلس عاصمة ليبيا، المدينة كانت من أبرز مدن الشمال الإفريقي في عصر الإمبراطورية الرومانية.\nالمدينة صنفتها اليونسكو ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي في ليبيا وذلك منذ العام 1982.\n\nتأسيس المدينة\nكانت منطقة لبدة موطنا لجماعات بشرية في عصور ما قبل التاريخ كما تدل على ذلك بعض حجارة وجدت على ضفاف وادي الرملة، وقد ظهرت مدينة لبده كمرفأ طبيعي يلجأ إليه البحارة والتجار الكنعانيون (الفينيقيون) أثناء رحلاتهم التجارية النشطة في المتوسط.\nالفينيقيون أسسوا مدينة لبتيس ماغنا (لبدة) «واسمها الصحيح لفقي» في نهاية القرن السابع قبل الميلاد، سميت باللاتيني «لبكيس». وهذا التاريخ يقرب من تاريخ إنشاء قرطاجنة (قرطاج). وكان المؤسسون أهالي مدينة صور الفينيقية من عبدة الإله ملك عشتارت وإله الكون أرص ـ ومن هذه الكلمة الأخيرة خرجت كلمة «أرض» ـ، وهي نفس عبادات صور، ولم يكن هذان الإلهان يُعبدان من قبل في ليبيا. حتى في المدن الليبية الأخرى مثل أويا وصبراتة، لم يكن الأهالي يعبدون هذين الإلهين وهذا يدل على أن صوريي لبدة حملوا من مدينة صور ألهتهم التي لم تكن تعبد حتى في لبدة الكبرى.\nوسرعان ما نما ذلك المرفأ التجاري ليصبح أحد أحواض البحر المتوسط المهمة حيث احتوى لاحقا على منارة لبدة التي أنشأها الإمبراطور الروماني سبتيموس سيفيروس حوالي العام 200 قبل الميلاد.\nوالآن لبدة تعد من أجمل المناطق الأثرية في منطقة البحر المتوسط، كما أنها من أكبر بقايا المدن الرومانية في العالم.\n\nاصل التسمية\nكانت المدينة معروفة عند القرطاجيين باسم «لبكي»، وقد حرفها اليونانيون إلى «لبشس». وبقيت هذه الكلمة مستعملة إلى القرن الثالث ق م، ثم حرفت في اللغة اليونانية من «لبشس» إلى «لبتس» لسهولة النطق في اللغة اليونانية بكلمة «لبتس» عن «لبشس». وبما أن «لبتس» اسم لمدينة في «بيزاشينا» خافوا أن يحصل التباس بين المدينتين، فأضافوا إلى لبتس الأفريقية كلمة «مانيا»، فصارت «لبتس مانيا» ومعناها لبدة العظمى ، أو لبدة الكبرى.وان ال أبو لبدة من عهد اليونان وهم ينتمون الي الإمبراطور الروماني ومنهم من يعيش في إسرائيل وفي رومانيا وفي اليونان باسم لفادا أي بولبدة ويوجد كثير من هذة العائلة لا تعرف بعضها ولا يوجد أي صلة قرابة.\n\nتأريخ المدينة\nاستطاع الفينيقيون أن يعمروا البلاد بسرعة نظرا لخصوبة أرضها، واعتدال مناخها وصلاحيته للسكنى، ولأن لها ميناء مأمونا وصالحا للملاحة ولوقوعها على نهر عين كعام، الذي يقع شرقيها بقليل. ومما زاد في سرعة عمرانها العلاقات الطيبة التي نشأت بين السكان والفينيقيين نتيجة لحسن معاملتهم لهم. وذكر هيرودوت واقعة كبيرة عند مصب «كنبس» وادي كعام. وقد اعتراها الانحطاط في أواخر القرن السادس ق م. وفي هذا الوقت حاولت مجموعة من الإغريق بقيادة الأمير الإسبرطي دوريوس.، كون الإغريق آنذاك تركزو أساسا في برقة، أن تنشيء مستعمرة عند مصب نهر «كنبس» نهر عين كعام، منتهزة ما اعترى لبدة من التأخر وانحطاط، وقد تم لها ما أرادت.\nخاف القرطاجنيين تسرب النفوذ الإغريقي غربي سرت فلم يلبثوا أن هاجموها وخربوا مستعمرتها وطردوا الإغريق واستولوا على لبدة وما حولها، وأعادوا إليها ما فقدت من عمرانها وحضاراتها، وتوطد ملك القرطاجنيين فيما بين السرت الكبير والسرت الصغير، وأطلق على هذه المنطقة اسم «أمبوريا»، وصارت جزءا من أملاك قرطاجة، وبقيت لبدة المركز الرئيسي للمنطقة فيما بين السرتين، وتتمتع باستقلال داخلي، وبقيت تحت حكم القرطاجنيين إلى أوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد.\n\nفي أوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد أصبحت تابعة للنوميديين في الفترة ما بين الحربين القرطاجنتين الثانية سنة 218، والثالثة سنة 149 ق م. وكانت تبعيتها للنوميديين شكلية؛ لأنها كانت مقصورة على دفع الجزية. وفي سنة 111 ق م، أرسلت وفدا إلى روما طالبة صداقتها والتحالف معها للتخلص من حكم النوميديين، وفي سنة 107 ق م أمدتها روما بأربع كتائب من الجنود لمحاربة النوميديين. ويظهر أنها لم يمكنها التغلب عليهم، وبقيت تحت سيادتهم الاسمية متمتعة باستقلالها الداخلي إلى أن احتلها الروم سنة 42 ق م، وانتهى حكم النوميديين.\nوبدخول لبدة تحت الروم صارت جزءا من أفريقية الرومانية، هذا بالنسبة للسواحل، أما الدواخل فبقيت تحت سلطة حاكم من نوميديا حتى أوائل القرن الثالث م، حيث أقيم خط دفاع ضد سكان الجنوب وسموه «ليمس تريبوليتانوس». وقد تعرضت لبدة لغارات الجرمنتيين فيما بين سنتي 24 و 17 ق م، واستعانوا بقبائل أخرى من الجنوب، وذلك بسبب نزاع قام بينها وبين أويا «طرابلس الآن» بسبب اختطاف الماشية، والتعدي على بعض الأشخاص، فاستنجدت «أويا» بالجرمنتيين وبعض قبائل الجنوب، فخفوا لنجدتها، وهاجموا لبدة فتغلبوا عليها وخربوا ضواحيها، واضطر السكان إلى الاحتماء بأسوار المدينة حتى أدركهم «فاليريوفيستو» بجيشه وطرد الجرمنتيين، واعاد إلى المدينة طمأنينتها وما فقدته من أهمية كانت تتمتع بها كمحطة للقوافل، التي كانت تصل ساحل البحر المتوسط بالجنوب والسودان.\nوفي سنة 146م، ظهر في لبدة «ستيميو سيفير» وهو من إحدى الأسر الكريمة فيها، فتولى عرشها وعنى بشؤونها، ونشر فيها العلم والأمن، وأمعن في مطاردة المعتدين عليها من قبائل الجنوب حتى اقصاهم عنها، وعني برقيها الداخلي، فوفر لها سبل الحياة الصالحة بما أنشأ فيها من وسائل العمران والتقدم. وتقديرا لأعمال هذا الرجل المصلح واعترافا بإخلاصه أطلق السكان على أنفسهم اسم «الستيميين» تيمنا باسم ستيميو، واشتهروا بذلك.\n\nالإمبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس\nفي القرن الثالث الميلادي، زمن الإمبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس Septimius Severus ، من سنة 193 إلى 211م، وزمن ألكسندر سيفيروس من سنة 222 إلى سنة 235م، بلغت لبدة مبلغا عظيما في الحضارة والتقدم العمراني، وفي هذا العصر كان سكانها خليطا من الليبيين والقرطاجنيين والروم والإغريق، وبلغ عددهم ثمانين ألفا. وكانت أويا «طرابلس» في هذا العهد لم تبلغ شؤوا يمكنها من مزاحمة لبدة في النفوذ والسلطان. وفي القرن الرابع أصدر دقيانوس أمره بإعطاء أويا لقب ولاية، وكانت لبدة لها الصدارة، فأخذت أويا تزاحمها في صدراتها ومكانتها. وفيما بين سنتي 363، 366 من القرن الرابع م، اعتدى الاستريانون على ولاية لبدة فألحقوا بها أضرارا بالغة، وخصوصا بالمدينة حتى ساءت أحوالها وأخذت في الانحطاط حتى طمع فيها الوندال. وفي سنة 455 م، احتلها الوندال وقاموا بخرابها، لم يعنوا بها وتركوها للفوضى، وامتدت إليها يد النهب والسلب من القبائل البربرية المقيمة في المدينة وحولها، وأكبرها قبيلة لواتة. وفي هذه الفترة أصيبت بفيضان كبير من وادي عين كعام فحطم الجسور والأسوار، وكان له أسوأ الأثر في شل الأيدي العاملة، وتسرب اليأس إلى النفوس من القدرة على الإصلاح. فأهمل شأنها، وزحفت الرمال عليها، ودبت روح التمرد في القبائل القاطنة حولها. ولم تأت سنة 533م حتى حولت هذه القبائل الفوضوية المدينة إلى خراب، وطمع البيزنطيون في احتلالها.\nوفي سنة 533 م. احتل البيزنطيون لبدة، وكان احتلالهم لها بداية عهد جديد لعمرانها واسترداد بعض ما فقدت من حضارتها واتخذت مقرا للحاكم العسكري، وقد أصلح جوستنيان كثيرا مما امتدت إليه أيدي الفساد في العهد الذي قبله. وأدخل عليها الروم من فنون العمارة والزخرفة ما زاد في ضخامتها وجمالها.\n\nوبعد جوستنيان أخذت البلاد في الانحطاط، والسير إلى الخراب بخطى واسعة. وفي سنة 643م، وصلت إليها طلائع العرب الأولى للفتح الإسلامي، فلم تجد في لبدة من العمران إلا بقايا من قصورها العظيمة ودورها الفخمة، وإلا بقايا من السكان خليطا من أجناس متعددة يعيشون فيما بقي من خرائب دورها وقصورها.\n\nعظمة المدينة\nيتميز موقع المدينة بقربها من مناطق زراعية مهمة مثل مرتفعات الحسان الثلاث (ترهونة ونهر السنبس ووادي كعام). وللتدليل على مدى ثرائها وغناها، أن الإمبراطور الروماني يوليوس قيصر أنزل بها عقوبة لمساندتها لخصمه بومبيي الذي هزمه سنة 48 ق. م، بلغت ثلاثة ملايين رطل من زيت الزيتون سنوياً. وعلى الرغم من تلك الجزية المجحفة فقد ازدهرت مدينة لبده لتبلغ شأناً كبيراً في القرن الثاني الميلادي خاصة عندما اعتلى عرش الإمبراطورية الرومانية أحد أبنائها سيبتيموس سيفيروس (193 م- 211 م) الذي امتد حكم عائلته للإمبراطورية إلى سنة 235 م. وأثناء هذه الفترة شهدت مدينة لبده أكبر توسعاتها، حيث شيدت الساحة السويرية والإيوان السويري (البزيلكة) والشارع المعمد ونبع الحوريات وقوس النصر لسبتيموس سويروس ومنارة لبدة.\nإن الميدان القديم وأطلال المعابد المحيطة به والمجاور للميناء، هو مركز المدينة قبل اتساعها في ولاية العهد الروماني، وفي هذه الأماكن نتتبع نمو المدينة واتساعها بالوقوف على التواريخ المتتالية التي أقيمت فيها المباني العامة الفخمة كمبنى السوق البونيقية (انشئ في عام 8 ق. م) والمسرح نصف الدائري (في السنة الأولى قبل الميلاد) ومبنى الكالكيديكوم في سنة (11م- 12م) ثم توالى إنشاء المباني الأخرى خلال القرن الأول والثاني الميلاديين، التي من بينها حمامات الإمبراطور هادريان (أقيمت بين عامي 126م- 127م) وجددت في عهد الإمبراطور سبتيموس سويروس.\n\nاكتشافات جديدة\nقام فريق من الأثريين التابعين لجامعة هامبورغ الألمانية باستكشاف منطقة لبدة واعلنوا في شهر يونيو 2006 عن اكتشاف أرضية من الموزاييك طولها 30 قدم تعود إلى الفترة بين القرن الأول والثاني ميلادي. هذه القطع تبين محارب في معركة مع غزال و4 رجال يصارعون ثور بري على الأرض، ومصارع يسترخي على الأرض في حالة اعياء. هذه القطعة الجميلة تزيين حمام في فيلا رومانية. وهي معروضة حاليا بمتحف لبدة.\n\nالمراجع\nالمصادر\nتاريخ الفتح العربي في ليبية (للمؤرخ الطاهر الزاوي)\nصور للمدينة\nRichard Talbert, Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World,

      "content": "Leptis Magna ou Lepcis Magna (LPQY en punique ; Νεάπολις ou Neapolis en grec : « Nouvelle ville ») était une des villes importantes de la république de Carthage avant qu'elle ne passe, à l'issue de la troisième guerre punique, sous l'autorité de la République romaine.\n\nHistoire\nLa cité a probablement été fondée par les Phéniciens, mais les premières traces d'occupation sont datées du VIIe siècle av. J.-C.\nElle ne prend toute son importance que lorsque Carthage étend sa domination au bassin méditerranéen au IVe siècle av. J.-C. À l'issue de la troisième guerre punique, elle passe sous l'autorité de la République romaine. Cependant, aux alentours de 200 av. J.-C., elle constitue de fait une cité indépendante.\nCe statut prend fin lorsque l'empereur Tibère l'incorpore dans la province d'Afrique. Elle devient alors une des cités les plus influentes d'Afrique du Nord et un important centre de commerce. Devenue municipium en 64/65, elle est élevée au rang de colonie sous le règne de Trajan.\nLeptis connaît sa plus grande prospérité quand en 193, un de ses enfants, Lucius Septime Sévère, devient empereur. Il favorise sa ville natale, notamment en bâtissant de somptueux monuments, qui en font l'une des trois plus belles villes africaines, rivalisant avec Carthage et Alexandrie. Il s'y rend certainement avec sa famille en 203, où il est reçu avec faste.\nLors de la crise économique du IIIe siècle, pendant laquelle le commerce décline, rapidement, Leptis Magna perd elle aussi de son importance. Après les destructions causées par le violent tremblement de terre de la période 306-310, puis la dévastation causée le 21 juillet 365 par un autre tremblement de terre d'épicentre en Crète suivi d'un tsunami, la ville est en partie abandonnée. Ce déclin peut également s'expliquer par les attaques des Austuriani (un peuple de Maures de l'extérieur) en 362-365, auxquelles le comte d'Afrique Romanus, responsable de l'armée romaine en Afrique, n'a pas pu répondre. Leptis Magna connaît un faible renouveau sous le règne de Théodose Ier.\nEn 439, Leptis Magna et le reste des villes de Tripolitaine passent sous le contrôle des Vandales, quand leur roi Genséric prend Carthage aux Romains pour en faire sa capitale. Afin d'éviter que Leptis Magna ne se rebelle contre le nouvel ordre vandale, Genséric ordonne de raser ses murs. \nBélisaire reprit Leptis Magna pour le compte de Byzance dix ans plus tard, et en 534, il renversa le royaume des Vandales. Leptis devint alors une capitale provinciale de l'Empire byzantin. En 650, les Arabes envahirent à leur tour la Tripolitaine, et la ville fut abandonnée à l'exception d'une garnison byzantine.\nAu fil des siècles, le site, oublié, fut enseveli sous les sables. Et ce jusqu'au XVIIe siècle lorsqu'il fut exploité pour ses matériaux. En effet, après le bombardement de Tripoli en 1685 pour combattre la piraterie barbaresque en Méditerranée, Louis XIV exigea le paiement d'une forte rançon que le pacha de Tripoli proposa de payer avec le marbre des ruines de Leptis Magna. Deux traités furent signés entre le roi de France et le pacha de Tripoli en 1693 et 1720, stipulant que « le roi se réserve de prendre à Leptis et dans tout lieu de la régence les colonnes dont il aurait besoin ». Le consul de France nommé par provisions du 14 juillet 1685 à Tripoli, Claude Le Maire, partit à Leptis Magna pour choisir des colonnes de marbre qui pourraient servir dans la construction du château de Versailles. Au total, il en préleva près de 300, notamment du forum sévérien et de la palestre, qui furent envoyées à Toulon en 1688 et 1690 puis acheminées à Paris. Déposées sur un quai de la Seine, près du Louvre, elles ont été utilisées pour diverses constructions ou débitées en morceaux de placage. Quatre colonnes furent mises en place en 1742 dans la Chapelle de la Vierge de l’Église Saint-Sulpice de Paris, où elles se trouvent toujours. Quatre autres furent employées à la même époque dans le jubé de la Cathédrale de Rouen et, après sa destruction en 1884, réemployées pour la construction du musée des Beaux Arts de Rouen. D'autres colonnes furent utilisées pour le grand autel de l'Abbaye de Saint-Germain des Prés (gravure de Lucas, 1717) et se trouvent maintenant dans la grande galerie des peintures du Louvre, où elles ont été transférées à la Révolution après la destruction de cet autel.\nEn 1817, le consul britannique Warrington persuada le pacha Yousouf Karamanli de lui céder des éléments architecturaux de Leptis Magna (peut-être présentés comme un cadeau du pacha au roi d'Angleterre Georges IV). Il expédia ainsi à Londres une cargaison comportant notamment 22 colonnes de granite, 15 colonnes de marbre, 25 piédestaux, 10 chapiteaux et 10 morceaux de corniche qui furent d'abord entreposés dans la cour du British Museum. Ils servirent ensuite en 1826 à édifier une fabrique en forme de faux temple romain, le \"temple d'Auguste\", dans le Grand Parc de Windsor, toujours visible sur les bords du lac de Virginia Water.\nL'exploration archéologique ne débuta véritablement qu'avec l'arrivée des Italiens au début du XXe siècle.\nAujourd'hui, le site de Leptis Magna constitue l'un des plus impressionnants vestiges de l'Empire romain, classé au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1982.\n\nLe port\nLe port antique de Leptis Magna est particulièrement bien préservé, au point que certains historiens se demandent s’il a jamais servi. Il est situé à l’embouchure d’un petit cours d'eau, l'oued Lebda, et a sans doute subi un ensablement prématuré en raison de l'édification de quais et entrepôts qui eut pour conséquence d'endiguer les crues de l'oued.\nÀ l’intérieur du port, on distingue très bien les divers quais et en particulier les quais sud équipés de structures qui ont peut-être servi à accueillir des mâts de charge. La face interne du môle comporte deux niveaux : la plate-forme supérieure est en retrait par rapport au soubassement. À son extrémité nord se dressent les ruines massives d'une tour qui contient les vestiges d'un escalier en pierre. Au sud de la tour, se dresse un temple de modestes dimensions ; puis s'aligne une série d'entrepôts faisant face au débarcadère.\nCôté nord on trouve le phare et une digue en enrochements posés en vrac sur environ trois cents mètres, ainsi que des structures qui prouvent que des bateaux accostaient sur cette face nord de la côte.\nLe bassin interne du port, également connu sous le nom de « cothon », occupe un vaste espace clos dont l'aire totale avoisine les 102 000 m2. Ce plan d'eau, d'une profondeur équivalente à 410 mètres,[réf. nécessaire] se présente sous l'aspect d'un polygone de forme irrégulière.\n\nMonuments\nLes principaux monuments se regroupent en plusieurs ensembles. En bord de mer, autour de l'ancien forum datant de l'époque pré-romaine, sont distribués les bâtiments officiels des Ier et IIe siècles (basilique civile, curie), les temples (Liber Pater, Rome et Auguste, Magna Mater) et la basilique byzantine, plus tardive, aménagée dans un temple de Trajan. Plus à l'intérieur, à l'ouest de la voie nord-sud ou cardo, un deuxième ensemble regroupe le théâtre, le marché (macellum) et le chalcidicum. Plus au sud, entre le decumanus ou voie est-ouest et l'oued Lebda, se développent les grands thermes de la première moitié du IIIe siècle auxquels s'est ajoutée une grande palestre pour l'exercice physique. Au voisinage des bains, les constructions sévériennes marquent le site par leur ampleur, leur luxe de construction et leur profusion décorative. Une majestueuse avenue à portique relie la place, dominée par le nymphée, au port. Au nord de cette rue, on visite le nouveau forum et une basilique civile à deux absides. À ces travaux, il faut ajouter l'arc des Sévères au croisement des voies majeures de la cité. De l'autre côté de l'oued Lebda, à l'extrémité orientale du site, on découvre l'hippodrome et l'amphithéâtre voisin.\n\nL'arc de Septime Sévère\nÀ l'intersection du decumanus et du cardo, l'arc de triomphe fut édifié en 203 à l'occasion d'une visite de l'empereur Septime Sévère dans sa ville natale. C'est un arc tétrapyle, c'est-à-dire un arc à quatre portes. C'est le plus grand et le plus beau des arcs de Leptis ou Lepcis Magna qui compte également les arcs d'Antonin le Pieux et de Marc Aurèle sur le Decumanus ainsi que les arcs de Trajan (érigé en 109) et de Tibère (daté de 35) sur le Cardo. Cet arc de 40 m × 40 m pour une hauteur de 20 m possède trois étages. Surélevé de trois marches, il ne permettait pas le passage des chars qui devaient le contourner. L'arc est entièrement en calcaire, seule sa surface était recouverte de marbre sculpté. Les originaux en marbre sont exposés au musée de Tripoli mais certaines ornementations en marbre ont été rétablies, notamment des frises de vigne. Les faces sont décorées avec des victoires ailées de chaque côté des arcades et de grandes frises sur les quatre côtés de l'attique représentant scènes de sacrifice, scènes de bataille et une procession triomphale de Septime Sévère accompagné de ses fils Caracalla et Geta. Les dieux protecteurs de la cité Jupiter et Junon sont représentés sous les traits de l'empereur et de sa femme Julia Domna.\n\nLes thermes d'Hadrien\nCes thermes furent inaugurés en 126-127 sous le règne d'Hadrien, puis rénovés sous Commode et sous Septime Sévère. On y entre par une cour d'exercices à colonnades, oblongue, qui mène à une piscine à ciel ouvert autrefois entourée de trois côtés par un portique corinthien en marbre rose. De là, on gagne le frigidarium ou chambre froide qui constituait l'élément essentiel de l'ensemble. Vaste hall bordé de gigantesques colonnes corinthiennes, au sol dallé, aux murs recouverts de marbre et dont le plafond était sans doute peint de couleurs vives. À chacune des extrémités de cette salle, deux piscines à plongeoir. À ce hall succède le tépidarium ou chambre tiède ; un bassin unique central flanqué de deux colonnes de marbre gris ; et au-delà le caldarium ou chambre chaude. Ultérieurement, deux salles de sudation (laconica) symétriques furent construites de chaque côté de la chambre tiède. Les bains sont bordés d'installations annexes dont des vestiaires et des latrines.\n\nLe nymphée\nLe grand nymphée de Leptis Magna est situé au changement de direction de la rue à colonnes et devait masquer l'angle ainsi créé; sa forme semi-circulaire était bien adaptée à une telle fonction urbanistique. Un bassin réservoir agrémenté d'une balustrade était aménagé à l'avant du monument. Cette gigantesque fontaine ornée de revêtements précieux, de colonnes de granit rose et de cipolin vert laissait couler l'eau à partir de niches contenant des statuettes de marbre blanc.\n\nRue à colonnades\nDes thermes et de la palestre, en passant par la place du nymphée, une avenue de 20,50 m de large, parallèle à l'oued, conduit, sur 420 m, au port. Cette rue était bordée de chaque côté de portiques dont les colonnes, 125 au total, étaient en cipolin vert, montées sur piédestal et ornées de chapiteaux de marbre blanc avec pour motifs lotus et feuilles d'acanthe.\n\nForum sévérien\nDatant du IIIe siècle, il fut inauguré lors de la visite de l'empereur à sa ville natale. C'est un espace fermé ; vaste quadrilatère dominé par le temple de la famille impériale élevé sur un colossal podium. Cet ensemble monumental constitue, à l'instar de l'ancienne place publique de Leptis Magna ou encore celle de Cyrène, également située dans la province de Tripolitaine, un forum à vocation impériale. Le nouveau forum est une vaste esplanade de 100 m de long sur 60 m de large entourée d'un haut mur de pierre de taille. Le péristyle, pavé de marbre blanc, était décoré de pierres aux couleurs différentes : arcades en cipolin vert et colonnes de granit rose. Des médaillons représentant des têtes de Méduses et des Néréides rehaussent les architraves des arcades. Sur le côté sud-ouest, un escalier pyramidal conduisait au temple Septimien. De l'autre côté, le long du mur séparant le forum de la basilique, une série de boutiques et de bars.\nGisant au sein du « forum novum Severianum » de Leptis Magna, deux statues monumentales représentant le gouverneur Flavius Archontius Nilus ont été retrouvées. Lors de sa découverte, et à l'occasion de prospections ultérieures, le second ouvrage de sculpture s'est révélé être accompagné de deux inscriptions à destination honorifique et rédigées en langue latine. Retranscrite, la première de ces dédicaces, attribuée à la seconde moitié du IVe siècle (aux environs de 355-360), présente le texte suivant :\n\n« v(ir) p(er- fectissimus), cornes et praeses prov(indae) Trip(olitanae). »\n\n— Salvatore Aurigemma, 1940.\nLes termes gravés sur la deuxième inscription se présentent ainsi :\n\n« in Severiano foro ad sempiternam posteritatis me moriam constituya. »\n\n— .\n\nLa basilique sévérienne\nSorti du forum, on entre dans la basilique qui lui est contigüe. Construite sous Septime Sévère, elle est terminée sous le règne de Caracalla. Vaste quadrilatère de 92 × 42 m, la basilique présente deux absides, orientées nord-ouest et sud-est, et trois nefs séparées par deux rangées de colonnes corinthiennes en granit rose. Les colonnades des nefs latérales comportaient deux étages au-dessus desquels s'élevaient probablement des galeries en bois. La nef centrale devait être plus haute formant une sorte de claire-voie pour laisser entrer la lumière. Les niches des deux absides à l'extrémité de la nef centrale abritaient des statues. Chaque abside est dotée de deux pilastres sculptés de motifs illustrant Dionysos (abside nord) et les travaux d'Hercule (abside sud), les deux patrons de la ville.\n\nForum vetus (vieux forum)\nLe vieux forum fut construit sous le règne d'Auguste à l'emplacement du marché carthaginois. Il est ceinturé au nord par les temples de Liber Pater, de Rome et Auguste et d'Hercule construits sur des podiums; au sud par la basilique et la curie; à l'ouest par une église.\n\nLe théâtre\nBâti sur la nécropole punique, le théâtre fut construit sous Auguste et agrandi au IIe siècle apr. J.-C.. L'architecture de ce monument dédié au spectacle est en tous points élaborée d'après les douze principes du traité vitruvien (De architectura).\nLe théâtre romain, de style architectural romain et large d'environ 87,60 mètres, est pourvu d'une vaste cavea. Regardant vers la mer, l'observateur domine le théâtre, ses gradins en hémicycle, son orchestre (orchestra) semi-circulaire et les débris de la scène autrefois revêtue d'un plancher sonore. La série de colonnes d'arrière-scène correspondait au mur de scène d'une hauteur de trois étages avec ses galeries et balcons alternants et sa façade de colonnes corinthiennes. Elle comportait trois portes, entrées des artistes et derrière cet ensemble se trouvait le foyer et les réserves. Au-dessus des deux vomitoria latéraux une inscription en latin rappelle la générosité du citoyen Annobal Rufus qui fit don de ce théâtre à sa cité (1-2 apr. J.-C.). Tout à l'arrière, des colonnades en rang serré délimitent un quadrilatère entouré d'un portique qui était une sorte de foyer en plein air.\n\nLe marché\nPrès du cardo maximus, le marché ou macellum fut aménagé  en 9 av. J.-C., aux frais du même Annobal Rufus, comme l'atteste une plaque dédicatoire. Le marché était un rectangle d'environ 100 m de long. Au centre, deux kiosques circulaires, posés sur une plate-forme octogonale à degrés, sont entourés de colonnes ioniques. Des boutiques ont été adjointes à trois des portiques périphériques. Entre les deux pavillons, il subsiste des tables de mesure de capacité et de longueur. Le marché fut partiellement reconstruit et embelli en l'an 200, sous Septime Sévère.\n\nChalcidicum\nL'édifice, financé par un riche citoyen d'origine punique, Iddibal Caphada Aemilius (statue conservée au musée de Tripoli), a été consacré en 12 à la divinité d'Auguste. C'est un vaste espace à ciel ouvert avec portiques et magasins qui faisait office de centre commercial. Il doit son nom à un petit sanctuaire dédié à Vénus Chalcidica.\n\nLes thermes de la chasse\nLes thermes de la chasse sont situés en périphérie de la cité, vers l'ouest. C'est un établissement de bains datant probablement du IIe siècle qui a été conservé sous les sables dans un état remarquable. En dehors de leurs voûtes et leurs dômes, ces thermes ont peu de choses à montrer de l'extérieur. C'est à l'intérieur qu'ils sont richement décorés. La première salle, chambre froide, présente au niveau de la voûte, les restes d'une fresque représentant une scène de chasse d'où le nom de l'édifice. Chambres tiède et chaude lui font suite, bordées de conduites en tuiles creuses amenant l'air chaud depuis la chaufferie.\n\nHippodrome\nLe Cirque ou Hippodrome  été établi le long de la côte en 162, sous le règne de Marc Aurèle. S'étendant sur 450 x 100 m, il pouvait accueillir 25 000 spectateurs. Les tribunes sont partiellement conservées, mais il ne reste que peu de vestiges de l'épine centrale et des stalles de départ.\n\nAmphithéâtre\nÉdifié en 56, l'Amphithéâtre de Leptis Magna pouvait contenir quinze mille spectateurs.\n\nNouvelles découvertes en 2005\nEn juin 2005, les archéologues de l'université de Hambourg travaillant sur la côte libyenne ont découvert une mosaïque très colorée de neuf mètres de long, parmi cinq mosaïques des Ier et IIe siècles. Les mosaïques montrent avec une exceptionnelle clarté un guerrier combattant un cerf, quatre jeunes hommes luttant avec un taureau au sol, et un gladiateur fatigué fixant son opposant vaincu. Les mosaïques décoraient les murs du frigidarium des thermes d'une villa romaine sur le wadi Lebda à Leptis Magna. Les experts notent que la mosaïque au gladiateur est un des plus beaux exemples de mosaïque figurative: un \"chef-d'œuvre comparable à la mosaïque d'Alexandre de Pompeii\". Les mosaïques ont été découvertes en 2000, mais ont été tenues secrètes afin d'éviter le pillage. Elles sont actuellement exposées au musée de Leptis Magna.\n\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nAulus Septimius Serenus, né dans cette ville\nLibye antique\nHistoire de la Libye\nNumides\ncivilisation carthaginoise\nAfrique romaine\nTripolitaine\nSabratha\nOea (cité antique)\nCyrénaïque\nCyrène\n\nBibliographie\nOuvrages généraux\nAndré Laronde et Jean-Claude Golvin, L'Afrique Antique, Paris, Tallandier, 2000.\nGinette Di Vita-Évrard, « IRT 520, le proconsulat de Cn.
