Leptis or Lepcis Magna, (Arabic: لبدة الكبرى, romanized: Libda al-Kubrā) also known by other names in antiquity, was a prominent city of the Carthaginian Empire and Roman Libya at the mouth of the Wadi Lebda in the Mediterranean.
Established as a Punic settlement prior to 500 BC, the city experienced significant expansion under Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211), who was born in the city. The 3rd Augustan Legion was stationed here to defend the city against Berber incursions. After the legion's dissolution under Gordian III in 238, the city was increasingly open to raids in the later part of the 3rd century. Diocletian reinstated the city as provincial capital, and it grew again in prosperity until it fell to the Vandals in 439. It was reincorporated into the Eastern Empire in 533 but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the Muslim invasion in c. 647 and was subsequently abandoned.
After being abandoned, the city was remarkably preserved as it lay buried beneath layers of sand dunes. In the 1920s, the city was unearthed by Italian archaeologists during Italy's occupation of Libya. Its ruins are within present-day Al-Khums, Libya, 130 km (81 mi) east of Tripoli. They are among the best-preserved Roman sites in the Mediterranean.

Names
The Punic name of the settlement was written LPQ (Punic: 𐤋𐤐𐤒) or LPQY (𐤋𐤐𐤒𐤉). This has been tentatively connected to the Semitic root (present in Arabic) LFQ, meaning "to build" or "to piece together", presumably in reference to the construction of the city.
This name was hellenized as Léptis (Ancient Greek: Λέπτις), also known as Léptis Megálē (Λέπτις μεγάλη, "Greater Leptis") distinguishing it from the "Lesser Leptis" closer to Carthage in modern-day Tunisia. It was also known by the Greeks as Neápolis (Νεάπολις, "New Town"). The latinization of these names was Lepcis or Leptis Magna ("Greater Leptis"), which also appeared as the "Leptimagnese City" (Latin: Leptimagnensis Civitas). The Latin demonym was "Leptitan" (Leptitanus). It was also known as Ulpia Traiana as a Roman colony, after Emperor Trajan of the Ulpia gens. Its Italian name is Lepti Maggiore, and in Arabic it is named Labdah (لَبْدَة).

History
Punics
The Punic city was founded in the second half of the 7th century BC. Little is known about Leptis during this time, but it appears to have been powerful enough to repel Dorieus's attempt to establish a Greek colony nearby around 515 BC. Like most Punic settlements, Leptis became part of the Carthaginian Empire and fell under Rome's control with Carthage's defeat in the Punic Wars. Leptis remained highly independent for a period after about 111 BC.

Roman Republic
The Roman Republic sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. The city prospered and was even allowed to coin its own money in silver and bronze. Reflecting its blend of cultures, its coins bore Punic inscriptions but images of Hercules and Dionysus. Soon Italian merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior. The city depended primarily on the fertility of its surrounding farmland, where many olive-presses have been excavated. By 46 BC, its olive oil production was of such an extent that the city was able to provide three million pounds of oil annually to Julius Caesar as tax.

Roman Empire
Kenneth D. Matthews Jr. writes:

During the reign of Augustus, Leptis Magna was classified as a civitas libera et immunis, or a free community, over which the governor had an absolute minimum of control. As such Leptis retain its two suphetes at the head of its government, with the mhzm, similar to the Roman aediles, as minor magistrates. In addition there were such sacred officials as the ʾaddir ʾararim or praefectus sacrorum, the nēquim ēlīm, and probably a sacred college of fifteen members.

Leptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post. The city grew rapidly under Roman administration. During the reign of Nero, an amphitheater was constructed. The settlement was elevated to municipium in AD 64 or 65 and to colonia under Trajan (r. 98–117). The first known bishop of Leptis Magna was a certain priest called Victor who became pope in 189.
Leptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in AD 193, as the hometown of emperor Septimius Severus. Septimius favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In AD 205, he and the imperial family visited the city and bestowed great honors. Among the changes that Severus introduced were the creation of a magnificent new forum and the rebuilding of the docks. The natural harbor had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used.
Leptis prospered through trans-Saharan trade in various valuable goods, including ivory, wild animals for the gladiatorial arena, gold dust, carbuncle, precious woods like ebony, and ostrich feathers.
Leptis overextended itself during this period.  During the Crisis of the 3rd Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the 365 tsunami, large parts of the city had been abandoned.  Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus, who demanded bribes to protect the city during a major tribal raid.  The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian I.  Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished "for bringing false accusations".  It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I.

Vandal Kingdom
In 439, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in AD 523 when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city.

Byzantine Empire
Belisarius, general of Emperor Justinian I, recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of the Roman Empire ten years later, and in 533–4 it was re-incorporated into the empire. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Empire, but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. In 544, under the prefecture of Sergius, the city came under intensified attack of Berber tribes, and after some successes, Sergius was reduced to retreating into the city, with the  Leuathae tribal confederation camped outside the gate demanding payments. Sergius admitted eighty deputies into the city to present their demands, but when Sergius moved to leave the conference he was detained by the robe by one deputy and crowded by others. This provoked an officer of the prefect's guard to kill the deputy laying hands on the prefect, which resulted in a general massacre. The Berbers reacted with an all-out attack and Sergius was eventually forced to abandon Leptis and retreat to Carthage.

Islamic conquest
By the 6th century, the city was fully Christianized. During the decade 565–578 AD, Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the Berber tribes as far south as the Fezzan in the Libyan desert and converted the Garamantes. Numerous new churches were built in the 6th century, but the city continued to decline, and by the time of the Arab conquest around 647 the city was mostly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force and a population of less than 1,000 inhabitants. By the 10th century, the city of Al-Khums had fully absorbed it.

Excavation
Today, the site of Leptis Magna is the site of some of the most impressive ruins of the Roman period.

Part of an ancient temple was brought from Leptis Magna to the British Museum in 1816 and installed at the Fort Belvedere royal residence in England in 1826. It now lies in part of Windsor Great Park. The ruins are located between the south shore of Virginia Water and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.

When Italians conquered Italian Libya in the early 20th century, they dedicated huge efforts to the rediscovery of Leptis Magna. In the early 1930s, Italian archeological research was able to show again the buried remains of nearly all the city. A 4th to 3rd century BC necropolis was found under the Roman theatre.
In June 2005, it was revealed that archaeologists from the University of Hamburg had been working along the coast of Libya when they uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century. The mosaics show with exceptional clarity depictions of a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue and staring at his slain opponent.  The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a balneae within a Roman villa at Wadi Lebda in Leptis Magna. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of representational mosaic art ever seen—a "masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii."  The mosaics were originally discovered in the year 2000 but were kept secret in order to avoid looting. They are currently on display in the Leptis Magna Museum.
There were reports that Leptis Magna was used as a cover for tanks and military vehicles by pro-Gaddafi forces during the First Libyan Civil War in 2011. When asked if the historic site could be targeted in an airstrike, NATO refused to rule out the possibility of such an action, saying that it had not been able to confirm the rebels' report that weapons were being hidden at the location. Shortly after the war, Libyan archaeologist Hafed Walda reported that Leptis Magna, along with nearby Rasaimergib Fort and the western Tripolis of Sabratha, had "so far seen no visible loss" from either fighting on the ground or bombings conducted by international forces.
In the midst of the Second Libyan Civil War and the disappearance of governmental and international support for the site, people living in the area organized to voluntarily protect and maintain Leptis Magna.

Climate change
Since they are located on the coast, Leptis Magna ruins are vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included them in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Leptis Magna ruins are threatened by rising water levels, unless they can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.

لبدة الكبرى مدينة من مدن الشمال الأفريقي الكبرى السابقة، وتقع على الساحل المتوسطي عند مصب وادي لبده الذي يكون مرفأ طبيعيا على بعد 3 كيلومترات شرقي مدينة الخمس، التي تبعد 120 كم شرق مدينة طرابلس عاصمة ليبيا، المدينة كانت من أبرز مدن الشمال الإفريقي في عصر الإمبراطورية الرومانية.
المدينة صنفتها اليونسكو ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي في ليبيا وذلك منذ العام 1982.

تأسيس المدينة
كانت منطقة لبدة موطنا لجماعات بشرية في عصور ما قبل التاريخ كما تدل على ذلك بعض حجارة وجدت على ضفاف وادي الرملة، وقد ظهرت مدينة لبده كمرفأ طبيعي يلجأ إليه البحارة والتجار الكنعانيون (الفينيقيون) أثناء رحلاتهم التجارية النشطة في المتوسط.
الفينيقيون أسسوا مدينة لبتيس ماغنا (لبدة) «واسمها الصحيح لفقي» في نهاية القرن السابع قبل الميلاد، سميت باللاتيني «لبكيس». وهذا التاريخ يقرب من تاريخ إنشاء قرطاجنة (قرطاج). وكان المؤسسون أهالي مدينة صور الفينيقية من عبدة الإله ملك عشتارت وإله الكون أرص ـ ومن هذه الكلمة الأخيرة خرجت كلمة «أرض» ـ، وهي نفس عبادات صور، ولم يكن هذان الإلهان يُعبدان من قبل في ليبيا. حتى في المدن الليبية الأخرى مثل أويا وصبراتة، لم يكن الأهالي يعبدون هذين الإلهين وهذا يدل على أن صوريي لبدة حملوا من مدينة صور ألهتهم التي لم تكن تعبد حتى في لبدة الكبرى.
وسرعان ما نما ذلك المرفأ التجاري ليصبح أحد أحواض البحر المتوسط المهمة حيث احتوى لاحقا على منارة لبدة التي أنشأها الإمبراطور الروماني سبتيموس سيفيروس حوالي العام 200 قبل الميلاد.
والآن لبدة تعد من أجمل المناطق الأثرية في منطقة البحر المتوسط، كما أنها من أكبر بقايا المدن الرومانية في العالم.

اصل التسمية
كانت المدينة معروفة عند القرطاجيين باسم «لبكي»، وقد حرفها اليونانيون إلى «لبشس». وبقيت هذه الكلمة مستعملة إلى القرن الثالث ق م، ثم حرفت في اللغة اليونانية من «لبشس» إلى «لبتس» لسهولة النطق في اللغة اليونانية بكلمة «لبتس» عن «لبشس». وبما أن «لبتس» اسم لمدينة في «بيزاشينا» خافوا أن يحصل التباس بين المدينتين، فأضافوا إلى لبتس الأفريقية كلمة «مانيا»، فصارت «لبتس مانيا» ومعناها لبدة العظمى ، أو لبدة الكبرى.وان ال أبو لبدة من عهد اليونان وهم ينتمون الي الإمبراطور الروماني ومنهم من يعيش في إسرائيل وفي رومانيا وفي اليونان باسم لفادا أي بولبدة ويوجد كثير من هذة العائلة لا تعرف بعضها ولا يوجد أي صلة قرابة.

تأريخ المدينة
استطاع الفينيقيون أن يعمروا البلاد بسرعة نظرا لخصوبة أرضها، واعتدال مناخها وصلاحيته للسكنى، ولأن لها ميناء مأمونا وصالحا للملاحة ولوقوعها على نهر عين كعام، الذي يقع شرقيها بقليل. ومما زاد في سرعة عمرانها العلاقات الطيبة التي نشأت بين السكان والفينيقيين نتيجة لحسن معاملتهم لهم. وذكر هيرودوت واقعة كبيرة عند مصب «كنبس» وادي كعام. وقد اعتراها الانحطاط في أواخر القرن السادس ق م. وفي هذا الوقت حاولت مجموعة من الإغريق بقيادة الأمير الإسبرطي دوريوس.، كون الإغريق آنذاك تركزو أساسا في برقة، أن تنشيء مستعمرة عند مصب نهر «كنبس» نهر عين كعام، منتهزة ما اعترى لبدة من التأخر وانحطاط، وقد تم لها ما أرادت.
خاف القرطاجنيين تسرب النفوذ الإغريقي غربي سرت فلم يلبثوا أن هاجموها وخربوا مستعمرتها وطردوا الإغريق واستولوا على لبدة وما حولها، وأعادوا إليها ما فقدت من عمرانها وحضاراتها، وتوطد ملك القرطاجنيين فيما بين السرت الكبير والسرت الصغير، وأطلق على هذه المنطقة اسم «أمبوريا»، وصارت جزءا من أملاك قرطاجة، وبقيت لبدة المركز الرئيسي للمنطقة فيما بين السرتين، وتتمتع باستقلال داخلي، وبقيت تحت حكم القرطاجنيين إلى أوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد.

في أوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد أصبحت تابعة للنوميديين في الفترة ما بين الحربين القرطاجنتين الثانية سنة 218، والثالثة سنة 149 ق م. وكانت تبعيتها للنوميديين شكلية؛ لأنها كانت مقصورة على دفع الجزية. وفي سنة 111 ق م، أرسلت وفدا إلى روما طالبة صداقتها والتحالف معها للتخلص من حكم النوميديين، وفي سنة 107 ق م أمدتها روما بأربع كتائب من الجنود لمحاربة النوميديين. ويظهر أنها لم يمكنها التغلب عليهم، وبقيت تحت سيادتهم الاسمية متمتعة باستقلالها الداخلي إلى أن احتلها الروم سنة 42 ق م، وانتهى حكم النوميديين.
وبدخول لبدة تحت الروم صارت جزءا من أفريقية الرومانية، هذا بالنسبة للسواحل، أما الدواخل فبقيت تحت سلطة حاكم من نوميديا حتى أوائل القرن الثالث م، حيث أقيم خط دفاع ضد سكان الجنوب وسموه «ليمس تريبوليتانوس». وقد تعرضت لبدة لغارات الجرمنتيين فيما بين سنتي 24 و 17 ق م، واستعانوا بقبائل أخرى من الجنوب، وذلك بسبب نزاع قام بينها وبين أويا «طرابلس الآن» بسبب اختطاف الماشية، والتعدي على بعض الأشخاص، فاستنجدت «أويا» بالجرمنتيين وبعض قبائل الجنوب، فخفوا لنجدتها، وهاجموا لبدة فتغلبوا عليها وخربوا ضواحيها، واضطر السكان إلى الاحتماء بأسوار المدينة حتى أدركهم «فاليريوفيستو» بجيشه وطرد الجرمنتيين، واعاد إلى المدينة طمأنينتها وما فقدته من أهمية كانت تتمتع بها كمحطة للقوافل، التي كانت تصل ساحل البحر المتوسط بالجنوب والسودان.
وفي سنة 146م، ظهر في لبدة «ستيميو سيفير» وهو من إحدى الأسر الكريمة فيها، فتولى عرشها وعنى بشؤونها، ونشر فيها العلم والأمن، وأمعن في مطاردة المعتدين عليها من قبائل الجنوب حتى اقصاهم عنها، وعني برقيها الداخلي، فوفر لها سبل الحياة الصالحة بما أنشأ فيها من وسائل العمران والتقدم. وتقديرا لأعمال هذا الرجل المصلح واعترافا بإخلاصه أطلق السكان على أنفسهم اسم «الستيميين» تيمنا باسم ستيميو، واشتهروا بذلك.

الإمبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس
في القرن الثالث الميلادي، زمن الإمبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس Septimius Severus ، من سنة 193 إلى 211م، وزمن ألكسندر سيفيروس من سنة 222 إلى سنة 235م، بلغت لبدة مبلغا عظيما في الحضارة والتقدم العمراني، وفي هذا العصر كان سكانها خليطا من الليبيين والقرطاجنيين والروم والإغريق، وبلغ عددهم ثمانين ألفا. وكانت أويا «طرابلس» في هذا العهد لم تبلغ شؤوا يمكنها من مزاحمة لبدة في النفوذ والسلطان. وفي القرن الرابع أصدر دقيانوس أمره بإعطاء أويا لقب ولاية، وكانت لبدة لها الصدارة، فأخذت أويا تزاحمها في صدراتها ومكانتها. وفيما بين سنتي 363، 366 من القرن الرابع م، اعتدى الاستريانون على ولاية لبدة فألحقوا بها أضرارا بالغة، وخصوصا بالمدينة حتى ساءت أحوالها وأخذت في الانحطاط حتى طمع فيها الوندال. وفي سنة 455 م، احتلها الوندال وقاموا بخرابها، لم يعنوا بها وتركوها للفوضى، وامتدت إليها يد النهب والسلب من القبائل البربرية المقيمة في المدينة وحولها، وأكبرها قبيلة لواتة. وفي هذه الفترة أصيبت بفيضان كبير من وادي عين كعام فحطم الجسور والأسوار، وكان له أسوأ الأثر في شل الأيدي العاملة، وتسرب اليأس إلى النفوس من القدرة على الإصلاح. فأهمل شأنها، وزحفت الرمال عليها، ودبت روح التمرد في القبائل القاطنة حولها. ولم تأت سنة 533م حتى حولت هذه القبائل الفوضوية المدينة إلى خراب، وطمع البيزنطيون في احتلالها.
وفي سنة 533 م. احتل البيزنطيون لبدة، وكان احتلالهم لها بداية عهد جديد لعمرانها واسترداد بعض ما فقدت من حضارتها واتخذت مقرا للحاكم العسكري، وقد أصلح جوستنيان كثيرا مما امتدت إليه أيدي الفساد في العهد الذي قبله. وأدخل عليها الروم من فنون العمارة والزخرفة ما زاد في ضخامتها وجمالها.

وبعد جوستنيان أخذت البلاد في الانحطاط، والسير إلى الخراب بخطى واسعة. وفي سنة 643م، وصلت إليها طلائع العرب الأولى للفتح الإسلامي، فلم تجد في لبدة من العمران إلا بقايا من قصورها العظيمة ودورها الفخمة، وإلا بقايا من السكان خليطا من أجناس متعددة يعيشون فيما بقي من خرائب دورها وقصورها.

عظمة المدينة
يتميز موقع المدينة بقربها من مناطق زراعية مهمة مثل مرتفعات الحسان الثلاث (ترهونة ونهر السنبس ووادي كعام). وللتدليل على مدى ثرائها وغناها، أن الإمبراطور الروماني يوليوس قيصر أنزل بها عقوبة لمساندتها لخصمه بومبيي الذي هزمه سنة 48 ق. م، بلغت ثلاثة ملايين رطل من زيت الزيتون سنوياً. وعلى الرغم من تلك الجزية المجحفة فقد ازدهرت مدينة لبده لتبلغ شأناً كبيراً في القرن الثاني الميلادي خاصة عندما اعتلى عرش الإمبراطورية الرومانية أحد أبنائها سيبتيموس سيفيروس (193 م- 211 م) الذي امتد حكم عائلته للإمبراطورية إلى سنة 235 م. وأثناء هذه الفترة شهدت مدينة لبده أكبر توسعاتها، حيث شيدت الساحة السويرية والإيوان السويري (البزيلكة) والشارع المعمد ونبع الحوريات وقوس النصر لسبتيموس سويروس ومنارة لبدة.
إن الميدان القديم وأطلال المعابد المحيطة به والمجاور للميناء، هو مركز المدينة قبل اتساعها في ولاية العهد الروماني، وفي هذه الأماكن نتتبع نمو المدينة واتساعها بالوقوف على التواريخ المتتالية التي أقيمت فيها المباني العامة الفخمة كمبنى السوق البونيقية (انشئ في عام 8 ق. م) والمسرح نصف الدائري (في السنة الأولى قبل الميلاد) ومبنى الكالكيديكوم في سنة (11م- 12م) ثم توالى إنشاء المباني الأخرى خلال القرن الأول والثاني الميلاديين، التي من بينها حمامات الإمبراطور هادريان (أقيمت بين عامي 126م- 127م) وجددت في عهد الإمبراطور سبتيموس سويروس.

اكتشافات جديدة
قام فريق من الأثريين التابعين لجامعة هامبورغ الألمانية باستكشاف منطقة لبدة واعلنوا في شهر يونيو 2006 عن اكتشاف أرضية من الموزاييك طولها 30 قدم تعود إلى الفترة بين القرن الأول والثاني ميلادي. هذه القطع تبين محارب في معركة مع غزال و4 رجال يصارعون ثور بري على الأرض، ومصارع يسترخي على الأرض في حالة اعياء. هذه القطعة الجميلة تزيين حمام في فيلا رومانية. وهي معروضة حاليا بمتحف لبدة.

Leptis Magna ou Lepcis Magna (LPQY en punique ; Νεάπολις ou Neapolis en grec : « Nouvelle ville ») était une des villes importantes de la république de Carthage avant qu'elle ne passe, à l'issue de la troisième guerre punique, sous l'autorité de la République romaine.

Histoire
La cité a probablement été fondée par les Phéniciens, mais les premières traces d'occupation sont datées du VIIe siècle av. J.-C.
Elle ne prend toute son importance que lorsque Carthage étend sa domination au bassin méditerranéen au IVe siècle av. J.-C. À l'issue de la troisième guerre punique, elle passe sous l'autorité de la République romaine. Cependant, aux alentours de 200 av. J.-C., elle constitue de fait une cité indépendante.
Ce statut prend fin lorsque l'empereur Tibère l'incorpore dans la province d'Afrique. Elle devient alors une des cités les plus influentes d'Afrique du Nord et un important centre de commerce. Devenue municipium en 64/65, elle est élevée au rang de colonie sous le règne de Trajan.
Leptis connaît sa plus grande prospérité quand en 193, un de ses enfants, Lucius Septime Sévère, devient empereur. Il favorise sa ville natale, notamment en bâtissant de somptueux monuments, qui en font l'une des trois plus belles villes africaines, rivalisant avec Carthage et Alexandrie. Il s'y rend certainement avec sa famille en 203, où il est reçu avec faste.
Lors de la crise économique du IIIe siècle, pendant laquelle le commerce décline, rapidement, Leptis Magna perd elle aussi de son importance. Après les destructions causées par le violent tremblement de terre de la période 306-310, puis la dévastation causée le 21 juillet 365 par un autre tremblement de terre d'épicentre en Crète suivi d'un tsunami, la ville est en partie abandonnée. Ce déclin peut également s'expliquer par les attaques des Austuriani (un peuple de Maures de l'extérieur) en 362-365, auxquelles le comte d'Afrique Romanus, responsable de l'armée romaine en Afrique, n'a pas pu répondre. Leptis Magna connaît un faible renouveau sous le règne de Théodose Ier.
En 439, Leptis Magna et le reste des villes de Tripolitaine passent sous le contrôle des Vandales, quand leur roi Genséric prend Carthage aux Romains pour en faire sa capitale. Afin d'éviter que Leptis Magna ne se rebelle contre le nouvel ordre vandale, Genséric ordonne de raser ses murs. 
Bélisaire reprit Leptis Magna pour le compte de Byzance dix ans plus tard, et en 534, il renversa le royaume des Vandales. Leptis devint alors une capitale provinciale de l'Empire byzantin. En 650, les Arabes envahirent à leur tour la Tripolitaine, et la ville fut abandonnée à l'exception d'une garnison byzantine.
Au fil des siècles, le site, oublié, fut enseveli sous les sables. Et ce jusqu'au XVIIe siècle lorsqu'il fut exploité pour ses matériaux. En effet, après le bombardement de Tripoli en 1685 pour combattre la piraterie barbaresque en Méditerranée, Louis XIV exigea le paiement d'une forte rançon que le pacha de Tripoli proposa de payer avec le marbre des ruines de Leptis Magna. Deux traités furent signés entre le roi de France et le pacha de Tripoli en 1693 et 1720, stipulant que « le roi se réserve de prendre à Leptis et dans tout lieu de la régence les colonnes dont il aurait besoin ». Le consul de France nommé par provisions du 14 juillet 1685 à Tripoli, Claude Le Maire, partit à Leptis Magna pour choisir des colonnes de marbre qui pourraient servir dans la construction du château de Versailles. Au total, il en préleva près de 300, notamment du forum sévérien et de la palestre, qui furent envoyées à Toulon en 1688 et 1690 puis acheminées à Paris. Déposées sur un quai de la Seine, près du Louvre, elles ont été utilisées pour diverses constructions ou débitées en morceaux de placage. Quatre colonnes furent mises en place en 1742 dans la Chapelle de la Vierge de l’Église Saint-Sulpice de Paris, où elles se trouvent toujours. Quatre autres furent employées à la même époque dans le jubé de la Cathédrale de Rouen et, après sa destruction en 1884, réemployées pour la construction du musée des Beaux Arts de Rouen. D'autres colonnes furent utilisées pour le grand autel de l'Abbaye de Saint-Germain des Prés (gravure de Lucas, 1717) et se trouvent maintenant dans la grande galerie des peintures du Louvre, où elles ont été transférées à la Révolution après la destruction de cet autel.
En 1817, le consul britannique Warrington persuada le pacha Yousouf Karamanli de lui céder des éléments architecturaux de Leptis Magna (peut-être présentés comme un cadeau du pacha au roi d'Angleterre Georges IV). Il expédia ainsi à Londres une cargaison comportant notamment 22 colonnes de granite, 15 colonnes de marbre, 25 piédestaux, 10 chapiteaux et 10 morceaux de corniche qui furent d'abord entreposés dans la cour du British Museum. Ils servirent ensuite en 1826 à édifier une fabrique en forme de faux temple romain, le "temple d'Auguste", dans le Grand Parc de Windsor, toujours visible sur les bords du lac de Virginia Water.
L'exploration archéologique ne débuta véritablement qu'avec l'arrivée des Italiens au début du XXe siècle.
Aujourd'hui, le site de Leptis Magna constitue l'un des plus impressionnants vestiges de l'Empire romain, classé au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 1982.

Le port
Le port antique de Leptis Magna est particulièrement bien préservé, au point que certains historiens se demandent s’il a jamais servi. Il est situé à l’embouchure d’un petit cours d'eau, l'oued Lebda, et a sans doute subi un ensablement prématuré en raison de l'édification de quais et entrepôts qui eut pour conséquence d'endiguer les crues de l'oued.
À l’intérieur du port, on distingue très bien les divers quais et en particulier les quais sud équipés de structures qui ont peut-être servi à accueillir des mâts de charge. La face interne du môle comporte deux niveaux : la plate-forme supérieure est en retrait par rapport au soubassement. À son extrémité nord se dressent les ruines massives d'une tour qui contient les vestiges d'un escalier en pierre. Au sud de la tour, se dresse un temple de modestes dimensions ; puis s'aligne une série d'entrepôts faisant face au débarcadère.
Côté nord on trouve le phare et une digue en enrochements posés en vrac sur environ trois cents mètres, ainsi que des structures qui prouvent que des bateaux accostaient sur cette face nord de la côte.
Le bassin interne du port, également connu sous le nom de « cothon », occupe un vaste espace clos dont l'aire totale avoisine les 102 000 m2. Ce plan d'eau, d'une profondeur équivalente à 410 mètres,[réf. nécessaire] se présente sous l'aspect d'un polygone de forme irrégulière.

Monuments
Les principaux monuments se regroupent en plusieurs ensembles. En bord de mer, autour de l'ancien forum datant de l'époque pré-romaine, sont distribués les bâtiments officiels des Ier et IIe siècles (basilique civile, curie), les temples (Liber Pater, Rome et Auguste, Magna Mater) et la basilique byzantine, plus tardive, aménagée dans un temple de Trajan. Plus à l'intérieur, à l'ouest de la voie nord-sud ou cardo, un deuxième ensemble regroupe le théâtre, le marché (macellum) et le chalcidicum. Plus au sud, entre le decumanus ou voie est-ouest et l'oued Lebda, se développent les grands thermes de la première moitié du IIIe siècle auxquels s'est ajoutée une grande palestre pour l'exercice physique. Au voisinage des bains, les constructions sévériennes marquent le site par leur ampleur, leur luxe de construction et leur profusion décorative. Une majestueuse avenue à portique relie la place, dominée par le nymphée, au port. Au nord de cette rue, on visite le nouveau forum et une basilique civile à deux absides. À ces travaux, il faut ajouter l'arc des Sévères au croisement des voies majeures de la cité. De l'autre côté de l'oued Lebda, à l'extrémité orientale du site, on découvre l'hippodrome et l'amphithéâtre voisin.

L'arc de Septime Sévère
À l'intersection du decumanus et du cardo, l'arc de triomphe fut édifié en 203 à l'occasion d'une visite de l'empereur Septime Sévère dans sa ville natale. C'est un arc tétrapyle, c'est-à-dire un arc à quatre portes. C'est le plus grand et le plus beau des arcs de Leptis ou Lepcis Magna qui compte également les arcs d'Antonin le Pieux et de Marc Aurèle sur le Decumanus ainsi que les arcs de Trajan (érigé en 109) et de Tibère (daté de 35) sur le Cardo. Cet arc de 40 m × 40 m pour une hauteur de 20 m possède trois étages. Surélevé de trois marches, il ne permettait pas le passage des chars qui devaient le contourner. L'arc est entièrement en calcaire, seule sa surface était recouverte de marbre sculpté. Les originaux en marbre sont exposés au musée de Tripoli mais certaines ornementations en marbre ont été rétablies, notamment des frises de vigne. Les faces sont décorées avec des victoires ailées de chaque côté des arcades et de grandes frises sur les quatre côtés de l'attique représentant scènes de sacrifice, scènes de bataille et une procession triomphale de Septime Sévère accompagné de ses fils Caracalla et Geta. Les dieux protecteurs de la cité Jupiter et Junon sont représentés sous les traits de l'empereur et de sa femme Julia Domna.

Les thermes d'Hadrien
Ces thermes furent inaugurés en 126-127 sous le règne d'Hadrien, puis rénovés sous Commode et sous Septime Sévère. On y entre par une cour d'exercices à colonnades, oblongue, qui mène à une piscine à ciel ouvert autrefois entourée de trois côtés par un portique corinthien en marbre rose. De là, on gagne le frigidarium ou chambre froide qui constituait l'élément essentiel de l'ensemble. Vaste hall bordé de gigantesques colonnes corinthiennes, au sol dallé, aux murs recouverts de marbre et dont le plafond était sans doute peint de couleurs vives. À chacune des extrémités de cette salle, deux piscines à plongeoir. À ce hall succède le tépidarium ou chambre tiède ; un bassin unique central flanqué de deux colonnes de marbre gris ; et au-delà le caldarium ou chambre chaude. Ultérieurement, deux salles de sudation (laconica) symétriques furent construites de chaque côté de la chambre tiède. Les bains sont bordés d'installations annexes dont des vestiaires et des latrines.

Le nymphée
Le grand nymphée de Leptis Magna est situé au changement de direction de la rue à colonnes et devait masquer l'angle ainsi créé; sa forme semi-circulaire était bien adaptée à une telle fonction urbanistique. Un bassin réservoir agrémenté d'une balustrade était aménagé à l'avant du monument. Cette gigantesque fontaine ornée de revêtements précieux, de colonnes de granit rose et de cipolin vert laissait couler l'eau à partir de niches contenant des statuettes de marbre blanc.

Rue à colonnades
Des thermes et de la palestre, en passant par la place du nymphée, une avenue de 20,50 m de large, parallèle à l'oued, conduit, sur 420 m, au port. Cette rue était bordée de chaque côté de portiques dont les colonnes, 125 au total, étaient en cipolin vert, montées sur piédestal et ornées de chapiteaux de marbre blanc avec pour motifs lotus et feuilles d'acanthe.

Forum sévérien
Datant du IIIe siècle, il fut inauguré lors de la visite de l'empereur à sa ville natale. C'est un espace fermé ; vaste quadrilatère dominé par le temple de la famille impériale élevé sur un colossal podium. Cet ensemble monumental constitue, à l'instar de l'ancienne place publique de Leptis Magna ou encore celle de Cyrène, également située dans la province de Tripolitaine, un forum à vocation impériale. Le nouveau forum est une vaste esplanade de 100 m de long sur 60 m de large entourée d'un haut mur de pierre de taille. Le péristyle, pavé de marbre blanc, était décoré de pierres aux couleurs différentes : arcades en cipolin vert et colonnes de granit rose. Des médaillons représentant des têtes de Méduses et des Néréides rehaussent les architraves des arcades. Sur le côté sud-ouest, un escalier pyramidal conduisait au temple Septimien. De l'autre côté, le long du mur séparant le forum de la basilique, une série de boutiques et de bars.
Gisant au sein du « forum novum Severianum » de Leptis Magna, deux statues monumentales représentant le gouverneur Flavius Archontius Nilus ont été retrouvées. Lors de sa découverte, et à l'occasion de prospections ultérieures, le second ouvrage de sculpture s'est révélé être accompagné de deux inscriptions à destination honorifique et rédigées en langue latine. Retranscrite, la première de ces dédicaces, attribuée à la seconde moitié du IVe siècle (aux environs de 355-360), présente le texte suivant :

« v(ir) p(er- fectissimus), cornes et praeses prov(indae) Trip(olitanae). »

— Salvatore Aurigemma, 1940.
Les termes gravés sur la deuxième inscription se présentent ainsi :

« in Severiano foro ad sempiternam posteritatis me moriam constituya. »

— .

La basilique sévérienne
Sorti du forum, on entre dans la basilique qui lui est contigüe. Construite sous Septime Sévère, elle est terminée sous le règne de Caracalla. Vaste quadrilatère de 92 × 42 m, la basilique présente deux absides, orientées nord-ouest et sud-est, et trois nefs séparées par deux rangées de colonnes corinthiennes en granit rose. Les colonnades des nefs latérales comportaient deux étages au-dessus desquels s'élevaient probablement des galeries en bois. La nef centrale devait être plus haute formant une sorte de claire-voie pour laisser entrer la lumière. Les niches des deux absides à l'extrémité de la nef centrale abritaient des statues. Chaque abside est dotée de deux pilastres sculptés de motifs illustrant Dionysos (abside nord) et les travaux d'Hercule (abside sud), les deux patrons de la ville.

Forum vetus (vieux forum)
Le vieux forum fut construit sous le règne d'Auguste à l'emplacement du marché carthaginois. Il est ceinturé au nord par les temples de Liber Pater, de Rome et Auguste et d'Hercule construits sur des podiums; au sud par la basilique et la curie; à l'ouest par une église.

Le théâtre
Bâti sur la nécropole punique, le théâtre fut construit sous Auguste et agrandi au IIe siècle apr. J.-C.. L'architecture de ce monument dédié au spectacle est en tous points élaborée d'après les douze principes du traité vitruvien (De architectura).
Le théâtre romain, de style architectural romain et large d'environ 87,60 mètres, est pourvu d'une vaste cavea. Regardant vers la mer, l'observateur domine le théâtre, ses gradins en hémicycle, son orchestre (orchestra) semi-circulaire et les débris de la scène autrefois revêtue d'un plancher sonore. La série de colonnes d'arrière-scène correspondait au mur de scène d'une hauteur de trois étages avec ses galeries et balcons alternants et sa façade de colonnes corinthiennes. Elle comportait trois portes, entrées des artistes et derrière cet ensemble se trouvait le foyer et les réserves. Au-dessus des deux vomitoria latéraux une inscription en latin rappelle la générosité du citoyen Annobal Rufus qui fit don de ce théâtre à sa cité (1-2 apr. J.-C.). Tout à l'arrière, des colonnades en rang serré délimitent un quadrilatère entouré d'un portique qui était une sorte de foyer en plein air.

Le marché
Près du cardo maximus, le marché ou macellum fut aménagé  en 9 av. J.-C., aux frais du même Annobal Rufus, comme l'atteste une plaque dédicatoire. Le marché était un rectangle d'environ 100 m de long. Au centre, deux kiosques circulaires, posés sur une plate-forme octogonale à degrés, sont entourés de colonnes ioniques. Des boutiques ont été adjointes à trois des portiques périphériques. Entre les deux pavillons, il subsiste des tables de mesure de capacité et de longueur. Le marché fut partiellement reconstruit et embelli en l'an 200, sous Septime Sévère.

Chalcidicum
L'édifice, financé par un riche citoyen d'origine punique, Iddibal Caphada Aemilius (statue conservée au musée de Tripoli), a été consacré en 12 à la divinité d'Auguste. C'est un vaste espace à ciel ouvert avec portiques et magasins qui faisait office de centre commercial. Il doit son nom à un petit sanctuaire dédié à Vénus Chalcidica.

Les thermes de la chasse
Les thermes de la chasse sont situés en périphérie de la cité, vers l'ouest. C'est un établissement de bains datant probablement du IIe siècle qui a été conservé sous les sables dans un état remarquable. En dehors de leurs voûtes et leurs dômes, ces thermes ont peu de choses à montrer de l'extérieur. C'est à l'intérieur qu'ils sont richement décorés. La première salle, chambre froide, présente au niveau de la voûte, les restes d'une fresque représentant une scène de chasse d'où le nom de l'édifice. Chambres tiède et chaude lui font suite, bordées de conduites en tuiles creuses amenant l'air chaud depuis la chaufferie.

Hippodrome
Le Cirque ou Hippodrome  été établi le long de la côte en 162, sous le règne de Marc Aurèle. S'étendant sur 450 x 100 m, il pouvait accueillir 25 000 spectateurs. Les tribunes sont partiellement conservées, mais il ne reste que peu de vestiges de l'épine centrale et des stalles de départ.

Amphithéâtre
Édifié en 56, l'Amphithéâtre de Leptis Magna pouvait contenir quinze mille spectateurs.

Nouvelles découvertes en 2005
En juin 2005, les archéologues de l'université de Hambourg travaillant sur la côte libyenne ont découvert une mosaïque très colorée de neuf mètres de long, parmi cinq mosaïques des Ier et IIe siècles. Les mosaïques montrent avec une exceptionnelle clarté un guerrier combattant un cerf, quatre jeunes hommes luttant avec un taureau au sol, et un gladiateur fatigué fixant son opposant vaincu. Les mosaïques décoraient les murs du frigidarium des thermes d'une villa romaine sur le wadi Lebda à Leptis Magna. Les experts notent que la mosaïque au gladiateur est un des plus beaux exemples de mosaïque figurative: un "chef-d'œuvre comparable à la mosaïque d'Alexandre de Pompeii". Les mosaïques ont été découvertes en 2000, mais ont été tenues secrètes afin d'éviter le pillage. Elles sont actuellement exposées au musée de Leptis Magna.

## Overview
Leptis Magna, also spelled Lepcis Magna, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa in the Tripolitania region of Libya.

## Understand
Supposedly the largest Roman ruins in Libya, it is also called Lubda in Arabic. In 1994, a new excavation of part of the site was started by a team of professional archaeologists from a variety of academic and research institutes around the United Kingdom. Led by Dr. Hafed Walda of King's College London, and sponsored by the Society for Libyan Studies (established as a British Institute Abroad in 1969 and based at the Institute of Archaeology in London), this team has been conducting excavations of a building by the theatre for two seasons.

Sabratha (Arabic: صبراتة, romanized: Ṣabrāta; also Sabratah, Siburata), in the Zawiya District of Libya, was the westernmost of the ancient "three cities" of Roman Tripolis, alongside Oea and Leptis Magna. From 2001 to 2007 it was the capital of the former Sabratha wa Sorman District. It lies on the Mediterranean coast about 70 km (43 mi) west of modern Tripoli. The extant archaeological site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.

History
Sabratha's port was established, perhaps about 500 BCE, as the Phoenician trading-post of Tsabratan (Punic: ‬𐤑𐤁‬𐤓𐤕‬𐤍, ṣbrtn, or ‬𐤑𐤁‬𐤓𐤕𐤏‬𐤍, ṣbrtʿn). This seems to have been a Berber name, suggesting a preëxisting native settlement. The port served as a Phoenician outlet for the products of the African hinterland.
Greeks called it Sabrata (Ancient Greek: Σαβράτα), Sabaratha (Ancient Greek: Σαβαραθά), Sabratha (Ancient Greek: Σαβράθα)
 and also Abrotonon (Ancient Greek: Ἀβρότονον). After the demise of Phoenicia, Sabratha fell under the sphere of influence of Carthage.
Following the Punic Wars, Sabratha became part of the short-lived Numidian kingdom of Massinissa before this was annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Africa Nova in the 1st century BC. It was subsequently romanized and rebuilt in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. 
Emperor Septimius Severus was born in nearby Leptis Magna, and Sabratha reached its monumental peak during the rule of the Severan dynasty he founded, expanding nearly twice its previous size. The city was badly damaged by earthquakes during the 4th century, particularly the quake of 365. It fell under control of the Vandal kingdom in the 5th century, with large parts of the city being abandoned. It enjoyed a small revival under Byzantine rule, when multiple churches and a defensive wall (although only enclosing a small portion of the city) were erected. The town was site of a bishopric. Within a hundred years of the Muslim invasion of the Maghreb, trade had shifted to other ports and Sabratha dwindled to a village.

Archaeology
Besides its Theater that retains its three-storey architectural backdrop, Sabratha has temples dedicated to Liber Pater, Serapis and Isis. There is a Christian basilica of the time of Justinian and also remnants of some of the mosaic floors that enriched elite dwellings of Roman North Africa (for example, at the Villa Sileen, near Khoms). However, these are most clearly preserved in the colored patterns of the seaward (or Forum) baths, directly overlooking the shore, and in the black and white floors of the theater baths. There is an adjacent museum containing some treasures from Sabratha, but others can be seen in the national museum in Tripoli.In 186 AD, Emperor Commodus dedicated a temple in Sabratha honoring Hercules and his father, Marcus Aurelius. The temple featured a podium structure with porticoes and apsidal rooms at the southern ends. Excavations revealed wall fragments with marble-clad lower sections and painted upper parts. One scene in the western apse showed Commodus being carried to heaven on an eagle, about to join the gods. The eastern apse's decoration is less clear, but fragments suggest an armed Dea Roma (a personification of Rome).

Research history
Sabratha has been the place of several excavation campaigns since 1921, mainly by Italian archaeologists. It was also excavated by a British team directed by Dame Kathleen Kenyon and John Ward-Perkins between 1948 and 1951.
In 1943, during the Second World War, archaeologist Max Mallowan, husband of novelist Agatha Christie, was based at Sabratha as an assistant to the Senior Civil Affairs Officer of the Western Province of Tripolitania. His main task was to oversee the allocation of grain rations, but it was, in the words of Christie's biographer, a "glorious attachment", during which Mallowan lived in an Italian villa with a patio overlooking the sea and dined on fresh tunny fish and olives.

Erosion and weathering damage
According to an April 2016 report, due to soft soil composition and the nature of the coast of Sabratha, which is mostly made up of soft rock and sand, the Ruins of Sabratha are undergoing dangerous periods of coastal erosion. The public baths, olive press building and 'harbor' can be observed as being most damaged as the buildings have crumbled due to storms and unsettled seas. As the most common building material in Sabratah, calcarenite, is highly susceptible to physical, chemical and biological weathering (particularly marine spray), the long-term conservation of the monuments is endangered. Rising sea levels can also compromise the integrity of the site.
This erosion of the coast of Ancient Sabratha can be seen yearly with significant differences in beach layout and recent crumbled buildings. Breakwaters set in the vicinity of the harbor and olive press are inadequate and too small to efficiently protect the Ancient City of Sabratha.

Modern Sabratha
The city is home to Sabratha University. Wefaq Sabratha is the football club, playing at Sabratha Stadium.
As noted in the 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back, directed by Peter Jackson, the Sabratha Theater was considered as a possible location where the Beatles could hold their final live concert as a group (they instead performed their last concert on the rooftop of their Apple Corps headquarters).

Climate
Sabratha has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).

Sabratha est une des plus importantes villes de la Tripolitaine (Afrique romaine), située dans ce qui est aujourd’hui la Libye occidentale. À l'époque antique, elle formait avec Oea et Leptis Magna un trio de villes qui a donné son nom à la Tripolitaine. Le site archéologique a été inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO en 1982.

Localisation
L'antique Sabratha est située sur la côte méditerranéenne, à environ 1,5 km au nord-ouest de la ville moderne de Sabratha.
À 70 kilomètres à l'ouest de l'actuelle Tripoli, la cité constituait le point de départ de la route qui s'enfonçait vers le sud et le djebel tripolitain et, au-delà, vers Ghadamès et le centre de l'Afrique.

Histoire
Cette situation explique que les Carthaginois y fondèrent un établissement permanent, au IVe siècle av.J.-C. La cité punique prospéra et passa sous l'autorité de Massinissa et de ses successeurs à la tête du royaume numide, avant de se ranger du côté de Rome en 111 av. J.-C. C'est de cette période que date le réseau urbain avec un quadrillage régulier qui allait du port au marché, le futur forum. Sabratha possédait une importante nécropole où l'on peut encore admirer deux grands mausolées du IIe siècle av. J.-C..
Sous l'empire la cité  accéda au rang de municipe puis devint colonie romaine en 157.
Les marchands de Sabratha tenaient une place de choix à Ostie, le port de Rome, où le bureau de la place des Corporations s'ornait d'une mosaïque représentant un éléphant, preuve de l'importance du commerce transsaharien qui transitait par ce port, notamment pour l'envoi de bêtes sauvages destinées aux jeux du cirque.

Une mission archéologique italienne a beaucoup œuvré sur le site dans les années 1920, elle a fouillé et en partie reconstitué les vestiges visibles aujourd'hui. Max Mallowan, éminent archéologue britannique, second époux d'Agatha Christie a été présent sur le site en 1943.

Le site archéologique
Les vestiges phéniciens sont ceux d'une cité fortifiée aux rues au tracé irrégulier. Puis à partir du Ier siècle av. J.-C.  la ville romaine se développe vers le Sud selon un plan rectangulaire de type romain. Puis dans la seconde moitié du IIe siècle l'expansion se fit vers l'Est selon un plan directeur identique, là le principal monument public était le théâtre.

Monuments de l'époque libyco-punique
Mausolée libyco-punique de Bès
Le bâtiment  d'architecture libyco-punique avec des emprunts hellénistiques, en grande partie reconstruit par les archéologues libyens, a été daté du IIe siècle av. J.-C. Il possède de forts caractères similaires au mausolée libyco-punique de Dougga.

Un tophet néo-punique
Un tophet néo-punique a également été fouillé.

Monuments de l'époque romaine
Le forum
Le forum était bordé à l'origine d'une rangée de petites boutiques (tabernae).

Le temple de Liber Pater
Liber Pater est le Dionysos phénicien, l'un des dieux tutélaires de la famille de Septime Sévère. Les trois hautes colonnes appartiennent vraisemblablement à un temple construit ou reconstruit sous son règne. Elles sont en grès et non en marbre, inexistant en Afrique du Nord à l'époque, coiffées de chapiteaux corinthiens, simples tambours de grès camouflés sous des motifs en stuc.
Ces colonnes se dressent sur un podium auquel on accédait par un large escalier orienté d'Ouest en Est.
L'ensemble est érigé à l'extrémité orientale du forum.
A l'est de la basilique s'ouvrait en effet une petite zone découverte reliée à deux complexes religieux datant de l'époque des Antonins. L'un dédié à Marc Aurèle et à Lucius Verus, l'autre à un dieu inconnu. En face de l'angle nord-ouest du form, un autre temple, voué à la vénération du dieu Sérapis, était également bordé d'arcades. Plus loin, au bord de la mer, une cour entourée d'arcades sur ses quatre côtés encadrait le temple d'Isis, auquel on accédait par un simple escalier.

Le temple de Sérapis
Le temple d'Hercule
Le temple d'Isis
Fouillé à partir de 1934, le temple d'Isis a été identifié grâce à une inscription découverte en deux fois en 1937 et en 1943, puis par des représentations des divinités Isis, Sérapis et Harpocrate.

Le théâtre
Le monument le plus important du site est le théâtre romain localisé dans la partie Est du site. La date de construction non connue de façon certaine peut être située entre les IIe et le IIIe siècle apr. J.-C. Les archéologues ont calculé qu'il pouvait accueillir 5 000 spectateurs. Quand les Italiens entreprirent les fouilles en 1927, ce n'était qu'un monticule de sable et de maçonnerie. Il doit sa stature monumentale actuelle à un minutieux travail de restauration (anastylose) achevé en 1937, qui a en grande partie reconstitué la colonnade du mur de scène et l'exceptionnel décor en bas-reliefs du bord de scène.

L' amphithéâtre
À environ 1 km, à la périphérie de la ville se trouvent les vestiges d'un amphithéâtre romain construit au IIe siècle de notre ère, qui pouvait accueillir de 10 000 à 20 000 spectateurs, selon les estimations.
Repéré et décrit pour la première fois en 1912 par Henri Méhier de Mathuisieulx, il est partiellement dégagé par Renato Bartoccini en 1924.
L'édifice est orienté est-ouest et a été construit dans une dépression artificielle, qui a peut-être servi antérieurement de carrière. Les spectateurs entraient par le haut de la cavea et pouvaient par des escaliers soit descendre et gagner une galerie souterraine qui desservait les rangées de gradins des premiers et seconds niveaux, soit monter et atteindre les gradins du troisième niveau. Douze rangées de gradins sont visibles, étagés sur plus de dix mètres de hauteur, tandis que les gradins du troisième niveau ont disparu. Ils étaient probablement en bois car il ne subsiste aucun reste de voûte en maçonnerie qui auraient soutenu des gradins en pierre.
L'arène mesure environ 45 m sur 30, et est aménagée par une tranchée en croix, permettant de faire monter bêtes ou décors. Deux portes monumentales à chaque extrémités du grand axe s'ouvrent sur l'arène, ainsi que d'autres plus petites, disposées sur le pourtour et desservies par une galerie intérieure.
Une inscription trouvée à Sabratha rappelle qu'un duumvir de la cité offrit cinq jours de spectacles avec des combats de gladiateurs.

La basilique
Les fouilles ont révélé quatre niveaux d'évolution du bâtiment. Au Ier siècle, la reconstruction du forum s'accompagne de l'édification sur son côté sud d'une basilique judiciaire, conforme à la description que donne Vitruve pour ce type de construction : salle de 48,5 mètres sur 26 mètres, avec un portique intérieur et une abside à une extrémité. Sous les derniers Antonins, l'édifice est agrandi pour passer à 72 mètres de long.
Durant la première moitié du Ve siècle, la basilique judiciaire est transformée en église, consacré par le placement dans l'abside du sépulcre d'un homme portant un anneau, d'un autel et l'aménagement d'un baptistère. Au VIe siècle, les Byzantins restaurent l'église en mauvais état, en réduisant ses dimensions et en refaisant une façade à trois portes.
Une nouvelle basilique est construite sous Justinien Ier, qui fait l'admiration de Procope de Césarée. Son sol a livré une mosaïque décorée d'arbres stylisés et de motifs géométriques, visible au musée.

Les thermes
Situés près de la plage, les thermes ont gardé de belles mosaïques et sont dénommés thermes de l'Océan.

Galerie
Musées
Le site possède deux musées : un musée romain et un musée punique. Le premier contient les éléments retrouvés lors des fouilles des nécropoles de la cité, ainsi que des mosaïques et des statues, notamment un buste de Jupiter. Au sein du musée punique la pièce la plus intéressante est une statue représentant le dieu Bès.

Capitale des passeurs de migrants
Dans le chaos post-Kadhafi, la région de Sabratha est devenue la principale plate-forme de départ des migrants vers l'Europe, par l'île de Lampedusa, située à moins de 300 km. Les réseaux de trafiquants ont amassé des sommes colossales en 2016 et au début de l'année 2017, avec des milliers de candidats à l'exil embarqués chaque semaine. Mais depuis fin 2017, l’État libyen aurait repris le contrôle de Sabratha. Présence de groupes armés, trafics, absence de mesures concrètes de conservation, autant de facteurs qui, outre l'action naturelle des phénomènes climatiques, menacent l'antique cité de Sabratha, inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en péril par l'Unesco en juillet 2016.

## Overview
Sabratha is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site on the Mediterranean Coast of Libya.

## Understand
Sabratha's port was established, perhaps about 500 BCE, as the Phoenician trading-post of Tsabratan. The port served as a Phoenician outlet for the products of the African hinterland. Following the Punic Wars, Sabratha became part of the short-lived Numidian kingdom of Massinissa before this was annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Africa Nova in the 1st century BC. It was subsequently romanized and rebuilt in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. The Emperor Septimius Severus was born nearby in Leptis Magna, and Sabratha reached its monumental peak during the rule of the Severans, when it nearly doubled in size. The city was badly damaged by earthquakes during the 4th century, particularly the quake of 365. It fell under control of the Vandal kingdom in the 5th century, with large parts of the city being abandoned. It enjoyed a small revival under Byzantine rule, when multiple churches and a defensive wall (although only enclosing a small portion of the city) were erected. Within a hundred years of the Muslim invasion of the Maghreb, trade had shifted to other ports and Sabratha dwindled to a village.

## Get in
As of 2023, getting into Libya is difficult, and the Sabratha site only re-opened to tourism within the past few years. You will almost certainly need to be part of a guided tour.

Ghadames or Ghadamis  (Ghadamsi:  ⵄⴰⴷⴻⵎⴻⵙ / Ɛadēməs [ʕadeːməs], Arabic: غدامس, Italian: Gadames) is an oasis town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya.
Ghadamès, known as 'the pearl of the desert', stands in an oasis. It is one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities and an example of a traditional settlement. Its domestic architecture is characterized by a vertical division of functions: the ground floor used to store supplies; the first floor is for the family, overhanging covered alleys that create what is almost an underground network of passageways; and, at the top, open-air terraces reserved for the women.

Geography
Ghadames lies roughly 462 km (287 mi) to the southwest of Tripoli, near the borders with Algeria and Tunisia. Ghadames borders Illizi Province, Algeria and Tataouine Governorate, Tunisia.
The oasis has a population of around 10,000, mainly Berbers. The old part of the town, which is surrounded by a city wall, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Each of the seven clans that used to live in this part of the town had its own district, of which each had a public place where festivals could be held.

Climate
Ghadames has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with hot summers as average high temperature is around 41°C (105.8°F) in July, the hottest month of the year, as well as cool winters (with high diurnal variation). The town receives little precipitation throughout the year as average annual precipitation is only 73.1 mm (1.30 in).

History
Ancient eras
It has been suggested, based on archaeological evidence, that this area has been settled since the 4th millennium B.C., and is one of the oldest pre-Saharan settlements. Its situation near a water source in the middle of a desert would have made it an important spot for anyone seeking to settle in the area.
The first written records about Ghadames date from the Roman period when the settlement was known as Cydamus, from which modern Ghadames derives its name. In the 1st century BC, the Roman proconsul Lucius Cornelius Balbus invaded Cydamus during the reign of emperor Augustus. A permanent Roman garrison was established during the reign of Septimius Severus, and the emperor may have visited the settlement around AD 202. However, the Romans withdrew from the area a few decades later during the Crisis of the Third Century.
During the 6th century, a bishop lived in the oasis, after the population had been converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries. It became a stronghold of the Donatist heresy until its conquest by Muslim Arabs.
During the late 7th century, Ghadames was ruled by the Muslim Arabs. The population quickly converted to Islam and Ghadames played an important role as base for the Trans-Saharan trade until the 19th century.
The 12th century geographer Abu Hamid al-Gharnati included Ghadamis among the countries of Sudan (i.e., countries of black people), a hypothesis that Saad considers possible, as Ghadamis always had settlers representing him in Timbuktu.
Ghadamis was an important town in the trans-Saharan slave trade.

Etymology
The etymology of the name Ghadames is very closely linked with its history. It is believed that the name Ghadames is originally connected to the name of the ancient Berber tribe of Tidamensi, a tribe from Fezzan. It is also believed that the name Tidamensi was corrupted by the invading Romans to form the name Cydamus, which in turn gave way to the name Ghadames.

1900s–present
In October 1911, shortly after the Italo-Turkish War broke out, Ghadames was occupied by Italian soldiers marching from Tripoli. However, Italy's hold on the city was interrupted several times until June 1915, when a general rising throughout Libya caused the Italian garrison to retreat from Ghadames to the stronghold of Tripoli. Effective control over the city was restored in December 1918, but rebellion throughout Fezzan kept Ghadames in a state of emergency until 1923.
In 1943, Free French forces occupied Ghadames and its surrounding area in the southern part of the former Italian colony of Libya, forming the Military Territory of Fezzan-Ghadames  until Libyan independence in 1951. Ghadames was made the territory's capital during this time.
In the 1970s, the government built new houses outside of the old part of the town. However, many inhabitants return to the old part of the town during the summer, as its architecture provides better protection against the heat.
That same time, director Moustapha Akkad chose Ghadames as a filming location for interior scenes of the city of Medina in The Message, an Islamic epic drama film.
During the Libyan Civil War, National Transitional Council forces entered the town on 30 August 2011, which had been under siege by NTC forces since the beginning of the conflict. Until 2011, the city was under control by independent Tuareg troops. After being captured by the Libyan National Army, the entire Tuareg community was forced to flee in an act of ethnic cleansing.

Old Town of Ghadames
The old town, inscribed in 1986 as a UNESCO World Heritage site, was de-populated of its inhabitants throughout the 1990s, leaving the old buildings at risk of collapse due to a lack of maintenance. It has been listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger since 2016 among four other sites in Libya, because of damage caused by the Libyan Civil War affecting the country and the threat of further damage it poses.

Ghadamès (en arabe : غدامس) est une ville et une oasis du désert en Libye, à 650 km de Tripoli, à la frontière de la Tunisie et de l’Algérie. Une des premières villes fortifiées du Sahara, son architecture est conçue pour résister au climat extrême du désert. L’ancienne ville est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO depuis 1986. Elle est également connue sous le nom de « Perle du désert ».

Géographie
Ghadamès se trouve à la frontière entre l'Algérie et la Libye, à 6 km au nord de la ville algérienne de Debdeb.
L'oasis compte environ 10 000 habitants, principalement berbères. Leurs langue est le ghadamsi.

Histoire
Il existe des traces d’habitations du paléolithique et du néolithique (environ 10 000 ans)

19 av J.-C. : Une garnison romaine s'y établit. La ville est baptisée Cidamus.
70 : Valerius Flaccus.
IVe et Ve siècles : Cidamus devient un évêché sous l’empire byzantin.
667 : Invasion arabe. Territoires appartenant à l’Ifriqiya (Tunisie actuelle)
1911 : Victoire de l'Italie face à l'empire ottoman; Ghadamès est sous contrôle de la puissance coloniale italienne
1943 : Ghadamès est prise par les Français libres. Dégâts importants dans la ville pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.
1951 : La ville est intégrée au territoire de la Libye nouvellement indépendant.
1955 : Départ des dernières troupes françaises.
1986 : Les vieilles maisons sont abandonnées pour la nouvelle ville. Le site de la vieille ville est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de L'UNESCO.

Guerre civile libyenne
En juin 2011, la ville historique est pilonnée par les forces de Mouammar Kadhafi pendant la guerre civile. L'UNESCO réitère sa demande de protection du site historique.

Architecture
Toutes les maisons sont faites en toub, briques d'argile et d'écorces de palmiers, sur deux étages. Le passage d’une maison à l’autre se fait par des allées couvertes par les toits attachés les uns aux autres. La circulation de l’air, nécessaire par chaleurs extrêmes, se fait par des lucarnes percées sur les toits.
La ville est constituée de sept quartiers. On passe de l’un à l’autre en franchissant une porte en bois. Il existe plusieurs enclos à l’air libre qui étaient les lieux de rassemblement et les places des marchés.
Même si la vieille ville est désertée, les vieux Ghadamsis s’y retrouvent encore pour discuter à l’abri du soleil, quand la température atteint 50 °C à l'ombre, en savourant des dattes accompagnées d’un verre d’eau.

Fondation légendaire
Les razzias quotidiennes amenaient les cavaliers à parcourir le désert sur des centaines de kilomètres. Un jour, la jument assoiffée d’un des cavaliers refusa d’avancer et se mit à frapper le sol jusqu'à ce que l’eau jaillisse sous ses sabots. Elle fut baptisée « Source de la jument ». Un conflit éclata parmi les cavaliers et ceux qui se séparèrent du groupe revinrent à la source miraculeuse pour y édifier la ville.

Culture
Chaque année, au mois de novembre, trois jours durant, un festival se tient où se succèdent spectacles et danses faisant revivre le ksar.

## Overview
Ghadamis also known as Ghadames is an oasis town in Libya. The old part of the town is inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List.

## Understand
This is a tranquil old city, with white, covered streets that are both dark and refreshingly cool. Ghadamis was built painstakingly based on a complex knowledge of how to deal with extreme temperatures. The positioning of Ghadamis' buildings is far from casual. Every angle, every wall, every opening in the roofs over the alleyways, are parts of the same organism. Ghadamis still stands, but the people have moved into the modern settlement nearby. Yet they still take refuge in the old city when summer becomes unbearably hot. With the exodus of its local population, and their resulting loss of knowledge of engineering buildings to maintain natural air conditioning, an important science could be lost. In its earlier days, the life line of Ghadamis was trans-Sahara trade, including the slave trade.

## Get in

The Acacus Mountains or Tadrart Akakus (Arabic: تدرارت أكاكوس / ALA-LC: Tadrārt Akākūs) form a mountain range in the desert of the Ghat District in western Libya, part of the Sahara. They are situated east of the city of Ghat, Libya, and stretch north from the border with Algeria, about 100 kilometres (62 mi). The area has a particularly rich array of prehistoric rock art.

History
Etymology
Tadrart is the feminine form of "mountain" in the Berber languages (masculine: adrar).

Archaeology
The Acacus Mountains were occupied by hunter-gatherers continuously in the Holocene despite fluctuating climate in the African Humid Period. These sites have been important in understanding food processing and mobility as people adapted to climate variation. Animal domestication as part of the African Neolithic was introduced in this region by around 7000 BP, and pastoralism and foraging were the primary subsistence strategies of people in this region, not agriculture.
Sites in this region have been split into three main occupation periods: the Early Acacus, Late Acacus, and Pastoral Neolithic. The Early Acacus was a humid period from c. 9810 – 8880 BP characterized by small groups of mobile people living in valleys and along lowland lakes. The Late Acacus (c. 8870 – 7400 BP) was a dry period characterized by more sedentary people in larger groups living in valleys. These people greatly intensified food processing and storage of wild grains and used grinding stones and pottery extensively. The Pastoral Neolithic was characterized by increased mobility in a more humid environment again, and the domestication of animals. These people showed reduced usage of grinding stones.

Rock art
The area is known for its rock art and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 because of the importance of these paintings and carvings. The paintings date from 12,000 BCE to 100 CE and reflect cultural and natural changes in the area.
There are paintings and carvings of animals such as giraffes, elephants, ostriches and camels, but also of humans and horses. People are depicted in various daily life situations, for example while making music and dancing.

Milk lipids
Tadrart Acacus is also the site of the earliest appearance of processed milk lipids on ceramics, which have been radiocarbon-dated to 7,500 BP.

Vandalism and destruction since 1969
During Muammar Gaddafi’s rule from 1969 through 2011, the Department of Antiquities was badly neglected. Since 2005, the search for petroleum hidden underground has placed the rock art itself in danger. Seismic hammers are used to send shock waves underneath to locate oil deposits, and have noticeable effects on nearby rocks, including the ones that house the Tadrart Acacus rock art.
Looting of ancient artifacts reached a level of crisis. In response UNESCO called for a major awareness campaign, to heighten awareness of Libya's archaeological and cultural heritage and to alert Libyans that their heritage is "being looted by thieves and destroyed by developers."
In 2012 following the murder of Gaddafi, efforts were made to train staff through a $2.26 million UNESCO project, with the Libyan and Italian governments. The project included conservation, protection and education. Along with Tadrart Acacus, Libya has four other UNESCO World Heritage sites: Cyrene, Leptis Magna, Sabratha and Ghadames. UNESCO advised that "a centre should be established at Ghat or Uweynat to train the staff in charge of the protection and management of the property and to host a museum which is expected to play an important [role] in terms of awareness raising."
UNESCO State of Conservation (SOC) reports from 2011, 2012 and 2013 show that at least ten of the rock-art sites have been the object of deliberate and considerable destruction since at least April 2009. The ambiguity surrounding property boundaries of the World Heritage Site and therefore the property management combined with lack of local understanding of its cultural values were contributing factors in the ongoing vandalism. Conflicts in the area since 2011 led to increased vandalism.
In May 2013 UNESCO undertook a technical mission to assess the state of conservation the Tadrart Acacus site and to "build-up a strategic plan to enforce the protection and management of this unique cultural and natural context."
On 14 April 2014 two kinds of vandals were reported, those who thoughtlessly carve their own names beside the ancient rock art and those who deliberately use chemical products to remove the rock drawings. On April 20, 2014, the French special correspondent Jacques-Marie Bourget was informed by a local journalist from Ghat, Libya, Aziz Al-Hachi, that the UNESCO Rock-Art World Heritage Site of Tadrart Acacus was being destroyed with sledgehammers and scrub brushes.

Art
Funeral Ritual in the Acacus, is a painting by Shefa Salem, which inspired by cave art from the Acacus Mountains dating to 4000 BC that featured a boat containing a group of people, one of whom was upside down.

Geography
The Tadrart Acacus have a large variation of landscapes, from different-coloured dunes to arches, gorges, isolated rocks and deep wadis (ravines). Major landmarks include the arches of Afzejare and Tin Khlega. Although this area is one of the most arid in the Sahara, there is vegetation, such as the medicinal Calotropis procera, and there are a number of springs and wells in the mountains.

Tadrart Acacus (du tamazight, en arabe : تادرارت عكاكس, en français : Collines du bivouac) est un massif du sud-ouest de la Libye. Celui-ci abrite notamment un important ensemble de sites d'art rupestre représentant hommes et animaux au cours de la dernière période pluviale du Sahara, aujourd'hui disparus, et ensuite avec l'arrivée d'une période sèche, des peintures et gravures qui vont jusqu'aux premiers temps de l'ère commune et des images de chevaux, puis de dromadaires.
Ce massif est proche du Messak Settafet.

Situation
Le Tadrart Acacus est situé près de la ville de Ghat, non loin de la frontière algérienne et du Tassili n'Ajjer. Il présente une grande variété de paysages, des dunes colorées aux arches (d'Afazedjar et de Tin Khlega), gorges, falaises et sommets. La zone est depuis deux millénaires l'une des plus arides du monde, mais on y trouve quelques végétaux tels les calotropis.

Description
Des milliers de peintures et gravures rupestres ont été recensées dans et autour du massif. Elles sont datées d'environ 5500 av. J.-C. à, environ, 100 apr. J.-C. et représentent des girafes, éléphants, autruches, chameaux et chevaux. Des figures humaines sont également dessinées dans ce qui semble être des scènes de la vie quotidienne ou sociale : chasse, pâturage, danses, chants…

Invention du laitage
Le site a livré un tesson, daté au carbone 14 d'environ 4500 av. J.-C., de la plus ancienne céramique connue à ce jour en Afrique, ayant, d'après les analyses biochimiques, servi à recueillir le lait fermenté d'un bovin.

Protection
Les sites rupestres du Tadrart Acacus ont été inscrits sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco en 1985.

Destruction islamiste
En avril 2014, dans leur intention d'effacer toute trace des cultures anté-islamiques, démoniaques à leurs yeux, des djihadistes salafistes s'en sont pris aux peintures, les effaçant à l'aide de détergents, ou martelant les représentations.

The Red Castle Museum, also known as As-saraya Al-hamra Museum (Arabic: متحف السرايا الحمراء, romanized: Matḥaf al-Sarāyā al-Ḥamrāʼ), the Archaeological Museum of Tripoli or Jamahiriya Museum, is a national museum in Libya. It is located in the historic building known as the Red Castle of Tripoli (Arabic: السراي الحمراء, romanized: al-Sarāy al-Ḥamrāʼ), sometimes also referred to as Red Saraya, on the promontory above and adjacent to the old-town district with medina Ghadema.
Designed in conjunction with UNESCO, the museum covers 5,000 years from prehistory to the independence revolution (1953) era. The museum has an entrance on historic  As-Saha al-Kradrah, the Martyrs' Square. The museum has been closed since 2011 due to security concerns.

History
The museum was established in 1919, when the colonial Italians in Libya converted a section of the castle to a museum to house many of the archaeological artifacts scattered across the country since prehistoric times. The building was renovated in the early 1920s on plans by Armando Brasini, who designed its characteristic arches. The square around the castle was designed in the thirties by architect Florestano Di Fausto. When the British occupied Libya during World War II, the museum occupied the entire complex of the castle and in 1948 was renamed The Libyan Museum. The museum reopened to the public in 1988, renamed the Assaraya Alhamra Museum–Red Castle Museum, with "state-of-the-art" facilities.
In 2011 the museum was closed due to security concerns following the Libyan Civil War and subsequent unrest. The museum remained closed as of 2020. During the 2011 war, rebels entered the museum and a few items belonging to Muammar Gaddafi were damaged. The most valuable items were kept safe at another location by the museum staff. The remaining items relating to Gaddafi were placed in storage by the staff.

Collections
The museum was designed with different wings and floors for the exhibition of the distinct collections.

متحف السراي الحمراء أو مجمع متاحف السراي الحمراء في قلعة طرابلس بمدينة طرابلس العاصمة الليبية من أقدم وأكبر المتاحف الليبية وهو مقسم عمليا إلى أربعة مستويات «متاحف» تعرض تراث وتاريخ ليبيا عبر فترات زمنية مختلفة تضم حضارات القبائل الليبية والإغريق والفينيقيين والرومان والبيزنطيين والعصور العربية.

تاريخ
في العام 1919 قام الإيطاليون الذين غزوا ليبيا العام 1911 بتحويل بناء بجوار القلعة التي كانت مقرا للحكم في السابق ولأول مرة لأول متحف في مدينة طرابلس، وهو بناء كان مخزنا للذخيرة. وفي عقد العشرينيات تم إزالة البناء وكافة ملحقات القلعة، حيث تحولت بأكملها العام 1930 إلى متحف تحت اسم «المتحف الكلاسيكي» إبان فترة حكم إيتالو بالبو. وفي العام 1948 تحولت القلعة بأكملها إلى «المتحف الليبي».
يعرض المتحف مجموعة من الآثار الليبية والتي تعود إلى عصور وحقب مختلفة بينها ليبية قديمة وإغريقية ورومانية، إضافة لمجموعة من التماثيل واللوحات الفسيفسائية التي عثر عليها في مناطق مختلفة من ليبيا.
بدأ إنشاء مجمع المتاحف بالسراي الحمراء والذي تقدر مساحته بعشرة آلاف متر مربع العام 1982 داخل أسوار قلعة طرابلس، وقد تم تنفيذه تحت إشراف منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والثقافة والعلوم «اليونيسكو» لمراعاة المباني القديمة للقلعة.

متاحف المجمع
متحف التاريخ الطبيعي، ويعرض نماذج من متحجرات حيوانية ونباتية وصخور مختلفة التكوين ومجموعة من الحيوانات المحنطة وأقسام للأحياء البرية وللحشرات والطيور. إضافة لمتحف القبائل الليبية القديمة ومتحف التراث الليبي عبر العصور ومتحف ما قبل التاريخ.

تفعيل وافتتاح المتحف
في مارس 2023، انطلقت أعمال لجنة تفعيل وافتتاح المتحف من أجل صيانة وترميم وتحديث شامل للمتحف الوطني الليبي، وذلك بموجب القرار رقم 117 لسنة 2023م الصادر عن رئيس مجلس وزراء حكومة الوحدة الوطنية، والذي نص على تشكيل لجنة خاصة لتفعيل وافتتاح المتحف الوطني. تهدف هذه الأعمال إلى إعادة تأهيل المتحف وفقًا لأحدث المعايير الدولية، وتوظيف أحدث تقنيات العرض المتحفي والتحول الرقمي داخل قاعات المتحف، ومراجعة وتحسين مراحل العرض التاريخي.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germa, Jerma, Jarma, Djourma, Djerma, Djarma (Arabic: جرمة), known in ancient times as Garama, is an archaeological site in Libya. It was the capital of the Garamantian Kingdom.
The Garamantes were a Saharan people living in the Fezzan in the northeastern Sahara Desert. Garamantian power climaxed during the second and the third centuries AD, often in conflict with the Roman Empire to the north. Garama had a population of some four thousand and another six thousand living in villages within a 5 km radius.
The Garamantes often conducted raids across Rome's African frontier, the Limes Tripolitanus, and retreated to the safety of the desert. In 203, Roman Emperor Septimius Severus launched a campaign deep into the Sahara and captured Garama, but he soon abandoned it.
While some sources assert that the city was conquered by  Uqba ibn Nafi in 669 AD, other sources negate the claim that the city was conquered by Uqba ibn Nafi, suggesting instead that a peace treaty was concluded following a conflict between him and the Kanem Empire.
Archaeological work at Germa has most recently been conducted by Prof. David Mattingly's Fazzan Project, which has continued the work of Charles Daniels and Mohammed Ayoub. The Fazzan Project has published four volumes based on its work, titled The Archaeology of Fazzān. Digital versions of these books have been made freely available under a policy of open access by the Society for Libian Studies.

Germa ou Djerma (en arabe : جرمة) est une ville située au sud-ouest de la Libye.
Connue dans l'Antiquité sous le nom de Garama (en grec ancien : Γαράμη (Garame)), elle est la capitale des Garamantes, un peuple berbère saharien.

Géographie
Germa est située au cœur du Fezzan, dans le Sahara libyen. Elle se trouve à environ 700 km au sud de Tripoli, à une trentaine de kilomètres à l'est d'Awbari, à environ 150 km à l'ouest-sud-ouest de Sabha, et à une centaine de kilomètres au nord-ouest de Murzuq.

Climat
Germa possède un climat désertique chaud (classification de Köppen BWh). Au cours de l'année, il n'y a pratiquement aucune précipitation ; les précipitations annuelles moyennes sont de quelques millimètres.

Histoire
Dans l'Antiquité, la région de Germa fait partie du pays des Garamantes. Germa, qui occupe le site de l'antique Garama, capitale des Garamantes, est notamment mentionnée au Ier siècle par le naturaliste romain Pline l'Ancien à propos de l'expédition du général romain Cornelius Balbus vers l'an 20 avant J.-C. ; le géographe grec Claude Ptolémée la qualifie de « metropolis ».

Les Garamantes menaient souvent des raids sur la frontière africaine de Rome, le Limes Tripolitanus, et se retiraient dans le désert. En 197, l'empereur romain Septime Sévère, lance une campagne dans le Sahara. En 203, il s'empare de Germa, mais la présence romaine n'a duré que quelques années et ils ont abandonné la cité rapidement.
Lors de l'expansion de l'islam, Germa est prise par le général arabe Oqba Ibn Nafi en 669. Il aurait poursuivi jusqu'à Kawar (Kaouar), où il aurait détruit beaucoup.
Au XVIe siècle, elle tombe aux mains des Ottomans. La ville est cédée au royaume d'Italie en 1912 lors de la guerre italo-turque, devenant une partie de la Libye italienne jusqu'à la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale.
Dans les années 1960, les archéologues Charles Daniels et Mohammed Ayoub fouillent l'antique cité de Garama. Les recherches actuelles indiquent que Garama avait une population d'environ 4 000 habitants. Le déclin de la ville est également attribué à la consommation excessive d’eau et au manque d’eau associé à la dégradation du climat.

Ubari or Awbari (Arabic: أوباري, romanized: ‘Awbārī) is an oasis town and the capital of the Wadi al Hayaa District, in the Fezzan region of southwestern Libya. It is in the Idehan Ubari, a Libyan section of the Sahara Desert. It was the capital of the former baladiyah (district) called Awbari, in the southwest of the country.

Geography
Ubari is in the Targa valley, lying between the Messak Sattafat plateau and Idhan Ubari erg sand dunes and lakes. Native plants include wetland grasses at the natural spring-fed lakes' shorelines, and the native Saharan date palm (Phoenix dactylifera).
Ubari is located in one of the sunniest and driest areas in the world. It has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with short, very warm winters but long, extremely hot summers. Average annual rainfall is one of the lowest on the planet with only 8 mm (0.31 in) and many decades may easily pass without any rainfall at all. Ubari has permanent, unlimited sunshine and clear skies all year round and in all seasons. Clouds are extremely rare over this bone-dry land.  Average high temperatures exceed 40 °C (104 °F) from June to September.
NC186 is an oil field in southwest Ubari, operated by Repsol.

Libyan civil wars
During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the town was captured by the forces of the National Transitional Council on 22 September 2011.
On 19 November 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and a few associates were captured and detained about 50 kilometers west of Ubari as they were trying to flee to neighbouring Niger.

Oubari, aussi appelée Awbari (en tamazight : ⴰⵡⴱⴰⵔⵉ), est une ville libyenne située dans le district de Wadi al Hayaat appartenant à la région du Fezzan.

Population
Oubari est un bastion touareg où vivent également des Toubous. La population, selon une estimation de 2010, est de 24 918 habitants.

Géographie
La ville est dominée par le mont Tendé, le lieu le plus stratégique de la ville dans le contexte des affrontements entre Touaregs et Toubous de 2014 à 2015.
À proximité se trouve l'erg Oubari parsemé de lacs salés : Oum el-Maa, Gaberoun, Mahfa, Mandara. À cet emplacement se trouvait, il y a plusieurs millénaires, un lac immense le Megafezzan pouvant couvrir jusqu'à 120 000 km2.
L'oasis d'Al Fejeij est située à une cinquantaine de kilomètres à l'ouest d'Oubari.

Histoire
Seconde guerre civile libyenne
La ville a été le théâtre d'un violent conflit entre les Touaregs et les Toubous de 2014 à 2015 qui a divisé la ville en deux. Un accord de paix a été conclu au mois de novembre 2015 après 14 mois de violences, même si des heurts éclatent encore sporadiquement. Le dernier a abouti au bombardement par les Touaregs, à partir du mont Tendé, du fort ottoman de la ville occupé par les combattants toubous.
En dépit du cessez-le-feu signé à Doha (Qatar) en novembre 2015, les tensions restaient fortes entre les deux communautés en 2017.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ghat (Hindi: [ɡʱaːʈ]), a term used in the Indian subcontinent, to refer  to the series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf, such as a bathing or cremation place along the banks of a river or pond, the Ghats in Varanasi, Dhobi Ghat or the Aapravasi Ghat.

Etymology
The origin of the English 'ghat' is Sanskrit: घट्ट, ghaṭṭa and is normally translated as ghaṭ, quay, landing or bathing place, as well as steps by a river-side.  The word 'ghat' has also been derived from Dravidian etymons such as  Telugu kaṭṭa  and gaṭṭu (dam and embankment) derived from kaṭṭu  meaning "to tie".

Types
River ghats
These are bathing wharves on a river.
The numerous significant ghats along the Ganges are the Varanasi ghats (the city of Varanasi has 88 ghats) and generically the "ghats of the Ganges". Most of these were constructed under the patronage of various Maratha rulers such as Ahilyabai Holkar (Queen of the Malwa Kingdom from 1767 to 1795) in the 18th century.
In Madhya Pradesh in central India, there are further significant ghats along the Narmada River. People who live on the steps are also called ghats.
The Bhagalpur Ghats are another examples.

Shmashana, the cremation ghats
Ghats such as these are useful for both mundane purposes (such as cleaning) and religious rites (i.e. ritual bathing or ablutions); there are also specific "shmashana" or "cremation" ghats where bodies are cremated waterside, allowing ashes to be washed away by rivers. Notable examples include Nigambodh Ghat and Raj Ghat in Delhi, situated on the Yamuna River. Raj Ghat, in particular, was the cremation site for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and numerous political leaders after him, and the Manikarnika Ghat at Varanasi on the Ganges.

As place name suffix
"Ghat" and "Ghata" is also a suffix used in several place names across the subcontinent. This is an incomplete list:

Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, India
Balurghat, West Bengal, India
Batiaghata, Khulna, Bangladesh
Charghat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh
Chunarughat, Habiganj, Bangladesh
Devghat, Nepal
Gaighat, Nepal
Ghatail, Tangail, Bangladesh
Ghoraghat, Dinajpur, Bangladesh
Goalandaghat, Rajbari, Bangladesh
Golaghat, Assam, India
Gowainghat, Sylhet, Bangladesh
Haluaghat, Mymensingh, Bangladesh
Kanaighat, Sylhet, Bangladesh
Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, India
Patharghata, Barguna, Bangladesh
Saghata, Gaibandha, Bangladesh

Outside Indian subcontinent
The word is also used in some places outside the Indian subcontinent. For example, in George Town, Penang, Malaysia, the label "Ghaut" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before the reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut, in Malay Gat Lebuh Gereja, is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). Both in Penang and Singapore, there are areas named Dhoby Ghaut (dhobi meaning "launderer" or "laundry", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business).
Aapravasi Ghat or The Immigration Depot is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the first British colony to receive indentured, or contracted, labour workforce from India. From 1849 to 1923, half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot, to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire. The large-scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies, with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations. In Mauritius alone, 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry. The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kufra, Kufrah or Kofra (Arabic: الكفرة Al Kufra), also spelled Cufra in Italian, is the largest district of Libya and the second largest such district in Africa. It is slightly smaller than the country of Turkmenistan. Its capital is Al Jawf, one of the oases in Kufra basin. There is a very large oil refinery near the capital. In the late 15th century, Leo Africanus reported an oasis in the land of the Berdoa, visited by a caravan coming from Awjila. It is possible that this oasis in question was either the Al Jawf or the Taiserbo oasis, and on early modern maps, the Al Kufra region was often labelled as Berdoa based on this report.

History
The name Kufra is derived from the Arabic word kufr (كُفْر), which means "cover" or "concealment." Kufra did not fall under the dominion of either the Arabs or the Ottomans and was owned  by the Arab Bedouin tribe of the Zuwayya only in the mid-19th century, and eventually by the Italians by the 1930s. In 1931, during the campaign of Cyrenaica, General Rodolfo Graziani easily conquered Kufra, considered a strategic region, leading about 3,000 infantry and artillery personnel, supported by about twenty bombers.

Geography
Kufra's location in Libya's southeast places it on the country's border with Egypt, Sudan (unlike any other Libyan district), and Chad.  It borders the following regions of these countries, namely, New Valley Governorate, Egypt in the east, Shamaliyah State, Sudan in the southeast, North Darfur State, Sudan in the far southeast, and Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, Chad in the south. Domestically, it borders the following districts, namely, Murzuq in the west, Jufra in the northwest and Al Wahat in the north. Kufra is a part of Cyrenacian geographical subdivision, the largest region in Libya and which is mostly semi-arid in nature. The region receives average annual rainfall of 5 in (130 mm). There are no perennial rivers in the region, although it is abundant with groundwater aquifers. The terrain of all three regions of the county is mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around 423 m (1,388 ft). Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. It is desert climate in all other parts of the region. Dust storms lasting four to eight days are fairly common during the spring.
Per 2006 census, there were totally 13,313 economically active people in the district. There were 6,295 government employees, 2,178 employers, 6,454 first level workers, and 1 second level worker. There were 85 workers in state administration, 85 in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, 2,445 in agriculture and hunting, 2,029 in education, 1,558 in private enterprises, 584 in health and social work, 85 in production, 2,214 in technical work, and 354 service workers. The total enrollment in schools was 17,364 and the number of people above secondary stage and less than graduation was 875.
As per the report from World Health Organization (WHO), there was one communicable disease centre, one dental clinic, one general clinic, three out-patient clinics, five pharmacies, 16 PHC centres, one rural clinic, and no specialized clinics.

Local administration
During 2007, the northern part of Kufra District was moved to the newly created Al Wahat District. Besides the main Oasis group of the Kufra basin, four more oases belong to the region, which lie northwest of Kufra basin are Rebiana, Buzema, Wadi Zighen and Tazirbu. The oasis-valleys of Jabal Arkanu and Jebel Uweinat lie southeast of the basin. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil rich resources. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benghazi () (lit. 'Son of [the] Ghazi') is the second-most-populous city in Libya as well as the largest city in Cyrenaica, with an estimated population of 859,000 in 2023. Located on the Gulf of Sidra in the Mediterranean, Benghazi is also a major seaport.
A Greek colony named Euesperides had existed in the area from around 525 BC. In the 3rd century BC, it was relocated and refounded as the Ptolemaic city of Berenice. Berenice prospered under the Romans, and after the 3rd century AD it superseded Cyrene and Barca as the centre of Cyrenaica. The city went into decline during the Byzantine period and had already been reduced to a small town before its conquest by the Arabs. After around four centuries of peaceful Ottoman rule, in 1911, Italy captured Benghazi and the rest of Tripolitania from the Ottoman Empire. Under Italian rule, Benghazi witnessed a period of extensive development and modernization, particularly in the second half of the 1930s under the Italian Libya colony. The city changed hands several times during World War II and was heavily damaged in the process. After the war Benghazi was rebuilt and became the co-capital of the newly independent Kingdom of Libya. Following the 1969 coup d'état by Muammar Gaddafi, Benghazi lost its capital status and all government offices relocated to Tripoli.
On 15 February 2011, an uprising against the government of Muammar Gaddafi occurred in the city. The revolt spread by 17 February to Bayda, Tobruk, Ajdabya, Al Marj in the East and Zintan, Zawiya in the West, calling for the end of the Gaddafi regime. Benghazi was seized by Gaddafi opponents on 21 February, who founded the National Transitional Council (NTC). On 19 March 2011, the city was the site of the turning point of the Libyan Civil War, when the Libyan Army attempted to score a decisive victory against the NTC by attacking Benghazi, but was forced back by local resistance and intervention from the French Air Force authorized by UNSC Resolution 1973 to protect civilians, allowing the rebellion to continue. By 2014, a second civil war broke out in Libya between the House of Representatives and the Government of National Accord, with parts of Libya split between Tobruk- and Tripoli-based governance until a permanent ceasefire led by a unitary government in 2020.
Benghazi remains a centre of Libyan commerce, industry, transport and culture, and one of the three largest cities in Libya with Tripoli and Misrata. It continues to hold institutions and organizations normally associated with a capital city, including several national government buildings as well as the National Library of Libya.

History
Ancient Greek colony
Archaeological evidence shows that ancient Greeks settled on the site of Benghazi in the late seventh century BC. They called the city Euesperides (Ancient Greek: Εὐεσπερίδες) and Hesperis (Ancient Greek: Ἑσπερίς).
Euesperides was most likely founded by people from  Cyrene or  Barce, which was located on the edge of a lagoon which opened from the sea. At the time, this area may have been deep enough to receive small sailing vessels. The name was attributed to the fertility of the neighborhood, which gave rise to the mythological associations of the garden of the Hesperides. The ancient city existed on a raised piece of land opposite of what is now the Sidi-Abayd graveyard in the Northern Benghazi suburb of Sbikhat al-Salmani (al-Salmani Marsh).
The city is first mentioned by ancient sources in Herodotus' account of the revolt of Barca and the Persian expedition to Cyrenaica in c. 515 BC, where it is stated that the punitive force sent by the satrap of Egypt conquered Cyrenaica as far west as Euesperides. The oldest coins minted in the city date back to 480 BC. One side of those coins has an engraving of Delphi. The other side is an engraving of a silphium plant, once the symbol of trade from Cyrenaica because of its use as a rich seasoning and as a medicine. The coinage suggests that the city must have enjoyed some autonomy from Cyrene in the early 5th century BC, when the issues of Euesperides had their own types with the legend EU (ES), distinct from those of Cyrene.
The city was in hostile territory and was surrounded by inhospitable tribes. The Greek historian Thucydides mentions a siege of the city in 414 BC, by Libyans who were probably the Nasamones: Euesperides was saved by the unexpected arrival of the Spartan general Gylippus and his fleet, who were blown to Libya by contrary winds on their way to Sicily.
One of the Cyrenean kings whose fate is connected with the city is  Arcesilaus IV. The king used his chariot victory at the Pythian Games of 462 BC to attract new settlers to Euesperides, where Arcesilaus hoped to create a safe refuge for himself against the resentment of the people of Cyrene. This proved ineffective, since when the king fled to Euesperides during the anticipated revolution (around 440 BC), he was assassinated, thus terminating the almost 200-year rule of the Battiad dynasty.
An inscription found there and dated around the middle of the 4th century BC states that the city had a constitution similar to that of Cyrene, with a board of chief magistrates (ephors) and a council of elders (gerontes). From 324 to 322 BC, the city supported the Spartan adventurer Thibron, who attempted to establish his own kingdom in Cyrenaica, but was defeated. The city came under the control of Ptolemy I and formed part of the breakaway kingdom of Magas of Cyrene after 276 BC.
In 246 BC, during the power struggle following Magas' death, his daughter  Berenice married Ptolemy III, bringing the region back under Ptolemaic control. Euesperides was relocated to a new site underneath Benghazi's modern city centre and renamed Berenice. The move may have been due to the silting up of the lagoons, but there is no archaeological evidence for economic decline in the preceding period, and it is more likely that the refoundation was punishment for having opposed Berenice and Ptolemy's assumption of power.

Roman and Byzantine periods
Berenice later became a Roman city and greatly prospered for 600 years. The city superseded Cyrene and Barca as the chief center of Cyrenaica after the 3rd century AD and during the Persian campaigns; by 642–643, when it was conquered by the Muslim Arabs and partially destroyed, it had dwindled to an insignificant village among magnificent historic ruins.
In its more prosperous period, Berenice became a Christian bishopric. The first of its bishops whose name is recorded in extant documents is Ammon, to whom Dionysius of Alexandria wrote in about 260. Dathes was at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and Probatius at a synod held in Constantinople in 394. No longer a residential bishopric, Berenice is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Ottoman province
In the 13th century, the small settlement became an important player in the trade growing up between Genoese merchants and the tribes of the hinterland. In 16th century maps, the name of Marsa ibn Ghazi appears.
Benghazi had a strategic port location, one that was too useful to be ignored by the Ottomans.
In 1578, the Turks conquered Benghazi and it was ruled from Tripoli by the Karamanlis from 1711 to 1835; it then passed under direct Ottoman rule until 1911. Greek and Italian sponge fishermen worked its coastal waters. In 1858, and again in 1874, Benghazi was devastated by bubonic plague.

Italian colonial rule
In 1911, Benghazi was invaded and conquered by the Italians. Nearly half the local population of Cyrenaica under the leadership of Omar Mukhtar resisted the Italian occupation.
In the early 1930s, the revolt was over and the Italians—under governor Italo Balbo—started attempts to assimilate the local population with pacifying policies: a number of new villages for Cyrenaicans were created with health services and schools.
Additionally Cyrenaica was populated by more than 20,000 Italian colonists in the late 1930s, mainly around the coast of Benghazi. Benghazi population was made up of more than 35 per cent of Italians in 1939.
As a consequence, there was in Cyrenaica and mostly in Benghazi a huge economic development in the second half of the 1930s. Benghazi grew to be a modern city with a new airport, new railway station, new seaplane station, an enlarged port and many facilities. Benghazi was going to be connected in 1940 by a new railway to Tripoli, but in summer of that year war started between Italians and British and infrastructure development came to a standstill.

World War II
In World War II Benghazi changed hands several times. During Operation Compass the city was captured from the Italians by Combe Force on 6 February 1941.
Benghazi was recaptured by Axis powers, led by general Erwin Rommel of the German Africa Corps, on 4 April.
It was taken again during Operation Crusader by the British on 24 December only to change hands again on 29 January 1942 in the Rommel Afrika Corps' push to Egypt.
During the fateful Battle of El Alamein–106 kilometres (66 miles) from Alexandria, Egypt–British troops led by general Bernard Montgomery again defeated the Afrika Corps which then made a long steady retreat westward passing through Benghazi for the final time. On 20 November, Benghazi was captured by the British Eighth Army and thereafter held by the British.
In August 1943 from Benina airport of Benghazi started the US attack on the Ploiești oil refineries with 178 B-24 bombers (called Operation Tidal Wave). An Italian "Arditi" paratroopers attack that destroyed some Allied aircraft in June 1943.

Contemporary Benghazi
Heavily bombed in World War II, Benghazi was later rebuilt with the country's newly found oil wealth as a gleaming showpiece of modern Libya. It became the capital city of Emirate of Cyrenaica (1949–1951) under Idris Senussi I. In 1951, Cyrenaica was merged with Tripolitania and Fezzan to form the independent Kingdom of Libya, of which both Benghazi and Tripoli were capital cities. 
Benghazi lost its capital status when the Free Officers under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi staged a coup d'état in 1969, whereafter all government institutions were concentrated in Tripoli, Even though King Idris was forced into exile and the monarchy abolished, support for the Senussi dynasty remained strong in Cyrenaica. This was emphasized by real or perceived injustices from the government towards the people of Benghazi, including the demolition in the year 2000 of the arena of football club Alahly Benghazi S.C., following anti-government protests.
On 15 April 1986, U.S. Air Force and Navy planes bombed Benghazi and Tripoli. President Ronald Reagan justified the attacks by claiming Libya was responsible for terrorism directed at the United States, including the bombing of La Belle discothèque in West Berlin ten days before.

2011 Revolution
In February 2011, peaceful protests erupted in Benghazi that were brutally suppressed by Gaddafi's armed forces and loyalists. The violence urged the people to fight back and try to overthrow Gaddafi from power in The Libyan Revolution. At least 500 people were killed in the protests against the government.

The former Libyan flag used in the Kingdom of Libya was used by many protesters as an opposition flag. Demonstrators were also seen carrying images of King Idris I. Benghazi and the Cyrenaica have been traditional strongholds of the royal Senussi dynasty.
By 21 February, the city was reported to be largely controlled by the opposition. The widely loathed mayor, Huda Ben Amer, nicknamed "the Executioner", had fled the city for Tripoli. Residents organised to direct traffic and collect refuse. By 24 February, a committee made up of lawyers, judges and respected local people had been formed in order to provide civic administration and public services within the city.  Two local radio stations, operated by Voice of Free Libya, along with a newspaper, were also established.
From 26 February to 26 August, Benghazi was the temporary headquarters of the National Transitional Council which is led by the former justice minister, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, until Tripoli was liberated.
On 19 March, pro-Gaddafi forces almost defeated the rebellion when they began attacking the city of Benghazi in a major offensive, but were forced back the next day when NATO forces began implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.
On 1 June, explosives were detonated in a car near the Tibesti Hotel, with a rebel spokesman calling the bombing a "cowardly act". It was suspected that an officer was killed, and many people started to shout out anti-Gaddafi chants while the Tibesti was cordoned off.
On 19 May 2012, residents of Benghazi voted in historic local elections; this was the first time such elections have been held in the city since the 1960s, and turnout was high.

2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic mission
On 11 September 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi was attacked by a heavily armed group of 125–150 gunmen, whose trucks bore the logo of Ansar al-Sharia, a group of Islamist militants, also known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, working with the local government to manage security in Benghazi. U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service Information Management Officer (IMO) Sean Smith, and CIA contractors and former Navy SEALs Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty were killed during a series of raids, commencing at nightfall and continuing into the next morning.  Ten others were injured.

Second Libyan Civil War
Following the outbreak of the second Libyan Civil War in 2014, Benghazi became the subject of heavy fighting between the Libyan National Army-aligned House of Representatives government, and the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries and ISIL-aligned Wilayat Barqa, which were entrenched in various pockets in the city. During the closing months of the battle, between late-2016 and mid-2017, much of the urban center in and around the remaining Shura Council pocket in the central coastal quarters of Suq Al-Hout and al-Sabri suffered heavy bombardment and war damage. Wilayat Barqa militants reportedly fled Benghazi in early January, while the LNA's General Khalifa Haftar declared the city cleared of the Shura Council on 5 July 2017. Despite Haftar's declaration of the liberation of the city, dozens of gunmen remained fortified and besieged in Sidi Akribesh, according to sources close to military. LNA captured the last militant-held district in December 2017.
On 23 October 2020, the 5+5 Joint Libyan Military Commission representing the LNA and the GNA reached a "permanent ceasefire agreement in all areas of Libya". The agreement, effective immediately, required that all foreign fighters leave Libya within three months while a joint police force would patrol disputed areas. The first commercial flight between Tripoli and Benghazi took place that same day. On 10 March 2021, an interim unity government was formed, which was slated to remain in place until the next Libyan presidential election scheduled for 10 December. However, the election has been delayed several times since, effectively rendering the unity government in power indefinitely, causing tensions which threaten to reignite the war.

Administrative divisions
Benghazi District is one of Libya's 22 shabiyahs (people's districts).
In 2022, 18 provinces were declared by the Libyan Government of National Unity: the eastern coast, Jabal Al-Akhdar, Al-Hizam, Benghazi, Al-Wahat, Al-Kufra, Al-Khaleej, Al-Margab, Tripoli, Al-Jafara, Al-Zawiya, West Coast, Gheryan, Zintan, Nalut, Sabha, Al-Wadi, and Murzuq Basin.

Benghazi Baladiyah is divided into 32 Basic People's Congress administrative divisions, in which the responsibilities of the corresponding political units of the same name fall. The official 32 Basic People's Congresses of Benghazi are:

Population
Demographics
As with other cities in Libya, there is a reasonable amount of ethnic diversity in Benghazi. The people of eastern Libya, Benghazi included, have in the past always been of predominantly Arab descent. In recent times, however, there has been an influx of African immigrants into Benghazi. There are also many Egyptian immigrants in Benghazi. A small Greek community also exists in Benghazi. The Greek island of Crete is a short distance from Benghazi, and many families in Benghazi today bear Cretan surnames. There are even a few Italian-related families, left from the colonial times before World War II.
The overwhelming majority of Libyans in Benghazi were of Berber descent until the arrival of Bani Salim (Arabic tribe). In the 11th century, the Sa'adi tribes from the Banu Sulyam migrated to Cyrenaica; each sub-tribe from the Sa'adi historically controlled a section of Cyrenaica. Benghazi and its surrounding areas were controlled by Barghathi tribe. In modern times, Benghazi has seen a lot of Libyans from different parts of the country move into the city, especially since the Kingdom era. Many came to Benghazi from Misrata. Thus Benghazi has always been seen as a welcoming city, a city which the local Bedouins refer to as 'Benghazi rabayit al thayih' which can be translated as, 'Benghazi raises the lost', as many immigrants who arrived from the Western Maghreb or the former Al Andalus came with little money, clothes or food and were looked after very generously by the local Bedouin population as well as those arriving following the Italian war from western Libya.

Religion
The predominant religion in Benghazi is Islam. Almost all of the city's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, with the exception of some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with government regulations. The often conservative nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city; most teenagers and young adults live at home until they get married, though that is changing in recent years. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional Maliki school of religious law; however, it is much less so than in the past decades. Benghazi is said to be the most “liberal” city out of all Libya. The Senussi order from which the royal dynasty sprang has traditionally enjoyed strong support in Benghazi and the Cyrenaica.
For Muslims, there are many mosques throughout Benghazi; the oldest and best known (such as the Atiq and Osman mosques) are located in and around the medina.
There is also a small Christian community in the city. The Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Benghazi's Franciscan Church of the Immaculate Conception serves Benghazi's Latin Catholic community of roughly 4,000; there is also a decommissioned cathedral church (1929–1939; closed 1977; currently abandoned). For Egyptian Copts, there is a Coptic Orthodox church (which was formerly the grand synagogue) with two serving priests.
Jews have lived in Benghazi, as they did elsewhere in Libya, from Roman times until 1967 when most were airlifted out after a series of riots in the years after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. However, there are no Jews remaining in Libya today.

Education
The oldest university in Libya is the University of Libya, founded by royal decree in 1955. It was initially housed in the royal Al Manar Palace before receiving its own campus in 1968. It was later split and became known as University of Benghazi. There are some private universities such as Libyan International Medical University.
Education in Benghazi, as throughout Libya, is compulsory and paid entirely by taxpayers. Compulsory education continues until ninth grade. There are many public primary and secondary schools scattered throughout the city, as well as some private schools.

International schools include:

International School Benghazi
Benghazi European School
British School in Benghazi

Geography
Benghazi is one of the sub-regions of the area referred to as Cyrenaica, the others being the Jebel Akhdar and the coastal plain running east of Apollonia. Cyrenaica is surrounded by desert on three sides, hence in ancient times the most accessible civilisation was to the North, across the Mediterranean, in Crete and Greece, only 400 kilometres (250 miles) away.
Benghazi is surrounded by the "barr", arid steppe. The Jebel Akhdar, literally, "the Green Mountain", just north of Benghazi, rises to the east. Here the vegetation and climate is more Mediterranean in feel with none of the desert landscapes found further south. A large section of the western Jebel Akhdar is taken up by the fertile Marj plain. Further east is the second level of the Jebel Akhdar, between 500 metres (1,600 feet) and over 875 m (2,871 ft) above sea level, often thickly wooded and cut by ravines. Annual rainfall here, especially around Cyrene, can reach 500 millimetres (20 inches). It was this fertile site northeast of Benghazi that the Greeks chose for their settlement. The soil in Benghazi is a rich red colour and very clayey. Sirocco winds are not uncommon in the city, and as such, many of Benghazi's smaller streets and buildings can be quite dusty.
To the north, below the steep cliffs of the plateau, lies a narrow belt of Mediterranean farmland. Olives and other Mediterranean fruits and vegetables are grown here. To the south, the forest and farmland gives way to juniper bush maquis and pre-desert scrub with some winter grazing.
As a district, Benghazi borders Hizam Al Akhdar, which surrounds it on land.

Natural recreation and parks
Although Benghazi does not have a high percentage of green space per resident, there are a few public parks and green recreational areas in the city. Perhaps the most famous is the zoological garden and theme park in Al-Fuwayhat also known as Benghazi Zoo; the park is referred to locally as al-Bosco, an Italian name for wood (as in "Belleau Wood", not as in "wood plank"). The park is a combination of a zoo with trees planted during Italian rule and which contains wild cats, primates, elephants, birds and other animals, and a small theme park containing electrical rides, added later in the 1980s as part of a redevelopment of the entire site. It is one of the most popular parks in Benghazi, and is very busy on public holidays, as well as amongst school children and scouts on outings.
On Gamal Abdel Nasser Street is 23 July Park, another large green space which faces the Tibesti Hotel and borders the waterfront. The park is popular amongst teenagers, and families on Thursday nights (as Friday is a day off work throughout Libya). Another large and popular park is al-Buduzira in North Benghazi on the al-'Uruba Road in al-Kwayfiya. The park surrounds a natural lake, and is more rugged in nature than the city parks. A section of al-Buduzira is also a water park with large slides, whilst the southern part of the park has picnic areas which are popular in the summers.

Climate
Benghazi has a warm semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild to cool, slightly wet winters. In the north of the city lies the Mediterranean-climate 'Jabal Al-Akhdar' (Green Mountains), and in the south the climate is becoming desert-like. Summers in Benghazi are hot and rainless, but with high levels of humidity. Winters are mild with occasional rain. Annual rainfall is low at 270 mm (11 in) per year. The city's local water supply is supplemented by groundwater transported from the aquifers of southern Libya along the Great Manmade River.

Economy
Benghazi, as the principal city of eastern Libya, is one of Libya's major economic centres. The city has an important port which is vital to the economy, as Libya imports many foodstuffs and manufactured products. Benghazi is also an industrial and commercial centre in Libya. Major manufactured goods include processed food, textiles, tanning, processed salt and construction materials, particularly cement; a large cement factory is located in al-Hawari. Food processing is based on local fish, imported goods, and the produce of irrigated coastal lowlands and the nearby Jabal al-Akdhar Mountains, including cereal, dates, olives, wool and meat.
Finance is also important to the city's economy, with the Libyan Bank of Commerce and Development maintaining branches in Benghazi; the Bank's headquarters is a high office tower on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street in el-Berka. Other large banks include the Central Bank of Libya office in the city centre.
The oil industry drives the city's commerce. Large national companies such as the Al-Brega Oil Marketing Company and the Arabian Gulf Oil Company are important to the city's economy and employ many people. An increase in consumer prices has been coupled with an increase in the importance of the retail sector to the city's economy. In recent years, international franchises such as United Colors of Benetton, H&M and Nike have opened in Benghazi.
Tourism is still in its very early stages in Libya. The industry is however growing in importance in Benghazi. The majority of tourists that visit Eastern Libya use Benghazi as a base for which to explore the Greek ruins in Cyrene or to make desert excursions south in Kufra. The two main hotels in the city are the Tibesti Hotel and Uzu Hotel, and several other hotels have opened in recent years to cater for increased demand. Handicrafts are found in the many souks in the city, but are of little significance to the economy.
Skanska built a good connection of speedways and flyovers in the decades after the Libyan revolution in 1969; this has made the transport of goods between Benghazi and other cities easier. Benghazi's air transport uses Benina International Airport; numerous daily flights leave for Tripoli and connections are also available to other African, Asian and European cities.
In April 2012, the Libyan economy ministry announced plans for creating a free trade area in Benghazi. After the permanent ceasefire of the second civil war, there has been a rise in business in Libya. In 2021, the Libyan Business Council set up the Benghazi International Trade Fair in 2021.

Transport
Benghazi is a transport hub in Eastern Libya and is an important city on the northern coastal road that crosses the country. An efficiently designed system of roads, bridges and underpasses cover Benghazi, however traffic jams and poorly maintained streets are not uncommon. A microbus system covers many areas of the city and has its base in Al-Funduq. National and international bus services also leave from Al-Fudnuq from the central bus station. In 2010, earthworks were underway in the city for a rail network which will traverse northern Libya.
Benina International Airport serves national and international flights.
The Benghazi port is a vital terminal for the region, and allows for the import and export of national and international goods and food products.
The city's road network is generally well designed. An efficient system of highways, overpasses, ring roads and underpasses serve the city, and allow for the transport of goods and vehicles. The roads are not always well maintained, however, and often have incorrect, poorly visible or no road markings, as well as potholes in some roads and inner-city streets. In recent years, a rapid increase in car ownership has meant that traffic jams, lack of parking spaces and overcrowding are also not uncommon, especially on smaller streets. Road accidents are also on the rise because of the increase in vehicles and the subsequent lax in attention given by authorities to dangerous driving. In a rare RTA conflict health study, road traffic accidents were studied during the period of the 2011 armed conflict, in which Benghazi was a focal point of events. It was found that while the number of road traffic accidents had decreased during the period of the war, the morbidity and mortality of the injured had increased significantly.

There is no systemised public transport system in Benghazi despite the city's size and significance. A popular system of microbuses has developed in recent years; bus journeys run on fixed routes and passengers can embark and disembark anywhere on the route. Most microbuses stop at Al-Funduq or have the end of Souq Al-Jarid in Al-Funduq as their final destination. National and international coach services depart and arrive at Benghazi's coach station at Al-Funduq with regular journeys to Tripoli, as well as international services to Cairo, Amman and Damascus.
Until the 1960s there were two small railways, built by the Italians, departing from Benghazi and served with classical Littorine: Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. But recently huge railway plans were supported by Gaddafi: work started in September 2008 on a new railway network that would connect to major cities of western Libya at Sirte. Russian Railways is responsible for the three-year contract. In the future, a rail link may be built to both Tunisia and Egypt forming a North African coastal rail network.

Cityscape
The city is divided into many neighbourhoods, some of which were founded during Italian Colonial rule and many which have developed as a result of modern urban sprawl. The different neighbourhoods vary in their levels of economic prosperity, as well as their cultural, historic and social atmosphere. Generally, the city is roughly divided into the following areas: Central Benghazi (colloquially referred to as al-Blaad by locals) – includes the medina, and the old quarter, Central Districts which circle the downtown – Al-Sabri, Sidi Abayd, Sidi Hsayn, Al-Berka, Al-Salmani, Al-Hadaa'ik, Al-Fuwayhat and Al-Keesh, Central Suburbs – Al-Laythi, Bu Atni, Al-Quwarsha, Al-Hawari, Coastal Districts – Al-Kwayfiya (North), Garyounis, Bu-Fakhra and Jarrutha (South), and the Distant Suburbs – Gimeenis, Benina and Sidi Khalifa.
Central Benghazi is where the majority of Benghazi's historical monuments are located, and has the city's most popular tourist attractions. Virtually all of Benghazi's theatres, libraries, best clothing stores, markets and old mosques can be found there. The Italian quarter is also located in the centre. The central districts are mostly residential and commercial areas such as Sidi Hsayn. The central suburbs are almost entirely residential and more like little towns in their own right; Al-Quwarsha is a good example of this. The coastal districts (especially the southern districts) are where Benghazi's beaches can be found. Some sections have become more popular as residential areas in recent years (such as Qanfuda). These areas are still primarily recreational however, and many beach condominium resorts (known locally as chalets) have been built in previous years such as those at al-Nakheel beach, and the Nayrouz condominiums.

Culture
Benghazi is one of the cultural centres of Libya and is a base for tourists, visitors and academics in the region. Throughout its history, Benghazi has developed with a certain level of independence from the more Maghreb oriented capital Tripoli. This has influenced the city, and as such, the cultural atmosphere in Benghazi is more Arab in nature than that in Tripoli. An influx of immigrants including Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Sudanese and Syrian immigrants have also influenced the city's culture to a certain extent in recent years.
The city centre contains a few local theatres, as well as the Dar al-Kutub National Library in Al-Funduq, where the works of popular local novelists like Sadeq Naihoum and Khalifa al-Fakhri can be found. Different architectural styles attest to the different empires that have controlled the city throughout history. Sport is also important in the city; two of Libya's most successful football clubs are based in Benghazi.

Architecture
There is a variety of architectural styles in Benghazi, which reflect the number of times the city has changed hands throughout its history. Arab, Ottoman and Italian rule have influenced the different streetscapes, buildings and quarters in Benghazi.
Ancient architectural remains of the Greek and later Roman settlement of Berenice can be found by the Italian lighthouse. There is a trace of the 3rd century BC wall built by the Greeks, four Roman peristyle houses, six wine vats. A Byzantine church also exists on the site, with a mosaic still intact. These ruins formed the northern part of the ancient city, which extended south and east but now lies buried beneath the modern city.
The next oldest section of the city is the Medina quarter, which began to grow sometime under Medieval Arab rule, and is still intact today. This quarter stretches out from the Northern shores of the harbour, and covers an area roughly bounded by Ahmed Rafiq al-Mahdawi Street to the North-west, al-Jezayir Street to the South-east and 23 July Street to the South-west. The heart of the medina is Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square); to the northeast of this is the covered Souq al-Jareed.

The largest Ottoman architectural monument in Benghazi is the late 19th-century Ottoman palace in El-Berka; built during the rule of Rashid Pasha II. The front elevation was completed in 1895, whilst the side sections were added later during Italian rule. The white and green structure houses 360 rooms; and is on a tract of land where Gamal Abdel Nasser Street meets al-Saqzali Street; south of the 28 March football stadium.
The house of Omar Pasha Mansour El Kikhia, an Ottoman Pasha from a prominent Benghazi family, represents a good example of Ottoman residential architecture with several balconies, stone archways, and an open courtyard containing a fountain. The home was recently restored, remodeled and converted into the Bait-al Medina al-Thaqafi museum.

Benghazi came under Italian rule in the early part of the 20th century. Some examples of Italianate, as well as modernist colonial architecture from this period remain today. Under the governorships of Generals Ernesto Mombelli and Attilio Teruzzi in the 1920s, the buildings commissioned in Benghazi had an eclectic architectural language that embodied a Western conception of Eastern architecture. An example of this is the Municipal palace built in 1924, which stands in Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square). The building combines Moorish arches with Italianate motifs on the façade. Italians even did the first architectural plan of Benghazi. in the 1930s, with a new railway station and promenade.
The largest colonial building from this Italian period is the Benghazi Cathedral in Maydan El Catedraeya (Cathedral Square), which was built in the 1920s and has two large distinct domes.
Benghazi was heavily bombed during World War II, and so the majority of buildings in the city are examples of modern or contemporary architecture. The central business district was built mostly in the 1960s and 1970s with Libya's newfound oil wealth. The highest building in Benghazi is the Tibesti Hotel on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street built in 1989. Another prominent example of modern architecture in Benghazi is the Da'wah al-Islamiyah Building, which has a series of distinctive cubes piled in the shape of a pyramid.
Important colonial buildings designed during Italian rule include the Berenice Cinema (currently under renovation) which was designed Marcello Piacentini and Luigi Piccinato in 1928.

Sports
Benghazi is the second largest city in Libya, and as such, has some of the best sports facilities in the country. The city has various sporting centres of different standards, such as football stadia, beach clubs (where many water sports are played), as well as several other public and private facilities. Benghazi has hosted many national sports events throughout the years, as well as more significant international competitions such as the African Cup of Nations.
Football is the most-popular sport in Benghazi, and two of Libya's most-successful football clubs, Al-Ahly Benghazi and Al-Nasr Benghazi, are based in the city. The two teams have won the Libyan Premier League five times; Al Ahly four and Al Nasr only one. The most-important football event that took place in Benghazi was the 1982 African Cup of Nations. The city hosted six group games and a semifinal in the March 28 Stadium, Libya's second-largest stadium.
The largest sporting centre in Benghazi is the Medina al-Riyadhia (Sports City). The complex is situated just south of the city centre, and houses the 28 March Stadium, and the Slayman al Tharrat basketball stadium – several matches of the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship were hosted at the arena. The complex also has a sports hall for indoor sports, a tennis stadium and several small tennis courts. The facility was built in the 1950s and is therefore quite outdated; the stadia have nonetheless undergone maintenance work in recent years. Sports City was recently closed down for a complete redevelopment of the site. As of 2009, the 28 March Stadium was undergoing demolition work, and a new 45,000 all seater stadium was to be constructed in its place. A second smaller stadium was to be built on-site, and the entire site was to undergo redevelopment before its reopening in 2011, and its use in the 2013 African Nations Cup.
The Eastern suburb of Sidi Khalifa accommodates an equestrian sports facility. The 'Martyrs of Benghazi's Riding Club' boasts a number of female members who, at least until 2016, engaged in sportive competition.
Benghazi is a coastal city, and its beaches are an important location for sporting activities. The coast at Jeliana is home to the Milaha Beach Club amongst others. Wind surfing and swimming are two of the most popular water sports. There are also several contact sport clubs in the city –judo and taekwondo are popular men's sports in Benghazi. In recent times, rugby sevens has seen great success with three clubs in the vicinity.  Gyms have also become more popular in the city in recent years, because of a greater concern for healthy living amongst Libyans.

Food
Food and drink is very important to the culture of the people of Benghazi, as it is in the rest of Libya. Many of the dishes and ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation. The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.
Benghazi is home to many distinctive dishes that can be prepared at home. Bazin (bread) is one of the most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce. The dough can be ripped into bite-sized pieces and dipped into the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.

Notable people
Notable people from Benghazi include:

Taha El Sherif Ben Amer, Minister of Transport of Libya
Al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy, Libyan college student who was executed during Gaddafi's regime
Amal Bayou, microbiologist and politician
Khadījah Jahamī, broadcaster
Shefa Salem, artist and painter
Ahmed Fakroun, Libyan musician and producer

Benghazi (en arabe :  بنغازي Binġāzī, en italien Bengasi) est une ville de la Cyrénaïque, en Libye, chef lieu du district homonyme. Sa population est de 631 555 habitants pour une agglomération de 1 180 000 habitants, ce qui en fait la deuxième ville de Libye après la capitale Tripoli.
Dès le début de la révolte libyenne de 2011, Benghazi devient le siège du Conseil national de transition, autorité politique de transition instituée par les insurgés libyens.

Histoire
La ville est une ancienne colonie grecque fondée vers 525 av. J.-C., selon la légende par le frère du roi de Cyrène, qui est mentionnée par Hérodote à propos de l'expédition perse en Cyrénaïque en 515 av. J.-C. La ville ne prend le nom de Bérénice qu'au IIIe siècle av. J.-C., quand elle est reconstruite par la reine Bérénice, épouse de Ptolémée III. Entre-temps, c'est une colonie carthaginoise, Hesperida ou Hespérides, nommée ainsi en référence au jardin des Hespérides, car c'est une région agricole fertile. Après avoir été donc une cité soumise à la dynastie égyptienne à l'époque hellénistique, elle entre dans la sphère culturelle byzantine. C'est une ville florissante qui dépasse Cyrène et Barca, jusqu'au VIe siècle. Cependant, elle subit une invasion perse qui la détruit en partie, puis elle est envahie par les Arabes en 642-643, et devient Beni Ghazi. Ce n'est plus qu'un petit village sur des ruines. L'empire ottoman annexe la ville en 1578.

L'Italie envahit la ville en 1911 et l'annexe à la Libye italienne. Une partie de la population de Cyrénaïque se révolte sous le commandement d'Omar Al Mokhtar. 125 000 Libyens dans tout le pays sont emprisonnés dans des camps sous le régime mussolinien dont un tiers meurt d'épidémies. La révolte est matée en 1930 et Italo Balbo entreprend une politique d'assimilation. De nouveaux villages sont créés en Cyrénaïque avec des écoles, des systèmes sociaux et des hôpitaux. Vingt mille colons italiens peuplent la région. Benghazi compte 35 % d'Italiens dans sa population en 1939. En conséquence, la Cyrénaïque et la ville de Benghazi profitent d'un développement économique important dans les années 1930. Une nouvelle ligne de chemin de fer la reliant à Tripoli commence à être construite, mais les travaux sont interrompus en 1940 à cause de la guerre entre Italiens et Britanniques. La ville est bombardée à maintes reprises pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Elle est surtout reconstruite à partir des années 1970, grâce au boum pétrolier.
Les Italiens sont évacués en quasi-totalité, à la suite du traité de Paris de 1947, où l'Italie abandonne ses colonies, dont la Libye. Les biens Italiens sont saisis, et environ 40 % des logements de la ville se retrouvent vides, après le départ massif des Italiens.
Benghazi est bombardée le 15 avril 1986 par les avions de la US Airforce, ainsi que Tripoli. Le président Ronald Reagan justifie ces bombardements par le terrorisme dont les États-Unis sont victimes de la part de la Libye de Khadafi, y compris de l'attentat de La Belle discothèque à Berlin-Ouest fréquentée par des soldats américains tuant trois personnes et en blessant 230, le 5 avril 1986.
Onze manifestants trouvent la mort en février 2005 pendant des émeutes devant le consulat d'Italie dans la vague des manifestations contre les caricatures de Mahomet.
La ville devient le berceau de la guerre civile libyenne de 2011, notamment le 19 février où une cinquantaine de personnes sont tuées par l'armée, faisant 173 morts en quatre jours[source insuffisante]. Le lendemain, la ville en proie à de violents affrontements tombe entre les mains des insurgés, début du soulèvement de Benghazi. Mais avant leur départ la police et les troupes du colonel Kadhafi commettent de nombreuses exactions.

Au lendemain de la chute de Kadhafi, la ville tombe entre les mains de milices islamistes rivales qui affrontent aussi quotidiennement l'armée régulière dirigée par le général dissident Khalifa Haftar. Ainsi, de violents combats éclatent le 13 juillet 2014 pour le contrôle de l'aéroport de Benina. Deux semaines plus tard, les islamistes lancent une offensive contre le quartier général de l'unité des Forces spéciales de l'armée situé près du centre-ville.
L'avocate et militante pour les droits des femmes, Hanane Al-Barassi est assassinée le 20 novembre 2020 dans une rue commerçante de Benghazi par des hommes armés non identifiés. Elle avait publié, peu de temps auparavant une vidéo critiquant des groupes armés proches de Khalifa Haftar, l'homme fort de l’Est

Économie
Benghazi possède un aéroport : l'aéroport international de Benina (code AITA : BEN). Son port marchand, fermé durant la guerre civile, a repris ses activités en novembre 2017.

Monuments et architecture
Site archéologique de Bérénice, autour du phare : vestiges d'un rempart grec du IIIe siècle av. J.-C., de trois maisons romaines à péristyle, et d'une église byzantine à sol en mosaïques qui se trouvaient au nord de l'ancienne ville, les parties sud et est sont enfouies sous la ville moderne.

Trésor de Benghazi
Constitué d'une collection de 7 700 pièces d’or, d’argent et de bronze, certaines datant de l’époque d’Alexandre le Grand, mais aussi de bijoux précieux et de figurines, le « Trésor de Benghazi » était conservé dans une banque de la ville depuis un demi-siècle. Il a disparu au cours de la révolte libyenne de 2011. Les auteurs de ce vol se sont introduits en forant une plaque de béton menant à une voûte souterraine de la Banque nationale de commerce de Benghazi.

## Overview
Benghazi is the second largest city in Libya, with a population of 630,000 (2011). It is a center of Libyan commerce, industry, transport and culture. It continues to hold institutions and organizations normally associated with a capital city, including several national government buildings as well as the National Library of Libya.

## Understand
The people of Benghazi are incredibly friendly. However, very few people speak any English and, because of the writing style (which is written right to left in Arabic), it can be almost impossible to recognize any public signs if you don’t know how to speak or read Arabic. Most things can, however, be sorted out with a bit of pointing and hand waving. The name derives from the Ottoman Turkish word Marsa ibn Ghazi who was a Turkish soldier.
The dress code is not as liberal as in Tripoli, and women should keep themselves covered - not because there would be trouble, but just out of respect. However, locals do not expect non-Muslim visitors to thoroughly comply with their customs.
People in Tripoli like a good argument and may shout at one another, but this is not an indication of any trouble. Even if it sounds harsh to you, if you understand Arabic, you will find out it is generally nothing of any consequence.
If you travel on a tourist visa, you must get the hotel staff to have your passport stamped or visit the local police station to register where you are staying and get a stamp in your passport - otherwise, you will not find it easy to leave the country.
If you wish to drive out of the city and visit the ruins or other sites of interest, you can get a local guide, but you will need a permit from the local tourist office before you may leave the city.

## By plane
32.097520.2708331 Benina Airport (BEN  IATA Arabic: مطار بنينة الدولي) (20 km from city centre). The airport operations are seemingly chaotic, with handwritten boarding passes and luggage tags and very little information available.
Delays are quite frequent and flights may be suspended, cancelled or delayed at any time.
The airport toilet facilities are awful, there are few, if any, public toilets, and most restaurants do not have them either, so you may have to wait until you get to the hotel or onto the aircraft.

## Taxis
Taxis in Libya are interesting. They are either minibuses that travel round a predefined route or black and white cars (dead pandas) with taxi signs. Stick with the cars. Taxi travel is very cheap, but the vehicles are generally in a bad state of repair. Try to sit in the back as the journeys can be somewhat exciting when in the passenger seat, when drivers tend to turn across traffic lanes. Judging by the number of dents on the sides of the cars, the drivers do not always make this maneuver successfully.
Taxi vehicles often lack parts that Westerners tend to take for granted -- such as indicators, headlights, bumpers, working brakes and wheel nuts.
The taxi drivers are like most European taxi drivers. They enjoy sharing their opinions with you, even if you can't understand them - but, as with most of the people in Benghazi, they are friendly, and they do try to make you feel welcome.

## See
32.11388920.0594441 Benghazi Cathedral. Constructed during the 1930s in a neo-classical style, the Benghazi Cathedral used to be one of the largest churches in North Africa. It fell into disuse during the 1960s but has been renovated.
32.12154820.0614992 Atiq Mosque (المسجد العتيق). Historic mosque, built in 1577 AD.      (updated May 2020)
Museum of the Crimes of the Dictator. This museum is the palace from which King Idris declared independence from Italy in 1951. In the front of it is anti-Gaddafi artwork and a piece of a plane that was destroyed in 19 March 2011 defending the new Libya, honouring the pilot that died flying it.

## Currency
Shops accept only local currency, which can be exchanged at the larger hotels in the mornings or after 15:00. Ask for Tibesti Hotel, a big hotel, with grass on the slopes around it. It has a bureau de change and two cashpoint machines, which accept Visa and Maestro/Cirrus.
Credit cards are not generally accepted, so nobody will say 'that will do nicely'. (very limited number of shops accept them)

## Shopping
For those who are looking for famous brands, then go to Dubai Street, where most of the international brands, such as Benetton, Nike, Celio, Addidas, Puma, Max Mara, and many more are available.
As there are very few tourists in Benghazi, there is very little to buy other than normal goods. So, it's easy to get a fridge, an aircon unit, a mobile phone, Mars bars, or Coke, but very little to buy as a souvenir. A sheesh? Pipe is a good bet - these are about 18 Libyan dinars for a 24-inch-high pipe. For traditional souvenirs, the best place will be Sok el Jered.

## Eat
Anything.
There is nothing that isn't acceptable to the western palate - the food can be quite spicy, although not excessively so.
Traditional Libyan fare appears to be couscous, kebabs, spicy potatoes, salads, and nothing that you wouldn't find in London.
There are a number of good restaurants. Although very basic by western standards, they do produce good meals. Round the back of the Tibesti Hotel there are some good Turkish restaurants; most of their food is very edible, and the prices are very reasonable.
Generally, service is very slow, so leave a good amount of time to have a meal. There are kebab takeaways if you are in a hurry, but in a hotel you can wait 30 minutes to get a waiter to take your order or bring you a menu. To save time it is often easier to pay for your meal/drinks as they are served, before saving the half-hour wait to get a bill.
The food is generally served a little cooler than you expect - it is generally warm rather than hot, and the chips are worth avoiding as they tend to be rubbery.

## Drink
Alcohol is not allowed in Libya. The best things to drink are:
Coffee, although they do seem to want to give you Nescafe, as they think it's pretty cool; but just about everywhere you can get cappuccino or Arabian coffee, which are pretty good.
Coke, Lilt, and 7Up cans are popular, as well as the lemon and mint teas.
Alcohol-free beer is widely available (Becks), as is 'Spitz', which tastes like campari or cough mixture. If you really want alcohol, wine is available from butcher's shops, but it's expensive (whisky is about USD 100 per bottle). It is said that the penalty for being caught drunk or with alcohol is to be driven back to your hotel room by the police. While this sounds safer than riding the local taxis, such approach is not recommended.

## Smoking
A smoker's paradise. You can smoke anywhere you like. The "no smoking" signs in airports appear to be a guidance note rather than a command.
Hand-rolling tobacco is not available, but normal cigarettes are widely available and quite cheap, although slightly different than their western counterparts.
Duty free is somewhat limited, so it is best to buy on the way out rather than on the return journey; this obviously, does not apply to alcohol.

## Sleep
Standards of maintenance are not always perfect and service can be slow, the rating system does not really correspond to international guidelines. Consider bringing your own towels.
32.1107120.0683531 Tibesty Hotel, ☏ +218 61 909-0016. Large and well-known, formerly four-star hotel, in downtown next to the beach. Reportedly open as of 2020.      (updated May 2020)
Hotel Sunotel, ☏ +218 61 909-5160, fax: +218 61 909-2114.

## Mobile phones
Outgoing calls and texting work on most networks. However, it is worth buying a local sim card from one of the mobile phone shops. These are much cheaper (around 1/5th of the normal roaming charges), and they will accept incoming calls.
There is no GPRS, but the 3G service allows you to send picture messaging.
Libya's phones are all unlocked, so the locals will not understand that the local sims will not work in all phones. Therefore, it is worth taking an unlocked phone or, when asking to buy a phone, hide yours, so they won't try to sell you a sim.

## Internet access
As of yet there are internet cafes in the area, but ADSL and WiMax internet are now available.

Misrata ( miss-RAH-tə; Arabic: مصراتة, romanized: Miṣrāta, Libyan Arabic: Məṣrāta; also spelled Misratah and known by the Italian spelling Misurata) is a city in northwestern Libya located in the Misrata District, situated 187 km (116 mi) to the east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast near Cape Misrata. With a population of about 881,000, it is the third-largest city in Libya, after Tripoli and Benghazi. It is the capital city of the Misrata District and has been called the economic and trade capital of Libya. Its harbor is at Qasr Ahmad.

Etymology
The name "Misrata ⵎⵙⵔⴰⵜⴰ" derives from the Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, whose homeland in Antiquity and the early Islamic period was coastal Tripolitania.
"Trirone Acrone", the oldest description mentioned by Ptolemy III Euergetes of Misrata because it consists of three heads of land stretching into the sea depth, and got Misrata importance by being at the crossroads of many convoys and also because it is in the middle of an agricultural area with the name of "Cephalae Promentorium" (Kevalay) of the Greek geographer Strabo. And the city of Misrata is one of the commercial stations that have been built by the Phoenicians, since more than 3000 years (The Tenth Century BC) to the north-western parts of the Libyan coast. The flag then by the name of Thubactis Misrata and know that name in relation to the Berber tribe of Misurata (The Misurateens), which means the sailors.

History
Early history
Modern Misrata was established around the 7th century AD during the beginning of modern Libya's rule by the Caliphate. Some contemporary sources claim the town existed prior to Islamic rule, during the Roman Empire era and that its initial Arabic name derived from its Roman name Thubactis. David Mattingly, author of Tripolitania, a comprehensive reference book on northwestern Libya, stated that identification of Misrata as the ancient Thubactis is particularly problematic, complicated and "defies an easy answer." Nonetheless, the Roman town was located at some point on the oasis upon which the modern city sits. The two common identifications are at the eastern and western anchorages of modern Misrata or south and inland of the city, respectively. The Roman town was recorded as one of the six municipia (small self-governing cities) of the Tripolitania province, a rank below coloniae (cities with full citizenship rights.)
In any case, in the 7th century, Misrata served as a caravan supply center and an important port. Merchant traders from Misrata were well known throughout the Sahara during the years of the Caliphate (7th–19th centuries). In addition to its strategic location, the city established itself as one of Libya's oldest producers of luxury carpets. The Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, inhabited the coastal region of Tripolitania during the Roman and early Arab eras.

Ottoman era
The region of Tripolitania, which included Misrata, came under the regency of the Ottoman Empire in 1551. By the beginning of the 19th century, Misrata had established itself as a major center for the Trans-Saharan trade route, where caravans carrying gold, leather, and slaves regularly stopped. Because of the rainfall along the coast, which was abundant compared to other cities in Tripolitania, and supplemental water from underground springs, Misrata's inhabitants were able to engage in unusually fertile agriculture in this largely arid region. The city was filled with thick areas of vegetable gardens while the surrounding countryside included fields of wheat, barley, date palms and olive orchards. Misrata's artisans also expanded on the city's ancient carpet industry for which it was regionally renowned. Although Misrata contained a well-built harbor, most of its long-distance trade was overland because the city of Benghazi to the east served as the preferable substitute for maritime shipping.
As a result of the abolition of slavery and increasing European colonial influence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Trans-Saharan trade declined and consequently Misrata's role in the trade decreased. However, the decline in Trans-Saharan trade saw the establishment of weekly and permanent markets in the city, replacing the seasonal markets associated with long-distance trade. Because of this new economic situation, the residents of the countryside devoted less time to pastoralism, husbandry and guide service for foreign traders and began to shift their focus on agricultural production. Farmers concentrated on growing cash crops, relying on market relations to provide income for their families, instead of subsistence farming and periodic barter exchanging. Bedouins increasingly abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and began to settle into permanent dwellings within the city limits. To cope with an rising population due to immigration from the surrounding areas, Misrata witnessed a construction boom in the late 19th century. A covered produce market and numerous streets lined with shops were built in addition to new district and municipal government offices, a renovated Ottoman army barracks and several Turkish-style houses for the city's wealthy families.

Two clans, the Muntasir and Adgham, dominated the political, social and economic aspects of Misrata and led the local tribes against their Turkish overlords during various periods of tension. There were many wealthy families in the city, but the Muntasirs, who were of Arabian descent, and the Adghams, who descended from Ottoman officers who settled in the province in previous centuries, were the most prominent. They made their income from commerce and protected their wealth by cooperating with the Ottoman provincial authorities. Both had extended families and economic holdings not just in Misrata, but also the provincial capital of Tripoli as well as the eastern Cyrenican towns of Benghazi and Derna. The Aghdams had traditionally resisted efforts by the central Ottoman government in Istanbul to reestablish direct control over Tripoli Province and, under the leadership of Osman al-Aghdam, they led a rebellion against the Ottomans and their local allies in 1835. After their eventual defeat in 1858, they were left in an inferior position to that of the Muntasirs. The Aghdams remained a powerful force nonetheless and their competition with the Muntasirs for leading positions within the local and regional government dominated Misratan politics. Misrata's urban residents did not contribute much to the political scene and avoided contact with the Ottoman authorities out of concern of conscription into the army and provincial tax collection. In contrast, the rural areas of Misrata were populated mostly by fellahin (peasantry) and former Bedouins who had retained their tribal affiliations and loyalties and thus involved themselves in competition for political influence.
Up until 1908, the Muntasirs, led by Umar al-Muntasir, controlled the upper echelons of the newly organized bureaucracy in Tripoli Province and were largely accepted by the local notables as the administrators of Misrata along with Sirte, Gharyan and Tarhuna. However, that year, the Young Turks acquired power in Istanbul and ousted the traditional Ottoman leadership. Viewing the Muntasirs as loyalists of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the ousted sultan, they made efforts to reduce Muntasir power in the region. The Young Turk administration in Tripoli vetoed Muntasir membership in the local parliament and dismissed the governor of Tarhuna who was Umar al-Muntasir's son, Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir, from his post. In addition, they allegedly hired a group of local Misratans to assassinate Abd al-Qasim, another one Umar's sons.

Italian occupation
In October 1911, Italy had launched an invasion against Ottoman Tripolitania, but were unable to reach Misrata until June 1912. Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir had consulted with the Italians in Rome months prior to the invasion and Umar al-Muntasir used his influence to coordinate with them militarily once they landed on the Libyan coastline. In return for their collaboration, the Muntasirs were able to maintain their administrative role and gained positions as advisers to the Italian military authorities.
During World War I, Misrata played an important role in the Libyan-Ottoman resistance against the occupying Italian Army. Under the leadership of Ramadan al-Swehli, the city was used a base of support for the Ottoman Empire and his Misratan army dealt a major blow to the Italians at Qasr Abu Hadi near Sirte in April 1915. Over 500 Italian troops were killed while Swehli's troops captured over 5,000 rifles, various types of machine guns and artillery and several tons of ammunition. As a result of this Libyan victory, Italy's army and their Muntasir allies withdrew from Misrata. By 1916, Misrata had become semi-autonomous and collected taxes from Sirte, the region of Fezzan and the area between it and Sirte as well as the Warfalla tribal area south of Tripoli. Because of its strategic harbor, Ottoman and German forces used Misrata as one of their principal supply ports during World War I. The city became the headquarters of a wide-ranging administration which supervised military recruitment and tax collection, had its own ammunition factory, printed its own currency and operated its own schools and hospitals. However, once Nuri Bey, the Ottoman officer in charge of the Libyan front, was recalled to Istanbul in early 1918, Ottoman influence waned in Misrata. Suwayhli lost his main backer and a huge source of funding as a result.
Although the Italians reestablished their control of much of Libya following their victory in World War I, al-Swehli retained his position as administrator of Misrata. In 1920 he expelled his Italian adviser from Misrata and controlled the town independently with about 10,000 fighters. Al Rakib, a Tripoli-based newspaper, commended the order and security in place at Misrata under al-Swehli as well as the strict application of Islamic law including the suppression of hard liquor. In June, however, al-Swehli attempted to attack the Muntasirs and Warfalla in the area between Misrata and Tripoli, but his forces were defeated and al-Swehli was executed by Abd al-Qadir al-Muntasir's troops. A few weeks after the battle, the new Italian governor attacked Misrata.
During the mid-1920s and 1930s, Misrata became a center of Italian colonization. A new town was laid out on a grid pattern and several public buildings were constructed including a new municipal office, the first hospital of the area, a modern state-of-the-art church (which was later converted to a mosque) and a large hotel. Giuseppe Volpi was named Conte di Misrata, or the "Count of Misrata." In 1935 the construction of the road connecting Zuwara in the west to Misrata was completed. Later in 1937 was built the Via Balbia, a main road that connected Misrata with Tripoli and Benghazi, and in 1938 Libya governor Italo Balbo created on the outskirts of Misrata the new cities of "Gioda" and "Crispi".
In January 1939, the Kingdom of Italy created the 4th Shore, with Libya's four coastal provinces of Tripoli, Misrata, Bengasi, and Derna becoming an integral part of metropolitan Italy. The last railway development in Libya done by the Italians was the "Tripoli-Benghazi line" that was started in 1941 and was never completed because of the Italian defeat during World War II: a new railway station was built in Misrata, but was destroyed by the British attacks in 1942.

Independence
United Kingdom of Libya was born out of the independence movement. In response to alleged vote rigging during the 1952 parliamentary elections, Misrata witnessed mass riots which contributed to the Libyan monarchy's permanent ban on political parties.
Following Muammar Gaddafi's coup that overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in 1969, Misrata grew rapidly from the 1970s onward. Two iron and steel mills were established in the city resulting in a mass migration of Libyans from nearby rural areas to Misrata and consequently generated population and economic growth. The marina was rapidly developed to host shipping to service the steel plants and other factories with raw materials and other goods.
During this period Misrata became the principal economic, educational and administrative center of eastern Tripolitania. The majority of government ministries have branch offices in the city in addition to several college universities, schools and hospitals. The commercial area of Misrata contains numerous shops, restaurants, and cafes. The extensive development of the city attracted large numbers of immigrants to Misrata, giving it a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The main square adjacent to the old souk resembles those of major Moroccan cities.

Revolution
Starting on 20 February 2011, small demonstrations took place in Misrata in solidarity with anti-government protesters in Benghazi. Libyan police immediately arrested the Misratan protesters, sparking larger demonstrations which Libyan government forces sought to quell using live ammunition. Within a few days, 70 protesters were killed provoking outrage among the city's inhabitants. By 24 February, Benghazi fell under the control of anti-Gaddafi forces in the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi. That same day, Gaddafi regime forces attempted to wrest control of the city, but were repelled.
The battle was renewed with shelling on 20 March as pro-Gaddafi tanks and artillery pushed forward and besieged Misrata. Eyewitnesses reported that pro-Gaddafi soldiers were shooting, killing and injuring unarmed civilians. The city was shelled by artillery, tanks, and snipers for over 40 days and had its water supply shut off by Gaddafi's forces. By late April, over 1,000 people in the city were reported killed while around 3,000 were injured. With air support from NATO which entered the conflict on the rebels' side on March 19, and a vital sea-based life line from neighbouring country the Island of Malta, anti-Gaddafi forces managed to force loyalist troops to retreat on April 21, gaining control of most of the city by mid-May.
Thereafter, forces from Misrata played an important role in other theaters of the war, such as the Battle of Tripoli, the Battle of Sirte and the Battle of Bani Walid (2011).

Geography
Misrata lies on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea 187 km (116 mi) east of Tripoli and 825 km (513 mi) west of Benghazi. The location of the city creates a dualism of sea and sand, bounded by the sea to the north and east and to the south by golden sands dotted with palm and olive trees.
Like Benghazi and Tripoli, Misrata is divided into two distinct sections. Older Misrata consists of small stone houses and narrow arched streets while the newer part of the city, which began to develop in the 20th century, consists of modern buildings, homes, factories and industrial areas. Aside from its distinct location, which makes it a centre for the exchange of commodities and materials with the rest of the cities of the country, Misrata has modern infrastructure, including paved roads, electricity and communications.

Climate
The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Misrata's climate as a hot semi-arid climate (BSh).

Demographics
The city is considered to be the "main center of the Turkish-origin community in Libya"; in total, the Turks form approximately two-thirds (est.270,000 in 2019) of Misrata's 400,000 inhabitants.

Economy
Serving the role of Libya's commercial hub, Misrata is notably clean and construction is well-organized. Its citizens are largely viewed by other Libyans as business oriented. The city's steel mill industry (which is dominated by the government-owned Libyan Iron and Steel Company) is one its principal income producers and sources of employment. Due to the 1970s-80s renovation of Misrata's marina to better supply the industrial plants with raw material, the industry has been able to expand and the steel mill authorities hold considerable influence in the city. Al-Naseem Dairy, one of the largest private companies in Libya, is also located in Misrata and employs around 750 workers.
A historic aspect of the local economy is the cloth and textile industry. Situated near the city's central square are souks ("open-air markets") where, usually three times a week, merchants continue to sell luxury carpets, furniture cloth and traditional clothing, including abayas (cloaks worn by males for celebratory occasions.)
Most major businesses, shops and social centers are located on Tripoli Street, Misrata's main thoroughfare. During the Siege of Misrata, most of the buildings housing these assets were destroyed. However, several small businesses are beginning to rebuild and reopen. Nonetheless, recovery remains relatively slow partially due to the shortage of banknotes since Libyan banks are only allowing citizens to withdraw or borrow limited amounts of funds. Once the Libyan Central Bank receives most of the assets that had been internationally frozen during the civil war, it is probable that local banks would ease these restrictions.
The city has a great potential for expansion since it attracts a lot of internal immigration and is surrounded by uninhabited flat land with no obstacles. It is home to Misrata Airport, one of Libya's largest airports. There is a port in the neighbouring town of Qasr Ahmad. Misrata is the seat of many national companies such as the Libyan Ports Company, Libyan Iron and Steel Company, the Libyan publishing, distribution and Advertising Company. Besides that, it has branches of public and private sector banks and one locally and privately owned bank.

Government
Misrata is governed by a local council consisting of 28 seats. The city held its first free elections on 20 February 2012 after a month of organizing. It was the first major city to hold local elections in post-Gaddafi Libya while other cities had their municipal officials by the national interim government. Voter registration was at 101,486 and the number of candidates was 28, all of whom were independents. The mayor of Misrata during the civil war was Khalifa al-Zwawy, while first elected mayor became Yousef Ben Yousef.

Education
Misurata University, with its 15 faculties, is located in the city of Misrata. There are several higher education institutions including a number of university faculties that are administratively linked to universities of other cities in Libya. Misurata University is a modern university which was established in 1983, persisting a long-term goal to have an educated community and to end illiteracy and innumeracy in society. Despite its short age, the university has gained excellence in providing the knowledge and skills required for higher education studies, and has enjoyed a great reputation for the teaching, research and training it provides. It has constantly topped the university rankings league in Libya and was recently ranked first in Libya and the 55th in Africa according to the Webometrics Rankings 2013. (e.g. Al-Tahadi University of Sirte and Tripoli University of Tripoli).

Misrata (arabe : مصراته) est une ville de Libye, située à 200 km à l'est de Tripoli, la capitale. Elle est également chef-lieu du district homonyme. Sa population était d'environ 400 000 habitants en 2005. Il s'agit de la troisième ville de Libye par sa population et la capitale économique du pays. Son port, situé à Qasr Ahmad, dispose d’importantes industries de sidérurgie.
La communauté tcherkesse compte 10 000 membres.

Géographie
La ville occupe une grande oasis au bord du golfe de Syrte séparée de la côte par une zone de dunes. Le cap de Misrata se trouve à 4 kilomètres au nord de la ville et le port de Qasr Ahmed à 12 kilomètres au sud. Celui-ci fait partie de l'agglomération de la ville qui est à 210 kilomètres au sud-est de Tripoli. Elle est reliée par la Via Balbia à Tripoli et à Benghazi, qui passe le long de la côte. D'autres routes la relient à l'intérieur à Sebha et à Ghadamès.

Histoire
La ville a été fondée par les Romains sous le nom de Tubartis, au IIIe siècle ap. J.-C. Après une période d'abandon elle est reconstruite par les Arabes au VIIe siècle sous le nom de Thubactis, et devient un point d'arrivée des caravanes du désert. Son port datant du XIIe siècle prend de plus en plus d'importance économique dans une zone appelée à l'époque côte des Barbaresques, mais elle perd ce rôle à l'époque ottomane.
La ville est conquise par les Italiens le 8 juillet 1912, à l'issue de la guerre italo-turque. Elle est reprise par la tribu Senoussi en 1915. En 1918, une république locale est proclamée et dure deux ans.
Les Italiens en font la reconquête le 26 février 1923, au cours d'un expédition dirigée par le gouverneur Giuseppe Volpi et le général Pizzari. Les Italiens abandonnent la ville aux Britanniques en janvier 1943.

Première guerre civile libyenne 2011
Elle est le théâtre d'affrontements pendant la Première Guerre libyenne de 2011. Assiégés, ses défenseurs, partisans du CNT, finissent par repousser les troupes kadhafistes, puis à participer de façon significative à la conquête des villes côtières de Tripolitaine. Une grande partie des constructions qui remontaient à l'époque de la colonisation italienne ont été détruites lors des violents combats et du siège de la ville lors de la révolution de 2011.
La ville est une plaque tournante du commerce régional notamment grâce à ses liens avec le Qatar et la Turquie. Elle est un fief des Frères musulmans dans la région.

Le 17 décembre 2017, lors de la Deuxième guerre civile libyenne, Mohamad Echtewi, maire de Misrata élu en 2014, est brièvement enlevé à sa sortie de l'aéroport, d'où il revenait de Turquie, puis tué.
En janvier 2018, malgré la signature d'un accord autorisant les habitants de Tawarga à revenir dans leur ville, les milices de la ville rivale de Misrata, qui ont pillé et brûlé la ville, les en ont empêchés. La signature de cet accord serait l'une des motivations du meurtre du maire de Misrata, Mohamad Echtewi, en décembre 2017.
On estime en 2019 que Misrata compte 200 milices fortes de 18 000 hommes.

## Overview
Misrata (Arabic: مصراتة, Misrata) is a city in Northwestern Libya and the third most populous city in Libya.

## Understand
Misrata is bounded by the sea to the north and east and to the south by golden sands dotted with palm and olive trees.
Misrata is divided into two distinct sections. Older Misrata consists of small stone houses and narrow arched streets while the newer part of the city, which began to develop in the 20th century, consists of modern buildings, homes, factories and industrial areas.
The city is considered to be the "main center of the Turkish-origin community in Libya", composing two-thirds of Misrata's 400,000 inhabitants in 2019.

## History
The history of Misrata is a long and rich one. The city’s location on the Mediterranean coast and near the Sahara made it a strategic and commercial hub for various civilizations and empires.
The Phoenicians established a trading post in Misrata in the 7th century BC, which later became a city known as Thubactis. Thubactis was one of the six self-governing cities in the province of Tripolitania, and prospered from trade in gold, leather, and slaves.
The Ottoman Empire eventually conquered Misrata in the 1550s, along with the rest of Tripolitania. The city saw modest urban expansion during Ottoman rule, and maintained its role as a caravan supply centre for the Trans-Saharan trade route.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tobruk ( tə-BRUUK, toh-BRUUK; Arabic: طبرق, romanized: Ṭubruq; Italian: Tobruch) is a port city on Libya's eastern Mediterranean coast, near the border with Egypt. It is the capital of the Butnan District (formerly Tobruk District) and has a population of 120,000 (2011 est.).

Tobruk was the site of an ancient Greek colony and, later, of a Roman fortress guarding the frontier of Cyrenaica. Over the centuries, Tobruk also served as a waystation along the coastal caravan route. By 1911, Tobruk had become an Italian military post. 
During World War II, Allied forces, mainly the Australian 6th Division, took Tobruk on 22 January 1941. The Australian 9th Division ("The Rats of Tobruk") pulled back to Tobruk to avoid encirclement after actions at Er Regima and Mechili and reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941. There prolonged fighting followed, against  a siege by German and Italian forces.
Although the siege was lifted by Operation Crusader in November 1941, a renewed offensive by Axis forces under Erwin Rommel the following year resulted in Tobruk being captured in June 1942. It was held by the Axis forces until November 1942, when it was recaptured by the Allies. 
Rebuilt after World War II, Tobruk was later expanded during the 1960s to include a port terminal linked by an oil pipeline to the Sarir oil field.
King Idris of Libya had his palace at Bab Zaytun. Tobruk was traditionally a stronghold of the Senussi royal dynasty and one of the first to rebel against Muammar Gaddafi in the Arab Spring.

Geography
Tobruk has a strong, naturally protected deep harbour. It is probably the best natural port in northern Africa, although due to the lack of important nearby land sites it is certainly not the most popular. The city is effectively surrounded by a desert lightly populated with nomadic herdsmen who travel from oasis to oasis.
There are many escarpments (cliffs) to the south of Tobruk, as is common across Cyrenaica, the eastern half of Libya. These escarpments generally have their high sides to the south and their low sides (dip slopes) to the north. This constitutes a substantial physical barrier between the north and south of Libya in the Tobruk area.
Previously, Tobruk was some 470 km (290 mi) from Benghazi through the Libyan Coastal Highway, but this distance was shortened to 450 km (280 mi) after the construction of the Charruba–Timimi Road between the years 1975 and 1985. Construction of the Tobruk–Ajdabiya Road reduced the distance between those two cities from 620 km (390 mi) to about 410 km (250 mi).
Because it is approximately 150 km (93 mi) away from Egypt by land, Tobruk is also an important hub for merchants from both Egypt and Libya, and for travellers between the two countries as well as those from Bayda and Derna.
Tobruk suffers a serious saltwater intrusion problem. A factory for the desalination of sea water has been built there.

Climate
Tobruk features a hot desert climate (BWh according to the Köppen climate classification.) However, its maritime location allows it to receive significantly more precipitation than areas further inland in the Sahara desert.

History
Ancient
An Ancient Greek agricultural colony, Antipyrgus (Ancient Greek: Ἀντίπυργος) was once on the site of modern Tobruk, and the ancient name is still occasionally in use. The name roughly meant "across from Pyrgos", referring to a location in Crete across the Mediterranean Sea from Antipyrgos. In the Roman era, the town became a Roman fortress guarding the Cyrenaican frontier. With the spread of Christianity, Antipyrgus became an episcopal see. Only one of its ancient bishops is known by name: Aemilianus, who took part in the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. No longer a residential bishopric, Antipyrgus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. Later the site became a way station on the caravan route that ran along the coast.

World War II
At the beginning of World War II, Libya was an Italian colony and Tobruk became the site of important battles between the Allies and Axis powers.  Tobruk was strategically important to the conquest of Eastern Libya, then the province of Cyrenaica, for several reasons.

Strategic importance
Tobruk had a deep, natural, and protected harbour, which meant that even if the port were bombed, ships would still be able to anchor there and be safe from squalls, so the port could never be rendered wholly useless regardless of military bombardment. This was of critical importance, as it made Tobruk an excellent place to supply a desert warfare campaign. It was also heavily fortified by the Italians prior to their invasion of Egypt in November 1940.
In addition to these prepared fortifications, there were a number of escarpments and cliffs to the south of Tobruk, providing substantial physical barriers to any advance on the port over land. Tobruk was also on a peninsula, allowing it to be defended by a minimal number of troops, which the Allies used to their advantage when the port was under siege. An attacker could not simply bypass the defenders, for if they did, the besieged would sally forth and cut off the nearby supply lines of the attacker, spoiling their advance.
But Tobruk was also strategically significant, due to its location with regard to the remainder of Cyrenaica. Attackers from the east who had secured Tobruk could then advance through the desert to Benghazi, cutting off all enemy troops along the coast, such as those at Derna. This advance would be protected from counterattack, due to escarpments that were quite difficult for a military force to climb, running generally from Tobruk to Suluq. Due to the importance of maintaining supply in the desert, getting cut off in this area was disastrous. Therefore, whoever held both Suluq and Tobruk controlled the majority of Cyrenaica.
Finally, 24 km (15 mi) south of the port was the largest airfield in eastern Libya.  This was significant due to the importance of air power in desert warfare.

Italian advance
Italian forces (and their native Libyan allies—about two divisions of the latter) invaded Egypt in early September 1940 but halted their advance after a week and dug in at Sidi Barrani. In early December, British Empire forces—an armoured division and two infantry divisions—launched a counterstrike codenamed Operation Compass. The Italians had previously invaded Albania and occupied part of the south of France, and had now made a military incursion into a British protectorate.

British capture of Tobruk
The counterstrike involved the British pocketing two of the Italian camps against the Mediterranean, forcing their surrender. This led to a general Italian retreat to El Agheila. Tobruk was captured by British, Australian and Indian forces on 22 January 1941.

Italy called on her German ally, which sent an army corps, under the name Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK). Italy also sent several more divisions to Libya.  These forces, under Lieutenant-General Erwin Rommel, drove the Allies back across Cyrenaica to the Egyptian border, leaving Tobruk isolated and under siege. The defenders of the fortress consisted of the Australian 9th Division, the Australian 18th Brigade and some British tanks and artillery. They were later reinforced and replaced by the British 70th Infantry Division, Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade, a Czechoslovak battalion and a British tank brigade. The siege lasted until December, when Operation Crusader pushed the DAK and Italians back out of Cyrenaica.

German capture of Tobruk
Rommel's second offensive took place in May and June 1942. Tobruk was taken in an outflanking attack on 21 June 1942, capturing the largest number of British Commonwealth troops after the fall of Singapore earlier in the year, where over 80,000 were captured. Rommel was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall, shortly thereafter and was the youngest in the Wehrmacht Heer to achieve this rank. The following units were deployed in Tobruk on 20 June 1942, and most of them were captured by the Axis forces:

2nd South African Infantry Division
4th Royal Tank Regiment
7th Royal Tank Regiment
3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards
1st Battalion, Sherwood Foresters
1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment
2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders
2nd Battalion, 5th Mahratta Light Infantry
2nd Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles
67 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery
68 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery
25th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery

British Commando raid
A British raid on Tobruk on 13–14 September 1942, codenamed Operation Agreement, intended to destroy port facilities and stores being used to support the Axis forces further west. Special forces approached from across the desert while Commandos attacked from the sea. A preparatory air raid by RAF heavy bombers served only to alert the Italian and German defenders. The special forces were unable to silence the coastal artillery batteries and the seaborne assault had to be abandoned after some of the Commandos had been landed in the wrong place. The retiring vessels were then attacked from the air. The British sustained almost 800 casualties, together with a cruiser, two destroyers and several smaller ships and boats.

British recapture
Tobruk remained in Axis hands until 11 November 1942, when the Allies captured it after the Second Battle of El Alamein. It remained in Allied hands thereafter. Although not as much a reason for its strategic significance, the British built a rail line from El Alamein to Tobruk during the course of the war. This rail line was significant both for purposes of supply and as a sense of pride to the Allied troops, as the rail line was built through a little-populated, inhospitable desert.

Libyan Civil Wars
At the outset of the First Libyan Civil War, the city quickly came under the control of the NTC. In September 2014 the internationally recognized government of Libya relocated to a Greek car ferry in Tobruk harbor. A rival New General National Congress parliament continued to operate in Tripoli. In October 2014 they again re-located, to a hotel named Dar al-Salam also known as the Al Masira Hotel in Tobruk. In November 2014 that government was declared illegal by Libya's highest court.

Notable people
Professor Omar El Barasi (b. 1951), who once managed the Libyan branch of Society of Petroleum Engineers, and later became a deputy of Libya PM Abdurrahim El-Keib is from Tobruk and gained his doctorate in petroleum engineering from Waseda University, Japan.
Eman al-Obeidi, a Libyan woman who was abused by the Gaddafi government during the First Libyan Civil War, is from Tobruk.
Omar Mukhtar was born in Zanjhur, near Tobruk.

Transportation
The city is served by Tobruk Airport, with two major domestic airlines serving it.
