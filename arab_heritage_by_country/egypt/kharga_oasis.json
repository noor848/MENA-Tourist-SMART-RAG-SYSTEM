      "content": "The Kharga Oasis (Arabic: الخارجة al-Ḫāriǧa, pronounced [elˈxæɾɡæ]) lit. 'the outer'; Coptic: (ϯ)ⲟⲩⲁϩ ⲛ̀ϩⲏⲃ (di)wah enhib, \"Oasis of Hib\", (ϯ)ⲟⲩⲁϩ ⲙ̀ⲯⲟⲓ (di)wah empsoi \"Oasis of Psoi\") is the southernmost of Egypt's five western oases. It is located in the Western Desert, about 200 km (125 miles) to the west of the Nile valley. \"Kharga\" or \"El Kharga\" is also the name of a major town located in the oasis, the capital of New Valley Governorate. The oasis, which was known as the 'Southern Oasis' to the Ancient Egyptians, the 'outer' (he Exotero) to the Greeks and Oasis Magna to the Romans, is the largest of the oases in the Libyan desert of Egypt. It is in a depression about 160 km (100 miles) long and from 20 km (12 miles) to 80 km (50 miles) wide. Its estimated population is 87,482 as of 2023.\n\nOverview\nKharga is the most modernised of Egypt's western oases. The main town is highly functional with all modern facilities, and virtually nothing left of old architecture. There is extensive thorny date palm, acacia, buffalo thorn, and jujube growth in the oasis surrounding the modern town of Kharga. Many remnant wildlife species inhabit this region.\n\nClimate\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Kharga Oasis experiences extreme summers for most of the year with no precipitation and warm winters with cool nights.\n\nDarb El Arba'īn caravan route\nA trade route called Darb El Arba'īn (\"the Way of Forty\") passed through Kharga as part of a long caravan route running north–south between Middle Egypt and the Sudan. The ancient route connected the Al-Fashir area of Sudan to Asyut in Egypt, navigating through a chain of oases including Kharga, Selima Oasis and Bir Natrun.\nAt least 700 years old, it was likely used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.\n\nThe maximum extent of Darb El Arba'īn was northward from Kobbei in Darfur (located about 25 miles north of al-Fashir) passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending at the Nile River access point of Asyut in Egypt. This is a journey of approximately 1,800 km (1,100 mi). The desert route was less expensive and safer than the more visually appealing Nile route.\nAll the oases have always been crossroads of caravan routes converging from the barren desert. In the case of Kharga, this is made particularly evident by the presence of a chain of fortresses that the Romans built to protect the Darb El Arba'īn route.  The forts vary in size and function, some being just small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.  Some were installed where earlier settlements already existed, while others were probably started from scratch. All of them are made of mud bricks, but some also contain small stone temples with inscriptions on the walls.\nDescribed by Herodotus as a road \"traversed…in forty days,\" by his time the route had already become an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. The length of the journey is the reason for it being called Darb El Arba`īn, the implication being \"the forty-day road\".\nAfter the prominent Christian theologian Nestorius was condemned as a heretic in the 431 Council of Ephesus, he was removed from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople and exiled to a monastery then located in the Great Oasis of Hibis (El Kharga). There he lived for the rest of his life. The monastery suffered attacks by desert bandits, and Nestorius was injured in one such raid. Nestorius seems to have survived there until at least 450 and there had composed the Bazaar of Heracleides—the only one of his writings to survive in full, and of importance to the Christian Nestorians who follow his teachings.\nAs part of a caravan proceeding to Darfur, the English explorer W.G. Browne paused for several days at Kharga, leaving with the rest of the group 7 June 1793. At the time a gindi (a Turkish horseman, that performs extraordinary feats) was stationed at Kharga, \"belonging to Ibrahim Bey El Kebir, to whom those villages appertain; and to [this official] is entrusted the management of what relates to the caravan during the time of its stay there.\"\nIn 1930 the archaeologist, Gertrude Caton–Thompson, uncovered the palaeolithic history of Kharga.\n\nTemple of Hibis\nDemographics\nIn his diary, “Al-Hajj Al-Bari” mentioned the most important families descending of Christians and Romans in the Kharga Oasis. They are the families of “Al-Jawiya, the families of Al-Tawayh, the Al-Bahramah family, the Al-Sanadiyah family, the Al-Azayza family, the Al-Badayrah family, the Al-Mahbasiya family, the Al-Hosnieh family, and the Al-Na’imah family And the Al-Sharayra family, and there are Nubian families in the village of Baris.  There are few Berber families too who are thought to be the indigenous people of Kharga but the majority today are Arab families.\nPerhaps the most important of these Arab families that came to the Khargha Oasis from the beginning of the year 300 AH are the families of the Idris from Tunisia or Libya, the family of Rekabia and the family of the jewehera from the Hijaz and the family of shakawera and the family of Al-Radawana and the family from the Arabs of Mecca and the family of Al-Shawami from the Levant and there are families from the countries of the Egyptian country such as Dabatiya and Asawiya from Assiut Or Sohag and the Awlad-el-sheikh from Egypt “It is more likely to mean Cairo”, the family of Njarin from Qalamoun in Dakhla, the family of Al Shaabna from Mallawi, the family of Al-Awamir from Al-Amayem tribe and the family of Al-Alawneh from Al-Alawiya in addition to Turkish families such as Al-Dabashiya, Al-Tarakah Al-Kharja and the Bash families The Qaqamqam, Askari, Tannabur, Qitas, and Kashif.\n\nTransportation\nA regular bus service connects the oasis to the other Western oases and to the rest of Egypt. In 1907, the narrow gauge Western Oasis Lines provided twice-weekly train services. A standard gauge railway line Kharga → Qena (Nile Valley) → Port Safaga (Red Sea) has been in service since 1996, but has been decommissioned soon after.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Temple of Hibis is a Saite-era temple founded by Psamtik II, which was erected largely c. 500 BC. It is located about 2 kilometres north of modern Kharga, in a palm-grove. There is a second 1st millennium BC temple in the southernmost part of the oasis at Dush. An ancient Christian cemetery at El Bagawat also functioned at the Kharga Oasis from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. It is one of the earliest and best preserved Christian cemeteries in the ancient world.\nThe first list of sites is due to Ahmad Fakhri but serious archaeological work began in 1976 with Serge Sauneron, director of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale.\n\nSites\nAin El Beleida (Roman)\nAin El Labakha (Roman)\nAin Manawir (Persian, Roman)\nAin Shams El Din (Coptic church)\nAin El Tarakwa (Roman)\nAin Tauleib (Roman)\nDeir Mustafa Kashef (Coptic monastery)\nDeir El Munira (Roman)\nDush, Egypt (Ptolemaic and Roman)\nGabbanat El Bagawat (Coptic cemetery)\nGebel El Teir (Prehistoric times)\nEl Nadura (Roman)\nQasr El Dabashiya (Roman)\nQasr Dush (Greco-Roman)\nQasr El Ghuweita (Late Period)\nQasr El Gibb (Roman)\nQasr El Zayyan (Greco-Roman)\nSumeira (Roman)\nTemple of Hibis (Persian - c. 6th century BC.)\nUmm El Dabadib (Roman)\nUmm Mawagir (Middle Kingdom, 2nd Intermediate Period)\n\nMeteorite dagger\nIn June 2016, a report emerged that attributed the dagger buried with Pharaoh Tutankhamun to an iron meteorite, with similar proportions of metals (iron, nickel and cobalt) to one discovered near and named after Kharga Oasis. The dagger's metal was presumably from the same meteor shower.\n\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nTemple of Hibis\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nBliss, Frank (1998).

      "content": "## Overview\nKharga (Arabic الخارجة) is an oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt.\n\n## Towns and villages\n25.45056130.545251 Kharga (Arabic: الخارجة‎) – The main town and transport hub. It is entirely modern but has visitor facilities, and the district is dotted with ancient sites, the best being the Temple of Hibis and the necropolis of El Bagawat. References on this page to Kharga mean this town and vicinity unless \"Kharga oasis\" is specified.\n24.67428130.6022892 Baris  (Arabic: باريس‎) – The other town, 86 km south and separated by a strip of desert. The main sight is the Roman-era temple at Qasr Dush, and there's also the weird modern shell of the Hassan Fathy village. Baris lacks facilities so most visitors day-trip from Kharga.\n24.69333130.5960193 Hassan Fathy Village – 8 km north of Baris is one of several 20th C villages across Egypt created by re-imagining traditional adobe styles, under the tutelage of architect Fathy (1900-1989). Construction began in the 1960s but halted on the outbreak of war in 1967; the project was abandoned and the buildings were never used.\n24.50846930.61454 Qasr Baris – A village with a Roman adobe ruin.\n25.7154530.5545195 Qasr el Labacha – A settlement 35 km north of Kharga town, with a Roman fort. You will need an off-road vehicle.\n\n## Understand\nKharga is the largest of the five western oases, 160 km long and from 20 km to 80 km wide. The main town is also called Kharga, separated by a desert strip from Baris to the south. The reason to visit is the antiquities just north of Kharga town, and the string of Roman forts set up to control Darb El Arbayin, the \"Forty Days Road\" bringing gold and ivory from Africa into Egypt.\nLike the other western oases, the climate is hot desert, 40+°C summer and 10°C in winter. There is zero rainfall and all the oasis supply is \"fossil water\" extracted from the aquifer, a non-renewable resource.\n\n## Get in\nKharga has an airport but no flights, and trains no longer run here. The old narrow-gauge railway from the Nile valley was replaced in 1989 by a standard-gauge track all the way to Safaga on the Red Sea coast, intended to export phosphates from Kharga's deposits. But by the time it was completed the price of phosphates had dropped, the deposits were never mined, and the new line was abandoned. The track still lies alongside the highway between Kharga and Baris, and in parts along the Baris-Luxor road.\n\n## By bus\nBuses and minibuses ply between Kharga and Baris, taking an hour.\n\n## By road\nThere is a direct highway from Luxor to Baris, at the south end of the oasis. There is no public transport along this route but it is a good highway for taxis and private vehicles.\nA highway leads south from the oasis for mile upon aching desert mile, following the ancient caravan trail towards Darfur, before despairing of further progress and looping back north to Dakhla oasis. There is no crossing point into Sudan.\n\n## On foot\nThe principal sights of Kharga town are within a long walk on a cool day, but you do not want to be weary before you start, and then there is the getting back.\n\n## By taxi\nArrange a taxi to take you around the antiquities, the driver will know which dusty unsignposted turn-off to head down.\nSeveral sights need a vehicle, and some are only for off-road vehicles with a guide.\n\n## See\n25.4765530.5559191 Temple of Hibis. 2 km north of Kharga town, is a large well-preserved temple from the Saite-Persian period of 664-404 BCE. It originally stood on a lake island in the town of Hibis, but lake and ancient town are now farmland, and Hibis means \"plough\". The temple is dedicated to two versions of the god Amun. You enter down a long hallway lined with sphinxes, through several pylons into the main temple. The hypostyle hall has walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, richly decorated. One of these, showing Seth defeating Apep, is a foretaste of Saint George and the Dragon. The naos or inner shrine has a pantheon of Egyptian deity and royal figures, with almost 700 figures. Adult admission LE80, combi-ticket with El Bagawat LE120, as of Nov 2019.\nSeen on a hill east of the Temple of Hibis is the larger of the two temples of Nadura. They are both scrappy, so that is probably close enough.\nNorth of the temple heading towards the Necropolis are remnants of a Roman Christian settlement at Ain el-Kharab and the monastery of Ain Gallal.\n25.48576930.5549392 Necropolis of El Bagawat, Kharga (1 km north of temple). One of the oldest Christian cemeteries in Egypt, which had been used in pre-Christian times. There are 263 Coptic funeral chapels, of which the Chapels of Exodus and of Peace have frescoes of the 4th-7th C AD. There are many mud-brick chapel domes, etched with biblical stories. Adult LE80, combi-ticket with Hibis LE120.      (updated Apr 2020)\nAnother km north of the Necropolis are monastic ruins of Ain Muṣṭafa Qashiff and Deir el Bagawat.\nA further 2 km north is a collection of ruins around Ain Sa'af, Tahunat Hawa (with a tall tower), Burg el Hammam and Gebel el Teir (which has cave carvings).\n25.7830.4633 Umm al Dabadib (in the desert 50 km north of Kharga). A 4th C AD Roman fortress. It is by a waterhole, an obvious spot for an army base and checkpoint on the caravan route. It's still being excavated and one curiosity is that although designed by and for the late Roman Empire, the units of building correspond to ancient Egyptian cubits. There are also rock tombs and an aqueduct. You will need a guide and an off-road vehicle to get here safely and back.\n25.59630.7314 El Munira. The Romans fortified every waterhole on the road north, with a good example here. (Determined to be their imperial equals, the British also had a military camp nearby.) Some 5 km west into the desert are the temples of Ain el Tarakwa and Qaṣr el Ḍabashīya.     (updated Jun 2020)\nOther Roman forts to the north are at Muhammed Tuleib, El Sumeira and Qasr el Gibb.\n25.48830.5135 Ain el Bileida (7 km northwest of Kharga). A complex with a fortress, two temples and various adobe buildings.     (updated Jun 2020)\n25.41468130.535516 Qasr el Baramuni (on a ridge 4 km south of Kharga). The remains of a fortress. Other remains in this area are scattered, scrappy, or almost buried in sand.     (updated Jun 2020)\n25.286630.55797 Qasr el Quweita (Qasr el-Ghueita) (20 km south of Kharga). A triple temple to Amon, Mut and Chons. It is extensive, with carvings. There is not much to see at Ain Askar 500 m away, but interesting artefacts have been found.     (updated Jun 2020)\n25.251430.57098 Qaṣr ez Zaiyan (another 5 km south from Qasr el Quweita). Has a temple to Amun of Hibis.     (updated Jun 2020)\n25.1666730.533329 Tombs of the Sheikhs (32 km south of Kharga, 4 km south of the village of Bulaq). Prince Khalid lies to the south (at the GPS marker) and Sheikh Qamr ad Daula to the north. The road south of here is through desert, until the oasis resumes towards Baris.    (updated Jun 2020)\n24.69630.601210 Ain Shams ed-Din (70 km south of Kharga and 20 km north of Baris). It has remains of a fortress, church and graveyard.     (updated Jun 2020)\n24.71611630.64430211 Tafnis el-Balad. A mountain collection of caves and rock shrines with Greek inscriptions. The public road only reaches the village of Ain Tafnis, and you must have an off-road vehicle and an official archaeologist guide to access the site.\n24.580230.716212 Qasr Dush (15 km south of Baris). Daily 9AM-5PM. The main sight is the extensive sandstone Temple of Isis, Sarapis (or Osiris) and Horus. It was begun under Domitian circa 50 AD and completed over 60 years under Hadrian and Trajan. There's also a smaller second temple of similar date, a Roman fortress, and graveyard. Gold ornaments found nearby in 1989 are now in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. Adult LE80, combi-ticket with Hibis and Bagawat LE120.     (updated Apr 2020)\n24.57428130.67573913 Ain Manawir (out in the sand dunes 5 km northwest of Qasr Dush). It has the scrappy remains of a temple, fortress and aqueduct. Ain Ziyada east of the highway is under excavation (as of 2019) so you cannot visit, and there's little to see.     (updated Jun 2020)\n24.55530.61414 Tower of the Dervishes. In the village of Maqs el-Qibli looks venerable but was only built in 1893 as a British bastion during the Mahdi uprising. It is now a private dwelling.\n25.34630.30515 English Mountain (along the highway to Dakhla). It is the implausible name of one outcrop, where a British observation post was built in 1915. It is littered with canisters and similar remnants, and there is even the hulk of a railway station.     (updated Jun 2020)\n\n## Do\nDig deeper into the subject. This page only covers sights of interest to the casual visitor, but far more is known, on top of the many unknowns that are sure to lie unexcavated. For more, click on the left sidebar to reach the German version, which runs to 36 pages and a level of detail to make all but a desert-hardened archaeologist break out in hives. For entirely different approaches to Egyptian scholarship, read The Egyptologists by Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest (Random House 1965), or any \"Oriental\" murder mystery by Agatha Christie (who married a renowned archaeologist and traveled widely in these parts), or just hum the tunes from Aida.\n\n## Buy\nThere is a line of small stores for basics in the centre of Kharga and to a lesser extent along main drag in Baris. You do not come here for shopping, which is why the traders of antiquity just rested their camels before plodding onward to the fleshpots and markets of the Nile.\n25.44064430.5575361 Old market (near the Darb es-Sindādīya west of Mīdān asch-Schaʿala). Partially covered market.\nEl-Bassatin Souq (south of Mīdān el-Bassātīn).\n25.43430830.5450122 Kharga town week market. A bit outside the city, maybe a kilometer and a half from downtown along the road to Bārīs, there are halls where a market takes place each Thursday.\n\n## Eat\nKharga has a cluster of simple places in town centre all with similar fare. They will be delighted to see a Westerner, especially anyone with Arabic beyond \"salaam\" and with ready cash. Baris has a handful of similar places. There is nothing along the badlands roads beyond (the clue's in the word \"desert\"), so eat it all up and say shukran.\nRestaurants mostly open only for dinner, and open around 19:00.\n25.443530.5457691 Al-Geheiny, Midan el-Bassatin. On the northern side of Mīdān el-Bassātīn this restaurant is more value for money than Wimby. For example kebab and kofta on the menu.\n25.44459230.5451142 Alsayad Restaurant (north of Midan el-Bassatin, opposite the Ministry of Health). Restaurant and snack kiosk. You can eat chicken, shwarma, barbecue foods, sandwiches, salads and desserts.\n25.44309530.5438323 El-Ahram, Sh. en-Nabawi (south of Oasis Hotel (Waha Hotel)).\n25.44181230.5461344 El-Baraka, Midan el-Bassatin.

The only restaurant in Kharga open throughout the day. No English menu, but staff understands English. They serve a wide range of food: chicken, liver, lasagne, soups, rice, vegetables, salads, kofta and kebab.\nHotel Sol Y Mar Pioneers also has a restaurant, they serve alcohol.\n\n## Drink\n25.4415630.542591 Café Malūkī (Meloky Caffee), Gamal 'Abd el-Nasser St. (south of Sāḥa square, on the western side). Drinks and food.\n25.45494130.5463482 Sehraya Café and Restaurant (east of Banque du Caire). Friday 16:00-4:00, all other days 9:00-4:00,. Free Wi-Fi    (updated Apr 2016)\n\n## Sleep\nKharga is short on accommodation for being the biggest city in the New Valley and the surrounded by a wealth of archaeological sites. The cheaper places are very barebones and should be considered only if you really must save money.\n\n## Budget\n25.44040730.5586221 Al Dar Al Bayda Hotel (also El Dar El Beida, previously Casablanca), Midan esch-Scha'ala.
