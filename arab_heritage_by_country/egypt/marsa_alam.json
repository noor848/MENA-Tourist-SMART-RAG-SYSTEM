It is described as a \"popular\" tourist destination.  Marsa Alam is a relatively recently built town; its development began in 1995 through the investments of the Kuwaiti Al-Kharafi Group, which established the town and its initial facilities, resorts and infrastructure. Its growth was accelerated by the opening of Marsa Alam International Airport in 2003.  Due to its crystal clear water and its white sandy beaches, it is also known as the \"Egyptian Maldives.\"\n\nGeography\nThe region covers an area of 38,433 km2 and sits at an elevation of approximately 60 meters above sea level.  It is located 274 km south of Hurghada and 134 km south of Qusayr. It is inhabited by about 11,497 residents.\n\nClimate\nDespite being over 135 miles (217 km) north of the tropical zone, the city experiences a tropical hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with steadier temperatures than places to the north such as Hurghada and Sharm el Sheikh. Among major Egyptian cities and resorts, Marsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm el-Sheikh have the warmest nighttime temperatures. Average maximum temperatures during January typically range from 22 to 25 °C (72 to 77 °F) and in August 33 to 40 °C (91 to 104 °F).\nThe temperature of the Red Sea at this location during the year ranges from 22 to 29 °C (72 to 84 °F).\nThe highest record temperature was 45 °C (113 °F), recorded on May 10, 2010, while the lowest record temperature was 5 °C (41 °F), recorded on January 3, 2008.\n\nTourist activities\nBeaches near Marsa Alam include Abu Dabba.

The Hamata area is characterized by the presence of vast areas of mangrove and many types of endemic and migratory birds.  The Hamata Islands area, which is located two miles from the beach opposite the village of Hamata, is characterized by places for practicing swimming and diving activities.\nThe valley was given its name due to the presence of a plant in that area that is palatable to camels.\nWildlife and marine life are active in the reserve, including mountain goat “ibex”, dorcas gazelle, which is also known as the afri, the aril gazelle, which is one of the smallest and most common species of deer, ibex, antelope, and more than 13 species of birds, including the sunset falcon.
