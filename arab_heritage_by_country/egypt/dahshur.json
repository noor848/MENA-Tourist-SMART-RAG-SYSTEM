      "content": "Dahshur (in English often called Dashur; Arabic: دهشور Dahšūr  pronounced [dɑhˈʃuːɾ]) is an ancient Egyptian pyramid complex and necropolis and shares the name of the nearby village of Manshiyyat Dahshur (Arabic: منشأة دهشور) in markaz Badrashin, Giza.\nDahshur is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is located on the Western Desert plateau at the edge of the cultivated plain, and along with the pyramid complexes at Saqqara, Abusir, and Giza,  to its north, forms the pyramid fields of the ancient capital city of Memphis. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, mainly Sneferu's Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613 to 2589 BC.\n\nPyramids\nThe Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza; the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing to this date.\nThe first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name \"the Bent Pyramid\".\nRealizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. Once completed, the pyramid was considered to be a success, as it was a fully constructed, smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees. The Red Pyramid's name derives from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.\n\nAnother pyramid, the White Pyramid, located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it (sand on the outside and limestone on the inside). The weather caused the sand to erode from it, but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.\nKing Senusret III (1878–1839 BC) had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses; Sit-Hathor and Merit.\nThe Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nSeveral other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the Pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri, the archaeologist who excavated this site.\n\nTombs and cemeteries\nLocated closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king's daughters (Sithathor). Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur's pyramids. Dahshur was Egypt's royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.\n\nContemporary history\nIn July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 120 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim Arab clan member to death. Furthermore, during clashes another Muslim suffered head injuries and later died due to a gasoline bomb being thrown from a rooftop of a building. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.\nAs of January 2013, and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the 2011 uprising, the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.\n\nClimate\nDahshur has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.\n\nSee also\nMemphite Necropolis\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nList of megalithic sites\nAcanthus (Egypt), an old village in Dahshur mentioned in Ancient Greek literature.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nInformation about Dahshur on the website of the German Archaeological Institute\nPhotos from inside the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur\nDahshur - Pyramid Breeding Ground\nDahshur\nNational Geographic Video on the Dahshur Pyramids",

      "content": "## Overview\nDahshur (Arabic دهشور Dahšūr, often incorrectly rendered in English as Dashur) is an Egyptian archaeological locality some 10 km to the south of Saqqara and therefore 35 km south of the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\n## Understand\nDahshur is best known as a more tranquil, if also more isolated, site in which to visit several large pyramids - at least, when compared to Giza and Saqqara. Visitor numbers are much smaller, queues are way shorter and there is far less hassle.\nInscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, Dahshur formed part of the extensive necropolis of ancient Memphis during the Old Kingdom - the so-called \"Pyramid Age\". The pharaoh Sneferu (sometimes spelt Snofru), founder of the 4th Dynasty and the father to Khufu - builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza) - managed to erect two complete pyramids at the location, in addition to completing another pyramid (for his predecessor Huni) at Meidum. In sheer volume alone, the father definitely out-did his son!\nSomewhat later, Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom's 12th Dynasty erected their own pyramids at the locality - though on a greatly reduced scale.\nDahshur is very much off the traditional tourist trail around Cairo, having been a restricted military zone until 1996. The Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities is encouraging travellers to visit Dahshur, in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure on the Giza pyramids.\n\n## By tour\nA number of hotels and travel agencies, in Cairo and Giza, offer guided coach tours to Dahshur.\n\n## By taxi\nDahshur is probably best accessed by hired taxi from Cairo, usually as an extension to a day trip to Saqqara and/or Memphis.\n\n## By train\nThere is at least one local train from Ramses Station in Cairo, no. 142 to Al Fayoum aka Fayum, which starts at 8:45AM and also stops in Al Mazghona (LE3). From Mazghona take a tuk-tuk (LE15 as of Jan 2018) to the entrance of the Dashure area.\n29.808531.27121 Al-Marazik railway station (محطة المرازيق).    (updated Jun 2022)\n\n## By metro\nLikewise, you can take a metro to Helwan Station (LE2) and a tuk-tuk from there (LE30-40 as of Jan 2018, not more!). Tuk-tuks aren't allowed into the site, which is a 30-min walk from the gate to the Red Pyramid, and another 20 minutes walk to the Bent Pyramid, with no shade.\n\n## Fees and hours\nThe 29.8081631.229771 ticket office is about 1 km northwest of Dahshur village, right behind the police checkpoint.\nThe Dahshur Necropolis site is open daily 8AM-5PM. Tickets are LE100 (as of May 2023).\n\n## Get around\nThe Red Pyramid is 2.5 km straight west from the ticket office along the road. The pyramid field extends over 3.5 km north to south, which can be walked or done with the vehicle you arrived with, but as 11/2024 only Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid are reachable by tourists (there are no trail to walk, and guards prevent you even to try).\n\n## See\n29.80858831.206151 Red Pyramid (North Pyramid). Also named the Red Pyramid of Sneferu is Egypt's oldest true pyramid (without steps, without bends), probably on account of the red hues of its weathered limestone, now exposed to the elements after the original hard white limestone casing was removed (probably in late antiquity or the medieval period). Some say, however, that the 'red' designation may stem from red graffiti and building marks found around the structure. Well preserved, the Red Pyramid was probably built after the Bent Pyramid, the architects apparently learning from the alterations necessary in the earlier structure, and incorporating the same gentle 43 degree angle used in the upper portion of the Bent Pyramid to construct the Red Pyramid in its entirety. The interior of the Red Pyramid is accessible to the public, after scaling 125 steps. A long, slanting corridor (63 m) leads visitors down to three interior chambers: two antechambers with 12-m-high corbelled vaults and a 15 m high burial chamber with a corbelled ceiling. Human remains, perhaps those of Sneferu, were found in this location. The guy at the pyramid tunnel entrance will request a baksheesh, but the inside is included in your ticket, and you do not have to give him anything just for sitting there..      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.79030331.2093692 Bent Pyramid of Sneferu. Very aptly named, on account of its sudden, startling change in angle halfway up the pyramid, from the steep 54 degrees at the base, to a far more gentle 43 degrees. The angle change was necessary to avoid the pyramid from cracking as it was being built on unstable clay soil. Several rooms in the pyramid are open to visits by the general public.      (updated Jul 2019)\n29.80555631.2227783 White Pyramid of Amenemhat II. It is now nothing more than a pile of rubble, having been heavily quarried for stone. The remaining limestone rubble has given rise to its modern name.   (updated Dec 2018)\n29.7917931.223924 Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III. This pyramid looks like an ordinary steep hill from apart but it is made of millions of regular black mud bricks. Its state is deteriorating and much of it has been fallen apart, except of it inner part.      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.81888931.2255565 Pyramid of Senusret III (around 1.5 km northeast of Sneferu's Red Pyramid). Built for pharaoh Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty.   (updated Dec 2018)\n29.78166731.2213896 Pyramid of Ameny Qemau. Constructed ca. 1790 BC for Ameny Qemau, the 5th pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty. The stone constituting its upper structure has been entirely robbed but the damaged substructures remain.   (updated Dec 2018)\n29.7948831.21697 The Forgotten Temple. With two stelae stumps remaining.    (updated Jan 2018)\n29.80169931.2158928 Tombs of royal women of the 12th and 13th dynasties. The tombs are in the center of the necropolis and are arranged in three rows.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Do\nHike around the area from the Red Pyramid, to the Bent Pyramid, to the forgotten Temple, to the Black Pyramid and finally back into Dahshur village.\nClimb down into the Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid.\n\n## Cope\nWhen hiking in summer, take enough water and sun protection with you.\nIf you think of hiking directly from Dahshur village to the pyramids, it is possible but guards at the Bent Pyramid and the entrance of the Red Pyramid will unfortunately request your ticket.\n\n## Go next\nSaqqara – An extensive number of pyramids and tombs on a plateau above the Nile Valley, just north of Dahshur.\nMeidum Pyramid – A forgotten step pyramid in the countryside more than 30 km northeast of Fayum.\nFayum – A town neglected by most tourists but worth a visit considering the many interesting sites there.",
