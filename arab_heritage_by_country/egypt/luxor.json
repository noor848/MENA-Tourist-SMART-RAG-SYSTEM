      "content": "Luxor is a city in Upper Egypt. Luxor had a population of 284,952 in 2023, with an area of 43.0 km2 (16.6 sq mi) and is the capital of the Luxor Governorate. Nicknamed the City of a Hundred Gates or the City of the Sun, formerly known as Thebes. It was one of the capitals of Ancient Egypt. The city is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. \nLuxor has frequently been characterized as the ''world's greatest open-air museum'', as the ruins of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples, and tombs of the West Bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. Luxor is a major destination for tourism, with its large hotels and resorts, known also for its famous hot air balloons. The city also contains diversified cultural heritage such as temples, churches, and mosques, co-existing side by side. Around 5 million tourists from around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor's attractions, making a significant contribution to the modern city's economy.\nThe city is located between latitudes 25-26 North and 32-33 East. It is about 670 km from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, about 220 km north of Aswan. Luxor covers an area of ​​approximately 416 km², with a populated area of ​​208 km², and its population is estimated at approximately 284,952 in 2023. The nearest seaport to the city is Safaga Port, and the nearest airport is the city's Luxor International Airport.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Luxor derives from the Arabic قصر qaṣr, meaning \"castle\" or \"palace\", in the plural form al-quṣūr (“the palaces\"). It may be equivalent to the Greek and Coptic toponym τὰ Τρία Κάστρα ta tria kastra and ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛ̀ⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ pshomt enkastron respectively, which both mean \"three castles\".\nThe Sahidic Coptic name Pape comes from Demotic Ỉp.t meaning 'the adyton,' which, in turn, is derived from the Egyptian. The Greek forms \"Ἀπις\" and \"Ὠφιεῖον\" originate from the same source. The Egyptian village of Aba al-Waqf shares the same etymology.\n\nThe Greek name is Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θῆβαι) or Diospolis. The Egyptian name of the city is Waset, also known as Nut (Coptic: ⲛⲏ), written as  and .\n\nHistory\nLuxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the ancient Egyptian texts as wAs.t (approximate pronunciation: \"Waset\"), which meant  \"city of the sceptre\", and later in Demotic Egyptian as ta jpt (conventionally pronounced as \"tA ipt\" and meaning \"the shrine/temple\", referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name Karnak, meaning \"fortified village\"), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them as Thebae. Thebes was also known as \"the city of the 100 gates\", sometimes being called \"southern Heliopolis\" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as niw.t, which simply means \"city\", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called niw.t rst, \"southern city\", as the southernmost of them.\nThe importance of Luxor started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the community grew into a thriving city. Montuhotep II, who united Egypt after the troubles of the First Intermediate Period, brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale. Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the Hyksos from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the 18th Dynasty to the 20th Dynasty, the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.\nThe city attracted peoples such as the Babylonians, the Mitanni, the Hittites of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Canaanites of Ugarit, the Phoenicians of Byblos and Tyre, and the Minoans from the island of Crete. A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun. The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally Alexandria.\nHowever, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period. The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amun-Ra. His great temple at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.\nLater, the city was attacked by Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal, who installed a new prince on the throne, Psamtik I. The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, Alexander the Great did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast. Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the Roman Empire who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of Hatshepsut, now called Deir el-Bahri (\"the northern monastery\").\nFollowing the Muslim conquest of Egypt, part of the Luxor Temple was converted from a church to a mosque. This mosque is currently known as the Abu Haggag Mosque today.\nThe 18th century saw an increase of Europeans visiting Luxor, with some publishing their travels and documenting its surroundings, such as Claude Sicard, Granger, Frederick Louis Norden, Richard Pococke, Vivant Denon and others. By the 20th century, Luxor had become a major tourist destination.\n\nArchaeology\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris: Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.\nOn the same day in November 2018, two different discoveries were announced. One was by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities that had found a 13th-century tomb on the West Bank belonging to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the overseer of the mummification shrine at the temple of Mut, and his wife. Five months of excavation work until this point had revealed colorful scenes of the family and 1,000 funerary statues or ushabti. The other discovery was of 1000 ushabti and two sarcophagi each containing a mummy in the TT33 complex by a joint team from the IFAO (French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, Cairo, Egypt) and the University of Strasbourg. One of the sarcophagi was opened in private by Egyptian antiquities officials, while the other, of a female 18th Dynasty woman named Thuya, was opened in front of international media.\nIn October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists, headed by Zahi Hawass, revealed an ancient \"industrial area\" used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture, and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts, and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings, and gold foil, were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity Horus.\nIn October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden coffins (3,000 years old) in front of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in El-Assasif Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females, and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs, and the Book of the Dead, a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the afterlife. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.\nOn 8 April 2021, Egyptian archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass found Aten, a 3,400-year-old \"lost golden city\" near Luxor. It is the largest known city from Ancient Egypt to be unearthed to date. The site was said by Betsy Bryan, professor of Egyptology at Johns Hopkins University to be \"the second most important archaeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun\". The site is celebrated by the unearthing crew for showing a glimpse into the ordinary lives of living ancient Egyptians whereas past archaeological discoveries were from tombs and other burial sites. Many artefacts are found alongside the buildings, such as pottery dated back to the reign of Amenhotep III, rings, and everyday working tools. The site is not completely unearthed as of the 10th of April 2021.\nIn February 2025, a joint Egyptian-British archaeological team announced the discovery of the tomb of Thutmose II near Luxor, marking the first identification of a pharaonic royal tomb in over a century since that of Tutankhamun in 1922. Located west of the Valley of the Kings in an area known as Wadi C, the tomb—designated Wadi C-4—was identified through inscriptions on alabaster vessels bearing the names of Thutmose II and his wife, Hatshepsut. The tomb's interior featured fragments of funerary furniture and decorative elements, including blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars and religious texts. However, the site had suffered damage due to ancient flooding, which led to the deterioration of many of its original contents.\nIn May 2025, Egyptian archaeologists uncovered three ancient New Kingdom tombs at the Dra Abu el-Naga necropolis in Luxor, dating back over 3,500 years; the tombs belonged to high-ranking officials identified through inscriptions as Amum-em-Ipet, Baki (a grain silo supervisor), and “S” (a Temple of Amun supervisor, scribe, and northern oasis mayor). Each tomb features typical New Kingdom architectural elements such as courtyards, halls, burial shafts, and wall depictions of banquet scenes and funerary processions, offering new insights into elite burial customs in non‑royal Theban cemeteries.\nIn May 2025, a joint Egyptian–Canadian archaeological mission identified the owner of Kampp 23, a rock-cut tomb located in the El-Asasif necropolis, as Amun Mes, a high-ranking official who served as the mayor of Thebes during the Ramesside period. The tomb featuring a T-shaped layout typical of the 19th–20th Dynasties was first discovered in the 1970s but remained unattributed until recent excavations revealed inscriptions confirming Amun Mes's identity and several of his titles, including tax collector, royal advisor, divine father of Amun, and overseer of quarry expeditions. The team also found evidence of later reuse, such as painted plaster over original reliefs and fragments of ushabti figures.\n\nLandmarks\nWest bank\nGeography\nApproximately 4,000 years ago, a significant alteration in the geography of the Nile River occurred, particularly in the region near modern-day Luxor. This transformation involved the expansion of the floodplain, which increased the availability of arable land. This geographic and environmental shift likely played a crucial role in supporting the agricultural productivity that underpinned the prosperity and stability of ancient Egyptian civilization during that period and over the years.\n\nClimate\nLuxor has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above 40 °C (104 °F) during summer (June, July, August). During the coolest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above 22 °C (71.6 °F) while average low temperatures remain above 5 °C (41 °F).\nThe climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the Sahara, with less than 1 mm (0.04 in) of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than in Aswan, but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.\nThe climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright, and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.\nIn addition, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Qena, and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost 16 °C (29 °F) difference.\nThe hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991, which was 50 °C (122 °F), and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989, which was −1 °C (30 °F).\n\nCoptic Catholic Eparchy\nThe Coptic Catholic (Alexandrian Rite) minority established on November 26, 1895, an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt. Its episcopal see is St. George cathedral in Luxor.\nIn turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947, to establish the Eparchy of Assiut and again on 14 September 1981 to establish Sohag.\n\nSuffragan Eparchs of Luxor\nIgnazio Gladès Berzi (March 6, 1896 – died January 29, 1925)\nMarc Khouzam (August 6, 1926 – August 10, 1947), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (December 30, 1927 – August 10, 1947); later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (10 August 10, 1947 – died February 2, 1958)\nIsaac Ghattas (June 21, 1949 – May 8, 1967), later Archbishop-Bishop of Minya of the Copts (Egypt) (May 8, 1967 – died June 8, 1977)\nAmba Andraos Ghattas, Lazarists (C.M.) (May 8, 1967 – June 9, 1986), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (February 24, 1984 – June 9, 1986), President of Synod of the Catholic Coptic Church (1985 – March 30, 2006), President of Assembly of the Catholic Hierarchy of Egypt (1985 – March 30, 2006), later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (June 23, 1986 – retired March 30, 2006), created Cardinal-Patriarch (February 21, 2001 – died January 20, 2009), also President of Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the East (2003–2006)\nAghnatios Elias Yaacoub, Jesuits (S.J.) (July 15, 1986 – died March 12, 1994), previously Coadjutor Eparch of Assiut of the Copts (Egypt) (May 19, 1983 – July 15, 1986)\nYouhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (June 24, 1994 – December 27, 2015), previously Eparch (Bishop) of Ismayliah of the Copts (Egypt) (November 23, 1992 – June 23, 1994)\nEmmanuel (Khaled Ayad) Bishay (April 16, 2016 -\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent on tourism. Since 1988, Luxor has been the only city that offers hot air balloon rides in Egypt, which is a common activity for tourists. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly sugarcane. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry, used in eating, and many other uses.\nThe local economy was hit by the Luxor massacre in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks). The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets. Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013, near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals, and nine tourists from Hong Kong.\nTo make up for shortfalls in income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread, and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.\n\nTourism development\nA controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest, vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the 2.7 kilometres (1.7 miles) long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh Amenhotep III and took its final form under Nectanebo I in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated, which was covered by silt, homes, mosques, and churches. Excavation started around 2004.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Egyptian Government announced the discovery of a previously unopened coffin in Luxor, dated back to 18th dynasty of Upper and Lower Egypt. According to the Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anani, it is the biggest rock-cut tomb to be unearthed in the ancient city of Thebes. It is one of the largest, well-preserved tombs ever found near the ancient city of Luxor. On 24 November 2018, this discovery was preceded by the finding of a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransport\nLuxor is served by Luxor International Airport.\nA bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally, river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor.\n\nTransport to sites on the west bank is serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers. There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E., although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day, providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.) crossing to the other side.\nThe city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called \"calèches\", for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.\nFor domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and a sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around 400 metres (440 yd) from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and Aswan to the south.\n\nLuxor University\nLuxor University, founded in 2019, is a non-profit governmental university that provides programs and courses for students.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nLuxor is twinned with:\n\nNotable People\nMeritaten, Egyptian Royal Wife, King's Daughter\nAhmose-Nefertari, Egyptian queen consort\nNeferhotep I, Egyptian pharaoh\nSobekhotep IV, Egyptian king\nAhmed el-Tayeb, Egyptian Islamic scholar\nBahaa Taher (1935–2022), Egyptian novelist\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag (1150–1245), Egyptian Scholar and Saint of Luxor\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of megalithic sites\nLuxor Las Vegas\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBell, Lanny. “Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal ka.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 44 (1985): 251–294.\nBongioanni, Alessandro.

      "content": "الأُقصُر تلقب بمدينة المائة باب أو مدينة الشمس، عُرفت سابقاً باسم طيبة، هي إحدى عواصم مصر في العصر الفرعوني، تقع على ضفاف نهر النيل الذي يقسمها إلى شطرين البر الشرقي والبر الغربي، وهي عاصمة محافظة الأقصر جنوب مصر، تقع بين خطي عرض 25-26 شمالاً، 32-33 شرقاً، وتبعد عن العاصمة المصرية القاهرة حوالي 670 كم، وعن شمال مدينة أسوان بحوالي 220 كم، وجنوب مدينة قنا حوالي 56 كم، وعن جنوب غرب مدينة الغردقة بحوالي 280 كم، يحدها من جهة الشمال مركز قوص ومحافظة قنا، ومن الجنوب مركز إدفو ومحافظة أسوان، ومن جهة الشرق محافظة البحر الأحمر، ومن الغرب مركز أرمنت ومحافظة الوادي الجديد، أقرب الموانئ البحرية للمدينة هو ميناء سفاجا، وأقرب المطارات إليها هو مطار الأقصر الدولي.\nتبلغ مساحة الأقصر حوالي 416 كم²، والمساحة المأهولة بالسكان هي 208 كم²، ويبلغ عدد سكانها ما يقارب 289,618 نسمة بحسب تقديرات عام 2024، تقسم مدينة الأقصر إدارياً إلى خمسة شياخات هي شرعية العوامية، الكرنك القديم، الكرنك الجديد، القرنة، منشأة العماري، وستة مدن وقرى تابعة لها هي: البياضية، العديسات بحري، العديسات قبلي، الطود، البغدادي، الحبيل.\n\nالمعالم والتأسيس\nتضم المدينة العديد من المعالم الأثرية الفرعونية القديمة مقسمة على البرّين الشرقي والغربي للمدينة، يضم البر الشرقي: معبد الأقصر، معبد الكرنك، وطريق الكباش الرابط بين المعبدين، ومتحف الأقصر، أما البر الغربي فيضم: وادي الملوك، معبد الدير البحري، وادي الملكات، دير المدينة، ومعبد الرامسيوم، وتمثالي ممنون.\nيرجع تأسيس مدينة طيبة إلى عصر الأسرة الرابعة حوالي عام 257 ق.م، وحتى عصر الدولة الوسطى لم تكن طيبة أكثر من مجرد مجموعة من الأكواخ البسيطة المتجاورة، ورغم ذلك كانت تستخدم كمقبرة لدفن الأموات، فقد كان يدفن فيها حكام الأقاليمِ منذ عصر الدولة القديمة وما بعدها، ثم أصبحت مدينة طيبة في وقت لاحق عاصمة لمصر في عصر الأسرة المصرية الحادية عشر على يد الفرعون منتوحتب الأول والذي نجح في توحيد البلاد مرة أخرى بعد حالة الفوضى التي احلت بمصر في عصر الاضمحلال الأول، وظلت مدينة طيبة عاصمة للدولة المصرية حتى سقوط حكم الفراعنة والأسرة الحادية والثلاثون على يد الفرس 332 ق.م.\n\nالتسمية\nعُرفت الأقصر عبر العصور المختلفة بالعديد من الأسماء، ففي بدايتها كانت تسمى مدينة «وايست»، ثم أطلق عليها الرومان بعد ذلك اسم «طيبة»، وأطلق عليها كذلك مدينة \"المائة باب\"، كما وصفها الشاعر الإغريقي هوميروس في الإلياذة، وسُميت كذلك باسم «مدينة الشمس»، «مدينة النور»، و«مدينة الصولجان»، وبعد الفتح الإسلامي لمصر، أطلق عليها العرب هذا اسم «الأقصر» وهو جمع الجمع لكلمة قصر حيث أن المدينة كانت تحتوي على الكثير من قصور الفراعنة. يرجع تأسيس مدينة طيبة إلى عصر الأسرة الرابعة حوالي عام 257 ق.م.\n\nالتاريخ\nطيبة هي مدينة متحفية فرعونية قديمة بمصر العليا، وإحدى عواصم مصر القديمة إبان المملكتين الوسطى والحديثة أيام قدماء المصريين.\nكانت طيبة (الأقصر اليوم) مركز عبادة رع واهتم أغلب فراعنة مصر وعلى الأخص خلال الدولة الحديثة ببناء المعابد فيها لمختلف آلهة قدماء المصريين وأهمها الإله أمون رع.\nتوجد طيبة على الضفة الشرقية من النيل وبنيت عليها العاصمة والمعابد وقصور الفراعنة وكان لها عمدة على مر العصور. كانت تعتبر المعابد خالدة لذلك فكانت تبنى من الأحجار الثقيلة، ومنها ما كان يسمى بيت المليون سنة وبنيت أيضا من الأحجار، أما قصور الفراعنة وبيوت السكان فكانت تبنى من الطوب اللبن، باعتبارها ليست للأبدية. لهذا لم يبقَ من قصور الفراعنة شيئا يذكر في حين بقيت المعابد.\nاعتبر المصريون القدماء طيبة والشاطئ الشرقي من النيل دار الحياة ففيها يسكنون ويعيشون ويذهبون للتعبد في المعابد المجاورة لهم. واعتبروا الغرب دار الممات فكانوا يبنون فيها قبورهم. لذلك نجد وادي الملوك في غرب طيبة، ومعه عدد قليل من المعابد. أما المعابد الكبيرة ومن ضمنها الكرنك فكانت في مدينة الأحياء على الضفة الشرقية للنيل.\nيوجد في العاصمة طيبة حوالي 14 من أهم المعابد المصرية ويطلق حاليا عليها الأقصر. ومن أشهر آثارها على الضفة الشرقية للنيل بهو الأعمدة بالكرنك الذي شهد تعديلات كثيرة عبر القرون قام بها فراعنة كثيرون مثل: حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثاني وغيرهم، كما يوجد بجواره معبد الأقصر الذي بناه رمسيس الثاني. تقع بوابة معبد الكرنك الرئيسية في نهاية شماله، وأمامها كانت توجد مسلتان أخذت إحداها لباريس بفرنسا عام 1836م، وهي تزين ميدان «كونكورد» فيها. وفي نهاية شمال المدينة تنتشر مجموعة معابد الكرنك وقد بنيت علي مدى 1500 سنة، لتصبح أكبر منشأة دينية في العالم. تشتهر ببهو الأعمدة الكبيرة التي يبلغ عددها 134 عمودا. وبها بحيرة اصطناعية من عهد الفراعنة.\nوبين معبدي الأقصر والكرنك يوجد طريق الكباش ومعابد أخرى. وعلى الضفة الغربية للنيل كانت أرض الأموات حيث توجد المعابد الجنائزية ومئات المقابر، ومن أكبر وأشهر هذه المعابد الجنائزية معبد الرامسيوم لرمسيس الثاني ويرجع تاريخه إلى الأسرة 19 وبأنقاضه يوجد تمثال ضخم. كما يوجد على الضفة الغربية وادي الملوك ووادي الملكات ودير المدينة وهي مدينة العمال الذين كانوا يقومون ببناء مقابر الفراعنة بالقرب منهم.\nويوجد المعبد الجنائزي للملكة حتشبسوت (معبد حتشبسوت) من الأسرة 18 في الدير البحري غرب النيل، وهو تحفة فنية معمارية. وقد شيد خلال أوائل القرن 15 ق.م في مكان متدرج فوق منحدر شاهق. وأشهر الآثار في الضفة الغربية وادي الملوك حيث عثر به على مقبرة الملك توت عنخ آمون، وبه مقابر تحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثالث والرابع والخامس وسيتي الأول، ومقبرة الملك حور أم حب وجدرانها مصورة بالنقش البارز.\n\nالمناخ\nيتميز مناخ الأقصر بمستويات هطول أمطار أقل من معظم الأماكن الأخرى في الصحراء الكبرى، حيث يقل متوسط هطول الأمطار السنوي عن 1 مم (0.04 بوصة). تعد المدينة الصحراوية واحدة من أكثر المدن جفافًا في العالم، ولا تهطل الأمطار كل عام. الهواء في الأقصر أكثر رطوبة من أسوان ولكنه لا يزال جافًا للغاية. يبلغ متوسط الرطوبة النسبية 39.9٪، مع متوسط أقصى يبلغ 57٪ خلال فصل الشتاء ومتوسط أدنى يبلغ 27٪ خلال فصل الصيف.\nمناخ الأقصر صافٍ للغاية ومشرق ومشمس على مدار العام، في جميع الفصول، مع تباين موسمي منخفض، مع حوالي 4000 ساعة من سطوع الشمس سنويًا، وهو قريب جدًا من الحد الأقصى النظري لمدة سطوع الشمس.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن الأقصر والمنيا وسوهاج وقنا وأسيوط لديها أكبر فرق في درجات الحرارة بين النهار والليل من أي مدينة في مصر، مع فارق يبلغ حوالي 16 درجة مئوية (29 درجة فهرنهايت).\nتم تسجيل أعلى درجة حرارة في 15 مايو 1991، حيث بلغت 50 درجة مئوية (122 درجة فهرنهايت)، وأبرد درجة حرارة في 6 فبراير 1989، حيث بلغت -1 درجة مئوية (30 درجة فهرنهايت).\n\nالمعالم الطبيعية

سكانها يعملون في الزراعة، خصوصاً في زراعة قصب السكر. كما توجد في المدينة العديد من مجالات الاستثمار الصناعي والحرفي، ومن أبرز الصناعات التي يتميز بها السكان الغزل، والخزف، والفخار، بالإضافة إلى الأثاث الخشبي والمعدني.\nتعرض الاقتصاد في الأقصر لانتكاسة كبيرة في عام 1997 بعد الهجوم الذي أسفر عن مقتل 64 شخصاً، منهم 59 سائحاً، مما أدى إلى انخفاض حاد في أعداد السياح الوافدين إليها على مدار سنوات. وبعد ثورة 25 يناير 2011، تراجعت أعداد السياح بشكل ملحوظ في جميع أنحاء مصر.\nيستقبل مطار الأقصر الدولي نحو مليون سائح سنوياً، كما توفر المدينة وسائل مواصلات متنوعة مثل سيارات الأجرة، القطارات، والنقل النهري عبر المراكب الكبيرة التي تنقل السكان والسياح بين ضفتي النيل. وبسبب قلة الموارد، يلجأ العديد من سكان الأقصر لزراعة الخضروات في منازلهم، كما يقومون بتربية الدواجن والطيور والماشية مثل الماعز.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالصحة\nيوجد مستشفى الأقصر الدولي ومستشفى الأقصر العام ومستشفى البياضية المركزي والقرنة المركزي وأرمنت المركزي والعديد من المستشفيات الخاصة.\n\nالحدائق\nالمدينة النوبية.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد الكثير من الفنادق العائمة وفرع لفندقي هيلتون وشيراتون وفندق حبيبه وفندق المريدين وفندق ميركير وفندق إيزيس وفندق سونستا وفندق الونتر بالاس وفندق أبيروتال الأقصر وفندق شتايجن برجر.\n\nالرياضة\nنادي التجديف للرياضات المائية نادي المدينة الرياضي ونادي الأقصر الرياضي وبها العديد من الملاعب الرياضية ومراكز الشباب مثل: ملعب المدينة المنورة وملعب نادي الشعب ويمثل المحافظة نادي خاص بها ومستقل.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nالنقل الجوي\nيخدم مدينة الأقصر مطار الأقصر الدولي، يقع على بعد 6 كم شرق المدينة ويتسع لاستقبال السائحين من مختلف بقاع العالم بأعداد كبيرة (نحو مليون سائح سنويًا). يجري بالمطار عمليات تطوير مستمرة تتناسب مع موقعه الهام والمميز.\nبدأت أعمال تطوير مطار الأقصر القديم في عام 1984 وافتتحت في عام 2005 بتكلفة 450 مليون جنيه فارتفعت الطاقة الاستيعابية للمطار من 800 راكب في الساعة إلى 4000 راكب في الساعة بإجمالي 7.5 مليون راكب سنوياً، ومن 21 طائرة إلى 33 طائرة.\n\nالنقل النهري\nيعد قطاع النقل النهري أحد أهم عناصر منظومة النقل داخل الأقصر بجميع عناصرها سواء الخطوط الملاحية، المراسي النيلية، الأهوسه الملاحية، البنية التحتية للمجرى الملاحي، والتي تخدم العائمات السياحية العاملة بين الأقصر وأسوان وكذلك صنادل النقل والقوارب الشراعية والعبارات.\nيوجد أيضاً «المعديات النهرية» وهي مراكب كبيرة الحجم تنقل أهالي المحافظة والسياح من وإلى البرين الشرقي والغربي بأسعار رمزية، بالإضافة إلى المراكب الصغيرة الخاصة (التي يمتلكها أشخاص)وهي للتنقل والفسحة وسط نهر النيل.\nتمر السفن السياحية الكبيرة التي توفر الرحلات النيلية من القاهرة إلى أسوان على مراسي الأقصر النيلية ويستخدم هذا الخط أيضاً في نقل البضائع ويسمح بالمرور المزدوج للوحدات النهرية.\n\nالنقل البري\nيصل الأقصر بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر عدة محاور برية تبدأ المحاور الشمالية بالربط مع أقرب المحافظات إلى الأقصر وهي قنا، ومن قنا تتفرع المحاور فيمكن الربط شرقاً مع طريق قنا/سفاجا للوصول إلى البحر الأحمر، ومن سفاجا إلى الغردقة، أو شمالاً مع طريق قنا/سوهاج، ثم طريق سوهاج/أسيوط، فطريق أسيوط/القاهرة، وتمر المحاور الشمالية بنفس المحطات أو المدن على نطاقين صحراوي وزراعي موزعة شرقاً وغرباً، وتتمثل في طريق الصعيد الصحراوي الشرقي، طريق الصعيد الصحراوي الغربي، طريق الصعيد الزراعي، طريق الكريمات، وجنوباً تستخدم محاور الصعيد الشرقية والغربية للربط مع أسوان.\n\nاتفاقيات التوأمة\nكازنلاك، بلغاريا. في يوليو 2006.\n كاخيتي، جورجيا..\n يانغتشو،

الجديدة\nهي مدينة مصرية جديدة من مدن الجيل الثالث، تقع في محافظة الأقصر، وتتبع إدارياً لهيئة المجتمعات العمرانية الجديدة، أُعلن عن إنشائها بقرار رئيس جمهورية مصر العربية رقم 55 لسنة 2010، تقع المدينة جنوب شرق مدينة الأقصر، وتبعد عن مدينة طيبة الجديدة حوالي 14.8 كم. تبلغ مساحة المدينة 8976.75 فدان؛ أي 36.32 كم2. ومن المقرر أن تستوعب عند اكتمالها لـ200 ألف نسمة. حجم الاستثمارات في الأقصر الجديدة وصلت ل2.3 مليار جنيه، مقسمة قطاع الإسكان: 935 مليون جنيه، قطاع الخدمات: 320 مليون جنيه، قطاع الزراعة: 22 مليون جنيه، قطاع المرافق: 992 مليون جنيه.\nهدف إنشاء مدينة الأقصر الجديدة يتمثل في عدة جوانب هامة. أولاً، تهدف المدينة إلى المساهمة في حل مشاكل الإسكان في جميع أنحاء محافظة الأقصر، من خلال توفير وحدات سكنية مناسبة للمواطنين. كما تسعى المدينة إلى توفير فرص عمل لشباب المحافظة، مما يساهم في تحسين مستوى المعيشة وتقليل البطالة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تهدف المدينة إلى تعزيز الربط بين مركز ومدينة الأقصر وطيبة الجديدة، مما يجعلها قاعدة تجميع اقتصادية هامة تدعم التنمية في المنطقة. وأخيراً، يتم تجهيز المدينة لتكون أول مدينة جمهورية معدة خصيصاً لاستقبال السياح من ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة، مما يعكس اهتمامها بتوفير بيئة سياحية شاملة.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر أيضاً\nمصادر\nمراجع\nد / محمد عبد القادر محمد،

      "content": "## Overview\nLuxor (Arabic: الأقصر, pronounced in Egyptian Arabic: lo’Sor) is the premier travel destination in Upper (southern) Egypt and the Nile Valley.\n\n## Districts\nAlthough a relatively small city by Egyptian population standards, Luxor is quite extensive. It divides naturally into the areas on each side of the river Nile.\n\n## Understand\nThe dynastic and religious capital of Middle Kingdom (circa 2050-1710 BCE) and New Kingdom (circa 1550-1080 BCE) Egypt, Luxor has much to offer the visitor, from vast temples, to ancient royal tombs, via spectacular desert and river scenery and a bustling modern life.\nThebes, the world heritage listed old capital of Egypt, was on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor. Most of Luxor's ruins and tombs are there.\nThe modern city of Luxor is on the east bank. This area has the train and bus stations, most of the hotels and restaurants, some museums, tourist shops and so on. Most visitors (and almost all tour groups) stay on the east bank and travel across for the tourist sites.There are also some small hotels on the west bank, which has a more relaxed vibe, and many independent travellers stay there.\nHowever, Luxor is also known as the hassle capital of Egypt (and therefore a good candidate for the world). You should expect to be on the receiving end of behaviour that would be considered harassment in most countries, including being followed when you leave the hotel by men shouting at you. Instead, Aswan further south is quite the opposite and much more relaxed. It is a good alternative in case you want to skip the Luxor experience altogether but not miss the beauty of the Nile and the nearby attractive sights.\n\n## Climate\nThe weather is generally extremely hot in summer, while in winter it is generally warm, but may get cool at night. The climate is very dry with almost no rain at all and very few cloudy days. The best time to visit is in winter, from November to the beginning of March. The transition from winter to summer is abrupt, so there is no real spring or autumn. The prevailing wind is quite weak, but is persistently northerly. As a result the weather is predictable. By and large, there is little variation day to day. More basic accommodation often will not have reversible air conditioning, nor much insulation. As a result, accommodation can feel decidedly cold in winter, even though outdoors, the daytime temperature might be quite pleasant.\n\n## By plane\n25.67083332.7063891 Luxor International Airport (LXR  IATA) (6 km east of the city). Facilities for passengers include a post office, a bank, ATM, a Bureau de change, restaurants, cafeterias, a VIP Lounge, a duty-free shop, a newsagent/tobacconist, a chemist shop, a gift shop, a travel agency, a tourist help desk, car rental.      (updated Dec 2018)\nLuxor airport receives direct flights from several European cities, with most being inclusive package holidays, but they are often available to book flight only. There are also direct flights from the Gulf states. Egyptair and competitors fly frequently and direct from Cairo (1 hr), with day-trips feasible both ways, and good connections to Europe. Reaching Luxor from Alexandria or Sharm el-Sheik usually involves changing in Cairo, sometimes with lengthy stopovers. Most of the Airlines in Egypt including: Nile Air, ALMasria Universal Airlines, Air Arabia and Petroleum Air Services (PAS), which charter services flights to Cairo or Egyptian destinations, including Hurghada etc.\nThere are no public buses between the airport and the city centre. If you do not have a shuttle provided by your hotel, take a taxi, which should cost no more than LE60-80. Ignore the picket of taxi drivers and touts just outside the airport doors. Keep walking until you find a taxi driver in his car and then negotiate. Keep a firm grip on your luggage as people will helpfully wrench it from you, carry it most of 5 m to the taxi & bus stand, then demand a fee. \"Lah shukran, lah shukran...\": you will be saying that a lot in Luxor.\nIf coming in from another country, visas on arrival are available to many foreign nationals, just after you enter the terminal building leaving the plane. It is US$25 or equivalent, with most major foreign currencies accepted. Also, see Egypt#Get in.\n\n## By train\n25.6964532.644642 Luxor railway station (محطة الأقصر). Luxor is on the railway mainline that follows the Nile north to Cairo (10 hr) and south to Aswan (3-4 hr). The train is a pleasant way to travel between Aswan and Luxor; however, since 2022 prices were drastically increased for foreigners and you can expect to pay European prices for your ticket. For practical details see \"Egypt#Get around by train\".     (updated Apr 2021)\nDaytime expresses have 1st and 2nd class air-conditioned coaches called AC1 and AC2 with comfortable aircraft-style seats. They are a relaxing way to sit back and view the lush landscape of the Nile valley. Soft drinks and snacks are served, and there may be a dining car, but best buy food and drinks beforehand.\nOvernight expresses, departing 9PM to 11PM, are identical to the daytime trains and have the same fares; they are not sleepers.\nDeluxe sleepers are run by a private company, Watania. These have modern air-conditioned sleeping-cars, with a choice of 1- and 2-berth cabins and a club/lounge car. An evening meal and breakfast are included in the fare. One sleeper runs nightly year-round, southbound from Cairo Ramses around 8PM, and northbound from Luxor around 11PM. Extra sleepers run at busy times but note that these train may commence from Giza rather than from Cairo Ramses station.\nLocal trains - Non-a/c trains lumber between Cairo and Luxor, daytime and overnight, stopping at most stations - some commence in Alexandria. These are not much slower, but they are incredibly cheap.\nMost of these trains continue to Aswan (and since they have started from Cairo, are often late leaving Luxor). The expresses are run by Egyptian National Railways (ENR). ENR also runs the ordinary trains but these are not bookable and not shown on timetables, buy your ticket at the station. The deluxe sleepers should be booked online with Abela Trains.\n\n## By bus\n25.6977132.644983 Go Bus Stop stop (the Station is just north from the railway station main entrance in Luxor). To Hurghada at 8AM for LE230 and 2:30PM for LE320.    (updated Dec 2022)\n25.69605832.6443354 SuperJet stop. Rather simple intercity buses with A/C. Reliable service. To Hurghada at 8:30AM for LE125. It's non-stop with just a 15-min break on the way. To Cairo for LE230 with a stop in Qena and Giza.    (updated Dec 2022)\nBuses leave regularly from behind Luxor Temple, to most major cities. GoBus and SuperJet depart from somewhat different locations near the train station.\n\n## By boat\nAn essential way of getting between the East and West banks of Luxor is to use a boat. The blue local ferry is a very basic boat between East and West that costs LE20 for foreigners (as of October 2025). The downside is that the ferry only leaves when it is full, or when another ferry arrives, so taking the ferry is in general slower although you avoid the haggling. Nevertheless, during the day ferries departs often enough not to waste your time. Taxis are available at the ferry terminal on both sides, and the trip takes just a few minutes.\nOtherwise, motorboat launches (often called \"lunches\") will take you around, e.g. from the Winter Palace Hotel to the East Bank ferry dock—as of October 2025, LE80-100 for one or two people (you will likely be asked for more, so haggling is appropriate).\nAs you walk by the river, dozens of felucca owners will also offer you their services to haul you over the river, and normally a taxi driver will be on standby on the other side.\n\n## By e-hailing\nUber doesn't work in Luxor, but its sister app Careem does. It takes card payments, and saves you having to explain your destination or negotiate with the driver. InDrive also works in Luxor.\n\n## By bicycle\nLuxor is brimming with rental shops for bikes and a great many hotels also hire out bicycles. Rental rates are about maximum 5USD (June 2025), depending on your bargaining skills, the relative demand on bikes that day and the quality of the bike in question. Check the tires and be wary of last minute inflating as they may deflate just as fast. It is normal to be asked to leave behind your passport, drivers licence or student ID card as a deposit. Bikes can be rented on both the East and West Banks of Luxor (the latter near the local ferry landing), though prices can be a little over-inflated on the more isolated West. If you look for high quality bicycles, you can find Dutch bikes (gazelle/batavus) at the Dutch Rental Agency in Sheraton Street (East Bank) and, on the West Bank, at Mohammed Setohe bicycle (5 min walk from the ferry) which has quit good and almost brand new mountains bikes. Bikes can be taken on board the local ferry (be considerate though), so perhaps hire on the East, then transport your bike over yourself. Watch Egyptian traffic before deciding if you want to ride a bike through it.\nThe East Bank is the metropolitan side, so consider the traffic and crowds while deciding whether to bike on that side. The West bank in contrast is much more rural, and many tourists opt to bicycle among the fields here while getting themselves between the tourist sites.\nAt the sites, guards will try to convince you to avoid locking your bicycle as they will watch it. Which they will do very well, and then demand a tip for having done so. Lock your bike yourself to avoid this unnecessary expense.\n\n## By motorcycle\nFor the even more brave, Luxor is brimming with Chinese motorcycles around 150cc. With the right bargaining skills you can net one for LE50 per hour, or less for the day or evening. In the summer, the roads around the West Bank are relatively empty, and motorcycling around the ruins and mountains is easy and efficient. In a slow season, many are willing to rent you their own motorcycle for the right price. Ask for a helmet -- you won't get one otherwise.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis are plentiful in Luxor. They have no meters, but there are current rates that are accepted if you stay firm. Short trips within Luxor are between LE15 and LE25 (first offer from taxi driver will inevitably be LE50 or more). A round trip to the West Bank is about LE100.\nThe Sheraton Luxor Resort has a list of current (overpriced) taxi rates from their hotel to a number of destinations that can be used as a handy reference.\n\n## By minibus\nMinibuses are the transportation of the locals in Luxor, and the cheapest way to get around for the adventurous tourist. They all have the same shape so are easily recognized. They have fixed routes, with different routes marked by a different colour on the side of the minibus. However there are no maps of the routes, the locals know them by heart. Almost all bus routes converge at the railway station. Hail a bus by looking at it while it is approaching, and raise your arm. When the bus is full it will not stop (there are about 14 seats in a bus). Otherwise you can jump in, take an empty seat, and pass money to the driver, a flat LE 3.0 per person (as of Dec 2023) for a ride (no haggling required). When you do not pay while you sit down, they will assume you do not know the price and the driver will charge you LE 3.50 when you get off. Getting off is possible anytime, and is done by simply asking the driver to stop.\n\n## By calèche\nCalèches, or horse-drawn carriages, are common on the east bank and are a delightful way to see the city, especially at night-time. Prices vary according to bargaining skill, but LE20 per hour seems common.\nHowever, a number of animal rights groups have advised against calèches due to the poor treatment of the horses. It is not uncommon for drivers to beat their horses, and most Western tourists will notice many skinny and scarred animals. This does not mean that all drivers are to be avoided, some are reputable. Use common sense when choosing.\nBeware of using the same driver for several days in a row. At the end he may decide he has undercharged you in some way for previous trips and may ask for a lot more for things which weren't included, such as waiting around while you visited a temple, all the money paid before went to the boss and none to your driver, a tip for the horse, in the original price. It might be best to use a different driver each trip and not book a driver you've used before to avoid this possible scenario from happening even if he does seem more pleasant than most to start.\n\n## On foot\nIt is also possible to travel around the tourist district on foot during the cooler parts of the day, provided you have a good sense of direction. To avoid unwanted attention you will need to constantly repeat the words \"no hassle\", or \"laa, shukran\", which means \"no, thank you\" in Arabic. Also, be prepared to yell out for the Tourist Police if you have any concerns for your safety. There are usually always some policemen nearby since they may be also wearing civilian clothes.\nA good tactic for avoiding hassle is to buy an Egyptian paper each day (in Arabic) and carry this with you. Locals will assume that you know Arabic (and therefore their tricks) and leave you alone. Egyptian papers cost around LE1.\n\n## See\nThe Luxor district article pages contain detailed information and suggestions for things to see. Highlights include:\nThe temple complex of Luxor\nThe temple complex of Karnak\nLuxor and Mummification museums\nThe Valley of the Kings\nMedinet Habu\nThe Tombs of the Nobles\nThe Ramesseum Temple\nDeir el-Bahari of Queen Hatshepsut\nColossi of Memnon\nMalkata\nHot Air Balloon Rides\n\n## Do\nHire a bicycle and ride around Ancient Thebes, which takes less than 15 minutes.\nA local felucca ride just before sunset; shouldn't cost you more than about LE30 (for one person) per hour.\nTake a felucca cruise on the Nile for a 2-day trip to Aswan (the reverse trip is recommended, however, due to river currents).\nBook a cruise ship for 2-3 nights between Luxor and Aswan by tracking down one or several of them along the pier before noon. Most cruise ships have a reception at their entrance and you can just walk in. Do not mind the guards or barriers, they are just there for protection. According to some, prices can start at US$40 per night, and this will be cheaper than when going through an agent or booking online.\nHire a donkey, horse or camel to ride around Luxor's West Bank.\nPharaoh's Stables (just a short walk from the ferry terminal). +20 10 6324961. They will take you to places where the big coaches can't go. They have horses for beginners to experienced riders. The sunset ride and nile ride seems like a must do.\nSwim in a hotel’s pool after a dusty day of tombs and temples:\nIberotel: LE75\nSonesta: LE50\nLotus: LE50\nOne next to St Joseph Hotel on Khaled Ebn El-Waled Street: LE25\nIberotel: LE75\nSonesta: LE50\nLotus: LE50\nOne next to St Joseph Hotel on Khaled Ebn El-Waled Street: LE25\nHot air balloon rides. A tour in the morning for sunrise or evening for sunset. Also, be sure to know what is included and what not. Sunset tours do generally not include the sunset, supposedly depending on the wind, which is what they are used to say every day. It is still an impressive and inexpensive ride, even without sunrise. Each flight lasts at least 45 minutes, weather permitting.Nevertheless, pay attention to the safety record mentioned on Wikipedia, which is bad supposedly. This is not a romantic ride with only a few people: they often cramp 21 people into the basket. LE950-1,900, ask around (accommodation and travel offices) for the best deal.   (updated Nov 2019)\nIberotel: LE75\nSonesta: LE50\nLotus: LE50\nOne next to St Joseph Hotel on Khaled Ebn El-Waled Street: LE25\n\n## Buy\nThere are at least two different markets in Luxor. One is located in an air-conditioned hall, with shops located on either side of the hall. This market hall connects two major streets.\nThe older market takes up several streets near the Luxor temple. It is a joy to walk through, as it is mostly pedestrian and is a welcome respite from the horse and carriages on the main streets. This market really feels like an old souk and the visitor is taken back in time. It is covered with a wooden trellis, shading people from the sun. Many of the shops offer the same items, so the wise buyer shops around and looks for the best price. One can often bargain better after going to several stores.\nOnce you find a merchant you like, sit down, have some tea and begin the game of bargaining. It can feel like you are becoming a part of the family. Buying something as simple as a cotton galabeya can take hours, as you try on almost every single galabeya in the store, and then move on to items that they think you may want for the rest of your family.\nBuying anything may be very frustrating due to constant bargaining if you are not used to it. This trick has proven to work well: usually their first offer for the price can be ten or even a hundred times bigger than a reasonable price. First decide what you are actually willing to pay. Let us say that in this example it is LE20. If you ask for the price, you may get a reply \"LE120\". Now you offer LE22. You may then be offered something like LE110. Then instead of going up, you start going down with the price, your new offer will be only LE20 (your predefined price limit). If the bargaining continues you continue dropping your offer. Pretty soon he will understand where the bargaining is going and you get a comfortable price, or you get rid of the vendor.\nThe touting in the main Souq in Luxor is so bad that it is an absolute nightmare walking through it. Any desire you had to buy anything will quickly disappear as dozens of men try every possible catch they have on you. These include: \"You look lucky\", \"you look Egyptian\", \"come see my shop, no hassle,\" and guessing your nationality. But if you continue straight forward, you will come to the real Souq, where the locals go shopping, and the atmosphere changes completely.\n\n## Eat\nLuxor is a vegetarian's paradise with lots of fresh seasonal vegetables such as tomato and cucumber.\nA meal often begins with pita-bread and mezze such as baba ganoush or taboulé.\nYour main course may include meat or poultry, or regional dishes such as pigeon or rabbit. (To avoid an upset stomach, you may prefer to stick with the beef.) As with any heavily touristed area in Egypt, it is never hard to find reasonably well-executed Western food.\nDairy products, such as yoghurt or gibna bayda cheese (like feta but creamier), might accompany your main meal.\nFinally, many good vegetarian desserts are available, though some might seem overly sweet to western tastes. (If you can, specify low or medium sweetness.)\nWhile the evening meal is often filling, you may find this does not meet the energy requirements of a busy tourist. It is advisable to eat a hearty breakfast, drink lots of water and snack frequently during the day.\nLuxor, East Bank\nLuxor, West Bank\n\n## Drink\nThere is something of a social stigma attached to public drunkenness. Although Egyptians themselves sometimes choose to ignore this, for a foreigner to be drunk in public can give a bad impression. Most local pubs tend to be testosterone-filled hard-drinking dens where lone foreigners and especially lone women may feel uncomfortable.\nHowever, there are numerous places in Luxor to buy alcohol. Many restaurants, above the basic on the street places, sell lager and wine. They are generally made obvious by Stella signs outside or by having people drinking inside them.\nThere are two open-air restaurants opposite the temple about 200 m south of the main entrance which serve Stella lager for LE14 including tax (as of September 2011) and other local beer and wine for fairly reasonable prices. The huge Stella signs outside give them away. If you can not find somewhere convenient serving alcohol, it may be an idea to ask the staff in your hotel for directions. 'Cafeteria' can be the euphemistic name for a pub in Egypt, and pubs can be quite hard to find if you do not know exactly where to go.\nThere is a duty-free shop close to the north end of the Luxor Temple, slightly to the right across the busy junction. It has plastic see-through shutters at its windows and a guard outside. If you take your passport and go within two days of arriving in Egypt, up to three bottles of main-name spirits and beer, etc. at reduced prices, per person, can be bought. After the two days you can only buy the Egyptian equivalent. They also sell electrical products, and close at 10PM.\nDrinking in the street or in parks, although fairly widely done by locals, is not recommended for foreigners as it is illegal and alcohol is generally cheap enough in restaurants anyway.\n\n## Sleep\nLuxor has an extremely wide variety of accommodation options, from camping and hostels, right up to 5-star luxury hotels like the Old Winter Palace Hotel which is of extreme opulence and has played host to both movie stars and heads of state. Luxor probably has the greatest seasonal variation in hotel rates in Egypt, with some hotels being up to 50% cheaper (or more) in the low season (summer). Others do not change their prices.\nWhilst the vast majority of accommodation options are to be found on the East Bank, an increasing number are to be found (and are being developed), however, on the more laid-back and isolated West Bank, close to the tombs and the Valley of the Kings. A lengthy stay in the area might benefit from staying on both sides of the river for some time.\nIf you are arriving in Luxor by train or bus, beware the over-friendly and sometimes pushy hotel touts, especially at the station (these guys are a symptom of the sometimes fierce competition between rival hotels, especially at quiet times). Remember you do not owe them anything, but that they get 25-40% commission for convincing you to stay at their \"cousin's\" or \"brother's\" hotel, which is then added to your final bill. It is usually best to pre-book accommodation. Also, use a map or a taxi to find your hotel and discourage attempts to guide you to your hotel, as you may end up somewhere else altogether, in the expectation that you will give in and stay where your \"guide\" has led you after all.\nWomen travelling without company should exercise extreme caution whilst seeking budget accommodation in Luxor. Several reports have been made of sexual assault after women were given spiked drinks by hotel touts and staff.\nOn your first morning in Luxor, you may be woken at dawn by the adhan, or Muslim call to prayer. This normally lasts 5–10 minutes, and after a few days you will find yourself sleeping through it.\n\n## Connect\nSee the various Luxor district pages for details of telephone, internet and postal services - being a major tourist town, Luxor is extremely well-served with communication facilities.\nMost of the best outlets are to be found where the bulk of the local population lives, in the East Bank of Luxor.\nLuxor telephone number format is +20 95 2xxx xxx, while on the West Bank +20 95 2060xxx.\n\n## Visa extension\n25.68747232.631931 Luxor Passport Office (south of Luxor town centre, virtually opposite the Isis Hotel). Sa-Th 8AM-4PM. You must submit your passport, 2 pictures, copies of your passport (including entrance stamps), and LE1,100 fee before 11AM. Your passport will be returned at about 2PM the same day. Sometimes they might request additional documents like notarised rental contract and extend waiting time up to a month. At any rate, visa extensions are far easier to acquire at this office than in Cairo; acquiring it in Hurghada would be the easiest of all of them.    (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Stay safe\nStay alert – For those not on fully organised tours, touts can make sight seeing very frustrating. (Although they tend not to stray into the actual temples.) However within temples, one must contend with the government tour guides. The guides are legitimate government workers, but also extremely aggressive about \"guiding you\" and then demanding a tip. Rule of thumb: If anyone shows you anything, for any amount of time, they will want a tip. It may be worthwhile to give a small tip upfront while asking to \"self tour\".\nIt is wise to know which accommodation you are heading to and where, or just pre-book accommodation. Otherwise, you will have to deal with the touts at the station.\nAs tourism is the main source of income in Luxor, and has been for centuries, many people have made scamming into an art form. You should assume that any statement from someone who comes up to you out of nowhere is a lie. Some of the older tricks in the book:\nThe \"I need a letter translated\" opener, used to draw you into a shop\nThe \"I need a letter writing to my friend in your country\" opener (they show you an address that is in your country), again used to draw you into a shop\nThe alabaster factory. A large percentage of alabaster is imported, and is hardly made on site. The vast majority of other stones such as jade are imported from China and India.\n\"The temple is closed\"- Check opening times before you arrive. Find out on your own whether something is open or closed, whether you are walking the right way or not. Ask a local, not taxi or caleche driver. The main temples all maintain the same basic hours and rarely, if ever, have closures, as conservation/excavation work is almost always done while they are open, with just one area sealed off. The tombs in the Valley of the Kings are a different matter, but the main ticket office at the entrance has a sign showing which individual tombs are open and closed on any given day.\nPapyrus Museum - it is just a papyrus shop, some are good but some are cheap imitations.\nScarf seller - person selling usually just one scarf will attempt to use it to hide their hand movements while they pick pocket you.\nThe \"I know you from the cruise ship.\" opener.\nThe \"Excuse me, where are you from?\" opener.\nWomen travelling without company should exercise extreme caution whilst seeking budget accommodation. There have been several reports of sexual assault after women were given spiked drinks by hotel touts and staff. Always check your room to make sure the door has a secure lock that can't be opened from the outside, and check for spy holes (this is actually a thing in some places). Staff in some shops will also on occasion harass or grope women who aren't with a male travel companion. If you are travelling with a male travel companion, consider pretending to be husband and wife, even if you aren't. This will avoid some of these problems.\nMerchants in Luxor are notoriously aggressive and manipulative. If you do not want to be talked into buying anything, it is wise to completely ignore any attempt by a local to strike up conversation, no matter how benign it may seem. In shops and the market, the phrase \"No Hassle\" can often be used to avoid unwanted attention. If you would like to be polite, it is also appropriate to say \"Laa shukran\", meaning ‘no thanks’ in Arabic. Being polite will make your life easier, as people will remember you if you were rude and may hassle more later. If problems persist, threaten to call the tourist police with the phrase \"You're a hustler!\"\nOn the streets, you may find it easier to feign ignorance of English: \"Non Speakee Engleezee\" and/or \"Non Parlee Arabee\" seems to be the most reliable way to show you are not interested in their offers. This technique can however backfire quite spectacularly as most Egyptians speak several languages, so if pressed claim to speak something obscure like Azerbaijani or Ossetic. If you do speak an uncommon language such as Persian or Albanian or an Eastern European language, make sure you start talking to them in that language. If you do not, practice faking it and do so in their presence. This is the fastest and easiest way to get rid of the touts. Otherwise, just don't engage at all.\nDepending upon the perception your profile creates, you may be asked, sometimes within minutes of exiting your hotel, if you would like to purchase drugs or sex. Remember, prostitution and drug use are not taken lightly by government authorities. For gay visitors, extreme care should be taken when propositioned by a sex worker. Egypt has a well documented record of gay men being caught in entrapment schemes.\n\n## Go next\nDendera — Luxor is a good base to visit this site of a fantastically well-preserved Ptolemaic temple of Hathor. A number of hotels organise day-trips, and you don't need to be staying with them to use these services. However, it can also easily be reached by taxi or, even cheaper, by (local) train to Qena and local taxi from there.\nFor those with more time on their hands you can add a visit to the Temple of Seti I at Abydos, featuring some of the best relief work in Egypt. This is a lengthy road trip from Luxor, but can be combined with a day trip to Dendera.\nThe city is also a good staging post for onward travel through Upper Egypt and on to Aswan and Abu Simbel.",
