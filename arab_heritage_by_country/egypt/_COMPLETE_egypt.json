          "content": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Cairo is derived from the Arabic al-Qāhirah (القاهرة), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Its full, formal name was al-Qāhirah al-Mu'izziyyah (القاهرة المعزيّة), meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'. It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, known in Arabic by names such as an-Najm al-Qāhir (النجم القاهر, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding.\nEgyptians often refer to Cairo as Maṣr (IPA: [mɑsˤɾ]; مَصر), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasising the city's importance for the country.\nThere are a number of Coptic names for the city. Tikešrōmi (Coptic: Ϯⲕⲉϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ Late Coptic: [dikɑʃˈɾoːmi]) is attested in the 1211 text The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' (Ϯ-, 'the', ⲕⲁϣ-, 'to break', and ⲣⲱⲙⲓ, 'man'), akin to Arabic al-Qāhirah, or a derivation from Arabic قَصْر الرُوم (qaṣr ar-rūm, \"the Roman castle\"), another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo. The Arabic name is also calqued as ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ϯⲣⲉϥϭⲣⲟ, \"the victor city\" in the Coptic antiphonary.\nThe form Khairon (Coptic: ⲭⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ) is attested in the modern Coptic text Ⲡⲓⲫⲓⲣⲓ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉ ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ ⲙ̀ⲙⲏⲓ Ⲃⲉⲣⲏⲛⲁ (The Tale of Saint Verina). Lioui (Ⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [lɪˈjuːj]) or Elioui (Ⲉⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [ælˈjuːj]) is another name which is descended from the Greek name of Heliopolis (Ήλιούπολις). Some argue that Mistram (Ⲙⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈmɪstəɾɑm]) or Nistram (Ⲛⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈnɪstəɾɑm]) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it is rather a name for the Abbasid province capital al-Askar. Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲏ (Kahi•ree) is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being Ⲕⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ [Kairon] and Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲁ [Kahira]) which is modern folk etymology meaning 'land of sun'. Some argue that it was  the name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory. Cairo is also referred to as Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ (Late Coptic: [ˈkɪmi]) or Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ (Late Coptic: [ˈɡɪpdos]), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\nSometimes the city is informally referred to as Cairo by people from Alexandria (IPA: [ˈkæjɾo]; Egyptian Arabic: كايرو).\n\nHistory\nAncient settlements\nThe area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions (roughly Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt), which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant. Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south west of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the modern districts of Matariya and Ain Shams in northeastern Cairo. It was largely destroyed by the Persian invasions in 525 BC and 343 BC and partly abandoned by the late first century BC.\nHowever, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD. Around the turn of the fourth century, as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a large fortress along the east bank of the Nile. The fortress, called Babylon, was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian (r. 285–305) at the entrance of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea that was created earlier by Emperor Trajan (r. 98–117). Further north of the fortress, near the present-day district of al-Azbakiya, was a port and fortified outpost known as Tendunyas (Coptic: ϯⲁⲛⲧⲱⲛⲓⲁⲥ) or Umm Dunayn. While no structures older than the 7th century have been preserved in the area aside from the Roman fortifications, historical evidence suggests that a sizeable city existed. The city was important enough that its bishop, Cyrus, participated in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.\nThe Byzantine-Sassanian War between 602 and 628 caused great hardship and likely caused much of the urban population to leave for the countryside, leaving the settlement partly deserted. The site today remains at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (from the late 7th or early 8th century), are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo.\n\nFustat and other early Islamic settlements\nThe Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt was led by Amr ibn al-As from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of Alexandria, the Egyptian capital at the time, he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress. The city, known as Fustat (Arabic: الفسطاط, romanised: al-Fusṭāṭ, lit. 'the tent'), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt. Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and André Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat. \nThe choice of founding a new settlement at this inland location, instead of using the existing capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, may have been due to the new conquerors' strategic priorities. One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient canal in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to Medina, the capital of the caliphate in Arabia. Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).\n\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as al-Askar (Arabic: العسكر, lit. 'the camp') as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786. The Red Sea canal re-excavated in the 7th century was closed by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), but a part of the canal, known as the Khalij, continued to be a major feature of Cairo's geography and of its water supply until the 19th century. In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, a Nilometer was built on Roda Island near Fustat. Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\n\nIn 868, a commander of Turkic origin named Bakbak was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'taz to restore order after a rebellion in the country. He was accompanied by his stepson, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who became effective governor of Egypt. Over time, Ibn Tulun gained an army and accumulated influence and wealth, allowing him to become the de facto independent ruler of both Egypt and Syria by 878. In 870, he used his growing wealth to found a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i (Arabic: القطائـع, lit. 'the allotments'), to the northeast of Fustat and of al-Askar. \nThe new city included a palace known as the Dar al-Imara, a parade ground known as al-Maydan, a bimaristan (hospital), and an aqueduct to supply water. Between 876 and 879 Ibn Tulun built a great mosque, now known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, at the center of the city, next to the palace. After his death in 884, Ibn Tulun was succeeded by his son and his descendants who continued a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids. In 905, the Abbasids sent general Muhammad Sulayman al-Katib to re-assert direct control over the country. Tulunid rule was ended and al-Qatta'i was razed to the ground, except for the mosque which remains standing today.\n\nFoundation and expansion of Cairo under the Fatimids\nIn 969, the Fatimid Caliphate conquered Egypt after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah instructed his courtier and general Jawhar al-Saqili to establish a new fortified city northeast of Fustat and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah, which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books. When Caliph al-Mu'izz arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, Qāhirat al-Mu'izz (\"The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz\"), from which the name \"Cairo\" (al-Qāhira) originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish palace complex that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier (1073–1094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city. Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today.\nDuring the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile. Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people. They may have been similar to Roman insulae and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and Ottoman periods. However, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier Shawar set fire to the unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by Amalric, the Crusader king of Jerusalem. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\n\nWhile the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'Āḍid. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel. These construction projects continued beyond Saladin's lifetime and were completed under his Ayyubid successors.\n\nFurther expansion and decline under the Ayyubids and Mamluks\nIn 1250, during the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of al-Salih and power transitioned instead to the Mamluks, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, Shajar ad-Durr, who ruled for a brief period around this time. Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the Mamluk Sultanate passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260) and for eliminating the last Crusader states in the Levant.\nDespite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341, with interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\nMulti-story buildings occupied by rental apartments, known as a rab' (plural ribā' or urbu), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period. These apartments were often laid out as multi-story duplexes or triplexes. They were sometimes attached to caravanserais, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The oldest partially-preserved example of this type of structure is the Wikala of Amir Qawsun, built before 1341. Residential buildings were in turn organised into close-knit neighbourhoods called a harat, which in many cases had gates that could be closed off at night or during disturbances.\n\nWhen the traveller Ibn Battuta first came to Cairo in 1326, he described it as the principal district of Egypt. When he passed through the area again on his return journey in 1348, the Black Death was ravaging most major cities. He cited reports of thousands of deaths per day in Cairo. Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. \nDuring its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412. It was nonetheless in this period that the largest Mamluk-era religious monument, the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, was built. In the late 14th century, the Burji Mamluks replaced the Bahri Mamluks as rulers of the Mamluk state, but the Mamluk system continued to decline.\nThough the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration. More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness. Its economy and politics also became more deeply connected with the wider Mediterranean. Some Mamluk sultans in this period, such as Barbsay (r. 1422–1438) and Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496), had relatively long and successful reigns. After al-Nasir Muhammad, Qaytbay was one of the most prolific patrons of art and architecture of the Mamluk era. He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt. The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay. The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\n\nOttoman rule\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517. Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital. For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of Yemeni coffee and Indian textiles, primarily to Anatolia, North Africa, and the Balkans. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren Hejaz, especially during the annual hajj to Mecca. It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of Islamic scholars. The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c. 1557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople. The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Geniza.\n\nUnder the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel. The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean. Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.\nThe French occupation was short-lived as British and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable Albanian contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801. The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened Mamluks jostling for control of the country. Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named Muhammad Ali Pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually, with the approval of the religious establishment, viceroy of Egypt in 1805.\n\nModern era\nUntil his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition. Isma'il also sought to modernise the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.\nThe immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the British invasion in 1882. The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il. Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\nIn 1906, the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. In 1905–1907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood. In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.\n\nThe British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate. Nevertheless, this led to Egypt's independence in 1922.\nThe King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad. The goal of the government of the newly formed Kingdom of Egypt was not to delegitimise the other variant Quranic texts (\"qira'at\"), but to eliminate errors found in Qur'anic texts used in state schools. A committee of teachers chose to preserve a single one of the canonical qira'at \"readings\", namely that of the \"Ḥafṣ\" version, an 8th-century Kufic recitation. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran for much of the Islamic world. The publication has been called a \"terrific success\", and the edition has been described as one \"now widely seen as the official text of the Qur'an\", so popular among both Sunni and Shi'a that the common belief among less well-informed Muslims is \"that the Qur'an has a single, unambiguous reading\". Minor amendments were made later in 1924 and in 1936 - the \"Faruq edition\" in honour of then ruler, King Faruq.\n\nBritish occupation until 1956\nBritish troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis. Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million—and its area increased from 10 to 163 km2 (4 to 63 sq mi).\nThe city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Tahrir Square and the Nile Corniche, and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.\n\nAfter 1956\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Cairo continued to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006, the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269. The population explosion also drove the rise of \"informal\" housing ('ashwa'iyyat), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control. The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo. According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.\nThe \"formal\" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of Madinat Nasr, a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s. Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land. These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods. As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\nConcurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city. In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n\n2011 Egyptian revolution\nCairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. More than 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nDespite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.\n\nPost-revolutionary Cairo\nUnder the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\n\nGeography\nCairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 km (100 mi) south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 km (75 mi) west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal. The city lies along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 km2 (175 sq mi). Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\nUntil the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the Mokattam highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of Geziret al-Fil is occupied by the Shubra district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes Zamalek and Gezira. Land reclamation efforts by the Mamluks and Ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.\nBecause of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. \nThe Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\nNorthern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate. Giza city has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today has a population of 2.7 million. The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\n\nClimate\nIn Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate (BWh according to the Köppen climate classification system).\nWind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. Winters are mild to warm, while summers are long and hot. High temperatures in winter range from 14 to 22 °C (57 to 72 °F), while night-time lows drop to below 11 °C (52 °F), often to 5 °C (41 °F). In summer, the highs often exceed 31 °C (88 °F) but rarely surpass 40 °C (104 °F), and lows drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its proximity to the Mediterranean coast. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades. Dew points in the hottest months range from 13.9 °C (57 °F) in June to 18.3 °C (65 °F) in August.\n\nMetropolitan area and districts\nThe city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa. While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza Governorate, and Qalyubia Governorate. As a contiguous metropolitan area, various studies have considered Greater Cairo be composed of the administrative cities that are Cairo, Giza and Shubra al-Kheima, in addition to the satellite cities/new towns surrounding them.\nCairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra administrative division between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas (manatiq, singl. mantiqa) divided into 38 districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):\nThe Northern Area is divided into 8 Districts:\n\nShubra\nAl-Zawiya al-Hamra\nHadayek al-Qubba\nRod al-Farg\nAl-Sharabia\nAl-Sahel\nAl-Zeitoun\nAl-Amiriyya\n\nThe Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts and three new cities:\n\nMisr al-Gadidah and Al-Nozha (Heliopolis)\nNasr City East and Nasr City West\nAl-Salam 1 (Awwal) and al-Salam 2 (Than)\nAin Shams\nAl-Matariya\nAl-Marg\nShorouk (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nBadr (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nAl-Qahira al-Gadida (New Cairo, three qisms, under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nThe Western Area divided into 9 Districts:\n\nManshiyat Nasser\nAl-Wayli (Incl. qism al-Daher)\nWasat al-Qahira (Central Cairo, incl. Al-Darb al-Ahmar, al-Gamaliyya qisms)\nBulaq\nGharb al-Qahira (West Cairo, incl. Zamalek qism, Qasr al-Nil qism incl. Garden City and part of Down Town)\nAbdeen\nAl-Azbakiya\nAl-Muski\nBab al-Sha'aria\n\nThe Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:\n\nMasr El-Qadima (Old Cairo, including Al-Manial)\nAl-Khalifa\nAl-Moqattam\nAl-Basatin\nDar al-Salam\nSayyidah Zainab District\nEl Tebbin\nHelwan\nAl-Ma'sara\nAl-Maadi\nTora\n15th of May (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nSatellite cities\nSince 1977 a number of new towns have been planned and built by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) in the Eastern Desert around Cairo, ostensibly  to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: 15th of May City, Badr City, Shorouk City, and New Cairo. In addition, two more are under construction: the New Administrative Capital. And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.\n\nPlanned new capital\nIn March 2015, plans were announced for a new city to be built east of Cairo, in an undeveloped area of the Cairo Governorate, which would serve as the New Administrative Capital of Egypt. Cairo also introduced more modern metro lines to reduce traffic in central areas.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census, Cairo had a population of 9,539,673 people, distributed across 46 qisms (police wards):\n\nReligion\nThe majority of Egypt and Cairo's population is Sunni Muslim. A significant Christian minority exists, among whom Coptic Orthodox are the majority. Precise numbers for each religious community in Egypt are not available and estimates vary. Other churches that have, or had, a presence in modern Cairo include the Catholic Church (including Armenian Catholic, Coptic Catholic, Chaldean Catholic, Syrian Catholic, and Maronite), the Greek Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), and some Protestant churches. Cairo has been the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church since the 12th century, and the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope is located in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Until the 20th century, Cairo had a sizeable Jewish community, but as of 2022 only three Jews were reported to be living in the city. A total of 12 synagogues in Cairo still exist.\n\nEconomy\nCairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing – specifically the production of sugar cane. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world.\nCairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.\nThis growth until recently surged well ahead of city services. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like \"hyper-urbanization\".\n\nAutomobile manufacturers from Cairo\nArab American Vehicles Company (vehicles by Stellantis alliance)\nEgyptian Light Transport Manufacturing Company (Egyptian NSU pedant)\nGhabbour Group (Fuso, Hyundai and Volvo)\nMCV Corporate Group (a part of the Daimler AG)\nMod Car\nSeoudi Group (Modern Motors: Nissan, BMW (formerly); El-Mashreq: Alfa Romeo and Fiat)\nSperanza (former Daewoo Motors Egypt; Chery, Daewoo)\nGeneral Motors Egypt\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth\nCairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of medical care in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the JCI-accredited As-Salaam International Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Dar Al Fouad, Nile Badrawi Hospital, 57357 Hospital, as well as Qasr El Eyni Hospital.\n\nEducation\nGreater Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.\nToday, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the Egyptian educational system, has the largest number of educational schools, and higher education institutes among other cities and governorates of Egypt.\nSome of the International Schools found in Cairo:\n\nUniversities in Greater Cairo:\n\nTransport\nCairo has an extensive road network, rail system, subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses. Cairo International Airport is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.\n\nPublic transportation\nCairo, specifically Ramses Station, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network. The Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit and runs the Cairo Metro. The metro network covers Helwan and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during rush hour. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want. Trams in Greater Cairo and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution. In 2022, the Cairo Light Rail Transit system opened. Despite the name, the CLRT is more like a commuter rail system than a Light Rail system. As of 2025, the system consists of a single bifurcating line of 12 stations over 70 km, with a top speed of 12p km/h. In 2017, plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking 6th of October to suburban Giza, a distance of 35 km (22 mi), and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of 52 km (32 mi).\n\nRoads\nTwo trans-African automobile routes originate in Cairo: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Cairo-Dakar Highway. An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new Ring Road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the 6th October Bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.\nCairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded. Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas.\n\nOther forms of transport\nBolt\nCairo Nile Ferry\nCairo Taxi/Yellow Cab\nCareem\nDiDi\nUber\n\nCulture\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nCairo Opera House\nPresident Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations.\n\nKhedivial Opera House\nThe Khedivial Opera House, or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\n\nCairo International Film Festival\nCairo held its first international film festival 16 August 1976, when the first Cairo International Film Festival was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.\nThis achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the FIAPF with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.\nIn 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, Hussein Fahmy, who was appointed by the Minister of Culture, Farouk Hosni, after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.\n\nCairo Geniza\nThe Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the Ben Ezra Synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the University of Cambridge runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\nSports\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues, most notably Al Ahly and Zamalek SC, who were the CAF first and second African clubs of the 20th century. The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football. They play their home games at Cairo International Stadium, which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo.\nThe Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960. Its multi-purpose sports complex houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, satellite fields that hold regional and continental games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. Egypt later won the competition and the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only to win the African Nations Cup back to back. Egypt won the title for a record six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola in 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. As of 2021, Egypt's national team is ranked #46 in the world by FIFA.\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Beijing. However, Cairo did host the 2007 Pan Arab Games.\nThere are other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including Gezira Sporting Club, el Shams Club, Shooting Club, Heliopolis Sporting Club, and several smaller clubs. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's downtown), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.\nMost of the sports federations of the country are located in the city suburbs, including the Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in 6 October City, a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts. In 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the International Rugby Board.\nEgypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in professional and junior divisions. Egypt has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year. Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been the women's world number one. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship. In 2017 she retained her title.\nCairo is the official endpoint of Cross Egypt Challenge where its route ends yearly in the most sacred place in Egypt, under the Great Pyramids of Giza with a huge trophy-giving ceremony.\n\nCityscape and landmarks\nTahrir Square\nTahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the 1952 Revolution which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the Mogamma governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the Arab League, the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the Egyptian Museum. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square has witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient obelisk from the reign of Ramses II, originally unearthed at Tanis (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed sphinx statues moved from Karnak.\n\nEgyptian Museum\nThe Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among the collections on display are the finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nGrand Egyptian Museum\nMuch of the collection of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, including the Tutankhamun collection, are slated to be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction in Giza and was due to open by the end of 2020.\n\nCairo Tower\nThe Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It is one of Cairo's landmarks and provides a bird's eye view of the city to restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island on the Nile River, in the city centre. At 187 m (614 ft), it is 44 m (144 ft) higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some 15 km (9 mi) to the southwest.\n\nOld Cairo\nThis area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the Coptic Museum, which showcases the history of Coptic art from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, the oldest and best-known synagogue in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.\n\nTo the north of this Coptic enclave is the Amr ibn al-'As Mosque, the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly Fustat, founded in 642 AD right after the Arab conquest but rebuilt many times since. A part of the former city of Fustat has also been excavated to the east of the mosque and of the Coptic enclave, although the archeological site is threatened by encroaching construction and modern development. To the northwest of Babylon Fortress and the mosque is the Monastery of Saint Mercurius (or Dayr Abu Sayfayn), an important and historic Coptic religious complex consisting of the Church of Saint Mercurius, the Church of Saint Shenute, and the Church of the Virgin (also known as al-Damshiriya). Several other historic churches are also situated to the south of Babylon Fortress.\n\nIslamic Cairo\nCairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of Islamic architecture in the world. The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterised by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as \"Islamic Cairo\", especially in English travel literature. It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.\nThe first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the classical period of Islamic civilisation. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful. Another Abbasid construction, the Nilometer on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the Nile, which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.\nThe settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: al-Qahira) was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the Aqmar Mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i.\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the al-Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), a sabil (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. Still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which today hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The Khan al-Khalili is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).\n\nCitadel of Cairo\nThe Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by Salah al-Din in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the Muqattam Hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and Fustat to the southwest. It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when Khedive Isma'il moved to 'Abdin Palace. It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the National Military Museum, the 14th century Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the 19th century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.\n\nKhan el-Khalili\nKhan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar, or marketplace adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by Sultan al-Ghuri, who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today. Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate Mamluk-style gateways. Today, Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.\n\nSociety\nIn the present day, Cairo is a heavily urbanised city. Because of the influx of people into the city, lone standing houses are rare, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. Single detached houses are usually owned by the wealthy. Formal education is also seen as important, with twelve years of standard formal education. Cairenes can take a standardised test similar to the SAT to be accepted to an institution of higher learning, but most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the workforce. Egypt still struggles with poverty, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day.\n\nWomen's rights\nThe civil rights movement for women in Cairo – and by extent, Egypt – has been a struggle for years. Women are reported to face constant discrimination, sexual harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. A 2013 UN study found that over 99% of Egyptian women reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives. The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalising sexual harassment. The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous megacity for women in the world. In 2020, the social media account \"Assault Police\" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders. The account was founded by student Nadeen Ashraf, who is credited for instigating an iteration of the #MeToo movement in Egypt.\n\nPollution\nThe air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.\nIn recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of smog  has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to temperature inversion. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.\nCairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.\nThe city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which are not collected or managed. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the Zabbaleen community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat Naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.\n\nInternational relations\nThe Headquarters of the Arab League is located at Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nZulfikar family, Egyptian noble family\nRabab Al-Kadhimi (1918–1998), dentist and poet\nWael Alaa (born 1987), musician known as Neobyrd\nAmr Aly (born 1962), American soccer player and Olympian\nGamal Aziz, also known as Gamal Mohammed Abdelaziz, former president and chief operating officer of Wynn Resorts, and former CEO of MGM Resorts International, indicted as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal\nYasser Arafat (1929–2004), born Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was the 3rd Chairman of The PLO and first president of the Palestinian Authority\nAbu Sa'id al-Afif, 15th-century Samaritan\nEzz El-Dine Zulficar (1919–1963), Egyptian film director, screenwriter, actor and producer, known for his distinctive style, which blends romance and action.

          "summary": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.",

          "title": "القاهرة",
          "content": "القَاهِرَة هي عاصمة جمهورية مصر العربية وأكبر وأهم مدنها، وتعد أكبر مدينة عربية من حيث تعداد السكان والمساحة، وتحتل المركز الثاني أفريقيًا والسابع عشر عالميًا من حيث التعداد السكاني، كما أنها جزء من أكبر تجمع حضري في أفريقيا والوطن العربي والشرق الأوسط. تعد منطقة القاهرة الكبرى الثانية عشرة من حيث عدد السكان في العالم حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها 21,322,750 مليون نسمة حسب إحصائيات عام 2021. يمثلون 20% من إجمالي تعداد سكان مصر أكثر من (107 مليون نسمة).\nتعد مدينة القاهرة من أكثر المدن تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً، حيث شهدت العديد من الحقب التاريخية المختلفة على مر العصور، وتوجد فيها العديد من المعالم القديمة والحديثة، فأصبحت متحفاً مفتوحاً يضم آثاراً فرعونية ويونانية ورومانية وقبطية وإسلامية. يعود تاريخ المدينة إلى نشأة مدينة أون الفرعونية أو هليوبوليس «عين شمس حالياً» والتي تعد واحدة من أقدم مدن العالم القديم. أما القاهرة بطرازها الحالي فيعود تاريخ إنشائها إلى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص عام 641 م وإنشائه مدينة الفسطاط، ثم إنشاء العباسيين لمدينة العسكر، فبناء أحمد بن طولون لمدينة القطائع، ومع دخول الفاطميين مصر قادمين من إفريقية (تونس حالياً) بدأ القائد جوهر الصقلي في بناء العاصمة الجديدة للدولة الفاطمية بأمر من الخليفة الفاطمي المعز لدين الله وذلك في عام 969م، وأطلق عليها الخليفة اسم «القاهرة». وأطلق على القاهرة- على مر العصور- العديد من الأسماء، فهي مدينة الألف مئذنة ومصر المحروسة وقاهرة المعز. شهدت القاهرة خلال العصر الإسلامي أرقى فنون العمارة التي تمثلت في بناء القلاع والحصون والأسوار والمدارس والمساجد، مما منحها لمحةً جماليةً لا زالت موجودة بأحيائها القديمة حتى الآن.\nوتعد القاهرة محافظة ومدينة، أي أنها محافظة تشغل كامل مساحتها مدينة واحدة، وفي نفس الوقت مدينة كبيرة تشكل محافظة بذاتها، وتنقسم إلى 37 حياً، وتحتفل القاهرة بعيدها القومي في 6 يوليو من كل عام، وهو اليوم الذي يوافق وضع القائد جوهر الصقلي حجر أساس المدينة عام 969م، ليبلغ عمر القاهرة الآن ما يربو على 1055 عام.\nتعد القاهرة أيضاً مقراً للعديد من المنظمات الإقليمية والعالمية، حيث يقع بها مقر جامعة الدول العربية، والمكتب الإقليمي لكل من: منظمة الصحة العالمية، منظمة الأغذية والزراعة، منظمة الطيران المدني الدولي، الاتحاد الدولي للاتصالات، صندوق الأمم المتحدة للسكان، هيئة الأمم المتحدة للمرأة، مقر برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية للأمم المتحدة، وكذلك مقر الاتحاد الإفريقي لكرة السلة.\n\nالتسمية\nاختلفت الأقاويل حول سبب تسمية القاهرة بهذا الاسم، فقيل أن جوهر الصقلي سمى المدينة في أول الأمر المنصورية تيمناً باسم مدينة المنصورية التي أنشأها خارج القيروان المنصور بالله والد المعز لدين الله، أو تيمناً باسم والد المعز نفسه إحياءً لذكراه، واستمر هذا الاسم حتى قدم المعز إلى مصر فأطلق عليها اسم «القاهرة»، وذلك بعد مرور أربع سنوات على تأسيسها، تفاؤلاً بأنها ستقهر الدولة العباسية المنافسة للفاطميين، وقيل أنه سماها بالقاهرة لتقهر الدنيا، أو أنها سميت نسبة إلى الكوكب القاهر وهو كوكب المريخ. ولمدينة القاهرة عدة أسماء شهيرة منها مصر المحروسة، قاهرة المعز، مدينة الألف مئذنة، جوهرة الشرق.\n\nالتاريخ\nاكتسبت القاهرة مكانتها وتأثيرها على مختلف الحضارات بفضل موقعها الاستراتيجي الذي اختاره لها أهل مصر منذ فجر الحضارة، وتميزت عن بقية العواصم التاريخية بصفة الاستمرار، فشكل تطورها سلسلة من الحلقات بدأت مع مدينة أون في عهد ما قبل الأسرات والتي كانت بمثابة العاصمة الدينية بعد توحيد البلاد وبداية عهد الأسرات على يد الملك مينا بينما كانت منف هي أول عاصمة إدارية وسياسيه لمصر بعد استقرار الوحدة. وعرفت أون فيما بعد بالاسم الإغريقي هليوبوليس أو عين شمس حالياً. عقب الفتح الإسلامي لمصر سنة 18 هـ/639 م، شيد عمرو بن العاص مدينة الفسطاط سنة 21 هـ/641 م، وبنى جامع عرف باسمه، ثم اختطت أماكن إقامة القبائل العربية. وعقب قيام الدولة العباسية والقضاء على الدولة الأموية أنشأ العباسيون مدينة العسكر في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط وأقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيها صالح بن علي دار الإمارة وثكن الجند، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر، وبمرور الأيام اتصلت العسكر بالفسطاط وأصبحتا مدينة كبيرة خطت فيها الطرق وشيدت بها المساجد والأسواق. وذلك إلى أن تولى أحمد بن طولون حكم مصر ورأى أن مدينة العسكر لا تتسع لحاشيته وجنده، فصعد إلى جبل المقطم ورأى بين العسكر والمقطم أرض فضاء فاختط في موضعها مدينته الجديدة التي سميت القطائع. وبعد قرابة مائة عام على إنشاء القطائع دخل الفاطميون مصر بقيادة جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفة المعز لدين الله، فأخذ في وضع أساس «القاهرة» شمال شرقي القطائع، كما وضع أساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الأزهر.\n\nالعصور القديمة\nأون\nكانت مدينة أون القديمة وموقعها حالياً منطقة المطرية وعين شمس من أبرز مراكز الثقافة المصرية القديمة وذكرت في المتون المصرية القديمة بأسماء «أونو أفق السماء» و«أنو سماء مصر» واعتبرتها مقر الآلهة المختارة وموطن ميلاد كل معبود، وسميت المدينة في القبطية «أونو»، وفي اليونانية «هليوبوليس» بمعنى مدينة الشمس. كان للمدينة ماضيها السياسي حيث تعد واحدة من أقدم عواصم مصر المتحدة في فجر التاريخ وذلك نتيجة لجهود زعمائها الذين أقاموا بها أول وحده للوجهين سبقت الوحدة التي تمت على يد الملك مينا. وكفل للمدينة شهرتها في الفلسفة والدين قدم مذهبها في تفسير نشأة الوجود. أما في الفلك ترجع شهرة المدينة إلى ابتكار التقويم الشمسي الذي تميزت به الحضارة المصرية. وعلى الرغم من أن مدينة أون لم تلعب دوراً سياسياً بارزاً في العصور التاريخية إلا أنها ظلت محتفظة بمكانتها الثقافية والحضارية والدينية وحرص الملوك على ترك آثارهم بها على مر العصور، وأسفرت الحفائر الحديثة عن الكثير من الآثار التي تدل على ذلك منها الجزء العلوي لمسلة صغيرة من الحجر الرملي تعود إلى عهد الملك تتي من الدولة القديمة. ومن آثار عصر الدولة الوسطى، مسلة من الجرانيت الأحمر أقامها الملك سنوسرت الأول، وبقايا مسلة للفرعون تحتمس الثالث، وعدد من اللوحات من الحجر الجيري وجزء من تمثال أثري. ومن آثار عصر الدولة الحديثة، عمود مرنبتاج الموجود في منطقة المعابد، وتمثال الملك سيتي الثاني من الحجر الجيري، وبقايا معبد للملك رمسيس الثالث، وعدد من تيجان الأعمدة وأجزاء من أعمدة وتماثيل لأبو الهول.\n\nبابليون\nتقع مدينة بابليون في منطقة القاهرة القبطية حالياً، وقام بإنشائها رمسيس الثاني واتخذت اسمها من أسرى البابليين الذين ثاروا عليه، فبنى بها القلعة التي اعتقلهم فيها، ثم أطلق الاسم على المدينة بأكملها. واشتهرت المدينة في العصر الروماني في عهد الإمبراطور أغسطس، وأمر بإعادة بنائها الإمبراطور تراجان عام 130 ق.م وحول الحصن إلى مدينة عسكرية، ورمم الحصن ووسعه الإمبراطور الروماني أركاديوس في القرن الرابع الميلادي. استعمل في بناء الحصن أحجار أخذت من معابد فرعونية وأكملت بالطوب الأحمر ولم يبق من مباني الحصن حالياً سوى الباب القبلي الذي يكتنفه برجان كبيران، وبنى فوق أحد البرجين الكنيسة المعلقة، كما بني فوق البرج الآخر كنيسة مار جرجس الروماني للروم الأرثوذكس، وعلى باقي السور بنيت كنيسة القديس أبو سرجة وكنيسة العذراء وقصرية الريحان ودير مار جرجس للراهبات وكنيسة القديسة بربارة ومعبد لليهود. يعرف الحصن الروماني بقصر الشمع أو قلعة بابليون وتبلغ مساحته حوالي نصف كيلومتر مربع، ويقع بداخله المتحف القبطي. في عام 641 م سقط الحصن في يد عمرو بن العاص بعد حصار دام نحو سبعة أشهر في 18 ربيع الآخر 20 هـ/16 أبريل 641 م، وكان سقوطه إيذاناً بدخول الإسلام في مصر. اختار عمرو بن العاص مكان إستراتيجي شمال حصن بابليون وأقام فيه مدينة الفسطاط وداخلها حصن بابليون لتكون مدينة للجند العرب.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nالفسطاط\nاتخذت الفسطاط اسمها من خيمة عمرو بن العاص التي أقامها في وسط معسكره، وأنشأها عمرو بن العاص شمال حصن بابليون، وأمر بتخطيطها لتكون أول عاصمة للإسلام في مصر بدلاً من الإسكندرية، وفي وسط المدينة أقام مسجداً للصلاة سمي باسمه واشتهر بمناراته الأربعة، وخططت الأرض حوله إلى أحياء، وولى عمرو بن العاص أربعة من المسلمين لتنظيم المدينة وهم معاوية بن خديج التجيبي، شريك بن سمي الغطيفي، عمرو بن محزم الخولاني، جبريل بن ناشرة المعافري. اشتهرت الفسطاط بشوارعها المرصوفة ومنازلها الفسيحة التي تتوسطها نافورات المياه والحدائق الداخلية، وتعددت بالمدينة الأسواق التي كان يقع معظمها على شاطئ نهر النيل وذلك بخلاف الأسواق حول الجامع. تميز اختيار موقع المدينة بسهولة الدفاع عنه لأسباب طبيعية فالنيل يحدها من الغرب وجبل المقطم من الشرق واللذان شكلا حاجزا طبيعياً ضد أي اعتداء خارجي.\n\nالعسكر\nالعسكر هي ثاني العواصم الإسلامية في مصر، وأنشأها العباسيون في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط، وأقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيه صالح بن علي دار الإمارة وثكنات الجند أو دار العسكر، ومنه اتخذت المدينة اسمها، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر. تعتبر المدينة امتداداً للاتجاهات التخطيطية والعمرانية لمدينة الفسطاط، وعظمت بها العمارة وشيدت المساكن والقصور وتوسع عمرانها حتى التحمت بالفسطاط، وحكم مصر منها 65 والياً على امتداد 120 عاماً، ويرجح أن موقعها كان بالقرب من حي السيدة زينب حالياً.\n\nالقطائع\nالقطائع هي المدينة التي أسسها أحمد بن طولون، لتصبح بذلك ثالث عاصمة إسلامية في مصر، ويرجع اسمها إلى نظام تخطيطها المنقول عن مدينة سامراء التي شب فيها بن طولون، وهو التخطيط المتقاطع المكون من قطع سكنية كل منها لجماعة من السكان تربطهم رابطة أو طبقة أو مستوى واحد، يطلق عليها اسم القطع. شيدت المدينة في الأرض الفضاء بين مدينة العسكر وجبل المقطم، ووضعت أولى خططها عام 256 هـ/870 م، وبعد ست سنوات في عام 876 م احتفل ابن طولون بوضع أساس الجامع الذي سمي باسمه على جبل يشكر، والذي انتهى بناؤه في سنتين، ويقع في وسط المدينة، ويعد من أكبر مساجد العالم الإسلامي بمساحة تبلغ 26500 متر مربع، واشتهر باسم الجامع المعلق إذ يصعد إلى أبوابه بسلالم دائرية الشكل، كما أنشأ ابن طولون أول مستشفى في مصر بمنطقة البساتين. وانتقل إلى المدينة كل من له صلة بالحكم أو إدارة البلاد وأفراد الجيش، ولم يكن مسموحاً للعامة بالسكن فيها. ظلت القطائع عاصمة مصر خلال الحكم الطولوني الذي استمر 27 عاماً حتى سنة 293 هـ/905 م، مع قدوم الجيش العباسي إلى مصر، والذي محى القطائع وحولها إلى أطلال مع الإبقاء على الجامع، وعادت مدينة العسكر مقراً للحكم حتى دخول الفاطميين.\n\nقاهرة المعز\nبعد قرابة المائة عام على إنشاء القطائع، قدم إلى مصر جيش الفاطميين من المغرب بقيادة جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفة المعز لدين الله، ووصل إلى الفسطاط في 11 شعبان 358 هـ/يوليو 969 م، ودخلها في اليوم التالي، ونزل مع جنوده في الفراغ الواقع شمال شرقي القطائع وأخذ في وضع أساس القاعدة الفاطمية الجديدة في 17 شعبان 385 هـ/7 يوليو 969 م، والتي سماها «القاهرة»، كما وضع أساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير في 18 شعبان 358 هـ، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الأزهر في جمادي الأول سنة 359 هـ/أبريل 970 م. أنشئت المدينة على مساحة 340 فدان، وبني حولها سور من اللبن مربع الشكل طول كل من ضلعيه الشمالي والجنوبي 1500 ذراع، وضلعيه الشرقي والغربي 1700 ذراع، وبكل ضلع من أضلاع السور بوابتان، فالضلع الشمالي به باب النصر وباب الفتوح، والشرقي به باب البرقية (الغريب) والقراطين (المحروق)، والجنوبي يواجه الفسطاط عند باب الخلق وبه باب زويلة (المتولي) وباب الفرج، والغربي به باب القنطرة وباب سعادة. بدأت المدينة كمدينة عسكرية تشتمل على مساكن الأمراء ودواوين الحكومة وخزائن المال، وفي سنة 973 تحولت إلى عاصمة الدولة الفاطمية عندما انتقل إليها المعز لدين الله من المغرب، وأطلق عليها قاهرة المعز. بعد انقضاء 120 سنة من تأسيس القاهرة رأى أمير الجيوش بدر الجمالي وكان وزيراً للخليفة المستنصر بالله أن الناس شيدوا خارج سور القاهرة بسبب اتساع العمران، فأحاطها بسور وصله بسور جوهر عام 480 هـ/1087 م، وأقام السور الجديد من اللبن والأبواب من الحجارة.\n\nالعصر الأيوبي\nأرسل السلطان نور الدين محمود حملة إلى مصر لطرد الصليبيين بقيادة أسد الدين شيركوه، الذي اصطحب معه صلاح الدين ابن أخيه نجم الدين أيوب. وعقب وفاة شيركوه ولي الخليفة العاضد صلاح الدين وزارة مصر، فأصبح بذلك الرجل الأول في الدولة. ثم استبد صلاح الدين بالأمور وضعف أمر العاضد وهدم دار المعرفة وبناها مدرسة شافعية وبنى دار الغزل للمالكية وعزل قضاة الشيعة وأقام قاضياً شافعياً في مصر واستناب في جميع البلاد. وبدلاً من أن ينشئ صلاح الدين عاصمة جديدة، اتجه إلى ضم ضواحي المدينة الأربعة (الفسطاط والعسكر والقطائع والقاهرة الفاطمية) لتكون معاً عاصمة الدولة، فخرجت القاهرة عن نطاق أسوارها القديمة وامتد تخطيطها ليصل إلى قلعة الجبل، التي ظلت مقراً لحكم مصر في مختلف العصور التي تلت حكم الأيوبيين، وحتى عصر الخديوي إسماعيل الذي نقل مقر الحكم إلى قصر عابدين. وفي عام 569 هـ انتدب بهاء الدين قراقوش لمد سور حول القاهرة بحدودها الجديدة، فزاد في سور القاهرة الممتد من باب القتطرة إلى باب الشعرية، ومن باب الشعرية إلى باب البحر، ثم زاد في الجزء الذي يلي باب النصر إلى برج الظفر ومن هذا البرج إلى برج البرقية ومنه إلى درب بطوط وإلى خارج باب الوزير ليتصل بسور قلعة الجبل. ومن معالم تلك الحقبة التي ما زالت باقية، سواقي عيون بئر يوسف وقناطر مجرى المياه التي تحمل المياه إلى القلعة.\n\nالعصر المملوكي\nيعد عصر المماليك هو العصر الذهبي للقاهرة، ولا سيما بعدما خفت وطأة الحروب الصليبية في الشام، وانتصر المماليك على المغول. ففي عهد الظاهر بيبرس امتدت القاهرة في اتجاه الشمال خارج أسوارها في حي الحسينية، وشيد مسجداً رائعاً يعرف اليوم باسم جامع الظاهر وكان اسمه قديماً جامع الصافية، كما شيد العديد من المباني في قلعة صلاح الدين كدار الذهب، وأنشأ الأسواق والجسور والقناطر، وشاركه أمراؤه في بناء العديد من العمائر والرباع والخانات والدور والمساجد والحمامات التي أضافت لمسة من الجلال والجمال على المدينة.\n\n وفي عهد أسرة قلاوون التي حكمت مصر قرابة المائة عام، شيد المنصور قلاوون طائفة من العمائر النادرة، منها مدرسة الجليلة وقبته أو ضريحه، وأنشأ المارستان وجعله وقفاً لجميع الطوائف من الملك حتى العبيد، وما زال جزء منه قائماً إلى اليوم. وفي أيام السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، امتدت القاهرة جهة الشمال عبر الصحراء والشمال الغربي والغرب أيضاً بما طرحه النيل من طمي أثمر تدريجياً عن أرض جديدة غرب القاهرة، فلم يترك أمراء المماليك قطعة أرض داخل القاهرة إلا وأقاموا فيها المساجد والمدارس والحمامات والسبل والوكالات والأضرحة، فعم الرخاء على المدينة وازدهرت التجارة وتسابق الأمراء والأعيان على تشييد أبهى فنون العمارة. وأحب السلطان الناصر العمارة فرصع القاهرة بأفخم المباني، وأنشأ تحت قلعة صلاح الدين ميداناً للألعاب والمسابقات بين الأمراء، وعمر كثيراً من القصور داخل القلعة، وشيد جامعه ذا المئذنتين الذي ما زال قائماً حتى الآن، وفي أيامه زار مصر الرحالة المسلم ابن بطوطة في عام 1326 فقال عنها «قهرت قاهرتها الأمم، وتملكت ملوكها نواصي العرب والعجم»، وفي أثناء حكم المماليك البحرية ولد المؤرخ تقي الدين المقريزي، الذي ألف موسوعة هامة عن خطط مصر وعن القاهرة بوجه خاص وصفت جمال عمارة القاهرة وفنونها. وفي أيام السلطان حسن بن قلاوون شيدت عمارة جليلة تمثلت في مدرسة ومسجد السلطان حسن، الذي يعد أجمل مساجد القاهرة. وفي عهد المماليك الجراكسة ظهر حبهم للعمائر الجميلة والذوق السليم، فشيد سلاطينهم وأمراؤهم العمائر والمساجد ومنها مسجد الملك الظاهر برقوق بجوار مدرسة الناصر قلاوون، وخانقاه الملك الناصر بن برقوق، وهي بناء ضخم صمم ليخدم عدة أغراض، فهو ضريح لآل برقوق ومدرسة للعلوم ومسجد وخانقاه فخمة، ومسجد الملك المؤيد شيخ بجوار باب زويلة، ومسجد السلطان الأشرف برسباي، ومسجد السلطان الأشرف قايتباي، ومسجد السلطان قنصوه الغوري.\n\nالعصر العثماني\nاستولى السلطان سليم على مصر وشرع في تأييد سلطته، فجعل عليها حاكماً يلقب بالباشا، وليضمن عدم خروج الباشا على الآستانة ويستقل بمصر، جعل في مصر ثلاث إدارات كل منها يراقب الآخر، حتى لا يخشى من اتحادها أو تمردها، فكانت القوة الأولى هي «الباشا» وأهم واجباته هي إبلاغ الأوامر السلطانية لرجال الحكومة والشعب ومراقبة تنفيذها، والقوة الثانية هي «الوجاقات الست» وواجبها هو حفظ النظام والدفاع عن القطر المصري، وتوزعت في القاهرة والمراكز الرئيسية، أما القوة الثالثة فهي «المماليك» وهم بقايا المماليك البحرية والجراكسة، وواجبهم حفظ التوازن بين الباشا والوجاقات لأنهم أعداء لكلا الفريقين. وظل أمراء المماليك هم أصحاب القوة الفعلية بالبلاد، وزاد نفوذهم مع تقلص نفوذ الباب العالي وتقلص نفوذ ولاته في مصر. ومن آثار تلك الحقبة التي ما زالت باقية مسجد محمد بك أبو الذهب تجاه الجامع الأزهر، وعمائر عبد الرحمن كتخدا «محافظ مصر»، والذي كان مغرماً بالبناء فأنشأ وجدد الكثير من المساجد والسبل والأضرحة، وكان في مقدمة الساعين لتجميل القاهرة، ويتجلى ذلك في سبيله الرائع الواقع في ملتقى شارعي النحاسيين والجمالية والمعروف باسمه حتى اليوم، كما أنشأ بالقرب من باب الفتوح مسجداً وكتاباً، وزاد في مقصورة الجامع الأزهر وبنى به محراباً جديداً وأقام له منبراً وأنشأ له باباً عظيماً وبنى بأعلاه مكتباً لتعليم الأيتام من أطفال المسلمين، وبنى المدرسة الطيبرسية، وأنشأ عند باب البرقية «باب الغريب» جامعاً ومكتباً، وجامعاً ومكتباً وساقية ومنارة جهة الأزبكية، كما بنى المشهد الحسيني، ومشاهد السيدة زينب والسيدة سكينة والسيدة عائشة والسيدة فاطمة والسيدة رقية، وجدد المارستان المنصوري، وكانت دار سكناه بحارة عابدين من الدور العظيمة المحكمة الوضع والإتقان.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nعصر الأسرة العلوية\nأسس محمد علي الأسرة العلوية في مصر وأرسى خلال حكمه أسس النهضة الحديثة، وانتقل بمصر من الاضمحلال الذي سيطر عليها خلال حكم العثمانيين إلى مشارف العصر الحديث، وارتقى بها إلى رتب الدول المتقدمة. أدرك محمد علي بعبقريته الفطرية الفذة أن السبيل لبناء النهضة هو الارتقاء بالعلوم والإدارة والصناعة والزراعة، فأنشأ المدارس الحديثة وأرسل البعثات العلمية وأعاد تنظيم الجيش والإدارة الحكومية وشيد دور الصناعة بأنواعها والتي تركزت بمنطقة السبتية، كما أقام الجسور والقناطر وحفر الترع. واهتم محمد علي بالقاهرة فأمر بتنظيم وتوسيع وتنظيف وإنارة شوارعها، وأزال الأنقاض المحيطة بها وردم بها بركها، وكون في عام 1834 مجلساً للإشراف على تجميل القاهرة، كما استقدم الفنانين والعمال المهرة من فرنسا وإيطاليا وتركيا لبناء القصور واشترط عليهم تعيين أربعة من المصريين مع كل منهم ليتعلموا حرفتهم، ومن أشهر القصور التي شيدها قصر الجوهرة وقصر القبة وقصر الحرم وقصر الأزبكية وقصر النيل، وقام أيضاً ببناء جامعه بالقلعة، والذي تم تصميمه على غرار مسجد السلطان أحمد بالآستانة. وفي أبريل 1847 انتقلت ولاية مصر من محمد علي إلى إبراهيم باشا، والذي اهتم بتقوية الجيش والأسطول ونظم جمعية الحقانية لتنظيم سير القضايا، وشيد قصر الروضة والقصر العالي، وفي عهده تم ردم بركة الأزبكية تماماً وحولت إلى متنزه ضخم. وفي عهد عباس باشا الأول منح امتياز إنشاء خط سكك حديدية بين القاهرة والإسكندرية للبريطانيين عام 1851، وأنشئ حي العباسية في صحراء شمال شرق القاهرة عام 1849 بغرض إقامة ثكنات عسكرية، كما أقام فيها سراي الباشا أو «سراي الحصوة» ومدرسة حربية ومستشفى. عقب وفاة عباس الأول آل حكم مصر إلى سعيد باشا، فافتتح في عهده خط السكك الحديدية بين القاهرة والإسكندرية عام 1854، وأنشئت المحطة الرئيسية للسكك الحديدية بباب الحديد عام 1856، وبوفاته انتقل حكم مصر إلى إسماعيل باشا عام 1863.\n\nعصر الخديوي إسماعيل\nيعود لقب القاهرة الخديوية إلى أول حاكم لمصر يحمل هذا اللقب وهو الخديوي إسماعيل، والذي تولى عرش مصر في 18 يناير 1863، فمنح القاهرة وجهاً جديداً متألقاً، وحدد معالمها الحضارية من خلال إنجازات بقيت محفورة على جدران مبانيها وشوارعها الحديثة. كانت القاهرة عند تولي إسماعيل باشا عرش مصر يبلغ تعدادها 270 ألف نسمة وتمتد من منطقة القلعة بسفح المقطم شرقاً إلى مدافن الأزبكية وميدان العتبة والمناصرة غرباً، وساد على أحيائها الانحلال العمراني مما أثار حماس إسماعيل باشا لصنع ثورة عمرانية بعاصمة البلاد ترقى بها إلى مصاف العواصم الأوروبية، ولتكون «باريس الشرق»، فطلب إسماعيل باشا من الإمبراطور نابليون الثالث أن يقوم هاوسمان المهندس العالمي بتخطيط القاهرة على غرار التخطيط الجديد لباريس، واستغرق إعداد وتصميم وتنفيذ المشروع خمس سنوات، وفي عام 1872 افتتح الخديوي إسماعيل شارع محمد علي «القلعة»، كما شق شارع «كلوت بك» عام 1875، وأنشأ دار الأوبرا، والكتب خانة، وكان من أهم القصور التي شيدت خلال تلك الحقبة قصر عابدين، الذي بدأ إنشاؤه في غام 1863، وأصبح مقر الحكم بدلاً من القلعة في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل، ويعود اسم القصر إلى أنه بني مكان قصر «عابدين بك»، وطلب إسماعيل باشا الاحتفاظ باسم عابدين للقصر وميدانه. وفي فترة لاحقة أنشئ كوبري قصر النيل وكوبري أبو العلا ليصلا القاهرة بجزيرة الزمالك والجيزة، وأدخل خط الترام إلى شوارع القاهرة عام 1896 لربط العتبة الخضراء بالعباسية.\n\nالقاهرة المعاصرة\nفي بداية القرن العشرين شهدت مدينة القاهرة تطوراً هائلاً نتيجة قدوم رجال الأعمال الأجانب، وتم إنشاء العديد من الوكالات والمحال التجارية والتي أصبحت فيما بعد علامات تجارية شهيرة مثل جروبي وغيره، كذلك شهدت توسعاً من خلال ربط شبرا بالقاهرة عام 1902، وربط حي الظاهر بالسيدة زينب وغرب الأزبكية عام 1903، وبدأ نمو حي الفجالة وحي التوفيقية، كما بدأ إنشاء حي جاردن سيتي عام 1906، وتعمير حي الزمالك عام 1905، وبدأ العمل في ضاحية مصر الجديدة عام 1906، أما ضاحية المعادي فنشأت عام 1907.\nوخلال ثورة 1919 كانت القاهرة هي مركز الاحتجاجات والتي كانت تتخذ من بيت سعد زغلول (بيت الأمة) مقراً لها، وعقب الثورة والانتهاء من تأسيس بنك مصر أصبحت القاهرة مركز ومقر للعديد من الشركات والمشروعات المصرية التي نشأت واحدة تلو الأخرى، وبلغت القاهرة في العشرينيات مستوى عال من الرقي والتحضر، ففي عام 1921 تم اختيارها لتنظيم مؤتمر القاهرة الذي جمع العديد من قادة أوروبا والشرق الأوسط لبحث تداعيات الحرب العالمية الأولى، كذلك في عام 1925 حصلت على وسام أجمل وأنظف مدينة في دول حوض البحر المتوسط باعتبارها مدينة الأناقة في تصميم مبانيها ونظافة شوارعها وانتظام حركة المرور بها.\n\nوفي نوفمبر 1943 أثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية، شهدت القاهرة اجتماع قادة الحلفاء في مؤتمر القاهرة والذي حضره الرئيس فرانكلين روزفلت وونستون تشرشل والقائد الصيني تشان كاي شيك ورئيس وزراء تركيا عصمت إينونو، وكان المؤتمر بمثابة نقطة فارقة بصدور إعلان القاهرة الذي تم التوقيع عليه يوم 27 نوفمبر 1943 ونص على نشر قوات في فرنسا وضرورة انسحاب اليابان من المقاطعات الصينية، واستمرار المعارك حتى الاستسلام غير المشروط.\n\nوفي 26 يناير 1952 عقب وقوع موقعة الإسماعيلية يوم 25 يناير بين القوات البريطانية وقوات الشرطة المصرية، قام مجهولون بإشعال حرائق في مدينة القاهرة التهمت الكثير من الأماكن العامة والفنادق والسينيمات والمحلات تجارية والمكاتب، كما أسفرت عن عشرات الضحايا. أدت تلك الأحداث إلى استقالة وزارة الوفد ذات الشعبية الجماهيرية، وتولى الوزارة علي ماهر باشا، وأعلنت الأحكام العرفية في البلاد، وتلاها في يوليو قيام الضباط الأحرار بالتحرك كبداية لأحداث ثورة 23 يوليو، وكانت القاهرة محطة فاصلة في تلك الأحداث، بالرغم من أن الملك فاروق وحاشيته كانوا بالإسكندرية، إلا أن حصار قصر عابدين والاستيلاء على القيادة العامة للجيش المصري تسبب في رضوخ الملك فاروق لمطالب الحركة، ووافق على مغادرة البلاد في 26 يوليو والتنازل عن العرش لابنه.\nوعقب حرب 1967 ونتيجة للمعارك تم إجلاء سكان محافظات القناة (بورسعيد، الإسماعيلية، السويس)، وكانت القاهرة من أكثر المحافظات استقبالاً للنازحين والتي كانت بأعداد كبيرة، تسببت في اندلاع الأزمة العقارية وقتها وارتفاع أسعارها بشكل متزايد، وترتب عليها ظهور العديد من المناطق السكنية مثل منشأة ناصر وغيرها.\n\nوفي أعقاب حرب أكتوبر وبداية عصر الانفتاح الاقتصادي شهدت القاهرة موجة هجرة واسعة من سكان الأقاليم بغرض التعليم أو العمل، وترتب عليها تغير ديموغرافيا المدينة عما كانت عليه، حيث بدأت عمليات هدم القصور القديمة لبناء أبنية سكنية وكذلك شهدت فترة الثمانينات والتسعينيات أوسع عمليات التعدي والبناء على الأراضي الزراعية، مما ترتب عليها فقدان القاهرة معظم مساحاتها الخضراء. شهد الربع الأخير من القرن العشرين مرحلة بناء المدن الجديدة، فبعد إنشاء مدينة نصر في عهد ناصر ومدينة 15 مايو ومدينة السلام في عهد السادات، شهد عهد مبارك إنشاء القاهرة الجديدة ومدينة بدر والشروق، وشهد أيضاً تشغيل مترو الأنفاق وإنشاء الطريق الدائري ليكون أكبر طريق بري يربط القاهرة الكبرى ببعضها.\nفي 25 يناير 2011 انطلقت مجموعة من التظاهرات والاحتجاجات الشعبية ذات الطابع الاجتماعي والسياسي، وكان ميدان التحرير بالقاهرة أبرز أماكن هذه المظاهرات حيث شهد أعداداً وصفت بالمليونية، كما شهدت القاهرة أيضاً أحداث لاحقة مثل أحداث مسرح البالون، أحداث ماسبيرو، أحداث محمد محمود، أحداث مجلس الوزراء، أحداث العباسية.\nوعقب تولي محمد مرسي رئاسة الجمهورية اتخذ عدة إجراءات وأصدر قرارات أثارت ضده احتجاجات ومظاهرات، كان أبرزها أحداث قصر الاتحادية مما أسفر عن وقوع ضحايا، وفي 30 يونيو 2013 خرجت مظاهرات حاشدة من المعارضين لحكم محمد مرسي في الميادين المصرية وعلى رأسها ميدان التحرير مطالبين بانتخابات رئاسية مبكرة ورحيل النظام.\n\nتوسعات المدينة\nاعتمدت الحكومة المصرية خطة إستراتيجية قومية لغزو الصحراء وإقامة مجتمعات عمرانية جديدة خارج وادي النيل ودلتاه لتكون مراكز حضارية ومناطق جذب سكاني واقتصادي بهدف إعادة توزيع السكان والأنشطة المختلفة توزيعاً متوازناً على أنحاء جمهورية مصر العربية، وبدأت تلك المشاريع خلال العهد الملكي مع إنشاء ضاحية مصر الجديدة «هليوبوليس» التي تعد أهم التجارب على مستوى العالم في مجال إنشاء المدن الجديدة خلال النصف الأول من القرن العشرين، والتي تعود فكرة إنشائها إلى عام 1905، واستوحي تخطيطها من المدن الحدائقية التي شيدت في أوروبا نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، فكان انتشار الفراغات الحضرية الكبيرة والشوارع المستقيمة المتسعة والتي خططت في هيئة حي عمراني راق يضاهي الأحياء الأوروبية. وفي أعقاب ثورة 23 يوليو 1952 أنشئت مدينة نصر بقرار من الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر بهدف التوسع العمراني في المنطقة الصحراوية شمال شرق القاهرة وخصوصاً شرق حي العباسية بعيداً عن الأراضي الزراعية، وأعطى إشارة البدء لإنشاء مدينة متكاملة بأسلوب حضاري راق وطريقة عمرانية متميزة أطلق عليها «مدينة نصر». نفذ التخطيط الأولي والتصاميم المعمارية لمشروع المدينة المهندس المعماري سيد كريم، على مساحة تصل لأكثر من 250 كم مربع وتمتد في الشرق من طريق مصر/السويس حتى الكيلو 51 وتقاطعه مع طريق القطامية، وفي الغرب من شارع صلاح سالم وفي الشمال حي مصر الجديدة وفي الجنوب المقطم. وفي عام 1978 بدأ إنشاء مدينة 15 مايو التي تعد إحدى مدن الجيل الأول من المجتمعات العمرانية الجديدة التي قامت بإنشائها وزارة الإسكان والتي تعود تسميتها نسبة إلى ثورة التصحيح في 15 مايو 1971، ويربط مدينة 15 مايو بالقاهرة طريقان رئيسيان هما كورنيش النيل وطريق الأوتوستراد، وبدأت في استقبال سكانها بعد عامين فقط من البدء في تنفيذها. وفي عام 1979 صدر قرار إنشاء مدينة القاهرة الجديدة والتي توسعت بأحيائها المعروفة الأمل والرحاب ومدينتي والتجمع الأول والثالث والخامس.\nوفي عام 1982 صدر قرار رئيس مجلس الوزراء بإنشاء مدينة بدر بطريق القاهرة/السويس على مساحة 18454.43 فدان، منها 7018 فدان مناطق سكنية، و2173 فدان مناطق خدمية. وفي عام 1995 صدر قرار جمهوري بإنشاء مدينة الشروق على مساحة 16.11 ألف فدان منها 9200 فدان كتلة عمرانية، أضيف إليها 5302 فدان عام 2015.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nالموقع\nتقع القاهرة على جوانب جزر نهر النيل في شمال مصر، مباشرة جنوب شرق النقطة التي يترك فيها نهر النيل واديه محصوراً فيِ الصحراء منقسماً إلى فرعين داخل منطقة دلتا النيل المنخفضة. بني الجزء الغربي على نموذج مدينة باريس مِن قبل حاكم مصر الخديوي إسماعيل في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر، والذي تميز بالأحياء الواسعة والحدائق العامة والمناطق المفتوحة. أما القسم الشرقي الأقدم للمدينة فتوسع بشكل عشوائي على مدى القرون، وامتلأ بالطرقِ الصغيرة والمباني المزدحمة. بينما يمتلئ غرب القاهرة بالبنايات الحكومية والهندسة المعمارية الحديثة، وأصبح الجزء الأهم في القاهرة، ويحوي النصف الشرقي الآثار التاريخية للمدينة على مر العصور لما يوجد به من مساجد وكنائس عتيقة ومباني أثرية ومعالم قديمة، كما توسعت المدينة شرقاً بإنشاء حي مدينة نصر الذي يعتبر من أكبر أحياء القاهرة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nتنقسم المدينة إلى أربع مناطق رئيسية هي:\n\nالمنطقة الشرقية وتضم 9 أحياء هي: (أول السلام، ثان السلام، المرج، عين شمس، المطرية، مصر الجديدة، النزهة، غرب مدينة نصر، شرق مدينة نصر).\nالمنطقة الغربية وتضم 9 أحياء هي: (الوايلي، باب الشعرية، منشأة ناصر، عابدين، الموسكي، الأزبيكة، بولاق، وسط، غرب).\nالمنطقة الشمالية وتضم 8 أحياء هي: (الزيتون، حدائق القبة، الأميرية، الزاوية الحمراء، الشرابية، الساحل، شبرا، روض الفرج).\nالمنطقة الجنوبية وتضم 11 حي هم: (السيدة زينب، مصر القديمة، الخليفة، المقطم، البساتين، دار السلام، المعادي، طره، حلوان، التبين، 15 مايو).\n\nالمناخ\nيتصف مناخ القاهرة بالاعتدال معظم أيام السنة ويتراوح المعدل اليومي لدرجة الحرارة خلال فصل الصيف بين 22 درجة مئوية و34 درجة مئوية في حين يتراوح المعدل اليومي خلال فصل الشتاء بين 18 درجة مئوية و9 درجة مئوية. ويمكن اعتبار أن هناك موسمين خلال العام صيف ساخن من مايو إلى أكتوبر، وشتاء معتدل من نوفمبر إلى أبريل، ويتميز مناخ القاهرة أيضاً بأنه جاف جداً، ويسقط المطر بكثافة منخفضة خلال فصل الشتاء، وترتفع مستويات الرطوبة خلال الصيف، وأحياناً تتعرض القاهرة لهبوب بعض الرياح الساخنة المحملة بالغبار خلال الفترة الممتدة بين شهري مارس ويونيو وتعرف باسم رياح الخماسين.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان القاهرة بنهاية عام 2018 9.7 مليون نسمة بنسبة 10.6% من إجمالي تعداد سكان مصر. لتكون بذلك أكثر مدن مصر المأهولة بالسكان، وأكثرها ازدحاماً بما تحتويه من هيكل عرقي وبنية أساسية ووظائف محلية ودولية متعددة، كما ينزح إليها الآلاف يومياً من المحافظات بسبب عملهم داخل القاهرة أو إنجاز المصالح الشخصية أو العلاج نتيجة لتركز الاستثمارات والأجهزة الحكومية وكبرى المستشفيات بها.\n\nاللغة\nيتحدث سكان القاهرة اللغة العربية، إلا أن العربية المحكية في القاهرة تختلف عن تلك المحكية في مصر الوسطى والعليا، والعربية المصرية هي الأهم بين أشكال العربية الحديثة المحكية في المنطقة، ومرد ذلك أساسا أن صناعة السينما المصرية ومركزها القاهرة هي الأكبر في الوطن العربي ويتم عرض الأفلام المصرية في المنطقة العربية دون ترجمة أو دوبلاج. بخلاف الأخبار وما شابهها، كما أن الأفلام لا تسجل باستخدام الفصحى - لغة كتابة الوطن العربي بأسره - بل تستخدم اللغة المحكية للمنطقة، وبالتالي كانت اللهجة المستخدمة هي المصرية لمعظم هذه الأفلام، ولهذا السبب فإن العربية المصرية وخاصّة اللهجة القاهرية مفهومة في عموم المنطقة العربية. العربية الفصحى هي ومنذ السيطرة العربية على مصر في القرن السابع لغة الكتابة والأدب، ولا تستخدم القبطية إلا كلغة طقسية للكنيسة الأرثوذكسية القبطية، والقبطية هي استمرار للغة المصرية القديمة وتكتب بحروف مشتقة من اليونانية وهي غير محكية اليوم إلا كلغة مقدسة. كلغات أجنبية فإن الإنجليزية والفرنسية تستخدم كلغة نخبوية على نطاق ضيق.\n\nالدين\nالإسلام هو الدين الرسمي لمصر بما فيها مدينة القاهرة وذلك طبقاً للدستور المصري، ويعترف بحقوق أتباع الديانات الثلاث اليهودية والمسيحية والإسلام، وغالبية سكان المدينة من المسلمين من أهل السنة والجماعة، وأكثر الأقلية من المسيحيين الأرثوذكس، والأقليات الأخرى من طوائف مسيحية بجانب اليهود. أهم المؤسسات الدينية العاملة في الدولة هي الجامع الأزهر الذي يعتبر أحد أهم أعمدة الإسلام السني في العالم، كذلك تحتل الكنيسة القبطية الأرثوذكسية مكانة هامة باعتبارها كنيسة وطنية تمثل غالبية مسيحيي مصر، أما اليهود فليس لهم مؤسسة دينية ترعاهم لقلة عددهم ولكن يرعى شئونهم طائفة خاصة بديانتهم.\n\nالثقافة\nالعمارة\nتتميز القاهرة كمدينة تاريخية بتراثها العريق واحتضانها لمجموعة فريدة من العمائر التي تعكس تطور العمارة الإسلامية بالمدينة على مدار ألف وثلاثمائة عام وأصبح الآن هذا التطور البنائي متحفاً مفتوحاُ للعمارة يعرض في ردهاته عمائر كل مرحلة من مراحل تقدم المدينة في حلقة متصلة من الأساليب المعمارية تتجلى في مبانيها كالمساجد والزوايا والمدارس والتكايا والقصور والدور والحمامات والأسبلة والقناطر والوكالات والخانات والأسواق فضلاً عن قلاعها وأسوارها وأبوابها.\nاستلهمت العمارة القاهرية المعاصرة أفكارها ومفرداتها من التراث المعماري المصري. ففي بدايات القرن العشرين اتجه بعض المعماريين إلى استعمال العناصر الشكلية للطراز الفرعوني مثل البوابات والأعمدة وقلدوها بالمواد والإنشاءات الحديثة، وفي فترة التسعينيات استلهم الطراز الفرعوني في التصميم من خلال نقل مفردات المعبد الفرعوني إلى واجهات المبنى، والتركيز على استخدام الشكل الهرمي كما في نصب الجندي المجهول بمدينة نصر. فيما استلهم بعض المعماريين تصميماتهم من التراث المعماري الإسلامي، وظهرت لذلك عدة شواهد في النصف الأول من القرن العشرين مثل معهد الموسيقى العربية بشارع رمسيس (1929) ومبنى جمعية المهندسين المصرية بنفس الشارع (1935)، وفي فترة الثمانينيات والتسعينيات بدأت تظهر نماذج لإعادة هذا الفكر المعماري منها مبنى مركز الدراسات التخطيطية والمعمارية بمصر الجديدة، ومبنى قاعة النيل للفنون التشكيلية بالجزيرة، والمباني العالية في أبراج مركز التجارة العالمي بكورنيش النيل، والذي يعطي دلالة واضحة على إمكانية الاستفادة من التراث الإسلامي مع معطيات العمارة المعاصرة والتي تركز على استخدام المباني العالية خاصة في المدن الكبرى كأحد المحددات الاقتصادية نظرا لارتفاع أسعار الأراضي.\n\nالإعلام\nتصدر الصحف المصرية الرئيسية الرسمية وغير الرسمية من القاهرة، ومنها مؤسسة الأهرام أعرق المؤسسات الصحفية في مصر وتصدر عنها جريدة الأهرام اليومية والأهرام إيبدو وجريدة المساء ومجلة العربي ومجلات أخرى، ودار أخبار اليوم والتي يصدر عنها جريدة الأخبار اليومية وأخبار اليوم الأسبوعية والعديد من المجلات، ودار التحرير ويصدر عنها جريدة الجمهورية، ويصدر أيضا في القاهرة العديد من الصحف الخاصة مثل جريدة المصري اليوم وجريدة الوفد والدستور وروز اليوسف وغيرها، وكذلك يوجد بالقاهرة مقر وكالة أنباء الشرق الأوسط، وهي وكالة الأنباء الرئيسية في مصر. والقاهرة هي مقر قنوات مبنى الإذاعة والتلفزيون بماسبيرو الذي تنطلق منه القنوات الإذاعية والتلفزيونية الحكومية.\n\nالفنون\nتزخر القاهرة بالفنانين التشكيليين والنحاتين والمبدعين الفنيين المتواجدين بها بصفة دائمة، وتعد مركزاً للفنون بمختلف أنواعها والأمسيات والندوات الثقافية والعروض المسرحية والسينمائي، وهي واحدة من المدن المبدعة المسجلة في قائمة اليونسكو للمدن المبدعة في مجال الفنون والحرف منذ 2017م، وتتمثل أبرز مظاهر الفنون في القاهرة في دار الأوبرا المصرية أو المركز الثقافي القومي بجزيرة الزمالك والذي تم تشييده كمنحة من الحكومة اليابانية لنظيرتها المصرية وبنيت الدار على الطراز الإسلامي وتم افتتاحها في 10 أكتوبر 1988 كدار بديلة لدار الأوبرا الخديوية التي بناها الخديوي إسماعيل عام 1869 واحترقت في 28 أكتوبر 1971 بعد أن ظلت منارة ثقافية لمدة 102 عام.\n\nالمطبخ\nالمطبخ القاهري هو رأس المطبخ المصري البسيط المتنوع، الذي يعطى للخبز فيه الأولوية ويُطلق عليه العيش باللهجة القاهرية كمرادف للفظ الحياة، ويُعد طبقيّ الفول والطعمية من أشهر عناصر الفطور القاهري. كذلك يُعد الكشري والمسقعة والمحشي والملوخية والفتة والكوارع والأرز بأنواعه من أبرز الأطباق الرئيسية. كما أن الشاي والقهوة وعصير القصب والعرقسوس والسوبيا من أكثر المشروبات شعبية في المدينة.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالقاهرة هي مركز مصر الاقتصادي، كونها عاصمة البلاد وأكثر المدن المصرية المأهولة بالسكان، وأقواها من حيث البنية التحتية، وبها تقع مقرات الشركات الكبرى، مركز التجارة العالمي، البورصة المصرية، البنك المركزي المصري، البنوك الرئيسية، وزارة التجارة والصناعة، وزارة الاستثمار، وزارة التعاون الدولي، وهي المقر الإقليمي للمنظمة العربية للتنمية الصناعية والتعدين واختارتها المنظمات والمؤسسات الدولية كمقر لمكاتبها الإقليمية في مصر مثل مؤسسة التمويل الدولية، البنك الدولي، برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، منظمة العمل الدولية، صندوق النقد الدولي، منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتنمية الصناعية، منظمة الأقطار العربية المصدرة للبترول، مجلس الوحدة الاقتصادية العربية. كما تضم عدة مناطق صناعية هي شق الثعبان على مساحة 1000 فدان، جنوب حلوان على مساحة 7 فدان، القطامية على مساحة 71 فدان، الروبيكي على مساحة 1629 فدان. بخلاف مراكز الصناعة اليدوية المتمثلة في مركز الحرف التقليدية بالفسطاط الذي يضم بين طياته ورشاً لأنشطة عديدة لفن النجارة من تطعيم بالصدف والأرابيسك، وفن الزجاج المعشق بالجبس والحلي والخيامية والخزف. بجانب أسواق التحف والتذكارات والعطور الشهيرة بخان الخليلي الذي يعد أشهر الخانات الإسلامية في العالم، ويقع في القاهرة الفاطمية على مشارف شارع المعز لدين الله، ويتخلله شبكة من الأسواق التقليدية وورش المقتنيات والمشغولات القضية والنحاسية والمذهبة والجلدية والخشبية والورقية. وفي عام 2009 احتلت القاهرة المركز السابع ضمن أبرز 50 مدينة مؤهلة لتقديم خدمات تكنولوجيا المعلومات بنظام التعهيد.\n\nالسياحة\nالقاهرة مدينة سياحية من الطراز الأول حيث تتعدد بها جميع المظاهر السياحية التي قد يحتاج إليها أي زائر، فبها العديد من المواقع الأثرية التي تعود لعصر الفراعنة، وأسوار المدينة القديمة التي ترجع إلى العصر الإسلامي، والمواقع الأثرية الإسلامية والمسيحية واليهودية الموجودة منذ دخول الأديان المختلفة لمصر.\nكما ينتشر بالمدينة مناطق التسوق الشهيرة، والعشرات من القصور والمساجد والكنائس والبوابات التاريخية والمباني العريقة من مختلف العصور بالإضافة للأماكن الثقافية والفنية والمسارح وغيرها، وينتشر بها أعداد كبيرة من الفنادق وأماكن الإقامة بمختلف أنواعها ودرجاتها.\nوتزخر كذلك بالمحميات الطبيعية البعيدة عن زحام قلب المدينة، والتي تبرز كمزارات باعثة على الهدوء والراحة والتأمل في الطبيعية. بخلاف التمتع برحلات نهر النيل الذي بني على ضفتيه درة ما تملكه المدينة من منشآت معمارية حديثة.\n\nالسياحة الترفيهية\nالقاهرة موقع لعدة مزارات سياحية ترفيهية هامة تضم حدائق ترفيهية على مساحات شاسعة يقبل عليها الكبار والصغار على حد سواء ومنها حديقة الأزبكية، الحديقة الدولية، حديقة الفسطاط،  والحديقة اليابانية بحلوان والتي تحتوي على بعض التماثيل التي ترمز لحقب تاريخية مختلفة، مثل تمثال زهرة اللوتس، تماثيل أفيال الشرق التي تحرس المكان، تمثال وجه الحياة وهو لامرأة تغمض عينيها مع ابتسامة خجل تعكس فكرة تقديس الشرق للمرأة، و48 تمثالاً لتلاميذ «شيبة» يجلس ليعلمهم الديانة البوذية أمام البحيرة الكبيرة، تمثال الحكمة الثلاثية وهو لثلاثة قرود تحث الإنسان على عدم التدخل في شؤون الغير «لا أسمع لا أرى لا أتكلم»، بالإضافة إلى بحيرة اللوتس وكشك الموسيقى والأشجار. ويأتي على رأس متنزهات القاهرة حديقة الأزهر التي تعد أحد أضخم حدائق القاهرة وواحدة من أكبر وأجمل حدائق العالم. تقع على مساحة 80 فدان كانت تستغل في الماضي كمقلب للقمامة والمخلفات لمدة تزيد على ألف عام. تم الإعلان عن المشروع في عام 1984 وافتتحت للزائرين في عام 2005 حيث استغرق إنشاؤها أكثر من 7 أعوام بتكلفة إجمالية تزيد على 100 مليون جنيه تحملتها مؤسسة أغاخان للعمارة الإسلامية.\nكما يبرز برج القاهرة كأحد معالم المدينة الحديثة والذي صممه المهندس نعوم شبيب، وتم بناؤه على شكل زهرة اللوتس المصرية من الخرسانة المسلحة خلال الفترة من 1956 وحتى 1961. يقف البرج على قاعدة من أحجار الجرانيت الأسواني التي سبق أن استخدمها المصريون القدماء في بناء معابدهم ومقابرهم، ويصل ارتفاعه إلى 187 متر وهو أعلى من الهرم الأكبر بالجيزة بحوالي 43 متر، ويتكون من 16 طابقاً، وتستغرق رحلة الوصول إلى قمة البرج 45 ثانية داخل المصعد للوصول إلى نهايته. يقع البرج في قلب القاهرة على جزيرة الزمالك بنهر النيل. ويوجد بقمته مطعم سياحي على منصة دوارة تسمح لرواد المطعم بمشاهدة معالم القاهرة من كل الجوانب. وتكتسب الرحلات النيلية شعبية متزايدة لدى السائحين بنوعيها ما بين رحلات بسيطة على ظهر مراكب خشبية عتيقة أو رحلات تتسم بالرفاهية على متن سفن عصرية.\n\nالسياحة البيئية\nبعيداً عن صخب وزحام القاهرة تظهر المحميات الطبيعية بالمدينة كأحد المزارات البارزة التي تبعث على الراحة والهدوء، وتتمثل في محمية وادي دجلة التي تقع شرق ضاحية المعادي بالصحراء الشرقية، والتي تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 60 كم مربع، وهي محمية غنية بالحفريات، وتتميز باحتوائها على العديد من الكائنات الحية الحيوانية مثل الغزلان، الأرانب الجبلية، الثعلب الأحمر، الفأر ريشي الذيل، إضافة إلى أنواع عديدة من الحشرات، فضلاً عن تسجيل ما يقارب الـ 18 نوع من الزواحف، و12 نوع من الطيور الممثلة لبيئة الصحراء الشرقية المقيمة والمهاجرة. وعلى بعد 18 كم من شرق ضاحية المعادي تقع محمية الغابة المتحجرة والتي تمثل كنزاً جيولوجياً وتراثاً إنسانياً، حيث تضم الغابة أشجاراً تحتفظ بسيقانها وفروعها بكامل التفاصيل متناثرة على مساحة 7 كم مربع تحولت إلى أشجار من حجارة. ووقع هذا التحول الطبيعي منذ العصر الاليجوسين أي منذ نحو 35 مليون سنة وتعد هذه الغابة الكثيفة من الأشجار المتحجرة نتاجاً طبيعياً للعصر الذي بدأت الأنهار تدخل فيه إلى مصر من الجنوب. كما توجد بالمحمية بعض تكوينات الأيوسين الأعلى وتحتوي على بعض الحفريات اللافقارية وعمرها يرجع إلى 60 مليون سنة. وفي حلوان ينبع أحد أشهر العيون المائية في مصر وهي «عين حلوان»، والتي كانت مقصداً لأهالي وسكان القاهرة بسبب كمية مائها المعدني الكبريتي المعالج للكثير من الأمراض الجلدية والذي يعد من أغنى العناصر الشفائية الطبية، بالإضافة إلى مناخ حلوان الجاف الذي يهيئ جواً مناسباً للاستشفاء من أمراض عديدة أهمها الأمراض الجلدية والروماتيزمية والمفصلية.\n\nالسياحة الثقافية\nتعد السياحة الثقافية في القاهرة أحد أهم عوامل الجذب السياحي إذ تمتلك المدينة مجموعة من الآثار المتنوعة صنعت من مناطق كاملة متاحف مفتوحة وساهمت في نشأة متاحف مصرية ذات مكانة عالمية، وكانت مصدر إلهام عشرات الكتب والروايات مثل ثلاثية نجيب محفوظ التي تعد أفضل رواية عربية، كما تبرز مدينة أون الفرعونية بمنطقة عين شمس بمعالمها الأثرية

فبدأ العمل في بنائه عام 970 وانتهى من تأسيسه عام 972، وفي عهد الخليفة الظافر بأمر الله شيد مسجد الحسين عام 1154.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالتعليم\nكانت القاهرة منذ فترة طويلة محور التعليم والخدمات التعليمية ليس فقط لمصر ولكن أيضاً للعالم الإسلامي قاطباً. وبالقاهرة العدد الأكبر من المدارس والجامعات والمعاهد بين مدن مصر، ومرجع ذلك هو عدد سكانها الضخم. ولا يختلف التعليم في القاهرة عن التعليم في باقي أنحاء مصر، فهو تقريباً بنفس الجودة. يوجد بجانب المدارس الحكومية العديد من المدارس الخاصة التي تدرس مناهج مشابهة للمناهج في المدارس الحكومية ولكنها أقل في أعداد الطلاب وأكثر كفاءة من المدارس الحكومية الرسمية نظراً للدعم المالي المتوفر، وهناك مدارس اللغات التي تدرس نفس المناهج باللغات الإنجليزية أو الفرنسية أو الألمانية وهي تسير على النظام التعليمي المتبع في هذه الدول، وهناك المدارس الدينية وعلى رأسها المدارس الأزهرية التي تتميز بذاتيتها في المناهج والزيادة في بعض المواد الدينية. وتعتبر القاهرة هي مهد تأسيس جامعة القاهرة كأول جامعة على النظم الحديثة، حيث تم إنشاؤها تحت اسم (الجامعة المصرية) في قصر جناكليس (بشارع القصر العيني) عام 1907 قبل أن يتم نقل الجامعة إلى مقرها الحالي بالجيزة، وتضم المدينة حالياً عدة جامعات متنوعة ما بين عريقة وحديثة النشأة منها جامعة حلوان، جامعة عين شمس، جامعة الأزهر، الجامعة الأمريكية، الجامعة الألمانية، الجامعة الفرنسية، الجامعة البريطانية، الجامعة الروسية، أكاديمية الشرطة، فرع الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم.\n\nالصحة\nالقاهرة موقع لمئات المستشفيات العامة والخاصة، ومن أشهر مستشفياتها الحديثة: عين شمس التخصصي، السلام الدولي، النزهة الدولي، دار الشفاء، دار الحكمة، كليوباترا، مستشفى العباسية للصحة النفسية، مستشفى الأمراض الصدرية بالعباسية، مستشفى 57357 لعلاج سرطان الأطفال بالمجان، المعهد القومي للكلى والمسالك البولية، ويضم شارع القصر العيني التاريخي عدة صروح صحية هي المعهد القومي للأورام، المعهد القومي لأبحاث الأمراض المتوطنة والكبد، المعهد القومي للتغذية، مستشفى قصر العيني. واختيرت المدينة أيضاً كمقر لأكبر مستشفيات إدارة الخدمات الطبية للقوات المسلحة المصرية ومنها المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحة بكوبري القبة، المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحة بالمعادي، مستشفى غمرة العسكري، مستشفى ألماظة العسكري، مستشفى الحلمية العسكري للعظام والتكميل، مستشفى العاملين المدنيين بالقوات المسلحة، مستشفى الجلاء لعائلات ضباط القوات المسلحة.\n\nالرياضة\nيوجد بالقاهرة العدد الأكبر من الأندية الرياضية الموجودة في مصر وأكثرها شعبية، بالإضافة لأكبر عدد من الملاعب والصالات الرياضية لمختلف الألعاب. وقامت القاهرة بتنظيم العديد من البطولات والدورات الرياضية الأفريقية والشرق أوسطية والإسلامية والبحر متوسطية والعالمية ومن أبرزها كأس الأمم الأفريقية لكرة القدم 1986، دورة الألعاب الأفريقية 1991، بطولة العالم لكرة اليد للرجال 1999، بطولة العالم للأسكواش للرجال 2006، كأس الأمم الأفريقية لكرة القدم 2006، بطولة العالم لكرة اليد للرجال للأندية 2007، كأس العالم تحت 20 سنة لكرة القدم 2009، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للرجال 2010، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للسيدات 2010، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للرجال 2016، بطولة العالم لكرة السلة للشباب تحت 19 سنة 2017، كما ستستضيف كأس العالم لكرة اليد في عام 2021. من أشهر أندية القاهرة النادي الأهلي، نادي الزمالك، نادي الجزيرة، نادي الزهور، نادي هليوبوليس، نادي الشمس، نادي السكة الحديد، نادي المقاولون العرب، نادي النصر، وادي دجلة. ومن أهم الصروح الرياضية في القاهرة ستاد القاهرة الدولي الذي تأسس في عام 1955 واكتمل بناؤه عام 1960 وافتتحه الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر في احتفالات ثورة يوليو في نفس العام، وسمي باستاد ناصر، إلى أن غير الاسم الرئيس محمد حسني مبارك ويعد من أكبر الصروح الرياضية في الشرق الأوسط وأفريقيا وبه مجمع لألعاب الصالات الصالات، وفي عام 2015 احتل المركز الـ 26 في قائمة أفضل ملاعب العالم بناءً على عدة معايير أبرزها السعة الجماهيرية وتاريخ الإنشاء والهندسة المعمارية، وذلك بجانب ملاعب كرة القدم الشهيرة مثل ملعب الكلية الحربية، ملعب 30 يونيو «ستاد الدفاع الجوي».\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيصل محاور وأحياء ومناطق القاهرة ويربطها بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر شبكة طرق ومواصلات ضخمة، يدار أغلبها باستخدام إشارات المرور الإلكترونية وتراقب بكاميرات المراقبة، وتخدم يومياً ملايين المواطنين. تضم تلك الشبكة عدة كباري وجسور بالإضافة إلى خطوط السكك الحديدية وقطارات الأنفاق جنباً إلى جنب الحافلات العامة وسيارات الأجرة. ويربط المدينة بباقي مدن العالم ميناء القاهرة الجوي الذي يعد المطار الأهم والأكبر في مصر.\n\nميناء القاهرة الجوي\nميناء القاهرة الجوي أو مطار القاهرة الدولي هو مطار دولي يقع على مسافة 22 كم شمال شرق مدينة القاهرة، وتبلغ مساحته حوالي 40 مليون متر مربع. يعود تاريخ إنشاء المطار إلى عام 1942 وافتتح بشكله الحديث في عام 1963، ويعتبر البوابة الجوية الرئيسية لمصر، فيما يعد ثاني أكبر مطار في قارة أفريقيا من حيث الحركة الجوية بعد مطار كيب تاون بجنوب أفريقيا. يمثل المطار حوالي 40% من الحركة الجوية بمصر ويرتبط بـ 91 مطار في مختلف أنحاء العالم من خلال خطوط الطيران المختلفة. تبلغ الطاقة الاستيعابية للمطار حالياً 22 مليون راكب سنوياً، ويستخدمه أكثر من 60 شركة طيران من مختلف دول العالم، وعشرة شركات للشحن الجوي، بالإضافة لرحلات الطيران العارض ويقوم على إدارته وتشغيله شركة ميناء القاهرة الجوي. اختير المطار كأفضل مطارات أفريقيا لعام 2006 من قبل اتحاد شركات الطيران الأفريقية وذلك من خلال استقصاء أجراه الاتحاد عن تطوير المطارات الأفريقية من حيث الأداء والبنية التحتية والتحديث المستمر. ازدادت أهمية المطار خاصة بعد انضمام شركة مصر للطيران إلى تحالف ستار وتحول مطار القاهرة إلى مطار محوري يربط بين أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط وأوروبا، وذلك لتجميع ركاب الترانزيت والانطلاق بهم إلى جميع مطارات العالم. يضم المطار ثلاثة مباني للركاب مبنى رقم (1) سعته 6 ملايين راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (2) سعته 3.5 مليون راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (3) سعته 11 مليون راكب/سنوياً، بالإضافة إلى مبنى الرحلات الموسمية وسعته مليوني راكب/سنوياً، كما يضم أربعة مدارج لإقلاع وهبوط الطائرات.\n\nالنقل النهري\nبدأ استخدام الأوتوبيس النهري عام 1961 كوسيلة مواصلات ولأغراض الرحلات النيلية القصيرة، وفي 1 مارس 2016 تم افتتاح مشروع التاكسي النهري من القاهرة إلى المعادي، على أن يبدأ خط سير التاكسي النهري من مرسى نادي اليخت بكورنيش المعادي مروراً بثلاث محطات هي منيل الروضة، جاردن سيتي، وصولاً إلى التحرير كمرحلة أولى، بحيث يتم مد المشروع ليغطي باقي مناطق القاهرة الكبرى. يعمل التاكسي النهري حالياً بشكل تجريبي لأغراض نقل الركاب والسياحة والرحلات وذلك للحين الانتهاء من إجراءات ترخيص المراسي من محافظتي القاهرة والجيزة. وترتبط القاهرة بباقي محافظات مصر بعدة خطوط ملاحية نهرية تتمثل في خط القاهرة/أسوان، خط القاهرة/الإسكندرية، خط القاهرة/دمياط. تتمثل أهمية النقل النهري من منطلق أنه أكثر وسائل الانتقال أماناً لقلة الحوادث مقارنة بوسائل النقل الأخرى نظراً لانسيابية الحركة، ولعدم وجود تقاطعات مرورية كما أنه صديق للبيئة وكذلك يتمتع بمعدل استهلاك وقود منخفض والقدرة على نقل الشحنات ذات الأحجام الكبيرة والتي لا يمثل عنصر الوقت والسرعة أهمية كبيرة في نقلها.\n\nالسكك الحديدية\nتعتبر محطة سكك حديد القاهرة «محطة مصر أو محطة رمسيس أو محطة باب الحديد» من أقدم محطات السكك الحديدية الموجودة في العالم حيث تعد سكك حديد مصر هي أول خطوط سكك حديد يتم إنشاؤها في أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط والثانية على مستوى العالم بعد المملكة المتحدة حيث بدأ إنشاؤها في خمسينيات القرن التاسع عشر، وبدأ تشغيلها في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل، ويقوم على تشغيل المحطة الهيئة القومية لسكك حديد مصر التي تعرف اختصاراً باسم (س.ح.م) وهي شركة تمتلكها الحكومة المصرية بالكامل. خضعت المحطة إلى عملية تطوير شاملة على مرحلتين تضمنت ترميم واجهة المحطة الرئيسية التاريخية، وتجديد صالة كبار الزوار ومكتب شرطة السياحة ومكتب ناظر المحطة، بالإضافة للأرصفة الرئيسية الأربعة والساحة الخارجية للمحطة، وتم فتح عدد من المحلات التجارية ومكاتب لبعض البنوك ومول تجاري يضم أنشطة تجارية وخدمية وترفيهية ومقاهي بهدف زيادة عائدات المحطة السنوية، بالإضافة إلى إعادة تصميم البهو الرئيسي وتطوير صالة التذاكر لتصبح صالة إلكترونية، وزيادة القدرة الكهربائية للمحطة، وتم تزويد المحطة بماكينات لصرف تذاكر القطارات من خلال بطاقات الدفع مقدماً، مع إمكانية الحجز عن طريق الكمبيوتر وبطاقات الصرف الآلي، مما أدي إلى تقليل الزحام على شباك التذاكر. وتم إضافة نصب تذكاري في البهو الرئيسي للمحطة على هيئة هرم نصفه الأعلى مفرغ لرؤية هرم داخلي وآخر بلوري يضم قائمة بأسماء شهداء ثورة 25 يناير، وزودت المحطة ببوابات أمنية إلكترونية وشبكة مراقبة بالكاميرات. وصلت تكلفة تطوير المحطة إلى 160 مليون جنيه، وقام بإعداد المخطط العام والتصميمات والرسومات الهندسية للمشروع المركز الهندسي للخدمة العامة بكلية الهندسة بجامعة الإسكندرية.\n\nالترام\nيعود تاريخ ترام القاهرة أو ترام مصر الجديدة إلى ثمانينات القرن الماضي، حينما قرر البارون إمبان المهندس البلجيكي إنشاء مصر الجديدة، وكانت فكرته حينها بتدشين ترام يجوب الشوارع الفارغة ليجذب إليها المواطنين، وتولت شركة مصر الجديدة للإنشاء والتعمير مسئولية تعمير المدينة الجديدة وتوفير البنية التحتية من كهرباء ومياه وكذلك إدارة الترام. كان الترام يمر بـ 16 محطة وشهد انكماشاً في عدد المحطات حتى وصلت حالياً إلى 8 محطات فقط متمثلة في 3 خطوط. يعد الترام وسيلة مواصلات سهلة واقتصادية، ما يجعله الخيار الأنسب لمحدودي الدخل. وبين الحين والآخر تنتشر أخبار عن إلغاؤه بهدف توسيع الطرق التي يمر بها لتقليل معدل التكدسات المرورية، فيما تنفي المصادر الحكومية تلك الأخبار وتصرح بنيتها لتطويره وتحديث العربات لتقديم خدمة أفضل للمواطنين.\n\nقطارات الأنفاق\nتحتل القاهرة المركز السابع عالمياً بين أكثر مدن العالم ازدحاماً مما دعا الحكومة المصرية لاتخاذ إجراءات موازية لتحسين شبكة المواصلات لكي تتماشى مع الزيادة السكانية بالمدينة وتستطيع أن تغطي متطلباتها، فبدأ التفكير في مشروع مترو الأنفاق كأحد حلول الأزمة المرورية بالعاصمة المصرية. بدء تنفيذ المرحلة الأولى من الخط الأول عام 1982، وانتهت في 1 أكتوبر 1987 والمرحلة الثانية في 12 أبريل 1989 ليربط المنطقة الصناعية وجامعة حلوان بالمنطقة التجارية بوسط القاهرة ومنطقة شمال شرق القاهرة، حيث وصل حتى المرج بطول 42.7 كم، ويرتبط الخط تبادلياً بخطوط السكك الحديدية الرئيسية للوجه القبلي والبحري عند محطة الشهداء (مبارك سابقاً) وبخط السويس / إسماعيلية عند محطة عين شمس وبخط المرج / شبين القناطر / قليوب عند محطة المرج، ويبلغ عدد محطات الخط 34 محطة منهم 5 محطات نفقية، وبقية المحطات سطحية. وبسبب الزيادة للسكانية ومشاكل النقل العام بدأت الحكومة المصرية التفكير في دعم مترو الأنفاق بإنشاء خط ثاني يربط القاهرة بمحافظتي الجيزة والقليوبية ويربط محطة سكك حديد شبرا الخيمة مع محطة سكك حديد الجيزة. فأنشئ الخط الثاني من محطة شبرا الخيمة إلى الجيزة مروراً بمحطة الشهداء «رمسيس» ومحطة السادات «التحرير» التبادلية أيضاً. وتلبية لمطالب النقل الكثيفة تم تنفيذ المرحلة الأولى والثانية والثالثة من الخط الثالث لمترو الأنفاق ليربط شرق القاهرة بغربها، مع تبادل الخدمة مع القطار الكهربائي الخفيف LRT في محطة عدلي منصور المركزية، ومع الخط الأول في محطة جمال عبد الناصر ومع الخط الثاني في محطة العتبة، وذلك بهدف خفض المرور السطحي لوسائل النقل الأخرى بما يعادل مليوني رحلة/يومياً، ووفر زمن الرحلات خلال العام بقدر 564 مليون ساعة لجميع وسائل النقل.\n\nسيارات الأجرة\nاشتهرت سيارات الأجرة بالقاهرة باللونين الأبيض والأسود. ثم أنشئ جهاز تاكسي العاصمة لإدخال سيارات حديثة إلى شوارع القاهرة تعمل إلى جانب التاكسي القديم وتستخدم تعريفة ركوب محددة، وتميزت تلك السيارات باللون الأصفر. وذلك حتى بدأت محافظة القاهرة مشروع إحلال وتبديل سيارات التاكسي القديم بأخري حديثة تتميز باللون «الأبيض» عن طريق جهاز تاكسي العاصمة، وبالتعاون بين محافظة القاهرة ووزارتي البيئة والمالية وعدد من الجهات التنفيذية. ويعتبر تاكسي لندن «الأسود» الذي ظهر في القاهرة عام 2010 من أفضل سيارات الأجرة بالمدينة، رغم ارتفاع أسعاره نسبياً، إلا أنه موجه في الأساس لخدمة السائحين ورجال الأعمال. وبسبب تطور الخدمات التقنية وانحدار خدمة التاكسي «الأبيض»، ظهرت في أواخر عام 2015 شركات تستخدم السيارات الخاصة في الأغراض التجارية لنقل الأفراد بأجر، وذلك باستخدام تطبيقات الأجهزة الذكية.\n\nحافلات النقل العام\nيقوم على تشغيل حافلات نقل الأفراد بالقاهرة هيئة النقل العام التابعة لمحافظة القاهرة والتي قامت منذ عام 2010 بالبدء في تحديث أسطولها من الحافلات وقامت بطرح أوتوبيسات جديدة اختير لها اللون الأحمر، وسحب الأوتوبيسات القديمة ذات اللون الأخضر والأخرى ذات اللون الأبيض. كما قامت بإدخال أوتوبيسات أخرى جديدة للخدمة في عام 2016، اختير لها اللون الأزرق. وفي عام 2015 تسلمت القاهرة 600 حافلة نقل عام مقدمة كمنحة من دولة الإمارات لتطوير أسطول هيئة النقل العام بالقاهرة بقيمة إجمالية 550 مليون جنيه، والتي روعي في تصنيعها التمتع بمواصفات الخدمة الشاقة وأن يتم تصنيعها بنسبة 50% في مصر والنصف الآخر في مصنع للحافلات بأبوظبي بالإمارات.\n\nالطرق البرية\nيربط مناطق القاهرة عدة محاور مرورية أشهرها الطريق الدائري وهو طريق محيطي أنشئ بهدف ربط محافظات القاهرة الكبرى، وتخفيف زحام السيارات داخل القاهرة وضواحيها حيث تصل الحركة المرورية عليه إلى أكثر من 100 ألف سيارة/يوم. بدأت وزارة الإسكان في إنشاء الطريق عام 1986 وتم الانتهاء منه بالكامل عام 2005 بطول إجمالي 100 كم. وكوبري أكتوبر الذي يتراوح عرضه بين 14 إلى 34 متر ويشمل 23 مطلع ومنزل بعرض 7 إلى 8 متر، يبدأ الكوبري من الدقي ويعبر نهر النيل ويمر بمنطقة غمرة حتى يصل إلى طريق النصر. وشارع صلاح سالم الذي يعد من أكبر وأطول شوارع القاهرة، حيث تصب فيه روافد من جميع أنحاء المدينة مما يجعله محوراً رئيسياً. وطريق النصر وشارع جسر السويس. ومن أشهر ميادين القاهرة الخديوية ميدان التحرير، ميدان رمسيس، ميدان العتبة، ميدان التوفيقية، ميدان طلعت حرب، ميدان عابدين، ميدان الفلكي، ميدان لاظوغلي، ميدان باب اللوق، ميدان مصطفي كامل، ميدان محمد فريد، ميدان الأوبرا. ومن ميادين القاهرة القديمة ميدان السيدة زينب، ميدان السيدة عائشة، ميدان السيدة نفيسة. ومن ميادين منطقة مصر الجديدة والقبة ميدان العباسية، ميدان حدائق القبة، ميدان روكسي، ميدان تريومف، ميدان المحكمة، ميدان الجامع، ميدان الكوربة، ميدان هليوبوليس. ومن ميادين مدينة نصر ميدان الساعة، ميدان رابعة العدوية.\n\nالمسافة بين القاهرة والمدن المصرية\nفيما يلي جدول المسافة بالكيلومتر بين مدينة القاهرة وبعض المدن المصرية:\n\nمشاكل المدينة\nالعشوائيات\nتعد مشكلة العشوائيات من مشكلات المدينة المعاصرة التي نمت أوضاعها مع الزيادة السكانية التي شهدتها المدينة منذ الستينات، وما صاحب ذلك من تغيرات اجتماعية واقتصادية أدت إلى استمرار تزايد معدلات الهجرة من الريف إلى القاهرة مما أسفر عن معدلات طلب متزايدة بسوق العقارات يقابلها نقص في عدد الوحدات السكنية المطروحة، فظهرت على السطح مشكلة المناطق العشوائية التي تنوعت ما بين مساكن الإيواء المؤقت، ومساكن وضع اليد المشيدة على أراضي مغتصبة، والمساكن المشيدة بتقاسيم غير معتمدة أو بدون تراخيص قانونية. ونتيجة لتفشي تلك الظاهرة بالقاهرة وعدة مدن مصرية أخرى، بدأت الحكومة المصرية في التعامل معها عن طريق عدة محاور منها التطوير من خلال موازنة الدولة، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع جهات دولية، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الجمعيات الأهلية ورجال الأعمال والمجتمع المدني، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الوزارات ذات الصلة بأماكن التطوير.\n\nالتلوث\nتتعدى نسبة تلوث هواء القاهرة بالأتربة المؤشرات الدولية بـ 7 مرات، وصنفها المؤتمر السنوي الـ 11 للجمعية المصرية للشعب الهوائية والصدر والحساسية القاهرة كثالث أكثر مدن العالم في معدل تلوث الهواء بعد مدينتي «نيومكسيكو» المكسيكية، والعاصمة الصينية «بكين». ويعود ارتفاع نسبة التلوث بالقاهرة إلى عدة أسباب منها الدخان الناتج عن حرق قش الأرز في بعض محافظات الدلتا وشمال الصعيد القريبة من القاهرة، مما يشكل ما يعرف منذ سنوات بظاهرة «السحابة السوداء»، كما تضخ المصانع بالقاهرة والمحافظات القريبة منها (الجيزة والقليوبية) والتي تصل إلى حوالي 12600 منشأة صناعية كميات كبيرة من الملوثات والأدخنة، فيما تضخ حرائق القمامة في الأماكن المكشوفة داخل القاهرة وفي المحافظات القريبة منها بالإضافة إلى عوادم وسائل النقل والمواصلات أطنان من الأدخنة الملوثة. وتقدر الخسائر المادية المترتبة على تلوث الهواء والجو في القاهرة بحوالي 10 مليارات جنيه سنوياً.\n\nالزحام\nأصبحت مشكلة التكدس المروري والزحام بالقاهرة أحد أزمات المدينة اليومية، وخصوصاً خلال ساعات الذروة. وكشفت دراسة حديثة عن أزمة المرور بالقاهرة صادرة عن البنك الدولي بالاشتراك مع المعهد القومي للنقل التابع لوزارة النقل أن الزحام المروري في القاهرة يتسبب في خسائر سنوية للدولة تقدر بحوالي 50 مليار جنيه، بما يعادل %4 من إجمالي الناتج المحلي السنوي للدولة، تشمل تكاليف الوقود والآثار الصحية الناتجة من سوء نوعية الهواء والحوادث، بجانب التأخير في الانتقال والوصول. وأضافت الدراسة أن متوسط السرعة على الطرق الرئيسية في القاهرة تتراوح بين 15 و40 كم في الساعة. وتعود تلك المشكلة إلى عدة عوامل أهمها الزيادة السكانية غير المخطط لها، وبالتالي لم تتمكن الشوارع العامة من استيعاب تلك الأعداد وتحقيق سيولة مرورية مقبولة، إهمال صيانة الطرق الرئيسية وتوسيعها ودعمها بأنظمة مرورية حديثة وتخطيط أماكن للانتظار، عدم وجود حارات خاصة لحافلات النقل العام ومقطورات النقل الثقيل، عدم تطبيق قواعد المرور بحزم، ضعف سلوكيات القيادة، انتشار الباعة الجائلين بالميادين والشوارع، ظاهرة المواقف العشوائية، قلة ساحات انتظار السيارات سواء السطحية أو متعددة الطوابق.\n\nأعلام المدينة\nمحمد رفعت، رائد قراء القرآن الكريم في مصر، من مواليد 9 مايو 1882 بحي المغربلين.\nطلعت حرب، رائد الاقتصاد

          "content": "## Overview\nCairo (pronounced KY-roh; Arabic: القاهرة al-Qāhirah) is the capital of Egypt (until the New Administrative Capital is completed) and, with a total population of Greater Cairo metropolitan area in excess of 16 million people, one of the largest cities in both Africa and the Middle East (the regions which it conveniently straddles). It is also the 19th largest city in the world, and among the world's most densely populated cities.\nOn the Nile river, Cairo is famous for its own history, preserved in the fabulous medieval Islamic city and Coptic sites in Old Cairo — with historic Cairo inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The Egyptian Museum in the city centre is a must see, with its countless Ancient Egyptian artefacts, as is shopping at the Khan al-Khalili bazaar. No trip to Cairo would be complete without a visit to the Giza Pyramids and to the nearby Saqqara Pyramid Complex, where visitors will see Egypt's first step pyramid built by the architect Imhotep for the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser.\nThough firmly attached to the past, Cairo is also home to a vibrant modern society. The Midan Tahrir area situated in downtown Cairo, built in the 19th century under the rule of Khedive Ismail, has strived to be a \"Paris on the Nile\". There also are a number of more modern suburbs including Ma'adi and Heliopolis, while Zamalek is a quiet area on Gezira Island, with upmarket shopping. Cairo is best in the autumn or spring, when the weather isn't so hot. A felucca ride on the Nile is a good way to escape from the busy city, as is a visit to Al-Azhar Park.\n\n## Districts\nGreater Cairo is vast; with more than 20 million people (2018), it's the largest metropolitan area in Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## Understand\nCairo is on the Nile, and has ancient origins in the vicinity of the Pharaonic city of Memphis. The city started to take its present form in 641 CE, when the Arab general Amr Ibn Al-Ase conquered Egypt for Islam and founded a new capital called Misr Al-Fustat, \"the City of the Tents\". The legend is that Al-Ase, on the day he was leaving to conquer Alexandria, found two doves nesting in his tent. Not wanting to disturb them, he left the tent. Upon returning victorious, he called his soldiers to pitch their tents around his, and this became the site of the new city in what is now Old Cairo. The name may have been a pun – Misr/Masr is the Arabic word for city, but it is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt. The Tunisian Fatimid dynasty captured the city in 969 CE and founded a new city, Al-Qahira (\"The Victorious\") just north of Al-Fustat. Al-Qahira gave the city its English name, Cairo, but the locals still call it MàSr (مصر), which is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt (similar to Mexico City in Mexico).\n\n## Climate\nThe best time to visit Cairo is during the winter from November to March, when daytime highs mostly stay below 26°C (79°F), with night time lows around 10°C (50°F) with occasional rain showers clearing the air, but still, you do not need an umbrella, even the rainiest months of the year rarely top 10 mm (0.4 in).\nIf visiting during winter, be aware that not all buildings are equipped with heaters, including some hotels and hostels. Visitors should always pack a few warm jumpers (sweaters) and a warm jacket for evening wear. In Cairo, in indoor buildings without air-conditioning, temperatures are about 15°C (59°F) in the coldest winter days and about 34°C (93°F) in the hottest summer days.\nThe brief spring from March to May can be pleasant as long as there are no sand storms, but summer temperatures, on the other hand, can reach a searing 38°C (100°F). In September and October, the period of late summer and early autumn, farmers burn rice husks to ash after sunset near Greater Cairo and this makes the air smokey.\n\n## Orientation\nToday's Greater Cairo is a city with at least 20 million inhabitants (2018), where skyscrapers and fast food restaurants nestle up to world heritage monuments. Cairo used to be the designated name of the city on the eastern bank of the Nile, and this is where you'll find both the modern Downtown, built under influence of French architecture, today the centre of commerce and popular life, as well as historic Islamic and Coptic sights.\nOutside the core on the eastern bank, you'll find the modern, more affluent suburbs of Heliopolis and Nasr City near the airport, and Ma'adi to the south. In the middle of the Nile is the island of Gezira and Zamalek, where many embassies exist. On the western bank is lots of modern concrete and business, but also the great Giza pyramids and, further to the south, Memphis and Saqqara. The city might seem like a lot to handle, but give it a try, and you will find that it has a lot to offer for any traveller.\n\n## By car\nDriving in Cairo is not recommended or necessary. The traffic is, at the least, overwhelming for the common traveler. The driving has a consistency, but not in any official way. Road signs, lanes, right-of-ways, etc. are not adhered to, and there are a large number of junctions and flyovers. Traffic signals exist in only a few locations and are routinely ignored. However, sometimes police officers are directing traffic at busy intersections. In downtown Cairo, drivers will sometimes bump other cars that are blocking their way. Also, do not be upset if your side-view mirror gets hit. At night, many drivers do not use headlights, so use extra caution or avoid driving at night. In Egypt, vehicles travel on the right side of the road. Instead of making a left turn, you will often need to make a U-turn and backtrack, or you can make three right turns.\nParking houses or official parking spots are rare. Cars may be parked two or three deep on the side of the road, and will often be left unlocked, and out-of-gear, so they can be moved. In many places, people work to look after parked cars. A small tip is expected for this service. You can also use valet parking.\nTo get to Alexandria, the North Coast, the Delta and the Western Desert drivers should take the Cairo - Alexandria Desert Road from the Mewhwar Road- 26 July corridor from Downtown Cairo.\nTo get to Beni Sueif, Fayoum, Assyut, Luxor, and Aswan, drivers from Downtown should take the Sixth Of October-Fayoum exit at the Remaya Roundabout beside the Giza Pyramids at Le Meridien Hotel, to the Fayoum turn off at the Fayoum - Sixth Of October junction, 6 km (3.7 mi) from Remaya Roundabout.\nTo get to Suez, Port Said, and Ismailia, drivers from Downtown should take the Ring Road to the Suez Road junction for Suez, and the Ismailia junction off the Ring Road for Ismailia and Port Said.\nTo get to Hurghada, and Ain Sukhna, drivers from Downtown, should take the Ring Road to the New Ain Sukhna Toll Road at Kattamaya.\nTo get to Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba, Ras Sidr, Al-Arish, and Rafah on the Sinai Peninsula, drivers from Downtown, should take the Ring Road to the Suez Road junction at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, through the Ahmed Hamdy Tunnel, on to the Sinai Peninsula.\n\n## By plane\n30.1191431.400731 Cairo International Airport (CAI  IATA) (in Heliopolis, to the northeast of the city around 15 km from Cairo's city centre). The busiest airport in Africa with more than 16 million passengers per year, it is also the largest in Egypt and is the main hub for the flag carrier EgyptAir and Nile Air as well as several other airlines and the primary entry point to the country.      (updated Jan 2018)\nCairo airport has frequent flights from other Egyptian cities, the Gulf states and Levant, and usually daily flights from the European and North African capitals. There are direct flights from Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Mumbai, New York, Washington D.C, Tokyo and Toronto but travel from the Far East or North America will usually involve a change.\nThe main operator is EgyptAir (the national carrier) and its Star Alliance partners Aegean, Air China, Asiana Airlines,   Austrian Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, ITA Airways[dead link], LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, Turkish Airlines.\nSkyTeam is represented by Air France, China Eastern Airlines,  KLM, Middle East Airlines, Saudia, and TAROM. Oneworld by British Airways, Iberia, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, and Royal Jordanian. \nOther Carriers include Aeroflot, Afriqiyah Airways,\nAir Algérie,\nAir Montenegro,\nAlexandria Airlines, AlMasria Universal Airlines, Emirates, Etihad, \nFly Baghdad,\nGulf Air, \nHainan Airlines, Iraqi Airways, Jordan Aviation[dead link], Kuwait Airways, Libyan Airlines, Neos, Nesma Airlines, Nile Air, Nordwind Airlines[dead link],   Oman Air, Petroleum Air, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, Rossiya Airlines, Saudia, SCAT Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, Smartwings, Sudan Airways, SunExpress, Syrian Air[dead link], Tunisair, and Yemenia. There are also budget carriers Air Arabia, Air Cairo, AJet, \nEurowings, \nflyadeal,   flynas, Jazeera Airways, Transavia[dead link], and Vueling.\nThe airport has three terminals. EgyptAir and all Star Alliance members (Lufthansa Group, Singapore Airlines, LOT, etc.) operate all flights to Terminal 3, which is integrated with Terminal 2 (British Airways, Air France, and some others) through an air bridge. Most other airlines arrive at Terminal 1, like Saudia (Terminal 1 Hall 2), and Sky Team, Oneworld, Emirates, and Etihad (Terminal 1 Hall 1). All terminals offer a reasonable variety of duty-free shops and restaurants. In Terminal 1 there are some duty-free shops opposite the gates, with more shops on the first floor. The lounges, a pub, McDonald's and coffee shops such as Starbucks are on the second floor. Terminal 3 has a central market place and food court, plus some shops and cafes along the concourses. There's not much open seating, as most seating is in the gate lounges which only open an hour before departure. This is okay when flights leave on time, but when there are delays the concourse becomes congested while lots of empty seats lie inaccessible beyond the lounge plate-glass.\nA free shuttle bus runs between the terminals and to the bus station every 15-30 minutes, 24 hours a day. At Terminal 3 its stop is at the arrival level on the second island at the end of the bus lane (turn right after the exit and cross the first lane). At Terminal 1 you must leave through the main exit and turn left to get to the station. The Shuttle Bus stops are at Hall 3 in front of the AirMall and at Hall 1 at the curbside. The bus stops are not marked. Sometimes you have to change buses at the bus station due to the driver's coffee break. Taxi drivers will try to lure you at the airport by misinforming you about the free shuttle bus, but if you go outside the terminal, you will find it.\nVisitors are allowed to buy duty-free articles on arrival, up to 4 extra litres of alcohol. At the checkout, a customs official will check your passport and give approval for the purchase. You can be accompanied by the person picking you up. It's fine if you expect to consume what you buy, or treat friends, but there's sometimes a racket where the local person gets you to buy up to your limit on his behalf— he'll pay you fairly for the extra.\nYou should exchange some money in the airport — it is best to do this before going through customs. Get some change in the process (smaller than the usual LE200 notes), as taxi drivers and others will always claim to be unable to give change. ATMs for all major cards are available in the arrival halls. Visas are available before immigration, for US$25. When arriving at terminal 3, everybody immediately starts queuing to buy visas from one of the bank counters on the left side. It seems these banks often don't accept cards or even Egyptian pounds (LE), which is problematic if you arrive with limited hard currency. There's an ATM on the other side of the area in this case, as well as an exchange office that also sells visas, and accepts Egyptian pounds as currency. So just go there to buy the visa, ignoring the bank counters, and avoiding the queues.\nPublic buses to Midan Tahrir (read the warnings about the district) or Midan Ramses runs from the airport bus station, which is connected to the terminals by the free Shuttle Bus (see above). The 356 (٣٥٦) bus is running to both in 2025. The services definitely running in 2018 are the 111 (١١١, direction Shobra, passes by Midan Ramses), and the LE8. These run every 30 minutes and take 60–120 min depending on traffic. Buses 27 (٢٧) and 400 (٤٠٠) may also run.\nOnce you arrive at the airport bus terminal, look for a bus by explaining where you want to go; for the downtown terminal you can say \"Abdel Moneim Riad\", pronounced \"Adbel Moneem Riad\", and someone should direct you on to a bus.\nBuses from downtown to the airport run from the bus terminal Abel Moneim Riad just north of the Egyptian Museum (under the highway bridge). If the stop's not obvious, ask for the airport or in Arabic the word is \"matar\" (مطار).\nScheduled buses no longer run directly from the airport to Alexandria or other delta cities. Either negotiate a taxi transfer or go downtown for onward transport.\nWhite meter taxis are available at the terminals. Insist on using the meter. Do not accept a fixed price as this tends to be double the fare by meter. Report taxi drivers who refuse to use the meter to Airport Security or Tourist Police. Refuse to pay the \"ticket\" (airport parking fee) for the driver. If you are going to downtown Cairo, you may be able to share a taxi with other tourists or backpackers. Have small notes available, mostly the taxi driver will claim not to have any change, but they actually do have. Another option is to use transportation arranged by your hotel or hostel, though this service is often not complimentary.\nMost Egyptians who can afford it use Uber taxis, as they have fixed rates. From the beginning of Al-Haram (Giza area around the pyramids) to the airport costs LE200-300, depending on the time and type of car (Jan 2023). Careem is also readily available, prices might be a bit cheaper than Uber, to downtown Cairo, cost was around LE150 (November 2023). inDrive is also available.\nThere are numerous limousine services. Pick-up points are in front of the terminals (curbside). The prices are fixed depending on the destination and the car category. Category A is luxury limousines (Mercedes-Benz E-Class), Category B are Micro Buses for up to 7 passengers and Category C are mid-sized cars (e.g. Mitsubishi Lancer). London Taxis are available from Sixt as a new Category D.\nThere is a planned metro Line 3 extension to the airport, but construction has not started as of Jan 2023.\nWhen returning to the airport from downtown, allow at least two hours to get here, and 3 hours from Giza, as the roads can be very congested. The new airport road connects the airport with the intersection of the Ring Road and Suez Road and has no traffic jams. If you depart on Friday morning or mid-day, the trip to the airport will be quick, as roads are deserted while people go to the mosque for Friday prayers.\nUpon arriving, you must pass through a security checkpoint before you can access the ticketing & check-in area. You'll need a printout of your itinerary or ticket to show the security staff here. After checking-in you will pass through a second checkpoint (including passport control) to get airside, then there's a third just before boarding your aircraft - only then can you restock on water. Allow plenty of time for all this, as lines can be long. There is no left-luggage room at the airport.\nThe airport is on the north-eastern outskirts of the city at Heliopolis. If you want to spend the night at the airport, there are three hotels available:\nNovotel Cairo Airport, H0502@accor.com. (updated Mar 2017)\nLe Passage (formerly Iberotel), cairo@jaz.travel.\nLe Meridien Cairo Airport, Reservations.03265@lemeridien.com.\nThere are other lodging options in nearby Heliopolis.\nBorg el Arab (HBE IATA) near Alexandria has far fewer flights and poor ground connections.\n30.10972230.8944442 Sphinx International Airport (SPX IATA). As of 2025 it is served mainly by budget airlines, including Air Arabia, Air Cairo, Condor, EasyJet, Edelweiss Air, Flydubai, Flynas, Jazeera Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Pegasus Airlines, SalamAir and Wizz Air.   (updated Jun 2024)\n30.07583331.8333333 Capital International Airport (CCE IATA). The airport in the New Administrative Capital sees very limited flights. As of 2025 it has only seasonal charter services operated by Smartwings.    (updated Jun 2025)\n\n## By train\nCairo is the hub for railways in Egypt, almost all trains start and terminate here. The governmental Egyptian National Railways[dead link] (السكك الحديدية المصرية‎), often abbreviated as ENR, operates all trains. One exception is the private company Watania that operates high-end trains between Cairo, Luxor and a few other cities.\nThere are up to 30 departures per day from Alexandria, with the fastest trains called Specials running non-stop at 2 hr 40 min. Express trains are slightly slower at around 3 hours. These trains are clean and comfortable, air-conditioned, and with snacks available. Some will variously refer to these fast trains as \"Spanish\", \"French\" or \"Turbo\" because of their rolling stock.\nTravelling along the Nile to and from Aswan and Luxor is very popular. At least one daytime and one overnight train per day offers superior quality and is generally recommended for tourists. Journey time is 10 hours from Luxor and another four from Aswan. Ordinary trains ply the same route, some commence in Alexandria, but they are much less comfortable with hard seats and squalid toilets. Lights stay on all night and you'll probably be woken several times for ticket checks.\nNumerous 3rd and 2nd class trains operates to and from most cities in Lower Egypt and along the Mediterranean coast to and from El Alamein.\nThe most common way of getting tickets is to buy them in advance at stations. However, buying tickets in advance via a booking agent or from Abela Trains assures your seat and avoids hassle at stations. Since 2022, foreigners pay a hefty premium to ride Egyptian trains, and prices are typically 10x higher than the local price. If you are on a budget, consider a bus.\nAlmost all mainline trains from Cairo run from the main railway station, Ramses. However, in a few years time - around 2023 - a new major station, Bashteel, will be completed. As of 2022, it is not known how it will affect the other stations.\n30.06361131.2472224 Cairo Ramses railway station (محطة رمسيس) (Shohadaa (Martyrs) metro station), ☏ +20 2 2575-3555. The main railway station, also known as Misr Station (محطة مصر). Restaurants and shops are available, however there's no left luggage facility. Allow time to get through the multiple security queues. Notice that the ticket office has multiple windows for different classes and destinations, so check that you are in the correct line. Departure and arrival boards in the main concourse and on platforms scroll between Arabic and English, rather slowly.   (updated Sep 2020)\n30.00538431.2080095 Giza railway station (Omm El-Misryeen metro station). Not particularity near the pyramids, but Giza serves as a major hub for the city's southern parts. Most trains from Upper Egypt call here.    (updated Sep 2020)\n30.066331.18876 Cairo Bashteel railway station. New major station under construction, expected to open in 2023.      (updated Mar 2023)\n30.13099131.31917 Cairo Ain Shams railway station (Ain Shams metro station). Small station where slow trains to and from Suez terminate.    (updated Sep 2020)\n\n## By bus\nThe large red, white and blue public buses cover the entire city and are much cheaper, costing LE4-6, but are usually crowded and slow. However, there are the similar air-conditioned buses that charge LE7-12. They can be found in the main squares in Cairo. Also found in main squares are the smaller mini-buses that are usually orange and white or red, white and blue. Because of problems with sexual harassment women travellers are advised only to take the small minibuses and buses which prohibit standing. On minibuses, the fare starts at LE5 and goes up to LE15 depending on the length of the route.\nApart from the main bus stations, buses can be hailed from street-level. Buses are seldom marked with destination, instead passengers shout out (or use a number of sign-language like hand codes) their destinations and if the bus goes this place it will stop. Travellers unfamiliar with Cairo can ask bus drivers or passengers to let them know where there stop is. Simply politely blurt out the name of your destination to the bus driver or a friendly looking passenger and they will take care of you.\nLate night bus riders: bus frequency, length of route, and in some cases, fees can vary during the late evening hours onward. In some cases, a route may terminate, without notice, short of your destination. When this takes place, locals rely upon private citizens hoping to make some additional money, to get them to their final destination. As always, use caution, if you should choose to accept private transportation. Since many mini-buses will not depart until the bus is nearly full, you should be prepared for a lengthy period of time, while the driver waits for enough people to board.\nThere are a number of major bus stations (mawqaf موقف, pl. mawaqif مواقف) throughout the city. One of the largest is conveniently located behind the Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir. There are actually two stations - the main bus station for the city buses, and the minibus station behind it. There are also bus stations in Midan Ramses, under the overpass. Buses run from Ramses to Heliopolis, City Stars Mall and other destinations not covered by the Tahrir bus station.\n\n## Get around\nYou will find that it's useful to have several maps handy if you are looking to get around Cairo on your own. Spellings of street and place names can vary from map to map and from map to actual location, and not every street will appear on every map.\n\n## By metro\nCairo is home to Africa's first and most expansive metro system. While Cairo's metro system is modern and sleek, the three lines are all too limited in scope. The rolling stock is modern on line 3 (and sometimes 2) with AC. And line 3 (the most recent one) is operated by RATP Dev, a subsidiary of RATP, the French operator of the Paris metro.\nAs of October 2024, a single trip ticket ranges from LE8-20, depending on the number of stations covered:\nLE8: up to 9 stations (yellow ticket)\nLE10: 10-16 stations (green ticket)\nLE15: 17-22 stations (purple ticket)\nLE 20: more than 23 stations (beige ticket)\nIt is a crowded subway, but no more than Tokyo, Paris or London. If you are used to the metro in big cities and/or can deal with the crowding (be extra careful to avoid pickpocketing), it is the best way of avoiding traffic jams while travelling.\nThe key interchanges are Shohadaa (Martyrs) (formerly Mubarak) at Midan Ramses, Sadat at Midan Tahrir, and Attaba (Ataba; عتبة).\nYou'll need to be assertive (but not stroppy) when trying to buy tickets - Egyptians don't queue. First get your small change ready in a quiet area, so you're not fumbling with wallet and big notes and dropping your passport amidst the crowd. Then steadily press through the crowd to the ticket window, as they are doing. If you intend to make a return or future trip, buy multiple tickets, so you only have to scrummage once. There are ticket vending machines available, though sometimes they're low on change.\nThe Cairo Metro has stations in Dokki and Maadi, among other places. To reach the Giza Pyramids, take the metro to Giza town then pick up a bus or taxi for \"Al-Haram\". You can also reach Heliopolis (Masr el-Gedida) using line 3, at the stations: Al Ahram (Korba) and Koleyet El Banat (Merghani). The extension of this line to the airport was due in 2020 but still isn't finished yet. As of June 2025, line 3 has one branch ending in Adly Mansour. The station to the airport is still under construction.\nTwo cars in the middle section of each train are reserved for women. One of them is for women only till 9PM, while the other is for women all the time. The metro stops running at around 12:20AM and starts up again around 5:15AM. There are no timetables for lines 1 and 2, but departures are very frequent. Line 3 runs every 8 minutes.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis in Cairo are solid white. They are equipped with meters but these are not always used. They can be hailed from the street, and are common enough to be used perhaps exclusively (given a little patience) by any traveler.\nTaxis usually expect more money for ferrying more people. If you decide not to negotiate the price beforehand (this is the better method) be ready to jump ship and/or bargain hard if the cabbie brings up the fare after you are in the car. They rarely accept more than 4 people to a taxi.\nDo not let the taxi driver choose you. You choose him and always look confident as if you use them regularly. Flag one down, hop in and always sit in the back of the cab. Try not to get into any discussion with the driver. Simply state your destination and look out the window. Ignore any chat if you can. Egyptians do not chat with drivers on the whole. Avoid eye contact especially in the mirror.\nDo not confirm the fare before getting in, ordinary Egyptians do not do that. As a tourist, you might prefer to state a price beforehand, which may prevent ripoffs, but will require you to quote above local prices. Instead the correct sum is paid through the window after leaving. You simply step out of the cab, with no discussion of the price (unless the taxi driver thinks you've given them an unfair price). If you are obviously a tourist with your Lonely Planet Guide, North Face backpack, and are wearing shorts then you can sometimes expect an argument even if you have offered the correct price. Either pay them more to keep the peace (odds are they need the money more than you) or just walk away. As long as the driver does not leave the car, you are alright. If this happens, consult someone nearby. Try to avoid those loitering outside 5-star hotels and restaurants to minimise this. Using a big hotel as your destination may also inflate the price.\nTaxi drivers may try to pressure you into taking an expensive tour with them instead of a cheap ride.\nIf you feel unsafe, such as if the driver drives recklessly, tell the driver to slow down. If he does not do this immediately, ask him to stop and simply get out and walk away, but be careful not to end up at a remote place where it would be dangerous and difficult to find another thing to ride. Never continue travelling in any vehicle which you deem to be unsafe, especially in the dark on unlit roads, or in single track highways where overtaking is dangerous.\n\n## By ride-hailing service\nIt's preferable to use Careem, inDrive or Uber rather than regular cabs. Locals consider them cheaper and safer (especially for women). Just get a local SIM card and you'll be fine. You can also find the app price, get a screen shot, and use that to negotiate with cabs.\nCareem. Smart phone app offers address based routing and calculates price according to them. You need an Egyptian phone number (e.g. from a local SIM card) to use Careem. (updated Oct 2025)\ninDrive. Smart phone app offers address based routing and allows you to negotiate a price with multiple drivers. (updated Oct 2025)\nUber Cairo. Smart phone app offers address based routing and calculates price according to them. (updated Mar 2021)\n\n## By bicycle\nCairo is generally not safe for cycling. A small bike sharing system called Cairo Bike does exist.\n\n## Disabled access\nAccess in Cairo is patchy. Anyone with moderate to serious mobility issues should expect to spend a lot of time in taxis.\nMany buildings have step-only access. Pavements are variable, even around the popular tourist attractions. There is often an incredibly steep drop from the curbs and where there are ramps they are better suited to pushchairs than wheelchairs. Expect potholes, gulleys, poorly cordoned-off building works and street works, and cars parked across the pavement, where there is a pavement at all.\nThe white stick is recognised and help is often offered. The help that is offered can be a little misguided at times but it's usually well intentioned.\nAlthough more expensive by far, it is probably best to arrange taxis for major trips (such as visiting the pyramids) via your hotel. Picking up a taxi on the street can be hit and miss. Do not expect to be dropped off at the exact spot that you asked for; you will often be taken to somewhere nearby. Always fix a price before you get into a taxi.\nConcessions on tickets cannot be taken for granted. For example, the Egyptian Museum offers a 50% concession for disabled patrons (and students) whereas the Cairo Tower doesn't offer concessions at all.\nA visit to the pyramids is a must. How one does it is either through one of the many stables around the site or taking a taxi to the Sphinx entrance and attempting to walk. The site is amazingly up and down. A good level of mobility would be required to attempt it by foot. If you opt for a horse/camel ride, make sure that you haggle hard. (July is the quiet season, when it may be possible to get a 2-hour camel ride for less, albeit when you're with someone who knows the owner of the stables).\nIf you are visually impaired or in any other way disabled it may be possible to gain permission to touch the pyramids. The outside of the pyramids are usually off limits to tourists and surrounded by a cordon. To arrange permission to touch a pyramid, approach one of the many tourist police dotted around the site. (Since the revolution with decreased tourism it is a lot easier to do things like climb on the pyramids, go inside the Sphinx fence or inside the pyramids - for a charge!)\n\n## See\nCairo is a vast metropolitan cityscape. It includes an array of modern skyscrapers, mosques, bazaars and ruins of associated ancient monuments outside the city.\nCairo has an overwhelming array of attractions, listed under their individual districts along with transport and other practicalities. Some highlights:\nPyramids of Giza and the Sphinx. The oldest and only surviving monuments of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it is the country's most famous tourist attraction.

Also, see the weird Bent Pyramid there and hike around the area to the Black Pyramid. The Red Pyramid has an entrance to the inside, which you can climb down.   (updated Jan 2018)\nAlso, the pyramids of Saqqara and Memphis offer an easy day trip out of Cairo.\n\n## Coffee and shisha\nHave a coffee, mint tea or Cola at El Fishawy's coffee shop in Khan El-Khalili. Smoke a shisha water pipe (try the \"double apple\" flavor) and watch the world go by. Great cheap entertainment.\n\n## Felucca\nRide a felucca along the Nile River. A great way to relax and enjoy a night under the stars in Cairo. Feluccas are available across from the Four Seasons Hotel in Garden City. Pay after your ride, or you may get much less than you bargained for. Public boats with loud noisy music and a giggling crowd are also available for 1/2 hour, but are very uncomfortable.\n\n## Parks\nCairo has a shortage of parks, but a few of them exist.\nThe most famous is the Giza Zoo, which is in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in Giza. This is one of the oldest zoos in the world, opened in 1891.\nHadiqat Al Orman (English: Al Orman Gardens), Giza. This is a fairly large park near the Giza Zoo. It can be entered by paying a daily ticket at the gate. It contains a variety of trees and flowers and is a nice place to escape the noise and traffic of the city. However, it may be very crowded with locals, especially on weekends and public holidays like Eid.\nHadiqat Al Azbakiya (English: Al Azbakieya Gardens). Another nice park to enjoy the greenery and scenery of trees and gardens, while remaining inside the city. It is located in the Azbakiya area of Cairo, and the best option is to take a taxi.\nGenenet El Asmak (English: Garden of the Fish), Zamalek. A nice park, which also includes several large caves containing water aquariums, where you can see different species of fish and underwater life through glass windows. Like other parks, a very cheap ticket enables you to enter and enjoy the day there.\nMerryland (Arabic: Genenet El Merryland), in Heliopolis district near Roxy Cinema. Again, another park with trees and gardens and nice scenery, and there are restaurants and cafes in the park.\nEl Hadiqa El Dawliya (English: the International Garden),  in Nasr City district. It was opened when Nasr City district was built in the 1960s. Sections of the park contain copies of famous buildings from around the world (i.e. the Eiffel Tower of Paris, Great Wall of China, the windmills of Holland). The copies are much smaller of course, similar to small statues. Interesting to see.\nAl-Azhar Park - has restaurants and entertainment available. It has a good vantage point of Islamic Cairo and the city skyline.\nYou can also take a stroll along the Corniche el-Nil, and there is a river promenade on Gezira Island.\nDesert Park. Wadi Digla Protected Area is a 60-km² environmentally protected park near Ma'adi, that offers opportunity for taking a trek, jogging, rock climbing, and cycling. Wadi Degla is also a good spot for bird watching, and viewing the various reptile species, plants, and deer that reside there. You can take a cab from Ma'adi to the entrance at Wadi Delga. Cab drivers in Ma'adi should know where to go.\n\n## Recreation\nOther options for relaxation include visiting the Giza Zoo and the Cairo Botanical Gardens, or watching horse racing at the Gezira Club in Zamalek, or, when you need a break from city life, try a round of golf on the famous Mena House Golf Course overlooking the Pyramids, or The Hilton Pyramids Hotel tournament golf course and nearby Sixth Of October City, Ten minutes drive from Giza Pyramids.\nOr if the family, and especially children are fed up looking at monuments and museums, a 10-minute trip from the Giza Pyramids by micro-bus, taxi, or car, will take you to two of the biggest and best theme parks in Cairo, Dream-park, and Magic land, both in nearby Sixth Of October City.\nMagic land is also part of The Media Production City complex, including The Mövenpick Hotel, where visitors can take a tour of the Egyptian TV and drama sets, and studios which house many of the Egyptian and other Arabic TV stations.\n\n## Shopping\nCitystars is Egypt's premier shopping mall and is quite comparable to a foreign mall. It offers most international brands and most international food chains. It offers a cinema and amusement park. Mall of Arabia is a brand new spacious shopping mall in the suburb of 6 October City. It is Cairo's other premier shopping destination, featuring many of the same American and European clothiers as Citystars.\n\n## Sports\nFootball: The national soccer team play at Cairo International Stadium in Nasr City 10 km east of the centre. Half the club teams in the Premier League, Egypt's top tier, are based in Cairo, so there will be several top-flight matches on any weekend October to April. Choose from Zamalek (also based at International Stadium), Al Ahly, Pyramids, Future, National Bank, ENPPI, Ceramica Cleopatra, El Geish, Al Mokawloon and East Company.\nHorse riding in the desert from one of the Nazlet El-Samaan stables such as FB Stables (contact Karim +20 106 507 0288 or visit the website) in Giza. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out over night with a barbecue and fire. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, FB Stables is also great for a 'tourist' type ride to view the Pyramids from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Seer can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and full moon rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivaled views over the Pyramids - a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light show.\n\n## Music and culture\nSufi dancing - The Al Tanura Troupe offers free performances every Saturday, Monday and Wednesday night at 8:30PM (7:30PM during winter) at the Al-Ghouri Mausoleum. This picturesque place is situated nearby the Khan el Khalili souk, on a narrow street between the Al Azhar and Al Ghouri mosques.\nThe Culture Wheel (الساقية Al-Saqia). The largest independent cultural centre in Cairo, offers concerts almost every night.\nThe Garden Theater. In Al-Azhar Park offers a range of musical performances. The venue is also a great place for an evening stroll.\nCairo Opera House. It hosted the Cairo International Film Festival in 2012 and screened some international films with very cheap subsidized ticket prices.\nEgyptian Centre for Culture & Art (MAKAN). Egyptian Traditional music.\nThe Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art, Hussein El Me'mar Pasha street, ☏ +20 2 2 576 80 86, info@thetownhousegallery.com. Sa-W 10AM-2PM, 6-9PM, F -9PM, Closed Th.\nCairo Jazz Club, 197, 26th July Street, Agouza, Giza (From Zamalek, just before Sphinx Square), ☏ +20 2 2 3345 9939. Daily 5PM-3AM. Live entertainment from local and international musicians, a great food and beverage menu (happy hour from 7-9PM) and a relaxed atmosphere. 7 nights a week.\nHousaper theater (مسرح الهوسابير), El Galaa St, Kulali (near Ahmed Oraby Metro Station, behind the hospital of Egypt railway). Mostly erroneously known and spelled as Hosabeer. A small theater which hosts cultural plays and concerts for independent artists.\n\n## Learn\nInternational House Cairo (ILI), Mohandesin. Offers courses in Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian dialect up to an intermediate-advanced level in an international student environment. Teachers are professional and prices relatively low. (updated Apr 2020)\nKalimat Language and Cultural Centre, 22, Mohamed Mahmoud Shaaban St., Mohandessin, ☏ +202 761 8136, +202 337 5814. This is a great language school with a lot of friendly teachers and students from around the world. (updated Apr 2020)\n\n## Work\nThere are many thousands of people from South East Asia, China, and the Far East working low-paying jobs in factories and similar places. They're hired because they're cheaper than hiring locals.\nSome well-to-do families also like to hire foreign workers to work in their houses as cleaners, housekeepers etc. The majority come from poorer African countries or places like the Philippines and Indonesia.\nIf you come from the West however, the situation may be very different depending on your qualification. The most demanded are those who come from native English speaking countries (i.e. the UK, USA, Canada, Australia). The most demanded jobs for these people are English teachers at schools and some university professors. There are many foreign schools in Cairo and some other big cities that prefer to hire native English speakers as part of their school staff. The reason is obviously the ability to teach English with a native accent and more importantly their foreign qualifications. Other opportunities may arise in similar institutions if your native language is French, less if it's German, and even less if it is some other European language.\nThere is some demand for Russians also in nightclubs, and hotels. The tourism industry in general may be willing to hire foreigners from European backgrounds to work in countless diving centres and small business around the Red Sea area in Dahab, Hurghada, and Sharm El Sheikh, where many tourists come from Europe to take diving courses in their native language (German, Dutch, French, Italian, Russian, English, Polish) and other languages being the most popular.\nThe American International School in Cairo (AIS), (2 locations in 6 October City Sheikh Zayed) and Fifth Settlement (EL Tagamoa El Khames ) the two being on the Western and Eastern corners of the city.\nCAC (Cairo American College) in Maadi, with a long history of American curriculum and American/Foreign staff, and foreign students.\nThe American University in Cairo\nCanadian International College\nGerman University in Cairo (GUC)\nFor other kinds of jobs, the best option is to have a technical background or previous managing experience in a multinational company and get transferred to the local branch of the company in Egypt.\nOther opportunities include teaching English as a free-lance instructor, but it may take a while before you are able to gather enough students to make a good living. Many people in Egypt want to learn English or improve it as it is always demanded in the Egyptian market.\nIf you have professional qualifications there are many possibilities for work in Cairo. Try any of the local employment or job websites:\nCareer Mideast, one of the oldest job websites in the country, serving the entire Middle East Region, even other countries\nBayt you will find jobs in the entire Middle East including Egypt in all sectors\nThe American Chamber of Commerce website (they have a comprehensive database of all kinds of jobs in all sectors and industries)\nWazayef Masr (it can be easily found on Google search)\nThere are several employment fairs that take place every few months in Cairo. Most of them are free to attend by anyone looking for a job. They usually are advertised in English adverts in the Arabic newspapers such as Al Ahram newspaper. The ads are easy to spot as they are large picture advertisements and written in English, even though the newspaper is in Arabic. They normally take place in well-known places like large five star hotels or the City Stars shopping complex. Examples include Job Master Job Fair, Wazayef Masr Job Fair, and the American Chamber of Commerce Job Fair. You can meet lots of different employers, with mostly multinational companies based in Cairo and other local well-known Egyptian companies. Most recruitment teams at the fairs speak fluent English. You must bring your cv/resume as most employers expect you to apply for a job on the same day, then you will be called for an interview a few days/weeks later if they have a suitable vacancy. Take at least 20-30 copies, one for each employer and dress semi-formally or formally.\nAnother option is any of the foreign embassies located in Cairo.\nYou can also try the English weeklies al-Ahram and al-Waseet for job vacancies. Otherwise, if you have some connections, you can always network with people that you know, and sometimes it may lead to landing a job somewhere.\nEgyptian work conditions may be very different from Western ones. It is more of a friendly casual environment, but everybody is still treated with respect. Working hours are normally 9AM-5PM, and the weekend is Friday and Saturday (Friday substituted for Sunday because it is the day that Muslims go to pray at the mosque). Annual leave is normally 21 days, and most national holidays are days off as well.\n\n## Buy\nATMs are found in various places throughout downtown. A more secure option are the ATMs in the five star hotels. There also are numerous places that handle currency exchange, or you can try any major bank such as HSBC or Commercial International Bank.\nForeign currencies can also be exchanged for Egyptian pound in all the Egyptian banks like Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt[dead link], Banque de Caire[dead link], Arab African Bank[dead link], the United Bank[dead link], or the large branches of Bureau de Change.\nMany merchants will try to scam you out of as much as they possibly can. A particularly common trick are the papyrus museums. They come in many different flavours, but they often call themselves galleries, museums or workshops. You will be given a brief talk or demonstration on how papyrus is made, and warned against cheaper shops that make their papyrus from banana leaf (though no matter where you go, no one has a sample to show you, questioning the legitimacy of this \"warning\"). The prices will be in the hundreds, and you will be offered what appears to be an excellent discount. If you look around, however, you will see most of what they offer is worth very little. Tour guides, taxi drivers and hotel staff are all in on this, and will often get a 50% commission if they lead an unwitting tourist into this trap.\nThe Khan El-Khalili bazaar is a giant souq in Islamic Cairo. The merchants here are ravenous and skilled, so don't fall for the hard sell and be prepared to haggle. This is a great place to buy rustic glassware and perfume bottles. Be choosy.\nZamalek has a number of small, but high-end shops, along with shops selling crafts, jewelry and other items. Fair Trade Cairo in Zamalek is a great shop selling high quality crafts made by local artisans. Nefertari, also in Zamalek, has wonderful organic cotton linens, skin care products, and the like. There is also Nomad, that has a small, charming second floor showroom in Zamalek, as well as Nagada, and Khan Misr Taloun. Diwan, in Zamalek, is a very nice primarily English-language bookstore.\nMidan Talaat Harb and surrounding streets, including Talaat Harb Street, are home to countless shops, selling everything from shoes and books to sweets.\nThe Midan Ataba area in Downtown Cairo is home to large bookseller markets, where you can find inexpensive books, as well as electronics and clothing markets, but be aware of the over crowding, as it is easier to pickpocket.\n\n## Eat\nCairo has an enormous number of restaurants, catering to most needs. Ironically though, one may want to avoid any restaurants listed in popular guidebooks. Egyptian restaurants have a habit of after being listed, cooking up a special English menu with vastly inflated prices. That said, cheap food can be found everywhere in street restaurants and snack stalls. The top notch restaurants are often, but not always, found in hotels and Nile boats. The borders between restaurants and cafes are not crystal-clear in the Egyptian capital. In many places it is perfectly acceptable to just have a drink or sheesha. Medium and high-range outlets might have a minimum charge. Cheaper restaurants will normally not serve alcohol as well as some more expensive outlets.\nIn general, downtown is good for budget eating, while for higher quality eating you should head to Zamalek, Mohandiseen or any of the other more affluent parts of town.\n\n## Egyptian and Middle Eastern food\nTraditional Egyptian staples are available almost everywhere. In stalls and street restaurants you will find traditional dishes like fūl (bean paste), falāfel, moussaka, koshari (rice, macaroni, lentils, chick peas and tomato sauce), feTīr (pancakes with different fillings) and shawarma (an import from Lebanon and Syria — pieces of roasted meat usually wrapped in bread). Cheaper places will only serve up vegetables and maybe beef hot dogs or corned beef. Eggs, fried potatoes and salads are also usually available. Hygiene varies wildly and the best advice is to go for the most visited places. Avoid empty restaurants as the food will be less fresh. Especially downtown, you can find many good koshari shops, including many outlets of the excellent Koshari Tahrir chain. Delicious and cheap fūl, falāfel, and shawarma sandwiches can be bought at the many outlets of popular Gad fast food chain dotted around Cairo.\nIn the medium and upper price range your choice of traditional Egyptian food will be more limited. Although the situation is improving, traditionally Egyptian gastronomical experiences are still mostly restricted to private homes. Quality chain restaurants like Felfela (several outlets), Abou El Sid (Zamalek, Maadi and Dokki), Cairo Kitchen (Zamalek and Maadi), and Abou Shakra offer authentic Egyptian food.\nOtherwise oriental or Middle Eastern restaurants tend to mix styles or completely go for more Lebanese-style eating, considered more stylish by rich Cairenes. The good side of this is that Cairo is blessed with many quality Lebanese outfits, from chains like Dar Al-Qamar to stylish restaurant establishments. Additionally, Turkish food and restaurants catering to Gulf visitors can be found.\n\n## Western and Asian food\nCairo has a number of Western fast food outlets available. McDonalds, Hardees, Pizza Hut, and KFC[dead link] are spread about the city, but they are relatively more expensive. Most of these also offer free wireless internet.\nLighter meals like sandwiches and salads as well as pastries can be found in western-style bakeries and cafes. Popular chains like Cilantro, Beanos and Costa as well as individual outlets all offer more or less similar dishes. Most of these places also offer free wireless internet.\nMaison Thomas has several branches throughout Cairo, including Mohandiseen, Zamalek, and Maadi, and serves some of the best pizza in Cairo. If you prefer more stylish international dining, Cairo offers a wide variety: Italian, Chinese and Japanese outlets in addition to the ambiguous continental cooking abound, especially in areas like Zamalek, Mohandseen and Dokki.\n\n## Hygiene and diet issues\nFor health reasons it is advisable not to drink tap water or eat unpeeled fresh fruits and vegetables—at least for the first few days of the visit. There are few solely vegetarian options, L'aubergine in Zamalek is a good restaurant for vegetarian food. Otherwise, Egyptian cuisine is dominated by vegetable courses, but be aware of \"hidden\" meat in stock, sauces and the like. One should also be cautious about frozen drinks or ice creams sold outside of main hotels. Also, if served eggs, one should be cautious to ensure that they are fully cooked (sunny side up eggs may allow certain organisms to be transmitted).\n\n## Self-catering\nThe Metro chain and Alfa Market dotted around Cairo are convenient supermarkets. They often stock Western brands. Otherwise vegetables and fruit are plentiful and cheap. Bakeries such as The Bakery chain sell western-style bread and pastries. Organic food from the local ISIS brand is available at the supermarkets Metro and Carrefour and the Sekem Shop in Ahmed Sabri Street (شارع احمد صبر), Zamalek.\nBy far the cheapest and most satisfying option, buying from souks and outdoor markets makes for a crash course in Arabic and haggling, not to mention that the produce is often superb! Bread can be found on nearly every corner and comes in two types - whole wheat aysh baladi and white flour aysh shami. Both are baked fresh daily and delivered by thousands of kids on bicycles to every corner of the city. Every neighborhood has a few streets dedicated to produce and other goods. Always wash fruit thoroughly before eating. Eating a fresh Roma tomato in the heat of Summer straight from a market seller after being washed is a delight, hard to match. The fruits and vegetables in Egypt may not conform to EU or US standards of size, but their taste is far superior.\nSmall bakeries (furne) sell every kind of baked good imaginable - ranging from Italian style bread sticks with nigella and sesame seeds to croissants, donuts and anything with dates in it. Fresh goods from these bakeries offers a nice alternative to the standard Egyptian breakfast of beans, beans, and beans, as well as the fact that this bread is very cheap.\n\n## Drink\nCairo has a wide range of drinking options from the very traditional to fashionable and modern. At the other end of the scale, almost any street in Cairo has a traditional coffee house, ´ahwa, a traditionally male institution of social life tracing many hundreds of years back in history. Besides that you'll find everything from fruit stalls to patisseriés and bakeries and modern cafés whipping up all varieties of modern European coffee. In addition to the traditional Turkish coffee and shai tea, virtually everywhere you'll find drinks like hibiscus tea kerkedeeh, served warm or cold depending on season, sahleb, a milk-based drink usually served in winter, fakhfakhenna (a kind of fruit salad), sugarcane juice, mango and tamarind juice, Tamr hindi.\n\n## Traditional coffee houses\nCairo remains one of the best cities in the world to sample the traditional coffee house culture of the region. They are called maqhâ in Standard Arabic, but in the local dialect this is turned into ´ahwa. The Turkish coffee remains an invariable ingredient in any Cairene coffee house, and water pipe (sheesha) and tea is even more popular. While considered \"old fashioned\" for a time, these places are again turning fashionable among younger crowds and even smoking a water-pipe is no longer a male-only pastime. Places vary from just a small affair—plastic chairs and tables put out on the street—to more elaborate cafes especially in upscale and tourist areas.\nFor many, the sheesha or water pipe, is the main attraction of any visit to a Cairene coffee house. It is usually available in at least two varieties, mu´assal, pure tobacco, and tofâh, apple-flavored. Other fruit varieties are sometimes available. Coffee houses range from the more elaborately decorated to a simple counter and some plastic chairs and tables spread out in the street. Foreigners are invariably made welcome, although women might feel uncomfortable visiting coffee houses in traditional, poor areas of the city. However, in downtown and the tourist areas of Islamic Cairo single or women-only groups should not expect anything more than the ordinary hassle.\nTurkish coffee (´ahwe turki) is served either sweet (helwa), medium sweet (masbout), with little sugar (sukr khafeef) or no sugar (sâda). Sweet means very sweet. Tea (shai) is served either as traditional loose tea (kûshari, not to be confused with the Cairo macaroni-rice stample kushari), known as dust tea in English, or in a tea bag. Most coffee shops usually offer fresh mint leaves to put in your tea, upon request. A range of soft drinks are usually available. Most typically you will find hibiscus tea (karkadee), served warm in the winter season and cold during the warmer parts of the year.\n\n## Fruit juice stalls\nDuring the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed. Basically these places sell fresh-pressed juice of whatever is in season. Typical choices include orange (borto'ân), lemon (lamūn), mango (manga) and strawberry (farawla), guava (gawafa), pomegranate (Rommân). Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks.\nA health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general, food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. Some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water.\n\n## Modern cafes and pastry shops\nModern cafes and patisseries are spread out around the city. Typically they serve light food like sandwiches and salad in addition to espresso-based coffees and pastries. Many of these places are chains, like Cilantro, Beanos, Cinnabon, Orangette, the Bakery and Coffee Roastery. Most of these places, including all the chains mentioned above, offer wireless internet connection as well. International chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks are also widely available throughout Cairo.\n\n## Nightlife\nFor the capital of a Muslim country, Cairo is relatively liberal when it comes to the consumption of alcohol. A wide range of bars and dance clubs is available, basically in every major hotel, and some are open 24/7. If you would like to explore the less fancy drinking places in Cairo, Downtown is definitely the place to go. Upscale nightspots are found in and around the Zamalek area\n\n## Sleep\nCairo has a tremendous range of accommodation, from low-rent budget hotels downtown to five-star palaces along the Nile. See individual district articles for hotel listings.\nYou can also stay in an accommodation in Giza directly at an entrance to the pyramid area. Many of these accommodations have a pyramid view.\n\n## Mail\nThe main post office[dead link] of Cairo is on Midan Ataba (open Sa-Th 7AM-7PM, F and holidays 7AM-noon). The poste restante office is to be found along the side street to the right of the main entrance to the post office and through the last door (open Sa-Th 8AM-6PM, F and holidays 10AM-noon) - mail will be held for 3 weeks.\nAlways use the register mail facility to post anything valuable or important. It takes longer but each step of the journey is recorded, as many letters do not arrive at their destinations when using regular mail service.\n\n## Mobile phones\nInstead of using your phone from your home country (which often tend to carry very high roaming fees), consider obtaining an Egyptian SIM card or cheap unlocked phone. The 2 main carriers in Egypt are Orange Egypt and Vodafone Egypt, with UAE's Etisalat a growing 3rd player in the Egyptian market. Orange and Vodafone offer the best coverage, but for tourists Etisalat is the best option because it gives the most bang for your buck with minutes and seems to have the lowest calling rates abroad out of any of the three.\nYou can find mobile dealerships in every section of Cairo, and getting set up is fairly easy. You will need to bring your passport. If you don't have an unlocked phone, many shops will sell cheap older models as secondhand phones. But beware, make sure that the phone is fully functional before purchasing it, and buying a used one is at your own risk (as a good percentage of these tend to be stolen ones).\n\n## Tourist information\nThe Egyptian Tourist Authority http://www.touregypt.net has offices in Cairo City Center, 5 Adly Street, phone: 3913454, Pyramids, Pyramids Street, phone: 3838823, fax: 3838823, Rameses Railway Station, phone: 5790767, Giza Railway Station, phone: 5702233, El Manial, Manial Palace, phone: 5315587, Airport, phone: 2654760, fax: 4157475, New Airport, phone: 2652223, fax: 4164195 and Cairo International, Airport phone: 2914255 ext.2223.\n\n## Stay safe\nScams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:\nDuring politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be careful who you go with and under no circumstance let anyone push or guide you anywhere that you do not want to go! If you get lost look for the security and police officers. Many speak some English, and most know their local area very well as well as the tourist spots.\nCrossing streets is another major challenge in Cairo. Traffic lights, which only exist in a few locations, are routinely disregarded. In downtown Cairo, police officers may be controlling traffic at key intersections at busy times. Crossing the street is like playing the video game \"Frogger\", hurrying across the street one lane at a time, when there is a small break in traffic. One way to cross a street that proved to be effective is to place yourself next to an Egyptian who wants to cross the street and follow.\nAlso, when riding in a taxi, the driver may go quite fast and drive erratically. If at any time you feel unsafe, tell the driver to stop and get out.\nBe careful about wearing the jerseys of local football clubs Al Ahly and Zamalek, as violent incidents have been known to occur between the supporters of both clubs.\n\n## Emergency services\nPolice, ☏ 122.\nAmbulance, ☏ 123.\nFire, ☏ 180.\n\n## Stay healthy\nAs elsewhere in Egypt, be careful with what you eat. Raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings like mayonnaise and minced meat are particularly risky. Avoid cold salads and puddings from buffets even in the 5-star hotels just to be on the safe side. Opinions on tap water vary, but most visitors choose to stick to the bottled stuff. Large bottles of water can be purchased for LE10-20. Avoid ice in drinks, and only eat fruit with a skin you can wash or peel.\nYou may find that stomach medications you bring from home simply don't work.\nAll visitors would do well to buy from any pharmacy Egyptian brand drugs. The best and most common being Entocid and Antinal. Diarrhea and vomiting can almost always be stopped by taking 2 of these tablets with a glass of water in a few hours.\nIf symptoms persist, it is wise to consult a doctor as dehydration can come on quickly in summer.\nSmog can reach extreme levels, especially in late summer and fall before the rains. This, coupled with the summer heat, can make spending time outdoors in the summer quite unpleasant.\nMosquitos are active from dusk till dawn, and one mosquito in a bedroom can cause much discomfort by morning, so it is always wise to kill any before sleeping. A fly swatter is best as they move due to air pressure. Wear long sleeves and long trousers when out at night. When outside, sit in a breeze or in front of a fan as they do not like moving air.\n\n## Hospitals\nFor medical care, hotels usually have a house doctor on call. Any major operations are best performed outside Egypt, but the following hospitals are generally considered the best in Cairo:\nCleopatra Hospital, Heliopolis, ☏ +20 2 2414-3931.\nDar El Fouad Hospital, 6th of October City, ☏ +20 2 3835-6030.\nBackpackers will see doctors' offices dotted all around Cairo on board signs. They are speciality specific. Just look for one and then inquire. Most surgeries open after 5PM and run late till sometimes midnight. A consultation fee will give you a consultation and one follow up appointment.\nTravellers can also visit private hospitals like El Salam, Dar Al Fouad, 6 October University Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Kasr El-Eney during the day. Each has an outpatient clinic with various specialists on duty. Usually no appointment is necessary and you will be seen depending on how early you arrive.\n\n## Embassies and consulates\nAfghanistan.\nAustralia, World Trade Centre (11th Floor), Corniche El Nil Boulac (Code No. 11111), ☏ +202 2770 6600, fax: +202 2770 6650, cairo.austremb@dfat.gov.au.\nBrazil, Nile City - North Tower C – 18th Floor, Nile Corniche, ☏ +202 24619837.\nCanada, Nile City Towers, 2005 (A) Corniche El Nile, South Tower, 18th floor, ☏ +202 2461 2200, fax: +202 2461 2201, cairo-cs@international.gc.ca.\nChina, 14 Bahgat Aly Street, Zamalek, ☏ +20 2 2738 0488, fax: +20 2 2735 9459, webmaster_eg@mfa.gov.cn.

They're a good spot for an afternoon picnic away from the city.\nAlexandria can be done as a day-trip, though it deserves longer. Top sights are the new library, the national museum, and Qaitbey fortress; then enjoy a fish dinner on the Corniche and maybe a drink. The train takes about 2½ hours, see section on \"Get in by train\" above for times and fares.\nAin al-Sukhna is the closest Red Sea resort to Cairo and easily reached on a day trip. This place is growing rapidly to become the getaway for Cairo's moneyed elite. To get here, hire a taxi for the day.\nFayoum is another popular place for Egyptians to picnic. While the city offers little in itself, the Qaroon lake and Wadi Al-Rayyan both offer scenic spots for relaxing and the area also contains some of the first pyramids in history. Get there by bus and then get a taxi to drive you around for the day. It's possible to stay overnight at the scenic Tunis village.\nSiwa and Bahariyya are oases in the desert, far from the city hubbub.\nThe other major centres in Egypt, needing several days to visit, are Luxor and Aswan for antiquities, and the Red Sea resorts such as Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh.",

          "content": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.\n\nName\nAlexandria was located on the earlier Egyptian settlement, which was called Rhacotis (Ancient Greek: Ῥακῶτις, romanized: Rhakôtis), the Hellenised form of Egyptian r-ꜥ-qd(y)t. As one of many settlements founded by Alexander the Great, the city he founded on Rhacotis was called Alexándreia hḗ kat' Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον), which some sources translated as \"Alexandria by Egypt\", as the city was, at that time, in the periphery of Egypt proper (the area beside the Nile). Some of the Alexandrian and Greek populaces, e.g., Hypsicles, also referred to the city as Alexándreia hḗ prós Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ πρός Αἴγυπτον, \"Alexandria near Egypt\"). In the course of Roman rule in Egypt, the city's name was Latinised as Alexandrēa ad Aegyptum.\nAfter the capture of Alexandria by the Rashiduns in AD 641, the name was Arabicised: initial Al- was re-analysed into the definite article; metathesis occurred on x, from [ks] to [sk]; and the suffix -eia was assimilated into the feminine adjectival suffix -iyya (ـِيَّة), finally rendering the name al-ʔiskandariyya (الْإِسْكَنْدَرِيَّة).\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nRadiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th–21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000–800 BC, followed by the absence of activity after that. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian: rꜥ-qdy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there were in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater.\n\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia), as one of his many city foundations. After he captured the Egyptian Satrapy from the Persians, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In one century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\nThe Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept the city in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning (Library of Alexandria, which faced destruction during Caesar's siege of Alexandria in 47 BC), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Egyptian and Jewish. By the time of Augustus, the city grid encompassed an area of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi), and the total population during the Roman principate was around 500,000–600,000, which would wax and wane in the course of the next four centuries under Roman rule.\nAccording to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 AD, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the Roman emperor, which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the Alexandrian pogroms. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.\n\nIn 115 AD, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Diaspora revolt, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215 AD, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365 AD, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\nIslamic era\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. The city was mostly uninjured by the conquest and a new palace called Tarawus was erected in the eastern part of the city, later known as Qasr Faris, \"fort of the Persians\". Although the Byzantine emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664–665.\nIn reference to Alexandria, Ibn Battuta speaks of a number of Muslim saints that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj, who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut al-'Arshi, a disciple of Abu Abbas El Mursi. Ibn Battuta also writes about Abu 'Abdallah al-Murshidi, a saint that lived in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. Although al-Murshidi lived in seclusion, Ibn Battuta writes that he was regularly visited by crowds, high state officials, and even by the Sultan of Egypt at the time, al-Nasir Muhammad. Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on two occasions: in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer possible to enter.\nThroughout the late medieval period, Alexandria re-emerged as a major metropolis and the most important commercial port in Egypt and one of the most important in the Mediterranean. The jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela even described it as “a trading market for all nations”. Indeed, Alexandria was the outlet for all goods coming from Arabia, such as incense, and from India and South-East Asia, such as spices (pepper, cloves, cinnamon, etc.), precious stones, pearls and exotic woods like brazilwood. But it was also the outlet for goods from Africa, such as ivory and precious woods. These goods arrived in Alexandria after passing through Aden on their way to the Red Sea, then headed up the Red Sea to be unloaded in the port of Aydhab. From Aydhab, a caravan took the goods to the Nile, probably to the town of Qus. From there, the goods sailed to Alexandria. These goods then found their way to the Alexandria market alongside Egyptian products.\nThis route was the cheapest and fastest in comparison with the land routes that reached the Mediterranean from Syria or Constantinople. Latin merchants (Venetians, Genoese, Pisans, Aragonese, Provençals, etc.) thus entered this market. As early as the 12th century, the major trading cities had funduqs and consuls in Alexandria. A funduq, in this context is an area, often fortified, within the city dedicated to the community of a trading nation under the authority of a consul. The consul was responsible for adjudicating disputes between merchants of his nation, and also when a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against a merchant of their nation.The terms of this installation were often set out in treaties between the sultans and the consuls. These treaties were part of a policy pursued by the early Mamluk sultans, who encouraged the arrival of merchants from Europe in Alexandria, since this trade not only brought the sultan considerable revenue, but also enabled him to obtain supplies of wood and iron from Europe. Later, in the 14th century, the Latin trade in Alexandria was also important for the sultans, as it enabled them to obtain supplies of mameluks (slave-soldiers) often sold by Genoese merchants.\n\nAs this trade was very important to the sultans, they were keen to control the city's institutions. Indeed, in Alexandria, in addition to an Emir (governor), the sultan sent a customs inspector who answered directly to the nazir al-khas (person in charge of managing the sultan's patrimony). Customs was not only responsible for collecting customs duties, but also for the security of the port and its warehouses. Alexandria customs also played a role in commercial arbitration and was the preferred circuit for the sale of products brought in by the merchants, which took place at auction. These sales were set up to encourage the merchants to sell their products to or through the sultan, rather than selling them freely on the city's markets. Latin merchants also had jurisdictional privileges : in addition to being judged by their consul if a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against them, Latin merchants could not be judged by the qadis (civil judges) but had to be judged by the mazalim (the sultan's courts).Alexandria lost much of its importance in international trade after Portuguese navigators discovered a new sea route to India in the late 15th century. This reduced the amount of goods that needed to be transported through the Alexandrian port, as well as the Mamluks' political power. After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and it only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1820.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and, by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernise the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.\nIn July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nEuropeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalisation of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\nGeography\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. It is in the Far West Nile delta area. It is a densely populated city; its core areas belie its large administrative area. The city's geology constitutes of soil sediments, oolitic sand and clay, oolitic limestone (from the Middle Miocene), grey shelly dolomite, marly dolomite, oncolitic limestone and dolomite, and as well as shelly limestone.\n\nNotes: 2020 CAPMAS projection based on 2017 revised census figures, may differ significantly from 2017 census preliminary tabulations. The 14 kisms were reported simply as Alexandria city by CAPMAS in 2006 but given explosive growth definitions, likely informal, may have changed or may be set to change. Same area with 12 kisms existed in 1996. Kisms are considered 'fully urbanised'\n\nClimate\nAlexandria has a hot steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), virtually hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh). Like the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate than the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 °C (41 °F).\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 °C (86 °F). The average annual rainfall is around 211 mm (8.3 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)\nPort Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °C (32 °F) on 31 January 1994.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Alexandria in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Gaza City. The annual temperature would increase by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), and the temperature of the warmest and the coldest month by 2.9 °C (5.2 °F) and 3.1 °C (5.6 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nDue to its location on a Nile river delta, Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable cities to sea level rise in the entire world. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already have to be relocated before 2030. The 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that by 2050, Alexandria and 11 other major African cities (Abidjan, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the \"moderate\" climate change scenario RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5, while RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. Additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. In every single estimate, Alexandria alone bears around half of these costs. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Recent studies published in Earth's Future by the American Geophysical Union indicate that rising sea levels are causing increases in coastal aquifer levels, reaching building foundations and accelerating their corrosion and potential collapse. The study predicts that in 2025, more than 7000 buildings in Alexandria will be at risk of collapse due to these groundwater processes.\n\nAncient layout\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\n\nRhakotis\nRhakotis (from Coptic Rakotə, \"Alexandria\") was the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians.\n\nBrucheum\nBrucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times, Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal.\n\nJewish quarter\nThe Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city.\n\nTwo main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 m (200 ft) wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; the line of the great East–West \"Canopic\" street is also present in modern-day Alexandria, having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharae Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260 m-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"—a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m or 590 ft). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour.\nIn Strabo's time (latter half of the 1st century BC), the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port\", and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus.\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks which became known as \"Cleopatra's Needles\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; site unknown.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar\", which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 m (453 ft) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 AD, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\nCityscape\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\nPompey's Pillar\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 ft (27 m) high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 m3 (4,662 cu ft) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes, but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.\n\"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nCatacombs of Kom El Shoqafa\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.\n\nKom El Deka\nThe most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\n\nTemple of Taposiris Magna\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\nCitadel of Qaitbay\nCitadel of Qaitbay is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by the mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built on an area of 17,550 square metres.\n\nExcavation\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.\n\nPlaces of worship\nIslam\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi Besher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nChristianity\nAlexandria was once considered the third-most important city in Christianity, after Rome and Constantinople. Until 430, the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Alexandrian Church split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral (though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo). The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint George's Church in Sporting, Saint Mark and Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi Anárgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel and Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark and Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Collège Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\nJudaism\nAlexandria's Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.  The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010. The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Université Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\nIn September 2023, The Greek University of Patras announced that it is opening a branch in Alexandria, in a first-of-its-kind move by a Greek higher education institution.  The Greek university of Patras branch will operate two departments, one Greek-speaking and one English-speaking in the subjects of Greek culture, Greek language and Greek philosophy.\n\nSchools\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Collège de la Mère de Dieu, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, Collège Saint Marc, Écoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish-language schools in Alexandria are the most popular; those in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Forsan American School, Forsan International School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Zahran Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College (previously called English Girls' College).\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\n\nWomen\nAround the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fatāh by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.\n\nTransport\nAirports\nThe city's principal airport is currently Alexandria International Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city centre, which is now composed of 2 Terminals. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which was opened in February 2010 wherease Terminal 2 is the Brand New Terminal and was inaugurated in 2025.\n\nPort\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as Alexandria Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbour, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\nRoads\nAmong the most important are three main roads that run parallel and connect the city center to its eastern parts: Alexandria Corniche (or El-Geish Road), which is approximately 17 km long and connects the Bahary area in the west to the Mandara area in the east; Al-Horreya Road (or Abu Qir Road), about 10 km long, linking the Shallalat area in the west to the Victoria area in the east; and Al-Mahmoudia Axis, which is 23 km long and connects the Qabbari area in the west to the Abis villages in the southeast. In addition to these, there are other major roads such as Fouad Street, considered the oldest street in Alexandria, Malek Hefni Street, Suez Canal Street, Nabi Daniel Street, Port Said Street, Sultan Hussein Street, and the Ring Road. Alexandria also includes several highways that connect it to other cities, such as the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, the Cairo–Alexandria Agricultural Road, the International Coastal Road, the Al-Mashir Fouad Abu Zekri Axis, and the Kafoury–Borg El Arab Road.\n\nRail\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the centre of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\nTrams\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east.\n\nMetro\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro was due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\nCulture\nLibraries\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses—the Museion, Greek Μουσείον (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day, the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.\nThe Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\nMuseums\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum was the city's main archeological museum, focused on artifacts from its Greco-Roman period. It was opened in 1892 and was closed in 2005 for extensive renovations and expansion. The museum re-opened to the public in October 2023.\nOther museums in the city include the Cavafy Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Royal Jewelry Museum.\n\nTheaters\nAlexandria Opera House hosts performances of classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera.\n\nPoetry\nDuring the Hellenistic period, poets evolving in the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Philiscus of Corcyra, Lycophron, Alexander Aetolus, Sositheus,...) are currently known as the Alexandrian Pleiad.\nIn modern times, Constantine P. Cavafy, a major Greek poet who was born and lived in Alexandria used several themes associated with this city in his work: \"Alexandrian Kings\", \"In Alexandria, 31 B.C.\", \"Myres: Alexandria 340 A.D\", \"Kaisarion\" and \"The God Abandons Antony\". In the latter, Alexandria becomes the symbol of the life whose forthcoming loss must be faced with dignity.\n\nSports\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nAlexandria is also known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city. Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Asmat Abdel-Meguid (1923–2013), Egyptian diplomat\nSoheir Bakhoum (1947–2003), Egyptian numismatist\nConstantine P.

          "summary": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.",

          "content": "الإسْكَنْدَرِيَّة هي العاصمة الثانية لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمة محافظة الإسكندرية وأكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهة الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينة الإسكندرية الكثير من المعالم المميزة، إذ يوجد بها أكبر موانئ مصر البحرية وهو ميناء الإسكندرية الذي يمر به نحو 60% من إجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصرية، وتضم أيضًا مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة التي تحتوي على أكثر من ثمانية ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الإسكندرية القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الأثرية مثل قلعة قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمة، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الأنشطة الاقتصادية، وتنقسم الإسكندرية إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي: حي أول المنتزة، حي ثان المنتزة، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي أول العامرية، وحي ثان العامرية.\nبدأ العمل على إنشاء الإسكندرية على يد الإسكندر الأكبر سنة 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيرة ممتدة أمام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيرة أخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيرة مريوط، واتخذها الإسكندر الأكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمة لمصر لما يقرب من ألف سنة، حتى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنة 641 م، اشتهرت الإسكندرية عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية القديمة والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الإسكندرية والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل إلى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المنارة قائمة حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنة 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين أن اختيار الإسكندر الأكبر لمدينة الإسكندرية كي تكون عاصمة لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمة الأوديسة، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن أوديسيوس ملك إيثاكا، إلى مينلاوس ملك إسبرطة يسأله إن كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن أهوال الحرب وشجاعة ملك إيثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وأنه بعدما أضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيرة فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك إسبرطة: «كان في مقدورنا أن نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الأنهار».\n\nالتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nفي بداية القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، لم تكن الإسكندرية سوى قرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\" يحيط بها قرى صغيرة، يقول عنها علماء الآثار أنها ربما كانت تعدّ موقعًا استراتيجيًا لطرد الأقوام التي قد تهجم من حين إلى آخر من الناحية الغربية لوادي النيل، أو لربما كانت «راكتوس» مجرد قرية صغيرة تعتمد على الصيد ليس إلا، وعلى امتداد الساحل الرئيسي للقرية توجد جزيرة تسمى \"جزيرة فاروس\" يوجد بها ميناء يخدم الجزيرة والقرى الساحلية معًا، في ذلك الوقت كانت مصر تحت الاحتلال الفارسي منذ سقوط حكم الفراعنة والأسرة الثلاثون سنة 343 ق م، ولم تكن مصر الوحيدة الواقعة تحت احتلال الفرس، فقد كانت بلاد الشام والعراق واقعة تحت هذا الاحتلال، وفي مقابل قوة الفرس كانت قوة الاغريق في ازدياد سريع، وبدأت المواجهة بينهما في ربيع سنة 334 ق.م، واستمرت المعارك بينهما حتى دخل الإسكندر الأكبر مدينة صور ومن ثم إلى غزة حتى أتم دخول مصر سنة 333 ق م.\nبعد دخول الإسكندر الأكبر مصر وطرده للفرس منها، استقبله المصريون بالترحاب نظرًا للقسوة التي كانوا يُعاملون بها تحت الاحتلال الفارسي، ولكي يؤكد الإسكندر الأكبر أنه جاء إلى مصر صديقًا وحليفًا وليس غازيًا مستعمرًا، اتجه لزيارة معبد الإله آمون إله مصر الأعظم في ذلك الوقت، فذهب إلى المعبد في واحة سيوة، وأجرى له الكهنة طقوس التبني ليصبح الإسكندر الأكبر ابنًا للإله آمون، ولُقب فيما بعد بابن آمون،  وفي طريقه إلى المعبد مرّ بقرية للصيادين كانت تُسمى «راقودة»، فأعجب بالمكان وقرر أن يبني مدينة تحمل اسمه لتكون نقطة وصل بين مصر واليونان وهي مدينة الإسكندرية (باليونانية القديمة: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον؛ وباليونانية الحديثة: Αλεξάνδρεια)، وعهد ببنائها إلى المهندس دينوقراطيس، والذي شيدها على نمط المدن اليونانية، ونسقها بحيث تتعامد الشوارع الأفقية على الشوارع الرأسية،  وكذلك إنشاء جسر يصل بين الجزيرة والقرية أُطلق عليه \"هيبتاستاديون\"، وبعد عدة شهور ترك الإسكندر مصر متجهًا نحو الشرق ليكمل باقي فتوحاته، ففتح بلاد فارس، لكن طموحاته لم تتوقف عند هذا الحد بل سار بجيشه حتى وصل إلى الهند وآسيا الوسطى، وبينما كان الإسكندر هناك فاجأه المرض الذي لم يدم طويلاً حيث داهمه الموت بعد عشرة أيام وهو لم يتجاوز الإثنين والثلاثين من عمره.\nاتسمت الإسكندرية في مطلعها بالصبغة العسكرية كمدينة للجند الإغريق، ثم تحولت أيام البطالمة الإغريق إلى مدينة ملكية بحدائقها وأعمدتها الرخامية البيضاء وشوارعها المتسعة،  وتحوّلت في ذلك الحين إلى عاصمة لمصر، وأصبحت إحدى حواضر العلوم والفنون بعد أن شيَد فيها البطالمة عددًا من المعالم الكبرى مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية التي تُعد أول معهد أبحاث حقيقي في التاريخ، وفنار الإسكندرية التي أصبحت أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع في العالم القديم، وكانت تطل على البحر وجنوب شرقي الميناء الشرقي الذي كان يطلق عليه الميناء الكبير؛ إذا ما قورن بينه وبين ميناء هيراكليون عند أبو قير على فم أحد روافد النيل القديمة التي اندثرت، وحالياً انحسر مصب النيل ليصبح على بعد 20 كيلومتراً من أبوقير عند رشيد.\nخضعت المدينة اسميًا للرومان سنة 80 ق م، وفقًا لرغبة بطليموس العاشر، واستمر الأمر على هذا المنوال قرابة قرن من الزمن قبل أن تسقط بيد يوليوس قيصر بعد حصار الإسكندرية (47 ق.م)، عندما استغلت روما النزاع والحرب الأهلية القائمة بين بطليموس الثالث عشر ومستشاريه وشقيقته كليوبترا السابعة، وبعد عدة معارك انتصر قيصر وتم قتل أخيها، وبذلك استطاعت كليوباترا الانفراد بحكم مصر، وعلى أحد آراء بعض المؤرخين فقد تم حرق مكتبة الإسكندرية الشهيرة في ذلك الوقت في صراع يوليوس قيصر مع بطليموس الثالث عشر. سقطت المدينة بيد القائد «أوكتافيوس» الذي أصبح لاحقًا الإمبراطور «أغسطس» في 1 أغسطس سنة 30 ق م، بعد معركة الإسكندرية، وبهذا أصبحت مصر ولاية رومانية، ظلت الإسكندرية أكبر مدينة في الإمبراطورية الرومانية الواسعة بعد روما العاصمة، وأقدم الرومان على عمل العديد من الإصلاحات فيها، فقاموا بتجديد وإعادة حفر القناة القديمة التي كانت تربط نهر النيل والبحر الأحمر لخدمة التجارة، وكذلك فقد أعطى الرومان لليهود في الإسكندرية والذين كانوا يمثلون جزءًا أساسيًا من التركيبة السكانية للمدينة، حريات كثيرة وسُمح لهم بإدارة شئونهم الخاصة.\nغير أن كل ذلك لم يوقف حركات التمرد والتوتر في المدينة والتي وصف أحد الكتاب القدماء أهلها بأنهم \"الأكثر رغبة في الثورة والقتال من أي قوم آخر\"، فمن أعمال الشغب في الإسكندرية سنة 38 وتمرد اليهود سنة 116، والتوتر المتواصل بين اليهود واليونان على مسائل قديمة، فضلاً عن احتجاج السكندريون بصفة عامة على الحكم الروماني، والذي أدى سنة 215 وعلى إثر زيارة الإمبراطور الروماني إلى الإسكندرية إلى قتل ما يزيد عن عشرين ألف سكندري بسبب قصيدة هجاء قيلت في الرجل، غير أن من أهم أسباب الاضطراب هو أن العالم قد شهد أحد أهم الأحداث في التاريخ وهو ميلاد الديانة المسيحية، والتي تزامنت مع بداية الحكم الروماني في مصر، وحيث أن الديانة الجديدة بدأت تجذب الكثير من المصريين وتدعوهم إلى نبذ الوثنية وعبادة الله، فقد بدأ عصر جديد من الاضطهاد حيث كانت روما تريد فرض عبادة الإمبراطور وكذلك العبادات الوثنية على المصريين. ضربت موجة تسونامي هائلة المدينة بتاريخ 21 يوليو 365،  جرّاء زلزال وقع بالقرب من جزيرة كريت، ونجم عنها خراب ودمار كبيرين.\nاكتسبت المسيحية قوة كبيرة رغم كل النزاعات وذلك في مواجهة ديانة باقي المصريين من الوثنيين وخاصة في عهد الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الكبير (378-395) الذي أصدر مرسوماً ببطلان العبادات الوثنية، فعقد بطريرك الإسكندرية ثيوفيلوس (385-412) عزمه على تنفيذ المرسوم الإمبراطوري بدقة وحزم وقد عاونه اتباعه وقوات الإمبراطور، فتم تدمير عدد من المعابد الوثنية وتحويل بعضها الآخر إلى كنائس مثل معبد سرابيوم المقام للإله سيرابيس وذلك سنة 391 حيث شيدت على أطلاله كنيستان.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nخضعت الإسكندرية للإمبراطورية البيزنطية بعد انقسام الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى قسمين غربي روماني وشرقي رومي بيزنطي، وفي القرن السابع الميلادي كانت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية قد وصلت إلى حالة بالغة من الضعف، فشجع ذلك الإمبراطورية الفارسية الساسانية في الشرق على الهجوم على ممالكها واحتلال الشام ومصر، فدخل الفرس الإسكندرية ونهبوا المدينة وقتلوا الكثير من أهلها، لكن الحكم الفارسي لم يدم إلا بضع سنين حيث استطاع الإمبراطور هرقل استرداد ممالكه ورجعت الإسكندرية من جديد تابعة للإمبراطورية البيزنطية، وقد أراد هرقل تعيين بطريرك قوي في الإسكندرية يسند له الرئاسة السياسية بجانب سلطته الدينية ليكون قادر على قهر الأقباط وإرغامهم على اتباع مذهب المونوثيليتية فعين بطريركًا رومانيًا يدعى «كيرس» والمعروف عند مؤرخي العرب باسم «المقوقس»، لتحقيق هذه الغاية، إلا أنه فشل في ذلك، وخلال هذا العهد كان الإسلام قد برز في شبه الجزيرة العربية واستقطب أعدادًا كبيرة من الناس، وكان النبي محمد قد أرسل إلى حكام الدول المجاورة رسائل يدعوهم فيها إلى الإسلام، وكان المقوقس من ضمن هؤلاء الحكام.\n\nبعد وفاة النبي محمد، خرج العرب المسلمون من شبه الجزيرة العربية لنشر الإسلام في أنحاء العالم المعروف، فانطلق عمرو بن العاص من القدس إلى مصر، بعد أن شاور الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب، سالكًا الطريق التي سلكها قبله قمبيز والإسكندر الأكبر، واصطدمت القوة العربية بالروم في مدينة الفرما مدخل مصر الشرقي، فسقطت المدينة بيد عمرو، ثم تبعتها بلبيس، وكان المقوقس عامل الروم على مصر قد تحصن بحصن إزاء جزيرة الروضة على نهر النيل، ورابط عمرو في عين شمس، ولما وصلت الإمدادات من الخليفة عمر، تقاتل الفريقان في منتصف الطريق بين المعسكرين،  فانهزم المقوقس واحتمى بالحصن، ولمّا ضيّق عمرو عليه الحصار اضطر إلى القبول بدفع الجزية،  وتابع عمرو استيلائه على المدن المصرية ولم يبق إلا الإسكندرية عاصمة الديار المصرية وثانية حواجز الإمبراطورية البيزنطية، وكان الاسطول البيزنطي يحميها من البحر، ولكن شدّة الغارات البريّة العربية، وموت هرقل وارتقاء ابنه قسطنطين الثاني عرش الإمبراطورية وكان حديث السن، جعلت الروم يوافقون على شروط الصلح، فجلت قواتهم وأسطولهم عن المدينة ودخلها المسلمين فاتحين، وأطلقوا الحرية الدينية للأقباط وأمّنوهم على ممتلكاتهم وأرواحهم.\n\nولكن بعد مدة قصيرة من السيطرة على المدينة قام البيزنطيون بهجوم مضاد ليستعيدوا المدينة من جديد إلا أن عمرو بن العاص استطاع هزيمتهم ودخل الإسكندرية مرة أخرى في صيف سنة 646، ورحب الأقباط في الإسكندرية بقيادة البطريرك بنيامين الأول بالمسلمين ترحيبًا بالغًا وبذلك فقدت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية أغنى ولاياتها إلى الأبد، فقدت الإسكندرية مكانتها السياسية بعد ذلك بسبب اتخاذ عمرو بن العاص من الفسطاط عاصمة له بدلاً منها، لكنها استمرت الميناء الرئيسي لمصر وأبرز مرافئها التجارية، نشطت حركة التجارة في الإسكندرية خلال العهد الإسلامي، كذلك تم بناء سور جديد للمدينة، ووفد إليها الكثير من العلماء من أمثال الإمام الشاطبي والحافظ السلفي وابن خلدون وغيرهم الذين أثروا الحركة العلمية للمدينة، ومن المعالم التي تركتها المرحلة الأولى للفتح ضريح وجامع أبو الدرداء أحد صحابة النبي محمد في منطقة العطارين والذي شارك في فتح مصر.\nتعرضت الإسكندرية لحصار عُرف بحصار الإسكندرية (1174) من جانب الأسطول الصقلي كجزء من الحملات الصليبية ضد الشرق، إلا أنه فشل فشل ذريعًا، وتعرضت كذلك لعدة زلازل قوية سنة 956 ثم 1303 ثم 1323 أدت إلى تحطم فنار الإسكندرية ولم يبق منها سوى الأساس الحجري الذي شيدت عليه قلعة قايتباي في منتصف القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، كما تعرضت الإسكندرية لهجمات صليبية كان أخرها في أكتوبر سنة 1365 عانت فيها من أعمال قتل دون تمييز بين مسلم ومسيحي ونهب وضربت المساجد،  إلا أنه وفي سنة 1480 قام السلطان المملوكي قايتباي ببناء حصن للمدينة لحمايتها في نفس موقع المنارة والمعروفة الآن بقلعة قايتباي، حيث حظيت الإسكندرية في عهده بعناية كبيرة، وقد هيأت الدولة المملوكية وسائل الراحة لإقامة التجار الأوروبيين في مينائي الإسكندرية ودمياط فبنيت دور الإقامة ووضعت تحت تصرف التجار حتى يعيشوا وفق النمط الذي اعتادوه في بلادهم، وفي وقت لاحق فقدت الإسكندرية الكثير من أهميتها بعد اكتشاف طريق رأس الرجاء الصالح في سنة 1498 وتحوّل طريق التجارة إلى المحيط الأطلسي بدلاً من البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وكذلك بعد جفاف فرع نهر النيل والقناة التي كانت تمد المدينة بالمياه العذبة.\n\nالعصور الحديثة\nخضعت الإسكندرية مع باقي مصر إلى الحكم العثماني بعد انتصار السلطان سليم الأول على المماليك في معركة الريدانية ودخل مصر سنة 1517، شهدت الإسكندرية أحداثًا مهمة خلال القرن الثامن عشر تمثلت بالحملة الفرنسية على مصر ودخول الجنود الفرنسية بقيادة نابليون بونابرت الإسكندرية في أوائل يوليو 1798 بدون مقاومة تُذكر، واعتبرت الدولة العثمانية احتلال بونابرت لمصر اعتداءً عليها، ووقف الإنجليز والروس إلى جانب العثمانيين وعرضوا المساعدة على الباب العالي لإخراج الفرنسيين من مصر،  وسرعان ما التحمت القوات البريطانية مع الفرنسية في معركة الإسكندرية (1801) في معركة أدت لخروج القوات الفرنسية من مصر،  لتدخل الإسكندرية ومصر بصفة عامة مرحلة جديدة مليئة بالنهضة في جميع المجالات.\n\nتدين الإسكندرية لمحمد علي باشا بالنهضة حيث أنه أعاد للمدينة الحياة بعدّة وسائل ففي سنة 1820 تم الانتهاء من حفر قناة المحمودية لربط الإسكندرية بنهر النيل مما كان له الفضل في إنعاش اقتصاد الإسكندرية،  وقد صمم الميناء الغربي كي يكون هو الميناء الرسمي لمصر وتم بناء منارة حديثة عند مدخله، كذلك فإن منطقة المنشية هي بالأساس من تصميم مهندسيه، كما شيد محمد علي عند رأس التين مقره المفضل وأصبحت الإسكندرية هي مقر قناصل الدول الغربية مما جعل لها شخصية أوروبية حيث جذبت العديد من الفرنسيين واليونانيين واليهود والشوام بسبب الانتعاشة التي حظيت بها المدينة،  كما أنشأ دار الصناعة البحرية في المدينة والتي يطلق عليها حالياً \"ترسانة الإسكندرية\"، وذلك لتلبية احتياجات الأسطول المصري على يد المهندس الفرنسي سيريزى بك.\n\nأصبحت الإسكندرية منذ تولي محمد علي الحكم وخلال المائة وخمسين سنة التالية أهم ميناء في البحر المتوسط ومركزًا مهما للتجارة الخارجية،  ومقرًا لسكان متعددي الأعراق واللغات والثقافات، وتحت حكم خلفاء محمد علي استمرت الإسكندرية في النمو الاقتصادي، فشهدت في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل تحديداً اهتماماً يُشابه الاهتمام الذي أولاه لتخطيط مدينة القاهرة، فأنشأ بها الشوارع والأحياء الجديدة وتمت إنارة الأحياء والشوارع بغاز المصابيح بواسطة شركة أجنبية،  وأنشأت بها جهة خاصة للاعتناء بتنظيم شوارعها وللقيام بأعمال النظافة والصحة والصيانة فيها، ووضعت شبكة للصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الأمطار،  وتم رصف الكثير من شوارع المدينة، وقامت إحدى الشركات الأوروبية بتوصيل المياه العذبة من منطقة المحمودية إلى المدينة وتوزيعها بواسطة \"وابور مياه\" الإسكندرية، وأنشأت في المدينة مباني ضخمة وعمارات سكنية فخمة في عدد من الأحياء كمنطقة محطة الرمل وكورنيش بحري.\n\nتعرضت الإسكندرية خلال هذه العصر الحديث إلى الكثير من الأحداث وخاصة بعد مذبحة الإسكندرية وعند بداية الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر، حيث قام الأسطول البريطاني بقصف الإسكندرية لمدة يومين متواصلين حتى استسلمت المدينة معلنةً بداية الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر،  والذي دام لسبعين عامًا،  وتحت الاحتلال البريطاني زاد عدد الأجانب وخاصة اليونان الذين أصبحوا يمثلون مركزًا ثقافيًا وماليًا مهم في المدينة،  وتحولت الإسكندرية وقناة السويس إلى مواقع إستراتيجية مهمة للقوات البريطانية،  تعرضت المدينة لأضرار هائلة في فترة الحرب العالمية الثانية،  حيث كانت تقصفها الطائرات الحربية لدول المحور خصوصًا الإيطالية والألمانية ما تسبب في دمار ومقتل المئات واعتبرت الإسكندرية أكثر المدن المصرية تضرراً من تلك الحرب،  وبعد نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية وقيام حركة 23 يوليو 1952 أُلغيت الملكية في مصر وغادر الملك فاروق الأول آخر ملوك الأسرة العلوية إلى المنفى،  وقامت الجمهورية المصرية على أنقاض المملكة بقيادة جمال عبد الناصر الذي أعلن من الإسكندرية وبالتحديد في ميدان المنشية تأميم قناة السويس،  وقد قلت أعداد الجاليات الأجنبية في الإسكندرية بعد سياسة التأميم التي اتبعها عبد الناصر وكذلك بسبب الحروب التي خاضتها مصر مع إسرائيل، إلا أنه ما يزال هناك جالية يونانية بسيطة في المدينة. وفي 12 سبتمبر 1955 تعرضت الإسكندرية لزلزال بقوة 6.3 على مقياس ريختر، تسبب في في مقتل 18 شخصًا وإصابة 89 شخصًا حيث انهار 40 منزلًا بالكامل و420 منزلًا بشكل جزئي، وكان للإسكندرية حضور سياسي حيث استضافت مؤتمر قمة الدول العربية 1964 والذي أقُيم في قصر المنتزه بحضور أربعة عشر زعيمًا عربيًا.\n\nالمرحلة المعاصرة\nبعد بداية سنة 2011 بعشرين دقيقة حدث انفجار كبير أمام كنيسة القديسين في منطقة سيدي بشر أثناء الاحتفالات بعيد الميلاد للكنائس الشرقية، نجم عنه 24 قتيلًا (بينهم مسلمون) كما أصيب 97 شخصًا،  أحدثت هذه العملية صدمة في مصر وفي العالم كله، واتهمت وزارة الداخلية المصرية تنظيم جيش الإسلام الفلسطيني بالمسئولية عن الحادث،  واحتج كثير من المسيحيين في الشوارع وهتفوا بشعارات ضد نظام حكم مبارك، وانضم بعض المسلمين للاحتجاجات، وحدثت اشتباكات بين الشرطة والمحتجين في الإسكندرية والقاهرة.\nبعد نجاح الثورة التونسية وإسقاط نظام الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي،  انتقلت روح الثورة إلى مصر، فخرج الآلاف من الأشخاص إلى شوارع القاهرة والإسكندرية وغيرها من المدن المصرية مطالبين بتحسين الوضع المعيشي وخفض الأسعار وتحسين الوضع الاجتماعي للناس. وقد بدأت المظاهرات بالإسكندرية بمنطقة المنشية والعطارين ومحطة الرمل والمنتزه وسيدي جابر. وقد تعاظم شأنها وازداد عدد المشاركين بها مع مرور الوقت، مطالبين بتنحي الرئيس حسني مبارك، أسفرت المظاهرات التي بدأت في 25 يناير عن تنحي حسني مبارك،  فكان من شأن ذلك تهدئة الأوضاع بعض الشيء في المدينة وتفريق المتظاهرين.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة الإسكندرية شمال مصر على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط عند التقاء خط العرض 31° 11' 34.6 شمال، وخط الطول 29° 54' 17.5 شرق، وهي عبارة عن شريط ساحلي بطول حوالي 55 كم شمال غرب دلتا النيل بدءاً من أبو قير شرقًا وحتى سيدي كرير غربًا، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71.5 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي،  ومن الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير،  ومن الغرب منطقة سيدي كرير حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي ومركز ومدينة برج العرب،  والتربة في مدينة الإسكندرية سهلية منبسطة على ارتفاع -1 من مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز الإسكندرية بمناخ معتدل، إذ يسود بها مناخ البحر المتوسط والذي يتميز بصيفه الحار والجاف وشتائه الرطب والمعتدل والممطر، يمتد فصل الشتاء في الإسكندرية عبر شهور ديسمبر، يناير، وفبراير وتترواح درجة الحرارة العظمى فيه ما بين 12 و 18 درجة مئوية، وتتعرض الإسكندرية خلال هذا الفصل إلى العديد من العواصف الرعدية الشديدة والبرد والأمطار الغزيرة في ظاهرة جوية يُطلق عليها \"نوة\"، أما فصل الصيف في الإسكندرية، فيمتد عبر شهور يونيو، يوليو، وأغسطس وتترواح درجة الحرارة فيه ما بين 25 و 30 درجة مئوية،  ويتميز صيف الإسكندرية بالجفاف وارتفاع نسبة الرطوبة، أما فصلي الربيع والخريف فيعدّان أفضل وقت لزيارة المدينة، وفيهما لا تزيد درجة الحرارة العظمى عن 22 درجة مئوية باستثناء زمن الموجات الخماسينية التي تصل فيها الحرارة في أشهر الربيع إلى 32 درجة مئوية أحيانًا.\n\nالتخطيط والتقسيم الإداري\nلم يكن تخطيط مدينة الإسكندرية مختلفًا عن السابق بل كان تخطيطاً أشبه بالمدن الإغريقية القديمة، حيث كان يأخذ شكل شطرنج وهو عبارة عن شارعين رئيسيين ومتقاطعين بزاوية قائمة هما شارع «كانوبك» وشارع «سوما» وعرض كل منهما 14 متر، ومنهما تتفرع شوارع جانبية متوازية عرضها 7 أمتار،  وكان شارع «كانوبك» (شارع فؤاد حاليًا) يربط بوابة القمر من الغرب وبوابة الشمس من الشرق، ويمتد شرقًا ليربط مدينة كانوب (أبو قير)، وكان يتقاطع شارع سوما (شارع النبي دانيال حاليًا) مع شارع كانوبك ويمتد من الشمال للجنوب، وتقاطعهما كان مركز مدينة الإسكندرية.\nاتسعت الإسكندرية في القرن العشرين اتساعًا كبيرًا، وتوسّع العمران بها في الاتجاهين الشرقي والغربي خاصة، بالإضافة إلى الاتجاه الجنوبي. بالنسبة للتوسع نحو الجنوب فقد امتد العمران في منطقة محرم بك إلى ترعة المحمودية ومنطقة غيط العنب، وحاليًا توسعت المدينة نحو الشرق وساعد على ذلك وجود قطار أبو قير الذي ساعد في نمو العمران إلى مناطق سيدي بشر، المندرة، والمعمورة وصولاً إلى أبو قير،  أما التوسع نحو الغرب فشمل مناطق المكس والدخيلة والكيلو 21 وصولاً إلى سيدي كرير، حتى بلغ طول الشريط الساحلي للإسكندرية حوالي 55 كم،  كما توسعت المدينة جنوبًا حتى وصلت إلى مناطق الكافوري والعامرية وحدود محافظة البحيرة.\nتنقسم مدينة الإسكندرية حاليًا إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي:\n\nحي أول المنتزة يضم قسم أول المنتزة ويتبعه تسعة شياخات و96 قرية بتوابعها، ومن أهم مناطقه ميامي، سيدي بشر، فيكتوريا، والعوايد.\nحي ثان المنتزة يضم قسم ثان المنتزة، ويتبعه ثمان شياخات، ومن أهم مناطقه العصافرة، المعمورة، والمندرة.\nحي شرق يضم أقسام سيدي جابر، وأول الرمل، وثان الرمل، يتبعهم سبعة عشر شياخة، ومن أهم مناطقه كفر عبده، سان ستيفانو، سموحة، باكوس، وبولكلي.\nحي وسط يضم أقسام محرم بك، وباب شرق، والعطارين، يتبعهم خمسة وعشرون شياخة، وثلاثة قرى رئيسية بتوابعها، ومن أهم مناطقه الشاطبي، ومحطة الرمل، وكوم الدكة.\nحي الجمرك يضم أقسام الجمرك، والمنشية، واللبان، وميناء الإسكندرية، يتبعهم إحدى وأربعين شياخة، ويعد أقدم أحياء الإسكندرية ومن أهم مناطقه بحري، المنشية، ورأس التين.\nحي غرب يضم قسمي كرموز، ومينا البصل، يتبعهم إحدى وعشرون شياخة، ومن أهم مناطقه كرموز، القباري، وبشاير الخير.\nحي العجمي يضم قسم الدخيلة، ويتبعه سبعة شياخات، ومن أهم مناطقه البيطاش، الهانوفيل، الدخيلة، الكيلو 21.\nحي أول العامرية يضم قسم أول العامرية، ويتبعه سبعة شياخات، ومن أهم مناطقه الكافوري، مرغم، وسيدي كرير.\nحي ثان العامرية يضم قسم ثان العامرية، ويتبعه ستة شياخات، ومن أهم مناطقه كينج مريوط، والهوارية.\n\nالسكان\nيعمل سكان الإسكندرية في القطاعات الاقتصادية المختلفة مثل التجارة، السياحة، الزراعة، الصناعة، الصيد، شركات القطاع الخاص، الوظائف الحكومية، والأعمال الحرة والحرفية، ويتحدث السكان اللغة العربية باللهجة السكندرية، حيث تأثرت اللهجة والثقافة السكندرية بوجود عدد كبير من الأجانب في المدينة لأن معظم الأجانب مثل الإيطاليين واليونانيين كانوا كانوا يفضلون البقاء بالإسكندرية لتمتعها بمناخ حوض البحر المتوسط، ولعل من أبرز الكلمات الموجودة في اللهجة السكندرية كلمة \"مَنَفِيسْتُو\" ويُقصد بها الكتيبات الصغيرة جدًا التي يستخدمها التلاميذ وأصلها إيطالي، وكلمة \"جُومَة\" والمقصود بها الممحاة وأصلها كذلك إيطالي، وأيضاً كلمة \"مَسْتِيكَة\" والمقصود بها اللبان أو العلك، وأصلها إيطالي كذلك، بالإضافة إلى ذلك فهناك العديد من أحياء المدينة يعود أصل تسميتها لأشخاص أجانب عاشوا بالإسكندرية مثل لوران، جليم، سموحة، بولكلي، كرموز، راغب، ونجت، وفلمنج، كما يتحدث عدد من السكان اللهجة البدوية وهم الأفراد المنُحدرين من القبائل العربية، ويسكن أغلبهم بمناطق غرب الإسكندرية، وأيضًا العديد من الوافدين من المحافظات المصرية الأخرى والذين يتحدثون بلهجاتهم الأصلية، تعتبر الإسكندرية من أكثر المدن المصرية كثافة بالسكان نسبة إلى إجمالي مساحتها، حيث تبلغ الكثافة السكانية في المدينة حوالي 1997 نسمة للكيلو متر المربع، وبلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2024 حوالي 5,408,311 نسمة مُقسمين كالتالي:\n\nالثقافة\nتُعقد في الإسكندرية العديد من النشاطات الثقافية، السياحية، والسياسية خاصة بعد اختيارها كعاصمة الكتاب العالمية سنة 2002، وعاصمة الثقافة الإسلامية لسنة 2008، كما تُنظم المدينة العديد من المهرجانات مثل مهرجان الإسكندرية السينمائي لدول البحر المتوسط، مهرجان الإسكندرية للفيلم القصير، مهرجان الموسيقى العربية بالإسكندرية، ومهرجان الإسكندرية المسرحي الدولي، كما تنظم مكتبة الإسكندرية العديد من المؤتمرات والفاعليات والمهرجانات في المناسبات المختلفة مثل مؤتمر مكتبة الإسكندرية السنوي للمخطوطات،  مهرجان الصيف الدولي، ومعرض مكتبة الإسكندرية الدولي للكتاب، بالإضافة إلى العديد من المهرجانات الأخرى، كما تنتشر المراكز والقصور الثقافية ومراكز الإبداع والمكتبات العامة في مختلف أحياء الإسكندرية، ولعل من أبرزها مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة، مكتبة بلدية الإسكندرية، مكتبة الطفل، قصر التذوق، مركز الحرية للإبداع، قصر ثقافة الأنفوشي، قصر ثقافة سيدي جابر، قصر ثقافة أبوقير.\n\nالدين\nالإسلام\nيعتنق أغلب السكندريين الإسلام دينًا على منهج أهل السنة والجماعة، وقد انتشر الإسلام في المدينة انتشارًا كبيرًا بعد أن فتحها عمرو بن العاص في القرن السابع حتى طغى على المسيحية التي كانت سائدة قبل هذا، وتتميز الإسكندرية باحتضانها للعديد من المدارس والمنشآت الدينية الإسلامية وعشرات المساجد الكبيرة الأثرية والتي تتركز أغلبها في ميدان المساجد بحي الجمرك.\nومن أشهر المساجد الموجودة الإسكندرية مسجد أبو العباس المرسي، مسجد القائد إبراهيم، مسجد الشيخ إبراهيم، مسجد محمد كريم، مسجد الشيخ الشاطبي، مسجد العطارين، مسجد النبي دانيال، مسجد تربانة، مسجد الشوربجي، مسجد أبي الدرداء، مسجد عبد الرحمن بن هرمز، مسجد حاتم، مسجد سيدي بشر، مسجد المواساة، مسجد أحمد يحيى، مسجد البوصيري، بالإضافة إلى العديد من المساجد والزوايا المنتشرة في كافة أحياء المدينة.\n\nالمسيحية\nبعد أن أعلنت المسيحية ديانة رسمية للإمبراطورية الرومانية، أصبحت الإسكندرية مركزًا لبطريركية من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، بعد أن تقرر إنشائها في مجمع نيقية الأول سنة 451، وكان من ضمن الذين كتبوا قانون مجمع نيقة، أحد أبناء الكنيسة القبطية وهو البابا أثناسيوس بابا الإسكندرية الذي استمر على كرسيه لمدة 46 عامًا، وتُعدّ مدرسة الإسكندرية المسيحية أول مدرسة من نوعها في العالم، فبعد نشأتها سنة 190 على يد بنتينوس السكندرى، أصبحت مدرسة الإسكندرية أهم معهد للتعليم الديني في المسيحية. كثير من الأساقفة البارِزين من عِدَّة أنحاء في العالم تعلموا في تلك المدرسة، مثل أثيناغوارس، إكليمندس الإسكندري، ديديموس الضرير، وأوريجانوس الذي يُعتبر أب علم اللاهوت.\nيتبع معظم المسيحيين السكندريين الكنيسة القبطية الأرثوذكسية، وتعتبر الكاتدرائية المرقسية الكنيسة الأولى وفيها حسب التقليد رأس القديس مارمرقس الرسول، ويتبع بعضًا من المسيحيين الآخرين في المدينة كنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس، كما اعتنق عدد من السكان المذهب الكاثوليكي والبروتستانتي خلال القرن التاسع عشر عندما وصلت عدّة بعثات تبشيرية من أوروبا والولايات المتحدة إلى الشرق وعملت على نشر مذهبها، ويمثل أتباع هذه الكنائس اليوم أقلية مسيحية في الإسكندرية، ومن أشهر الكنائس القبطية في المدينة الكاتدرائية المرقسية، كاتدرائية سانت كاترين، كنيسة الأنبا تكلاهيمانوت، كنيسة السيدة العذراء ومارجرجس، كنيسة القديس سابا، كنيسة القديسين، وبطريركية الإسكندرية للروم الأرثوذكس، والعديد من الكنائس الأخرى في مختلف أحياء المدينة.\n\nاليهودية\nكانت الإسكندرية موطنًا كبيرًا للجالية اليهودية، لكنها اليوم في عداد المندثرة، خصوصًا بعد أن رحل الكثير من اليهود المصريين والأجانب إلى إسرائيل بعد قيامها، أو بسبب ترحيل البعض الآخر في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر إما لاتهامهم بالعمل الجاسوسي لصالح إسرائيل، أو بسبب الخوف من إقدامهم على ذلك، كان عدد يهود الإسكندرية في القرن التاسع عشر نحو أربعة آلاف يهودي، ووصل عددهم إلى ثمانية عشر ألفًا في أوائل القرن العشرين، وارتفع إلى أربعين ألفًا سنة 1948،  وكان نصف يهود الإسكندرية من اليهود المصريين والنصف الآخر ينقسم إلى ثلاثة أقسام أولهم اللادينو من سكان حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذين هاجروا من إسبانيا والثلث الثاني من يهود إيطاليا وشرقي أوروبا، والثلث الثالث من يهود المغرب والشرق الأوسط الذين يتحدثون العربية،  وفي أوائل عقد الثلاثينات من القرن العشرين هاجرت مجموعة من يهود السالونيك، النمسا، المجر، وبولندا إلى مصر هربًا من صعود النازية في ألمانيا،  ومن أشهر المعالم اليهودية الباقية في المدينة اليوم، كنيس إلياهو هانبي (بالعبرية: בית הכנסת אליהו הנביא)، الذي يقع في شارع النبي دانيال بوسط المدينة،  وهو مغلق حاليًا ولا يُستخدم في طقوس العبادة.\n\nالسياحة والآثار\nالمناطق الأثرية\nالمتاحف\nالقصور\nالخدمات\nالتعليم\nالتعليم قبل الجامعي\n\nتضم الإسكندرية عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس بكافة مراحلها التعليمية رياض الأطفال، الابتدائي، الإعدادي، والثانوي، وبمجالاته العامة والفنية والأزهرية، ويرتبط ذلك بارتفاع المستوى الثقافي والتعليمي للسكان خاصة فيما يتعلق بتعليم الأبناء، ففي العام الدراسي 2007 - 2008 بلغ عدد المدارس في نطاق مدينة الإسكندرية حوالي 1766 مدرسة، بها 19657 فصلاً تعليميًا، ويدرس بها حوالي 880337 طالبًا، منهم 428619 من البنات، و 451718 من البنين، ومن أهم مدارس الإسكندرية مدرسة الإسكندرية الثانوية، مدرسة العباسية الثانوية العسكرية للبنين، كلية سان مارك، مدرسة ليسيه الحرية، مدرسة سانت كاترين، كلية النصر للبنات، مدرسة النصر للبنين، كلية فيكتوريا، مدرسة رأس التين الثانوية، كلية نوتردام دى سيون، مدرسة هيلانة سياج، مدارس محمد كُريم، مدرسة سان شارل، وعدد من المعاهد الأزهرية والمدارس الرسمية والخاصة.\n\nالتعليم الجامعي\nعلى مستوى التعليم الجامعي تتميز الإسكندرية بوجود ثالث أقدم الجامعات المصرية وهي جامعة الإسكندرية، وهي جامعة حكومية يعود تاريخ إنشائها إلى سنة 1942، وكانت تُسمى في ذلك الوقت باسم \"جامعة فاروق الأول\"، وبلغ عدد الطلاب المُلتحقين بها في العام الدراسي 2018 - 2019 حوالي 209633 طالبًا، بالإضافة إلى ذلك تضم الإسكندرية عدة جامعات وأكاديميات أخرى مثل جامعة الإسكندرية الأهلية، الكلية البحرية وكلية الدفاع الجوي التابعتين للأكاديمية العسكرية المصرية، الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم والتكنولوجيا والنقل البحري، أكاديمية السادات للعلوم الإدارية، كلية الدراسات الإسلامية والعربية بنات التابعة لجامعة الأزهر، جامعة سنجور، جامعة فاروس بالإسكندرية، جامعة بيروت العربية، المعاهد العليا بكينج مريوط، معهد الإسكندرية العالي للهندسة والتكنولوجيا، المعهد

والصرف الصحي\nمياه الشرب\n\nمنذ نشأة الإسكندرية اعتمد سكانها على الحصول على مياه الشرب من خلال القنوات المتفرعة من الفرع الكانوبي لنهر النيل (فرع رشيد حاليًا)، ثم يتم تخزين هذه المياه في فترات الفيضان داخل صهاريج موزعة على عدة أماكن في المدينة لاستخدامها باقي العام، وخلال القرن 19 تم حصر عدد صهاريج المياه المستخدمة في الإسكندرية وبلغ عددها 119 صهريج، لم يتبقى منهم حاليًا سوى خمسة صهاريج هي صهريج ابن النبيه، ابن بطوطة، الباب الأخضر، دار إسماعيل، والمباهما، ولم تعرف المدينة نظام معالجة مياه الشرب وضخها بالأنابيب سوى سنة 1860 عندما تأسست شركتان للعمل في هذا المجال هما شركة ترشيح مياه الرمل وهي شركة متعددة الجنسيات، والشركة المدنية وهي شركة فرنسية تحولت فيما بعد إلى شركة إنجليزية ذات مسئولية محدودة تحت اسم \"شركة مياه الإسكندرية المحدودة\"، وحصلت على حق امتياز توصيل المياه بالأنابيب داخل

          "summary": "الإسْكَنْدَرِيَّة هي العاصمة الثانية لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمة محافظة الإسكندرية وأكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهة الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينة الإسكندرية الكثير من المعالم المميزة، إذ يوجد بها أكبر موانئ مصر البحرية وهو ميناء الإسكندرية الذي يمر به نحو 60% من إجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصرية، وتضم أيضًا مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة التي تحتوي على أكثر من ثمانية ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الإسكندرية القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الأثرية مثل قلعة قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمة، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الأنشطة الاقتصادية، وتنقسم الإسكندرية إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي: حي أول المنتزة، حي ثان المنتزة، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي أول العامرية، وحي ثان العامرية.\nبدأ العمل على إنشاء الإسكندرية على يد الإسكندر الأكبر سنة 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيرة ممتدة أمام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيرة أخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيرة مريوط، واتخذها الإسكندر الأكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمة لمصر لما يقرب من ألف سنة، حتى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنة 641 م، اشتهرت الإسكندرية عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية القديمة والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الإسكندرية والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل إلى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المنارة قائمة حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنة 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين أن اختيار الإسكندر الأكبر لمدينة الإسكندرية كي تكون عاصمة لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمة الأوديسة، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن أوديسيوس ملك إيثاكا، إلى مينلاوس ملك إسبرطة يسأله إن كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن أهوال الحرب وشجاعة ملك إيثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وأنه بعدما أضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيرة فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك إسبرطة: «كان في مقدورنا أن نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الأنهار».",

          "content": "## Overview\nAlexandria (pronounced al-ig-ZAN-dree-uh ; Arabic: الإسكندرية ‎/ اسكندرية al-Iskandariyya / Eskendereyya ) is Egypt's second largest city (5.2 million people in 2018), its largest seaport, and the country's window onto the Mediterranean Sea. The city is a faded shadow of its former glorious cosmopolitan self, but still worth a visit for its many cultural attractions and still-palpable glimpses of its past.\n\n## History\nFew cities of the world have a history as rich as that of Alexandria; few cities have witnessed so many historic events and legends. Founded by Alexander the Great (Iskander al-Akbar) in 331 BCE, Alexandria became the capital of Greco-Roman Egypt; its status as a beacon of culture is symbolized by Pharos, the legendary lighthouse.\nThere had long been a fishing village here, called Rhakotis, but Alexander had greater plans for it. Its strategic value was obvious: it had a great natural harbour, a backing lagoon to prevent land attack, a fertile hinterland, and potential control of trade routes up the Nile and overland to the Red Sea and Arabia. But the approach to the harbour was tricky: the coastline and off-shore islands were low and without landmarks, so sailors could easily take the wrong channel and get wrecked on the shoals. To guide them in, Alexander's successors Ptolemy I & II built a lighthouse on the nearby island of Pharos. It stood just over 100 m tall, so only the Great Pyramids were taller. A bronze mirror atop it reflected sunlight by day, and by night the flames of oil-soaked sheep fleeces. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the name of the island \"Pharos\" came to apply to all subsequent lighthouses, and spawned modern words such as \"phares\" in French.\nA jetty over 1 km long was built to connect Pharos to the mainland, dividing the bay into an eastern and western harbour. Silt and landfill built up along the jetty so it broadened into a peninsula, the present-day district of Anfushi. The lighthouse was badly damaged by earthquakes in 956, 1303 and 1323, then fell into disuse and disrepair. In 1480 Sultan Qaitbey used the ruined stone to build his fortress here. The rest of it was eaten by coastal erosion, and came to lie on the sea-bed. But a combination of ancient descriptions, modern marine archaeology and satellite imaging give us a detailed picture of it.\nAlexandria under Ptolemy I & II prospered not just through trading, but as a knowledge economy. They set out to acquire and understand every manuscript they could. Arriving ships were searched, and any manuscripts seized and copied onto papyrus. In the great Library of Alexandria texts were translated, catalogued and studied. Scholars, philosophers and scientists flocked to work on these texts, and to create new material. Just one example of their creative output was the Septuagint, the first Greek translation of Hebrew holy texts that became the Christian Bible Old Testament.\nTrade and knowledge made Alexandria cosmopolitan, with the largest Jewish populations and Hellenistic cultures anywhere. It retained its importance, and was capital of Egypt, while power was shifting elsewhere: the rise and decline of Rome, the rise of Byzantium, and growth of Persia. But the city suffered natural disasters (eg the tsunami of 365 CE) and a series of wars (particularly against Rome), and the library was destroyed. When the Arabs conquered Egypt in 641 CE they founded a new capital to the south in Fustat, now Cairo. Politically, economically and intellectually, Alexandria was no longer the place to be.\nAlexandria survived as a trading port; Marco Polo described it around 1300 as one of the world's two busiest ports, along with Quanzhou. However, its strategic location meant that every army on its way to Egypt passed through: Napoleon's troops stormed the city in 1798, but the British conquered it in the Siege of Alexandria in 1801. The Egyptians under Mohammed Ali took control of the city and rebuilt it, but the Orabi Rebellion in 1881 and massacres of Europeans in the city led the British to strike back and hammer the rebels with the three-day Bombardment of Alexandria, reducing much of the city center to rubble.\nOnce again, Alexandria rose from the ashes. Its cosmopolitan and decadent lifestyle before and during World War II gave birth to its greatest poet, Constantine P. Cavafy, and was chronicled in Laurence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet and a series of works by E.M. Forster including Alexandria: A History and Guide (1922), described by some as the best travel guide ever written.\nYet this world, too, took a shattering blow in the 1950s when Egypt's new fiercely nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized vast swathes of the economy and forbade foreigners from owning or running companies. This forced tens of thousands of foreigners out of the country, including virtually all of Alexandria's once 150,000-strong Greek community. Alexandria thus ceased to be a cosmopolitan city.\nToday's Alexandria is a dusty seaside Egyptian town with miles of tatty low-rise and 'burbs holding its population of 5 million, yet its status as Egypt's leading port keeps business humming, and tourists still flock to the beaches in the summertime. And while much of the city is badly in need of major repair, its history is still evident: the French-style parks and the occasional French street sign survive as a legacy of Napoleon, and the few remaining Greek restaurants and cafés still do a good trade.\n\n## Climate\nAlexandria has a hot desert climate (BWh), but highly influenced by sea breeze, with sunny hot humid summers and mild moderately wet winters. The daytime can be humid in summer, with summer temperatures averaging 31 °C (88 °F), but evenings are usually cooler and breezy, especially by the Corniche. Winters can get cold, with daytime highs down sometimes to 12 °C (53 °F), with occasional rain and sometimes hail. Humidity is high throughout the year. The best time to visit Alexandria is in spring (March–June) and autumn (September–November). It's at its busiest in summer, when Egyptians flock down to escape the searing heat of Cairo.\n\n## Orientation\nAlexandria is a long thin city, pinched between the swampy delta and the sea. Its east-west artery, the Corniche, rolls on for about 30 km. However the advantage to the visitor is that all transport is funnelled along this corridor, so you shouldn't wait more than a minute for a taxi, buses or microbus going your way. The tram line runs parallel a block or two further inland.\nAt the western tip lies the Citadel of Qaitbey, built near (and from) the ruined ancient lighthouse or Pharos. The Corniche then sweeps around the eastern harbour, with Anfushi the tongue of land behind it, to the central hotel area around Saad Zaghloul; then passes the east end of the harbour at the jetty opposite the new library. Almost all the sights, and the bulk of the accommodation and restaurants, are along this congested 5-6 km strip or nearby. But on and on eastwards rolls the Corniche through rundown beachfront districts of Rushdy, San Stefano and Mandarah. The blingy hotels of Montazah are a bright spot then the tat, burbs and ribbon-development resume, out to Aboukir.\n\n## Tourist offices\nEgyptian Tourist Authority. \n  Raml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556. \n  Nuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527. \n  Borg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119. \n  Marine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494. \n  Misr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985. \n  Sidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\nRaml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556.\nNuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527.\nBorg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119.\nMarine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494.\nMisr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985.\nSidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\nRaml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556.\nNuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527.\nBorg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119.\nMarine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494.\nMisr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985.\nSidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\n\n## By plane\nAlexandria has domestic flights daily from Cairo, Luxor, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh, with Egyptair the main operator. Saudia Airlines fly from Jeddah and the Gulf States, and Turkish Airlines fly from Istanbul. Flights from Italy by Wizz Air have ended as of June 2023. And all of airlines of the country including: Air Cairo Air Arabia Nile Air FlyEgypt and Petroleum air services (PAS).\n30.91777829.6963891 Borg el Arab Airport (HBE  IATA). All flights into Alexandria use this airport 45 km southwest of downtown. It's small but modern, ample for the low passenger numbers it now handles. Cafe and clean toilets and that's about all. There is no public transport - a taxi downtown will take 60-90 min, and reckon at least LE400 as they've no competition.      (updated Oct 2021)\nCairo (CAI IATA) is the main portal of entry into Egypt and you travel onwards overland. The Cairo-Alex flight only makes sense as a connection with another flight.\n\n## By train\nTrain is the easiest way to travel between central Cairo and Alexandria, with 30 services a day. Best of these are the \"Specials\", running non-stop and taking 2 hr 40 min; almost as good are the \"Express\" services taking around 3 hours (usually stopping only in Tanta on the way). These trains are clean and comfortable, air-conditioned, and with snacks available. For foreigners, one-way AC2 tickets cost 35USD and AC1 tickets cost 40USD (+ 1USD if you pay by credit card) (October 2025). The fast trains are sometimes also called Spanish, French or Turbo because of their rolling stock. See \"Egypt#get around by train\" for how to buy tickets.\nTrains from Cairo all depart from Ramses Station. In Alexandria they arrive downtown at 31.19333329.9063062 Misr station , where taxis and microbuses are waiting, or a 15-min stroll north along Nabi Daniel St brings you onto the Corniche. Nabi Daniel is a street market and closed to traffic, so taxis use the parallel Saad Zaghlool St.\nBut when your \"non-stop\" train arrives, and everyone piles out, ask around before following. You may have stopped 3 km east at 31.21937129.9427873 Sidi Gaber station  on Abu Qir St at the top of Mushir Ahmad Ismail St. Only get off here if you're heading for an eastern district such as San Stefano. Otherwise sit tight, and in a couple of minutes the train will rumble on and terminate at Misr Station.\nTrains to Alexandria also run from Marsa Matruh and the delta towns. These are slower \"ordinary\" trains and you buy your ticket at the station. Some trains run directly from Luxor via Cairo, but these too are slow \"ordinary\" trains, and you're better taking fast trains and changing in Cairo.\n\n## By bus\nThere are a variety of local bus services which have improved significantly in the past few years, but they are rather confusing for those who haven't lived in Alexandria for a while. Apart from city buses, you will also find \"mini-buses\", which work on hop-and-go basis. They are easily recognizable 14-person buses, which will stop when you wave and stop where you need to get off. The drivers rarely speak English, so make sure you know the Arabic name of your destination or that you already know where to stop. The routes are usually along the main streets, with drivers following well-known routes. The routes are written in Arabic on the sides of the vehicle, but even if you speak Arabic this may not be helpful; the drivers sometimes change routes without changing their signage. However, if you remain in Alexandria for some time you may learn the somewhat elaborate system of hand signals the locals have devised to indicate the desired destination.\n\n## By minibus\nYou can take a minibus from Cairo for about LE140 (October 2025). These wait just the the west of Ramsis Station in Cairo; look for the white vans and listen for shouts of “Alexandria!” to find the right vehicle. The minibuses will leave when full. While this is your cheapest option from most departure points, know that the minibuses can be hot and cramped, and your driver will likely drive like a mad person, so take them at your own risk.\n\n## By car\nThere are two roads between Cairo and Alexandria, both taking 3 hours. The usual cautions for driving in Egypt apply; see Egypt#By car.\nAgriculture Road has a speed limit of 90 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. This is the main road, so it can get a little crowded. It also gives access to Damnhour and Tanta.\nDesert Road has a speed limit of 100 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. True to the name, this crosses the desert and is less crowded and faster. There are cafes every few km.\n\n## By boat\nAlex remains a major sea port, but all international passenger services are axed because of this region's turmoil and loss of tourist traffic. It may still be possible to arrange freighter travel, but with so many migrants trying to reach Europe from the Middle East by sea in the 21st century, they will be very wary about taking you. So your best bet may be to call in a favour from a friend with a gin-palace private yacht.\nThe Med cruise liners seldom visit here nowadays. Nile cruises still call at Alexandria, Cairo and the ancient Egyptian sites up to Luxor and Aswan. But all of these are package tourist itineraries, and not available to book as point-to-point ferries.\n\n## Get around\nAlexandria is a long, long city but there's good transport along the Corniche. It also extends several km inland past the lagoons, but you've no reason to go that way.\n\n## By taxi\nAlexandria's yellow and black taxis are a good way to travel in the city, and a cheap one as well. Be careful though: taxis will uniformly refuse to use meters (the rates haven't been adjusted in years) and drivers love to take advantage of non-Alexandrians (both foreign and Egyptian), so it's best to agree on the fare before you get in. If you are on a day trip to Alexandria, hire a taxi outside the railway station for the day.\nTo get into a taxi, wave at the driver and yell the name of your destination. If the driver agrees they would park at the side of the road as soon as possible. Some taxis will stop to pick you up even if they already have a passenger, but such offers are best refused. Furthermore, always check back once you get out of the taxi, there is no number to call if you lose anything of value, and nearly no chances of having it returned.\nCareem and Uber operate in Alexandria. Careem requires an Egyptian phone number.\n\n## By tram\nAlexandria has a creaky, slow but very cheap tram system that dates back to 1860 and looks the part — it's the oldest one still running in Africa. The route map is remarkably confusing and changes on a regular basis, but one factor stays constant: the network is split into the interurban Ramleh Lines (Tram el-Raml), which use blue-and-cream trams and run across the city a few blocks back from the sea towards the eastern suburbs, and the City Lines (Tram el-Madina), which use bright yellow trams and run west and south of central Alex. The two meet at Raml Station (محطة الرمل Mahattat el-Raml), right at the heart of Alex. In general, the Ramleh Lines are relatively quick despite their age, as they have substantial stretches of dedicated and uninterrupted right-of-way; the City Lines, however, frequently get stuck in traffic.\nFor both lines, the flat fare is LE1, bought on board. Note that the first car (out of three) in the blue trams is reserved for women only. The lines run until 1AM, every 10-30 min or so.\nProbably the most useful service for tourists is yellow tram #25, which runs from Raml Station to Ras el-Tin and Fort Qait Bey. You can also hop on any blue tram west from Sidr Gabr bus/railway station to get to Raml, but not all eastbound trams stop there.\n\n## Historical monuments\n31.21329.88521 Citadel of Qaitbay, Ras el-Tin (yellow tram or microbus to Anfushi), ☏ +20 3-4809144. 9:00-20:00. Set on the tip of the Anfushi/Pharos promontory, looking back over the eastern harbour and downtown Corniche. It was built by Mameluke Sultan Abdul-Nasser Qa'it Bay in 1477 CE, by re-cycling the stone of the ruined lighthouse. It tried (with limited success) to defend the city against invaders, from crusaders to Napoleon, and was in military use as late as 1882, when the British bombarded it. There are two entrances and admissions. West, facing your approach along the Harbour mall, is the ground-floor Maritime Museum - this is of little interest. (Its collection continues in a building on the mall.) Come round to the south flank facing the Corniche for the main entrance into the Citadel. There's a fortified courtyard, then a 4-storey bastion. Citadel LE150 for foreigners and LE60 for Egyptians and Arabs.      (updated Oct 2024)\n31.2308729.94722 Mostafa Kamel Necropolis (Mustafa Kamel Cemetery/Tombs). The cemetery includes four tombs dating from the 2nd century BC, all of which are in excellent condition and beautifully decorated. The cemetery bears the name of Mostafa Kamel, one of 20th century Egyptian politics' greatest legends. It was he who pronounced the famous phrase: \"If I were not born an Egyptian, I would like to be an Egyptian.\" As of October 2025, the site is closed for renovations.     (updated Oct 2025)\n31.18694429.9047223 Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, Carmouz district, south of Anfushi. 9:00-16:00. These catacombs were probably carved out to be a single wealthy family's mausoleum, and later expanded to take other elite funerals, from the 2nd to 4th century CE. The name \"Kom el-Shoqafa\" means \"mound of shards\" as people brought offerings to the dead here in earthenware bowls, then smashed the empties before returning home. They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels (the lowest now flooded by groundwater) for the funeral rituals and entombment. The place was discovered in 1900 when the ground gave way under a donkey. Built as a separate (and older) catacomb, the Hall of Caracalla became linked when energetic tomb-robbers tunnelled through. It seems to have been a burial place for the Roman emperor's horses, as horse bones predominate. No, not the donkey's. The catacombs are interesting for their plan and for their decoration, as the last of the pharonic burials transitioned into Grecian and Roman styles. But if you've seen the richly decorated burial chambers around Luxor, this one will suffer by comparison. LE150 for foreigners and LE30 for Egyptians.      (updated Oct 2024)\n31.18249429.8964534 Pompey's Pillar, Karmouz. An ancient monument, this 25-meter-high granite column was constructed in honor of the Emperor Diocletian in AD 297. The confined area where the column stands also has other ruins and sculptures such as the Serapium oracle. Also beside this area is a very big shopping center for cloth and furniture called \"El-Saa3a,\" where you can find many types of cloth or clothes. LE150, students LE75.

Daily. \"Kom el-Dikka\" means \"pile of rubble\" - so much for the grandeur of the Roman Empire. In Ptolemaic times this area was the Park of Pan, a pleasure garden surrounded by villas and baths. Highlights built in the 2nd century CE are the Villa of the Birds, with fine mosaics, and Egypt's only Roman amphitheatre. This has 13 semicircular tiers made of white and grey marble, with seats for up to 800 spectators, galleries and sections of mosaic-flooring. Excavations continue, and in 2010 a Ptolemaic temple was unearthed. You can see the amphitheatre well enough just by peering through the railings, but you'll have to pay to get inside to see the mosaics and other small artefacts. LE150 for foreigners.

Montazah Royal Gardens are situated along the shore as well, which means access to the lovely beaches and warm Mediterranean Sea waters nearby.

Opened in 1902, this is one of Alexandria's two grand old hotels (the Cecil is the other). It has been partly renovated, keeping the turn-of-the-century style. It's on Alexandria's main street, handy for sightseeing but lower floor rooms (especially at the back) can be noisy. The food is nothing special but the views from the rooftop restaurant make it special. B&B double LE1500.

There is a good selection of hotels in all price ranges.\n\n## Apartments\nFor stays of a month or more, consider renting. Apartments are easy to come by, in a range of prices (LE180-1000 per week) and states of repair. Landlords/ladies tend to live in the same blocks and will be willing to haggle the rates. It's definitely worth visiting an apartment before placing any money down, preferably in late afternoon so you see how well the lighting works and the worst of any insect problems. (It's very unlikely to find any accommodation near the coast that's completely roach-free!)\n\n## Stay safe\nAlthough crime is rarely violent, beware of pickpockets and don't flash your valuables or wear a bum bag or fanny pack. Street kids, taxi drivers, and others may harass tourists. They will usually desist after a stern \"La!\" or two. Or you can say \"la shukran!\" (no thanks) or \"emshi\" (go!).\nAlexandria is a conservative city, so women should cover their shoulders, midriffs, cleavage and legs. Even still, women can expect to be heckled or harassed in the street, especially if walking alone. The best response is to ignore the offender and pretend you don't hear anything.

          "content": "Luxor is a city in Upper Egypt. Luxor had a population of 284,952 in 2023, with an area of 43.0 km2 (16.6 sq mi) and is the capital of the Luxor Governorate. Nicknamed the City of a Hundred Gates or the City of the Sun, formerly known as Thebes. It was one of the capitals of Ancient Egypt. The city is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. \nLuxor has frequently been characterized as the ''world's greatest open-air museum'', as the ruins of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples, and tombs of the West Bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. Luxor is a major destination for tourism, with its large hotels and resorts, known also for its famous hot air balloons. The city also contains diversified cultural heritage such as temples, churches, and mosques, co-existing side by side. Around 5 million tourists from around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor's attractions, making a significant contribution to the modern city's economy.\nThe city is located between latitudes 25-26 North and 32-33 East. It is about 670 km from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, about 220 km north of Aswan. Luxor covers an area of ​​approximately 416 km², with a populated area of ​​208 km², and its population is estimated at approximately 284,952 in 2023. The nearest seaport to the city is Safaga Port, and the nearest airport is the city's Luxor International Airport.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Luxor derives from the Arabic قصر qaṣr, meaning \"castle\" or \"palace\", in the plural form al-quṣūr (“the palaces\"). It may be equivalent to the Greek and Coptic toponym τὰ Τρία Κάστρα ta tria kastra and ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛ̀ⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ pshomt enkastron respectively, which both mean \"three castles\".\nThe Sahidic Coptic name Pape comes from Demotic Ỉp.t meaning 'the adyton,' which, in turn, is derived from the Egyptian. The Greek forms \"Ἀπις\" and \"Ὠφιεῖον\" originate from the same source. The Egyptian village of Aba al-Waqf shares the same etymology.\n\nThe Greek name is Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θῆβαι) or Diospolis. The Egyptian name of the city is Waset, also known as Nut (Coptic: ⲛⲏ), written as  and .\n\nHistory\nLuxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the ancient Egyptian texts as wAs.t (approximate pronunciation: \"Waset\"), which meant  \"city of the sceptre\", and later in Demotic Egyptian as ta jpt (conventionally pronounced as \"tA ipt\" and meaning \"the shrine/temple\", referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name Karnak, meaning \"fortified village\"), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them as Thebae. Thebes was also known as \"the city of the 100 gates\", sometimes being called \"southern Heliopolis\" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as niw.t, which simply means \"city\", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called niw.t rst, \"southern city\", as the southernmost of them.\nThe importance of Luxor started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the community grew into a thriving city. Montuhotep II, who united Egypt after the troubles of the First Intermediate Period, brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale. Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the Hyksos from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the 18th Dynasty to the 20th Dynasty, the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.\nThe city attracted peoples such as the Babylonians, the Mitanni, the Hittites of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Canaanites of Ugarit, the Phoenicians of Byblos and Tyre, and the Minoans from the island of Crete. A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun. The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally Alexandria.\nHowever, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period. The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amun-Ra. His great temple at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.\nLater, the city was attacked by Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal, who installed a new prince on the throne, Psamtik I. The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, Alexander the Great did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast. Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the Roman Empire who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of Hatshepsut, now called Deir el-Bahri (\"the northern monastery\").\nFollowing the Muslim conquest of Egypt, part of the Luxor Temple was converted from a church to a mosque. This mosque is currently known as the Abu Haggag Mosque today.\nThe 18th century saw an increase of Europeans visiting Luxor, with some publishing their travels and documenting its surroundings, such as Claude Sicard, Granger, Frederick Louis Norden, Richard Pococke, Vivant Denon and others. By the 20th century, Luxor had become a major tourist destination.\n\nArchaeology\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris: Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.\nOn the same day in November 2018, two different discoveries were announced. One was by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities that had found a 13th-century tomb on the West Bank belonging to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the overseer of the mummification shrine at the temple of Mut, and his wife. Five months of excavation work until this point had revealed colorful scenes of the family and 1,000 funerary statues or ushabti. The other discovery was of 1000 ushabti and two sarcophagi each containing a mummy in the TT33 complex by a joint team from the IFAO (French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, Cairo, Egypt) and the University of Strasbourg. One of the sarcophagi was opened in private by Egyptian antiquities officials, while the other, of a female 18th Dynasty woman named Thuya, was opened in front of international media.\nIn October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists, headed by Zahi Hawass, revealed an ancient \"industrial area\" used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture, and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts, and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings, and gold foil, were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity Horus.\nIn October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden coffins (3,000 years old) in front of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in El-Assasif Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females, and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs, and the Book of the Dead, a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the afterlife. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.\nOn 8 April 2021, Egyptian archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass found Aten, a 3,400-year-old \"lost golden city\" near Luxor. It is the largest known city from Ancient Egypt to be unearthed to date. The site was said by Betsy Bryan, professor of Egyptology at Johns Hopkins University to be \"the second most important archaeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun\". The site is celebrated by the unearthing crew for showing a glimpse into the ordinary lives of living ancient Egyptians whereas past archaeological discoveries were from tombs and other burial sites. Many artefacts are found alongside the buildings, such as pottery dated back to the reign of Amenhotep III, rings, and everyday working tools. The site is not completely unearthed as of the 10th of April 2021.\nIn February 2025, a joint Egyptian-British archaeological team announced the discovery of the tomb of Thutmose II near Luxor, marking the first identification of a pharaonic royal tomb in over a century since that of Tutankhamun in 1922. Located west of the Valley of the Kings in an area known as Wadi C, the tomb—designated Wadi C-4—was identified through inscriptions on alabaster vessels bearing the names of Thutmose II and his wife, Hatshepsut. The tomb's interior featured fragments of funerary furniture and decorative elements, including blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars and religious texts. However, the site had suffered damage due to ancient flooding, which led to the deterioration of many of its original contents.\nIn May 2025, Egyptian archaeologists uncovered three ancient New Kingdom tombs at the Dra Abu el-Naga necropolis in Luxor, dating back over 3,500 years; the tombs belonged to high-ranking officials identified through inscriptions as Amum-em-Ipet, Baki (a grain silo supervisor), and “S” (a Temple of Amun supervisor, scribe, and northern oasis mayor). Each tomb features typical New Kingdom architectural elements such as courtyards, halls, burial shafts, and wall depictions of banquet scenes and funerary processions, offering new insights into elite burial customs in non‑royal Theban cemeteries.\nIn May 2025, a joint Egyptian–Canadian archaeological mission identified the owner of Kampp 23, a rock-cut tomb located in the El-Asasif necropolis, as Amun Mes, a high-ranking official who served as the mayor of Thebes during the Ramesside period. The tomb featuring a T-shaped layout typical of the 19th–20th Dynasties was first discovered in the 1970s but remained unattributed until recent excavations revealed inscriptions confirming Amun Mes's identity and several of his titles, including tax collector, royal advisor, divine father of Amun, and overseer of quarry expeditions. The team also found evidence of later reuse, such as painted plaster over original reliefs and fragments of ushabti figures.\n\nLandmarks\nWest bank\nGeography\nApproximately 4,000 years ago, a significant alteration in the geography of the Nile River occurred, particularly in the region near modern-day Luxor. This transformation involved the expansion of the floodplain, which increased the availability of arable land. This geographic and environmental shift likely played a crucial role in supporting the agricultural productivity that underpinned the prosperity and stability of ancient Egyptian civilization during that period and over the years.\n\nClimate\nLuxor has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above 40 °C (104 °F) during summer (June, July, August). During the coolest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above 22 °C (71.6 °F) while average low temperatures remain above 5 °C (41 °F).\nThe climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the Sahara, with less than 1 mm (0.04 in) of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than in Aswan, but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.\nThe climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright, and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.\nIn addition, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Qena, and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost 16 °C (29 °F) difference.\nThe hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991, which was 50 °C (122 °F), and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989, which was −1 °C (30 °F).\n\nCoptic Catholic Eparchy\nThe Coptic Catholic (Alexandrian Rite) minority established on November 26, 1895, an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt. Its episcopal see is St. George cathedral in Luxor.\nIn turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947, to establish the Eparchy of Assiut and again on 14 September 1981 to establish Sohag.\n\nSuffragan Eparchs of Luxor\nIgnazio Gladès Berzi (March 6, 1896 – died January 29, 1925)\nMarc Khouzam (August 6, 1926 – August 10, 1947), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (December 30, 1927 – August 10, 1947); later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (10 August 10, 1947 – died February 2, 1958)\nIsaac Ghattas (June 21, 1949 – May 8, 1967), later Archbishop-Bishop of Minya of the Copts (Egypt) (May 8, 1967 – died June 8, 1977)\nAmba Andraos Ghattas, Lazarists (C.M.) (May 8, 1967 – June 9, 1986), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (February 24, 1984 – June 9, 1986), President of Synod of the Catholic Coptic Church (1985 – March 30, 2006), President of Assembly of the Catholic Hierarchy of Egypt (1985 – March 30, 2006), later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (June 23, 1986 – retired March 30, 2006), created Cardinal-Patriarch (February 21, 2001 – died January 20, 2009), also President of Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the East (2003–2006)\nAghnatios Elias Yaacoub, Jesuits (S.J.) (July 15, 1986 – died March 12, 1994), previously Coadjutor Eparch of Assiut of the Copts (Egypt) (May 19, 1983 – July 15, 1986)\nYouhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (June 24, 1994 – December 27, 2015), previously Eparch (Bishop) of Ismayliah of the Copts (Egypt) (November 23, 1992 – June 23, 1994)\nEmmanuel (Khaled Ayad) Bishay (April 16, 2016 -\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent on tourism. Since 1988, Luxor has been the only city that offers hot air balloon rides in Egypt, which is a common activity for tourists. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly sugarcane. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry, used in eating, and many other uses.\nThe local economy was hit by the Luxor massacre in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks). The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets. Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013, near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals, and nine tourists from Hong Kong.\nTo make up for shortfalls in income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread, and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.\n\nTourism development\nA controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest, vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the 2.7 kilometres (1.7 miles) long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh Amenhotep III and took its final form under Nectanebo I in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated, which was covered by silt, homes, mosques, and churches. Excavation started around 2004.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Egyptian Government announced the discovery of a previously unopened coffin in Luxor, dated back to 18th dynasty of Upper and Lower Egypt. According to the Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anani, it is the biggest rock-cut tomb to be unearthed in the ancient city of Thebes. It is one of the largest, well-preserved tombs ever found near the ancient city of Luxor. On 24 November 2018, this discovery was preceded by the finding of a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransport\nLuxor is served by Luxor International Airport.\nA bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally, river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor.\n\nTransport to sites on the west bank is serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers. There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E., although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day, providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.) crossing to the other side.\nThe city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called \"calèches\", for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.\nFor domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and a sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around 400 metres (440 yd) from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and Aswan to the south.\n\nLuxor University\nLuxor University, founded in 2019, is a non-profit governmental university that provides programs and courses for students.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nLuxor is twinned with:\n\nNotable People\nMeritaten, Egyptian Royal Wife, King's Daughter\nAhmose-Nefertari, Egyptian queen consort\nNeferhotep I, Egyptian pharaoh\nSobekhotep IV, Egyptian king\nAhmed el-Tayeb, Egyptian Islamic scholar\nBahaa Taher (1935–2022), Egyptian novelist\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag (1150–1245), Egyptian Scholar and Saint of Luxor\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of megalithic sites\nLuxor Las Vegas\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBell, Lanny. “Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal ka.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 44 (1985): 251–294.\nBongioanni, Alessandro.

          "summary": "Luxor is a city in Upper Egypt. Luxor had a population of 284,952 in 2023, with an area of 43.0 km2 (16.6 sq mi) and is the capital of the Luxor Governorate. Nicknamed the City of a Hundred Gates or the City of the Sun, formerly known as Thebes. It was one of the capitals of Ancient Egypt. The city is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. \nLuxor has frequently been characterized as the ''world's greatest open-air museum'', as the ruins of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples, and tombs of the West Bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. Luxor is a major destination for tourism, with its large hotels and resorts, known also for its famous hot air balloons. The city also contains diversified cultural heritage such as temples, churches, and mosques, co-existing side by side. Around 5 million tourists from around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor's attractions, making a significant contribution to the modern city's economy.\nThe city is located between latitudes 25-26 North and 32-33 East. It is about 670 km from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, about 220 km north of Aswan. Luxor covers an area of ​​approximately 416 km², with a populated area of ​​208 km², and its population is estimated at approximately 284,952 in 2023. The nearest seaport to the city is Safaga Port, and the nearest airport is the city's Luxor International Airport.",

          "content": "الأُقصُر تلقب بمدينة المائة باب أو مدينة الشمس، عُرفت سابقاً باسم طيبة، هي إحدى عواصم مصر في العصر الفرعوني، تقع على ضفاف نهر النيل الذي يقسمها إلى شطرين البر الشرقي والبر الغربي، وهي عاصمة محافظة الأقصر جنوب مصر، تقع بين خطي عرض 25-26 شمالاً، 32-33 شرقاً، وتبعد عن العاصمة المصرية القاهرة حوالي 670 كم، وعن شمال مدينة أسوان بحوالي 220 كم، وجنوب مدينة قنا حوالي 56 كم، وعن جنوب غرب مدينة الغردقة بحوالي 280 كم، يحدها من جهة الشمال مركز قوص ومحافظة قنا، ومن الجنوب مركز إدفو ومحافظة أسوان، ومن جهة الشرق محافظة البحر الأحمر، ومن الغرب مركز أرمنت ومحافظة الوادي الجديد، أقرب الموانئ البحرية للمدينة هو ميناء سفاجا، وأقرب المطارات إليها هو مطار الأقصر الدولي.\nتبلغ مساحة الأقصر حوالي 416 كم²، والمساحة المأهولة بالسكان هي 208 كم²، ويبلغ عدد سكانها ما يقارب 289,618 نسمة بحسب تقديرات عام 2024، تقسم مدينة الأقصر إدارياً إلى خمسة شياخات هي شرعية العوامية، الكرنك القديم، الكرنك الجديد، القرنة، منشأة العماري، وستة مدن وقرى تابعة لها هي: البياضية، العديسات بحري، العديسات قبلي، الطود، البغدادي، الحبيل.\n\nالمعالم والتأسيس\nتضم المدينة العديد من المعالم الأثرية الفرعونية القديمة مقسمة على البرّين الشرقي والغربي للمدينة، يضم البر الشرقي: معبد الأقصر، معبد الكرنك، وطريق الكباش الرابط بين المعبدين، ومتحف الأقصر، أما البر الغربي فيضم: وادي الملوك، معبد الدير البحري، وادي الملكات، دير المدينة، ومعبد الرامسيوم، وتمثالي ممنون.\nيرجع تأسيس مدينة طيبة إلى عصر الأسرة الرابعة حوالي عام 257 ق.م، وحتى عصر الدولة الوسطى لم تكن طيبة أكثر من مجرد مجموعة من الأكواخ البسيطة المتجاورة، ورغم ذلك كانت تستخدم كمقبرة لدفن الأموات، فقد كان يدفن فيها حكام الأقاليمِ منذ عصر الدولة القديمة وما بعدها، ثم أصبحت مدينة طيبة في وقت لاحق عاصمة لمصر في عصر الأسرة المصرية الحادية عشر على يد الفرعون منتوحتب الأول والذي نجح في توحيد البلاد مرة أخرى بعد حالة الفوضى التي احلت بمصر في عصر الاضمحلال الأول، وظلت مدينة طيبة عاصمة للدولة المصرية حتى سقوط حكم الفراعنة والأسرة الحادية والثلاثون على يد الفرس 332 ق.م.\n\nالتسمية\nعُرفت الأقصر عبر العصور المختلفة بالعديد من الأسماء، ففي بدايتها كانت تسمى مدينة «وايست»، ثم أطلق عليها الرومان بعد ذلك اسم «طيبة»، وأطلق عليها كذلك مدينة \"المائة باب\"، كما وصفها الشاعر الإغريقي هوميروس في الإلياذة، وسُميت كذلك باسم «مدينة الشمس»، «مدينة النور»، و«مدينة الصولجان»، وبعد الفتح الإسلامي لمصر، أطلق عليها العرب هذا اسم «الأقصر» وهو جمع الجمع لكلمة قصر حيث أن المدينة كانت تحتوي على الكثير من قصور الفراعنة. يرجع تأسيس مدينة طيبة إلى عصر الأسرة الرابعة حوالي عام 257 ق.م.\n\nالتاريخ\nطيبة هي مدينة متحفية فرعونية قديمة بمصر العليا، وإحدى عواصم مصر القديمة إبان المملكتين الوسطى والحديثة أيام قدماء المصريين.\nكانت طيبة (الأقصر اليوم) مركز عبادة رع واهتم أغلب فراعنة مصر وعلى الأخص خلال الدولة الحديثة ببناء المعابد فيها لمختلف آلهة قدماء المصريين وأهمها الإله أمون رع.\nتوجد طيبة على الضفة الشرقية من النيل وبنيت عليها العاصمة والمعابد وقصور الفراعنة وكان لها عمدة على مر العصور. كانت تعتبر المعابد خالدة لذلك فكانت تبنى من الأحجار الثقيلة، ومنها ما كان يسمى بيت المليون سنة وبنيت أيضا من الأحجار، أما قصور الفراعنة وبيوت السكان فكانت تبنى من الطوب اللبن، باعتبارها ليست للأبدية. لهذا لم يبقَ من قصور الفراعنة شيئا يذكر في حين بقيت المعابد.\nاعتبر المصريون القدماء طيبة والشاطئ الشرقي من النيل دار الحياة ففيها يسكنون ويعيشون ويذهبون للتعبد في المعابد المجاورة لهم. واعتبروا الغرب دار الممات فكانوا يبنون فيها قبورهم. لذلك نجد وادي الملوك في غرب طيبة، ومعه عدد قليل من المعابد. أما المعابد الكبيرة ومن ضمنها الكرنك فكانت في مدينة الأحياء على الضفة الشرقية للنيل.\nيوجد في العاصمة طيبة حوالي 14 من أهم المعابد المصرية ويطلق حاليا عليها الأقصر. ومن أشهر آثارها على الضفة الشرقية للنيل بهو الأعمدة بالكرنك الذي شهد تعديلات كثيرة عبر القرون قام بها فراعنة كثيرون مثل: حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثاني وغيرهم، كما يوجد بجواره معبد الأقصر الذي بناه رمسيس الثاني. تقع بوابة معبد الكرنك الرئيسية في نهاية شماله، وأمامها كانت توجد مسلتان أخذت إحداها لباريس بفرنسا عام 1836م، وهي تزين ميدان «كونكورد» فيها. وفي نهاية شمال المدينة تنتشر مجموعة معابد الكرنك وقد بنيت علي مدى 1500 سنة، لتصبح أكبر منشأة دينية في العالم. تشتهر ببهو الأعمدة الكبيرة التي يبلغ عددها 134 عمودا. وبها بحيرة اصطناعية من عهد الفراعنة.\nوبين معبدي الأقصر والكرنك يوجد طريق الكباش ومعابد أخرى. وعلى الضفة الغربية للنيل كانت أرض الأموات حيث توجد المعابد الجنائزية ومئات المقابر، ومن أكبر وأشهر هذه المعابد الجنائزية معبد الرامسيوم لرمسيس الثاني ويرجع تاريخه إلى الأسرة 19 وبأنقاضه يوجد تمثال ضخم. كما يوجد على الضفة الغربية وادي الملوك ووادي الملكات ودير المدينة وهي مدينة العمال الذين كانوا يقومون ببناء مقابر الفراعنة بالقرب منهم.\nويوجد المعبد الجنائزي للملكة حتشبسوت (معبد حتشبسوت) من الأسرة 18 في الدير البحري غرب النيل، وهو تحفة فنية معمارية. وقد شيد خلال أوائل القرن 15 ق.م في مكان متدرج فوق منحدر شاهق. وأشهر الآثار في الضفة الغربية وادي الملوك حيث عثر به على مقبرة الملك توت عنخ آمون، وبه مقابر تحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثالث والرابع والخامس وسيتي الأول، ومقبرة الملك حور أم حب وجدرانها مصورة بالنقش البارز.\n\nالمناخ\nيتميز مناخ الأقصر بمستويات هطول أمطار أقل من معظم الأماكن الأخرى في الصحراء الكبرى، حيث يقل متوسط هطول الأمطار السنوي عن 1 مم (0.04 بوصة). تعد المدينة الصحراوية واحدة من أكثر المدن جفافًا في العالم، ولا تهطل الأمطار كل عام. الهواء في الأقصر أكثر رطوبة من أسوان ولكنه لا يزال جافًا للغاية. يبلغ متوسط الرطوبة النسبية 39.9٪، مع متوسط أقصى يبلغ 57٪ خلال فصل الشتاء ومتوسط أدنى يبلغ 27٪ خلال فصل الصيف.\nمناخ الأقصر صافٍ للغاية ومشرق ومشمس على مدار العام، في جميع الفصول، مع تباين موسمي منخفض، مع حوالي 4000 ساعة من سطوع الشمس سنويًا، وهو قريب جدًا من الحد الأقصى النظري لمدة سطوع الشمس.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن الأقصر والمنيا وسوهاج وقنا وأسيوط لديها أكبر فرق في درجات الحرارة بين النهار والليل من أي مدينة في مصر، مع فارق يبلغ حوالي 16 درجة مئوية (29 درجة فهرنهايت).\nتم تسجيل أعلى درجة حرارة في 15 مايو 1991، حيث بلغت 50 درجة مئوية (122 درجة فهرنهايت)، وأبرد درجة حرارة في 6 فبراير 1989، حيث بلغت -1 درجة مئوية (30 درجة فهرنهايت).\n\nالمعالم الطبيعية

سكانها يعملون في الزراعة، خصوصاً في زراعة قصب السكر. كما توجد في المدينة العديد من مجالات الاستثمار الصناعي والحرفي، ومن أبرز الصناعات التي يتميز بها السكان الغزل، والخزف، والفخار، بالإضافة إلى الأثاث الخشبي والمعدني.\nتعرض الاقتصاد في الأقصر لانتكاسة كبيرة في عام 1997 بعد الهجوم الذي أسفر عن مقتل 64 شخصاً، منهم 59 سائحاً، مما أدى إلى انخفاض حاد في أعداد السياح الوافدين إليها على مدار سنوات. وبعد ثورة 25 يناير 2011، تراجعت أعداد السياح بشكل ملحوظ في جميع أنحاء مصر.\nيستقبل مطار الأقصر الدولي نحو مليون سائح سنوياً، كما توفر المدينة وسائل مواصلات متنوعة مثل سيارات الأجرة، القطارات، والنقل النهري عبر المراكب الكبيرة التي تنقل السكان والسياح بين ضفتي النيل. وبسبب قلة الموارد، يلجأ العديد من سكان الأقصر لزراعة الخضروات في منازلهم، كما يقومون بتربية الدواجن والطيور والماشية مثل الماعز.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالصحة\nيوجد مستشفى الأقصر الدولي ومستشفى الأقصر العام ومستشفى البياضية المركزي والقرنة المركزي وأرمنت المركزي والعديد من المستشفيات الخاصة.\n\nالحدائق\nالمدينة النوبية.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد

التجديف للرياضات المائية نادي المدينة الرياضي ونادي الأقصر الرياضي وبها العديد من الملاعب الرياضية ومراكز الشباب مثل: ملعب المدينة المنورة وملعب نادي الشعب ويمثل المحافظة نادي خاص بها ومستقل.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nالنقل الجوي\nيخدم مدينة الأقصر مطار الأقصر الدولي، يقع على بعد 6 كم شرق المدينة ويتسع لاستقبال السائحين من مختلف بقاع العالم بأعداد كبيرة (نحو مليون سائح سنويًا). يجري بالمطار عمليات تطوير مستمرة تتناسب مع موقعه الهام والمميز.\nبدأت أعمال تطوير مطار الأقصر القديم في عام 1984 وافتتحت في عام 2005 بتكلفة 450 مليون جنيه فارتفعت الطاقة الاستيعابية للمطار من 800 راكب في الساعة إلى 4000 راكب في الساعة بإجمالي 7.5 مليون راكب سنوياً، ومن 21 طائرة إلى 33 طائرة.\n\nالنقل النهري\nيعد قطاع النقل النهري أحد أهم عناصر منظومة النقل داخل الأقصر بجميع عناصرها سواء الخطوط الملاحية، المراسي النيلية، الأهوسه الملاحية، البنية التحتية للمجرى الملاحي، والتي تخدم العائمات السياحية العاملة بين الأقصر وأسوان وكذلك صنادل النقل والقوارب الشراعية والعبارات.\nيوجد أيضاً «المعديات النهرية» وهي مراكب كبيرة الحجم تنقل أهالي المحافظة والسياح من وإلى البرين الشرقي والغربي بأسعار رمزية، بالإضافة إلى المراكب الصغيرة الخاصة (التي يمتلكها أشخاص)وهي للتنقل والفسحة وسط نهر النيل.\nتمر السفن السياحية الكبيرة التي توفر الرحلات النيلية من القاهرة إلى أسوان على مراسي الأقصر النيلية ويستخدم هذا الخط أيضاً في نقل البضائع ويسمح بالمرور المزدوج للوحدات النهرية.\n\nالنقل البري\nيصل الأقصر بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر عدة محاور برية تبدأ المحاور الشمالية بالربط مع أقرب المحافظات إلى الأقصر وهي قنا، ومن قنا تتفرع المحاور فيمكن الربط شرقاً مع طريق قنا/سفاجا للوصول إلى البحر الأحمر، ومن سفاجا إلى الغردقة، أو شمالاً مع طريق قنا/سوهاج، ثم طريق سوهاج/أسيوط، فطريق أسيوط/القاهرة، وتمر المحاور الشمالية بنفس المحطات أو المدن على نطاقين صحراوي وزراعي موزعة شرقاً وغرباً، وتتمثل في طريق الصعيد الصحراوي الشرقي، طريق الصعيد الصحراوي الغربي، طريق الصعيد الزراعي، طريق الكريمات، وجنوباً تستخدم محاور الصعيد الشرقية والغربية للربط مع أسوان.\n\nاتفاقيات التوأمة\nكازنلاك، بلغاريا. في يوليو 2006.\n كاخيتي، جورجيا..\n يانغتشو،

الجديدة\nهي مدينة مصرية جديدة من مدن الجيل الثالث، تقع في محافظة الأقصر، وتتبع إدارياً لهيئة المجتمعات العمرانية الجديدة، أُعلن عن إنشائها بقرار رئيس جمهورية مصر العربية رقم 55 لسنة 2010، تقع المدينة جنوب شرق مدينة الأقصر، وتبعد عن مدينة طيبة الجديدة حوالي 14.8 كم. تبلغ مساحة المدينة 8976.75 فدان؛ أي 36.32 كم2. ومن المقرر أن تستوعب عند اكتمالها لـ200 ألف نسمة. حجم الاستثمارات في الأقصر الجديدة وصلت ل2.3 مليار جنيه، مقسمة قطاع الإسكان: 935 مليون جنيه، قطاع الخدمات: 320 مليون جنيه، قطاع الزراعة: 22 مليون جنيه، قطاع المرافق: 992 مليون جنيه.\nهدف إنشاء مدينة الأقصر الجديدة يتمثل في عدة جوانب هامة. أولاً، تهدف المدينة إلى المساهمة في حل مشاكل الإسكان في جميع أنحاء محافظة الأقصر، من خلال توفير وحدات سكنية مناسبة للمواطنين. كما تسعى المدينة إلى توفير فرص عمل لشباب المحافظة، مما يساهم في تحسين مستوى المعيشة وتقليل البطالة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تهدف المدينة إلى تعزيز الربط بين مركز ومدينة الأقصر وطيبة الجديدة، مما يجعلها قاعدة تجميع اقتصادية هامة تدعم التنمية في المنطقة. وأخيراً، يتم تجهيز المدينة لتكون أول مدينة جمهورية معدة خصيصاً لاستقبال السياح من ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة، مما يعكس اهتمامها بتوفير بيئة سياحية شاملة.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر أيضاً\nمصادر\nمراجع\nد / محمد عبد القادر محمد،

          "content": "## Overview\nLuxor (Arabic: الأقصر, pronounced in Egyptian Arabic: lo’Sor) is the premier travel destination in Upper (southern) Egypt and the Nile Valley.\n\n## Districts\nAlthough a relatively small city by Egyptian population standards, Luxor is quite extensive. It divides naturally into the areas on each side of the river Nile.\n\n## Understand\nThe dynastic and religious capital of Middle Kingdom (circa 2050-1710 BCE) and New Kingdom (circa 1550-1080 BCE) Egypt, Luxor has much to offer the visitor, from vast temples, to ancient royal tombs, via spectacular desert and river scenery and a bustling modern life.\nThebes, the world heritage listed old capital of Egypt, was on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor. Most of Luxor's ruins and tombs are there.\nThe modern city of Luxor is on the east bank. This area has the train and bus stations, most of the hotels and restaurants, some museums, tourist shops and so on. Most visitors (and almost all tour groups) stay on the east bank and travel across for the tourist sites.There are also some small hotels on the west bank, which has a more relaxed vibe, and many independent travellers stay there.\nHowever, Luxor is also known as the hassle capital of Egypt (and therefore a good candidate for the world). You should expect to be on the receiving end of behaviour that would be considered harassment in most countries, including being followed when you leave the hotel by men shouting at you. Instead, Aswan further south is quite the opposite and much more relaxed. It is a good alternative in case you want to skip the Luxor experience altogether but not miss the beauty of the Nile and the nearby attractive sights.\n\n## Climate\nThe weather is generally extremely hot in summer, while in winter it is generally warm, but may get cool at night. The climate is very dry with almost no rain at all and very few cloudy days. The best time to visit is in winter, from November to the beginning of March. The transition from winter to summer is abrupt, so there is no real spring or autumn. The prevailing wind is quite weak, but is persistently northerly. As a result the weather is predictable. By and large, there is little variation day to day. More basic accommodation often will not have reversible air conditioning, nor much insulation. As a result, accommodation can feel decidedly cold in winter, even though outdoors, the daytime temperature might be quite pleasant.\n\n## By plane\n25.67083332.7063891 Luxor International Airport (LXR  IATA) (6 km east of the city). Facilities for passengers include a post office, a bank, ATM, a Bureau de change, restaurants, cafeterias, a VIP Lounge, a duty-free shop, a newsagent/tobacconist, a chemist shop, a gift shop, a travel agency, a tourist help desk, car rental.      (updated Dec 2018)\nLuxor airport receives direct flights from several European cities, with most being inclusive package holidays, but they are often available to book flight only. There are also direct flights from the Gulf states. Egyptair and competitors fly frequently and direct from Cairo (1 hr), with day-trips feasible both ways, and good connections to Europe. Reaching Luxor from Alexandria or Sharm el-Sheik usually involves changing in Cairo, sometimes with lengthy stopovers. Most of the Airlines in Egypt including: Nile Air, ALMasria Universal Airlines, Air Arabia and Petroleum Air Services (PAS), which charter services flights to Cairo or Egyptian destinations, including Hurghada etc.\nThere are no public buses between the airport and the city centre. If you do not have a shuttle provided by your hotel, take a taxi, which should cost no more than LE60-80. Ignore the picket of taxi drivers and touts just outside the airport doors. Keep walking until you find a taxi driver in his car and then negotiate. Keep a firm grip on your luggage as people will helpfully wrench it from you, carry it most of 5 m to the taxi & bus stand, then demand a fee. \"Lah shukran, lah shukran...\": you will be saying that a lot in Luxor.\nIf coming in from another country, visas on arrival are available to many foreign nationals, just after you enter the terminal building leaving the plane. It is US$25 or equivalent, with most major foreign currencies accepted. Also, see Egypt#Get in.\n\n## By train\n25.6964532.644642 Luxor railway station (محطة الأقصر). Luxor is on the railway mainline that follows the Nile north to Cairo (10 hr) and south to Aswan (3-4 hr). The train is a pleasant way to travel between Aswan and Luxor; however, since 2022 prices were drastically increased for foreigners and you can expect to pay European prices for your ticket. For practical details see \"Egypt#Get around by train\".     (updated Apr 2021)\nDaytime expresses have 1st and 2nd class air-conditioned coaches called AC1 and AC2 with comfortable aircraft-style seats. They are a relaxing way to sit back and view the lush landscape of the Nile valley. Soft drinks and snacks are served, and there may be a dining car, but best buy food and drinks beforehand.\nOvernight expresses, departing 9PM to 11PM, are identical to the daytime trains and have the same fares; they are not sleepers.\nDeluxe sleepers are run by a private company, Watania. These have modern air-conditioned sleeping-cars, with a choice of 1- and 2-berth cabins and a club/lounge car. An evening meal and breakfast are included in the fare. One sleeper runs nightly year-round, southbound from Cairo Ramses around 8PM, and northbound from Luxor around 11PM. Extra sleepers run at busy times but note that these train may commence from Giza rather than from Cairo Ramses station.\nLocal trains - Non-a/c trains lumber between Cairo and Luxor, daytime and overnight, stopping at most stations - some commence in Alexandria. These are not much slower, but they are incredibly cheap.\nMost of these trains continue to Aswan (and since they have started from Cairo, are often late leaving Luxor). The expresses are run by Egyptian National Railways (ENR). ENR also runs the ordinary trains but these are not bookable and not shown on timetables, buy your ticket at the station. The deluxe sleepers should be booked online with Abela Trains.\n\n## By bus\n25.6977132.644983 Go Bus Stop stop (the Station is just north from the railway station main entrance in Luxor). To Hurghada at 8AM for LE230 and 2:30PM for LE320.    (updated Dec 2022)\n25.69605832.6443354 SuperJet stop. Rather simple intercity buses with A/C. Reliable service. To Hurghada at 8:30AM for LE125. It's non-stop with just a 15-min break on the way. To Cairo for LE230 with a stop in Qena and Giza.    (updated Dec 2022)\nBuses leave regularly from behind Luxor Temple, to most major cities. GoBus and SuperJet depart from somewhat different locations near the train station.\n\n## By boat\nAn essential way of getting between the East and West banks of Luxor is to use a boat. The blue local ferry is a very basic boat between East and West that costs LE20 for foreigners (as of October 2025). The downside is that the ferry only leaves when it is full, or when another ferry arrives, so taking the ferry is in general slower although you avoid the haggling. Nevertheless, during the day ferries departs often enough not to waste your time. Taxis are available at the ferry terminal on both sides, and the trip takes just a few minutes.\nOtherwise, motorboat launches (often called \"lunches\") will take you around, e.g. from the Winter Palace Hotel to the East Bank ferry dock—as of October 2025, LE80-100 for one or two people (you will likely be asked for more, so haggling is appropriate).\nAs you walk by the river, dozens of felucca owners will also offer you their services to haul you over the river, and normally a taxi driver will be on standby on the other side.\n\n## By e-hailing\nUber doesn't work in Luxor, but its sister app Careem does. It takes card payments, and saves you having to explain your destination or negotiate with the driver. InDrive also works in Luxor.\n\n## By bicycle\nLuxor is brimming with rental shops for bikes and a great many hotels also hire out bicycles. Rental rates are about maximum 5USD (June 2025), depending on your bargaining skills, the relative demand on bikes that day and the quality of the bike in question. Check the tires and be wary of last minute inflating as they may deflate just as fast. It is normal to be asked to leave behind your passport, drivers licence or student ID card as a deposit. Bikes can be rented on both the East and West Banks of Luxor (the latter near the local ferry landing), though prices can be a little over-inflated on the more isolated West. If you look for high quality bicycles, you can find Dutch bikes (gazelle/batavus) at the Dutch Rental Agency in Sheraton Street (East Bank) and, on the West Bank, at Mohammed Setohe bicycle (5 min walk from the ferry) which has quit good and almost brand new mountains bikes. Bikes can be taken on board the local ferry (be considerate though), so perhaps hire on the East, then transport your bike over yourself. Watch Egyptian traffic before deciding if you want to ride a bike through it.\nThe East Bank is the metropolitan side, so consider the traffic and crowds while deciding whether to bike on that side. The West bank in contrast is much more rural, and many tourists opt to bicycle among the fields here while getting themselves between the tourist sites.\nAt the sites, guards will try to convince you to avoid locking your bicycle as they will watch it. Which they will do very well, and then demand a tip for having done so. Lock your bike yourself to avoid this unnecessary expense.\n\n## By motorcycle\nFor the even more brave, Luxor is brimming with Chinese motorcycles around 150cc. With the right bargaining skills you can net one for LE50 per hour, or less for the day or evening. In the summer, the roads around the West Bank are relatively empty, and motorcycling around the ruins and mountains is easy and efficient. In a slow season, many are willing to rent you their own motorcycle for the right price. Ask for a helmet -- you won't get one otherwise.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis are plentiful in Luxor. They have no meters, but there are current rates that are accepted if you stay firm. Short trips within Luxor are between LE15 and LE25 (first offer from taxi driver will inevitably be LE50 or more). A round trip to the West Bank is about LE100.\nThe Sheraton Luxor Resort has a list of current (overpriced) taxi rates from their hotel to a number of destinations that can be used as a handy reference.\n\n## By minibus\nMinibuses are the transportation of the locals in Luxor, and the cheapest way to get around for the adventurous tourist. They all have the same shape so are easily recognized. They have fixed routes, with different routes marked by a different colour on the side of the minibus. However there are no maps of the routes, the locals know them by heart. Almost all bus routes converge at the railway station. Hail a bus by looking at it while it is approaching, and raise your arm. When the bus is full it will not stop (there are about 14 seats in a bus). Otherwise you can jump in, take an empty seat, and pass money to the driver, a flat LE 3.0 per person (as of Dec 2023) for a ride (no haggling required). When you do not pay while you sit down, they will assume you do not know the price and the driver will charge you LE 3.50 when you get off. Getting off is possible anytime, and is done by simply asking the driver to stop.\n\n## By calèche\nCalèches, or horse-drawn carriages, are common on the east bank and are a delightful way to see the city, especially at night-time. Prices vary according to bargaining skill, but LE20 per hour seems common.\nHowever, a number of animal rights groups have advised against calèches due to the poor treatment of the horses. It is not uncommon for drivers to beat their horses, and most Western tourists will notice many skinny and scarred animals. This does not mean that all drivers are to be avoided, some are reputable. Use common sense when choosing.\nBeware of using the same driver for several days in a row. At the end he may decide he has undercharged you in some way for previous trips and may ask for a lot more for things which weren't included, such as waiting around while you visited a temple, all the money paid before went to the boss and none to your driver, a tip for the horse, in the original price. It might be best to use a different driver each trip and not book a driver you've used before to avoid this possible scenario from happening even if he does seem more pleasant than most to start.\n\n## On foot\nIt is also possible to travel around the tourist district on foot during the cooler parts of the day, provided you have a good sense of direction. To avoid unwanted attention you will need to constantly repeat the words \"no hassle\", or \"laa, shukran\", which means \"no, thank you\" in Arabic. Also, be prepared to yell out for the Tourist Police if you have any concerns for your safety. There are usually always some policemen nearby since they may be also wearing civilian clothes.\nA good tactic for avoiding hassle is to buy an Egyptian paper each day (in Arabic) and carry this with you. Locals will assume that you know Arabic (and therefore their tricks) and leave you alone. Egyptian papers cost around LE1.\n\n## See\nThe Luxor district article pages contain detailed information and suggestions for things to see. Highlights include:\nThe temple complex of Luxor\nThe temple complex of Karnak\nLuxor and Mummification museums\nThe Valley of the Kings\nMedinet Habu\nThe Tombs of the Nobles\nThe Ramesseum Temple\nDeir el-Bahari of Queen Hatshepsut\nColossi of Memnon\nMalkata\nHot Air Balloon Rides\n\n## Do\nHire a bicycle and ride around Ancient Thebes, which takes less than 15 minutes.\nA local felucca ride just before sunset; shouldn't cost you more than about LE30 (for one person) per hour.\nTake a felucca cruise on the Nile for a 2-day trip to Aswan (the reverse trip is recommended, however, due to river currents).\nBook a cruise ship for 2-3 nights between Luxor and Aswan by tracking down one or several of them along the pier before noon. Most cruise ships have a reception at their entrance and you can just walk in. Do not mind the guards or barriers, they are just there for protection. According to some, prices can start at US$40 per night, and this will be cheaper than when going through an agent or booking online.\nHire a donkey, horse or camel to ride around Luxor's West Bank.\nPharaoh's Stables (just a short walk from the ferry terminal). +20 10 6324961. They will take you to places where the big coaches can't go. They have horses for beginners to experienced riders.

A tour in the morning for sunrise or evening for sunset. Also, be sure to know what is included and what not. Sunset tours do generally not include the sunset, supposedly depending on the wind, which is what they are used to say every day. It is still an impressive and inexpensive ride, even without sunrise. Each flight lasts at least 45 minutes, weather permitting.Nevertheless, pay attention to the safety record mentioned on Wikipedia, which is bad supposedly. This is not a romantic ride with only a few people: they often cramp 21 people into the basket. LE950-1,900, ask around (accommodation and travel offices) for the best deal.   (updated Nov 2019)\nIberotel: LE75\nSonesta: LE50\nLotus: LE50\nOne next to St Joseph Hotel on Khaled Ebn El-Waled Street: LE25\n\n## Buy\nThere are at least two different markets in Luxor. One is located in an air-conditioned hall, with shops located on either side of the hall. This market hall connects two major streets.\nThe older market takes up several streets near the Luxor temple. It is a joy to walk through, as it is mostly pedestrian and is a welcome respite from the horse and carriages on the main streets. This market really feels like an old souk and the visitor is taken back in time. It is covered with a wooden trellis, shading people from the sun. Many of the shops offer the same items, so the wise buyer shops around and looks for the best price. One can often bargain better after going to several stores.\nOnce you find a merchant you like, sit down, have some tea and begin the game of bargaining. It can feel like you are becoming a part of the family. Buying something as simple as a cotton galabeya can take hours, as you try on almost every single galabeya in the store, and then move on to items that they think you may want for the rest of your family.\nBuying anything may be very frustrating due to constant bargaining if you are not used to it. This trick has proven to work well: usually their first offer for the price can be ten or even a hundred times bigger than a reasonable price. First decide what you are actually willing to pay. Let us say that in this example it is LE20. If you ask for the price, you may get a reply \"LE120\". Now you offer LE22. You may then be offered something like LE110. Then instead of going up, you start going down with the price, your new offer will be only LE20 (your predefined price limit). If the bargaining continues you continue dropping your offer. Pretty soon he will understand where the bargaining is going and you get a comfortable price, or you get rid of the vendor.\nThe touting in the main Souq in Luxor is so bad that it is an absolute nightmare walking through it. Any desire you had to buy anything will quickly disappear as dozens of men try every possible catch they have on you. These include: \"You look lucky\", \"you look Egyptian\", \"come see my shop, no hassle,\" and guessing your nationality. But if you continue straight forward, you will come to the real Souq, where the locals go shopping, and the atmosphere changes completely.\n\n## Eat\nLuxor is a vegetarian's paradise with lots of fresh seasonal vegetables such as tomato and cucumber.\nA meal often begins with pita-bread and mezze such as baba ganoush or taboulé.\nYour main course may include meat or poultry, or regional dishes such as pigeon or rabbit. (To avoid an upset stomach, you may prefer to stick with the beef.) As with any heavily touristed area in Egypt, it is never hard to find reasonably well-executed Western food.\nDairy products, such as yoghurt or gibna bayda cheese (like feta but creamier), might accompany your main meal.\nFinally, many good vegetarian desserts are available, though some might seem overly sweet to western tastes. (If you can, specify low or medium sweetness.)\nWhile the evening meal is often filling, you may find this does not meet the energy requirements of a busy tourist. It is advisable to eat a hearty breakfast, drink lots of water and snack frequently during the day.\nLuxor, East Bank\nLuxor, West Bank\n\n## Drink\nThere is something of a social stigma attached to public drunkenness. Although Egyptians themselves sometimes choose to ignore this, for a foreigner to be drunk in public can give a bad impression. Most local pubs tend to be testosterone-filled hard-drinking dens where lone foreigners and especially lone women may feel uncomfortable.\nHowever, there are numerous places in Luxor to buy alcohol. Many restaurants, above the basic on the street places, sell lager and wine. They are generally made obvious by Stella signs outside or by having people drinking inside them.\nThere are two open-air restaurants opposite the temple about 200 m south of the main entrance which serve Stella lager for LE14 including tax (as of September 2011) and other local beer and wine for fairly reasonable prices. The huge Stella signs outside give them away. If you can not find somewhere convenient serving alcohol, it may be an idea to ask the staff in your hotel for directions. 'Cafeteria' can be the euphemistic name for a pub in Egypt, and pubs can be quite hard to find if you do not know exactly where to go.\nThere is a duty-free shop close to the north end of the Luxor Temple, slightly to the right across the busy junction. It has plastic see-through shutters at its windows and a guard outside. If you take your passport and go within two days of arriving in Egypt, up to three bottles of main-name spirits and beer, etc. at reduced prices, per person, can be bought. After the two days you can only buy the Egyptian equivalent. They also sell electrical products, and close at 10PM.\nDrinking in the street or in parks, although fairly widely done by locals, is not recommended for foreigners as it is illegal and alcohol is generally cheap enough in restaurants anyway.\n\n## Sleep\nLuxor has an extremely wide variety of accommodation options, from camping and hostels, right up to 5-star luxury hotels like the Old Winter Palace Hotel which is of extreme opulence and has played host to both movie stars and heads of state. Luxor probably has the greatest seasonal variation in hotel rates in Egypt, with some hotels being up to 50% cheaper (or more) in the low season (summer). Others do not change their prices.\nWhilst the vast majority of accommodation options are to be found on the East Bank, an increasing number are to be found (and are being developed), however, on the more laid-back and isolated West Bank, close to the tombs and the Valley of the Kings. A lengthy stay in the area might benefit from staying on both sides of the river for some time.\nIf you are arriving in Luxor by train or bus, beware the over-friendly and sometimes pushy hotel touts, especially at the station (these guys are a symptom of the sometimes fierce competition between rival hotels, especially at quiet times). Remember you do not owe them anything, but that they get 25-40% commission for convincing you to stay at their \"cousin's\" or \"brother's\" hotel, which is then added to your final bill. It is usually best to pre-book accommodation. Also, use a map or a taxi to find your hotel and discourage attempts to guide you to your hotel, as you may end up somewhere else altogether, in the expectation that you will give in and stay where your \"guide\" has led you after all.\nWomen travelling without company should exercise extreme caution whilst seeking budget accommodation in Luxor. Several reports have been made of sexual assault after women were given spiked drinks by hotel touts and staff.\nOn your first morning in Luxor, you may be woken at dawn by the adhan, or Muslim call to prayer. This normally lasts 5–10 minutes, and after a few days you will find yourself sleeping through it.\n\n## Connect\nSee the various Luxor district pages for details of telephone, internet and postal services - being a major tourist town, Luxor is extremely well-served with communication facilities.\nMost of the best outlets are to be found where the bulk of the local population lives, in the East Bank of Luxor.\nLuxor telephone number format is +20 95 2xxx xxx, while on the West Bank +20 95 2060xxx.\n\n## Visa extension\n25.68747232.631931 Luxor Passport Office (south of Luxor town centre, virtually opposite the Isis Hotel). Sa-Th 8AM-4PM. You must submit your passport, 2 pictures, copies of your passport (including entrance stamps), and LE1,100 fee before 11AM. Your passport will be returned at about 2PM the same day. Sometimes they might request additional documents like notarised rental contract and extend waiting time up to a month. At any rate, visa extensions are far easier to acquire at this office than in Cairo; acquiring it in Hurghada would be the easiest of all of them.    (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Stay safe\nStay alert – For those not on fully organised tours, touts can make sight seeing very frustrating. (Although they tend not to stray into the actual temples.) However within temples, one must contend with the government tour guides. The guides are legitimate government workers, but also extremely aggressive about \"guiding you\" and then demanding a tip. Rule of thumb: If anyone shows you anything, for any amount of time, they will want a tip. It may be worthwhile to give a small tip upfront while asking to \"self tour\".\nIt is wise to know which accommodation you are heading to and where, or just pre-book accommodation. Otherwise, you will have to deal with the touts at the station.\nAs tourism is the main source of income in Luxor, and has been for centuries, many people have made scamming into an art form. You should assume that any statement from someone who comes up to you out of nowhere is a lie. Some of the older tricks in the book:\nThe \"I need a letter translated\" opener, used to draw you into a shop\nThe \"I need a letter writing to my friend in your country\" opener (they show you an address that is in your country), again used to draw you into a shop\nThe alabaster factory. A large percentage of alabaster is imported, and is hardly made on site. The vast majority of other stones such as jade are imported from China and India.\n\"The temple is closed\"- Check opening times before you arrive. Find out on your own whether something is open or closed, whether you are walking the right way or not. Ask a local, not taxi or caleche driver. The main temples all maintain the same basic hours and rarely, if ever, have closures, as conservation/excavation work is almost always done while they are open, with just one area sealed off. The tombs in the Valley of the Kings are a different matter, but the main ticket office at the entrance has a sign showing which individual tombs are open and closed on any given day.\nPapyrus Museum - it is just a papyrus shop, some are good but some are cheap imitations.\nScarf seller - person selling usually just one scarf will attempt to use it to hide their hand movements while they pick pocket you.\nThe \"I know you from the cruise ship.\" opener.\nThe \"Excuse me, where are you from?\" opener.\nWomen travelling without company should exercise extreme caution whilst seeking budget accommodation. There have been several reports of sexual assault after women were given spiked drinks by hotel touts and staff. Always check your room to make sure the door has a secure lock that can't be opened from the outside, and check for spy holes (this is actually a thing in some places). Staff in some shops will also on occasion harass or grope women who aren't with a male travel companion. If you are travelling with a male travel companion, consider pretending to be husband and wife, even if you aren't. This will avoid some of these problems.\nMerchants in Luxor are notoriously aggressive and manipulative. If you do not want to be talked into buying anything, it is wise to completely ignore any attempt by a local to strike up conversation, no matter how benign it may seem. In shops and the market, the phrase \"No Hassle\" can often be used to avoid unwanted attention. If you would like to be polite, it is also appropriate to say \"Laa shukran\", meaning ‘no thanks’ in Arabic. Being polite will make your life easier, as people will remember you if you were rude and may hassle more later. If problems persist, threaten to call the tourist police with the phrase \"You're a hustler!\"\nOn the streets, you may find it easier to feign ignorance of English: \"Non Speakee Engleezee\" and/or \"Non Parlee Arabee\" seems to be the most reliable way to show you are not interested in their offers. This technique can however backfire quite spectacularly as most Egyptians speak several languages, so if pressed claim to speak something obscure like Azerbaijani or Ossetic. If you do speak an uncommon language such as Persian or Albanian or an Eastern European language, make sure you start talking to them in that language. If you do not, practice faking it and do so in their presence. This is the fastest and easiest way to get rid of the touts. Otherwise, just don't engage at all.\nDepending upon the perception your profile creates, you may be asked, sometimes within minutes of exiting your hotel, if you would like to purchase drugs or sex. Remember, prostitution and drug use are not taken lightly by government authorities. For gay visitors, extreme care should be taken when propositioned by a sex worker. Egypt has a well documented record of gay men being caught in entrapment schemes.\n\n## Go next\nDendera — Luxor is a good base to visit this site of a fantastically well-preserved Ptolemaic temple of Hathor. A number of hotels organise day-trips, and you don't need to be staying with them to use these services. However, it can also easily be reached by taxi or, even cheaper, by (local) train to Qena and local taxi from there.\nFor those with more time on their hands you can add a visit to the Temple of Seti I at Abydos, featuring some of the best relief work in Egypt. This is a lengthy road trip from Luxor, but can be combined with a day trip to Dendera.\nThe city is also a good staging post for onward travel through Upper Egypt and on to Aswan and Abu Simbel.",

          "content": "Aswan (, also US: ; Arabic: أسوان, romanized: ʾAswān [ʔɑsˈwɑːn]) is a city in Southern Egypt, and is the capital of the Aswan Governorate. The city is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities, with its recorded history spanning over 2,600 years.\nAswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the Aswan Dam on the east bank of the Nile at the first cataract. The city was the southern frontier of Ancient Egypt. Aswan's local quarries supplied granite to many ancient Egyptian monuments, and these quarries are still operating today. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of Elephantine. Aswan is considered a global tourist winter destination.\nAswan includes five monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae; these are the Old and Middle Kingdom tombs of Qubbet el-Hawa, the town of Elephantine, the stone quarries and Unfinished Obelisk, the Monastery of St. Simeon and the Fatimid Cemetery. The city's Nubian Museum is an important archaeological center, containing finds from the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia before the Aswan Dam flooded all of Lower Nubia.\nThe city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of craft and folk art. Aswan joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2017.\n\nOther spellings and variations\nAswan was formerly spelled Assuan or Assouan. Names in other languages include (Arabic: أسوان, romanized: ʾAswān; Ancient Egyptian: Swenett; Coptic: Ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ, romanized: Souan; Ancient Greek: Συήνη, romanized: Suēnē; proposed Biblical Hebrew: סְוֵנֵה Sǝwēnê). The Nubians also call the city Dib which means \"fortress, palace\" and is derived from the Old Nubian name ⲇⲡ̅ⲡⲓ.\n\nHistory\nAswan is the ancient city of Swenett, later known as Syene, which in antiquity was the frontier town of Ancient Egypt facing the south. Swenett is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian goddess with the same name. This goddess later was identified as Eileithyia by the Greeks and Lucina by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is \"the opener\". The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the Egyptian symbol for \"trade\", or \"market\".\nBecause the Ancient Egyptians oriented themselves toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, and as Swenett was the southernmost town in the country, Egypt always was conceived to \"open\" or begin at Swenett. The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the Nile, immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extended to it from Philae. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.\nThe stone quarries of ancient Egypt located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, obelisks, and monolithic shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the pyramids; and the traces of the quarrymen who worked (alongside domesticated draft animals) in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the Nile, and a road, 6.5 km (4.0 mi) in length, was cut beside them from Syene to Philae.\nSwenett was equally important as a military station and for its position on a trade route. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from Alexandria; this later became the Coptic Diocese of Syene. The city is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including Herodotus, Strabo, Stephanus of Byzantium, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder, Vitruvius, and it appears on the Antonine Itinerary. It may also be mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Isaiah.\n\nThe Nile is nearly 650 m (0.40 mi) wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than 1,200 km (750 mi) without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favorable weather.\n\nArchaeological findings\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the Temple of Kom Ombo during work to protect the site from groundwater.\nIn September 2018, the Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple of Kom Ombo. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in)) in height, probably dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\n\nArchaeologists discovered 35 mummified remains of Egyptians in a tomb in Aswan in 2019. Italian archaeologist Patrizia Piacentini and El-Enany both reported that the tomb, where the remains of ancient men, women and children were found, dates back to the Greco-Roman period between 332 BC and 395 AD. While the findings assumed belonging to a mother and a child were well preserved, others had suffered major destruction. Other than the mummies, artifacts including painted funerary masks, vases of bitumen used in mummification, pottery and wooden figurines were revealed. Thanks to the hieroglyphs on the tomb, it was detected that the tomb belongs to a tradesman named Tjit.\nPiacentini commented \"It's a very important discovery because we have added something to the history of Aswan that was missing. We knew about tombs and necropoli dating back to the second and third millennium, but we didn't know where the people who lived in the last part of the Pharaonic era were. Aswan, on the southern border of Egypt, was also a very important trading city\".\nStan Hendrick, John Coleman Darnell and Maria Gatto in 2012 excavated petroglyphic engravings from Nag el-Hamdulab in Aswan which featured representations of a boat procession, solar symbolism and the earliest depiction of the White Crown with an estimated dating range between 3200BC and 3100BC.\nIn February 2021, archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced significant discoveries at an archaeological site called Shiha Fort in Aswan, namely a Ptolemaic period temple, a Roman fort, an early Coptic church and an inscription in hieratic script. According to Mostafa Waziri, the crumbling temple was decorated with palm leaf carvings and an incomplete sandstone panel that described a Roman emperor. Researcher Abdel Badie states more generally that the church contained ovens used to bake pottery, four rooms, a long hall, stairs, and stone tiles.\nIn July 2024, a joint Egyptian–French archaeological expedition conducting an underwater photographic survey between the old Aswan Dam and the Aswan High Dam uncovered a trove of rock carvings, stelae, inscriptions, and miniature royal images submerged in the Nile near Aswan. The discoveries include representations of New Kingdom pharaohs Amenhotep III and Thutmose IV and Late Period rulers Psamtik II and Apries. Initial research suggests these finds, dating back to the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1295 BC) through the Late Period (c. 747–332 BC), may shed new light on shifting political and religious practices in southern Egypt. These artifacts were initially discovered during the Nubian Monuments Rescue Campaign in the 1960s.\nIn June 2025, archaeologists announced the discovery of three Old Kingdom tombs at the Qubbet el-Hawa necropolis. The tombs, dated to the late 6th Dynasty (circa 2300–2100 BCE), consist of vertical shafts, small courtyards, false doors, offering tables, and pottery vessels. Human remains were also recovered, with evidence suggesting that the tombs were later reused during the Middle Kingdom. Although some of the tombs lacked inscriptions, they still exhibited traditional burial architecture and customs, which, according to the archaeologists, may indicate that the individuals buried there had limited economic means.\n\nGeography\nNorthern Tropic boundary\nThe latitude of the city that would become Aswan – located at 24° 5′ 23″ – was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers and mathematicians. They believed that it was seated immediately under the tropic, and that on the day of the summer solstice, a vertically positioned staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a deep well (or pit) at noon. This statement is only approximately correct. At the summer solstice, the shadow was only 1⁄400 of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical. Around 240 BC, Greek polymath Eratosthenes used this information to calculate Earth's circumference.\n\nClimate\nAswan has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are consistently above 40 °C (104.0 °F) during summer (June, July, August and also September) while average low temperatures remain above 25 °C (77.0 °F). Average high temperatures remain above 23 °C (73.4 °F) during the coldest month of the year while average low temperatures remain above 8 °C (46.4 °F). Summers are very prolonged and extremely hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry. Winters are brief and pleasantly mild, though nights may be cool at times.\nThe climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than 1 mm (0.04 in) of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year; in early 2001, the last rain in Aswan had been seven years earlier. When heavy precipitation does occur, as in a November 2021 rain and hail storm, flash flooding can drive scorpions from their lairs to deadly effects. Aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet, with an average relative humidity of only 26%, with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer.\nThe weather of Aswan is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round in all seasons, with low seasonal variation and almost 4,000 hours of annual sunshine – very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Aswan is one of the sunniest places on Earth.\nThe highest record temperature was 51 °C (124 °F) on July 4, 1918, and the lowest record temperature was −2.4 °C (27.7 °F) on January 6, 1989.\n\nEducation\nIn 2012, the Aswan University was inaugurated, which is headquartered in the city. Aswan is also home to the Aswan Higher Institute of Social Work, which was established in 1975.\n\nTransport\nThe city is crossed by the Cape to Cairo Road, which connects it to Luxor and Cairo to the north, and Abu Simbel and Wadi Halfa to the south. Also important is the Aswan-Berenice highway, which connects with the ports of the Red Sea.\nAswan is linked to Cairo by the Cape to Cairo Railway, which also connects it with Wadi Halfa. The railway is incomplete towards the south.\nOther key transport infrastructures are the Port of Aswan, the largest river port in the region, and Aswan International Airport.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns/Sister cities\nAswan is twinned with:\n\nSonoma, California, United States\nChongqing, China\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

          "content": "Assouan ou Syène (en égyptien ancien : Sounou ou Souenet ; en grec ancien : Συήνη / Suḗnē ; en copte : ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ / Souan (ou Swan), en arabe : أسوان / aswān) est un port fluvial d'Égypte situé à environ 843 km au sud du Caire, sur la rive droite du Nil, près de la première cataracte.\nElle est actuellement le chef-lieu du gouvernorat d'Assouan et compte aujourd'hui près de 250 000 habitants.\n\nToponymie\nComme beaucoup de villes d'Égypte, plusieurs noms ont été donnés à cette ville selon les époques :\n\nson nom en égyptien ancien était Sounou, signifiant « Commerce » ou « Marché », ou Souenet, nom tiré d'une déesse. Cette déesse a plus tard été identifiée comme Ilithyie par les Grecs et Lucine par les Romains pendant leur occupation de l'Égypte ancienne en raison de l'association similaire de leurs déesses avec l'accouchement ;\nson nom en grec ancien était Συήνη, Suḗnē, francisé en Syène, mais on trouve également Zzuéné ou Zzeuene, commençant par deux Z : c’est le sujet du dernier article de l'Encyclopédie de Diderot et d'Alembert ;\nson nom en hébreu ancien était סְוֵנֵה (Souweneh) ;\nson nom en copte était Ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ (Souan), signifiant « négoce » ;\nson nom en arabe est أسوان (Aswān), francisé en Assouan.\n\nHistoire\nFaisant naguère partie de la Haute-Égypte, dans le premier nome, celui du « Pays de l'arc » (ou du « Pays de Nubie » - tȝ-stj), et dont elle fut la capitale à partir de la XXVe ou de la XXVIe dynastie après avoir supplanté Éléphantine, Sounou ou Souenet était, dans l'Antiquité, la ville frontière de l'Égypte ancienne, orientée vers le sud. Cette cité a donc longtemps été l'une des principales entrées et sorties de l'Afrique noire, donnant naissance à un commerce prospère sur la route des caravanes.\nParce que les anciens Égyptiens se sont orientés vers l'origine des eaux vitales du Nil dans le sud, et parce que Souenet était la ville la plus méridionale du pays, l'Égypte a toujours été perçue comme étant ouverte ou commencée à Souenet. La ville se trouvait sur une péninsule sur la rive droite (à l'est) du Nil, immédiatement en aval (au nord) de la première cataracte du fleuve, qui s'étend jusqu'à elle depuis Philæ. La navigation vers le delta était possible à partir de cet endroit sans rencontrer de barrière.\nLes carrières de pierres dans l'Égypte antique, situées à proximité, étaient célèbres pour leur pierre, et surtout pour la roche granitique appelée syénite. Elles ont fourni les statues colossales, les obélisques et les sanctuaires monolithiques que l'on trouve dans toute l'Égypte, y compris les pyramides ; et les traces des carriers qui ont travaillé dans ces carrières pendant toute l'histoire égyptienne sont encore visibles dans la roche native. Elles se trouvent sur les deux rives du Nil, et une route de 6,5 km de long a été tracée à côté d'elles, de Syène à Philae.\nSouenet était aussi importante qu'une station militaire en tant que lieu de circulation. Sous chaque dynastie, c'était une ville de garnison ; et, ici, des péages et des droits de douane étaient perçus sur tous les bateaux passant au sud et au nord. Vers 330, la légion stationnée ici a reçu un évêque d'Alexandrie ; celui-ci est devenu plus tard le diocèse copte de Syène. La ville est mentionnée par de nombreux écrivains anciens, dont Hérodote, Strabon, Étienne de Byzance, Ptolémée, Pline l'Ancien, Vitruve, et elle figure sur l'Itinéraire d'Antonin. Elle peut également être mentionnée dans le Livre d'Ézéchiel et le Livre d'Isaïe.\nÀ l'époque des Ptolémées, elle se divisait en quartiers très différenciés, Éléphantine bénéficiant d'un caractère résidentiel et la rive orientale constituant une agglomération d'ouvriers et artisans.\nLa latitude de la ville qui allait devenir Assouan — située à 24° 5′ 23″ — était un objet de grand intérêt pour les géographes de l'Antiquité. Ils croyaient qu'elle était située immédiatement sous le tropique du Cancer, et que le jour du solstice d'été, un bâton vertical ne projetait aucune ombre et le Soleil se reflétait dans un puits à midi. Cette affirmation n'est qu'approximativement correcte ; au solstice d'été, l'ombre n'était que 1⁄400 du bâton, et donc à peine discernable. Malgré tout, elle fut rendue célèbre par l'expérience d'Ératosthène visant à déterminer la circonférence de la Terre.\nLe Nil a une largeur de près de 650 m au-dessus d'Assouan. De cette ville frontalière à l'extrémité nord de l'Égypte, le fleuve coule sur plus de 1 200 km sans barrage ni cataracte. Le voyage d'Assouan à Alexandrie durait généralement de vingt-et-un à vingt-huit jours lorsque le temps était favorable.\nLe 24 pluviôse an VII (12 février 1799) se déroule le combat de Syène.\n\nFouilles archéologiques\nDe nombreuses fouilles ont mis au jour des fortifications du IVe millénaire av. J.-C., des habitations antiques et une enceinte de 10 m de haut construite au Ve siècle av. J.-C. pour protéger la ville des crues du Nil qui pouvaient inonder les maisons. Ces dernières étaient reconstruites après les inondations, ce qui témoigne de l'importance d'Assouan située à la frontière sud de l'Égypte. Ville commerciale et poste douanier aux portes de l'Afrique ouvrant sur la Nubie, elle se trouve au voisinage de la première cataracte du Nil dont les rapides imposaient de décharger les embarcations au niveau de cet important centre portuaire. La ville antique est cependant recouverte par l'agglomération moderne, d'où les difficultés de l'archéologie urbaine (en) qui empêchent de développer des fouilles de grande extension.\nLes archéologues ont découvert trente-cinq restes momifiés d'Égyptiens dans une tombe à Assouan en 2019. L'archéologue italienne Patrizia Piacentini, professeure d'égyptologie à l'université de Milan, et Khaled El-Enany, le ministre égyptien des antiquités, ont rapporté que la tombe, où les restes d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants ont été retrouvés, remonte à la période gréco-romaine entre 332 avant notre ère et 395 après. Si certaines découvertes supposées appartenir à une mère et à un enfant étaient bien préservées, d'autres avaient subi des destructions importantes. En plus des momies, des artefacts tels que des masques funéraires peints, des vases de bitume utilisés pour la momification, des poteries et des figurines en bois ont été révélés. Grâce aux hiéroglyphes sur la tombe, on a pu connaître le nom du propriétaire, un commerçant nommé Tjit. L'archéologue italienne Patrizia Piacentini a déclaré : « C'est une découverte très importante car nous avons ajouté à l'histoire d'Assouan quelque chose qui manquait. Nous connaissions des tombes et des nécropoles datant du deuxième et du troisième millénaire, mais nous ne savions pas où se trouvaient les gens qui vivaient dans la dernière partie de l'ère des pharaons ».\n\nClimat\nAssouan bénéficie d'un climat désertique chaud (Classification de Köppen BWh) nettement accentué avec des étés longs et extrêmement chauds et des hivers courts et modérément chauds. Le climat y est largement hyper-aride et extrêmement sec toute l'année puisque les précipitations moyennes annuelles sont environ de 0 mm. Assouan fait partie des villes et des endroits les plus secs et les plus arides au monde et il n'est pas rare qu'il ne pleuve pas du tout pendant plusieurs décennies de suite. En été, la chaleur est extrême et persistante puisque les températures moyennes maximales sont constamment supérieures à 40 °C entre début mai et début octobre, voire au-delà, mais tournent plutôt autour de 45°C pendant cette longue période. Des pics de chaleur extrêmes sont susceptibles de se produire, même aux intersaisons où il n'est pas rare que le mercure atteigne 48°C ou plus en avril ou en octobre par exemple. En hiver, la chaleur est très agréable en journée avec des températures moyennes maximales restant supérieures à 23°C avec des pointes possibles à 30°C. Le ciel est toujours dégagé et clair toute l'année et les journées couvertes restent très rares, si existantes. De ce fait, l'irradiation solaire figure parmi les plus élevées au monde et la durée d'ensoleillement annuelle y est estimée à plus 4 000 h, un maximum mondial atteint dans une grande partie du Sahara central et oriental. La température moyenne journalière annuelle est supérieure 26°C à Assouan. L'humidité relative y est exceptionnellement faible toute l'année avec une moyenne annuelle d'environ 26 %, et particulièrement en saison chaude où le degré hygrométrique de l'air descend souvent en dessous de 5 %. La région fait partie des plus sèches et des plus ensoleillées au monde : le beau temps est permanent en toute saison. La ville peut être visitée tout au long de l'année.\n\nÉconomie\nL’une des richesses d’Assouan venait du Nil qui fournissait, outre ses sédiments, son poisson, avant que le barrage d'Assouan ne perturbe l'écologie du fleuve.\nUne autre des richesses d’Assouan dès l’Antiquité est l’exploitation des carrières de granit, qui pouvait être transporté par le Nil. L'obélisque inachevé en est un vestige. Les murs de la salle de lecture de la nouvelle bibliothèque d’Alexandrie (Bibliotheca Alexandrina), sont réalisés en granit gris d'Assouan.\nAssouan possède un aéroport (code AITA : ASW).\n\nTourisme\nLa ville tire une bonne partie de son activité économique du tourisme, notamment des croisières sur le fleuve depuis Louxor ou sur le lac Nasser.\nC'était la ville préférée de François Mitterrand qui y passait Noël chaque année. C’est dans cette ville — dont il appréciait la « sérénité » — qu'il aurait pris la décision de se représenter à l'élection présidentielle de 1988. Le président français séjournait au Old Cataract, palais royal reconverti en hôtel de luxe, situé en face des ruines des temples de l'île Éléphantine et à proximité du musée de la Nubie. Il y passa son dernier réveillon du nouvel an, en 1995. Winston Churchill séjourna également dans ces murs. Ce même hôtel reçut la visite d'Agatha Christie, qui y écrivit une partie de son roman Mort sur le Nil, et dont l'adaptation cinématographique fut tournée sur les lieux. L'écrivain en donne la description suivante dans son roman :\n\n« Le fleuve offrait un aspect sauvage. Des deux côtés, des masses rocheuses, dénudées, descendaient jusqu'au bord de l'eau. Çà et là, quelques vestiges d'habitations abandonnées et minées par les inondations. Panorama mélancolique, presque sinistre. »\nL'écrivain Amelia Edwards, dans A Thousand Miles Up the Nile (1877), décrit les berges du fleuve où elle a vu « de grands paquets de peau de lion et de léopard, des balles de coton, des sacs de feuilles de henné et des défenses d'éléphants ». Gustave Flaubert et son ami Maxime Du Camp y commencent leur voyage en Égypte. L'écrivain et photographe Hervé Guibert a consacré à la ville une partie de son récit de voyage Lettres d’Égypte : du Caire à Assouan. Plus récemment, Denis Guedj a écrit un roman sur l'étonnant calcul de la circonférence effectué par Ératosthène, intitulé Les Cheveux de Bérénice.\n\nBarrages\nAssouan est également connue pour ses barrages, le premier construit par les Britanniques en 1908, et le haut barrage inauguré par le président Sadate en 1971 créant un vaste réservoir en amont de la ville, le lac Nasser. À l'époque de Nasser s'est accompli le vieux rêve des pharaons : maîtriser le flot du dieu du Nil.\nOn trouve au milieu du Nil l'île Éléphantine et l'île Kitchener.\nSur le bief entre les deux barrages, l'île de Philæ, sur laquelle se trouvait un temple d'Isis, fut submergée lors de la construction du haut barrage, entraînant la reconstruction du temple par l'Unesco sur l'île d'Aguilkia, 300 m plus au nord.\n\nTransports\nLa ville est notamment desservie par l'aéroport international d'Assouan.\n\nCulture\nPorte du royaume de Nubie, l'ancienne Syène renoue depuis quelques années avec cette culture. Le musée de la Nubie, inauguré en 1997, accueille les vestiges d'une civilisation dont les terres ont été englouties par le lac Nasser. Il s'attache à présenter ses aspects anthropologiques et sociaux, tout en exposant des statues et des objets pharaoniques sauvés des eaux.\nLa ville est le siège d'une métropole copte : la cathédrale copte orthodoxe Saint-Michel d'Assouan (Égypte).\n\nSport\nLa ville possède une équipe de football, l'Assouan Sporting Club.\n\nGalerie\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nGare d'Assouan\n\nLiens externes\nLes grandes cités d'Égypte, Assouan\n\nRessource relative à la géographie : Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire \n\n Portail de l’Égypte antique   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de l’Égypte",

          "content": "## Overview\nAswan (Arabic: أسوان‎ àswân) is the southernmost city of Egypt, some 870 km south of Cairo, just below the Aswan Dam and Lake Nasser, with a population of 275,000. Aswan is far more relaxed and smaller than Cairo and Luxor.\n\n## Understand\nIn the Neolithic era the tribes along the Nile began to combine, so that around 3500 BC there was a Kingdom of Upper Egypt from Aswan almost down to what is now Cairo, and a Kingdom of Lower Egypt which was the Delta. In 3100 BC King Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered the Delta and unified the kingdoms. Upstream of Aswan was inhabited but less important because the Nile was not navigable above the \"First Cataract,\" first of a series of six rapids and shallows across the Nubian Plateau.\nEgypt has always needed to harvest as much water as possible from the river, while controlling floods. A dam was therefore built across the First Cataract in 1902. In modern times still more water was needed, so the Aswan High Dam was built further upstream, completed in 1971 and penning Lake Nasser behind it, all the way into Sudan. Whole communities had to be moved, along with priceless antiquities, the most famous example being at Abu Simbel. Construction had political repercussions: the need to finance the dam caused Nasser to court the Soviet Union and China when western support wasn't forthcoming, and in 1956 he nationalised the Suez Canal and closed it (along with the Gulf of Aqaba) to Israeli shipping. This sparked the Suez conflict.\nAswan is today a well-developed tourist city, but hasn't grown to the extent of Luxor, so it feels more relaxed. The climate is hot desert: almost no rain falls here, and all the waters of the lake and Nile have come from over 1000 miles south. It's very hot in summer but pleasantly warm in winter.\n\n## By plane\n23.96416732.8197221 Aswan International Airport (ASW  IATA) (25 km SSW of the city, on the west bank and just south of the high dam). Public buses don't go to the airport and security on the approach road to the terminal is tight, so it's probably reasonable taking a taxi, for which you must agree a price in advance. The fare from the airport to the train station (stated inside the airport) is LE92 (Nov 2018). The following airlines operate services to Aswan International Airport: Astraeus (from London Gatwick), EgyptAir (from Abu Simbel, Cairo, Luxor),  LotusAir (from Cairo) and Petroleum Air Services (PAS) charter service (from Cairo).      (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## By train\nAswan is the southern terminus of the Egyptian railway network. The line follows the Nile north to Luxor (3-4 hr), Cairo (another 10 hr) and Alexandria (another 2 hr). The train is an excellent way to travel between Aswan and Luxor as it is too short to fly, and buses are bumpy and not altogether safe. The train ride from Cairo is obviously much slower than a flight, but comfortable and safe.\nFor practical details see Egypt#Get around by train. From Cairo there are four types of train:\nDaytime expresses have 1st and 2nd class air-conditioned coaches called AC1 and AC2 with comfortable aircraft-style seats. They're a relaxing way to sit back and view the lush landscape of the Nile valley. Fares vary with the train, with a single ticket Cairo-Aswan costing LE140 to LE250 in AC1 (Feb 2018), and about 30-40% less in AC2. Soft drinks and snacks are served, and there may be a dining car, but best buy food and drinks beforehand.\nOvernight expresses, departing 9PM to 11PM, are identical to the daytime trains and have the same fares; they're not sleepers.\nDeluxe sleepers are run by a private company, Watania. These have modern air-conditioned sleeping-cars, with a choice of 1- and 2-berth cabins and a club/lounge car. An evening meal and breakfast are included in the fare. Prices one way between Cairo and Aswan are US$110 for a single berth, or US$80 sharing a 2-berth cabin (Feb 2018). One sleeper runs nightly year-round, southbound from Cairo Ramses around 8PM, and northbound from Aswan around 7PM. Extra sleepers run at busy times but these trains may commence from Giza rather than from Cairo Ramses station.\nLocal trains - Non-a/c trains lumber between Cairo, Luxor and Aswan, daytime and overnight, stopping at most stations. These are not much slower, but they are incredibly cheap.\nThe expresses are run by Egyptian National Railways (ENR) - check timetables and prices, and make bookings, with them direct (but be sure to do so 24 hr in advance or the system might not accept!). ENR also runs the ordinary trains but these are not bookable and not shown on timetables, buy your ticket at the station. The deluxe sleepers should be booked online with Watania.\nExpress tickets can also be bought at the station but in 2017/18, Cairo Ramses station has often refused to sell daytime tickets to tourists, claiming they're only allowed on the overnight train. This is bunkum and there are no similar problems buying such tickets at Giza, or northbound Aswan to Cairo - or even in simply boarding the daytime train without a ticket.\n24.099832.90232 Aswan railway station (محطة أسوان) (North end of the city centre, a few hundred metres inland from the river). Leave plenty of time if you need to buy tickets, as the service at the counters is slow. It also has a tourist information inside. Microbuses depart from outside the station (turn right as you exit the terminal), and there are a number of cafés and basic hotels on the blocks between the station and the river.     (updated Aug 2024)\n23.973432.89723 High Dam railway station (محطة قطار السد العالي). Southern terminus station of the Egyptian railway network, mostly local trains call here. Useful for connecting to the ferry to Sudan, but not much else.    (updated Aug 2024)\n\n## By bus\nFrom Hurghada buses cost LE100-150 for 8-12 hr ride (513 km), buses leave Aswan at 3:30PM and 5:30PM, route operated by Upper Egypt Bus Co. Tickets are sold on the bus, but be sure to ask the price at the ticket office, because the ticket seller on the bus will often raise the price LE5 or so and pocket the excess if you are a foreigner.\n\n## By boat\nCruise ships ply between Aswan and Luxor most days. These are luxury cruise tours taking 5 or more days for a splurgy price, they're not ferries. Various operators, shop around online for dates and prices.\nA passenger ferry operated by Nile River Valley Transport Corporation sails across Lake Nasser to Wadi Halfa in Sudan once a week. Southbound it leaves Aswan noon on Sundays to arrive midday Monday; northbound it leaves Wadi Halfa 5PM Mondays to reach Aswan midday Tuesday. First class tickets, which get you a berth in a shared cabin, cost from LE385; 2nd class gets you a seat on the deck for LE230. You'll need to have your Sudan visa sorted in advance. From Wadi Halfa, buses and a very occasional train run south to Khartoum.\n\n## Get around\nAswan is compact enough to negotiate primarily on foot.\nFor the sights on the river islands or on the West Bank, you must cross the river by motor boat or felluca. Be sure to pay attention to the price as operators try to overcharge tourists. The public ferry to Elephantine Island is LE5 for foreigners (LE1 for Egyptians, Nov 2018). The ferry to the West Bank is also LE5 for foreigners and LE1 for locals. Felluca trips will cost LE50-80 depending on your haggling (Nov 2018).\nFor Philae, the High Dam, and the unfinished obelisks, you can take a taxi, tuk-tuk or a horse-drawn carriage. It is also possible to get close to the Philae docks with a public pick-up truck, going in the direction of the university. From the terminus it is only 1.2 km by foot, but there are also tuk-tuks willing to bring you further. You might need some knowledge of Arabic to figure this all out.\n\n## Aswan Town and the East Bank\n24.07959232.8889961 Nubian Museum (opposite Basma Hotel and south of Old Cataract Hotel, at the southern edge of Aswan town on Sharia Abtal al-Tahrir, approximately half-hour walk from the city centre). Daily 9AM-9PM. Spacious museum opened in 1997 as a joint project of the Egyptian government and UNESCO, it traces the history of the Nubian region from pre-historic time up to the construction of the Aswan Dam in the 1960s and the consequent flooding of Nubia. Adults LE140, students LE70, photo permit LE50.      (updated Jan 2019)\n24.0768932.895442 Unfinished Obelisk (South of Aswan). The largest known ancient obelisk, carved directly out of bedrock. If finished it would have measured around 42 m (120 feet) and would have weighed nearly 1,200 tons. There is also a short video about obelisks shown by a man who demands tips. This site would be of interest to the most dedicated Egyptophiles, but maybe not to others. LE80, students LE40.      (updated Jan 2019)\n24.0829132.890593 Archangel Michael’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (At the south end of the Corniche, just north of the Nubian museum.). Modern Coptic cathedral dominating the skyline of southern Aswan.    (updated Feb 2019)\n24.08053932.8919724 Fatimid Cemetery (Southern end of Aswan). The faded former glory of the Fatimid empire can be seen on the crumbling graveyard.     (updated Feb 2019)\n24.0835432.889045 Ferial Gardens (Southern end of Corniche). 10AM–6:55PM. When you're in Aswan you'll have to walk along the Kornish Al Nile (Corniche) at least once. It is a pleasant stroll, made even more pleasant by the fact that you can walk right into the Ferial Gardens at its southern end. They are a park that is as relaxing as it is beautiful. LE10.    (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## The river and islands\n24.09132.896 Elephantine Island: Nubian Villages & Aswan Museum. Nubian villages of Siou and Koti occupy this island. Also home to the famous Nilometers and the Temples of Sati, Khnum (ancient rams-head god) and Pepinakht-Heqaib. Movenpick resort is on the island. The Aswan Museum (adult: LE100, student LE50, March 2022) at the southern end of the island houses items found during excavations on Elephantine Island, and includes access to the neighbouring archaeological site. Also, be careful of unsolicited tours from locals, which will result in a request for baksheesh. There is regular boat taxi to Elephantine Island run by the locals for LE5 for one return crossing for tourists (you usually pay LE5 to go and don't pay to come back). LE100.      (updated Feb 2019)\n24.09361132.8869447 Aswan Botanical Gardens (El Nabatat Island) (on the entirety of Kitchener's Island to the west of Elephantine Island). Ticket office closes at 6PM during summer and 5PM during winter times.. Lord Kitchener, who owned the 6.8-hectare island in the 1890s converted it to a botanical garden. Filled with birds and hundreds of plant species and palm trees. Accessible by motor boat (LE200 for two people, which can be haggled down to LE100), via a felucca tour, or via a rowboat from Elephantine island (ask a local near where boats are lying on the western shore). LE20.      (updated Nov 2018)\n24.0632.8711118 Seheyl Island (just north of the old Aswan Dam). 7AM to 4PM. Friendly Nubian villages. Well known for its excellent beaded jewelry. Also the location of the Famine Stela. Cliff with more than 200 inscriptions from the 18th dynasty. LE40, students LE20.      (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## West Bank\nTombs of the Nobles. 8AM-5PM. The northern hills of the west bank are filled with the rock-hewn tombs of princes from the Old Kingdom to the Roman period. The 6th Dynasty tombs, some of which form linked family complexes, contain important biographical texts. Inside, the tombs are decorated with vivid wall paintings showing scenes of everyday life, hieroglyphic biographies and inscriptions telling of the noblemen's journeys into Africa. The ticket gives you access to the Tombs of Mekhu & Sabni and the Tomb of Sarenput II on the left side coming up the hill, as well as the Tomb of Sarenput I on the right side, for all of which you will need the key holder waiting for you when you come up. Generally, you should get into the tombs without problem, but when buying the ticket ask for it to get confidence and refer to this knowledge when you get hassled by the key holder. Try to go with several other people, so you can take some pictures when the key holder is busy, especially in the Tomb of Sarenput II. Otherwise, you will probably have to pay him a fee for taking pictures. On the right side there is also a tomb (no. 35 l) with a spectacular bat colony at the far end, if you bring a torch (or you mobile's camera). LE60.\nTombs of Mekhu & Sabni – Reliefs show invasion of Nubia\nTomb of Sarenput II – One of the most beautiful and preserved tombs\nTomb of Sarenput I (No. 36) – Six pillars decorated with reliefs\nTomb of Harkhuf – Hieroglyphics\nTomb of Hekaib – Reliefs show fighting and hunting scenes\n24.102532.8888899 Kubbet el-Hawa (on top of the hill above the Tombs of the Nobles). Small shrine/tomb of a local sheikh and holy man. The climb is rewarded with amazing views of Aswan, the Nile river and the surrounding landscape, richly evoked in the translation from the Arabic of the place name, \"the dome of the wind'. LE60, students LE30.      (updated Jan 2019)\n24.08833332.87888910 Mausoleum of Mohammed Shah Aga Khan (High up in the west bank). Tomb of the 48th iman of the Islami sect and his wife. Visible from the outside, although closed to the public.\n24.09472232.87577811 Monastery of St Simeon (There are camel holders waiting at the bottom and top of the Tombs of the Nobles. They can also be used for a ride to the Monastery of St. Simeon, which is 3 km away). October-May 8AM-4PM; June-September 7AM-5PM. The history of the monastery of St. Simeon dates back to the 7th century, and survived long as a Christian stronghold of southern Egypt until destroyed by Saladin in 1173. While still in use it housed 300 monks, and could in addition receive up to 100 pilgrims at a time. The monastery was surrounded by a 10 metre high wall, and doubled as a fortress. Apparently, the monastery did not return to its original use after Saladin's destruction. To get here, ride a camel or walk from the Tombs of the Nobles. LE40, students LE20.     (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## The dams and lakes\n24.033932.865812 The Low Dam. This was built 1899-1902 across the First Cataract, upriver from town. It was a wonder in its time, the largest masonry dam in the world, but its water capacity soon became insufficient and led to the construction of the High Dam 6 km upstream. The Nile forms a lake behind the Low Dam with small islands; the main sight is the Philae Temple. This was initially left in place, but flooding became more common as the Low Dam was progressively raised; the site was seldom accessible and the flooding damaged the temple decorations. It was relocated to Agilkia Island in the 1960s. The nearby Bigeh island also had shrines. Lake Nasser itself is behind the High Dam.      (updated Apr 2020)\n24.0255732.8840613 Philae Temple, Agilkia Island. Built to honour Isis, this was the last ancient temple built in the classical Egyptian architectural style. Construction began in approx 690 BC. It was moved from Philae Island, to its new location on Agilkia Island, after the flooding of Lake Nasser. A multinational UNESCO team relocated Philae, and other temples that now dot the shores of Lake Nasser. You can see the submerged island a short distance away, punctuated by the steel columns used in the moving process. Don't miss the Sound and Light show at night, see picture to the right, the least cheesy of the Sound and Light \"extravaganzas\". Note also the re-use of the temple as a Christian church, with crosses carved into the older hieroglyph reliefs, and images of the Egyptian gods carefully defaced. There are graffiti dating from the 1800s. At the ticket office there is a sign stating that a daytime motorboat to the site costs LE150 roundtrip for 1-8 people including a one-hour wait, which is generally enough time (Nov 2018). Take a picture of this sign to use when haggling with the boatmen who will demand LE150 each way, although don't be surprised if you are still pressed for an additional baksheesh. LE140, students LE70.      (updated Jan 2019)\n24.025132.884614 Trajan's Kiosk. A hypaethral temple on Agilkia Island in Old Aswan dam reservoir. One of the largest Ancient Egyptian monuments standing today, it is conventionally attributed to the Roman emperor Trajan, who gave it its current decorations, though some experts think the structure may be older, possibly dating to the time of Augustus.   (updated Dec 2018)\nAswan International Sculpture Park. Sculptors from around the world exhibit their pieces here every spring for the International Sculpture Symposium. The works are all created in Aswan (on the terrace of the Basma Hotel) and when finished brought to this site and exhibited next to each other within view of the ancient quarry.\n23.97143132.88019215 The High Dam. Despite being a very important piece of infrastructure, the Aswan High Dam is (to put it delicately) a bit of a letdown even for dam lovers. LE20.\n23.970732.86716 The symbol of Egyptian-Soviet friendship (West side of High Dam). Massive monument commemorating the assistance of Soviet Union in building the dam.  (updated Aug 2024)\n\n## New Kalabsha\nNew Kalabsha is a promontory housing several important temples, structures, and other remains that have been relocated there from the site of Old Kalabsha and other sites in Lower Nubia, to avoid the rising waters of Lake Nasser caused by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.\n23.960932.8673417 Kalabsha Temple. Like Philae, this temple and its surrounding ruins were moved by UNESCO to save them from the floodwaters of Lake Nasser. The main temple was built to the Nubian fertility and sun god Marul during the rule of Emperor Augustus. LE60, students LE30.      (updated Jan 2019)\n23.9603232.8670118 Gerf Hussein (originally known as Per Ptah, the \"House of Ptah\"). The temple of Gerf Hussein is dedicated to Ramesses II and was built by the Viceroy of Nubia Setau. Originally, it was partially free-standing and partially rock-cut. During the flooding of Lake Nasser, the free-standing section was dismantled and then rebuilt at New Kalabsha. Most of 23.28333332.919 the original rock-cut Gerf Hussein temple  was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters.      (updated Dec 2018)\n23.96194432.86638920 Beit el-Wali. The rock-cut temple of Beit el-Wali was moved from its original location by a Polish archaeological team. It is dedicated to Ramesses II, and the gods of Amun and Anukis (among others). It was originally decorated in bright colors, but these were mostly removed by a \"squeeze\" taken in the 19th century (the results of this squeeze are now on display in the British Museum).   (updated Dec 2018)\n23.96013932.86761121 Kiosk of Qertassi. A tiny Roman kiosk with four slender papyrus columns inside and two Hathor columns at the entrance. It is a small but elegant structure that \"is unfinished and not inscribed with the name of the architect, but is probably contemporary with Trajan's Kiosk at Philae.\"   (updated Dec 2018)\nDedwen. It was built within the outer wall of the temple of Kalabsha, and is dedicated to the Nubian serpent goddess, Dedwen. It was moved along with the Kalabsha temple to New Kalabsha. (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Do\nRent a bike. Bikes available at many hotels. Cross the modern bridge to the east bank and bring back your bicycle afterwards by ferry boat.\nCamel rides. Grab a felucca captain and they will shuttle you across to the camel marshalling area. Ride the camel to the Monastery of St Simeon.\nTea with the local shopkeepers. You will get a fascinating insight into their daily lives, and they love to practise their English on you. Nevertheless, they will certainly try to sell you something in exchange for the free tea.\nBook a cruise ship for 2-3 nights between Luxor and Aswan by tracking down one or several of them along the pier before noon. Most cruise ships have a reception at their entrance and you can just walk in. Do not mind the guards or barriers, they are just there for protection. According to some travellers, prices can start at US$40 per night. Either way, it will be cheaper than when going through an agent or booking online.\n\n## Buy\nThe souqs (markets) in Aswan are refreshingly exotic without the same level of high-pressure selling found in some tourist towns like Luxor. You will generally find that Nubian handicrafts are of higher quality and better value in Aswan. All other goods will be more expensive than in Cairo due to shipping costs to Aswan and the lower tourist demand.\nSharia as-Souq (it starts right from railway station going south). The most charming souq in Egypt, spreading through almost half of the city. There is far less pressure to buy than in other cities, and it is more beautiful and exciting as well. Buy Nubian talisman, baskets, Sudanese swords, African masks, live produce, food, fruit, vegetables, henna powder, t-shirts, perfume, spices, robes, statues.\n\n## Budget\n24.1047332.903371 Tiba Hotel (Teba Hotel), ☏ +20 1066682531.

Live it up like the aristocrats of old! Part of the Sofitel Legend chain of hotels, the Old Cataract Hotel overlooks the Nile River opposite the island of Elephantine.      (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Drink\nAswan is much less strict on drinking alcohol than Cairo or Luxor, and many of the restaurants sell Stella (Egyptian brand not the Belgian brand) and Saqqara, both of which are lagers and comparable to European beers.\n\n## Stay safe\nAswan is generally a very safe city. However, do watch out for quite blatant attempts at pickpocketing in the souq. These thieves will approach you carrying scarves, shirts or even papyrus in one hand to sell to you, while attempting to go into your pockets with the other hand. The locals know this goes on, but do not count on them to intervene. Also, women should avoid travelling alone if they are not comfortable with leering men, although they are all bluster. Most horse carriage drivers will not commit on the price when you arrive at your destination and you are expected to give more.\n\n## Cope\nThere is so much to do around the Aswan area that time can be an issue. The local people are generally very cooperative, and for a price, doors might remain opened regardless of the hour.\n\n## Go next\nAbu Simbel – most people use Aswan as a base to see this fantastic temple (765 egp entrance fee nov 2024). Many hotels and tour agencies can offer a mini-bus service, often departing at 4AM and going as part of a larger convoy, often with police together. You might take part in that convoy with your own vehicle. Depending on your negotiation skills the hotel-organised mini-bus costs between LE150–LE350(these prices are outdated due to hyperinflation in Egypt during 2022/23) also try other hotels apart from the one you are staying in. Private cars cost around 2,500 egp (nov 2024) for a return trip from aswan, depending on your haggling skills. There is also a public bus leaving from the bus station north of town, scheduled to depart at 8AM. If all goes well this should get you in Abu Simbel at 11:30AM, return is at 1PM (although you might be able to delay this a little with a nice 'baksheesh' - use at your own discretion) (May 2019).\nKom Ombo – Not far north from Aswan, with the double temple of Ptolemaic. Taxi trips or organized tours are LE150, or you take a (local) train and taxi/tuk-tuk from the railway station (LE10).\nCruises to Luxor – The 2-night cruise should cost from US$75 per night, including meals, depending on the boat.\nFelucca trips to Luxor – see the Felucca guide for a complete itinerary and for information.",

          "content": "Giza (; sometimes spelled Gizah, Gizeh, Geeza, Jiza; Arabic: الجيزة, romanized: al-Jīzah, pronounced [ald͡ʒiːzah], Egyptian Arabic: الجيزة el-Gīza [elˈgiːzæ]) is the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and sixteenth-largest city in Africa by population. It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,458,135 as of 2023. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Memphis (Men-nefer, today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.\nGiza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples and the Grand Egyptian Museum. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.\n\nDistricts and population\nThe city of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate.\n\n2017 population and administrative divisions\nGiza city is a municipal division and capital of Giza governorate with an appointed city head. It comprises nine districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and five new towns (mudun jadidah) administered by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA).\nThe districts/qisms fully subsume to the city head and according to the 2017 census had 4,872,448 residents:\n\nThe new towns are mostly administered by the national level New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), with some public services under the jurisdiction of Giza. They are confusingly named madina (city), however they are not administratively incorporated as such where many are formed of a single district or qism. Ones not in the 2017 census as they were not yet incorporated, or inhabited at that time are:\n\nNew 6th of October\nOctober Gardens\nNew Sphinx\nPermanently inhabited Nile islands:\n\nQorsaya Island (Janoub/Giza district)\nDahab Island  (Janoub/Giza district)\nAl-Warraq Island (Al-Warraq district)\n\n2006 population\nThe city's population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is. The former figure corresponds to the sum of nine districts/qisms.\n\nGeography and climate\nGiza's most famous landform and archaeological site, the Giza Plateau, holds some major monuments of Egyptian history, and is home to the Great Sphinx. Once thriving with the Nile that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the pyramids of Giza were built overlooking the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis, across the river from modern day Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the Prime Meridian, a reference point used for determining a base longitude.\n\nClimate\nGiza experiences a hot desert like arid climate (Köppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Windstorms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow is extremely rare.\nUp to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36 °F) on 8 January 1966.\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nThe area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the second millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex, featuring the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Great Sphinx of Giza and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nClassical to medieval era\nAs ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή) or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning \"the fortress\", now Tersa) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.\nEgyptians called the area Tipersis (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ and Sahidic Coptic: ⲧⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ ⲛ̀ⲃⲁⲃⲩⲗⲱⲛ, lit. 'the Persian (fortress) of Babylon'). Eutychius gives a legend about the city's name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus or Hūš (Arabic: خوش), and Abu Salih says it was found by him at the same time as Qasr ash-Sham, but as older evidence is missing, it is perhaps most likely to have been founded during the Sasanian conquest of Egypt in the early 7th century.\nAs Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD (year 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. Al-Maqrizi suggested an irregular Arameo-Arabic root meaning \"edge, side\" to be the source. Everett-Heath suggested Ancient Egyptian: r-gs-ḥr \"on the side of the height (pyramid)\". Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from Middle Persian: 𐭣𐭦, romanized: diz, lit. 'fortress, castle', which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.\n\nInfrastructure\nGiza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of roads, streets, and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau, and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza's infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d'état, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city's importance in tourism. Giza's St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza.\nThe city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region, the Giza Zoo. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means \"Forest Park\" in the Turkish language.\n\nGiza Zoo\nThe Giza Zoo (حديقة حيوان الجيزة, Ḥadīqat Ḥaywān Al-Gīzah), established on March 1, 1891, holds the distinction of being Africa's first zoo and the world's third oldest zoological garden. Located on approximately 80 acres (32 hectares), the zoo was originally designed as a botanical garden and features several historical architectural elements.\n\nHistorical features\nThe zoo contains several notable architectural and cultural landmarks:\n\nA suspension bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel (1875-1879), considered the world's first elevated zoo viewing platform\nThe Japanese Kiosk, constructed in 1924 during King Fuad's reign\nOriginal gates from the Khedive's Palace and Haramlik Palace\nRoads paved with black stone imported from Trieste\nMosaic-decorated footpaths\nA marble island known as Tea Island\n\nAnimal collection\nThe zoo houses approximately 4,000 animals representing over 175 species, including:\n\nLarge mammals: Lions, tigers, giraffes, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses\nPrimates: Various monkey and ape species\nBirds: Native and exotic species including flamingos and rare birds\nReptiles: Including Egyptian cobras and Nile crocodiles\n\nRecent developments\nIn 2023, the Egyptian government announced plans to expand the number of animal species from 71 to 186. The renovation project includes:\n\nCreation of specialized zones: Asia, Africa, America, Family Zone, Safari Trips\nEstablishment of educational centers\nPreservation of historical landmarks\nImprovement of animal enclosures\n\nOperating hours\nSummer (April-September): 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM\nWinter (October-March): 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM\nThe zoo serves multiple functions as a recreational facility, research institute, and cultural landmark.\n\nTransportation\nTransportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.\nGiza shares with Cairo a subway system, officially called the \"Metro (مترو)\", a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with 6th of October City, Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Traffic in Giza is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.\nOther means of transport include:\n\nCairo Taxi\nUber (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nCareem (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nSwvl (available in Cairo and Giza since 2017)\nWater taxis (motorized feluccas) available for transport to nearby places along the Nile River\n\nEconomy\nIndustries in Giza include film making Giza in a hub of Egyptian studios like Studio Misr and alahram studio, and movie production companies like Al Sobki productions headed by Mohamed Alsobki.\nA main source of income in Giza is tourism as a home to many historical sites including the Great Pyramid and Pyramid of Djoser and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nChemicals is an important industry in Giza, Giza Paints & Chemical Industries was established in 1984. \nGiza has many luxury apartment buildings along the Nile, making it a popular place to live.\n\nInternational access\nAccess to the city of Giza, which has its own governorate adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the Cairo International Airport. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the Imbaba Airport, but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.\nSphinx International Airport was opened in 2018 as an alternative to the already congested Cairo International Airport, but also to improve accessibility to the Giza necropolis as well as to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nEducation\nGiza's learning institutions include Cairo University, which was moved to Giza in 1924. The city is a hub of education and educational services not only for Egypt but also for the entire Mediterranean Region. Giza has numerous schools, kindergartens, and institutes of higher learning.\nThe Cairo Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is in Giza. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule, a German international school, is located in Dokki in Giza. Previously the Pakistan International School of Cairo had its campus in Giza.\n\nSports\nThe city hosts the second most successful sports club in Egypt and Africa, El Zamalek, which is located in the Meet Okba neighbourhood near the Mohandesin neighbourhood. Beside El Zamalek there are other clubs like El Tersana and Seid Shooting Club which is one of the elite clubs in Egypt.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nGiza is twinned with:\n\n Istanbul, Turkey\n Los Angeles, United States\n\nNotable people\nAmr Abou El Seoud (born 1968), bank CEO\nYehia Chahine, actor\nAhmed El-Ahmar, handball player\nAbdel Halim Ali, football player\nNora Armani, actor and filmmaker of Armenian descent\n\nSee also\nGiza church fire\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nList of megalithic sites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDer Manuelian, Peter. 2017.

La visite est de plus en plus canalisée afin d'éviter les nombreuses détériorations effectuées par certains touristes, telle l'inscription de leur passage dans la pierre des mastaba et autres vestiges encore visibles. Le service des Antiquités, qui ne peut pas entreprendre de restaurations ni de fouilles de sauvetage d'envergure tant le site est vaste, met de plus en plus d'œuvres d'art à l'abri, empêchant de ce fait leur accès aux touristes.\nLa liberté de circulation et donc de visite du site s'en voit limitée d'année en année. Il est également prévu d'installer des caméras sur tout le site afin de surveiller les visiteurs, mais également les pilleurs d'antiquités qui se dissimulent parmi les touristes du plateau de Gizeh afin de voler des statues et autres vestiges, d'une grande valeur sur le marché des antiquités. Certains ont été rattrapés et condamnés à des peines allant jusqu'à vingt ans de prison ferme.\nPour limiter les dégradations des pyramides causées par le gaz carbonique rejeté par les visiteurs, des systèmes de ventilation ont été installés et une pyramide sur trois est fermée à tour de rôle chaque année afin que le monument se « repose ».\nEnfin le nouveau projet d'aménagement du site prévoit deux entrées distinctes.

          "content": "## Overview\nPicture yourself in Egypt and you picture this. Imagine Ancient Egypt and this is where your mind will land. Here is Giza, the city just west of Cairo, where on a desert plateau stand the Pyramids, Sphinx and royal tombs of the pharaohs.\n\n## Understand\nEverything west of the Nile's eastern bank is actually in the City of Giza (الجيزة el-Gīza) rather than the City of Cairo. It's a huge conurbation that includes the Nile islands of Gezira and Roda, the riverside neighbourhoods of Dokki and Mohandeseen, and mile after mile of tatty low-rise and 'burbs. Giza plus Cairo and three other townships make up the Greater Cairo Metropolis. But of course the top sight is the UNESCO World Heritage site Pyramids of Giza, at the western edge of the city, in the \"Haram\" district. The Grand Egyptian Museum has started its trial phase already and is open to visitors. This means that Giza is developing into a tourist base in its own right, especially along the main axis of the Haram or Pyramids Road.\nIt's difficult now to imagine this place 100 years ago, with early tourists arriving by carriage along unpaved roads through the fields. The vast, grubby metropolis now sprawls right to the foot of the pyramids complex. Fortunately, development has been prevented (or removed) on the plateau, so the pyramids still stand proud in an arid expanse. A low ridge cuts the view to the south & west so it feels like the threshold of the Sahara, not just a sandy park or anti-oasis in the midst of burbs and more burbs. To the southeast, the pyramids of Abusir and Saqqara shimmer in the distance.\nLots of countries have ancient pyramids: Mexico, Indonesia, Greece, Sudan, Iran. Egypt has at least 135, with perhaps more undiscovered, but Sudan has about 240. The three main Pyramids in Giza are the focal point of the Giza necropolis, or cemetery, that served the elite of the Old Kingdom capital at nearby Memphis in the 2500s BCE. Three pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty were buried here, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, along with members of their royal household. They chose it, west of Memphis, because west was the direction of the afterlife.\nThe new pyramids were magnificent, but they were something of a giveaway to tomb-robbers. Later pharaohs preferred hidden tombs, such as those in the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor. (So it's from these hidden tombs that most Egyptian mummies and artifacts have been recovered.) All the pyramids fell into disrepair, were repeatedly breached by robbers, and their stone cladding was pilfered for building. Wind and rain have whittled them down. However, they're still magnificent.\nAnother magnificent thing about the pyramids is their age: when the Great Pyramids were being constructed, mammoths still roamed Siberia and North America. Forty-two centuries (4200 years) have seen these pyramids stand tall and proud over the cities of the Nile delta.\n\n## Get in\nWhen seeking transport, ask for \"Haram\" and shape your hands like a pyramid by making an upside down Vicory sign with your index and middle finger: people, especially minibus drivers will know where you want to go. Also, see Egypt#By metro or Egypt#By train for more details.\nIn Summer 2025 the gates the the park were reconfigured. The Mena Gate that you could enter from the east was closed. A new main gate was established to the south of the park that has a higher capacity but requires you to take a shuttle bus or a long walk through the park get to what you want to see. There is a sneaky subgate, at the southeast of the park, near the sphinx, which is normally used as an exit but where you can also buy tickets (the ticket office is in an alleyway on the right of the gate), and here you'll enter almost right under the sphinx.\n\n## By plane\nSphinx International Airport (SPX  IATA) near Giza opened in 2020 and as of 2025 has flights with Wizzair from the UK, UAE and various other points in Europe.\n\n## By train\nThe main railway line between Cairo and Luxor/Aswan runs through Giza, where most services halt, so you can travel along the Nile valley without backtracking via downtown Cairo. Indeed some seasonal sleeper trains start from Giza rather than Cairo Ramses station.\n30.00595131.2079651 El Giza railway station, Al Omraneyah Ash Sharqeyah, Al Omraneyah.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## By taxi\nGet an Uber or InDrive to the pyramids. From anywhere in Cairo it won't cost you more than LE150.\nAll the standard warnings about Cairo taxis (see Cairo#By taxi) apply with even greater force around this prime tourist spot. So many tourists, so many of them unwary or jet-lagged, let's fleece these lambs! And it's remarkable how swiftly a \"broken\" taxi meter is restored to life once the driver sees you're serious about bailing out. Taxi drivers may pressure you to see the pyramid complex on horseback, and take you to their friend's stable, but the site is walkable (only a few kilometers across in any direction, maybe 10 km² in area total).\nThe taxi should be able to take you right to the pyramids entrance gate at the very end of the avenue, whereas buses and other vehicles must stop about 500 m short of there. Coming back, taxis will be waiting around the exit gate near the Sphinx.\n\n## By metro/bus\nTake the metro to the Giza metro station. From near there, frequent buses and microbuses run west towards the pyramids, for a fare of LE7. Listen out for conductors shouting \"Haram!\" or look for route numbers 355 or 357. Many of these buses, along with routes 900 and 997, start from central Cairo: look for them around Midan Tahrir. A bus from downtown will be a slow, bumpy experience, as Giza town traffic is just as congested as central Cairo traffic, so use the Metro to get to Giza station and take the microbus from there.\nAs of 2025, the metro is being extended towards the pyramids and the entire road is a construction project, so it can be somewhat of a maze to find the buses and minibuses that can take you toward the pyramids. Don't ask around at the metro station; people will try to hustle you. Instead just point yourself in the direction of the main east-west road and once you find the road walk west until you see minibuses or people waiting impatiently for one. Once you find local Egyptians uninterested in your visit to the pyramids they'll typically be kind and helpful.\nBuses and microbuses can only run to within 500m of the old Mena Gate, then they must either turn back or turn off North into the burbs. However, the Mena Gate was closed in 2025, and you need to exit at the intersection where your ride deviates from its western course. Do not walk west to the Mena Gate, lest you want to finally hear taxi drivers telling you the truth that something is closed. Instead, you must walk south for about 25 minutes (if it's hot, consider the wisdom of this) to head to the subgate that is normally used as an exit near the sphinx. Surprisingly, you can buy tickets here as well, and in fact this is a much quicker way to get to the pyramids and the sphinx than using the new main gate further on.\n\n## Pyramids\nSee also Giza with children article for practical suggestions.\nThe pyramids and associated sites are on the plateau 8 km west of Giza downtown. You'll see them looming up as you approach along Al-Haram Road. You can enter the complex by the main gate at the western terminus of that road. You'll then progress anti-clockwise through the site, eventually to exit near the Sphinx. Alternativelly, you can buy a ticket and enter near the Sphinx; however, in that case, you'll walk up the hill. Both entrances can also be used as exits.\nIgnore the nay-sayers who say this place is not worth the bother: it definitely is. It's spacious and absorbs the crowds (which are greater on Friday when Egyptians come to visit on droves.) The standard advice is to come very early to beat the crowds, who will arrive fairly soon after you. If you come in the cool months the midday sun is not hot, albeit still strong on UV. What's less obvious is whether the pyramid interiors are worth it, and you do need to come early for those. The extra admission is not too cheap and the interiors are hot, humid, cramped, claustrophobic and lacking \"atmosphere\" in any sense. The passages are steep, dusty and hard to move through, and those with any heart or lung or musculo-skeletal limitations will be miserable at best.\nIn good weather, the site is walkable if you're moderately fit -- there is no need for a camel or horse ride, and some people express concern about the way the animals are treated. You can also walk out to the west of the pyramids for a great panorama. In the heat of the summer, you may feel differently.\nIn all cases, most hustlers give up if you just wave them off with your hand and smile saying \"Thank you\". Avoid any further conversation and/or help or photos!\nThe complex is open daily 07:00-17:00 (and winter until 16:00). Individual sites within the complex may close earlier.\nEntry fees for foreigners (as of October 2024), students get 50% discount:\nGeneral admission to the complex: LE540\nEntrance to the Great (Khufu/Cheops) Pyramid : LE900\nEntrance to the Pyramid of Khafre or Menkaure: LE220\nEntrance to the Tomb of Mars Ankh: LE120\nEntrance to the Tombs of the Laborers: LE700\nAll these tickets can be bought at 29.9816231.132431 the main entrance, at the 29.9754531.1407912 Eastern entrance as well as at the entrances to the sites (but it is recommended to use the first two mentioned). Never surrender your ticket: the entrance guards will tear it and give it back to you. Anything else is a scam or a hustle.\nThe Great Pyramid interior is always open, while access to Khafre and Menkaure pyramid interiors alternates each year. Limited numbers of these extra tickets are available each day, so by mid-morning they might be all gone; there isn't a pre-booking system. No cameras are allowed into the pyramids.\n29.97972231.1344441 Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops). 8AM-noon, 1-4PM. The oldest, the largest in Egypt, and the last surviving representative of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built to a height of 146 m (479 ft), but is now slightly reduced to a still towering 137 m (449 ft). Over 2 million blocks of stone were used to construct it, all through manual labour. Entry to the interior is on the north side, facing your approach. LE900.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97160931.1278352 Queens' Pyramids and Nobles' Tombs. All over the complex, but especially around the Great Pyramid, are various of these pyramids and tombs. On its eastern flank, you'll find the burial pits for his \"solar boats\", to carry him into the afterlife. Along the west flank are noblemen's tombs, such as those of Senegemib. Several of these tombs are open to visit and usually free of tourist hordes. There's no extra charge though baksheesh may be appreciated. Enjoy the peace and quiet in the shade of one of the Queen's pyramids along the south flank of Menkaure's Pyramid to take a little break from the hustle on the plateau.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97631.1309723 Pyramid of Khafre (Pyramid of Chephren). Khafre was the son and successor of Khufu. His pyramid (at 136 m) is slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid, but it's set on higher ground so it looks larger. A few blocks of the original limestone cladding survive at its tip; once all the pyramids were fully encased in this way. Entry to the interior is on the north flank.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.972531.1283334 Pyramid of Menkaure. Menkaure was probably the son and successor of Khafre. His pyramid is the smallest here at 62 m high, originally 66.5 m. Entry to the interior is on the north flank. Along the south flank are his Queens' pyramids, and on the east flank is his funerary temple. LE220.      (updated Oct 2024)\nAncient causeways link the Khafre and Menkaure pyramids to the necropolis entrance gate next to the Sphinx. At the foot of each is another small temple dedicated to that pharaoh. The causeways are rough going so you may prefer to loop back along the paved driveway. The horse and camel-drivers will now be getting a bit desperate as you approach the exit, and will drop their prices; keep walking.\n29.9752731.137685 Great Sphinx of Giza. Like pyramids, sphinxes (ancient and modern) are found in many lands; this one is specifically the Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a single block of sandstone 45 m long by 22 m wide, bearing a man's head upon a lion's haunches. It is understood, by mainstream archeologists, to have been carved out of the bedrock in the reign of Khafre, bears his likeness, and represents a guardian spirit of the necropolis. Its original name is unknown but it was variously dubbed \"Horus of the horizon\" for the sun god or Abu el-Hol (\"Father of Terror\"). We know it by its Greek name Sphinx, which may mean \"strangler\" (as a lion crushes the neck of its prey, or the fate of those who failed to answer its riddles), or may simply mean \"carved from living rock\". Being solid, it has no inner passageways.It's a frankly mangy-looking lion and its face has always presented an irresistible target. The nose was hacked off by the 15th-century but each successive wave of rulers has blamed the previous lot: 20th-century Egyptians blamed the Brits who blamed Napoleonic troops who blamed the Ottoman Turks. The broken-off regal beard is now in the British Museum.The Sphinx faces east and you approach it, nearing the exit gate, along its north flank. This means that its main features will be in shade, you need morning light for a good photo. (Unlike the pyramids, always with one flank upturned to the sun and the deified Khufu.) To get closer you can pay extra for the enclosure just in front of its paws. There's little point in doing so, the place is crowded with people taking silly selfies, and the slightly closer view just emphasises the manginess.      (updated Oct 2024)\n\n## Grand Egyptian Museum\n29.99361131.1197226 Grand Egyptian Museum (المتحف المصري الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Miṣriyy al-Kabīr), El Remayah Square, Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, Giza (2 km northwest of the Pyramids), ☏ +20 235317344, tourism_info@easwaaqmisr.com. 09:00-17:00. The Grand Egyptian Museum is the long-awaited primary replacement for the venerable Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir, with much bigger exhibition, storage and workplace areas. It was formally opened on 1 November 2025. LE1200.      (updated Aug 2025)\n\n## At the pyramids\nBefore you get on the back of a camel or horse have a look at how they treat their animals. You might change your mind. If you anyway decide to take the offer of one of the horsemen or camel guys, make sure you discuss the price and where you go first. Ask to confirm it covers two people/two horses. Negotiate the price you want. At the end of the trip, when you get back to where you had agreed, get off the horse/camel, hand the man the agreed money and walk away. They will try to come up with all sorts of scams to get more money out of you. If you are happy and wish to give a tip, do it because you choose. Don't feel pressured into giving extra. Just walk away. They won't follow you.\nCamel rides. Avoid succumbing to the temptation of taking a camel ride around the Pyramids, if you can, the practice is noisy, smelly and overrated. Basically, there are many better places in Egypt to take a camel ride, if you must. Things are a little better run than they used to be, and the practice of taking tourists out into the desert and refusing to return unless \"tipped\" is rather rare now.\nGo horse riding in the desert to experience the spirit of the Egyptian horses and the true majesty of the Pyramids seen from outside the 'circus ring' wall. Be careful of touts, however; it's best to ride from one of the better quality stables, like FB Stables or Cairo Horse Riding School. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield on a half day trip to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out overnight with a barbecue and fire. You can also watch the Sound and Light show from FB's rooftop terrace. If you do ride with a tout (they will encourage you to do this if the area is closed for entry for example) they will make out that you will have a great view of the pyramids (which you won't), they will then charge you a fortune, ride at high speed through the streets without a helmet or any regard for safety, they will then demand a tip as you ride back and try to take you to a 'museum' which is a just shop where you will be pressured to buy.\nSee the sunrise, the first sun beams colouring the Pyramids from the terrace on the third floor of a cafe or from the roof terrace of the hostel situated near the second western entrance and ticket-office.\n[dead link] Cairo Horse Riding School, Mansouriya Road (Ext 31 Maadi Ring Road), ☏ +20 1207362425. This expat-run stable is situated inside a pristine Arabian horse ranch about ten minutes away from the Pyramids. The emphasis is on compassionate horsemanship and most of their school horses are rescues from the pyramid area which they have lovingly rehabilitated. They offer rides in the peaceful parts of the Giza desert and along countryside lanes, and longer rides to the Abu Sir Pyramid complex or jumping and dressage lessons inside their arena. (updated Mar 2017)\nFB Stables, Gamal Abdul Nasser St, Sphinx (turn left after the sphinx KFC, then right in Gamal Abdul Nasser Street -- FB is the last stables on the left), ☏ +20 106 507 0288. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, Karim at FB Stables is also great for a \"tourist\" type ride to view the Pyramids and Sphinx from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Sir can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and moonlit rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivalled views over the Pyramids: a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light shows. Great horses, and no beating.\n29.9746531.139511 [dead link] Pyramids Sound and Light Show (Son-et-Lumière) (entrance is by the Sphinx gate (i.e. the pyramids exit)), info@soundandlight.com.eg. Daily 7PM in English, 8PM in another language. Distinctly kitsch but a fun evening if you're in the right mood. The \"voice of the Sphinx\" narrates (often inaccurately) the history of the Giza necropolis and its place in Egyptian history, while a laser display picks out details of the Pyramids and projects scenes onto the side of the Great Pyramid. There are two shows each evening, the first in English and the second in another European language: free headphone translations are available if you're in the \"wrong\" show. In busier times there is a third show, but nowadays this is just (not Fridays) for special bookings, with other languages available. Bring warm clothing. The same company puts on very similar sound & light shows at Luxor-Karnak, Edfu and Philae. You could watch the whole thing cheaper, and almost as well, by eating at Pizza Hut opposite and paying a baksheesh to sit on the terrace. LE130.    (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Elsewhere\n30.0238831.214452 Giza Zoo. The main zoo of Greater Cairo, founded in 1891. 2 km NE of Giza metro station but near the riverside, so if you're coming from downtown especially with children, it's easier to take a taxi. This is an old-fashioned zoo with a poor record for safety and animal welfare.      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.98331.137613 Mena House Oberoi Golf Course (In front of the pyramids).    (updated Dec 2018)\n30.02953431.2140344 Orman Botanical Garden (in front of the Giza Zoo). 9AM–4PM. LE5 per person and LE20 per car.

Advertised as \"the living museum of Egyptian history, with replicas of an ancient village & the tomb of Tutankhamen.\" Actors dressed as ancient Egyptians play various scenes. Not very authentic, but can be interesting for kids. It has several museums and lots of souvenir shops.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Buy\nAl Amir Perfume Palace, 9 Abu el Houl St., ☏ +20 2 385 4963. An overwhelming smell will hit you as soon as you walk inside, if you can stand the smell for more than a few minutes you can find some good deals on perfume.\nLegends and Legacies, 20 Abuu Hazim St. (Off of Pyramid Road). A relaxed indoor bazaar.\nBeymen, FourSeasons Nile Plaza. Chic designer shopping including brands such Chanel, Prada, Gucci, and Christian Dior.\n\n## Eat\nWestern fast food options are located opposite the main ticket gates to the Pyramid enclosure, Pizza Hut and KFC included, so you can munch on a Tower burger and sip on a Coke in air-conditioned comfort whilst gazing on the more than 4,000-year-old Sphinx across the road. Many may prefer a more authentic experience, although the novelty of the situation could be interesting.\n\n## Budget\n29.97759931.1427981 El Gizawy restaurant, Nazlet El-Semman, Al Haram. At the pyramids entrance where the homestays are. Local specialties. The staff speaks sufficiently good English. Popular with the locals. Falafel for LE7, Egyptian pasta for LE25.    (updated Dec 2022)\n\n## Splurge\n29.98555631.1327782 Marriott Mena House, 6 Pyramids Road, ☏ +20 2 3833222. Built in 1869 as a royal lodge for King Ismail the Magnificent, this magnificent palace has housed guests including Empress Eugenie and Prince Albert. Tastefully restored and located very close to the Pyramids. Rooms in the newer Garden wing from US$150, Palace wing rooms from $210; be sure to ask for a room with a view of the Pyramids. The main Pyramids gate is a 5-minute walk away.      (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Drink\nSince Egypt is a Muslim country, alcohol is not generally permitted. It will generally only be served in hotels.\nYou might find more options in Gezira neighborhood.\n29.99061131.1343031 El Mandara Coffee Shop, Abou Al Mohsen (close to Pyramids). Local cafe with Hookahs and non-alcoholic drinks, black tea and Egyptian coffee, frequented by locals, inside and streetside sitting. LE3-10.    (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are a number of 29.97591531.1414771 accommodations near the entrance to the pyramids. You gonna find hotels, homestays and hostels, many of them with a pyramid view. A good area to stay is around the street Abou Al Hool Al Seiahi. There you find touristy and non-touristy restaurants and grocery stores around.\n\n## Cope\nDecent toilets are next to the ticket office and inside the boat museum (if you have that ticket). From the main entrance, you enter the complex and ascend the driveway towards the Great Pyramid, suitably awe-inspired, and muttering a continual \"lah shukran, lah shukran\" to dismiss the touts, guides, and offers of camels. If you do fancy a ride, see \"Do\" below.\n\n## Stay safe\nClimbing the Pyramids is dangerous and strictly illegal. It adds to wear and tear on the structure, and any stumble is likely to prove fatal. Also, it's hard gritty work and not nearly as cool as you'd imagined, so don't think about it.\nThe Giza Pyramids, being the main tourist attraction in Egypt, attract millions of tourists each year. They likewise attract a large number of the most determined opportunists for miles around. Report any instances of harassment by camel drivers and tourist touts to the black-uniformed (or white-uniformed in the summer) Tourist Police immediately, and be prepared for all manner of potential scams, possibly including \"advice\" from official-looking individuals that an attraction is closed or has an alternate entrance. Also be aware that any \"favour\" of any kind (offering directions, being shown something, etc.) might be done in expectation of a tip, so be cautious when accepting unsolicited help (although don't let your holiday be spoiled by overzealous caution, you also might encounter genuine help). Also note that some Tourist Police might routinely offer to help you in the expectation of a tip. Many known scammers will operate in front of the tourist police, who are either in on it or don't bother to intervene.\nIf on your own, headphones make the incessant \"Hello, where are you from my friend\" conversation-starters easier to ignore, smiling and pointing at the headphones seems to do the trick.\nAvoid making eye contact, starting conversations or accepting any help with taking pictures or posing for pictures for you: they will see you as an easy target for harassment.\nSay \"La Shukran\" (No thanks) as you do this, it shows you know a bit more than the average tourist and will not be seen as aggressive or rude. Smiling as you say it doesn't hurt as it doesn't seem to be seen as an invite to talk, but shows you are not trying to offend.\nBe cautious when choosing a local horse or camel ride; you may be ripped off or put in dangerous situations. The \"donkey-mafia\" that operate by the doors of the main entrance will adopt the most \"persuasive\" and often bullish techniques to get you onto their animals, and they do not appear to understand the meaning of the word \"No\". They will cause such a scene when you say no and have to get off them, which will result in you having to pay for the privilege of refusing their hospitality. Note: Some of these people were involved in the Battle of the Camels during the revolution, in which innocent civilians were killed. Use as your conscience dictates.\nAs anywhere else in Egypt, in hot months especially, take plenty of bottled water with you, wear a hat and wear sunscreen—sunglasses are also definitely a good idea.\n\n## Go next\nCairo/Downtown – where you can see the Egyptian Museum, Cairo Tower, El-Cornish, sail in Nile Cruise, hotels, restaurants, etc. Then you can go to El-Moez St., El-Hussain area, Khan El-Khalili, and Old Cairo Churches. From near the entrance of the pyramids area, take the 29.97736731.142762 city bus line 2001 to the Giza metro station or any microbus going the same way. In Google Maps, the bus stop at the pyramids is called \"bus terminal\". From the Giza station the metro brings you to Downtown cairo. Neither that city bus nor the metro have A/C, so it's just a good option in winter time. In other seasons it's better to take an Uber/Careem.",

          "content": "Faiyum ( fy-YOOM; Arabic: الفيوم, romanized: el-Fayyūm, locally [elfæjˈjuːm]) is a city in Middle Egypt. Located 100 kilometres (62 miles) southwest of Cairo, in the Faiyum Oasis, it is the capital of the modern Faiyum Governorate. It is one of Egypt's oldest cities due to its strategic location.\n\nName and etymology\nOriginally founded by the ancient Egyptians as Shedet, its current name in English is also spelled as Fayum, Faiyum or al-Faiyūm. Faiyum was also previously officially named Madīnat al-Faiyūm (Arabic for The City of Faiyum). The name Faiyum (and its spelling variations) may also refer to the Faiyum Oasis, although it is commonly used by Egyptians today to refer to the city.\nThe modern name of the city comes from Coptic  ̀Ⲫⲓⲟⲙ /Ⲡⲉⲓⲟⲙ epʰiom/peiom (whence also the personal name Ⲡⲁⲓⲟⲙ payom), meaning the Sea or the Lake, which in turn comes from late Egyptian pꜣ-ym of the same meaning, a reference to the nearby Lake Moeris; the extinct elephant ancestor Phiomia was named after it.\n\nAncient history\nArchaeological evidence has found occupations around the Faiyum dating back to at least the Epipalaeolithic. Middle Holocene occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of Lake Moeris, where Gertrude Caton Thompson and Elinor Wight Gardner did a number of excavations of Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic sites, as well as a general survey of the area. Recently the area has been further investigated by a team from the UCLA/RUG/UOA Fayum Project.\nAccording to Roger S. Bagnall, habitation began in the fifth millennium BC and a settlement was established by the Old Kingdom (c. 2685–2180 BC) called Shedet (Medinet el-Fayyum). It was the most significant centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek (borrowed from the Demotic pronunciation as Koine Greek: Σοῦχος Soûkhos, and then into Latin as Suchus). In consequence, the Greeks called it \"Crocodile City\" (Koine Greek: Κροκοδειλόπολις Krokodeilópolis), which was borrowed into Latin as Crocodīlopolis. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called, in Koine, Petsuchos, \"the Son of Soukhos\", that was adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors. When Petsuchos died, it was replaced by another.\n\nUnder the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the city was called Ptolemais Euergétis (Koine Greek: Πτολεμαῒς Εὐεργέτις) until Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) renamed the city Arsinoë and the whole nome after the name of his sister-wife Arsinoe II (316–270 or 268), who was deified after her death as part of the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, the official religion of the kingdom. Ptolemy II Philadelphus also established a town at the edge of Faiyum named Philadelphia. It was laid out in a regular grid plan to resemble a typical Greek city, with private dwellings, palaces, baths and a theatre.\nUnder the Roman Empire, Arsinoë became part of the province of Arcadia Aegypti. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name, it was called \"Arsinoë in Arcadia\".\nWith the arrival of Christianity, Arsinoë became the seat of a bishopric, a suffragan of Oxyrhynchus, the capital of the province and the metropolitan see. Michel Le Quien gives the names of several bishops of Arsinoë, nearly all of them associated with one heresy or another.\nThe Catholic Church, considering Arsinoë in Arcadia to be no longer a residential bishopric, lists it as a titular see.\nFayyum was the seat of Shahralanyozan, governor of Sasanian Egypt (619–629).\nThe 10th-century Bible exegete, Saadia Gaon, thought el-Fayyum to have actually been the biblical city of Pithom, mentioned in Exodus 1:11.\nAround 1245 CE, the region became the subject of the most detailed government survey to survive from the medieval Arab world, conducted by Abū ‘Amr ‘Uthman Ibn al-Nābulusī.\n\nFaiyum mummy portraits\nFaiyum is the source of some famous death masks or mummy portraits painted during the Roman occupation of the area. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead, despite the Roman preference for cremation. While under the control of the Roman Empire, Egyptian death masks were painted on wood in a pigmented wax technique called encaustic—the Faiyum mummy portraits represent this technique. While previously believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt, modern studies conclude that the Faiyum portraits instead represent mainly native Egyptians (source needed), reflecting the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.\n\nThe Zenon Papyri\nThe construction of the settlement of Philadelphia under Ptolemy II Philadelphus was recorded in detail by a 3rd-century BC Greek public official named Zeno (or Zenon, Greek: Ζήνων). Zeno, a native of Kaunos in lower Asia Minor, came to Faiyum to work as private secretary to Apollonius, the finance minister to Ptolemy II Philadelphus (and later to Ptolemy III Euergetes). During his employment, Zeno wrote detailed descriptions of the construction of theatres, gymnasiums, palaces and baths in the 250s and 240s BC, as well as making copious written records of various legal and financial transactions between citizens.\nDuring the winter of 1914–1915, a cache of over 2,000 papyrus documents was uncovered by Egyptian agricultural labourers who were digging for sebakh near Kôm el-Kharaba el-Kebir. Upon examination by Egyptology scholars, these documents were found to be records written by Zeno in Greek and Demotic. These papyri, now referred to as the Zenon Archive or the Zenon Papyri, have provided historians with a detailed record of 3rd-century BC Philadelphia society and economy. The discovery site was identified as the former location of ancient Philadelphia. Today, the precise location of the town is unknown, although archaeologists have identified two sites in north-east Faiyum as the possible location for Philadelphia.\n\nModern city\nFaiyum has several large bazaars, mosques, baths and a much-frequented weekly market. The canal called Bahr Yussef runs through the city, its banks lined with houses. There are two bridges over the river: one of three arches, which carries the main street and bazaar, and one of two arches, over which is built the Qaitbay mosque, a gift from his wife to honor the Mamluk Sultan in Fayoum. Mounds north of the city mark the site of Arsinoe, known to the ancient Greeks as Crocodilopolis, where in ancient times the sacred crocodile kept in Lake Moeris was worshipped.\nThe center of the city is on the canal, with four waterwheels which were adopted by the governorate of Fayoum as its symbol; their chariots and bazaars are easy to spot. The city is home of the football club Misr Lel Makkasa SC, that play in the Egyptian Second Division.\n\nMain sights\nThe population of Faiyum Governorate is 4,164,914.\nThe Hanging Mosque, built when the Ottomans ruled Egypt by prince Marawan bin Hatem\nHawara, an archeological site 27 km (17 mi) from the city\nLahun Pyramids, 4 km (2 mi) outside the city\nQaitbay Mosque, in the city; built by the wife of the Mamluk Sultan Qaitbay\nQasr Qarun, 44 km (27 mi) from the city\nWadi Elrayan or Wadi Rayan, the largest waterfalls in Egypt, around 50 km (31 mi) from the city\nWadi Al-Hitan or Valley of whales, a paleontological site in the Al Fayyum Governorate, some 150 km (93 mi) southwest of Cairo. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nClimate\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\nThe highest record temperatures was 46 °C (115 °F) on June 13, 1965, and the lowest record temperature was 2 °C (36 °F) on January 8, 1966.\n\nNotable people\nPeople from Faiyum may be known as al-Fayyumi:\n\nTefta Tashko-Koço (1910-1947), well-known Albanian singer, was born in Faiyum, where her family lived at that time.\nSaadia Gaon (882/892-942), the influential Jewish teacher of the early 10th century, was originally from Faiyum and often called al-Fayyumi.\nYoussef Wahbi (1898-1982), a notable Egyptian actor, well known for his influence on the development of Egyptian cinema and theater.\nMohamed Ihab (b. 1989), Egypt's most decorated weightlifter.

Archaeological evidence has found occupations around the Fayum dating back to at least the Epipalaeolithic. Middle Holocene occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of Lake Moeris.\nIn ancient Egypt, the city was called Shedet, a centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek (Koinē Greek: Σοῦχος Soûkhos, Latin: Suchus). In consequence, the Greeks called it \"Crocodile City\" (Koinē Greek: Κροκοδειλόπολις Krokodeilópolis), Crocodīlopolis in Latin. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called in Koine Petsuchos, \"the Son of Soukhos\", adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors. When Petsuchos died, it was replaced by another.\nUnder the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the city was for a while called Ptolemais Euergétis (Koinē Greek: Πτολεμαῒς Εὐεργέτις). Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) renamed the city Arsinoë and the whole nome after the name of his sister-wife Arsinoe II (316–270 or 268), who was deified after her death as part of the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, the official religion of the kingdom.\nUnder the Roman Empire, Arsinoë became part of the province of Arcadia Aegypti. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name, it was called \"Arsinoë in Arcadia\".\n\n## Get in\nBy microbus from different regions in Cairo e.g. Ramsis Square and also from different regions in Giza e.g. El-Remaya Square (Shotting Square) and El-Moneeb.

          "content": "## Overview\nMinya is a city in Middle Egypt. Usually overlooked by tourists, this city has a long history and some interesting heritage to explore. It is home to over 250,000 people and lies about 245 km south of Cairo. Its strategic location in central Egypt has gained it the nickname Bride of Upper Egypt. It's a centre of Christianity in the country, as half of the town's inhabitants are reported to be Coptic Christians.\n\n## Understand\nMinya was once an autonomous city-state that transformed into a nome or district of ancient Egypt called Oryx under the rule of Menes in its earliest recorded times. Then it became known as Menat Khufu as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu who built the Great Pyramid of Cheops. From there, it went through alliances with Thebans and then the Hyksos, which didn't end up working out too well since the native Egyptian pharaohs gave the Hyksos a thrashing around 1540 BC and didn't do Minya many favors in the process. All that remains of the ancient civilization of Menat Khufu are these tombs that the rulers carved into some cliffs in nearby Beni Hasan since they were to poor to build pyramids.\nAncient Greece and Rome subsequently made their mark on the area, with settlements and cotton cultivation. The Roman Emperor Hadrian even had a separate city called Antinoöpolis built along the Nile nearby in memory of his eromenos Antinous. In 328 AD, the mother of Constantine had the Monastery of the Virgin Mary at Gebel el-Teir constructed on a site where the Holy Family was thought to have stayed during their flight from Herod.\nAnd then, the Arabs established their presence by turning Minya into a robust medieval city complete with stately mosques and schools from about the 10th century on. Modern times saw it develop with some colonial-style architecture and separation into two districts, but then fall into a state of decay on account of the revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956 and the subsequent nationalization of many industries from 1957.\n\n## Get in\nThere is the option of driving or taking the train from Cairo, Alexandria, Aswan, etc, as Minya has one train station connected to Egyptian National Railways, though English assistance might not be available:\n28.096830.753981 El Minya Railway Station (محطة سكة حديد المنيا), ☏ +20 86 2363035.

          "title": "Port Said",
          "content": "Port Said ( sah-EED, Arabic: بورسعيد, romanized: Bōrsaʿīd, pronounced [boɾsæˈʕiːd, poɾ-]) is a port city that lies in northeast Egypt extending about 30 km (19 mi) along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. The city is the capital of the Port Said Governorate and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate's eight regions. At the beginning of 2023 it had a population of 680,375 people.\nThe city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is Port Fuad, which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free ferries running all through the day, and together they form a metropolitan area with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.\nPort Said acted as a global city since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a cosmopolitan community. Referring to this fact, Rudyard Kipling once said, \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of London and Port Said\". Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region.\n\nName\nThe name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an international committee composed of the UK, France, the Russian Empire, Austria, Spain and Piedmont. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: the French word port (marine harbour) and Said (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted Ferdinand de Lesseps the concession to dig the Suez Canal. Urbanized residents pronounce the name [boɾsæˈʕiːd] or [poɾsæˈʕiːd], while unurbanized residents pronounce it [bɔɾsaˈʕɛˑd].\nIn Ancient Greek, the city was called Πηλούσιον (Pēloúsion).\n\nHistory\nFounding (1859)\nPort Said was founded by Sa'id of Egypt on Easter Monday, 25 April 1859, when Ferdinand de Lesseps gave the first symbolic swing of the pickaxe to signal the beginning of construction. The first problem encountered was the difficulty for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden jetty was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.\nThere were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the Sweet Water Canal could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or \"Beton Coignet\", which was named after its inventor François Coignet. Blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the lighthouse of Port Said, the only original building still standing in Port Said.\nIn 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 – with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, 400 m (1,300 ft) to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of Lake Manzala reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings; over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.\nSince its establishment, Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt.\n\nThriving international port and city (1902–1945)\nAt the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from Mataria started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to Cairo. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans \"of all nations\". During the First World War, Port Said became home to an important Allied hospital. Due to the strategic location of Port Said intersecting Europe, Africa and Asia, thousands of men were sent to this hospital. This included soldiers wounded as a result from the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. Following the end of the World War I, the directors of the Suez Canal Company decided to create a new city on the Asian bank, building 300 houses for its labourers and functionaries. Port Fouad was designed by the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.\nSince its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city. Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.\nIn 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings.\n\nRevolution, end of British occupation (1946–present)\nFollowing World War II, Egypt denounced the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Suez Canal in 1951.\nThe Egyptian Revolution of 1952 led to the toppling of King Farouk. On 26 July 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tensions with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the Suez Crisis. On 6 November 1956, British troops violently landed in Port Said while firing on the Egyptian military. Port Said next was bombed by the British, to terrorise the civilians, of whom hundreds died. There was also heavy fighting in the streets with again many civilian casualties, and the resulting fires destroyed much of the city.\nThe withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on 23 December 1956. Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia. Most of the Greek community was also expelled or left the town under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nAfter the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the Six-Day War, the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the Yom Kippur War (1973).\nThe city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 794,720.\n\nEconomy\nPort Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the Human Development Index in 2009 and 2010; the economic base of the city is fishing and industries, like chemicals, ultra-processed food, and cigarettes. Port Said is also an important harbour for exports of Egyptian products like cotton and rice, and additionally a fueling station for ships that pass through the Suez Canal.

          "summary": "Port Said ( sah-EED, Arabic: بورسعيد, romanized: Bōrsaʿīd, pronounced [boɾsæˈʕiːd, poɾ-]) is a port city that lies in northeast Egypt extending about 30 km (19 mi) along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. The city is the capital of the Port Said Governorate and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate's eight regions. At the beginning of 2023 it had a population of 680,375 people.\nThe city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is Port Fuad, which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free ferries running all through the day, and together they form a metropolitan area with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.\nPort Said acted as a global city since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a cosmopolitan community. Referring to this fact, Rudyard Kipling once said, \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of London and Port Said\". Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region.",

          "content": "Marsa Matrouh (Arabic: مرسى مطروح), also transliterated as Marsa Matruh (Standard Arabic Marsā Maṭrūḥ, [ˈmæɾsæ mɑtˤˈɾuːħ]), is a port in Egypt and the capital of Matrouh Governorate. It is located 240 km (150 mi) west of Alexandria and 222 km (138 mi) east of Sallum on the main highway from the Nile Delta to the Libyan border. The city is also accessible from the south via another highway running through the Western Desert towards Siwa Oasis and Bahariya Oasis.\nMersa Matruh was a major grain port under the Romans and a military base of the British Empire. During World War II, several battles were fought around its environs as the Italo-German Panzer Army Africa attempted to capture the port. It fell to the Axis during the Battle of Mersa Matruh but was recaptured following the Second Battle of El Alamein.\nMersa Matruh is served by Mersa Matruh International Airport. The city features soft white sand beaches and calm transparent waters; the bay is protected from the high seas by a series of rocks forming a natural breakwater, with a small opening to allow access for light vessels.\n\nHistory\nMersa Matruh began as a small fishing town but was important enough to host an Egyptian temple under Ramesses II c. 1200 BC. It prospered as the port for the 8th-century BC oracle of Amun Ra at the Siwa Oasis. \nIt became known as Ammonia (Ancient Greek: Ἀμμωνία, Ammōnía) after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC. Under the Ptolemaic dynasty and Romans, it was also known as Paraetonium (Koine Greek: Παραιτόνιον, Paraitónion; Coptic: ⲧⲡⲁⲣⲁⲧⲟⲛⲓⲟⲛ, Tparatonion). It served as a major transit port for Egyptian grain to Rome. Ovid wrote that its patron goddess during his era was Isis.\nThe city was Christianized by the 6th century, when a chapel was built in the Byzantine style.\nAfter the 7th-century conquest of Egypt by the Caliphate, it became known as Baritun (Arabic: البارتون, al-Bāritūn). The city also bore other names from at least the beginning of the 20th century: Berek Marsa, Port Mhaddra (Mithr), and Port Bardiah.\nDuring World War II, the British Army's Baggush Box was located to the east of the city. Starting with the completion of an extension from the previous railhead at Fuka in February 1936, Mersa Matruh was the terminus for a single-track railway, which passed through El Alamein. Mersa Matruh served as a vital British military base during World War II and was a major objective of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, which captured it during the Battle of Mersa Matruh.\nDuring the Arab Spring in early 2011, protests broke out in the city. On the evening of 2 October 2023, during the lead up to the 2023 Egyptian presidential election, a Nation's Future Party (Mostakbal El-Watan) rally in support of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi turned into Anti-Sisi protests with protesters burning photos of El-Sisi and chanting chants against him.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nMersa Matruh has a dry-summer hot desert climate (BWhs) according to Köppen climate classification, but winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea greatly moderate the temperature, making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters are mild and moderately wet.

Situated on the west bank of the Suez Canal, it is the capital of the Ismailia Governorate. The city had an estimated population of 450,388 in 2023. It is located approximately halfway between Port Said to the north and Suez to the south. The Canal widens at that point to include Lake Timsah, one of the Bitter Lakes linked by the Canal.\n\nHistory\nIsmailia was founded in 1863, during the construction of the Suez Canal, by Khedive Ismail, after whom the city is named. Following the Battle of Kafr-el-Dawwar in 1882 the British established a base there.\nThe head office of the Suez Canal Authority is located in Ismailia at the shore of Lake Timsah. It has a large number of buildings dating from British and French involvement with the Canal. Most of these buildings are currently used by Canal employees and officials.\nDuring World War I the British had an air base there and the Battle of Romani took place nearby. Ismailia War Cemetery was designed in 1919 by Sir Robert Lorimer marking the casualties of the battle.\nIn 1973 the Battle of Ismailia took place in the city.\nIn October 2023, a massive fire broke out in the security directorate of the city, leaving the building fully burned with 38 injured and 1 dead.\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Ismailia by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928. An underground paramilitary wing was established in the 1940s, primarily to contest the British occupation of Egypt. In the early 1950s, Ismailia hosted the British Military HQ and the Civilian Administration Centre of the Canal Zone. An attack on an Egyptian government building and army barracks manned by auxiliary policemen by a British Army force on 25 January 1952 was a key event leading to the overthrow of King Farouk I later that year and the Egyptian Revolution that followed. British forces pulled out of Ismailia in 1954.\n\nEparchy\nOn 17 December 1982 an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Ismayliah was established on territory split off from the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria (Alexandrian Rite in Coptic language), which remains its Metropolitan. Its episcopal see is St. Mark's cathedral.\n\nSuffragan Eparchs (Bishops of Ismayliah)\nAthanasios Abadir (17 December 1982 – 25 December 1992, his death), previously Titular Bishop of Appia and Patriarchal Vicar of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (18 May 1976 – 17 December 1982)\nYouhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (23 November 1992 – 23 June 1994), later Eparch (Bishop) of Luqsor of the Copts (Egypt) (23 June 1994 – 27 December 2015, his death)\nMakarios Tewfik (23 June 1994 – 29 June 2019, resigned)\nDaniel Lotfy Khella (29 June 2019 –  23 September 2022) (Patriarchal administrator 23 September 2022  – 31 March 2023)\nPola Ayoub Matta Usama Shafik Akhnoukh (31 March 2023 – Present)\n\nEducation\nIsmailia has several public and private schools. Ismailia is the home of the Suez Canal University, established in 1976 with the help of the Chinese Government to serve the region of Suez Canal and Sinai. Suez Canal University now is one of the fastest growing educational institutions in Egypt with many students studying abroad.\n\nCulture and recreation\nArts and festivals\nIsmailia hosts two important festivals each year. The first is the International Film Festival for Documentaries and Shorts that is held in June. In June 2014, the 17th consecutive festival was organized. The second is the Ismailia International Folklore Arts Festival that is held in September. In this festival folkloric troupes from all around the globe meet in Ismailia, where they perform folkloric dances representing the culture of their countries.\n\nTourism\nIsmailia does get tourists from within Egypt, but is not a major tourism destination for international tourists. The city is approximately a ninety-minute automobile drive from Cairo. From Ismailia it is approximately a four-hour drive to Sharm el-Sheikh in South Sinai. Driving to the Taba Border Crossing at Taba and the Rafah Border Crossing at Rafah are both approximately four-hour drives. A major attraction is the Ismailia Museum which was built in 1932. Visitors will find a variety of significant archaeological finds especially from sites in the Ismailia governorate such as Tell el-Maskhuta, from North Sinai, and from Upper Egypt.\n\nSports\nIsmailia is home to the third most successful club in Egypt (in the field of Football, Ismaily SC. The club's performance is considered a major political issue, and can tend to dictate the city's mood. The team enjoys brief stints of competition for local and international competition, but its financial situation prevents these stints from extending beyond a few years. The team has won the Egyptian League three times (1967, 1991, 2002), the Egyptian Cup twice (1997, 2000), and the African Cup of Champions Clubs once in 1969 as the first Egyptian and Arab Club team to have won this league.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\nThe hottest recorded temperature was 47 °C (117 °F) on 14 June 1944 while the coldest recorded temperature was 0.2 °C (32.4 °F) in January.\n\nNotable people\nHassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, worked as a teacher in Ismailia\nLouis Chedid, French singer and songwriter, son of writer Andrée Chedid and father of Matthieu Chedid was born in Ismailia on 1 January 1948\nClaude François, French pop singer and songwriter, born in Ismailia on 1 February 1939\nAli Gabr, footballer\nRagaa Al Geddawy (1934–2020), film actress, model and niece of Taheyya Kariokka\nAhmed Hegazy, footballer\nAura Herzog, First Lady of Israel, wife of former Israeli President Chaim Herzog and mother of current Israeli President Isaac Herzog born in Ismailia on 24 December 1924.\nTaheyya Kariokka, Egyptian belly dancer and film actress, born in Ismailia on 22 February 1919\nYasmine Khlat, Lebanese actress\nFernand Legros (1931-1983), Art dealer\nOsman Ahmed Osman, influential Egyptian engineer, contractor, entrepreneur, and politician, born in Ismailia on 6 April 1917\nMohamed Diab, Egyptian director\nOmar Moawad, footballer\n\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\n\nReferences\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al Ismailiyah, Egypt\".

La plupart de ces constructions sont maintenant habitées par les employés égyptiens travaillant pour le canal.\nAvant le percement du canal, Ismaïlia n'était qu'un simple village de pêcheurs au bord du lac Timsah.\n\nClimat\nÉconomie\nSituée à 90 minutes de voiture du Caire et à quatre heures de Charm el-Cheikh dans le Sud du Sinaï, Ismaïlia est une ville touristique pour les Égyptiens mais elle est assez peu visitée par les touristes étrangers. Environ quatre heures de route sont nécessaires pour se rendre à la frontière israélienne à Taba et la frontière palestinienne de la bande de Gaza à Rafah.\nIsmaïlia est le centre administratif du canal de Suez et le siège de la Suez Canal Authority.\n\nÉducation\nIsmaïlia est le siège de l'université du canal de Suez fondée en 1976 pour desservir les populations du canal et du Sinaï.

          "content": "The Siwa Oasis (Arabic: واحة سيوة Wāḥat Sīwah [ˈwæːħet ˈsiːwæ]) is an urban oasis in Egypt. It is situated between the Qattara Depression and the Great Sand Sea in the Western Desert, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of the Egypt–Libya border and 560 kilometres (350 mi) from the Egyptian capital city of Cairo. It is famed from its role in ancient Egypt as the home to an oracle of Amun, the ruins of which are a popular tourist attraction, giving it the ancient name Oasis of Amun-Ra, after the major Egyptian deity.\n\nGeography\nThe oasis is in a deep depression that reaches −19 metres (−62 ft) below sea level. To the west, the al Jaghbub Oasis rests in a similar depression and to the east, the large Qattara Depression is also below sea level. The depression is fertile due to both natural flowing artesian wells and irrigation. It is the site of about 200 natural springs. Siwa is directly adjacent to the Libyan Desert plateau. The geology is characterised by horizontal layers of porous limestones alternated with marls and clays dating back to the Miocene. The limestone plateau and inselbergs resulting from the oasis' erosion along the dunes create reliefs that the Isiwan describe as mountains (adrar in Tamizight). Two large salt lakes are fed by drainage water of agricultural origin. The oasis supports the cultivation of thousands of date palms and olives. Siwa has a temperate desert climate.\n\nName\nThe Ancient Egyptian name of the oasis was sḫt jꜣmw, meaning \"Field of Trees\". The native Libyan toponym may be preserved in the Egyptian t̠ꜣ(j) n d̠rw \"tꜣj on the fringe\" where t̠ꜣ transcribed the local Palaeo-Berber name *Se or *Sa. This name survived in the works of Muslim geographers as سنترية Santariyyah. \nSiwah is the Arabic name of the oasis called Sali in Berber. The oasis is also called Isiwan in modern Berber. \nThe etymology of the word سيوة Siwah is unclear. Champollion derives it from Coptic ⲥⲟⲟⲩϩ (soouh) – a corruption of Egyptian word for \"oasis\", ⲟⲩⲁϩ (ouoh). The additional evidence of the Egyptian source of Siwa's name is another place name in Kharga Oasis that may share the same etymology – S.t-wȝḥ, modern Deir el-Hagar). Basset links it to a Berber tribal name swh attested further west in the early Islamic period, while Ilahiane, following Chafik, links it to the Shilha Berber word asiwan, a type of bird of prey, and hence to Amun-Ra, one of whose symbols was the falcon. Some classical authors referred to the site as \"Ammonium\".\n\nHistory\nAlthough the site is known to have been settled since at least the 10th millennium BCE, the earliest evidence of any connection with Ancient Egypt is the 26th Dynasty, when a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BCE), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: Zeus Ammon), who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. Herodotus knew of a \"fountain of the Sun\" that ran coldest in the noontime heat. During his campaign to conquer the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert. The oracle, Alexander's court historians alleged, confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt, though Alexander's motives in making the excursion, following his founding of Alexandria, remain to some extent inscrutable and contested. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its Ancient Egyptian name was sḫ.t-ỉm3w, meaning \"Field of Trees\".\nIn the 12th century, Al-Idrisi mentions it as being inhabited mainly by Berbers, with an Arab minority; a century before Al-Bakri stated that only Berbers lived there. The Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi traveled to Siwa in the 15th century and described how the language spoken there 'is similar to the language of the Zenata'.\nThe first European to document a visit since Roman times was the English traveler William George Browne, who came in 1792 to see the ancient temple of the Oracle of Amun. Bompiani, in her description of the 19th-century explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti, called this site the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon.\nSiwa was annexed by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1820, but the Egyptian representative in Siwa was assassinated in 1838. At some point, Muhammad al-Sanusi stayed at Siwa for a few months and gathered some followers there. Later, Siwa was a base of the Sanusiyya in their fight against the British from 1915 to 1917. Meanwhile, in the spring of 1893, German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt took photographs of the architecture of the town of Siwa, now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.\nEgyptian rule from distant Cairo was at first tenuous and marked by several revolts. Egypt began to assert firmer control after a 1928 visit to the oasis by King Fuad I, who berated the locals for homosexual practices and specified punishments to bring Siwan behaviour in line with Egyptian morals.\nSiwa was also the site of some fighting during World War I and World War II. The British Army's Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was based here, but Rommel's Afrika Korps also took possession three times. German soldiers went skinny dipping in the lake of the oracle, contrary to local customs which prohibit public nudity. In 1942, while the Italian 136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti occupied the oasis, a tiny Egyptian puppet government-in-exile was set up at Siwa. The oasis makes a brief appearance as a base of the LRDG in the 1958 war film Ice Cold in Alex.\nThe ancient fortress of Siwa, known as the Shali Ghadi (Shali being the name of the town, and Ghadi meaning \"remote\"), was built on natural rock (an inselberg) and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926 it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it, and in some cases those, in turn, have been replaced by more modern cinder block and sheet metal roof buildings. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights. It is most easily approached from its southwest side, south of the end of the paved road which curves around from the north side of the Shali. Several uneven pedestrian streets lead from the southwest end of the Shali into it, and the ground is rent in places by deep cracks. Many of the unreinforced kershif buildings bordering the streets of the Shali are also split by large cracks, or they are partially collapsed.\nOther local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs; and \"Cleopatra's Bath\", an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BCE, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi. The revelations of the oracle fell into disrepute under the Roman occupation of Egypt.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.\n\nCulture\nThe traditional culture of Siwa shows many unique elements, some reflecting its longstanding links with the isolated oasis life and the fact that the inhabitants are Siwi Berbers. There are 10 tribes in Siwa that speak an eastern Berber language (Siwi). These tribes have their own cultures and ideals. Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa's only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca.\n\nAs a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies. These pieces were decorated with symbols which related to Siwa's history and beliefs and attitudes.\nThe best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called 'adrim' and a round necklace, called 'aghraw', from which it hung over the breast. A girl would give up the disc at a special ceremony in the spring the day she was married. The jewelry, which was made by local silversmiths, consisted of silver necklaces, earrings, bangles, hair ornaments, pendants, and many rings. For a wealthy woman, the full ensemble could weigh as much as five or six kilos. These pieces are decorated with symbols common to Berber people across North Africa designed to promote good health, fertility and to protect the wearer from misfortune. Some of the same signs and patterns are found on the embroidery which embellishes women's dresses, trousers, and shawls.\n\nArt and local customs\nThe arrival of the road and of television exposed the oasis to the styles and fashions of the outside world and the traditional silver ornaments were gradually replaced by jewelry made of gold. Evidence of the old styles and traditions are however still in evidence in the women's embroidery and costume. The material for the \"tarfutet\", the distinctive all-enveloping shawl worn by women, are brought from outside the oasis, specifically from the town of Kirdasa, in the Giza Governorate.\n\nFestivals\nSiwi people are very religious so on Ramadan, they tend to close all the shops and stay at home for the whole month. Like other Muslim Egyptians, Siwis celebrate Eid al-Fitr (lʕid ahakkik,\"the Little Eid\") and Eid al-Adha (lʕid azuwwar,\"the Big Eid\"). Unlike other Egyptians, however, on Eid al-Adha Siwis cook the skin of the sheep (along with its innards) as a festival delicacy, after removing the hair. They also eat heart of palm (agroz).\nThe Siyaha Festival (Eid El Solh–Eid El Hasad), in honour of the town's traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa (the name is often misunderstood as a reference to \"tourism\", but in fact predates tourism). It is known that on this occasion Siwi men meet on a mountain near the town, Gabal Al–Dakrour, to eat together, sing chants while thanking God, and reconcile with one another; all Siwi houses co-operate in preparing and cooking food, in this day Siwian people eat fattah (rice, toasted bread and meat), after Dohr prayer (12:00 PM) all Siwian youth gather to set the banquet, nobody is allowed to eat before the caller announces to start eating so they can all eat together, the women stay behind in the village, and celebrate with dancing, singing, and drums. The food for the festival is bought collectively, with funds gathered by the oasis' mosques, celebrations last for 3 Qamari days, and in the early morning of the fourth day, siwian men form a big march, while holding flags and singing spiritual songs. The march starts from Gabal El – Dakrour and ends in Sidi Solayman square – in the center of Siwa – declaring ending of festivals, and beginning of a new year without hatred or grudge, and with love, respect and reconciliation.\nSiwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults' celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.\n\nRelations with the Bedouins\nSiwans are preferentially endogamous, only rarely marrying non-Siwans. Nonetheless, Bedouin brides command a higher brideprice in Siwa than Siwan ones.\nAccording to older members of the Awlad Ali Bedouins, the Bedouin relations with Siwans were traditionally mediated through a system of \"friendship\", whereby a specific Siwan (and his descendants) would be the friend of a specific Bedouin (and his descendants). The Bedouin would stay at the Siwan's house when he came to Siwa, and would exchange his animal products and grain for the Siwan's dates and olive oil.\nSiwa's Berbers are close to 30,000 in number.\nThe hot springs are an attraction to visitors.\n\nRole of women\nWomen have traditionally played a prominent role in Siwan households, often being in charge of a household's financial decisions. They have also been responsible for raising children; the town's deputy mayor said in 1985, \"If our children speak Siwi, it to our womenfolk that they owe it.\"\n\nSiwan pederastic tradition\nSiwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of intergenerational male homosexuality and rituals celebrating same-sex marriage – traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century.\nThe German Egyptologist Georg Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that pederastic relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage: \"The feast of marrying a boy was celebrated with great pomp, and the money paid for a boy sometimes amounted to fifteen pounds, while the money paid for a woman was a little over one pound.\" Mahmud Mohammad Abd Allah, writing of Siwan customs for the Harvard Peabody Museum in 1917, commented that although Siwan men could take up to four wives, \"Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.\"\nIn 1937, the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: \"All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy...among themselves the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition....Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks' sons....Most of the boys used in sodomy are between 12 and 18 years of age.\" After an expedition to Siwa, the archaeologist Count Byron de Prorok reported in 1937 \"an enthusiasm [that] could not have been approached even in Sodom... Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging...Every dancer had his boyfriend...[and] chiefs had harems of boys\".\nIn the late 1940s, a Siwan merchant told the visiting British novelist Robin Maugham that the Siwan women were \"badly neglected\", but that Siwan men \"will kill each other for boy. Never for a woman\", although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who studied Siwa for three decades, observed in 1973 that \"While the Siwans were still living inside their walled town, none of these bachelors was allowed to spend the night in the town and had to sleep outside the gates...Under such circumstances it is not surprising that homosexuality was common among them....Up to the year 1928, it was not unusual that some kind of written agreement, which was sometimes called a marriage contract, was made between two males; but since the visit of King Fu'ad to this oasis it has been completely forbidden...However, such agreements continued, but in great secrecy, and without the actual writing, until the end of World War II. Now the practice is not followed.\"\nDespite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. When the Siwa-born anthropologist Fathi Malim included reference to Siwan homosexuality (especially a love poem from a man to a youth) in his book Oasis Siwa (2001), the tribal council demanded that he blank out the material in the current edition of the book and remove it from future editions, or be expelled from the community. Malim reluctantly agreed and physically deleted the passages in the first edition of his book, and excluded them from the second. A newer book, Siwa Past and Present (2005) by A. Dumairy, the Director of Siwa Antiquities, omits all mention of the famous historical practices of the inhabitants.\n\nPeople\nAbout 80 km (50 mi) in length and 20 km (12 mi) wide, Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt's most isolated settlements, with about 25,000 people, mostly Siwi Berbers (Siwi: Isiwan. The municipality hosts the easternmost Berber-speaking community, whose language, called Siwi (Jlan n Isiwan), shares many linguistic features with the languages of Sokna and El Foqaha in Libya, partially also with the Zenati group, and which has been heavily influenced by Arabic.\nWhile the majority of the population of Siwa is Berber, the oasis is also home to a Bedouin community related to the Awlad Ali, the Shahibaat, as well as to a growing number of other Egyptian settlers. Currently, the entire population of the oasis speaks Arabic as either a first or a second language. The Siwi Berber population is also fluent in Egyptian Arabic, which is called Masri \"Egyptian\".\n\nEconomy\nSiwa has been noted for its dates since ancient times, and today date palm cultivation is by far the largest component of its economy. In a distant second place, with about one-fifth of the scale as dates, is olive cultivation. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.\nTourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income. Much attention has been given to creating hotels that use local materials and display local styles.\n\nArchaeology\nIn the mid-20th century, Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry worked at Siwa (and elsewhere in the Western Desert).\nIn 1995, Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced that she had identified the tomb of Alexander the Great in the oasis of Siwa. She made the following statement to the Greek media:\n\nBut I am speaking to every Greek all over the world. I want every one of you to feel proud because Greek hands have found this very important monument.\n\nThis statement was an answer to the, at the time, Greek prime minister Costas Simitis who urged the archaeologists to stop their research in Egypt and sent a Greek Embassy advisor to ask the Egyptian government to withdraw Mrs Souvaltzi’s permission to excavate in the area. The case is still active in the Greek courts of law.\nAn extremely old hominid footprint was discovered in 2007 at Siwa Oasis. Egyptian scientists claimed it could be 2–3 million years old, which would make it the oldest fossilized hominid footprint ever found. However, no proof of this conjecture was ever presented.\nIn late 2013, an announcement was made regarding the apparent archaeoastronomy discovery of precise spring and fall equinox sunrise alignments over the Aghurmi mound/Amun Oracle when viewed from Timasirayn temple in the Western Desert, 12 km away across Lake Siwa. The first known recent public viewing of this event occurred on March 21, 2014, during the spring equinox.\n\nIn popular culture\nSiwa Oasis is an official map for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory which belongs to North Africa Campaign. The fifth mission from the game Sniper Elite III takes place on the Siwa Oasis. Siwa is prominently featured in the videogame Assassin's Creed: Origins and is the birthplace and home of the protagonist Bayek of Siwa. In British author Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, the ninth and eleventh instalments Scorpia Rising and Never Say Die feature Siwa. In Australian author Matthew Reilly's Jack West series of seven novels starting with Seven Ancient Wonders feature prominently the Oracle of Siwa.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBattesti, Vincent (2006).

          "content": "## Overview\nSiwa is an oasis and town in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is the most remote of Egypt's five western oases. The oasis is 80 km long by 20 km wide, with a population in 2016 of some 33,000. It has a scattering of villages but only one large settlement, here referred to as \"Siwa town\" for clarity. Its main sight is the Temple of the Oracle, which even Alexander the Great came to visit.\n\n## Understand\nSiwa is in a great depression in the Sahara, so although it is 300 km from the Mediterranean coast at Marsa Matruh, it lies at sea-level or even a few metres below. This brings it close to a great aquifer of sandstone and limestone, containing \"fossil water\" - rain that fell 40,000 years ago. All the oasis water comes from this non-renewable resource. The depression was scoured out by wind-blown sand and salt, and the water is only usable if it is not salty. Most of Siwa's water is salty and the town is surrounded by large bitter lakes, which support wildlife (eg migratory birds, which gorge on the insects and grubs) but not agriculture. Wells nowadays have to drill down 300 m to access fresh water, so the area remains fertile but its development is constrained - tourist hotels are notoriously profligate users of water. Siwa's aquifer continues across the border into Libya, where it emerges as the Jaghbub oasis. Some 200 km east of Siwa is the even larger and deeper depression of Qattara, where all the water is saline and useless, so it is not an oasis.\nThe inhabitants of Siwa are ethnically Berber and their mother tongue is a Berber language called Siwi. They also speak Egyptian Arabic, and many can speak a little English.\nLike the other western oases, the climate is hot desert, near 40°C summer and 5°C in winter. There is almost zero rainfall.\n\n## Get in\nThere are no flights to Siwa so the only approach is along two very long roads.\n\n## By road\n550 km west of Cairo (but 750 km by either road) or from Alexandria, the best approach is by the coast road to Marsa Matruh, then it is 300 km southwest across the desert to Siwa. This road is asphalt throughout—beware blowing sand. It is a long way with no filling stations though there is a café midway.\nThe other way is to Bahariyya oasis then west across the desert. This road is asphalt. From there a dirt track heads west to Siwa. It is being upgraded and buses previously ran this way, but in 2019 it was closed by the military.\nWest of Siwa is the border with Libya (50 km), which is closed throughout, and south are only the trackless sands of the desert.\n\n## By bus\n29.20525.5191 Siwa main bus stop. You would not call it a station. It is in the broad street outside the police station. Tickets go on sale about 1 hr before the bus departs. Taxis also gather in this area.    (updated Jun 2020)\nCairo – Nightly around 8PM from Cairo bus terminal West Delta Bus line and heading back at the same time. 12 hr. LE200 (Jan 2022). This bus can be cold and drafty in the winter.\nMarsa Matruh – At least daily from the coast. 4 hr. You might prefer to take a day-time bus through Marsa Matruh from Cairo.\nBahariyya – In 2019, there was no bus or taxi service, or least foreigners were not allowed along that road.\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi on the Marsa Matruh route might cost LE1,000.\n\n## By bicycle\nBicycles are the best way to explore Siwa and surroundings, and Chinese gear-less models can be rented for LE10 per day (LE5 half day). Before accepting a bike, however, check that it is sturdy, that the brakes are functioning well and that the handle bars are not cracked or bent. Driving on sand-covered streets can be quite a challenge for inexperienced cyclists.\n\n## By donkey cart\nDonkey cart drivers are mostly children who have been riding donkeys for several years. Prices for this mode of transport are negotiable - just make sure the price is clearly agreed before setting off - and run from around LE3 for a short trip within the downtown up to LE30 for longer journeys. To get a few people and their backpacks from the bus station to town center can be as cheap as LE1.50. An afternoon trip to Cleopatra's Well will probably cost about LE20-25.\n\n## See\nSiwa town\nKing Farooq Mosque\nTomb of Sidi Suleiman\n29.2037725.518011 The museum. Sa-Th.

Parts of the old town walls and gates survive, along with houses and a mosque from 19th C. Wander the tiny alleys, then you can climb the hill just west which has Graeco-Roman rock tombs. free.     (updated Jun 2020)\n29.20525.5443 Temple of the Oracle (Aghurmi) (Hill of Aghurmi 4 km east of town). The temple, built perhaps in 570 BCE, was dedicated to Amun, the same deity as Zeus or Jupiter / Jove. The priestly oracles pronounced on propositions put to them and in 331 BCE Alexander the Great came to ask if he was the son of Zeus. He sent everyone else out of the room before receiving the answer, and afterwards enough gold was distributed to ensure that the answer was yes as he had claimed. It is called \"leadership\", and thus he legitimised his rule in Egypt. He intended to be buried here but lies in Alexandria at an unknown site. The temple is undecorated except for the Hall of the Sacrament. It never had a tiled roof, but palm trunks were overlain. The area became built over and the temple was lost sight of until rediscovered in 1853. LE50 foreigner, LE25 adult, LE15 student.     (updated Jan 2021)\n29.20168125.5449194 Temple of Umm Ubeida (Umm Ubaydah/Temple of Amun) (400 m south of Temple of the Oracle). This temple was probably built by Nectanebo around 380 BCE. It too was dedicated to Amun, and in the 18—19th century became a decoy: explorers looking for the Temple of the Oracle thought this must be it. They made detailed sketches of its layout and decorations, fortunately, because in 1897 the Ottoman governor decided that the limestone masonry would be much better employed for a new police station, so he blew it up. Only one wall remains and various large fragments. The origin of the present temple name is uncertain, but \"baydah\" means white. free.  (updated Jan 2021)\n29.21125.5235 Gebel el-Mawta (Mountain of the Dead) (1 km north of town centre). Sa-Th 9AM-3PM, F 9AM-noon. Limestone hillock with many rock-cut tombs, mostly from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. The highlight is the group of four tombs on the northeast slope (no photography within). These are the Tomb of Si-Amun with beautifully colored reliefs; the Tomb of Mesu-Isis is little decorated but contains a mummified skull; the Tomb of Per-nj-pa-thot has inscriptions and drawings; and the Tomb of the Crocodile where the wall paintings are deteriorating, but the yellow crocodile is probably the deity Sobek. Adult LE50.     (updated May 2020)\n29.18925.5536 Gebel Darkur (4 km southeast of town). This is a limestone scarp west of town; you can climb it for the view. There are several rock tombs, but they're plain with no inscriptions or decorations. The thing to do here is to have yourself buried in hot sand for 20 minutes, it's supposed to be good for rheumatism. In October there's a village festival here, but it's a Siwa family reunion not a tourist event.     (updated May 2020)\n29.233625.43847 Ain Duheiba. A village 25 km west of Siwa with Graeco-Roman graves. They are undecorated.     (updated Jun 2020)\n29.228425.4078 Bilad er-Rum (30 km west of Siwa). Has extensive rocktombs and a ruined Doric Temple. This is sometimes claimed as Alexander the Great's burial site, which it is not.     (updated Jun 2020)\n29.23825.3259 Maraqi (30-35 km west of Siwa). A secondary oasis dotted with rock tombs and scraps of temple ruins, and there is a prehistoric human footprint. The area is fertile, though the lake it surrounds is very salty. Here you are close to the border, so the military may curb your explorations. The aquifer continues northwest under the border to re-emerge at El Jaghbub oasis in Libya.     (updated Jun 2020)\n29.122225.433910 Biʾr Wahid (Well No. 1) (15 km southwest of town). A lake and garden surrounded by sand dunes, almost a cartoon image of an oasis. A spring feeds a pool at 30°C and you can bathe here, though the minerals will stain your costume and towels; the nearby lake is cold.     (updated Jun 2020)\nThere are other wells and springs at Ain Qureishad, Abu Shuruf, Ez-Zeitun and Ain Safi. Abu el-Auwuf has a necropolis and chapels.\n\n## Do\n29.19698125.5500751 Cleopatra's Bath (Sun Pool/Pool of the Sun at Ammon) (900 m south of Temple of Umm Ubaydah). A natural hot spring feeds this rock pool at 29°C. It is a popular swimming hole for locals and visitors alike, with a cafe. The association with Cleopatra is entirely fanciful. Another spring feeds a smaller pool just north, called Ain Gubba.     (updated May 2020)\n29.19325.482 Fatnas Island (6 km west of town). This has become joined to shore as Lake Siwa silted up. Bathe in the hot smelly spring, have tea at the café, relax amidst the greenery and watch the sun set over the lake. It is usually idyllic but the bugs can be pesky.    (updated Jun 2020)\nExcursions – By 4x4 to the various outlying sights, either as day-trips or as overnight safaris.\nEquinox sunrise – Timasirayn temple is a ruin 12 km west of town, accessible by 4x4. On the morning of the equinox (Mar 21 and Sep 23, plus or minus a day in some years) the sunrise viewed from here is over the Temple of the Oracle, prominent on its hill. Tourist entrepreneurs and flaky archaeologists have tried to play this up—there is maybe a secret tunnel to Chichen Itza and Angkor Wat hereabouts—but its significance remains unclear. You cannot see much without powerful binoculars or zoom lenses, and even the ancient Egyptians knew it was unwise to look at the sun through those.\n\n## Buy\nPopular items are local crafts, jewelry, and baskets woven from date palms.\nOr splurge on your wedding dress—these have red, orange, green and black embroidery, embellished with shells and beads.\n\n## Eat\nSiwa Dates are the best in Egypt, and perhaps the whole world. Apart from regular dates, they are also sold stuffed with almonds and chocolate. Shops specialising in dates are found around Market Square, and prices range from LE7-8 for a 500-g box.\nAbdu's Restaurant (around the corner from the town center). 8:30AM to midnight. Small, popular place. Offers a breakfast and a variety of entrées such as pasta, vegetable stews, couscous, meats, and salads—all freshly made, so be prepared to wait. LE6-25 per entrée.\nEast-West (on the road leading from the town center to the bus station). Fresh fish, pigeon, and pizzas. LE3-15.\nDunes Restaurant (Sharia Torrar).

You can have a drink on the roof.\n\n## Drink\nSiwan Tea – This is a red tea that is commonly found on desert safaris and is available in most restaurants. 500 g boxes of red (or green) tea leaves are sold in date/olive shop and cost about LE15.\n\n## Budget\n29.19844825.5205371 Cleopatra Hotel (Just south of town center, near the Military Intelligence). Probably the best value in Siwa. Staff will only clean rooms when requested to do so. Single LE14 w/o bath, LE18 w/bath; Double LE25 w/o bath, LE30 w/bath; Triple LE38 w/o bath, LE42 w/bath.\nPalm Trees Hotel (Sharia torrar, Town centre, in the market). Bed bugs have been reported.

          "content": "Bahariya Oasis (Arabic: الواحات البحرية, romanized: El-Wāḥāt El-Baḥrīya, \"the Northern Oases\") is a depression and a naturally rich oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is approximately 370 km away from Cairo. The roughly oval valley extends from northeast to southwest, has a length of 94 km, a maximum width of 42 km and covers an area of about 2000 km2.\nThe valley is surrounded by mountains and has numerous springs. Located in Giza Governorate, the main economic sectors are agriculture, iron ore mining, and tourism. The main agricultural products are guavas, mangos, dates, and olives.\n\nNames\nIn Ancient Egypt, the oasis had two names. The name 'ḏsḏs' (Djesdjes) is first mentioned on a scarab dating back to the Middle Kingdom. In the New Kingdom, this name is rarely found, although it does appear for example in the Temple of Luxor and in the account of King Kamose, who occupied the oasis during the war against the Hyksos. From the 25th Dynasty it was almost the only name used. Another name wḥꜣt mḥtt (\"the Northern Oasis\") was almost exclusively used in the New Kingdom; it appears for instance on the local grave of Amenhotep, and is found again in the list of oasis in the Temple at Edfu.\nFrom 45 CE, the depression was known in Latin as Oasis parva (Small Oasis). The Greek historian Strabo called it the \"Second Oasis\", and the 5th century CE historian Olympiodorus of Thebes called it \"the Third Oasis\".\nIn Coptic times, it was known as the \"Oasis of Oxyrhynchus\" (Coptic: ϯⲟⲩⲁϩ `ⲙⲡⲉⲙϫⲉ Diwah Ēmbemdje) or Tast(s) (Coptic: ⲧⲁⲥⲧ(ⲥ)), which is derived from Ancient Egyptian ḏsḏs. After the Islamization of Egypt, it was called the Oasis of Bahnasa, \"Oasis of Oxyrhynchus\".\nThe modern name is الواحات البحرية, al-Wāḥāt al-Baḥriyya meaning \"the Northern Oases\". The southern part of the depression around El Heiz apparently never had a separate name.\n\nTowns\nBahariya consists of many villages, of which El Bawiti is the largest and the administrative center. Qasr is el-Bawiti's neighboring/twin village. To the east, about ten kilometers away are the villages of Mandishah and el-Zabu. A smaller village called el-'Aguz lies between El Bawiti and Mandishah. Harrah, the easternmost village, is a few kilometers east of Mandishah and el-Zabu. El Heiz, also called El-Hayez, is the southernmost village, but it may not always be considered as part of Bahariya because it is so far from the rest of the villages, about fifty kilometers south of El Bawiti. There is an oasis at El-Hayez where mummies have been found on which genetic studies have been conducted.\n\nHistory\nThe depression has been populated since the Neolithic, although archaeological evidence is not continuous. In El Heiz, a prehistoric settlement site of hunter-gatherers was found with remains of grindstones, arrowheads, scrapers, chisels, and ostrich eggshells. In Qārat el-Abyaḍ, a Czech team led by Miroslav Bárta discovered a settlement of the Old Kingdom. Rock inscriptions in el-Harrah and other records date to the Middle Kingdom and upwards. The tomb of Amenhotep called Huy was erected in Qarat Hilwah at the end of the 18th dynasty. In the 26th dynasty, the depression was culturally and economically flourishing. This can be learned from the chapels in 'Ain el-Muftilla, the tombs in Qārat Qasr Salim and Qarat esh-Sheikh Subi, and the site of Qasr 'Allam.\nThe Greco-Roman period was a time of prosperity. There is the ruin of a temple dedicated to Ammon by Alexander the Great located in Qasr el-Miqisba ('Ain et-Tibniya). It is believed by some Egyptologists that Alexander passed through Bahariya while returning from the oracle of Ammon at Siwa Oasis. Excavations of the Greco-Roman necropolis found in 1995 and known as the Valley of the Golden Mummies began in 1999. Approximately thirty-four tombs have been excavated from this area. In Roman times, a big military fort was erected at Qarat el-Toub.\nIn the spring of 2010, a Roman-era mummy was unearthed in a Bahariya Oasis cemetery in el-Harrah. The female mummy was 3 feet tall and covered with plaster decorated to resemble Roman dress and jewellery. In addition to the female mummy, archaeologists found clay and glass vessels, coins, anthropoid masks and fourteen Greco-Roman tombs. Director of Cairo and Giza Antiquities Mahmoud Affifi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said the tomb has a unique design with stairways and corridors, and could date to 300 BC. This find came as a result of excavation work for the construction of a youth center.\nIn 2019, archaeologists discovered 19 structures and a church carved into the bedrock from the fifth century CE. The church was decorated with religious inscriptions in Greek. In 2021, archaeologists discovered a complex with the ruins of three churches and monks cells date back to the fifth century CE.\nDuring World War I, the Baharia Military Railway was built to provide access to the oasis. In the early 1970s, an asphalt road connecting Bahariya to Cairo was finished. With the new road came electricity, cars, television, phone lines, a more accessible route to Cairo, and, more recently, internet. The spread of people and ideas between Bahariya and Cairo has increased dramatically since the road was constructed. Also, the language of the Waḥātī people has changed under the influence of the Cairo dialect, as heard on television and in music.\n\nPeople and culture\nThe people of the oasis, or the Waḥātī people (meaning \"of the oasis\" in Arabic), are the descendants of the ancient people who inhabited the oasis, ancient tribes with connection to western Egypt and eastern Libya, and the north coast, and other people from the Nile Valley who came to settle in the oasis.\nThe majority of Waḥātī people in Bahariya are Muslims. There are some mosques in Bahariya. The nature of social settings in the oasis is highly influenced by Islam.\nTraditional music is very important to the Waḥātī people. Flutes, drums, and the simsimeyya (a harp-like instrument) are played at social gatherings, particularly at weddings. Traditional songs sung in rural style are passed down from generation to generation, and new songs are invented as well. Music from Cairo, the greater Middle East, and other parts of the world are now easily accessible to the people of the oasis.\nBahariya used to be a major center for Coptic Christians. However, most of the Oasis population converted to Islam centuries ago. Copts that live in Bahariya today are largely new transplants from the Nile Valley.\nThe traditional dress of women in Bahariya is called Magaddil (braids) after the striped pattern of the embroidery. There was also a dress that was lightly embroidered, with a border of telli embroidery around the neck that was made separately and sewn onto the dress. In recent times these have largely been phased out by floral print dresses.\n\nEconomy\nAgriculture is still an important source of income, though now the iron ore industry close to Bahariya provides jobs for many Wahati people. Recently there has also been an increase in tourism to the oasis because of antiquities (tombs, mummies and other artifacts have been discovered there), and because of the beautiful surrounding deserts. Wahati and foreign guides lead adventure desert tours based out of Bahariya to the surrounding White and Black deserts, and sometimes to Siwa or the southern oases. Tourism is a new and important source of income for locals, and it has brought an international presence to the oasis.\n\nFossils\nTameryraptor and Bahariasaurus (meaning \"Bahariya lizard\") as well as the holotype specimen of the famous Spinosaurus are dinosaurs which have been found in the Bahariya Formation, which date to about 95 million years ago. Bahariasaurus was a huge theropod and was described by Ernst Stromer in 1934, however the type specimen was destroyed during World War II in 1944. In 2000, an American scientific team conducted by Joshua Smith found the remains of sauropod dinosaur, Paralititan stromeri.\nThe region between the Bahariya and Farafra depressions used to have volcanic activity during the Jurassic Period. In addition, the landscape contains some hills made of barite or calcite crystals, and also golden limestone boulders which became a sanctuary for species, such as white foxes, gazelles and rams.\nIn June 2022, paleontologists reported the discovery of a 98-million-year-old type of abelisaurid in Bahariya Oasis, which was around 20 feet (6.1 m) in length and initially found in 2016.\n\nClimate\nNotes\nSee also\nBahariasaurus (meaning \"Bahariya lizard\")\nBahariya Formation (fossil bearing geologic formation)\nErnst Stromer\n\nReferences\nFakhry, Ahmed.

It is in the large Western Desert of Egypt, approximately midway between Dakhla and Bahariya oases.\nFarafra has an estimated 5,000 inhabitants (2002) mainly living in the town of Farafra and is mostly inhabited by the local Bedouins. Parts of the town have complete quarters of traditional architecture, simple, smooth, unadorned, all in mud colour—local culture and traditional methods of building and carrying out repairs have been supported by its tourism.  Often grouped within Farafra are the hot springs at Bir Sitta (the sixth well) and the El-Mufid lake.\n\nEtymology\nThe word al-Farafra (al-Farafira in local pronunciation, Arabic: الفرفرون al-Farfarun in Middle Ages) is a broken plural form of Arabic: فرفر farfar meaning \"fizzy spring\". The oasis was called in Ancient Egyptian: tꜣ jḥw, \"the land of cattle\".\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Farafra region was inhabited since late Pleistocene. Farafra was known in ancient Egyptian history at least since the Middle Kingdom. In the Ptolemaic period, the region was under the administration of the Oxyrhynchite nome (19th Upper Egyptian nome).\n\nWhite Desert\nA main geographic attraction of Farafra is its White Desert (known as Sahara el Beyda)—a national park of Egypt and 45 km (28 mi) north of the town of Farafra, the main draw of which is its rock type colored from snow-white to cream. It has massive chalk rock formations that are textbook examples of ventifact and which have been created as a result of occasional sandstorm in the area. The White Desert is a typical place visited by some schools in Egypt, as a location for camping trips.\n\nWells\nThe Roman spring of Ain Bishay bubbles forth from a hillock on the northwest edge of town. It has been developed into an irrigated grove of date palms together with citrus, olive, apricot and carob trees, and is a cool haven amid the arid landscape. Several families tend the crops here; you should seek someone out and ask permission before wandering around.\nDue to its geographical location and geological formation it has more than 100 wells spread out over the lands of the Farafra, many of which are natural. Most of these wells are used in aggregation of the cultivated land in the oasis. Some of the wells in Farafra have become a favorite tourist destination. Bir Sitta, (well 6 in Arabic), Bir Sab'a (well 7) and Bir Ithnian wa ishrin (well 22) are the most important. Because of the water's warm temperature and a slight percentage of sulfur, these wells are favorable for swimming and relaxation. There is a large lake touristic well named Abu Nus 15 kilometers north of the edge of the Farafra.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\n\nGallery\nReferences\nBibliography\nBeadnell, Hugh J.

          "content": "Dakhla Oasis or Dakhleh Oasis (Egyptian Arabic: الواحات الداخلة‎ El Waḥat el Daḵla, pronounced [elwæ'ħæ:t edˈdæ:xlæ], \"the inner oases\"), is one of the seven oases of Egypt's Western Desert. Dakhla Oasis lies in the New Valley Governorate, 350 km (220 mi.) from the Nile and between the oases of Farafra and Kharga. It measures approximately 80 km (50 mi) from east to west and 25 km (16 mi) from north to south.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe first contacts between the pharaonic power and the oases started around 2550 BCE.\nThe human history of this oasis started during the Pleistocene, when nomadic tribes settled sometimes there, in a time when the Sahara climate was wetter and where humans could have access to lakes and marshes. But about 6,000 years ago, the entire Sahara became drier, changing progressively into a hyper-arid desert (with less than 50 mm of rain per year). However, specialists think that nomadic hunter-gatherers began to settle almost permanently in the oasis of Dakhleh in the period of the Holocene (about 12,000 years ago), during new, but rare episodes of wetter times.\nIn fact, the drier climate didn't mean that there was more water than today in what is now known as the Western Desert. The south of the Libyan Desert has the most important supply of subterranean water in the world through the Nubian Aquifer, and the first inhabitants of the Dakhla Oasis had access to surface water sources. In the third millennium BC the probably nomadic people of the Sheikh Muftah culture lived here.\n\nPharaonic period\nDuring the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic script was sometimes incised into clay tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred such tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat) in the Dakhla Oasis. At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production. These tablets record inventories, name-lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters.\n\nDeir el-Hagar\nDeir el-Hagar (Egyptian Arabic: دير الحجر‎ 'Monastery of Stone', Ancient Egyptian: S.t-wȝḥ, Sioua) is a Roman sandstone temple on the western edge of Dakhla Oasis, about 10 km from Qasr ad-Dakhla. The Temple was erected during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero, and decorated during the time of Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. The temple was dedicated to the Theban triad, composed of Amun-Ra, Mut and Khonsu, as well as to Seth, the main deity of the region.\n\nQasr ad-Dakhla\nThe fortified Islamic town of Qasr ad-Dakhla or el-Qasr (Arabic: قصر الداخلة, the Fortress) was built in the 12th century on the remains of a Roman fort in the NW of the Dakhla Oasis by the Ayyubid kings. Many of the up to four-storey mud brick Ottoman and Mamluk buildings contain blocks of stone with hieroglyphics from the ancient Thoth temple of the nearby site of Amheida. The three-storey, 21-meter-high minaret is dated 924 CE.\n\nAfter 1800\nSir Archibald Edmonstone visited Dakhla oasis in the year 1819. He was succeeded by several other early travellers, among whom Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs in 1873–1874. It was not until 1908 that the first Egyptologist, Herbert Winlock, visited Dakhla Oasis and noted its monuments in some systematic manner. In the 1950s, detailed studies began, first by Ahmed Fakhry, and in the late 1970s, expeditions of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale and the Dakhleh Oasis Project (see below) each began detailed studies in the oasis.\n\nRecent discoveries\nIn August 2017, archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of five mud-brick tombs at Bir esh-Shaghala, dating back nearly 2000 years. Researchers also revealed worn masks gilded with gold, several large jars and a piece of pottery with unsolved ancient Egyptian writing on it.\nSome of the tombs are completely large containing several burial chambers, while one tomb has a roof built in the shape of a pyramid and some of them with vaulted roofs.\n\nGeography\nDakhla Oasis consists of several communities, along a string of sub-oases. The main settlements are Mut (more fully Mut el-Kharab and anciently called Mothis), El-Masara, Al-Qasr, together with several smaller villages.\n\nClimate\nDakhla Oasis has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), typical of much of Egypt.\n\nDakhleh Oasis Project\nThe Dakhleh Oasis Project (DOP) is a long-term study project of the Dakhleh Oasis and the surrounding palaeo-oasis, initiated in 1978 when the Royal Ontario Museum and the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities were awarded a joint concession for part of the Oasis. In 1979, the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History at Monash University began to cooperate in the project.\nThe DOP studies the interaction between environmental changes and human activity in the Dakhleh Oasis. The excavations at Ismant el-Kharab (ancient Kellis), Mut el-Kharab (ancient Mothis), Deir Abu Metta and Muzawwaqa were undertaken with the cooperation of Monash University. The DOP has also excavated at 'Ain el-Gazzareen, El Qasr el-Dakhil, Deir el Hagar and Ain Birbiyeh.\nIn 1985, the Petroglyph Unit of the Dakhleh Oasis Project was created by Lech Krzyżaniak, then director of the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. At first, the studies of the petroglyphs focused on the eastern part of the oasis, where rock carvings had been documented by archaeologists already before World War II (Herbert Winlock and Hans Alexander Winkler). The expedition created systematic documentation of both the depictions mentioned earlier in the literature and the newly discovered ones. Aerial photographs proved helpful in this work. Then, under the direction of Michał Kobusiewicz from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, attention was turned to the area of the Central Oasis where 270 new petroglyph sites were recorded. The current director of The Petroglyph Unit, Paweł Polkowski from the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, extended the area of prospection and created a map showing the distribution of more than 1,300 panels with rock art. The depictions date from the Prehistory to the Islamic period and include images of animals and people (often pregnant women), hieroglyphs, and Beduin markings.\nIn addition to the Dakhleh Oasis Project, long-term excavations have been conducted in Balat (IFAO), Amheida (New York University) and Bir el-Shaghala (Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities).\n\nDakhleh Trust\nThe Dakhleh Trust was formed in 1999 and is a registered charity in Britain. Its declared aim is to advance understanding of the history of the environment and cultural evolution throughout the Quaternary period in the eastern Sahara, and particularly in the Dakhla Oasis. To this end, the present trustees have committed themselves to supporting the DOP.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPublished works\nBoozer, A. \"Archaeology on Egypt's Edge: Archaeological Research in the Dakhleh Oasis, 1819-1977\" in Ancient West & East: 12: 117–156. 2013.\nFakhry, A.

Five km further on is the Roman graveyard of Beit el Ara'is, which you can't enter, but can view from besides the watchman's hut.\n25.55027828.9080565 El Qalamun – 4 km from Ed Duhus, an interesting old village but sadly tumbledown. The old mosque is 12th C.\n25.526929.06786 Ismant – 11 km east of Mut is mostly modern, and the old village is a sorry ruin.\n25.69586928.88377 Qasr el-Dakhla (or el-Qasr) – Another attractive traditional village with well-preserved old buildings.\n25.51286129.3399698 Tineida – 43 km from Mut, a large village with a ramshackle old quarter, still inhabited. There is a small museum, and southside an old graveyard.\n\n## Understand\nLike the other western oases, the climate is hot desert, 40°C and above summer and 5–10°C in winter. There is zero rainfall and all the oasis supply is \"fossil water\" extracted from the aquifer, a non-renewable resource.\n\n## By bus\nUpper Egypt Bus Co. runs daily buses from Asyut, which is on the Cairo-Luxor main road and railway line. These leave around 8AM and take 3-4 hr to Kharga Oasis, then the same again to reach Dakhla towards 4PM.\nThey also in the past ran direct buses from Cairo Turgman Terminal, via Bahariyya and Farafra oases, but it is not known if these still run in April 2020.\n\n## By taxi\nGetting here direct from Cairo, Luxor or northern oases, you will probably need a taxi. The price might be reasonable between two or more visitors.\n\n## By plane\nDakhla has an airport but no longer has scheduled civilian flights.\n\n## Get around\nThere are 4 or 5 buses per day from Mut to Balat at the east edge of the oasis, and to Qasr at the north edge.\nThe bus stand is just north of the main road junction in Mut.\n\n## See\nPopular Heritage Museum, Mut. This follows the ground plan of a traditional Islamic house with women's quarters and public men's rooms. It displays pots, rugs, dresses, baskets and jewelry used in Islamic times and pictures of everyday life. Hours erratic.\n25.593828.91221 Deir Abu Matta (19 km north of Mut).

The area southwest is a vast desert terrain, occupying the corner of Egypt between Libya and Sudan. Going there is a full-on expedition, taking 2-3 weeks, and only by military permission. For more details see Dakhla Oasis, the usual entry point. There are fantastical rock formations, great sand dunes, war remnants, and a litter of ancient pitchers used to water donkeys. Cave decorations depict animals, plants and human activities from the last wet period 10,000 years ago. Or was it? - Gerhard Rohlfs' expedition of 1874 got caught out here in a downpour that lasted almost 48 hours.

The German description of Dakhla (on sidebar left) runs to 24 pages of documentation, and that on Gilf Kebir (below) to 18.\nThe historic route between Dakhla and Farafra, used since Roman times, continues north for 200 km; but the modern road swings west and is 300 km. That's to avoid the mountains, shifting sands and the difficult 25.771728.85183 Pass of Naqb el Qasr, littered with huge limestone blocks. The crest is only 200 m, but the terrain will defeat all but a rufty-tufty experienced off-road driver. Or take an 11 km hike from the nearest roadhead to enter through Bab el Cailliaud, named for Frédéric Cailliaud (1787-1869) of Nantes, whose work in these regions helped decipher ancient hieroglyphics.\n\n## Eat\nAbu Mohamed Restaurant, Third Street. expensive\nAnwar Restaurant, Desert Paradise (in the town center), ☏ +20 92 2820070.\nArabi Restaurant, 3rd Street.\nAhmed Hamdi Restaurant, Third Street, ☏ +20 92 2820767.\nAlso in Mut are Dawia, Shahab, and Abu Zeid Qalamuni cafe.\n\n## Budget\nAl-Dohous Bedouin Camp, Sheikh Abd-al Hamid, ☏ +20 92 2850480, +20 92 2850605. 20 chalets or tents, hot and cold water, inexpensive, view on the desert, camel safaris and 4x4 drives can be arranged\nEl Forsan, Ehab Zacharia (in the town center), ☏ +20 92 2821343. 9 rooms, hot and cold water, associated to Anwar Restaurant\nGardens Hotel (Al-Ganain Hotel), ☏ +20 92 2821577. hot and cold water.

          "content": "The Kharga Oasis (Arabic: الخارجة al-Ḫāriǧa, pronounced [elˈxæɾɡæ]) lit. 'the outer'; Coptic: (ϯ)ⲟⲩⲁϩ ⲛ̀ϩⲏⲃ (di)wah enhib, \"Oasis of Hib\", (ϯ)ⲟⲩⲁϩ ⲙ̀ⲯⲟⲓ (di)wah empsoi \"Oasis of Psoi\") is the southernmost of Egypt's five western oases. It is located in the Western Desert, about 200 km (125 miles) to the west of the Nile valley. \"Kharga\" or \"El Kharga\" is also the name of a major town located in the oasis, the capital of New Valley Governorate. The oasis, which was known as the 'Southern Oasis' to the Ancient Egyptians, the 'outer' (he Exotero) to the Greeks and Oasis Magna to the Romans, is the largest of the oases in the Libyan desert of Egypt. It is in a depression about 160 km (100 miles) long and from 20 km (12 miles) to 80 km (50 miles) wide. Its estimated population is 87,482 as of 2023.\n\nOverview\nKharga is the most modernised of Egypt's western oases. The main town is highly functional with all modern facilities, and virtually nothing left of old architecture. There is extensive thorny date palm, acacia, buffalo thorn, and jujube growth in the oasis surrounding the modern town of Kharga. Many remnant wildlife species inhabit this region.\n\nClimate\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Kharga Oasis experiences extreme summers for most of the year with no precipitation and warm winters with cool nights.\n\nDarb El Arba'īn caravan route\nA trade route called Darb El Arba'īn (\"the Way of Forty\") passed through Kharga as part of a long caravan route running north–south between Middle Egypt and the Sudan. The ancient route connected the Al-Fashir area of Sudan to Asyut in Egypt, navigating through a chain of oases including Kharga, Selima Oasis and Bir Natrun.\nAt least 700 years old, it was likely used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.\n\nThe maximum extent of Darb El Arba'īn was northward from Kobbei in Darfur (located about 25 miles north of al-Fashir) passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending at the Nile River access point of Asyut in Egypt. This is a journey of approximately 1,800 km (1,100 mi). The desert route was less expensive and safer than the more visually appealing Nile route.\nAll the oases have always been crossroads of caravan routes converging from the barren desert. In the case of Kharga, this is made particularly evident by the presence of a chain of fortresses that the Romans built to protect the Darb El Arba'īn route.  The forts vary in size and function, some being just small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.  Some were installed where earlier settlements already existed, while others were probably started from scratch. All of them are made of mud bricks, but some also contain small stone temples with inscriptions on the walls.\nDescribed by Herodotus as a road \"traversed…in forty days,\" by his time the route had already become an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. The length of the journey is the reason for it being called Darb El Arba`īn, the implication being \"the forty-day road\".\nAfter the prominent Christian theologian Nestorius was condemned as a heretic in the 431 Council of Ephesus, he was removed from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople and exiled to a monastery then located in the Great Oasis of Hibis (El Kharga). There he lived for the rest of his life. The monastery suffered attacks by desert bandits, and Nestorius was injured in one such raid. Nestorius seems to have survived there until at least 450 and there had composed the Bazaar of Heracleides—the only one of his writings to survive in full, and of importance to the Christian Nestorians who follow his teachings.\nAs part of a caravan proceeding to Darfur, the English explorer W.G. Browne paused for several days at Kharga, leaving with the rest of the group 7 June 1793. At the time a gindi (a Turkish horseman, that performs extraordinary feats) was stationed at Kharga, \"belonging to Ibrahim Bey El Kebir, to whom those villages appertain; and to [this official] is entrusted the management of what relates to the caravan during the time of its stay there.\"\nIn 1930 the archaeologist, Gertrude Caton–Thompson, uncovered the palaeolithic history of Kharga.\n\nTemple of Hibis\nDemographics\nIn his diary, “Al-Hajj Al-Bari” mentioned the most important families descending of Christians and Romans in the Kharga Oasis. They are the families of “Al-Jawiya, the families of Al-Tawayh, the Al-Bahramah family, the Al-Sanadiyah family, the Al-Azayza family, the Al-Badayrah family, the Al-Mahbasiya family, the Al-Hosnieh family, and the Al-Na’imah family And the Al-Sharayra family, and there are Nubian families in the village of Baris.  There are few Berber families too who are thought to be the indigenous people of Kharga but the majority today are Arab families.\nPerhaps the most important of these Arab families that came to the Khargha Oasis from the beginning of the year 300 AH are the families of the Idris from Tunisia or Libya, the family of Rekabia and the family of the jewehera from the Hijaz and the family of shakawera and the family of Al-Radawana and the family from the Arabs of Mecca and the family of Al-Shawami from the Levant and there are families from the countries of the Egyptian country such as Dabatiya and Asawiya from Assiut Or Sohag and the Awlad-el-sheikh from Egypt “It is more likely to mean Cairo”, the family of Njarin from Qalamoun in Dakhla, the family of Al Shaabna from Mallawi, the family of Al-Awamir from Al-Amayem tribe and the family of Al-Alawneh from Al-Alawiya in addition to Turkish families such as Al-Dabashiya, Al-Tarakah Al-Kharja and the Bash families The Qaqamqam, Askari, Tannabur, Qitas, and Kashif.\n\nTransportation\nA regular bus service connects the oasis to the other Western oases and to the rest of Egypt. In 1907, the narrow gauge Western Oasis Lines provided twice-weekly train services. A standard gauge railway line Kharga → Qena (Nile Valley) → Port Safaga (Red Sea) has been in service since 1996, but has been decommissioned soon after.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Temple of Hibis is a Saite-era temple founded by Psamtik II, which was erected largely c. 500 BC. It is located about 2 kilometres north of modern Kharga, in a palm-grove. There is a second 1st millennium BC temple in the southernmost part of the oasis at Dush. An ancient Christian cemetery at El Bagawat also functioned at the Kharga Oasis from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. It is one of the earliest and best preserved Christian cemeteries in the ancient world.\nThe first list of sites is due to Ahmad Fakhri but serious archaeological work began in 1976 with Serge Sauneron, director of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale.\n\nSites\nAin El Beleida (Roman)\nAin El Labakha (Roman)\nAin Manawir (Persian, Roman)\nAin Shams El Din (Coptic church)\nAin El Tarakwa (Roman)\nAin Tauleib (Roman)\nDeir Mustafa Kashef (Coptic monastery)\nDeir El Munira (Roman)\nDush, Egypt (Ptolemaic and Roman)\nGabbanat El Bagawat (Coptic cemetery)\nGebel El Teir (Prehistoric times)\nEl Nadura (Roman)\nQasr El Dabashiya (Roman)\nQasr Dush (Greco-Roman)\nQasr El Ghuweita (Late Period)\nQasr El Gibb (Roman)\nQasr El Zayyan (Greco-Roman)\nSumeira (Roman)\nTemple of Hibis (Persian - c. 6th century BC.)\nUmm El Dabadib (Roman)\nUmm Mawagir (Middle Kingdom, 2nd Intermediate Period)\n\nMeteorite dagger\nIn June 2016, a report emerged that attributed the dagger buried with Pharaoh Tutankhamun to an iron meteorite, with similar proportions of metals (iron, nickel and cobalt) to one discovered near and named after Kharga Oasis.

          "content": "## Overview\nKharga (Arabic الخارجة) is an oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt.\n\n## Towns and villages\n25.45056130.545251 Kharga (Arabic: الخارجة‎) – The main town and transport hub. It is entirely modern but has visitor facilities, and the district is dotted with ancient sites, the best being the Temple of Hibis and the necropolis of El Bagawat. References on this page to Kharga mean this town and vicinity unless \"Kharga oasis\" is specified.\n24.67428130.6022892 Baris  (Arabic: باريس‎) – The other town, 86 km south and separated by a strip of desert. The main sight is the Roman-era temple at Qasr Dush, and there's also the weird modern shell of the Hassan Fathy village. Baris lacks facilities so most visitors day-trip from Kharga.\n24.69333130.5960193 Hassan Fathy Village – 8 km north of Baris is one of several 20th C villages across Egypt created by re-imagining traditional adobe styles, under the tutelage of architect Fathy (1900-1989). Construction began in the 1960s but halted on the outbreak of war in 1967; the project was abandoned and the buildings were never used.\n24.50846930.61454 Qasr Baris – A village with a Roman adobe ruin.\n25.7154530.5545195 Qasr el Labacha – A settlement 35 km north of Kharga town, with a Roman fort. You will need an off-road vehicle.\n\n## Understand\nKharga is the largest of the five western oases, 160 km long and from 20 km to 80 km wide. The main town is also called Kharga, separated by a desert strip from Baris to the south. The reason to visit is the antiquities just north of Kharga town, and the string of Roman forts set up to control Darb El Arbayin, the \"Forty Days Road\" bringing gold and ivory from Africa into Egypt.\nLike the other western oases, the climate is hot desert, 40+°C summer and 10°C in winter. There is zero rainfall and all the oasis supply is \"fossil water\" extracted from the aquifer, a non-renewable resource.\n\n## Get in\nKharga has an airport but no flights, and trains no longer run here. The old narrow-gauge railway from the Nile valley was replaced in 1989 by a standard-gauge track all the way to Safaga on the Red Sea coast, intended to export phosphates from Kharga's deposits. But by the time it was completed the price of phosphates had dropped, the deposits were never mined, and the new line was abandoned. The track still lies alongside the highway between Kharga and Baris, and in parts along the Baris-Luxor road.\n\n## By bus\nBuses and minibuses ply between Kharga and Baris, taking an hour.\n\n## By road\nThere is a direct highway from Luxor to Baris, at the south end of the oasis. There is no public transport along this route but it is a good highway for taxis and private vehicles.\nA highway leads south from the oasis for mile upon aching desert mile, following the ancient caravan trail towards Darfur, before despairing of further progress and looping back north to Dakhla oasis. There is no crossing point into Sudan.\n\n## On foot\nThe principal sights of Kharga town are within a long walk on a cool day, but you do not want to be weary before you start, and then there is the getting back.\n\n## By taxi\nArrange a taxi to take you around the antiquities, the driver will know which dusty unsignposted turn-off to head down.\nSeveral sights need a vehicle, and some are only for off-road vehicles with a guide.\n\n## See\n25.4765530.5559191 Temple of Hibis. 2 km north of Kharga town, is a large well-preserved temple from the Saite-Persian period of 664-404 BCE. It originally stood on a lake island in the town of Hibis, but lake and ancient town are now farmland, and Hibis means \"plough\". The temple is dedicated to two versions of the god Amun. You enter down a long hallway lined with sphinxes, through several pylons into the main temple. The hypostyle hall has walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, richly decorated. One of these, showing Seth defeating Apep, is a foretaste of Saint George and the Dragon. The naos or inner shrine has a pantheon of Egyptian deity and royal figures, with almost 700 figures. Adult admission LE80, combi-ticket with El Bagawat LE120, as of Nov 2019.\nSeen on a hill east of the Temple of Hibis is the larger of the two temples of Nadura.

          "content": "Sharm El Sheikh, alternatively rendered Sharm el-Sheikh or Charm el Sheikh, is an Egyptian city located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in South Sinai Governorate, on the coastal strip along the Red Sea in Asia. Its population is approximately 77,000 as of 2017. Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, St. Catherine and Mount Sinai. \nThe city was historically a fishing town and military base, and was developed into a commercial and tourist-centric city afterwards. The Egyptian government continued and expanded the development, promoting Sharm El Sheikh as a major international resort city. Today, Sharm El Sheikh and its holiday resorts is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences, diplomatic meetings and also concerts and clubbing.\nDowntown Sharm El Sheikh has the major concentrations of international banks in the city and is home to several large national companies. The city is home to major hospitals and health facilities, including Sharm International Hospital, the city's largest hospital and others engaged in health-related care and research. Sharm El Sheikh port is the city's seaport, which lies on the coast of the Red Sea,   and the nearest airport is the city's Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. The Sharm El Sheikh metropolitan area is one of the most visited cities in Egypt, attracting over 10 million visitors in 2024.\n\nName\nThe English name of Sharm El Sheikh is a borrowing of the Egyptian Arabic شرم الشيخ, šarm aš-šayḵ and, as such, does not have a fixed romanisation. There are documented uses of alternate spellings such as Sharm el Sheikh and Sharm el-Sheikh, sometimes within the same news article.\nSharm El Sheikh is sometimes referred to as the \"City of Peace\" (مدينة السلام, madinet es-salām), referring to the large number of international peace conferences that have been held there.\nAmongst Egyptians and also many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to \"Sharm\" (Egyptian Arabic: [ʃɑɾm]), which is its common name in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nGeography and history\nSharm El Sheikh is on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until 1967 when it was ordered to leave by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fact that precipitated the Six-Day War during which it was reoccupied by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control from 1967 until the Sinai Peninsula was returned back to Egypt in 1982, after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 that was signed in Washington, D.C. During that time, an Israeli settlement named Ofira was built in the area.\nIn 1968, Israel opened an air force military base there, where Egypt later built the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport on the same location that included an enormous $420m investment by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, a major project that helped put the city on global map.  Unlike Sinai's other well-known settlement, Yamit, Ofira was not demolished after Israel ceded control of Sinai to Egypt following the Camp David Accords, but was returned intact and is today a thriving tourist town and home to local Egyptian residents.\nEgypt's former president Hosni Mubarak designated Sharm El Sheikh as The City of Peace in 1982 and the Egyptian government began a policy of encouraging massive development of the city. Egyptian businessmen and investors, along with global investors contributed to building several mega projects, including mosques and churches. The city is now an international tourist destination, and environmental zoning laws limit the height of buildings to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings. In 2022, Sharm El-Sheikh along with another Egyptian city, Hurghada, were both chosen by Trip advisor as the world's top 25 tourist destinations.\nA hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the Gulf of Aqaba, whereby the area's components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: Taba, Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, Naama Bay, Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.\nSharm El Sheikh city, with Naama Bay, Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and Shark's Bay form a metropolitan area.\nThe site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.\nIn 2005, the resort was hit by the Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks, which were carried out by an extremist Islamist organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history.\n\nThe city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to establish Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. A second summit was held at Sharm on 17 October 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but it failed to end the violence. A summit was held in the city on 3 August 2005 on developments in the Arab world, such as the situation in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Again in 2007, an important ministerial meeting took place in Sharm, where dignitaries discussed Iraqi reconstruction.\n\nThe World Economic Forum on the Middle East was hosted by Sharm El Sheikh in 2006 and 2008. Amidst the 2011 Egyptian protests, then-president Mubarak reportedly went to Sharm El Sheikh and resigned there on 11 February 2011. The 2014 World Economic Forum in Sharm El Sheikh heralded a new initiative for desert cities urban development in Egypt.  In November 2022, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) was held in Sharm El Sheikh. This conference led to the first loss and damage fund being created.\nOn Monday, October 13, 2025, the city hosted an international summit titled \"Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit\" co-chaired by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Donald Trump, with the participation of world leaders from more than 20 countries aiming to end the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nClimate\nThe city experiences a subtropical arid climate, classified by the Köppen–Geiger system as hot desert (BWh). Temperatures are just short of a tropical climate. Typical temperatures range from 18 to 23 °C (64 to 73 °F) in January and 33 to 37 °C (91 to 99 °F) in August. The temperature of the Red Sea in this region ranges from 21 to 28 °C (70 to 82 °F) over the course of the year.\nMarsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm El Sheikh have the warmest winter night temperatures of cities and resorts in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 3 June 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was 5 °C (41 °F) on 23 February 2000.\n\nEconomy and tourism\nSharm El Sheikh's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism, owing to its landscape, year-round dry climate with long hot summers and warm winters and its long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various water sports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkelling. There is scope for scientific tourism due to the diversity of marine life: 250 different coral reefs and 1000 species of fishes.\nThese natural resources, together with its proximity to tourist markets in Europe, have stimulated rapid growth in tourism in the region. The number of resorts has increased from three in 1982 to ninety-one in 2000. Guest nights also increased in that period from sixteen thousand to 5.1 million. International hotel companies that currently operate in the city include Accor (Mövenpick, Novotel, Rixos), Deutsche Hospitality (Steigenberger), Four Seasons, Hilton (DoubleTree), Marriott (Renaissance, Sheraton), and Rotana, with categories of three to five stars. In 2007, the first aqua park hotel resort opened in the area. The four-star Aqua Blu Sharm Resort was built on the Ras Om El Seid, with an area of 133,905 square metres (1,441,340 sq ft).\nSharm is also home to a congress center, located along Peace Road, where international political and economic meetings have been held, including peace conferences, ministerial meetings, world bank meetings, and Arab League meetings. The Maritim Sharm El Sheikh International Congress Centre can host events and congresses for up to 4,700 participants.\nThere is nightlife in Sharm El Sheikh. The colourful handicraft stands of the local Bedouin culture are a popular attraction. Ras Muhammad National Park, at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, has been designated a national park, protecting the area's wildlife, natural landscape, shoreline and coral reef. There are a number of international hotels and restaurants in the centre of Sharm, in the area known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.\nThe Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area is a 600-square-kilometre (230 sq mi) area of mangroves, coral reefs, fertile dunes, birds and wildlife.\nAs of 2012, nationals from the EU and the US do not require a visa for travel to Sharm El Sheikh if the visit is for fourteen days or less, although those travelling outside the Sinai area may still require a visa, which is purchasable for a small fee on arrival. Visitors are often ushered into a queue to buy a visa after entering the airport upon landing.\n\nFlight incidents\nOn 23 August 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it. the missile missed the airliner by about 1,000 feet (300 meters), and the plane landed safely. A UK investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise, although the Egyptian government said the flight was never at risk.\nOn 31 October 2015, while flying from Sharm El Sheikh to Saint Petersburg, Metrojet Flight 9268 was destroyed by a bomb above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 people on board, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for this incident. This caused the repatriation of British and Russian tourists from 5 November 2015. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh be suspended. These suspensions were gradually lifted as the security situation improved, with the UK government ending its ban on direct flights on 22 October 2019. The process of lifting flight suspensions was completed on 9 August 2021, when the first direct flight from Russia since November 2015 (operated by Rossiya Airlines) landed at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport.\n\nTransport\nLampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power. Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.\nSharm's marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.\nThe city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.\nSharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.\n\nWater sports\nSharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkelling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing and stand up paddleboarding.\nRas Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over 800 metres (2,600 ft), and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.\nThe Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.\nThe Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.\n\nShark attacks\nOn 1 December 2010, four tourists − three Russians and a Ukrainian − were attacked and injured by an oceanic whitetip shark or sharks in three separate incidents off Sharm El Sheikh. One victim lost a leg, and another an arm. The Egyptian authorities claimed that the shark responsible for the attacks had been captured alive, but the identification was disputed by the diving industry, based on eyewitness and photographic evidence. Four days later, on 5 December, an elderly German woman was attacked and killed by a shark while snorkeling at the resort.\n\nEducation\nSt. Joseph Schools\nL'école française de Sharm el Sheikh EFSSH (FRENCH SCHOOL)\nFayroz Experimental School\nGeel October School\nSharm College\nSharm British School\nKing Salman International University, Sharm El Sheikh campus\n\nTwin towns\nAqaba,  Jordan (since December 2015)\nSwakopmund,  Namibia (since June 2008)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nRed Sea Riviera\nSharm El Sheikh Memorandum\nSouth Sinai Hospital\nRas Sedr\nRas Muhammad National Park\nDahab\nTaba\nNuweiba\nFlash Airlines Flight 604\n\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Sharm el-Sheikh at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSharm El Sheikh - Egyptian Tourism Authority",

Le quartier est presque entièrement réservé aux piétons.\nSur le golfe d'Aqaba\n\nShark's Bay : au cours de l’urbanisation rapide de la ville, cet endroit était le dernier à être occupé par les bédouins.\nL'aéroport.\n\nTourisme\nClimat\nSitué entre le désert du Sinaï et la mer Rouge, Charm el-Cheikh bénéficie d'un climat désertique chaud (classification de Köppen BWh), c'est-à-dire un climat très chaud et très sec. Les températures maximales en été peuvent atteindre parfois 40 °C. Les hivers sont très doux, la présence de la mer accentuant la douceur en hiver. La température moyenne annuelle est de 23 °C. Les précipitations sont très faibles. Le ciel est souvent limpide et dégagé, et le soleil brille jusqu’à 3 800 h par an.\n\nHistoire\nVillage de pêcheurs à l’origine, Charm el-Cheikh devient une base stratégique pour la marine égyptienne.\nEntre 1956 et 1957 a lieu la guerre de Suez entre Israël et l’Égypte. Les Israéliens occupent puis évacuent le Sinaï. Une force de paix internationale stationne à Charm el-Cheikh de 1957 à 1967. Mais en juin 1967, Nasser occupe la commune, bloque le détroit de Tiran, et coupe ainsi l’accès de la mer Rouge aux bateaux de la flotte maritime israélienne, ce qui entraîne l’intervention d’Israël : c’est la guerre des Six Jours. À la suite de la défaite égyptienne, Israël occupe le Sinaï. La ville est alors rebaptisée. En 1968, Les Israéliens construisent une colonie appelée Ophira à Ras Umm Sid pour y installer cinq-cents familles, et font de Naama Bay un centre touristique.\nL’aéroport est ouvert en 1976.\nEn 1978, les récifs de Naama Bay sont détruits par une inondation.\nEn 1982, la commune est restituée aux Égyptiens, qui encouragent le développement de la ville. Une base de la Force multinationale et observateurs au Sinaï est créée à la même date.\nLe 4 septembre 1999 a lieu la signature du Mémorandum de Charm el-Cheikh entre Israël et l’Autorité palestinienne en présence de Madeleine Albright, du président Hosni Moubarak et du roi de Jordanie Abdallah II.\nLe 3 janvier 2004 a lieu l’accident d'avion du vol Flash Airlines 604 de la compagnie Flash Airlines, qui fait cent-quarante-huit morts en s’abîmant dans la mer Rouge peu après son décollage.\n\nLa ville est victime d’attentats le 23 juillet 2005. Le Old Market à Sharm el-Maya, les hôtels Ghazala gardens et Moevenpick à Naama Bay sont touchés.\nLe 5 décembre 2010, à Charm el-Cheikh, une touriste allemande a été tuée par un requin longimane (peut-être un requin mako) alors qu'elle nageait dans la Mer Rouge devant son hôtel. Deux attaques contre des baigneurs russes et ukrainiens la semaine précédente lui sont également attribué.\nChassé du pouvoir par la révolution égyptienne de 2011, Hosni Moubarak se réfugie à Charm-el-Cheikh entre sa démission de la présidence le 11 février et son arrestation en avril.\nLe 31 octobre 2015, l'Airbus A321 qui avait décollé de Charm el-Cheikh pour assurer le vol n°9268 de la compagnie russe Metrojet à destination de Saint-Pétersbourg, s'écrase dans le Sinaï avec ses deux-cent-vingt-quatre passagers et membres d'équipage. Il n'y a aucun survivant.\nDu 6 au 18 novembre 2022, la ville accueille la COP27.\n\nÉconomie\nCharm el-Cheikh est un ancien port, mais des lois environnementales strictes apparues dans les années 1990 ont réduit la navigation commerciale. Jusqu’en 1982, il n’y avait qu’un port militaire situé à Marsa Bareka. Le port civil se développa à la fin des années 1980, lorsque Sharm el-Maya devint le principal port civil.\nLa principale activité économique de la ville est le tourisme, grâce à ses plages, et à un climat sec et agréable. La mer y est aussi claire que calme. De plus, l’endroit est favorable à la pratique de la plongée sous-marine. Enfin, à quelques kilomètres au sud de la ville se situe le parc national de Ras Mohammed. Le tourisme se remarque par la présence d’hôtels de luxe et de semi-luxe, notamment à Naama Bay.\n\nTransports\nIl est possible de se déplacer dans Charm el-Cheikh ou de se rendre depuis cette ville vers d’autres destinations grâce à plusieurs moyens de transport :\n\nen voiture : les routes du Sinaï sont goudronnées.\nen avion : via EgyptAir ou des compagnies Charter, depuis l’aéroport international de Charm el-Cheikh\nen bus : liaison depuis la gare routière située à Peace Road. Durée des trajets : 6 h pour Suez, 7 h pour Le Caire, 1 h 30 pour Dahab, 3 h pour le monastère Sainte-Catherine, 10 h pour Hurghada ;\nen taxi collectif : minibus ou Peugeot 504, station sur Peace Road ;\nen bateau : liaisons avec Hurghada et Aqaba.\nLe projet de pont du détroit de Tiran permettrait de relier la ville à l'Arabie saoudite, à l'emplacement de la ville nouvelle Neom.\n\nGalerie\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nAttentats de Charm el-Cheikh du 23 juillet 2005\nVol Flash Airlines 604\nConférence sur le développement économique en Égypte\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\nRessource relative à l'audiovisuel : France 24 \nRessource relative à la musique : MusicBrainz  \n\n Portail de l’Égypte   Portail du tourisme",

          "content": "## Overview\nDahab (دهب) is a town in Egypt, 85 km (53 miles) north of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Gulf of Aqaba, near the southern tip of Sinai. It is a place that many have fallen in love with over the years, and return to time and time again.\n\n## Understand\nDahab was once an isolated coastal village inhabited only by the local Bedouin. In 1980, there were fewer than 30 Bedouin families in Dahab. Like the Bedouin inland, they had a self-sustaining lifestyle but in Dahab this was based on fishing as well as traditional goat herds. During the summer, many inland Bedouin came to Dahab for fishing and to collect dates, and to enjoy life by the sea. To this day, favourite presents from Dahab (for the inland Bedouin) are dried fish and dates.\nDahab's isolated location, idyllic setting and laid-back Bedouin hospitality made it a favourite destination for all who stumbled upon it. In the beginning (1970s), this was mainly Israeli soldiers or people from the kibbutz during their leave. During the 1980s it turned into a hippie hangout, and in the 1990s adventure enthusiasts from around the world began to discover Dahab's natural wonders. The combination of Red Sea and Sinai desert make Dahab perfect for world class windsurfing, scuba diving, freediving, rock climbing and of course desert trekking with the Bedouin. Add to this cheap accommodation on or near the beach, inexpensive food and drink and a relaxed atmosphere, and you have a heady enticement for the young and young at heart.\nToday's Dahab has evolved into an \"alternative resort\" - the home of independent and adventurous travellers, but also with some more upmarket resorts and hotels. Most of the latter are in the Laguna area or outlying. For some people, this mix is part of Dahab's charm (\"everyone welcome\"), others regard the mix up as a problem: Prices in Assalah are artificially increased which makes it less and less interesting for backpackers, though some locally-run camps still keep affordable. In contrast to that, many package tourists and families won't feel comfortable with the lacking conveniences and the all-handmade-look among the hippies. Note the grotesque, forever unfinished concrete structures as a sign of this mismanagement.\nStill, for everyone with an open mind, Dahab is definitely worth a visit and a place to fall in love with. Particularly in the old part of Dahab (Masbat and Mashraba), you will rarely find a visitor who comes only once to Dahab. To many people this has become a second home.\n\n## Climate\nThe climate is sunny and very dry with almost no rainfall. Summers are very hot at days and warm at nights, but winters are warm with mild nights.\n\n## By bus\n28.4859734.496821 Dahab bus station (East Delta) (in the medina, 3-4 km west of the main tourist strip). This is a woebegone place though there are shops in the vicinity. On arrival you will be mobbed by aggressive taxi drivers, who may even manhandle you into their car. A fair price is LE35 for the whole cab. Be prepared to walk it—and really mean it, it is the \"Method Acting\" approach to haggling - and their price may drop to something realistic. You want to head east, which is slightly downhill, then be trending northeast. So walk 200 m down to the divided highway El Nasr Road, then left / north for 200 m, then the first right is Peace Road which sweeps round into downtown Dahab. In town centre along Peace Road is the East Delta bus office, who sell tickets and can give the latest info on their buses, but buses do not call here: phone is +20 69 3641 808.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.4954134.515022 Go Bus station. Almost opposite the East Delta bus office is where Go Buses arrive from Cairo. It is little more than a dirt parking lot but you have more amenities in the nearby town.    (updated Mar 2020)\nBuses no longer run to and from St Catherine.\nFrom Cairo – Six daily Go Buses, taking 9 hr from Cairo's Turgoman station (central), Abbasseya station (30 min from centre) and Heliopolis (near airport). Buses may not serve all stations. Best to buy tickets in advance, especially for the night buses.\nFrom Sharm el Sheikh town – The bus operator is East Delta. Their published timetable is only a statement of good intentions: services have been pruned back, and this is likely to get worse during 2020. But insha'allah, they may run from Sharm to Dahab at 6AM, 7AM, 8AM, 9AM, 2:30PM, 5PM, 8:30PM; and from Dahab to Sharm at 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, 11:30AM, 12:30PM, 3PM, 4PM, 5:30PM, 7:30PM, 8:30PM, 9:30PM and 10PM. The bus takes just under 2 hr.\nFrom Sharm el Sheikh airport – Your first problem is to get to Sharm bus station 17 km away, see Sharm el Sheikh \"Get in\" for taxi tips. The bus service is erratic, so if you are arriving in the evening your best plan is to pre-arrange a taxi all the way to Dahab, see below. If you do get the bus, notice it stops at wayside halts to pick up waifs and strays, and at a checkpoint and filling station only 5 km from the airport: but will it pick up or drop off anywhere nearer the airport? No chance, they have probably had the frighteners put on them by the taxi cartel.\nFrom the north – This is even more erratic, with maybe one bus or none at all from Taba through Taba Heights and Nuweiba, continuing from Dahab to Sharm. East Delta may not be able to say until shortly before departure whether one is running today.\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi within the centre should not exceed LE30, and LE40-60 for further out including the bus station, as of Aug 2021. Expect them to try to charge you twice that.\n\n## By boat\nSee Nuweiba for details of the ferries from Aqaba in Jordan. These also ply to Taba Heights further up the coast; this route is faster but you need to arrive in Egypt via Nuweiba if you are travelling beyond Sinai and therefore need an Egyptian visa.\nReaching the ferry port from Dahab is by bus or taxi. Usually a bus leaves Sharm at 8:30AM calling at Dahab at 10:30AM on the way north to Taba. So if you phone around 9AM, there should be word on whether it is running today, whereupon you either head for the bus station or negotiate a taxi.\n\n## Orientation\nPlus outlying hotels – Stretching north towards the Blue Hole, and South to Wadi Gnai, there are around 15 outlying resort hotels - mainly booked as package holidays.\nPlus Protected Areas – Dahab is bordered by 2 protected areas: in the south, Nabq Protected Area starts at Wadi Gnai, as in the North Ras Abu Galum Protected Area starts at the Blue Hole. 52% of the Gulf of Aqaba coastline is protected area, which is very important for managing growth and for preserving the reef and eco system. No building is allowed in protected areas, except traditional Bedouin structures.\n\n## On foot\nGetting around Dahab on foot is quite simple, the promenade runs right along the seafront and all the usual amenities are located along it.\n\n## By bicycle\nBicycles are a convenient way to get around Dahab and to get to surrounding sites such as Blue Hole and Three Pools. There is little traffic, and bikes are common so cars take them somewhat into account (as compared to anywhere else in Egypt). There are dedicated bicycle rental stores, but accommodation such as hotels may also have some available. One 28.4966734.516491 bike rental shop is located next to Peace Bridge, which quotes LE100 for one day.\nFor some parts (such as the last part to the Blue Hole), an off-road bike is preferred. On the other hand, most rental places already seem to be mostly offering mountain bikes.\n\n## See\n28.49411334.517191 The Nabataean Port (200 m south of the bridge). It is just a few masonry foundations, but this was once a major port receiving spices and other valuable goods from India. From here goods were taken overland to Petra then onward to Gaza for shipping across the Med. The Nabataeans emerged as an independent Arab nation in the 4th century BC, for long acting as a buffer state for Rome then annexed into the Roman Empire in 106 AD, and disappearing by the 5th century AD. Just peer through the railings on the prom, you havve seen enough.    (updated Mar 2020)\nVery tall palm trees – Straight and stiff-leaved: how many can you spot? Yes, they are mobile telephone masts.\n28.89555634.4221132 Ain Khudra. Bedouin palm-tree oasis. Can be busy in the day. To see it at its best, include in a longer desert safari and stay for dinner and overnight.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.88620634.4265683 White Canyon. Right next to Ain Khudra.    (updated Mar 2020)\n29.14889334.5928964 Coloured Canyon. Mainly a day trip. If you would like to combine as part of a longer desert safari, be sure to have a full Egyptian visa as it is often needed for the best route.    (updated Mar 2020)\nSt. Catherine monastery and Mount Sinai are accessible as of 2023 but the previous public busses seem to no longer run and thus your options are to book a taxi or an organized tour ($25 everywhere in Dahab).\n\n## Offshore\nDahab's main offshore attractions are described here, north to south (the usual direction of current), as there are various ways to enjoy them. Dive shacks and other shore facilities are listed under \"Do\". The coral is very close to shore so you just walk in, but only at selected access points to limit the damage to coral and to you. Boats are only used for outlying sites with no access track. The tidal range in Dahab is at most a metre so all depths cited have that degree of flex.\n28.61478534.5596095 Abu Galoum (15 km north of town). A nature reserve with camping and snorkelling. No road so you need a boat or camel to get in; few bother so it is a quiet spot.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.57234.5376 The Blue Hole (close to shore at the dead-end of a dirt track 7 km north of town). The signature dive at Dahab. It is safe and enjoyable provided you are sensible about depth limits, but the layout creates a temptation to dive deeper. Much deeper. Much much deeper and then it is curtains. This area has cafes and toilets but no dive shack, bring all your own kit. It can get crowded, as excursion buses often come from Sharm-el-Sheikh. The \"hole\" is a sinkhole some 100 m across and just over 100 m deep, surrounded by shallow reef, and with a \"saddle\" 6-7 m deep between the hole and open sea. The deep sheltered waters make it popular with freedivers, and it is often good for snorkelling and diving on windy days when other sites are too rough. Divers typically swim underwater across the hole, with the Arch glimmering far below (this would be a really bad time to lose a weight-belt). There is not much coral within the hole so they then cross the saddle to explore the better stuff outside.The Arch in the side of the Blue Hole is the killer if you are not geared up for a technical dive, and sometimes even if you are. It is a tunnel between hole and open sea that glimmers temptingly. \"Aw c'mon, just a quick extra descent to look-see, can't hurt?\" But it is deeper than it looks, with the entrance at 55 m. And it is not a simple archway but a 26 m tunnel. \"Still, now we're here . . . \" then it springs its trap: the tunnel roof slopes down to 85 m before trending up again into the open sea, while its floor drops away below 120 m. If you come down here breathing air or even nitrox, you will be as drunk as a skunk in a barrel of moonshine. And your air consumption is 9+ times faster than on the surface; if you are only toting a single gas tank, it will last less than ten min—not enough to get back, let alone for the considerable decompression period you have incurred. Technical divers with rebreathers and trimix gas also sometimes perish here, but their kit is inherently more hazardous, and it is not clear whether they suffer more accidents in the Blue Hole than at similar depths elsewhere. US$10/€9/LE150 fee for tourists (and a trivial fee for Egyptians).    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.57345434.539277 The Bells. A nearby site often combined with Blue Hole by drifting south. It is a narrow groove through the reef; as well as the coral there is an arch at modest depth and a natural chimney you can swim up or down. Officially it is named for two rocks like church bells, unofficially it is because divers keep clanging their tanks against the walls.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.55734.5238 Canyon (along the same track 5 km north of town). There is a collection of cafes. The canyon is an underwater gully with overhanging walls. Enter and exit via the broader middle section, you are not allowed to pass through \"The Fishbowl\" chimney at its shallow end. In 2020 a humongous green moray eel resides on the canyon walls, rolling its jaws like a Moloch awaiting the pizza delivery boy. No fee to come this far.    (updated Mar 2020)\nAbu Telha and Abu Helal are at the north edge of Dahab, with a smaller canyon. The road is paved this far.\n28.50634.529 Eel Garden (at the north end of the promenade strip, 1 km from the bridge). They are sand eels, scores of them shaped like a \"?\" and gently swaying. They retract as you approach and extend as you leave, to resume considering their question.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.49934.51910 Lighthouse (just north of the midtown bridge). The shallows are red gravel washed down from the wadi, deepening to a sea grass meadow which is a likely area to spot turtles or sea horses. A life-sized but dilapidated metal statue of an elephant at 18 m depth is the cue to turn north and come onto the attractive coral reef.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.49166534.5146211 Mashraba (just south of the bridge is the mirror image of Lighthouse). You descend across the gravel wash to the meadow then turn south along the reef. It is the house reef for the southside dive shacks.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.4834.51312 Laguna Beach (1 km south of the bridge). The beach and nearby Islands. It is shallow, good for snorkelling and beginner divers.\nThe spit off the spit south end of the promenade is exposed to wind and currents, so people windsurf here but divers and snorkellers seldom come.\n28.47534.50313 The Lagoon. A sheltered sandy bay good for kiddy-bathing and windsurfing. No coral so you do not cut your feet, but it means nothing for snorkellers or divers to look at.\nGabr el Bint further south has no road access so you get here by boat.\n\n## Do\n28.4534.462714 Wadi Qnai (7 km south of town). Variously spelled, an attractive granite valley with an oasis, Bedouin gardens and beach strip. Good for hikes, dinner in the mountains and rock climbing. Sites are \"Golden Blocks\" (large coral blocks boiling with marine life), \"Moray Garden\", \"Three Pools\", \"Om Sid\" and \"Caves\" which are really just overhangs. This is the end of the track, as the road heads inland towards Sharm. Few come this far south, so the table corals are in better shape than near town.    (updated Mar 2020)\nWindsurfing and kite-surfing. Dahab has about 270 days a year of wind. Experts with their own equipment can also surf from Masbat Bay, but must take care not to hit the snorkellers and freedivers on Lighthouse Reef. Kite surfing can be done around the lagoon area, at Eel Garden or at other spots. Some kiters head out to the Laguna at Ras Abu Galoum - a stunning location and you will be just 1 or 2 kites rather than 10 or 20!For wind forecast for Dahab see Wind Guru.

But make a start before coming here so that you can confidently exchange greetings and salutations. It's Egyptian Arabic you will use, do not bother with MSA which only newsreaders and government officials declaim.\nDo nothing – Just chill, that is the most traditional activity in Dahab. Watch the rippling sea and the changing pattern of light over the mountains.\n\n## Diving and freediving\nThere are dozens of diving and freediving centres in Dahab, but some are not properly licensed by the Ministry of Tourism (subject to annual inspections and fees).

All the courses are AIDA courses and the staff are all experienced AIDA trained instructors.\n\n## Desert excursions and trekking\nLots of agencies along the beach front are touting excursions. But the hotel and dive resorts also organise these, and have a stronger incentive to make sure their customers are happy. Trekking might involve hiking, horse-riding, camels, or various off-road vehicles.\nDay trips might be to Wadi Qnai and Ein Khudra. These places can feel touristy and crowded.\nOvernight is when you really get the desert experience. The canyons fall silent, stars blaze in a clear sky, the coffee-pot stews by the camp fire, and you sure wish you would brought an extra pullover and toilet roll.\nLonger trips are grandly called a \"safari\", which of course is the Arabic word for a journey. The traditional destination was inland towards Mount Sinai, but this remains compromised by the terrorist threat. Tours also venture as far as Petra in Jordan, Jerusalem in Israel, and Cairo and Luxor in Egypt: they are all top-rank destinations well worth seeing, but deserve a trip in their own right. These safaris may involve a flight from Sharm but more often a very long bus ride, where the rest hours of the driver (and of the oncoming drivers) may be a concern. You may also need an Egyptian visa, which you do not for the Dahab area: the safari agencies can arrange this quickly.\n\n## Rock climbing\nThe Sinai Desert has excellent rock climbing in the granite mountains and wadis. October–April only (i.e. not the hot summer months). The main area near to Dahab is Wadi Qnai:\nVast amounts of perfect bouldering on granite boulders in shaded, sand-floored valleys\nSingle and multi-pitch equipped sport routes for all levels of climbers in Waterfalls, Camel Canyon and Wadi Connection\nTop roping area especially for beginners and children in Middle Qnai\nPlus new routing possibilities for sport climbs in many easily accessible areas.\nDesert Divers have led the way in developing rock climbing in the Sinai. They can arrange for permits to Wadi Qnai, equipment hire, drivers, guides and anything else you might need. They have published the Sinai Rock Climbing Guide complete with topos and route descriptions. Their instructors are happy to share/offer advice to experienced climbers who can 'self-guide', or they can help you improve your climbing with beginner and Advanced technique courses.\nSt. Catherine also has incredible tradclimbing and bouldering. Base yourself in the village at Fox Camp [dead link] or Sheikh Mousa Bedouin Camp[dead link] with easy access (5 min to 2 hours) to more than 60 routes. All long multipitch (7+ pitch), but wide range of grades. If you are a group, it is great fun to head deep into the desert by camel where you will find unclimbed lines almost everywhere you look! Absolutely no bolting allowed in St Catherine, and please respect the holy mountains of Mt Sinai and St Katherine by walking the traditional pilgrimage paths rather than climbing.\n\n## Buy\nGreat buys are the usual Egyptian suspects: water pipes, rugs, oriental lamps, shirts in different lengths with embroidery, backgammon games, silver jewellery, etc.  Prices are geared for tourists, so haggling is a must, pay max. 50-60% of the first price offered, anything else is a rip-off. If you are not sure about the price, go to the next shop, they all offer more or less the same things, and start bargaining again there.\nLook out for Bedouin handicrafts, some beautiful pieces are available. Hand embroidered and made in Dahab, St Catherines and El Arish by Bedouin women. Sheikh Salem House has a good selection of items as does some of the other Bedouin establishments in Dahab.\nIt is almost impossible to get rolling tobacco in Dahab, be prepared if you are not keen on factory made ones.\nGhazala Market. If your stay extends with or without intention your shopping behaviour will focus on this market. Here you can find anything you need to update your on-the-road-equipment from functional to convenient. For local fare and much cheaper fruit and veg, go to Assalah shopping area (5 min taxi, or walk to Eel Garden then head into town). (updated Mar 2020)\nDahab Community Market (Sheikh Salem House near Eel Garden). Every F 3PM-7PM. You will find hand-made Bedouin and Egyptian crafts, jewelry, clothes, second hand bargains, foods from around the world including homemade Egyptian food, cakes and desserts. (updated Mar 2020)\n\n## Eat\nThe trick to eating cheaply in Dahab is to avoid seafront establishments and go a block or two inland, where prices are half for equivalent quality. Lots of budget places in the back lanes serve falafel, koshari, chicken and fish. For fish, the prices shown are usually per kilo not per fish. Try bargaining.\nAli Baba Hotel has a good restaurant, see \"Sleep\".\nHell's Kitchen, Lighthouse Rd (Hidden in alley between bridge and the big supermarket), ☏ +20 102 292 4824. M-Sa 4PM-10PM.

You can also buy beer, wine and liquor in special shops called Drinkies. One is located at Azzahla market square, another in Mashraba in the small road after Sea Bride fish restaurant.\nSome Egyptian alcohol brands mimics the names and labelling of better known liquors elsewhere.

Chris the Aussie barman is always on hand until the sun comes up serving a variety of alcoholics including the drunken Welshman and unconfrontational Dave the Canadian nice man.\nThe Furry Cup, at the Blue Beach Hotel, where local Westerners hang out at the sound of U2, Coldplay, etc. The only place in Dahab where you can get Western hard liquor brands instead of the fakes.\n\n## Sleep\nDahab has lots of budget to mid-range accommodation and lacks upmarket places. Prices are low by western standards and even lower once you go 100 m back from the beach strip.\n\n## Budget\n28.4929534.5158611 Charlie's House, Lighthouse Rd, ☏ +20 1225745034, nileraptor_51@yahoo.com.

(updated Mar 2020)\n\n## Stay safe\nSee the warning in the Sinai and Egypt articles for information about the security situation in Dahab.\nWomen travellers are safe in Dahab, but please be savvy:\nSnorkeling along the reef can be hazardous if the wind gets up. Waves may dash you onto the sharp coral, the current may carry you past your exit point, and in a rising sea you may have difficulty spotting the next safe exit. Other water users have more escape options, eg divers can re-descend to pick out a route inshore.\nDrugs, particularly marijuana, are widely available in Dahab but not legal. You would risk large fines and maybe a lengthy stay in one of Egypt's notoriously squalid prisons.\nChild beggars: If you signed up for a group activity, like snorkeling along the coast or going for a tour into the desert, you will likely encounter child beggars. They usually are in a group of 5, boys and girls and will try to sell you bracelets. They are very instistive from the beginning and if you look at them, talk to them or buy from them, their style will get even more aggressive and pushy and would be somewhat shocking.\n\n## Go next\nAlong the coast to the south, Sharm el Sheikh will feel very busy and tourist-trappy after Dahab. Going north, Nuweiba and Taba are little developed.\nCrossing into Israel, Eilat is a brash building site. Just use it as a base or for its airport, or head swiftly on towards Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, or Jordan. Bear in mind that Israel does not stamp your passport but the Egyptian border post at Taba does, so it will be obvious from the exit stamp that you crossed into Israel.\nAqaba in Jordan is more conveniently reached by ferry from Nuweiba. It has great diving and is within an hour's drive of fabulous Petra.\nCairo and raffish Alexandria deserve several days to explore.\nLuxor until 2019 involved travelling via Cairo, but will become more accessible if the Sharm-Hurghada ferry restarts in 2020.\nPilgrims to Medina and Mecca can reach them by ferry from Nuweiba (horribly congested for Hajj, quieter for Umrah at other times). Your Saudi Arabian visa needs sorting well in advance.",

          "content": "Hurghada (; Arabic: الغردقة al-Ġhardaqah, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [el ɣæɾˈdæʔæ]) is a coastal city that serves as the largest city and capital of the Red Sea Governorate of Egypt. Hurghada has grown from a small fishing village to one of the largest resort destinations along the Red Sea coast, stretching close to 40 km.\nThe city is bordered to the north by Ras Gharib, to the south by Safaga, to the east by the Red Sea coast, and to the west by the Red Sea Mountains. The city's nearest airport is Hurghada International Airport. Hurghada contains the islands of Giftun, Umm Qamar, Magawish, Abu Ramada, Abu Minqar, Fanadir, and Shadwan. The Hurghada metropolitan area is home to famous resort cities and towns that include El Gouna, Sahl Hasheesh, Soma Bay, and Makadi Bay. Its main districts are El Dahar, El Saqqala, and El Ahyaa.\nThe city by itself is famous for its luxurious and large hotels. As of 2024, Hurghada attracts over 9 million visitors annually, making it one of the most visited cities in Egypt and consistently ranking among the world's top tourist destinations and the third best nature destination in the world.\n\nEtymology\nThe city's name is derived from the Arabic name of the Nitraria plant (Arabic: غردق, romanized: ghardaq). The English Hurghada comes from gharqad (Arabic: غرقد), a variant of the same name. The tree is mentioned in a hadith, where it is called the \"tree of the Jews\".\n\nOverview\nHurghada was founded in the early 20th century. For many decades it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea resort as a result of Egyptian and foreign investment that began in the 1980s. Holiday resorts and hotels provide facilities for windsurfing, kitesurfing, yachting, scuba diving and snorkeling. The city is known for its watersports, nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around 35 °C (95 °F) most of the year, and during July and August temperatures can reach over 46 °C (115 °F). Hurghada is a popular holiday destination for Europeans, especially during the winter, and some spend Christmas and New Year there.\nIn recent years, Hurghada has also become a gateway for day trips and excursions to destinations such as Luxor and Cairo offered by various local tour operators.\nHurghada extends for about 36 kilometres (22 mi) along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from Cairo, the Delta and Upper Egypt, as well as package holiday tourists from Europe.\nMany of Hurghada's newer hotels, restaurants, and shops are located along El Mamsha. Most of the largest hotel resorts are located in the area between Mamsha and Sahl Hasheesh on El Mamsha. Beyond Sahl Hasheesh there are the hotels of Makadi Bay. Dahar is considered the oldest part of the town, where the traditional bazaar, post office and long-distance bus stations (Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus) are situated. Sakala could be considered older because, it was the place where Hurghada was established by Ababda fishermen and where they settled along a natural harbor. The busiest area is also Sakala, the city center on Sheraton Road lined with hotels, shops and restaurants.\n\nHistory\nThe Egyptian Red Sea coast has been inhabited since antiquity, with the  area of Hurghada being occupied since the 4th century, when the ancient settlement of Abu Sha’ar (Arabic: ابو شعر), located 20 km north of the modern city, was established. Originally founded as a Roman military fort for Ala Nova Maximiana unit between 309-311, it was transformed into a Christian community around 400. The Christians repurposed the fort into a church, leaving behind inscriptions, graffiti, and artifacts such as a 5th-century papyrus and a tapestry with a cross. The settlement declined after either the Sasanian or Arab conquest of Egypt.\nThe modern city Hurghada was established in 1905 as a fishing village by Ababda fishermen along a natural harbor. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913 by Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd. During the reign of King Farouk a recreational center was built in the city, but after President Nasser's nationalization of Egypt's industries it was reallocated to the Egyptian Armed Forces.\nDuring the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt (1967–70), Shadwan Island in the Red Sea to the east of the city was fortified by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970 the island was the site of Operation Rhodes, a helicopter assault by Israeli troops who occupied it for 36 hours.\nDuring the October War of 1973, Hurghada harbor was the target of four Israeli operations.\nIn September 1994, drive-by shooters killed two Egyptians and a German tourist; another German man was wounded in the attack and died of his injuries after returning to Germany.\nIn 2016, a terrorist attack in Hurghada, inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State, wounded three tourists. In another terrorist attack in Hurghada in 2017, a man declared that he wanted to kill only non-Egyptians, and stabbed seven female tourists. Two German women and one Czech woman were killed in the attack, which took place at two separate resort hotels.\n\nTourism\nHurghada's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism thanks to its year-round hot and dry climate and long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year, making Hurghada a popular destination for underwater diving and snorkelling. Al Mina Mosque with two 40-metre-high minarets is the largest mosque in the Red Sea Governorate.

          "title": "الغردقة",
          "content": "الغردقة هي العاصمة الإدارية لمحافظة البحر الأحمر، وتشغل مساحة 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للشاطئ الغربي للبحر الأحمر. يحدها شمالاً مدينة رأس غارب وجنوباً مدينة سفاجا وشرقاً ساحل البحر الأحمر وغرباً جبال البحر الأحمر. وتقع بها جزر الجفتون وأم قمر ومجاويش وأبو رمادة وأبو منقار والفنادير وشدوان، ومن أشهر منتجعاتها الجونة وسهل حشيش وسوما باي ومكادي باي، وتتمثل أحيائها الرئيسية في حي الدهار وحي السقالة وحي الأحياء.\n\nالتسمية\nاسم المدينة الأصلي «هرغادة» نسبة إلى منطقة صحراوية تعرف باسم «ديشة هرغادة». وهناك رأي آخر يقول بأن الاسم يعود إلى نبات يسمى «الغردق» وهو ما يعرف باسم «عنب الديب» أو «فيروز الشطآن» وهو نبات ينمو طبيعياً منذ القدم. وكان الصيادين من قبائل جهينة والرشايدة والمعازة يصطادون في المنطقة ما بين الحجاز وساحل البحر الأحمر، ويتقابلون عند شجرة كبيرة لنبات «الغردق» ومكانها الحالي ميناء الغردقة البحري، ثم تطور الاسم إلى الغردقة.\n\nالتاريخ\nنشأت مدينة الغردقة عام 1905، لم تضم المدينة قديمًا إلا مجموعة من المنازل البدائية التي يسكنها البدو، والذين تمركزوا بصفة أساسية في منطقة السقالة للعمل بصيد الأسماك واللؤلؤ، مما أكسب المدينة طابع بدوي مستمر معها حتى الآن. وفي عهد الملك فاروق تم تشييد استراحة استجمامية تحولت بعد التأميم في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر إلى مبنى نادي القوات المسلحة للرياضات المائية والذي يعد مزاراً سياحياً حتى الآن. واكتشف البترول في تلك المنطقة عام 1913 وبدأ الإنتاج الفعلي له وتصديره عام 1921، وكانت «شركة آبار الزيوت الإنجليزية المصرية المحدودة» من أوائل الشركات التي بدأت في إنتاج النفط بهذه المنطقة. وفي مطلع 1970 أغارت القوات الإسرائيلية على جزيرة شدوان وتصدت لها القوات المسلحة المصرية بمساعدة أهالي الغردقة، فيما يعرف بمعركة شدوان وهو التاريخ الذي تحتفل فيه محافظة البحر الأحمر بعيدها القومي.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nتقع مدينة الغردقة على الشاطئ الغربي للبحر الأحمر على خط طول 48' 33° شرقاً وخط عرض 15' 27° شمالاً، وتتبع إدارياً محافظة البحر الأحمر، وهي عاصمة المحافظة. ويحدها شمالاً مدينة رأس غارب بمسافة 143 كم، وجنوباً مدينة سفاجا بمسافة 61 كم، وتطل على ساحل البحر الأحمر من جهة الشرق، وغرباً على جبال البحر الأحمر، وتغطي شواطئها مساحة 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للبحر الأحمر، وتبلغ مساحتها الكلية 460.5 كم وتعد المدينة الرابعة في الترتيب من حيث المساحة بين مدن محافظة البحر الأحمر بعد مدن رأس غارب وسفاجا والقصير. وتمتد الكتلة العمرانية للمدينة على الطريق الساحلي الموازي لساحل البحر الأحمر في مسافة تقدر بـ 23 كم، بينما لا يزيد امتدادها للداخل عن 3.6 كم. تمتد مدينة الغردقة القديمة (الدهار) في شريط طولي، ينحصر بين هضبتين جيريتين، إحداهما في الشرق بين المدينة القديمة والساحل، والأخرى في الغرب. لذلك تقع مدينة الغردقة في سهل ساحلي يتباين اتساعه من منطقة لأخرى، ويتراوح عرضه ما بين 8 إلى 35 كم. ويظهر بذلك تعدد أنماط النسيج العمراني للمدينة، فيتركز النسيج التلقائي والشبكي في نواة المدينة حيث عشوائية العمران، والذي يتسم بالمباني الرديئة والمتوسطة المتلاحم معظمها، علاوة على ضيق وتعرج الطرق والشوارع التي يتراوح عرضها ما بين 3 إلى 6 أمتار تقريباً. أما النسيج الشبكي والشريطي المنظم فيسود في الامتدادات العمرانية المستحدثة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nحي الدهار: يعتبر المنطقة الشعبية بالمدينة ومركزها القديم، حيث يبرز الحياة المصرية التقليدية الممزوجة بالطابع البدوي، كما أنه يحتوي على الأسواق الشعبية والمحلات التجارية وسوق السمك، والطرق السياحية مثل طريق الممشى وطريق الهضبة وطريق المطار وطريق الشيراتون.\nحي السقالة: يزين هذا الحي مكان الميناء القديم، ويمثل الرقعة السياحية بالمدينة، حيث يقع به العديد من الفنادق والمحلات ومراكز التسوق والنوادي والمطاعم والتي تظل مفتوحة للجماهير والسياح إلى بعد منتصف الليل.\nحي الأحياء: هو حي جديد من المتوقع له أن يكون من أهم الأحياء السياحية في المستقبل، لاحتوائه على أكثر من منتجع سياحي تحت التأسيس.\nالجزر: تضم المدينة العديد من الجزر العامرة المنتجعات السياحية أو التي تستخدم كمواقع للغطس مثل الجونة، سهل حشيش، مجاويش، أبو منقارة، أبو رمادة، الجفتون، شدوان.\nالعشوائيات: يعيش نحو 30% من سكان المدينة في مناطق عشوائية تحاول الدولة تطويرها وهي: زرزارة، جبل العفش، الملاحة، العنبر، نجع البورة، المحجر، الشيخ محمود، الصيادين، العرب، خلف الأوتوبيس والكهف.\n\nالمناخ\nتتمتع الغردقة بدرجة حرارة معتدلة طوال العام، فمناخها الصحراوي الجاف يؤدي إلى اختلافات كبيرة في درجات الحرارة بين النهار والليل، حيث يكون الجو حار نهاراً وبارد ليلاً خاصة خلال أشهر الشتاء، وتصل أقصى درجات البرودة إلى 18 درجة مئوية وتبلغ ذروتها عند 42 درجة مئوية.\n\nالسكان\nتضاعف عدد سكان الغردقة بسبب الاستثمارات من 20 ألف إلى 90 ألف نسمة، ويزيد على ذلك حوالي 40 ألف شخص من العاملين القادمين من خارج المدينة للعمل بمجال السياحة. ويعود أصل سكان المدينة إلى قبائل جهينة والرشايدة والمعازة، ويتحدث معظمهم اللهجة الخليطة بين اللهجة البدوية واللهجة المصرية. ويقطن غالبية السكان مركز الغردقة القديم بحي الدهار.\n\nالمعالم الطبيعية والسياحية\nتغطي مدينة الغردقة مساحة 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للبحر الأحمر وتمتاز بشمسها الساطعة على مدار العام وشعابها المرجانية الرائعة، بالإضافة إلى عشرات من مواقع الجذب الممتعة التي يتجه إليها السائحين للاسترخاء والراحة لما تتمتع به المدينة من عوامل جذب منها درجة الحرارة المعتدلة طوال العام، ومناخها الصحراوي الجاف واشتمالها على أدوات المرح الشاطئية والرياضات المائية الممتعة والنوادي وملاعب الجولف. كما تزخر بالعديد من الجزر والمواقع البحرية التي تعتبر قبلة لهواة الغطس والرياضات المائية ومنها شعاب بليندا وشعاب أبو قطرة وشعاب أبو نحاس وشعاب أم العش وشعاب أم قمر وشعاب العروف وشعاب طويلة وأبو نقاد وسيول.\n\nسوما باي\nانضم منتجع سوما باي أو خليج أبو سوما إلى حيز مدينة الغردقة في أبريل 2015. وهو عبارة عن مجتمع سياحي يقع على بعد 60 كم من الطرف الشمالي لمدينة الغردقة، يمتد المنتجع على مساحة 13 مليون متر ليكوِّن خليجاً بديع القسمات مغلف بجمال الطبيعة العذراء. يتمتع المنتجع بالاكتفاء الذاتي وبتخطيط عمراني ومعماري ونوعية خدمات تندمج مع ماهية المكان المحيط به بلمسة أوروبية في شكل فنادق وفيلات وأماكن للرياضة والاستشفاء والترويح يمتلكها رجال أعمال مصريين وعرب. ويضم المنتجع ثلاثة مواقع رئيسية هي «شيراتون» و«لاريزيدانس دي كاسادس» و«نادي روبينسون» بالإضافة إلى نادي لممارسة رياضة الجولف.\n\nمكادي باي\nانضم منتجع مكادي باي أو خليج مكادي إلى حيز مدينة الغردقة في أبريل 2015. ويقع على بعد 35 كم جنوب وسط مدينة الغردقة. يتمتع المنتجع بشمس ساطعة على مدار العام وشواطئ ممتدة من مياه البحر الصافية والرمال البيضاء الطبيعية، وهو أحد منتجعات الغردقة المثالية لقضاء العطلات وخوض الرحلات البحرية حيث تتراوح درجات الحرارة في المنتجع ما بين 15 إلى 23 درجة مئوية في شهور الشتاء، وبين 23 درجة إلى 34 درجة في شهور الصيف والربيع. وتم تصميم المنتجع لتلبية احتياجات السائحين المختلفة، حيث يضم مجموعة من الفنادق والمطاعم والاستراحات الفاخرة التي تعمل على تقديم خدمة عالمية تتضمن مجموعة منتقاة من المأكولات الآسيوية والفرنسية والإيطالية واليابانية.\n\nكارلوس\nتعد شعاب كارلوس رييف أحد أجمل مواقع الغطس في الغردقة، بفضل الغابات المرجانية الكثيفة الموجودة بها وأصناف الأسماك المتنوعة بمياهها مثل قرش المطرقة النادر وأسماك الجاك والتونة والبركودة وأسماك المواري العملاقة وغيرها. وتتكون شعاب تلك المنطقة من برجين مرجانيين يزيّنان سطح الماء. ويبلغ عمق الوادي بين هذين البرجين حوالي 16 متر، وأكثر من 40 متر في المياه، مما جعلها منطقة مناسبة للغطاسين الهواة والمتمرسين.\n\nأبو رمادا\nيحمل هذا الموقع أيضاً اسم «حوض الأسماك المائي»، ويتميز بمياهه الضحلة نسبياً والمسطحة إلى حد كبير، ويعج بالحياة البحرية المذهلة والمتنوعة حيث تكثر فيه أسماك الشعاب الصغيرة وسمك الراي اللاسع وقرش النمر، بالإضافة إلى أسماك الجاك والبركودة وقرش الشعاب المرجانية ذو الزعنفة البيضاء والتونة الصغيرة بأعداد كبيرة.\n\nالفنادير\nالفنادير عبارة عن شعاب ضيقة وطويلة وهادئة تقع في شمال الغردقة ويمكن الوصول إليها من الجونة. وتتميز بإمكانية ممارسة أي نوع من أنواع الغوص فيها بما في ذلك الغوص الانجرافي والغوص العميق وغوص المبتدئين، ويفضل الغواصون الجانب الشرقي من الفنادير لأنه محمي من الطقس عن طريق قوس رقيق من الشعاب المرجانية وبه الأجزاء الضحلة من الشعاب المرجانية حيث تزخر الحياة البحرية بالسمك الأنبوبي (أبو زمارة) والسمك الحجري وسمك عقرب البحر وسمك الخرمان وسمك الضفادع وسمك قرش الجيتار والسمك المفلطح وسمك أبو مطرقة وسمك التونة وسمك الجاك.\n\nسهل حشيش\nتبلغ مساحة منتجع سهل حشيش 32 مليون متر وتقوم على إدارته الشركة المصرية للمنتجعات السياحية والتي قامت بتخطيطه على 3 مراحل بواقع 6 ملايين متر للمرحلة الأولى و6 ملايين متر للثانية و20 مليون متر للمرحلة الثالثة. ويشتمل المنتجع على 1560 غرفة فندقية و679 وحدة سكنية فيما ينتظر افتتاح 6 آلاف غرفة فندقية و6 آلاف وحدة سكنية إضافية تتضمنها مشروعات مستقبلية. كما يتضمن أيضاً مسرحاً مكشوفاً يشتهر بالحفلات الغنائية الضخمة التي يقيمها كبار المطربين العرب ويحضرها الآلاف من معجبيهم.\n\nالجونة\nتعود نشأة الجونة إلى عام 1990، حيث طورتها شركة أوراسكوم للفنادق والتنمية على مجموعة من الجزر كأحد المنتجعات السياحية الواقعة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وتبعد عن مطار الغردقة الدولي 22 كم إلى الشمال، ويفصلها عن القاهرة مسافة 470 كم. وتتجه الجونة إلى تحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي من الغذاء عن طريق الاعتماد بشكل كبير على منتجات مزرعة الجونة المقامة على مساحة 120 فدان، والتي توفر احتياجات المنتجع من الخضراوات والفاكهة واللحوم والدواجن والأسماك بدون استخدام مبيدات. وتشتهر المنطقة بكونها موقعا للغطس في الأعماق والرياضات المائية المختلفة، ويوجد بها شاطئان رئيسيان هما «زيتونة بيتش» و«مانجروفي بيتش»، ويتخلل المنتجع عدد كبير من القنوات المائية، ويوجد به 6 أحياء هي «حي مارينا تاون»، «الحي المتوسطي»، «حي الجولف»، «الحي النوبي»، «حي الهضبة»، و«الحي الإيطالي». كما تتجه جميع الاستثمارات بالمنتجع إلى الاعتماد على الطاقة الشمسية النظيفة والاستغناء عن الكهرباء المولدة من الحكومة بالكامل، وذلك عن طريق تخزين البطاريات للطاقة المولدة من الخلايا الشمسية. ويعتبر المنتج النموذج المثالي لممارسة رياضات الجولف والغوص والتزلج على الماء وركوب الأمواج والطائرات الورقية، كما يتمتع بالعديد من النوادي الصحية والفنادق ذات الخمسة نجوم، فضلاً عن المناظر الطبيعية الخلابة والطقس الممتع طوال العام.\n\nمتنفس الصحراء\nهو عبارة عن تحفة فنية تم بنائها في 7 مارس 1997 في صحراء الجونة، عن طريق مجموعة «D.A.ST. Arteam» التي تتكون من ثلاثة فنانين هم النحات «داناي ستراتو» والمصمم الصناعي «الكسندرا ستراتو» والمهندسة المعمارية «ستيلا قنسطنطينيدس». وهي عباره عن 89 من الكثبان الرملية المخروطية المرتفعة عن الأرض و89 من الحفر المنخفضة الحلزونية المزدوج متفاوتة الحجم وتتوسطها بحيرة قطرها 30 متر، وتقع هذه القطعة الفنية على مساحة حوالي 100 ألف متر.\n\nمجاویش\nتقع جزيرة مجاويش على بعد 7.5 كم جنوب شرق الغردقة، وتمتلك نحو كيلومترين من الشواطئ ذات الرمال الناعمة التي تحتضن مياه البحر الأحمر البكر ذات الأمواج الهادئة. وبها تقع قرية مجاويش السياحية التابعة لشركة مصر للسياحة، التي تمتد على مساحة 850 ألف متر منها 450 ألف متر غير مستغلة، وتعد أكبر قرى الغردقة وأقدمها حيث افتتحها الرئيس الراحل أنور السادات في عام 1979 في عهد وزير السياحة والطيران المدني جمال الناظر، ومحافظ البحر الأحمر علي عفيفي. ويقدم المنتجع العديد من الأنشطة السياحية والترفيهية كالغطس وركوب الأمواج والخيل، وتصنف القرية في فئة «أربعة نجوم» وتشتمل على 425 غرفة مقسمة إلى شاليهات، بالإضافة إلى مبنى فندقي وفيلات فاخرة تمتد على طول الشاطئ الرملي الذي يبلغ طوله 1.2 كم ويعد الأطول في مدينة الغردقة، ويعمل بالقرية نحو 460 فرد تحت إدارة مصرية خالصة.\n\nالجفتون\nتقع جزيرة الجفتون على بعد 11 كم من شواطئ مدينة الغردقة، وتبلغ مساحتها أكثر من 17 كم، وتعد الجزيرة الأكثر رواجاً سياحياً داخل نطاق مدينة الغردقة لما تمتلكه من شواطئ من طراز خاص، يفد إليها العشرات من السائحين يومياً لقضاء يوماً وسط البحر الأحمر. وتعد أهم أماكن الغوص في الأعماق والغوص السطحي بمدينة الغردقة ويستخدمها نسبة تزيد على 30% من ممارسي هذه الرياضة والنزلاء بفنادقها. كما تعتبر من أهم موارد الدخل لمحميات البحر الأحمر، وتلعب دوراً رئيسياً في النمو السياحي والاستثماري بمدينة الغردقة نظراً لأنها الجزيرة الوحيدة التي يسمح بنزول السياح عليها. يغلب على الطبيعة الجيولوجية للجزيرة الارتفاع في نصفها الشمالي، حيث توجد سلسلة من التلال يبلغ منسوب أعلاها 119 متر فوق مستوى سطح البحر تمتد من الشمال حتى منتصف الجزيرة. أما الجزء الجنوبي للجزيرة فهو عبارة عن هضبة من الصخور المرجانية يتراوح منسوبها من 3 إلى 6 أمتار ويحيط بسواحلها الشعاب المرجانية الساحلية، وتمتد إلى الغرب حتى جزيرة أبو منقار وإلى الجنوب حتى جزيرة جفتون الصغيرة، والمياه فيما بين الجزر والساحل المقابل هي مياه ضحله لا يزيد عمقها على 20 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر، بينما يتعمق القاع إلى الشرق منها، فيتراوح العمق بين 300 إلى 500 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. وتتكون صخورها من الصخور الرسوبية حيث يصل سمك الرواسب بها إلى حوالي 120 متر، والتي تتكون معظمها من صخور الحجر الجيري الرملي والشعب المرجانية التي تنتمي إلى عصر البليوسين. وتمثل الجزيرة محمية طبيعية تعد من أهم الأماكن التي تحتوي على أنظمة بيئية حساسة تتضمن الحشائش البحرية وتتميز بكساء وتنوع مرتفع للشعاب المرجانية يتراوح بين 60% إلى 90% في الأماكن المميزة، ويقطنها أعداد كبيرة من الحيوانات البحرية والطيور التي يعتبر بعضها مهدد بالانقراض مثل العقاب النسارية والنوارس ذات العيون البيضاء (العجمة)، والتي تقوم بالتعشيش على الجزيرة، كما يوجد في المنطقة الشمالية والشرقية منها أماكن تعشيش السلاحف وعلى الأخص السلحفاة صقرية المنقار.\n\nجزيرة أبو منقار\nتنتمي جزيرة أبو منقار إلى عصر الإيوسين، مما يشير إلى أن عمرها لا يقل عن 33 مليون سنة، وتتميز الجزيرة بكثافة الصخور والتركيبات الجيولوجية النادرة بها. ويعود تسمية الجزيرة إلى شكلها العام حيث يشكل طرفها الشرقي لسان رملي يمتد داخل البحر بشكل متعرج يشبه إلى حد كبير منقار الطير. وعلى رغم صغر حجمها النسبي، إلا أنها تعد من أهم جزر شمال البحر الأحمر، لأهميتها البيئية نتيجة غناها بالشعاب المرجانية والمانجروف. كما تستغل مناطق كثيرة منها في أنشطة الغوص والسياحة والصيد، فضلاً عن كونها محطة استراحة وتوالد لأنواع عديدة من الطيور المهاجرة مثل النورس البحري ومالك الحزين وخطاف البحر والطائر الشماط. تقع الجزيرة على مساحة 140 هكتاراً وتبعد عن مدينة الغردقة ثلاثة كيلومترات شرقاً، وتتشكل من أرض منبسطة من الشعاب المرجانية المتحفرة، سواحلها الغربية والشمالية رؤوس صخرية بارزة وخلجان رملية صغيرة، وساحلها الجنوبي الشرقي شاطئ رملي منبسط خالي من التعرجات. وهي ضمن حدود محمية علبة البحرية التي تضم منطقة جبل علبة في جنوب شرق مصر إضافة إلى جميع الجزر الواقعة في القطاع المصري من البحر الأحمر. وتعد الجزيرة من أكثر جزر البحر الأحمر ثراءً بأشجار المانجروف، حيث تزيد نسبة الغطاء النباتي الذي تحتله هذه الأشجار والنباتات الملحية الأخرى عن ربع إجمالي مساحة الجزيرة على مساحة تقدر بنحو 30 هكتاراً، حيث يمكن أن يحوي الهكتار الواحد ما لا يقل عن 400 شجرة كاملة، ويصل طول بعض تلك الأشجار إلى أكثر من خمسة أمتار، وأحياناً تتخلل هذه الأشجار أو تحيط بها أنواع أخرى من النباتات المقاومة للملوحة مثل الغردق والرطريط والخريسة والسويدة والمليح وغيرها من النباتات التي تميز بيئة السبخات الملحية. وتنمو أشجار المانجروف على الجزيرة خلال خور مائي كبير يمتد عبر الجزيرة ويتفرع في أكثر من اتجاه، مشكلاً مع أيكات المانجروف الممتدة على جنباته لوحة بحرية جميلة يندر وجودها في أي جزيرة أخرى. وتتميز أشجار المانجروف في تلك البقعة بوجودها في جزيرة منعزلة، بعيداً عن ضغوط الزحف العمراني والرعي الجائر والملوثات البشرية مما يسهم في زيادة كثافة المانجروف ونمائه المستمر وطوله الوارف.\n\nجزيرة شدوان\nجزيرة شدوان هي أكبر جزيرة شعاب مرجانية في مضيق جوبال، وتعرف أيضاً باسم «جزيرة شاكر». تضم الجزيرة في الجزء الشمالي منها جدار من الشعاب المرجانية شبه عمودي الشكل على عمق أكثر من 40 متر والذي يصل إليه الغواصين لاستكشافه عن طريق الغطس الانجرافي مع التيار المعتدل المتجه من الجنوب إلى الشمال. وتزخر تلك الشعاب المرجانية بسمك المرجان وسمك المروحة وسمك قرش الشعاب المرجانية ذو الزعنفة البيضاء وسمك قرش الشعاب المرجانية ذو الزعنفة الرمادية وسلاحف صقرية المنقار، بالإضافة إلى أسراب الدلافين الرائعة.\n\nمعالم إسلامية\nتم افتتاح مسجد الميناء في يناير 2012 أثناء احتفالات محافظة البحر الأحمر بعيدها القومي، وأقيم على مساحة 4 آلاف متر بتكلفة إجمالية 20 مليون جنيه بالجهود الذاتية من المستثمرين والمواطنين وبدعم من محافظة البحر الأحمر ووزارة الأوقاف. ويعتبر المسجد من أكبر مساجد المحافظة، ويتميز بطراز معماري فريد يؤهله لأن يصبح مزاراً سياحياً. وتم تخطيط المنطقة المحيطة به لتصبح ساحة حضارية، ونقلت ورش إصلاح المراكب واللنشات حوله إلى ترسانة إصلاح العائمات بمدينة سفاجا. كما تضم المدينة أيضاً ضريح أبى الحسن الشاذلي وهو أحد المساجد التي أنشأت في عصر الدولة الأيوبية في مصر. ويتكون الضريح من مبنى مثمن الشكل بكل ضلع من أضلاعه نافذة واحدة مستطيلة والثانية على شكل قماري، أما الضلع الثامن فيوجد به مدخل الضريح.\n\nمعالم قبطية\nتضم الغردقة عدة معالم قبطية شهيرة تتمثل في دير الأنبا أنطونيوس وهو أول دير أنشئ في العالم وينسب اسمه إلى الأنبا أنطونيوس الذي يعتبره الأقباط المصريون أول الرهبان في العالم، وأب جميع الرهبان. تعود نشأة الدير إلى القرن الرابع الميلادي ويعد واحداً من أهم وأقدم الأديرة الأثرية على مستوى العالم حيث يقع عند سفح جبل الجلالة القبلية جنوب السويس بنحو 170 كم، ويحتوي على مجموعة من أندر الجداريات القبطية وأروعها كما يحتوي على مكتبة كبيرة تحتوي على 1438 مخطوطاً إلى جانب مئات الكتب المطبوعة في مختلف فروع المعرفة. كما تضم الغردقة دير الأنبا بولا أو دير سانت بولا الواقع بالصحراء الشرقية جنوب شرق دير الأنبا أنطونيوس، ويبتدئ طريق الدير حوالي 25 كم متفرعاً من طريق الزعفرانة الرئيسي، وممتداً إلى الغرب مسافة 12,5 كم. ويوجد بالدير أربع كنائس أثرية هي: الكنيسة الأثرية التي كان يسكنها الأنبا بولا لمدة 70 سنة، وكنيسة أبو سفين التي أعاد بنائها المعلم الجوهري في أواخر القرن الثامن الميلادي، وكنيسة الملاك وبها اثني عشر قبة كعدد تلاميذ يسوع ويرجع تاريخها إلى سنة 1777. وفي فبراير 2014 تم افتتاح مبنى خاص بزوار الدير في عهد البابا تواضروس الثاني وتضم المدينة أيضاً كاتدرائية الأنبا شنودة الواقعة بحي الدهار على مساحة 860 متر تقريباً، وتم إنشائها في عام 1926، وكنيسة العذراء والملاك ميخائيل المقامة على الطراز الحديث بالجونة شمال مدينة الغردقة وتسع 1500 مصل، ودير مارمينا غرب مدينة الغردقة الذي يقع على مساحة 1500 متر، وكنيسة مارمرقس بحي الأحياء المقامة على مساحة 350 متر.\n\nوادي الحمامات\nوادي الحمامات أو وادي الينابيع أو أم الفواخير، هو عبارة عن قاع نهر جاف أصبح طريقاً متعرجاً عبر جبال الصحراء الشرقية، ويقع على بعد 235 كم من مدينة الغردقة، وكان يستخدم كطريق تجاري في العصور القديمة، وهي منطقة مُحاطة بمقالع حجارة البخن المعروفة بالجرايوكي ومناجم الذهب التي تمت الاستفادة منها منذ عصر المملكة القديمة وحتى العصر الروماني. وتتمثل المزارات السياحية بالمنطقة في علامات المقالع على الجانب الشمالي من الطريق، حيث يظهر ما تبقى من أكواخ العمال القدماء. وعلى الجانب الجنوبي من الطريق، يوجد المئات من الألواح الهيروغليفية التي تُعد دليلاً على البعثات والمهام الكثيرة التي توجهت إلى وادي الحمامات وكان يقودها الفراعنة.\n\nالأكواريم\nجراند أكواريم هو متحف يسلط الضوء على الحياة البحرية بمدينة الغردقة وتم افتتاحه في يناير 2015، ليعرض مجموعه كبيرة من الكائنات البحرية، مع إتاحة التواصل معها والتعرف عليها عن قرب، حيث يحتوي على أكثر من 22 حوض من أكبر أحواض الأسماك حجماً، وبه نفق زجاجي بطول 22 متراً، يمنح المارين به محاكاة طبيعية للحياة البحرية خلال التجول تحت الماء من داخله. يتكون مشروع المتحف من ثلاث مراحل، تم افتتاح المرحلة الأولى بطاقة استيعابية تصل لأكثر من مليون جالون مياه ليكون الأكواريم السابع عالمياً من حيث كمية المياه، ومع انتهاء المرحلة الثانية تصل كمية المياه به إلى 3.8 مليون جالون من المياه، وبذلك يصبح الثالث عالمياً، ومع المرحلة الأخيرة والثالثة يصبح «الأكواريم» الأول عالمياً بكمية مياه 8.8 مليون جالون. وشارك في تنفيذ المشروع العديد من الخبراء من أكثر من 5 دول مختلفة منها انجلترا، وألمانيا وماليزيا، والصين، بالإضافة إلى خبراء مصريين. يقع المشروع على مساحة 22 ألف متر تقريباً، بالإضافة إلى ساحة انتظار تقدر بحوالي 20 ألف متر، ويبعد عن مطار الغردقة الدولي بضع دقائق.\n\nالمعهد القومي لعلوم البحار\nتم بناء المعهد القومي لعلوم البحار والمصايد في عام 1927 وافتتح رسمياً في العام التالي تحت اسم «محطة الأحياء البحرية» كأحد المنشآت التابعة لجامعة فؤاد الأول (القاهرة حالياً)، وتحول اسمه عام 1992 إلى المعهد القومي لعلوم البحار والمصايد ليصبح تابعاً لوزارة البحث العلمي. وللمعهد ثلاثة أفرع أخرى في الإسكندرية وخليج العقبة والقناطر يهتم كل منها بما له علاقة بعلوم البحار والبيئة البحرية. ويعد المعهد من أقدم المعاهد المتخصصة في مجال علوم البحار في الشرق الأوسط، وجاء اختيار منطقة شمال الغردقة كموقع للمعهد لبعدها عن العمران ولتوفر الشعاب المرجانية والبيئة البحرية النموذجية. ويحتوي المتحف على العديد من الأسماك المحنطة من بيئة البحر الأحمر والمحيط الهندي ومنها عروس البحر والدلافين والقروش والسلاحف وغيرها من الأسماك. ويضم الأكواريوم أو حوض السمك الموجود بالمعهد ستة وعشرين حوض زجاج لعرض الأسماك الحية وخاصة أسماك الشعاب المرجانية. ويشمل المعهد إثني عشر معمل أبحاث تغطي تخصصات عديدة في مجال علوم البحار. ويضم المتحف سفينة أبحاث تحمل اسم حامد جوهر تخليداً لذكرى العالم المصري الدكتور حامد عبد الفتاح جوهر، وهي تقوم برحلات بحرية داخل محافظة البحر الأحمر لتجميع العينات وإجراء الأبحاث العلمية، فيما تعتبر مكتبة المعهد من أقدم المكتبات العلمية المتخصصة في مجال البيئة البحرية والمصايد في الشرق الأوسط وتحتوي على العديد من الكتب والمراجع والخرائط العلمية ذات القيمة الكبيرة. كما يعمل المعهد على حل مشاكل البيئة البحرية المحيطة مثل مشكلة نجم البحر الشوكي وعمل تقارير التقييم البيئي للمشروعات السياحية على ساحل البحر الأحمر وفض المنازعات في المشاكل التي تمس البيئة البحرية بين جهاز شئون البيئة وأصحاب المنشآت السياحية.\n\nمتحف الغردقة\nافتتح المتحف في 29 فبراير 2020 كأول متحف آثار مصري بالشراكة مع القطاع الخاص بتكلفة بلغت قرابة 160 مليون جنيه. تبلغ مساحة المتحف قرابة 10 آلاف متر بينها 3 آلاف متر مساحة قاعة العرض المتحفي الخاصة بالقطع الأثرية، والتي تضم 2000 قطعة أثرية من عصور مختلفة، فرعونية ورومانية وقبطية وإسلامية، وقطع أثرية تعود لأسرة محمد على.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالسياحة\nنظراً لطبيعتها الساحلية ظلت المدينة دائماً مقصداً سياحياً داخلياً وعالمياً يزوره ألاف السائحين سنوياً، واعتمد اقتصادها بشكل رئيسي على السياحة والأنشطة المكملة لها، وبها يعمل أغلب سكان المدينة. وتأثر هذا النشاط الغالب على طبيعة المدينة سلبياً بسبب الاضطرابات السياسية التي خاضتها مصر. تتضمن دائرة زائري المدينة العديد من الجنسيات يتمثل أغلبها في السائحين الأوروبيين القادمين من روسيا وهولندا وسلوفاكيا وبريطانيا وألمانيا فضلاً عن السائحين القادمين من دول الخليج العربي. ويقضي معظم السياح يومهم صباحاً في السباحة والاستلقاء تحت أشعة الشمس بجانب المسبح أو على شاطئ البحر، فيما يقضون لياليهم في النوادي الليلية خاصة تلك التي تقع في الجونة، فيما ينجذب البعض للنشاطات البحرية المتعددة مثل الغطس. وفي عام 2015 فازت مدينة الغردقة بجائزة أفضل وجهة سياحية عربية بعد منافسة قوية مع مدينة وهران الجزائرية في المرحلة الأخيرة للمسابقة التي بدأت في نوفمبر 2014 وانتهت بتتويج الغردقة باللقب بفارق 28 صوتاً عن أقر منافسيها ووسط 15 وجهة سياحية عربية نتيجة لتفوقها الواضح في البنية السياحية والمشروعات ووجود أغلب الخدمات التي يحتاج إليها السائح العربي. كما تم اختيار الغردقة لتكون المقر الإقليمي لمنظمة السياحة العربية.\n\nالبترول\nتتميز مدينة الغردقة بغناء أرضها بالثروات الطبيعية والتي يأتي على رأسها النفط والذي تعمل على استخراجه عدة شركات مصرية مع شراكات أجنبية حيث بدأت شركة مجاويش للبترول إنتاجها للبترول من امتيازها بمنطقة مجاويش البحرية الواقعة شمال الغردقة خلال عام 1995، كما تقع حقول شركة عش الملاحة للبترول في شمال الغردقة على مساحة 15,3 كم. فيما تعمل شركة وادي السهل للبترول بمنطقة امتياز جنوب الغردقة وشركة جبل الزيت للبترول التي تم تأسيسها عام 1995 للبحث عن البترول في شمال الغردقة بمنطقتي جبل الزيت ورأس العش وتم الإنتاج الفعلي عام 1996.\n\nالصيد\nيمتهن عدد 10 آلاف فرد من سكان المدينة حرفة صيد الأسماك ويتبعون جمعية صيادين الغردقة التي يشرف عليها الهيئة العامة للثروة السمكية التابعة لوزارة الزراعة، ويعتمدون بشكل رئيسي على صيد أسماك الشعور والكشر والتوين والبربوني وغيرها، وتمنع الهيئة الصيد بالمدينة لمدة 3 شهور من كل عام من أجل الحفاظ على الزريعة والمخزون السمكي بالمنطقة، كما تمنع الصيد تماماً في أماكن معينة بالمدينة وتحرم صيد الكائنات البحرية النادرة مثل سمك القرش وخيار البحر والسلاحف وغيرها. فيما يتم عقد مسابقات لهواة الصيد بالصنارة داخل الحدود البحرية للمدينة، والتي ينظمها الاتحاد المصري لصيد الأسماك، بالتعاون مع نادي الرياضات البحرية بالغردقة.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nميناء الغردقة الجوي\nيقع مطار الغردقة الدولي على بعد 5 كم إلى الجنوب الغربي من وسط مدينة الغردقة «حي الدهار». ويتكون المطار من مبنيين للركاب القديم تصل طاقته الاستيعابية إلى 5 ملايين و500 ألف راكب سنوياً، والجديد تصل طاقته الاستيعابية إلى 7 ملايين ونصف المليون راكب سنوياً، لتصبح سعة المطار الكلية 13 مليون راكب سنوياً بمعدل 115%. تم إنشاء المبنى الجديد في 5 سنوات بتكلفة إجمالية بلغت 3.2 مليار جنيه، بهدف القضاء على تكدس السائحين في أوقات الذروة في صالات السفر بمبنى المطار القديم. وتبلغ مساحته 92 ألف متر، ويحتوي على 3 أدوار للسفر والوصول والخدمات، ومزود بـ 72 كاونتر لإنهاء إجراءات السفر والوصول، و20 بوابة مغادرة ومنطقة أسواق حرة، ويضم المبنى الجديد ممر للطائرات يصل طوله إلى 4 كم وعرضه 75 متراً يمكنه استقبال الطائرات العملاقة، وله حقل جوي يقع على مساحة 425 ألف متر يحتوي على 16 موقعاً للطائرات منها 2 موقع للطائرات العملاقة ليصبح إجمالي عدد مواقع الطائرات بالمطار 52 موقع. ويستحوذ المبنى الجديد على 45% من إجمالي رحلات التشغيل بالمطار وتحول إليه جميع الرحلات الأوروبية والداخلية، عدا الرحلات القادمة من روسيا، والتي يستقبلها المبنى القديم. ويوفر المطار خدمات نقل منتظمة إلى القاهرة، ويقدم رحلات مباشرة إلى العديد من الوجهات الأوروبية، كما يقدم أكثر من 40 من خطوط الطيران المختلفة رحلات طيران بشكل موسمي إلى مدن أوروبا الشرقية والغربية والدول الاسكندنافية وروسيا.\n\nميناء الغردقة البحري\nيقع الميناء على الساحل الغربي للبحر الأحمر بالقرب من مدخل خليج السويس على مسافة 370 كم جنوب السويس. ويشغل مساحة أرضية تبلغ 15690 متر ومساحة مائية تبلغ 8344000 متر فيما يبلغ طول الممر الملاحي 9000 متر وعمقه 15 متر. تبرز أهمية الميناء من موقعه المتميز وخدمته لنشاط السياحة بمنطقة البحر الأحمر وسياحة اليخوت بأنواعها وسياحة سفن الرحلات الطويلة وخطوط الملاحة البحرية لنقل السياح والركاب من السعودية ودول الخليج العربي. يشتمل الميناء على صالة حديثة للركاب بمساحة 900 متر مجهزة بكافة الخدمات التي يحتاج إليها السائحون، وبها أجهزة للكشف عن الأمتعة والمفرقعات وبوابات للأشخاص، كما يجري التخطيط لبناء صالة سفر جديدة على مساحة 900 متر، وإنشاء ساحة للكشف عن السيارات القادمة بصحبة الركاب وزيادة أطوال الأرصفة لتصل إلى 240 متر لمواجهة الحركة المتزايدة لنقل الركاب والسائحين. يرسو على رصيف الميناء متوسط عدد 875 سفينة سياحية سنوياً، ومتوسط عدد 280 يخت سياحي سنوياً، فيما يصل عدد سفن الركاب العاديين (الغردقة / ضبا «السعودية») إلى 650 سفينة، بالإضافة إلى 14 ألف سيارة بصحبة الركاب، ويقدر متوسط عدد السائحين القدامين للمدينة عبر الميناء بـ 50 ألف سائح سنوياً، ومتوسط عدد الركاب العاديين 550 ألف راكب سنوياً (ضبا «السعودية»/الغردقة) - (الغردقة/شرم الشيخ).\n\nميناء جبل الزيت الجوي\nهو مطار قامت بإنشائه وزارة البترول في منطقة جبل الزيت بالبحر الأحمر بهدف دعم عملية التنقيب عن البترول في المنطقة. ويبعد المطار 80 كم إلي الشمال عن مدينة الغردقة، ويستخدم كمطار مساعد لمطار الغردقة الدولي بصورة مؤقتة عن طريق استقبال طائرات رحلات الشارتر السياحية في حالات الطوارئ وفترات الذروة أو أثناء تطوير مطار الغردقة الدولي.\n\nمارينا الجونة\nمارينا الجونة أو مارينا أبو تيج هو مارينا سياحي داخل منتجع الجونة يقع بالكيلو 21 شمال مدينة الغردقة، أنشئ بغرض إنعاش سياحة اليخوت في منطقة البحر الأحمر واستقبال اليخوت وسفن النزهة الخاصة بنزلاء منتجع الجونة. تبلغ المساحة الكلية للمارينا 3500 متر والمساحة البحرية 70 متر، ويشتمل على 17 رصيف بحري بأطوال 1599 متر وأعماق تتراوح ما بين 1.6 إلى 4.5 متر وعرض يتراوح ما بين 2.2 إلى 5.5 متر، وتصل قدرته الاستيعابية إلى 250 يخت بأطوال مختلفة.\n\nميناء جبل الزيت البحري\nهو مرسى صغير محمي من الرياح الشمالية والشمالية الشرقية والغربية يقع على مساحة 4000 متر، وتم إنشاءه بهدف شحن وتفريغ المواد البترولية، ويبعد الميناء 80 كم شمال الغردقة، و278 كم جنوب الأدبية على الضفة الغربية لخليج السويس، و11 كم من الطريق الرئيسي (الغردقة – القاهرة)، ويتميز بقربه من فتحة مدخل الخليج وموانئ التصدير القريبة من حقول البترول، وتصل القدرة الاستيعابية للميناء إلى 4 ناقلات شهرياً ويمكنه استقبال وحدات بحرية متوسطة.\n\nميناء شرق الزيت البحري\nهو ميناء بحري متخصص في شحن وتفريغ المواد البترولية وتقديم الخدمات البحرية لشركات البترول. يقع الميناء في الجزء الشرقي لخليج الزيت على البحر الأحمر على مساحة كلية 7000 متر ومساحة بحرية 4000 متر، ويبعد مسافة 278 كم عن جنوب الأدبية و80 كم عن الغردقة و802 كم عن رأس غارب، وتصل القدرة الاستيعابية للميناء إلى 3 ناقلات شهرياً بحمولة 100000 طن وغاطس رصيف 14.5 متر.\n\nالطرق البرية\nيفصل الغردقة عن العاصمة القاهرة 455 كم ويربطها بها طريق (الغردقة/السخنة/القاهرة) والذي يبدأ من حي القطامية بالقاهرة مروراً بالعين السخنة ومنها إلى الزعفرانة ثم تليها مدينة رأس غارب وعبرها إلى مدينة الغردقة مروراً بمدخل الجونة الذي يسبق مدخل الغردقة بحوالي 23 كم، وينقسم الطريق إلى حارتين بدءاً من القاهرة وحتى الزعفرانة ثم إلى حارة واحدة من الزعفرانة حتى مدخل الغردقة. كما يصل المدينة بمدن الوجه القبلي طريق (الغردقة/سفاجا/قنا/الأقصر) وهو طريق ذو منحنيات خطرة تعمل الحكومة المصرية على تطويره بهدف تقليل نسبة الوفيات المرتفعة الناتجة عن الحوادث المتعددة الواقعة عليه.\n\nالمسافة بين الغردقة والمدن المجاورة\nالمسافة بالكيلو متر:\n\nمعرض

          "content": "## Overview\nHurghada[dead link] (Arabic: الغردقة el-ğarda’a) is a resort town on the Red Sea Coast of Egypt. Famous for its superb diving opportunities, Hurghada is especially appealing to those with little experience of scuba diving, who come to marvel at the underwater reefs and awesome marine life.\n\n## Understand\nHurghada was once a fairly small and unimposing fishing village, next to the Red Sea. It has a number of superb beaches. Today, the resort of Hurghada is almost unrecognizable from its past life and has become a major destination in Egypt for budget tourists especially from Europe and Russia. It has more than 100 hotels, many of which line the shoreline, and numerous flights particularly from airports across Europe.\nTourism is now a huge part of Hurghada and each year, many tourists choose to combine their holiday here with visits to other prominent locations along the Nile Valley, including the relatively nearby city of Luxor.\n\n## Climate\nThe climate is very dry and rainfall is very rare. The weather is very hot in summer days and quite hot in summer nights. In winter the weather is generally warm by day but cool by night. Hurghada can be downright cold when the Shamal wind blows down from the northeast.\n\n## Orientation\nMiles and miles and miles of concrete, much of it abandoned developments, mar the shoreline. The oldest, most Egyptian part of the city is 27.2523333.814751 Ad-Dahar to the north, with relatively limited tourist facilities. This is separated by a low dusty ridge from 27.2264233.838142 Sigala 4 km south. Sigala is the main downtown strip, with western and traditional restaurants, hotels and general facilities, and has the most buzz about it. Several boat and dive operators run from the marina here. The main drag of Sheraton Road continues south along the coast for 4 km to the disused Sheraton Hotel, a circular 1970s concrete hulk. The road now enters the Village Resort strip, with another rash of hotels.\nThe coral reefs around Hurghada are several miles offshore, unlike the Sinai resorts and Jordan where they hug the coast, so divers and snorkelers will need to take a boat trip to enjoy them. Arid islands dot the sea. The largest is Big Giftun, which has a beach club and (better still) cellphone towers - so mobile reception is good out on the water, to the benefit of skippers and trippers.\nModern developers have kind of given up on Hurghada, and have built glossy new resorts further away, notably El Gouna 20 km north, Makadi Bay 30 km south, and Safaga 50 km south. These all use Hurghada airport as their entry point.\n\n## By plane\nHurghada has frequent direct international flights from Europe including Russia, Turkey, the Gulf states, and the Far East, e.g. Bangkok. Most of these travellers are on package tours of Egypt - but not all, as the operators also sell flight-only tickets, a cheap and convenient way to get in. Coming from Rome or Budapest there are ultra low-cost flights operated by the airline WizzAir.\nDomestic flights link Hurghada frequently to Cairo, and daily to Alexandria and Sharm el-Sheikh. These are a good way to travel as Hurghada is backed by an awful lot of desert, and road transport to other cities is lengthy, hot, dusty, bumpy and not entirely safe. The main domestic operator is Egyptair, but Nile Air and Al Masria compete on the Cairo route and keep fares low.\nThe package operators (e.g. TUI) also fly domestic legs, but these are to move their own clients around Egypt and are not available to book point-to-point.\n27.17805633.7991671 [dead link] Hurghada International Airport (HRG  IATA). Egyptair flights use Terminal 2, everyone else uses Terminal 1. It's a decent airport - Egypt enjoys good flying weather, so the usual problem will be bad weather across Europe and long-delayed turnaround flights. The check-in hall will then become a surly scrummage of outbound passengers sitting on their luggage and the toilets overflowing.      (updated Jan 2018)\nThere is free Wifi for 15 min. After that duration you need to pay to continue.\nIn the arrivals area you can buy a SIM card with lots of mobile data for good prices. More details about the mobile network providers in the  Egypt article.\nThere is no local bus or microbus departing from the airport. Package tourist arrivals will have their own bus awaiting, everyone else uses an Uber/Careem, taxi or walks out of the airport. The walking distance to the highway is 1.3 km or 15 min and it's barely shaded. At the highway you can stop a microbus and ask, if it heads to your direction.\nThe airport is about 8 km west of the Hurghada resort strip and 10 km to the Hurghada district Sigala. Taxi fares are high for these short distances. You could easily be paying LE200. In December 2022 a taxi driver haggled himself down to LE100 to the marina of Hurghada. Careem to Soma Bay is LE220 (Oct 2018). The regular fare towards the airport is much cheaper. Drivers pay LE35 to enter and wait within the airport: naturally they seek to recover this from both the inbound and the outbound traveller. Otherwise, just walk to the highway and catch a taxi there. There is an LE50 toll on the highway south to Safaga (Oct 2018) that is included in fares.\nGetting back to the airport is possible by Uber/Careem, taxi or walking. For the latter take a microbus that goes to the Total gas station near the airport. At the police checkpoint you may need to show your passport, flight reservation and may need to undertake a small security check. The departure hall of the airport is upstairs.\n\n## By bus\n27.2381833.831952 Go Bus Station (about 1 km north of High Jet). Many destinations—check their website. The GoBus website allows you to purchase return tickets on all routes direct to your mobile phone as an e-ticket which is very convenient - you just need to set up an account to do this and foreign tourists are welcome on all services provided you are not travelling on restricted roads. Between Cairo, Luxor and Hurghada is perfectly fine.    (updated Dec 2022)\n27.24086533.8276243 Super Jet Bus Station. The buses have a golden color with red stripes. 'Super Jet' is written in small letters on the bus.    (updated Dec 2022)\n27.2284733.835994 High Jet Bus Station (to/from Cairo). It covers travel to/from Cairo (6-7 hr). Reserving tickets is barely necessary, considering the frequency of the buses. The buses are not that comfortable, and they have loud and annoying soap operas running in the bus during the whole journey. So, it is probably not a good idea to take a night bus. From Cairo: every 2-3 hr between 8AM-2:30AM. To Cairo: every 2-3 hr between 7AM-3AM. About LE210    (updated Dec 2022)\nCairo – The trip usually takes approximately 7 hr depending on the operator. Known operators include the Super Jet (ph. 16108), Go Bus (ph. 19567) and HighJet. There are a number of stations which include one behind Cairo railway station Ahmed Helmy. There are many price options starting from LE210 and rising to LE320, every hour you can find bus to Hurghada (avoid MCV Co). In Medan El Giza in northwestern Cairo often extremely crowded, or Almaza Station in the Heliopolis district in northeastern Cairo. Bus schedules often change, but if you go to the bus station without booking you'll find many options. (updated Dec 2022)\nAlexandria – There are 2 buses from Alexandria to Hurghada. The first one, Upper Egypt Bus Co., leaves at 6:30PM from the new bus station, and costs LE90. It arrives at Hurghada about 4:30AM. It is not recommended because you'll find all the city in deep sleep and seems like ghost city. The second bus, Super Jet Co., leaves the new bus station at 8:30PM and costs LE95. It arrives in the morning so you can find public transport and the taxis. (February 2012)\nQena and Luxor – About 4-5 hr by bus. Go Bus has two daily buses at 8:15AM and 3:30PM to and from Luxor from LE90. If you're looking at the GoBus site on a mobile device, you may not be able to find listings for Luxor—try a laptop or desktop view.\nUpper Egypt Bus Co. runs between Hurghada, Safagah, Luxor and Aswan.\nAswan – There's one transport company to the Red Sea, Upper Egypt Bus Co. The buses are new, the ticket costs LE50 (maybe you pay extra LE5 as a foreigner). There are 2 buses: 3:30PM and 5:30PM. The trip takes 8 hours or more, which means you'll arrive in Hurghada after midnight. (February 2012)\n\n## By taxi\nTaxi drivers in Hurghada have astonishing talent for spotting tourists from far, far away; look at the approaching car and it will stop for you - at a price.\nBefore stepping in, find out if driver speaks any English, and show the wanted destination on the map. There are only few streets with names, so the destination is specified with nearby places, a hotel for example. Discuss and agree the total price (not per person) with the driver. Do not travel with the meter on, driver can control it. After the driver agrees on a price, jump in. Get out in front of the hotel.\nTo avoid confrontation with the drivers ensure you have the correct amount of money you agreed at first, hand over the money on at destination, get out and walk away.\nIf you pay with a LE5 or LE50 notes drivers may try to switch it for a 50-piastre note, and then they request the original note that you have already paid. Piastres notes are smaller than pounds. Sometimes the driver agrees on LE15 fare, and when you arrive tells you he said LE50 and his accent worsens.\nABC Taxi, ☏ +20 100 222 82 94. ABC provides a professional service with agreed fares in advance. Call them from a local mobile phone to make a booking. The call will drop straight away and they call you back immediately, saving your credit. The details of the car will be sent by SMS, with the rate being confirmed by SMS too. A ride between Makadi Bay and Hurghada Marina (about 30 km) cost LE126 in August 2019. (updated Aug 2019)\n\n## By boat\nFerry services between Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh, on the Sinai peninsula, were suspended in 2010, and no resumption is in sight.\nA fast-cat ferry runs between Safaga, 50 km south of Hurghada, to Diba (or Duba) in Saudi Arabia. As this route carries a lot of pilgrims and trucking, it's not been hit by the tourist downtown. You'll need to have sorted your Saudi visa well in advance.\n\n## By micro bus\nA swarm of white minibuses (Toyota Hiace) called micro bus serve the area, with a flat fare of LE2–3 (Dec 2022). They run fixed routes, mostly along the coastal strip, picking up and dropping off anywhere along the way. Ask around for your destination before getting in - if it's not this bus, it's probably the next one already pulling up. They're cramped and crowded, and young women may have to ward off pests.\nSlightly larger minibuses or small regular buses run frequently along the coastal highway to El Gouna and Safaga.\n\n## By e-hailing\nUber and Careem\noperate in Hurghada. They are reasonably priced and convenient, sparing you the incessant haggling required for taxi rides. 4km of driving cost about LE20 (Dec 2022).\nSome locations (e.g. the bus station and some hotels) within Hurghada have been \"blocked\" on Uber. You will see a message that Uber \"does not operate in this location\". Simply walk about 2-3 blocks/5 minutes away from the building (avoiding the taxi touts along the way), and you will be able to use Uber again.\n\n## See\nHurghada does not have many spectacular sights except for the Red Sea. However, daily one- or two-day trips are available into both Luxor and Cairo. The Nile at Luxor is popular, as are the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx in Giza, Cairo.\n\n## Do\nIf you were to choose to stay in your hotel complex for the duration of your break, you would miss out on much more than you bargained for. Swimming in the warm sea, windsurfing, para sailing, jetski, good shopping, excellent and varied cuisine from around the world are just a few things to mention, but there is more:\nCruise across the Red Sea to the uninhabited island of Giftun surrounded by magical coral gardens. Enjoy a lazy day on the white sand or swim among the coral reefs. The reefs near the island have many fish and corals which makes it ideal for snorkelling. There are many types of boat trips available, from half day pirate cruises for youngsters to adult only day cruises.\nQuad-biking hundreds of miles into the Sahara desert for tea with a Bedoin tribe, then camel-riding across Biblical plains to see remote and ancient wonders. For a desert adventure, you can also ride motorbikes or beach buggies into the desert.\nYou can also ride a glass bottom boat on which you can see the amazing coral reefs and underwater scenery.\nIn the evening, you can go for a walk in the promenade area for some traditional cafes, shopping, or dining. There is a bowling and family entertainment center close by as well as a few malls and restaurants. Night life usually begins quite late, and you can find some clubs in close proximity to the promenade.\n\n## Beaches\nIt might be windy in late March (or not). You may want to check if your beach resort hotel provides windscreens on the beach.\nIf your accommodation does not have its own beach: There are no beaches in Hurghada that are for free. You can use for example these ones:\n27.22120633.8426361 El Sakia Beach (Near the marina). Entry: LE50.    (updated Oct 2022)\n27.21299733.8426322 Orange Beach (Somewhat more south of the marina). Entry: LE100.    (updated Dec 2022)\n27.25923733.8241323 El Sawaky Beach (In Northern Hurghada). A lot of space and just a few tourists. Entry: LE50.    (updated Nov 2022)\n\n## Diving\nThe main reason to visit Hurghada is the Red Sea, which is excellent for diving or snorkeling. See incredible coral reefs and hundreds of varieties of tropical fish just 10 m from the beach or with boat trips. Either your hotel will have dive escorts on site, or it can arrange a scuba diving expedition with guides. The divers are locals and generally excellent in handling beginners. You don't need to know how to swim to scuba dive. In late March, the water may be a bit cold, so a wet suit might be necessary. Most budget hotels have dives tours (2 regular dives) for €50 on offer, but if you are staying at one of the more posh accommodations, you will end up paying up to US$65. So better to step out of your comfort zone (aka hotel) and ask around for prices.\nAshraf Divers (Ashraf Asheaf), ☏ +20 1223848445, ashrafdiver1@gmail.com. Reliable, relaxed and friendly dive master. His dives include everything; travel, boat, equipment, food, drinks. Though, do not rely on him for booking your accommodation—read Egypt#Cope. WhatsApp: see phone number. WeChat: ashraf diver. See also: Ashraf Abat. As inexpensive as other good deals— $35 for 2 dives inkling full rental equipment (as of Okt.2022), depending on number of people and season. (updated Sep 2018)\n\n\n## Kitesurfing\nThe whole Red Sea coast has superb conditions for kitesurfing. Hurghada is no exception. Here you can find a lot of kite-spots with kite-schools and kite-stations. Here some of them:\nPlayKite, in the next bay from Nubia hotel. This kite spot has a lot of space for beginning and advanced riders\nKite4Fun, near AMC Azur and Hawaii Le Jardin hotels. This place has shallow lagoon with flat water.\nMasters Surf School, in Panorama Bungalows Aqua Park Hurghada hotel. Small area of shallow water, so it is a good spot for intermediate riders\nAeros School[dead link], near Play Kite station. There is also a shallow lagoon where any level rider can ride.\n\n## Buy\nYou can buy many souvenirs from the shops that are spread inside the main town (Sekalla high street) and along the beach areas, also the old town (el Dahar) has a wide selection of bazaars with cheaper prices than Sigala. There is a new shopping mall now open about a 10-minute taxi ride from the town, on Senzo Mall towards the airport road. It has a large Spinneys Hypermarket and many other shops, fast food outlets, a 5-screen cinema, and a moderate sized children's play area.\nRemember to haggle, haggle and haggle everywhere except in restaurants and pharmacies. You should be able to get 75% off from the price that seller asks at first. This might vary with different products, so remember to check few shops for correct prices. There are souvenir shops that have fixed prices, mostly in New Hurghada area although these maye be higher than if you haggle in the souks. The well known \"Cleopatra\" shops, in Hurghada city Mamsha and Sheraton road, have a wide range of souvenirs such as shirts, woodwork and silver.\nFor brand-names and higher quality products, go to 'New Marina' and Sheraton road for Adidas, Timberland, Dockers and Levi's. Clothes for sale in the traditional bazaar (souq in Arabic) are often fake, although the banners show the well-known brand names.\nAbout the perfume shops the milligram for LE1 that means the best perfume for LE25 because all the perfume are on oil base and rarely that you can find natural or original perfume. Be careful when they drag you inside, they will invite you to drink something often tea. If they feel you are rich they will buy cola, while they are chatting with you and let you smell some strong perfumes, it is advisable to refuse because if you drink you then have to buy.\n\n## Eat\nHurghada offers a variety of cuisine, including fast food, western restaurants, oriental food, and many others. KFC and McDonald's, and local fast food GAD, are present. There some Syrian restaurants in the Sheraton Road and more in the Marina, Indian, Thai, Sea food and Lebanese\n\n## Budget\nA little internet searching will throw up some private self-catering accommodation that is usually owned by Europeans as a holiday home, which gives much more independence than staying in a resort hotel and is potentially much cheaper. Budget hotels catering to Egyptians with rooms at LE50 can be found near the Upper Egypt bus station.\n27.22093233.840141 Golden Rose Hotel, Qesm Hurghada, ☏ +20 653440876. Good value. Includes access to a beach (200 m) – not great but free chairs and towels. There is a dog that continuously barks and fights with other dogs or various by-passers, even during the night. Single from LE177.    (updated Dec 2017)\n27.2600233.819542 Snafer Hotel (in the northern part of the city), ☏ +20 653540260. Almost even better value than Golden Rose but without free beach access. But there is Sea Sand Resort around the corner, which charges LE50 for a whole day of beach access. However, it is in the northern part of the city, where not much is happening due to the low occupation of the local resorts. Single from LE100.

Opulent Moorish-style hotel    (updated Feb 2018)\n\n## Drink\nThose new to Egypt will find karkaday (a drink made from an infusion of hibiscus, served hot or cold and reputed to have many health benefits) and chi (local version of tea, usually served in a glass) offered everywhere. Both are delicious and will usually come replete with a smoke on a sheesha pipe, known in the West as a hookah. Sheeshas are used for smoking molasses tobacco in various flavours, with the smoke passing through water before inhalation through a long tube attached to the bowl. Although they may resemble a device used to smoke illicit substances in the west (a bong), sheesha is legal.\nAlcoholic drinks can usually be found in bars or hotels. Hurghada has a very western atmosphere so it is much easier to drink than in other areas of Egypt. Non-alcoholic drinks include canned soft drinks and fruit juice, and traditional Egyptian drinks including the aforementioned karkadeh, yansoon (aniseed tea), ganzabeel (ginger tea, reputed to have digestive benefits), irfa (cinnamon tea), and sahlab (a hot, drinkable pudding thickened with orchid-root starch and typically flavored with cinammon). Lemonade is also available both cold and hot, and may be made with mint.\nOver the years, Hurghada has developed a bubbling reputation for its cosmopolitan nightlife scene, alongside the many bars within the new 27.2258633.841021 Hurghada Marina.\nThere are many bars, nightclubs and discos in Hurghada. Almost every hotel comes equipped with its own disco coupled with the world's first Hed Kandi Beach Bar, other nightlife leaders in the city include Hard Rock Cafe, Little Budha, Calypso Disco, the R&B Club, and throughout the summer months you can find the popular Voodoo parties (every Wednesday) within the Grand Hotel Resorts.\nThere are many other discos and late-night bars dotted around the city, generally speaking ask at your hotel or tour guide to recommend a venue.\n27.2137833.839262 Praha Cafe (at the end of Sheraton Rd). Czech pub.    (updated Mar 2023)\n27.23992233.8396253 Dubai Cafe. Variety of non-alcoholic drinks and hookah, welcoming local atmosphere, street-side and indoor lounge area. cheap.    (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Sleep\nLarge tour operators such as Tui have their own resorts or block bookings with newer local groups like Jaz. These are often the \"all inclusive\" variety. These may not appeal to the independent traveller, but they can still be a good base for exploring the area. There are plenty of internet sites to find reviews and book these.\n\n## Cope\n27.2580733.812071 Hurghada Clinic, El Kawther, build. 222, apart. 207, Red Sea, ☏ +20 11 148 27733, info@clinica-egypt.com.

(updated Mar 2023)\n\n## Embassies\nItaly, Mastaba Red Sea - Hurgada, ☏ +20 65 3449 366.\n\n## Stay safe\nIn 2018, there were complaints of guests falling ill at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel because of possible food safety issues, including undercooked food and lapses in cleanliness. Two British travellers died; the BBC reports travel agency Thomas Cook removed its clients from that hotel and in some cases arranged to fly them home.\nBecause of the heat combined with inadequate food hygiene, gastrointestinal ailments are common (sickness and diarrhoea). The better tourist resorts do make an effort to have good hygiene, but nothing is ever certain.\n\n## Go next\nLuxor – The obvious and popular next destination. It can be done on a day-trip, though that's a bit mad, and most of a 20-hour day. Ask around for reputable operators: a cheap tour will be overcrowded, first too cold then too hot in a poorly-sprung minibus, and you will see less of Karnak and the Valley of the Kings and a whole heap more of the driver's uncle's souvenir shop.\nAswan – Reached via Luxor but less hassle then it. Once a week there's a ferry across Lake Nasser to Wadi Halfa in Sudan, the only surface route between the two countries.",

It is described as a \"popular\" tourist destination.  Marsa Alam is a relatively recently built town; its development began in 1995 through the investments of the Kuwaiti Al-Kharafi Group, which established the town and its initial facilities, resorts and infrastructure. Its growth was accelerated by the opening of Marsa Alam International Airport in 2003.

          "content": "The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the pyramid of Khafre, and the pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.\nThe site is at the edge of the Western Desert, approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 km (8.1 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. It forms the northernmost part of the 16,000 ha (160 km2; 62 sq mi) Pyramid Fields of the Memphis and its Necropolis UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1979. The pyramid fields include the Abusir, Saqqara, and Dahshur pyramid complexes, which were all built in the vicinity of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis. Further Old Kingdom pyramid fields were located at the sites Abu Rawash, Zawyet El Aryan, and Meidum. Most of the limestone used to build the pyramids originates from the underlying Mokattam Formation.\nThe Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.\n\nMaadi settlements\nThe earliest settlement of the Giza plateau predates the pyramid complexes. Four jars from the Maadi culture were found at the foot of the Great Pyramid, likely from a disturbed earlier settlement. Further Maadi settlement near the site was uncovered during work on the Greater Cairo Wastewater Project. Recent reassessment of the radiocarbon dating puts the Maadi culture's eponymous settlement to c. 3800 – c. 3400 BC, which is also the likely maximum possible range for the Giza remains.\n\nPyramids and Sphinx\nThe Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC), the slightly smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren) a few hundred metres to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther south-west. The Great Sphinx lies on the east side of the complex. Consensus among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of Khafre. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as \"queens\" pyramids, causeways, and temples. Besides the archaeological structures, the ancient landscape has also been investigated.\n\nKhufu's complex\nKhufu's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, now buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; diabase paving and nummulitic limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated. The valley temple was connected to a causeway that was largely destroyed when the village was constructed. The causeway led to the Mortuary Temple of Khufu, which was connected to the pyramid. Of this temple, the basalt pavement is the only thing that remains. The king's pyramid has three smaller queens' pyramids (G1-a, G1-b, and G1-c) associated with it and three boat pits. The boat pits contained a ship, and the two pits on the south side of the pyramid contained intact ships when excavated. One of these ships, the Khufu ship, has been restored and was originally displayed at the Giza Solar boat museum, then subsequently moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nKhufu's pyramid still has a limited number of casing stones at its base. These casing stones were made of fine white limestone quarried at Tura.\n\nKhafre's complex\nKhafre's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, the Sphinx temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple yielded several statues of Khafre. Several were found in a well in the floor of the temple by Mariette in 1860. Others were found during successive excavations by Sieglin (1909–1910), Junker, Reisner, and Hassan. Khafre's complex contained five boat-pits and a subsidiary pyramid with a serdab.\nKhafre's pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre's pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.\n\nMenkaure's complex\nMenkaure's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple once contained several statues of Menkaure. During the 5th Dynasty, a smaller ante-temple was added on to the valley temple. The mortuary temple also yielded several statues of Menkaure. The king's pyramid, completed c. 2510 BC, has three subsidiary or queen's pyramids.\nOf the four major monuments, only Menkaure's pyramid is seen today without any of its original polished limestone casing.\n\nSphinx\nThe Sphinx dates from the reign of king Khafre. During the New Kingdom, Amenhotep II dedicated a new temple to Hauron-Haremakhet and this structure was added onto by later rulers.\n\nTomb of Queen Khentkaus I\nKhentkaus I was buried in Giza. Her tomb is known as LG 100 and G 8400 and is located in the Central Field, near the valley temple of Menkaure. The pyramid complex of Queen Khentkaus includes her pyramid, a boat pit, a valley temple, and a pyramid town.\n\nConstruction\nMost construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. Disagreements arise over the feasibility of the different proposed methods by which the stones were conveyed and placed.\nIn building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time. They would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock—not sand—which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.\nFor the Great Pyramid, most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the Nile. These exterior blocks had to be carefully cut, transported by river barge to Giza, and dragged up ramps to the construction site. Only a few exterior blocks remain in place at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. During the Middle Ages (5th century to 15th century), people may have taken the rest away for building projects in the city of Cairo.\nTo ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded over time.\nNew insights into the closing stages of the Great Pyramid building were provided by the 2013 find of Wadi el-Jarf papyri, especially the diary of inspector Merer, whose team was assigned to deliver the white limestone from Tura quarries to Giza. The journal was already published, as well as a popular account of the importance of this discovery.\n\nPurpose\nThe pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled Ancient Egypt. A portion of the pharaoh's spirit called his ka was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the \"former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead\". It is theorized the pyramid not only served as a tomb for the pharaoh, but also as a storage pit for various items he would need in the afterlife. The people of Ancient Egypt believed that death on Earth was the start of a journey to the next world. The embalmed body of the king was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife.\n\nAstronomy\nThe sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were astronomically oriented to the cardinal directions within a small fraction of a degree. According to the disputed Orion correlation theory, the arrangement of the pyramids is a representation of the constellation Orion.\n\nWorkers' village\nThe work of quarrying, moving, setting, and sculpting the huge amount of stone used to build the pyramids might have been accomplished by several thousand skilled workers, unskilled laborers and supporting workers. Bakers, carpenters, water carriers, and others were also needed for the project. Along with the methods used to construct the pyramids, there is also wide speculation regarding the exact number of workers needed for a building project of this magnitude. When Greek historian Herodotus visited Giza in 450 BC, he was told by Egyptian priests that \"the Great Pyramid had taken 400,000 men 20 years to build, working in three-month shifts 100,000 men at a time.\" Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid.\nThe Giza pyramid complex is surrounded by a large stone wall, outside which Mark Lehner and his team discovered a town where the pyramid workers were housed. The village is located to the southeast of the Khafre and Menkaure complexes. Among the discoveries at the workers' village are communal sleeping quarters, bakeries, breweries, and kitchens (with evidence showing that bread, beef, and fish were dietary staples), a copper workshop, a hospital, and a cemetery (where some of the skeletons were found with signs of trauma associated with accidents on a building site). The metal processed at the site was the so-called arsenical copper. The same material was also identified among the copper artefacts from the \"Kromer\" site, from the reigns of Khufu and Khafre.\nThe workers' town appears to date from the middle 4th Dynasty (2520–2472 BC), after the accepted time of Khufu and completion of the Great Pyramid. According to Lehner and the AERA team:\n\nThe development of this urban complex must have been rapid. All of the construction probably happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure, builders of the Second and Third Giza Pyramids.\nUsing pottery shards, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to date the site, the team further concludes:\n\nThe picture that emerges is that of a planned settlement, some of the world's earliest urban planning, securely dated to the reigns of two Giza pyramid builders: Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC).\nRadiocarbon data for the Old Kingdom Giza plateau and the workers' settlement were published in 2006, and then re-evaluated in 2011.\n\nCemeteries\nAs the pyramids were constructed, the mastabas for lesser royals were constructed around them. Near the pyramid of Khufu, the main cemetery is G 7000, which lies in the East Field located to the east of the main pyramid and next to the Queen's pyramids. These cemeteries around the pyramids were arranged along streets and avenues. Cemetery G 7000 was one of the earliest and contained tombs of wives, sons, and daughters of these 4th Dynasty rulers. On the other side of the pyramid in the West Field, the royals' sons Wepemnofret and Hemiunu were buried in Cemetery G 1200 and Cemetery G 4000, respectively. These cemeteries were further expanded during the 5th and 6th Dynasties.\n\nWest Field\nThe West Field is located to the west of Khufu's pyramid. It is divided into smaller areas such as the cemeteries referred to as the Abu Bakr Excavations (1949–1950, 1950–1951, 1952, and 1953), and several cemeteries named based on the mastaba numbers such as Cemetery G 1000, Cemetery G 1100, etc. The West Field contains Cemetery G1000 – Cemetery G1600, and Cemetery G 1900. Further cemeteries in this field are: Cemeteries G 2000, G 2200, G 2500, G 3000, G 4000, and G 6000. Three other cemeteries are named after their excavators: Junker Cemetery West, Junker Cemetery East, and Steindorff Cemetery.\n\nEast Field\nThe East Field is located to the east of Khufu's pyramid and contains cemetery G 7000. This cemetery was a burial place for some of the family members of Khufu.\nThe cemetery also includes mastabas from tenants and priests of the pyramids dated to the 5th Dynasty and 6th Dynasty.\n\nCemetery GIS\nThis cemetery dates from the time of Menkaure (Junker) or earlier (Reisner), and contains several stone-built mastabas dating from as late as the 6th Dynasty. Tombs from the time of Menkaure include the mastabas of the royal chamberlain Khaemnefert, the King's son Khufudjedef (master of the royal largesse), and an official named Niankhre.\n\nCentral Field\nThe Central Field contains several burials of royal family members. The tombs range in date from the end of the 4th Dynasty to the 5th Dynasty or even later.\n\nTombs dating from the Saite and later period were found near the causeway of Khafre and the Great Sphinx. These tombs include the tomb of a commander of the army named Ahmose and his mother Queen Nakhtubasterau, who was the wife of Pharaoh Amasis II.\n\nSouth Field\nThe South Field includes mastabas dating from the 1st Dynasty to 3rd Dynasty as well as later burials. Of the more significant of these early dynastic tombs are one referred to as \"Covington's tomb\", otherwise known as Mastaba T, and the large Mastaba V which contained artifacts naming the 1st Dynasty pharaoh Djet. Other tombs date from the late Old Kingdom (5th and 6th Dynasty). The south section of the field contains several tombs dating from the Saite period and later.\n\nTombs of the pyramid builders\nIn 1990, tombs belonging to the pyramid workers were discovered alongside the pyramids, with an additional burial site found nearby in 2009. Although not mummified, they had been buried in mudbrick tombs with beer and bread to support them in the afterlife. The tombs' proximity to the pyramids and the manner of burial supports the theory that they were paid laborers who took pride in their work and were not slaves, as was previously thought. Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid. Most of the workers appear to have come from poor families. Specialists such as architects, masons, metalworkers, and carpenters were permanently employed by the king to fill positions that required the most skill.\n\nShafts\nThere are multiple burial-shafts and various unfinished shafts and tunnels located in the Giza complex that were discovered and mentioned prominently by Selim Hassan in his report Excavations at Giza 1933–1934. He states: \"Very few of the Saitic [referring to the Saite Period] shafts have been thoroughly examined, for the reason that most of them are flooded.\"\n\nOsiris Shaft\nThe Osiris Shaft is a narrow burial-shaft leading to three levels for a tomb and below it a flooded area. It was mentioned by Hassan, and a thorough excavation was conducted by a team led by Hawass in 1999. It was opened to tourists in November 2017.\n\nNew Kingdom and Late Period\nDuring the New Kingdom Giza was still an active site. A brick-built chapel was constructed near the Sphinx during the early 18th Dynasty, probably by King Thutmose I. Amenhotep II built a temple dedicated to Hauron-Haremakhet near the Sphinx. As a prince, the future pharaoh Thutmose IV visited the pyramids and the Sphinx; he reported being told in a dream that if he cleared the sand that had built up around the Sphinx, he would be rewarded with kingship. This event is recorded in the Dream Stele, which he had installed between the Sphinx's front legs.\nDuring the early years of his reign, Thutmose IV, together with his wife Queen Nefertari, had stelae erected at Giza.\nPharaoh Tutankhamun had a structure built, which is now referred to as the king's resthouse.\nDuring the 19th Dynasty, Seti I added to the temple of Hauron-Haremakhet, and his son Ramesses II erected a stela in the chapel before the Sphinx and usurped the resthouse of Tutankhamun.\nDuring the 21st Dynasty, the Temple of Isis Mistress-of-the-Pyramids was reconstructed. During the 26th Dynasty, a stela made in this time mentions Khufu and his Queen Henutsen.\n\nDivision of the 1903–1905 excavation of the Giza Necropolis\nIn 1903, rights to excavate the West Field and Pyramids of the Giza Necropolis were divided by three institutions from Italy, Germany, and the United States of America.\n\nBackground\nPrior to the division of the Giza Plateau into three institutional concessions in 1903, amateur and private excavations at the Giza Necropolis had been permitted to operate. The work of these amateur archaeologists failed to meet high scientific standards. Montague Ballard, for instance, excavated in the Western Cemetery (with the hesitant permission of the Egyptian Antiquities Service) and neither kept records of his finds nor published them.\n\nItalian, German, and American Concessions at Giza\nIn 1902, the Egyptian Antiquities Service under Gaston Maspero resolved to issue permits exclusively to authorized individuals representing public institutions. In November of that year, the Service awarded three scholars with concessions on the Giza Necropolis. They were the Italian Ernesto Schiaparelli from the Turin Museum, the German Georg Steindorff from the University of Leipzig who had funding from Wilhelm Pelizaeus, and the American George Reisner from the Hearst Expedition. Within a matter of months, the site had been divided between the concessionaires following a meeting at the Mena House Hotel involving Schiaparelli, Ludwig Borchardt (Steindorff's representative in Egypt), and Reisner.\n\nDivision of the West Field\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the three largest pyramids on the Giza plateau were considered mostly exhausted by previous excavations, so the Western Cemetery and its collection of private mastaba tombs were thought to represent the richest unexcavated part of the plateau. George Reisner's wife, Mary, drew names from a hat to assign three long east-west plots of the necropolis among the Italian, German, and American missions. Schiaparelli was assigned the southernmost strip, Borchardt the center, and Reisner the northernmost.\n\nDivision of the Pyramids\nRights to excavate the Pyramids were then also negotiated between Schiaparelli, Borchardt, and Reisner. Schiaparelli gained rights to excavate the Great Pyramid of Khufu along with its three associated queens' pyramids and most of its Eastern Cemetery. Borchardt received Khafre's pyramid, its causeway, the Sphinx, and the Sphinx's associated temples. Reisner claimed Menkaure's pyramid as well as its associated queens' pyramids and pyramid temple, along with a portion of Schiaparelli's Eastern Cemetery. Any future disputes were to be resolved by Inspector James Quibell, as per a letter from Borchardt to Maspero.\n\nImmediate aftermath\nThis arrangement lasted until 1905, when, under the supervision of Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini, the Italian excavations ceased at Giza. As the Italians were more interested in sites which might yield more papyri, they turned their concession of the southern strip of the Western Cemetery over to the Americans under Reisner.\n\nModern usage\nIn 1978, the Grateful Dead played a series of concerts later released as Rocking the Cradle: Egypt 1978. In 2007, Colombian singer Shakira performed at the complex to a crowd of approximately 100,000 people. The complex was used for the final draw of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2021 World Men's Handball Championship.\nEgypt's Minister of Tourism unveiled plans for a €17,000,000 revamp of the complex by the end of 2021, in order to boost tourism in Egypt as well as make the site more accessible and tourist-friendly. According to Lonely Planet, the refurbishment includes a new visitors' centre, an environmentally-friendly electric bus, a restaurant (the 9 Pyramids Lounge), as well as a cinema, public toilets, site-wide signage, food trucks, photo booths, and free Wi-Fi. The new facility is part of a wider plan to renovate the 4,500 year old site.\n\nSee also\nEgyptian pyramids\nList of Egyptian pyramids\nList of largest monoliths, includes section on calculating weight of megaliths\nOutline of Egypt\nTeotihuacan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nGiza Plateau\nPyramids in Giza – Pictures of Giza Pyramids published under Creative Commons License.\nWebsite of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates, researching Giza for over 30 years\n3D virtual tour explaining Houdin's theory Archived 28 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine (plug in needed)\nThe Giza Archives at Harvard University – since 2010, the Giza Archives Project website Archived 11 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine maintained by the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, has moved to Harvard University with an improved, expanded website.

          "content": "## Overview\nPicture yourself in Egypt and you picture this. Imagine Ancient Egypt and this is where your mind will land. Here is Giza, the city just west of Cairo, where on a desert plateau stand the Pyramids, Sphinx and royal tombs of the pharaohs.\n\n## Understand\nEverything west of the Nile's eastern bank is actually in the City of Giza (الجيزة el-Gīza) rather than the City of Cairo. It's a huge conurbation that includes the Nile islands of Gezira and Roda, the riverside neighbourhoods of Dokki and Mohandeseen, and mile after mile of tatty low-rise and 'burbs. Giza plus Cairo and three other townships make up the Greater Cairo Metropolis. But of course the top sight is the UNESCO World Heritage site Pyramids of Giza, at the western edge of the city, in the \"Haram\" district. The Grand Egyptian Museum has started its trial phase already and is open to visitors. This means that Giza is developing into a tourist base in its own right, especially along the main axis of the Haram or Pyramids Road.\nIt's difficult now to imagine this place 100 years ago, with early tourists arriving by carriage along unpaved roads through the fields. The vast, grubby metropolis now sprawls right to the foot of the pyramids complex. Fortunately, development has been prevented (or removed) on the plateau, so the pyramids still stand proud in an arid expanse. A low ridge cuts the view to the south & west so it feels like the threshold of the Sahara, not just a sandy park or anti-oasis in the midst of burbs and more burbs. To the southeast, the pyramids of Abusir and Saqqara shimmer in the distance.\nLots of countries have ancient pyramids: Mexico, Indonesia, Greece, Sudan, Iran. Egypt has at least 135, with perhaps more undiscovered, but Sudan has about 240. The three main Pyramids in Giza are the focal point of the Giza necropolis, or cemetery, that served the elite of the Old Kingdom capital at nearby Memphis in the 2500s BCE. Three pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty were buried here, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, along with members of their royal household. They chose it, west of Memphis, because west was the direction of the afterlife.\nThe new pyramids were magnificent, but they were something of a giveaway to tomb-robbers. Later pharaohs preferred hidden tombs, such as those in the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor. (So it's from these hidden tombs that most Egyptian mummies and artifacts have been recovered.) All the pyramids fell into disrepair, were repeatedly breached by robbers, and their stone cladding was pilfered for building. Wind and rain have whittled them down. However, they're still magnificent.\nAnother magnificent thing about the pyramids is their age: when the Great Pyramids were being constructed, mammoths still roamed Siberia and North America. Forty-two centuries (4200 years) have seen these pyramids stand tall and proud over the cities of the Nile delta.\n\n## Get in\nWhen seeking transport, ask for \"Haram\" and shape your hands like a pyramid by making an upside down Vicory sign with your index and middle finger: people, especially minibus drivers will know where you want to go. Also, see Egypt#By metro or Egypt#By train for more details.\nIn Summer 2025 the gates the the park were reconfigured. The Mena Gate that you could enter from the east was closed. A new main gate was established to the south of the park that has a higher capacity but requires you to take a shuttle bus or a long walk through the park get to what you want to see. There is a sneaky subgate, at the southeast of the park, near the sphinx, which is normally used as an exit but where you can also buy tickets (the ticket office is in an alleyway on the right of the gate), and here you'll enter almost right under the sphinx.\n\n## By plane\nSphinx International Airport (SPX  IATA) near Giza opened in 2020 and as of 2025 has flights with Wizzair from the UK, UAE and various other points in Europe.\n\n## By train\nThe main railway line between Cairo and Luxor/Aswan runs through Giza, where most services halt, so you can travel along the Nile valley without backtracking via downtown Cairo. Indeed some seasonal sleeper trains start from Giza rather than Cairo Ramses station.\n30.00595131.2079651 El Giza railway station, Al Omraneyah Ash Sharqeyah, Al Omraneyah.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## By taxi\nGet an Uber or InDrive to the pyramids. From anywhere in Cairo it won't cost you more than LE150.\nAll the standard warnings about Cairo taxis (see Cairo#By taxi) apply with even greater force around this prime tourist spot. So many tourists, so many of them unwary or jet-lagged, let's fleece these lambs! And it's remarkable how swiftly a \"broken\" taxi meter is restored to life once the driver sees you're serious about bailing out. Taxi drivers may pressure you to see the pyramid complex on horseback, and take you to their friend's stable, but the site is walkable (only a few kilometers across in any direction, maybe 10 km² in area total).\nThe taxi should be able to take you right to the pyramids entrance gate at the very end of the avenue, whereas buses and other vehicles must stop about 500 m short of there. Coming back, taxis will be waiting around the exit gate near the Sphinx.\n\n## By metro/bus\nTake the metro to the Giza metro station. From near there, frequent buses and microbuses run west towards the pyramids, for a fare of LE7. Listen out for conductors shouting \"Haram!\" or look for route numbers 355 or 357. Many of these buses, along with routes 900 and 997, start from central Cairo: look for them around Midan Tahrir. A bus from downtown will be a slow, bumpy experience, as Giza town traffic is just as congested as central Cairo traffic, so use the Metro to get to Giza station and take the microbus from there.\nAs of 2025, the metro is being extended towards the pyramids and the entire road is a construction project, so it can be somewhat of a maze to find the buses and minibuses that can take you toward the pyramids. Don't ask around at the metro station; people will try to hustle you. Instead just point yourself in the direction of the main east-west road and once you find the road walk west until you see minibuses or people waiting impatiently for one. Once you find local Egyptians uninterested in your visit to the pyramids they'll typically be kind and helpful.\nBuses and microbuses can only run to within 500m of the old Mena Gate, then they must either turn back or turn off North into the burbs. However, the Mena Gate was closed in 2025, and you need to exit at the intersection where your ride deviates from its western course. Do not walk west to the Mena Gate, lest you want to finally hear taxi drivers telling you the truth that something is closed. Instead, you must walk south for about 25 minutes (if it's hot, consider the wisdom of this) to head to the subgate that is normally used as an exit near the sphinx. Surprisingly, you can buy tickets here as well, and in fact this is a much quicker way to get to the pyramids and the sphinx than using the new main gate further on.\n\n## Pyramids\nSee also Giza with children article for practical suggestions.\nThe pyramids and associated sites are on the plateau 8 km west of Giza downtown. You'll see them looming up as you approach along Al-Haram Road. You can enter the complex by the main gate at the western terminus of that road. You'll then progress anti-clockwise through the site, eventually to exit near the Sphinx. Alternativelly, you can buy a ticket and enter near the Sphinx; however, in that case, you'll walk up the hill. Both entrances can also be used as exits.\nIgnore the nay-sayers who say this place is not worth the bother: it definitely is. It's spacious and absorbs the crowds (which are greater on Friday when Egyptians come to visit on droves.) The standard advice is to come very early to beat the crowds, who will arrive fairly soon after you. If you come in the cool months the midday sun is not hot, albeit still strong on UV. What's less obvious is whether the pyramid interiors are worth it, and you do need to come early for those. The extra admission is not too cheap and the interiors are hot, humid, cramped, claustrophobic and lacking \"atmosphere\" in any sense. The passages are steep, dusty and hard to move through, and those with any heart or lung or musculo-skeletal limitations will be miserable at best.\nIn good weather, the site is walkable if you're moderately fit -- there is no need for a camel or horse ride, and some people express concern about the way the animals are treated. You can also walk out to the west of the pyramids for a great panorama. In the heat of the summer, you may feel differently.\nIn all cases, most hustlers give up if you just wave them off with your hand and smile saying \"Thank you\". Avoid any further conversation and/or help or photos!\nThe complex is open daily 07:00-17:00 (and winter until 16:00). Individual sites within the complex may close earlier.\nEntry fees for foreigners (as of October 2024), students get 50% discount:\nGeneral admission to the complex: LE540\nEntrance to the Great (Khufu/Cheops) Pyramid : LE900\nEntrance to the Pyramid of Khafre or Menkaure: LE220\nEntrance to the Tomb of Mars Ankh: LE120\nEntrance to the Tombs of the Laborers: LE700\nAll these tickets can be bought at 29.9816231.132431 the main entrance, at the 29.9754531.1407912 Eastern entrance as well as at the entrances to the sites (but it is recommended to use the first two mentioned). Never surrender your ticket: the entrance guards will tear it and give it back to you. Anything else is a scam or a hustle.\nThe Great Pyramid interior is always open, while access to Khafre and Menkaure pyramid interiors alternates each year. Limited numbers of these extra tickets are available each day, so by mid-morning they might be all gone; there isn't a pre-booking system. No cameras are allowed into the pyramids.\n29.97972231.1344441 Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops). 8AM-noon, 1-4PM. The oldest, the largest in Egypt, and the last surviving representative of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built to a height of 146 m (479 ft), but is now slightly reduced to a still towering 137 m (449 ft). Over 2 million blocks of stone were used to construct it, all through manual labour. Entry to the interior is on the north side, facing your approach. LE900.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97160931.1278352 Queens' Pyramids and Nobles' Tombs. All over the complex, but especially around the Great Pyramid, are various of these pyramids and tombs. On its eastern flank, you'll find the burial pits for his \"solar boats\", to carry him into the afterlife. Along the west flank are noblemen's tombs, such as those of Senegemib. Several of these tombs are open to visit and usually free of tourist hordes. There's no extra charge though baksheesh may be appreciated. Enjoy the peace and quiet in the shade of one of the Queen's pyramids along the south flank of Menkaure's Pyramid to take a little break from the hustle on the plateau.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97631.1309723 Pyramid of Khafre (Pyramid of Chephren). Khafre was the son and successor of Khufu. His pyramid (at 136 m) is slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid, but it's set on higher ground so it looks larger. A few blocks of the original limestone cladding survive at its tip; once all the pyramids were fully encased in this way. Entry to the interior is on the north flank.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.972531.1283334 Pyramid of Menkaure. Menkaure was probably the son and successor of Khafre. His pyramid is the smallest here at 62 m high, originally 66.5 m. Entry to the interior is on the north flank. Along the south flank are his Queens' pyramids, and on the east flank is his funerary temple. LE220.      (updated Oct 2024)\nAncient causeways link the Khafre and Menkaure pyramids to the necropolis entrance gate next to the Sphinx. At the foot of each is another small temple dedicated to that pharaoh. The causeways are rough going so you may prefer to loop back along the paved driveway. The horse and camel-drivers will now be getting a bit desperate as you approach the exit, and will drop their prices; keep walking.\n29.9752731.137685 Great Sphinx of Giza. Like pyramids, sphinxes (ancient and modern) are found in many lands; this one is specifically the Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a single block of sandstone 45 m long by 22 m wide, bearing a man's head upon a lion's haunches. It is understood, by mainstream archeologists, to have been carved out of the bedrock in the reign of Khafre, bears his likeness, and represents a guardian spirit of the necropolis. Its original name is unknown but it was variously dubbed \"Horus of the horizon\" for the sun god or Abu el-Hol (\"Father of Terror\"). We know it by its Greek name Sphinx, which may mean \"strangler\" (as a lion crushes the neck of its prey, or the fate of those who failed to answer its riddles), or may simply mean \"carved from living rock\". Being solid, it has no inner passageways.It's a frankly mangy-looking lion and its face has always presented an irresistible target. The nose was hacked off by the 15th-century but each successive wave of rulers has blamed the previous lot: 20th-century Egyptians blamed the Brits who blamed Napoleonic troops who blamed the Ottoman Turks. The broken-off regal beard is now in the British Museum.The Sphinx faces east and you approach it, nearing the exit gate, along its north flank. This means that its main features will be in shade, you need morning light for a good photo. (Unlike the pyramids, always with one flank upturned to the sun and the deified Khufu.) To get closer you can pay extra for the enclosure just in front of its paws. There's little point in doing so, the place is crowded with people taking silly selfies, and the slightly closer view just emphasises the manginess.      (updated Oct 2024)\n\n## Grand Egyptian Museum\n29.99361131.1197226 Grand Egyptian Museum (المتحف المصري الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Miṣriyy al-Kabīr), El Remayah Square, Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, Giza (2 km northwest of the Pyramids), ☏ +20 235317344, tourism_info@easwaaqmisr.com. 09:00-17:00. The Grand Egyptian Museum is the long-awaited primary replacement for the venerable Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir, with much bigger exhibition, storage and workplace areas. It was formally opened on 1 November 2025. LE1200.      (updated Aug 2025)\n\n## At the pyramids\nBefore you get on the back of a camel or horse have a look at how they treat their animals. You might change your mind. If you anyway decide to take the offer of one of the horsemen or camel guys, make sure you discuss the price and where you go first. Ask to confirm it covers two people/two horses. Negotiate the price you want. At the end of the trip, when you get back to where you had agreed, get off the horse/camel, hand the man the agreed money and walk away. They will try to come up with all sorts of scams to get more money out of you. If you are happy and wish to give a tip, do it because you choose. Don't feel pressured into giving extra. Just walk away. They won't follow you.\nCamel rides. Avoid succumbing to the temptation of taking a camel ride around the Pyramids, if you can, the practice is noisy, smelly and overrated. Basically, there are many better places in Egypt to take a camel ride, if you must. Things are a little better run than they used to be, and the practice of taking tourists out into the desert and refusing to return unless \"tipped\" is rather rare now.\nGo horse riding in the desert to experience the spirit of the Egyptian horses and the true majesty of the Pyramids seen from outside the 'circus ring' wall. Be careful of touts, however; it's best to ride from one of the better quality stables, like FB Stables or Cairo Horse Riding School. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield on a half day trip to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out overnight with a barbecue and fire. You can also watch the Sound and Light show from FB's rooftop terrace. If you do ride with a tout (they will encourage you to do this if the area is closed for entry for example) they will make out that you will have a great view of the pyramids (which you won't), they will then charge you a fortune, ride at high speed through the streets without a helmet or any regard for safety, they will then demand a tip as you ride back and try to take you to a 'museum' which is a just shop where you will be pressured to buy.\nSee the sunrise, the first sun beams colouring the Pyramids from the terrace on the third floor of a cafe or from the roof terrace of the hostel situated near the second western entrance and ticket-office.\n[dead link] Cairo Horse Riding School, Mansouriya Road (Ext 31 Maadi Ring Road), ☏ +20 1207362425. This expat-run stable is situated inside a pristine Arabian horse ranch about ten minutes away from the Pyramids. The emphasis is on compassionate horsemanship and most of their school horses are rescues from the pyramid area which they have lovingly rehabilitated. They offer rides in the peaceful parts of the Giza desert and along countryside lanes, and longer rides to the Abu Sir Pyramid complex or jumping and dressage lessons inside their arena. (updated Mar 2017)\nFB Stables, Gamal Abdul Nasser St, Sphinx (turn left after the sphinx KFC, then right in Gamal Abdul Nasser Street -- FB is the last stables on the left), ☏ +20 106 507 0288. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, Karim at FB Stables is also great for a \"tourist\" type ride to view the Pyramids and Sphinx from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Sir can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and moonlit rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivalled views over the Pyramids: a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light shows. Great horses, and no beating.\n29.9746531.139511 [dead link] Pyramids Sound and Light Show (Son-et-Lumière) (entrance is by the Sphinx gate (i.e. the pyramids exit)), info@soundandlight.com.eg. Daily 7PM in English, 8PM in another language. Distinctly kitsch but a fun evening if you're in the right mood. The \"voice of the Sphinx\" narrates (often inaccurately) the history of the Giza necropolis and its place in Egyptian history, while a laser display picks out details of the Pyramids and projects scenes onto the side of the Great Pyramid. There are two shows each evening, the first in English and the second in another European language: free headphone translations are available if you're in the \"wrong\" show. In busier times there is a third show, but nowadays this is just (not Fridays) for special bookings, with other languages available. Bring warm clothing. The same company puts on very similar sound & light shows at Luxor-Karnak, Edfu and Philae. You could watch the whole thing cheaper, and almost as well, by eating at Pizza Hut opposite and paying a baksheesh to sit on the terrace. LE130.

The main zoo of Greater Cairo, founded in 1891. 2 km NE of Giza metro station but near the riverside, so if you're coming from downtown especially with children, it's easier to take a taxi. This is an old-fashioned zoo with a poor record for safety and animal welfare.      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.98331.137613 Mena House Oberoi Golf Course (In front of the pyramids).

An overwhelming smell will hit you as soon as you walk inside, if you can stand the smell for more than a few minutes you can find some good deals on perfume.\nLegends and Legacies, 20 Abuu Hazim St. (Off of Pyramid Road). A relaxed indoor bazaar.\nBeymen, FourSeasons Nile Plaza. Chic designer shopping including brands such Chanel, Prada, Gucci, and Christian Dior.\n\n## Eat\nWestern fast food options are located opposite the main ticket gates to the Pyramid enclosure, Pizza Hut and KFC included, so you can munch on a Tower burger and sip on a Coke in air-conditioned comfort whilst gazing on the more than 4,000-year-old Sphinx across the road. Many may prefer a more authentic experience, although the novelty of the situation could be interesting.\n\n## Budget\n29.97759931.1427981 El Gizawy restaurant, Nazlet El-Semman, Al Haram. At the pyramids entrance where the homestays are. Local specialties. The staff speaks sufficiently good English. Popular with the locals. Falafel for LE7, Egyptian pasta for LE25.

Built in 1869 as a royal lodge for King Ismail the Magnificent, this magnificent palace has housed guests including Empress Eugenie and Prince Albert. Tastefully restored and located very close to the Pyramids. Rooms in the newer Garden wing from US$150, Palace wing rooms from $210; be sure to ask for a room with a view of the Pyramids. The main Pyramids gate is a 5-minute walk away.      (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Drink\nSince Egypt is a Muslim country, alcohol is not generally permitted. It will generally only be served in hotels.\nYou might find more options in Gezira neighborhood.\n29.99061131.1343031 El Mandara Coffee Shop, Abou Al Mohsen (close to Pyramids). Local cafe with Hookahs and non-alcoholic drinks, black tea and Egyptian coffee, frequented by locals, inside and streetside sitting. LE3-10.    (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are a number of 29.97591531.1414771 accommodations near the entrance to the pyramids. You gonna find hotels, homestays and hostels, many of them with a pyramid view. A good area to stay is around the street Abou Al Hool Al Seiahi. There you find touristy and non-touristy restaurants and grocery stores around.\n\n## Cope\nDecent toilets are next to the ticket office and inside the boat museum (if you have that ticket). From the main entrance, you enter the complex and ascend the driveway towards the Great Pyramid, suitably awe-inspired, and muttering a continual \"lah shukran, lah shukran\" to dismiss the touts, guides, and offers of camels. If you do fancy a ride, see \"Do\" below.\n\n## Stay safe\nClimbing the Pyramids is dangerous and strictly illegal. It adds to wear and tear on the structure, and any stumble is likely to prove fatal. Also, it's hard gritty work and not nearly as cool as you'd imagined, so don't think about it.\nThe Giza Pyramids, being the main tourist attraction in Egypt, attract millions of tourists each year. They likewise attract a large number of the most determined opportunists for miles around. Report any instances of harassment by camel drivers and tourist touts to the black-uniformed (or white-uniformed in the summer) Tourist Police immediately, and be prepared for all manner of potential scams, possibly including \"advice\" from official-looking individuals that an attraction is closed or has an alternate entrance. Also be aware that any \"favour\" of any kind (offering directions, being shown something, etc.) might be done in expectation of a tip, so be cautious when accepting unsolicited help (although don't let your holiday be spoiled by overzealous caution, you also might encounter genuine help). Also note that some Tourist Police might routinely offer to help you in the expectation of a tip. Many known scammers will operate in front of the tourist police, who are either in on it or don't bother to intervene.\nIf on your own, headphones make the incessant \"Hello, where are you from my friend\" conversation-starters easier to ignore, smiling and pointing at the headphones seems to do the trick.\nAvoid making eye contact, starting conversations or accepting any help with taking pictures or posing for pictures for you: they will see you as an easy target for harassment.\nSay \"La Shukran\" (No thanks) as you do this, it shows you know a bit more than the average tourist and will not be seen as aggressive or rude. Smiling as you say it doesn't hurt as it doesn't seem to be seen as an invite to talk, but shows you are not trying to offend.\nBe cautious when choosing a local horse or camel ride; you may be ripped off or put in dangerous situations. The \"donkey-mafia\" that operate by the doors of the main entrance will adopt the most \"persuasive\" and often bullish techniques to get you onto their animals, and they do not appear to understand the meaning of the word \"No\". They will cause such a scene when you say no and have to get off them, which will result in you having to pay for the privilege of refusing their hospitality. Note: Some of these people were involved in the Battle of the Camels during the revolution, in which innocent civilians were killed. Use as your conscience dictates.\nAs anywhere else in Egypt, in hot months especially, take plenty of bottled water with you, wear a hat and wear sunscreen—sunglasses are also definitely a good idea.\n\n## Go next\nCairo/Downtown – where you can see the Egyptian Museum, Cairo Tower, El-Cornish, sail in Nile Cruise, hotels, restaurants, etc. Then you can go to El-Moez St., El-Hussain area, Khan El-Khalili, and Old Cairo Churches. From near the entrance of the pyramids area, take the 29.97736731.142762 city bus line 2001 to the Giza metro station or any microbus going the same way. In Google Maps, the bus stop at the pyramids is called \"bus terminal\". From the Giza station the metro brings you to Downtown cairo. Neither that city bus nor the metro have A/C, so it's just a good option in winter time. In other seasons it's better to take an Uber/Careem.",

          "content": "The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\nThe monument was sculpted from the limestone bedrock of the Eocene-aged Mokattam Formation and faces east on the Giza Plateau, on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt, the Sphinx is part of the Memphite Necropolis and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nArchaeological evidence suggests the Sphinx was created by Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khufu (c. 2590–2566 BC) or Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC). Scholars and Egyptologists believe the face of the Sphinx was carved to represent either the pharaoh Khufu or one of his sons, pharaohs Djedefre and Khafre, but a consensus has not been reached and the person(s) in whose likeness the Sphinx was carved remains in dispute.\nThe Sphinx has undergone multiple restorations, the most recent of which involved  replacing layers of limestone blocks around the base. The monument is 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head, and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.\nThe circumstances of the destruction of the Sphinx's nose are unknown, but examinations of the face have shown evidence of a deliberate act with rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, the nose was not destroyed by cannonfire from Napoleon's troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Sketches and drawings predating Napoleon clearly detail the missing nose, and the damage is referenced in descriptions by 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.\n\nNames\nThe original name the Old Kingdom creators gave the Sphinx is unknown, as the Sphinx temple, enclosure, and possibly the Sphinx itself was not completed at the time, and thus little is known about its cultural context. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity Hor-em-akhet (English: \"Horus of the Horizon\"; Hellenized: Harmachis), and the 14th century BC pharaoh Thutmose IV specifically refers to it as such in his Dream Stele.\nThe commonly used name \"Sphinx\" was given to it in classical antiquity, around 2,000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with the head of a woman, a falcon, a cat, or a sheep and the body of a lion with the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings). The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek Σφίγξ (transliterated: sphinx) apparently from the verb σφίγγω (transliterated: sphingo / English: to squeeze), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.\nMedieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrīzī, call the Sphinx by an Arabized Coptic name Belhib (Arabic: بلهيب), Balhubah (Arabic: بلهوبه) Belhawiyya (Arabic: بلهويه), which in turn comes from Pehor (Ancient Egyptian: pꜣ-Ḥwr) or Pehor(o)n (Ancient Egyptian: pꜣ-Ḥwr(w)n), a name of the Canaanite god Hauron with whom the Sphinx was identified. It is also rendered as Ablehon on a depiction of the Sphinx made by François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz. The medieval Egyptian Arabic name is Abū il-Hawl (أبو الهول), meaning \"father of terror\", which may be a folk etymological reinterpretation of the name of the god Ḥwr. In other source the medieval Egyptian Arabic name is Abul-Hun.\n\nHistory\nOld Kingdom\nThe archaeological evidence suggests the Great Sphinx was created between 2600 and 2500 BC for the king Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, or his son Khafre, the builder of the second Pyramid at Giza. The Sphinx is a monolith carved from the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. Egyptian geologist Farouk El-Baz has suggested the head of the Sphinx may have been carved first, out of a natural yardang: a ridge of bedrock sculpted by the wind. These can sometimes achieve shapes resembling animals. El-Baz suggests the \"moat\" or \"ditch\" around the Sphinx may have been quarried out later to allow for the creation of the full body of the sculpture. The stones cut from around the Sphinx's body were used to construct a temple in front of it; however, neither the enclosure nor the temple were completed, and the relative scarcity of Old Kingdom cultural material suggests a Sphinx cult was not established at the time. Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, makes note of this circumstance:\n\nTaking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre, so sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx. \nIn order to construct the temple, the northern perimeter wall of the Khafre Valley Temple had to be deconstructed; therefore, the Khafre funerary complex preceded the creation of the Sphinx and its temple. Furthermore, the angle and location of the south wall of the enclosure suggests the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid and Valley Temple already existed before the Sphinx was planned. The lower base level of the Sphinx temple also indicates it does not pre-date the Valley Temple.\n\nNew Kingdom\nSome time around the First Intermediate Period, the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and drifting sand eventually buried the Sphinx up to its shoulders. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to c. 1400 BC, when the young Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he erected a shrine housing the Dream Stele, an inscribed granite slab (possibly a repurposed door lintel from one of Khafre's temples). When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete. An excerpt reads:\n\n... the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when Ra is at the summit [of heaven]. He found that the Majesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khopri-Ra-Tum; I bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain, the supremacy over the living ... Behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect limbs. The sand of the desert whereon I am laid has covered me. Save me, causing all that is in my heart to be executed.\nThe Dream Stele associates the Sphinx with Khafre. However, this part of the text is not entirely intact:\n\nwhich we bring for him: oxen ... and all the young vegetables; and we shall give praise to Wenofer ... Khaf ... the statue made for Atum-Hor-em-Akhet.\nEgyptologist Thomas Young, finding the Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafre's name. When the stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed. Later, Ramesses II the Great (1279–1213 BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.\nIn the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god Hor-em-akhet (Hellenized: Harmachis) or \"Horus-at-the-Horizon\". The Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1,000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of Hor-em-akhet.\n\nGraeco-Roman period\nIn Graeco-Roman times, Giza had become a tourist destination—the monuments were regarded as antiquities—and some Roman emperors visited the Sphinx out of curiosity and for political reasons. The Sphinx was cleared of sand again in the first century AD in honor of Emperor Nero and the Governor of Egypt Tiberius Claudius Balbilus. A monumental stairway—more than 12 metres (39 ft) wide—was erected, leading down to a pavement in front of the paws of the Sphinx. A podium positioned at the top of the stairs allowed a view into the Sphinx sanctuary. Farther back, another podium neighbored several more steps. The stairway was dismantled during the 1931–32 excavations by Émile Baraize. Pliny the Elder describes the face of the Sphinx being colored red and gives measurements for the statue:\n\nA stela dated to 166 AD commemorates the restoration of the retaining walls surrounding the Sphinx. The last emperor connected with the monument is Septimius Severus, around 200 AD. With the downfall of Roman power, the Sphinx was once more engulfed by the sands.\n\nMiddle Ages\nSome ancient non-Egyptians saw the Sphinx as a likeness of the god Hauron. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The Sabians of Harran saw it as the burial place of Hermes Trismegistus. Arab authors describe the Sphinx as a talisman guarding the area from the desert. Al-Maqrizi describes it as the \"talisman of the Nile\" upon which locals believed the flood cycle depended. Muhammad al-Idrisi stated those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument.\n\nEarly modern period\nOver the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A description was made by John Lawson Stoddard:\n\nIt is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, – veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, – the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert – symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, European observers described the Sphinx having the face, neck and breast of a woman.  Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Benoît de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844). Most early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as \"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight-haired wig. George Sandys stated the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, and François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz described the Sphinx as having a rounded hairdo with bulky collar. Richard Pococke's Sphinx was an adaptation of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous.  The print versions of Norden's drawings for his Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie, 1755 clearly show the missing nose.\n\nModern excavations\nIn 1817, the first modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinx's chest completely.\nIn the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thûtmosis IV was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.\nOne of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eugène Grébaut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service.\n\nOpinions of early Egyptologists\nEarly Egyptologists and excavators had conflicting opinons regarding the age of the Sphinx and the associated temples. In 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated to be from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, c. 664–525 BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the stela are likely accurate, this passage is contradicted by archaeological evidence, thus considered to be Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancient history it never had. Such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines, and priests' domains fought for political attention, and for financial and economic donations.\nIn 1883, Flinders Petrie wrote, regarding the state of opinion of the age of the Khafre Valley Temple, and by extension the Sphinx: \"The date of the Granite Temple has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point. Recent discoveries, however, strongly show that it was really not built before the reign of Khafre, in the fourth dynasty.\" Gaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. Maspero concluded because the Dream Stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line 13, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors—possibly Fourth Dynasty, c. 2575–2467 BC. Maspero believed the Sphinx to be \"the most ancient monument in Egypt\".\nLudwig Borchardt attributed the Sphinx to the Middle Kingdom, arguing the particular features seen on the Sphinx are unique to the 12th dynasty and the Sphinx resembles Amenemhat III. E. A. Wallis Budge agreed the Sphinx predated Khafre's reign, writing in The Gods of the Egyptians (1904): \"This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren, and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [c. 2686 BC].\" Selim Hassan reasoned the Sphinx was erected after the completion of the Khafre pyramid complex.\n\nModern dissenting hypotheses\nRainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the nemes (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafre's father. He supports this by suggesting Khafre's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.\nIn 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafre's half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also says the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time. Egyptologist Nigel Strudwick responded to Dobrev, saying: \"It is not implausible. But I would need more explanation, such as why he thinks the pyramid at Abu Roash is a sun temple, something I'm sceptical about. I have never heard anyone suggest that the name in the graffiti at Zawiyet el-Aryan mentions Djedefre. I remain more convinced by the traditional argument of [the sphinx] being Khafre or the more recent theory of it being Khufu.\"\nGeologist Colin Reader suggests water runoff from the Giza plateau is responsible for the differential erosion on the walls of the sphinx enclosure. Because the hydrological characteristics of the area were significantly changed by the quarries, Reader contends this suggests the sphinx likely predated the quarries (and thus, the pyramids). He points towards the larger cyclopean stones in part of the Sphinx Temple, as well as the causeway alignment with the pyramids and the break in the quarries, as evidence the pyramids took the alignment with some pre-existing structure, such as the sphinx, into consideration when they were constructed, and the sphinx temple was built in two distinct phases. He contends such erosion could have occurred relatively rapidly and suggests the sphinx was no more than a few centuries older than present archaeology would suggest, suggesting a late Predynastic or Early Dynastic origin, when Ancient Egyptians already were known to be capable of sophisticated masonry.\n\nRecent restorations\nIn 1931, engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck. This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered profile. Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s and then redone in the 1990s.\n\nDegradation and violation\nThe nummulitic limestone in the area consists of layers with varying resistance to the erosion caused primarily by wind and windblown sand, resulting in the uneven degradation evident in the body of the Sphinx. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The middle body of the Sphinx has significantly disintegrated because the limestone from which it is comprised is softer than the surrounding rock, whereas the layer from which the head was sculpted is a harder limestone and therefore more resistant to erosion. Treasure hunters and tomb robbers have dug several \"dead-end\" shafts and passageways within and below the body of the Sphinx.\n\nMissing nose\nThe destruction and fate of the Sphinx's missing nose has long been the subject of myths and stories. Although false, the most popular story is the Sphinx's nose was destroyed by cannonballs fired by the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, drawings made by Frederic Louis Norden in 1737 show the Sphinx's nose missing, over 60 years before Napoleon's arrival.  Examination of the Sphinx's face shows marks made by long rods or chisels hammered into the face: one at the bridge of the nose, and another below the nostril. The nose was apparently then pried off, and the stonework crumbled as it fell or was subsequently destroyed.\nSome 10th-century Arab authors claimed the damaged nose was the result of iconoclastic attacks. Other writers have attributed the damage to the Mamluks in the 14th century. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tibrizi al-Masri (d. 1384), desecrated the sphinxes of \"Qanatir al-Siba\".\nWriting in the early 15th century, Arab historian al-Maqrīzī attributed the loss of the nose to Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr, a Sufi Muslim from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada in 1378. According to al-Maqrīzī, Sa'im al-Dahr saw local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and defaced the Sphinx in an act of iconoclasm. According to al-Maqrīzī, people living in the area believed the sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahr's act of defacement. Al-Minufi (1443–1527) wrote the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was, \"...divine retribution for Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr's breaking off the nose of a sphinx.\"\n\nBeard\nThe Sphinx may have also had a ceremonial pharaonic beard, possibly added subsequent to the original construction. If the beard had been an original part of the Sphinx, Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev suggested the beard would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling. Residue of red pigment is visible on areas of the Sphinx's face, and traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest the monument \"was once decked out in gaudy comic book colours\".\n\nHoles and tunnels\nHole in the Sphinx's head\nDuring his travels between 1565 and 1566, Johann Helffrich visited the Sphinx and described how a priest entered the head of the Sphinx, and when the priest spoke, it was as if the Sphinx itself was speaking. Many New Kingdom stelae depict the Sphinx wearing a crown. If it in fact existed, the hole could have been the anchoring point for it. Émile Baraize closed the hole with a metal hatch in 1926.\n\nPerring's Hole\nHoward Vyse directed John Shae Perring in 1837 to drill a tunnel in the back of the Sphinx, just behind the head. The boring rods became stuck at a depth of 27 feet (8.2 m). Attempts to blast the rods free caused further damage. The hole was cleared in 1978. Among the rubble was a fragment of the Sphinx's nemes headdress.\n\nMajor fissure\nA major natural fissure in the bedrock cuts through the waist of the Sphinx, first excavated by Auguste Mariette in 1853. At the top of the back it measures up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) in width. Baraize, in 1926, sealed the sides and roofed it with iron bars, limestone and cement, and installed an iron trap door at the top. The sides of the fissure might have been artificially squared; however, the bottom is irregular bedrock, about 1 metre (3.3 ft) above the outside floor. A very narrow crack continues deeper.\n\nRump passage\nIn 1926, the Sphinx was cleared of sand under direction of Baraize, which revealed an opening to a tunnel at floor-level at the north side of the rump. It was subsequently closed by masonry veneer and nearly forgotten. More than 50 years later, the existence of the passage was recalled by three elderly men who had worked during the clearing as basket carriers. This led to the rediscovery and excavation of the rump passage, in 1980.\nThe passage consists of an upper and a lower section, which are angled roughly 90 degrees to each other:\n\nThe upper part ascends to a height of 4 metres (13 ft) above the ground-floor at a northwest direction. It runs between masonry veneer and the core body of the Sphinx and ends in a niche 1 metre (3.3 ft) wide and 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) high. The ceiling of the niche consists of modern cement, which likely spilled down from the filling of the gap between masonry and core bedrock, some 3 metres (9.8 ft) above\nThe lower part descends steeply into the bedrock toward northeast, for a distance of approximately 4 metres (13 ft) and a depth of 5 metres (16 ft). It terminated in a cul-de-sac pit at groundwater level. At the entrance it is 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) wide, narrowing to about 1.07 metres (3.5 ft) towards the end. Among the sand and stone fragments, a piece of tin foil and the base of a modern ceramic water jar was found. The clogged bottom contained modern fill. Among it, more tin foil, modern cement and a pair of shoes\nIt is possible the entire passage was cut top down, beginning high up on the rump, and the current access point at floor-level was made at a later date. In his diary (February 27 and 28, 1837), Vyse noted he was \"boring\" near the tail, which indicates him as the creator of the passage, as no other tunnel has been identified at this location. Another interpretation suggests the shaft is of ancient origin, perhaps an exploratory tunnel or an unfinished tomb shaft.\n\nNiche in northern flank\nA 1925 photograph shows a man standing below floor level in a niche in the Sphinx's core body. It was closed during the 1925–1926 restorations.\n\nGap under southern large masonry box\nAnother hole might have been at floor level in the large masonry box on the south side of the Sphinx.\n\nSpace behind Dream Stele\nThe space behind the Dream Stele, between the paws of the Sphinx, was covered by an iron beam and cement roof, which was fitted with an iron trap door.\n\nKeyhole Shaft\nAt the ledge of the Sphinx enclosure, a square shaft is located opposite the northern hind paw. It was cleared during excavation in 1978 by Hawass and measures 1.42 by 1.06 metres (4.7 by 3.5 ft) and about 2 metres (6.6 ft) deep. Lehner interprets the shaft to be an unfinished tomb and named it \"Keyhole Shaft\", because of cuttings in the ledge above the shaft shaped like the lower part of a traditional (Victorian era) keyhole, upside down.\n\nPseudohistory\nAlthough numerous ideas have been suggested to explain or reinterpret the origin and identity of the Sphinx, the ideas lack sufficient evidential support and/or are contradicted by such, and are therefore considered pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.\n\nAncient astronauts/Atlantis\nIn accordance with the ancient Egyptian solar cult, the Sphinx faces east towards the rising sun. The Orion correlation theory posits the Sphinx was built and aligned to face the constellation of Leo during the vernal equinox around 10,500 BC. Since no textual, factual, or archaeological evidence supports the theory, the idea is considered pseudoarchaeology.\nThe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall, and must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafre. The hypothesis was championed by René Schwaller de Lubicz, John Anthony West, and geologist Robert M. Schoch. However, due to archaeological, climatological, and geological evidence proving otherwise, the water erosion hypothesis is considered pseudoarchaeology by mainstream scholarship.\nAmong others, H. Spencer Lewis made claims and speculated about hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx. In the 1930s, Edgar Cayce specifically predicted a \"Hall of Records\" containing knowledge from Atlantis would be discovered under the Sphinx in 1998. Cayce's prediction fueled much of the fringe speculation about the Sphinx in the 1990s, and was subsequently abandoned when the hall was not found when predicted.\nAuthor Robert K. G. Temple postulated the Sphinx was originally a statue of the jackal god of funerals Anubis, and its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple based his identification on the style of the eye make-up and headdress pleats.\n\nRacial characteristics\nUntil the early 20th century, it was suggested the face of the Sphinx had \"Negroid\" characteristics, as part of the now outdated historical race concepts.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSphinx of Memphis\nSphinx of Taharqo\nAfrican lions in culture\nLion (heraldry)\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\nList of tallest statues\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Great Sphinx of Giza at Wikimedia Commons\nRiddle of the Sphinx\nEgyptian and Greek Sphinxes\nEgypt—The Lost Civilization Theory\nThe Sphinx's Nose\nWhat happened to the Sphinx's nose?

          "summary": "The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\nThe monument was sculpted from the limestone bedrock of the Eocene-aged Mokattam Formation and faces east on the Giza Plateau, on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt, the Sphinx is part of the Memphite Necropolis and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nArchaeological evidence suggests the Sphinx was created by Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khufu (c. 2590–2566 BC) or Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC). Scholars and Egyptologists believe the face of the Sphinx was carved to represent either the pharaoh Khufu or one of his sons, pharaohs Djedefre and Khafre, but a consensus has not been reached and the person(s) in whose likeness the Sphinx was carved remains in dispute.\nThe Sphinx has undergone multiple restorations, the most recent of which involved  replacing layers of limestone blocks around the base. The monument is 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head, and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.\nThe circumstances of the destruction of the Sphinx's nose are unknown, but examinations of the face have shown evidence of a deliberate act with rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, the nose was not destroyed by cannonfire from Napoleon's troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Sketches and drawings predating Napoleon clearly detail the missing nose, and the damage is referenced in descriptions by 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.",

          "content": "The Pyramid of Djoser, sometimes called the Step Pyramid of Djoser or Step Pyramid of Horus Netjerikhet, is an archaeological site in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the ruins of Memphis. It was the first Egyptian pyramid to be built. The six-tier, four-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.\nThe pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 m (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.  As of 1997 the step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall \"Gisr el-Mudir\" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.\nIn March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.\n\nDjoser\nDjoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (c. 2670–2650 BC) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686 – c. 2125 BC). He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years. He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.\nDjoser is best known for his innovative tomb,  which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors more than a thousand years later. Djoser's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.\nThe social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering. The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human.  Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the north, rather than at Abydos.\nAlthough the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such, most Egyptologists credit Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex. This is based on the presence of his statue in the funerary complex of Djoser, his title of \"overseer of sculptors and painters\", and a comment made by the 3rd century BC historian Manetho claiming Imhotep was the \"inventor of building in stone\". Imhotep would later be deified and known as Asclepios by the Greeks.\n\nPrecedents\nDjoser's Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents. The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba S3038 (c. 2900 BC). The substructure lay in a 4 m (13 ft) deep rectangular pit, and had mudbrick walls rising to 6 m (20 ft). Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49°. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser's complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected.\n\nLayout\nDjoser's mortuary complex comprises the great trench, enclosure wall, colonnaded entrance, \"T\" temple, Sed festival complex, north and south pavilions, south tomb and court, western mounds, mortuary temple, and the crowning feature of it all, the step pyramid with its substructure. The complex was a landmark achievement for Egyptian architecture. It was the advent of the pyramidal form of the royal tomb and the first instance of the mass use of limestone in construction, replacing mudbrick which had been the staple building material prior. This shift to limestone – a hard, dense material compared to mudbrick – presented novel challenges to the architects, though they kept to earlier tradition, copying architectonic elements and carving them into the stone. For example, the Egyptians hand-carved 1,680  9 m (30 ft; 17 cu)-tall niches out of the limestone enclosure wall. In earlier projects, this element was built with wooden planks, ropes, and poles hung with reed mats. In a modern context, the same element would be built by laying out the blocks to form the recesses.\n\nStep pyramid\nThe crowning feature of the complex is the Step Pyramid which rises from the Saqqara plateau in six steps to a height between 60 m (200 ft; 110 cu) and 62.5 m (205 ft; 119.3 cu). This element was revised repeatedly in construction, going through a series of developmental phases that culminated in its step pyramidal form. These phases are traditionally labelled, following Jean-Philippe Lauer's excavations: M1, M2, M3, P1, P1', and P2.\nIn the early stages (M1 to M3) the structure had the form of a mastaba before alterations (P1 to P2) were made to create its step pyramidal form. In the first stage (M1), the mastaba had a square plan 63 m (207 ft; 120 cu) in length that rose to a height of 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu). This was built from a core of limestone blocks arranged in horizontal beds and bound with yellow or red clay. A 2.6 m (9 ft; 5 cu) thick casing of fine white Tura limestone was applied to the core arranged in the same horizontal manner. The outer blocks were inclined to ~82° and the top of the mastaba likely had a slightly convex shape. A second casing of fine white limestone was applied to this which increased the mastaba's base length to 71.5 m (235 ft; 136 cu) square (M2). The casing was 4.2 m (14 ft; 8 cu) thick at the base and 3.4 m (11 ft; 6.5 cu) thick at the peak and was about 0.525 m (2 ft; 1 cu) lower than the initial mastaba height. The outer blocks of this second coat also had a steeper incline at ~76°. The mastaba was then extended 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu) east to cover a series of eleven shafts 33 m (108 ft; 63 cu) deep that ended in passages that led west to the burial chambers of members of Djoser's family. This extension was built from locally sourced limestone rubble and cased by 1.5 m (5 ft; 3 cu) thick limestone coating that formed an extension of M2. The mastaba had a new, rectangular ground plan 71.5 m (235 ft; 136 cu) by 79.5 m (261 ft; 152 cu). At this stage the mastaba still peaked at 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu) in height, too short to be seen from outside the 10.5 m (34 ft; 20 cu) high enclosure wall.\nEgyptologists are split on the motivations behind the conception of the pyramidal form that the mastaba was converted into. Lauer believed that the alteration was made to have the tomb visible from Memphis. The fact of the mastaba's square plan led Rainer Stadelmann, however, to suggest that it was never the intended final form and that it was planned to be a pyramid from the outset. The conversion (P1) encased the mastaba (M3) extending its length by 5.76 m (19 ft; 11 cu) on each axis giving it a base length of 85.5 m (281 ft; 163 cu) by 77 m (253 ft; 147 cu). The alteration from mastaba to pyramid came with a shift in construction. The builders used larger and better quality, roughly dressed limestone blocks – but instead of horizontal beds, they built successive inclined accretion layers 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) thick. These leaned on each other from opposite ends providing greater stability preventing a collapse. The whole was then cased in fine white limestone with a layer of packing in between. This phase of the pyramid had four steps that rose to a height of 42 m (138 ft; 80 cu). The decision was then made to expand the pyramid north and west from four to six steps (P1') which was then finished with a final layer of limestone casing (P2) that gave the pyramid its final form. On completion the step pyramid had a base length of 109 m (358 ft; 208 cu) by 121 m (397 ft; 231 cu) that rose to a height of 60–62.5 m (197–205 ft; 115–119 cu) and occupied a volume of 330,400 m3 (11,670,000 cu ft).\nMuch of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench. It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid, and many plausible models have been suggested. For transport, apparatuses like rollers were used in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled.\n\nPyramid substructure\nUnder the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6 km in length and connect to a central shaft 7 m square and 28 m deep. These spaces provide room for the king's burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings. The entrance to the 28 m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. These \"palace façade\" walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb-sed. Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal ka.\nOn the east side of the pyramid, eleven shafts 32 m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for royal family members. These were incorporated into the pre-existing substructure as it expanded eastward. In the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found, many of which predate Djoser. These would have served Djoser's visceral needs in the afterlife. An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these. Shafts I–V were used for the burials of royal family members; shafts VI–XI were used as symbolic tombs for the grave goods of royal ancestors from dynasties I–II. More than 40,000 vessels, bowls and vases made of various kinds of stone were found in these galleries. Royal names such as of kings Den, Semerkhet, Nynetjer and Sekhemib were incised on the pots. It is now thought that Djoser once restored the original tombs of the ancestors, and then sealed the grave goods in the galleries in an attempt to save them.\n\nBurial chamber\nThe burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial. No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition. The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity.\n\nPyramid complex\nDjoser's Step Pyramid complex included several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. A pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive beyond the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (that were not tombs) were built in the provinces. Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king's ascension to join the eternal North Star.\nThe main modern excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean-Philippe Lauer, a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex. The complex covers 15 ha (37 acres) and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis. Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north–south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east–west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.\n\nGreat trench\nBefore the enclosure wall, Djoser's pyramid complex is surrounded by a trench dug into the underlying rock. At 750 m (2,460 ft; 1,430 cu) long and 40 m (130 ft; 76 cu) wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular in shape, oriented on the north–south axis. The trench resembles a 𓉔 (hieroglyph h) which represents the floorplan of a house. It is decorated with niches which are suggested by Nabil Swelim to have hosted the spirits of members of the king's court, there to serve the king in his afterlife. In parts, the trench doubles into two with distinct entries. These make accessing the enclosure wall more difficult, indicating its function as a safe-guard. Miroslav Verner suspects that a single entrance was built at the south-east corner granting access to the area.\n\nEnclosure wall\nThe complex is enclosed by a wall 10.5 m (34 ft) high that stretched for over 1.6 km (0.99 mi). This wall was built from a thick core of masonry that was encased with Tura limestone, wholly on the outside but partially on the inside. The external façade of the wall had a bastion at a regular interval of 4.1 m (13 ft) adorned with 1,680 hand-carved niches 9 m (30 ft) tall. Fourteen of these bastions were larger than the rest. These hosted false double-doors, while a fifteenth situated in the south-east corner of the east façade held the real entrance. The entrance was flanked by two towers leading to a passage past which lay the colonnaded entrance.\nThe enclosure wall design recalls the appearance of First Dynasty tombs, such as those found directly north of the complex and at Abydos. Alan Spencer compares the design to the panelled construction of the palace façade, which imitates bound bundles of reeds. Jean-Philippe Lauer suggests that the wall was modelled after the \"White Walls\" of Memphis, though Verner notes that the presence of so many doors renders this unlikely. Hermann Kees thought the fifteen doors were related to the sed festival and indicated its duration as being half a lunar month. The remaining doors are known as false doors, and were meant for the king's use in the afterlife. They functioned as portals through which the king's ka could pass between life and the afterlife.\n\nEntrance colonnade\nThe entrance colonnade led from the enclosure wall to the south court of the complex. It comprises two distinct passageways oriented approximately east–west. The first is a narrow 1.05 m (3.4 ft) wide by 6 m (20 ft) long corridor cut into the enclosure walls bastion. The ceiling blocks here were carved into the shape of tree trunks. This is followed by a wider corridor flanked by 40 limestone columns, arranged in pairs, that fronted projecting walls, which formed alcoves. The columns were each nearly 6 m (20 ft) tall and were fashioned to resemble bundled reeds that had between seventeen and nineteen ribs. They supported a limestone ceiling whose blocks carved again into the form of palm tree trunks. There are 24 alcoves which are suggested to have held statues of the king or perhaps, because of their number, a double statue of the king and a nome deity. Such statues are present in the monuments of the Fourth Dynasty, but no trace of them has been uncovered at Djoser's complex. The end walls of the alcoves had slits cut into them near the ceiling thus allow light to filter in. Near the beginning of the colonnade, at its eastern end, is a corridor which leads to the heb-sed court. Between the twelfth and thirteenth alcove is a \"transverse vestibule\" with a passage flanked by eight 5 m (16 ft) tall columns and cross-walls leading to a sanctuary. Lauer believes this chamber contained a statue of Djoser on a pedestal that bore his name and Imhotep's titles. The torso and base of this statue were found in the entrance colonnade. The west wall of the entrance colonnade has the form of an open door which leads into the south court.\n\nSouth court\nThe south court is a large court between the south tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife. At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.\n\nSouth tomb\nThe south tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king's organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.\nThe substructure of the south tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30 m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues east and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid.\nCurrent evidence suggests that the south tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king's inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed. Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife.\n\nNorth temple and serdab court\nThe northern (funerary/mortuary) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue. The king's ka inhabited the ka statue, in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab. This temple appeared on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set. In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the pyramid, where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.\n\nHeb-sed court\nThe Heb-sed court is rectangular and parallel to the South Courtyard. It was meant to provide a space in which the king could perform the Heb-sed ritual in the afterlife. Flanking the east and west sides of the court are the remains of two groups of chapels, many of which are dummy buildings, of three different architectural styles. At the north and south ends there are three chapels with flat roofs and no columns. The remaining chapels on the west side are decorated with fluted columns and capitals flanked by leaves. Each of the chapels has a sanctuary accessed by a roofless passage with walls that depict false doors and latches. Some of these buildings have niches for statues. Egyptologists believe that these buildings were related to the important double coronation of the king during the Heb-sed.\n\nSee also\nEgyptian pyramid construction techniques\nList of Egyptian pyramids\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nVirtual exploration of the colonnade\nVirtual exploration of the southern entrance of the Step Pyramid\nVirtual exploration of the burial chamber",
          "summary": "The Pyramid of Djoser, sometimes called the Step Pyramid of Djoser or Step Pyramid of Horus Netjerikhet, is an archaeological site in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the ruins of Memphis. It was the first Egyptian pyramid to be built. The six-tier, four-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.\nThe pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 m (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.  As of 1997 the step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall \"Gisr el-Mudir\" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.\nIn March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.",

It is known chiefly for several pyramids, mainly Sneferu's Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613 to 2589 BC.\n\nPyramids\nThe Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza; the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing to this date.\nThe first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name \"the Bent Pyramid\".\nRealizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. Once completed, the pyramid was considered to be a success, as it was a fully constructed, smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees. The Red Pyramid's name derives from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.\n\nAnother pyramid, the White Pyramid, located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it (sand on the outside and limestone on the inside). The weather caused the sand to erode from it, but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.\nKing Senusret III (1878–1839 BC) had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses; Sit-Hathor and Merit.\nThe Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nSeveral other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the Pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri, the archaeologist who excavated this site.\n\nTombs and cemeteries\nLocated closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king's daughters (Sithathor). Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur's pyramids. Dahshur was Egypt's royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.\n\nContemporary history\nIn July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 120 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim Arab clan member to death. Furthermore, during clashes another Muslim suffered head injuries and later died due to a gasoline bomb being thrown from a rooftop of a building. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.\nAs of January 2013, and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the 2011 uprising, the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.\n\nClimate\nDahshur has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.\n\nSee also\nMemphite Necropolis\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nList of megalithic sites\nAcanthus (Egypt), an old village in Dahshur mentioned in Ancient Greek literature.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nInformation about Dahshur on the website of the German Archaeological Institute\nPhotos from inside the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur\nDahshur - Pyramid Breeding Ground\nDahshur\nNational Geographic Video on the Dahshur Pyramids",

Visitor numbers are much smaller, queues are way shorter and there is far less hassle.\nInscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, Dahshur formed part of the extensive necropolis of ancient Memphis during the Old Kingdom - the so-called \"Pyramid Age\". The pharaoh Sneferu (sometimes spelt Snofru), founder of the 4th Dynasty and the father to Khufu - builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza) - managed to erect two complete pyramids at the location, in addition to completing another pyramid (for his predecessor Huni) at Meidum. In sheer volume alone, the father definitely out-did his son!\nSomewhat later, Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom's 12th Dynasty erected their own pyramids at the locality - though on a greatly reduced scale.\nDahshur is very much off the traditional tourist trail around Cairo, having been a restricted military zone until 1996. The Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities is encouraging travellers to visit Dahshur, in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure on the Giza pyramids.\n\n## By tour\nA number of hotels and travel agencies, in Cairo and Giza, offer guided coach tours to Dahshur.\n\n## By taxi\nDahshur is probably best accessed by hired taxi from Cairo, usually as an extension to a day trip to Saqqara and/or Memphis.\n\n## By train\nThere is at least one local train from Ramses Station in Cairo, no. 142 to Al Fayoum aka Fayum, which starts at 8:45AM and also stops in Al Mazghona (LE3). From Mazghona take a tuk-tuk (LE15 as of Jan 2018) to the entrance of the Dashure area.\n29.808531.27121 Al-Marazik railway station (محطة المرازيق).

Tuk-tuks aren't allowed into the site, which is a 30-min walk from the gate to the Red Pyramid, and another 20 minutes walk to the Bent Pyramid, with no shade.\n\n## Fees and hours\nThe 29.8081631.229771 ticket office is about 1 km northwest of Dahshur village, right behind the police checkpoint.\nThe Dahshur Necropolis site is open daily 8AM-5PM.

The pyramid field extends over 3.5 km north to south, which can be walked or done with the vehicle you arrived with, but as 11/2024 only Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid are reachable by tourists (there are no trail to walk, and guards prevent you even to try).\n\n## See\n29.80858831.206151 Red Pyramid (North Pyramid). Also named the Red Pyramid of Sneferu is Egypt's oldest true pyramid (without steps, without bends), probably on account of the red hues of its weathered limestone, now exposed to the elements after the original hard white limestone casing was removed (probably in late antiquity or the medieval period). Some say, however, that the 'red' designation may stem from red graffiti and building marks found around the structure. Well preserved, the Red Pyramid was probably built after the Bent Pyramid, the architects apparently learning from the alterations necessary in the earlier structure, and incorporating the same gentle 43 degree angle used in the upper portion of the Bent Pyramid to construct the Red Pyramid in its entirety. The interior of the Red Pyramid is accessible to the public, after scaling 125 steps. A long, slanting corridor (63 m) leads visitors down to three interior chambers: two antechambers with 12-m-high corbelled vaults and a 15 m high burial chamber with a corbelled ceiling. Human remains, perhaps those of Sneferu, were found in this location. The guy at the pyramid tunnel entrance will request a baksheesh, but the inside is included in your ticket, and you do not have to give him anything just for sitting there..

          "content": "The Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, is an area in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the Twentieth Dynasty, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles under the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nIt is a wadi sitting on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and within the heart of the Theban Necropolis. There are two main sections: the East Valley, where the majority of the royal tombs are situated; and the West Valley, otherwise known as the Valley of the Monkeys.\nWith the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances, the Valley of the Kings is known to contain 65 tombs and chambers, ranging in size from the simple pit that is KV54 to the complex tomb that is KV5, which alone has over 120 chambers for the sons of Ramesses II. It was the principal burial place for the New Kingdom's major royal figures as well as a number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with traditional scenes from Egyptian mythology and reveal clues to the period's funerary practices and afterlife beliefs. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of Egypt's pharaohs.\nThis area has been a focus for Egyptologists and archaeological exploration since the end of the 18th century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. The Valley of the Kings garnered significant attention following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the rest of the Theban Necropolis. Exploration, excavation, and conservation continues in the area and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.\n\nGeology\nThe Valley of the Kings is situated over 1,000 feet of limestone and other sedimentary rock, which form the cliffs in the valley and the nearby Deir el-Bahari, interspersed with soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35 and 56 million years ago during a time when the Mediterranean Sea sometimes extended as far south as Aswan. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is now little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods. These floods dump tons of debris into the open tombs.\nThe quality of the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely grained to coarse stone, the latter with the potential to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction (and in modern times, conservation) difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered. Builders took advantage of available geological features when constructing the tombs. Some tombs were quarried out of existing limestone clefts, others behind slopes of scree, and some were at the edge of rock spurs created by ancient flood channels.\nThe problems of tomb construction can be seen with the tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but unintentionally broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, probably due to the quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).\nBetween 1998 and 2002, the Amarna Royal Tombs Project investigated the valley floor using ground-penetrating radar and found that, below the modern surface, the Valley's cliffs descend beneath the scree in a series of abrupt, natural \"shelves\", arranged one below the other, descending several metres to the bedrock in the valley floor.\n\nHydrology\nThe area of the Theban hills is subject to infrequent, violent thunderstorms causing flash floods in the valley. Recent studies have shown that there are at least seven active flood stream beds leading down into the central area of the valley. This central area appears to have been flooded at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, with several tombs buried under metres of debris. The tombs KV55, KV62, and KV63 are dug into the actual wadi bedrock rather than the debris, showing that the level of the valley was five meters below its present level. After this event, later dynasties levelled the floor of the valley, making the floods deposit their load further down the valley, and the buried tombs were forgotten and only discovered in the early 20th century. This was the area that was the subject of the Amarna Royal Tombs Project ground-scanning radar investigation, which showed several anomalies, one of which was proved to be KV63.\n\nHistory\nThe Theban Hills are dominated by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or \"The Peak\". It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and it is probable that this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, more than a thousand years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.\nWhile the iconic pyramid complex of the Giza Plateau have come to symbolize ancient Egypt, the majority of tombs were cut into rock. Most pyramids and mastabas contain sections which were cut into ground level, and there are full rock-cut tombs in Egypt that date back to the Old Kingdom.\nAfter the defeat of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to construct elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose I and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).\n\nI saw to the excavation of the rock-tomb of his majesty, alone, no one seeing, no one hearing.\nThe Valley was used for primary burials from approximately 1539 BC to 1075 BC. It contains at least 63 tombs, beginning with Thutmose I (or possibly earlier, during the reign of Amenhotep I) and ending with Ramesses X or XI, although non-royal burials continued in usurped tombs.\nDespite its name, the Valley of the Kings also contains the tombs of favorite nobles as well as the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Therefore, only about twenty of the tombs actually contain the remains of kings. The remains of nobles and of the royal family, together with unmarked pits and embalming caches, make up the rest. Around the time of Ramesses I (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate Valley of the Queens.\n\nRoyal Necropolis\nThe official name for the site in ancient times was The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health in The West of Thebes (see below for the hieroglyphic spelling), or Ta-sekhet-ma'at (the Great Field).\n\nAt the start of the Eighteenth Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, it was in a small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was constructed in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return to religious orthodoxy at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.\nThe Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties saw an increase in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with Ramesses II and later Ramesses III each constructing a massive tomb used for the burial of their sons (KV5 and KV3 respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II was buried in the nearby Western Wadis (although his mummy was included in the Deir el-Bahari tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have been buried elsewhere.\nIn the Pyramid Age, the pyramid tomb of a king was associated with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. Since the tombs of the kings in the Valley of the Kings were hidden, the kings' mortuary temples were located away from their burial sites, closer to the cultivation facing Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.\nThe tombs were constructed and decorated by the workers of the village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite well known due to their being recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded workers' strike, detailed in the Turin Strike Papyrus.\n\nExploration of the valley\nThe valley has been a major focus of modern Egyptological exploration for the last two centuries. Prior to this time, it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times). The area illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole Theban Necropolis. Despite the exploration and investigation noted below, only eleven of the tombs have actually been completely recorded.\nMany of the tombs have graffiti written by those ancient tourists. Jules Baillet has located over 2,100 Greek and Latin instances of graffiti, along with a smaller number in Phoenician, Cypriot, Lycian, Coptic, and other languages. The majority of the ancient graffiti is found in KV9, which contains just under a thousand of them. The earliest positively dated graffiti dates to 278 BC.\nIn 1799, members of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt (especially Vivant Denon) drew maps and plans of the known tombs, and for the first time noted the Western Valley (where Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage located the tomb of Amenhotep III, WV22). The Description de l'Égypte contains two volumes (out of a total of 24) on the area around Thebes.\nEuropean exploration continued in the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century. Early in the century, the area was visited by Giovanni Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt. John Gardner Wilkinson, who lived in Egypt from 1821 to 1832, copied many of the inscriptions and artwork in the tombs that were open at the time. The decipherment of hieroglyphs, though still incomplete during Wilkinson's stay in the valley, enabled him to assemble a chronology of New Kingdom rulers based on the inscriptions in the tombs. He also established the system of tomb numbering that has been in use, with additions, ever since.\nThe second half of the century saw a more concerted effort to preserve, rather than simply gather, antiquities. Auguste Mariette's Egyptian Antiquities Service started to explore the valley, first with Eugène Lefébure in 1883, then Jules Baillet and Georges Bénédite in early 1888, and finally Victor Loret in 1898 to 1899. Loret added a further 16 tombs to the list, and explored several tombs that had already been discovered. During this time Georges Daressy explored KV9.\n\nWhen Gaston Maspero was reappointed as head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, the nature of the exploration of the valley changed again. Maspero appointed English archaeologist Howard Carter as the Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt, and the young man discovered several new tombs and explored several others, clearing KV42 and KV20.\nAround the start of the 20th century, American explorer Theodore M. Davis held the excavation permit for the valley. His team (led mostly by Edward R. Ayrton) discovered several royal and non-royal tombs (including KV43, KV46 and KV57). In 1907, they discovered the possible Amarna Period cache in KV55. After finding what they thought was all that remained of the burial of Tutankhamun (items recovered from KV54 and KV58), it was announced that the valley was completely explored and that no further burials were to be found. Davis's 1912 publication, The Tombs of Harmhabi and Touatânkhamanou closes with the comment, \"I fear that the Valley of Kings is now exhausted.\"\nAfter Davis's death early in 1915, Lord Carnarvon acquired the concession to excavate the valley, and he employed Howard Carter to explore it. After a systematic search, they discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922.\nVarious expeditions have continued to explore the valley, adding greatly to the knowledge of the area. In 2001 the Theban Mapping Project designed new signs for the tombs, providing information and plans of the open tombs.\n\nTomb development\nLocation\nThe earliest tombs were located in cliffs at the top of scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually moving back up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.\n\nArchitecture\nThe usual tomb plan consisted of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, the corridors turn 90 degrees at least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as \"Bent Axis\", After the burial, the upper corridors were meant to be filled with rubble and the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate \"Jogged Axis\" (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this layout and is one of the tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally \"Straight Axis\" of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the \"well\", which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a \"magical\" purpose later as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated (by the builders), but the well room was still present.\n\nDecoration\nThe majority of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from Amduat ('That Which is in the Underworld'), which describes the journey of the sun god through the twelve hours of the night. From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated with the Book of Gates, which shows the sun god passing through the twelve gates that divide the nighttime and ensures the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. These earliest tombs were generally sparsely decorated, and those of a non-royal nature were totally undecorated.\nLate in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which divided the underworld into massive caverns containing deities as well as the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.\nThe ceilings of the burial chambers were decorated (from the burial of Seti I onwards) with what became formalised as the Book of the Heavens, which again describes the sun's journey through the twelve hours of night. Again from Seti I's time, the Litany of Re, a lengthy hymn to the sun god began to appear.\n\nTomb equipment\nEach burial was provided with equipment that would enable a comfortable existence in the afterlife. Also present in the tombs were items used to perform magic rituals, such as shabtis and divine figurines. Some of the items may have been used by the king during his lifetime (Tutankhamun's sandals for example), and some were specially constructed for the burial.\n\nTomb numbering\nThe modern abbreviation \"KV\" stands for \"Kings' Valley\". In 1827, Wilkinson painted KV numbers over the entrances to the 21 tombs that lay open in the East Valley at that time, beginning at the valley entrance and moving southward, and labeled four tombs in the West Valley as WV1 through WV4. The tombs in the West Valley were later incorporated into the East Valley numbering system as WV22 through WV25, and tombs that have been opened since Wilkinson's time have been added to the list. The numbers range from KV1 (Rameses VII) to KV64 (discovered in 2011). Since the early 19th century AD, antiquarians and archaeologists have cleared and recorded tombs, with a total of 61 sepulchers being known by the start of the 20th century. KV5 was only rediscovered in the 1990s after being dismissed as unimportant by previous investigators. Some of the tombs have ambiguous burial contexts, others remain unidentifiable as regards to their owners, and still others appear to be unfinished, reused, or of unknown function.\n\nEighteenth Dynasty\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty tombs within the valley vary quite a bit in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, twisting and turning down over 200 metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97 metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.\nPerhaps the most imposing tomb of this period is that of Amenhotep III, WV22, located in the West Valley. It was re-investigated in the 1990s by a team from Waseda University, Japan, but it is not open to the public.\nAt the same time, powerful and influential nobles began to be buried with the royal family; the most famous of these tombs is the joint tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46. They were possibly the parents of Queen Tiy. Until the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, this was the best-preserved of the tombs that had been discovered in the Valley.\n\nAmarna Period\nThe return of royal burials to Thebes after the end of the Amarna Period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the intermediate 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it is no more than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style), but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.\n\nThe other Amarna Period tombs are located in a smaller, central area in the centre of the East Valley, with a possible mummy cache (KV55) that may contain the burials of several Amarna Period royals – Tiy and Smenkhkare or Akhenaten.\nIn close proximity is the burial of Tutankhamun, perhaps the most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered by Howard Carter on 4 November 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. Until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it was considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.\nIn the same central area as KV62 and KV63, is \"KV64\", a radar anomaly believed to be a tomb or chamber announced on 28 July 2006. It was not an official designation, and the actual existence of a tomb at all was dismissed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, prior to finally excavating and describing it during 2011–2012.\nThe nearby tomb of Horemheb, (KV57) is rarely open to visitors, but it has many unique features and is extensively decorated. The decoration shows a transition from the pre-Amarna tombs to those of the 19th dynasty tombs that followed.\n\nNineteenth Dynasty\nThe Nineteenth Dynasty saw a further standardisation of tomb layout and decoration. The tomb of the first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due to the early death of the king and is little more than a truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.\nHis son and successor, Seti I's tomb KV17 (also known as Belzoni's tomb, the tomb of Apis, or the tomb of Psammis, son of Necho), is usually regarded as the finest tomb in the valley. It has extensive relief work and paintings. When it was rediscovered by Belzoni in 1817, he referred to it as \"a fortunate day.\"\nThe son of Seti, Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great), constructed a massive tomb, KV7, but it is in a ruinous state. It is currently undergoing excavation and conservation by a Franco-Egyptian team led by Christian Leblanc. The tomb is vast in size, about the same length, and a larger area, of the tomb of his father.\n\nAt the same time, and just opposite his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb of an unknown Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.\nRamesses II's son and eventual successor, Merenptah's tomb has been open since antiquity; it extends 160 metres, ending in a burial chamber that once contained a set of four nested sarcophagi. Well decorated, it is typically open to the public most years.\nThe last kings of the dynasty also constructed tombs in the valley, all of which follow the same general pattern of layout and decoration. Notable amongst these is the tomb of Siptah, which is well decorated, especially the ceiling.\n\nTwentieth Dynasty\nThe first ruler of the dynasty, Setnakhte, had two tombs constructed for himself. He started excavating the eventual tomb of his son, Ramesses III, but abandoned that dig when it unintentionally broke into another tomb. He then usurped and completed the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty female pharaoh, Twosret, KV14. Therefore, this tomb has two burial chambers, the later extensions making this one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 150 metres. KV11 was later restarted and extended and on a different axis for Ramesses III.\n\nThe tomb of Ramesses III (KV11, known as Bruce's Tomb or The Harper's Tomb due to its decoration) is one of the largest tombs in the valley and is open to the public. It is located close to the central 'rest–area', and its location and superb decoration make this one of the tombs most visited by tourists.\nThe successors and offspring of Ramesses III constructed tombs that had straight axes. They all had similar decorations. Notable amongst these is KV2, the tomb of Ramesses IV, which has been open since antiquity, containing a large amount of hieratic graffiti. The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from several religious texts. The joint tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, KV9 (also known as the Tomb of Memnon or La Tombe de la Métempsychose) is decorated with many sunk-relief carvings, depicting illustrated scenes from religious texts. Open since antiquity, it contains over a thousand examples of graffiti written in ancient Greek, Latin and Coptic. The spoil from the excavation and later clearance of this tomb, together with later construction of workers huts, covered the earlier burial of KV62 and seems to have been what protected that tomb from earlier discovery and looting.\n\nThe tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, has been open since antiquity, as can be seen by the graffiti left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors. Located in the central part of the valley, it is between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within the tomb indicate that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.\nAnother notable tomb from this dynasty is KV19, the tomb of Mentuherkhepshef (son of Ramesses IX). This small tomb is simply a converted, unfinished corridor, but the decoration is extensive. The tomb has been newly restored and opened for visitors.\n\nTwenty-first Dynasty and the decline of the necropolis\nBy the end of the New Kingdom, Egypt had entered a long period of political and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made at the start of the Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. Most of the treasure was removed from the tombs. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bahari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.\nDuring the later Third Intermediate Period and later periods, intrusive burials were introduced into many of the open tombs. In Coptic times, some of the tombs were used as churches, stables, and even houses.\n\nMinor tombs in the Valley of the Kings\nThe majority of the 65 numbered tombs in the Valley of the Kings can be considered as minor tombs, either because at present they have yielded little information or because the results of their investigations were only poorly recorded by their explorers. Some have received very little attention or were only cursorily noted. Most of these tombs are small, often consisting of only a single burial chamber accessed by a shaft or staircase with a corridor or a series of corridors leading to the chamber.\nNonetheless, some are larger, multiple-chambered tombs. These minor tombs served various purposes: some were intended for burials of lesser royalty or private burials, some contained animal burials, and others apparently never received a primary burial. In many cases these tombs also served secondary functions, and later intrusive material has been found related to these secondary activities. While some of these tombs have been open since antiquity, the majority were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries during the height of exploration in the valley.\n\nTomb robbers\nAlmost all tombs throughout Egypt have been robbed. Several papyri have been found that describe the trials of tomb robbers. These date mostly from the late Twentieth Dynasty. One of these, Papyrus Mayer B, describes the robbery of the tomb of Ramesses VI and was probably written during year eight or nine of Ramesses X, around 1118 BC.\n\nThe foreigner Nesamun took us up and showed us the tomb of King Ramesses VI ... And I spent four days breaking into it, we being present all five. We opened the tomb and entered it. ... We found a cauldron of bronze, three wash bowls of bronze ... Confessing to their crimes, the thief goes on to add that a small quarrel arose amongst the robbers when it came to equally dividing the spoils collected from the tomb.\nTombs were filled with valuables, therefore a prime motivation to rob them. Thieves often looted the chambers and bodies of mummies and took with them precious metals and stones, the most common gold and silver, linens and ointments or unguents. Often tombs were robbed when they were still fresh because many of the valuables buried with the mummies were perishable.\nThe valley also seems to have suffered an official plundering during the virtual civil war, which started during the reign of Ramesses XI. The tombs were opened, all the valuables were removed, and the mummies were collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of Amenhotep II, contained sixteen mummies, and others were hidden within Amenhotep I's tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the Deir el-Bahari cache, containing no fewer than forty royal mummies and their coffins. Only tombs whose locations were lost (KV62, KV63 and KV46, although both KV62 and KV46 were robbed soon after their actual closure) were undisturbed during this period.\nTombs were ransacked for their valuables but also for their original primary purpose. Once robbed, an empty tomb could be used as a burial place for another mummy, which is exactly what happened in the smallest of the pyramids of Giza.\n\nTourism\nMost of the tombs are not open to the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and officials occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb – that of Ay – and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration.\nIn 1997, 58 tourists and four Egyptians were massacred at nearby Deir el-Bahari by Islamist militants from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. This led to an overall drop in tourism in the area.\nOn most days of the week an average of 4,000 to 5,000 tourists visit the main valley. The West Valley is much less visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.\n\nSee also\nRoyal Wadi and tombs – Burial place of Akhenaten and his royal family.\nNaqsh-e Rostam – Persian \"Valley of the Kings\" royal tombs.\nMing and Qing Imperial Tombs – Royal tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\nSacred Valley (Peru)\nBurial place of Genghis Khan – An undiscovered place of burial of Genghis Khan and his royal family.\nValley of the Kings (Tibet)\nPetra – Wadi lined with rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\n\"Theban Mapping Project\".

          "summary": "The Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, is an area in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the Twentieth Dynasty, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles under the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nIt is a wadi sitting on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and within the heart of the Theban Necropolis. There are two main sections: the East Valley, where the majority of the royal tombs are situated; and the West Valley, otherwise known as the Valley of the Monkeys.\nWith the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances, the Valley of the Kings is known to contain 65 tombs and chambers, ranging in size from the simple pit that is KV54 to the complex tomb that is KV5, which alone has over 120 chambers for the sons of Ramesses II. It was the principal burial place for the New Kingdom's major royal figures as well as a number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with traditional scenes from Egyptian mythology and reveal clues to the period's funerary practices and afterlife beliefs. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of Egypt's pharaohs.\nThis area has been a focus for Egyptologists and archaeological exploration since the end of the 18th century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. The Valley of the Kings garnered significant attention following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the rest of the Theban Necropolis. Exploration, excavation, and conservation continues in the area and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.",

          "content": "## Overview\nThe Valley of the Kings (Arabic: Wadi el-Muluk, وادي الملوك; also known as Biban el-Moluk, the \"Gates of the Kings\") is an Egyptian archaeological locality in the hills immediately behind the West Bank of Luxor. As such, it is one of the most remarkable archaeological destinations in the world - the burial place of most of the pharaohs of Egypt of the New Kingdom.\n\n## Understand\nThe tombs within the Valley are designated by a KV number, standing for \"King's Valley\". The tomb of Tutankhamun, for example, is also known as KV62. On the other hand, the tombs in the Western Valley have been catalogued under WV numbers (WV = Western Valley).\nArchaeological excavations continue periodically within the Valley of the Kings; perhaps best known is the American University of Cairo's excavation of KV5, the tomb of the Sons of Ramesses II. Director of this excavation is Professor Kent Weeks, also director of the Theban Mapping Project, granted the permit to map the Theban Necropolis in its entirety - a project now well advanced.\n\n## Entrance and hours\nOpening hours: Summer daily 6AM–5PM; Winter daily 6AM–4PM.\nAdmission: LE260 (Dec 2022) for three tombs of your choice (those wishing to view more than 3 tombs must purchase additional tickets).\n\n## Get in\nBy taxi or bike are the preferred choices, see West Bank.\n\n## See\nMany of the tombs in the Valley are closed to the public periodically for resting and renovation.\nInformation within the Valley has been vastly improved: (mostly) gone are the old faded signs, now replaced by engraved metal signs detailing the history, architecture and decoration of each tomb, together with detailed plans and diagrams (these have been provided by the Theban Mapping Project, in association with the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities).\nTo get the best understanding of the tombs within the Valley of the Kings, visit at least one tomb from each of the three main building phases (see below).\n\n## Tutankhamun\n25.74036132.6014441 Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king. Compared to most of the other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration. Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the mummy done during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible. The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Visitors with limited time would be best to spend their time elsewhere. LE250 extra ticket.      (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Phase One Tombs\n25.7532.61432 Tomb of Thutmose III (KV34). One of the most remote tombs in the Valley, at the far end of the Valley and up several flights of steps to gain entry. The climb is worth it though. The tomb is of the typical, early curved plan with a large oval burial chamber. The decoration is unique, being in a simple, pleasing style that resembles the cursive writing of the time.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.7532.61433 Tomb of Thutmose IV (KV43). High in the cliffs above the valley floor, it had been spared the extensive flood-water damage suffered by other tombs, and its wall decorations are consequently very well preserved. The pharaoh's outer stone sarcophagus is also still in place in the burial chamber.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.74083332.6027814 Tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu (KV46). The tomb of Yuya and his wife Tjuyu, the parents of Queen Tiye, the wife of Amenhotep III, and King Ay. It was discovered in February 1905 by James E. Quibell. Until the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, this was the richest and best preserved tomb found in the valley, and the first to be found with major items in situ.      (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Phase Two Tombs\n25.7532.61435 Tomb of Horemheb (KV57). The tomb of Tutankhamon's and Ay's successor, the last king of the 18th Dynasty.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.7532.61436 Tomb of Seti I (KV17). It is the longest, and one of the best decorated tombs in the valley. LE 1000, no discounts for students.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.74083332.6011117 Tomb of Merneptah (KV8). The son of Ramesses the Great, Merneptah's tomb has suffered greatly from flash flooding of the Valley over the millennia. Those paintings and reliefs that have survived, however, are generally in good condition.      (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Phase Three Tombs\n25.7532.61438 Tomb of Seti II (KV15). Relatively little is known about the history of the tomb. Seti II was buried there, but he may have originally been buried with his wife Twosret in her tomb in KV14 and subsequently moved to the hastily finished KV15 tomb, perhaps by the later pharaoh Setnakhte, who took over KV14 for his own tomb.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.7532.61439 KV14 (The Joint Tomb). A joint tomb, used originally by Seti II's wife Twosret, and then reused and extended by Setnakhte, the father of Ramses III. It has been open since antiquity, but was not properly recorded until Hartwig Altenmüller excavated it from 1983 to 1987. It has two burial chambers, the later extensions making the tomb one of the largest of the Royal Tombs, at over 112 m. The original decoration, showing the female Twosret, was replaced with those of the male Setnakhte. Even later, the name of Setnakte was replaced by those of Seti II.      (updated Jan 2019)\n25.74027832.60138910 Tomb of Ramesses VI. The KV9 tomb was started by Ramesses V, but usurped after his death by his successor Ramesses VI, who enlarged the tomb and had his own image and cartouches carved in over his predecessor's. The tomb is one of the most interesting in the Valley, with one of the most complete and best preserved decorative schemes surviving. LE100/50 extra ticket.      (updated Jan 2019)\n\n## Western Valley of the Kings\nThe Western Valley or West Valley is adjacent to the main Valley and contains a number of remarkable pharaonic burials additional to the main one. The Western Valley is also known in Arabic as the Wadi al-Gurud (the \"Valley of the Monkeys\"), on account of the representations of baboons in several tomb paintings found within the wadi.\nIt is nowhere near so commonly accessed by tourist parties as the Valley of the Kings, being located somewhat 'off the beaten track'. The Valley is nonetheless well worth a visit by the determined traveller: its relative quiet and isolation help to evoke the silent and haunting atmosphere at one time characteristic of the main King's Valley (believed by ancient Egyptians to have been watched over by the protective goddess Meretseger, whose name translates as \"she who loves silence\").\nOnly the Tomb of Ay (out of 16 available tombs) is open to the public.\nGetting there: the Western Valley is accessed by a winding dirt and stone road that begins at the car park of the Valley of the Kings. Visitors must walk for some 2 km between massive boulders, under towering rock cliffs, in order to reach the tombs; although some taxis will take you all the way into the valley. The road is not suitable for cycling.\n25.7532.614311 Tomb of Ay (WV23). The same working hours as Valley of the Kings. The tomb dates from the very end of the 18th Dynasty and is the burial place of the vizier (chief minister) Ay who gained the throne after the extinction of the line of succession within the ruling 18th Dynasty family of pharaohs. As such, WV23 was the last tomb to be established in the valley. Scenes from the tomb decoration, bearing close resemblance to the style seen in the tomb of Tutankhamun (Ay's predecessor), include a depiction of Ay hunting in the marshes (unique amongst royal depictions in the Theban necropolis) and an assemblage of twelve baboons. The sarcophagus has been restored and re-installed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, though its orientation is now reversed from the original. Admission LE 60, by means of ticket from the Valley of the Kings' Ticket Office.   (updated Jan 2019)\n25.7532.614312 Tomb of Amenhotep III (WV22). Restored and opened to the public in October 2025.   (updated Oct 2025)\n\n## Buy\nThe Valley of the Kings ticket does not include a tram ride from the ticket office to the entrance of the first tomb. If you are not in a rush take the time to walk. You will save the 3-min tram ride and save yourself LE5.\n\n## Eat\nNo restaurants here. Around the souvenir shops at the entrance there are drinks and snacks for sale. Opposite the grave of Ramses V/Ramses VI (KV 9) there's a seating area where you can sit down and eat your snacks.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are no opportunities of accommodation in the Valley of the Kings. After evening closing it is not allowed to tourists to enter this area.\nThere are many accommodations at Luxor East and Luxor West banks.\n\n## Cope\nBringing your own small torch to gently illuminate some of the more obscure reliefs is always a good idea.\nWatch out for the guards in the tombs that may offer to take your picture (which is against the rules) for some baksheesh.  If they get your camera they can take any sort of picture, then  report you to the authorities, which is a big hassle. A camera flash in a tomb will alert the guards to picture taking that is strictly forbidden. You will be given the choice of leaving the site (not just that tomb) or paying a second admission fee.\nHiking back over the mountain into the valley (Valley of the Queens, etc.) is not allowed anymore and will be prevented by the many policemen standing around.\nCarry a bottle of water with you, if heading to the Western Valley of Kings, especially in summer, as there are no water vendors.\nDo not venture into the narrow Western Valley, if it appears that there may be an exceedingly rare rainstorm - you will probably not survive the ensuing flash flood as it races through the valley.\n\n## Go next\nVisitors to the Valley of the Kings may also visit Luxor's West Bank.",

          "title": "Valley of the Queens",
          "content": "The Valley of the Queens is a site in Egypt, in which queens, princes, princesses, and other high-ranking officials were buried from roughly 1560 BC to 1130 BC. Pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. The Valley of the Queens was known anciently as Ta-Set-Neferu, which has a double meaning of \"The Place of Beauty\" and/or \"the Place of the Royal Children\". Excavation of the tombs at the Valley of the Queens was pioneered by Ernesto Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini in the early 1900s.\nThe Valley of the Queens consists of the main wadi, which contains most of the tombs, along with the Valley of Prince Ahmose, the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The main wadi contains 91 tombs and the subsidiary valleys add another 19 tombs. The burials in the subsidiary valleys all date to the 18th Dynasty.\nThe reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The close proximity to the workers' village of Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings may have been a factor. Another consideration could have been the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may have been associated with rejuvenation of the dead.\nAlong with the Valley of the Kings and nearby Thebes, the Valley of the Queens was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.\n\nGeology\nThe Valley of the Queens is on a geological array of limestones, marls, clays, chalks, and shale. The clays in the valley have undergone expansion and shrinkage due to recurrent flash-flooding throughout the valley. This shrinkage has been one cause of unstable tomb construction and later tomb damage in the valley. Rockslides resulting from shrunk clay deposits and tectonic events have damaged not only the tombs of the valley but also the wall paintings within them.\nThe current landscape of the Valley of the Queens was built through faulting and subsequent slumping during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. Thus, the original horizontal stratigraphy of the area has been subject to tilting. This tilting has revealed deposits of minerals like anhydrite, gypsum, and halite. Salt from halite in the ground is also damaging to the paintings within tombs. Seeping groundwater has permeated the tombs and is the cause of the dissolved and recrystallized salt.\nGypsum, along with clay, is most often believed to be the plasters used in ancient Egypt. Due to the lack of data, however, it is hard to determine what exactly composes the ancient plasters. Such beliefs are contested because of variations of plaster color, hardness, and amount used in a particular tomb.\n\nEighteenth Dynasty\nOne of the first tombs constructed in the Valley of the Queens is the tomb of Princess Ahmose, a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Queen Sitdjehuti. This tomb likely dates to the reign of Thutmose I. The tombs from this period also include several members of the nobility, including a head of the stables and a vizier.\nThe tombs from the Valley of the Three Pits  mostly date to the Thutmosid period. The tombs are labeled with letters A - L. This valley also contains three shaft tombs, which are the origin of the valley's name. The modern labels for these three tombs are QV 89, QV 90, and QV 91.\nThe Valley of the Dolmen contains an old trail used by the workmen traveling from Deir el-Medina to the Valley of the Queens. Along this path is a small rock-cut temple dedicated to Ptah and Meretseger.\nThe tombs from this time period are generally simple in form and consist of a chamber and a shaft for burial. Some of the tombs were extended in size to accommodate more than one burial. The tombs include those of several royal princes and princesses, as well as some nobles.\nIt has long been thought that that finds located in museums which include fragments of burial equipment for several members of the royal family were from the Valley of the Queens. However, these items which include a canopic jar fragment of the King's Wife Henut, canopic jar fragments mentioning a King's Son, Menkheperre, a King's Great Wife, Nebetnehat, canopic jar fragments with the name of the King's Daughter Ti, all come from the Shaft Tombs of Wadi Bairiya 4.5 kilometres north-west of the Valley of the Queens.\n\nNineteenth Dynasty\nDuring the 19th Dynasty the use of the Valley became more selective. The tombs from this period belong exclusively to royal women. Many of the high-ranking wives of Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II were buried in the Valley. One of the most well-known examples is the resting place carved out of the rock for Queen Nefertari (1290–1224 BCE). The polychrome reliefs in her tomb are still intact. Other members of the royal family continued to be buried in the Valley of the Kings. Tomb KV5, the tomb of the sons of Ramesses II, is an example of this practice.\nThe tomb of Queen Satre (QV 38) was likely the first tomb prepared during this dynasty. It was probably started during the reign of Ramesses I and finished during the reign of Seti I. Several tombs were prepared without an owner in mind, and the names were included upon the death of the royal female.\n\nTwentieth Dynasty\nDuring the beginning of the 20th Dynasty the Valley was still used extensively. Tombs for the wives of Ramesses III were prepared, and in a departure from the conventions of the previous dynasty, several tombs were prepared for royal sons as well. The construction of tombs continued at least until the reign of Ramesses VI. The Turin Papyrus mentions the creation of six tombs during the reign of Ramesses VI. It is not known which tombs are referred to in that papyrus.\nThere is evidence of economic turmoil during the 20th Dynasty. Records show that the workers went on strike during the reign of Ramesses III, and towards the end of the dynasty there are reports of tomb robberies.\n\nThird Intermediate Period and later\nThe Valley was no longer a royal burial site after the close of the 20th Dynasty. Many of the tombs were extensively reused. Several tombs were modified so that they could hold multiple burials. In some cases this involved digging burial pits in the existing tombs. Not much is known about the use of the Valley of the Queens during the Ptolemaic Period but during the Roman Period there was a renewed, extensive use of the Valley as a burial site. During the Coptic Period some Hermit shelters were erected. Tombs QV60 (Nebettawy) and QV73 (Henuttawy) show signs of Coptic occupation. Wall scenes were covered with plaster and decorated with Christian symbols. The Christian presence lasted until the 7th century CE.\n\nThreats to conservation\nConservation efforts in the Valley of the Queens happen in multiple ways. Some large concerns for the site include protection against mass tourism and a concoction of other natural risks.\n\nMass tourism\nWith the rise of the tourism industry, effects humans have on archaeological sites is becoming a topic of interest for preservation teams. Due to their relatively small size and delicate ecosystem, many of the Valley of the Queens tombs are threatened by human interaction. An off balance of humidity and CO2 from humans contributes to the continued degradation of tombs and the art within them. Other factors that lead to tomb deterioration are graffiti, touching, and head bumping due to small spaces.\nLight fixtures installed in some of the tombs for better viewing are also a threat to conservation efforts in the area. Large amounts of lint from visitors' clothes stays in the air and settles on tomb floors and other fixtures, creating an increased fire hazard. As lint settles on the modern light fixtures, the likeliness of combustion increases.\nSteps taken to combat and limit effects on Valley of the Queens tombs from tourism consist of building walled paths that control tourist traffic, constructing shelters at some of the more popular tombs such as QV 66 - Nefertari's tomb. Other methods used to preserve Nefertari's tomb are a viewing time limited to 15 minutes, separate ticket purchase, and the addition of an air-circulation system to the tomb. As for other tombs, plexiglass shields and wooden floors have been installed to protect the entombed and their resting places.\n\nAnimal populations\nCommonly located in open tombs in the Valley of the Queens are small to large bat colonies. Although beneficial for the natural ecosystem, bats are detrimental to the tombs, the wall paintings, and the health of tourists in the valley. Urine and feces from bats damages the rocks, plasters, and paints used for tomb construction and decoration. Also stemming from bat excrement is the increased possibility of visitors getting histoplasmosis. Contact with bat populations also increases the possibility of bat bites and rabies transmission.\nIn an attempt to limit bat occupation of certain tombs, installation of doors and has been proposed. Bat populations must be removed from the tombs before any preventative measures can be taken. Due to ecological importance, some tombs have been selected to remain open to bat colonies. Tombs selected are as follows: QV 15, QV 48, and QV 78.\n\nBurials\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nSims, Lesley (2000). A Visitor's Guide to Ancient Egypt. Saffron Hill, London: Usborne Publishing.

          "title": "Karnak",
          "content": "The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (), comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut (\"The Most Selected of Places\") and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. \nIt is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.\n\nName\nThe original name of the temple was Ipet-isut, meaning \"The Most Select of Places\". The complex's modern name \"Karnak\" comes from the nearby village of el-Karnak, which means \"fortified village\".\n\nOverview\nThe complex is a vast open site and includes the Karnak Open Air Museum. It is believed to be the second-most-visited historical site in Egypt; only the Giza pyramid complex near Cairo receives more visits. It consists of four main parts, of which only the largest is currently open to the public. The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of Amun-Re only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public. There also are a few smaller temples and sanctuaries connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amun-Re, and the Luxor Temple. The Precinct of Mut is very ancient, being dedicated to an Earth and creation deity, but not yet restored. The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or orientation of the sacred area. Many portions of it may have been carried away for use in other buildings.\nThe key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction of temples started in the Middle Kingdom and continued into Ptolemaic times. Approximately thirty pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity, and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of features are vast. The deities represented range from some of the earliest worshipped to those worshipped much later in the history of the Ancient Egyptian culture. Although destroyed, it also contained an early temple built by Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten), the pharaoh who later would celebrate a nearly monotheistic religion he established that prompted him to move his court and religious center away from Thebes. It also contains evidence of adaptations, where the buildings of the ancient Egyptians were used by later cultures for their own religious purposes, such as Coptic churches.\n\nHypostyle Hall\nThe Great Hypostyle Hall in the Precinct of Amun-Re has an area of 5,000 m2 (1.2 acres) with 134 massive columns arranged in 16 rows. One hundred and twenty-two of these columns are 10 metres (33 ft) tall, and the other 12 are 21 metres (69 ft) tall with a diameter of over 3 metres (9.8 ft). The architraves, on top of these columns, are estimated to weigh 70 tons.\nThese architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers. This would be a time-consuming process and also would require great balance to get to such heights. A common alternative theory regarding how they were moved is that large ramps were constructed of sand, mud, brick or stone and that the stones were then towed up the ramps. If stone had been used for the ramps, they would have been able to use much less material. The top of the ramps presumably would have employed either wooden tracks or cobblestones for towing the megaliths.\nThere is an unfinished pillar in an out-of-the-way location that indicates how it would have been finished. Final carving was executed after the drums were put in place so that it was not damaged while being placed. Several experiments moving megaliths with ancient technology were made at other locations – some of which are amongst the largest monoliths in the world.\nThe sun god's shrine was built so that it has light focused upon it during the winter solstice.\nIn 2009, UCLA launched a website dedicated to virtual reality digital reconstructions of the Karnak complex and other resources.\n\nHistory\nThe history of the Karnak complex is largely the history of Thebes and its changing role in the culture. Religious centers varied by region, and when a new capital of the unified culture was established, the religious centers in that area gained prominence. The city of Thebes does not appear to have been of great significance before the Eleventh Dynasty and previous temple building there would have been relatively small, with shrines being dedicated to the early deities of Thebes, the Earth goddess Mut and Montu. Early building was destroyed by invaders. The earliest known artifact found in the area of the temple is a small, eight-sided column from the Eleventh Dynasty, which mentions Amun-Re. Amun (sometimes called Amen) was long the local tutelary deity of Thebes. He was identified with the ram and the goose. The Egyptian meaning of Amun is \"hidden\" or the \"hidden god\".\n\nMajor construction work in the Precinct of Amun-Re took place during the Eighteenth Dynasty, when Thebes became the capital of the unified Ancient Egypt. Almost every pharaoh of that dynasty added something to the temple site. Thutmose I erected an enclosure wall connecting the Fourth and Fifth pylons, which comprise the earliest part of the temple still standing in situ. Hatshepsut had monuments constructed and also restored the original Precinct of Mut, that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the second-tallest ancient obelisk still standing on Earth; the other has toppled and is broken.\nAnother of her projects at the site, Karnak's Red Chapel or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. She later ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction, and thus, a third was constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it still remains. Known as the unfinished obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.\n\nConstruction of the Great Hypostyle Hall also may have begun during the Eighteenth Dynasty (although most new building was undertaken under Seti I and Ramesses II in the Nineteenth). Merneptah, also of the Nineteenth Dynasty, commemorated his victories over the Sea Peoples on the walls of the Cachette Court, the start of the processional route (also known as the Avenue of Sphinxes) to the Luxor Temple. The last major change to the Precinct of Amun-Re's layout was the addition of the First Pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the precinct, both constructed by Nectanebo I of the Thirtieth Dynasty.\nAncient Greek and Roman writers wrote about a range of monuments in Upper Egypt and Nubia, including Karnak, Luxor temple, the Colossi of Memnon, Esna, Edfu, Kom Ombo, Philae, and others.\nIn 323 AD, Roman emperor Constantine the Great recognized the Christian religion, and in 356 Constantius II ordered the closing of pagan temples throughout the Roman empire, into which Egypt had been annexed in 30 BC. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were founded among the ruins, the most famous example of this is the reuse of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III's central hall, where painted decorations of saints and Coptic inscriptions can still be seen.\n\nEuropean knowledge of Karnak\nThebes' exact placement was unknown in medieval Europe, though both Herodotus and Strabo give the exact location of Thebes and how long up the Nile one must travel to reach it. Maps of Egypt, based on the 2nd century Claudius Ptolemaeus' mammoth work Geographia, had been circulating in Europe since the late 14th century, all of them showing Thebes' (Diospolis) location. Despite this, several European authors of the 15th and 16th centuries who visited only Lower Egypt and published their travel accounts, such as Joos van Ghistele and André Thévet, put Thebes in or close to Memphis.\n\nThe first European description of the Karnak temple complex was by an unknown Venetian in 1589 and is housed in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, although his account gives no name for the complex.\nKarnak (\"Carnac\") as a village name, and name of the complex, is first attested in 1668, when two capuchin missionary brothers, Protais and Charles François d'Orléans, travelled though the area. Protais' writing about their travel was published by Melchisédech Thévenot (Relations de divers voyages curieux, 1670s–1696 editions) and Johann Michael Vansleb (The Present State of Egypt, 1678).\n\nThe first drawing of Karnak is found in Paul Lucas' travel account of 1704, (Voyage du Sieur Paul Lucas au Levant). It is rather inaccurate, and can be quite confusing to modern eyes. Lucas travelled in Egypt during 1699–1703. The drawing shows a mixture of the Precinct of Amun-Re and the Precinct of Montu, based on a complex confined by the three huge Ptolemaic gateways of Ptolemy III Euergetes / Ptolemy IV Philopator, and the massive 113 m long, 43 m high and 15 m thick, First Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Re.\nKarnak was visited and described in succession by Claude Sicard and his travel companion Pierre Laurent Pincia (1718 and 1720–21), Granger (1731), Frederick Louis Norden (1737–38), Richard Pococke (1738), James Bruce (1769), Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt (1777), William George Browne (1792–93), and finally by a number of scientists of the Napoleon expedition, including Vivant Denon, during 1798–1799. Claude-Étienne Savary describes the complex in rather great detail in his work of 1785; especially in light of the fact that it is a fictional account of a pretend journey to Upper Egypt, composed out of information from other travellers. Savary did visit Lower Egypt in 1777–78, and published a work about that too.\n\nMain parts\nPrecinct of Amun-Re\nThis is the largest of the precincts of the temple complex, and is dedicated to Amun-Re, the chief deity of the Theban Triad. There are several colossal statues, including the figure of Pinedjem I which is 10.5 metres (34 ft) tall. The sandstone for this temple, including all of the columns, was transported from Gebel Silsila 100 miles (161 km) south on the Nile river. It also has one of the largest obelisks, weighing 328 tons and standing 29 metres (95 ft) tall.\n\nPrecinct of Mut\nLocated to the south of the newer Amun-Re complex, this precinct was dedicated to the mother goddess, Mut, who became identified as the wife of Amun-Re in the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban Triad. It has several smaller temples associated with it and has its own sacred lake, constructed in a crescent shape. This temple has been ravaged, many portions having been used in other structures. Following excavation and restoration works by the Johns Hopkins University team, led by Betsy Bryan (see below) the Precinct of Mut has been opened to the public. Six hundred black granite statues were found in the courtyard to her temple. It may be the oldest portion of the site.\nIn 2006, Bryan presented her findings of a festival that included apparent intentional overindulgence in alcohol. Participation in the festival included the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed the warrior goddesses, Sekhmet and Bast, as some of her aspects. First, Mut became Mut-Wadjet-Bast, then Mut-Sekhmet-Bast (Wadjet having merged into Bast), then Mut also assimilated Menhit, another lioness goddess, and her adopted son's wife, becoming Mut-Sekhmet-Bast-Menhit, and finally becoming Mut-Nekhbet.\nTemple excavations at Luxor discovered a \"porch of drunkenness\" built onto the temple by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, during the height of her twenty-year reign. In a later myth developed around the annual drunken Sekhmet festival, Ra, by then the sun god of Upper Egypt, created her from a fiery eye gained from his mother, to destroy mortals who conspired against him (Lower Egypt). In the myth, Sekhmet's blood-lust was not quelled at the end of the battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity, so Ra had tricked her by turning the Nile as red as blood (the Nile turns red every year when filled with silt during inundation) so that Sekhmet would drink it. The trick, however, was that the red liquid was not blood, but beer mixed with pomegranate juice so that it resembled blood, making her so drunk that she gave up slaughter and became an aspect of the gentle Hathor. The complex interweaving of deities occurred over the thousands of years of the culture.\n\nPrecinct of Montu\nThis portion of the site is dedicated to the son of Mut and Amun-Re, Montu, a war-god. It is located to the north of the Amun-Re complex and is much smaller in size. It is not open to the public.\n\nTemple of Amenhotep IV (deliberately dismantled)\nThe temple that Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) constructed on the site was located east of the main complex, outside the walls of the Amun-Re precinct. It was destroyed immediately after the death of its builder, who had attempted to overcome the powerful priesthood who had gained control over Egypt before his reign. It was so thoroughly demolished that its full extent and layout is unknown. The priesthood of that temple regained their powerful position as soon as Akhenaten died, and were instrumental in destroying many records of his existence.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of megalithic sites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBlyth, Elizabeth (2006).

          "summary": "The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (), comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut (\"The Most Selected of Places\") and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. \nIt is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.",

          "content": "The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, \"the southern sanctuary\". It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death.  Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).\nTo the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. During the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area. During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult chapel and later into a church.\nAlong with the other archeological sites in Thebes, the Luxor Temple was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.\n\nConstruction\nThe Luxor Temple was built with sandstone from the Gebel el-Silsila area, which is  located in South-Western Egypt. This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone. It was used for the construction of monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works.\nLike other Egyptian structures, a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism. For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis jackal was really Anubis. At the Luxor Temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the Place de la Concorde in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were. With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway.\n\nExcavation\nFrom the Middle Ages, the population of Luxor had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount. Due to this, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to 15 metres (48 to 49 ft) in height. The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor Gaston Maspero after 1884, once he had been given permission to commence operations. The excavations were sporadic until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had obtained the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies.\n\nFestivals\nThe Luxor Temple was built during the New Kingdom and dedicated to the Theban Triad consisted of Amun, his consort Mut, and their son Khonsu. The focus of the annual Opet Festival, in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby Karnak Temple (ipet-sut) to stay there for a while with his consort Mut, was to promote the fertility of Amun-Re and the Pharaoh. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet). They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka. Examples of the cult of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Grand colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka.\n\nAvenue of Sphinxes and Shrine stations\nThe avenue (known as wi.t ntr \"path of god\"; طريق الكباش) which went in a straight line for about 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was lined with human-headed sphinxes; in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads. Six barque shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the Karnak and Luxor Temple. Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to the temple. Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun. The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun. Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps. \nA small mudbrick shrine was built in the courtyard of Nectanebo I in early second century (126 CE) and was dedicated to Serapis and Isis; it was presented to Roman Emperor Hadrian on his birthday.\n\nAbu Haggag Mosque\nThe active Abu Haggag Mosque (مسجد أبو الحجاج بالأقصر) is located within the temple, standing on the ancient columns themselves. That part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a church by the Romans in 395 AD, and then to a mosque around 640 AD, which is more than 3,400 years of continuous religious worship.\n\nDefacement\nIn 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved writing that read \"Ding Jinhao was here\" (Chinese: 丁锦昊到此一游) in Chinese on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The graffiti has since been partially cleared.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nTemple of Khonsu\nLuxor Museum\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "content": "معبد الأقصر معبد كبير من المعابد المصرية القديمة المعقدة يقع على الضفة الشرقية لنهر النيل في مدينة الأقصر اليوم المعروفة باسم (طيبة القديمة). تأسس سنة 1400 قبل الميلاد. شُيد معبد الأقصر لعبادة آمون رع وزوجته موت وابنهما خونسو؛ وهي الآرباب التي يطلق عليها أيضا لقب الثالوث الطيبي (ثالوث طيبة). تم تشييد معبد الأقصر في عهد ملوك الأسرة الثامنة عشر، والأسرة التاسعة عشرة. وأهم الأبنية القائمة بالمعبد هي تلك التي شيدها الملكان أمنحوتب الثالث (1397-1360 ق.م.) ورمسيس الثاني (1290-1223 ق.م.) (الذي أضاف إلى المعبد الفناء المفتوح والصرح والمسلتين). كما أقام الملك تحتمس الثالث (1490-1436 ق.م.) مقاصير لزوار ثالوث طيبة المقدس، كما قام توت عنخ آمون (1348-1337 ق.م.) باستكمال نقوش جدرانه. وقد دُمُرت المقصورة الثلاثية التي كانت قد شُيّدت من قبل في عهد الملكة حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث (من الأسرة الثامنة عشرة)؛ ثم أُعيد بناؤها في عهد الملك رمسيس الثاني. سمي المعبد أيضاً «إيبت رسيت» (وتعني الحرم الجنوبي أو المكان الخاص بآمون رع). وهو من أحسن المعابد المصرية حفظاً وأجملها بناء، وفيه يتجلى تخطيط المعبد المصري أوضح ما يكون.\n\nتاريخ بناء المعبد\nعصر الدولة الوسطى: من المحتمل أنه كان يوجد في نفس المنطقة التي أقام فيها أمنحتب الثالث المعبد بقايا معبد قديم أو مقصورة مقدسة ترجع إلى عصر الدولة الوسطى وأغلب الظن أنه كان في عصر الأسرة الثانية عشرة.\nالملك أمنحتب الثالث: يرجع الفضل في بناء المعبد في صورته الحالية على الضفة الشرقية للنيل على محور واحد من الشمال إلى الجنوب إلى أمنحتب الثالث من ملوك الأسرة الثامنة عشرة.\nالملكة حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث: قاما بتشيد مبنى صغير مكون من ثلاث مقاصير خصصت لثالوث طيبة ومن المحتمل أن الملك رمسيس الثاني قد أعاد بناء هذه المقاصير وسجّل اسمه عليها.\nالملك رمسيس الثاني: أضاف الملك رمسيس الثاني من ملوك الأسرة التاسعة عشرة صرحا كبيراً وخلفه فناء فسيحا ذا أساطين بردية.\n\nمحور المعبد\nيمكننا أن نلاحظ أن المعماريين القدماء أنشأوا المعابد على الجانب الشرقي للنيل في اتجاه محور غربي شرقي، بينما شيٌدوها على الجانب الغربي في اتجاه محور شرقي غربي، ومع ذلك فإن معبد الأقصر (الكائن في البر الشرقي) شُيّد في اتجاه محور شمالي جنوبي، ربما لكي يكون على خط واحد مع مجموعة معبد الكرنك الذي يقع إلى الشمال منه، ومع طريق أبي الهول أو الكباش الذي كان يربط بين المعبدين. وربما اضطر معماريو الملك رمسيس الثاني ـ في وقت لاحق ـ إلى تغيير محاور الأبنية التي أضيفت في عهده، وكذلك الصرح والبهو لمعبد الملك أمنحوتب الثالث، عندما أعادوا تشييد المقصورة الثلاثية الأقدم للملكة حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث.\n\nأسباب تأسيس المعبد\nأمر أمنحتب الثالث بإقامة هذا المعبد لثالوث طيبة أغلب الظن لأمرين: الأول كان لتأكيد نسبة للإله آمون نفسه، إذ أن أحقيته للعرش لم تكن واضحة طبقا للتقاليد المصرية التي تنص بأن الفرعون يجب أن يكون ابن فرعون وأميرة من سلالة نقية أما إذا كانت سلالته غير نقية فيكتسب أحقيته للعرش بالزواج من الإبنة الكبرى للملك (السابق). ولم ينطبق أحد الشرطين على أمنحتب الثالث فأمه لم تكن مصرية وزوجته لم تكن من سلالة ملكية. ولهذا أكّد شرعيته للعرش بإثبات نسبه للإله آمون نفسه وتسجيل ولادته المقدسة على جدران الغرفة الشهيرة بالمعبد والمعروفة بغرفة الولادة. والثاني هو إرضاء لكهنة آمون لكي يتقبلوه فرعوناً شرعيا لمصر ولذلك خصص هذا المعبد للإله آمون ولصورة من صوره وهي التي يطلق عليها «آمون رع-كا-موت-أف» أي «آمون –رع ثور أمه» وهي الصورة التي تظهر آمون-رع كآلة للخصب ولدورة الحياة.\n\nمدخل المعبد\nمدخل معبد الأقصر هو البرج الأول بارتفاع 24 متر (79 قدم)، بناه رمسيس الثاني وزُين البرج بمشاهد انتصارات رمسيس العسكرية (لا سيما معركة قادش)؛ كما سجّلت انتصارات الفراعنة في وقت لاحق، لا سيما انتصارات الأسرة 25 (السلالة النوبية).\n\nتسمية المعبد\nأبت رست: أطلق المصريون على هذا المعبد اسم «أبت رست» والتي قد تعني الحريم الجنوبي (حيث تسكن موت زوجة آمون) أو المقصورة الجنوبية..\n\nمهندس البناء\nأمنحتب بن حابو .\n\nوصف المعبد\nطريق أبو الهول\nوهو عبارة عن طريق مرصوف ببلاطات من الحجر يحف به من الجانبين تماثيل على هيئة أبو الهول تمثل الملك نقتنبو الأول (من ملوك الأسرة الثلاثين) الذي أنشأ هذا الطريق في عهده. وكان هذا الطريق يوصل إلى معبد الإله خنسو الواقع جنوب معابد الكرنك وقد حلّ هذا الطريق محل طريق الكباش الذي يرجع إلى عهد الملك أمنحتب الثالث، بدليل وجود بعض التماثيل التي تحمل اسم أمنحتب الثالث عند البوابة الجنوبية لمعبد خنسو. وقد نحت تمثال أبو الهول من كتلة واحدة من الحجر الرملي تجسّد أسد له رأس الملك نقتنبو، وقد وضع التمثال على قاعدة مستطيلة أبعادها 120X330 سم وقد تم الكشف حتى الآن عن 34 تمثالاً لأبو الهول على كل جانب. والهدف من طريق أبو الهول هو تحديد مسار الموكب سواء الملكي أم الإلهي وإبراز محوره.\n\nمسلات المعبد\nكان يتقدم صرح الملك رمسيس الثاني مسلتين من حجر الجرانيت الوردي تزين الغربية منهما الآن ميدان الكونكورد في باريس منذ عام 1836 وارتفاعها 22,84 مترا وتزن 220 طنا، أما المسلة الشرقية وهي القائمة الآن أمام البرج الشمالي فيبلغ ارتفاعها 22,52 مترا وارتفاع قاعدتها 2,51 مترا ويبلغ وزنها 257 طنا وتتميز بمجموعة القردة البارزة (أربعة قرود) التي تهلل للشمس عند شروقها والمنحوتة على قاعدتها وقد سجّل على هاتين المسلتين بالنقوش الهيروغليفية اسم الملك رمسيس الثاني وألقابه، كما مثل على قمتها وهو يقدم القربان إلى الإله آمون.\nولعل السبب من وجود المسلة أمام صرح المعبد ربما -بجانب كونها رمز من رموز الشمس- لتعلن من بعيد عن مكان المعبد، وخاصة أن هذه المسلات ذات قمام مدببة وكانت مغطاة -أغلب الظن- بطبقة نحاسية مذهبة حتى تظل براقة ساطعة.\n\nشُيّد مسجد أبي الحجاج الأقصري ـ الذي يرجع إلى العصر الأيوبي ـ على الجانب الشمالي الشرقي من معبد الأقصر .\n\nصرح الملك رمسيس الثانى\nقام بتشيدة الملك رمسيس الثاني، وهو عبارة عن بوابة ضخمة يتوسطها مدخل المعبد، ويبلغ عرض هذا الصرح 65 م، وارتفاعة 24 م.\n\nالجناح الأيمن (الغربى)\nتصف النقوش الغائرة على واجه الصرح المعارك الحربية التي قام بها الملك رمسيس الثاني ضد الحيثيين في العام الخامس من حكمه. فنشاهد على الجناح الأيمن (الغربي)للصرح الملك رمسيس الثاني ومعه مسشاروه العسكريون (المنظر منقوش في أقصى الشمال)، وفي الوسط نرى الموقع أو المعسكر الذي هزم فيه أعداءه من الحيثيين، وفي أقصى اليمين نشاهد الملك في عربتة الحربية وسط المعركة.\n\nالجناح الأيسر (الشرقى)\nنشاهد على هذا الجناح الملك رمسيس الثاني في عربته الحربية، يرمى الأعداء الحيثيين بوابل من السهام، والأرض مغطاه بالقتلى والجرحى، اما الأحياء فيهربون مزعورين ويتركون قادش.وفي أقصى الشمال على هذا الجناح منظر الأمير قادش يصوره خائفا في عربته. وهناك وصف كامل لهذه المعركة كتب باللغة المصرية القديمة (بالنقش الهيروغليفى)بأسلوب شعرى موجود أيضا على الجزء الأسفل من هذا الصرح، والنص يبدأ من الجناح الغربي (الأيمن)وينتهى على الجناح الشرقي. يوجد على واجهة الصرح أيضا اربع فجوات عمودية، فجوتان في كل جناح وقد خصصت لكى توضع فيها ساريات الاعلام، كما يوجد أيضا في أعلى الصرح اربع فتحات خصصت لكى تثبت فيها هذه الساريات.\nكان يتقدم الصرح وظهورها إلى جداره ستة تماثيل ضخمة للملك رمسيس الثاني أربعة واقفة –اثنان على كل جانب –لم يبق منهما الا تمثال واحد فقط هو المقام إلى أقصى اليمين بالنسبة للداخل.وهناك، تمثالان كبيران على جانبى المدخل يمثلان الملك رمسيس الثاني وهو جالس على عرشه، ونقش على جانبى العرش منظرا يمثل اتحاد القطرين وعلى جانب كرسى العرش تمثال صغير للملكة نفرتارى على الجانب الايسر للتمثال الشرقي وتمثال الأميرة على الجانب الأيمن للتمثال الغربي.وحول قاعدتى التمثالين نقشت صور الاسرى واسمائهم على صدورهم.ارتفاع كل تمثال 14م.\nنشاهد على جانبى المدخل من الخارج مناظر تمثل الملك رمسيس الثاني في علاقاته المختلفة مع الالهة والالهات.نذكر منها ثالوث طيبة المقدس، بالإضافة إلى الالهة آمونت.اما على كتفى المدخل من الداخل فهناك اضافات ترجع إلى عصر الاسرة الخامسة والعشرين تمثل الملك شاباكا في علاقاته المختلفة مع كل من آمون وآمونت ومنتو وحتحور. أما خلف الجناح الايسر للصرح الشرقي فهناك مناظر جميلة مختلفة ومتعددة للملك رمسيس الثاني وزوجته في حضرة الآلهة والآلهات..ثم وهما يشاركان في الاحتفال بعيد الإله مين.\n\nالفناء الأول\nاقامه رمسيس الثاني ويبلغ طوله 57 م وعرضه 51 م ولا يقع محور هذا الفناء على امتداد محور المعبد وانما ينحرف نحو الشرق ربما لكى يتجه نحو معبد الكرنك أو ليتفادى المقاصير التي شيدتها من قبل حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث في المكان الحالى ويحيط بفناء رمسيس الثاني الصفات التي يرتكز سقف كل منها على صفين من الاساطين، عدا المبنى الذي شيدته حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث والذي يقع على يمين الداخل مباشرة، وقد شكلت هذه الأساطين (74 أسطونا) على هيئة نبات البردى وتنتهى بتيجان على شكل براعم البردى.وتقوم بين الأساطين الأمامية في النصف الجنوبي لهذا الفناء المفتوح تماثيل للملك رمسيس الثاني منها ما يمثله واقفا (11 تمثالا) ومنها ما يمثله جالسا (تمثالان) فنرى على جانبى المدخل الموصل إلى الممرالعظيم الذي أقامه امنحتب الثالث تمثالين ضخمين يمثلان رمسيس الثاني جالسا على العرش الذين زين بمناظر تمثل الهي النيل وهما يؤكدان الوحدة بين الوجهين وذلك بربط نبات البردى رمز الشمال ونبات اللوتس رمز الجنوب.وقد أطلق على هذا الفناء اسم «معبد رعمسو المتحد مع الابدية».\nتزين جدران الفناء الفسيح مناظر مختلفة تمثل التقدمات المقدسة بجانب مناظر تمثل الشعوب الأجنبية المهزومة ومن أهم المناظر التي يجب مشاهدتها في الفناء المنظر الموجود على الجدار الجنوبي الغربي، والمنظر هنا يمثل واجهة معبد الأقصر كاملة أي الصرح بتماثيله الستة وأعلامه والمسلتين، وعلى يمين (الناظر)نرى موكبا يتقدمه الأمراء من أبناء رمسيس الثاني تتبعهم الاضاحى السمينة المزينة من الماشية التي سوف يضحى بها _أغلب الظن_كقربان للألهة (تكملة المنظر نراه على الجدار الغربي).\n\nمقاصير تحتمس الثالث\nموجودة في الركن الشمالي الغربي من فناء رمسيس الثاني وقد قام بتشيدها كل من حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث وإن كان البعض يرى أن رمسيس الثاني الذي سجِل اسمه عليها هو الذي أقامها بحجارة اغتصبها من مقاصير لحتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث. يتقدم هذه المقاصير أربعة أساطين رشيقة على شكل حزمة سيقان البردي من الجرانيت الأحمر أما تيجانها فهي تمثل سيقان البردي. وقد خصصت المقصورة الوسطى للزورق المقدس للإله آمون رع، والغربية للزورق المقدس لزوجته الآلهة موت، والشرقية للزورق المقدس للابن الإله خنسو إله القمر. وتميزت كل مقصورة من المقاصير الثلاث بمناظر تمثل إطلاق البخور والتطهير وتقدمة الدهون والقربان إلى المركب المقدس الخاص بالإله (أو الالهة) صاحب المقصورة هذا بالإضافة إلى المناظر الدينية المختلفة. أما جامع أبي الحجاج فيشغل الجزء الشمالي الشرقي من الفناء.\n\nفناء الأربعة عشر أسطونا\nكان

          "content": "Deir el-Bahari or Dayr al-Bahri (Arabic: الدير البحري, romanized: al-Dayr al-Baḥrī, lit. 'the Northern [lit., \"Seaward\"] Monastery', Coptic: ⲡⲧⲟⲡⲟⲥ ⲛⲁⲡⲁ ⲫⲟⲓⲃⲁⲙⲙⲱⲛ, lit. 'the monastery of Apa Phoibammon', Ancient Egyptian: djeser-djeseru) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs located on the west bank of the Nile, opposite the city of Luxor, Egypt. This is a part of the Theban Necropolis.\n\nHistory\nDeir el-Bahari, located on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes (modern Luxor) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs that has served as a major religious center for over two millennia. Its history begins with the 11th Dynasty when Pharaoh Mentuhotep II (c.2061-2010 BCE) constructed his funerary temple here to commemorate the reunification of Egypt after the First Intermediate Period. Mentuhotep's terraced complex, integrating a royal tomb into a temple platform, pioneered the cliffside temple style later emulated by New Kingdom rulers. Centuries later, the 18th Dynasty queen Hatshepsut erected her famous temple Djeser-Djeseru, designed by her architect Senenmut, directly beside Mentuhotep's complex. Richly decorated reliefs in Hatshepsut's temple celebrated her divine birth, commercial expedition to Punt, and association with Amun-Ra, cementing the temple's significance in state religion and royal propaganda. Later, Thutmose III added a smaller temple, Djeser-Akhet, just above hers. By the Third Intermediate Period, Deir el-Bahari became a burial ground for priests and a hiding place for royal mummies such as those discovered in the DB320 cache in 1881.\n\nArchaeological exploration in Deir el-Bahari began ramping up in the late 19th century. Édouard Naville's excavations from 1893 to 1906, sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Fund, revealed both Hatshepsut's temple and Mentuhotep II's complex. This was followed by Herbert Winlock's Metropolitan Museum of Art expeditions (1911-1931), which unearthed significant finds, including statues of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and caches of ritual objects. The Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology began extensive restoration work in the 1960s, stabilizing Hatshepsut's temple and recovering Thutmose III's largely destroyed shrine. Meanwhile, the sites significance as a necropolis continued into the Ptolemaic Period, when parts off Hatshepsut's temple were reused for cults of Imhotep and Amenhotep, Son of Hapu. Deir el-Bahari's rich history reflects its role as a sacred landscape where kings and priests were memorialized, divine legitimacy was protected, and Theban religious traditions flourished across changing dynasties.\n\nAssociated deities\nThe purpose and significance of the structures and burials at Deir el-Bahari is closely related with the deities associated with Deir el-Bahari and the greater Theban Necropolis.\nHathor was a prominent goddess at Deir el-Bahari, venerated as a divine mother, protector, and patroness of the necropolis. The cliffs at Deir el-Bahari were sacred to Hathor before pharaonic construction, with Mentuhotep II likely honoring her cult when building there. His temple complex included shrines for royal women, priestesses of Hathor, underscoring the goddess’s significance. Hathor, regarded as “Lady of the West,” was often depicted as a cow emerging from the cliffs to welcome and nourish souls. Hatshepsut’s temple featured a chapel of Hathor with Hathor-headed columns and reliefs of offerings, highlighting Hathor’s enduring role in funerary rites and royal worship from the Middle to New Kingdom.\nAnubis, the jackal-headed god of mummification, was revered as a guardian of tombs and guide of souls. Known as “He Who is Upon His Mountain” and “Foremost of the Westerners,” Though later eclipsed by Osiris in theology, Anubis remained essential as the patron of embalmers, and continued to be invoked as the guardian of tomb doors and the guide who conducts the \"weighing of the heart\" judgement for souls. At Deir el-Bahari, Hatshepsut’s temple featured a dedicated Anubis chapel on the north side of the middle terrace. Well-preserved reliefs show Anubis receiving offerings, reflecting his role in embalming rites and transition to the afterlife, with archaeological evidence confirming his importance across the Theban Necropolis.\nOsiris, god of death and resurrection, became increasingly central to Theban funerary religion. Osiris is depicted as a mummified king wearing the Atef-crown and his mythology as the murdered and resurrected ruler made him the divine guarantor of rebirth for the deceased. The worship of Osiris at Deir el-Bahari can be traced to the Middle Kingdom when King Mentuhotep II incorporated Osirian symbolism into his mortuary cult. Osiris' cult was fully integrated into royal mortuary temples at Hatshepsut's Djeser-Djeseru, over twenty-five life size Osiride statues of the queen in Osiris form stood against the pillars of the upper terrace.\n\nMeretseger, a cobra goddess local to the Theban Necropolis, personified the sacred peak overlooking the royal tombs and was called “She Who Loves Silence.” She guarded the necropolis, especially the Valley of the Kings, envisioned as a cobra atop the mountain watching for tomb robbers. Her cult is evidenced by votive stelae and artisans' graffiti, portraying her as both a punisher of wrongdoers and a merciful healer who forgave the penitent.\nAmun (\"The Hidden One\") was the supreme god of Thebes, originally a local air deity who rose to national prominence as \"Amun-Ra\". He is typically depicted as a man with a double plumed crown, sometimes fused with the sun god Ra, reflecting his role as a creator and solar deity. Amun's worship at Deir el-Bahari began in the Middle Kingdom: the mortuary complex of Mentuhotep II was likely among the first west Theban temples designed to receive the barque of Amun during festivals. In the New Kingdom, Hatshepsut built the central sanctuary of her terraced temple for Amun-Ra, placing his cult chapel at the heart of Djeser-Djeseru. Inscriptions and reliefs from the site honor Amun's oracles and his role in legitimizing Hatshepsut's kingship, underscoring Amun's status as king of the gods and patron of pharaohs at the Theban Necropolis.\n\nMortuary temple of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep\nMentuhotep II, the Eleventh Dynasty king who reunited Egypt at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, built a very unusual funerary complex. His mortuary temple was built on several levels in the great bay at Deir el-Bahari. It was approached by a 16-meter-wide (52-foot) causeway leading from a valley temple which no longer exists.\nThe mortuary temple itself consists of a forecourt and entrance gate, enclosed by walls on three sides, and a terrace on which stands a large square structure that may represent the primeval mound that arose from the waters of chaos. As the temple faces east, the structure is likely to be connected with the sun cult of Ra and the resurrection of the king.\nFrom the eastern part of the forecourt, an opening called the Bab el-Hosan ('Gate of the Horseman') leads to an underground passage and an unfinished tomb or cenotaph containing a seated statue of the king. On the western side, tamarisk and sycamore trees were planted beside the ramp leading up to the terrace. At the back of the forecourt and terrace are colonnades decorated in relief with boat processions, hunts, and scenes showing the king's military achievements.\nStatues of the Twelfth Dynasty king Senusret III were found here too.\nThe inner part of the temple was actually cut into the cliff and consists of a peristyle court, a hypostyle hall and an underground passage leading into the tomb itself. The cult of the dead king centred on the small shrine cut into the rear of the Hypostyle Hall.\nThe mastaba-like structure on the terrace is surrounded by a pillared ambulatory along the west wall, where the statue shrines and tombs of several royal wives and daughters were found. These royal princesses were the priestesses of Hathor, one of the main ancient Egyptian funerary deities. Although little remained of the king's own burial, six sarcophagi were retrieved from the tombs of the royal ladies (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kawit, Kemsit, Muyet and Sadhe). Each was formed of six slabs, held together at the corners by metal braces and carved in sunken relief. The sarcophagus of Queen Kawit, now in the Cairo Museum, is particularly fine.\nThe burial shaft and subsequent tunnel descend for 150 meters and end in a burial chamber 45 meters below the court. The chamber held a shrine, which once held the wooden coffin of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep. A great tree-lined court was reached by means of the processional causeway, leading up from the valley temple. Beneath the court, a deep shaft was cut which led to unfinished rooms believed to have been intended originally as the king's tomb. A wrapped image of the pharaoh was discovered in this area by Howard Carter. The temple complex also held six mortuary chapels and shaft tombs built for the pharaoh's wives and daughters.\nArchaeological finds\nOne of the most significant finds at the site is a collection of statues of King Mentuhotep II in various forms. In the court of the temple a sandstone head of Mentuhotep II was found buried and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several seated statues of Mentuhotep II were also found buried possibly indicating a ritual of buried objects  Some of the recovered statues show the king wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, emphasizing his role as a unifier in the First Intermediate Period. At each corner of the temple, foundation deposits were discovered consisting of small tablets made of wood, alabaster and bronze. The deposits contained pottery fragments, animal bones (likely from ritual sacrifices), and tools used in temple construction. These deposits suggest ritual offerings at the start of construction likely intended to sanctify the temple space. \nExcavations revealed tree holes that indicated that sycamore fig trees were planted in the temple's forecourt. Some tree holes contained buried statues which is believed to link the practice of tree planting with ritual protection or regeneration beliefs. Flower beds and irrigation features were also found, indicating that the temple complex included gardens as part of its landscape. \nSome walls of the temple showed evidence of Ptolemaic or later modifications, indicating that parts of the temple were reused in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were traces of later burials including a cemetery with poor burials stretching into the temple complex. The temple was likely partially dismantled and repurposed during the New Kingdom, possibly during the nearby construction of Hatshepsut's temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Hatshepsut\nThe focal point of the Deir el-Bahari complex is the Djeser-Djeseru meaning \"the Holy of Holies\", the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. It is a colonnaded structure, which was designed and implemented by Senenmut, royal steward and architect of Hatshepsut, to serve for her posthumous worship and to honor the glory of Amun.\nDjeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of colonnaded terraces, reached by long ramps that once were graced with gardens. It is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it, and is largely considered to be one of the \"incomparable monuments of ancient Egypt\". It is 97 feet (30 m) tall.\nThe unusual form of Hatshepsut's temple is explained by the choice of location, in the valley basin of Deir el-Bahari, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was here, in about 2050 BC, that Mentuhotep II, the founder of the Middle Kingdom, laid out his sloping, terrace-shaped mortuary temple. The pillared galleries at either side of the central ramp of the Djeser Djeseru correspond to the pillar positions on two successive levels of the Temple of Mentuhotep.\nDuring the shift into the Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE) and Roman (30 BCE-4th Century CE) periods, the temple became a center for the cult of Amenhotep, son of Hapu and Imhotep. During these periods, the temple became a major cult site for these deified figures, known for their wisdom, healing and oracular powers. Greek inscriptions discovered in the temple provide insight into religious activities, economic functions, and visitors who frequented the site during these later periods. \nToday the terraces of Deir el-Bahari only convey a faint impression of the original intentions of Senenmut. Most of the statue ornaments are missing – the statues of Osiris in front of the pillars of the upper colonnade, the sphinx avenues in front of the court, and the standing, sitting, and kneeling figures of Hatshepsut; some of these were destroyed in a posthumous condemnation of this pharaoh while others were rededicated to Thutmose III. The architecture of the temple has been considerably altered as a result of misguided reconstruction in the early twentieth century AD.\n\nArchitecture\nWhile Hatshepsut used Mentuhotep's temple as a model, the two structures are significantly different. Hatshepsut employed a lengthy colonnaded terrace that deviated from the centralized massing of Mentuhotep's model – an anomaly that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber.\nThere are three layered terraces reaching 97 feet (30 m) in height. Each 'story' is articulated by a double colonnade of square piers, with the exception of the northwest corner of the central terrace, which employs Proto-Doric columns to house the chapel.\nThese terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens. The layering of Hatshepsut's temple corresponds with the classical Theban form, employing pylon, courts, hypostyle hall, sun court, chapel, and sanctuary.\nThe relief sculpture within Hatshepsut's temple recites the tale of the divine birth of the pharaoh. The text and pictorial cycle also tell of an expedition to the Land of Punt, an exotic country on the Red Sea coast.\nOn either side of the entrance to the sanctuary (shown right) are painted pillars with images of Hathor as the capitals. Just under the roof is an image of Wadjet, displayed as a bilateral solar symbol, flanked by two other long serpents.\nThe temple includes an image, shown to the right, of Hatshepsut depicted as male pharaoh giving offerings to Horus, and to their left, an animal skin wound around a tall staff that is a symbol of the god Osiris.\nWhile the statues and ornamentation have since been stolen or destroyed, the temple once was home to two statues of Osiris, a long avenue lined by sphinxes, as well as many sculptures of pharaoh Hatshepsut in different attitudes – standing, sitting, or kneeling.\n\nConservation efforts\nSince the early 20th century, continuous archaeological and conservation work has been undertaken to preserve the Temple of Hatshepsut. As part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Thebes the temple has been a focal point of archaeological and conservation efforts for over a century.\nThe conservation of the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari has been a continuous effort, addressing structural instability, environmental damage, and past restoration methods. Large-scale excavation and conservation work began in the 19th century with Auguste Mariette, followed by Édouard Naville, who conducted documentation and reconstruction efforts between 1891 and 1908. In the early 20th century, Herbert Winlock and the Metropolitan Museum of Art focused on stabilizing the temple’s walls and reinforcing weakened structures. Later, Émile Baraize of the French Antiquities Service carried out additional reconstructions using stone, concrete, and gypsum, though records of these interventions were limited.\nSince the 1960s, Polish archaeological missions have led major conservation projects, particularly on the festival courtyard, coronation portico, and royal cult complex. The Hatshepsut Chapel, located on the temple's upper terrace has been a primary focus due to its archaeological significance and vulnerability. In the 2000s, modern technologies such as 3D scanning and damage mapping were introduced to assess structural weaknesses, revealing cracks, missing sections, and displaced blocks from earlier restorations. Conservation teams reinforced walls, stabilized the foundations, and analyzed ancient mortars to develop improved preservation methods.\nA significant discovery in 2013 was a tomb beneath the Hatshepsut Chapel containing burials from the 23rd-25th Dynasties, which required additional stabilization measures. Structural reinforcements were implemented, including the installation of a protective manhole for controlled access. Conservationists have also focused on preserving stone surfaces and polychrome decorations affected by environmental exposure. Ongoing research continues to refine preservation strategies with long-term plans integrating climate impact assessments, stone conservation, and controlled reconstruction to maintain the structural and historical integrity of the temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Thutmose III\nThe Mortuary Temple of Thutmose III, also called Djeser-Akhet (Holy of the Horizon), was discovered in 1961; the mortuary temple of Thutmose III was built in at about 1435-1425 BC, late in Thutmose's reign. It overlooks other earlier structures present on the site, such as the temples of Hatshepsut and Mentuhotep Nebhepetre. Built on a steep, artificially leveled terrace, the temple features a basilica-style hypostyle hall with clerestory windows, a rare architectural innovation that foreshadowed the later hypostyle halls of the Ramesside Period. The temple complex was primarily dedicated to Amun-Ra, reflecting the King's close association with the Theban-state god. A key highlight is the Hathor shrine, discovered in 1906, which housed a statue of hathor as a cow protecting the king. The temple's reliefs, recovered in thousands of fragments, show Thutmose III in vibrant polychrome scenes performing rituals, offering to gods, and participating in the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.\nRediscovered in 1962 by a Polish-Egyptian mission, the site revealed column bases, a red granite doorway, and vast amounts of painted limestone and sandstone reliefs. Excavations also uncovered statues of Thutmose III, foundation deposits beneath the Hathor chapel containing botanical offerings, faience amulets, and pottery The temple was heavily damaged by an 11th century BCE earthquake and subsequent stone-robbing, leaving only foundations and scattered architectural elements. Despite its ruinous state, the temple's design closely mirrors Hatshepsut's nearby temple while innovating with its elevated basilica-style hall. Over time the site became a focus for the worship of Hathor during the Third Intermediate Period, as indicated by later votive offerings. Today the reconstructed reliefs and artifacts from Djeser-Akhet contribute significantly to the understanding of royal cult practices and 18th Dynasty temple architecture.\nThere are ongoing conservation efforts including a reconstruction of the temple's layout which have been made difficult by the severity of the destruction in some areas of the temple. Some progress, however, has been made on the reconstruction of the layout of the upper terrace.\n\nRoyal and non-royal tombs\nA tomb (TT320) in a hidden recess in the cliffs to the south of the temples contained a cache of forty royal mummies, moved there from the Valley of the Kings. The bodies had been placed there by Twenty-first Dynasty priests, most likely to prevent further desecration and looting. The tomb was probably originally built for priests of the 21st Dynasty, most likely the family of Pinedjem II. In the cache were found the mummies of Ahmose I, along with the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX. In a separate room were found Twenty-first dynasty High Priests and pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. The discovery of the mummies cache is depicted in the Egyptian movie The Night of Counting the Years (1969).\nIn 1891, a larger cache of 153 reburied mummies of the priests themselves also were found in a tomb at the site, known today as Bab el-Gasus 'Gate of the Priests' (also referred to as the \"Priestly Cache\" or \"Second Cache\").\nPrivate tombs dating from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic period are also situated here. There are two most notable private tombs at Deir el-Bahari. The first is that of Meketre (TT280), which contained many painted wooden funerary models from the Middle Kingdom and the first recorded human-headed canopic jar.\nThe second, the \"secret\" tomb of Senenmut – the architect and steward who oversaw the construction of the temple for Hatshepsut – was begun in the complex also. Senenmut's tomb was vandalized in antiquity, but some of the relief artwork is still intact. It was meant to be a very large tomb and its corridors are over 100 yards (91 m) long. However, it was never finished and Senenmut was not interred there. He has another tomb, not far from Deir el-Bahari, where his body may have been placed, but it, too, was vandalized and robbed.\nA large area of non-royal tombs in this vicinity is called Sheikh Abd el-Qurna.\n\nStone chest\nIn March 2020 archeologists from Warsaw University's Institute of Archaeology, led by Andrzej Niwiński, discovered a treasure chest and a wooden box dating back 3,500 years in the Egyptian site of Deir el-Bahari.\nThe stone chest contained several items, with all of them covered with linen canvas. Three bundles of flax were found during the excavation. A goose skeleton, sacrificed for religious purposes, was found inside one of them. The second one included goose eggs. It is believed that what the third bundle contained was an ibis egg, which had a symbolic meaning for the ancient Egyptians. In addition, a little wooden trinket box was discovered inside the bundle; the box is believed to contain the name Pharaoh Thutmose II.\nAccording to the Andrzej Niwiński, \"The chest itself is about 40 cm long, with a slight smaller height. It was perfectly camouflaged, looked like an ordinary stone block. Only after a closer look did it turn out to be a chest.\"\n\nContemporary issues and tourism\nToday, Deir el-Bahari is one of Egypt's most visited archaeological sites and part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing \"Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis\". Its restored terraces, particularly Hatshepsut's temple, attract thousands of tourists annually, drawn by the site's architectural beauty and historical significance. The Polish-Egyptian Conservation Project has been instrumental in transforming the once-ruined site into a partially reconstructed monument with accessible terraces, restored statues, and visitor pathways. However, parts of the site such as Mentuhotep II's temple remain off-limits due to their fragile condition. Modern infrastructure including interpretive signage and a visitor center, aims to balance public access with heritage preservation, while the site continues to be a focal point of scholarly research and conservation.\nDeir el-Bahari has also been a focal point for modern security concerns. On November 17, 1997, the site was the scene of the Luxor Massacre, when militants killed over 60 tourists at Hatshepsut's temple, causing a severe blow to Egypt's tourism industry. Since then, the Egyptian government has implemented extensive security measures including armed Tourist Police, metal detectors and surveillance systems. While tourism has recovered in the years since the attack, the event remains a stark reminder of the vulnerability of cultural heritage sites to political violence. Despite this, Deir el-Bahari continues to thrive as a key destination within the Luxor region's tourism economy, representing both a testament to Egypt's enduring legacy and a symbol of resilience in the face of modern threats.\n\nArt\nKaska, Dance of War is a painting by Shefa Salem that depicts Libyan soldiers performing a kaska dance of the Timihu people, which was first recorded 5000 years ago at Deir El-Bahari.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nThebes, Egypt\n\nSources\nMertz, Barbara (1964). \"Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs\".

          "content": "Le site de Deir el-Bahari est un complexe funéraire, composé de temples et de tombes, situé sur la rive gauche du Nil face à la ville de Louxor et des temples de Karnak, légèrement au sud de la vallée des Rois, adossé à la paroi rocheuse de la montagne de Thèbes, en Haute-Égypte.\nLe nom arabe de ce site (دير البحري;, dayr al-baḥrī, « le couvent du Nord ») rappelle l’existence du couvent copte élevé dans ce lieu.\nSur la rive gauche du Nil, en face de Karnak, la falaise de la chaîne Libyque dessine un vaste amphithéâtre qui marque le centre de la nécropole thébaine.\n\nPrincipales constructions\nLes principaux monuments sont les suivants :\n\nseconde moitié du XXIe siècle AEC : construction, par le roi Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie), d'un temple funéraire associée à la sépulture du roi ; les reconstitutions du temple diffèrent : Édouard Naville émit l'hypothèse d'un temple à double terrasse surmonté d'une petite pyramide, mais récemment les égyptologues Dieter Arnold et Rainer Stadelmann ont remplacé cette pyramide — dont on n'a retrouvé aucun indice matériel —, par un mastaba ou un tumulus,\ndébut du XXe siècle AEC : construction d'un complexe funéraire, resté inachevé, par le roi Montouhotep III, fils du précédent,\nmilieu du XVe siècle AEC : construction, par la reine Hatchepsout (XVIIIe dynastie), d'un temple funéraire, auquel le nom de Deir el-Bahari fait le plus souvent allusion,\nmilieu du XVe siècle AEC : construction, par le roi Thoutmôsis III, neveu et beau-fils de la précédente, d'un temple vôtif.\n\nTemple funéraire de Montouhotep II\nLe temple funéraire le plus ambitieux et innovant de Deir el-Bahari est celui de Montouhotep II, souverain de la XIe dynastie qui a réuni l’Égypte au Moyen Empire. Les nombreuses innovations architecturales du temple marquent une rupture avec la tradition des complexes pyramidaux de l'Ancien Empire et préfigurent les temples des millions d'années du Nouvel Empire.\nLe choix de cet emplacement est certainement lié à l'origine thébaine de la XIe dynastie : les prédécesseurs de Montouhotep sur le trône thébain sont tous enterrés dans des tombeaux à proximité. Il a peut-être également choisi Deir el-Bahari parce qu'il est en face du temple de Karnak, de l'autre côté du Nil. Ainsi, la statue d'Amon est apportée chaque année à Deir el-Bahari pendant la Belle fête de la vallée, ce que le roi peut avoir perçu comme bénéfique pour son culte funéraire.\nLe complexe funéraire comprend deux temples : le temple funéraire de Deir el-Bahari et le temple de la vallée situé plus près du Nil sur des terres cultivées et qui n'existe plus. Les deux temples sont reliés par une chaussée découverte de 1,2 km de long et 46 m de large.\nLe temple funéraire est sur plusieurs niveaux ; une rampe mène à une terrasse de soixante mètres de large, quarante-trois mètres de profondeur sur laquelle se dresse un grand tumulus carré entouré de cent quarante colonnes octogonales disposées en trois rangées. Le long du mur ouest de ce déambulatoire se trouvaient les sanctuaires de la statue et les tombeaux de plusieurs épouses et filles royales. Ces princesses royales étaient les prêtresses d'Hathor, l'une des principales divinités funéraires égyptiennes. S’il reste peu de choses de la sépulture du roi, six sarcophages ont été trouvés dans les tombeaux des dames royales (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kaouit, Kemsit, Muyet et Sadhe). Chacun d’eux était constitué de six dalles, maintenues ensemble par des attaches métalliques et sculptées en relief. Le sarcophage de la reine Kaouit est aujourd'hui au Musée du Caire (JE 47397).\nLe vestibule est entouré de murs sur trois côtés, le quatrième côté comporte une rampe, reconstituée en 1905 par Naville sur les vestiges de la rampe originale, entourée de deux portiques à double rangée de piliers rectangulaires. Au milieu du vestibule, une ouverture appelée Bab el-Hosan (« Porte du cavalier ») mène à un passage souterrain et à une tombe où un cénotaphe inachevé contient une statue assise du roi. Sur le côté ouest, des tamaris et des sycomores étaient plantés à côté de la rampe.\nÀ l'arrière du vestibule et de la terrasse se trouvent des colonnades décorées en relief avec des processions de bateaux, des chasses et des scènes montrant les exploits militaires du roi.\nDes statues du roi de la douzième dynastie, Sésostris III, ont été retrouvées en ce lieu.\nLa partie intérieure du temple est creusée dans la falaise et se compose d'une cour à péristyle, d'une salle hypostyle et d'un passage souterrain menant à la tombe elle-même. Le culte du roi mort était centré sur le petit sanctuaire taillé à l’arrière de la salle hypostyle.\nUne rampe funéraire et un tunnel descendent sur cent cinquante mètres et aboutissent dans une chambre funéraire située à quarante-cinq mètres sous la cour. La chambre contient un sanctuaire qui abritait autrefois le cercueil en bois de Montouhotep.\n\nTemple funéraire de Montouhotep III\nMontouhotep III choisit de se faire construire une tombe avec un temple funéraire à une centaine de mètres du temple funéraire de son père, derrière la colline de Cheikh Abd el-Gournah ; le monument resta inachevée. Peu de choses restent de ce temple : il ne reste que les vestiges d'une chaussée aboutissant à la plateforme du temple et un passage en pente creusé dans la paroi rocheuse ; ce passage mène à une chambre au plafond en encorbellement, construite en blocs de quartzite rouge. Des graffitis hiératiques gravés à cet endroit semblent avoir été écrits par des prêtres du culte funéraire du roi et indiquent que, malgré l'inachèvement du monument, l'enterrement du roi a bien eu lieu.\n\nTemple funéraire d'Hatchepsout\nLe Djeser-Djeseru, « le Saint des Saints », est le temple funéraire d'Hatchepsout. Il s’agit d’une structure à colonnade conçue et mise en œuvre par Sénènmout, intendant royal et architecte d'Hatchepsout. Il se trouve au sommet d'une série de terrasses, auxquelles on accède par de longues rampes entourées de jardins. Il est considéré comme l'un des monuments incomparables de l'Égypte ancienne.\nBien qu'Hatchepsout se soit inspirée du temple de Montouhotep, Sénènmout a créé une longue terrasse à colonnades sans rapport avec la terrasse de Montouhotep - une différence qui pourrait s’expliquer par l'emplacement décentralisé de la chambre funéraire.\nLes trois terrasses se superposent et comprennent chacune une double colonnade de piliers carrés, à l'exception du coin nord-ouest de la terrasse centrale, qui emploie des colonnes proto-doriques pour abriter la chapelle. Ces terrasses sont reliées par de longues rampes qui étaient autrefois entourées de jardins, avec de l'encens et des arbres à myrrhe. La superposition du temple d'Hatchepsout correspond à la forme thébaine classique, utilisant un pylône, des cours, une salle hypostyle, une cour solaire, une chapelle et un sanctuaire.\nLes décors sculptés du temple d'Hatchepsout racontent l'histoire de la naissance divine du pharaon. Ils évoquent également une expédition au pays de Pount, un pays exotique situé sur la côte de la mer Rouge. De chaque côté de l'entrée du sanctuaire se trouvent des piliers peints avec des représentations d'Hathor. Juste sous le toit se trouve une image de la déesse Ouadjet. Le temple comprend une représentation d'Hatchepsout en pharaon mâle offrant des offrandes à Horus.\nLes statues et ornements du temple ont été volés ou détruits. Ils comprenaient deux statues d'Osiris, une longue avenue bordée de sphinx, ainsi que de nombreuses sculptures de la pharaon Hatchepsout dans différentes attitudes - debout, assise ou agenouillée.\n\nTemple funéraire de Thoutmôsis III\nThoutmôsis III a construit un temple dédié à Amon. Découvert en 1961, il aurait été utilisé lors de la Belle fête de la vallée. On sait peu de choses sur le complexe, car il a été abandonné après avoir subi de graves dommages lors d'un glissement de terrain qui a eu lieu dans la XXe dynastie. Après cette période, il a été utilisé comme source de matériaux de construction et à l’époque chrétienne, il est devenu le site d’un cimetière copte.\nConstruit à la fois en grès et en calcaire, l'érection du temple a été supervisée par le haut fonctionnaire Rekhmirê, vizir de Thoutmôsis III, au cours de la dernière décennie du règne du roi. Une série d'ostraca trouvée sur le site et publiée par William Christopher Hayes en 1960 révèle que la construction a commencé en l’an 43 du règne et n’était probablement pas achevée en l’an 54, année de la mort de Thoutmôsis. Le temple a probablement été achevé par son successeur Amenhotep II, dans les premières années de son règne.\n\nNécropole\nLa nécropole devint fortement utilisée au cours de la XIe dynastie, ceci est probableemnt lié au fait que Montouhotep II choisit de s'y faire enterrer. D'autres tombes plus tardives y seront construites, ou réutilisées dont les fameuses caches royales TT320 et Bab el-Gasous au cours de la XXIe dynastie.\n\nCache royale TT320\nUne tombe (TT320) dans un recoin caché des falaises au sud des temples était initialement prévue pour être la dernière demeure du premier prophète d'Amon Pinedjem II, sa femme Neskhons et plusieurs autres membres de sa famille.\nÀ la mort de Pinedjem II, vers -969, le royaume est en déclin. Les prêtres de la XXIe dynastie y transportent quarante momies royales provenant de la vallée des Rois pour les protéger des pillages.\nDans la cache se trouvaient les momies des rois :\n\nAmenhotep Ier, deuxième souverain de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nAhmôsis Ier, roi fondateur de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nRamsès Ier, roi fondateur de la XIXe dynastie ;\nRamsès II, troisième souverain de la XIXe dynastie ;\nRamsès III, deuxième roi de la XXe dynastie ;\nRamsès IX, huitième pharaon de la XXe dynastie ;\nSéthi Ier, deuxième souverain de la XIXe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis Ier, troisième souverain de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis II, quatrième pharaon de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis III, sixième roi de la XVIIIe dynastie.\nAinsi que les personnes royales et prêtres :\n\nIâhhotep Ire\nAhmès-Néfertary\nAhmès-Hénoutemipet, fille de Seqenenrê Tâa\nAhmès-Hénouttamehou\nAhmès-Inhapy\nAhmosé-Méritamon, fille d'Ahmôsis Ier\nAhmosé-Sipair\nSatamon, fille d'Ahmôsis Ier\nAhmès-Satkamosé\nBakt\nDjedptahioufânkh, époux de Nesytanebetisherou\nDouathathor-Henouittaoui\nIset, mère de Thoutmôsis III\nIsetemkheb III\nMaâtkarê\nMasaharta\nMérymosé\nNebseni\nNeskhons\nNesytanebetisherou, fille de Pinedjem II\nNedjemet\nOuepmosé\nOupouaout-Mosé\nPaheripedjet\nPédiamon\nPinedjem Ier\nPinedjem II\nRai, nourrice d'Ahmès-Néfertary\nSeniou\nSiamon, fils d'Ahmôsis Ier\nSiese\nSoutymosé\nTayouheret\nTétishéri\nainsi que huit autres momies non identifiées.\n\nCachette Bab el-Gasous\nAutre cachette de Deir el-Bahari, Bab el-Gasous, la « Porte des Prêtres », a été découverte en 1891, au nord de la cour inférieure du temple de la reine Hatchepsout. Il s’agit d’une grande tombe collective abritant plusieurs centaines de cercueils ainsi qu’une grande quantité d’objets rituels du clergé d’Amon de la XXIe dynastie.\nDatant probablement de -950, elle a permis de regrouper en un seul lieu plus facile à surveiller, les momies des prêtres et prêtresses inhumés initialement dans des tombes individuelles ainsi que leur mobilier funéraire.\nAprès sa découverte, la tombe a été vidée de tous ses artéfacts en quelques jours par les égyptologues français Georges Daressy, Eugène Grébaut et Urbain Bouriant, sans que ceux-ci ne procèdent à des relevés archéologiques des couloirs, ni ne dressent de liste du contenu des lieux. Seules les gravures parues dans la presse permettent d’illustrer son agencement intérieur.\n\nMMA 60\nLa tombe MMA 60 a servi de tombe commune à plusieurs membres de la famille dirigeant Thèbes pendant la XXIe dynastie, dont le grand prêtre d'Amon Menkhéperrê.\n\nTombes privées\nDes tombes privées datant du Moyen Empire à l’époque ptolémaïque ont été également trouvées sur le site.\n\nTT240 - Merou – porteur du sceau royal et superviseur des porteurs de sceaux sous le règne de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT308 – Kemsit – prêtresse d'Hathor et épouse de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT310 – Nom inconnu – chancelier du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT311 – Khéti – trésorier du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT312 – Nespakashouty – gouverneur de la ville et vizir sous le règne de Psammétique Ier (XXVIe dynastie) ;\nTT313 – Henou – explorateur (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT314 – Horhotep – porteur du sceau du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT315 – Ipi – gouverneur de la ville, vizir et juge sous le règne de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT316 – Néferhotep - chef des archers (XIIe dynastie) ;\nTT319 – Néférou II - épouse de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT320 – la cache initialement prévue pour le premier prophète d'Amon Pinedjem II (XXIe dynastie) ;\nTT353 – Sénènmout – grand majordome de la reine Hatchepsout (XVIIIe dynastie) - architecte et intendant qui supervisait la construction du temple d'Hatchepsout.

          "content": "The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II (\"Ramesses the Great\"). It is located in the Theban Necropolis in Upper Egypt, on the west of the River Nile, across from the modern city of Luxor. \nIt is the second largest temple in Egypt, occupying an area of c. 10 hectares (1,100,000 sq ft).\nIt was originally called the House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amun. Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II.\n\nHistory\nRamesses II modified, usurped, or constructed many buildings from the ground up, and the most splendid of these, in accordance with New Kingdom royal burial practices, would have been his memorial temple: a place of worship dedicated to pharaoh, god on earth, where his memory would have been kept alive after his death. Surviving records indicate that work on the project began shortly after the start of his reign and continued for 20 years.\nThe design of Ramesses's mortuary temple adheres to the standard canons of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple itself comprised two stone pylons (gateways, some 60 metres (200 ft) wide), one after the other, each leading into a courtyard. Beyond the second courtyard, at the centre of the complex, was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary. An enormous pylon stood before the first court, with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back. As was customary, the pylons and outer walls were decorated with scenes commemorating the pharaoh's military victories and leaving due record of his dedication to, and kinship with, the gods. In Ramesses's case, much importance is placed on the Battle of Kadesh (ca. 1274 BC); more intriguingly, however, one block atop the first pylon records his pillaging, in the eighth year of his reign, a city called \"Shalem\", which may or may not have been Jerusalem. The scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before Kadesh, as portrayed in the canons of the \"epic poem of Pentaur\", can still be seen on the pylon.\nUnlike the massive stone temples that Ramesses ordered carved from the face of the Nubian mountains at Abu Simbel, the inexorable passage of three millennia was not kind to his \"temple of a million years\" at Thebes. This was mostly due to its location on the very edge of the Nile floodplain, with the annual inundation gradually undermining the foundations of this temple and its neighbours. Neglect and the arrival of new faiths also took their toll: for example, in the early years of the Christian Era, the temple was put into service as a Christian church.\nThis is all standard fare for a temple of its kind built at that time. Leaving aside the escalation of scale – whereby each successive New Kingdom pharaoh strove to outdo his predecessors in volume and scope – the Ramesseum is largely cast in the same mould as the ruined temple of Amenhotep III that stood behind the \"Colossi of Memnon\" a kilometre or so away, and Ramesses III's Medinet Habu which closely followed the plan of the Ramesseum. Instead, the significance that the Ramesseum enjoys today owes more to the time and manner of its rediscovery by Europeans.\n\nDescription\nFirst courtyard\nThe Ramesseum was entered through a Pylon which led to the first courtyard. At its rear stood a pair of colossal statues, which flanked the second pylon. The larger of the two was called \"Sun of the princes\" and represented Ramesses, the smaller one his mother Tuya.\nOnly fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh, which is estimated to have weighed 1,000 tonnes (2,200,000 lb) with a height of 16–19 metres (52–62 ft). It was transported 220 kilometres (140 mi) from the quarry to the Ramesseum. It is one of the largest colossal statues in the world. However, fragments of four even larger granite colossi of Ramesses were found in Tanis (northern Egypt) with an estimated height of 21 to 28 metres (69 to 92 ft).\n\nSecond courtyard\nRemains of the second court include part of the internal façade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right. Scenes of war and the rout of the Hittites at Kadesh are repeated on the walls. In the upper registers, are shown a feast in honour of the phallic god Min, god of fertility. On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still left furnish an idea of the original grandeur. Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king which once flanked the entrance to the temple can also be seen, one in pink granite and the other in black granite. The head of one of these has been removed to the British Museum. Thirty-nine out of the forty-eight columns in the great hypostyle hall, which is 41 by 31 metres (130 by 100 ft), still stand in the central rows. They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various gods. Part of the ceiling, decorated with gold stars on a blue, ground has also been preserved. The sons and daughters of Ramesses appear in the procession on the few walls left. The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms, with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell. Part of the first room, with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes, and a few remains of the second room are all that is left.\nAdjacent to the north of the hypostyle hall was a smaller temple; this was dedicated to Ramesses's mother, Tuya, and to his beloved chief wife, Nefertari. To the south of the first courtyard stood the temple palace. The complex was surrounded by various storerooms, granaries, workshops, and other ancillary buildings, some built as late as Roman times.\nA temple of Seti I, of which nothing is now left but the foundations, once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall. It consisted of a peristyle court with two chapel shrines. The entire complex was surrounded by mudbrick walls which started at the gigantic southeast pylon.\nA cache of papyri and ostraca dating back to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 8th centuries BC) indicates that the temple was also the site of an important scribal school.\nThe site was in use before Ramesses had the first stone put in place: beneath the hypostyle hall, modern archaeologists have found a shaft tomb from the Middle Kingdom, yielding a rich hoard of religious and funerary artefacts.\n\nRamesseum king list\nThe memorial temple of Ramesses II, also called simply the Ramesseum, contains a minor list of pharaohs of ancient Egypt. The scene with the list was first published by Jean-Francois Champollion in 1845, and by Karl Richard Lepsius four years later. \nThe upper register of the second western pylon, shows a processions where ancestors of Ramesses II are honored at ceremonies of the festival of Min. It contains 19 cartouches with the names of 14 pharaohs, listing less pharaohs than his kings list in Abydos. Notably, Hatshepsut and the Amarna pharaohs are omitted.\n\nThe scene is divided in two parts, one with 14 statues of the ancestral kings being carried in a procession on the left side. The second part is a procession led by six kings, but only the name of five remain.\n\nThe scene remains in situ in the upper register of the second western pylon. The later Medinet Habu king list of Ramesses III is very similar in design, but only lists nine pharaohs.\n\nStorage\nThe storerooms surround the temple on three sides, forming three groups, with the oldest behind the temple. The site is notable for its true arches made of mud bricks that were not wedge-shaped as proper voussoirs, but simply held in place by mortar and thus prone to collapse, leaving very few examples still standing. Ramesseum has the oldest such arch still standing in Egypt (c. 1300 BC).\nEach granary in the oldest group was approximately 32 metres (105 ft) in length, 3.7 m (12 ft) wide and 3.5 m (11 ft) high, with a bottom wall thickness of 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The springing level of a barrel vault at the height of approximately 2.5 m (8.2 ft), with arcs build as four courses of mud bricks 40 by 20 by 12 to 14 centimetres (15.7 by 7.9 by 4.7 to 5.5 in) in size.\n\nExcavation and studies\nThe origins of modern Egyptology can be traced to the arrival in Egypt of Napoleon Bonaparte in the summer of 1798.\nWhile undeniably an invasion by an alien imperialist power, this was nonetheless an invasion of its times, informed by Enlightenment ideas: alongside Napoleon's troops went men of science, the same whose toil under the desert sun would later yield the seminal 23-volume Description de l'Égypte. Two French engineers, Jean-Baptiste Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage, were assigned to study the Ramesseum site, and it was with much fanfare that they identified it with the \"Tomb of Ozymandias\" or \"Palace of Memnon\" of which Diodorus of Sicily had written in the 1st century BC.\nThe next visitor of note was Giovanni Belzoni, a showman and engineer of Italian origin and, latterly, an archaeologist and antiques dealer. Belzoni's travels took him in 1815 to Cairo, where he sold Mehemet Ali a hydraulic engine of his own invention. There he met British Consul General Henry Salt, who hired his services to collect from the temple in Thebes the so-called 'Younger Memnon', the torso of one of two colossal granite statues depicting Ramesses II, and transport it to England. Thanks to Belzoni's hydraulics and his skill as an engineer (Napoleon's men had failed in the same endeavour a decade or so earlier), the 7-ton stone head arrived in London in 1818, where it was dubbed \"The Younger Memnon\" and, some years later, given pride of place in the British Museum.\n\nIt was against the backdrop of intense excitement surrounding the statue's arrival, and having heard wondrous tales of other, less transportable treasures still in the desert, that the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned his sonnet \"Ozymandias\". In particular, one massive fallen statue at the Ramesseum is now inextricably linked with Shelley, because of the cartouche on its shoulder bearing Ramesses's throne name, User-maat-re Setep-en-re, the first part of which Diodorus transliterated into Greek as \"Ozymandias\".\nWhile Shelley's \"vast and trunkless legs of stone\" owe more to poetic license than to archaeology, the \"half sunk... shattered visage\" lying on the sand is an accurate description of part of the wrecked statue. The hands, and the feet, lie nearby. Were it still standing, the Ozymandias colossus would tower 19 m (62 ft) above the ground, rivalling the Colossi of Memnon and the statues of Ramesses carved into the mountain at Abu Simbel.\nThe name of the Ramesseum – or at least its French form Rhamesséion – was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls. \nA joint French-Egyptian team has been exploring and restoring the Ramesseum and its environs since 1991. Among their discoveries during excavations include kitchens, bakeries and supply rooms for the temple to the south, and a school where boys were taught to be scribes to the southeast. Some of the challenges in preserving the area have been the control of modern Egyptian farmers using the area for farming and encroaching on the ruins.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nRamesseum magician's box\nList of largest monoliths in the world\n\nReferences\nSources\nEl-Derby, Abdou A.O.D.; Elyamani, Ahmed (2016-02-29). \"The Adobe Barrel Vaulted Structures In Ancient Egypt: A Study Of Two Case Studies For Conservation Purposes\".

          "content": "Le Ramesséum est le temple des millions d'années de Ramsès II, faisant aussi office d’université, situé dans la nécropole thébaine, en face de Louxor, en Égypte.\n\nExploration et fouilles\nLe temple a été visité vers 300 avant notre ère par Hécatée d'Abdère, visite qui nous est rapportée au Ier siècle avant notre ère par l'historien grec Diodore de Sicile ; dans ses recueils, il décrit ce « Tombeau d'Osymandyas » « comme le plus majestueux de toute l'Égypte ».\nLes origines de l'égyptologie moderne remontent à l'arrivée en Égypte de Napoléon Bonaparte durant l'été 1798. Bien qu'il s'agisse indéniablement d'une invasion par une puissance impérialiste étrangère, elle n'en était pas moins une invasion de son temps, imprégnée des idées des Lumières : aux côtés des troupes napoléoniennes se trouvaient des hommes de science, ceux-là mêmes dont le labeur sous le soleil du désert allait plus tard donner naissance à la Description de l'Égypte, œuvre fondatrice en 23 volumes. Deux ingénieurs français, Jean-Baptiste Prosper Jollois et Édouard de Villiers du Terrage, furent chargés d'étudier le site du Ramesséum, et c'est avec en grande pompe qu'ils l'identifièrent au « Tombeau d'Ozymandias » ou « Palais de Memnon » décrit par Diodore de Sicile au Ier siècle av. J.-C..\nLe visiteur suivant d'importance fut Giovanni Battista Belzoni, homme de spectacle et ingénieur d'origine italienne, devenu par la suite archéologue et antiquaire. En 1815, les voyages de Belzoni le menèrent au Caire, où il vendit à Méhémet Ali une machine hydraulique de sa propre invention. Il y rencontra le consul général britannique Henry Salt, qui engagea ses services pour récupérer au temple de Thèbes le « Jeune Memnon », le torse de l'une des deux statues colossales en granit représentant Ramsès II, et le transporter en Angleterre. Grâce à l'ingénierie hydraulique de Belzoni et à son talent d'ingénieur (les hommes de Napoléon avaient échoué dans la même entreprise une dizaine d'années auparavant), la tête de pierre de sept tonnes arriva à Londres en 1818, où elle fut baptisée « The Younger Memnon » et, quelques années plus tard, accéda à une place de choix au British Museum.\n\nC’est dans le contexte de l’intense effervescence qui entourait l’arrivée de la statue, et après avoir entendu des récits merveilleux d’autres trésors, moins transportables, encore enfouis dans le désert, que le poète Percy Bysshe Shelley composa son sonnet « Ozymandias ». Une statue massive en granit rose, tombée au Ramesséum, est désormais indissociable de Shelley, en raison du cartouche gravé sur son épaule, portant le nom de trône de Ramsès, Ouser-maât-rê Setep-en-rê, dont Diodore a transcrit la première partie en grec : « Ozymandias ». Si les « vastes jambes de pierre sans tronc » décrites par Shelley relèvent davantage de la licence poétique que de l’archéologie, le « visage à demi enfoui... brisé » gisant sur le sable décrit avec précision une partie de la statue détruite. Les mains et les pieds gisent à proximité. Si elle était encore debout, la statue d'Ozymandias, d'un poids approximatif de mille tonnes, culminerait à 16-19 mètres de hauteur, rivalisant avec les Colosses de Memnon et les statues de Ramsès sculptées d'Abou Simbel.\nLe nom du Ramesséum – ou du moins sa forme française Rhamesséion – a été donné par Jean-François Champollion, qui visita les ruines du site en 1829 et identifia le premier les hiéroglyphes composant les noms et titres de Ramsès sur les murs.\nUne équipe franco-égyptienne, avec l’« Association pour la Sauvegarde du Ramesseum », explore et restaure le Ramesséum et ses environs depuis 1991. Parmi leurs découvertes lors des fouilles figurent des cuisines, des boulangeries et des réserves pour le temple au sud, ainsi qu'une école où les garçons apprenaient le métier de scribe au sud-est. La préservation du site a été notamment entravée par la présence d'agriculteurs égyptiens modernes qui exploitent la zone et empiètent sur les ruines.\n\nHistoire\nRamsès II a modifié, usurpé ou construit de nombreux édifices, dont le plus somptueux, conformément aux pratiques funéraires royales du Nouvel Empire, était sans doute son temple des millions d'années : un lieu de culte dédié au roi, dieu sur terre, où son souvenir était perpétué après sa mort. Les archives qui nous sont parvenues indiquent que les travaux commencèrent peu après le début de son règne et se poursuivirent pendant vingt ans.\nLa conception du temple des millions d'années de Ramsès II respecte les canons architecturaux des temples du Nouvel Empire. Orienté nord-ouest/sud-est, le temple se composait de deux pylônes de pierre (portes d'une soixantaine de mètres de large) se succédant, chacun donnant sur une cour. Au-delà de la seconde cour, au centre du complexe, se trouvait une salle hypostyle couverte à quarante-huit colonnes, entourant le sanctuaire intérieur. Un pylône imposant se dressait devant la première cour, avec le palais royal à gauche et la statue colossale du roi dominant le fond. Comme le voulait la coutume, les pylônes et les murs extérieurs étaient ornés de scènes commémorant les victoires militaires du pharaon et témoignant de son dévouement aux dieux et de son lien de parenté avec eux. Dans le cas de Ramsès, une grande importance est accordée à la bataille de Qadesh en l'an 5 de son règne. Les scènes du grand pharaon et de son armée triomphant des forces hittites fuyant devant Qadesh, telles que décrites dans les canons de l'« épopée de Pentaour (en) », sont encore visibles sur le pylône.\nContrairement aux temples de pierre massifs que Ramsès fit sculpter à flanc de montagne à Abou Simbel, le passage inexorable de trois millénaires n'épargna pas son « temple d'un million d'années » à Thèbes. Cela était principalement dû à sa situation en bordure de la plaine inondable du Nil, les crues annuelles érodant progressivement les fondations de ce temple et de ses voisins. La négligence et l'arrivée de nouvelles religions contribuèrent également à son fragilisation : par exemple, au début de l'ère chrétienne, le temple fut transformé en église chrétienne.\nLe temple de Ramsès II est typique des temples des millions d'années construits au Nouvel Empire. Mis à part la surenchère architecturale – chaque roi du Nouvel Empire s'efforçant de surpasser son prédécesseur en volume et en ampleur –, le Ramesséum est en grande partie conçu sur le même modèle que le temple de millions d'années d'Amenhotep III, situé derrière les Colosses de Memnon, à environ un kilomètre au sud du Ramesséum, et que temple des millions d'années de Ramsès III à Médinet Habou, dont le plan était très proche de celui du Ramesséum. En réalité, l'importance dont jouit aujourd'hui le Ramesséum tient davantage à la date et aux circonstances de sa redécouverte par les Européens.\n\nDescription\nAu nord des colosses de Memnon, situé entre le temple des millions d'années d'Amenhotep II au nord et celui de Thoutmôsis IV au sud, sur la rive gauche de Thèbes « la ville aux cent portes », est érigé le Ramesséum dont il ne subsiste aujourd'hui que des ruines. La superficie de ce temple est d'environ dix hectares.\nLe « château de millions d'années » constituait l'endroit où le renouvellement de l'essence divine de pharaon était célébré. Vaste domaine, ceint d'un haut mur d'enceinte, en son centre se trouvait le temple, entouré de bâtiments pour les célébrations des fêtes, des bureaux administratifs, maisons de prêtres, atelier, entrepôts et un palais où résidait Ramsès lors de sa venue sur le site. Important centre économique, culturel et religieux, le château de millions d'années était un point de convergence intellectuelle et de réflexion théologique. La publication en 1928 par Kurt Heinrich Sethe du papyrus dramatique du Ramesséum découvert en 1896 dans la tombe « du magicien » a permis d'attester l'existence d'un théâtre de l'Égypte antique.\n\nPremière cour\nOn accédait au Ramesséum par un pylône donnant sur la première cour. À l'arrière se dressaient deux statues colossales, flanquant le second pylône. La plus grande, nommée aujourd'hui « Ozymandias » et appelée par les Anciens Egyptiens « Soleil des princes », représentait Ramsès, la plus petite sa mère Mouttouya. Seuls des fragments du socle et du torse subsistent de la statue en du pharaon trônant. On estime son poids à 1 000 tonnes et sa hauteur à 16-19 mètres. Elle fut transportée sur 220 kilomètres depuis la carrière jusqu'au Ramesséum. C'est l'une des plus grandes statues colossales au monde. Cependant, des fragments de quatre colosses de granit encore plus imposants, dédiés à Ramsès, ont été découverts à Tanis (nord de l'Égypte). Leur hauteur est estimée à 21-28 mètres.\n\nDeuxième cour\nLes vestiges de la deuxième cour comprennent une partie de la façade intérieure du pylône et une portion du portique osirien sur la droite. Des scènes de guerre et la déroute des Hittites à Qadesh sont représentées à plusieurs reprises sur les murs. Dans les registres supérieurs figurent un festin en l'honneur du dieu phallique Min, dieu de la fertilité. De l'autre côté de la cour, les quelques piliers et colonnes osiriens encore présents donnent une idée de la grandeur originelle. On peut également apercevoir des vestiges épars des deux statues du roi assis qui flanquaient autrefois l'entrée du temple : l'une en granit rose, l'autre en granit noir. La tête de l'une d'elles a été transférée au British Museum.\n\nSalle hypostyle\nTrente-neuf des quarante-huit colonnes de la grande salle hypostyle, mesurant 41 × 31 mètres, sont encore debout dans les rangées centrales. Elles sont ornées des scènes habituelles représentant le roi devant diverses divinités. Une partie du plafond, décoré d'étoiles d'or sur fond bleu, a également été conservée. Les fils et les filles de Ramsès figurent en procession sur les quelques murs restants.\n\nSanctuaire\nLe sanctuaire était composé de trois pièces consécutives, avec huit colonnes et la cellule tétrastyle. Il ne reste aujourd'hui qu'une partie de la première pièce, dont le plafond est orné de scènes astrales, et quelques vestiges de la deuxième pièce.\n\nAutres bâtiments\nAu nord de la salle hypostyle se trouvait un temple plus petit, dédié à la mère de Ramsès, Mouttouya, et à son épouse principale bien-aimée, Néfertari. Au sud de la première cour se dressait le palais du temple. Le complexe était entouré de divers entrepôts, greniers, ateliers et autres bâtiments annexes, dont certains datent de l'époque romaine.\nUn temple dédié à Séthi Ier, dont il ne reste aujourd'hui que les fondations, se dressait autrefois à droite de la salle hypostyle. Il se composait d'une cour à péristyle et de deux chapelles. L'ensemble du complexe était ceint de murs en briques crues qui partaient du gigantesque pylône sud-est.\nUn dépôt de papyrus et d'ostraca datant de la Troisième Période intermédiaire indique que le temple abritait également une importante école de scribes.\nLe site était déjà occupé avant même que Ramsès n'en pose la première pierre : sous la salle hypostyle, des archéologues modernes ont mis au jour un tombeau à puits du Moyen Empire, renfermant un riche ensemble d'objets religieux et funéraires.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nLiens externes\nasramesseum.org/\n\n(en) The Ramasseum, recent archeological research\n\n Portail de l’Égypte antique   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de l’architecture et de l’urbanisme",

          "content": "Medinet Habu (Arabic: مدينة هابو, romanized: Madīnat Hābū; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜣmwt; Sahidic Coptic: (ⲧ)ϫⲏⲙⲉ, ϫⲏⲙⲏ, ϫⲉⲙⲉ, ϫⲉⲙⲏ, ϫⲏⲙⲓ; Bohairic Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) is an archaeological locality situated near the foot of the Theban Hills on the West Bank of the River Nile opposite the modern city of Luxor, Egypt. Although other structures are located within the area and important discoveries have also been made at these sites, the location is today associated almost synonymously with the largest and best preserved site, the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. It was an important New Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the \"sea peoples\" during the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1186–1155 BC), including the Battle of the Delta. Some of the building\nmaterials were re-used from earlier monuments including the destroyed mortuary temple of Tausret (c. 1191–1189 BC) the last known ruler and the final pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temple to Isis, Deir el-Shelwit, lies\n4 kilometers to the south and re-used inscribed blocks from Medinet Habu were found there.\nThe site of these temples included an inhabited human settlement since pharaonic times, which continued until the 9th century, by which time it was a Coptic center called Jeme. The last remnants of the former town were cleared during the excavations at the end of the 19th century.\nLocated adjacent to Medinet Habu, north of the outer wall, lies the poorly preserved memorial Temple of Ay (c. 1323–1319 BC) and Horemheb (c. 1300 BC). The temple was originally built by Ay and later usurped by Horemheb who removed all inscriptions and images of Ay. A large Quartzite statue of a Pharaoh that was usurped to represent Horemheb was excavated from the ruins of the Ay and Horemheb temple in the 1930s, and is now on display in the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC). Traces of previous cartouches on the statue confirm that the statue was originally of Tutankhamun, which was overwritten by cartouches of Ay and later Horemheb when the later pharaohs repurposed the statue for the temple.\nJust to the northwest of Medinet Habu the Oriental Institute of Chicago, now called ISAC, excavated a large late Roman period cemetery. Most of the graves had been plundered but a number of artifacts, including 66 mummy tags inscribed in Greek were recovered.\n\nEtymology\nThe origins of the name Medinet Habu are unknown. The earliest attestations are the ones of European cartographers of the 17th–18th centuries who mention it as \"Habu\", \"Medineh el Habou\" and \"Medinet Habu\", with variants \"Medinet Abu\" and \"Medinet Tabu\".\nThe proposed etymologies include derivation from Coptic name for Luxor (Coptic: (ⲡ)ⲁⲡⲉ, romanized: (p)Ape) or from a name of high official of the 18th dynasty who was later deified known as Amenhotep, son of Hapu, (Ancient Egyptian: Jmn-ḥtp.w zꜣ ḥpw), but neither of them is considered plausible, as they do not explain the final long -u. The folk etymology attributes the name to a mythical king named Habu.\nThe old Arabic name of the place, Gabal Shama, (Arabic: جبل شامة) comes from Djami (Coptic: ϫⲏⲙⲉ), which in turn is derived from Ancient Egyptian ḏꜣmwt, of unclear etymology. The Bohairic Coptic form Tchami (Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) comes from Demotic Tḏmꜣʾ, which is preceded by a feminine article, as also seen in Sahidic ⲧϫⲏⲙⲉ. Whether Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θηβαι) should be a phonetic rendering of the Egyptian name is disputed.\nIn Greek the area was known as Memnonia (Ancient Greek: Μεμνονία) or Kastron Memnonionos (Ancient Greek: Κάστρον Μεμνονίωνος, romanized: castle of Memnon) and was associated with Memnon. This name survives in Colossi of Memnon.\n\nArchaeology\nThe first European to describe the temple in modern literature was Vivant Denon, who visited it in 1799–1801. Jean-François Champollion spent a fortnight and a half at the site, as (Médinet-Habou), in 1829\nas part of the Franco-Tuscan Expedition. John Gardner Wilkinson during 12 years in Egypt recording inscriptions and paintings spent a long period at Thebes. A Prussian expedition led by Karl Richard Lepsius worked in Thebes, mainly at Medinet Habu, from November 1844 until April 1845.\nWork, under the direction of Georges Daressy, Marius Bonnefoy, and Charles Gabet, on the temple took place sporadically between 1859 and 1899, under the auspices of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to prepare it for tourism. During these decades the main temple was cleared, and a large number of the Greco-Roman period buildings, including a substantial Byzantine Church in the second court, were destroyed without notes or records being taken.\nTheodore M. Davis excavated at Medinet Habu in 1913 focusing primarily on the \"Palace\" of Rameses III along the southern side of the mortuary temple.\nThe further excavation, recording and conservation of the temple has been facilitated in chief part by the Architectural and Epigraphic Surveys of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute, almost continuously since 1924. The Architectural Survey, led by Uvo Hölscher, worked for five seasons until 1932. At the\nstart the complex was \"covered for the most part with mounds of rubbish ranging in height from 3 to 6 meters, the remains of houses from the former Coptic town of Habu\". At the start of work they reported that the \"Egyptian Antiquities Service was excavating Medinet Habu in spring 1925, clearing an area in the south of the precinct, west of the Palace\" activity which is otherwise not recorded. The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Epigraphic Survey under the direction of Harold Hayden Nelson also began in 1924 and the program continues to the present day, excepting a closure between 1940 and 1946 due to World War II. In 1948 Richard Anthony Parker became director of the Epigraphic Survey, followed by George Hughes, Charles Nims, Edward F. Wente, Kent Weeks, Lanny Bell, Peter Dorman, and W. Raymond Johnson in succeeding years. The survey has worked on the long process of photographing, recording, and publishing all reliefs and inscriptions at Medinet Habu.\n\nMortuary Temple of Ramesses III\nThe temple, some 150 m (490 ft) long, is of orthodox design, and closely resembles the nearby mortuary temple of Ramesses II (the Ramesseum). The full formal name of the temple was \"The Temple of Usermare-Meriamon (called) 'United-with-Eternity' in the estate of Amon on the West of Thebes\". Many of the inscriptions and scenes are in similar locations and in some cases largely copied. The temple precinct measures approximately 210 m (690 ft). by 300 m (1,000 ft) and contains more than 7,000 m2 (1.7 acres) of decorated wall reliefs. The temple contains 48 rooms of which 8 constitute the\nMortuary Suite of Rameses III. The reliefs in the Mortuary Suite were devoted to the funerary process\nof Rameses III as Osiride king. The remaining rooms contain reliefs showing the various acts of\nthe living pharaoh. Its walls are relatively well preserved and it is surrounded by a massive mudbrick inner enclosure wall. A radiocarbon sample from the wall\nyielded a date of 1050-1020 ± 50BC.\nThe area between the temple and inner wall originally held numerous temple outbuildings now mostly lost.\nThe entire south wall is inscribed with a liturgical calendar containing 1470\nlines of hieroglyphs. The Ramesseum of Ramesses II was used as a source for\nmuch of the text though that exemplar is now much damaged. The text is mainly\nlists of offerings to be prepared for daily, monthly, and annual feasts. Those\ndates are in the civil calendar (vs one of the two Egyptian religious calendars).\nAn excerpt from Ramesses Ill's Address to Amon-Re:\n\n\"Address of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands:  Usermaatre Meriamon; Son of Re, Lord of Thrones: Ramesses, Prince of On, to his father Amon-Re, King  of the Gods. \"Behold, I know eternity, 0  my august father, and I am not ignorant of everlastingness. \"My heart is glad for I know your strength is more than that  of the [other] gods, since it is you who has fashioned their images and created their majesties [and] you have made the sky  ....\"\n\nThe first pylon leads into an open courtyard, lined with colossal statues of Ramesses III as Osiris on one side, and uncarved columns on the other. The second pylon leads into a peristyle hall, again featuring columns in the shape of Ramesses. The third pylon is reached by continuing up a ramp that leads through a columned portico and then opens into a large hypostyle hall (which has lost its roof). Reliefs and actual heads of foreign captives were also found placed within the temple, perhaps in an attempt to symbolise the king's control over Syria and Nubia.\nIn the Greco-Roman and Byzantine period, there was a church inside the temple structure, which has since been removed. Some of the carvings in the main wall of the temple have been altered by Christian carvings.\n\nTen tombs from the 6th to 8th century BC were found in the inner sanctum of the mortuary temple. Three\ncould be identified including Nesterwy, daughter of 23rd dynasty pharaoh Rudamun,\ndescribed as a \"Songstress in the House of Amen\".\n\nBattle inscriptions\nThere are four long inscriptions describing the battles and deeds of Rameses III at the temple. The inscriptions cover:\n\nYear 5 - First Libyan War. On the temple exterior, second court, south wall, lower register. While dated \"Year 5\" it also mentions events of the Northern War of year 8.\n\nYear 8 - Temple interior, first court, west wall, north of great doorway. Northern War. Well preserved and of great interest to historians as well as the source of endless speculation and wishful thinking by others. The inscription details the invasion from the north, the battle preparations of Rameses III, and his complete defeat of the invaders. The section of most interest:\n\"... As for the foreign countries, they made a [conspiracy] in their isles. [Removed] and scattered in the fray were the lands at one time. No land could stand before their arms, from Hatti, Kode, Carchemish, Yereth, 17 and Yeres on,\" (but they were) cut off at [one time]. A camp [was set up] in one place in Amor. They desolated its people, and its land was like that which has never come into being. They were coming, while the flame was prepared before them, forward toward Egypt. Their confederation was the Peleset, Theker, Shekelesh, Denye(n), and Weshesh, lands united. They laid their hands upon the lands to the (very) circuit of the earth, their hearts confident and trusting: 'Our plans will succeed!' ...\"\nYear 11 - Second Libyan, or Meshwesh, War (poorly preserved). The inscription begins south of the main gateway of the temple and continues on the north of the gateway. The Meshwesh were a western Libyan tribe and were apparently prompted by the Rebu-Libyans to occupy the Egyptian Delta, conquering the Tehenu people who lived in the desert there. Rameses III reports crushing them and taking many captives including \"chief's son, their women, children, weapons, and domestic cattle\". The captives were made slaves.\nYear 12 - Deeds of Rameses III up to that point. On the temple exterior, face of first pylon, south of great gateway. Badly weathered to the point of making it difficult to properly interpret. Talks about the security of Egypt gained by his defeat of all foreign invaders (refers largely to the deeds of the Year 8 inscription) and his work on the Temple of Amon (Medinet Habu).\n\nMilitary reliefs\nThe western and northern walls of the mortuary temple contain a number of reliefs detailing the military activities of Rameses III including his conflicts with the Nubians and Libyans.\nThe combat scenes are accompanied by those showing preparations, for battle and distribution\nof weapons, divine intervention, returning victorious from battle, lion hunt, and the presenting of booty to the gods. These mostly follow the standard pharonic formula.\nOn the north wall are a series of 13 scenes which are viewed as a single military campaign beginning with the Libyans and ending with the \"sea peoples\". In one relief Rameses III and his troops rain arrows down on opponents in ships. In another he leads his troops in the destruction of feather helmeted opponents who are accompanied by\nwomen and children in oxcarts. Over a century ago Gaston Maspero proposed that these two panels represented the invasion of Egypt by purported \"sea peoples\" from Anatolia, a narrative which has now entered common public usage.\n\nTopographical lists\nTwo topographical lists, each toponym in an oval name-shield, are engraved on the front pylon of\nthe mortuary temple with some topynyms now damaged. The identity of many localities is\neither unknown or is disputed. A number were copied from the much damaged topographical\nlist of Rameses II at Karnak. There are 125 mostly Levantine entrees on the south tower of the pylon with the\ninitial 6 being African. The northern tower\nheld a list of mostly African localities, primarily in Nubia. Both lists are topped by a scene of Rameses III smiting kneeling enemies. Another topographical list was inscribed by Rameses IV on the walls of the rear terrace, in\nthe form of scenes showing the pharaoh making offering to the local deity of the\nlocality. They are much damaged by time and later construction though some\nremain legible.\n\nMedinet Habu king list\nThe memorial temple of Ramesses III (Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III) at Medinet Habu contains a minor list of pharaohs of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The inscriptions closely resemble the Ramesseum king list, which is a similar scene of Ramesses II, which was used as a template for the scenes here.\nThe scene shows Ramesses III participating in the ceremonies of the Festival of Min where statues of ancestral kings are carried in an elaborate procession to make offerings to Min. It contains 16 cartouches with the names of nine pharaohs divided into two parts.\nThe sparse outline of the scene was published by Vivant Denon in 1802, who was part of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798 to 1801, which published a slightly more detailed scene in 1809.\nThirty years later, the complete scene including the cartouches of the kings was published by John Gardner Wilkinson in 1837, followed by Champollion and Lepsius. All the 19th-century editions contain omissions and errors, but in 1940 the Epigraphic Survey published the definitive (and complete) rendering of the scenes.\n\nThe scene is divided in two parts, on the left side, 7 statues of ancestors are being carried in a procession. The right side is led by nine kings.\n\nIt remains in situ on the eastern second pylon in the second court, in the upper register on the eastern wall. It's also seen by some as an addition to the Abydos King List, as the Medinet Habu list contains some Rammasside pharaohs who reigned after the Abydos list was made.\n\nProcession of Princes\nOn both sides of the doorway on the west wall of the temple portico there are long processions of royal sons. This reflects an earlier similar relief of Rameses II at Luxor showing a procession of princes at the fest of Opet. The 1st three sons are dressed in flowing robes while the rest are more simply dressed. Originally the figures had no inscriptions, with only deeply cut cartouches of Rameses III between them. A shorter procession of royal daughters, unidentified, are on the south wall.\nAt a later date names and titles were inscribed for ten of the sons. When the new inscriptions were added and their implications are have been long debated. It is generally assumed they were added by either Ramesses IV, Ramesses V and/or Ramesses VI but this is uncertain. At a later date the fourth figure was further modified by Ramesses VIII after his own ascension for reasons that are uncertain. Different identities have been applied to some of the figures including Khaemwaset, Meryatum II, Montuherkhopshef, Meryamun, Pareherwenemef,  and Amun-her-khepeshef.\n\nOuter court of Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III\nThe Mortuary Temple grounds are enclosed by a 315 meter by 210 meter mudbrick temenos wall, rising 18 meters high and 10 meters in thickness. It encompassed 66000 square meters. The wall contain fortified gates in the eastern and western walls. The enclosed grounds hold a few minor archaeological sites. The outer court originally included a large garden with a 20 meter by 18 meter sacred pool, described in the\nPapyrus Harris I of Ramesses III.\n\n\"In front of it [= the temple] I dug a pool copious with water, planted with trees and verdant as the Delta. . . . It was surrounded by arbors, courtyards, and orchards laden with fruit and flowers for thy {= Amon’s] countenance. I built their pavilions . .. and I excavated a pool before them, adorned with lotus blossoms.\"\n\nPalace of Ramesses III\nThe area to the south of the mortuary temple, between the pylons, was occupied by the mudbrick palace\nof Ramesses III. It would have been used by the king only on religious festival\noccasions at which he presided over and to act as his \"Mansion of Millions of Years\" after his death. \nIt had two construction phases. The first phase was a near copy of the earlier Ramesseum palace of Ramesses II. It had two areas, a main throne room complex and\na hallway with a series of 6 small two room apartments. The throne complex was entered via a stairway\nleading into an antechamber with 16 columns (window of appearances). The antechamber led into \na 4 column audience hall with throne dais. The second construction phase used a much \nmore elaborate and larger plan and added a second story. It now filled the entire space\nbetween the inner enclosure walls and the small apartments were turned into\n3 large units, with bathrooms. The palace was much damaged by the 1913 excavation but the\nground plan of the 2nd temple has been restored for visitors to see.\n\nSmall Temple\nJust right of the entrance to the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is the Small Temple. Excavations\nfound early remains dating back to at least the early New Kingdom and possibly the Middle Kingdom (11th Dynasty). Originally it was dedicated the Ogdoad a group of eight Egyptian gods which were closely associated with Amun. The 18th Dynasty ruler Hatshepsut (c. 1479 – 1458 BC) reported that the temple was \"a sacred place, which the kings of Lower Egypt have [ne]glected\" and her co-ruler Thutmose III (c. 1479-1425 BC) left an inscription there that \"he found (it) ruined\". Hatshepsut began work restoring the temple but\ndied after completing part of the sanctuary. The work was completed by Thutmose III (who also excised all mentions of Hatshepsut in the temple). The sanctuary consists of six rooms, with one room containing large statues of Amun and Thutmose III. In later periods major additions to this were constructed.\nIn his construction at Medinet Habu, Rameses III was careful to respect the older temple.\nThe 11th Dynasty elevated Amun to a major god and the temple became largely associated with him. It has undergone many alterations and modifications over the years, partially in the 20th, 25th, 26th, 29th and 30th dynasties and the Greco-Roman period. A long inscription was added by Pinedjem I (c. 1070-1055 BC) High Priest of Amun at Thebes.\n\nSaite Chapels\nIn the northeast corner of the outer court four combined mausoleums and mortuary shrines were built\nbetween the 8th and 6th centuries BC to the God's Wife of Amun (Divine Votaresses) in the area of the former pool of Ramses III of which two are still extant. The chapels were of \nShepenwepet I, Amenardis I, Shepenwepet II, and Ankhnesneferibré. The\nchapel of Shepenwepet II was modified to also hold a later adortrice, Nitocris I, daughter of pharaoh Psamtik I (664–610 BC). The chapels were constructed mainly of Nubian siliceous sandstone from the quary at Gebel el-Silsila.\n\nTomb of Harsiese\nThe tomb of Harsiese (c. 880–860 BC), Third Intermediate Period ruler of Thebes, was found in 1932. The superstructure was lost in antiquity (though a re-used inscribed block was later found) but the substructure remained. The substructure had an \"inclined entrance passage with steps cut in the floor, an antechamber, and a burial chamber\". It was located \"just outside the enclosure wall of the small temple of Amun called 'Holiest of Places'\".\n\n\"... in the trough of a granite coffin (JE 60137) made for Ramesses II's sister, Henutmire, (and) closed with a hawk-Headed lid. When cleared, four canopic jars were found....No trace of any lids have survived, suggesting that such items may have been of [perishable] wood[.]\"\n\nHouse of Butehamon\nThe remains of the residence of Butehamon (c. 1070 BC) were found in the outer court near the Western Fortified Gate of the mortuary temple. He was the son of Dhutmose and a royal scribe and overseer of the royal treasury in the Theban Necropolis in the 20th dynasty and into 21st dynasty, when the residence would have been built based on papyrus texts. Of the two surviving main rooms, one was square with a stone dais and four stuccoed sandstone columns with palm-leaf capitals. The columns had \"inscriptions and scenes in which Amun-Re and the deified kings Amunhotep I and Ahmose-Nefretere are worshiped as the protecting deities of the  Necropolis\".\n Radiocarbon dating of a palm wood charcoal sample yielded the anomalous date of 1510 ± 40BC.\n\nCoptic settlement\nThe Coptic settlement at Medinet Habu was established as the final stage of a continuous process of occupation of the mortuary complex of Ramses III, which began in pharaonic times and continued into the Roman and late antique period. The settlement was a densely populated town with an estimated population of 18,860 residents, which was installed in various inner sectors, including the temple itself. The settlement pattern matched that of the Karnak and Luxor temples, with large blocks of houses separated by narrow streets and religious buildings as important focal points of the urban texture.\nSeveral churches were built in different sectors of the mortuary temple, including the great five-aisled basilica known as the \"Holy Church of Djeme\", which was located in the second court of Ramses III's temple. The church had a north–south orientation cutting across the original axis of the temple and was provided with a font and a well, placed at the southern end of the central nave. The church was dated between the 5th and the 7th century by Monneret de Villard, while Grossmann suggested an attribution to the middle or second half of the 6th century.\nBefore the clearing of the temple at the end of the 19th century, much of the Coptic town was still visible as it was left after its abandonment in the 9th century. The settlement's religious buildings, including the Holy Church of Djeme, were damaged over time, with one of the Ramesside columns on the east side removed to accommodate the apse and the Osiris pillars cut away since they were inappropriate in a Christian building. Sparse graffiti and damage are all that remain after the removal of the church in modern times.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMedia related to Medinet Habu at Wikimedia Commons\nColossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye\nKarnak King List\nMeryatum II\nMortuary Temple of Amenhotep III\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n[27] Delpeut, Lonneke, and Frederik Rogner, \"The king himself training his horses: two new perspectives on an unusual scene in Ramesses Ill’s temple at Medinet Habu\", Göttinger Miscellen 268, pp. 49–65, 2022\nDi Cerbo, Christina and Jasnow, Richard, \"Building Dipinti at Medinet Habu (With an Appendix on Remains of Color Decoration in the Palace)\", En détail – Philologie und Archäologie im Diskurs: Festschrift für Hans-W.

          "summary": "Medinet Habu (Arabic: مدينة هابو, romanized: Madīnat Hābū; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜣmwt; Sahidic Coptic: (ⲧ)ϫⲏⲙⲉ, ϫⲏⲙⲏ, ϫⲉⲙⲉ, ϫⲉⲙⲏ, ϫⲏⲙⲓ; Bohairic Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) is an archaeological locality situated near the foot of the Theban Hills on the West Bank of the River Nile opposite the modern city of Luxor, Egypt. Although other structures are located within the area and important discoveries have also been made at these sites, the location is today associated almost synonymously with the largest and best preserved site, the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. It was an important New Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the \"sea peoples\" during the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1186–1155 BC), including the Battle of the Delta. Some of the building\nmaterials were re-used from earlier monuments including the destroyed mortuary temple of Tausret (c. 1191–1189 BC) the last known ruler and the final pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temple to Isis, Deir el-Shelwit, lies\n4 kilometers to the south and re-used inscribed blocks from Medinet Habu were found there.\nThe site of these temples included an inhabited human settlement since pharaonic times, which continued until the 9th century, by which time it was a Coptic center called Jeme. The last remnants of the former town were cleared during the excavations at the end of the 19th century.\nLocated adjacent to Medinet Habu, north of the outer wall, lies the poorly preserved memorial Temple of Ay (c. 1323–1319 BC) and Horemheb (c. 1300 BC). The temple was originally built by Ay and later usurped by Horemheb who removed all inscriptions and images of Ay. A large Quartzite statue of a Pharaoh that was usurped to represent Horemheb was excavated from the ruins of the Ay and Horemheb temple in the 1930s, and is now on display in the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC). Traces of previous cartouches on the statue confirm that the statue was originally of Tutankhamun, which was overwritten by cartouches of Ay and later Horemheb when the later pharaohs repurposed the statue for the temple.\nJust to the northwest of Medinet Habu the Oriental Institute of Chicago, now called ISAC, excavated a large late Roman period cemetery. Most of the graves had been plundered but a number of artifacts, including 66 mummy tags inscribed in Greek were recovered.",

          "content": "The Colossi of Memnon (Arabic: el-Colossat or es-Salamat) are two large stone statues of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, which stand at the front of the ruined Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, the largest temple in the Theban Necropolis. They have stood since 1350 BC, and were well known to ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as early modern travelers and Egyptologists. The statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated to between AD 20 and 250; many of these inscriptions on the northernmost statue make reference to the Greek mythological king Memnon, whom the statue was then erroneously thought to represent.\nScholars have debated how the identification of the northern colossus as \"Memnon\" is connected to the Greek name for the entire Theban Necropolis as the Memnonium.\n\nDescription\nThe twin statues depict Amenhotep III (fl. 14th century BC) in a seated position, his hands resting on his knees and his gaze facing eastwards (actually ESE in modern bearings) towards the river. Three shorter figures are carved into the front throne alongside his legs: these are his wife Tiye and mother Mutemwiya. The middle between Amenhotep III's ankles would have been an unidentified daughter, although it has been destroyed. The side panels depict the Nile god Hapi.\n\nThe statues are made from blocks of quartzite sandstone which was quarried at el-Gabal el-Ahmar (near modern-day Cairo) and transported 675 km (420 mi) overland to Thebes (Luxor). The stones are believed to be too heavy to have been transported upstream on the Nile. The blocks used by later Roman engineers to reconstruct the northern colossus may have come from Edfu (north of Aswan). Including the stone platforms on which they stand – themselves about 4 m (13 ft) – the colossi reach 18 m (60 ft) in height and weigh an estimated 720 tons each. The two figures are about 15 m (50 ft) apart. The size of the statues makes them visible up to over 10 miles away. Regarding their size; they stood as the guardians of Amenhotep III's mortuary temple. Amenhotep III's process of immortalizing himself in statuary was prevalent, His approach to statuary representation and inscriptions had supported his ideology as being much more than the king of kings. His titles repeatedly called him the \"good god\". Suzanne Bickel describes the height of both colossi were accessible to the surrounding public as a method of allowing all to worship Amenhotep III himself and the gods at his temple.\nBoth statues are quite damaged, with the features above the waist virtually unrecognizable. The southern statue comprises a single piece of stone, but the northern figure has a large extensive crack in the lower half and above the waist consists of 5 tiers of stone. These upper levels consist of a different type of sandstone, and are the result of a later reconstruction attempt, which William de Wiveleslie Abney attributed to Septimius Severus. It is believed that originally the two statues were identical to each other, although inscriptions and minor art may have varied.\nThe original function of the Colossi was to stand guard at the entrance to Amenhotep's memorial temple (or mortuary temple): a massive construct built during the pharaoh's lifetime, where he was worshipped as a god-on-earth both before and after his departure from this world. In its day, this temple complex was the largest and most opulent in Ancient Egypt. Covering a total of 35 hectares (86 acres), even later rivals such as Ramesses II's Ramesseum or Ramesses III's Medinet Habu were unable to match it in area; even the Temple of Karnak, as it stood in Amenhotep's time, was smaller.\n\nFloods\nAmenhotep III had positioned the mortuary temple in front of the floodplain of the Nile in an effort to fill a lake in front of the Colossi. Furthermore, this lake acted as a water retention reservoir and prevented the temple from flooding completely during high inundations. Hourig Sourouzian felt that Amenhotep III did not plan for the site to flood altogether as the surrounding wall for the mortuary temple behind the Colossi was constructed primarily of mud brick.\nWith the exception of the Colossi, however, very little remains today of Amenhotep's temple. It stood on the edge of the Nile floodplain, and successive annual inundations gnawed away at its foundations – a 1840s lithograph by David Roberts shows the Colossi surrounded by water – and it was not unknown for later rulers to dismantle, purloin, and reuse portions of their predecessors' monuments.\n\nRoman era inscriptions\nThe statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated between 20-250CE; these inscriptions allowed modern travellers to connect the statues to the classical Greek and Latin literature. Many of the inscriptions include the name \"Memnon\". Several of the inscriptions refer to sounds emitted by the statues, the most famous being poetry by Julia Balbilla recording multiple visits during November 130 CE in a party that included the Emperor Hadrian and his wife Vibia Sabina. Of the 107 Roman-era inscriptions: 61 of them are written in Greek, 45 are written in Latin, and one bilingual text is written.\nThey were first studied in detail by Jean-Antoine Letronne in his 1831 La statue vocale de Memnon considérée dans ses rapports avec l'Égypte et la Grèce and then catalogued in the second volume (1848) of his Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de l'Égypte.\n\nEarthquakes\nSoon after its construction the temple was destroyed by an earthquake, recently dated by the Armenian Institute of Seismology to around 1200 BC, which left only the two huge colossi at the entrance still standing. These were further destroyed by an earthquake in 27 BC, after which they were partly reconstructed by the Roman authorities.\nThe 1200 BC earthquake also opened numerous chasms in the ground which meant that many statues were buried, some in pristine condition. These have been the subject of extensive restoration and excavation conducted by the Armenian/German archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, who has revealed that the complex consisted of three pylons, each fronted by colossal statues, while at the far end a rectangular Temple complex consisted of a peristyle court surrounded by columns. So far four of the statues have been re-erected, with eight waiting to be re-erected, while some 200 statues or pieces of statues are in the Luxor Museum, some on display, others in store awaiting conservation.\n\nName\nThe modern Arabic name is Kom el-Hatan, but it is generally known by the Roman name as the Temple of Memnon. Memnon was a hero of the Trojan War and King of Ethiopia, who led his armies from Africa into Asia Minor to help defend the beleaguered city of Troy but was ultimately slain by Achilles. Memnon (whose name means the Steadfast or Resolute) was said to be the son of Eos, the goddess of dawn. He was associated with colossi built several centuries earlier, because of the reported cry at dawn of the northern statue (see below), which became known as the Colossus of Memnon. Eventually, the entire Theban Necropolis became generally referred to as the Memnonium making him \"Ruler of the west\" as in the case of the god Osiris who was called chief of the west.\nIn the 19th century, William de Wiveleslie Abney noted that \"[t]he Arabs called these statues 'Shama' and 'Tama', and when speaking of them together gave them the appelation of Sanamât, or the idols.\"\n\nSounds\nIn 27 BCE, a large earthquake reportedly shattered the northern colossus, collapsing it from the waist up and cracking the lower half. Following its rupture, the remaining lower half of this statue was then reputed to \"sing\" on various occasions – always within an hour or two of sunrise, usually right at dawn. The sound was most often reported in February or March, but this is probably more a reflection of the tourist season rather than any actual pattern.\nThe earliest report in literature is that of the Greek historian and geographer Strabo, who said that he heard the sound during a visit in 20 BCE, by which time it apparently was already well-known. The description varied; Strabo said it sounded \"like a blow\", Pausanias compared it to \"the string of a lyre\" breaking, but it also was described as the striking of brass or whistling. Other ancient sources include Pliny (not from personal experience, but he collected other reports), Tacitus, Philostratus and Juvenal. In addition, the base of the statue is inscribed with about 90 surviving inscriptions of contemporary tourists reporting whether they had heard the sound or not.\nThe legend of the \"Vocal Memnon\", the luck that hearing it was reputed to bring, and the reputation of the statue's oracular powers became known outside of Egypt, and a constant stream of visitors, including several Roman emperors, came to marvel at the statues. The last recorded reliable mention of the sound dates from 196. Sometime later in the Roman era, the upper tiers of sandstone were added (the original remains of the top half have never been found); the date of this reconstruction is unknown, but local tradition places it circa 199, and attributes it to the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus in an attempt to curry favour with the oracle (it is known that he visited the statue, but did not hear the sound).\nVarious explanations have been offered for the phenomenon; these are of two types: natural or man-made. Strabo himself apparently was too far away to be able to determine its nature: he reported that he could not determine if it came from the pedestal, the shattered upper area, or \"the people standing around at the base\". If natural, the sound was probably caused by rising temperatures and the evaporation of dew inside the porous rock.\nSimilar sounds, although much rarer, have been heard from some of the other Egyptian monuments (Karnak is the usual location for more modern reports). Perhaps the most convincing argument against it being the result of human agents is that it did cease, probably due to the added weight of the reconstructed upper tiers.\nSince the northernmost statue is commonly associated with the renowned acoustic phenomenon, much of the literature and cultural discourse tends to overlook the southern counterpart. Despite its significance as a key structure commissioned by Amenhotep III, this oversight persisted. As a result, many Greco-Roman travelers, drawn by the mystique of the site, would etch their names upon the colossi during their visits, leaving behind inscriptions that reflect their fascination and desire for posterity.\n\nGallery\nModern images\nNotable historical images\nSee also\nColossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III\nList of largest monoliths\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nLord Curzon: \"The Voice of Memnon\" in Tales of Travel (1923)\nRupert T.

          "content": "The Temple of Edfu is an Egyptian temple located on the west bank of the Nile in Edfu, Upper Egypt. The city was known in the Hellenistic period in Koine Greek as Ἀπόλλωνος πόλις and in Latin as Apollonopolis Magna, after the chief god Horus, who was identified as Apollo under the interpretatio graeca. It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple was built in the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the Hellenistic period in Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts \"provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation.\" There are also \"important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and Seth.\" They are translated by the Edfu-Project.\n\nHistory\nEdfu was one of several temples built during the Ptolemaic Kingdom, including the Dendera Temple complex, Esna, the Temple of Kom Ombo, and Philae. Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time. The present temple, which was begun \"on 23 August 237 BC, initially consisted of a pillared hall, two transverse halls, and a barque sanctuary surrounded by chapels.\" The building was started during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes and completed in 57 BC under Ptolemy XII Auletes. It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east–west rather than north–south as in the present site. A ruined pylon lies just to the east of the current temple; inscriptional evidence has been found indicating a building program under the New Kingdom rulers Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II. \nA naos of Nectanebo II, a relic from an earlier building, is preserved in the inner sanctuary, which stands alone while the temple's barque sanctuary is surrounded by nine chapels.\nThe temple of Edfu fell into disuse as a religious monument following Theodosius I's persecution of pagans and edict banning non-Christian worship within the Roman Empire in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. The blackened ceiling of the hypostyle hall, visible today, is believed to be the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.\nOver the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39 ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile. Local inhabitants built homes directly over the former temple grounds. Only the upper reaches of the temple pylons were visible by 1798, when the temple was identified by a French expedition. In 1860 Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist, began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.\nThe Temple of Edfu is nearly intact and a good example of an ancient Egyptian temple. Its archaeological significance and high state of preservation have made it a center for tourism in Egypt and a frequent stop for the many riverboats that cruise the Nile. In 2005, access to the temple was revamped with the addition of a visitor center and paved carpark. A lighting system was added in late 2006 to allow night visits.\n\nReligious significance\nThe temple of Edfu is the largest temple dedicated to Horus and Hathor of Dendera. It was the center of several festivals sacred to Horus. Each year, \"Hathor travelled south from her temple at Denderah to visit Horus at Edfu, and this event marking their sacred marriage was the occasion of a great festival and pilgrimage.\"\n\nCreation myth of the temple\nThe creation myth of the temple of Edfu consists of several related scenes, which are found primarily on the inside of the perimeter walls of the temple.\nThey tell the story of the beginning of the world, when it was still entirely covered by water. During the struggle between land and primeval water, the land managed to come close to the surface. Where this happened, reeds grew with the help of a falcon, which were strengthened by the gods The Far and The Large. The reeds were the germ cell for the temple of Edfu, and here Horus landed, as a falcon. A force approached, in the form of a bird, and fed Horus, the lord of Edfu; This ritual was the beginning of the cult of Edfu.\nThe snakelike Apophis tried to impede the creation. Horus shuddered in fear, yet a harpoon, one of the forms of Ptah, came to the rescue. The enemy was defeated and the creation continued. A falcon formed the sky dome, its wings reaching from horizon to horizon, and the sun began its daily cycle. Then the first temple of Edfu was designed by the gods Thoth and Seshat, one responsible for wisdom, the other for scripture. The godly master-builder constructed the temple according to these plans, but initially not of stone, but of reed.\nThe foundation ritual of the temple consists of multiple elements: First, the ground-plan was laid out with the stretching-the-cord ritual. When the construction was completed, the king handed the temple over to a triad of gods. To protect the building against external threats, 60 gods formed a living wall around the temple.\n\nInfluence on British architecture\nThe Temple of Edfu provides the model for the Temple Works in Holbeck, Leeds. The courtyard columns at Edfu are closely copied in the frontage of the Works.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nAncient Egyptian architecture\nEdfu South Pyramid\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nOakes, Lorna and Lucia Gahlin.

The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the world with Hathor and Khonsu. Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris (\"Horus the Elder\"), along \"with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnut) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)\". The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.\n\nDecorations\nThe texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters invoked the gods of Kom Ombo and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple. A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Little remains of the New Kingdom temple. The existing temple was begun by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemies, most notably Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyles. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and \"probably represents a set of surgical instruments\".\n\nCurrent state\nMuch of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts, who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.\n\nCrocodile Museum\nA few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius during work to protect the site from groundwater.\nIn September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in) in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nfotopedia.com, Selected photos of the Temple of Kom Ombo",

          "content": "The Dendera Temple complex (Ancient Egyptian: Iunet or Tantere; the 19th-century English spelling in most sources, including Belzoni, was Tentyra; also spelled Denderah) is located about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) south-east of Dendera, Egypt. It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes of ancient Egypt. The area was used as the sixth nome of Upper Egypt, south of Abydos.\n\nDescription\nThe entirety of the complex is surrounded by a sizable mudbrick wall. Dendera, an oasis on the banks of the Nile, was inhabited by thousands at its peak. Due to its massive size, the structures throughout the complex were constructed over many eras, such as the Middle Kingdom, the Ptolemaic Era, and the period characterized by Roman provincial rule. There is evidence that there was an even earlier building on this site, circa 2250 B.C.E., which could have begun during the reign of Pepi I and completed during the reign of his son, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Evidence also exists of a temple in the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1500 BC). The earliest extant (surviving) building in the compound today is the mammisi raised by Nectanebo II – last of the native pharaohs (360–343 BC).\nThe features in the complex include:\n\nHathor temple (the main temple)\nTemple of the birth of Isis\nSacred Lake (source of water for sacred rituals and for everyday use)\nSanatorium\nThis would have functioned similarly to a Roman bathhouse, but strictly for bathing and an overnight stay to manifest healing dreams. The waters at Dendera were sacred and were often used to bless the inscriptions on statues so that they could cure diseases.\nMammisi of Nectanebo II\nBasilica\nRoman Mammisi\na Barque shrine\n(Def.: Boat; French, “barque”/ Late Latin “barca”)\nUsed as a resting place for the statues of the gods when outside of the temple during festivals\nGateways of Domitian and Trajan\nthe Roman Kiosk\nThe Dendera Temple is not to be confused with the Dendera Necropolis, which consists of a series of tombs. The Dendera Necropolis dates back to the Early Dynastic Period and up to the First Intermediate Period, which pre-dates the Middle Kingdom construction of the Temple of Hathor. The necropolis runs across the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain.\n\nHathor temple\nThe temple that dominates this complex, the structure that commands the attention of those who visit, is the Temple of Hathor. The original temple structure underwent continuous modifications throughout the Middle Kingdom and up until the beginning of the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan. The existing temple's structure began construction in 54 B.C.E, the late Ptolemaic period, under the reign of Ptolemy Auletes. The hypostyle hall was built in the Roman period under Tiberius.\nIn Egypt, Trajan was quite active in constructing buildings and decorating them. He appears, together with Domitian, in offering scenes on the propylaeum of the Temple of Hathor. His cartouche also appears in the column shafts of the Temple of Khnum at Esna.\nLayout elements of the temple are:\n\nLarge Hypostyle Hall\nSmall Hypostyle Hall\nLaboratory\nStorage magazine\nOffering entry\nTreasury\nExit to well\nAccess to stairwell\nOffering hall\nHall of the Ennead\nGreat Seat and main sanctuary\nShrine of the Nome of Dendera\nShrine of Isis\nShrine of Sokar\nShrine of Harsomtus\nShrine of Hathor's Sistrum\nShrine of gods of Lower Egypt\nShrine of Hathor\nShrine of the throne of Rê\nShrine of Rê\nShrine of Menat collar\nShrine of Ihy\nThe Pure Place\nCourt of the First Feast\nPassage\nStaircase to roof\nDepictions of Cleopatra VI, which appear on temple walls, are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art. On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popular, well-known Cleopatra) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar (Caesarion), who was fathered by Julius Caesar.\nThere are ten dead deities represented at Dendera, specifically on/in Hathor's temple, that can be connected to the nine dead deities at Horus's temple in Edfu. This would be due to the either parental or marital relationship between Hathor and Horus.\n\nDendera zodiac\nThe sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of the zodiac system still recognized today (i.e. Taurus [bull] and Libra [scales]). A sketch was made during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by Frenchmen and later replaced with a copy. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. (It is also said that in 1822, an antiquities thief using the name \"Claude Le Lorraine,” who should not to be confused with the French Baroque painter, removed the zodiac from Dendera, brought it back to France, and sold it to the King.) The real bas relief is now in the Louvre. Jean-François Champollion, the man who deciphered the Rosetta Stone, dated it back to the Ptolemaic period, and it has been proved that he was correct, as Egyptologists now date it back to the first century BC.\n\nCrypts\nThe Hathor temple's subterranean tombs contain twelve chambers. Some reliefs seen in the tombs are dated to as late as the reign of Ptolemy XII Auletes. The crypts reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the Flame Room floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I offering a statuette of the God Ihy to four images of Hathor. (Hathor is understood to be Ihy's mother.) In the crypt accessible from the Throne Room, Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods.\n\nThe Dendera light\nThe Hathor Temple has stone reliefs that depict Harsomtus, in the form of a snake, emerging from a lotus flower. Harsomtus, also known as Horus, is depicted as one of the ancient gods, a \"primeval creator.\" Harsomtus is likely depicted at the Dendera Temple Complex due to the main temple being dedicated to Hathor. In Egyptian mythology, Harsomtus is referenced as either Hathor's son or lover. In six reliefs he is positioned within an oval container called a hn, which might represent the womb of Nut. These resemble a lamp or light.\n\nProcessional staircase\nThere is a processional stairway leading to the roof of the temple. Reliefs decorating the walls depict scenes from rituals that would have been performed at the temple. The staircase shows wear from millennia of use, but it also shows an apparent accretion of material, which has lent the staircase the informal name of \"the melted stairs.\"\n\nRestoration work\nThe Supreme Council of Antiquities began the project of restoration and maintenance of the temple in 2005. Efforts stopped in 2011 and then resumed in 2017, after the completion of necessary scientific and archaeological studies, along with careful experimental studies using modern techniques. As of March 2021, the second phase of the restoration has been completed, which includes cleaning the Great Pillars Hall and restoring the original colors and clarity of painted scenes on walls and ceilings. More activity continues at the temple, including a cooperative effort started in 2019 with the French Archaeological delegation to turn the temple courtyard into an open museum.\n\nRoman mammisi\nThe Roman mammisi is a subsidiary building dating to the reigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Numerous reliefs of Trajan making offerings to Egyptian deities can be seen. The presence of the Roman mammisi at the Dendera Temple Complex is indicative of the long and complicated history of the Romans in Egypt. As seen in the images below, Roman Emperor Trajan is depicted in the reliefs as an Egyptian Pharaoh and he is making offerings to the Egyptian gods.\n\nRecent discoveries\nIn March 2023, during the recent excavations at the site archaeologists uncovered a limestone sphinx. This sphinx is depicted with a slight grin and dimples and is thought to have been created in the image of the Roman emperor Claudius. On the sphinx's head sits a nemes that has a cobra-shaped tip called a uraeus.\n\nTourism\nThe Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It is  possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof (at least in February 2025).\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEsna temple (in Esna)\nList of Ancient Egyptian sites\nTomb of Meni\nTomb of Nyibunesu\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nDendera Temple complex. satellite-sightseer.com.\nDendera (French)\nHigh-resolution Images of Dendera Temple Ceiling\n\nBibliography\nArnold, Dieter; Heywood, Ann; Chen, Sara (August 12, 2018). \"Petrified Sound and Digital Color: A Hathor Colum in the New Ptolemaic Galleries.\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

          "content": "## Overview\nAbydos is an important Ancient Egyptian archaeological site in Middle Egypt, a collection of temples, sites and ancient cemeteries close to the town of al-Balyana, 90 km (56 miles) north of Luxor.\n\n## Understand\nThe sacred city of Abydos (Abdju) is occupied since the Predynastic period; their rulers' town, temple and tombs, in the royal necropolis of Umm el-Qa'ab, have been found here.\nA funerary chapel of Pepi I of the 6th Dynasty evolved over the years into the Great Temple of Osiris, and Abydos became the centre of the worship of the Isis and Osiris cult. The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the 30th Dynasty, and the cemetery was in continuous use. The Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings, to the north of the Seti temple. Many of the original structures, and the artifacts within them, are considered irretrievable and lost, most likely destroyed by the new construction.\n\n## By train\nMost travellers arrive at Abydos by train north from Luxor, alighting at the station for the town of al-Balyana. The fare is approximately LE 52, first class. From the station, either the tourist police or a police-escorted taxi will take you to the site of the Ramesside temples. Depending on local conditions and police levels of business, you should be able to get at least a couple of hours visiting the site.\nAt al-Balyana, there should be some police at the station. If not, ignore any touts, exit the station to the south and you will almost immediately come to the east-west road that heads out to Abydos. Start heading west along this road and you will soon come to the police checkpoint, they used to be where the road forms a bridge over the canal, and had a small blue wooden sentry box and some barriers. They will either take you to the main temple of Seti I, or arrange a taxi for you. It's usually a private taxi, but sometimes a share. As always, have small denomination notes to the pay the fare as drivers always have \"no change\". It's not necessary to spend money getting a private taxi to wait. When you leave the temple the police on site will find a vehicle for you to get back down to town, just so you aren't their problem anymore.\nBack at the station the police will usually (not always) wait with you and see you on the train. Note that if a 3rd class train comes first (as it often does late afternoon), they will often put you on that one. It's not the most clean or comfortable experience (no air con, no guaranteed seats, sometimes not even any lighting), but the travel time isn't much different to the nicer trains. All in all, the journey is more hassle than an organised tour, but the freedom you get to spend several hours on site and explore on your own, in peace and in your own time, makes it well worthwhile.\n\n## By road\nYou can go by taxi in the police-escorted convoy to Abydos in one day, usually including Dendera as a stop-off point. A trip in a private car arranged through your hotels could cost around US$90 for two or three passengers (Oct 2018). You can likely get a better price by talking to taxi drivers directly. Make sure you agree on how much time you will spend at each temple - 90 min each is a minimum, though if you want to spend longer (especially at Abydos), then taking the train and just doing Abydos will give you much more time on site, and will work out much cheaper, though dealing with the local police is a hassle.\nAlso available are minibus tours from agents in Luxor, usually with a local guide of variable quality. These also travel with the escorted convoy, and can be a reasonable deal for a small group if you haggle, especially in off-season. Expect to pay around LE 300 - 400 per person, dependent on size of your group, time of year and your haggling skills. The major UK, US and European holiday companies also offer escorted tours, but these can be expensive.\n\n## See\n26.18563831.9158861 The Temple of Seti I. The father of Ramses the Great ruled from 1294–1279 BC. His temple features magnificent reliefs, among them a long carved list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties, the sole source to dates and names of many of the kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties, thus valued greatly for that reason: the Abydos Kings List. The raised reliefs in the temple are some of the finest quality in all Egypt, incredibly beautiful and detailed. Although the lighting in the interior of the temple can be somewhat gloomy in places, the reliefs still stand out as exceptional. The reliefs on the outer portions of the temple were completed during the reign of Ramses II, and are of a much lower quality than those further inside the complex. (Ramses moved the best craftsmen to work on his own temples after his father's death). The Kings List, or Pharaohs List is somewhat selective, omitting for example Akhenaten (the heretic king), Hatshepsut (a female pharaoh), and the reigns of the kings during the Hyskos occupation. If you are interested in ancient Egyptian history and art, this temple is as much a must-see as Abu Simbel or the Karnak temple.    (updated Oct 2018)\n26.18413931.91852 Osireion (Osiris' tomb).

It is one of several locations claimed to be the biblical Mount Sinai, the place where, according to the sacred scriptures of the three major Abrahamic religions (Torah, Bible, and Quran), the Hebrew prophet Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.\nIt is a 2,285-meter (7,497 ft) mountain near the city of Saint Catherine in the region known today as the Sinai Peninsula. It is surrounded on all sides by higher peaks in the mountain range of which it is a part. For example, it lies next to Mount Catherine which, at 2,629 m or 8,625 ft, is the highest peak in Egypt.\n\nGeology\nMount Sinai's rocks were formed during the late stage of the evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Mount Sinai displays a ring complex that consists of alkaline granites intruded into diverse rock types, including volcanics. The granites range in composition from syenogranite to alkali feldspar granite. The volcanic rocks are alkaline to peralkaline, and they are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and subvolcanic porphyry.\n\nReligious significance\nJudaism and Christianity\nImmediately north of the mountain is the 6th-century Saint Catherine's Monastery. The summit has a mosque that is still used by Muslims, and a Greek Orthodox chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th-century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical Tablets of Stone. At the summit also is \"Moses' cave\", where the Hebrew prophet Moses is believed to have waited to receive the Ten Commandments from God.\n\nIslam\nThe Jabal Musa is associated with the Islamic prophet Mūsā ibn ʿImrān (i.e., Moses). In particular, numerous references to Jabal Musa exist in the Quran, where it is called Ṭūr Saināʾ, Ṭūr Sīnīn, and aṭ-Ṭūr and al-Jabal (both meaning \"the Mount\"). As for the adjacent Wād Ṭuwā (Valley of Tuwa), it is considered as being muqaddas (sacred), and a part of it is called Al-Buqʿah Al-Mubārakah (\"The blessed Place\").\n\nAscent and summit\nThere are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route, Siket El Bashait, takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though camels can be used. The steeper, more direct route (Siket Sayidna Musa) is up the 3,750 \"steps of penitence\" in the ravine behind the monastery.\n\nSee also\nHashem El Tarif\nSacred mountains\nJebel Musa, Morocco, a similarly named mountain in Morocco\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Mount Sinai travel guide from Wikivoyage\nCaucasian Albanian Alphabet Discovered and Deciphered, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 11:3 (Autumn 2003).

          "content": "## Overview\nMount Sinai (Arabic جبل موسَى Gebel Musa) is in the middle of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt and rises 2,285 metres above sea level. The mountain is a sacred site for Jews, Christians and Muslims.\n\n## Understand\nMount Sinai is said to be the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God; indeed, the Arabic name Gebel Musa means \"Mount of Moses\". While there is very little archaeological evidence to support this assertion, the mountain is still a popular pilgrimage site and home to the world heritage listed Monastery of St. Catherine, a Greek Orthodox monastery founded in the 6th century, one of the longest-running monasteries in the world and itself at the supposed location of the Burning Bush.  The small town of al-Minya, outside the entrance to the valley, has sprung up to cater to tourists.\nThe mountain is also a holy site for Muslims, who consider this to be the place from where the prophet Muhammed started his journey to heaven on the winged horse Buraq.\n\n## Climate\nDaytime temperatures vary from mild to warm around the year. However, nighttime temperatures are considerably lower. Precipitation is negligible through most of the year.\nSt. Catherine is one of the oldest monasteries in the world, founded sometime in the early 4th century. According to the 9th century chronicles of patriarch Eutychios of Alexandria, the monastery was founded in 324 by emperor Helena who visited monks living in the mountains. The monastery was also mentioned in the diaries of a nun, Etheria of Galicia, who visited towards the end of the 4th century.\nThe monastery got its current form between 548 and 564 when the East Roman emperor Justinian I according to the wishes of the monks built the fortification and stationed a force to protect the monastery. Some of the monks still opted to continue living outside the walls. During this period the main church of the site was constructed. A century later, the remains of Catherine of Alexandria was found at the nearby mountain nowadays known as Mount Catherine. She was the daughter of a Cypriot king who refused to abandon her faith and to marry the pagan Roman emperor Maxentius and was therefore tortured and beheaded in 305. The remains were brought to the monastery, which was also renamed after her.\nAlso the future prophet Muhammed visited the monastery several times, and later on he guaranteed the protection of the monastery. Only in the 11th century the caliph Al-Hakim threatened to destroy the monastery, and between the 15th and 18th centuries the monks were indeed expelled numerous times but the monastery itself was never destroyed.\n1575 the monastery was declared independent from Rome, at that time St. Catherine was the site of an archdiocese. Later on, under the guardianship of the Russian czar, a Greek-Orthodox monastery was established. Nowadays the monastery is juridically a part of the patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\n## Get in\nThe closest airport with passenger traffic is in Sharm el-Sheikh, and your only choice of transport is by road. Dahab is 2 hours and 133 km away, Nuweiba is 120 km and a similar 2 hours away, while the trip from Sharm el-Sheikh (230 km) is closer to 3 hours. Most visitors arrive on tours that arrive at approximately 1AM at the foot of the mountain in order to climb Mount Sinai overnight and watch the sunrise. Any guesthouse in Sinai can arrange for you to join a tour. There are also several camps, guesthouses and hotels in St. Catherine that can accommodate tourists and travellers alike.\n\n## By bus\nTo arrive from Nuweiba, they were a minibus, but it is not working any more (June 2025). So you have first to go to Dahab with Go Bus or East Delta.\nFrom Dahab, there is a minibus daily mainly used by tourists for a night trip to mount Sinai. Usually it is booked by tour operators, but you can simply call the driver, it will be cheaper (Alaa, ☏ +20 100622652. He speaks really good English). The minibus leaves Dahab daily around 10PM and comes back in the morning around 8AM - 10AM (check with Alaa). The price is around US$5 one way (June 2025).\nFrom Cairo, the East Delta Bus Company leaves the new Cairo Gateway station daily at 11AM and takes about 7 hours (to be checked as of June 2025 it may not exist any more. But you can still go via Suez (see below) or via Dahab (probably faster)). The cost is LE75 (Apr 2016), and the schedule for this bus is also available at the Bedouin Bus home page.\nFrom Suez. There is a minibus daily leaving the bus station which is about 8km from the city centre, but time schedule has to be checked. It returns from Ste Catherine to Suez, leaving Ste Catherine around 5:30AM, starting in front of the restaurant Cleopatra (and has to be booked, ask a local). The price is about US$4 and the journey is about 5 to 6 hours, depending on how long you stay at the checkpoints (June 2025). If you go from Ste Catherine to Suez and want to continue to Cairo, you can then take another minibus directly from the same bus station or a train. There is a train leaving at 3PM (but long ride). If you choose the train, ask the driver to leave you at the train station, otherwise the bus will go directly to the bus station (about 4km from the train station).\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi from Dahab or Nuweiba can cost around LE200 (Dec 2011).\n\n## Get around\nYou have two choices for getting around and climbing the mountain: on foot, or by camel.  See Do for the full scoop.\n\n## See\nThe Monastery of St. Catherine (دير سانت كاترين, Dair Sānt Kāt(a)rīn), at the foot of the mountain, is the easier of the two destinations here. Looking more like a fortress than a church, access is through a massive iron gate shut for the night and opened in the morning from 9AM to noon only (daily except Friday and Sunday). Note that the monastery observes the Greek Orthodox rites and is thus also closed for Christmas and Easter as calculated by the Greek Orthodox calendar. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2002.\nIn Feb 2011, only a few parts of the monastery were accessible to tourists.\nThere is also a small museum mainly about Byzantine icons and tempera on wood. You must make a LE25 donation as entrance fee but it is worth it.\nA guide for the monastery could start at LE100 but you should bargain.\nNowadays about two dozen, mostly Greek, monks live at the monastery. They elect the abbot and archbishop, who mostly lives in Cairo. At the time he isn't present, four caretakers are performing his functions.\nThe main service takes place from 4:30 to 7:30AM, while the vesper takes place from 2:30 to 4PM. In order to keep up the normal functions of the monastery, visitors are only allowed in between 9AM and noon. On Friday, Sunday and Greek Orthodox holidays it is entirely closed. Yearly some 100,000 people visit the monastery, which means that it can get quite crowded during the opening hours. Entrance is free, but the museum charges you LE20. To enter the protected area, to which also the monastery belongs there's a fee of LE17 for adults and LE10 for students.\nThe monastery complex is 1570 m above sea level at the foot of Mount Sinai in the Monastery Valley — Wadi ed-Deir. It is surrounded by a walls that are 12–15 m tall and 2 m thick. The old entrance is located at the western side and was only built in the early 19th century when Napoleon invaded Egypt; before this people entered and exited the site by the elevators used for goods. This entrance was actually named after the French general Jean-Baptiste Kleber.\nHowever today's visitors will use the newer gate, at the northern side of the complex. When entering, you will see the monks' housing building at the right-hand site. Straight ahead stands the main church — the 28.5560233.976191 St. Catherine church.\nBuilt in the mid-6th century, this basilica features inscriptions about emperor Justinian, empress Theodora I, as well as the church's architect Stephanos of Aila. The doors are made of cedar and are decorated with various ornaments. The three main sections of the church are demarcated by twelve granite pillars and have three chapels each, named after saints. The sacristy and the treasure room make up the rest of the church. The tower of the church is comparatively new, constructed only in 1871.\nIconostases and mosaics from several epochs can be seen in the church. The most famous of them is the Mosaic of the Transfiguration. Overall St.Catherine possesses a collection of some 2000 icons. At the right-hand side of the altar there's the marble shrine containing the relics of St. Catherine. The holiest place is the 28.5560133.976342 Chapel of the Burning Bush, located behind the choir. It was constructed in the 13th century at the place where, according to the Book of Exodus, Moses was instructed by God to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.\nIn the northwest of the complex you'll find the 28.5561833.976083 Well of Moses; the spring that supplies water to the monastery and, according to legend, the location where Moses met his wife for the first time. Next to it, the Monastery museum, showing icons, writings, equipment used for services as well as gifts given by pilgrims.\nAt the west side there's the 28.5560533.975874 Omar Mosque from the 12th century, with a minaret north of the mosque itself.\nOther parts of St. Catherine is normally not accessible to visitors. Accommodation inside the monastery is found at the west and south. The south-eastern part hosts the library; the world's oldest Christian library and with 3500 religious manuscripts and 50,000 books the second largest after the one in the Vatican. 4500 of the works are regarded as rare, but perhaps the largest treasure is the Codex Sinaiticus, the world's oldest almost perfectly preserved Bible, discovered in 1844 by the German theologian Konstantin von Tischendorff. No access without special permission (granted only to VIPs and bona fide scholars).\nOutside the walls, on the western side, there's a garden, cemetery and 28.5559233.975255 ossuary. The latter is a morbid charnel house containing the skulls of 1400 years' worth of monks who have lived and died here.\n\n## Climbing Mount Sinai\nClimbing 28.538533.97511 Mount Sinai is the main objective for most visitors. Mount Sinai is the second highest mountain in Egypt – only neighbouring Mount Catherine is higher. Therefore you will have an undisturbed view in all directions. Many tourists climb the mountain during the night, see the sunrise at the summit and visit the monastery during the day. Therefore, if you want to avoid crowds, climb the mountain in the night before a Friday or Sunday when the monastery is closed to visitors. If you want to see the sunrise, you should start sometime between midnight and 3AM, depending on your level of fitness. Those of average fitness should be able to get to the summit in no more than three hours. Alternatively, the sunset is also an impressive sight; for this you should start your climb in the early afternoon.\nA local guide is required despite the fact the trails are well signposted once you get onto them. Starting price at the entrance LE110 (Apr 2016) but bargain it. In daytime, which is less popular, the fee is lower. If you go from Dahab, you can book the minibus (go and back) + guide, at the tour operator called Bedouina Tours for US$30. For a better price, you can also directly ask Alaa (the driver of the minibus, ☏ +20 100622652) to arrange the tour for you (about US$15 for the same trip by minibus + guide, June 2025).\nIt will be much cooler at the summit than on the coast, and in the winter subzero temperatures at night and even snow are not unknown. Dress warmly in layers, a torch is also a must. Blankets and mattresses can be rented at the top for ~LE10 per piece, however, their state of cleanliness may be objectionable.\nThere are two routes to choose from, entrances to which are rather poorly signposted, so choose carefully especially if climbing at night.  Both paths lead to natural amphitheatre known as Elijah's Hollow or the Seventy Elders of Israel, where you'll find a teahouse for a break.  From there, it's a final 750 steps (30 minutes) to reach the summit.\nSteps of Penitence.  This aptly named steep path has been quite literally carved out of the rock by monks, and with 3750 steps to climb is the shorter but more challenging of the two.  No mountain-climbing equipment required though, just strong thighs, and the views back down into the valley are superb even in the middle of the night.  If the sky is clear the stars above can also be a spellbinding sight, as there are no major cities for miles and miles around.  The route can be climbed in as little as 45 minutes, or as long as three hours, depending on your pace.\nCamel Path (Siket El Bashait).  A gentler, winding, wide path that snakes its way up to the summit that can be completed by the average traveller in 2½ hours. As you can guess from the name, you can also climb up this way on the back of camel, and the \"sawdust\" that appears to coat much of the length of the path is in fact dried camel byproducts from the many trips before you. Be warned that the camel will bite you if it doesn't like you, so be nice, and a 3-hour ride up a mountain – going on foot is actually faster for most people – may not be the easiest introduction to the notoriously swaying gait of these camels.  You'll also have to dismount about a kilometre before you reach the top and cover the last 700 steps on foot. Take care at the top also, as the surface is uneven.\nAt the top you will find a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of an older 16th-century church.  Better yet, if you timed your ascent right, you can see the sunrise over the parched, rocky expanse of the Sinai.\nThe intense silence of the mountain as well as its spiritual history makes it a popular spot for yoga and meditation groups. The local 'Gebeliya' Bedouin also run silent retreats for visitors, as well as trekking trips.\n\n## Climbing Mount Catherine\n28.509533.95532 Mount Catherine (جبل كاترين Ǧabal Kāt(a)rīn) is a few kilometres south-west of Mount Sinai and is with 2637m the highest mountain in the Sinai and in all of Egypt. The relics of Saint Catherine were found at this mountain, and due to this discovery the monastery and the mountain were renamed.\nThe trek starts at the monastery, crosses the plain of el-Milga past Aaron's chapel, the monastery of the holy apostle and the pavilion of king Fuad. After an hour of walking you'll reach the 28.5358333.964443 monastery of the 40 martyrs (دير الاربعين Dair al-Arbaʿīn). From here, there is a four-hour climb to the summit, where you'll find the chapel of St. Catherine. Inside the chapel, a rug marks the place where the relics were found.\nNote that you must go with a guide. As of June 2025, there is only one guide doing it for about US$50.\n\n## Buy\nFansina. Selema Galaby, a local Bedouin woman, has set up an exquisite craft shop in the village of St Catherine. Fansina employs more than 350 local tribeswomen to make traditional hand-woven handicrafts.

There is a café in the garden of the guesthouse, which is open to the public.\nIn the village el-Milga there are several restaurants and a bakery.\n\n## Sleep\nSt. Catherine has quite a few camps, guesthouses and hotels.

          "content": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.\n\nName\nThe city of Cairo was established by the Fatimid general Jawhar al-Siqilli, on behalf of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz, following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. It was originally named al-Manṣūriyya (المنصورية) after the prior seat of the Fatimid caliphate, al-Mansuriyya in modern Tunisia. The mosque, first used in 972, may have initially been named Jāmiʿ al-Manṣūriyya (جامع المنصورية, \"the mosque of Mansuriyya\"), as was common practice at the time. It was al-Mu'izz who renamed the city al-Qāhira (القاهرة, \"the Victorious\"). The name of the mosque thus became Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira (جامع القاهرة, \"the mosque of Cairo\"), the first transcribed in Arabic sources.\nThe mosque acquired its current name, al-ʾAzhar, sometime between the caliphate of al-Mu'izz and the end of the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt, al-Aziz Billah (r. 975–996). ʾAzhar is the masculine form for zahrāʾ, meaning \"splendid\" or \"most resplendent\". Zahrāʾ is an epithet applied to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, wife of caliph Ali. She was claimed as the ancestress of al-Mu'izz and the imams of the Fatimid dynasty; one theory is that her epithet is the source for the name al-ʾAzhar. The theory, however, is not confirmed in any Arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later Western sources.\nAn alternative theory is that the mosque's name is derived from the names given by the Fatimid caliphs to their palaces. Those near the mosque were collectively named al-Quṣūr al-Zāhira (القصور الزاهرة, \"the Brilliant Palaces\") by al-Aziz Billah, and the royal gardens were named after another derivative of the word zahra. The palaces had been completed and named prior to the mosque changing its name from Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira to al-ʾAzhar.\nThe word Jāmiʿ is derived from the Arabic root word jamaʿa (g-m-ʿ), meaning \"to gather\". The word is used for large congregational mosques. While in classical Arabic the name for al-Azhar remains Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, the pronunciation of the word Jāmiʿ changes to Gāmaʿ in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nHistory\nFatimid Caliphate\nAfter the conquest of Egypt, Jawhar al-Siqilli oversaw the construction of the royal enclosure for the caliph's court and the Fatimid army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Isma'ili Shi'a Islam. Located near the densely populated Sunni city of Fustat, Cairo became the center of the Isma'ili sect of Shi'a Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.\nJawhar ordered the construction of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4, 970. The mosque was built out of limestone from the Mokattam Formation. The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday prayers were held there on June 22, 972 during Ramadan.\nAl-Azhar soon became a center of learning in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Isma'ili madh'hab (school of law) were made available to the general public. Al-Nu'man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu'izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Isma'ili doctrine. Classes were taught at the palace of the caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid al-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu'izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.\nYaqub ibn Killis, a polymath, jurist and the first official vizier of the Fatimids, made al-Azhar a key center for instruction in Islamic law in 988. The following year, 45 scholars were hired to give lessons, laying the foundation for what would become the leading university in the Muslim world.\nThe mosque was expanded during the rule of the caliph al-Aziz Billah. According to al-Mufaddal, he ordered the restoration of portions of the mosque and had the ceiling raised by one cubit. The next Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r. 996–1021), would continue to renovate the mosque, providing a new wooden door in 1010. However, al-Hakim's reign saw the completion of the al-Hakim Mosque, and al-Azhar lost its status as Cairo's primary congregational mosque. In May 1009 the al-Hakim Mosque became the sole location for the caliph's sermons; prior to this, al-Hakim would rotate where the Friday sermon was held. Following al-Hakim's reign, al-Azhar was restored by Caliph al-Mustansir Billah (r. 1036–1094). Additions and renovations were carried during the reign of the remaining Fatimid caliphs. Caliph al-Hafiz undertook a major refurbishment in 1138, which established the keel-shaped arches and carved stucco decoration seen in the courtyard today, as well as the dome at the central entrance of the prayer hall.\nInitially lacking a library, al-Azhar was endowed by the Fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed the basis of its collection. Fatimid efforts to establish Isma'ili practice among the population were, however largely unsuccessful. Much of its manuscript collection was dispersed in the chaos that ensued with the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate, and Al-Azhar became a Sunni institution shortly thereafter.\n\nAyyubid dynasty\nSaladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was hostile to the Shi’ite principles of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.\nIn addition to stripping al-Azhar of its status as congregational mosque, Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which the names of the Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed. This and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5,000 dirhems. Saladin did not completely disregard the upkeep of the mosque and according to al-Mufaddal one of the mosque's minarets was raised during Saladin's rule.\nThe teaching center at the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living.\nAl-Azhar nevertheless remained the seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, the policies of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.\nAl-Azhar eventually adopted Saladin's educational reforms modeled on the college system he instituted, and its fortunes improved under the Mamluks, who restored student stipends and salaries for the shuyūkh (teaching staff).\n\nMamluk Sultanate\nCongregational prayers were reestablished at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated that only one mosque should be used as a congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on 16 January 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.\nAn earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar and a number of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Sayf al-Din Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later, a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, was built along the northwest wall of the mosque. Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339–1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.\nThough the mosque had regained its standing in Cairo, repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan. This changed under the rule of al-Zahir Barquq, the first sultan of the Burji dynasty. Both Sultan Barquq and then Sultan al-Mu'ayyad tried, in 1397 and 1424 respectively, to replace the minaret of al-Azhar with a new one in stone, but on both occasions the construction was found to be defective and had to be pulled down. The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al-Ghuri, each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets that still stand today. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape. The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al-Azhar. Al-Ghuri may also have rebuilt the dome in front of the original mihrab.\nAlthough the mosque-school was the leading university in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.\nBy the 14th century, al-Azhar had achieved a preeminent place as the center for studies in law, theology, and Arabic, becoming a cynosure for students all around the Islamic world. However, only one third of the ulema (Islamic scholars) of Egypt were reported to have either attended or taught at al-Azhar. One account, by Muhammad ibn Iyas, reports that the Salihiyya Madrasa, and not al-Azhar, was viewed as the \"citadel of the ulema\" at the end of the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\nProvince of the Ottoman Empire\nWith the Ottoman annexation of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight to control the city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies for the maintenance of the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.\nDespite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks remained influential in Egyptian society, becoming beys (\"chieftains\"), nominally under the control of the Ottoman governors, instead of amirs at the head of an empire. The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai'r Bey, a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.\nAl-Qazdughli, a powerful Mamluk bey, sponsored several additions and renovations in the early 18th century. Under his direction, a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs, both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.\nThis marked the beginning of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed katkhuda (head of the Janissaries) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the Bab al-Muzayinīn (the Gate of the Barbers), so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis), named for the Sa'idi people of Upper Egypt; and, several years later, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students. A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.\nDuring the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.\nAl-Azhar also served as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman occupation of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops in the vicinity of the mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.\n\nFrench occupation\nNapoleon invaded Egypt in July 1798, arriving in Alexandria on July 2 and moving on to Cairo on July 22. In a bid to placate both the Egyptian population and the Ottoman Empire, Napoleon gave a speech in Alexandria in which he proclaimed his respect for Islam and the Sultan:\n\nPeople of Egypt, you will be told that I have come to destroy your religion: do not believe it! Answer that I have come to restore your rights and punish the usurpers, and that, more than the Mamluks, I respect God, his Prophet and the Koran ... Is it not we who have been through the centuries the friends of the Sultan?\n\nOn July 25 Napoleon set up a diwan made up of nine al-Azhar sheikhs tasked with governing Cairo, the first body of Egyptians to hold official powers since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. This practice of forming councils among the ulema of a city, first instituted in Alexandria, was put in place throughout French-occupied Egypt. Napoleon also unsuccessfully sought a fatwa from the al-Azhar imams that would deem it permissible under Islamic law to declare allegiance to Napoleon.\nNapoleon's efforts to win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire declared war on 9 September 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on 21 October 1798. Egyptians armed with stones, spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon in an attempt to bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 6,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.\nNapoleon, who had been well respected in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered the closing of the mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.\nThe conservative tradition of the mosque, with its lack of attention to science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.\n\nMuhammad Ali Dynasty and British occupation\nFollowing the French withdrawal, Ali, the wāli (governor) and self-declared khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, sought to consolidate his newfound control of the country. To achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit, and eventually eliminate, the ability of the al-Azhar ulema to influence the government. He imposed taxes on rizqa lands (tax-free property owned by mosques) and madrasas, from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income. In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ulema. As a result, Umar Makram, the naqib al-ashraf, a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ulema, was exiled to Damietta.\nAli also sought to limit the influence of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.\nUnder the rule of Isma'il Pasha, the grandson of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated with the aim of transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.\nThe reign of Isma'il Pasha also saw the return of royal patronage to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'ayida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive when his father was deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, aligned the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it, and remodeled the facade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiya along with several other areas of the mosque. Abbas Hilmi II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new three-story riwaq in neo-Mamluk style along the mosque's southwestern corner (known as the Riwaq al-'Abbasi) which was completed in 1901. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (also known as the \"Comité\"), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.\n\nThe major set of reforms that began under the rule of Isma'il Pasha continued under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation. The mosque's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, and a regular system of exams instituted. From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.\nDuring Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as minister of education, before he went on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.\nUnder the reign of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the educational structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one of these three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building across the street from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.\nThe ideas advocated by several influential reformers in the early 1900s, such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri, began to take hold at al-Azhar in 1928, with the appointment of Mustafa al-Maraghi as rector. A follower of Abduh, the majority of the ulema opposed his appointment. Al-Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school, expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects. Fuad disliked al-Maraghi, and had him replaced after one year by al-Zawahiri, but al-Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935, serving until his death in 1945. Under his leadership, al-Azhar's curriculum was expanded to include non-Arabic languages and modern sciences. Al-Zawahiri, who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s, continued the efforts to modernize and reform al-Azhar. Following al-Maraghi's second term as rector, another student of Abduh was appointed rector.\n\nPost 1952 revolution\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, led by the Free Officers Movement of Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, in which the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the university began to be separated from the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive growth in the number of Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.\n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, and later President, Nasser continued the efforts to limit the power of the ulema of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. In 1952, the waqfs were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments, cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs. He abolished the sharia courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ulema. The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al-Azhar, a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception. Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution—independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased. The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws. While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema, they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the state apparatus. The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state, though the purse strings were outside of their control. While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state, he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al-Azhar. One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955. Hussein sought to dismantle the Azharite primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern, secular, collegiate educational system. The ulema opposed this plan, though Nasser's choice of maintaining al-Azhar's status was due more to personal political considerations, such as the use of al-Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime, than on the opposition of the ulema.\nAl-Azhar, now fully integrated as an arm of the government, was then used to justify actions of the government. Although the ulema had in the past issued rulings that socialism is irreconcilable with Islam, following the Revolution's land reforms new rulings were supplied giving Nasser a religious justification for what he termed an \"Islamic\" socialism. The ulema would also serve as a counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood, and to Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi influence. An assassination attempt on Nasser was blamed on the Brotherhood, and the organization was outlawed. Nasser, needing support from the ulema as he initiated mass arrests of Brotherhood members, relaxed some of the restrictions placed on al-Azhar. The ulema of al-Azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle the Brotherhood, and continued to do so in subsequent regimes. Despite the efforts of Nasser and al-Azhar to discredit the Brotherhood, the organization continued to function. Al-Azhar also provided legitimacy for war with Israel in 1967, declaring the conflict against Israel a \"holy struggle\".\nFollowing Nasser's death in 1970, Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar as a symbol of Egyptian leadership throughout the Arab world, saying that \"the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar\". Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions. As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ulema of al-Azhar continued to be used as a tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including Islamist and other more moderate groups. Shukri Mustafa, an influential Islamist figure, accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience. When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel, which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.\nHosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt following Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar would continue to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 until his death in 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law stipulates that al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.\nAl-Azhar continues to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world, and as Sunnis form a large majority of the total Muslim population al-Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole. In addition to being the default authority within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia, he asked the head sheikh of al-Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time French Minister of the Interior, requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools, despite the existence of the French Council of Islam. The sheikh of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an \"Islamic duty\" the Muslim women of France are obligated to respect and follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.\n\nPost 2011 revolution\nAl-Azhar was not unaffected by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections in the months following the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.\n\nIn 2018 a major restoration of the mosque was completed, financed by both King Abdullah and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Among the goals of the restoration was the reinforcement of the building's foundations, the restoration of its architectural elements, and upgrades to its infrastructure. The Bab al-Muzayinīn (Gate of the Barbers), formerly one of the main public entrances to the mosque, has been made less accessible as a result of the restoration project.\nIn 2020, representatives from the mosque spoke out against sexual violence in Egypt, prompted by the social media campaign instigated by student Nadeen Ashraf.\n\nArchitecture\nFoundation and structural evolution under Fatimids\nThe original structure of the mosque was 280 feet (85 m) in length and 227 feet (69 m) wide, and was made up of three arcades situated around a courtyard. To the southeast of the courtyard was the original prayer hall, built as a hypostyle hall, five aisles deep, though with its qibla wall slightly off the correct angle. The marble columns supporting the four arcades that made up the prayer hall were reused from sites extant at different times in Egyptian history, from Pharaonic times through Roman rule to Coptic dominance. The different heights of the columns were made level by using bases of varying thickness. The stucco exterior shows influences from Abbasid, Coptic and Byzantine architecture.\n\nUltimately a total of three domes were built, a common trait among early north African mosques, although none of them have survived Al-Azhar's many renovations. The historian al-Maqrizi recorded that in the original dome al-Siqilli inscribed the following:In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate; according to the command for its building from the servant of Allah, His governor abu Tamim Ma'ad, the Imam al-Mu‘izz li-Dīn Allāh, Amir al-Mu'minin, for whom and his illustrious forefathers and his sons may there be the blessings of Allah: By the hand of his servant Jawhar, the Secretary, the Ṣiqillī in the year 360. Gawhar included the honorific Amir al-Mu'minin, Commander of the Faithful, as the Caliphs title and also included his nickname \"the Secretary\" which he had earned serving as a secretary prior to becoming a general.\n K. A. C. Creswell wrote that the original structure certainly had one dome, and likely a second for symmetry.\nThe original mihrab, uncovered in 1933, has a semi-dome above it with a marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:The next inscription is made up of verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.\n\nThe marble paved central courtyard was added between 1009 and 1010. The arcades that surround the courtyard have keel shaped arches with stucco inscriptions. The arches were built during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. The stucco ornaments also date to his rule and were redone in 1891. Two types of ornaments are used. The first appears above the center of the arch and consists of a sunken roundel and twenty-four lobes. A circular band of vegetal motifs was added in 1893. The second ornament used, which alternates with the first appearing in between each arch, consists of shallow niches below a fluted hood. The hood rests on engaged columns which are surrounded by band of Qu'ranic writing in Kufic script. The Qu'ranic script was added after the rule of al-Hafiz but during the Fatimid period. The walls are topped by a star shaped band with tiered triangular crenellations. The southeastern arcade of the courtyard contains the main entrance to the prayer hall. A Persian framing gate, in which the central arch of the arcade is further in with a higher rectangular pattern above it, opens into the prayer hall.\nA new wooden door was installed during the reign of al-Hakim in 1009. In 1125, al-Amir installed a new wooden mihrab. An additional dome was constructed during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn.\n\nMamluk additions\nThe Fatimid dynasty was succeeded by the rule of Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty. Initially appointed vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al-'Āḍid (who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shi'a history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule. However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs. Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab, with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.\n\nMadrasa al-Taybarsiyya\nThe Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended to function as a complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated with the rest of the mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.\nThe madrasa was completely rebuilt by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda, leaving only the southeastern wall and its mihrab untouched. The mihrab was described by K. A. C. Creswell as being \"one of the finest in Cairo\". The niche of the mihrab is 1.13 meters (3.7 ft) wide and 76 centimeters (30 in) deep. On each side of the niche stands a 2.78 meters (9.1 ft) high porphyry column. Above the columns are impost blocks decorated with colored geometrical designs. The semi-dome at the top of the mihrab is set within an outer arch. Surrounding this arch is a molding that forms a rectangular outer frame. This is the first mihrab in Egypt to have this type of frame. Inside the frame are glass mosaics depicting pomegranate trees.\n\nMadrasa and mausoleum of Aqbugha\nA dome and minaret cover the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Aqbugha, which was built in 1339. Intended by its founder, another Mamluk amir called Sayf al-Din Aqbugha 'Abd al-Wahid, to be a stand-alone mosque and school, the madrasa has since become integrated with the rest of the mosque. It includes both a small tomb chamber and a larger hall, both with mihrabs. The entrance, qibla wall, and the mihrabs with glass mosaics are all original, while the pointed dome was rebuilt in the Ottoman period. Parts of the facade were remodeled by Khedive Tewfik in 1888. The top of the minaret was remodelled by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda so as to have a pointed top like the other Ottoman-style minarets he built around the entrances of the mosque, but at some point after 1932 the top was once again refashioned to end with a Mamluk-style finial which we see today.\n\nMadrasa Gawhariyya\nBuilt in 1440, the Madrasa Gawhariyya contains the tomb of Gawhar al-Qanaqba'i, a Sudanese eunuch who became treasurer to the sultan. The floor of the madrasa is marble, the walls lined with cupboards, decoratively inlaid with ebony, ivory, and nacre. The tomb chamber is covered by small stone dome whose exterior is carved with an arabesque pattern, making it one for the earliest domes in Cairo with this type of decoration (later refined in the dome of Qaytay's mausoleum in the Northern Cemetery). The structure was restored between 1980 and 1982.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nBuilt in 1483 or in 1495, it has a square base, a transitional segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10-sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to have been used in Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.\nThe minaret is believed to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times, including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars. Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the walī and muhtasib of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.\n\nGate of Qaytbay\nDirectly across the courtyard from the entrance from the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Gate of Qaytbay. It is a refined example of the late Mamuk architectural and decorative style. Built in 1495, this gate leads to the court of the prayer hall.\n\nMinaret of al-Ghuri\nThe double finial minaret was built in 1509 by Qansuh al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a decorative keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, a 12-sided polygon separated from the first by fretted balconies supported by muqarnas, is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level is made up of two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.\n\nOttoman renovations and additions\nSeveral additions and restorations were made during Ottoman reign in Egypt, many of which were completed under the direction of Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda who nearly doubled the size of the mosque. Three gates were added by Katkhuda, the Bab al-Muzayinīn (see below), which became the main entrance to the mosque, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), and the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis). To each gate he added a pointed Ottoman-style minaret, of which one was later demolished during the creation of al-Azhar Street. For the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which was adjacent to the Madrasa al-Aqbughiyya, he remodelled the top of Aqbugha's minaret to make it resemble the other Ottoman minarets (though the top was later rebuilt again in a Mamluk style during the 20th century). Several riwaqs were added, including one for the blind students of al-Azhar, as well as refurbished during the Ottoman period. Katkhuda also added an additional prayer hall south of the original Fatimid hall, with an additional mihrab, doubling the total prayer area. His overall work reintegrated the mosque's disparate elements in a relatively unified whole.\n\nBab al-Muzayinīn\nThe Bab al-Muzayinīn (\"Gate of the Barbers\", Arabic: باب المزينين) was built in 1753. Credited to Katkhuda the gate has two doors, each surrounded by recessed arches. Two molded semi-circular arches with tympanums decorated with trefoils stand above the doors. Above the arches is a frieze with panels of cypress trees, a common trait of Ottoman work.\nA free-standing minaret, built by Katkhuda, originally stood outside the gate. The minaret was demolished prior to the opening of al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.\n\nCurrent layout and structure\nThe present main entrance to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard at the opposite end of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the entrance to the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.\nThe mihrab has recently been changed to a plain marble facing with gold patterns, replacing some of the Mamluk marble facing, but the stucco carvings in the semi-dome are likely from the Fatimid era.\n\nSee also\nBab al-Futuh\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nSabil-Kuttab of Katkhuda\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nSources\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-Azhar Mosque at Wikimedia Commons",
          "summary": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.",

          "content": "الجامع الأزهر هو أهم مساجد مصر على الإطلاق، وأحد المعاقل التاريخية لنشر وتعليم الإسلام كذلك هو واحد من أشهر المساجد الأثرية في مصر والعالم الإسلامي، وجزء من مؤسسة الأزهر الشريف يعود تاريخ بنائه إلى بداية عهد الدولة الفاطمية في مصر، بعدما أتم جوهر الصقلي فتح مصر سنة 969م، وشرع في تأسيس القاهرة قام بإنشاء القصر الكبير وأعده لنزول الخليفة المعز لدين الله، وفي أثناء ذلك بدأ في إنشاء الجامع الأزهر ليصلي فيه الخليفة، وليكون مسجداً جامعاً للمدينة حديثة النشأة أسوة بجامع عمرو في الفسطاط وجامع ابن طولون في القطائع، كذلك أعد وقتها ليكون معهداً تعليمياً لتعليم المذهب الشيعي ونشره، فبدأ في بناؤه في جمادي الأول 359هـ/970م، وأتم بناءه وأقيمت أول جمعة فيه في رمضان سنة 361هـ /972م، وعرف بجامع القاهرة ورغم أن يد الإصلاح والترميم توالت عليه على مر العصور فغيرت كثيراً من معالمه الفاطمية إلا أنه يعد أقدم أثر فاطمي قائم بمصر. وقد اختلف المؤرخون في أصل تسمية هذا الجامع، والراجح أن الفاطميين سموه بالأزهر تيمناً بفاطمة الزهراء ابنة النبي محمد.\nيعتبر المسجد ثاني أقدم جامعة قائمة بشكل مستمر في العالم بعد جامعة القرويين. ورغم أن جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط سبقه في وظيفة التدريس حيث كانت تعقد فيه حلقات الدرس تطوعاً وتبرعاً، إلا أن الجامع الأزهر يعد الأول في مصر في تأدية دور المدارس والمعاهد النظامية، فكانت دروسه تعطى بتكليف من الدولة ويؤجر عليها العلماء والمدرسين. وألقي أول درس فيه في صفر سنة 365هـ/975م على يد علي بن النعمان القاضي في فقه الشيعة، وفي سنة 378هـ/988م قررت مرتبات لفقهاء الجامع وأعدت داراً لسكناهم بجواره وكانت عدتهم خمسة وثلاثين رجلاً.\nبعد سقوط الدولة الفاطمية أفل نجم الأزهر على يد صلاح الدين الأيوبي الذي كان يهدف من وراء ذلك إلى محاربة المذهب الشيعي ومؤازرة المذهب السني، فأبطلت الخطبة فيه وظلت معطلة مائة عام إلى أن أعيدت في عهد السلطان المملوكي الظاهر بيبرس البندقداري. وفي عهد الدولة المملوكية عاد الأزهر ليؤدي رسالته العلمية ودوره الحيوي، فعين به فقهاء لتدريس المذهب السني والأحاديث النبوية وعنى بتجديده وتوسعته وصيانته فعد ذلك العصر الذهبي للأزهر، كما أظهر الحكام والأعيان في العصور التالية اهتماماً ملحوظاً بترميمه وصيانته وأوقفت عليه أوقافاً كثيرة.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الأول صدر القانون رقم 46 لسنة 1930 للأزهر والذي بموجبه أنشأت كليات أصول الدين والشريعة واللغة والعربية لاحقاً سنة 1933، وأصبح للأزهر رسميًا جامعة مستقلة في عام 1961. وقد اعتبرت جامعة الأزهر الأولى في العالم الإسلامي لدراسة المذهب السني والشريعة الإسلامية. ولا يزال الأزهر حتى اليوم منارة لنشر وسطية الإسلام ومؤسسة لها تأثير عميق في المجتمع المصري ورمزاً من رموز مصر الإسلامية.\n\nالتسمية\nتأسست مدينة القاهرة على يد جوهر الصقلي، وهو قائد فاطمي رومي من أصل يوناني من جزيرة صقلية، وأطلق عليها اسم المنصورية، وأُعِدَّت المنصورية لتكون مقراً للخلافة الفاطمية المتواجدة في تونس، وقد استخدم المسجد لأول مرة في عام 972، وسُمّي في البداية بجامع المنصورية، وقد كانت تسمية المسجد باسم المدينة التي يتواجد بها ممارسة شائعة في ذلك الوقت، ومع دخول الخليفة المعز لدين الله لمصر قام بتسمية المدينة بالقاهرة، وهكذا أصبح اسم المسجد جامع قاهرة، حسب أول نسخة من المصادر العربية التاريخية.\nاكتسب المسجد اسمه الحالي، الأزهر، في وقت ما بين الخليفة المعز، ونهاية عهد الخليفة الفاطمي الثاني في مصر العزيز بالله، والأزهر معناه المشرق وهو صيغة المذكر لكلمة الزهراء، والزَّهْرَاءُ لقبُ السيدة فاطمة بنتِ الرسول محمد، زوجة الخليفة علي بن أبي طالب، وقد ادعى المعز وأئمة الدولة الفاطمية أنهم من سلفهم؛ وهي النظرية الوحيدة المتداولة عن سبب تسمية الأزهر بهذا الاسم، ومع ذلك، لم تُؤَكَّد هذه النظرية في أي مصدر عربي، وقد استُحْسِن دعمها كلياً، وقد نفتها مصادر غربية في وقت لاحق.\nيُقدم آخرون نظرية بديلة تتمثل في أن اسم المسجد اشتق من الأسماء التي قدمها الخلفاء الفاطميين إلى قصورهم القريبة من المسجد، فقد أطلقوا على قصورهم القصور الزاهرة تيمنًا بالحدائق الملكية بها التي اختيرت من قبل العزيز بالله، وبعد أن انتُهِىَ من القصور؛ غُيِّر اسم المسجد من جامع القاهرة إلى الأزهر. أما اشتقاق كلمة جامع من جذر الكلمة العربية الجامعة، وتعني «الجمع»، ويتم استخدام الكلمة للتعبير عن المساجد التي تجمع الكثير من الناس.\n\nالتاريخ\nفي عصر الدولة الفاطمية (التأسيس)\nفي عهد الخليفة الفاطمي المعز لدين الله الإمام الإسماعيلي الرابع، قامت الجيوش الفاطمية بغزو مصر تحت قيادة جوهر الصقلي، والذي نجح في انتزاعها من سلالة الإخشيديين، وبأمر من الخليفة، أشرف جوهر على بناء المركز الملكي «للخلافة الفاطمية» وجيشها، وقد بنى الأزهر كقاعدة لنشر مذهب الشيعة الإسماعيلية، والذي يقع بالقرب من مدينة الفسطاط السنية، وقد أصبحت القاهرة مركزاً للطائفة الإسماعيلية الشيعية، ومقر حكم الدولة الفاطمية. وعلى ذلك أمر جوهر ببدء بناء مسجد كبير للمدينة الجديدة، وقد بدأ العمل في إنشائه سنة 970، وأتم في سنة 972، فعقدت أول صلاة جمعة فيه في 22 يونيو 972 خلال شهر رمضان.\nسرعان ما أصبح الأزهر مركزًا للتعليم، وتخرج منه التصريحات الرسمية وتُعقد به جلسات المحاكم، وأصبحت التعاليم الباطنية الخاصة بالمذهب الإسماعيلي - والتي كانت تعاليم سرية لفترة طويلة - متاحة لعامة الناس في الأزهر، وقد عين المعز القاضي النعمان بن محمد القاضي، مسؤولاً عن تدريس المذهب الإسماعيلي، وكانت بعض الفصول تُدرَّس في قصر الخليفة، وكذلك في الأزهر، مع دورات منفصلة للنساء، وخلال عيد الفطر عام 973، رُسِّمَ المسجد مسجدًا رسميًّا لصلاة الجماعة في القاهرة بأمر من الخليفة المعز وابنه عندما أصبح بدوره الخليفة، وجعلوا خطبة الجمعة خلال شهر رمضان في الأزهر.\nكما جعل يعقوب بن كلس - الفقيه والوزير الرسمي الأول للفاطميين - من الأزهر مركزًا رئيسيًا لتعليم القانون الإسلامي في عام 988، وفي السنة التالية، وُظِّفَ 45 عالمًا لإعطاء الدروس، ليتحول الأزهر إلى جامعة رائدة في العالم الإسلامي.\nوُسِّع المسجد أثناء حكم الخليفة العزيز (975–996). ووفقا للمفضل فإن العزيز أمر بترميم أجزاء من المسجد كانت قد تصدعت، واستكمل الخليفة الفاطمي التالي الحاكم بأمر الله ترميم المسجد ووفَّر بابًا خشبيًا جديدًا في عام 1010. ومع ذلك، شهد عهد الحاكم تشييد مسجده الذي سمي باسمه تيمنا به، ويعد تشييد مسجد الحاكم فقد الأزهر مركزه كمسجد صلاة الجماعة الأولى في القاهرة. وفي أيار/مايو 1009 أصبح مسجد الحاكم بأمر الله المكان الوحيد لخطب الخليفة وخطبة الجمعة. وبعد عهد الحاكم استعاد الأزهر مكانه في عهد المستنصر، وقد نُفِّذَت إضافات وتجديدات على المسجد، كما أضيفت الكثير من التجديدات في عهد الخلفاء الفاطميين الذين أتوا من بعده.\nأُنشِئت مكتبةٌ ضخمةٌ تابعةٌ للجامع الأزهر وهبها الخليفة الفاطمي في 1005 الآلاف من المخطوطات التي أعطت قيمة بليغة للمكتبة، وكان ذلك ضمن محاولة الفاطميين بشتى الجهود نشر ممارسة المذهب الإسماعيلي بين الناس، ولكن لم تنجح جهودهم، فالكثير من هذه المخطوطات فُرِقَّت في الفوضى التي تلت سقوط «الدولة الفاطمية»، وأصبح الأزهر فيما بعد مؤسسة سنية كبيرة.\n\nفي عصر الدولة الأيوبية\nكان صلاح الدين الأيوبي الذي أطاح بالفاطميين عام 1171 معادياً لمبادئ التعاليم الشيعية التي رُوِّجَت في الأزهر أثناء الخلافة الفاطمية، لذلك أُهِمَل المسجد خلال حكم السلالة الأيوبية لمصر، وحظر صدر الدين بن درباس الصلاة فيه، وهو قاضٍ عين من قبل صلاح الدين الأيوبي، والسبب في هذا المرسوم قد يكون بسبب الفقه الشافعي الذي يرى بعدم جواز خطبتين في بلد واحد، وقد يكون بسبب عدم الثقة في الجامع باعتباره مؤسسة شيعية، وأصبح مسجد الحاكم بأمر الله وهو المسجد الذي تُجرى فيه صلاة الجماعة وخطبة الجمعة في القاهرة.\nبالإضافة إلى تجريد الأزهر من مركزه كمسجد صلاة الجماعة، أمر صلاح الدين الأيوبي أيضاً بإزالة شريط فضة أدرجت فيه أسماء الخلفاء الفاطميين عليه من محراب المسجد. كذلك أمر بإزالة شرائط فضية مماثلة من المساجد الأخرى بلغت قيمتها 5000 درهم. لم يتجاهل صلاح الدين الأيوبي تماماً صيانة المسجد، ووفقا للمفضل فإن إحدى مآذن المسجد رممت خلال حكم صلاح الدين.\nكما أفل نجم الأزهر كمركز للتعليم الديني،  فسُحِبَ تمويل الطلاب، ولم تعد دروس الفقه تعقد في المسجد، واضطر الأساتذة الذين ذاع صيتهم في عهد الفاطميين إلى البحث عن وسائل أخرى لكسب عيشهم. كما تعرضت مكتبة المسجد الضخمة للإهمال، ودمرت مخطوطات التعاليم الفاطمية التي كانت تُدرَّس في الأزهر. ومع ذلك ظل الأزهر مكاناً لتعليم بعض العلوم الأخرى طوال تلك الفترة، فبينما تم إيقاف فصول الدراسة الرسمية في الجامع، إلا أنه استمرت الدروس الخاصة لتعليم اللغة العربية، وتذكر بعض المصادر أن البغدادي درَّس عددًَا من المواضيع مثل القانون والطب في الأزهر، وقد أمر صلاح الدين بأن يُدفع له راتبًا قُدر بـ 30 دينار، ثم ارتفع إلى 100 دينار من خلفاء صلاح الدين الأيوبي، على الجانب الآخر شجع الأيوبيون تدريس الفقه السني في المدارس المعانة، التي بنيت في جميع أنحاء القاهرة،  وأنشئت المؤسسات التعليمية من قبل الحكام السنيين كوسيلة لمكافحة ما يعتبرونه هرطقة تعاليم «الشيعة»، وقد كانت هذه الكليات تتراوح في حجمها وتركز على تعليم المذهب السني، وكان لها منهجًا ثابتًا وموحدًا شمل دورات خارج مواضيع دينية محضة، مثل البلاغة، والرياضيات، والعلوم، وقد بُنيت 26 مدرسة سنية في مصر فقط خلال عهد صلاح الدين والحكام الأيوبيين الذين أتوا من بعده، منها المدرسة الصالحية.\nاعتمد الأزهر في نهاية المطاف الإصلاحات التعليمية التي فرضها صلاح الدين، وتحسنت حظوظه في عهد المماليك، الذين أعادوا رواتب الطلاب ورواتب الشيوخ.\n\nفي عصر الدولة المملوكية\nأعيد إقامة الصلاة في الأزهر أثناء حكم المماليك بأمر من السلطان بيبرس في 1266، ومع التوسع السريع في القاهرة، والحاجة إلى دور المسجد، قام السلطان بيبرس بتجاهل تاريخ الأزهر كمؤسسة لنشر المذهب الشيعي الإسماعيلي، وأمر بعودة رواتب الطلاب والمعلمين، فضلا عن بداية العمل لإصلاح المسجد، الذي أهمل منذ ما يقرب من 100 سنة. ووفقا للمفضل، فإن الأمير عز الدين أيدامور الهيلي بنى منزله بجوار المسجد، لمراقبة أعمال الإصلاح. وقد ذكر تقي الدين المقريزي أن الأمير أصلح الجدران والسقف، ووفَّر الحصير الجديد. وألقيت الخطبة الأولى منذ عهد الخليفة الفاطمي الحاكم في 16 كانون الثاني/يناير 1266، وقد ألقيت الخطبة على منبر جديد انتهى تجهيزه قبل الخطبة بخمسة أيام.\n\nفي عام 1302 تسبب زلزال بأضرار كبيرة للأزهر وعدد من المساجد الأخرى في جميع أنحاء مصر. وتم تقسيم مسؤولية إعادة الإعمار بين أمراء السلطنة وكان المكلف بترميم الأزهر هو الأمير سالار، ليتولى بذلك أول أعمال إصلاح منذ عهد بيبرس، وبعد سبع سنوات تم بناء المدرسة الأقبغاوية على طول الجدار الذي يقع في الشمال الغربي من المسجد، وتمت إزالة أجزاء من جدار المسجد لاستيعاب المبنى الجديد، وبدأت أشغال بناء مدرسة أخرى، سميت بالمدرسة الطيبرسية في 1332-1333. وقد اكتمل هذا المبنى في 1339-1340، وبنى أيضا هيكل للمسجد، ونافورة للوضوء. وبنيت كل المدارس والمباني المكملة للأزهر، بمداخل وقاعات صلاة منفصلة.\nعلى الرغم من أن المسجد قد استعاد مكانته في عهد المماليك، إلا أن أعمال التصليح والتوسعة، نفذت بأوامر من هم في مواقع أقل من السلطان، وقد تغير هذا في ظل حكم الظاهر برقوق، أول المماليك الشركس، الذي أولى المسجد رعايته المباشرة، وخلال أواخر حكم المماليك أدخلت تحسينات وإضافات من قبل السلطانين قايتباي وقنصوه الغوري، فأشرف كل منهما على العديد من الإصلاحات وبناء المآذن. وقد كانت هناك ممارسة شائعة بين سلاطين المماليك لبناء المآذن، ويُنظر إليها على أنها رمز القوة والطريقة الأكثر فعالية في تدعيم صورة مدينة القاهرة، وتمنى كل سلطان أن تكون له لمسة مرموقة في الأزهر.\nعلى الرغم من أن مسجد الأزهر كان جامعة رائدة في العالم الإسلامي واستعاد الرعاية الملكية، إلا أنه لم يتفوق على المدارس الأخرى، كمكان مفضل للتعليم بين النخبة في القاهرة. واستمرت سمعة الأزهر بوصفه مكانًا مستقلًا للتعليم، في حين أن المدارس الدينية التي تم بنائها خلال حكم صلاح الدين الأيوبي كانت مندمجة تماما في النظام التعليمي للدولة. واستمر الأزهر في جذب الطلاب من مناطق أخرى في مصر والشرق الأوسط، وتجاوز أعداد الطلاب به أعداد الذين يحضرون المدارس الدينية الأخرى، وجرت دراسة فروع الشريعة الإسلامية بمتوسط مدة دراسة ست سنوات. في القرن الرابع عشر حقق الأزهر مكانة بارزة باعتباره مركز لدراسات الشريعة والفقه واللغة العربية، وأصبح قبلة الأنظار للطلاب من جميع أنحاء العالم الإسلامي. حتى بلغ عدد من درسوا به حوالي ثلث علماء المسلمين في مصر.\n\nفي عصر الدولة العثمانية\nخلال بداية عهد الخلافة العثمانية سنة 1517 أظهر الأتراك احتراماً كبيراً للمسجد وكُليته، على الرغم من توقف الرعاية الملكية المباشرة له، فقد حضر السلطان سليم الأول بعد دخوله إلى مصر صلاة الجمعة في الجامع الأزهر، وذلك خلال الأسبوع الأخير له في مصر، كذلك كان يحضر الأمراء العثمانيين بانتظام لصلاة الجمعة في الأزهر، ولقد وفَّر العثمانيون رواتب للطلاب والمعلمين؛ لكن نادرًا ما يتم القيام بأي تطويرات أو توسيعات بالمسجد خلال العهد العثماني، على عكس عهد المماليك التي أُجريت فيه الكثير من التوسعات والإضافات.\nظل للمماليك تأثير خاص في المجتمع المصري على الرغم من هزيمتهم على يد سليم الأول والعثمانيين في عام 1517، فأصبحوا بايات وولاة في الدولة العثمانية، بدلا من أمراء وأصحاب دولة وإمبراطورية. ويعتبر خاير بك أول حاكم لمصر في عهد سليم الأول بعد يونس باشا، وهو أمير مملوكي انشق إلى العثمانيين خلال معركة مرج دابق، وعلى الرغم من أن المماليك قاموا بثورات متعددة لإعادة دولة المماليك، بما في ذلك ثورتان في عام 1523، فلم يقم العثمانيون بالإبادة الكاملة للمماليك على في مصر.\nوقد عانى المماليك من خسائر – اقتصادية وعسكرية على حد سواء – في أعقاب انتصار العثمانيين، وهذا ينعكس في عدم وجود المساعدات المالية المقدمة إلى الأزهر في أول مئة عام من الحكم العثماني. وفي القرن الثامن عشر استطاع نخبة من المماليك استعادة الكثير من نفوذهم، وقامو بتجديدات عديدة في جميع أنحاء القاهرة والأزهر.\nوقد قام القازدوغلي بك المملوكي بالعديد من الإضافات والتجديدات في بداية القرن 18. وتحت إدارته أُضِيف رواق للطلاب المكفوفين في سنة 1735. وقام أيضا بإعادة بناء أروقة تركية وسورية، وكلاهما قد بنيت في الأصل في عهد قايتباي.\nثم أجريت توسعات كبيرة على يد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، وقد عين كتخدا (رئيسا للإنكشارية) في 1749، وشرع في عدة مشاريع في جميع أنحاء القاهرة والأزهر. وتحت إدارته بُنِيَت ثلاث بوابات جديدة للجامع: باب المزينين (بوابة الحلاقين)، وقد سُمِّى بذلك لأنه يخرج منه الطلاب لحلق رؤوسهم، الذي أصبح في نهاية المطاف المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد؛ وباب الصعايدة، ومخصص لدخول أهل صعيد مصر، وفي وقت لاحق أنشئ باب الشربة، والشربة هي حساء الأرز وهي من الأكلات التي غالباً يتم تقديمها إلى الطلاب، وأضيفت قاعة للصلاة في جنوب المُصلى الأصلي، وضوعفت أيضا حجم المساحة المتاحة للصلاة. وقام كتخدا أيضا بتجديد أو إعادة بناء العديد من الأروقة التي تحيط بالمسجد. ودفن كتخدا في الأزهر في عام 1776، وأصبح كتخدا الشخص الأول (والأخير) الذي يدفن داخل المسجد منذ نفيسة البكرية التي توفيت حوالي عام 1588.\nخلال العهد العثماني استعاد الأزهر مركزه كأكبر مؤسسة تعليمية في مصر، متجاوز المدارس الدينية التي أسسها صلاح الدين الأيوبي، وتوسع الأزهر بشكل كبير بجهود المماليك. وبنهاية القرن الثامن عشر، أصبح الأزهر مرتبطًا ارتباطًا وثيقا بعلماء مصر، وقد كان للعلماء القدرة على التأثير على الحكومة بصفة رسمية، وتم تعيين عدة شيوخ في المجالس الاستشارية التي تقدم التقارير إلى الباشا، هذه الفترة شهدت إدراج دورات تعليمية أكثر لتُدرَّس في الأزهر، مع العلم والمنطق ضُمَّت الفلسفة في المناهج الدراسية. وخلال هذه الفترة، شهد الأزهر أول شيخ للأزهر ليس من المذهب المالكي وهو عبد الله الشبراوي الشافعي المذهب، ولم يعد منصب شيخ الأزهر من المالكية حتى عام 1899 عندما أصبح سليم البشري شيخًا للأزهر.\nكان الأزهر أيضا بمثابة نقطة محورية للاحتجاجات ضد الولاة أثناء الحكم العثماني لمصر، سواء كانت الاحتجاجات داخل أوساط العلماء أو داخل أوساط الطلبة أو من عامة الناس. وقد كانت الاحتجاجات الطلابية التي عقدت في الأزهر شائعة بين عامة الناس، وأغلقت المحلات التجارية في محيط المسجد تضامنا مع الطلاب، كما كان أيضا العلماء في بعض الأحيان قادرين على تحدي الحكومة.\nما بين 1730–1731، قام آغاوات الدولة العثمانية بمضايقة السكان المقيمين بالقرب من الأزهر أثناء ملاحقة بعض الهاربين، وأغلقت البوابات في الأزهر احتجاجا على ذلك، وأمر الحاكم العثماني الآغاوات الامتناع عن الذهاب قرب الأزهر، خوفاً من قيام انتفاضة كبرى، وقد حدث اضطراب آخر في عام 1791 تسبب فيه مضايقات الوالي قرب مسجد الإمام الحسين، ثم ذهب إلى الأزهر لتبرير موقفه. وقد أقيل الوالي بعد ذلك من منصبه.\n\nالحملة الفرنسية\nغزا نابليون مصر في يوليو 1798، فوصل إلى الإسكندرية يوم 2 يوليو ودخل القاهرة يوم 22 يوليو، وفي محاولة لاسترضاء السكان المصريين والإمبراطورية العثمانية، ألقى نابليون خطابا في الإسكندرية والذي أعلن فيه عن مدى احترامه للإسلام والسلطان:\n\nوفي 25 يوليو أنشأ نابليون ديوان يتكون من تسعة شيوخ الأزهر، وكلفهم بإدارة القاهرة، وهي أول هيئة رسمية من المصريين منذ بداية الحكم العثماني، وشكل أول مجلس في الإسكندرية، وشمل لاحقا جميع أنحاء مصر الخاضعة للاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد سعى نابليون أيضا لفتوى من أئمة الأزهر، التي من شأنها تنص بجواز الولاء لنابليون بموجب الشريعة الإسلامية، لكن من غير جدوى.\nوباءت جهود نابليون للهيمنة على المصريين والعثمانيين بالفشل؛ فقد أعلنت الإمبراطورية العثمانية الحرب في 9 سبتمبر 1798، وبدأت ثورة ضد القوات الفرنسية من الأزهر في 21 أكتوبر 1798، وقام المصريون المسلحون بالحجارة والرماح فقط بأعمال بطولية ضد جيش نابليون الجرار، وفي صباح اليوم التالي اجتمع الديوان مع نابليون في محاولة للتوصل إلى نهاية سلمية للأعمال العدائية، وقد غضب نابليون في البداية، لكنه وافق لمحاولة التوصل إلى حل سلمي، وطلب من شيوخ الديوان تنظيم محادثات مع الثوار، وقد اعتبر الثوار هذه الخطوة تدل على ضعف الفرنسيين ورفضوها، وعلى إثر هذا أمر نابليون بإطلاق النار على المدينة من قلعة القاهرة، وتصويب النار على الأزهر مباشرة. وخلال التمرد قتل حوالي ثلاثمائة جندي فرنسي، وأُصيب 3,000 مصري، وقتل ستة من علماء الأزهر بعد أن حُكم بالإعدام عليهم، وقد ألقت القوات الفرنسية القبض على كل مصري شارك في المظاهرات ووضع في السجن، وإذا وجدوا عنده سلاح قُطع رأسه، وقد دنست القوات الفرنسية المسجد عمدًا، ومشوا فيه بأحذيتهم والبنادق المعروضة. وقامت القوات بربط خيولها في المحراب ونهب أرباع الطلاب والمكتبات، ورموا نسخًا من القرآن على الأرض. ثم حاول قادة الثورة التفاوض على التسوية مع نابليون، ورُفِضَ طلبهم.\nوفقد نابليون احترام وإعجاب المصريين بعد قيام الثورة، بعد أن كان يحظى باحترام كبير في مصر، وبعد أن لُقِّب بـ السلطان العظيم بين الناس في القاهرة، وفي مارس 1800، اُغتيل الجنرال الفرنسي جان بابتيست كليبر على يد سليمان الحلبي، وهو طالب في الأزهر. وبعد عملية الاغتيال، أمر نابليون بإغلاق المسجد، وظلت أبوابه مغلقة حتى وصول المساعدات العثمانية والبريطانية في أغسطس 1801، وقد فقد المسجد الكثير من محتوياته بغزو نابليون.\nاستفاد الأزهر كثيرًا من ابتكار آلة الطباعة الحديثة، التي أضافت بدورها بُعْدًا آخر في مجال التعليم، وقد تحولت المناهج الدراسية من محاضرات عن طريق الفم وتحفيظ للدرس بالنص إلى محاضرات مطبوعة، ولقد اكتسب مطبعة خاصة به في عام 1930.\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، شجع محمد على باشا على إدخال التعليم غير الديني في الأزهر مثل دراسة التاريخ والرياضيات والعلوم الحديثة، وقد اعتُمِد على المناهج الدراسية التي كانت تلقى قبل عام 1872، تحت إشراف جمال الدين الأفغاني، كما أضيفت الفلسفة الأوروبية لمناهج الدراسة.\n\nمحمد علي والاحتلال البريطاني\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، قام الوالي محمد علي بتعيين نفسه خديويًّا (أميرًا) على مصر، وسعى لتوطيد سيطرته على مصر الحديثة التي أسسها، ولتحقيق هذه الغاية فقد اتخذ عددا من الخطوات للحد، والقضاء على قدرة علماء الأزهر للتأثير على الحكومة. وفرض ضرائب على أراضي رزقة (وهي أراضٍ تابعة للمساجد) والمدارس الدينية، كما قام أيضا بأخذ جزء كبير من مداخيل الأزهر،  وفي يونيو 1809، أمر بمصادرة جميع أراضي رزقة وضمها إلى أملاك الدولة في خطوة أثارت غضبًا واسعًا بين العلماء، ونتيجة لذلك، قام عمر مكرم بثورة في يوليو 1809، وقد فشلت الثورة ونفي مكرم، حليف العلماء، إلى دمياط.\nسعى محمد علي أيضا إلى الحد من نفوذ شيوخ الأزهر بتوزيع المناصب داخل الحكومة لأولئك الذين تلقوا تعليمهم خارج الأزهر. وبعث الطلاب إلى فرنسا تحديدًا، لينشئوا تحت نظام تعليمي غربي، وقام بإنشاء نظام تعليمي يستند إلى هذا النموذج وموازيًا إليه، وهكذا تجاوز نظام الأزهر.\nواستهلت مشاريع الأشغال العامة الرئيسية تحت حكم إسماعيل باشا، حفيد محمد علي، بهدف تحويل مدينة القاهرة إلى الطراز الأوروبي، في البداية كانت هذه المشاريع ممولة من مصنع القطن، لكنه استدان ديون ضخمة من البريطانيين، وأصبحت تلك الديون ذريعة لبريطانيا باحتلال مصر عام 1882، بعد إجبار إسماعيل باشا على دفعها في عام 1879.\nكما شهد عهد إسماعيل باشا أيضا عودة الرعاية الملكية السامية إلى الأزهر، واستعاد إسماعيل باب الصعايدة (بني لأول مرة في عهد كتخدا) والمدرسة الأقبغاوية، كما واصل توفيق باشا بن إسماعيل - الذي أصبح بدوره الخديوي بعد أن أطاح بوالده نتيجة للضغط البريطاني - استعادة المسجد، وقام توفيق بتجديد قاعة الصلاة التي أضيفت في عهد كتخدا، بمحاذاة الواجهة الجنوبية الشرقية من القاعة والشارع الذي يقع وراءها، وإعادة تشكيل عدة مناطق أخرى من المسجد. ونجح ابن توفيق، عباس الثاني خديوي مصر والسودان في عام 1892، بإعادة هيكلة الواجهة الرئيسية للمسجد وبنى الرواق الجديد واستمرت التجديدات التي كتبها جده إسماعيل. وتحت حكمه، واستعيدت لجنة حفظ الآثار الفنية العربية (شكلت في البداية تحت الاحتلال الفرنسي)، وأيضا استعاد الصحن الفاطمي الأصلي.\nكما استمرت مجموعة كبيرة من الإصلاحات التي بدأت في ظل حكم إسماعيل باشا في ظل الاحتلال البريطاني، ومع قدوم شيخ الأزهر محمد المهدي العباسي، وضعت مجموعة من الإصلاحات تهدف إلى تشكيل هئية تدريس هيكل تعليمي لتوحيد امتحانات الطلاب في عام 1872، وقد بذل الجهد لتحديث النظام التعليمي تحت إدارة حلمي خلال الاحتلال البريطاني، وجُمِعَت مخطوطات المسجد في مكتبة مركزية، وحُسِّنَت أيضا المرافق الصحية للطلاب، ووضع نظام للامتحانات. وفي عام 1885، وضعت كليات أخرى في مصر مباشرة تحت إدارة الجامع الأزهر.\nوخلال فترة سعد زغلول كوزير للتعليم، قبل أن ينتقل إلى قيادة الثورة المصرية عام 1919، بُذلت جهود أخرى لتعديل السياسة التعليمية للأزهر، وأيده التيار المحافظ في سياسته، في حين لقي سعد زغلول معارضة تيارات أخرى مثل جماعة الإخوان المسلمون التي تأسست عام 1928، وقد جذبت المدرسة طلاب من جميع أنحاء العالم، بما في ذلك طلاب من جنوب شرق آسيا وخاصة إندونيسيا.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الأول، صدر قانونان من شأنهما تنظيم الهيكل التعليمي للأزهر. وأول هذه القوانين، في عام 1930، وينص على تقسيم المدرسة إلى ثلاثة أقسام: اللغة العربية، الشريعة، وأصول الدين، وأن يقع كل قسم في مبنى خارج المسجد في جميع أنحاء القاهرة، ويُمتحن الطلاب امتحانًا رسميًا لكسب شهادة في واحدة من هذه المجالات الثلاثة من الدراسة، وبعد ست سنوات، صدر القانون الثاني الذي نقل المكتب الرئيسي للمدرسة لمبنى شُيِّد حديثًا موازيًا لشارع المسجد، وأضيفت هياكل إضافية في وقت لاحق لاستكمال إدارات المباني الثلاثة.\nكما بدأت الأفكار التي ينادي بها العديد من الإصلاحيين تزداد في مدخل القرن العشرين، أمثال محمد عبده ومحمد الأحمدي الظواهري وغيرهم من المفكرين، وأخذت هذه الأفكار تترسخ في الأزهر، وفي عام 1928 عُيِّن محمد مصطفى المراغي شيخًا للأزهر وهو من أتباع محمد عبده. وقد عارضت الغالبية العظمى من العلماء تعيينه، وبدأت إدارة المراغي وخلفائه سلسلة من الإصلاحات والتحديثات التي طرأت على المسجد وجامعته، وتوسيع المناهج التعليمية خارج إطار الموضوعات التقليدية. وقد كره الملك فؤاد المراغي، وقام باستبداله بعد سنة واحدة من تعيينه وعين الظواهري مكانه، ولكن المراغي عاد إلى منصب شيخًا للأزهر في عام 1935، وظل بمركزه حتى وفاته في عام 1945. وتحت قيادته وُسِّعَت مناهج الأزهر لتشمل لغات غير العربية والعلوم الحديثة.\n\nالأزهر وثورة يوليو\nفي أعقاب الثورة المصرية عام 1952، التي قامت بها حركة الضباط الأحرار بقيادة محمد نجيب وجمال عبد الناصر، والتي أدت إلى سقوط النظام الملكي المصري، خلال هذه الفترة تمت مراحل فصل الجامعة عن المسجد. وقد تم ضم الكثير من الممتلكات التي تحيط بالمسجد وهدمها لتوفير مساحة للحرم الحديث، وفي عام 1955، لم يعد المسجد بمثابة مدرسة، وتم إنشاء كليات رسمية للجامعة في عام 1961، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون ينص على فصل الأدوار المزدوجة للمؤسسة التعليمية والمؤسسة الدينية التي لقيت آذانا صاغية في جميع أنحاء العالم الإسلامي، ونص القانون على إنشاء كليات غير دينية داخل الأزهر، مثل كليات الطب والهندسة، والاقتصاد، وتعزيز الجهود في التحديث للمرة الأولى بعد الاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد أدت إصلاحات المناهج إلى نمو هائل في عدد الطلاب المصريين الذين حضروا إلى المدارس، وعلى وجه الخصوص الشباب الذين يحضرون المدارس الابتدائية والمدارس الثانوية داخل منظومة الأزهر، وبحسب إحصائيات عدد الطلبة الذين حضروا إلى مدارس الأزهر الابتدائية والمدارس الثانوية ارتفع من أقل 90,000 طالب في عام 1970 إلى 300,000 طالب في أوائل الثمانينات، ثم إلى ما يقرب من مليون طالب في أوائل التسعينات، وتجاوز 1.3 مليون طالب في عام 2001.\n\nوقد واصل جمال عبد الناصر خلال فترة توليه منصب رئيس الوزراء، ثم الرئيس، جهوده المبذولة للحد من سلطة علماء الأزهر وإلى استخدام نفوذهم لمصلحته، وفي عام 1952 أُمِّمَت الأوقاف ووضعت تحت سلطة وزارة الأوقاف التي أنشئت حديثًا، مما قطع من قدرة المسجد للسيطرة على الشؤون المالية، وألغى المحاكم الشرعية، ودمج المحاكم الدينية مع النظام القضائي للدولة في عام 1955، مما يحد بشدة من استقلال العلماء، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون الإصلاح، الذي ينص على إبطال قانون استقال الأزهر عام 1936، وأصبح لرئيس مصر سلطة تعيين شيخ الأزهر، وهو موقف أنشئ لأول مرة أثناء الحكم العثماني.\n\nوواصل الأزهر، الذي ظل رمزاً للطابع الإسلامي للأمة والدولة، التأثير على السكان بينما لم يصبح قادرًا على فرض إرادته على الدولة. وتعرض الأزهر بشكل متزايد إلى بيروقراطية الدولة بعد الثورة وتوقف استقلال منهجه ووظيفته كمسجد، كذلك أُضعِفت سلطة العلماء بإنشاء الوكالات الحكومية المسؤولة عن تقديم تفسيرات للقوانين الدينية، في حين أن هذه الإصلاحات قُلِّصَت جذريا باستقلال سلطة العلماء، كما كان لها تأثير بإعادة ترسيخ نفوذهم بإدماجهم في جهاز الدولة، كما ينص قانون إصلاح العلماء لعام 1961، بتخصيص موارد الدولة لهم، مع أن خزينة المال كانت خارج سيطرة الأزهر، في حين سعى جمال عبد الناصر إلى إخضاع العلماء تحت الدولة، لم يسمح بالمزيد من الاقتراحات المتطرفة للحد من نفوذ الأزهر. مثل اقتراح طه حسين في عام 1955. حيث سعى حسين إلى تفكيك نظام الأزهر للتعليم الابتدائي والثانوي وتحويل الجامعة إلى كلية للشريعة ضمن النظام التعليمي الحديث، وقد عارضه العلماء على هذه الخطة، على الرغم من أن خيار عبد الناصر للحفاظ على مركز الأزهر يرجع إلى اعتبارات سياسية شخصية، مثل استخدام الأزهر بمنح الشرعية للنظام، وتجتب معارضة العلماء.\n\nوأصبح الأزهر في هذه الفترة بشكل كامل كذراع للحكومة، ثم استخدم لتبرير تصرفات الحكومة. على الرغم من أن العلماء كانوا قد أصدروا في وقت سابق أن الاشتراكية لا يمكنها أن تتوافق مع الإسلام، لكن بعد الثورة والاستصلاح الزراعي، أصدر علماء الأزهر أحكامًا جديدة تتوافق مع عبد الناصر مع تبريرها دينيًا وسموها الاشتراكية الإسلامية، وأصبح استخدام العلماء بمثابة قوة موازية لجماعة الإخوان المسلمين، والحد من النفوذ الوهابي في المملكة العربية السعودية، وألقى باللائمة في محاولة اغتيال ناصر على جماعة الإخوان المسلمين وحُظِرَت، وقد احتاج عبد الناصر إلى دعم من العلماء كما أنه بادر باعتقالات جماعية من أعضاء جماعة الإخوان المسلمين،  وعلى إثره خففت بعض القيود المفروضة على الأزهر. وبدورهم أيد علماء الأزهر عبد الناصر في محاولاته لتفكيك جماعة الإخوان المسلمين، واستمر الحال على ذلك في الأنظمة اللاحقة، وعلى الرغم من الجهود المبذولة من الأزهر لتشويه سمعة الإخوان المسلمين، استمرت جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في عملها، كما قدم الأزهر أيضا شرعية للحرب مع الكيان الصهيوني في عام 1967، معلنا الجهاد ضد الكيان الصهيوني.\nبعد وفاة عبد الناصر في عام 1970، وأصبح أنور السادات رئيسا لمصر، وعبَّر السادات عن رغبته باستعادة الأزهر كرمز للقيادة المصرية في جميع أنحاء العالم العربي، قائلا أن: «العالم العربي لا يمكن أن بعمل بدون مصر والأزهر»، وزاد هذا الاعتراف من النفوذ المتزايد لجماعة الإخوان المسلمين، وقد خفف السادات عددا من القيود المفروضة على الإخوان والعلماء ككل. ومع ذلك، أطلقت حملة في سبتمبر 1971 من الصحفيين والمنظمات على السادات وهاجموا مواقفه بشكل مفاجئ، فوضع السادات عقوبات ضد العلماء الذين انتقدوا السياسات الرسمية للدولة. كما واصل استخدام علماء الأزهر كأداة من الحكومة، مما أثار انتقادات بين عدة مجموعات، بما في ذلك الجماعات الإسلامية وغيرها الأكثر اعتدالا، اتهم شكري مصطفى علماء الأزهر بتقديم الأحكام الدينية لغرض وحيد وهو راحة الحكومة، وعندما أقدم السادات لعقد السلام مع إسرائيل، اعتبرته الغالبية العظمى من السكان المصريين خائنًا، وقدَّم الأزهر بيانًا ينص على أن الوقت قد حان لصنع السلام.\nوبعد اغتيال السادات، أصبح حسني مبارك رئيسا لمصر في عام 1981، وواصل الأزهر بمنح الشرعية الدينية لما تمليه الحكومة، وقد أعطى نظام مبارك نتيجة ذلك الاستقلالية إلى الجامع الأزهر وعلمائه، ثم أصبح جاد الحق علي جاد الحق شيخًا للأزهر في الفترة من 1982 حتى وفاته في عام 1996، وقد أكد رغبته باستقلال الأزهر عن الدولة كغيره من علماء الأزهر، وقال جاد الحق أن الحكومة إذا رغبت من الأزهر مكافحة فعالة للجماعة الإسلامية في مصر، يجب عليها أن تعطي للأزهر أكبر قدر من الاستقلالية عن الدولة وأن يكون للأزهر صوتًا لا تتدخل فيه الدولة، وفي عهد مبارك، تنازل عن عدد من سلطات الدولة إلى الأزهر، وخلال بداية التسعينات قُدِّمت تعديلات على قوانين الرقابة الموجودة وأعطي للأزهر القدرة على فرض رقابة على كل المطبوعات والإعلام الإلكتروني. على الرغم من أن القانون ينص على أن الأزهر قد يشارك في كتابة شكوى فقط، على سبيل المثال، أرسلت النصوص التلفزيونية بشكل روتيني إلى الأزهر للموافقة عليها قبل أن تُبث.\nواصل الأزهر عقد مراكز عليا للسلطات الدينية السنية الأخرى في جميع أنحاء العالم، بما أن السنيين يشكلون الأغلبية العظمى من مجموع السكان المسلمين، وقد كان للأزهر تأثير كبير على العالم الإسلامي برمته، بالإضافة إلى كونه السلطة الدينية داخل مصر، وقد طلب من الأزهر استشارات للأحكام الدينية من خارج مصر. فمثلا قبل «حرب الخليج»، طلب فهد بن عبد العزيز ملك المملكة العربية السعودية من شيخ الأزهر بدلاً من مفتي عام المملكة العربية السعودية، فتوى تأذن بتمركز قوات أجنبية داخل المملكة، على الرغم من تواجد اثنين من أقدس الأماكن الإسلامية داخل المملكة العربية السعودية، وفي عام 2003 طلب وزير الداخلية الفرنسي نيكولا ساركوزي إصدار فتوى من الأزهر للسماح للفتيات المسلمات بعدم ارتداء الحجاب في المدارس العامة الفرنسية، على الرغم من وجود «المجلس الفرنسي للإسلام». وقدم شيخ الأزهر بيانًا قائلا فيه أنه في حين أن ارتداء الحجاب واجب إسلامي، فإن المرأة المسلمة في فرنسا ملزمة باحترام واتباع القوانين الفرنسية. وقد تعرض شيخ الأزهر للكثير من الانتقادات داخل مصر، واعتُبرت الفتوى تنازلًا عن المبادئ الإسلامية لإرضاء الحكومة الفرنسية.\n\nبعد عام 2011\nلم يتأثر الأزهر بالثورة المصرية التي شهدت إزالة حسني مبارك كرئيس لمصر عام 2011، وأسفرت انتخابات الحكومة الطلابية في الأشهر التي تلت الثورة في فوز ساحق لجماعة الاخوان المسلمين، بعدها اندلعت احتجاجات تطالب المجلس العسكري الحاكم لمصر باستعادة استقلال المسجد عن الدولة، وقد كُلِّف المسجد نفسه بكتابة مشروع قانون من شأنه منح الأزهر استقلالا أكبر من الحكومة، في غضون ذلك، حل مؤتمر نقاش في الأزهر حول مستقبله ودوره الشرعي داخل الدولة، وقد أدت وجهات النظر المختلفة حول دور الأزهر في المستقبل في مصر تأتي من عدة أحزاب، بما في ذلك المنظمات الإسلامية الرائدة مثل الإخوان المسلمين، والأصوات الليبرالية التي ترغب في رؤية الأزهر يقف كحصن ضد المتطرفين، ويأمل الأزهر أن يصبح مستقلاً تمامًا عن الدولة.\n\nالعمارة\nالهندسة المعمارية للأزهر ترتبط ارتباطًا وثيقا بتاريخ القاهرة. واستخدمت فيها مواد مأخوذة من فترات متعددة من التاريخ المصري، والتي استفادت من أسلوب العمارة الفاطمي في إفريقية، ثم حصل المسجد على إضافات وتوسعات من الحكام الذي تعاقبوا على مصر، فتأثرت عمارة الجامع بأساليب معمارية عدة من داخل وخارج مصر على حد سواء، مُزجت هذه التأثيرات معًا، وظهرت معها أساليب معمارية جديدة كانت مصدر إلهام فيما بعد، مثل القباب التي بُنيت الفترة العثمانية والمآذن التي بناها المماليك.\nبُني المسجد في البداية على شكل قاعة للصلاة مع خمسة ممرات وفناء مركزي متواضع، ومنذ ذلك الحين وُسِّع المسجد عدة مرات مع منشآت إضافية محيطة بالمبنى الأصلي، فأضيفت العديد من المآذن من قبل المماليك، وأضيفت البوابات أثناء الحكم العثماني، واستُبدل المحراب بمحراب جديد، نجت بعض المآذن والقباب الأصلية وظلت حتى الآن، وبعضها أعيد بناؤها عدة مرات.\n\nالعهد الفاطمي\nكان الهيكل الأصلي للجامع الأزهر 280 قدمًا (85 مترًا) في الطول و227 قدمًا (69 مترًا) في العرض، ويتألف من ثلاثة أروقة معمدة تقع حول فناء، وفي جهة الجنوب الشرقي من الفناء، بنيت قاعة الصلاة الأصلية على هيئة بهو معمد، مع خمسة ممرات عميقة، بقياس 260 قدمًا (79 م) في الطول و75 قدمًا (23 م) في العرض، وكان جدار القبلة منحرفًا قليلاً عن الزاوية الصحيحة، وأعيد استخدام الأعمدة الرخامية لدعم الأروقة الأربعة التي تؤدي لقاعة الصلاة من مواقع موجودة في أوقات مختلفة في التاريخ المصري، من العصور الفرعونية مرورًا بالحكم الروماني وحتى الحقبة القبطية، مما أدى إلى اختلاف ارتفاعات مستوى الأعمدة لاستخدامها قواعد متفاوتة السماكة، كما تظهر في الجص تأثيرات من العمارة العباسية والقبطية والبيزنطية.\nوقد بني في النهاية ثلاث قباب، وهي سمة مشتركة بين أوائل المساجد في شمال أفريقيا، ولم ينجُ أيا منها خلال التجديدات التي لحقت بالأزهر، وسجل المؤرخ المقريزي أنه في القبة الأصلية التي بناها الصقلي كتب فيها:\n\nوقد لقي الصقلي رعاية شرفية من المعز، وقد عينه، «سكرتيره الخاص» ويعتبر الصقلي أول شخص يحصل على منصب سكرتير قبل أن يصبح منصب عام.\nالمحراب الأصلي، كشف عنه في عام 1933، لديه شبه قبة فوقه مع عمود من الرخام في كل جانب، وقد كانت الزخارف الجصية المعقدة سمة بارزة في المسجد، فقد كانت كل الجدران والمحراب مزينة بالنقوش، وقد كتب على المحراب مجموعتان من الآيات القرآنية المدرجة في قوقعته، والتي لا تزال سليمة، أول مجموعة من الآيات هي أول ثلاث آيات من سورة المؤمنون:\n\nالمجموعة الثانية من الآيات 162، 163 من سورة الأنعام:\n\nهذه النقوش هي القطعة الوحيدة الباقية من الديكور التي ترجع إلى العهد الفاطمي.\n\nأضيفت الساحة المركزية المعبَّدة من رخام بين 1009 و1010، وأضيفت أيضا الممرات التي تحيط الفناء لها عارضة مقوسة الشكل مع نقوش جصية. وقد بنيت الأقواس في عهد الحافظ لدين الله من الحلي والجص، وقد أعيد بناؤها في عام 1891 باستخدام نوعين من الحلي،  يظهر أعلى مركز القوس الأول ويتكون من رونديل غارق والفصوص الأربعة والعشرين. وأضيفت زمرة دائرية من زخارف نباتية في عام 1893، أما الزخرفة الثانية المستخدمة، التي هي ما بين كل قوس، تتكون من منافذ ضحلة تحت غطاء مخدد تشكل سقف أعمدة متشاركة، والتي تحيط بها مجموعة من الكتابات القرآنية بالخط الكوفي. أضيفت النصوص القرآنية بعد حكم الحافظ خلال الفترة الفاطمية، وتصدرت الجدران على شكل نجمة مع زينة للشرفة على ثلاث مستويات، الممر الجنوبي الشرقي من الفناء يحتوي على المدخل الرئيسي إلى قاعة الصلاة. بوابة تأطير الفارسي، التي قوس مركزها لها ممر مستطيل تفتح إلى قاعة الصلاة.\nرُكِّب باب خشبي جديد ومحراب خشبي جديد في عهد الحاكم بأمر الله في 1009، وفي سنة 1125، شيدت قبة إضافية في عهد الحافظ لدين الله، بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فقد أمر بإنشاء ممر رابع حول الفناء، أما الشرفة فقد بنيت على الطرف الغربي من الصحن.\n\nالإضافات المملوكية\nعين صلاح الدين في البداية وزيرا من طرف أخر الخلفاء الفاطميين العاضد لدين الله الذي كان يثق بصلاح الدين، وانهارت الدولة الفاطمية خلال عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي وسلالته، وقام صلاح الدين الأيوبي في مصر، بالتحالف مع الخلافة العباسية السنية في بغداد، ولعدم ثقته بالأزهر الشيعي تاريخا، خسر المسجد مكانته أثناء فترة حكم صلاح الدين، ومع ذلك، استعاد المسجد مكانته خلال فترة المماليك الذين قاموا بسلسلة من الترميمات والإضافات للمسجد، والإشراف على التوسع السريع في مناهجه التعليمية، ومن بين الترميمات التي قام بها المماليك تعديل المحراب، مع تركيب الرخام الملون لواجهته.\nوفي عام 1339، بنيت قبة ومئذنة لتغطية المدرسة الأقبغاوية، التي تحتوي على قبر الأمير أقبغا عبد الواحد، كانت في البداية مسجدُا قائمًا بذاته ومدرسة، ثم أصبحت مدرسة متكاملة ودُمجت في الجامع الأزهر، أما: المدخل، وجدار القبلة، والفسيفساء والزجاج في المحراب مع القبة الأصلية يرجع تاريخها إلى الفترة العثمانية.\nفي عام 1440، بنيت المدرسة الجوهرية وتحتوي على قبر الأمير جوهر القنقبائي، الذي كان يشغل منصب الخازندار (المشرف على خزائن الأموال السلطانية) أثناء حكم السلطان المملوكي الأشرف سيف الدين برسباي، وكانت أرضية المدرسة من الرخام، والجدران تصطف مع الخزائن، وزينت المطعمة مع خشب الأبنوس والعاج والصدف، وغطيت حجرة القبر بواسطة قبة صغيرة مزخرفة.\n\nالمدرسة الطيبرسية\nوفي عام 1309، بنيت المدرسة الطيبرسية، التي تحتوي على قبر الأمير علاء الدين طيبرس،  وقد بنيت أصلا لتعمل كمسجد مكمل للأزهر ومنذ ذلك الحين دمجت مع بقية المسجد،  ودرست المذاهب المالكية والشافعية في هذه المدرسة، وتستخدم المدرسة الآن للاحتفاظ بالمخطوطات من المكتبة.\nذكر المقريزي أن المدرسة كانت تستخدم فقط لدراسة المذهب الشافعي، في حين أن مؤرخا عن ابن دقماق ذكر أن واحدا من إيوانات المدرسة كان لتعاليم الشافعي حين أن الآخر كان لتعاليم المالكي.\nأعيد بناء المدرسة بالكامل في عهد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، ولم يتبق سوى الجدار الجنوبي الشرقي والمحراب وهي القطع الوحيدة الأصلية الباقية من عهد الأمير علاء الدين طيبرس،  والمحراب بقياس 1.13 مترا في العرض و76 سم في العمق. وعلى كل جانب من المحراب يقف عمود من الحجر السماقي بارتفاع 2.78 متر (9.1 قدم). وتوجد فوق الأعمدة رسمات مزخرفة بأشكال هندسية ملونة، وأضيفت نصف قبة في أعلى المحراب داخل القوس الخارجي، ويحيط بهذا إطار خارجي مستطيل، ويعتبر هذا المحراب الأول في مصر الذي استخدم هذا النوع من الإطار،  وقد وصف المؤرخ كريزويل هذا المحراب بأنه «واحدة من أرقى التحف المعمارية في القاهرة.»\n\nمئذنة قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنة قايتباي في عام 1483، وهي على شكل عمود أسطواني ينقسم إلى جزئين مثمنين، ومئذنة قايتباي تتكون من ثلاث شرفات، تدعمها مقرنصات، وشكل سقفها معقود الهوابط الذي يوفر الانتقال السلس من سطح مستو لمنحني واحد، وسجل أول استخدام له في مصر في 1085، الجزء السفلي مثمن، زُين بلوحات عارضة مقوسة من كل جانب، مع مجموعة من ثلاثة أعمدة لتفصل كل لوحة، أما المنطقة الوسطى أيضا مثمنة فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفة زينت بضفر، الشرفة الثانية تفصل هذا الجزء مع جزء أسطواني في نهاية المئذنة، وزينت بأربعة أقواس. فوق هذا توجد الشرفة الثالثة، التي توجد في أعلى جزء من المئذنة.\nويعتقد أن المئذنة أقيمت في موضع مئذنة الطوب الفاطمية، التي أعيد بناؤها عدة مرات. الحسابات المعاصرة تشير إلى أن المئذنة الفاطمية كان بها عيوب عند بنائها، ويلزم إعادة بنائها عدة مرات، فقد أُعيد بناؤها تحت إشراف صدر الدين الأذرعي الدمشقي الحنفي، وهو قاضي القضاة خلال فترة حكم «السلطان بيبرس»، وقد أُعيد بناؤها مرة أخرى خلال عهد برقوق في 1397، وقد بدأت المئذنة تميل بزاوية خطرة، وأعيد بناؤها في عام 1414 بأمر من تاج الدين الشاوباكي، والي ومحتسب القاهرة، وبنيت مئذنة قايتباي في موقعها اليوم، كجزء من إعادة بناء مدخل المسجد في عام 1432.\n\nباب الجندي\nيقع باب الجندي (باب قايتباي) مباشرة بعد فناء مدخل باب المزينين، ويؤدي بدوره إلى الباحة الرئيسية من قاعة الصلاة، وقد بني عام 1495.\n\nمئذنة الغوري\nبنيت المئذنة مزدوجة الرؤوس في عام 1509 في عهد قنصوة الغوري، وتقع على قاعدة مربعة، الجزء السفلي منها مثمن، وقد قوست جوانبه الأربعة بعارضات زخرفية، وفصل عن جوانبيه بعمودين، أما المنطقة الوسطى فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفات مكعبة تدعمه مقرنصات، وهو على شكل مثمن زُيِّن بالقيشاني الأزرق، ويتكون الجزء العلوي من عمودين مستطيلين مع الأقواس على شكل حدوة حصان على كل جانب منها توجد مهاوي. ويعلو الجزء العلوي مربع يحمل اثنين من الرؤوس كمثرية الشكل تحمل كل منها هلالاً نحاسيًّا.\n\nالتجديدات العثمانية والإضافات\nقُدمت عدة إضافات وترميمات خلال عهد الخلافة العثمانية في مصر، وأنجز الكثير منها تحت إشراف عبد الرحمن كتخدا الذي ضاعف تقريبا حجم المسجد، وأضاف ثلاث بوابات وهي:\n\nباب المزينين، الذي أصبح المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد.\nباب الشربة.\nباب الصعايدة.\nوأضاف كتخدا عدة أروقة، بما في ذلك واحدة للطلاب المكفوفين من الأزهر، كما أضاف قاعة صلاة إضافية جنوب القاعة الفاطمية الأصلية، مع محراب إضافي، لمضاعفة مساحة قاعة الصلاة الإجمالية.\n\nباب المزينين\nهو أكبر وأهم الأبواب الثمانية للجامع الأزهر وهو المدخل الرئيسي للجامع، وسبب تسميته بهذا الاسم أن المزينين كانوا يجلسون أمامه من أجل حلق رؤوس المجاورين، وهو نموذج للعمارة العثمانية في القاهرة، ويعود الفضل لبنائه إلى عبد الرحمن كتخدا عام 1753. كان يحتوي على مئذنة قائمة بذاتها خارج البوابة بناها كتخدا، وقد هدمت المئذنة قبل افتتاح شارع الأزهر من قبل توفيق باشا خلال جهود التحديث التي وقعت في جميع أنحاء القاهرة.\n\nالتخطيط الحالي والهيكل\nالمدخل الرئيسي الحالي إلى المسجد هو باب المزينين، وهو أحد أبواب الأزهر والذي يؤدي إلى فناء من الرخام الأبيض في الجهة المقابلة من قاعة الصلاة الرئيسية، إلى الشمال الشرقي من باب المزينين، نجد الفناء المحيط بواجهة المدرسة الأقبغاوية؛ وفي جنوب غرب نهاية الفناء نجد المدرسة الطيبرسية،  ومباشرة عبر الفناء من مدخل باب المزينين نجد باب الجندي (بوابة قايتباي)، الذي بني عام 1495، ويقف فوق مئذنة قايتباي، ومن خلال هذه البوابة نجد موقع باحة قاعة الصلاة. وقد غير المحراب مؤخرا إلى رخام عادي مواجه مع نقوش ذهبية.\n\nشيخ الأزهر\nشيخ الأزهر يُسمى كذلك «الإمام الأكبر» هو أعلى منصب في هيكل إدارة الجامع، وقد كان النظام المتبع أن ينتخب من بين كبار العلماء، وقد أنشئ منصب شيخ الجامع الأزهر في عهد الحكم العثماني ليتولى رئاسة علمائه، ويشرف على شؤونه الإدارية، ويحافظ على الأمن والنظام بالأزهر.\nوشيوخ الأزهر بالترتيب الزمني هم:\n\nالتكريم\nنظراً للقيمة الأثرية والتاريخية للجامع الأزهر، وكنوع من تسليط الضوء على أحد المعالم المصرية العريقة، فقد تم تزيين وجه العملة الورقية المصرية فئة خمسون قرشاً برسم صورة الجامع الأزهر في أكثر من إصدار، بينما يحمل ظهر الورقة الحالية صورة لتمثال رمسيس الثاني.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر

          "content": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and early history\nThe mosque was commissioned by Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Abbasid governor of Egypt from 868 to 884. He was able to establish himself as a de facto autonomous ruler over Egypt and parts of the Levant. In 870, he began construction on a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i. It was located a short distance to the northwest of Fustat (the first Muslim capital of Egypt and its main city) and al-'Askar (the second capital built nearby by the Abbasids).\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque was built to serve as al-Qata'i's congregational mosque. It was the third congregational mosque to be built in what is now Cairo, after the Mosque of 'Amr and the main mosque of al-'Askar. The medieval historian al-Maqrizi states that its construction started in 876 CE, while an original inscription slab found in the mosque identifies the date of completion as Ramadan 265 AH, corresponding to April–May 879 CE. According to Balawi, a 10th-century author, the architect of the mosque was a man named al-Nasrani, a non-Muslim, possibly Christian, who had previously designed the Aqueduct of Basatin, another of Ibn Tulun's construction projects in the area.\nThe mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, \"The Hill of Thanksgiving.\" One local legend says that it is here that Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat. Ibn Tulun's administrative palace, the Dar al-Imara, adjoined the mosque directly on its southeastern side, behind the qibla wall. Ibn Tulun was able to enter his mosque directly from the Dar al-Imara via a doorway that can still be seen to the right of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla).\nAl-Qata'i was eventually razed to the ground in 905 by the Abbasid general Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who was sent to retake control of Egypt. Only the mosque and the adjoining Dar al-Imara were left standing. The mosque was spared because of its religious function while the palace was re-used by the subsequent Ikhshidid governors as an administrative center. Today, the mosque is the only surviving monument of this city.\n\nLater history\nThe mosque and the palace continued to see some use during the Fatimid period (after 969) and the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz is recorded as having ordered some construction in the mosque in 1132, though it is unclear what work was done. The original fountain (fawara) in the center of the mosque's courtyard, which had previously burned down, was rebuilt on the orders of Caliph al-'Aziz in 995. The mosque and the area around it declined further in the following century. Part of the mosque was burned during riots in 1067. Badr al-Jamali (d. 1094), the powerful Fatimid vizier, restored the mosque, as indicated by the inscription he placed above what is still the main entrance to the mosque today. Badr al-Jamali's son and successor, al-Afdal Shahinshah, added a flat stucco mihrab to one of the prayer hall's piers in 1094.\n\nBy the 12th century, the mosque was being used as a caravanserai for North African pilgrims on their way to the Hijaz. After the assassination of the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–1293), one of the accomplices in the murder, Lajin, hid inside the mosque, by which time the building had fallen into ruin. Mamluk-era writers report that Lajin hid inside the ruins of the original minaret, spent a miserable year there, and vowed that if God saved him and allowed him to become sultan he would restore the mosque. When he later became sultan (r. 1296–1299), he fulfilled this pledge and initiated a major restoration of the mosque in 1296. Lajin's works, many of which remain today, included renovating the main mihrab's decoration, building the dome in front of it, adding a new wooden minbar (pulpit), renovating the minaret, and building the present-day fountain in the center of the courtyard and the domed structure over it.\nIn 1524, a zawiya (Sufi convent) and tomb were built next to the minaret and are mentioned by historical sources as associated with a founder named either Sheikh Sharaf al-Din al-Madini or Sheikh al-Bushi. Its ruined remains were demolished in 1943.\nAt some point during the reign of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century, the mosque was turned into a military hospital and then a salt warehouse. A blacksmith workshop was also installed in it. In 1846, Clot Bey received permission from Muhammad Ali to convert it into a mental asylum and sometime after this it became a poorhouse. During the conversion, Clot Bey ordered some of the arches around the mosque's courtyard to be walled up, an act which was criticized as vandalism by some 19th-century writers who visited the site afterwards.\n\nAs a result of these different uses, the building deteriorated severely in the 19th century  Some of the arches of the prayer hall along the courtyard façade collapsed in 1877. The mosque continued to be neglected in this manner until 1880, when architect Julius Franz Pasha, the head of the government's Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe ('Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of Arab Art'), closed the building and evicted its inhabitants. After this, it was examined by the Comité and assessed for repairs. Damage to the ceiling, arches, and minbar were all reported, among other problems. Recommendations were made to remove the walls blocking the arches and demolish the ad hoc structures that had been constructed inside the mosque by its poor inhabitants.\n\nAfter another examination in 1890, the Comité began restoration work. Various works were undertaken over the following years, though not enough to resolve all problems. The ceiling over the prayer hall continued to progressively fall apart, along with its arches facing the courtyard. A major event was the visit of King Fuad I, who attended Friday prayers in the mosque on 3 May 1918, the first ruler of Egypt to do so since Sultan Lajin. He subsequently took an interest in the mosque's maintenance and ordered the expropriation and removal of structures encroaching on it. In the following decade, efforts continued to remove encroaching structures and clear rubble. The Comité finally reconstructed the mosque's ceiling in 1927 and in the following two years it reconstructed the damaged arches of the prayer hall. Repair works continued intermittently after this, including the reconstruction of the westernmost walls of the ziyada (outer enclosure) from 1947 to 1948.\n\nThe Comité was dissolved in 1961 and the mosque, like other Islamic-era monuments in Cairo, was neglected for a time after this. Restoration efforts were resumed in 1978 by the government's Egyptian Antiquities Organization. While the mosque did not suffer greatly from the 1992 Cairo earthquake, the top of the minaret was damaged and its integrity compromised, which elicited the installation of scaffolding to support it.\n\nThe mosque underwent a full restoration from 2002 to 2004, which cost 2.5 million US dollars. One of the significant changes to the mosque's appearance was the paving of the entire courtyard with stone, as it had previously been largely unpaved. This had the negative side effect of causing humidity to accumulate along the walls, which were then injected with a consolidant. This action and other aspects of the restoration project were questioned and criticized by some scholars of Islamic architecture, including Caroline Williams.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque is the oldest mosque in Egypt to largely retain its original form. Its architectural style is closely modeled on that of the Abbasid capital of the time, Samarra, where Ibn Tulun had spent much of his early career before being sent to Egypt. As a result, the mosque is one of the best surviving examples of the Abbasid architectural style of this period, which was dominated by the influence of Samarra. The mosque is one of the largest in Egypt by area: including its outer enclosure (ziyada), it occupies 26,318 square metres (283,280 sq ft). It is built primarily out of brick, except for the minaret, which is built of stone.\n\nExterior\nAn outer enclosure, the ziyada, surrounds the mosque on three sides and provided a buffer between the prayer space and the surrounding urban environment. The mosque's minaret stands in this enclosure on the northwest side. Originally, the mosque's ziyada contained ablutions facilities, latrines, and a medical clinic. The outer walls of the ziyada were likely adjoined by shops and neighbourhood markets. In the early 20th century, any market structures that were still adjoining the outer walls were removed.\n\nThe mosque had a total of twenty-two entrances: nineteen entrances through the ziyada (with doorways in the outer wall corresponding to doorways into the mosque proper) and another three doorways in the qibla (southeastern) wall. Only one entrance is used by visitors today. Unlike in later Egyptian mosques, none of the entrances are given architectural prominence, as this was not a feature of mosque architecture in Egypt until the later Fatimid period. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque are both topped by decorative crenellations consisting of brick openwork whose form, vaguely reminiscent of linked human figures, is likely derived from the decorative motifs inside the mosque.\n\nInterior\nOn the inside, the mosque consists of a spacious central courtyard (sahn) surrounded on four sides by roofed halls or galleries (riwaqs) divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches supported on piers. On the qibla side, this roofed area forms the main prayer hall and is five aisles deep, while the other three wings around the courtyard are two aisles deep. The arches and piers are built of brick and uphold a wooden roof built with palm. The corners of the piers are rounded by engaged columns. The upper parts of the piers, between the arches, are pierced with pointed windows that have their own colonettes.\nA dikka (raised platform for muezzins and Qur'an reciters) is located between two piers in the center of the prayer hall. It most likely dates to the Mamluk period. Next to the main mihrab (the concave niche in the qibla wall) is a wooden minbar, a pulpit for the imam, consisting of a wooden staircase leading to small kiosk-like structure topped by a curving finial. The inscription on the minbar attributes it to Sultan Lajin and dates it to 1296. It is an excellent example of early Mamluk-period woodwork.\n\nDecoration and inscriptions\nThe outlines of the arches, their intrados (undersides), and the capitals of the engaged columns are covered with carved stucco decoration, although only the arches of the southwestern side still preserve most of their intrados decoration. This decoration features geometric and floral patterns. They are derived from the Abbasid style associated with Samarra in this period, particularly those known to scholars as the \"Samarra B\" and \"Samarra C\" styles. Originally, this stucco decoration would have been painted in vivid colours, but the paint has since faded away. On the courtyard façades, the windows between the arches are also flanked by decorative rosettes. \nThe 128 windows of the mosque are also outlined with similar stucco decoration and are covered by stucco grilles. The window grilles seen today have a variety of geometric designs and date from different periods and restorations. Three or four of them are still original, from Ibn Tulun's time, and feature the simplest designs. The rest, with more complex designs, are from later restorations, including at least six from the Mamluk restoration of 1296.\n\nA long inscription on a wooden frieze runs just below the ceiling around the walls of the entire mosque, although much of it has disappeared over time and the frieze is now fragmented throughout the mosque. The inscription is carved in Kufic letters and is nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long in total. It replicates verses from the Qur'an, totaling to around one fifteenth of the entire book. The inscription is unusual for its time and it makes the Ibn Tulun Mosque the oldest surviving Islamic monument to contain religious inscriptions of such length.\n\nMihrabs (prayer niches)\nThe mosque contains six mihrabs (niches symbolizing the qibla or direction of prayer) at the mosque, five of which are flat as opposed to the main niche, which is concave. The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It dates from the Tulunid period but was redecorated under Sultan Lajin. The carved stucco decoration around the niche still dates from the Tulunid period, as do the pairs of marble columns with Coptic-style capitals on either side of the niche. Above the niche is a wooden frieze carved with a Kufic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim declaration of faith) followed by a blessing. Above this is a panel of wood with traces of faded painted decoration. The decoration inside the niche dates from Sultan Lajin's restoration. The upper zone is made of painted wood whose decoration has deteriorated, while the lower zone is covered in marble paneling that is characteristic of Mamluk decoration. In between these two zones is a wide band of glass mosaic containing an inscription of the Shahada in Naskhi script.\nThe other mihrabs in the prayer hall, all flat instead of concave, are the following:\n\nThe same qibla wall also features a smaller stucco mihrab to the left of the main niche. Its muqarnas sculpting and Naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin.\nThe two mihrabs on the piers flanking the dikka are decorated in the Samarran style, with one containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kufic Shahada inscriptions on both do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shi'a Fatimids came to power.\nThe westernmost mihrab, installed by al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with influences from Persia. The Kufic inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, on whose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shi'a Shahada including Ali as God's wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.\nOn the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdal's mihrab. It differs, however, by referring to Sultan Lajin instead of al-Mustansir, and a lack of Ali's name.\n\nFountain\nIn the center of the courtyard is a fountain (fisqiya) used for ablutions. It is sheltered by a square kiosk that is open through arches on all four sides, built in stone, and covered by a dome, built in brick. This dates to the restoration of Sultan Lajin in 1296, confirmed by a wooden inscription (now partially faded) in an upper corner on the outer wall of the kiosk. \nThe original Tulunid fountain of the mosque, referred to as a fawwāra, was covered by a dome resting on ten columns and surrounded by another sixteen columns. The columns were made of gilded marble. This structure burned down, most likely in the late 10th century, before it was replaced by another.\nThe present-day fountain consists of an octagonal stone basin on the floor. It was formerly surrounded by a marble floor which has since been replaced by modern pavement. The squinches inside the dome are executed in muqarnas (\"stalactite\"-style sculpting). Above the muqarnas is an inscription band carved in stucco containing part of Surah 4:43 from the Qur'an. At the apex of the dome is a circular medallion of carved stucco containing another inscription, of Surah 5:6. The outer walls of the kiosk were crowned by stepped crenellations that have disappeared.\nInside the northeastern wall, which is thicker than the others, is a small staircase that once led to a small room built on top of the wall, at the same level as the drum of the dome. This room, of unclear purpose and origin, could still be seen in 19th-century photos but was removed in the early 20th century. A sundial that once existed in the kiosk, mentioned in Sultan Lajin's inscription and recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, may have been associated with this room. This feature suggests that the room was intended for use by the timekeeper of the mosque.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret is unusual in form. It consists of a rectangular (cuboid) shaft at the base, followed by a cylindrical section. An external staircase wraps around both sections in a spiral fashion. The shaft is crowned by a lantern-like summit, sometimes described as a mabkhara, with a ribbed dome. The tower is connected to the wall of the mosque by a bridge with horseshoe arches.\nThere is scholarly controversy over the construction date of the minaret. Historical records attest that the original minaret built under Ibn Tulun had an external staircase, which recalls the design of the helicoidal or spiral minarets in Abbasid Samarra (such as the Malwiya). The minarets of Samarra were thus probably the inspiration for its design. At least one historical source, Ibn Duqmaq, claimed that the staircase was wide enough to accommodate two camels. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his officials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his finger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing his minaret. Architectural historian Tarek Swelim argues that the original minaret was probably aligned with the central axis of the building, like other Abbasid minarets from the 9th century, instead of the current tower's location.\n\nMany of the architectural features in the current structure, however, point to a later construction. The design of the minaret's top level, in the characteristic mabkhara-style, is of early Mamluk style, while the horseshoe arches and corbels look to be of 13th-century Andalusi inspiration. The fact that it is built of stone instead of brick is inconsistent with the rest of the mosque. Moreover, the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time.\nArchitectural historians have drawn varying conclusions. K. A. C. Creswell argued that the entire structure of the present minaret is a reconstruction by Mamluk sultan Lajin from the 1296 restoration and that it was inspired by the original Tulunid spiral minaret. Jonathan Bloom suggests that the original minaret may have disappeared by the second half of the 12th century and that it was rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century. Doris Behrens-Abouseif argues that the structure instead shows evidence of multiple construction phases and that the original Tulunid minaret mostly survived but was then restored by Sultan Lajin, who added some of the present-day elements. She notes that the main shaft does not resemble any Mamluk-era minarets and that this would be unlikely if Lajin had rebuilt it completely. She also points out that one 10th-century source, al-Muqaddasi, states that the Tulunid minaret was indeed built of stone and notes that no sources mention its demolition or disappearance. Tarek Swelim suggests that the original minaret was damaged and at some point was replaced by a minaret with the present-day rectangular base, built next to the original. He suggests that the circular portion of the shaft was perhaps added during the Ayyubid period (late 12th to early 13th centuries) and then the top level was added by Lajin.\nHistorical sources and early 19th-century illustrations indicate that the minaret was previously topped by an unusual copper finial in the shape of a boat. This finial was possibly replaced by a similar one at some point before the 1840s but it must have disappeared sometime between 1800, when it was last noted, and 1892, when it was replaced by a crescent-shaped finial.\n\nAdjacent structures\nAt the southwestern corner of the mosque, standing within the ziyada, is a sabil-maktab or sabil-kuttab (structure combining a sabil and maktab). This structure has been attributed to either Sultan Lajin in 1296 or to Sultan Qaytbay between 1462 and 1482. Tarek Swelim suggests that it was most likely built first by Lajin and then restored by Qaytbay. \nAt the southeastern corner of the mosque, located outside the ziyada and on the site of the former Dar al-Imara, is a pair of historic mansions, connected by a bridge, which became known as Bayt al-Kritliya. They were built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The complex now serves as the Gayer-Anderson Museum. Another structure outside the ziyada, adjoining its outer wall on the northwest side, is the Madrasa of Amir Sarghatmish, built around 1350.\n\nIn popular culture\nParts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the mosque. The mosque is featured in the game Serious Sam 3: BFE, forming a significant part of the game's third level. It is also featured in a level of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation.\n\nThe front of the Egyptian five-pound banknote has been adorned with an illustration of the Ibn Tulun Mosque in multiple editions. Meanwhile, the back of the current banknote features an image of a Pharaonic painting.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nBehrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989).

          "summary": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.",

          "content": "مسجد ابن طولون أو مسجد أحمد بن طولون أو المسجد الطولوني هو أحد المساجد الأثريّة الشهيرة بالقاهرة. أمر ببناؤه أحمد بن طولون مؤسس الدولة الطولونية سنة 263هـ/877م بمدينته الجديدة القطائع ليصبح ثالث مسجد جامع بني في عاصمة مصر الإسلامية بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي بني في الفسطاط، وجامع العسكر الذي بني في مدينة العسكر ورغم أن مسجد عمرو بن العاص لا يزال موجودًا إلا أن المسجد الطولوني يعد أقدم مساجد مصر القائمة حتى الآن لاحتفاظه بحالته الأصلية بالمقارنة مع مسجد عمرو بن العاص الذي توالت عليه الإصلاحات التي غيرت معالمه.\nشُيد المسجد فوق ربوة صخرية كانت تعرف بجبل يشكر، ويُعتبر من المساجد المعلقة، وهو أحد أكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات الخارجية حوالي ستة أفدنة ونصف الفدان، وقد بُني على شكل مربع مستلهمًا من طرز المساجد العباسية وخاصة مسجد سامراء بالعراق الذي استلهم منه المنارة الملوية. يقع المسجد حاليًا بميدان أحمد بن طولون بحي السيدة زينب التابع للمنطقة الجنوبية بالقاهرة، ويجاور سوره الغربي مسجد صرغتمش الناصري فيما يجاور سوره الشرقي متحف جاير أندرسون.\n\nالمنشئ\nمنشئ المسجد هو أحمد بن طولون مؤسس الدولة الطولونية في مصر والشام، تعود أصوله إلى قبيلة التغزغز التركية، وكانت أُسرته تقيم في بخاري. كان والده «طولون» مملوكًا لنوح بن أسد الساماني عامل بخارى وخراسان، فأرسله هدية إلى الخليفة المأمون مع من أُرسل من المماليك الترك سنة 200هـ/816م. واسم طولون مشتق من كلمة تركية (بالتركية: Tolun) معناها البدر الكامل. أنجب طولون عددًا من الأبناء من بينهم أحمد الذي يكنى بأبي العباس سنة 220هـ/835م وولد في بغداد بالعراق من جارية تدعى قاسم، فنشأ مختلفًا عن أقرانه من أولاد العجم، حريصًا على الابتعاد عن جو العبث واللهو والمنكرات، واشتهر بالتقوى والصلاح والشدة والقوة والبأس. أرسله الوزير عبيد الله بن يحيى بن خاقان إلى ثغر طرسوس فقضى فيه عدة سنوات أخذ خلالها العلم والحديث والآداب عن كبار العلماء. بدأ بزوغ نجم أحمد بن طولون عندما كان في العشرين من عمره بعد وفاة والده سنة 240هـ/854م، حيث فوض إليه الخليفة العباسي المتوكل ما كان لأبيه من الأعمال العسكرية.\n\nبعد مقتل الخليفة المستعين وتولية المعتز، وُلي بايكباك التركي على مصر ولكن لرغبته في البقاء قريبًا من عاصمة الخلافة أناب أحمد بن طولون عنه في أمور الحكم لما عرف عنه من رجاحة العقل وحسن السيرة ولقرابته منه، فدخل ابن طولون مصر سنة 254هـ/868م. ورغم وشاة مراكز القوى في مصر التي كانت توزع عليها سلطة الحكم بأحمد بن طولون عند الخليفة، إلا أنه ظل في سدة الحكم باستخدام سياسة بذل المال لأولي الأمر في بغداد، كما كان يدعمه حلفاؤه من القادة الترك المُهيمنين على مقدرات الخلافة مثل بايكباك ويارجوخ. بدأ أحمد بن طولون في تدعيم أواصل حكمه في مصر، فتخلص من بعض أعدائه وأضعف البعض الآخر وكان على رأسهم ابن المدبر وشقير الحاجب، وساعدته الظروف السياسية في بغداد على الوصول إلى مراده حيث قتل بايكباك سنة 256هـ/870م وخلفه يارجوخ واليًا على مصر، الذي أناب بدوره ابن طولون على الحكم، ولما توفي يارجوخ سنة 259هـ/873م، ولى الخليفة المعتمد ابن طولون حكم مصر، وفي سنة 263هـ/877م قلده المعتمد أمر خراج مصر وإمرة الثغور الشَامية، فأضحى السيد الأوحد للديار المصرية والمشرف على جميع أمورها، وقام بِضرب الدينار الأحمدي رمزًا لهذا الاستقلال، وامتدت حدود دولته من ليبيا إلى حدود الدولة البيزنطية في آسيا الصغرى، ومن نهر الفرات إلى شلال النيل الأول. كان ابن طولون رجل دولة من الطراز الأول ذو كفاءة إدارية وعسكرية، فعني بشئون دولته ووضع أسس تحويلها إلى دولة قوية، وشملت إصلاحاته سائر شئون الدولة المختلفة، فبنى مدينة القطائع وشيد القصور والمستشفيات والملاجئ وقناطر المياه، وشجع الزراعة وأصلح السدود والترع والقنوات، وحفر الجديد منها، وحمى الفلاحين من ظلم جباة الضرائب وأصلح مقياس النيل بالروضة. كما ازدهرت في عهده الصناعة، فاشتهرت مصر بصناعة النسيج. وأنشأ كذلك مسجده المعروف الذي لا يزال شاهدًا على ازدهار عصر بانيه. أدى نجاحه في إدارة شئون البلاد إلى انتشار الرخاء والعمار والعدل بين الرعية. وتوفي أحمد بن طولون سنة 270هـ/884م وخلفه على الحكم ابنه خمارويه ودفن بمدافن الطولونيين بالقرافة الصغرى بالقرب من بابها بسفح المقطم.\n\nالمهندس\nاختلف المؤرخون حول شخصية مهندس المسجد، فرجح بعضهم أنه كان نصرانيًا يدعى سعيد بن كاتب الفرغاني، وأنه كان مهندس عينًا للماء طلب بنائها ابن طولون فلما أتمها دعا ابن طولون لزيارتها ولسوء حظه كان بموضع البناء جيرًا لا زال رطبًا غاصت به قدم فرس ابن طولون فكبا به فظن أنه أراد به سوءًا، فأمر بجلده وسجنه، وظل بمحبسه حتى أراد ابن طولون بناء الجامع فقُدر له ثلاثمائة عمود صعب تدبيرها إلا عبر استخدام أعمدة الكنائس والأديرة المتخربة، فتورع ابن طولون عن ذلك، ولما بلغ النصراني في محبسه الخبر كتب لابن طولون أنه يبنيه له كما يحب ويختار بلا أعمدة إلا عمودي القبلة، فأخرجه ابن طولون وأحضر له جلودًا للرسم، فصور له النصراني المسجد فأُعجب به واستحسنه، وأطلق سراحه وخلع عليه ورصد له مائة ألف دينار لنفقة البناء وكل ما يحتاج بعد ذلك، فوضع النصراني يده في البناء في موضع جبل يشكر، فلما أتم البناء وراح ابن طولون لزيارة المسجد، صعد النصراني إلى المنارة صائحًا بابن طولون بطلب الجائزة والأمان خوفًا من أن يجري له ما جرى في المرة الأولى، فأمنه ابن طولون وكافأه بعشرة آلاف دينار وخلع عليه وأجرى له رزقاً واسعاً. أما المجموعة الأخرى من المؤرخين فيرجحون أن المهندس لم يكن نصرانياً بل كان عراقيًا بسبب تأثر مصمم المسجد بتصميم مسجد سامراء بالعراق، وعدم استخدام الأساطين أو الأعمدة الرخامية في البناء بل استُخدم بدلًا من ذلك العقود القائمة على دعائم من الآجر. ورجح بعضهم أن المهندس هو أحمد بن محمد الحاسب الذي قدم من العراق لبناء مقياس النيل الجديد بالروضة.\n\nالتاريخ\nلما أسس أحمد بن طولون مدينته القطائع سنة 256هـ/870م كي تكون مدينة خاصة به وبحاشيته وجنده، بعد أن ضاقت عليهم الفسطاط والعسكر، وكرمز لاستقلاله عن الدولة العباسية، وكما كان معهودًا في ذلك الوقت بأن المسجد الجامع هو مركز العواصم الإسلامية، فقد شيد بن طولون مسجده الضخم بالقطائع، وذُكر أن من أسباب بناء الجامع هو ضيق جامع مدينة العسكر بالمصلين، فبدئ في بناء المسجد سنة 263هـ/877م وانتهى البناء في سنة 265هـ/879م، ورصد لبناء المسجد مائة ألف دينار ولكن بلغت تكلفته عند الانتهاء منه مائة وعشرون ألف دينار كان مصدرها كنز عثر عليه بن طولون في الجبل.\nلما أُتمت عمارة المسجد نُقل إليه القراء والفقهاء وصلى فيه القاضي بكار بن قتيبة، ودرس فيه الربيع بن سليمان حديث «من بنى لله مسجدً ولو كمفحص قطاة بنى الله له بيتًا في الجنة»، وتصدق بن طولون بصدقات عظيمة وأطعم الفقراء والمساكين، وقد تقرب الناس بالصلاة فيه وألزم أولادهم صلاة الجمعة في فوارة الجامع ثم يخرجون بعد الصلاة إلى مجلس الربيع بن سليمان ليكتبوا العلم ومع كل واحد وراق وعدة غلمان. وعرف الجامع في القرن الرابع الهجري/العاشر الميلادي بـ«الجامع الفوقاني»، تمييزًا له عن «الجامع السفلاني» وهو جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط.\nلما فشلت مؤامرة قتل السلطان الأشرف خليل بن قلاوون، التي شارك الأمير حسام الدين لاجين في تدبيرها، هرب لاجين ولوحق فتخفى بالمسجد، ونذر إلى الله إن نجا من هذه المحنة أن يعمرن المسجد، فتحقق مراده وجلس على عرش مصر، فأبر بنذره وأكمل إصلاح المسجد من كل وجه سنة 696هـ/1296م، ورتب فيه دروسًا للفقه على المذاهب الأربعة، ودرسًا في تفسير القرآن الكريم، ودرسًا في الحديث النبوي، ودرسًا في الطب، ورتب للمسجد خطيبًا ومؤذنين وفراشين وقرر لهم رواتب، وعمل بجواره مكتبًا لإقراء أيتام المسلمين القرآن الكريم، ومنذ إجراء تلك التجديدات أصبح يلي نظارة المسجد قاضي القضاة، وكان أول من ولي نظارته قاضي القضاة بدر الدين بن جماعة. وفي سنة 767هـ جدد الأمير يلبغا الخاصكي العمري درسًا بالمسجد فيه سبعة مدرسين للحنفية، وقرر لكل فقيه من الطلبة في الشهر أربعين درهماً وأردب قمح.\n\nقصص حول المسجد\nلما أمعن أحمد بن طولون في الصحراء غاصت قدم فرس أحمد غلمانه في الرمال فسقط الغلام فوقف بن طولون ونظر فوجد فتق مكان قدم الفرس ففتح فأصاب فيه من المال ما بلغ مقداره ألف ألف دينار وهو ما سمي «المطلب» الذي شاع خبره، وكتب به إلى الخليفة المعتمد في بغداد يستأذنه فيما يصرفه فيه من وجوه البر، فبنى منه «البيمارستان»، ثم أًصاب بعده في الجبل مالًا عظيمًا «الكنز» فبنى منه الجامع، وأوقف جميع ما بقي من المال في الصدقات.\nلما مر أحمد بن طولون على المسجد أثناء بنائه في رمضان، فرأي العمال يشتغلون إلى وقت الغروب، فسأل متى يشتري هؤلاء الضعفاء إفطار لأولادهم، وأمر بصرفهم وقت العصر، فاتخذ هذا سنة من وقتها.\nلما أتم بناء المسجد رأى أحمد بن طولون في منامه كأن الله تعالى قد تجلى للقصور التي حول المسجد ولم يتجلى للمسجد، فسأل المعبرين، فقالوا: يخرب ما حوله ويبقى قائمًا وحده، فقال: من أين لكم هذا، قالوا: من قوله تعالى: ﴿فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًَّا﴾ [الأعراف:143]، وقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: إذا تجلى الله لشئ خضع له.\nلما فرغ أحمد بن طولون من بناء المسجد أمر حاشيته بسماع ما يقول الناس فيه من الأقوال والعيوب، فقال رجل: محرابه صغير، وقال آخر: ما فيه عمود، وقال آخر: ليست له ميضأة، فبلغه ذلك فجمع الناس وقال: أما المحراب فأني رأيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقد خطه لي في منامي، وأصبحت فرأيت النمل قد طافت بذلك المكان الذي خطه لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وأما العمد فأني بنيت هذا الجامع من مال حلال وهو الكنز، وما كنت لأشوبه بغيره، وهذه العمد إما أن تكون في مسجد أو كنيسه فنزهته عنها، وأما الميضأة فإني نظرت فوجدت ما يكون بها من النجاسات فطهرته عنها، وها أنا ابنيها خلفه وأمر ببنائها.\nلما فرغ أحمد بن طولون من بناء الجامع رأى في منامه كأن ناراً نزلت من السماء فأخذت الجامع دون ما حوله من العمران، فلما أصبح قص رؤياه فقيل له: أبشر بقبول الجامع المبارك لأن النار كانت في الزمن الماضي، إذا قبل الله قرباناً نزلت نار من السماء أخذته.\nلما رقي الخطيب أبو يعقوب البلخي المنبر وخطب، دعا للمعتمد ولولده ونسي أن يدعو لابن طولون ونزل عن المنبر، فأشار الأمير إلى غلامه نسيم بضرب الخطيب خمسمائة سوط، فتذكر الخطيب سهوه وهو على مراقي المنبر فعاد وقال: الحمد لله وصلى الله على سيدنا محمد ولقد عهدنا إلى بني آدم من قبل فنسى ولم نجد له عزما، اللهم وأصلح الأمير أبا العباس أحمد بن طولون مولى أمير المؤمنين، وزاد في الشكر والدعاء له بقدر الخطبة ثم نزل، فنظر الأمير إلى الغلام باستبدال الأسواط بالدنانير، ووقف الخطيب على ما كان منه فحمد الله تعالى على سلامته وهنأه الناس.\nلما انتهى الجامع وفتح للصلاة لم يحضر أحد من المصلين لاعتقادهم أنه بني بمال لا يعرفون أصله وكان الناس في ذلك الوقت محترزين على دينهم، فعز ذلك على ابن طولون وجمعهم في يوم جمعة وخطب فيهم وأقسم بالله العظيم الذي لا إله إلا هو أنه ما بنى هذا الجامع «ويده تشير إليه» بشيء من ماله وأنه بناه بكنز ظفر به في الجبل الثالث، وأن العشارى الذي نصبه على مئذنته وجده في الكنز، وأكمل الخطبة، فلما سمع الناس ذلك اجتمع خلق كثير وصلوا فيه الجمعة ولما سمع الناس حكاية المحراب الذي خطه النمل عظم ذلك عندهم حتى ضاق بالمصلين فقالوا لابن طولون نريد أن تزيد لنا فيه زيادة، فزاد فيه ما يعرف حالياً بالزيادات.\n\nالتصميم\nيعتبر المسجد من المساجد المعلقة إذ يصعد إلى أبوابه الداخلية بدرجات دائرية، وهو من أكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات ستة أفدنة ونصف الفدان، استخدم في بنائه الطوب الأحمر، وأقيم على جبل يشكر، فكان أساسه في حدوده القبلية على صخر الجبل مباشرة، أما في حدوده البحرية فكانت أساساته على عمق خمسة أمتار. وضع تصميمه على مثال المساجد الجامعة التي لها صحن كبير مكشوف تحيط به أروقة ذات عقود. وبني المسجد على شكل مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 162.25 متر × 161.50 متر، يشغل منها المسجد مع جدرانه مستطيلاً طول ضلعه 137.80 متر × 118.10 متر، ويتوسطه صحن مكشوف مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 92.35 متر × 91.80 متر، ويحيط بالجامع من جوانبه القبلية والبحرية والغربية أروقة غير مسقوفة تعرف بالزيادات وهي من المسجد، وأسوار هذه الزيادات عاليه بسيطة، فتحت بها أبواب تقابل أبواب الجامع، تتوجها من أعلى شرفة مفرغة، كما فتحت بأسوار الجامع أبواب وشبابيك علوية، بينها حنايا وطاقات مخوصة تتوجها من أعلى شرفات. وللمسجد 21 باب يقابلها نفس العدد في الزيادات، ويوجد في بعض الأبواب معابر خشبية قديمة بها زخارف مورقة، وسبب تعدد الأبواب كان لتسهيل الوصول إلى المساكن والأسواق التي كانت حول الجامع.\nبعد تجاوز سور الزيادة وأبواب المسجد يُوصل إلى الإيوانات التي يتوسطها صحن كبير، يمثل الإيوان الشرقي إيوان القبلة وهو أكبر الإيوانات وأكثرها أروقة وزخرفة، حيث يشتمل على خمسة أروقة، فيما تشتمل باقي الإيوانات على رواقين، وبه اللوحة التأسيسية للمسجد التي تتضمن تاريخ إنشاؤه، ويتوسط جداره الشرقي المحراب الرئيسي، وهيكله طولوني، أما الفسيفساء والطاقية الخشب ومقرنص القبة أعلاه فهي من أعمال السلطان لاجين، الذي تنضم إلى أعماله أيضاً المنبر الخشبي الذي اتُخذت حشواته من خشب الساج الهندي والأبنوس المدقوق بنقوش مورقة في منتهى الدقة، ونقل لاجين المنبر القديم إلى الجامع الظاهري الذي تلاشى حالياً ولم يبق له أثر. وبالإضافة إلى المحراب الرئيسي بهذا الإيوان توجد خمس محاريب جصية غير مجوفة أخرى استجدت بعد ذلك، اثنان صغيران أحدهما على يمين دكة المبلغ والأخر على يسارها، والمحراب المستنصري الموجود في منتصف البائكة الثانية بالرواق الشرقي من جهة الصحن، وعلى يساره محراب السلطان لاجين، ومحراب يعود إلى عصر المماليك البحرية على يسار المحراب الرئيسي. والأروقة مكونة من دعائم مبنية بالطوب مخلق في نواصيها الأربع عمد وتيجان تحمل عقوداً ستينية حليت حافاتها بزخارف جصية نباتية وفتح فيها شبابيك حليت بزخارف متنوعة، ويعلو العقود إفريز زخرفي من الجص يعلوه إزار خشبي يحيط بأروقة المسجد مكتوب فيه بالخط الكوفي البارز سورتا البقرة وآل عمران. وكان لاختيار الدعائم بدلاً من العمد دليلاً على حسن ذوق المصمم لتماثلها في الطول والسمك وهو ما لا ينطبق على العمد الرخامية التي كانت تختلس عادة من من الكنائس والأديرة المتخربة. استعمل الأسمنت المسلح بالسقوف الأثرية لأول مرة في هذا المسجد، وكان ذلك على يد محمود باشا أحمد مدير إدارة حفظ الآثار العربية فبنى السقف بتقاسيمه القديمة من الأسمنت المسلح ثم غلفه بالأخشاب القديمة والجديدة المطابقة للقديم. ويحيط بجدران المسجد الأربعة من أعلى مائة وتسعة وعشرون شباكاً من الجص المفرغ بأشكال هندسية ونباتية.\nوالقبة وسط الصحن هي ثالث قبة أقيمت للمسجد، حيث احترقت القبة الأولى الطولونية للصحن سنة 376هـ/986م، وتهدمت الثانية التي أنشئها العزيز بالله وقيل أمه تغريد سنة 385هـ/995م، وحلت محلها القبة الموجودة حالياً وهي من ضمن أعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد وأنشئها سنة 696هـ/1296م، وهي قبة كبيرة يقاس كل من ضلعيها القبلي والبحري 12.75 متر وضلعيها الشرقي والغربي 14.10 متر، وهي محمولة على أربعة عقود كانت شبابيكها محلاة بزخارف وكتابات كوفية، وبرقبتها من الداخل كتبت آية الوضوء، ويتوسطها فسقية، وفي جدارها سلم يوصل إلى سطح قاعدتها المربعة. أقيمت المنارة على مسافة 0.40 سم من حائط الزيادة الغربية وهي مبنية بالحجر مقاس قاعدتها 12.78 متر × 13.65 متر، وهي مكونة من أربع طبقات الأولى مربعة والثانية مستديرة وهي التي بها السلم الحلزوني والثالثة مثمنة أما الرابعة فتعلوها طاقية تكون معها شكل مبخرة. وهي المنارة الوحيدة في مصر التي لها سلم خارجي يشبه منارة مسجد سامراء. وتاريخ إنشاء المنارة محل خلاف بين الأثريين حيث يرى بعضهم أن السلطان لاجين جددها كاملة سنة 696هـ/1296م على مثالها القديم ضمن أعماله بالمسجد، ويرى البعض الآخر أنها طولونية عدا قمتها التي جددها السلطان لاجين.\nأما القبة فوق المحراب فهي مكونة من قاعدة مربعة من الخارج تحتوي على مجموعة من المقرنصات مكسوة بالخشب لتحويل المربع إلى شكل مثمن ثم إلى الدائرة التي ترتكز عليها القبة، وتلك القبة من أعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد. ألحق بالمسجد سبيل يقع بالناحية الشرقية من الزيادة الجنوبية له واجهة رئيسة هي الغربية يبلغ طولها 19.80 متر وتنقسم إلى جزأين الأول يضم باب الدخول والثاني يضم شباك السبيل، وحجرة التسبيل مستطيلة المسقط طولها من الشرق إلى الغرب 11.75 متر وعرضها 5.35 متر، ويغطي حجرة السبيل سقف من براطيم خشبية عليه آثار زخارف نباتية ملونة وبأركانه أربع مقرنصات يتكون كل منها من سبع حطات متتالية. وبجوار المحراب الرئيسي باب في الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية كان يخرج ويدخل منه ابن طولون إلى دار الإمارة الملاصقة للمسجد ليغير ثيابه أو يجدد وضوئه أو لأخذ قسط من الراحة ثم يعود فيدخل إلى الصف الأول دون أن يتخطى جموع المصلين، ودمرت هذه الدار مع الدمار الذي حل بمدينة القطائع بعد زوال الدولة الطولونية، والدار القائمة اليوم مكانها هي من أعمال السلطان لاجين.\n\nنص التأسيس\nنص التأسيس على واجهة مدخل الباب\n\nالترميم\nتوالت يد الإصلاح والترميم على المسجد في أكثر من مناسبة كان منها في عهد الخليفة الحاكم بأمر الله الذي أنزل إلى المسجد ثمانمائة وأربعة عشر مصحفاُ. وكان في وسط صحن المسجد فسقية من الرخام تعلوها قبة مثمنة الشكل مذهبة ومحمولة على أعمدة من رخام، تعرضت سنة 376هـ/986م في عهد الخليفة الفاطمي العزيز بالله لحريق، فأقام بدلاً منها قبة أخرى سنة 385هـ/995م، ولكن هذا التجديد لم يقو أيضاً على مواجهة عوامل الزمن. وخلال خلافة المستنصر بالله سنة 470هـ/1077م اجتاح مصر الوباء والقحط، فنشعت جدران المسجد وألم به الخراب، فلحقه الوزير بدر الدين الجمالي سنة 470هـ/1077م وأصلح أركانه وقوم بنيانه. وفي سنة 526هـ/1131م أمر الخليفة الحافظ لدين الله ببعض إصلاحات بالمسجد. وفي عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي اختص المسجد بفريق من المغاربة استعمره أكثر من جيل، إلى أن تولى حكم مصر السلطان الظاهر بيبرس فاتخذ ملحقات المسجد شونة للغلال سنة 662هـ/1263م. ثم كانت إصلاحات السلطان حسام الدين لاجين سنة 696هـ/1296م التي شملت بناؤه للسبيل الموجود بالنصف الشرقي من الزيادة القبلية والذي جدده السلطان قايتباي فيما بعد، وإنشاؤه القبة القائمة اليوم على فسقية بوسط الصحن والتي لها سلم يؤدي إلى ظهرها عمل في جدار قاعدتها البحري بدلاً من بناؤه منفصلاً، وتجديده كذلك الجزء العلوي المضلع من المئذنة الكبرى الذي يعلو دورتها المستديرة، وتشييده للمنبر الحالي. وفي عهد الناصر محمد بن قلاوون أنشأ بالمسجد منارتين أسطوانيتين على طرفي جداره الشرقي بناهما بالطوب، هدمت الأولى في القرن الثالث عشر الهجري، والثانية البحرية الشرقية في سنة 1933 لخلل بهما. وفي عهد الظاهر برقوق أنشأ الحاج عبيد بن محمد البازدار سنة 792هـ/1390م رواقاً بجوار المئذنة الكبرى، وجدد ميضأة بجانب الميضأة القديمة، ثم تلاه الشيخ شرف الدين المدني فأنشأ مصلى وتربة سنة 930هـ/1534م، وقد زالت إنشاءات البازدار والمدني في عمارة سور الزيادة الغربية سنة 1943. وفي أيام محمد بك أبى الذهب أنشأ بالمسجد مصنعاً لعمل الأحرمة الصوفية. وفي سنة 1263هـ/1847م حول كلوت بك المسجد إلى ملجأ للعجزة، وظل كذلك حتى سنة 1882 حين أدركت لجنة حفظ الآثار العربية المسجد فوجهت إليه عنايتها وقامت خلال الفترة من 1890 وحتى 1918 بإزالة الأبنية المستحدثة التي كانت بداخل الإيوانات، وهدمت بعض الدور التي كانت تحجب الوجهة الشرقية للمسجد، وأزالت الأتربة والأنقاض، وأصلحت القبة التي فوق المحراب والمنارة الكبيرة والمنارة البحرية الشرقية والمنبر والشبابيك الجصية وجزء من السقف، وحافظت على الزخارف الجصية.\nوفي عهد الملك فؤاد الأول سنة 1918 رغب في إعادة إقامة الشعائر الدينية بالمسجد فصلى فيه فريضة الجمعة وأمر بتخلية جوانبه وتتميم إصلاحه، فقامت اللجنة بتخلية الوجهة البحرية وفتح أبوابها، وإصلاح أسوارها وأزالت الأبنية المحدثة بالزيادة القبلية، وأخلت قسم كبير من الوجهتين الشرقية والغربية، وبلطت أروقة الإيوانات الغربية والبحرية والقبلية،

          "content": "The Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan (Arabic: مسجد ومدرسة السلطان حسن) is a monumental mosque and madrasa located in Salah al-Din Square in the historic district of Cairo, Egypt. It was built between 1356 and 1363 during the Bahri Mamluk period, commissioned by Sultan an-Nasir Hasan. The mosque was considered remarkable for its massive size and innovative architectural components, and is still considered one of the most impressive historic monuments in Cairo today.\n\nHistory\nPatron and founder: Sultan Hasan\nSultan al-Nasir Hasan (full name: An-Nasir Badr ad-Din Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Qalawun) ascended the throne at the age of 13 in 748 AH/1347 CE. When he reached maturity in 1350, he arrested the Emir Manjaq who controlled all of the state's affairs. Prior to that arrest, the emir was restricted to an allowance of just one hundred dirham per day. This pocket change was collected by servants for the Sultan. It's especially striking considering that during that time, the emir Shaykhu was estimated to have an income of 200,000 dirham per day. This deprivation may be viewed as a prompt for his later extravagance. Upon taking over the reins, Sultan Hasan placed people of his own favor into positions of power. This happened at the expense of dignitaries currently in position; it upset many of them. Discontented Emirs arrested the Sultan in 1351, held him in jail for three years, and promoted his brother as-Salih Salih to the throne. Hasan spent his time in jail studying and his obituaries commented on his learning as a result. He returned to power and again reshuffled the ruling establishment attempting to solidify power, but Sultan Hasan was assassinated by his commander in chief of the army, Yalbugha al-Umari, a Mamluk thought to be loyal. Because of the Sultan's extravagance in spending fortunes on women and other forms of favoritism, the commander rebelled against the Sultan. A contemporary Syrian historian, Ibn Kathir, backed this reputation. Ibn Kathir blamed the sultan for his greed and squandering of public funds. The lavish expenses noted coincide with the Sultan's extensive mosque. After his assassination in 1361, Sultan Hasan's body was never found; the mausoleum never served its purpose.\n\nConstruction\nThe mosque's construction is considered all the more remarkable as it coincided with the devastation wrought by the Black Plague, which struck Cairo repeatedly from the mid-14th century onwards. Its construction began in 1356 CE (757 AH) and work proceeded for three years \"without even a single day of idleness\". In fact, work appears to have continued even up to 1363, even after Sultan Hasan's death, before eventually ceasing. An inscription on the mosque notes the name of amir Muhammad ibn Biylik al-Muhsini as the supervisor of the construction of the mosque. Unusually, his name was placed near Sultan Hasan's in the inscription, which demonstrates how important the undertaking of the project must have been. The amir's high standing otherwise was another indication of this prestige, as he was appointed governor of Cairo in 1330 and oversaw other construction projects including the renovation of the hippodrome established by al-Zahir Baybars near the Citadel.\nThe most substantial available source concerning the mosque's construction is al-Maqrizi, writing six decades afterwards, as he had access to administrative documents that are unavailable to historians today. The manual labour needed for construction must have been partly depleted by the ongoing ravages of the plague, yet this does not appear to have been the main challenge. Maqrizi mentions that the construction of the mosque cost 30,000 dirham every day. The total construction costs amounted to over one million dinars, making it the most expensive mosque in medieval Cairo. Even the Sultan is said to have become discouraged at times by the cost of the project. Financing for the mosque was made possible by a few factors: first, the austerity measures implemented by Manjaq, one of the amirs in charge of state affairs before Sultan Hasan reached maturity; secondly, the influx of wealth to the state caused by the plague-related deaths of many Mamluk amirs whose properties were subsequently transferred to the state treasury, including the enormous wealth of amir Shaykhu; and thirdly, through extortion of the sultan's subjects during his reign.\nThe importance and scale of the building project also attracted craftsmen from all over the Mamluk empire, including the far-away provinces of Anatolia, which may explain the diversity and innovativeness of the mosque's design and decoration. It is also believed that limestone from the Pyramids of Giza was quarried for use in the mosque's construction.\n\nLater events\nDue to the mosque's location near the Citadel and because of its massive and sturdy construction, it was used on more than one occasion as a fortified position or as a platform from which to launch attacks on the Citadel. Al-Maqrizi, noted that \"as soon as there occurred strife between the people the state, a number of amirs and others ascended to the top of the mosque and began to bombard the Citadel from there\". This, in turn, persuaded more than one sultan to order the mosque to be demolished or blocked up. In 1391, rebel amirs against Sultan Barquq mounted the roof of the mosque and launched projectiles at the Citadel, provoking the sultan into ordering the stairs and platform of the entrance destroyed and the doorway boarded up. In 1500, Sultan Janbalat, anticipating another rebel attack from the mosque, ordered it demolished; however, after three days of unsuccessful demolition attempts on the mosque's southeastern (Citadel-facing) walls, he was forced to give up. In 1517, the very last Mamluk sultan, Tumanbay, took refuge inside the mosque in an attempt to evade capture by the victorious Ottoman army as it took control of Cairo, resulting in the Ottomans bombarding the mosque with cannonballs from the Citadel. In 1660, chronicles described the mausoleum's dome as still being full of holes made by cannonballs. Even in the 18th century, during the period of Ottoman control, the mosque was apparently closed for many years after unrest in 1736, and was only reopened in 1786 by order of Salim Agha. Some of these demolition attempts, however, drew criticism from Cairo's population and authorities were often subsequently pressured into repairing damages.\nIn 1659, the northern minaret attached to the mausoleum collapsed. In 1671-1672, the minaret was replaced with a smaller one, with a slightly different form, and at same time the original wooden dome of the mausoleum was replaced with the current dome, also in a different shape from the original.\nIn 1869, construction began on a monumental new mosque, the Mosque of ar-Rifa'i, right next to the existing mosque of Sultan Hasan. Completed in 1912, its size is comparable to Sultan Hasan's construction and it was built in a neo-Mamluk style. The two buildings together now dominate the old Rumayla Square (now renamed Midan Salah ad-Din) across from the Citadel.\n\nArchitectural description\nThe site\nThe mosque occupies almost 8000 square meters in a location close to the Citadel of Cairo. It stands on the site of a lavish palace which had previously been built at great cost by Hasan's father, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, for one of his amirs, Yalbugha al-Yahawi, and which was demolished to make way for the mosque. The construction of monumental buildings on this location was likely meant in part to create a pleasing sight for the Sultan to look down on from his palace in the Citadel.\nDuring the medieval era, an open square, known as Rumayla, lay between the mosque and the Citadel. Today, the square is occupied by a large traffic circle and has been renamed Salah ad-Din Square. The square and the former hippodrome nearby (on the southwestern side of the Citadel) were historically used for military parades, equestrian games, and official ceremonies, thus giving the location added symbolic significance.\n\nExterior\nThe building is about 150 meters long, 68 meters wide, and 36 meters high. Like all mosques, it is oriented towards Mecca, which is to the southeast of Cairo. The building's southwestern and northeastern facades (its longer sides) are marked by vertical rows of eight windows each (spread across four stories inside) which are a unique feature that helps to visually emphasize the structure's height. The top edge of the exterior facades are crowned by a thick cornice of muqarnas (stalactite-like carving) projecting 1.5 meters over the rest of the wall, another unprecedented feature in Mamluk architecture, although it does not extend around the entire building. Likewise, a crest of fleur-de-lis-shaped crenellations also ran along the whole length at the very top edge of the walls, but today it is only preserved around the mausoleum's walls on the southeastern side. The southeastern or Citadel-facing walls of the mosque and mausoleum have windows framed by more elaborate stone decoration in various patterns. The triangular-shaped spaces above the bottom windows here were once filled with geometric ceramic decoration, possibly of Anatolian Turkish inspiration.\n\nNear the bottom of the southwestern wall, below today's street level, is a row of stone corbels projecting from the wall which likely served to support the roof of a covered market along the street on this side.\n\nThe minarets\nThe mosque today has two minarets flanking the mausoleum chamber on the southeastern side of the structure. The southern one of this pair, which is still in its original form, is the highest minaret of Mamluk architecture, its summit being 84 meters above the street level at the time. The northern one collapsed in 1659 and was rebuilt in its current form in 1671-72. The original northern minaret was said to be more monumental, and its summit was \"double-headed\"; in other words, it culminated in two lantern structures (instead of the usual one), a feature that reappeared much later in the minaret of Sultan al-Ghuri at the al-Azhar Mosque and in the minaret of the nearby Mosque of Qanibay ar-Rammah.\nAdditionally, two more minarets were originally intended to stand above the monumental portal of the mosque, very much like in the architecture of Mongol Ilkhanid and Anatolian Seljuk madrasas and mosques around the same period (for example, the Gök Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, or the Great Mosque of Yazd, Iran), which were almost certainly an inspiration. This would have given the mosque a total of four minarets, which would have been unprecedented in Islamic architecture in Egypt. However, in 1361, during construction, one of those minarets toppled and killed around 300 people, including children in the primary school below. After this, the builders abandoned their construction, leaving only the two minarets adjacent to the mausoleum that we see today.\n\nThe entrance portal\nThe entrance portal is gigantic by the standards of mosque architecture and is 38 meters high. It was built at an angle projecting 17 degrees outwards from the rest of the wall so as to be visible from the Citadel. Its shape and the layout of its decoration indicate obvious inspiration from the portals of madrasas and mosques in Anatolian Seljuk and Mongol Ilkhanid architecture of the time, particularly the portal of the Gök (Blue) Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, built in 1271. On the inside of the portal, behind the stone benches and flanking the doorway, are a pair of marble niches filled with geometric patterns reminiscent of Qur'an illumination and culminating in shallow muqarnas hoods (also Anatolian in style). Above these are black marble panels inlaid with white Kufic Arabic inscriptions of parts of the Surat al-Fath (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. The Shahada (the Muslim declaration of faith) is inscribed in \"square\" Kufic higher up above this, while further up is a band of inscription containing another Quranic verse (24:36-37), running along the full width of the inside of the portal, just below the muqarnas canopy.\nThe decoration of the portal was apparently never finished. There are many examples of stone carvings whose initial outlines were drawn into the stone but were never carved out. The broad and impressive muqarnas canopy over the doorway does not appear to be fully carved out either, while above this a section of stone cladding appears to be missing. Other bands of stone-carved decoration were only partially executed. For example, at the foot of the decorative niche on the left side of the portal one arabesque medallion was carved on the left while the one on the right was not. (This is also a rare demonstration of the steps in the stone-carving process: it is likely that a master craftsman drew the outlines of the pattern into the stone and that apprentices were later responsible for carving it out; in this case, the second step was not completed.) Some of the carved patterns, even if unfinished, are themselves notable; for example, there are floral chinoiserie motifs here which appear in other Mamluk crafts of the time but do not appear anywhere else in Mamluk architecture. Another minor but curious feature is the sculpted image of other architectural buildings in some of the carvings just above the stairs leading up to the portal; these are possibly spoils from a Gothic-style Christian monument, presumably from Crusader churches located on the estates donated to the madrasa-mosque's foundation.\nThe original bronze-covered doors of the entrance were forcibly purchased at a modest price by Sultan Mu'ayyad in the early 15th century for use on his own mosque, and can still be seen there today.\n\nInterior\nAlthough the exterior walls of the building are in stone, much of the interior is brick, with facades covered in stucco and finished with stonework for decorative details.\n\nThe entrance vestibule\nThe vestibule chamber upon entering the mosque is an unusually ornate space, covered by a small central dome surrounded by elaborate muqarnas vaults. The dome and half-dome arrangement here is reminiscent of Byzantine architecture, but may have been inspired from Armenian craftsmanship, if not original. The back wall facing the doorway is covered in marble paneling: in the middle is a square panel made of inlaid white and red marble in a geometric pattern of Syrian style, while on either side are marble panels with other carved patterns. From this chamber, a bending passage leads to the central courtyard.\nAlso located behind the walls of the vestibule on the floor plan is a space which may have once housed, or was intended to house, a doctor and medical students, as mentioned in the foundation (waqf) document. The space is now ruined, or might have never been finished.\n\nThe central courtyard and mosque area\nThe enormous central courtyard is a vast square space surrounded by four monumental iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side), of which the qibla iwan (the iwan in the direction of prayer) is larger than the other three. This space acted as a Friday mosque accessible to the public, but it was also used for teaching by the madrasas that were part of the foundation. The four iwans are said to have each been devoted to the teaching of one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence: the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafi'i maddhabs.\nThe size of the main qibla iwan was frequently acknowledged as an awe-inspiring achievement, with Mamluk historians like Maqrizi claiming it was greater than the famous arch of the Sassanid Persian palace of Ctesiphon (still the largest single-span vault of brickwork in the world today). The iwan of Sultan Hasan's mosque is not actually as large as that arch, but the comparison nonetheless emphasized the building's legendary reputation. This iwan is also richly decorated. A monumental inscription in Kufic style, set against a swirling vegetal arabesque background, runs along the entire length of the iwan and is unique in Mamluk architecture. The text is a fragment of the Surat al-Fath (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. Below this inscription band, the qibla wall is covered in multicolored marble paneling, centered around the mihrab (the niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) which is framed by its own golden inscription and whose central half-dome hood features a sunrise motif radiating from the word \"Allah\". The stone and marble minbar (pulpit) next to it may have once been covered in inlaid geometric patterns like that on the minbar of the Mosque of Aqsunqur, but this is not visible today. The minbar does still feature finely crafted bronze doors with geometric patterns. A dado of marble also runs along the other two walls of the iwan, although at a much shorter height. A stone platform, known as a dikka, stands in the middle of the space and was where reciters of the Qur'an would recite aloud for communal prayers.\nThe other three iwans and the rest of the courtyard are largely plain except for the doorways at the corners of the courtyard. These doorways lead to the madrasa units and with their own smaller courtyards. They are framed in ablaq stonework, bands of stone inscriptions, and colored mosaics. It is possible that the other iwans were intended to be decorated too but were never finished. Additionally, a marked-out but empty band running along the top edge of the entire courtyard, above the iwans, may have been intended for another monumental inscription.\nThe floor of the central courtyard is paved in rich marble mosaics. The pavement dates from a restoration by the \"Comité\" in 1912, but the patterns may well be from Sultan Hasan's time. The domed pavilion at the center of the courtyard shelters an ablutions fountain (for washing before prayer), but it was originally meant to be only a decorative fountain (ablutions facilities were once located next to the mosque building). The domed structure itself is made of wood and has likely been repaired or restored many times. Its current shape may date from Ottoman times, but it may also be the earliest Mamluk example of this type of fountain.\n\nThe madrasa courtyards\nThe doors in the corners of the main courtyard each lead to one of the four madrasa devoted to one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence). Each was centered on a small courtyard surrounded by four stories of living quarters and cells for students. The madrasas were not of equal size (at least in part because of the irregular floor plan of the mosque, which was limited by existing streets and structures), with the Hanafi and Shafi'i madrasas being the largest, located on either side of the great iwan of the main mosque.\nThese madrasa areas were almost entirely separate from the central courtyard (aside from the doorways leading to them), unlike in other madrasas were the rooms of the students often had windows overlooking the main courtyard. This may have been because the main courtyard was used as a mosque by members of the public and a greater measure of privacy or tranquility was desired for the students. Each madrasa courtyard also had its own smaller iwan used for prayers and oriented towards the qibla (direction of prayer), which was decorated by a stucco inscription band much like the one in the great qibla-side iwan of the main mosque.\n\nThe mausoleum and the dome\nThe position of the mausoleum relative to the rest of the building was unusual in that it was located directly behind the qibla wall of the mosque, meaning it stood in the direction towards which Muslims in the mosque would pray. This is something not found in any other Mamluk religious building, though there is apparently no evidence that this was seen as  controversial at the time. This layout had the consequence of making the mausoleum project outwards into Rumayla square and towards the Citadel, probably to make it more prominent when seen from the Citadel. The mausoleum chamber is accessed from inside the mosque, through a doorway to the left of the mihrab in the qibla wall. On the same wall, on the right side, there is a large, door-sized window which also opens to the mausoleum chamber. This window is distinguished by a set of doors which are notable for their exceptionally fine craftsmanship, made from copper-niello, inlaid with gold and silver, and featuring geometric star patterns and Thuluth-style Arabic inscriptions.\n\nInside, the chamber is even more lavishly decorated, with multicolored marble mosaic paneling on the lower walls and a large painted inscription of the Throne Verse, carved in wood, running around the entire chamber above this. The marble mihrab is similar to the one in the main qibla iwan of mosque. The square chamber transitions gradually to the round dome (12 meters in diameter) with the use of wooden pendentives, typical of Mamluk architecture, which are sculpted into muqarnas forms and richly painted and gilded. \nThe dome of the mausoleum chamber, visible from outside and from the Citadel, is no longer original but was replaced with the current one in 1671. This might have been due to damage from the fallen minaret in 1659 or from cannonballs fired from the Citadel in times of conflict. The original dome was also made of wood, despite the heavy buttressed walls of the chamber being able to support something heavier. However, the original dome had a very different shape. An Italian traveler in the early 17th century described it as being shaped like an egg; more specifically, it started narrow at the bottom then swelled out like a bulb, before finishing in a pointed tip.\nThe cenotaph at the middle of the mausoleum chamber, placed behind a wooden screen, is dated to 1384. Sultan Hasan's body was never found after he was killed and as such he was never buried here. Instead, the tomb is occupied by his two young sons. The mausoleum is also furnished with a large wooden lectern decorated with geometric star patterns and inlaid with ivory, which was meant to hold one of the giant royal copies of the Qur'an owned by the foundation.\n\nOther structures of the foundation\nThe northwestern side of the mosque-madrasa is currently occupied by ruins and excavated remains. A primary school (maktab) once stood on this side, as well as a set of latrines and ablutions fountains. A row of arched rooms or units is also visible, and may have been used for shops as part of a weapons market. There was also a rectangular pool and a waterwheel, probably part of a pre-existing water aqueduct system which brought water to the royal stables of the Citadel.\n\nSee also\nLists of mosques\nList of mosques in Africa\nList of mosques in Egypt\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nAl-Khalifa District\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAl-Harithy, Howyda N.

          "content": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"\n\nHistory\nOverview\nThe Citadel was built on a promontory beneath the Muqattam Hills, a setting that made it difficult to attack. The efficacy of the Citadel's location is further demonstrated by the fact that it remained the heart of Egyptian government until the 19th century. During this long period, the layout and structure of the Citadel was repeatedly altered and adapted to suit the designs of new rulers and new regimes, which makes it difficult to reconstitute its original plan or even its plan in subsequent periods. There have been three major construction periods leading to the Citadel's current form: 12th-century Ayyubid (starting with Saladin), 14th-century Mamluk (under al-Nasir Muhammad), and in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali. The Citadel stopped being the seat of government when Egypt's ruler, Khedive Ismail, moved to his newly built Abdin Palace in the new downtown Cairo in 1874. Despite its elaborate defenses, the Citadel never ended up being subjected to a true siege, though it was implicated on various occasions in the political conflicts within Cairo or Egypt.\n\nGeneral layout\nIn general, the fortress complex is divided into two parts: the Northern Enclosure (where the National Military Museum is located today), and the Southern Enclosure (where the Mosque of Muhammad Ali is located today). The Northern Enclosure was historically reserved for military garrisons, while the Southern Enclosure was developed as the residence of the sultan. There is also a lower, western enclosure which was historically the site of the royal stables of the Mamluks. However, these functional distinctions were largely erased in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali Pasha, who overhauled the entire site and constructed buildings of various functions throughout the Citadel.\nTo the west and southwest of the Citadel was a long open field frequently referred to as the \"hippodrome\" by historians or as the Maydan (\"plaza\" or \"square\"). For centuries this was maintained as a training ground (especially for horsemanship) and as a military parade ground. Its outline is still visible in the layout of the roads (mainly Salah ad-Din Street) on this side of the Citadel.\nAt the northern end of this hippodrome was another square or plaza known as Rumayla Square (Maydan/Midan Rumayla), today known as Salah al-Din Square (Midan Salah ad-Din) or Citadel Square (Midan al-Qal'a). This was used as a horse market (due to its adjacency to the royal stables), but also as an official square for royal and religious ceremonies. It is occupied today by a large roundabout next to which are the massive mosques of Sultan Hassan and al-Rifa'i.\n\nAyyubid foundation and construction: 12th–13th centuries\nSaladin's original construction\nThe Citadel was begun by the Kurdish Ayyubid ruler Salah al-Din (Saladin) between 1176 and 1183 CE in order to protect Cairo from potential Crusader attacks and to provide a secure center of government for his new regime (only a few years after he had dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate). This also emulated a feature of many Syrian cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which had walled citadels that acted as the seat of power and which Saladin was familiar with. Saladin also set out to build a wall, around 20 kilometres long, that would surround both Cairo and Fustat (the nearby former capital), and is recorded as saying: \"With a wall I will make the two [cities of Cairo and Fustat] into a unique whole, so that one army may defend them both; and I believe it is good to encircle them with a single wall from the bank of the Nile to the bank of the Nile.\" The Citadel would be the centerpiece of the wall. While the Citadel was initially completed in 1183–1184, the wall Saladin had envisioned was still under construction in 1238, long after his death. It does not appear to have ever been fully completed after this, though long segments were built.\nSaladin charged his chief eunuch and close confidant, Baha al-Din Qaraqush, with overseeing the construction of the new fortifications. Most of the structure was built with limestone quarried from the surrounding Muqattam Hills; however, Qaraqush also quarried a number of minor pyramids at Giza and even as far away as Abusir in order to obtain further materials. He also made use of labour provided by Christian prisoners of war captured in Saladin's victories against the Crusaders. The initial fortress built in Saladin's time consisted essentially of what is today's Northern Enclosure, although not all elements of the Northern Enclosure's current walls are original. The southeast and northeast sections of these walls are likely the closest to their original forms. Also from Saladin's time is the so-called Yusuf's Well, a deep underground well accessed through a spiral staircase which provided water for the fortress. The original southwestern section of Saladin's enclosure has disappeared but is likely to have extended around this well and around the current site of al-Nasir Muhammad's mosque (making the original enclosure slightly bigger than the existing Northern Enclosure today). The carved image of a double-headed eagle, found near the top of one of the towers of the western walls (near the Police Museum), is a curious feature which is popularly attributed to Salah ad-Din's reign. It was probably located elsewhere originally and then moved here at some point when the walls were rebuilt in Muhammad Ali's time. The eagle's heads are missing today, but their original appearance was noted by chroniclers.\nOnly one original gate, Bab al-Mudarraj, has survived to the present day. It is located along the walls of the Northern Enclosure, nowadays between the Harem Palace (National Military Museum) and the newer Bab al-Jadid gate. It was originally the main gate of the Citadel, but today it is obscured by later constructions from Muhammad Ali's time, including the Bab al-Jadid (\"New Gate\"). Its name was derived from the carved stone steps (darraj) which led up to it from the path that connected the Citadel to the city below. Like other gateways in Ayyubid military architecture, it had a bent entrance. Today, the inside of the gate's dome-vault is covered in plaster with painted inscriptions belonging to Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad and dated to 1310. It was also on this gate that a foundation inscription was discovered which dates the completion of the Citadel to 1183–1184. Nonetheless, construction of one kind or another almost certainly continued under Saladin's Ayyubid successors.\n\nConstruction under Saladin's successors\nConstruction of the Ayyubid Citadel appears to have continued under Sultan al-'Adil (r. 1200–1218), Saladin's brother and later successor, and was probably finished under the reign of al-Kamil (1218–1238). Al-'Adil had already supervised some of the construction under Saladin, while al-Kamil in turn probably worked on the Citadel during al-'Adil's reign when the latter gave him the viceroyship of Egypt in 1200 (a prelude to becoming sultan later). The rounded towers in the outer walls of the Northern Enclosure date from Saladin's initial construction while the large rectangular towers date to al-Adil's reign. The two large round towers in the far northeastern corner of the enclosure, known as Burj al-Ramla (\"Tower of Sand\") and Burj al-Hadid (\"Tower of Iron\") are towers from Saladin's time which al-Kamil subsequently reinforced in 1207.\nMore significantly, al-Kamil built or completed the palaces in the southern section of the Citadel, and became the first ruler to actually move there in 1206. In addition to the palaces, a number of other structures were built, including a mosque, a royal library, and a \"hall of justice\". In 1213 al-Kamil also established a horse market on what became Rumayla Square (the square between the Citadel and Sultan Hasan's mosque today), as well as a maydan, a long open square or \"hippodrome\", to the west and south of the Citadel which was used for equestrian training and military parades. This was on the same site that Ahmad Ibn Tulun established a similar hippodrome in the 9th century. This work established the overall plan of the Citadel area for centuries to come: the northern part of the citadel was devoted to military functions, the southern part to the sultan's private residence and the state administration, and outside, at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, was the parade ground which remained for centuries. Al-Kamil was likely also responsible for building or completing the first water aqueduct which ran along the top of Saladin's city walls to the southwest and brought water from the Nile to the Citadel.\nSultan al-Salih (r. 1240–1249) subsequently moved away from the Citadel again and built himself a new fortified enclosure on Roda Island (which also became the barracks of the Bahri Mamluks who took power after him). Only under the Mamluks, who ruled from 1250 to 1517, did the Citadel finally become the permanent residence of the sultans.\n\nMamluk period: 13th–16th centuries\nEarly Bahri Mamluk period\nUnder the early Bahri Mamluks, the Citadel was continuously developed and the Southern Enclosure in particular was expanded and became the site of important monumental structures. Al-Zahir Baybars, al-Mansur Qalawun, al-Ashraf Khalil and al-Nasir Muhammad each built or rebuilt the audience hall (throne hall), the main mosque, the palaces, or other structures. Unlike the earlier Ayyubid buildings, the Mamluk buildings were increasingly designed to be visible from afar and to dominate the city's skyline. Many of these structures have not survived, with few exceptions.\nBaybars (r. 1260–1277) was the first one to split the Citadel into two areas by building the Bab al-Qulla, the gate and wall which today separates the Southern and Northern Enclosures of the Citadel. It was named after a keep tower which he built nearby and which was later torn down by Qalawun. The gate itself was rebuilt again by al-Nasir Muhammad in 1320. The gate was intended to control access to the newly delimited Southern Enclosure which Baybars then developed into a more elaborate and more exclusive royal complex. A part of the Southern Enclosure became reserved for the harem, the private and domestic area of the sultan and his family, while another part became the site of more monumental structures whose functions were more public, ceremonial, or administrative. Among the structures he built here was one called the Dar al-Dhahab (\"the Hall of Gold\"), which he seems to have used as his private reception hall and which may have been located in the area of the present Police Museum. Another important structure he built in the area is referred to as the Qubba al-Zahiriyya (\"the Dome of al-Zahir\"), a monumental and richly decorated hall with a central dome which acted as an audience hall or throne hall. It may have been a new structure or an addition to an existing Ayyubid structure, and it was probably the predecessor of al-Nasir Muhammad's \"Great Iwan\". Baybars also built the Tower of the Lions (Burj al Siba'), a round tower which featured a stone-carved frieze of lions (Baybars' emblem) along its upper parts. The tower was obscured by later construction but its remains, including the lion carvings, were rediscovered in the late 20th century and are now visible on the northwestern side of the Police Museum.\nSultan al-Mansur Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) either built or significantly renovated a structure known as the Dar al-Niyaba which served as the palace of the sultan's vice-regent. He also demolished Baybars' Qubba al-Zahiriyya and replaced it with his own domed structure, the Qubba al-Mansuriyya. More significantly in the long run, Qalawun was the first to create elite regiments of mamluks (soldiers of slave origin) who resided in the various towers of the Citadel, which earned them the name \"Burji\" Mamluks (Mamluks of the Tower). It was these cohorts of mamluks who would eventually dominate the sultanate during the Burji Mamluk period.\nSultan al-Ashraf Khalil built a qa'a (reception hall) in 1291–1292, referred to as the Qa'a al-Ashrafiyya. Its remains were excavated in the late 20th century and are still visible today, just west of the present-day gate called Bab al-'Alam (Gate of the Flag), across the terrace from the current Police Museum. The remains indicate that the walls of the hall were decorated with multi-coloured marble paneling along the lower walls (a dado), above which was a small frieze of marble mosaics with mother-of-pearl and other marble reliefs, and above all this were panels of glass mosaics with scenes of trees and palaces which are reminiscent of the mosaics of the Ummayyad Mosque and Mausoleum of Baybars in Damascus. (During excavations the mosaics were removed for study and restoration.) The hall also had a central octagonal fountain of marble and the floor was paved with marble mosaics arranged in geometric patterns. It was one of the few structures in this area which al-Nasir Muhammad did not destroy but instead re-used for various purposes, and in the Burji Mamluk period it seems to have replaced the Dar al-Niyaba as the palace of the vice-regent. Al-Ashraf also, once again, demolished the qubba or domed throne hall of his father Qalawun and replaced it with his own structure, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (the word \"iwan\" seems to have been used from then on for this particular type of building). This new throne hall differed from previous incarnations in one notable respect: it was painted with pictures of al-Ashraf's amirs (commanders), each with their rank inscribed above his head.\n\nThe reign of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad\nThe greatest builder of the Citadel during the Mamluk period was al-Nasir Muhammad, another son of Qalawun, who was sultan three times over a period of nearly fifty years between 1293 and 1341. It was most likely under his reign that the borders of the Southern Enclosure expanded to their current outline, in order to accommodate the new palaces and structures he built. He is responsible for several major works in the Citadel, though unfortunately most of them fell into ruin during the Ottoman period and were finally demolished by Muhammad Ali in the 19th century. In addition to his official palaces and his semi-public monuments in the Southern Enclosure, al-Nasir reserved the southeastern corner of the enclosure (the location of the al-Gawhara Palace today) for the palaces, private courtyard, and garden devoted to his harem (wives and concubines), probably as Baybars had done, called al-Qusur al-Jawwaniyya. He also commissioned new palaces outside the Citadel but nearby for his favourite amirs, and his projects encouraged the development of areas near the Citadel, such as al-Darb al-Ahmar.\nIn 1312 al-Nasir also ordered the renovation of the water aqueduct which brought water from the Nile to the Citadel. His predecessor, al-Ashraf, is responsible for building an octagonal water intake tower on the shores of the Nile, from which water was raised and transferred along the aqueduct, but al-Nasir completed the project. This improvement of the infrastructure allowed him in turn to embark on more ambitious projects within the Citadel.\n\nThe Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq)\nAmong the most important constructions was the Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq; sometimes translated as the \"Striped Palace\"), built in 1313–1314. Its name derived from the red-and-black ablaq masonry that marked its exterior. It may have been partly inspired by the palace of the same name that Sultan Baybars had built in Damascus in 1264 and in which al-Nasir resided when he visited that city. The palace was used for regular receptions and private ceremonies. It was connected to the Great Iwan (see below) by a private passage or corridor which led to the sultan's entrance in the back wall of the Iwan. The walls of the palace itself formed a part of the new outer boundary of the Citadel's enclosure: it was located on an escarpment overlooking the city below, and the escarpment, along with the foundation walls of the palace, acted as the effective outer wall of the Citadel at its western corner. Because of this, al-Nasir was able to build a loggia on the side of the palace from which he could freely observe the activities in the stables and in the maydan (hippodrome) at the foot of the Citadel below, as well as a private door and staircase which gave him direct access between the palace and the hippodrome.\n\nThe Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir)\nAl-Nasir demolished, yet again, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (throne hall) of his brother al-Ashraf in 1311, and replaced it with his own structure known as the Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir). This may have been out of a desire to make it appear even more prominent and monumental, as well as to perhaps accommodate larger ceremonies. In any case, he demolished it (either entirely or in part) and rebuilt it yet again in 1333, and it is this incarnation of the Great Iwan which survived up until the 19th century (when it was destroyed during Muhammad Ali's constructions). It was frequently cited by chroniclers as the most impressive structure in Cairo, more monumental than almost any of the Mamluk mosques. It served as the sultan's public and ceremonial throne room and continued to be used (albeit less consistently) by Mamluk sultans after him.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad's Mosque\nLastly, al-Nasir's other most notable contribution, and the only major structure of his reign still preserved at the Citadel, was the Mosque of al-Nasir, also situated in the Southern Enclosure. This was built in 1318 on the site of an earlier Ayyubid main mosque which he demolished in order to serve as the new grand mosque of the Citadel. Al-Nasir renovated his mosque again in 1335. Some of its huge columns were also re-used from Pharaonic-era buildings, much like the columns of the Great Iwan. While its structure is well preserved, most of its rich marble paneling decoration was stripped away and shipped to Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Selim I after his conquest of Egypt.\n\nLater Mamluk period\nSubsequent sultans continued to build or add to the palaces and administrative buildings inside the Citadel, though rarely with the same ambition as al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan al-Salih Isma'il (a son of al-Nasir who reigned from 1342 to 1345) built a richly decorated palace or hall known as al-Duhaysha (the \"little wonder\") which was inaugurated in February 1344. Likewise, Sultan Hasan (another son of al-Nasir) built a lavish domed palace known as the Qa'a al-Baysariyya, which was completed in 1360. It was over 50 metres tall and, in addition to a main hall covered by a dome, it also had a tower with an apartment for the sultan which was decorated with ivory and ebony. Other private apartments also had domes, while paintings and portraits decorated the walls. Both Isma'il and Hasan were sons of al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan Hasan also built his massive madrasa-mosque just northwest of the Citadel, off Rumayla Square, in the 1350s and early 1360s (and still standing today). It was so large and tall that in later years it was reportedly used by rebels as a platform from which to bombard the Citadel on more than one occasion.\nThe Burji Mamluk period saw little construction in the Citadel by comparison with the earlier Mamluk period. The private harem courtyard in the southeastern corner of the Southern Enclosure, known as the hosh, became increasingly used to build new reception halls and other structures with slightly more public functions. The late Burji sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri built palaces in this part of the Citadel, on the site of what is now the 19th-century al-Gawhara Palace. Al-Ghuri also restored many other structures in and around the Citadel, including a major restoration/reconstruction of the Citadel's Nile aqueduct. He also restored or reconfigured the Mamluk hippodrome at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, where he installed a vast pool which received water from the restored aqueduct.\n\nOttoman period: 16th–18th centuries\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. Sultan Selim I stripped the monumental Mamluk buildings of their precious materials, especially their marble panels and decoration, and shipped them to Istanbul for use in his own building projects.\nDuring this period the Citadel was neglected and many Mamluk structures fell into ruin, although some of the Citadel walls were rebuilt or extended in the 16th–17th centuries. Due to rivalries between different military corps in the Ottoman forces, the Citadel was divided into three areas to house three different elements of the Ottoman garrison: the Northern Enclosure housed the barracks of the Janissaries, the Southern Enclosure was used by the Ottoman pasha (governor) and his own troops, and another lower western enclosure, which contained the stables, housed the 'Azaban (or Azap) corps. Each section had its own mosque and facilities. In between them was a virtual no-man's-land where some of the former grand Mamluk buildings stood abandoned or under-used. This included the Great Iwan of al-Nasir Muhammad, whose large dome collapsed in 1521 and was never rebuilt. The Ablaq Palace was used more productively as a manufacturing center for weaving the Kiswah, the rich cloth covering the Kaaba in Mecca, which continued to come from Cairo until the 20th century.\nSome notable structures were still created during this period. The huge round tower near the visitor entrance today, standing at the corner of the Southern and Northern Enclosures, was built by Ibrahim Pasha (the later Grand Vizier under Suleiman the Magnificent) in 1525 and is known as the Burj al-Muqattam (\"Tower of the Muqattam Hills\"). The round tower at the other corner of the two enclosures (between Bab al-Qulla and Bab al-Wastani), known now as Burj al-Wastani (\"Middle Tower\"), may also date from this time. The first mosque built in the Citadel after the Mamluk period was the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha in the Northern Enclosure, built by the Ottoman governor in 1528 for use by the Janissaries. It is one of the few mosques in Cairo that represents something close to the classical Ottoman architectural style.\n\nThe lower, western enclosure which can be seen today below the Mosque of Muhammad Ali was historically the area which housed the stables of the Citadel. It's not clear when walls were first built around it, though they were likely already enclosed in Mamluk times. This enclosure was occupied by the 'Azaban soldiers, and contains the Mosque of al-'Azab which was built by Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697. (It is possible that Ahmad Katkhuda merely renovated an existing early Burji Mamluk mosque and added the present-day Ottoman-style minaret to it.) The rest of the area is presently occupied by various 19th-century buildings, including storehouses and old factories. The lower enclosure was accessed from the west through the monumental gate called Bab al-'Azab, which was built by Radwan Katkhuda al-Julfi in 1754, probably on the site of an earlier Mamluk gate known as Bab al-Istabl (Gate of the Stables). The gate was modeled on the old Fatimid gate of Bab al-Futuh in the north of Cairo, but its interior facade was later remodeled into a neo-Gothic style during the Khedival period.\nThe present-dat visitor entrance goes through the small western gate called Bab al-Jabal (\"Gate of the Mountain\") which was built by the Ottoman governor Yakan Pasha in 1785 when he rearranged the area to build a new palace. Yakan also rebuilt a small stretch of the adjoining wall south of here.\n\nMuhammad Ali: 19th-century\nMuhammad Ali was a pasha of Albanian origin who was appointed by the Ottoman sultan in 1805 to restore order after the French occupation of Egypt (1798–1801). However, he subsequently established himself as de facto independent ruler of the country. He consolidated power through a famous and violent coup in 1811 which eliminated the remaining Mamluk class that still formed the country's elites. One of the most pivotal events of this coup took place in the Citadel. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration banquet in the Citadel, and as they were leaving and passing along the road leading from the upper Citadel to Bab al-Azab, regiments of his Albanian gunmen opened fire from above and massacred all of them.\nThe Citadel is sometimes referred to as the \"Citadel of Muhammad Ali\" (Arabic: قلعة محمد علي Qalaʿat Muḥammad ʿAlī). It contains the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, which he built between 1828 and 1848, perched on the summit of the citadel. This Ottoman-style mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Ali's second son who died in 1816. However, it also represents Muhammad Ali's efforts to erase symbols of the Mamluk legacy that he sought to replace. Many of the former Mamluk structures, including the Great Iwan and the Ablaq Palace of al-Nasir Muhammad, were demolished in 1825 to make way for his new mosque and its renovated surroundings. Muhammad Ali himself was eventually buried in the mosque. His mosque also replaced the nearby Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad as the Citadel's official main mosque. Muhammad Ali's mosque, with its large dome and tall pencil-like Ottoman minarets, is one of the most prominent monuments on Cairo's skyline to this day.\n\nAnother obvious change that Muhammad Ali enacted pertained to the uses of the Citadel's northern and southern enclosures: during the Mamluk period the Southern Enclosure was the royal residential area and the Northern Enclosure was mostly military, but Muhammad Ali built his Harem Palace (which now houses the National Military Museum) in the Northern Enclosure, erasing the old functional division between the two sections of the Citadel. He also built or rebuilt some of the walls. Notably, he rebuilt the Bab al-Qulla gate and the surrounding wall which separated the Northern and Southern enclosures from each other, giving it its current look. The gate's form today once again emulates the appearance of Bab al-Futuh but introduces some Turkish elements. In 1825 he also built the gate known as Bab al-Jadid (the \"New Gate\") at the point where a new carriage road entered the Citadel from the north. Around the same time he built the Bab al-Wastani (or Bab al-Wustani) (\"Middle Gate\") where the same road continues into the Southern Enclosure (just north of the Bab al-Qulla).\nThe Citadel eventually ceased to act as the residence of Egypt's ruler after Khedive Isma'il (Muhammad Ali's grandson) moved the court to the new 'Abdin Palace, located in the newly created districts of downtown Cairo, in 1874.\n\n20th century and present day\nFor many years up to the late 20th century, the Citadel was closed to the public and used as a military garrison and base; at first by the British Army during the British occupation and afterward up to 1946, and since then by the Egyptian military. In 1983, the Egyptian government opened a large part of the Citadel to the public and initiated refurbishment programs to convert some of its old buildings into museums, though the military retains a presence. It is now a major tourist site for both Egyptians and foreigners alike.\n\nWater supply system\nYusuf's Well (Salah ad-Din's Well)\nTo supply water to the Citadel, Saladin built an 85-metre-deep (280 ft) well known as the Well of Joseph (or Bir Yusuf), so-called because Saladin's birth name, Yūsif, is the Arabic equivalent of Joseph. His chief eunuch and confidant, Qaraqush, who oversaw construction of the Citadel, was also responsible for digging the well. The well is considered a masterpiece of medieval engineering and still exists today. Its shaft was divided into two sections, almost all of which is cut out of the rock itself. The upper part has a wider shaft which is surrounded by a long spiral staircase, separated from the main shaft only by a thin wall of rock. For this reason, the well is also known as the Spiral Well (Bir al-Halazon). The stairs could be covered with earth to make it into a ramp for oxen to travel down to its bottom. The lower part of the well was another shaft descending to the level of underground water seeping in from the Nile. At the bottom of the upper section, two oxen turned a waterwheel that brought the water up from the bottom of the well, while another waterwheel at the top of the well, also powered by oxen, brought the water up the rest of the way.\n\nThe Mamluk Aqueduct\nDuring the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, Saladin's well was insufficient to produce enough water for the Citadel's growing population and for al-Nasir's envisioned construction projects. To increase the volume of water, al-Nasir renovated an Ayyubid aqueduct system (probably originally completed by al-Kamil) and extended it with a new aqueduct system. This system consisted of a number of water wheels on the Nile which raised water to the top of an hexagonal tower (built by his predecessor al-Ashraf Khalil), from which the water was then transported along a series of raised aqueducts to the base of the Citadel. From the foot of the Citadel, the water was then carried up to the palaces via another system of waterwheels. However, since this water supply could not be guaranteed in the event of a siege, Saladin's well was still an essential water source.\n\nThe Cistern of Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar\nThis small domed building just outside the Citadel to the east was built in 1495–96 by an amir called Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar, a man originally from Erzincan (Turkey) who joined the Mamluk ranks under Sultan Qaytbay. Because of its dome, the building has the look of a mausoleum but it is actually a structure covering access to a cistern. It has an inscription that memorializes the victory of Sultan Qaytbay's army over Ottoman forces at Adana in a battle in 1486. Today it is cut off from the Citadel and stands stranded between two highways (Salah Salem road and Kobri al-Ebageah) which pass right next to the Citadel on its eastern side.\n\nMosques\nThere are four main mosques in the Citadel today, some of which are open to visitors:\n\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\nThe mosque was built between 1830 and 1848, although not completed until the reign of Said Pasha in 1857. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public today. The architect was Yusuf Bushnak from Istanbul and its model was the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in that city. Muhammad Ali Pasha was buried in a tomb carved from Carrara marble, in the courtyard of the mosque. His body was transferred here from Hawsh al-Basha in 1857.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad Mosque\nBuilt in 1318, during the early Bahri Mamluk period, as the royal mosque of the Citadel where the sultans of Cairo performed their Friday prayers, today this hypostyle mosque is still similar to how it looked in the 1300s though many repairs have been made and only some of its original decoration has been restored. The parts of the building relying on plastered walls have been reinforced. There have also been attempts to restore the light-blue color of the ceiling. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public.\n\nMosque of Sulayman Pasha\nBuilt in 1528, it was first of the Citadel's Ottoman-style mosques and is one of the few structures in Cairo closely resembling the \"classical\" Ottoman style of the 16th century. It is located in the Northern Enclosure, just northeast of the Harim Palace (Military Museum). It was built on the ruins of the earlier Mosque of Sidi Sariyya built by Abu-Mansur Qasta, an amir in the Fatimid era (predating the Citadel). Qasta's tomb, dated to 1140 CE, still exists in the mosque today.\n\nMosque of al-'Azab\nThis lesser-known mosque is situated right behind the main western gate, Bab al-'Azab. Both are named after the Ottoman military regiments known as 'Azaban (or Azaps) who were housed in this part of the Citadel during the Ottoman period. The mosque was built by the Mamluk amir Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697, but it has been argued that it incorporates, or was a renovation of, an earlier Mamluk mosque or religious structure. Although not publicly accessible, it can be spotted by its pointed Ottoman-style minaret.\n\nMuseums\nThe Citadel also contains several museums:\n\nEgyptian Military museum\nThe official museum of the Egyptian Army. The museum was established in 1937 at the old building of the Egyptian Ministry of War in downtown Cairo. It was later moved to a temporary location in the Garden City district of Cairo. In November 1949 the museum was moved to the Harem Palace at the Cairo citadel. It has been renovated several times since, in 1982 and 1993.\n\nAl-Gawhara Palace Museum\nAlso known as Bijou Palace, is a palace and museum commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1814. The palace was designed and constructed by artisans contracted from a variety of countries, including Greeks, Turks, Bulgarians and Albanians. Muhammad Ali's official divan or audience hall, where the pasha received guests, contains a 1,000 kg chandelier sent to him by Louis Philippe I of France. The palace also contains the throne of Muhammad Ali Pasha that was a gift from the King of Italy.\n\nCarriage Museum\nInaugurated in 1983, it houses a collection of unique Royal Carriages attributed to different historical periods, from the reign of Khedive Ismail until the reign of King Farouk, in addition to other collection of unique antiques related to the carriages.\n\nPolice Museum\nThe museum (also sometimes referred to as the Prison Museum) is just north of the gate known as Bab al-'Alam, on a terrace commanding sweeping views of the city below. It is housed in the Citadel's former prison and contains exhibits on topics such as famous political assassinations and displays of the murder weapon used.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCairo Citadel (Arabic)\nQal'a (Citadel) at ArchNet",
          "summary": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"",

It belongs to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\n\nName and description\nThe Hanging Church is named for its location above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, the Roman fortress in Coptic Cairo (Old Cairo); its nave is suspended over a passage. The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it \"the Staircase Church\". The land surface has risen by some six metres since the Roman period, so the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position.\nThe entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.\n\nHistory\nThe Hanging Church was probably built during the patriarchate of Isaac, though an earlier church building may have elsewhere existed  dating as early as the 3rd or 4th century. However, the earliest mention of the church was a statement in the biography of the patriarch Joseph I (831–849), when the governor of Egypt visited the establishment. The church was largely rebuilt by the Pope Abraham (975–978) and has seen many other restorations including an extensive repair and restoration of the church and its surroundings completed in 2011. Objects of historical interest that were no longer of service went to the Coptic Museum. A set of 10 wooden panels from a door at the church  that were engraved with Christian iconography in 1300 AD can be found in the British Museum.\nThe Babylon Fortress was a citadel built by the Romans and its origin is disputed by Coptic historians. Some date its origin to the nineteenth century B.C, after Pharaoh Sesostris defeated the Babylonians and took the prisoners of Egypt as slaves. The prisoners rebelled, building a fortress around their home which became known as Babylon. Others believe the fortress was built in the late sixth century B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after conquering Egypt. The Hanging Church was erected over the citadel's old south Bastions, which marked the main gate to the fortress, and gives the church its ‘hanging’ feature. Beneath the church is the old atrium entrance, with niched walls that once contained statues. Superimposed columns and brick arches were later added to provide reinforcement for the building.\nThe Hanging Church is among the earliest churches in Cairo, competing only with Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, or Abu Sargah. The church was restored in the sixth century, erasing much of the evidence of the church's origin. Carved reliefs, believed to belong to the earlier structure, closely resemble those found in the first Syrian churches, which can be dated to the third or fourth century. There is also a carved beam over the entranceway which can be dated to 284 AD., the starting date for the Coptic era.  \nIn 840 AD, governor Ali ibn Yahia the Armenian partially destroyed the church during a conflict with the patriarch Anba Yusab. It was later converted into a mosque until the tenth century, when it was reconsecrated. In the eleventh century, the Hanging church became the residence of the Coptic patriarchate, previously in Alexandria.\nPope Abraham (975-978) commissioned one of the first major restorations of the church. The church has also undergone restorations during the reigns of Caliph Haroun El Rasid, El-Aziz Bi'Allah Al Fatemi and Al-Zaher Al Eazaz Din Allah. In 1983, the chapel ceiling collapsed when an engineer had removed an interior column, damaging much of the artwork inside. The 1992 Cairo earthquake caused further damage to the walls of the structure, leading to an additional restoration in 1998 that was completed in 2011.\n\nImportance\nThe Hanging Church is the most famous Coptic Christian church in Cairo, as well as possibly the first built in basilican style.\nThe church is the site of several reported Marian apparitions. She is said to have appeared in a dream to Pope Abraham in the 970s in the story of how the Mokattam Mountain was moved by the faith of Simon the Tanner.\n\nReligious significance\nThe Hanging Church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and contains sanctuaries to her and Saints John the Baptist and George. The church held many important ceremonies for the Coptic hierarchy of Cairo. These include the selection and burial of patriarchs, the former occurring from the 11th to 14th centuries while the latter only between the 11th and 12th, as well as the consecration of holy oil and judgement of heresy trials; selection of the date of Easter for every year was another important proceeding held within. These processes are held at the Hanging Church due to the movement in the 11th century of the patriarchal seat to Cairo from Alexandria.\n\nSeat of Coptic Pope\nThe Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria was, historically, Alexandria. However, as ruling powers moved away from Alexandria to Cairo after the Muslim conquest of Egypt during Pope Christodolos's tenure, Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope at the Hanging Church in 1047.\nInfighting between the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the el Muʿallaqah (the Hanging Church) broke out due to that patriarch's desire to be consecrated in the Hanging Church, a ceremony that traditionally took place at Saints Sergius and Bacchus.\n\nIcons and decoration\nThe Hanging Church has 110 icons, the oldest of which dates back to the 8th century, but most of them date to the 18th century. Nakhla Al-Baraty Bey gave some of them as gifts, in 1898, when he was the overseer of the church.\n\nLayout architectural features\nPresent structure of the church comprises the primitive church in the south and a principal church to the north, believed to be built between the third to seventh century and between the fifth to seventh century respectively.\nThe principal church is a basilica plan contained within a rectangular outer wall and features three apses. Its nave is surrounded by three aisles.\nIts layout is double-aisled but lacks transepts. The ambon (pulpit) features 15 Islamic columns mounted on a white marble slab.\nBy the late 19th century, the primitive church consisted of three chapels and a baptistery and was connected to the south nave of the principal church by the first chapel.\nThe church was periodically altered and restored in response to plundering. This reconstruction included the addition of a barrier wall during the reign of caliph al-Hakim.\n\nNotable features\nCertain original components of the churches were destroyed or damaged due to neglect. Modern replacements date to the 19th century.\n\nAltars\nOf the three ancient altars typical of Coptic churches, none remained by the 19th century and were instead replaced by marble slabs.\n\nCiboria\nThe original ciboria were reported to have been present at the altars but were since replaced.\n\nMosaics and reliefs\nMosaics in crosses in relief are found within an ambo located north of the principal church's central nave. The primitive church contains mosaics in a hollow in the south wall.\n\nFacade and interior\nSee also\nChristian Egypt\nCoptic architecture — information on Coptic Orthodox Churches\nList of Coptic Orthodox churches in Egypt\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Hanging Church at Wikimedia Commons",

According to local folklore, it is located on the site where baby Moses was found.\nIt is also known as 'the Synagogue of the Palestinians' or 'of the Jerusalemites'.\nGiven the small population of Egyptian Jews, the synagogue is no longer active and is largely a tourism site and Jewish museum.\nThe geniza or store room of the synagogue was found in the 19th century to contain a treasure of forgotten, stored-away Hebrew, Aramaic and Judeo-Arabic secular and sacred manuscripts. The collection of approximately 400,000 items, known as the Cairo Geniza, was brought to the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England at the instigation of Solomon Schechter. It is now divided between several academic libraries, with the majority being kept at the Cambridge University Library.\n\nHistory\nOutline\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue has occupied at least three buildings in its long history. There have been many major and minor renovations. The current building dates from the 1890s. \nIn a courtyard behind the buildings is the Well of Moses, in a fenced enclosure with a protective grill on its top. In local folklore, this is where the biblical Moses, as an infant, was hidden by his mother Jocheved, and watched over by his sister Miriam, until found and adopted by the Pharoah's daughter; and where Mary drew water to bathe the infant Jesus.\n\nEstablishment\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue's founding date is unknown, although there is good evidence from documents found in the geniza that it predates 882 CE and is probably pre-Islamic. In 882, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church sold a church and its grounds to a group of Jews, and some 19th-century scholars have assumed that this was the origin of Ben Ezra. However, the buyers were followers of the Talmudic academies in Babylonia, and Ben Ezra was a congregation that observed the teachings of the rival Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina. Modern scholars agree that the 882 land sale was to a rival synagogue.\nLittle is known about the original building. In about 1012, the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of all Jewish and Christian places of worship. The original Ben Ezra Synagogue was torn down, \"its bricks and timber sold for scrap\".\n\nSecond building (11th century – 1168)\nThe next caliph, al-Zahir li-i'zaz Din Allah, allowed the reconstruction of Christian and Jewish institutions, and the synagogue was rebuilt in the 1025–1040 period. Study of a carved wood Torah ark door reliably attributed to the synagogue sheds light on the history of the synagogue's renovations. The door is jointly owned by the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, and the Yeshiva University Museum in New York. Radiocarbon dating verifies that the wood dates from the 11th century CE.\n\nGeniza\nHistorically, synagogues have included a genizah, or repository for abandoned or outdated documents containing the name of God, since Jewish teaching is that such papers had to be stored with reverence, and then eventually buried in a cemetery. The 11th-century building incorporated an unusually large geniza, \"two stories high, more silo than attic – with a rooftop opening accessible from above.\" Some documents added to it had been stored in the previous building, and the oldest dated document is about 150 years older than the geniza itself. Documents continued to accumulate there for about 850 years. The diverse collection of documents included rabbinical texts, historical accounts, and religious and secular poems, dating from the sixth century through the nineteenth century CE.\n\n1168 fire\nIn 1168, a deliberately set fire destroyed much of the city of Fustat, where the synagogue was then located. Fustat is now a part of Cairo. The Islamic vizier Shawar ordered the city burned to prevent it from falling into the hands of an invading Christian Crusader army. Saladin, who became Sultan of Egypt shortly thereafter, ordered the rebuilding of Fustat.\n\nThird building\nMaimonides in Fustat (1168–1204)\nAlso in 1168, the Jewish philosopher, physician and astronomer Maimonides settled in Fustat, within a short walk of Ben Ezra Synagogue. He lived there until his death in 1204. Maimonides became Nagid, or leader of the Egyptian Jewish community in 1171, and worshipped at Ben Ezra. Many of the geniza documents, including some in his own handwriting, discuss his life and work, and are the most important primary biographical sources for him.\n\nTorah ark\nThe style of the carving on the Torah ark door is incompatible with that of the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171 CE), and is more representative of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1571 CE), specifically the 15th century. A medallion that decorates the door is designed with a motif common to bookbinding of that period. It is known that a 15th-century fire in the synagogue damaged the bimah, or pulpit. One plausible theory is that wood from the damaged bimah was repurposed to make a new door for the Torah ark. The synagogue was repaired and renovated in 1488.\nThe door also has traces of paint that conservators have identified as being no older than 19th century. It is known that the synagogue was renovated in the 1880s, completely rebuilt in the early 1890s, and then remodeled in the early 20th century.\n\nDiscovery of the geniza and fourth building\nJacob Saphir was a Jew born in what is today Belarus whose family settled in Ottoman Palestine when he was a boy. He became a rabbi, and in 1859, took a world tour to raise money for the reconstruction of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Muslim authorities in 1721. Saphir was the first to recognize the historic significance of the Ben Ezra geniza, which he described in an 1874 book. Jewish book collector Elkan Nathan Adler was the first Western European to enter the geniza in 1896, when he purchased a sackful of selected documents. In December 1896, Cambridge University instructor Solomon Schechter, who later became a prominent American rabbi, began the first in-depth academic investigation of the documents from the geniza, and arranged to have a large selection removed from Cairo to his university library. While the synagogue was being rebuilt from 1889 to 1892, the documents lay in an enormous pile out in the open. Egyptologist Count Riamo d'Hulst, arriving after Schechter's departure, hired a team of workers and spent 55 days excavating and examining as much of the documents as he could, and in May 1898 sent 16 large sacks of material to the Bodleian Library.\n\nDwindling congregation\nEgypt's Jewish community is at the end of a dramatic decline, from about 80,000 people in the 1920s to less than a dozen of Egyptian ancestry residing in Cairo after 2014. Accordingly, the Ben Ezra Synagogue functions now as a tourist attraction and museum, rather than as a functioning congregation.\n\nRenovations\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly inaugurated the synagogue on 31 August 2023 following a decade-long renovation. The renovation was completed by the Drop of Milk Association that works to preserve Egyptian Jewish heritage. The synagogue's ceiling was reinforced to prevent collapse, the library was heavily restored, and the building was further cleaned and insulated. Given the small population of Egyptian Jews, the renovation was largely done to improve tourism to the synagogue. In December 2023 it was reported that there were tensions between the surviving Jews and the government authority responsible for managing the site.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCairo Geniza\nHistory of the Jews in Egypt\nSynagogues in Cairo\nList of synagogues in Egypt\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"Ben Ezra Synagogue after restoration\".

          "content": "Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs. The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single building in the area; today it refers to the entire shopping district.\n\nHistory\nThe site of Khan el-Khalili in Fatimid times (10th-12th centuries)\nCairo was originally founded in 969 CE as a capital for the Fatimid Caliphate, an empire which by then covered much of North Africa and parts of the Levant and the Hijaz. Jawhar al-Siqilli, the general who conquered Egypt for the Fatimids, was ordered to construct a great palace complex to house the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two palaces were eventually completed: an eastern one (the larger of the two) and a western one, between which was a plaza known as Bayn al-Qasrayn (lit. 'Between the Two Palaces'). The site of Khan el-Khalili today was originally the southern end of the eastern Fatimid palace as well as the location of the burial site of the Fatimid caliphs: a mausoleum known as Turbat az-Za'faraan ('the Saffron Tomb'). Also located here was a lesser palace known as al-Qasr al-Nafi'i (today the site of the 19th-century Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar).\nUnder the Fatimids, Cairo was a palace-city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operation of the regime and its city. The first attempts to open the city to merchants and other outsiders took place in the later Fatimid period, on the initiative of powerful viziers. Between 1087 and 1092, Badr al-Jamali, the vizier under Caliph al-Mustansir, undertook the task of enlarging the city and building the stone walls and gates that still partly exist today. At the same time, he also opened the city to the common people, but the decision was quickly reversed. Between 1121 and 1125, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, vizier under Caliph al-Amir, undertook many reforms and construction projects, including the creation of a mint, known as the Dar al-Darb, and of a customs house for foreign merchants, known as the Dar al-Wikala. These were placed in a central location not far from the current site of the 15th-century Madrasa of al-Ashraf Barsbay. This introduced foreign trade into the heart of the city for the first time.\n\nDevelopment of Cairo as economic center (12th-14th centuries)\nCairo was only definitively opened to all people under the rule of Saladin, who dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 and embarked on the construction of a new fortified Citadel further south, outside the walled city, which would house Egypt's rulers and state administration. The old Fatimid palaces in the city were opened up to redevelopment. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by everyday Egyptians and frequented by foreign travelers. At the same time, the nearby port city and former capital of Fustat, until then the economic hub of Egypt, was in a slow decline, further paving the way for Cairo's ascendance.\nThe main axis of Cairo was the central north-to-south street known as the Qasaba (now known as al-Muizz Street), which ran between the gates of Bab al-Futuh and Bab Zuweila and passed through Bayn al-Qasrayn. Under the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, this avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments. These constructions were usually sponsored by the sultan or members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone for international trade and commercial activity thereafter.\nAn important factor in the development of Cairo's economic center was the growing number of waqf institutions, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. Funding sources often included the revenues of designated shops or other commercial establishments. Among the early and important examples of this institution in Cairo's center was the complex of Sultan Qalawun, built in 1284–85, which included a madrasa, hospital, and mausoleum. A part of the complex's revenues came from a qaysariyya (a bazaar or market complex made up of rows of shops) that was built in front of the nearby Ayyubid-era madrasa of al-Salih. This qaysariyya was a prominent early example of the purpose-built commercial structures that came to be erected in Cairo under the Mamluks as part of a waqf. Qalawun's qaysariyya had a front on the Qasaba street while some of its shops were reached by an inner alley off the main street.\n\nFoundation of Khan al-Khalili in the Mamluk period (14th-15th centuries)\nOver many years, space along the Qasaba avenue steadily narrowed as new constructions encroached on it and open spaces disappeared. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were instead built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where some space was still available. Instead of hosting mobile market stalls that were assembled in open spaces, the city's souq areas were progressively replaced by fixed stone structures with built-in spaces for individual shops. This was partly a consequence of the authorities wishing to impose greater control on commercial activities: fixed structures could be counted, taxed, and regulated more easily than makeshift market stalls that could come and go. As the city became denser and space ran out, builders preferred to build multi-storied structures known as a khan (Arabic: خان) or a wikala (Arabic: وكالة), a type of caravanserai (inns for merchants). These types of buildings were centered around an inner peristyle courtyard where merchants could store their goods, while the upper levels were used as living quarters. Their street facades typically had spaces for shops at ground level. In this way, a commercial zone could extend around and between multiple khans.\nBy the time of Sultan Barquq (r. 1382–1399), the first Burji Mamluk sultan, Egypt had been significantly affected by the ravages of the Black Death but continued to be the center of great economic activity, with many commercial and religious buildings still being constructed at this time. During Barquq's first reign (1382–1389) his Master of the Stables (amir akhur), Jaharkas al-Khalili, demolished the Fatimid mausoleum (Turbat az-Za'faraan) to erect a large khan at the heart of the city. The khan became known as Khan al-Khalili, after his name. The name eventually came to denote the entire district. Al-Khalili reportedly disposed of the bones of the Fatimid royal family by throwing them into the rubbish hills east of the city.\nLater Mamluk elites also built commercial structures in the vicinity and beyond. In Sultan Qaytbay's time one of his amirs, Yashbak min Mahdi, built the Rab' al-Badistan, an apartment complex for renters, just across from the Khan al-Khalili. Qaytbay himself built the Wikala of Sultan Qaytbay further east, near al-Azhar Mosque. By the late 15th century, the district around Khan el-Khalili had become the major center of foreign trade, including the sale of slaves and precious stones.\n\nRe-development by Sultan al-Ghuri (early 16th century)\nIn the early 16th century, Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypt's last effective Mamluk sultan (r. 1501–1516), modified the layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large Wikala named after him nearby, he demolished the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511. It became known as the Khan al-Fisqiya (\"Khan of the Fountain\") for centuries, until later being known as the Wikala al-Qutn (\"Wikala of Cotton\"). Al-Ghuri also reconfigured the adjacent area into a souq known as the Suq al-Nabulsi, which featured monumental stone gates. He also tried to impose a more regular grid plan on the surrounding district. Along with the stone gates, this sort of complex resembled what in Ottoman cities was known as a bedesten: a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold and which often had roofed streets and locked gates at night (similar in some ways to a qaysariyya). It is possible that al-Ghuri's construction was done in imitation of such commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, as this was a time when the Ottoman Empire was the major rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkish merchants were increasingly prominent in Cairo.\nWhat remains today from al-Ghuri's time is the Suq al-Nabulsi and its two ornate stone gates, as well as the façade and entrance of the Wikala al-Qutn. All these structures are located along the street known as Sikkat al-Badistan. The western gate was originally known as Bab al-Silsila but is known today as Bab al-Badistan, while the eastern gate, across from the Wikala al-Qutn's entrance, was originally known as Bab al-Nuhhas but is now known also as Bab al-Ghuri.\n\nLater history (16th century and after)\nFrom the Mamluk period onward, the Khan al-Khalili area was made up of several major khans or wikalas grouped together, with souq streets existing between them. By the end of the Mamluk period in the early 16th century, there were 21 khans and wikalas in the district. From al-Ghuri's reign onward, the district became associated with Turkish merchants and during the Ottoman period (after 1517) the Turkish community of Cairo was centered here. The Wikala al-Qutn, which had replaced the original Khan al-Khalili structure, was inhabited by Turkish merchants.During the Ottoman period the prosperity of Cairo's souqs waxed and waned in accordance with local political conditions and international economic conditions. While Cairo was no longer an imperial capital, it still played a highly important role in the trade networks of the Ottoman Empire. New khans and wikalas continued to be built. The construction of new commercial buildings began to shift to the west of the Qasaba avenue as this was the only area where there was still space to build. New constructions were relatively rare in the 16th century but became more common again in the 17th century. Many old buildings were also restored, altered, or rebuilt, especially during the 18th century. In contrast with the Mamluk period, new religious complexes were rarely built, but many small mosques or prayer areas were added inside existing commercial buildings. By the end of the 18th century, just before Napoleon's invasion, some 39 khans and wikalas existed in the area of Khan al-Khalili and its adjoining districts. One late example of a large wikala built in the heart of Khan al-Khalili is the Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar (or Wikala al-Silahdar), built in 1837 to replace a ruined Mamluk-era khan. It is still partially standing today, directly across from Bab al-Ghuri.\nThe district underwent significant modifications and re-developments again in the 19th and 20th centuries alongside major developments in the urban fabric of modern Cairo to the west. Al-Muski Street, a popular market street today, was created by cutting across the fabric of the old city to create a street roughly perpendicular to al-Muizz Street (the old Qasaba avenue). It runs from al-Hussein Square in the east to Midan 'Ataba ('Ataba Square) in modern downtown Cairo to the west. Among other important re-developments was the construction of about two dozen new residential blocs with ground-level shops in the eastern sector of the souq, initiated by the princess Shawikar in the late 1930s. This eastern area is now one of the most frequented by tourists.\n\nPresent day\nThe Khan el-Khalili today is occupied by local merchants and traders and is significantly geared towards tourists. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewelry. The adjoining goldsmiths' souq is still important for locals. Although less widespread than in earlier days, many crafts workshops continue to operate within the bazaar (usually in the courtyards or upper floors of buildings) and in the surrounding districts, manufacturing some of the products sold here or exported elsewhere.\nIn addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses (Arabic: مقهى, romanized: maqha), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. The coffeeshops are generally small and quite traditional, serving Arabic coffee and usually offering shisha. One of the oldest and most famous coffeehouses is El-Fishawy Café, established in 1773.\n\nThe Khan al-Khalili proper is delimited by al-Muizz Street to the west, al-Muski Street to the south, and the Mosque/shrine of al-Hussein to the east, with its northern boundary less clear. In reality though, the bazaar area spreads beyond these limits and is closely integrated into the surrounding districts.  For example, al-Muski street, which runs perpendicular to al-Muizz street and cuts across the south end of Khan al-Khalili, continues over a long distance and functions as a major souq street frequented by locals for much of its length.\nIn addition to the important Mosque and shrine of al-Hussein, Al-Azhar University and the Al-Azhar Mosque are also nearby. The monumental area of Bayn al-Qasrayn is also just northwest of the district. Some of its historic Islamic buildings were once maintained with the help of revenues from designated shops and commercial buildings in the area.\n\nIn literature\nNaguib Mahfouz's novel Midaq Alley (1947) is set in an alley in Khan el-Khalili.\nPivotal events of Neal Stephenson's novel The Confusion (2004), which is the second book of his The Baroque Cycle series, are set in the caravanserai within Khan el-Khalili.\nMohammed Avdol, one of the main characters of Stardust Crusaders, the third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, owns a fortune-telling shop in Khan el-Khalili.\nP. Djeli Clark's short story The Angel of Khan el-Khalili takes place in this area and other parts of Cairo.\n\nTerrorist attacks\n\nThe market was a target of terrorism during the spate of attacks in Cairo in April 2005. The suicide attack in the market, on April 7, killed 21 people (eleven Egyptians, two French tourists, one American, and seven foreigners of unidentified origin). It was the first attack in the series; this attack drove away tourists from Egypt in general and Khan el-Khalili in particular for some time.\nThe market was again a target of terrorism on 22 February 2009. In this attack a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 22 people were injured.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "content": "خان الخليلي، أحد شياخات حي وسط القاهرة بالمنطقة الغربية في محافظة القاهرة، ويتمتع بجذب سياحي كبير بالنسبة لزوار القاهرة ومصر بشكل عام. يتميز بوجود أسواق وبازارات ومحلات ومطاعم شعبية، كما يتميز بكثرة أعداد السياح واعتياد سكانه عليهم.\nحي خان الخليلي كان مصدر إلهام للعديد من الكتّاب والأدباء المصريين أبرزهم الكاتب نجيب محفوظ الذي ألّف إحدى رواياته التي تدور أحداثها بالحي وتحمل اسمه «خان الخليلي» والتي تم تحويلها إلى فيلم سينمائي من بطولة الممثل عماد حمدي.\n\nتاريخ خان الخليلي\nيبلُغ عُمر حيّ «خان الخليلي» العتيق، 600 عام، حيثُ يُعتبر واحدًا من أقدم الأسواق في أنحاء المحروسة والشرق الأوسط، وما زال مُحتفظًا بمعماره القديم مُنذُ عصر المماليك، حسبمّا تؤكد الهيئة العامة للإستعلامات المصرية.\nفلم يتأثر خان الخليل بعوامل الزمن، وظل مُلهمًا للأدباء والفنانين، فيُحرّض أخيلتهم دائمًا على الإبداع، مثلما كتبَ، نجيب محفوظ، روايتهُ «خان الخليلي» من وحيّ أجواء الحيّ القديم، واصفًا إياه بـ: «ستجِد في الشارع الطويل، عِمارات مُربعة القوائم تصِل بينها ممرات جانبية تقاطع الشارع الأصليّ، وتزحُم جوانب الممرات والشارع نفسه بالحوانيت (أيّ الدُكان)؛ فدُكان للساعاتي وخطاط وأخر للشاي، ورابع للسجاد وخامس للتُحف وهكذا. بينما يقع هُنا وهناك مقاهي لا يزيد حجم الواحدة منها عن حجم الحانوت (الدُكان) الصغير، وقدّ جلسَ الصنَّاع أمام الدكاكين يكبون على فنونهم في صبر.\nوُيذكر أنّ الخان هو مبنى على شكل مربع كبير، ويحيط بفناء يُشبه الوكالة، فيما تضُم الطبقة الوسطى منهُ المحلات، أما الطبقات العليا فتحتضِن المخازن والمساكن، بينما ترجع تسميتُه إلى صاحب أمر إنشاءه عام 784هجريًا، أيّ 1382 ميلاديًا، وهو الأمير جهاركس الخليلي، أحد الأمراء المماليك، من الخليل فلسطين، وتروي الحكايات التاريخية إنّهُ بعد مقتل الخليلي في دمشق، أزالَ السلطان المملوكي قنصوه الغوري الخان، وأقامَ مكانُه وكالات ودكاكين للتُجار، فاكتسب المكان طابع تاريخيّ مُحلىَ بآثار المماليك.\nولو عدنا بالزمان إلى الوراء كثيراً فسوف يطالعنا المؤرخ العربي الأشهر (المقريزي) الذي يقول إن الخان مبنى مربع كبير يحيط بفناء ويشبه الوكالة، تشمل الطبقة السفلي منه الحوانيت، وتضم الطبقات العليا المخازن والمساكن، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى منشئه الشريف (الخليلي) الذي كان كبير التجار في عصر السلطان برقوق عام 1400 م.\nوإذا كان المثل الشعبي يقول: إن «الرجل تدب مكان ما تحب»، فإن أول دبة على أرض الخان لا بد أن تكون في مقهى الفيشاوي، الذي يزيد عمره عن مائتي عام، وهو من أقدم مقاهي القاهرة، وكان الكاتب الكبير نجيب محفوظ من أشهر روّاده في فترة الستينات من القرن العشرين .\n\nمقهى الفيشاوي\nيعتبر من المقاهي القديمة في مصر ويرجع تاريخ تأسيسه عام 1769م.\nعبقرية المكان في مقهى الفيشاوي الذي يتصدر الخان تستطيع أن تحتسي الشاي الأخضر، وتثرثر في أي شيء كيفما شئت، قبل أن تبدأ الجولة في الحي العتيق وليس هناك ماهو أمتع من التجوال سيراً على الأقدام داخل أزقة وحواري تحتاج إلى عبقرية في فك ألغازها، وإلى حاسة سادسة لمعرفة طلاسمها، فالأزقة متراصة كحبات عقد، متداخلة كقوس قزح متعدد الألوان، ولايعرف أحد حتى الآن الفلسفة المعمارية التي بني على أساسها خان الخليلي، فالأرض مبلطة بحجر بازلتي أسود لامع، والسوق مسقوف بخشب تحدى الزمن وعوامل التعرية، والشمس تتسلل إلى حوانيت عديدة تشكل مع بعضها سراديب مليئة بالكنوز والتحف النادرة، والمصنوعة بمهارة.\n\nداخل الخان\nوإذا بدأت الرحلة في الخان فلابد وأن تلقي نظرة على ماتبقى من (مشربيات) مطلة على الشارع أو الحارة، وأسبلة جميلة مشغولة واجهاتها بالنحاس وفيها أحواض الماء التي كانت تروي العطشان وعابر السبيل في الزمن الذي كان. ويحتاج زائر الحي إلى عبقرية أو حساسية خاصة في المرور داخل الأزقة الضيقة وسط زحام أسطوري من البشر والمقاعد الخشبية التي رصها أصحاب المقاهي لجذب الرواد، وبمجرد أن تدخل الشارع يتناهى إلى الأسماع عبارات الترحيب المصرية خفيفة الظل، وكلمات أولاد البلد المرحبة تدعو الزائرات والزائرين للفرجة، «واللي مايشتري يتفرج». ولو دخلت أحد الحوانيت فإن البائع يستقبلك بعبارة «مصر نورت» ويرد الزائر الذي له خبرة بعالم القاهرة السحري ومفرداتها اللغوية «مصر منوره بأهلها»، ويبدأ في عرض ما لديه من بضائع، لاتفارقه ابتسامته، وكلماته المتدفقة حول جودة بضاعته، وأنها صنعت خصيصاً لعشاق الفن اليدوي. وتجار الخان خبراء في فن البيع، ورثوا التجارة والشطارة عن الأجداد، وهم يعرضون الأصيل والمزيف من البضائع، ولهم ولع عجيب بالمساومة، كما يتسمون بصبر وجلد على إقناع الزبون.\nحي خان الخليلي هو واحد من ثمانية وثلاثين سوقاً كانت موزعة أيام المماليك على محاور القاهرة، ويقع هذا الخان وسط المدينة القديمة فوق مقابر الخلفاء الفاطميين سابقاً.\nوكان المعز لدين الله قد استحضر معه من (القيروان) توابيت ثلاثة من أسلافه ودفنهم في مقبرته، حيث دفن هو وخلفاؤه أيضاً، وقد أمر الخليلي بنقل المقابر إلى أماكن أخرى وتأسيس سوق للتجار.\nوالأسلوب الذي كانت تعرض به البضائع في القاهرة القديمة حيث كانت تتلاصق الأسواق وتمتلئ الحارات بالحوانيت التي تعرض نفس البضاعة بأسعار متفاوتة، أمر أشبه مايكون بمعرض دائم ومستمر للبضائع المختلفة، ممايتيح فرصة ممتازة للمشتري في أن ينتقى مايريد ويختار الأجود، ويفاصل ويساوم ليحصل على الأمتن والأرخص.\nهنا بضائع من كل صنف ولون، من الذهب والماس والفضة إلى أوراق البردي التي تحمل كلمات الهيروغليفية وتمائم وأيقونات وقصائد غزلية، ونقوشات باللون الأزرق تحكي في اختزال مدهش أجمل حكاية عشق في التاريخ (حكاية إيزيس وأوزوريس) التي يقبل عليها السياح الأجانب.\n\nمهرجان البضائع\nكرنفال الزائرات والزائرين لحي خان الخليلي يتداخل مع ملابس مزركشة رصها أصحاب الحوانيت كنوع من العرض والإغراء والجذب على واجهة المحلات، وتتدلى مئات وربما آلاف (المسابح) داخل فترينات العرض، أو في أيدى صبية صغار يعرضون أنواعاً شتى من المسابح، بعضها مصنوع من بذر الزيتون والبلاستيك وتسمى (نور الصباح)، وبعضها الآخر ينتمي لفصيلة الفيروز والمرجان والكهرمان واليسر، ومنها مايصنع من خشب الصندل، ويقول أحد الصناع المهرة إن المسبحة تصنع على آلة يدوية صغيرة ودقيقة اسمها (المخرطة).\nوفي خان الخليلي تحرص النساء من كل الجنسيات على شراء (العقد) الذي تتدلى منه (عين حورس)، وتصنع العقود من خامات شتى، وما على الزبون إلا تحديد طلبه وفق إمكاناته المالية، وهنا يخرج له البائع (تحفة فنية) ربما مر على صناعتها مئات السنين، يوم أن كانت القاهرة في العصور الوسطى مركزاً تجارياً عظيماً، تجلب بضائع الشرق الأقصى وترسلها في شتى طرق الملاحة في البحر الأبيض المتوسط. كان ذلك في العصر الذهبي لتجارة التوابل مع بلاد الهند والسند وبلاد تركب الأفيال وتشترى الرجال، ففي القرن السادس عشر نقل إلى خان الخليلي أغرب سوق في تاريخ القاهرة القديمة والحديثة، وهو سوق (العبيد) الذي ذاع صيته في الشرق والغرب ووصفه الرحالة باعتباره من أهم الأسواق التي اختلطت فيها جميع الجنسيات.\nلقد انتهي ذلك العصر بكل مافيه من ملامح عظيمة أو تجاعيد انهيار، ونحن الآن في عصر جديد مختلف، ينظر فيه السائحون والزوار إلى البضائع المتناثرة في الأرجاء والفاترينات على أنها (هدية) من قاهرة المعز لدين الله الفاطمي، وفي المحلات الصغيرة المتلاصقة إبداع التجار في رص المشغولات الذهبية والفضية والنحاسية.\nويذكرك مشهد هذه المحلات بأسواق تركيا التي تسمى (البازار) والتي تحتل شوارع هائلة تقع تحت مدينة (أسطنبول) حيث تمتد شوارع بكاملها تتخصص بنوع واحد من البضائع. على أن أهم مايلفت النظر في مشغولات خان الخليلي هو دقة الصناعة اليدوية، هناك محلات تعرض قلادة أو أسورة عليها نقوشات ومنمنمات قضى في نقشها صانع ماهر أياماً وربما شهور. والذهب هو الذهب مهما مر الزمان أو تغيرت الأوطان، والسياح الأجانب يحرصون على شراء المشغولات الفضية، لكن السياح العرب يحبون الذهب، وقد زحفت محلات من شارع الصاغة الشهير إلى خان الخليلي بحثاً عن (زبون) رفيع الذوق، يقدر ما بين يديه من نفائس.\n\nأسواق القاهرة\nكان في القاهرة الفاطمية أسواق متعددة، وساحات عامة شيدت لأغراض التجارة وهي التي تسمى كل منها (قيسارية) وقد خصصت كل واحدة منها لبيع سلعة معينة، وبعضها يبيع الأشياء التي تجلبها القوافل من الحبشة مثل العقاقير والببغاوات والتبر، وقد كان هناك أسواق خاصة للأحجار الكريمة في شارع الموسكي، لكنه استقر الآن في خان الخليلي، عقيق ومرجان، زمرد وفيروز وأنواع أخرى من أحجار هندية، ويمنية وحبشية تجذب السياح وتخطف أبصارهم.\n\nالعطور والبخور\nوتسبح في الفضاء روائح جميلة تصل إلى السائح الذي يعبر الزقاق في اتجاه شارع الموسكي حيث تكثر تجارة العطور العربية والآسيوية والأوروبية، هنا عطر الملك، والعنبر، والياسمين والفل، مئات وربما الآن زجاجات ذات أشكال وألوان غريبة تحتوى عطوراً غير مألوفة تتراوح ألوانها ما بين الزيتي في لون البترول الخام، والأصفر الذهبي، والبنفسجي الممزوج بالعنبر. ونسأل تاجر يتحدى الزمن بابتسامة عن (الأسانس) الذي يتم تصنيع هذه العطور منه فقال إن ما أراه من عطور هنا يكاد يكون هو التركيبة الفعلية للعطر بدون إضافة كحول تذكر إليه، وناولني زجاجة تحتوي عطراً زيتي الملمس، فاقع الأريج وقال إن هذا العطر يتم استخلاصه من نوع معين من ذكور الغزال يسمى وعل المسك، أما هذا الذي يخلط لونه البنفسجي بعتامة تتألق تحت الضوء فهو خلاصة البنفسج، أما زيت العنبر فيفرزه نوع واحد من الحيتان يسمى حيتان العنبر، والحوت لايفرز هذا العنبر إلا وهو يلفظ أنفاسه الأخيرة أو يعانى سكرات الموت.\nأما البخور فله مملكة خاصة في الخان، ويعتقد الناس أن دخان المستكة يمنع العين والحسد، أما الكسبرة فهي زعيمة مملكة البخور ويطلق عليها الناس اسم (الفك والفكوك) أي أن من يشمها تذهب عنه العقد بلا رجعة. أما زائر خان الخليلي فلابد أن تكون له رجعة.\n\nمعرض صور\nمراجع\n\n\n== وصلات خارجية ==",

          "content": "Abu Mena (also spelled Abu Mina; Coptic: ⲁⲃⲃⲁ ⲙⲏⲛⲁ; Arabic: أبو مينا, romanized: Abū Mīnā  pronounced [æbuˈmæyːnæ]) was a town, monastery complex and Christian pilgrimage centre in Late Antique Egypt, about 50 km (31 mi) southwest of Alexandria, near New Borg El Arab city. Its remains were designated a World Heritage Site in 1979 for the site's importance in early Christianity. There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the great basilica, are easily discernible.\nRecent agricultural efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the water table, which has caused a number of the site's buildings to collapse or become unstable. The site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2001. And was finally removed from the list in 2025. Authorities were forced to place sand in the bases of buildings that are most endangered in the site.\n\nHistory\nMenas of Alexandria was martyred in the late 3rd or early 4th century (see Early Christianity). Various 5th-century and later accounts give slightly differing versions of his burial and the subsequent founding of his church. The essential elements are that his body was taken from Alexandria on a camel, which was led into the desert beyond Lake Mareotis. At some point, the camel refused to continue walking, despite all efforts to goad it. This was taken as a sign of divine will, and the body's attendants buried it on that spot.\nMost versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. From the Ethiopian Synaxarium (E.A.W. Budge, trans.):\n\nAnd God wished to reveal the [place of the] body of Saint Mînâs. And there was in that desert a certain shepherd, and one day a sheep which was suffering from the disease of the scab went to that place, and dipped himself in the water of the little spring which was near the place, and he rolled about in it and was healed straightway. And when the shepherd saw this thing, and understood the miracle, he marvelled exceedingly and was astonished. And afterwards he used to take some of the dust from that shrine, and mix it with water, and rub it on the sheep, and if they were ill with the scab, they were straightway healed thereby. And this he used to do at all times, and he healed all the sick who came to him by this means.\nWord of the shepherd's healing powers spread rapidly. The synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding Menas' body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. (Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor Zeno, but archaeologists have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century). By the late 4th century, it was a significant pilgrimage site named Martyroupolis, where Christians sought healing and other miracles. Menas flasks are a particular type of small terracotta ampullae sold to pilgrims as containers for holy water or holy vigillamp-oil which are found very widely around the Western Mediterranean, dating roughly from the century and a half before the Muslim conquest.  They are cheaply made but impressed with images of the saint that are of significance in the study of iconography; it is presumed they were made around the city.\nDuring the reign of Arcadius, the local archbishop observed that crowds were overwhelming the small church. He wrote to the eastern emperor, who ordered a major expansion of the facilities, the first of three major church expansions which would eventually take place. By the end of Late antiquity, Abu Mena had become the leading pilgrimage site in Egypt.\nAround the mid-6th century, the port town of Philoxenite was established on the southern shore of Lake Mareotis to support pilgrimage to Abu Mena. Built on the ruins of a Roman settlement, it served as a transit hub fit equipped with rest houses where pilgrims could stay before continuing their journey. Its construction is believed to have been financed by Philoxenos, a prominent figure in Byzantine politics at the time.\nAbu Mena was destroyed during the early Muslim conquests of the mid-7th century.\n\nArchaeological excavations\nThe site was first excavated from 1905 to 1907. These efforts uncovered a large basilica church, an adjacent church which had probably housed the saint's remains, and Roman baths.\nA later, long-term series of excavations by the DAI ended in 1998. The most recent excavations uncovered a large dormitory for poor pilgrims, with separate wings for men and for women and children. A complex to the south of the great basilica was likely the residence of the hegoumenos, or abbot. Excavations suggest that the great xenodocheion, a reception area for pilgrims, may originally have been a cemetery. A baptistery, adjacent to the site of the original church, appears to have gone through at least three phases of development. Also uncovered was a complex of wine presses, including underground storage rooms, which dates to the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nThreats\nThe site of Abu Mena was added to UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list in 2001 due to the threat of rising local water tables. This rise in water is due to agricultural development programs aimed at reclaiming the land. The hard clay soil that surrounds the site can support buildings when dry. However, it becomes unstable when wet and has led to the collapse of cisterns and other structures about the ancient city. As the ground collapses, large cavities form enveloping the overlying structures. \nImmediate action was taken to fill the bases of particularly important sites with sand and close them off to the public. In attempts to counteract this phenomenon, the Supreme Council of Antiquities spent 45 million digging trenches and adding pumps in hopes of decreasing the pressure of irrigation. In addition, a fence was added to prevent encroachment and threat. These proved to be successful and the site was removed from UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list in 2009.\nSince then, water has continued to rise and cause destruction of monuments. The site was once again added to UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list, and finally removed in 2025. Factors found to negatively impact the property most recently in 2018 include housing, management activities, managements systems/plan, and water.\n\nConservation\nRecent conservation endeavors at the site of Abu Mena involve the implementation of advanced drainage systems and community engagement programs to mitigate the ongoing threats posed by rising water levels and other factors.\nThe Egyptian government has implemented emergency plans and indeed solved the problem with the water table, but the government does not currently have a thorough management plan or anything related to it. Since UNESCO requires a management plan for all the cultural and natural sites, several proposals have been made. The most reliable option is the use of a smart, sustainable membrane. It has been designed to solve issues with ventilation, energy, and water on the site. This plan involves building a dome-shaped smart membrane, which would provide the site an appropriate amount of airflow (as is required for every world heritage site). The smart-membrane dome would also provide a self-sustainable energy supply through solar cells located on the outside layer of the dome. The membrane would also be designed to have a filtration system for dehumidifying the air by filtering the water out of it so that the site can be better preserved.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nChurch of Saint Menas (Cairo)\nSaint Fana\nSaint Mina Monastery in Mariut, the modern pilgrimage site, which borders the original Abu Mena site to the north\nWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nO'Brien, Harriet (June 18, 2006). \"The World's Most Remarkable Buildings Under Threat\".

Les éléments essentiels sont que son corps a été emmené d'Alexandrie sur un chameau, qui a été conduit dans le désert au-delà du lac Maréotis. À un moment donné, le chameau a refusé de continuer à marcher, malgré tous les efforts déployés pour l'aiguillonner. Cela a été considéré comme un signe de la volonté divine et les préposés au corps l'ont enterré à cet endroit.\nSelon la plupart des versions de l'histoire, l'emplacement de la tombe fut ensuite oublié jusqu'à sa redécouverte miraculeuse par un berger local. Extrait du Synaxarium éthiopien :\n\n« Et Dieu voulut révéler le [lieu du] corps de Saint Mînâs. Et il y avait dans ce désert un certain berger, et un jour un mouton qui souffrait de la maladie de la gale alla à cet endroit, et se plongea dans l'eau de la petite source qui était près de l'endroit, et il se roula dedans et fut guéri aussitôt. Le berger, voyant cela et comprenant le miracle, s'étonna et fut très surpris. Ensuite, il prenait de la poussière de ce sanctuaire, la mélangeait avec de l'eau et la frottait sur les brebis, et si elles étaient malades de la gale, elles étaient aussitôt guéries. Il faisait cela en tout temps, et il guérissait tous les malades qui venaient à lui par ce moyen. »\n\n— E.A.W. Budge, traducteur.\nLa nouvelle des pouvoirs de guérison du berger se répandit rapidement. Le synaxarium décrit Constantin Ier envoyant sa fille malade au berger pour qu'elle soit guérie, et lui attribue la découverte du corps de Ménas, après quoi Constantin ordonna la construction d'une église sur le site. Certaines versions de l'histoire remplacent Constantin par l'empereur Zénon de la fin du Ve siècle, mais les archéologues ont daté la fondation originale à la fin du IVe siècle. À la fin du IVe siècle, c'était un lieu de pèlerinage important pour les chrétiens qui recherchaient la guérison et d'autres miracles. Les flacons de Ménas sont un type particulier de petites ampoules en terre cuite vendues aux pèlerins comme récipients pour l'eau bénite ou l'huile sainte, que l'on trouve très largement autour de la Méditerranée occidentale, datant approximativement du siècle et demi avant la conquête musulmane. Ils sont de fabrication bon marché mais imprimés d'images du saint qui ont une importance dans l'étude de l'iconographie ; on suppose qu'ils ont été fabriqués autour de la ville.\nSous le règne d'Arcadius, l'archevêque local a observé que la foule envahissait la petite église. Il écrivit à l'empereur d'Orient, qui ordonna un agrandissement majeur des installations, le premier de trois agrandissements majeurs de l'église qui allaient avoir lieu par la suite. À la fin de l'Antiquité tardive, Abou Mena était devenu le principal site de pèlerinage d'Égypte.\nAbou Mena a été détruit pendant les premières conquêtes musulmanes du milieu du VIIe siècle.\n\nFouilles archéologiques\nLe site a fait l'objet de premières fouilles de 1905 à 1907. Ces travaux ont permis de découvrir une grande église basilicale, une église adjacente qui avait probablement abrité les restes du saint, et des thermes romains.\nUne série ultérieure de fouilles de longue durée par le DAI s'est terminée en 1998. Les fouilles les plus récentes ont mis au jour un grand dortoir pour les pèlerins pauvres, avec des ailes séparées pour les hommes et pour les femmes et les enfants. Un complexe au sud de la grande basilique était probablement la résidence de l'hegoumenos, ou abbé. Les fouilles suggèrent que le grand xenodocheion, lieu d'accueil des pèlerins, était peut-être à l'origine un cimetière. Un baptistère, adjacent au site de l'église originale, semble avoir connu au moins trois phases de développement. On a également découvert un complexe de pressoirs à vin, y compris des salles de stockage souterraines, qui date des VIe et VIIe siècles.\n\nRisques\nLe site d'Abou Mena a été ajouté à la liste du patrimoine mondial en péril de l'UNESCO en 2001 en raison de la menace que représente la montée des nappes phréatiques locales. Cette montée des eaux est due aux programmes de développement agricole visant à récupérer les terres. Le sol argileux dur qui entoure le site peut supporter des bâtiments lorsqu'il est sec. Cependant, il devient instable lorsqu'il est humide et a entraîné l'effondrement de citernes et d'autres structures de la ville antique. Lorsque le sol s'effondre, de grandes cavités se forment, enveloppant les structures sus-jacentes.\nDes mesures immédiates ont été prises pour remplir de sable les bases des sites particulièrement importants et les fermer au public. Pour tenter de contrer ce phénomène, le Conseil suprême des Antiquités a dépensé quarante-cinq millions de dollars pour creuser des tranchées et ajouter des pompes dans l'espoir de diminuer la pression d'irrigation. En outre, une clôture a été ajoutée pour empêcher les empiètements et les menaces. Ces mesures se sont avérées efficaces et le site a été retiré de la liste du patrimoine mondial en péril de l'UNESCO en 2009.\nDepuis lors, l'eau a continué à monter et à causer la destruction des monuments. Le site figure à nouveau sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en péril de l'UNESCO. Les facteurs qui se sont avérés avoir un impact négatif sur le bien le plus récemment en 2018 sont le logement, les activités de gestion, les systèmes/le plan de gestion et l'eau.\n\nConservation\nLe gouvernement égyptien a mis en œuvre des plans d'urgence et a effectivement résolu le problème de la nappe phréatique, mais le gouvernement ne dispose pas actuellement d'un plan de gestion complet ou de quoi que ce soit s'y rapportant. Comme l'UNESCO exige un plan de gestion pour tous les sites culturels et naturels, plusieurs propositions ont été faites. L'option la plus fiable est l'utilisation d'une membrane intelligente et durable. Elle a été conçue pour résoudre les problèmes de ventilation, d'énergie et d'eau sur le site. Ce plan implique la construction d'une membrane intelligente en forme de dôme, qui fournirait au site une quantité appropriée de flux d'air (comme cela est requis pour chaque site du patrimoine mondial). Le dôme à membrane intelligente fournirait également un approvisionnement énergétique autonome grâce à des cellules solaires situées sur la couche extérieure du dôme. La membrane serait également conçue pour disposer d'un système de filtration permettant de déshumidifier l'air en filtrant l'eau qu'il contient afin de mieux préserver le site.\n\nPhotographies  des ruines\nNotes et références\n\n Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de l’Égypte",

          "title": "Amarna",
          "content": "Amarna (; Arabic: العمارنة, romanized: al-ʿAmārna) is an extensive ancient Egyptian archaeological site containing the ruins of Akhetaten, the capital city during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The city was established in 1346 BC, built at the direction of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and abandoned shortly after his death in 1332 BC.\nThe site is on the east bank of the Nile River, in what today is the Egyptian province of Minya. It is about 58 km (36 mi) south of the city of al-Minya, 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor (site of the previous capital, Thebes). The city of Deir Mawas lies directly to its west. On the east side of Amarna there are several modern villages, the chief of which are l-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.\nActivity in the region flourished from the Amarna Period until the later Roman era.\n\nName\nThe name Amarna comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements. The ancient Egyptian name means \"the horizon of the Aten\".\nEnglish Egyptologist Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as Alabastron, following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (On Stones) and Ptolemy (Geography), although he was not sure about the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.\n\nCity of Akhetaten\nThe area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was this city that Akhetaten described as the Aten's \"seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it\".\nIt may be that the Royal Wadi's resemblance to the hieroglyph for horizon showed that this was the place to found the city.\nThe city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mudbrick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.\nIt is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan in large part because it was abandoned almost completely shortly after the royal government of Tutankhamun quit the city in favor of Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign,  if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned, it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately 8 miles (13 km) of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population. The entire city is encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae (labeled A thru V with discontinuities left for those thought to be missing, Stele B was defaced by locals in 1885) detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.\nThe earliest dated stele from Akhenaten's new city is known to be Boundary stele K which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten's reign. (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten's foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh's wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife Nefertiti, and his eldest daughter Meritaten as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial. Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:\n\nHis Majesty mounted a great chariot of electrum, like the Aten when He rises on the horizon and fills the land with His love, and took a goodly road to Akhetaten, the place of origin, which [the Aten] had created for Himself that he might be happy therein. It was His son Wa'enrē [i.e. Akhenaten] who founded it for Him as His monument when His Father commanded him to make it. Heaven was joyful, the earth was glad every heart was filled with delight when they beheld him.\n\nThis text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten \"and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the lunettes of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays.\"\n\nSite and plan\nLocated on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a \"Royal Road\", now referred to as \"Sikhet es-Sultan\". The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the North City, with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.\n\nNorth City\nIf one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the North Riverside Palace. This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the royal family. Located within the North City area is the Northern Palace, the main residence of the royal family. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.\nThe North City was an administrative area. It contains the ruins of royal palaces, especially the Northern Palace and other administrative buildings and occupies an area between the river and the cliffs that terminate the plains to the north of the city itself.\n\nCentral City\nMost of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the Great Temple of the Aten and the Small Aten Temple were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the king and royal family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp. Located behind the Royal Residence was the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, where the Amarna Letters were found.\nThis area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.\n\nSouthern suburbs\nTo the south of the city was the area now referred to as the Southern Suburbs. It contained the estates of many of the city's powerful nobles, including Nakhtpaaten (Chief Minister), Ranefer, Panehesy (High Priest of the Aten), and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.\nFurther to the south of the city was Kom el-Nana, an enclosure, usually referred to as a sun-shade, and was probably built as a sun-temple., and then the Maru-Aten, which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for Akhenaten's queen Kiya, but on her death her name and images were altered to those of Meritaten, his daughter.\n\nCity outskirts\nSurrounding the city and marking its extent, the Boundary Stelae (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.\n\nAway from the city Akhenaten's Royal necropolis was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten's tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely Meketaten, his second daughter.\nIn the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their Tombs.\n\nLife in ancient Amarna/Akhetaten\nMuch of what is known about Amarna's founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city. These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.\nTo make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military. Ay, one of Akhenaten's principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father Yuya had been an important military leader. Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together; they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt's history under Akhenaten's father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, \"it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna.\"\n\nReligious life\nWhile the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, or perhaps more accurately, monolatrism, archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.\n\n... at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by Kemp (2008: 41–46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of Bes, the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, Taweret, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen's village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to Isis and Shed have been discovered (Watterson 1984: 158 & 208).\n\nThe Amarna letters\nIn 1887, a local woman digging for sebakh uncovered a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets (now commonly known as the Amarna Letters). These tablets recorded select diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in Akkadian, the lingua franca commonly used during the Late Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and led to a further increase in exploration.\n\nAmarna art-style\nThe Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions. Unlike the strict idealistic formalism of previous Egyptian art, it depicted its subjects more realistically. These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.\nWhile the worship of Aten was later referred to as the Amarna heresy and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.\n\nArchaeology\nThe first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by Claude Sicard, a French Jesuit priest who was travelling through the Nile Valley who described the site and made a crude sketch\nof Stela A. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by Napoleon's corps de savants in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in Description de l'Égypte between 1821 and 1830.\nAfter this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.\nThe Prussian expedition led by Richard Lepsius visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results included an improved map of the city. Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved Denkmäler plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892 Alessandro Barsanti and Urbain Bouriant partly cleared the robbed out king's tomb. In 1891 and 1892 Sir Flinders Petrie worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the Great Temple of the Aten, the Great Official Palace, the King's House, the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage, Petrie's excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded faience, glass, and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds). By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site's potential.\n\nModern excavations\nThe copyist and artist Norman de Garis Davies published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908.\nFrom 1907 until 1914 the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft expedition, led by Ludwig Borchardt, worked extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The first several years were spent doing\nsurvey work with excavation beginning in 1911. The famous bust of Nefertiti, now in Berlin's Ägyptisches Museum, was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.\nIn two seasons between 1923 and 1925 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort, Stephen Glanville, and John Pendlebury. Mary Chubb served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures. Their work resumed in\ntwo seasons between 1930 and 1932.\nExcavation resumed in the 1977 under with the Amarna Survey directed by Barry J. Kemp with the University of Cambridge and Amarna Expedition under Salvatore Garfi  under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society and continued until 1982. Work was curtailed at that point due to regional conditions but resumed in 1996 under the Amarna Project and still under the direction of Barry J. Kemp. In the 2000 season work also included the nearby arcaheologicl\nsite of Kom el-Nana and the start of a GPS survey of the region around Amarna. Much of the work during this period was at the house of the king's chief charioteer, Ranefer which had been partially excavated in 1921. A separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb.\nExcavation at Amarna, under Amarna Project, continues to the present. Work includes excavation at a cemetery, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles and at several other cemeteries of private individuals.\n\nIn media\nFictional\nThe Painted Queen written by the famous Elizabeth Peters a.k.a. Barbara Mertz is the most recent installment to the Amelia Peabody novels after the author's passing in 2013. Elizabeth Peters was a school trained archaeologist, but was persuaded by her male colleagues that a woman was not to be an archaeologist, so \"she created characters based on those misogynistic Egyptologists...\" as stated by Sarah Parcak, a female archaeologist that specializes in remote sensing. The adventure stars a female archaeologist Amelia Peabody and the mystery of the missing Bust of Nefertiti. The Painted Queen takes place in the 1912, several years after the actual excavations at Amarna, when excavations in Egypt are solely European, local hires, or looters. Like all good mystery novels, there is humor, twists, and turns, and a predictable ending of a solved case.\nNefertiti by Michelle Moran is a historical fiction work that guides the reader from the perspective of Queen Nefertiti and her younger sister Mutnodjmet. The story follows the timeline from her time in Thebes to Amarna and after Akhenaten's death. Nefertiti was the Chief wife in Akhenaten's court or haram. Though she is well known by name, as many historical female role models, her story is often overlooked for masculine rulers. Michelle Moran webs her story of the queen and her sister with political secrets, loss of innocence, and female strength in a patriarchal society.\n\nNon-fictional\nThe City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People by Barry Kemp, discusses everything from the conception of Amarna to the abandonment of the city. Within the book are images that display art, architecture, and the city as it was (reconstructed) and now. It also has a short chapter written by Kemp in the book Cities That Shaped the Ancient World.\n\nMagazines\nIn the past years National Geographic and archaeological articles have published articles on Amarna, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, or Nefertiti. Most of the article can be found in both the paperback or on the National Geographic website (currently the most recent article was published January 2021).\n\nOpera\nAkhnaten, act II, scene 3 (\"The City\") by Philip Glass describes the mandate from Akhenaten to build Akhetaten. In the English lines, it is consistently referred to as the \"City of the Horizon\".\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nAldred, Cyril (1988). Akhenaten: King of Egypt. London: Thames and Hudson.

Akhetaton signifie « L'Horizon d'Aton » en égyptien ancien. \nÀ cet endroit, situé entre Thèbes et Memphis, les hautes falaises de la chaîne Arabique qui se dressent sur la rive droite du Nil s'écartent du fleuve pour former un hémicycle de douze kilomètres de longueur ; c'est là qu'en l'an 4 de son règne (vers -1360) Akhenaton jeta les fondations de la cité qui sera la capitale de l'empire égyptien pendant un quart de siècle. La ville, dédiée au culte du dieu unique Aton, fut élevée rapidement en briques crues et en talatates ; quatre ans après sa fondation, elle était déjà habitée par une population nombreuse qu'on estime à vingt mille personnes au moins. Des stèles frontières délimitèrent le territoire de la ville. Sur l'une d'entre elles, le roi proclame qu'Aton lui-même avait choisi cet emplacement parce qu'il était vierge de la présence de toute autre divinité. Lorsque Toutânkhamon quitta Akhetaton pour retourner à Thèbes, la cité fut laissée à l'abandon, puis démantelée par les successeurs d'Akhenaton et recouverte par les sables. \nAkhetaton est la seule ville de l'Égypte antique dont nous ayons une connaissance détaillée, notamment à cause du fait qu'elle fut désertée peu de temps après la mort d'Akhenaton, pour ne plus jamais être occupée. Cependant, en raison de son caractère exceptionnel et des conditions dans lesquelles la ville fut fondée puis abandonnée, il est difficile de savoir dans quelle mesure « L'Horizon d'Aton » était représentatif de l'urbanisme égyptien.\n\nLes fouilles\nVisité sporadiquement par des voyageurs et des collectionneurs d'antiquités au XVIIIe siècle, cartographié par les savants de la campagne d'Égypte, le site fut exploré au XIXe siècle par des missions archéologiques britanniques et allemandes. L'Allemand Karl Richard Lepsius copia les inscriptions, les fresques et les reliefs auxquels il avait accès et les publia dans ses Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien (1849-59) (Monuments d'Égypte et d'Éthiopie). D'autres relevés du site furent réalisés entre 1891 et 1908 par Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie et Norman de Garis Davies. Les publications de ces savants sont d'une grande valeur, car depuis lors le site fut vandalisé régulièrement par des villageois en quête de matériaux de construction et de sebakh, un engrais naturel. De 1907 à 1914, la Deutsche Orientgesellschaft explora l'atelier du sculpteur Thoutmès où elle découvrit le buste de Néfertiti qui est exposé depuis le 16 octobre 2009 au Neues Museum de Berlin. Les fouilles furent interrompues pendant la Première Guerre mondiale, puis reprirent dans les années 1920. Depuis 1977, la Société d'exploration de l'Égypte (Egypt Exploration Society) procède à l'étude systématique du site, sous la responsabilité de Barry J. Kemp, directeur des fouilles et professeur à l'Université de Cambridge.\n\nChronologie des fouilles\n1714 - Le jésuite français Claude Sicard décrit le premier une stèle d'Amarna ;\n1798-1799 - Les savants de Bonaparte établissent une carte d'Amarna publiée dans la Description de l'Égypte (1809 – 1828) ;\n1824 - Sir John Gardner Wilkinson explore et cartographie les ruines de la cité antique ;\n7 novembre 1828 - Jean-François Champollion visite brièvement le site ;\n1833 - Le copiste Robert Hay et G. Laver explorent des tombes sud et en reproduisent les reliefs sur des gravures conservées depuis à la British Library ;\n1843-1845 – Une expédition prussienne dirigée par Karl Richard Lepsius établit une topographie d'Amarna au cours de deux visites de douze jours. Les dessins et les moulages en plâtre que l'expédition avait réalisés sur les lieux sont publiés dans Denkmäler aus Ægypten und Æthiopien (1849-1859) ;\n1881-1882 - Découverte de la tombe d'Akhenaton par des habitants de la région ;\n1887 - Découverte d'un dépôt de tablettes d'argile gravées en cunéiforme : les lettres d'Amarna ;\n1891-1892 - Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie étudie le Grand temple d'Aton et les palais royaux entre autres ;\n1903-1908 - Norman de Garis Davies dessine et photographie les tombes et les stèles d'Amarna ;\n1907-1914 – Une mission archéologique allemande dirigée par Ludwig Borchardt sous la tutelle de la Société allemande d'Orient (Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft) fouille les périphéries nord et sud de la cité. Elle découvre notamment le fameux buste de Néfertiti, le 6 décembre 1912. Les fouilles sont interrompues par la Première Guerre mondiale.\n1921-1936 - T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort et John Pendlebury explorent le site ;\nAnnées 1960 - Des fouilles sont organisées régulièrement par le Conseil suprême des Antiquités égyptiennes ;\nÀ partir de 1977 - Barry J. Kemp dirige les expéditions de l'Egypt Exploration Society, qui deviennent annuelles ;\n1974-1989 - Geoffrey T. Martin publie ses études de l'hypogée dit la Tombe royale dans The Royal Tomb at el-Amarna.\n\nLes lettres d'Amarna\nEn 1887, une villageoise cherchant du sebakh sur le site découvrit un dépôt de plusieurs centaines de tablettes provenant des archives royales. Ces tablettes, les lettres d'Amarna, sont rédigées en akkadien cunéiforme, la langue des relations diplomatiques de l'époque. Il s'agit pour la plupart de missives échangées entre la cour royale et ses vassaux du Proche Orient ainsi que ses alliés d'alors. Cette découverte est très précieuse, car elle couvre les échanges entre les chancelleries depuis la fin du règne d'Amenhotep III, attestant encore une fois qu'une corégence avec son fils est plus que probable, jusqu'aux temps troubles du règne d'Akhenaton. Ainsi, elles comportent une série d'appels à l'aide lancés par les vassaux égyptiens en Syro-Palestine, menacés par les ambitions hittites, et des lettres adressées « au grand roi, leur frère » par les rois de Babylone, d'Assyrie et du Mittani, qui devaient eux aussi faire face à cette rupture de l'équilibre des forces dans la région auquel Pharaon semble cependant avoir été indifférent.\nBien sûr, les lettres d’Amarna ne donnent qu'un aperçu forcément incomplet de cette période, mais elles attestent néanmoins les liens étroits existant entre les cours royales de la région et témoignent de l'activité diplomatique intense qui dans l'Antiquité déjà caractérisait les rapports entre les protagonistes du Proche Orient.\n\nL'Horizon d'Aton\nLa ville, située en face d'Hermopolis Magna, formait un vaste ensemble qui s'étirait sur près de neuf kilomètres. Les fouilles ont révélé l'existence de quatre palais, étagés du nord au sud le long du Nil. Le « Palais nord des berges du fleuve » entouré d'un mur d'enceinte paraît avoir été la résidence royale, fortifiée et isolée de la ville proprement dite. Plus au sud se trouvait un deuxième palais construit vraisemblablement pour Kiya, la « Grande Épouse aimée du roi ». Au centre de la ville se dressait le Grand Palais ou Palais officiel avec ses nombreuses dépendances administratives, ses cours cérémonielles et son pavillon royal qui comprenait une salle d'audience. L'accès se pratiquait au nord et à l'ouest par deux axes de circulation qui se croisent et distribuent les différentes parties principales. Le portail nord donnait sur un vaste parvis qui précédait le Grand temple d'Aton, tandis que l'accès ouest devait donner sur le Nil et un port royal.\nLa grande avenue qui reliait le Grand palais aux deux palais septentrionaux, la voie royale, sans doute la voie processionnelle d'Akhenaton, divisait le palais en deux zones distinctes : l'une, à l'ouest de l'avenue, bordant le Nil, davantage administrative et cérémonielle, avec sa gigantesque salle du trône, et une grande cour avec un kiosque monumental bordée de colosses du rois ; l'autre, à l'est, plus intime avec les appartements royaux, ses jardins et ses dépendances. L'avenue était enjambée par un pont couvert reliant les deux parties, et dans lequel était aménagée une « fenêtre des apparitions », celle-là même depuis laquelle le roi couvrait de l'or de la récompense ses fidèles sujets. De part et d'autre du Palais officiel furent édifiés le Grand temple, la « Demeure d'Aton dans Akhetaton », une enceinte de 760 × 270 m, et le Petit temple, consacré lui aussi à Aton.\nÀ la périphérie sud enfin, le Marou-Aton était sans doute un lieu de plaisance et de recueillement, bâti pour satisfaire l'amour porté à la nature par la famille royale : il possédait de vastes jardins, dont le roi semble avoir fait un parc zoologique, ainsi que plusieurs lacs artificiels. \nLes deux temples d'Aton occupaient le centre de la ville, jouxtant le Grand Palais. Contrairement aux temples égyptiens habituels, où l'on passe de la lumière à l'ombre profonde du Saint des Saints, ils offraient aux rayons du dieu-soleil leurs cours à ciel ouvert et leurs trois cent soixante-cinq autels couverts d'offrandes. Ces sanctuaires furent vraisemblablement conçus sur le même modèle que le Gem-Aton (Aton est trouvé) de Karnak, partiellement dégagé, qu'Akhenaton avait fait édifier au début de son règne lorsqu'il résidait encore à Thèbes : ils étaient composés d’une salle hypostyle et d’une succession de pylônes, donnant sur six grandes cours avec  les autels à offrandes – à l’inverse de la structure des temples classiques où les cours précèdent les salles hypostyles. Les portes des pylônes devaient comporter une particularité : peut-être les linteaux étaient-ils brisés pour que rien n'entrave l'accès du soleil au temple. Il faut pourtant remarquer que pour les détails architecturaux les archéologues en sont souvent réduits à des hypothèses, chacun proposant la sienne, d’autant que des deux temples il ne subsiste que les fondations et les représentations dans les tombes.\n\nNéanmoins, on peut raisonnablement supposer que l'architecture de ces temples est la même que celle qu’Akhenaton voulut pour son Héliopolis du Sud, Thèbes, et il la développa de manière magistrale à Akhetaton comme il sied à une nouvelle capitale : il s'agissait donc de monuments exclusivement dédiés à la lumière solaire, ce qui les rattache davantage aux temples solaires de l'Ancien Empire qu'aux sanctuaires classiques du Nouvel Empire. Peut-être pouvons-nous même déceler dans ce type d’architecture des influences héliopolitaines, bien que le site d'Héliopolis ait été autant bouleversé que celui de Tell el-Amarna.\nAvec le Grand Palais, les deux temples d'Aton étaient l'élément déterminant d'Akhetaton – sa raison d'être, et ils formaient ainsi la scène sur laquelle se jouait la vie de la cour royale, mais aussi les grandes cérémonies rituelles exclusivement dédiées à Aton, et exclusivement accomplies par le roi lui-même.\nAutour de ce vaste ensemble s'éparpillaient sans aucune planification urbaine les demeures des dignitaires, entourées de maisons plus modestes, ce qui fait dire à Sergio Donadoni que « la ville surgit sans plan prémédité […] : près du dieu le roi, près du roi les dignitaires du royaume, près des dignitaires leurs auxiliaires – mais tout ceci sans qu'il existe des quartiers fondamentalement différenciés par le statut de leurs habitants ». L'intérêt principal de cet urbanisme désordonné est d'avoir été conservé tout au moins quant à ses fondations. Ainsi nous disposons de véritables plans de demeures amarniennes, depuis le palais royal jusqu'à la maison du simple serviteur. Ces témoignages sont uniques pour la période de la XVIIIe dynastie.\n\nLes nécropoles et le village des artisans\nL'autre transformation radicale qu'entreprit Akhenaton en fondant sa nouvelle capitale fut de transférer la nécropole royale en abandonnant la rive occidentale de Thèbes et la vallée des Rois. Cet évènement sans précédent s'appliqua également aux grands du royaume, qui renoncèrent à leurs projets thébains pour se faire inhumer au plus proche de leur souverain. Ce changement ne pouvait se faire sans l'établissement à Akhetaton d'une communauté d'artisans, peut-être ceux-là mêmes qui vivaient à Deir el-Médineh.\n\nLa nécropole des nobles\nLes sépultures des notables furent creusées dans la falaise, au nord et au sud de la ville. Elles sont peu nombreuses, une quarantaine environ, destinées aux grands dignitaires qui avaient choisi de suivre le pharaon dans sa capitale. Les mieux conservées, les plus belles aussi car décorées dans le plus pur style amarnien, sont le tombeau de Mahou, le chef de la police, et celui d'Aÿ, le successeur de Toutânkhamon. Ces tombes comportent des salles à colonnes, sans doute conçues et élaborées sur le modèle des grandes salles d'apparat des demeures que les dignitaires occupèrent de leur vivant. En cela, elles sont très semblables à celles que se firent aménager les courtisans d'Amenhotep III à Thèbes ouest, notamment le vizir Ramosé qui fut contemporain des deux règnes et dont le tombeau porte par ailleurs sur ses parois les premiers éléments du changement stylistique inspiré ou imposé par Akhenaton lui-même. \nDans les nécropoles amarniennes en revanche, les scènes sculptées sont exclusivement réalisées dans le nouveau style amarnien et elles ont toutes trait à la vie à Akhetaton. On y voit Pharaon et sa famille faire offrande au dieu Aton, de même que des descriptions du palais saisissantes de réalisme, bien qu'il soit parfois malaisé à les interpréter en raison de la façon non-perspective qu'avaient les Égyptiens de représenter les bâtiments. Il n'en reste pas moins que ces scènes tranchent avec les reliefs des tombes classiques. Ainsi, à l'entrée, sont figurés le propriétaire et sa compagne agenouillés face à la sortie et faisant le geste de la prière devant un long texte qui est un hymne au soleil. De la sorte, ils pouvaient bénéficier des premiers rayons du soleil levant et lui adresser une prière que le roi lui-même aurait écrite : l'Hymne à Aton.\n\nLa nécropole royale\nUn vaste hypogée situé à l'écart dans une gorge désertique, le ouadi royal, pourrait être le tombeau ayant abrité la dépouille momifiée d'Akhenaton, ainsi que celles de la famille royale, mais rien ne le prouve. Cet hypogée fut conçu pour abriter le corps du roi. On y a en effet relevé une multitude de fragments d'un sarcophage en quartzite rouge, qui a été reconstitué et est exposé actuellement dans les jardins du Musée du Caire. Ce sarcophage ressemble beaucoup à ceux des règnes suivants sculptés pour Toutânkhamon, Aÿ ou même Horemheb et que l'on a retrouvés dans leurs tombes de la vallée des Rois. La différence majeure réside évidemment dans les cartouches aux noms du roi et du dieu Aton, et surtout dans le fait que les quatre personnages féminins qui étendent leurs ailes protectrices autour du sarcophage ne sont pas les déesses prophylactiques classiques que l'on retrouvera ultérieurement, mais bien quatre représentations de Néfertiti personnifiée en Sothis, l'étoile qui dans la mythologie égyptienne assurait l'éternel retour de l'inondation annuelle lors de son lever héliaque. Ce dernier détail démontre que la réforme religieuse avait atteint tous les domaines, y compris celui de la résurrection, apanage du dieu Osiris. Akhenaton en garda par ailleurs les symboles et les rites principaux dont celui de la momification, ce qu'attestent les restes d'un coffret à canopes ou les ouchebtis retrouvés dans l'hypogée royal, mais là encore de même que pour la personne du roi, la solarisation avait fait son œuvre, et Pharaon était complètement assimilé au dieu Soleil même dans son tombeau.\n\nL'architecture de l'hypogée en est une autre preuve. Il fut conçu sur un plan rectiligne faisant face à l'est afin de recevoir les rayons solaires qui théoriquement auraient pu pénétrer au plus profond du caveau. L'emplacement même de la nécropole achève la démonstration. Il fut choisi non plus à l'ouest, dans le domaine traditionnel d'Osiris, mais à l'est de la ville, dans un ouadi qui, depuis la ville, apparait entre deux collines au milieu desquelles se lève chaque matin le soleil, l'astre divin que Pharaon à sa mort rejoindra pour l'éternité. Ainsi Akhenaton revenait à la vie chaque matin, à chaque nouvelle aube. La révolution religieuse avait donc bien eu lieu jusque dans l'interprétation du mythe de la résurrection et cet ultime acte de foi, entre autres, fut sans doute à l'origine de la haine que le pharaon attira sur lui après sa disparition, lorsque ses successeurs seront incapables de résister aux pressions des clergés des grands dieux ancestraux du pays, dont celui d'Osiris en Abydos.\n\nAutre particularité de cet hypogée : juste avant la salle du sarcophage se trouvent deux galeries latérales dont l'une mène à deux autres chambres, elles aussi inachevées, mais dont le décor est pour le moins insolite dans une tombe royale. Les murs sont en effet décorés de scènes de deuil où l'on voit Pharaon et sa reine pleurer Mâkhétaton une de leurs filles morte autour de la 12e année du règne. Il s'agit d'un témoignage unique en son genre, nous livrant un des aspects les plus touchants du règne d'Akhenaton. Après l'an XII, des décès successifs endeuillèrent la famille royale et entamèrent l'extinction de la lignée royale. Mâkhétaton mourut probablement en couches, car on peut distinguer sur le registre inférieur une servante quittant la salle où repose la défunte et emportant un nourrisson dans ses bras, alors que toute l'assistance semble éplorée, ce qui donne à la scène une intensité dramatique.\nAkhenaton voulut probablement que ses filles fussent enterrées avec lui et transforma ainsi son hypogée en un caveau familial. L'autre galerie aurait été prévue pour la reine Néfertiti, mais cette hypothèse reste à confirmer.\nÀ proximité de la tombe royale d'autres hypogées avaient commencé à être aménagés, mais ils ne furent jamais achevés. Ils étaient probablement destinés aux autres membres de la cour royale.\n\nLe village des artisans\nÀ proximité de la nécropole sud, les archéologues ont déblayé un village des artisans de Tell el-Amarna où les artisans vivaient avec leurs familles : une soixantaine de maisons construites en briques d'argile, comprenant  quatre pièces, et sans doute peu confortables. Tout comme Deir el-Médineh, le village était entouré d'un mur d'enceinte percé d'une seule porte, moins pour séquestrer les artisans que pour empêcher les détournements de matériaux. Cependant à la différence de la ville royale, et même de l'exemple thébain, le village des artisans d'Akhetaton fut conçu sur un plan urbanistique bien déterminé, avec des rues se coupant à angle droit et des habitations aux proportions standardisées. En cela ce village rappelle l'exemple d'une ville de pyramide du Moyen Empire découverte à Kahun à l'entrée de l'oasis du Fayoum, à proximité d'El-Lahoun, où Sésostris II avait fait édifier son complexe funéraire.\n\nL'art amarnien\nL'art amarnien est unique, de par sa période « expressionniste » (par comparaison - abusive, mais faute de mieux - avec certaines œuvres des artistes expressionnistes allemands), puis son naturalisme, tous deux fondés sur les mêmes motivations spirituelles. Ces formes artistiques et ces pratiques artistiques semblent en rupture radicale avec l'art égyptien qui avait précédé, au Moyen Empire - quoique Sésostris III pose déjà problème -, puis avec des personnalités fortes comme la reine Hatchepsout et le roi Thoutmôsis III. Cependant cette « révolution amarnienne » qui commence à Thèbes, a été très clairement annoncée sous Amenhotep III et la reine Tiyi. \nLes scènes représentées s'écartent totalement des sujets traditionnels de la religion égyptienne centrée autour du culte d'Amon, des images de la monarchie égyptienne en figurant, par exemple, la famille royale avec ses enfants. Cependant de telles images, la famille royale, sont restées longtemps l'objet d'interprétations anachroniques. Une meilleure connaissance de cette période, au cours des vingt dernières années, a permis d'écarter bien des erreurs. Plusieurs grandes expositions, mais aussi des fouilles archéologiques ont pu faire avancer considérablement l'état de ces connaissances. \nDes objets typiques de l'époque amarnienne ont été découverts dans des régions éloignées de l’Égypte comme dans la région palestinienne.\nAprès la fin de l'expérience amarnienne, l'art égyptien retourna à l'iconographie et, progressivement, au style traditionnel.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\n(en) Dorothea Arnold, The Royal women of Amarna : images of beauty from Ancient Egypt, New York (N.Y.), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Abrams, 1996, 169 p., 29 cm.

          "content": "## Overview\nAmarna (el-Amarna) is a significant archaeological location in Middle Egypt, in the modern Egyptian province of el-Minya. Amarna sits between the east bank of the river Nile and the high plateau of the Eastern Desert, some 58 km (36 mi) south of Minya, 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor and 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\n## Understand\nThe diverse and scattered archaeological sites at Amarna represent the remains of the short-lived capital of Akhenaten, the \"heretic\" Pharaoh of the late 18th Dynasty.\nAmarna has, since 1982, been the target of nearly annual archaeological excavations by a team from the University of Cambridge, England.\n\n## Get in\nRoad and rail links with Amarma are accessible only on the opposite (west) bank of the Nile, making a river crossing necessary (an eastern access by a feeder road from the Cairo-Asyut desert highway is reportedly planned).\nFor the northern and central parts of Amarna (including the North Tombs), the tourist ferry to 27.66050130.895781 el-Till should be used. This can be reached by tourist car/taxi from Mallawi (which has a railway station) or from Minya. Vehicles are available for hire at el-Till. This is the usual means of tourist access.\nFor the South Tombs the ferry to el-Hagg Qandil is an alternative, if perhaps somewhat risky. This is accessible by vehicle from Deir Mawas, along the road which passes the village of Beni Amran. From Deir Mawas to the ferry the distance is about 1.75 km (just over one mile). Deir Mawas also has a local railway station. Transport is far less likely to be available for hire from el-Hagg Qandil.\nBecause of security issues, foreign visitors are escorted around the site by representatives of the Tourist Police who are based at the el-Till ferry. For this reason, use of the el-Hagg Qandil ferry by foreigners is discouraged. If you take this route, you may be escorted to el-Till or be taken back to the train stations at Mallawi or Minya.\n\n## Get around\nEl-Till ferry to the North Tombs: 3.2 km (2 mi); el-Till ferry to the North Palace: 2 km (1 1/4 mi); el-Till ferry to the Central City: 2 km (1 1/4 mi); North to South Tombs: 5.6 km (3 1/2 mi); el-Till ferry to the Royal Tomb: 11 km (7 mi).\n\n## See\n27.6730.9033331 Northern Palace.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64926630.8975092 the Great Aten Temple.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64519330.8946443 the Small Aten Temple.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.66163330.9268694 the Northern Tombs.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64560730.9381095 the Southern Tombs.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.626230.98526 Royal Tomb of Akhenaten.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.633330.91677 Workmen's Village. It housed the workers who constructed and decorated the tombs of the city's elite, making it comparable to the better studied Theban workers village of Deir el-Medina.   (updated Aug 2020)\nUsual tourist itineraries: from el-Till to the Northern tombs, nos. 3-6 (1 and 2 require an extra excursion), returning to el-Till via a detour to the Northern Palace. The Central City can be added as a further detour. This can be accomplished in half a day or less. The Royal Tomb can be reached by an extension to the asphalt road, in a 30-min drive from the Northern Tombs. A much longer excursion can be taken to the Southern Tombs, along the road beside the cultivation, which passes through much of the ancient city. The greater part of a day should be allowed for this extended trip.\n\n## Eat and drink\nThere is a small, privately-run tourist kiosk with toilets at the foot of the slope beneath the North Tombs. A second has been built below the South Tombs but is reportedly not yet in operation. Prudence would suggest that you bring food and water with you (and maybe some toilet tissue as well!)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are no accommodation options at the site of Amarna. Travellers are generally advised to seek accommodation in one of the nearby cities of Mallawi or Minya.",

          "content": "Beni Ḥassan (Arabic: بني حسان \"sons of Ḥassān\") is a Bedouin Arab tribe which inhabits Western Sahara, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. It is one of the four sub-tribes of the Banu Maqil who emigrated in the 11th century from South Arabia to the Maghreb with the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes. In the 13th century, they took the Sanhaja territories in the southwest of the Sahara. In Morocco, they first settled, alongside their Maqil relatives, in the area between Tadla and the Moulouya River. The Sous Almohad governor called upon them for help against a rebellion in the Sous, and they resettled in and around that region. They later moved to what is today Mauritania, and from the 16th century onwards, they managed to push back all black peoples southwards to the Senegal Valley river. The Beni Hassan and other warrior Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the area after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabs became the dominant ethnic group in Western Sahara and Mauretania. The Bani Hassan dialect of Arabic became used in the region and is still spoken, in the form of Hassaniya Arabic. The hierarchy established by the Beni Hassan tribe gave Mauritania much of its sociological character. That ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.\n\nOrigin\nBeni Hassan are one of the four sub-tribes of Beni Maqil who emigrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century. The exact origin of the Beni Maqil tribe is unknown, although it has been established that they most likely originated in South Arabia (Yemen). The Maqil claimed Hashemite descent from Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, while some Arabian genealogists categorized them as Hilalians. Ibn Khaldun said both of these versions are false and that Maqil is most likely an Arab nomadic group from Yemen.\nThe tradition of Beni Hassan states that they were descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's son-in-law and a leading figure in Shia Islam, although the Beni Hassan were Sunni Muslims. The Sahrawi nation includes the Beni Hassan as part of its founding peoples and Hassaniya Arabic as part of its national identity. There is also a Beni Hassan Bedouin tribe in northern Jordan.\n\nBeni Hassan's descendants and other tribes that arrived from Yemen in the 13th century are considered among the clean-blooded Arab tribes. For example, the Oulad Delim who trace their origin back to Beni Hassan are the most populous tribe in Western Sahara and consider themselves the cleanest blooded Arabs in the Sahel.\n\nHistory\nMigration to the Maghreb\nVarious sources point to the Maqil tribe as the origin from which the Beni Hassan tribe was formed. The Ma'qils entered the Maghreb during the wave of emigration of the Arabian tribes in the 11th century, and since then, they were situated in North Africa together with other Bedouin Arab tribes that migrated from the Arabian Peninsula such as the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym, with whom they shared great skill as warriors and a destructive capacity for the nations they attacked.\nThe Bedouin tribes were sent into the Maghreb by the Fatimids to punish the Zirids for switching allegiance to the rival Abbasid Caliphate. They were compared to Mughal warriors centuries later. They adapted perfectly to the climatic desert conditions of the Maghreb, discovering the same way of life as in the Arabian Peninsula. The Banu Sulaym opposed the Maqil's arrival and fought them off. The Maqil later allied with the Banu Hilal and entered under their protection, which enabled them to wander in the Moroccan desert between the Moulouya River and Tafilalt oases.\nIn the 13th century, they occupied southern Algeria and dominated the oases of Tuat and Gourara. For some authors, at this point, the Maqil group had already disintegrated into different populations in the Maghreb and had given rise to the Beni Hassan along with other related groups.\n\nConquest of the Sanhaja\nThe Beni Hassan continued their expansion to the southwest and occupied Sanhaja lands in the 13th century after invading and defeating this Berber confederation with the Lamtuna, Masmuda, Djuddala, Gazula, Banu Warith, Lamta and Tuareg, in a group known as the Baranis in Western Sahara.\nThe Sanhaja has long had to pay tribute to the nomadic Bedouin Hassani invaders. The invasion was quick and effective and happened around the year 1250, by the end of the Almohad Caliphate, and also dominated the valleys of the Moulouya, Draa, Sous, as well as the Tafilalt oasis region.\n\nMigration to Morocco\nBy the mid-15th century, the Beni Hassan controlled a large part of the oases and Western Sahara. They crossed into the Atlas after taking advantage of the weakening Marinid Sultanate around 1460 and then they dominated the Haouz region of Marrakesh by the beginning of the 16th century. At the same time, a part of the Beni Hassan made its way to Mauritania. Other groups migrated north through Tafilalt to Fez or up the Sebou and Bou Regreg rivers, where some settled south of Rabat.\nThe Hassanis were represented in the Haouz of Marrakech by the Rahamna, who were brought north to respond to the military needs of the Saadian Sultanate in the early 16th century. Two of the prominent Hassani communities during the late 'Alawi period were the Jaysh al-Udaya and the Shabbanat. The former were invited by the sultan of Morocco Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), while the latter controlled Marrakesh when sultan Al-Rashid arrived to conquer it.\n\nChar Bouba War\nHistorical accounts report that these Hassani communities enriched themselves by collecting tolls from trade caravans and extorting farming and herding villages settled in the oases. They were accused of subjecting these territories to two centuries of looting and intermittent wars, but at the same time they point out that their families settled in the same towns that they attacked and subjugated. This took place during the Char Bouba War from 1644 to 1674, which after decades of confrontations ended up completely Arabizing the native Berber population, destroying their language and culture and giving rise to the contemporary Sahrawi people.\nThe Char Bouba War was led by Sidi Ibrahim Al Aroussi, son of the famous Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Al Aroussi (died in 1593, near to Smara, in Western Sahara). Al Aroussi, with his two sons Shanan Al Aroussi and Sidi Tounsi Al Aroussi, led a powerful force of the Beni Hassan, the Aroussi Army, to conquer the Berber Imarat in modern day Mauritania and gain access to Bilad as-Sudan (\"the Land of the Blacks\", in Senegal and Mali).\nIn 1673, Nasr al-Din began invaded Futa Tooro and the various Wolof states beyond the Senegal river. By focusing on the states south of the Senegal, Nasr al-Din avoided an early confrontation with the powerful Beni Hassan. Nasr al-Din's focus on these states gained him control of the entrepôts for the gum trade along the Senegal. French trade on the Senegal had seen large growth since the beginning of the century, and thus control of the entrepôts strengthened Nasr al-Din financially, whilst offsetting the Hassan control of the trade to the ports on the Saharan coast.\nThe Beni Hassan were united in their opposition to Nasr al-Din. Most of the burden of fighting fell to the Emirate of Trarza, although the Emirate of Brakna sent Trarza reinforcements and helped immobilise Zawaya in their own regions to prevent them from joining the forces of Nasr. Most Zawaya of the Southern Sahara sided with Nasr, although some remained neutral, and others supported the Beni Hassan, with a Zawaya scholar from Shinqit issuing a fatwa against Nasr, stating that he was not a Caliph and had no right to impose the zakat. This fatwa led to Hãdi, the Trarza chief, sending troops to seize animals that had already been sent as zakat.\nIn 1674, the Beni Hassan defeated the Marabout Berbers, and after achieving political and military hegemony in the area, they founded the emirates of Trarza, Brakna, Tagant, Adrar and Hodh. The marabouts were Berbers who followed the Islamic doctrine of Nasr al-Din imposed in Senegal in the mid-17th century. The war ended in defeat for the Berber tribes, and they were from that point on forced to surrender their arms and submit to the warrior Arab tribes, to whom they paid the horma tributary tax. They would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (marabout or zawiya) tribes. This division between Hassane Arab warriors and Berber marabouts, plus the subordinate znaga, existed in Mauritania up until the French colonization, when France imposed itself militarily on all tribes, and so broke the power of the Hassane. Still, the traditional roles of the tribes remain important socially in these areas.\n\nBefore French colonization\nFollowing the pre-Islamic tradition of tribal warfare between clans in the Arabian Peninsula, the new Hassani emirates repeatedly went to war with each other. Throughout the 18th century, they harassed the Wolof in Senegal. Throughout this period, they spread their dialect and culture throughout the desert area of Western Sahara. In the 19th century, they led the consolidation of the process of cultural and linguistic Arabization of Mauritania. By the end of the 19th century, the Zenaga Berber language was completely annihilated.\n\nBeni Hassan sub-tribes\nThe descendants of Hassan ben Mokhtar ben Mohamed, son of the forefather of the Maqils\nThe Shebanat: descendants of Shebana, brother of Hassan, and son of Mokhtar ben Mohamed\nThe Reguitat: descendants of Jallal, Salem and Uthman, brothers of Mokhtar and sons of Mohamed\nSeveral other Arab tribes joined the Maqils and became part of the Beni Hassan tribe.\n\nNotable people\nSidi Ahmed Reguibi\n\nSee also\nMaqil\nBanu Sulaym\nBanu Hilal\nChar Bouba war\nNorth African Arabs\n\nReferences\n\nAlmsaodi, Abdulaziz.

Ces décors, typiques du Moyen Empire, sont particulièrement remarquables dans le tombeau de Khnoumhotep II, nomarque de la XIIe dynastie ; on y observe ainsi une caravane d'Asiatiques, une récolte de figues et une chasse aux canards.\nAu sud du cimetière se trouve un temple construit par Hatchepsout et Thoutmôsis III, dédié à la déesse locale Pachet. Il est connu sous le nom de grotte d'Artémis car les Grecs identifiaient par syncrétisme Pakhet avec Artémis et le temple est souterrain.\n\nLe cimetière\nLes gouverneurs provinciaux du Moyen Empire ont été enterrés de manière continue dans des tombes décorées de pierres taillées dans leurs cimetières locaux, comme c'était déjà le cas lors de la Première Période intermédiaire, sur des sites tels que celui de Beni Hassan. Il existe des preuves d'une réorganisation du système de gouvernement pendant la XIIe dynastie : durant la première période intermédiaire et pendant une partie de la période du Moyen Empire, il était courant que la fonction de nomarque (quelqu'un qui supervise / contrôle une zone spécifiée par le gouvernement) soit héréditaire ; l'élite ne dépendait pas du roi pour légitimer son pouvoir autant que dans l'Ancien Empire. Au cours de la XIIe dynastie, le pouvoir des nomarques commença à être restreint et les gouverneurs provinciaux furent nommés ou au moins confirmés par le roi.\nOn trouve ici trente-neuf tombes antiques de nomarques du nome de l'Oryx du Moyen Empire (soit du XXIe au XIXe siècle av. J.-C.), qui gouvernaient depuis Hebenou. En raison de la qualité et de la distance des falaises à l'ouest, ces tombes furent construites sur la rive est. Il existe une distribution spatiale nette dans ce cimetière (il y a deux cimetières ici : la haute et la basse nécropole) associés aux différents niveaux de ressources disponibles pour le défunt. Les personnes les plus importantes ont ainsi été enterrées près du sommet de la falaise tandis que dans le cimetière inférieur se trouvent 888 tombes en forme de puits, datant du Moyen Empire, qui ont été étudiées par John Garstang. Pour la plupart, ces tombes partageaient une conception générale semblable qui comprenait une petite chambre ou un renfoncement au pied du puits (orienté vers le sud) pour recevoir le cercueil et les dépôts funéraires.\n\nDans le cimetière supérieur, les membres de la classe appartenant à l'élite ont construit des tombes impressionnantes pour représenter leurs positions sociales et politiques en tant que dirigeants et officiels du nome de l'Oryx, le 16e nome de la Haute-Égypte. Sur ce site, la haute élite provinciale a ainsi été enterrée dans de grandes tombes richement décorées et sculptées dans les falaises de calcaire près de la capitale provinciale, dans la partie supérieure du cimetière. Ces tombes sont alignées sur un axe nord-sud. Il existe une légère cassure dans la terrasse rocheuse naturelle, sur laquelle ils s'ouvrent, qui divise les trente-neuf tombes à statut élevé en deux groupes. La conception de base de ces tombes de l'élite était une cour extérieure et une pièce creusée dans la roche (parfois appelée la chapelle) dans laquelle il y avait un puits qui menait à la chambre d'enterrement.\nCertaines des plus grandes tombes possèdent des inscriptions biographiques et ont été peintes avec des scènes de la vie quotidienne et des scènes de guerre. Elles sont célèbres pour la qualité de leurs peintures. De nos jours, beaucoup de ces scènes sont en mauvais état, même si au XIXe siècle des copies ont été faites de plusieurs d'entre elles.\n\nExplorations\nLe site a été d'abord exploré par Edme François Jomard en 1798, membre de l’expédition française en Égypte de 1798, exploration plus tard documentée dans Monuments de l'Égypte et de la Nubie de l'expédition franco-toscane de 1828.\nIl fut plus tard également exploré par l'archéologue allemand Karl Richard Lepsius lors de l'expédition scientifique allemande de 1842-1845 qui l'inclue dans ses Monuments d'Égypte et d'Éthiopie.\nLe peintre britannique David Roberts fut le premier Anglais a visiter le site au cours de son grand voyage en Terre Sainte et en Égypte, ses aquarelles représentant certaines tombes de Beni Hassan.\nCependant, ce n'est seulement qu'en 1890 que la nécropole fut pour la première fois systématiquement explorée par les archéologues Newberry et Carter.\n\nSépultures remarquables\nQuatre tombes sont accessibles au public. Les tombes les plus remarquables sont :\n\nTombe BH2 — Amenemhat, connu sous le nom d'Ameny, nomarque sous le pharaon Sésostris Ier (accessible).\nTombe BH3 — Khnoumhotep II, remarquable pour ses peintures de caravanes de marchands sémites (accessible).\nTombe BH4 — Khnoumhotep, nomarque à la fin de la XIIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH13 — Khnoumhotep, scribe royal durant la XIIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH14 — Khnoumhotep Ier, nomarque sous Amenemhat Ier (fermée).\nTombe BH15 — Baqet III, remarquable pour ses peintures de techniques de lutte (accessible).\nTombe BH17 — Khety, nomarque sous la XIe dynastie, fils de Baqet ; remarquable pour ses peintures de ce qui pourrait être des jeux de ballon (accessible) .\nTombe BH21 — Nakhti, nomarque pendant la XIIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH23 — Netjernakht, « superviseur du désert Arabique » pendant la XIIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH27 — Ramouchenty, nomarque sous la XIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH29 — Baqet Ier, nomarque sous la XIe dynastie (fermée).\nTombe BH33 — Baqet II, nomarque sous la XIe dynastie (fermée).\n\nNotes et références\n\n Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de l’Égypte antique",

          "content": "## Overview\nBahariyya is an oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is 370 km from Cairo, the closest of the five western oases, and it serves as a staging post for reaching the others.\n\n## Understand\nBahariyya's main fertile strip, centred on the town of Bawiti, is about 90 km long by 40 km wide. This is separated from the secondary oasis of El Heiz by a strip of scenic Black Desert, while further south lies the even more dramatic White Desert. Near Bawiti, the Valley of the Golden Mummies has revealed hundreds of burials with gilded face masks, and thousands more probably remain to be excavated. Large dinosaur bones have also been discovered, such as the fearsome Bahariasaurus, thought to be a type of allosaurus.\nBahariyya does not have an airport and never quite gained a railway. In 1916 a British narrow-gauge military railway was built at remarkable speed from the Nile valley towards Bahariyya, to counter-attack Senussi troops from Libya who'd occupied the western oases. It had to stop short at the sand dunes of Abu-Muharriq (more poetically known to the Brits as Blockhouse 6), whence camels took supplies the last 50 km onwards. The Senussi retreated as swiftly as the railway advanced so it achieved its strategic goal. After 1919 it did not have a military use nor (unlike the similar line built to Kharga) a commercial use. So, it fell into decay.\nBahariyya has a hot desert climate, 40 °C and above in summer and 10 °C in winter, and almost zero rainfall. Like the other oases, all the area's supply is “fossil water” from the bedrock aquifer, a non-renewable resource.\n\n## By bus\n28.3501128.8661141 Bawiti bus stop.    (updated Jun 2020)\nCairo – Upper Egypt Buses run 3 or 4 times a day from Cairo Turgoman Square. 350 km/6 hr (including a rest break) to Bawiti in Bahariyya. LE100. Some buses continue to Farafra Oasis—these formerly continued to Dakhla Oasis, but it is not known if this link is still running in 2020.\nFarafra Oasis – Likewise the bus to Cairo starts in Farafra.\n\n## By road\nThe road to Bahariyya is asphalt and suitable for standard vehicles. Especially with a group, it may work out better to hire a microbus or taxi privately. You will find them around the bus station.\nA dirt track goes west from Bahariyya to Siwa. It is being upgraded to asphalt and buses used to run this way. The road is closed in 2019 by the military, or least foreigners are not allowed to go that way.\n\n## Get around\nThe sights are strung out along the highway and you need a vehicle to reach them. A standard car will do for all except the White Desert, where you need 4WD to explore the dirt tracks. These are well-pisted and signed so you don't need expedition-grade vehicles or skills provided you stick to the tracks.\n\n## See\nBawiti has three mosques—all central:\nthe Friday Mosque\nthe modern el-Mutawi Mosque, and\nel-Bawiti Mosque with the tomb of the town's founder Sheikh el-Bawiti.\n28.34928.8721 Bawiti Museum. Shows tomb bodies (which are not mummies, but preserved) and other local artifacts. Your ticket is also a day-ticket for the other nearby antiquities, which have no ticket sales on site. In Nov 2019 it cost LE100.    (updated Jun 2020)\nAin el-Hubaga – Opposite the museum is the start of an ancient aqueduct system that remained in use into the 20th century.\n28.35151128.8722612 Qarat Qasr Salim graveyard (400 m north of the museum). Dates to the 26th Dynasty circa 600 BC. It has richly decorated tombs, especially those of Baennentiu and of his father Djed-Amun-ef-Anch.  (updated Jun 2020)\n28.3528.853 Qasr (west of Bawiti). An older village that has now merged into it. There is more old architecture here. See Senussi (or Libyan) Old Mosque, the tombs of Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh el-Badawi, and the scrappy remains of a Roman triumphal arch. The Temple of Bes is closed off.    (updated Jun 2020)\n28.35728.8474 Chapels of Ain el-Muftilla (3 km west). Of similar date, these four chapels to Amasis are decorated, though patchy and faded. The conical tomb nearby is of Sheikh el-Badawi.     (updated Jun 2020)\n28.34128.855 Qarat Hilwa. The tomb of Amenhotep Huy, a governor from the 19th Dynasty (Bronze Age circa 1200 BC), decorated with scenes of his family and funeral rites.     (updated Jun 2020)\n28.34228.8226 Temple of Alexander the Great (5 km west of Bawiti). The only temple he had built in Egypt. It is a modest affair of two sandstone chambers dedicated to Amun-Re. 45 auxiliary rooms served the temple attendants.    (updated Jun 2020)\n28.32728.8267 Valley of the Golden Mummies. Makes a great title for a film (probably with Woodie Allen), but the \"valley\" is a flat plain, the bodies weren't mummies, and as for gold... in any case this graveyard from Graeco-Roman times was only unearthed in 1995 and is still an active archaeology site, and tourists cannot enter. See some of what they found in Bawiti Museum.      (updated Jun 2020)\n28.35728.9028 The look-out post. On a little hill, an hour's stroll east of Bawiti. This is where in the First World War the Brits swept their binoculars across the terrain to see what the Senussi were up to.    (updated Jun 2020)\n28.1528.7299 The Black Desert (southwest of Bawiti). A 30-km expanse of sooty black hills, contrasting sharply with the ochre desert sand. It is formed from crumbling black basalt; the area was volcanic 30-70 million years ago. There's a striking formation at Gebel el-Marsus. Nearby along the highway is the grave of René Michaud of Switzerland, who established a Bawiti hotel but upped and died in 1981 while taking a drive here.      (updated Jun 2020)\n28.00728.69710 El Heiz. A satellite oasis, separated from Bawiti by the Black Desert. There are several wells, historically important but not much to look at, and some ramshackle remains. Check before making a trip whether any special permission is needed to visit these. They include the church of St George and Roman fort at Ain Ris, and rock tombs and an old adobe village at Ain el-Izza.     (updated Jun 2020)\n27.66228.42911 Crystal Mountain (along the highway to White Desert). A natural arch lined with crystals of calcite. These are soft and can be easily scratched—so please don’t.      (updated Jun 2020)\n27.48528.24212 White Desert National Park (accessed from the highway 30 km north of Farafra). See Farafra that page for details, but it is easily done as a day trip from Bahariyya 100 km away. It is a remarkable area of limestone and chalk wind-sculpted into strange shapes. You need a 4WD vehicle to explore the lengthy off-road trails.      (updated Jun 2020)\nSeveral other sites in Bawiti remain closed. As of 2020 these include the Ibis Galleries, the Temple of Hercules and the Hill of Sheikh Subi.\n\n## Do\nHot springs – Several springs bubble out of the ground at 40°C and above, laden with minerals. So, you might expect a major spa industry here, but there is not one. Springs you can visit yourself are clustered northeast of Bawiti:\nBiʾr Ramla (\"sand spring\") – 2 km away\nBiʾr en-Naqba (\"pierced spring\") – 3 km away\nthe sulphurous Biʾr el-Maṭar (\"airfield spring\") – 7 km away\nBiʾr el-Ghaba (\"forest spring\") – 11 km away, and\nBiʾr es-Sīqām – 1 km east of Mandisha.\nDig deeper into Egyptian history. The sights mentioned on this page might interest any tourist, but there's much more for archaeologists to explore. The German description of Bahariyya (on sidebar left) runs to 32 pages of documentation.\nBig expeditions – Any out-of-town excursion gets marketed as a \"safari\", accurately enough since that is just the Arabic word for a journey. And it gets labelled an \"expedition\" if it drives out of sight of the main highway for long enough to spread a rug on the ground and serve coffee - again accurately, if it is properly prepared for all that might befall amidst axle-busting rocks and no mobile signal. But Bahariyya is also the usual departure point for full-on expeditions, for instance to Gilf el-Kebir, the remote southwest corner of Egypt bordering Libya and Sudan. These last 2-3 weeks and need to be very robust and self-sufficient, led by people who know the terrain and techniques. Glamping they're not.\n\n## Buy\nBawiti has a scattering of little grocery stores, the largest is Abu Ala on main street, open 24/7.\n\n## Eat\nAlmost all the eating places are on the main road through town, but Oasis restaurant and coffee shop (open 24 hours) is on the southern bypass.\nBakar is the most convenient for east side of town, open daily 5PM–midnight.\nCafe Ouled Rached central on main street does enjoyable food. Open 24/7.\nBaraka is west of centre where the roads fork for Siwa and Farafra. Open 24/7.\nAbu Helmy is a little further along the Siwa road, and the most convenient for Qasr neighbourhood. Open 24/7.\n\n## Drink\nMint tea is always a good choice in these regions.\n\n## Sleep\nAll the hotels offer excursions or safaris into the desert, so it should not be beyond them to offer you a pick-up from the bus stop.\n28.34528.851 Qasr El Bawety Ecohotel, Bawiti (North edge of village), ☏ +20 128 728 3667.

          "content": "Wadi El Natrun (Arabic: وادي النطرون, lit. 'Valley of Natron'; Coptic: Ϣⲓϩⲏⲧ, romanized: Šihēt, lit. 'measure of the hearts') is a depression in northern Egypt that is located 23 m (75 ft) below sea level and 38 m (125 ft) below the Nile River level. The valley contains several alkaline lakes, natron-rich salt deposits, salt marshes and freshwater marshes.\nIn Christian literature it is usually known as Scetis (Σκήτις  in Hellenistic Greek) or  Skete (Σκήτη, plural Σκήτες in ecclesiastical Greek). \nIt is one of the three early Christian monastic centers located in the Nitrian Desert of the northwestern Nile Delta. The other two monastic centers are Nitria and Kellia. Scetis, now called Wadi El Natrun, is best known today because its ancient monasteries remain in use, unlike Nitria and Kellia which have only archaeological remains. The desertified valley around Scetis in particular may be called the Desert of Scetis.\n\nGeography\nWadi al-Natrun is the common name for a desert valley located west of the Nile Delta, along the El Tahrir markaz, which is about 10 km west of the entrance to Sadat City on the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, and about 50 km from Khattabah on the Nile (Rashid Branch), and it falls below the level of the plateau surface surrounding it about 50 meters. The length of this depression ranges between 5, 55 and 60 km, while its average width is 10 km, and its deepest point reaches 24 meters below sea level. The depression is the smallest depression in the Egyptian Western Desert, with an area of about 500 km2. Therefore, it is true that it is a depression and not a valley, because the region is a closed depression that has a beginning and an end, and it has no source, estuary or tributaries, so the launch of the word \"Wadi\" on the depression is not topographically correct.\nThe Wadi contains 12 lakes, the total surface area of which is 10 km square and their average depth is only 2 m. The color of these lakes is reddish blue because its water is saturated with the Natron salt.\n\nHistory\nFossil discoveries\nFossils dating to the Pliocene era (5.3-2.6 million years ago) have been discovered in the Wadi El Natrun region, including the long-snouted crocodile Euthecodon, softshell turtles, the camel Paracamelus, the three toed hipparionine equine Cormohipparion, the primitive hippopotamus Archaeopotamus andrewsi, antelope including reedbuck (Renunca) and Alcelaphinae, and the elephant-relative Deinotherium.\n\nAncient history\nNatron valley is first attested in the story of the Eloquent Peasant, and it is mentioned among the list of seven oases in the Temple of Edfu. In Ptolemaic times it constituted part of the Nitrite nome (Ancient Greek: Νιτριώτης νομός). It was also known in Coptic as Mountain of Salt (Coptic: ⲡⲧⲱⲟⲩ ⲙⲡϩⲙⲟⲩ) or Phanihosem (Coptic: ⲫⲁⲛⲓϩⲟⲥⲉⲙ, lit. 'the one (place) on the natron').\nThe importance of the Natrun valley dates back to the Pharaonic era, as the ancient Egyptians and the Libyans fought many battles there. And this ended up with the Egyptians overcoming them and annexed the eastern side of the desert, which still belongs to Egypt. Then, Wadi al-Natrun became an administrative part of the country in the Pharaonic era, but there is no information about its history during their reign, and the latest writings on the wars between the Libu and the Egyptians indicate that the last of them was in 1170 BC during the reign of Ramesses III.\nAs for the religious significance of Wadi al-Natrun, there are many discoveries that indicate that this area was considered sacred as early as year 2000 BCE at the very least. Among these discoveries is a bust of black granite dating back to the era of the Seventeenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs, and there is also a granite gate and stones from the lintel of a door bearing cartridges for King Amenemhat I, in a place called the backbone.\n\nEconomic history\nThe alkali lakes of the Natron Valley provided the Ancient Egyptians with the sodium bicarbonate used in mummification and in Egyptian faience, and later by the Romans as a flux for glass making.\nThe Egyptian Salt and Soda Company Railway was built at the end of the 19th century as a 33 miles (54 km) long narrow gauge railway with a gauge of 750 mm, which attracted the first tourists to the wadi.\n\nMonastic history\nThe desolate region became one of Christianity's most sacred areas. The Desert Fathers and cenobitic monastic communities used the desert's solitude and privations to develop self-discipline (asceticism). Hermit monks believed that desert life would teach them to eschew the things of this world and follow God's call. Between the 4th and 7th century AD, hundreds of thousands of people from the world over joined the hundreds of Christian monasteries in the Nitrian Desert, centered on Nitria, Kellia and Scetis (Wadi El Natrun).\nSaint Macarius of Egypt first came to Scetis (Wadi El Natrun) around 330 AD where he established a solitary monastic site. His reputation attracted a loose band of anchorites, hermits and monks who settled nearby in individual cells. Many of them came from nearby Nitria and Kellia where they had previous experience in solitary desert living; thus the earliest cenobitic communities were a loose consolidation of like-minded monks.  By the end of the fourth century, four distinct communities had developed: Baramus, Macarius, Bishoi and John Kolobos. At first these communities were groupings of cells centered on a communal church and facilities, but enclosed walls and watchtowers developed over time and in response to raids from desert nomads. Nitria, Kellia, and Scellis also experienced internal fractures related to doctrinal disputes in Egypt. At its peak the place contained 700 monasteries. The monasteries flourished during the Muslim conquest of Egypt (639–642), but in the eighth and ninth centuries taxation and administration concerns led to conflicts with the Muslim government.\n\nInvasion of Scetis\nScetis was attacked by the Mazices who \"came sweeping off the Libyan desert\" in 407-408 AD and was decimated, causing many notable Desert Fathers to leave the region, such as Abba Anoub. One of the survivors, St. Arsenius the Great, remarked in 410 that, \"The world has lost Rome and the monks have lost Scetis.\" As the Jesuit historian and Professor Willian J. Harmless said, \"Scetis’s destruction marked a turning point in the history of early Christian monasticism. The site would be resettled a few years later, and in fact would suffer other raids, notably in 434, 444, and 570.\"\nNitria and Kellia were eventually abandoned in the 7th and 9th centuries respectively, but Scetis continued throughout the Medieval period. Although some of the individual monasteries were eventually abandoned or destroyed, four have remained in use to the present day:\n\nMonastery of Saint Macarius the Great\nParomeos Monastery\nMonastery of Saint Pishoy\nSyrian Monastery\nSome of the most renowned saints of the region include the various Desert Fathers, including Saint Amun, Saint Arsenius, Saint John Cassian, Saint Isidore of Scété, Saint John the Dwarf, Saint Macarius of Egypt, Saint Macarius of Alexandria, Saint Moses the Black, Saint Pishoy, Sts. Maximos and Domatios, Saint Poimen The Great and Saint Samuel the Confessor.\nTo this day Wadi El Natrun remains the most important center of Coptic monasticism.\n\nSaint-Exupéry's plane crash\nThe environs of Wadi Natrun have been identified as the likely site of where the plane of French \naviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry crashed on December 30, 1935.  After miraculously surviving the crash, he and his plane's mechanic nearly died of thirst before being rescued by a nomad. Saint-Exupéry documented his experience in his book Wind, Sand and Stars. The event is thought to have inspired his most famous work, The Little Prince.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSkete\nDoor of Prophecies\nPikrolimni (lake)\nPachomian monasteries\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nM.

          "content": "## Overview\nWadi El Natrun is a valley in Lower Egypt. The valley contains several alkaline lakes, salt deposits, salt marshes and freshwater marshes. The area home to four historic Coptic monasteries still in use.\n\n## Understand\nWadi El Natrun is an area of low elevation northwest of Cairo. It's characterized by the presence of salt pans, marshes and \"natron\", a naturally occurring mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O, a kind of soda ash) and around 17% sodium bicarbonate (also called baking soda, NaHCO3) along with small quantities of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. It's a key ingredient to the mummification process, as a desiccant of deceased flesh. Natron was harvested here by the Ancient Egyptians, Coptics, and Romans, not to mention modern day Egyptians. For a period, there was also a tourist train to the low-lying lakes.\nWhat is possibly most significant about the area though is the presence of four historic Coptic monasteries still in use. These are the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, Paromeos Monastery, the Monastery of Saint Pishoy, and Syrian Monastery, collectively known as the monastic center of Scetis. From here, the Desert Fathers, with their asceticism, were very noteworthy in developing early Christianity from about 200-400 AD.\nAnother interesting point about the area is that it is believed to be the crash site of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1935, who, after managing to miraculously survive this and then almost dying later of thirst while trying to escape the desert, devised his story for The Little Prince.\n\n## Get in\nThis should be an easy drive from Cairo or Alexandria, being about halfway between the two on highway 75.\n\n## See\nWhen visiting the following monasteries, it is good to take a tour from a monk, to get a better picture of the background of these ancient places.

However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.\n\nWorld War II\nTwo important World War II battles were fought in the area:\n\nAt the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942), the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the Italian and German forces that were trying to outflank the Allies' position.\nAt the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 4 November 1942), Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: \"Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" After the war, he wrote: \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEl Alamein Fountain (war memorial commemorating the battle, in Sydney, Australia)\nEl Alamein International Airport\nEnham Alamein (village in Hampshire in England, renamed after the battle)\nMarina El Alamein (tourist resort)\nNew Alamein\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to El Alamein at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al 'Alamayn, Egypt\".

          "content": "## Overview\nEl Alamein (العلمين) is a city on the north coast of Egypt, famous as the site of major battles between British and German forces during the Second World War (see World War II in Africa).\nThis article also includes the adjacent areas of New Alamein, Marina el Alamein and Leukaspis. Marina-el-Alamein is a sea resort from the 1980s just north of El Alamein, and next to it is the archeological site Leukaspis (also known as Antiphrae).\nWinston Churchill once described El Alamein as having the best climate in the world and during the late 2010s the Egyptian government decided to make good use of El Alamein's touristic potential with the mega-project New Alamein. Resorts, skyscrapers and new residential areas are being built along the coast as part of that city since 2018.\n\n## Understand\nEl-Alamein is famous for the two Second World War battles fought here in 1942. The first battle took place on 27 July, when the German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika commanded by Erwin Rommel coming from Tobruk, Libya, managed to break through the lines of the British Commonwealth troops and advance to Height 26 west of El-Alamein.\nA few months later they tried to advance further, leading to the second battle that was fought between 23 October and 4 November. There the Axis tank army was beaten by the British 8th army commanded by Bernard Montgomery. In total, around 80,000 soldiers were wounded or killed in the two battles.\nFrom 1943 to 1947, German and Italian POWs, under the command of the British, collected the fallen from the battlefields and buried them in cemeteries in town. The temporary graves for the Axis soldiers were on Height 33. In 1955, works commenced on the German and Italian memorials, and they were finished in 1959. Today El Alamein is a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, known for its oil fields and for war tourism.\n\n## Marina el Alamein\nMarina el-Alamein, (مارينا العلمين, Mārīnā al-ʿAlamain), also known as Porto Marina or just Marina, is a yacht port just northeast of El Alamein. It's mostly a holiday resort for the domestic elite, designed by the Egyptian Amer group and built in the mid-1980s by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. There are hotels, restaurants, apartment buildings and the marina making up this district is placed around a lagoon, 4-6 m deep, connected to the Mediterranean.\n\n## Leukaspis\nEast of Marina El-Alamein is the Greek-Roman archaeological site of 30.82388829.0112569 Leukaspis, also known as Antiphrai. There's an entrance fee of 20 EGP for foreigners (10 EGP for foreign students).\nThe remains of a former port city stretches along the coast for about 1,600 m (one mile), though it's not right at the coast but about 600 m inland. Leukaspis is composed of a settlement part with a main square (agora) and remains of dwelling houses, a basilica from the 4th century, and a cemetery with mausoleums and tombs with superstructures.\n\n## New Alamein\nNew Alamein City (العلمين الجديدة al-ʿAlamain al-Ǧadīda) is a new city in construction since 2018, when President Abd al-Fattah as-Sisi laid the first stone. This megaproject is about developing a center for tourism, education and administration. Most of the city is between the Commonwealth and German military cemeteries, and the northern part if immediately west of Marina el-Alamein.\nThere are high apartment buildings along the coast, behind them a lagoon with canals. There are plans for a presidential palace, a building for ministries, three universities, 15 skyscrapers, and 30,000 hotel rooms, about a third of which have been built. Some buildings that are already finished include the El Masa mosque, a huge mall, restaurants, and three movie theaters.\n\n## By plane\nEl Alamein has an airport but as of late 2022 there are no scheduled flights. The closes airport is the El Alamein International Airport serving Alexandria (85 km from El Alamein) mainly with flights from the Middle East.

          "content": "Tanis ( TAY-niss; Ancient Greek: Τάνις [tánis]; Latin: Tanis ['tanɪs]) or San al-Hagar (Arabic: صان الحجر, romanized: Ṣān al-Ḥaǧar; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜥn.t [ˈcʼuʕnat]; Akkadian: 𒍝𒀪𒉡, romanized: Ṣaʾnu; Coptic: ϫⲁⲛⲓ or ϫⲁⲁⲛⲉ or ϫⲁⲛⲏ; Biblical Hebrew: צֹעַן‎, romanized: Ṣōʿan) is the Greek name for ancient Egyptian ḏꜥn.t, an important archaeological site in the northeastern Nile Delta of Egypt, and the location of a city of the same name. Tanis was the capital of the Egyptian Kingdom in its 21st and 22nd Dynasties. It is located on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up.\n\nHistory\nTanis is unattested before the 19th Dynasty of Egypt, when it was the capital of the 14th nome of Lower Egypt. A temple inscription datable to the reign of Ramesses II mentions a \"Field of Tanis\", while the city in se is securely attested in two 20th Dynasty documents: the Onomasticon of Amenope and the Story of Wenamun, as the home place of the pharaoh-to-be Smendes.\nThe earliest known Tanite buildings are datable to the 21st Dynasty. Although some monuments found at Tanis are datable earlier than the 21st Dynasty, most of these were in fact brought there from nearby cities, mainly from the previous capital of Pi-Ramesses, for reuse. Indeed, at the end of the New Kingdom the royal residence of Pi-Ramesses was abandoned because the Pelusiac branch of the Nile in the Delta became silted up and its harbour consequently became unusable.\nAfter Pi-Ramesses' abandonment, Tanis became the seat of power of the pharaohs of the 21st Dynasty, and later of the 22nd Dynasty (along with Bubastis). The rulers of these two dynasties supported their legitimacy as rulers of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt with traditional titles and building works, although they pale compared to those at the height of the New Kingdom. A remarkable achievement of these kings was the building and subsequent expansions of the Great temple of Amun-Ra at Tanis (at the time, Amun-Ra replaced Seth as the main deity of the eastern Delta), while minor temples were dedicated to Mut and Khonsu whom, along with Amun-Ra, formed the Theban Triad. The intentional emulation towards Thebes is further stressed by the fact that these gods bore their original Theban epithets, leading to Thebes being more commonly mentioned than Tanis itself. Furthermore, the new royal necropolis at Tanis successfully replaced the one in the Theban Valley of the Kings.\nAfter the 22nd Dynasty Tanis lost its status of royal residence, but became in turn the capital of the 19th nome of Lower Egypt. Starting from the 30th Dynasty, Tanis experienced a new phase of building development which endured during the Ptolemaic Period. It remained populated until its abandonment in Roman times.\nIn Late Antiquity, it was the seat of the bishops of Tanis, who adhered to the Coptic Orthodox Church.\nBy the time of John of Nikiû in the 7th century, Tanis appears to have already declined significantly, as it was grouped together with four other towns under a single prefect.\nThe 1885 Census of Egypt recorded San el-Hagar as a nahiyah in the district of Arine in Sharqia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 1,569 (794 men and 775 women).\n\nStudies and excavations\nThe first study of Tanis dates to 1798 during the French invasion of Egypt and Syria. Pierre Jacotin, a French engineer, drew up a map of the site in the Description de l'Égypte. It was first excavated in 1825 by Jean-Jacques Rifaud, who discovered the two pink granite sphinxes now in the Musée du Louvre. He was followed by François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette who excavated between 1860 and 1864. William Matthew Flinders Petrie oversaw excavation from 1883 to 1886. The work was taken over by Pierre Montet from 1929 to 1956, who discovered the royal necropolis dating to the Third Intermediate Period in 1939. The Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT) has been studying the site since 1965 under the direction of Jean Yoyotte and Philippe Brissaud, and François Leclère since 2013.\nThere has been much debate over whether or not Tanis could be the biblical city of Zoan in which the Hebrews would have suffered pharaonic slavery. Pierre Montet, in inaugurating his great excavation campaigns in the 1930s, began from the same premise. He was hoping to discover traces that would confirm the accounts of the Old Testament. His own excavations gradually overturned this hypothesis, even if he was defending this biblical connection until the end of his life. It was not until the discovery of Qantir/Pi-Ramesses and the resumption of excavations under Jean Yoyotte that the place of Tanis was finally restored in the long chronology of the sites of the delta.\n\nRuins\nThough Tanis was briefly explored in the early 19th century, the first large-scale archaeological excavations there were made by Auguste Mariette in the 1860s. In 1866, Karl Richard Lepsius discovered a copy of the Canopus Decree, an inscription in both Greek and Egyptian, at Tanis. Unlike the Rosetta Stone, discovered 67 years earlier, this inscription included a full hieroglyphic text, thus allowing a direct comparison of the Greek text to the hieroglyphs and confirming the accuracy of Jean-François Champollion's approach to deciphering hieroglyphs.\nDuring the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by Pierre Montet, then by Jean Yoyotte and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud. For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or Merenptah led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the Year 400 Stela at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former Hyksos capital, Avaris. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses (Qantir) and Avaris (Tell el-Dab'a) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to Amun, and a very important royal necropolis of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials, the tomb of Tutankhamun having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties – Psusennes I, Amenemope and Shoshenq II – survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by Pierre Montet and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, lapis lazuli and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\nToday, the main parts of the temple dedicated to Amun-Ra can still be distinguished by the presence of large obelisks that marked the various pylons as in other Egyptian temples. Now fallen to the ground and lying in a single direction, they may have been knocked down by a violent earthquake during the Byzantine era. They form one of the most notable aspects of the Tanis site. Archaeologists have counted more than twenty.\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the northern Thebes.\nIn 2009, the Egyptian Culture Ministry reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late 25th–early 26th Dynasty.\nIn 2011, analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery, led by archaeologist Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, found numerous related mud-brick walls, streets, and large residences, amounting to an entire city plan, in an area that appears blank under normal images. A French archeological team selected a site from the imagery and confirmed mud-brick structures approximately 30 cm below the surface. However, the assertion that the technology showed 17 pyramids was denounced as \"completely wrong\" by the Minister of State for Antiquities at the time, Zahi Hawass.\n\nNotable finds and artifacts\nIn Montet and other later archaeologists excavations of Tanis, many important and unique artifacts were found. When the sealed tombs of kings Psusennes I, Amenemope, and Shoshenq II, were opened by Montet, all three were discovered with their tombs completely intact with all of the original funerary offerings. All three kings were still adorned with their golden and gilded funerary masks - a rarity.\nAnother artifact is the Pectoral of King Amenemope, a piece of jewelry he would have worn hung around his neck on his chest. The icon depicts the godesses Isis and Nephthys holding a lapis lazuli scarab with the cartouche of Amenemope.\nIn the tomb of General Wendjebauendjed, the High Priest of Khonsu at Tanis, a series of bowls and cups made of gold were found by Montet. One of the golden bowls has a polychrome glass rosette of a flower at the center. The rosette is \"is thought... [to represent] the Unification of the Two Lands by combining the emblems of papyrus and lotus that are the two symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt.\"\n\nCultural references\nThe Biblical story of Moses being found in the marshes of the Nile River (Book of Exodus, Exodus 2:3–5) is often set at Tanis, which is often identified with Zoan (Hebrew: צֹועַן Ṣōʕan).\nIn the 1981 Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tanis is fictitiously portrayed as a lost city which was buried in antiquity by a massive sandstorm, before being rediscovered by a Nazi expedition looking for the Ark of the Covenant.\nThe Tanis fossil site, which may preserve unique remains from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, is named after the city. The paleontologist Robert de Palma chose the name based on the significance of Tanis in the decipherment of hieroglyphs, as well as its role in Raiders of the Lost Ark as the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nList of historical capitals of Egypt\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAssociation française d’Action artistique. 1987.

La première étude de Tanis date de 1798 et de l'expédition de Bonaparte en Égypte. L'ingénieur Pierre Jacotin en dressa le plan qui fut publié dans la Description de l'Égypte. Tanis a été fouillée en 1825 par Jean-Jacques Rifaud, qui y trouva les deux sphinx en granite rose du musée du Louvre, puis par Auguste Mariette entre 1860 et 1864, puis par William Matthew Flinders Petrie de 1883 à 1886. Les travaux ont été repris par Pierre Montet de 1929 à 1956. La Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT) étudie le site depuis 1965, sous la direction de Jean Yoyotte, puis de Philippe Brissaud, et enfin de François Leclère depuis 2013. \nLe visage de l’antique capitale apparaît peu à peu, sortant des brumes d’un site longtemps considéré comme peu intéressant par les égyptologues, ne présentant que peu de vestiges monumentaux, au contraire des sites proches du Caire ou de ceux, en bien meilleur état, de la Haute-Égypte. La découverte des tombes royales par Pierre Montet en 1939 changea la donne. Les travaux et études effectués depuis 1985 ont permis de formuler l’hypothèse que Tanis avait été conçue d’emblée par ses fondateurs comme une Thèbes du Nord.\nOn distingue encore aujourd’hui les principales parties du temple, grâce à la présence de ces grands obélisques qui marquaient les différents pylônes comme dans d’autres temples. Tous tombés au sol et couchés dans une direction unique, ils semblent avoir été abattus par un violent tremblement de terre durant l’époque byzantine. Ces obélisques forment d’ailleurs l’un des aspects les plus spectaculaires du site. Les archéologues en ont compté plus d’une vingtaine. L'accumulation de vestiges de différentes époques participa à la confusion des premiers archéologues, qui virent en Tanis la ville des temps bibliques dans laquelle les Hébreux auraient subi l’esclavage de pharaon. Pierre Montet, en inaugurant ses grandes campagnes de fouilles dans les années 1930, partait du même postulat, espérant ainsi découvrir des traces qui confirmeraient les récits de l’Ancien Testament. Ses fouilles allaient peu à peu infirmer cette hypothèse, même s'il en fut jusqu’à la fin le défenseur convaincu. Il fallut attendre la découverte de Qantir/Pi-Ramsès et la reprise des fouilles pour que la place de Tanis soit enfin restituée dans la longue chronologie des sites du delta.\n\nHistoire\nLa ville a longtemps été considérée comme la capitale de l'Égypte sous Ramsès II. Il n'en est rien, même si certaines traces le laissent paraître, notamment les innombrables blocs inscrits aux noms du célèbre pharaon. \nMais Tanis est surtout connue pour les trésors funéraires issus de la nécropole royale des rois tanites de la XXIe dynastie (tombes de Psousennès Ier, d'Amenemopet, du général Oundjebaoundjed) et de la XXIIe dynastie (sarcophage intact de Sheshonq II, caveaux violés de Takélot Ier, Osorkon II, Sheshonq III et Pami). L'ensemble découvert entre 1939 et 1946 par la mission Montet représente le trésor royal le mieux conservé d'Égypte après celui de Toutânkhamon.\n\nEn réalité, les Tanites voulaient reconstituer la capitale du Sud, Thèbes, dans le delta du Nil, une copie en quelque sorte. Mais la ville n'attint jamais la splendeur thébaine. \nÀ l'époque grecque, les souverains lagides embellirent la cité, qui devait être déjà un véritable musée en plein air tant elle comprenait de monuments déménagés, littéralement recomposés des anciens temples précédents sur le site ou importés des anciennes villes pharaoniques, y compris de sites des environs du Caire. C'est de Tanis que proviennent un grand nombre des statues et de colonnes qui ornent les collections des grands musées, y compris du Musée du Caire, comme les fameux sphinx d'Amenemhat III de la XIIe dynastie, dont l'aspect léonin est si singulier.\nLa cité conserva de l'importance jusqu'à l'époque romaine. Lors de la période byzantine, elle devint le siège d'un évêché. Avec la conquête arabe, elle tomba dans l'oubli comme les autres cités du delta oriental. Victime du même sort que la ville de Ramsès, ses monuments de pierre disparurent sous les coups des carriers et des chaufourniers.\nAujourd'hui, il n'en reste que des ruines, dont celles d'un temple d'Amon avec des obélisques et des statues, ainsi que la nécropole royale et le temple de Mout.\n\nTanis, nouvelle capitale et nécropole royale\nLes fouilles récentes effectuées à Tanis donnent une vision plus claire de la cité antique, qui vécut au rythme des vicissitudes de l'histoire de la Troisième Période intermédiaire puis de la Basse Époque.  \nLe temple d'Amon était orné de dix obélisques, placés par paires ou bien par groupe. Le téménos comportait un lac sacré et la nécropole royale qui fut utilisée par les pharaons des XXIe et XXIIe dynasties. Un téménos consacré à Mout se trouve au sud-ouest de celui d'Amon, développé selon un axe perpendiculaire.\nLe temple consacré à Amon fut fondé au début de la XXIe dynastie. Des traces repérées sur le site suggèrent que la ville apparut à la charnière des XXe et XXIe dynasties. Ce grand temple ne cessa d'être modifié par les souverains des dynasties suivantes, à l'instar du temple d'Amon-Rê de Karnak.\nÀ la suite de ces réaménagements, le temple, orienté est, occupe actuellement le centre de l'enceinte ptolémaïque, alors qu'initialement, l'enceinte de Psousennès, plus petite, le longeait par son mur sud. S'étendant sur une longueur de près de 400 mètres pour une façade de 100 mètres de largeur, il ouvrait à l'ouest par la Porte Monumentale, édifiée en granit par Sheshonq III, encadrée de colosses et statues royales. Elle desservait une avant-cour précédant un premier pylône édifié par Osorkon II et doté, à une date inconnue, d'une paire d'obélisques. Dans cette avant-cour, une colonnade palmiforme formait un kiosque monumental. Ces colonnes monolithes sont probablement des remplois de l'Ancien Empire comme les autres colonnes retrouvées à Tanis dans le temple de l'Est et celui de Mout. En effet, la capitale fut construite à l'aide de blocs, éléments architecturaux et statues provenant principalement de Pi-Ramsès. La grande porte de Sheshonq III est constituée de blocs parfois colossaux qui portent les décors originaux ayant appartenu aux temples de la capitale des XIXe et XXe dynasties.\n\nL'emplacement des tombes royales juste au sud de l'avant-cour marquait un déplacement de la nécropole royale au cœur du temple dynastique. Ce choix signe une période nouvelle pour les dynasties royales qui se succéderont alors en Égypte. En effet, l'abandon de Thèbes dès la XXIe dynastie comme nécropole royale officielle achevait de tourner la page du Nouvel Empire et de l'ère ramesside qui s'était vue plongée dans un chaos et une insécurité telle que les prêtres d'Amon eux-mêmes sous le pontificat des grands prêtres Hérihor et Pinedjem cachèrent les dépouilles royales en deux endroits différents, attestant que dès cette époque les trésors royaux avaient été pillés.  \nLa royauté s'était définitivement fixée au cœur du delta du Nil, déjà à Pi-Ramsès aux deux précédentes dynasties, et lorsqu'elle fut revendiquée par Smendès se réclamant de la succession du dernier des Ramsès, le choix fut fait de fonder une nouvelle capitale qui comprendrait en son cœur la nécropole royale, gage d'une sécurité recouvrée.\nÀ dater de cette époque les tombes royales seront systématiquement installées dans les temples des différentes capitales qui se succédèrent, et en cela les Ptolémées poursuivirent mais cette fois à Alexandrie, l'exemple des pharaons.\nLa découverte des tombes des XXIe et XXIIe dynasties confirmait d'une part les textes anciens qui attestent l'existence d'une nécropole royale également à Saïs. Mais elle éclaire aussi d'un jour nouveau cette période, qui par bien des égards est la digne héritière de l'époque ramesside, bien que cet héritage fût réutilisé en grande partie par les nouveaux monarques.\nEn effet, les tombes et tous les autres monuments du site comportent des blocs au nom de Ramsès II et de ses successeurs, qui furent débités et retaillés pour former les parois de nouvelles constructions décorées pour les nouveaux souverains. De même la plupart des obélisques viennent de la ville des Ramsès.\n\nLa Thèbes du Nord\nLe visage de l'antique capitale apparaît peu à peu, sortant des brumes d'un site longtemps considéré comme ingrat par les égyptologues, ne présentant que peu de vestiges au contraire des sites proches du Caire ou de ceux, en bien meilleur état, de la Haute-Égypte. La découverte des tombes royales changea quelque peu la donne. Les travaux et les études effectués depuis ont permis de formuler l'hypothèse que Tanis avait été conçue d'emblée par ses fondateurs comme une Thèbes du Nord.\nEn premier lieu, le grand temple d'Amon a révélé ses proportions, et un plan s'apparentant à celui de Karnak dépassait en taille celui de Louxor.\nAu-delà du premier pylône d'Osorkon II se trouvait une deuxième cour où se dressaient de grands colosses et à nouveau une paire d'obélisques, précédant un deuxième pylône que l'on date du pharaon Siamon de la XXIe dynastie. C’est dans cette cour que Auguste Mariette trouva en 1863 les sphinx à tête de lion et à masque humain. Datés par leur style du règne d’Amenemhat III, ils ont été réutilisés et réinscrits aux noms de Ramsès II puis de Mérenptah, avant d’être réinstallés à Tanis par Psousennès Ier. Pour l’occasion, le roi tanite fait graver ces sculptures déjà très anciennes à son nom qu’il place sur le torse des sphinx-lions. Ces remarquables exemples de la statuaire du Moyen Empire sont exposés au Musée du Caire.\nEnfin, un troisième pylône ouvrant sur le temple ne comportait pas moins de quatre obélisques et donnait sur un second axe, cette fois nord-sud, marquant l'emplacement d'un temple dédié à Khonsou-Néferhotep, l'enfant divin de la triade amonienne et qui daterait pour l'essentiel dans son dernier état de l'époque de Nectanébo Ier de la XXXe dynastie. \nLes fouilles effectuées par Pierre Montet à partir de 1928, puis par Jean Yoyotte et Philippe Brissaud à partir de 1965, ont révélé que le bâtiment, orienté nord-sud, était bâti en calcaire et reposait sur des fondations de briques qui délimitent le périmètre consacré. L’étude des fondations a permis d’identifier un certain nombre de fosses, contenant des restes d’offrandes alimentaires et de petits objets rituels complétant probablement des dépôts de fondation. \nParmi les découvertes faites dans les ruines du temple, une statue d’un babouin cynocéphale et les fragments d’une seconde statue, inscrites au nom de Psousennès Ier, révèlent que le sanctuaire était déjà en fonction sous ce roi. On notera par ailleurs qu’à Karnak, le temple de Khonsou, dont les dimensions sont comparables à celui de Tanis, une statue intacte d’un tel babouin faisant face au reste d’une seconde statue disparue, est toujours en place dans la salle hypostyle du petit temple, modèle de celui de Tanis. Non loin de ce dernier se trouve le lac sacré du domaine d’Amon. \nDécouvert et fouillé sur la même période que le temple de Khonsou, le lac fut édifié ou reconstruit à la XXXe dynastie. Les quais qui le forment sont bâtis, comme souvent à Tanis, avec des blocs remployés de monuments antérieurs. Fragments de colonnes et de chapiteaux de différents styles, morceaux de corniches, de tores d'angles, blocs décorés de reliefs, tout un ensemble épigraphique précieux est ainsi exhumé des murs du lac.\n\nCes vestiges de temples tanites jusque-là inconnus, sont constitués de remplois d'autres monuments anciens, certains remontant au Moyen Empire, d'autres au Nouvel Empire ou à des périodes plus proches de la date de leur utilisation pour le lac sacré. Ce sont notamment deux monuments qui retiennent l'attention tant par la quantité de blocs retrouvés que par la qualité des reliefs qu'ils portaient. Ils révèlent l'existence d'un sanctuaire datant de Sheshonq V ainsi qu’un autre datant du règne de Psammétique Ier de la XXVIe dynastie. L’étude de ces blocs attestent de l’existence d’édifices jubilaires à Tanis, dont l’emplacement reste pour le moment inconnu.\nLe temple d'Amon continuait vers l'est, longeant le lac sacré, et accédait au sanctuaire à proprement parler, dont seules les fondations et quelques assises sont parvenues jusqu'à nous. Accolés au mur d’enceinte en calcaire clôturant le sanctuaire, mur édifié ou reconstruit par Nectanébo Ier, deux autres obélisques marquaient l'emplacement d'un contre-temple consacré certainement au dieu sous sa forme solaire d'Amon-Rê, comme à Karnak.\nÀ l’instar de beaucoup de sites de Basse-Égypte, la ville de Tanis servit de carrière aux siècles qui suivirent la période romaine. Ainsi, presque tous les bâtiments construits en calcaire ont disparu dans les fours à chaux ou pour la construction de nouveaux édifices. Un certain nombre de fours à chaux furent installés sur le site même du temple de Khonsou, à la fin de l’Antiquité ou au Moyen Âge, livrant de grandes quantités de pierre calcaire réduites à l’état de fragments. C’est le signe d’une activité intense des carriers et autres récupérateurs de ce matériau de choix, rare dans cette région du delta. Seuls les blocs de granit ou de quartzite restèrent sur place car inutilisables.\nAu-delà de cette partie du temple, datée pour l'essentiel de son fondateur Psousennès Ier, qui édifia la première enceinte en briques crues, il existait un temple édifié à l’extérieur de l’enceinte. Il comportait lui aussi une cour avec un kiosque ou une salle à colonnes monolithes palmiformes en granit, datées de l’Ancien Empire, réutilisées par Ramsès II probablement à Pi-Ramsès, puis déménagées là et réinscrites aux cartouches d'Osorkon II, fondateur de cet édifice dont la nature nous échappe encore. Ce « temple de l'Est » fait actuellement l'objet d'un projet d'anastylose, qui permettrait de restituer quelque peu son aspect monumental dans le cadre du développement touristique du site.\nNon loin au sud de cette zone et ouvrant à l'est également, se trouve un temple consacré à Horus qui daterait au moins de Siamon. Il était donc, lui aussi, à l'époque de sa fondation, à l'extérieur de l'enceinte d'Amon. À la XXXe dynastie, ces deux sanctuaires sont inclus au périmètre du grand temple d’Amon, lorsque Nectanébo reconstruit l'enceinte, l'agrandissant considérablement, comme il l’avait fait pour Karnak à Thèbes.\n\nPlus au sud du tell principal qui recouvre la ville antique, des fouilles récentes ont révélé une autre enceinte dont il ne reste que les fondations. L’ensemble a été fouillé et a démontré que ce temple fut complètement rasé jusqu'à ses fondations à une époque et pour des raisons imprécises. Tout au plus peut-on certifier que la destruction de ce sanctuaire s’est produite dans l’Antiquité car par la suite la ville, qui ne cessa d’être habitée, a peu à peu recouvert ces vestiges et en a effacé le souvenir. On y a notamment découvert une statue insolite d'un chanteur d'Amon d'Opé assis sur le côté dont seule la partie inférieure est conservée avec son socle et inscriptions.\nCette nouvelle enceinte a permis de mieux comprendre le plan de Tanis et de confirmer que la capitale offrait vraiment un aspect comparable à celui de Thèbes de Haute-Égypte. Deux ensembles religieux reliés entre eux en forment le schéma directeur.\nL’étude des vestiges contenus dans la nouvelle enceinte, a révélé qu'un culte à Amon d'Opé y était rendu, à l'instar de Louxor pour l'Amon de Karnak. Le temple était probablement relié par une allée processionnelle au grand ensemble cultuel du nord composé de la grande enceinte comprenant le grand temple d’Amon avec son lac sacré et le temple de Khonsou, et juste au sud de cette enceinte celle du temple de Mout, dame d'Ishérou. \nCe temple de Mout, que l’on qualifie aussi de Temple d’Anta, a été remanié ou reconstruit par Ptolémée IV. Une grande colonnade, édifiée à la XXVIe dynastie, précédait la grande porte qui ouvrait sur le Nord, comme pour le temple de Mout à Thèbes, dont une colonne est aujourd'hui exposée au Musée du Louvre. Cette porte monumentale date en revanche de Siamon de la XXIe dynastie, démontrant ainsi que dès sa conception Tanis a été pensée comme une Thèbes du Nord.\nLa cité était la capitale dynastique de l'époque comme Thèbes fut celle des dynasties précédentes. Des processions semblables à la grande fête d'Opet devaient être menées par le roi et son épouse, perpétuant ainsi les cultes traditionnels. Les pharaons de Tanis montraient ainsi qu'ils occupaient légitimement le trône de leurs ancêtres prestigieux.\n\nTanis, métropole religieuse de la Basse Époque\nAvec les dernières dynasties et les Lagides, la cité eut à subir les troubles des invasions nubiennes, assyriennes puis perses avant de tomber sous la férule des rois macédoniens. C’est probablement pendant cette période chaotique, notamment pour les villes du delta, que le temple d’Amon d’Opé a été rasé. Cette destruction marque un nouveau développement de la cité qui se recentre autour de la grande enceinte nord qui est rebâtie sous les Nectanébo. Un autre temple dédié à l'Horus de Mesen est édifié à proximité de l'enceinte d'Amon. Lui aussi comporte une grande colonnade dont dix colonnes monolithes en granit ont été identifiées. Ce culte rendu à Horus, dieu de la royauté par excellence, démontre que la cité conserva un rôle religieux important aux yeux des souverains qui régnèrent sur l’Égypte pendant un demi-millénaire précédant la conquête romaine.\nLes rois lagides embellissent donc cette grande cité qui devait être déjà un véritable musée en plein air tant elle comprenait de monuments déménagés, littéralement recomposés des anciens temples précédents sur le site ou importés des anciennes villes pharaoniques, y compris de sites des environs du Caire et du Fayoum. C'est de Tanis que proviennent un grand nombre des statues et colonnes qui ornent les collections des grands musées, y compris du Musée égyptien du Caire, comme les fameux sphinx d'Amenemhat III de la XIIe dynastie, dont l'aspect léonin est si singulier. Dans l’enceinte d’Amon, tout un quartier artisanal s’installe au sud du grand temple, notamment sur les lieux mêmes de l’antique nécropole royale, l'enfouissant encore davantage sous les strates successives de la ville, et la préservant ainsi jusqu'à nos jours. \nEn dégageant le secteur, les archéologues ont mis au jour des ateliers construits en briques crues. Ceux-ci ont livré un grand nombre de modèles de sculpteurs, appréciables par leur qualité, ainsi que des quantités d’amulettes et petites figurines prophylactiques. Ces indices prouvent que le site était toujours le siège d’une intense activité religieuse, qui donnait lieu à des pèlerinages au cours desquels la production de ces ateliers était vendue aux dévots venus rendre hommage aux dieux de Tanis. \nPtolémée Ier fait édifier la grande porte est qui perce la partie orientale de l’enceinte de Nectanébo. Son fils et successeur Ptolémée II fait bâtir ou achever le temple d’Horus. Un quartier contemporain d’habitations de prêtres se forme à l’intérieur de l’enceinte, près de la porte sud. Une statue remarquable par sa qualité d'un grand prêtre tanite de cette période, nommé Panémérit, nous apporte un témoignage de la maîtrise des arts de la sculpture sous les Lagides. Ptolémée IV érige des stèles en l’honneur des dieux où il se fait figurer accompagné de son épouse Arsinoé III et fait reconstruire l’antique sanctuaire de Mout. Un des dépôts de fondation de ce remaniement est aujourd’hui exposé au Musée du Louvre.\n\nLa cité garde de l'importance jusqu'à l'époque romaine, puis est le siège d'un évêché à la période chrétienne pendant laquelle elle se nomme Djâni. Flavius Josèphe décrivant le monde dans lequel il vit au Ier siècle de notre ère, décrit la cité comme une bourgade encore importante. Sur une mosaïque de Doura Europos, représentant une carte du monde connu, la ville est figurée ceinte de remparts. Probablement qu'à cette époque les habitants s'étaient repliés au cœur de la cité derrière la formidable enceinte du vieux sanctuaire pharaonique.\nElle prend finalement le nom de Sân avec la conquête arabe, et tombe peu à peu dans l'oubli général dont ont souffert les cités du delta oriental. \nÀ Tanis, cette désaffection fut totale notamment à la suite de l'assèchement ou du déplacement du bras du fleuve qui jouxtait la ville, rendant son accès moins aisé et ses terres de moins en moins fertiles. Victime des mêmes calamités que subit en son temps la ville des Ramsès, elle disparaît sous les coups des carriers et de l'accumulation extraordinaire des différents niveaux continus d'occupation de la ville qui pendant plus de 1 500 ans la transformèrent en une haute colline dont l’essentiel reste encore à fouiller. C’est pourtant cet abandon complet, laissant la cité et ses temples enfouis dans une zone peu engageante et ingrate, qui permit aux premiers découvreurs du XIXe siècle puis aux égyptologues du XXe siècle de ressusciter l’antique capitale des XXIe et XXIIe dynasties et notamment la découverte de leur nécropole royale partiellement intacte.\nLa mission archéologique qui travaille sur place depuis le milieu des années 1960 est la Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT), créée pour faire suite à la Mission Montet qui travailla de 1929 à 1956. La Société française des fouilles de Tanis (SFFT) est une association privée de soutien initialement fondée pour aider la mission.\n\nFouilles actuelles\nLe téménos d'Amon\nOn peut encore distinguer aujourd'hui les principales parties du temple grâce à la présence de ces grands obélisques qui marquaient les différents pylônes comme d'autres temples à caractère solaire. Tous tombés au sol et couchés suivant une direction unique, ils pourraient avoir été abattus par un violent tremblement de terre durant l'époque byzantine. Ils forment d'ailleurs l'un des aspects les plus spectaculaires du site de Tanis. Lepsius lors de sa visite du site en 1845 dénombra quatorze monolithes encore visibles sur le site du grand temple, relevant les cartouches le plus souvent de Ramsès II ou dans une moindre mesure ceux de Mérenptah. Depuis les archéologues en ont dénombré plus d'une vingtaine dont deux de taille respectable ont été transférés au Caire afin d'orner d'une part l'aéroport d'Héliopolis, d'autre part un jardin public sur l'île de Gezireh.\nCette accumulation de vestiges de différentes époques participa à la confusion des premiers archéologues, qui virent en Tanis la ville des temps bibliques dans laquelle les Hébreux auraient subi l'esclavage de pharaon. Pierre Montet, en inaugurant ses grandes campagnes de fouilles dans les années 1930, partait du même postulat, espérant ainsi découvrir des traces qui confirmeraient les récits de l'Ancien Testament. Ses fouilles allaient peu à peu infirmer cette hypothèse, même s'il en fut jusqu'à la fin le défenseur convaincu. Il fallut attendre la découverte de Qantir / Pi-Ramsès et la reprise des fouilles par la Mission française des fouilles de Tanis pour que la place de Tanis soit enfin restituée dans la longue chronologie des sites du delta.\n\nLe temple d'Amon fut progressivement doté de quatre puits monumentaux en calcaire, entre les XXIIe et XXXe dynasties. Remaniés plusieurs fois, ces puits fonctionnaient simultanément à la fin de leur histoire. Au-delà du premier pylône attribué à Osorkon II se trouvait une deuxième cour suivie d'une paire d'obélisques précédant un deuxième pylône dont la date de construction est inconnue. Enfin un troisième pylône ouvrait sur le sanctuaire lui-même. Il était précédé de quatre obélisques. À ce niveau aboutissait un axe nord-sud, marquant l'emplacement du temple attribué à Khonsou-Néferhotep, l'enfant divin de la triade amonienne et datable de l'époque de Nectanébo Ier de la XXXe dynastie. Le temple d'Amon continuait vers l'est. La zone traditionnellement dite du sanctuaire n'est plus qu'un chaos de blocs de granit remployés et utilisés pour la plupart en fondation. Comme dans tous les sites de Basse-Égypte ce temple servit de carrière aux siècles qui suivirent la période romaine. Ainsi, les bâtiments, construits en calcaire, disparurent dans les fours à chaux ou pour la construction de nouveaux édifices. Seuls les blocs de granit et autres pierres dures restèrent sur place car plus difficilement réutilisables. Cela explique l'aspect ingrat des sites du delta comparés aux sites de Haute-Égypte, construits majoritairement de grès et situés au cœur d'une région moins développée démographiquement.\nUne paire d'obélisques marquait l'emplacement d'un « contre-temple » consacré certainement au dieu sous sa forme solaire d'Amon-Ré, comme à Karnak. Le temple était cependant clairement fermé à l'est par le double mur de clôture en calcaire délimitant le couloir mystérieux. Ces aménagements datent probablement de la période saïte et furent restaurés sous la XXXe dynastie par Nectanébo Ier. La zone était également close par l'enceinte de Psousennès Ier, formidable ouvrage de 27 mètres d'épaisseur, qui délimitait le téménos d'Amon sous les XXIe et XXIIe dynasties.\n\nDeux autres enceintes furent ensuite construites. La première, probablement d'époque saïte, n'est connue que dans la partie est du site. La seconde, beaucoup plus vaste vers l'est et le sud, fut édifiée à l'époque ptolémaïque, peut-être sur un projet de la XXXe dynastie.\nCe téménos élargi engloba à l'est des installations très mal connues dont il subsiste un kiosque formé initialement de dix colonnes monolithes en granite. Fruit de la destruction violente du site, un bloc d'abaque fut retrouvé dans les niveaux byzantins au sommet de la colline dite du Gharib-Sân. Les colonnes, datables de l'Ancien Empire, furent réutilisées par Ramsès II, puis par Osorkon II. Il n'est pas possible d'établir que leur emplacement actuel est attribuable à ce souverain. L'anastylos de cette colonnade permettrait de restituer son aspect monumental dans le cadre du développement touristique du site.\nÀ l'angle sud-est des deux enceintes tardives se trouve un temple consacré à Horus de Mesen. Le dernier état, actuellement visible, est daté de l'époque ptolémaïque. Divers indices archéologiques conduisent à penser qu'il existait un temple sous la XXXe dynastie. Il n'est pas à exclure qu'un premier temple fût construit dès la période saïte. Sous sa dernière forme, il s'ouvrait vers l'est, via un dromos de calcaire aboutissant à une porte monumentale datée par ses dépôts de fondation du règne de Ptolémée Ier. Deux lions couchés en granite protégeaient sa façade à l'est.\n\nLe téménos de Mout\nLe temple de Mout constitue désormais le terrain principal de l'actuel plan quadriennal de la mission. Entre 2001 et 2006, la mission s'est penchée de ce secteur, dans le cadre d'un programme de maîtrise du ruissellement des eaux de pluie et du retrait des déblais anciens et des terrains d'accumulation naturelle qui défiguraient l'ensemble du téménos de Mout. Cette zone est très prometteuse sur le plan archéologique, pour comprendre les modalités d'insertion d'un espace cultuel dans le tissu urbain, de la XXIe dynastie à la fin de l'époque romaine. Son étude bénéficie de tout l'acquis problématique des campagnes écoulées. Les fouilles menées depuis 2005 ont montré que la connexion des secteurs des téménos d'Amon et de Mout via la petite porte sud-ouest est nettement plus récente que l'enceinte ptolémaïque elle-même. Dans le domaine de Mout, une troisième enceinte inconnue, probablement saïte, a été découverte sous les segments nord et sud de l'enceinte ptolémaïque. L'enceinte de Siamon présente une forme très curieuse à l'angle nord-ouest. Peut-être son emprise sur le terrain est-elle plus vaste vers l'ouest et le sud.\nLe temple dégagé par Pierre Montet a été daté de Ptolémée IV grâce à des dépôts de fondation. Son histoire semble en fait avoir connu deux ou trois phases différentes, dont l'une est liée à un imposant défoncement du terrain plus au sud. Il n'est pas fondé, comme le pensait son découvreur, sur la gezirah, mais sur le sable de remplissage de la fosse de fondation d'un temple plus ancien et beaucoup plus vaste, puisque sa limite sud n'est qu'à une dizaine de mètres des enceintes saïte et ptolémaïque. Taillée dans des terrains de la Troisième Période intermédiaire postérieurs ou non à la construction de l'enceinte de Siamon, la fosse correspond à un état du temple (saïte ?) antérieur à la période hellénistique. Dans la partie nord, deux phases d'aménagement correspondant à la Troisième Période intermédiaire ont été mises en évidence. Le développement vers le sud de ces états est inconnu, oblitéré par les restructurations ultérieures. Le nettoyage presque complet des abords du temple ptolémaïque a montré qu'il n'existe quasiment aucune poche de gravats calcaires pouvant être mise en rapport avec les entreprises de récupération de matériaux par les chaufourniers byzantins. Il est probable que la maçonnerie de pierre avait été récupérée antérieurement, dans un cadre de récupération systématique évoquant la situation des parties antérieure et postérieure du temple d'Amon.\nEn octobre 2009, à une profondeur de douze mètres sous la surface du sol, dans la partie ouest du téménos, la MFFT a mis au jour par son angle sud-ouest l'arase du lac sacré du temple de Mout. Sa découverte confirme l'hypothèse de la similitude de conception entre Tanis et Thèbes. La maçonnerie de calcaire correspond à de nombreux blocs réutilisés portant des décors d'une remarquable qualité. En l'état actuel, le bâtiment est datable des XXVe et XXVIe dynasties.\nLe secteur de la rive sud du lac a vu se développer quatre puits monumentaux en calcaire. Deux se présentent comme des margelles cylindriques, les deux autres ne sont actuellement connus que par une partie de deux escaliers couverts.\n\nL'ensemble du Tell San el-Hagar\nLe tell est constitué par une série de chaînes de collines s'étendant sur trois kilomètres dans le sens nord-sud et sur un kilomètre et demi dans le sens est-ouest. Il est formé de terrains anthropiques installés sur le substrat géologique offert par la gezirah sableuse. Ces terrains peuvent atteindre trente mètres d'épaisseur. Ils ont été produits par l'installation au fil des siècles de constructions liées à l'évolution de la ville qui se sont développées en se superposant les unes aux autres. Les dernières étapes d'aménagement, abandonnées pendant près d'un millénaire et demi à l'action des éléments naturels, ont fini par prendre l'aspect des collines qui se présentent actuellement à nos regards.\nÀ l'extrême sud du tell, dans la zone dite es Tulul el-Bed, un nouveau téménos a été découvert récemment. Il a révélé qu'un culte à Amon d'Ope y était rendu, à l'instar de Louxor pour l'Amon de Karnak, venant ainsi valider l'hypothèse d'une réplique de Thèbes. La cité était la capitale dynastique de l'époque, comme Thèbes le fut pour les dynasties précédentes. Des processions semblables à la Grande Fête d'Opet devaient être menées par le roi et son épouse, perpétuant ainsi les cultes traditionnels. Les pharaons de Tanis montraient ainsi qu'ils occupaient légitimement le trône de leurs prestigieux ancêtres.\nCe temple fut totalement rasé jusqu'à ses fondations vers le milieu de l'époque ptolémaïque. Il fut ensuite recouvert par la ville. On y a découvert une exceptionnelle statue d'un chef des chanteurs d'Amon d'Opé, assis sur le côté, mais dont seule la partie inférieure est conservée avec son socle inscrit.\nDans la partie centrale du tell, une zone paraît avoir subi une transformation radicale. Dévolue depuis la Troisième Période intermédiaire au développement du tissu urbain, elle a fourni l'espace nécessaire pour l'implantation d'un très vaste temple consacré à Horus de Mesen durant la période ptolémaïque. Son domaine a été entouré par une très grand enceinte de brique crue qui s'ouvrait vers l'est par une porte monumentale dont le calcaire a été totalement récupéré. Dans ses vestiges fut trouvée une statue de faucon en granit fracassée.\nL'espace entre la porte et le temple fut occupé par une longue colonnade dont il ne subsiste plus qu'une partie des bases de granit. Les fûts ont intégralement disparu, peut-être constitués des tambours en calcaire dévorés par les chaufourniers byzantins. Du temple lui-même, il ne subsiste plus également aucun élément de pierre. Les fondations ont montré que le bâtiment a subi un agrandissement sensible dans le sanctuaire et dans le pylône. L'ensemble des constatations archéologiques correspond étonnamment aux inscriptions d'une statue de Panemerit, un ancien gouverneur de Tanis à la fin de la période ptolémaïque, et qui étaient difficilement compréhensibles quand elles étaient mises en relation avec le temple d'Amon.\n\nHomonymes et cinéma\nTanis est aussi un nom d'agglomération attesté dans le Fayoum antique.\nIl est aussi celui d'une commune française de la Manche. On le rencontre même aux États-Unis. \nBien que le film Les aventuriers de l'arche perdue ait été tourné au Maghreb, son action est censée se dérouler à Tanis. Une erreur y est d'ailleurs faite lorsque Indiana Jones, le héros du film, s'écrie au début « Les nazis ont découvert Tanis ! », alors que le site avait déjà été découvert longtemps avant.\nC'est aussi le nom d'une présumée racine aux propriétés mystérieuses dans le roman et le film Rosemary's Baby.\n\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nKarl Richard Lepsius, Denkmäler aus Ægypten und Æthiopen, vol.

          "summary": "Tanis est le nom grec de l’antique cité de Djanet (Djâni en copte), et aujourd'hui un important site archéologique du nord-est de l'Égypte, sur la branche tanitique du Nil. La première étude de Tanis date de 1798 et de l'expédition de Bonaparte en Égypte. L'ingénieur Pierre Jacotin en dressa le plan qui fut publié dans la Description de l'Égypte. Tanis a été fouillée en 1825 par Jean-Jacques Rifaud, qui y trouva les deux sphinx en granite rose du musée du Louvre, puis par Auguste Mariette entre 1860 et 1864, puis par William Matthew Flinders Petrie de 1883 à 1886. Les travaux ont été repris par Pierre Montet de 1929 à 1956. La Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT) étudie le site depuis 1965, sous la direction de Jean Yoyotte, puis de Philippe Brissaud, et enfin de François Leclère depuis 2013. \nLe visage de l’antique capitale apparaît peu à peu, sortant des brumes d’un site longtemps considéré comme peu intéressant par les égyptologues, ne présentant que peu de vestiges monumentaux, au contraire des sites proches du Caire ou de ceux, en bien meilleur état, de la Haute-Égypte. La découverte des tombes royales par Pierre Montet en 1939 changea la donne. Les travaux et études effectués depuis 1985 ont permis de formuler l’hypothèse que Tanis avait été conçue d’emblée par ses fondateurs comme une Thèbes du Nord.\nOn distingue encore aujourd’hui les principales parties du temple, grâce à la présence de ces grands obélisques qui marquaient les différents pylônes comme dans d’autres temples. Tous tombés au sol et couchés dans une direction unique, ils semblent avoir été abattus par un violent tremblement de terre durant l’époque byzantine. Ces obélisques forment d’ailleurs l’un des aspects les plus spectaculaires du site. Les archéologues en ont compté plus d’une vingtaine. L'accumulation de vestiges de différentes époques participa à la confusion des premiers archéologues, qui virent en Tanis la ville des temps bibliques dans laquelle les Hébreux auraient subi l’esclavage de pharaon. Pierre Montet, en inaugurant ses grandes campagnes de fouilles dans les années 1930, partait du même postulat, espérant ainsi découvrir des traces qui confirmeraient les récits de l’Ancien Testament. Ses fouilles allaient peu à peu infirmer cette hypothèse, même s'il en fut jusqu’à la fin le défenseur convaincu. Il fallut attendre la découverte de Qantir/Pi-Ramsès et la reprise des fouilles pour que la place de Tanis soit enfin restituée dans la longue chronologie des sites du delta.",

          "content": "Bubastis (Bohairic Coptic: Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ Poubasti; Greek: Βούβαστις Boubastis or Βούβαστος Boubastos), also known in Arabic as Tell-Basta or in Egyptian as Per-Bast, was an ancient Egyptian city. Bubastis is often identified with the biblical Pi-Beseth (Hebrew: פי-בסת py-bst, Ezekiel 30:17). It was the capital of its own nome, located along the River Nile in the Delta region of Lower Egypt, and notable as a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, and therefore the principal depository in Egypt of mummies of cats. \nIts ruins are located in the suburbs of the modern city of Zagazig.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Bubastis in Egyptian is Pr-Bȝst.t, conventionally pronounced Per-Bast but its Earlier Egyptian pronunciation can be reconstructed as /ˈpaɾu-buˈʀistit/. It is a compound of Egyptian pr (“house\") and the name of the goddess Bastet; thus the phrase means \"House of Bast\". In later forms of Egyptian, sound shifts had altered the pronunciation. In Bohairic Coptic, the name is rendered Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ, Ⲡⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ or Ⲃⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ.\n\nHistory\nBubastis served as the capital of the nome of Am-Khent, the 18th nome of Lower Egypt. Bubastis was situated southwest of Tanis, upon the eastern side of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile. The nome and city of Bubastis were allotted to the Calasirian division of the Egyptian war-caste.\n\nSecond Dynasty\nIn a later account by the Greek historian Manetho, it's stated that a \"chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished\" during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy in the Second Dynasty.\n\nTwelfth Dynasty\nIn the Middle Kingdom, Tell Basta was the site of a large mudbrick palace (16,000 sqm) dated to the Twelfth Dynasty. It has been thought to be a residence of Amenemhat III. A limestone lintel shows the king during his Heb Sed Festival.\n\nSecond Intermediate Period\nFollowing the Twelfth Dynasty, the Middle Kingdom faded out. At Bubastis, a red granite architrave belonged to Sekhemre Khutawy Khabaw. In another monument found at Tanis, he is mentioned along with Hor.\n\nTwenty-Second Dynasty\nIt became a royal residence after Shoshenq I, the first ruler and founder of the 22nd Dynasty, became pharaoh in 943 BC. Bubastis was its height during this dynasty and the 23rd. It declined after the conquest by Cambyses II in 525 BC, which heralded the end of the Saite 26th Dynasty and the start of the Achaemenid Empire.\nThe Twenty Second Dynasty of Egyptian monarchs consisted of nine, or, according to Eusebius of three Bubastite kings, and during their reigns the city was one of the most considerable places in the Delta. Immediately to the south of Bubastis were the allotments of land with which Psamtik I rewarded the services of his Ionian and Carian mercenaries; and on the northern side of the city commenced the Canal of the Pharaohs, which Pharaoh Necho II began (but never finished) to go between the Nile and the Red Sea.\n\nPersian rule and decline\nAfter Bubastis was taken by the Persians, its walls were dismantled. From this period it gradually declined, although it appears in ecclesiastical annals among the episcopal sees of the province Augustamnica Secunda. Bubastite coins of the age of Hadrian exist.\nThe following is the description which Herodotus gives of Bubastis, as it appeared shortly after the period of the Persian invasion, 525 BC, and Hamilton remarks that the plan of the ruins remarkably warrants the accuracy of this historical eye-witness:\n\nTemples there are more spacious and costlier than that of Bubastis, but none so pleasant to behold. It is after the following fashion. Except at the entrance, it is surrounded by water: for two canals branch off from the river, and run as far as the entrance to the temple: yet neither canal mingles with the other, but one runs on this side, and the other on that. Each canal is a hundred feet wide, and its banks are lined with trees. The propylaea are sixty feet in height, and are adorned with sculptures (probably intaglios in relief) nine feet high, and of excellent workmanship. The Temple being in the middle of the city is looked down upon from all sides as you walk around; and this comes from the city having been raised, whereas the temple itself has not been moved, but remains in its original place. Quite round the temple there goes a wall, adorned with sculptures. Within the inclosure is a grove of fair tall trees, planted around a large building in which is the effigy (of Bast). The form of that temple is square, each side being a stadium in length. In a line with the entrance is a road built of stone about three stadia long, leading eastwards through the public market. The road is about 400 feet (120 m) broad, and is flanked by exceeding tall trees. It leads to the temple of Hermes.\n\nReligion\nBubastis was a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, sometimes called Bubastis after the city, who the Greeks identified with Artemis. The cat was the sacred and peculiar animal of Bast, who is represented with the head of a cat or a lioness and frequently accompanies the deity Ptah in monumental inscriptions. The tombs at Bubastis were accordingly the principal depository in Egypt of the mummies of the cat.\nThe most distinguished features of the city and nome of Bubastis were its oracle of Bast, the splendid temple of that goddess and the annual procession in honor of her. The oracle gained in popularity and importance after the influx of Greek settlers into the Delta, since the identification of Bast with Artemis attracted to her shrine both native Egyptians and foreigners.\nThe festival of Bubastis was considered the most joyous and gorgeous of all in the Egyptian calendar as described by Herodotus:\n\nBarges and river craft of every description, filled with men and women, floated leisurely down the Nile. The men played on pipes of lotus. the women on cymbals and tambourines, and such as had no instruments accompanied the music with clapping of hands and dances, and other joyous gestures. Thus did they while on the river: but when they came to a town on its banks, the barges were made fast, and the pilgrims disembarked, and the women sang, playfully mocked the women of that town and threw their clothes over their head. When they reached Bubastis, then held they a wondrously solemn feast: and more wine of the grape was drank in those days than in all the rest of the year. Such was the manner of this festival: and, it is said, that as many as seven hundred thousand pilgrims have been known to celebrate the Feast of Bast at the same time.\n\nChristian bishopric\nExtant documents mention the names of three Christian bishops of Bubastis of the 4th and 5th centuries:\n\nHarpocration, one of the bishops ordained by Melitius of Lycopolis listed in 325\nHermon, a contemporary of Athanasius of Alexandria, in about 362\nIulianus at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449\n\nExcavations\nThe tomb of the late New Kingdom vizier Iuty was discovered in December 1964 in the \"Cemetery of the Nobles\" of Bubastis by the Egyptian archaeologist Shafik Farid.\nSince 2008, the German-Egyptian \"Tell Basta Project\" has been conducting excavations at Bubastis. Previously, in March 2004, a well preserved copy of the Decree of Canopus was discovered in the city.\n\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

          "content": "Tell Basta est le nom arabe de la ville antique de Per Bast(et) (en égyptien) que les Grecs nommeront Boubastis. L'actuelle ville de Zagazig se trouve juste au nord-ouest du site de Tell Basta.\n\nLa ville\nSituée dans le delta du Nil, à 80 km au nord-est du Caire, la capitale actuelle de l'Égypte, elle est connue pour avoir accueilli un sanctuaire de la déesse Bastet (aujourd'hui en ruine). On y a retrouvé une grande quantité de chats momifiés, témoignage du culte voué à cet animal en ce lieu.\nElle était la capitale du 18e nome d'Égypte (L'enfant royal supérieur). Son nom, qui vient de l'égyptien antique Per Bastet (ou Per Bast), signifie « la maison de Bastet ».\nBastet ou Sekhmet était représentée sous la forme d'une déesse assise ou debout à tête de lionne. Elle fut assimilée à différentes déesses majeures de l'Égypte, comme Sekhmet ou encore Hathor toutes deux représentant, par ailleurs, deux aspects différents de la même divinité, la fille de Rê. Ainsi elle était étroitement associée à la mythologie solaire et apparaît dans les textes tardifs comme étant ramenée apaisée par le dieu Thot à son père sous la forme d'une chatte (voir le mythe de l'œil de Rê).\n\nLes ruines de Bubastis s'étendent sur une surface de près de 80 hectares. Malheureusement, seule une petite partie du kom relevé au XIXe siècle est accessible aujourd'hui aux fouilles, le reste des vestiges ayant été engloutis sous les cultures ou recouverts par l'essor continu de la ville de Zagazig.\nLe site remonte pourtant aux temps prédynastiques. Une nécropole de cette période a été mise au jour au nord du temple de Bastet, non loin de la nécropole de l'Ancien Empire. À cette époque, la cité était le pendant du sanctuaire d'Hathor de Dendérah que l'on désignait également sous le nom de Per-Bast du Sud. La ville semble avoir été particulièrement embellie à la fin de cette période. En effet Téti et Pépi Ier, pharaons de la VIe dynastie, y fondèrent des temples du Ka, exemples uniques qui nous soient parvenus de l'extension du culte royal en dehors de la région memphite. Bastet apparaissait alors comme l'aspect léonin de la fille de Rê.\n\nLa ville possédait d'ailleurs un temple d'Atoum, dont on a retrouvé les vestiges au sud du kom actuel, et formait ainsi avec ceux de Bastet et de Mahès le siège d'une triade divine particulièrement honorée tout au long de l'histoire égyptienne.\nAvec la conquête romaine, puis la fin de l'Antiquité, le site tomba dans l'oubli progressivement et ne reprit vraiment un rôle central qu'à partir du XIXe siècle avec la modernisation du pays et la mise en valeur des terres riches du delta dans une économie qui devait alors absorber une croissance démographique rapide qui, par ailleurs, n'a cessé depuis. Cela explique pourquoi les vestiges sont disséminés au milieu de la ville moderne, un peu comme certains quartiers du Caire ou de l'Alexandrie d'aujourd'hui qui, à l'occasion d'un chantier ou d'une restauration, laissent parfois s'échapper des pans entiers de l'histoire de la ville.\nC'est alors la course contre le temps qui s'engage et le plus souvent seules des fouilles de sauvetage permettent d'étudier un moment cette résurgence archéologique d'un lointain passé sur laquelle la ville moderne ne peut s'arrêter qu'un instant.\nLorsque les fouilles débutèrent à la fin du XIXe siècle, les ruines de Bubastis présentaient alors l'aspect d'un gigantesque tell qui recouvrait ses vestiges et c'est précisément à l'occasion d'une de ces percées dépendantes du développement agricole de la région que la nécropole des chats sacrés de Bastet fut mise au jour au nord du site. La découverte était alors inédite et l'on retrouva, outre une quantité importante de momies du félin, des bronzes représentant la déesse sous sa forme de chatte qui ornent aujourd'hui les collections d'égyptologie de la plupart des musées. Il s'agit là sans doute d'une de ces « cachettes » aménagées par les prêtres qui régulièrement devaient vider l'enceinte du temple des innombrables ex-voto que les fidèles déposaient auprès de leur déesse.\nPlusieurs de ces découvertes ont eu lieu depuis sur d'autres sites, la plus célèbre étant celle faite à Karnak dans une cour du temple d'Amon-Rê. Pour Bubastis, les enfouissements de ces « encombrantes » offrandes eurent  régulièrement lieu, le temple faisant l'objet d'une dévotion particulière surtout à la fin de l'histoire pharaonique du pays.\n\nLes nécropoles\nAu sud du cimetière des chats, plusieurs koms indiquent l'emplacement des nécropoles de la ville, qui s'y implantèrent dès la période prédynastique. Des fouilles récentes menées par l'université de Zagazig ont permis d'étudier les niveaux de l'Ancien Empire dégageant plusieurs mastabas dont les dimensions importantes reflètent l'importance de la cité des premiers temps, mais également des sépultures plus humbles, très souvent intactes, livrant un mobilier funéraire pauvre, mais instructif sur les coutumes funéraires d'alors. Les corps étaient inhumés en position contractée la tête orientée à l'ouest et l'on plaçait autour d'eux des offrandes contenues le plus souvent dans de simples récipients en céramique. Cette pratique est d'ailleurs attestée jusqu'à la fin de l'Ancien Empire voire au-delà grâce aux inscriptions découvertes dans ces tombes.\nLes tombeaux de la haute société bubastite étaient bien sûr beaucoup plus élaborés, prenant l'aspect de mastaba classiques, construits en briques crues, et dont les caveaux étaient souvent voûtés. Ces tombeaux nous ont révélé les noms et les titres de plusieurs dignitaires des IVe, Ve et VIe dynasties, jusqu'ici inconnus, et qui, au vu de leurs monuments funéraires, avaient été distingués par Pharaon pour leur dévotion à Bastet.\n\n \nAinsi, un directeur des prêtres du temple, Ânkh-haef, contemporain de Pépi II, se fit aménager des appartements funéraires parementés de calcaire peint et inscrits de prières à Osiris et Anubis, premiers témoins des textes funéraires qui seront plus tard regroupés dans différents corpus que l'on désigne par le terme usuel de « Livre des Morts ».\nUn peu plus au sud se trouve la nécropole du Nouvel Empire, dont les dimensions démontrent là encore que Bubastis était alors l'une des principales métropoles de la région.\nEn effet au Moyen Empire, la cité et ses temples ont été également privilégiés par les souverains de la XIIe dynastie. Un complexe palatial, peut-être rituel, est construit toujours dans le voisinage des nécropoles des périodes précédentes, au nord du temple qui lui, fait l'objet d'un programme architectural monumental au vu des vestiges qui y ont été retrouvés, même s'il est difficile d'en restituer l'aspect d'alors, tant le sanctuaire a été remanié aux périodes suivantes ou de s'assurer que ces vestiges proviennent bien de Bubastis, les blocs et colonnes ayant pu être remployés aux époques suivantes depuis d'autres sites délaissés, comme ce fut le cas pour certaines cités majeures du delta (voir plus bas).\n\nLe palais du Moyen Empire\nLe palais en question que l'on a hésité un temps à identifier comme un temple, est d'un plan assez complexe et d'une vaste envergure pour une ville qui, somme toute, n'était alors pas la résidence royale. Les vestiges mis au jour nous ont conservé son plan partiellement et subsistent sur les premières assises de briques crues qui le composaient. L'ensemble découvert couvre une vaste surface de 4 800 m2, ce qui, rappelons-le, n'est qu'une partie du palais initial, le reste se trouvant sous la ville moderne actuelle. Cet imposant complexe se composait principalement d'une avant-cour donnant sur ce qui aurait pu être un pylône ou encore un portail ouvrant sur une cour péristyle d'accueil suivie d'une salle hypostyle comportant au moins six colonnes, et qu'il est séduisant d'imaginer plus vaste et comme étant la salle du trône.\nDe part et d'autre de cet espace public, divers bâtiments enfermés dans une enceinte assez épaisse devaient alors être consacrés aux diverses fonctions palatiales et administratives nécessaires à tout complexe royal.\nL'un des éléments caractéristiques des palais de l'époque était la séparation nette entre le monde profane et royal, y compris au sein du palais, assurée par des murs isolant les différentes parties les unes des autres. Cela dénote une organisation administrative et fonctionnelle hiérarchisée, et dont l'accès était sans doute sévèrement contrôlé par une unique entrée aménagée dans chaque mur qui ceignait chaque ensemble. La partie la plus isolée et restreinte en termes d'accès étant probablement celle concernant les appartements privés de la famille royale, mais malheureusement cette partie n'a pu être dégagée.\nSi l'on suit le schéma classique du fonctionnement du palais proposé par Stephen Quirke pour désigner ces différentes parties, pour celles préservées à Bubastis, nous aurions alors affaire, « seulement », aux ruines du palais externe (khenty), une partie de la salle d'audience (ouakhy), ainsi qu'une partie des greniers ou magasins (schena) qui assuraient le ravitaillement de la Grande Maison et pouvaient également stocker les revenus issus du commerce ou encore les tributs versés par les vassaux du Pharaon.\nCet ensemble est un exemple rare des complexes palatiaux édifiés au Moyen Empire par les souverains qui devaient donc se déplacer avec la cour dans les villes majeures du pays, manifestant ainsi une énergie et une activité royale qui cadrent bien avec la volonté affichée de réformer l'État à partir de la seconde moitié de la XIIe dynastie.\nUne des raisons de cet intérêt et du développement de Bubastis est sans nul doute l'exploitation intensive des mines de la péninsule du Sinaï, ainsi que du légendaire pays de Pount, dont les expéditions maritimes ou terrestres pouvaient parfois comporter plus de 5 000 hommes. Il fallait donc une administration efficace et proche du terrain des opérations afin d'assurer leur ravitaillement, et Bubastis se trouvait idéalement placée comme base arrière de ces missions essentielles à l'économie du pays.\n\nSelon le matériel retrouvé sur le site, ce palais semble remonter en effet au moins à Amenemhat III et avoir été en activité jusqu'à la seconde période intermédiaire, dénotant un intérêt croissant de l'administration royale pour cette partie du pays, qui, déjà à l'époque subissait de profonds changements avec l'arrivée régulière puis la sédentarisation de populations venant de Palestine. Il fallut alors probablement sinon bloquer, du moins contrôler davantage ces flux migratoires dans le delta oriental dont on sait qu'ils débutèrent dès le début du Moyen Empire. À cette époque, les régions limitrophes étaient pour le reste sous l'influence de l'Égypte, et ces mouvements de populations ne devaient alors pas représenter un réel danger.\nCependant plusieurs fondations royales de la XIIe dynastie sont attestées dans la région, notamment sur le site de la future capitale des Hyksôs, Avaris. Les derniers souverains de la XIIe dynastie, peut-être déjà conscients du risque que cette « invasion » progressive représentait et qui pesait déjà sur l'équilibre des forces en présence, ont sans doute cherché à asseoir davantage leur autorité à travers ce complexe palatial, retardant un temps l'échéance et la rupture qui ne sera d'ailleurs consommée que près de deux siècles plus tard, le temps que l'autorité du pouvoir se désagrège progressivement sous la XIIIe dynastie.\nBubastis tombera alors sous l'influence de ces « princes des pays étrangers » (Heka-khasout) qui, sous les XVe et XVIe dynasties, régneront sur tout ou partie du Double Pays.\n\nL'apogée de Bubastis\nAu Nouvel Empire, Bubastis revient au-devant de la scène avec le culte de Bastet qui s'exprima au travers du chat qui était alors l'hypostase vivante de la déesse dont la popularité ne cesse de croître à travers tout le pays. On en vint même à inaugurer un nouveau centre cultuel, puis une nouvelle nécropole consacrée au félin à Saqqarah, non loin de l'ancien complexe funéraire de Téti. Cette colline appelée depuis par les égyptologues colline du Bubastéïon est devenue une nécropole dans laquelle les grands du royaume de la XVIIIe dynastie se font aménager des hypogées qui ont été redécouverts récemment par les archéologues.\nBubastis est aussi une des étapes essentielles des rites de la fête-Sed, qui sanctionnent les trente premières années de règne du souverain. Ainsi, sous Amenhotep III, elle figure parmi les grandes cités que le roi visitera au cours de son jubilé. À cette occasion, il fera édifier une chapelle pour célébrer l'évènement et installera, insigne honneur, des statues de ses hauts fonctionnaires dans les sanctuaires de la ville, dont notamment deux de son vizir Amenhotep dit Houy représenté en scribe assis en tailleur, et de Khérouef, le Grand intendant de son épouse royale Tiyi.\nPar sa proximité avec Pi-Ramsès à la XIXe dynastie, Bubastis est particulièrement honorée par Ramsès II qui embellira ou reconstruira le temple de la déesse (voir plus bas). La ville jouit alors d'une grande réputation et ses notables progressent peu à peu dans la hiérarchie ramesside au point d'en contrôler les principaux postes. En effet, il semble au vu du nombre de personnalités issues de Bubastis qui entourent Sethnakht puis Ramsès III, que c'est de Bubastis que soient issus les militaires qui assureront le dernier sursaut du Nouvel Empire avec la XXe dynastie. La famille royale serait elle-même probablement native de cette région, comme autrefois celle de Ramsès Ier serait originaire d'une autre localité bien connue, Avaris.\nMais c'est surtout à dater de la Troisième Période intermédiaire que Bubastis devient célèbre, et, comme nombre de sites du delta tels Tanis ou Mendès, profita de l'installation définitive de la royauté en Basse-Égypte.\nElle fut en effet le berceau de la XXIIe dynastie fondée par Sheshonq Ier, qui marque l'avènement de pharaons d'origines probablement amazighes, entre -945 et -817. Cette dynastie de pharaons que les égyptologues qualifient de « libyens », car issus des peuplades venant de Libye qui s'installèrent dans le delta du Nil à la fin de la période ramesside, portaient le titre de « Grands Chefs des Mâ ». Ils contrôlaient les forces armées qui garantissaient la sécurité du royaume des pharaons de Tanis à la XXIe dynastie. Lors de l'avènement de Sheshonq Ier, la royauté était affaiblie entre le pouvoir spirituel contrôlé à Thèbes par les prêtres d'Amon et le pouvoir royal basé à Tanis, la « Thèbes du Nord ». Sheshonq reconstitua sous son règne l'unité du royaume. Avec cette nouvelle dynastie, les temples furent restaurés, voire agrandis, comme l'attestent les portiques dits des Bubastides à Karnak, entre le premier et le second pylône du grand temple d'Amon.\nLes pharaons de la XXIIe dynastie firent alors preuve d'une énergie considérable dans leur programme architectural. Non seulement ils restaurèrent ou firent reconstruire le temple de Bastet, se réappropriant des édifices, ou tout du moins leurs éléments, remontant au Moyen Empire, mais en plus on retrouve leur intervention, le plus souvent de manière magistrale, dans les principaux temples du pays tels Karnak ou Tanis.\nBubastis, qui était alors la principale cité des chefferies des Mâ, devint le nouveau centre du pouvoir, bien que la nécropole royale de la XXIIe dynastie ait été retrouvée à Tanis. En effet, outre les caveaux d'Osorkon II, de Sheshonq II et Sheshonq III retrouvés pillés aux côtés des tombeaux de la XXIe dynastie, un Sheshonq fut réinstallé dans l'antichambre du caveau de Psousennès Ier, sans doute à la suite d'un premier pillage, et fut retrouvé par la mission de Pierre Montet en 1939, dans son sarcophage en argent massif à tête de faucon. La momie portait un masque d'or massif dépourvu cependant des classiques attributs royaux (barbe postiche et uræus), témoin sans doute de l'anarchie qui débutait alors. La dépouille du roi était toutefois couverte de bijoux prophylactiques d'une grande finesse attestant la maîtrise des arts et de l’orfèvrerie des ateliers royaux de la XXIIe dynastie.\nAvec la Basse époque, les sanctuaires de Bubastis reçurent les hommages de chaque pharaon étant parvenu à repousser les menaces étrangères, devenant ainsi le siège d'un courant nationaliste puissant en réaction aux menaces des dominations assyriennes, puis perses. Le développement des cultes d'hypostases à cette époque traduit cette réaction du peuple égyptien qui concentra alors sa dévotion sur les manifestations vivantes de leurs dieux pour défendre le pays contre le danger permanent d'une invasion.\nBastet devenait alors le chat sacré qui, à la proue de la barque du dieu Rê, repoussait la menace du serpent Apophis, garantissant ainsi le retour du dieu-soleil chaque matin.\n\nPharaon, fils de Rê, en marquant sa dévotion à la déesse, participait au rétablissement du monde chaque jour et garantissait l'intégrité du royaume. Les Nectanébo, bien qu'originaires de Sebennytos, semblent avoir pleinement rempli cette fonction en consacrant un nouveau sanctuaire au cœur même du temple de la déesse.\n\nLes temples de Bubastis\nLe temple de Bastet\nLe sanctuaire principal de la ville était un temple dédié à la déesse Bastet qui était ceint d'une grande enceinte de briques crues et dont Hérodote au -Ve siècle laissa une description saisissante.\nPhénomène classique dans l'évolution des villes antiques, les générations successives construisaient leur habitat par-dessus celui de leurs ancêtres élevant peu à peu le niveau du sol de la ville. Seul le sanctuaire divin restait ainsi au niveau d'origine l'enfonçant peu à peu au cœur de la ville (un phénomène similaire est encore remarquable à Esna au sud de Louxor). C'est pourquoi l'auteur grec put en faire le tour et une description plongeante, nous laissant de précieuses informations sur le temple et ses environs.\nIl décrit alors un temple entouré sur trois de ses côtés par une large pièce d'eau que l'on peut restituer comme étant un lac en forme de croissant de lune tel celui du temple de Mout à Karnak et que les Égyptiens nommaient Ishérou.\nLe temple était orienté est-ouest et offre aujourd'hui les vestiges d'une salle hypostyle aux bases et chapiteaux de colonnes imposants. L'ensemble est réduit aux premières assises et présente un vaste champ chaotique de blocs finement sculptés abandonnés là par les carriers des époques ultérieures. De nombreux chapiteaux dits « hathoriques », parce qu'à l'image de la tête de la déesse, qui ornaient autrefois le grand hall d'entrée du sanctuaire, furent retrouvés et dispersés dans différents musées du monde. L'essentiel des vestiges date de la Basse époque.\nMesurant près de 200 mètres de longueur, le temple était constitué d'au moins un grand pylône de cinquante mètres de large, donnant accès à une ou deux cours successives (2e pylône ?) ouvrant sur le grand hall aux colonnes hathoriques édifié par Osorkon II de la XXIIe dynastie.\nC'est dans la première cour du temple que l'on a retrouvé deux blocs inscrits aux noms de Khéops et de Khéphren de la IVe dynastie, utilisés en remploi dans des fondations. Ces deux témoins attestent ainsi de l'ancienneté du sanctuaire.\n\nCe sont des premières cours également que proviennent les grandes colonnes monolithes de style palmiforme dont les chapiteaux élancés couronnent des fûts lisses qui ont reçu la marque de Ramsès II. Ces colonnes sont probablement des remplois de l'Ancien Empire tant leur style est comparable à celles qui restent encore visibles à Abousir ou à Saqqarah. En effet les rois des Ve et VIe dynasties en firent venir des chargements entiers des carrières de granit d'Assouan afin d'orner leurs sanctuaires et la présence de monuments de ces souverains à Bubastis est attestée. Ces colonnes atteignaient la hauteur déjà respectable pour un sanctuaire de cette importance d'une dizaine de mètres et devaient conférer à ces cours cérémonielles un aspect harmonieux et majestueux.\nRécemment dans ce que l'on considère comme la première cour, une statue colossale y a été dégagée, fracassée en plusieurs morceaux, au milieu d'autres morceaux des colonnes palmiformes découverts aussi à l'occasion et qu'elle a dû briser dans sa chute. Cette statue mesurant près de dix mètres de hauteur pourrait être attribuée à Isis-Néféret deuxième épouse de Ramsès II, ou encore Meritamon sa fille qu'il épousa également. Cette découverte démontre l'importance du site au Nouvel Empire.\nC'est dans ce qui devrait être la seconde cour que se trouvait le grand hall d'Osorkon II. Sur place se trouvent encore des restes de ces fameux chapiteaux, œuvres que l'on date du Moyen Empire et qui furent réutilisés par Osorkon pour son monument jubilaire.\n\nImposants monolithes sculptés sur leurs faces occidentales et orientales du visage de la déesse encadré par une lourde perruque dont les nattes s'enroulent à la base, ils supportaient chacun une corniche surmontée d'une frise d'uræus tandis que sur chaque côté du visage deux uræus portant la couronne rouge de Basse-Égypte se dressent fièrement. Plusieurs exemplaires en bon état ont rejoint les principales collections égyptologiques du monde (Le Caire, British Museum, Le Louvre, le Musée des Beaux-Arts de Boston, etc.)\nCes chapiteaux dont on possède au moins huit exemplaires dispersés entre Bubastis et ces collections supportaient donc le plafond du grand hall qu'Osorkon II édifia en l'honneur de sa fête Heb Sed, et qu'il est tentant de comparer au grand pronaos du temple d'Hathor à Dendérah, même si presque neuf siècles séparent les deux monuments. À l'instar des chapiteaux, les reliefs de cette salle sont en partie conservés dans les collections égyptologiques (notamment au Louvre et au British Museum) et sont d'une grande qualité.\nCependant, en visitant le site il est toujours possible de trouver des blocs encore sur place qui montrent ces longues théories de prêtres et d'enseignes divines qui s'avancent vers le dais royal sous lequel le roi habillé dans le costume si singulier de la fête-Sed reçoit l'hommage de tout le pays en l'honneur de son jubilé, censé sanctionner les trente premières années de son règne (la date la plus tardive connue pour Osorkon II est pourtant l'an 22...).\n\nÀ la suite de cet avant-temple se trouvent les ruines de la grande salle hypostyle.\nCelle-ci pourrait dater dans son dernier état de la XIXe dynastie, comme le suggèrent des architraves aux noms de Ramsès II bien qu'il soit prouvé que la plupart de ses éléments notamment ses colonnes remontent au Moyen Empire et pourraient alors provenir du temple que les souverains de cette période faste pour le pays ne manquèrent pas d'édifier à Bubastis.\nElle est réduite à des blocs épars redressés et alignés aux emplacements d'origines des colonnes monolithiques de granit. De style papyriforme fermé, elles gisent fracassées sur le sol de la salle, en morceaux encore imposants. Le diamètre des futs dépasse un mètre cinquante tandis que les chapiteaux, eux, dépassaient les trois mètres de hauteur. Chaque colonne devait donc porter les architraves au nom du grand pharaon à près de quinze mètres de hauteur et la salle devait en comporter plus d'une trentaine au vu des vestiges encore sur place (un tiers d'une des colonnes de cette salle, chapiteau compris, est conservé au Musée des Beaux-Arts de Boston).\nTout autour des ruines et débris divers portent encore les tableaux illustrés qui devaient orner les murs de la salle ainsi que les plafonds. On y a également découvert de nombreux vestiges de statues et colosses brisés souvent au nom de Ramsès II dont une dyade le représentant au côté d'une déesse lionne qui pourrait être Bastet ou encore Sekhmet.\nSuivait alors une autre salle hypostyle qui donnait accès à la zone du sanctuaire (arasé aujourd'hui) qui date dans son dernier état de Nectanébo II de la XXXe dynastie.\nHérodote nous décrit ce sanctuaire comme un vaste espace à ciel ouvert comprenant sept naoï, le tout étant enfermé d'un haut mur et environné de bosquets d'arbres sacrés.\nLe temple était entouré d'une enceinte en grès datant de l'époque d'Osorkon II, sur un plan comparable au temple d'Horus à Edfou, formant un long couloir ceinturant les différentes parties du temple.\nÀ proximité, au nord du temple de Bastet se trouvait un autre temple dans lequel on a vu le temple de Mahès, autre divinité féline, qu'Hérodote a vu, mais dont la description cadre mal avec les vestiges retrouvés. En effet, édifié dans l'enceinte principale et au vu de son emplacement perpendiculaire au temple de la déesse, cet édifice devait plutôt être comme un mammisi et faisait donc partie intégrante du temple de Bastet, tandis que le monument cité par l'historien grec se trouvait selon lui à l'est de celui de la déesse (à savoir que le temple de Basta est plutôt orienté N-O, S-E)...\nCette description du temple faite par Hérodote correspondrait alors davantage au temple d'Atoum dégagé au sud-est du temple de Bastet.\n\nLa ville contenait d'autres sanctuaires et monuments :\n\nun temple du Ka de Pépi Ier de la VIe dynastie ;\nun temple du Ka de Téti de la VIe dynastie ;\nun quartier palatial du Moyen Empire ;\nun temple d'Atoum, découvert un peu plus au sud-ouest du tell, qui pourrait être le temple secondaire qu'a vu Hérodote.\n\nFouilles archéologiques et principales découvertes\n1887-1889 : identification du tell et fouilles d'envergure menées par Henri Édouard Naville de l'Egypt Exploration Fund ;\n1906 : découverte accidentelle de deux caches contenant des objets et bijoux en or ; la première découverte a été répartie entre le Musée égyptien de Berlin et le Metropolitan Museum of Art de New York. La deuxième découverte, contenant notamment de la vaisselle cultuelle, des pièces d'orfèvreries ainsi que deux bracelets aux noms de Ramsès II se trouve exposée depuis au Musée égyptien du Caire ;\n1957 : découverte au nord du tell, par Labib Habachi, d'un vaste complexe de briques crues du Moyen Empire ;\n1962-1964 : fouilles et identification de la découverte de L. Habachi comme étant un palais d'Amenemhat III ;\n1980-1981 : deuxième campagne de fouilles du palais du Moyen Empire ;\n1984-1985 : fouilles des mastabas de l'Ancien Empire et de la nécropole princière du Moyen Empire ;\n1985-1986 : découverte et fouille d'un palais de la VIe dynastie, non loin du temple du Ka de Pépi Ier ;\n1992 : découverte lors du nettoyage de la colonnade de Ramsès II d'une nouvelle cache : deux bols contenaient des statuettes en or et en faïence ;\n1996 : découverte des vestiges d'une porte de l'Ancien Empire à proximité du temple de Bastet ;\n1997 : découverte de la statue dite de « la Nourrice » représentant une dame parée de ses atours portant plusieurs enfants dans ses bras. La pièce exceptionnelle est datée du Nouvel Empire et est exposée depuis au Musée du Caire ;\n1997 : découverte d'un puits qui aurait, selon la tradition biblique, été béni par Jésus lors de son passage en Égypte[réf. à confirmer].\n2002-2003 : découverte d'une statue colossale d'époque ramesside représentant une grande épouse royale ;\n2004 : découverte d'une stèle trilingue déjà connue sous le nom de Décret de Canope datant du règne de Ptolémée III dont le contenu porte notamment sur la réforme du calendrier égyptien. Il s'agit d'une des stèles officielles de l'époque ptolémaïque du type pierre de Rosette, faisant suite au synode des grands prêtres du pays en présence de Pharaon. Les décisions qui étaient prises sous son autorité étaient fidèlement reportées sur de grandes stèles et étaient placées dans les principaux sanctuaires du pays.\n\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\nOuvrages cités dans le texte\nAgnès Cabrol, Amenhotep III le Magnifique, vol.
