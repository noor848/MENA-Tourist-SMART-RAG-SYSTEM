Located on the Mediterranean Sea, it lies 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Alexandria and 300 kilometres (186 mi) northwest of Cairo. The town is located on the site of the ancient city Antiphrai (Greek: Ἀντίφραι). The city is divided into three main areas: El Alamein, Sidi Abdel Rahman, and Tel El Eis village.\nThe city's economy is mainly based on its natural resources of petroleum, which is explored by several Egyptian companies, and the tourist areas where a number of luxury hotels and tourist resorts are located, such as the tourist town of Marina.\n\nTourism\nMilitary cemeteries\nGermany\nThere are Italian and German military cemeteries on Tel el-Eisa Hill outside the town. The German cemetery is an ossuary, built in the style of a medieval fortress.\n\nItaly\nThe cemetery of the Italian War Memorial at El Alamein contains 5,200 graves.\n\nGreek\nThere is a Greek cemetery at El Alamein.\n\nCommonwealth of Nations\nThe Commonwealth Alamein Memorial and attached war cemetery, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, has  graves of soldiers from various countries who fought on the Allied side.

However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.\n\nWorld War II\nTwo important World War II battles were fought in the area:\n\nAt the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942), the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the Italian and German forces that were trying to outflank the Allies' position.\nAt the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 4 November 1942), Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: \"Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" After the war, he wrote: \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEl Alamein Fountain (war memorial commemorating the battle, in Sydney, Australia)\nEl Alamein International Airport\nEnham Alamein (village in Hampshire in England, renamed after the battle)\nMarina El Alamein (tourist resort)\nNew Alamein\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to El Alamein at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al 'Alamayn, Egypt\".

      "content": "## Overview\nEl Alamein (العلمين) is a city on the north coast of Egypt, famous as the site of major battles between British and German forces during the Second World War (see World War II in Africa).\nThis article also includes the adjacent areas of New Alamein, Marina el Alamein and Leukaspis. Marina-el-Alamein is a sea resort from the 1980s just north of El Alamein, and next to it is the archeological site Leukaspis (also known as Antiphrae).\nWinston Churchill once described El Alamein as having the best climate in the world and during the late 2010s the Egyptian government decided to make good use of El Alamein's touristic potential with the mega-project New Alamein. Resorts, skyscrapers and new residential areas are being built along the coast as part of that city since 2018.\n\n## Understand\nEl-Alamein is famous for the two Second World War battles fought here in 1942. The first battle took place on 27 July, when the German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika commanded by Erwin Rommel coming from Tobruk, Libya, managed to break through the lines of the British Commonwealth troops and advance to Height 26 west of El-Alamein.\nA few months later they tried to advance further, leading to the second battle that was fought between 23 October and 4 November. There the Axis tank army was beaten by the British 8th army commanded by Bernard Montgomery. In total, around 80,000 soldiers were wounded or killed in the two battles.\nFrom 1943 to 1947, German and Italian POWs, under the command of the British, collected the fallen from the battlefields and buried them in cemeteries in town. The temporary graves for the Axis soldiers were on Height 33. In 1955, works commenced on the German and Italian memorials, and they were finished in 1959. Today El Alamein is a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, known for its oil fields and for war tourism.\n\n## Marina el Alamein\nMarina el-Alamein, (مارينا العلمين, Mārīnā al-ʿAlamain), also known as Porto Marina or just Marina, is a yacht port just northeast of El Alamein. It's mostly a holiday resort for the domestic elite, designed by the Egyptian Amer group and built in the mid-1980s by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. There are hotels, restaurants, apartment buildings and the marina making up this district is placed around a lagoon, 4-6 m deep, connected to the Mediterranean.\n\n## Leukaspis\nEast of Marina El-Alamein is the Greek-Roman archaeological site of 30.82388829.0112569 Leukaspis, also known as Antiphrai. There's an entrance fee of 20 EGP for foreigners (10 EGP for foreign students).\nThe remains of a former port city stretches along the coast for about 1,600 m (one mile), though it's not right at the coast but about 600 m inland. Leukaspis is composed of a settlement part with a main square (agora) and remains of dwelling houses, a basilica from the 4th century, and a cemetery with mausoleums and tombs with superstructures.\n\n## New Alamein\nNew Alamein City (العلمين الجديدة al-ʿAlamain al-Ǧadīda) is a new city in construction since 2018, when President Abd al-Fattah as-Sisi laid the first stone. This megaproject is about developing a center for tourism, education and administration. Most of the city is between the Commonwealth and German military cemeteries, and the northern part if immediately west of Marina el-Alamein.\nThere are high apartment buildings along the coast, behind them a lagoon with canals. There are plans for a presidential palace, a building for ministries, three universities, 15 skyscrapers, and 30,000 hotel rooms, about a third of which have been built.
