      "content": "Sharm El Sheikh, alternatively rendered Sharm el-Sheikh or Charm el Sheikh, is an Egyptian city located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in South Sinai Governorate, on the coastal strip along the Red Sea in Asia. Its population is approximately 77,000 as of 2017. Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, St. Catherine and Mount Sinai. \nThe city was historically a fishing town and military base, and was developed into a commercial and tourist-centric city afterwards. The Egyptian government continued and expanded the development, promoting Sharm El Sheikh as a major international resort city. Today, Sharm El Sheikh and its holiday resorts is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences, diplomatic meetings and also concerts and clubbing.\nDowntown Sharm El Sheikh has the major concentrations of international banks in the city and is home to several large national companies. The city is home to major hospitals and health facilities, including Sharm International Hospital, the city's largest hospital and others engaged in health-related care and research. Sharm El Sheikh port is the city's seaport, which lies on the coast of the Red Sea,   and the nearest airport is the city's Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. The Sharm El Sheikh metropolitan area is one of the most visited cities in Egypt, attracting over 10 million visitors in 2024.\n\nName\nThe English name of Sharm El Sheikh is a borrowing of the Egyptian Arabic شرم الشيخ, šarm aš-šayḵ and, as such, does not have a fixed romanisation. There are documented uses of alternate spellings such as Sharm el Sheikh and Sharm el-Sheikh, sometimes within the same news article.\nSharm El Sheikh is sometimes referred to as the \"City of Peace\" (مدينة السلام, madinet es-salām), referring to the large number of international peace conferences that have been held there.\nAmongst Egyptians and also many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to \"Sharm\" (Egyptian Arabic: [ʃɑɾm]), which is its common name in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nGeography and history\nSharm El Sheikh is on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until 1967 when it was ordered to leave by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fact that precipitated the Six-Day War during which it was reoccupied by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control from 1967 until the Sinai Peninsula was returned back to Egypt in 1982, after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 that was signed in Washington, D.C. During that time, an Israeli settlement named Ofira was built in the area.\nIn 1968, Israel opened an air force military base there, where Egypt later built the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport on the same location that included an enormous $420m investment by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, a major project that helped put the city on global map.  Unlike Sinai's other well-known settlement, Yamit, Ofira was not demolished after Israel ceded control of Sinai to Egypt following the Camp David Accords, but was returned intact and is today a thriving tourist town and home to local Egyptian residents.\nEgypt's former president Hosni Mubarak designated Sharm El Sheikh as The City of Peace in 1982 and the Egyptian government began a policy of encouraging massive development of the city. Egyptian businessmen and investors, along with global investors contributed to building several mega projects, including mosques and churches. The city is now an international tourist destination, and environmental zoning laws limit the height of buildings to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings. In 2022, Sharm El-Sheikh along with another Egyptian city, Hurghada, were both chosen by Trip advisor as the world's top 25 tourist destinations.\nA hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the Gulf of Aqaba, whereby the area's components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: Taba, Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, Naama Bay, Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.\nSharm El Sheikh city, with Naama Bay, Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and Shark's Bay form a metropolitan area.\nThe site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.\nIn 2005, the resort was hit by the Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks, which were carried out by an extremist Islamist organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history.\n\nThe city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to establish Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. A second summit was held at Sharm on 17 October 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but it failed to end the violence. A summit was held in the city on 3 August 2005 on developments in the Arab world, such as the situation in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Again in 2007, an important ministerial meeting took place in Sharm, where dignitaries discussed Iraqi reconstruction.\n\nThe World Economic Forum on the Middle East was hosted by Sharm El Sheikh in 2006 and 2008. Amidst the 2011 Egyptian protests, then-president Mubarak reportedly went to Sharm El Sheikh and resigned there on 11 February 2011. The 2014 World Economic Forum in Sharm El Sheikh heralded a new initiative for desert cities urban development in Egypt.  In November 2022, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) was held in Sharm El Sheikh. This conference led to the first loss and damage fund being created.\nOn Monday, October 13, 2025, the city hosted an international summit titled \"Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit\" co-chaired by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Donald Trump, with the participation of world leaders from more than 20 countries aiming to end the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nClimate\nThe city experiences a subtropical arid climate, classified by the Köppen–Geiger system as hot desert (BWh). Temperatures are just short of a tropical climate. Typical temperatures range from 18 to 23 °C (64 to 73 °F) in January and 33 to 37 °C (91 to 99 °F) in August. The temperature of the Red Sea in this region ranges from 21 to 28 °C (70 to 82 °F) over the course of the year.\nMarsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm El Sheikh have the warmest winter night temperatures of cities and resorts in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 3 June 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was 5 °C (41 °F) on 23 February 2000.\n\nEconomy and tourism\nSharm El Sheikh's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism, owing to its landscape, year-round dry climate with long hot summers and warm winters and its long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various water sports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkelling. There is scope for scientific tourism due to the diversity of marine life: 250 different coral reefs and 1000 species of fishes.\nThese natural resources, together with its proximity to tourist markets in Europe, have stimulated rapid growth in tourism in the region. The number of resorts has increased from three in 1982 to ninety-one in 2000. Guest nights also increased in that period from sixteen thousand to 5.1 million. International hotel companies that currently operate in the city include Accor (Mövenpick, Novotel, Rixos), Deutsche Hospitality (Steigenberger), Four Seasons, Hilton (DoubleTree), Marriott (Renaissance, Sheraton), and Rotana, with categories of three to five stars. In 2007, the first aqua park hotel resort opened in the area. The four-star Aqua Blu Sharm Resort was built on the Ras Om El Seid, with an area of 133,905 square metres (1,441,340 sq ft).\nSharm is also home to a congress center, located along Peace Road, where international political and economic meetings have been held, including peace conferences, ministerial meetings, world bank meetings, and Arab League meetings. The Maritim Sharm El Sheikh International Congress Centre can host events and congresses for up to 4,700 participants.\nThere is nightlife in Sharm El Sheikh. The colourful handicraft stands of the local Bedouin culture are a popular attraction. Ras Muhammad National Park, at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, has been designated a national park, protecting the area's wildlife, natural landscape, shoreline and coral reef. There are a number of international hotels and restaurants in the centre of Sharm, in the area known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.\nThe Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area is a 600-square-kilometre (230 sq mi) area of mangroves, coral reefs, fertile dunes, birds and wildlife.\nAs of 2012, nationals from the EU and the US do not require a visa for travel to Sharm El Sheikh if the visit is for fourteen days or less, although those travelling outside the Sinai area may still require a visa, which is purchasable for a small fee on arrival. Visitors are often ushered into a queue to buy a visa after entering the airport upon landing.\n\nFlight incidents\nOn 23 August 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it. the missile missed the airliner by about 1,000 feet (300 meters), and the plane landed safely. A UK investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise, although the Egyptian government said the flight was never at risk.\nOn 31 October 2015, while flying from Sharm El Sheikh to Saint Petersburg, Metrojet Flight 9268 was destroyed by a bomb above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 people on board, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for this incident. This caused the repatriation of British and Russian tourists from 5 November 2015. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh be suspended. These suspensions were gradually lifted as the security situation improved, with the UK government ending its ban on direct flights on 22 October 2019. The process of lifting flight suspensions was completed on 9 August 2021, when the first direct flight from Russia since November 2015 (operated by Rossiya Airlines) landed at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport.\n\nTransport\nLampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power. Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.\nSharm's marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.\nThe city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.\nSharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.\n\nWater sports\nSharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkelling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing and stand up paddleboarding.\nRas Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over 800 metres (2,600 ft), and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.\nThe Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.\nThe Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.\n\nShark attacks\nOn 1 December 2010, four tourists − three Russians and a Ukrainian − were attacked and injured by an oceanic whitetip shark or sharks in three separate incidents off Sharm El Sheikh. One victim lost a leg, and another an arm. The Egyptian authorities claimed that the shark responsible for the attacks had been captured alive, but the identification was disputed by the diving industry, based on eyewitness and photographic evidence. Four days later, on 5 December, an elderly German woman was attacked and killed by a shark while snorkeling at the resort.\n\nEducation\nSt. Joseph Schools\nL'école française de Sharm el Sheikh EFSSH (FRENCH SCHOOL)\nFayroz Experimental School\nGeel October School\nSharm College\nSharm British School\nKing Salman International University, Sharm El Sheikh campus\n\nTwin towns\nAqaba,  Jordan (since December 2015)\nSwakopmund,  Namibia (since June 2008)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nRed Sea Riviera\nSharm El Sheikh Memorandum\nSouth Sinai Hospital\nRas Sedr\nRas Muhammad National Park\nDahab\nTaba\nNuweiba\nFlash Airlines Flight 604\n\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Sharm el-Sheikh at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSharm El Sheikh - Egyptian Tourism Authority",

Elle fait partie du gouvernorat du Sinaï Sud.\nDepuis 1985, cette ville est une destination de villégiature très appréciée, en particulier des plongeurs sous-marins amateurs qui y trouvent une infrastructure accueillante et une mer dont la transparence est appréciée.\nLa localisation de la ville en fait une position stratégique au croisement de la mer Rouge et du golfe d'Aqaba, âprement disputée pendant les conflits entre Israël et l’Égypte.\n\nGéographie\nSite\nCharm el-Cheikh est situé entre la mer Rouge et le golfe d'Aqaba d’une part et les montagnes du Sinaï d’autre part. Cette station balnéaire s’étendant sur une quinzaine de kilomètres, elle a la particularité de baigner la mer Rouge (du sud de la ville jusqu'à Naama Bay) et le golfe d'Aqaba (depuis Garden Bay vers l'est et le nord). Elle comporte plusieurs sites :\n\nSur la mer Rouge\n\nSharm el-Maya : au sud, également qualifié de « Old Sharm » (vieux Charm). Comporte une plage publique ainsi que plusieurs restaurants, dont quelques petits situés dans le « Old Market » (vieux marché). Un port, surveillé par la Force multinationale et observateurs au Sinaï (FMO), est aussi situé dans ce quartier.\nHadaba : au nord de Sharm el-Maya. C’est le quartier résidentiel de la ville. Quelques criques, des hôtels de luxe et des maisons bourgeoises. Un phare domine la pointe de Ras Umm Sid.\nNaama Bay : quartier touristique de la ville. Présence de restaurants, de bars, d’hôtels et de boutiques. Le quartier est presque entièrement réservé aux piétons.\nSur le golfe d'Aqaba\n\nShark's Bay : au cours de l’urbanisation rapide de la ville, cet endroit était le dernier à être occupé par les bédouins.\nL'aéroport.\n\nTourisme\nClimat\nSitué entre le désert du Sinaï et la mer Rouge, Charm el-Cheikh bénéficie d'un climat désertique chaud (classification de Köppen BWh), c'est-à-dire un climat très chaud et très sec. Les températures maximales en été peuvent atteindre parfois 40 °C. Les hivers sont très doux, la présence de la mer accentuant la douceur en hiver. La température moyenne annuelle est de 23 °C. Les précipitations sont très faibles. Le ciel est souvent limpide et dégagé, et le soleil brille jusqu’à 3 800 h par an.\n\nHistoire\nVillage de pêcheurs à l’origine, Charm el-Cheikh devient une base stratégique pour la marine égyptienne.\nEntre 1956 et 1957 a lieu la guerre de Suez entre Israël et l’Égypte. Les Israéliens occupent puis évacuent le Sinaï. Une force de paix internationale stationne à Charm el-Cheikh de 1957 à 1967. Mais en juin 1967, Nasser occupe la commune, bloque le détroit de Tiran, et coupe ainsi l’accès de la mer Rouge aux bateaux de la flotte maritime israélienne, ce qui entraîne l’intervention d’Israël : c’est la guerre des Six Jours. À la suite de la défaite égyptienne, Israël occupe le Sinaï. La ville est alors rebaptisée. En 1968, Les Israéliens construisent une colonie appelée Ophira à Ras Umm Sid pour y installer cinq-cents familles, et font de Naama Bay un centre touristique.\nL’aéroport est ouvert en 1976.\nEn 1978, les récifs de Naama Bay sont détruits par une inondation.\nEn 1982, la commune est restituée aux Égyptiens, qui encouragent le développement de la ville. Une base de la Force multinationale et observateurs au Sinaï est créée à la même date.\nLe 4 septembre 1999 a lieu la signature du Mémorandum de Charm el-Cheikh entre Israël et l’Autorité palestinienne en présence de Madeleine Albright, du président Hosni Moubarak et du roi de Jordanie Abdallah II.\nLe 3 janvier 2004 a lieu l’accident d'avion du vol Flash Airlines 604 de la compagnie Flash Airlines, qui fait cent-quarante-huit morts en s’abîmant dans la mer Rouge peu après son décollage.\n\nLa ville est victime d’attentats le 23 juillet 2005. Le Old Market à Sharm el-Maya, les hôtels Ghazala gardens et Moevenpick à Naama Bay sont touchés.\nLe 5 décembre 2010, à Charm el-Cheikh, une touriste allemande a été tuée par un requin longimane (peut-être un requin mako) alors qu'elle nageait dans la Mer Rouge devant son hôtel. Deux attaques contre des baigneurs russes et ukrainiens la semaine précédente lui sont également attribué.\nChassé du pouvoir par la révolution égyptienne de 2011, Hosni Moubarak se réfugie à Charm-el-Cheikh entre sa démission de la présidence le 11 février et son arrestation en avril.\nLe 31 octobre 2015, l'Airbus A321 qui avait décollé de Charm el-Cheikh pour assurer le vol n°9268 de la compagnie russe Metrojet à destination de Saint-Pétersbourg, s'écrase dans le Sinaï avec ses deux-cent-vingt-quatre passagers et membres d'équipage. Il n'y a aucun survivant.\nDu 6 au 18 novembre 2022, la ville accueille la COP27.\n\nÉconomie\nCharm el-Cheikh est un ancien port, mais des lois environnementales strictes apparues dans les années 1990 ont réduit la navigation commerciale. Jusqu’en 1982, il n’y avait qu’un port militaire situé à Marsa Bareka. Le port civil se développa à la fin des années 1980, lorsque Sharm el-Maya devint le principal port civil.\nLa principale activité économique de la ville est le tourisme, grâce à ses plages, et à un climat sec et agréable. La mer y est aussi claire que calme. De plus, l’endroit est favorable à la pratique de la plongée sous-marine. Enfin, à quelques kilomètres au sud de la ville se situe le parc national de Ras Mohammed. Le tourisme se remarque par la présence d’hôtels de luxe et de semi-luxe, notamment à Naama Bay.\n\nTransports\nIl est possible de se déplacer dans Charm el-Cheikh ou de se rendre depuis cette ville vers d’autres destinations grâce à plusieurs moyens de transport :\n\nen voiture : les routes du Sinaï sont goudronnées.\nen avion : via EgyptAir ou des compagnies Charter, depuis l’aéroport international de Charm el-Cheikh\nen bus : liaison depuis la gare routière située à Peace Road.
