      "content": "Deir el-Bahari or Dayr al-Bahri (Arabic: الدير البحري, romanized: al-Dayr al-Baḥrī, lit. 'the Northern [lit., \"Seaward\"] Monastery', Coptic: ⲡⲧⲟⲡⲟⲥ ⲛⲁⲡⲁ ⲫⲟⲓⲃⲁⲙⲙⲱⲛ, lit. 'the monastery of Apa Phoibammon', Ancient Egyptian: djeser-djeseru) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs located on the west bank of the Nile, opposite the city of Luxor, Egypt. This is a part of the Theban Necropolis.\n\nHistory\nDeir el-Bahari, located on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes (modern Luxor) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs that has served as a major religious center for over two millennia. Its history begins with the 11th Dynasty when Pharaoh Mentuhotep II (c.2061-2010 BCE) constructed his funerary temple here to commemorate the reunification of Egypt after the First Intermediate Period. Mentuhotep's terraced complex, integrating a royal tomb into a temple platform, pioneered the cliffside temple style later emulated by New Kingdom rulers. Centuries later, the 18th Dynasty queen Hatshepsut erected her famous temple Djeser-Djeseru, designed by her architect Senenmut, directly beside Mentuhotep's complex. Richly decorated reliefs in Hatshepsut's temple celebrated her divine birth, commercial expedition to Punt, and association with Amun-Ra, cementing the temple's significance in state religion and royal propaganda. Later, Thutmose III added a smaller temple, Djeser-Akhet, just above hers. By the Third Intermediate Period, Deir el-Bahari became a burial ground for priests and a hiding place for royal mummies such as those discovered in the DB320 cache in 1881.\n\nArchaeological exploration in Deir el-Bahari began ramping up in the late 19th century. Édouard Naville's excavations from 1893 to 1906, sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Fund, revealed both Hatshepsut's temple and Mentuhotep II's complex. This was followed by Herbert Winlock's Metropolitan Museum of Art expeditions (1911-1931), which unearthed significant finds, including statues of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and caches of ritual objects. The Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology began extensive restoration work in the 1960s, stabilizing Hatshepsut's temple and recovering Thutmose III's largely destroyed shrine. Meanwhile, the sites significance as a necropolis continued into the Ptolemaic Period, when parts off Hatshepsut's temple were reused for cults of Imhotep and Amenhotep, Son of Hapu. Deir el-Bahari's rich history reflects its role as a sacred landscape where kings and priests were memorialized, divine legitimacy was protected, and Theban religious traditions flourished across changing dynasties.\n\nAssociated deities\nThe purpose and significance of the structures and burials at Deir el-Bahari is closely related with the deities associated with Deir el-Bahari and the greater Theban Necropolis.\nHathor was a prominent goddess at Deir el-Bahari, venerated as a divine mother, protector, and patroness of the necropolis. The cliffs at Deir el-Bahari were sacred to Hathor before pharaonic construction, with Mentuhotep II likely honoring her cult when building there. His temple complex included shrines for royal women, priestesses of Hathor, underscoring the goddess’s significance. Hathor, regarded as “Lady of the West,” was often depicted as a cow emerging from the cliffs to welcome and nourish souls. Hatshepsut’s temple featured a chapel of Hathor with Hathor-headed columns and reliefs of offerings, highlighting Hathor’s enduring role in funerary rites and royal worship from the Middle to New Kingdom.\nAnubis, the jackal-headed god of mummification, was revered as a guardian of tombs and guide of souls. Known as “He Who is Upon His Mountain” and “Foremost of the Westerners,” Though later eclipsed by Osiris in theology, Anubis remained essential as the patron of embalmers, and continued to be invoked as the guardian of tomb doors and the guide who conducts the \"weighing of the heart\" judgement for souls. At Deir el-Bahari, Hatshepsut’s temple featured a dedicated Anubis chapel on the north side of the middle terrace. Well-preserved reliefs show Anubis receiving offerings, reflecting his role in embalming rites and transition to the afterlife, with archaeological evidence confirming his importance across the Theban Necropolis.\nOsiris, god of death and resurrection, became increasingly central to Theban funerary religion. Osiris is depicted as a mummified king wearing the Atef-crown and his mythology as the murdered and resurrected ruler made him the divine guarantor of rebirth for the deceased. The worship of Osiris at Deir el-Bahari can be traced to the Middle Kingdom when King Mentuhotep II incorporated Osirian symbolism into his mortuary cult. Osiris' cult was fully integrated into royal mortuary temples at Hatshepsut's Djeser-Djeseru, over twenty-five life size Osiride statues of the queen in Osiris form stood against the pillars of the upper terrace.\n\nMeretseger, a cobra goddess local to the Theban Necropolis, personified the sacred peak overlooking the royal tombs and was called “She Who Loves Silence.” She guarded the necropolis, especially the Valley of the Kings, envisioned as a cobra atop the mountain watching for tomb robbers. Her cult is evidenced by votive stelae and artisans' graffiti, portraying her as both a punisher of wrongdoers and a merciful healer who forgave the penitent.\nAmun (\"The Hidden One\") was the supreme god of Thebes, originally a local air deity who rose to national prominence as \"Amun-Ra\". He is typically depicted as a man with a double plumed crown, sometimes fused with the sun god Ra, reflecting his role as a creator and solar deity. Amun's worship at Deir el-Bahari began in the Middle Kingdom: the mortuary complex of Mentuhotep II was likely among the first west Theban temples designed to receive the barque of Amun during festivals. In the New Kingdom, Hatshepsut built the central sanctuary of her terraced temple for Amun-Ra, placing his cult chapel at the heart of Djeser-Djeseru. Inscriptions and reliefs from the site honor Amun's oracles and his role in legitimizing Hatshepsut's kingship, underscoring Amun's status as king of the gods and patron of pharaohs at the Theban Necropolis.\n\nMortuary temple of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep\nMentuhotep II, the Eleventh Dynasty king who reunited Egypt at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, built a very unusual funerary complex. His mortuary temple was built on several levels in the great bay at Deir el-Bahari. It was approached by a 16-meter-wide (52-foot) causeway leading from a valley temple which no longer exists.\nThe mortuary temple itself consists of a forecourt and entrance gate, enclosed by walls on three sides, and a terrace on which stands a large square structure that may represent the primeval mound that arose from the waters of chaos. As the temple faces east, the structure is likely to be connected with the sun cult of Ra and the resurrection of the king.\nFrom the eastern part of the forecourt, an opening called the Bab el-Hosan ('Gate of the Horseman') leads to an underground passage and an unfinished tomb or cenotaph containing a seated statue of the king. On the western side, tamarisk and sycamore trees were planted beside the ramp leading up to the terrace. At the back of the forecourt and terrace are colonnades decorated in relief with boat processions, hunts, and scenes showing the king's military achievements.\nStatues of the Twelfth Dynasty king Senusret III were found here too.\nThe inner part of the temple was actually cut into the cliff and consists of a peristyle court, a hypostyle hall and an underground passage leading into the tomb itself. The cult of the dead king centred on the small shrine cut into the rear of the Hypostyle Hall.\nThe mastaba-like structure on the terrace is surrounded by a pillared ambulatory along the west wall, where the statue shrines and tombs of several royal wives and daughters were found. These royal princesses were the priestesses of Hathor, one of the main ancient Egyptian funerary deities. Although little remained of the king's own burial, six sarcophagi were retrieved from the tombs of the royal ladies (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kawit, Kemsit, Muyet and Sadhe). Each was formed of six slabs, held together at the corners by metal braces and carved in sunken relief. The sarcophagus of Queen Kawit, now in the Cairo Museum, is particularly fine.\nThe burial shaft and subsequent tunnel descend for 150 meters and end in a burial chamber 45 meters below the court. The chamber held a shrine, which once held the wooden coffin of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep. A great tree-lined court was reached by means of the processional causeway, leading up from the valley temple. Beneath the court, a deep shaft was cut which led to unfinished rooms believed to have been intended originally as the king's tomb. A wrapped image of the pharaoh was discovered in this area by Howard Carter. The temple complex also held six mortuary chapels and shaft tombs built for the pharaoh's wives and daughters.\nArchaeological finds\nOne of the most significant finds at the site is a collection of statues of King Mentuhotep II in various forms. In the court of the temple a sandstone head of Mentuhotep II was found buried and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several seated statues of Mentuhotep II were also found buried possibly indicating a ritual of buried objects  Some of the recovered statues show the king wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, emphasizing his role as a unifier in the First Intermediate Period. At each corner of the temple, foundation deposits were discovered consisting of small tablets made of wood, alabaster and bronze. The deposits contained pottery fragments, animal bones (likely from ritual sacrifices), and tools used in temple construction. These deposits suggest ritual offerings at the start of construction likely intended to sanctify the temple space. \nExcavations revealed tree holes that indicated that sycamore fig trees were planted in the temple's forecourt. Some tree holes contained buried statues which is believed to link the practice of tree planting with ritual protection or regeneration beliefs. Flower beds and irrigation features were also found, indicating that the temple complex included gardens as part of its landscape. \nSome walls of the temple showed evidence of Ptolemaic or later modifications, indicating that parts of the temple were reused in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were traces of later burials including a cemetery with poor burials stretching into the temple complex. The temple was likely partially dismantled and repurposed during the New Kingdom, possibly during the nearby construction of Hatshepsut's temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Hatshepsut\nThe focal point of the Deir el-Bahari complex is the Djeser-Djeseru meaning \"the Holy of Holies\", the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. It is a colonnaded structure, which was designed and implemented by Senenmut, royal steward and architect of Hatshepsut, to serve for her posthumous worship and to honor the glory of Amun.\nDjeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of colonnaded terraces, reached by long ramps that once were graced with gardens. It is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it, and is largely considered to be one of the \"incomparable monuments of ancient Egypt\". It is 97 feet (30 m) tall.\nThe unusual form of Hatshepsut's temple is explained by the choice of location, in the valley basin of Deir el-Bahari, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was here, in about 2050 BC, that Mentuhotep II, the founder of the Middle Kingdom, laid out his sloping, terrace-shaped mortuary temple. The pillared galleries at either side of the central ramp of the Djeser Djeseru correspond to the pillar positions on two successive levels of the Temple of Mentuhotep.\nDuring the shift into the Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE) and Roman (30 BCE-4th Century CE) periods, the temple became a center for the cult of Amenhotep, son of Hapu and Imhotep. During these periods, the temple became a major cult site for these deified figures, known for their wisdom, healing and oracular powers. Greek inscriptions discovered in the temple provide insight into religious activities, economic functions, and visitors who frequented the site during these later periods. \nToday the terraces of Deir el-Bahari only convey a faint impression of the original intentions of Senenmut. Most of the statue ornaments are missing – the statues of Osiris in front of the pillars of the upper colonnade, the sphinx avenues in front of the court, and the standing, sitting, and kneeling figures of Hatshepsut; some of these were destroyed in a posthumous condemnation of this pharaoh while others were rededicated to Thutmose III. The architecture of the temple has been considerably altered as a result of misguided reconstruction in the early twentieth century AD.\n\nArchitecture\nWhile Hatshepsut used Mentuhotep's temple as a model, the two structures are significantly different. Hatshepsut employed a lengthy colonnaded terrace that deviated from the centralized massing of Mentuhotep's model – an anomaly that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber.\nThere are three layered terraces reaching 97 feet (30 m) in height. Each 'story' is articulated by a double colonnade of square piers, with the exception of the northwest corner of the central terrace, which employs Proto-Doric columns to house the chapel.\nThese terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens. The layering of Hatshepsut's temple corresponds with the classical Theban form, employing pylon, courts, hypostyle hall, sun court, chapel, and sanctuary.\nThe relief sculpture within Hatshepsut's temple recites the tale of the divine birth of the pharaoh. The text and pictorial cycle also tell of an expedition to the Land of Punt, an exotic country on the Red Sea coast.\nOn either side of the entrance to the sanctuary (shown right) are painted pillars with images of Hathor as the capitals. Just under the roof is an image of Wadjet, displayed as a bilateral solar symbol, flanked by two other long serpents.\nThe temple includes an image, shown to the right, of Hatshepsut depicted as male pharaoh giving offerings to Horus, and to their left, an animal skin wound around a tall staff that is a symbol of the god Osiris.\nWhile the statues and ornamentation have since been stolen or destroyed, the temple once was home to two statues of Osiris, a long avenue lined by sphinxes, as well as many sculptures of pharaoh Hatshepsut in different attitudes – standing, sitting, or kneeling.\n\nConservation efforts\nSince the early 20th century, continuous archaeological and conservation work has been undertaken to preserve the Temple of Hatshepsut. As part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Thebes the temple has been a focal point of archaeological and conservation efforts for over a century.\nThe conservation of the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari has been a continuous effort, addressing structural instability, environmental damage, and past restoration methods. Large-scale excavation and conservation work began in the 19th century with Auguste Mariette, followed by Édouard Naville, who conducted documentation and reconstruction efforts between 1891 and 1908. In the early 20th century, Herbert Winlock and the Metropolitan Museum of Art focused on stabilizing the temple’s walls and reinforcing weakened structures. Later, Émile Baraize of the French Antiquities Service carried out additional reconstructions using stone, concrete, and gypsum, though records of these interventions were limited.\nSince the 1960s, Polish archaeological missions have led major conservation projects, particularly on the festival courtyard, coronation portico, and royal cult complex. The Hatshepsut Chapel, located on the temple's upper terrace has been a primary focus due to its archaeological significance and vulnerability. In the 2000s, modern technologies such as 3D scanning and damage mapping were introduced to assess structural weaknesses, revealing cracks, missing sections, and displaced blocks from earlier restorations. Conservation teams reinforced walls, stabilized the foundations, and analyzed ancient mortars to develop improved preservation methods.\nA significant discovery in 2013 was a tomb beneath the Hatshepsut Chapel containing burials from the 23rd-25th Dynasties, which required additional stabilization measures. Structural reinforcements were implemented, including the installation of a protective manhole for controlled access. Conservationists have also focused on preserving stone surfaces and polychrome decorations affected by environmental exposure. Ongoing research continues to refine preservation strategies with long-term plans integrating climate impact assessments, stone conservation, and controlled reconstruction to maintain the structural and historical integrity of the temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Thutmose III\nThe Mortuary Temple of Thutmose III, also called Djeser-Akhet (Holy of the Horizon), was discovered in 1961; the mortuary temple of Thutmose III was built in at about 1435-1425 BC, late in Thutmose's reign. It overlooks other earlier structures present on the site, such as the temples of Hatshepsut and Mentuhotep Nebhepetre. Built on a steep, artificially leveled terrace, the temple features a basilica-style hypostyle hall with clerestory windows, a rare architectural innovation that foreshadowed the later hypostyle halls of the Ramesside Period. The temple complex was primarily dedicated to Amun-Ra, reflecting the King's close association with the Theban-state god. A key highlight is the Hathor shrine, discovered in 1906, which housed a statue of hathor as a cow protecting the king. The temple's reliefs, recovered in thousands of fragments, show Thutmose III in vibrant polychrome scenes performing rituals, offering to gods, and participating in the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.\nRediscovered in 1962 by a Polish-Egyptian mission, the site revealed column bases, a red granite doorway, and vast amounts of painted limestone and sandstone reliefs. Excavations also uncovered statues of Thutmose III, foundation deposits beneath the Hathor chapel containing botanical offerings, faience amulets, and pottery The temple was heavily damaged by an 11th century BCE earthquake and subsequent stone-robbing, leaving only foundations and scattered architectural elements. Despite its ruinous state, the temple's design closely mirrors Hatshepsut's nearby temple while innovating with its elevated basilica-style hall. Over time the site became a focus for the worship of Hathor during the Third Intermediate Period, as indicated by later votive offerings. Today the reconstructed reliefs and artifacts from Djeser-Akhet contribute significantly to the understanding of royal cult practices and 18th Dynasty temple architecture.\nThere are ongoing conservation efforts including a reconstruction of the temple's layout which have been made difficult by the severity of the destruction in some areas of the temple. Some progress, however, has been made on the reconstruction of the layout of the upper terrace.\n\nRoyal and non-royal tombs\nA tomb (TT320) in a hidden recess in the cliffs to the south of the temples contained a cache of forty royal mummies, moved there from the Valley of the Kings. The bodies had been placed there by Twenty-first Dynasty priests, most likely to prevent further desecration and looting. The tomb was probably originally built for priests of the 21st Dynasty, most likely the family of Pinedjem II. In the cache were found the mummies of Ahmose I, along with the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX. In a separate room were found Twenty-first dynasty High Priests and pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. The discovery of the mummies cache is depicted in the Egyptian movie The Night of Counting the Years (1969).\nIn 1891, a larger cache of 153 reburied mummies of the priests themselves also were found in a tomb at the site, known today as Bab el-Gasus 'Gate of the Priests' (also referred to as the \"Priestly Cache\" or \"Second Cache\").\nPrivate tombs dating from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic period are also situated here. There are two most notable private tombs at Deir el-Bahari. The first is that of Meketre (TT280), which contained many painted wooden funerary models from the Middle Kingdom and the first recorded human-headed canopic jar.\nThe second, the \"secret\" tomb of Senenmut – the architect and steward who oversaw the construction of the temple for Hatshepsut – was begun in the complex also. Senenmut's tomb was vandalized in antiquity, but some of the relief artwork is still intact. It was meant to be a very large tomb and its corridors are over 100 yards (91 m) long. However, it was never finished and Senenmut was not interred there. He has another tomb, not far from Deir el-Bahari, where his body may have been placed, but it, too, was vandalized and robbed.\nA large area of non-royal tombs in this vicinity is called Sheikh Abd el-Qurna.\n\nStone chest\nIn March 2020 archeologists from Warsaw University's Institute of Archaeology, led by Andrzej Niwiński, discovered a treasure chest and a wooden box dating back 3,500 years in the Egyptian site of Deir el-Bahari.\nThe stone chest contained several items, with all of them covered with linen canvas. Three bundles of flax were found during the excavation. A goose skeleton, sacrificed for religious purposes, was found inside one of them. The second one included goose eggs. It is believed that what the third bundle contained was an ibis egg, which had a symbolic meaning for the ancient Egyptians. In addition, a little wooden trinket box was discovered inside the bundle; the box is believed to contain the name Pharaoh Thutmose II.\nAccording to the Andrzej Niwiński, \"The chest itself is about 40 cm long, with a slight smaller height. It was perfectly camouflaged, looked like an ordinary stone block. Only after a closer look did it turn out to be a chest.\"\n\nContemporary issues and tourism\nToday, Deir el-Bahari is one of Egypt's most visited archaeological sites and part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing \"Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis\". Its restored terraces, particularly Hatshepsut's temple, attract thousands of tourists annually, drawn by the site's architectural beauty and historical significance. The Polish-Egyptian Conservation Project has been instrumental in transforming the once-ruined site into a partially reconstructed monument with accessible terraces, restored statues, and visitor pathways. However, parts of the site such as Mentuhotep II's temple remain off-limits due to their fragile condition. Modern infrastructure including interpretive signage and a visitor center, aims to balance public access with heritage preservation, while the site continues to be a focal point of scholarly research and conservation.\nDeir el-Bahari has also been a focal point for modern security concerns. On November 17, 1997, the site was the scene of the Luxor Massacre, when militants killed over 60 tourists at Hatshepsut's temple, causing a severe blow to Egypt's tourism industry. Since then, the Egyptian government has implemented extensive security measures including armed Tourist Police, metal detectors and surveillance systems. While tourism has recovered in the years since the attack, the event remains a stark reminder of the vulnerability of cultural heritage sites to political violence. Despite this, Deir el-Bahari continues to thrive as a key destination within the Luxor region's tourism economy, representing both a testament to Egypt's enduring legacy and a symbol of resilience in the face of modern threats.\n\nArt\nKaska, Dance of War is a painting by Shefa Salem that depicts Libyan soldiers performing a kaska dance of the Timihu people, which was first recorded 5000 years ago at Deir El-Bahari.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nThebes, Egypt\n\nSources\nMertz, Barbara (1964). \"Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs\".

      "content": "Le site de Deir el-Bahari est un complexe funéraire, composé de temples et de tombes, situé sur la rive gauche du Nil face à la ville de Louxor et des temples de Karnak, légèrement au sud de la vallée des Rois, adossé à la paroi rocheuse de la montagne de Thèbes, en Haute-Égypte.\nLe nom arabe de ce site (دير البحري;, dayr al-baḥrī, « le couvent du Nord ») rappelle l’existence du couvent copte élevé dans ce lieu.\nSur la rive gauche du Nil, en face de Karnak, la falaise de la chaîne Libyque dessine un vaste amphithéâtre qui marque le centre de la nécropole thébaine.\n\nPrincipales constructions\nLes principaux monuments sont les suivants :\n\nseconde moitié du XXIe siècle AEC : construction, par le roi Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie), d'un temple funéraire associée à la sépulture du roi ; les reconstitutions du temple diffèrent : Édouard Naville émit l'hypothèse d'un temple à double terrasse surmonté d'une petite pyramide, mais récemment les égyptologues Dieter Arnold et Rainer Stadelmann ont remplacé cette pyramide — dont on n'a retrouvé aucun indice matériel —, par un mastaba ou un tumulus,\ndébut du XXe siècle AEC : construction d'un complexe funéraire, resté inachevé, par le roi Montouhotep III, fils du précédent,\nmilieu du XVe siècle AEC : construction, par la reine Hatchepsout (XVIIIe dynastie), d'un temple funéraire, auquel le nom de Deir el-Bahari fait le plus souvent allusion,\nmilieu du XVe siècle AEC : construction, par le roi Thoutmôsis III, neveu et beau-fils de la précédente, d'un temple vôtif.\n\nTemple funéraire de Montouhotep II\nLe temple funéraire le plus ambitieux et innovant de Deir el-Bahari est celui de Montouhotep II, souverain de la XIe dynastie qui a réuni l’Égypte au Moyen Empire. Les nombreuses innovations architecturales du temple marquent une rupture avec la tradition des complexes pyramidaux de l'Ancien Empire et préfigurent les temples des millions d'années du Nouvel Empire.\nLe choix de cet emplacement est certainement lié à l'origine thébaine de la XIe dynastie : les prédécesseurs de Montouhotep sur le trône thébain sont tous enterrés dans des tombeaux à proximité. Il a peut-être également choisi Deir el-Bahari parce qu'il est en face du temple de Karnak, de l'autre côté du Nil. Ainsi, la statue d'Amon est apportée chaque année à Deir el-Bahari pendant la Belle fête de la vallée, ce que le roi peut avoir perçu comme bénéfique pour son culte funéraire.\nLe complexe funéraire comprend deux temples : le temple funéraire de Deir el-Bahari et le temple de la vallée situé plus près du Nil sur des terres cultivées et qui n'existe plus. Les deux temples sont reliés par une chaussée découverte de 1,2 km de long et 46 m de large.\nLe temple funéraire est sur plusieurs niveaux ; une rampe mène à une terrasse de soixante mètres de large, quarante-trois mètres de profondeur sur laquelle se dresse un grand tumulus carré entouré de cent quarante colonnes octogonales disposées en trois rangées. Le long du mur ouest de ce déambulatoire se trouvaient les sanctuaires de la statue et les tombeaux de plusieurs épouses et filles royales. Ces princesses royales étaient les prêtresses d'Hathor, l'une des principales divinités funéraires égyptiennes. S’il reste peu de choses de la sépulture du roi, six sarcophages ont été trouvés dans les tombeaux des dames royales (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kaouit, Kemsit, Muyet et Sadhe). Chacun d’eux était constitué de six dalles, maintenues ensemble par des attaches métalliques et sculptées en relief. Le sarcophage de la reine Kaouit est aujourd'hui au Musée du Caire (JE 47397).\nLe vestibule est entouré de murs sur trois côtés, le quatrième côté comporte une rampe, reconstituée en 1905 par Naville sur les vestiges de la rampe originale, entourée de deux portiques à double rangée de piliers rectangulaires. Au milieu du vestibule, une ouverture appelée Bab el-Hosan (« Porte du cavalier ») mène à un passage souterrain et à une tombe où un cénotaphe inachevé contient une statue assise du roi. Sur le côté ouest, des tamaris et des sycomores étaient plantés à côté de la rampe.\nÀ l'arrière du vestibule et de la terrasse se trouvent des colonnades décorées en relief avec des processions de bateaux, des chasses et des scènes montrant les exploits militaires du roi.\nDes statues du roi de la douzième dynastie, Sésostris III, ont été retrouvées en ce lieu.\nLa partie intérieure du temple est creusée dans la falaise et se compose d'une cour à péristyle, d'une salle hypostyle et d'un passage souterrain menant à la tombe elle-même. Le culte du roi mort était centré sur le petit sanctuaire taillé à l’arrière de la salle hypostyle.\nUne rampe funéraire et un tunnel descendent sur cent cinquante mètres et aboutissent dans une chambre funéraire située à quarante-cinq mètres sous la cour. La chambre contient un sanctuaire qui abritait autrefois le cercueil en bois de Montouhotep.\n\nTemple funéraire de Montouhotep III\nMontouhotep III choisit de se faire construire une tombe avec un temple funéraire à une centaine de mètres du temple funéraire de son père, derrière la colline de Cheikh Abd el-Gournah ; le monument resta inachevée. Peu de choses restent de ce temple : il ne reste que les vestiges d'une chaussée aboutissant à la plateforme du temple et un passage en pente creusé dans la paroi rocheuse ; ce passage mène à une chambre au plafond en encorbellement, construite en blocs de quartzite rouge. Des graffitis hiératiques gravés à cet endroit semblent avoir été écrits par des prêtres du culte funéraire du roi et indiquent que, malgré l'inachèvement du monument, l'enterrement du roi a bien eu lieu.\n\nTemple funéraire d'Hatchepsout\nLe Djeser-Djeseru, « le Saint des Saints », est le temple funéraire d'Hatchepsout. Il s’agit d’une structure à colonnade conçue et mise en œuvre par Sénènmout, intendant royal et architecte d'Hatchepsout. Il se trouve au sommet d'une série de terrasses, auxquelles on accède par de longues rampes entourées de jardins. Il est considéré comme l'un des monuments incomparables de l'Égypte ancienne.\nBien qu'Hatchepsout se soit inspirée du temple de Montouhotep, Sénènmout a créé une longue terrasse à colonnades sans rapport avec la terrasse de Montouhotep - une différence qui pourrait s’expliquer par l'emplacement décentralisé de la chambre funéraire.\nLes trois terrasses se superposent et comprennent chacune une double colonnade de piliers carrés, à l'exception du coin nord-ouest de la terrasse centrale, qui emploie des colonnes proto-doriques pour abriter la chapelle. Ces terrasses sont reliées par de longues rampes qui étaient autrefois entourées de jardins, avec de l'encens et des arbres à myrrhe. La superposition du temple d'Hatchepsout correspond à la forme thébaine classique, utilisant un pylône, des cours, une salle hypostyle, une cour solaire, une chapelle et un sanctuaire.\nLes décors sculptés du temple d'Hatchepsout racontent l'histoire de la naissance divine du pharaon. Ils évoquent également une expédition au pays de Pount, un pays exotique situé sur la côte de la mer Rouge. De chaque côté de l'entrée du sanctuaire se trouvent des piliers peints avec des représentations d'Hathor. Juste sous le toit se trouve une image de la déesse Ouadjet. Le temple comprend une représentation d'Hatchepsout en pharaon mâle offrant des offrandes à Horus.\nLes statues et ornements du temple ont été volés ou détruits. Ils comprenaient deux statues d'Osiris, une longue avenue bordée de sphinx, ainsi que de nombreuses sculptures de la pharaon Hatchepsout dans différentes attitudes - debout, assise ou agenouillée.\n\nTemple funéraire de Thoutmôsis III\nThoutmôsis III a construit un temple dédié à Amon. Découvert en 1961, il aurait été utilisé lors de la Belle fête de la vallée. On sait peu de choses sur le complexe, car il a été abandonné après avoir subi de graves dommages lors d'un glissement de terrain qui a eu lieu dans la XXe dynastie. Après cette période, il a été utilisé comme source de matériaux de construction et à l’époque chrétienne, il est devenu le site d’un cimetière copte.\nConstruit à la fois en grès et en calcaire, l'érection du temple a été supervisée par le haut fonctionnaire Rekhmirê, vizir de Thoutmôsis III, au cours de la dernière décennie du règne du roi. Une série d'ostraca trouvée sur le site et publiée par William Christopher Hayes en 1960 révèle que la construction a commencé en l’an 43 du règne et n’était probablement pas achevée en l’an 54, année de la mort de Thoutmôsis. Le temple a probablement été achevé par son successeur Amenhotep II, dans les premières années de son règne.\n\nNécropole\nLa nécropole devint fortement utilisée au cours de la XIe dynastie, ceci est probableemnt lié au fait que Montouhotep II choisit de s'y faire enterrer. D'autres tombes plus tardives y seront construites, ou réutilisées dont les fameuses caches royales TT320 et Bab el-Gasous au cours de la XXIe dynastie.\n\nCache royale TT320\nUne tombe (TT320) dans un recoin caché des falaises au sud des temples était initialement prévue pour être la dernière demeure du premier prophète d'Amon Pinedjem II, sa femme Neskhons et plusieurs autres membres de sa famille.\nÀ la mort de Pinedjem II, vers -969, le royaume est en déclin. Les prêtres de la XXIe dynastie y transportent quarante momies royales provenant de la vallée des Rois pour les protéger des pillages.\nDans la cache se trouvaient les momies des rois :\n\nAmenhotep Ier, deuxième souverain de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nAhmôsis Ier, roi fondateur de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nRamsès Ier, roi fondateur de la XIXe dynastie ;\nRamsès II, troisième souverain de la XIXe dynastie ;\nRamsès III, deuxième roi de la XXe dynastie ;\nRamsès IX, huitième pharaon de la XXe dynastie ;\nSéthi Ier, deuxième souverain de la XIXe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis Ier, troisième souverain de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis II, quatrième pharaon de la XVIIIe dynastie ;\nThoutmôsis III, sixième roi de la XVIIIe dynastie.\nAinsi que les personnes royales et prêtres :\n\nIâhhotep Ire\nAhmès-Néfertary\nAhmès-Hénoutemipet, fille de Seqenenrê Tâa\nAhmès-Hénouttamehou\nAhmès-Inhapy\nAhmosé-Méritamon, fille d'Ahmôsis Ier\nAhmosé-Sipair\nSatamon, fille d'Ahmôsis Ier\nAhmès-Satkamosé\nBakt\nDjedptahioufânkh, époux de Nesytanebetisherou\nDouathathor-Henouittaoui\nIset, mère de Thoutmôsis III\nIsetemkheb III\nMaâtkarê\nMasaharta\nMérymosé\nNebseni\nNeskhons\nNesytanebetisherou, fille de Pinedjem II\nNedjemet\nOuepmosé\nOupouaout-Mosé\nPaheripedjet\nPédiamon\nPinedjem Ier\nPinedjem II\nRai, nourrice d'Ahmès-Néfertary\nSeniou\nSiamon, fils d'Ahmôsis Ier\nSiese\nSoutymosé\nTayouheret\nTétishéri\nainsi que huit autres momies non identifiées.\n\nCachette Bab el-Gasous\nAutre cachette de Deir el-Bahari, Bab el-Gasous, la « Porte des Prêtres », a été découverte en 1891, au nord de la cour inférieure du temple de la reine Hatchepsout. Il s’agit d’une grande tombe collective abritant plusieurs centaines de cercueils ainsi qu’une grande quantité d’objets rituels du clergé d’Amon de la XXIe dynastie.\nDatant probablement de -950, elle a permis de regrouper en un seul lieu plus facile à surveiller, les momies des prêtres et prêtresses inhumés initialement dans des tombes individuelles ainsi que leur mobilier funéraire.\nAprès sa découverte, la tombe a été vidée de tous ses artéfacts en quelques jours par les égyptologues français Georges Daressy, Eugène Grébaut et Urbain Bouriant, sans que ceux-ci ne procèdent à des relevés archéologiques des couloirs, ni ne dressent de liste du contenu des lieux. Seules les gravures parues dans la presse permettent d’illustrer son agencement intérieur.\n\nMMA 60\nLa tombe MMA 60 a servi de tombe commune à plusieurs membres de la famille dirigeant Thèbes pendant la XXIe dynastie, dont le grand prêtre d'Amon Menkhéperrê.\n\nTombes privées\nDes tombes privées datant du Moyen Empire à l’époque ptolémaïque ont été également trouvées sur le site.\n\nTT240 - Merou – porteur du sceau royal et superviseur des porteurs de sceaux sous le règne de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT308 – Kemsit – prêtresse d'Hathor et épouse de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT310 – Nom inconnu – chancelier du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT311 – Khéti – trésorier du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT312 – Nespakashouty – gouverneur de la ville et vizir sous le règne de Psammétique Ier (XXVIe dynastie) ;\nTT313 – Henou – explorateur (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT314 – Horhotep – porteur du sceau du roi en Basse-Égypte (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT315 – Ipi – gouverneur de la ville, vizir et juge sous le règne de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT316 – Néferhotep - chef des archers (XIIe dynastie) ;\nTT319 – Néférou II - épouse de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie) ;\nTT320 – la cache initialement prévue pour le premier prophète d'Amon Pinedjem II (XXIe dynastie) ;\nTT353 – Sénènmout – grand majordome de la reine Hatchepsout (XVIIIe dynastie) - architecte et intendant qui supervisait la construction du temple d'Hatchepsout. Sa tombe a également été commencée dans le complexe. Elle a été vandalisée dans l'antiquité, mais certaines des œuvres d'art en relief sont encore intactes. La tombe, d’une longueur de 92 mètres, n'a jamais été finie et Sénènmout n'y a pas été enterré ;\nTT358 – Antef – général de Montouhotep II (XIe dynastie).\nMMA 56 (en) – Ânkhshepenoupet (XXVe dynastie) ;\nMMA 57 (en) – Khamhor (XXVIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 59 (en) – Hénouttaouy F, chanteuse d'Amon (XXIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 506 – Inhumations multiples (XIIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 509a – Inconnu, peut-être Bebi (vizir) (XIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 511 – Inconnu, peut-être Henou (XIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 514 – Inhumations multiples (XIIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 521 – Statue d'Iqer (XIe dynastie) ;\nMMA 801 – Inhumations multiples (XXIIe dynastie).\n\nGalerie photos\nLieu de tournage\nUne équipe de l'émission Secrets d'Histoire a tourné plusieurs séquences sur le site dans le cadre d'un numéro consacré à la reine Néfertiti, intitulé Néfertiti, mystérieuse reine d'Égypte, diffusé le 23 août 2018 sur France 2.\n\nNotes et références\n(en) Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé « Deir el-Bahari » (voir la liste des auteurs).\n\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nVallée des Rois\nThèbes (Égypte)\nMassacre de Louxor du 17 novembre 1997\n\nBibliographie\n(en) Richard H.
