      "content": "## Overview\nDahab (دهب) is a town in Egypt, 85 km (53 miles) north of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Gulf of Aqaba, near the southern tip of Sinai. It is a place that many have fallen in love with over the years, and return to time and time again.\n\n## Understand\nDahab was once an isolated coastal village inhabited only by the local Bedouin. In 1980, there were fewer than 30 Bedouin families in Dahab. Like the Bedouin inland, they had a self-sustaining lifestyle but in Dahab this was based on fishing as well as traditional goat herds. During the summer, many inland Bedouin came to Dahab for fishing and to collect dates, and to enjoy life by the sea. To this day, favourite presents from Dahab (for the inland Bedouin) are dried fish and dates.\nDahab's isolated location, idyllic setting and laid-back Bedouin hospitality made it a favourite destination for all who stumbled upon it. In the beginning (1970s), this was mainly Israeli soldiers or people from the kibbutz during their leave. During the 1980s it turned into a hippie hangout, and in the 1990s adventure enthusiasts from around the world began to discover Dahab's natural wonders. The combination of Red Sea and Sinai desert make Dahab perfect for world class windsurfing, scuba diving, freediving, rock climbing and of course desert trekking with the Bedouin. Add to this cheap accommodation on or near the beach, inexpensive food and drink and a relaxed atmosphere, and you have a heady enticement for the young and young at heart.\nToday's Dahab has evolved into an \"alternative resort\" - the home of independent and adventurous travellers, but also with some more upmarket resorts and hotels. Most of the latter are in the Laguna area or outlying. For some people, this mix is part of Dahab's charm (\"everyone welcome\"), others regard the mix up as a problem: Prices in Assalah are artificially increased which makes it less and less interesting for backpackers, though some locally-run camps still keep affordable. In contrast to that, many package tourists and families won't feel comfortable with the lacking conveniences and the all-handmade-look among the hippies. Note the grotesque, forever unfinished concrete structures as a sign of this mismanagement.\nStill, for everyone with an open mind, Dahab is definitely worth a visit and a place to fall in love with. Particularly in the old part of Dahab (Masbat and Mashraba), you will rarely find a visitor who comes only once to Dahab. To many people this has become a second home.\n\n## Climate\nThe climate is sunny and very dry with almost no rainfall. Summers are very hot at days and warm at nights, but winters are warm with mild nights.\n\n## By bus\n28.4859734.496821 Dahab bus station (East Delta) (in the medina, 3-4 km west of the main tourist strip). This is a woebegone place though there are shops in the vicinity. On arrival you will be mobbed by aggressive taxi drivers, who may even manhandle you into their car. A fair price is LE35 for the whole cab. Be prepared to walk it—and really mean it, it is the \"Method Acting\" approach to haggling - and their price may drop to something realistic. You want to head east, which is slightly downhill, then be trending northeast. So walk 200 m down to the divided highway El Nasr Road, then left / north for 200 m, then the first right is Peace Road which sweeps round into downtown Dahab. In town centre along Peace Road is the East Delta bus office, who sell tickets and can give the latest info on their buses, but buses do not call here: phone is +20 69 3641 808.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.4954134.515022 Go Bus station. Almost opposite the East Delta bus office is where Go Buses arrive from Cairo. It is little more than a dirt parking lot but you have more amenities in the nearby town.    (updated Mar 2020)\nBuses no longer run to and from St Catherine.\nFrom Cairo – Six daily Go Buses, taking 9 hr from Cairo's Turgoman station (central), Abbasseya station (30 min from centre) and Heliopolis (near airport). Buses may not serve all stations. Best to buy tickets in advance, especially for the night buses.\nFrom Sharm el Sheikh town – The bus operator is East Delta. Their published timetable is only a statement of good intentions: services have been pruned back, and this is likely to get worse during 2020. But insha'allah, they may run from Sharm to Dahab at 6AM, 7AM, 8AM, 9AM, 2:30PM, 5PM, 8:30PM; and from Dahab to Sharm at 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, 11:30AM, 12:30PM, 3PM, 4PM, 5:30PM, 7:30PM, 8:30PM, 9:30PM and 10PM. The bus takes just under 2 hr.\nFrom Sharm el Sheikh airport – Your first problem is to get to Sharm bus station 17 km away, see Sharm el Sheikh \"Get in\" for taxi tips. The bus service is erratic, so if you are arriving in the evening your best plan is to pre-arrange a taxi all the way to Dahab, see below. If you do get the bus, notice it stops at wayside halts to pick up waifs and strays, and at a checkpoint and filling station only 5 km from the airport: but will it pick up or drop off anywhere nearer the airport? No chance, they have probably had the frighteners put on them by the taxi cartel.\nFrom the north – This is even more erratic, with maybe one bus or none at all from Taba through Taba Heights and Nuweiba, continuing from Dahab to Sharm. East Delta may not be able to say until shortly before departure whether one is running today.\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi within the centre should not exceed LE30, and LE40-60 for further out including the bus station, as of Aug 2021. Expect them to try to charge you twice that.\n\n## By boat\nSee Nuweiba for details of the ferries from Aqaba in Jordan. These also ply to Taba Heights further up the coast; this route is faster but you need to arrive in Egypt via Nuweiba if you are travelling beyond Sinai and therefore need an Egyptian visa.\nReaching the ferry port from Dahab is by bus or taxi. Usually a bus leaves Sharm at 8:30AM calling at Dahab at 10:30AM on the way north to Taba. So if you phone around 9AM, there should be word on whether it is running today, whereupon you either head for the bus station or negotiate a taxi.\n\n## Orientation\nPlus outlying hotels – Stretching north towards the Blue Hole, and South to Wadi Gnai, there are around 15 outlying resort hotels - mainly booked as package holidays.\nPlus Protected Areas – Dahab is bordered by 2 protected areas: in the south, Nabq Protected Area starts at Wadi Gnai, as in the North Ras Abu Galum Protected Area starts at the Blue Hole. 52% of the Gulf of Aqaba coastline is protected area, which is very important for managing growth and for preserving the reef and eco system. No building is allowed in protected areas, except traditional Bedouin structures.\n\n## On foot\nGetting around Dahab on foot is quite simple, the promenade runs right along the seafront and all the usual amenities are located along it.\n\n## By bicycle\nBicycles are a convenient way to get around Dahab and to get to surrounding sites such as Blue Hole and Three Pools. There is little traffic, and bikes are common so cars take them somewhat into account (as compared to anywhere else in Egypt). There are dedicated bicycle rental stores, but accommodation such as hotels may also have some available. One 28.4966734.516491 bike rental shop is located next to Peace Bridge, which quotes LE100 for one day.\nFor some parts (such as the last part to the Blue Hole), an off-road bike is preferred. On the other hand, most rental places already seem to be mostly offering mountain bikes.\n\n## See\n28.49411334.517191 The Nabataean Port (200 m south of the bridge). It is just a few masonry foundations, but this was once a major port receiving spices and other valuable goods from India. From here goods were taken overland to Petra then onward to Gaza for shipping across the Med. The Nabataeans emerged as an independent Arab nation in the 4th century BC, for long acting as a buffer state for Rome then annexed into the Roman Empire in 106 AD, and disappearing by the 5th century AD. Just peer through the railings on the prom, you havve seen enough.    (updated Mar 2020)\nVery tall palm trees – Straight and stiff-leaved: how many can you spot? Yes, they are mobile telephone masts.\n28.89555634.4221132 Ain Khudra. Bedouin palm-tree oasis. Can be busy in the day. To see it at its best, include in a longer desert safari and stay for dinner and overnight.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.88620634.4265683 White Canyon. Right next to Ain Khudra.    (updated Mar 2020)\n29.14889334.5928964 Coloured Canyon. Mainly a day trip. If you would like to combine as part of a longer desert safari, be sure to have a full Egyptian visa as it is often needed for the best route.    (updated Mar 2020)\nSt. Catherine monastery and Mount Sinai are accessible as of 2023 but the previous public busses seem to no longer run and thus your options are to book a taxi or an organized tour ($25 everywhere in Dahab).\n\n## Offshore\nDahab's main offshore attractions are described here, north to south (the usual direction of current), as there are various ways to enjoy them. Dive shacks and other shore facilities are listed under \"Do\". The coral is very close to shore so you just walk in, but only at selected access points to limit the damage to coral and to you. Boats are only used for outlying sites with no access track. The tidal range in Dahab is at most a metre so all depths cited have that degree of flex.\n28.61478534.5596095 Abu Galoum (15 km north of town). A nature reserve with camping and snorkelling. No road so you need a boat or camel to get in; few bother so it is a quiet spot.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.57234.5376 The Blue Hole (close to shore at the dead-end of a dirt track 7 km north of town). The signature dive at Dahab. It is safe and enjoyable provided you are sensible about depth limits, but the layout creates a temptation to dive deeper. Much deeper. Much much deeper and then it is curtains. This area has cafes and toilets but no dive shack, bring all your own kit. It can get crowded, as excursion buses often come from Sharm-el-Sheikh. The \"hole\" is a sinkhole some 100 m across and just over 100 m deep, surrounded by shallow reef, and with a \"saddle\" 6-7 m deep between the hole and open sea. The deep sheltered waters make it popular with freedivers, and it is often good for snorkelling and diving on windy days when other sites are too rough. Divers typically swim underwater across the hole, with the Arch glimmering far below (this would be a really bad time to lose a weight-belt). There is not much coral within the hole so they then cross the saddle to explore the better stuff outside.The Arch in the side of the Blue Hole is the killer if you are not geared up for a technical dive, and sometimes even if you are. It is a tunnel between hole and open sea that glimmers temptingly. \"Aw c'mon, just a quick extra descent to look-see, can't hurt?\" But it is deeper than it looks, with the entrance at 55 m. And it is not a simple archway but a 26 m tunnel. \"Still, now we're here . . . \" then it springs its trap: the tunnel roof slopes down to 85 m before trending up again into the open sea, while its floor drops away below 120 m. If you come down here breathing air or even nitrox, you will be as drunk as a skunk in a barrel of moonshine. And your air consumption is 9+ times faster than on the surface; if you are only toting a single gas tank, it will last less than ten min—not enough to get back, let alone for the considerable decompression period you have incurred. Technical divers with rebreathers and trimix gas also sometimes perish here, but their kit is inherently more hazardous, and it is not clear whether they suffer more accidents in the Blue Hole than at similar depths elsewhere. US$10/€9/LE150 fee for tourists (and a trivial fee for Egyptians).    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.57345434.539277 The Bells. A nearby site often combined with Blue Hole by drifting south. It is a narrow groove through the reef; as well as the coral there is an arch at modest depth and a natural chimney you can swim up or down. Officially it is named for two rocks like church bells, unofficially it is because divers keep clanging their tanks against the walls.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.55734.5238 Canyon (along the same track 5 km north of town). There is a collection of cafes. The canyon is an underwater gully with overhanging walls. Enter and exit via the broader middle section, you are not allowed to pass through \"The Fishbowl\" chimney at its shallow end. In 2020 a humongous green moray eel resides on the canyon walls, rolling its jaws like a Moloch awaiting the pizza delivery boy. No fee to come this far.    (updated Mar 2020)\nAbu Telha and Abu Helal are at the north edge of Dahab, with a smaller canyon. The road is paved this far.\n28.50634.529 Eel Garden (at the north end of the promenade strip, 1 km from the bridge). They are sand eels, scores of them shaped like a \"?\" and gently swaying. They retract as you approach and extend as you leave, to resume considering their question.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.49934.51910 Lighthouse (just north of the midtown bridge). The shallows are red gravel washed down from the wadi, deepening to a sea grass meadow which is a likely area to spot turtles or sea horses. A life-sized but dilapidated metal statue of an elephant at 18 m depth is the cue to turn north and come onto the attractive coral reef.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.49166534.5146211 Mashraba (just south of the bridge is the mirror image of Lighthouse). You descend across the gravel wash to the meadow then turn south along the reef. It is the house reef for the southside dive shacks.    (updated Mar 2020)\n28.4834.51312 Laguna Beach (1 km south of the bridge). The beach and nearby Islands. It is shallow, good for snorkelling and beginner divers.\nThe spit off the spit south end of the promenade is exposed to wind and currents, so people windsurf here but divers and snorkellers seldom come.\n28.47534.50313 The Lagoon. A sheltered sandy bay good for kiddy-bathing and windsurfing. No coral so you do not cut your feet, but it means nothing for snorkellers or divers to look at.\nGabr el Bint further south has no road access so you get here by boat.\n\n## Do\n28.4534.462714 Wadi Qnai (7 km south of town). Variously spelled, an attractive granite valley with an oasis, Bedouin gardens and beach strip. Good for hikes, dinner in the mountains and rock climbing. Sites are \"Golden Blocks\" (large coral blocks boiling with marine life), \"Moray Garden\", \"Three Pools\", \"Om Sid\" and \"Caves\" which are really just overhangs. This is the end of the track, as the road heads inland towards Sharm. Few come this far south, so the table corals are in better shape than near town.    (updated Mar 2020)\nWindsurfing and kite-surfing. Dahab has about 270 days a year of wind. Experts with their own equipment can also surf from Masbat Bay, but must take care not to hit the snorkellers and freedivers on Lighthouse Reef. Kite surfing can be done around the lagoon area, at Eel Garden or at other spots. Some kiters head out to the Laguna at Ras Abu Galoum - a stunning location and you will be just 1 or 2 kites rather than 10 or 20!For wind forecast for Dahab see Wind Guru. There are several windsurfing schools around Laguna area offering all levels of courses like Harry Nass Winsurf & Kite Centres Dahab and Happy Kite. (updated Mar 2020)\nKayaking – Sea kayaks are available for hire. From LE50/hr, or try a guided night kayak—great for hot summer nights.\nYoga, Reiki, and Chi Gong – As of 2020 no-one is advertising classes, probably the thing to do is link up informally with others.\nLearn Arabic – and see Egypt#Talk. But make a start before coming here so that you can confidently exchange greetings and salutations. It's Egyptian Arabic you will use, do not bother with MSA which only newsreaders and government officials declaim.\nDo nothing – Just chill, that is the most traditional activity in Dahab. Watch the rippling sea and the changing pattern of light over the mountains.\n\n## Diving and freediving\nThere are dozens of diving and freediving centres in Dahab, but some are not properly licensed by the Ministry of Tourism (subject to annual inspections and fees). Before you book, check the CDWS web site to make sure you avoid blacklisted centres: [dead link]\nBedouin Divers. Familiar dive center on the coast of the Red Sea in the Mashraba area of Dahab.

Boat excursions and Camel Dive Safaris are also arranged.\nReef 2000 Diving Center (next to the Bedouin Moon Hotel), ☏ +20 693640087, info@reef2000.com. By Bedouin Moon Hotel, is a PADI 5* Gold Palm Resort and an IANTD technical facility. It offers a wide range of courses, from beginner- to technical diving courses. (updated Apr 2017)\nSea Dancer Dive Center. Small professionally run outfit on the sea front. Offers the full range of courses as well as guided dives. Staff are knowledgeable, experienced, enthusiastic and friendly, the equipment is a good standard and well maintained.\nWorld of freediving. A freediving school which offers a wide range of freediving courses and training options for every level of ability, including AIDA Instructor Courses. All the courses are AIDA courses and the staff are all experienced AIDA trained instructors.\n\n## Desert excursions and trekking\nLots of agencies along the beach front are touting excursions. But the hotel and dive resorts also organise these, and have a stronger incentive to make sure their customers are happy. Trekking might involve hiking, horse-riding, camels, or various off-road vehicles.\nDay trips might be to Wadi Qnai and Ein Khudra. These places can feel touristy and crowded.\nOvernight is when you really get the desert experience. The canyons fall silent, stars blaze in a clear sky, the coffee-pot stews by the camp fire, and you sure wish you would brought an extra pullover and toilet roll.\nLonger trips are grandly called a \"safari\", which of course is the Arabic word for a journey. The traditional destination was inland towards Mount Sinai, but this remains compromised by the terrorist threat. Tours also venture as far as Petra in Jordan, Jerusalem in Israel, and Cairo and Luxor in Egypt: they are all top-rank destinations well worth seeing, but deserve a trip in their own right. These safaris may involve a flight from Sharm but more often a very long bus ride, where the rest hours of the driver (and of the oncoming drivers) may be a concern. You may also need an Egyptian visa, which you do not for the Dahab area: the safari agencies can arrange this quickly.\n\n## Rock climbing\nThe Sinai Desert has excellent rock climbing in the granite mountains and wadis. October–April only (i.e. not the hot summer months). The main area near to Dahab is Wadi Qnai:\nVast amounts of perfect bouldering on granite boulders in shaded, sand-floored valleys\nSingle and multi-pitch equipped sport routes for all levels of climbers in Waterfalls, Camel Canyon and Wadi Connection\nTop roping area especially for beginners and children in Middle Qnai\nPlus new routing possibilities for sport climbs in many easily accessible areas.\nDesert Divers have led the way in developing rock climbing in the Sinai. They can arrange for permits to Wadi Qnai, equipment hire, drivers, guides and anything else you might need. They have published the Sinai Rock Climbing Guide complete with topos and route descriptions. Their instructors are happy to share/offer advice to experienced climbers who can 'self-guide', or they can help you improve your climbing with beginner and Advanced technique courses.\nSt. Catherine also has incredible tradclimbing and bouldering. Base yourself in the village at Fox Camp [dead link] or Sheikh Mousa Bedouin Camp[dead link] with easy access (5 min to 2 hours) to more than 60 routes. All long multipitch (7+ pitch), but wide range of grades. If you are a group, it is great fun to head deep into the desert by camel where you will find unclimbed lines almost everywhere you look! Absolutely no bolting allowed in St Catherine, and please respect the holy mountains of Mt Sinai and St Katherine by walking the traditional pilgrimage paths rather than climbing.\n\n## Buy\nGreat buys are the usual Egyptian suspects: water pipes, rugs, oriental lamps, shirts in different lengths with embroidery, backgammon games, silver jewellery, etc.  Prices are geared for tourists, so haggling is a must, pay max. 50-60% of the first price offered, anything else is a rip-off. If you are not sure about the price, go to the next shop, they all offer more or less the same things, and start bargaining again there.\nLook out for Bedouin handicrafts, some beautiful pieces are available. Hand embroidered and made in Dahab, St Catherines and El Arish by Bedouin women. Sheikh Salem House has a good selection of items as does some of the other Bedouin establishments in Dahab.\nIt is almost impossible to get rolling tobacco in Dahab, be prepared if you are not keen on factory made ones.\nGhazala Market. If your stay extends with or without intention your shopping behaviour will focus on this market. Here you can find anything you need to update your on-the-road-equipment from functional to convenient. For local fare and much cheaper fruit and veg, go to Assalah shopping area (5 min taxi, or walk to Eel Garden then head into town). (updated Mar 2020)\nDahab Community Market (Sheikh Salem House near Eel Garden). Every F 3PM-7PM. You will find hand-made Bedouin and Egyptian crafts, jewelry, clothes, second hand bargains, foods from around the world including homemade Egyptian food, cakes and desserts. (updated Mar 2020)\n\n## Eat\nThe trick to eating cheaply in Dahab is to avoid seafront establishments and go a block or two inland, where prices are half for equivalent quality. Lots of budget places in the back lanes serve falafel, koshari, chicken and fish. For fish, the prices shown are usually per kilo not per fish. Try bargaining.\nAli Baba Hotel has a good restaurant, see \"Sleep\".\nHell's Kitchen, Lighthouse Rd (Hidden in alley between bridge and the big supermarket), ☏ +20 102 292 4824. M-Sa 4PM-10PM.

Premiership football and other major sports shown on the big screen terrace and downstairs in the air con bar.\nElzar Bar, next to the ruins of the old harbour on the beachfront. The best place in town for anyone wanting to get pissed late at night. Chris the Aussie barman is always on hand until the sun comes up serving a variety of alcoholics including the drunken Welshman and unconfrontational Dave the Canadian nice man.\nThe Furry Cup, at the Blue Beach Hotel, where local Westerners hang out at the sound of U2, Coldplay, etc. The only place in Dahab where you can get Western hard liquor brands instead of the fakes.\n\n## Sleep\nDahab has lots of budget to mid-range accommodation and lacks upmarket places. Prices are low by western standards and even lower once you go 100 m back from the beach strip.\n\n## Budget\n28.4929534.5158611 Charlie's House, Lighthouse Rd, ☏ +20 1225745034, nileraptor_51@yahoo.com.

(updated Mar 2020)\n\n## Stay safe\nSee the warning in the Sinai and Egypt articles for information about the security situation in Dahab.\nWomen travellers are safe in Dahab, but please be savvy:\nSnorkeling along the reef can be hazardous if the wind gets up. Waves may dash you onto the sharp coral, the current may carry you past your exit point, and in a rising sea you may have difficulty spotting the next safe exit. Other water users have more escape options, eg divers can re-descend to pick out a route inshore.\nDrugs, particularly marijuana, are widely available in Dahab but not legal. You would risk large fines and maybe a lengthy stay in one of Egypt's notoriously squalid prisons.\nChild beggars: If you signed up for a group activity, like snorkeling along the coast or going for a tour into the desert, you will likely encounter child beggars. They usually are in a group of 5, boys and girls and will try to sell you bracelets. They are very instistive from the beginning and if you look at them, talk to them or buy from them, their style will get even more aggressive and pushy and would be somewhat shocking.\n\n## Go next\nAlong the coast to the south, Sharm el Sheikh will feel very busy and tourist-trappy after Dahab. Going north, Nuweiba and Taba are little developed.\nCrossing into Israel, Eilat is a brash building site. Just use it as a base or for its airport, or head swiftly on towards Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, or Jordan. Bear in mind that Israel does not stamp your passport but the Egyptian border post at Taba does, so it will be obvious from the exit stamp that you crossed into Israel.\nAqaba in Jordan is more conveniently reached by ferry from Nuweiba. It has great diving and is within an hour's drive of fabulous Petra.\nCairo and raffish Alexandria deserve several days to explore.\nLuxor until 2019 involved travelling via Cairo, but will become more accessible if the Sharm-Hurghada ferry restarts in 2020.\nPilgrims to Medina and Mecca can reach them by ferry from Nuweiba (horribly congested for Hajj, quieter for Umrah at other times). Your Saudi Arabian visa needs sorting well in advance.",
