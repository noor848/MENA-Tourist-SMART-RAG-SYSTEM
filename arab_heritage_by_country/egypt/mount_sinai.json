      "content": "Mount Sinai, also known as Jabal Musa (Arabic: جَبَل مُوسَىٰ, lit. 'Mountain of Moses'), is a mountain on the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. It is one of several locations claimed to be the biblical Mount Sinai, the place where, according to the sacred scriptures of the three major Abrahamic religions (Torah, Bible, and Quran), the Hebrew prophet Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.\nIt is a 2,285-meter (7,497 ft) mountain near the city of Saint Catherine in the region known today as the Sinai Peninsula. It is surrounded on all sides by higher peaks in the mountain range of which it is a part. For example, it lies next to Mount Catherine which, at 2,629 m or 8,625 ft, is the highest peak in Egypt.\n\nGeology\nMount Sinai's rocks were formed during the late stage of the evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Mount Sinai displays a ring complex that consists of alkaline granites intruded into diverse rock types, including volcanics. The granites range in composition from syenogranite to alkali feldspar granite. The volcanic rocks are alkaline to peralkaline, and they are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and subvolcanic porphyry.\n\nReligious significance\nJudaism and Christianity\nImmediately north of the mountain is the 6th-century Saint Catherine's Monastery. The summit has a mosque that is still used by Muslims, and a Greek Orthodox chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th-century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical Tablets of Stone. At the summit also is \"Moses' cave\", where the Hebrew prophet Moses is believed to have waited to receive the Ten Commandments from God.\n\nIslam\nThe Jabal Musa is associated with the Islamic prophet Mūsā ibn ʿImrān (i.e., Moses). In particular, numerous references to Jabal Musa exist in the Quran, where it is called Ṭūr Saināʾ, Ṭūr Sīnīn, and aṭ-Ṭūr and al-Jabal (both meaning \"the Mount\"). As for the adjacent Wād Ṭuwā (Valley of Tuwa), it is considered as being muqaddas (sacred), and a part of it is called Al-Buqʿah Al-Mubārakah (\"The blessed Place\").\n\nAscent and summit\nThere are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route, Siket El Bashait, takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though camels can be used. The steeper, more direct route (Siket Sayidna Musa) is up the 3,750 \"steps of penitence\" in the ravine behind the monastery.\n\nSee also\nHashem El Tarif\nSacred mountains\nJebel Musa, Morocco, a similarly named mountain in Morocco\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Mount Sinai travel guide from Wikivoyage\nCaucasian Albanian Alphabet Discovered and Deciphered, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 11:3 (Autumn 2003).

      "content": "## Overview\nMount Sinai (Arabic جبل موسَى Gebel Musa) is in the middle of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt and rises 2,285 metres above sea level. The mountain is a sacred site for Jews, Christians and Muslims.\n\n## Understand\nMount Sinai is said to be the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God; indeed, the Arabic name Gebel Musa means \"Mount of Moses\". While there is very little archaeological evidence to support this assertion, the mountain is still a popular pilgrimage site and home to the world heritage listed Monastery of St. Catherine, a Greek Orthodox monastery founded in the 6th century, one of the longest-running monasteries in the world and itself at the supposed location of the Burning Bush.  The small town of al-Minya, outside the entrance to the valley, has sprung up to cater to tourists.\nThe mountain is also a holy site for Muslims, who consider this to be the place from where the prophet Muhammed started his journey to heaven on the winged horse Buraq.\n\n## Climate\nDaytime temperatures vary from mild to warm around the year. However, nighttime temperatures are considerably lower. Precipitation is negligible through most of the year.\nSt. Catherine is one of the oldest monasteries in the world, founded sometime in the early 4th century. According to the 9th century chronicles of patriarch Eutychios of Alexandria, the monastery was founded in 324 by emperor Helena who visited monks living in the mountains. The monastery was also mentioned in the diaries of a nun, Etheria of Galicia, who visited towards the end of the 4th century.\nThe monastery got its current form between 548 and 564 when the East Roman emperor Justinian I according to the wishes of the monks built the fortification and stationed a force to protect the monastery. Some of the monks still opted to continue living outside the walls. During this period the main church of the site was constructed. A century later, the remains of Catherine of Alexandria was found at the nearby mountain nowadays known as Mount Catherine. She was the daughter of a Cypriot king who refused to abandon her faith and to marry the pagan Roman emperor Maxentius and was therefore tortured and beheaded in 305. The remains were brought to the monastery, which was also renamed after her.\nAlso the future prophet Muhammed visited the monastery several times, and later on he guaranteed the protection of the monastery. Only in the 11th century the caliph Al-Hakim threatened to destroy the monastery, and between the 15th and 18th centuries the monks were indeed expelled numerous times but the monastery itself was never destroyed.\n1575 the monastery was declared independent from Rome, at that time St. Catherine was the site of an archdiocese. Later on, under the guardianship of the Russian czar, a Greek-Orthodox monastery was established. Nowadays the monastery is juridically a part of the patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\n## Get in\nThe closest airport with passenger traffic is in Sharm el-Sheikh, and your only choice of transport is by road. Dahab is 2 hours and 133 km away, Nuweiba is 120 km and a similar 2 hours away, while the trip from Sharm el-Sheikh (230 km) is closer to 3 hours. Most visitors arrive on tours that arrive at approximately 1AM at the foot of the mountain in order to climb Mount Sinai overnight and watch the sunrise. Any guesthouse in Sinai can arrange for you to join a tour. There are also several camps, guesthouses and hotels in St. Catherine that can accommodate tourists and travellers alike.\n\n## By bus\nTo arrive from Nuweiba, they were a minibus, but it is not working any more (June 2025). So you have first to go to Dahab with Go Bus or East Delta.\nFrom Dahab, there is a minibus daily mainly used by tourists for a night trip to mount Sinai. Usually it is booked by tour operators, but you can simply call the driver, it will be cheaper (Alaa, ☏ +20 100622652. He speaks really good English). The minibus leaves Dahab daily around 10PM and comes back in the morning around 8AM - 10AM (check with Alaa). The price is around US$5 one way (June 2025).\nFrom Cairo, the East Delta Bus Company leaves the new Cairo Gateway station daily at 11AM and takes about 7 hours (to be checked as of June 2025 it may not exist any more. But you can still go via Suez (see below) or via Dahab (probably faster)). The cost is LE75 (Apr 2016), and the schedule for this bus is also available at the Bedouin Bus home page.\nFrom Suez. There is a minibus daily leaving the bus station which is about 8km from the city centre, but time schedule has to be checked. It returns from Ste Catherine to Suez, leaving Ste Catherine around 5:30AM, starting in front of the restaurant Cleopatra (and has to be booked, ask a local). The price is about US$4 and the journey is about 5 to 6 hours, depending on how long you stay at the checkpoints (June 2025). If you go from Ste Catherine to Suez and want to continue to Cairo, you can then take another minibus directly from the same bus station or a train. There is a train leaving at 3PM (but long ride). If you choose the train, ask the driver to leave you at the train station, otherwise the bus will go directly to the bus station (about 4km from the train station).\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi from Dahab or Nuweiba can cost around LE200 (Dec 2011).\n\n## Get around\nYou have two choices for getting around and climbing the mountain: on foot, or by camel.  See Do for the full scoop.\n\n## See\nThe Monastery of St. Catherine (دير سانت كاترين, Dair Sānt Kāt(a)rīn), at the foot of the mountain, is the easier of the two destinations here. Looking more like a fortress than a church, access is through a massive iron gate shut for the night and opened in the morning from 9AM to noon only (daily except Friday and Sunday). Note that the monastery observes the Greek Orthodox rites and is thus also closed for Christmas and Easter as calculated by the Greek Orthodox calendar. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2002.\nIn Feb 2011, only a few parts of the monastery were accessible to tourists.\nThere is also a small museum mainly about Byzantine icons and tempera on wood. You must make a LE25 donation as entrance fee but it is worth it.\nA guide for the monastery could start at LE100 but you should bargain.\nNowadays about two dozen, mostly Greek, monks live at the monastery. They elect the abbot and archbishop, who mostly lives in Cairo. At the time he isn't present, four caretakers are performing his functions.\nThe main service takes place from 4:30 to 7:30AM, while the vesper takes place from 2:30 to 4PM. In order to keep up the normal functions of the monastery, visitors are only allowed in between 9AM and noon. On Friday, Sunday and Greek Orthodox holidays it is entirely closed. Yearly some 100,000 people visit the monastery, which means that it can get quite crowded during the opening hours. Entrance is free, but the museum charges you LE20. To enter the protected area, to which also the monastery belongs there's a fee of LE17 for adults and LE10 for students.\nThe monastery complex is 1570 m above sea level at the foot of Mount Sinai in the Monastery Valley — Wadi ed-Deir. It is surrounded by a walls that are 12–15 m tall and 2 m thick. The old entrance is located at the western side and was only built in the early 19th century when Napoleon invaded Egypt; before this people entered and exited the site by the elevators used for goods. This entrance was actually named after the French general Jean-Baptiste Kleber.\nHowever today's visitors will use the newer gate, at the northern side of the complex. When entering, you will see the monks' housing building at the right-hand site. Straight ahead stands the main church — the 28.5560233.976191 St. Catherine church.\nBuilt in the mid-6th century, this basilica features inscriptions about emperor Justinian, empress Theodora I, as well as the church's architect Stephanos of Aila. The doors are made of cedar and are decorated with various ornaments. The three main sections of the church are demarcated by twelve granite pillars and have three chapels each, named after saints. The sacristy and the treasure room make up the rest of the church. The tower of the church is comparatively new, constructed only in 1871.\nIconostases and mosaics from several epochs can be seen in the church. The most famous of them is the Mosaic of the Transfiguration. Overall St.Catherine possesses a collection of some 2000 icons. At the right-hand side of the altar there's the marble shrine containing the relics of St. Catherine. The holiest place is the 28.5560133.976342 Chapel of the Burning Bush, located behind the choir. It was constructed in the 13th century at the place where, according to the Book of Exodus, Moses was instructed by God to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.\nIn the northwest of the complex you'll find the 28.5561833.976083 Well of Moses; the spring that supplies water to the monastery and, according to legend, the location where Moses met his wife for the first time. Next to it, the Monastery museum, showing icons, writings, equipment used for services as well as gifts given by pilgrims.\nAt the west side there's the 28.5560533.975874 Omar Mosque from the 12th century, with a minaret north of the mosque itself.\nOther parts of St. Catherine is normally not accessible to visitors. Accommodation inside the monastery is found at the west and south. The south-eastern part hosts the library; the world's oldest Christian library and with 3500 religious manuscripts and 50,000 books the second largest after the one in the Vatican. 4500 of the works are regarded as rare, but perhaps the largest treasure is the Codex Sinaiticus, the world's oldest almost perfectly preserved Bible, discovered in 1844 by the German theologian Konstantin von Tischendorff. No access without special permission (granted only to VIPs and bona fide scholars).\nOutside the walls, on the western side, there's a garden, cemetery and 28.5559233.975255 ossuary. The latter is a morbid charnel house containing the skulls of 1400 years' worth of monks who have lived and died here.\n\n## Climbing Mount Sinai\nClimbing 28.538533.97511 Mount Sinai is the main objective for most visitors. Mount Sinai is the second highest mountain in Egypt – only neighbouring Mount Catherine is higher. Therefore you will have an undisturbed view in all directions. Many tourists climb the mountain during the night, see the sunrise at the summit and visit the monastery during the day. Therefore, if you want to avoid crowds, climb the mountain in the night before a Friday or Sunday when the monastery is closed to visitors. If you want to see the sunrise, you should start sometime between midnight and 3AM, depending on your level of fitness. Those of average fitness should be able to get to the summit in no more than three hours. Alternatively, the sunset is also an impressive sight; for this you should start your climb in the early afternoon.\nA local guide is required despite the fact the trails are well signposted once you get onto them. Starting price at the entrance LE110 (Apr 2016) but bargain it. In daytime, which is less popular, the fee is lower. If you go from Dahab, you can book the minibus (go and back) + guide, at the tour operator called Bedouina Tours for US$30. For a better price, you can also directly ask Alaa (the driver of the minibus, ☏ +20 100622652) to arrange the tour for you (about US$15 for the same trip by minibus + guide, June 2025).\nIt will be much cooler at the summit than on the coast, and in the winter subzero temperatures at night and even snow are not unknown. Dress warmly in layers, a torch is also a must. Blankets and mattresses can be rented at the top for ~LE10 per piece, however, their state of cleanliness may be objectionable.\nThere are two routes to choose from, entrances to which are rather poorly signposted, so choose carefully especially if climbing at night.  Both paths lead to natural amphitheatre known as Elijah's Hollow or the Seventy Elders of Israel, where you'll find a teahouse for a break.  From there, it's a final 750 steps (30 minutes) to reach the summit.\nSteps of Penitence.  This aptly named steep path has been quite literally carved out of the rock by monks, and with 3750 steps to climb is the shorter but more challenging of the two.  No mountain-climbing equipment required though, just strong thighs, and the views back down into the valley are superb even in the middle of the night.  If the sky is clear the stars above can also be a spellbinding sight, as there are no major cities for miles and miles around.  The route can be climbed in as little as 45 minutes, or as long as three hours, depending on your pace.\nCamel Path (Siket El Bashait).  A gentler, winding, wide path that snakes its way up to the summit that can be completed by the average traveller in 2½ hours. As you can guess from the name, you can also climb up this way on the back of camel, and the \"sawdust\" that appears to coat much of the length of the path is in fact dried camel byproducts from the many trips before you. Be warned that the camel will bite you if it doesn't like you, so be nice, and a 3-hour ride up a mountain – going on foot is actually faster for most people – may not be the easiest introduction to the notoriously swaying gait of these camels.  You'll also have to dismount about a kilometre before you reach the top and cover the last 700 steps on foot. Take care at the top also, as the surface is uneven.\nAt the top you will find a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of an older 16th-century church.  Better yet, if you timed your ascent right, you can see the sunrise over the parched, rocky expanse of the Sinai.\nThe intense silence of the mountain as well as its spiritual history makes it a popular spot for yoga and meditation groups. The local 'Gebeliya' Bedouin also run silent retreats for visitors, as well as trekking trips.\n\n## Climbing Mount Catherine\n28.509533.95532 Mount Catherine (جبل كاترين Ǧabal Kāt(a)rīn) is a few kilometres south-west of Mount Sinai and is with 2637m the highest mountain in the Sinai and in all of Egypt. The relics of Saint Catherine were found at this mountain, and due to this discovery the monastery and the mountain were renamed.\nThe trek starts at the monastery, crosses the plain of el-Milga past Aaron's chapel, the monastery of the holy apostle and the pavilion of king Fuad. After an hour of walking you'll reach the 28.5358333.964443 monastery of the 40 martyrs (دير الاربعين Dair al-Arbaʿīn). From here, there is a four-hour climb to the summit, where you'll find the chapel of St. Catherine. Inside the chapel, a rug marks the place where the relics were found.\nNote that you must go with a guide. As of June 2025, there is only one guide doing it for about US$50.\n\n## Buy\nFansina.
