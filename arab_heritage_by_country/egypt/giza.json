      "content": "Giza (; sometimes spelled Gizah, Gizeh, Geeza, Jiza; Arabic: الجيزة, romanized: al-Jīzah, pronounced [ald͡ʒiːzah], Egyptian Arabic: الجيزة el-Gīza [elˈgiːzæ]) is the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and sixteenth-largest city in Africa by population. It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,458,135 as of 2023. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Memphis (Men-nefer, today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.\nGiza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples and the Grand Egyptian Museum. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.\n\nDistricts and population\nThe city of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate.\n\n2017 population and administrative divisions\nGiza city is a municipal division and capital of Giza governorate with an appointed city head. It comprises nine districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and five new towns (mudun jadidah) administered by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA).\nThe districts/qisms fully subsume to the city head and according to the 2017 census had 4,872,448 residents:\n\nThe new towns are mostly administered by the national level New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), with some public services under the jurisdiction of Giza. They are confusingly named madina (city), however they are not administratively incorporated as such where many are formed of a single district or qism. Ones not in the 2017 census as they were not yet incorporated, or inhabited at that time are:\n\nNew 6th of October\nOctober Gardens\nNew Sphinx\nPermanently inhabited Nile islands:\n\nQorsaya Island (Janoub/Giza district)\nDahab Island  (Janoub/Giza district)\nAl-Warraq Island (Al-Warraq district)\n\n2006 population\nThe city's population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is. The former figure corresponds to the sum of nine districts/qisms.\n\nGeography and climate\nGiza's most famous landform and archaeological site, the Giza Plateau, holds some major monuments of Egyptian history, and is home to the Great Sphinx. Once thriving with the Nile that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the pyramids of Giza were built overlooking the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis, across the river from modern day Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the Prime Meridian, a reference point used for determining a base longitude.\n\nClimate\nGiza experiences a hot desert like arid climate (Köppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Windstorms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow is extremely rare.\nUp to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36 °F) on 8 January 1966.\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nThe area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the second millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex, featuring the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Great Sphinx of Giza and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nClassical to medieval era\nAs ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή) or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning \"the fortress\", now Tersa) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.\nEgyptians called the area Tipersis (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ and Sahidic Coptic: ⲧⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ ⲛ̀ⲃⲁⲃⲩⲗⲱⲛ, lit. 'the Persian (fortress) of Babylon'). Eutychius gives a legend about the city's name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus or Hūš (Arabic: خوش), and Abu Salih says it was found by him at the same time as Qasr ash-Sham, but as older evidence is missing, it is perhaps most likely to have been founded during the Sasanian conquest of Egypt in the early 7th century.\nAs Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD (year 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. Al-Maqrizi suggested an irregular Arameo-Arabic root meaning \"edge, side\" to be the source. Everett-Heath suggested Ancient Egyptian: r-gs-ḥr \"on the side of the height (pyramid)\". Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from Middle Persian: 𐭣𐭦, romanized: diz, lit. 'fortress, castle', which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.\n\nInfrastructure\nGiza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of roads, streets, and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau, and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza's infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d'état, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city's importance in tourism. Giza's St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza.\nThe city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region, the Giza Zoo. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means \"Forest Park\" in the Turkish language.\n\nGiza Zoo\nThe Giza Zoo (حديقة حيوان الجيزة, Ḥadīqat Ḥaywān Al-Gīzah), established on March 1, 1891, holds the distinction of being Africa's first zoo and the world's third oldest zoological garden. Located on approximately 80 acres (32 hectares), the zoo was originally designed as a botanical garden and features several historical architectural elements.\n\nHistorical features\nThe zoo contains several notable architectural and cultural landmarks:\n\nA suspension bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel (1875-1879), considered the world's first elevated zoo viewing platform\nThe Japanese Kiosk, constructed in 1924 during King Fuad's reign\nOriginal gates from the Khedive's Palace and Haramlik Palace\nRoads paved with black stone imported from Trieste\nMosaic-decorated footpaths\nA marble island known as Tea Island\n\nAnimal collection\nThe zoo houses approximately 4,000 animals representing over 175 species, including:\n\nLarge mammals: Lions, tigers, giraffes, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses\nPrimates: Various monkey and ape species\nBirds: Native and exotic species including flamingos and rare birds\nReptiles: Including Egyptian cobras and Nile crocodiles\n\nRecent developments\nIn 2023, the Egyptian government announced plans to expand the number of animal species from 71 to 186. The renovation project includes:\n\nCreation of specialized zones: Asia, Africa, America, Family Zone, Safari Trips\nEstablishment of educational centers\nPreservation of historical landmarks\nImprovement of animal enclosures\n\nOperating hours\nSummer (April-September): 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM\nWinter (October-March): 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM\nThe zoo serves multiple functions as a recreational facility, research institute, and cultural landmark.\n\nTransportation\nTransportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.\nGiza shares with Cairo a subway system, officially called the \"Metro (مترو)\", a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with 6th of October City, Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Traffic in Giza is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.\nOther means of transport include:\n\nCairo Taxi\nUber (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nCareem (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nSwvl (available in Cairo and Giza since 2017)\nWater taxis (motorized feluccas) available for transport to nearby places along the Nile River\n\nEconomy\nIndustries in Giza include film making Giza in a hub of Egyptian studios like Studio Misr and alahram studio, and movie production companies like Al Sobki productions headed by Mohamed Alsobki.\nA main source of income in Giza is tourism as a home to many historical sites including the Great Pyramid and Pyramid of Djoser and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nChemicals is an important industry in Giza, Giza Paints & Chemical Industries was established in 1984. \nGiza has many luxury apartment buildings along the Nile, making it a popular place to live.\n\nInternational access\nAccess to the city of Giza, which has its own governorate adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the Cairo International Airport. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the Imbaba Airport, but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.\nSphinx International Airport was opened in 2018 as an alternative to the already congested Cairo International Airport, but also to improve accessibility to the Giza necropolis as well as to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nEducation\nGiza's learning institutions include Cairo University, which was moved to Giza in 1924. The city is a hub of education and educational services not only for Egypt but also for the entire Mediterranean Region. Giza has numerous schools, kindergartens, and institutes of higher learning.\nThe Cairo Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is in Giza. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule, a German international school, is located in Dokki in Giza. Previously the Pakistan International School of Cairo had its campus in Giza.\n\nSports\nThe city hosts the second most successful sports club in Egypt and Africa, El Zamalek, which is located in the Meet Okba neighbourhood near the Mohandesin neighbourhood. Beside El Zamalek there are other clubs like El Tersana and Seid Shooting Club which is one of the elite clubs in Egypt.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nGiza is twinned with:\n\n Istanbul, Turkey\n Los Angeles, United States\n\nNotable people\nAmr Abou El Seoud (born 1968), bank CEO\nYehia Chahine, actor\nAhmed El-Ahmar, handball player\nAbdel Halim Ali, football player\nNora Armani, actor and filmmaker of Armenian descent\n\nSee also\nGiza church fire\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nList of megalithic sites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDer Manuelian, Peter. 2017.

Elle possède aussi un club de football, le Tersana Sporting Club, ayant connu son heure de gloire dans le football égyptien durant les années 1960.\n\nTourisme\nHaut lieu touristique grâce à la présence des pyramides, dont celle de Khéops qui reste classée parmi les Sept Merveilles du monde depuis l'Antiquité, le site de Gizeh est menacé par la rapide expansion du Caire dont l'urbanisation importante et peu contrôlée grignote peu à peu les alentours du site y compris sur le désert.\nDe ce fait, une nouvelle politique de protection du plateau est en cours d'élaboration avec notamment l'édification d'une clôture sur tout son pourtour délimitant ainsi la zone archéologique protégée de ce qui ne l'est désormais plus, et restreignant son accès.\nLe site étant très touristique, il est parcouru par des millions de touristes chaque année. La visite est de plus en plus canalisée afin d'éviter les nombreuses détériorations effectuées par certains touristes, telle l'inscription de leur passage dans la pierre des mastaba et autres vestiges encore visibles. Le service des Antiquités, qui ne peut pas entreprendre de restaurations ni de fouilles de sauvetage d'envergure tant le site est vaste, met de plus en plus d'œuvres d'art à l'abri, empêchant de ce fait leur accès aux touristes.\nLa liberté de circulation et donc de visite du site s'en voit limitée d'année en année. Il est également prévu d'installer des caméras sur tout le site afin de surveiller les visiteurs, mais également les pilleurs d'antiquités qui se dissimulent parmi les touristes du plateau de Gizeh afin de voler des statues et autres vestiges, d'une grande valeur sur le marché des antiquités. Certains ont été rattrapés et condamnés à des peines allant jusqu'à vingt ans de prison ferme.\nPour limiter les dégradations des pyramides causées par le gaz carbonique rejeté par les visiteurs, des systèmes de ventilation ont été installés et une pyramide sur trois est fermée à tour de rôle chaque année afin que le monument se « repose ».\nEnfin le nouveau projet d'aménagement du site prévoit deux entrées distinctes.

      "content": "## Overview\nPicture yourself in Egypt and you picture this. Imagine Ancient Egypt and this is where your mind will land. Here is Giza, the city just west of Cairo, where on a desert plateau stand the Pyramids, Sphinx and royal tombs of the pharaohs.\n\n## Understand\nEverything west of the Nile's eastern bank is actually in the City of Giza (الجيزة el-Gīza) rather than the City of Cairo. It's a huge conurbation that includes the Nile islands of Gezira and Roda, the riverside neighbourhoods of Dokki and Mohandeseen, and mile after mile of tatty low-rise and 'burbs. Giza plus Cairo and three other townships make up the Greater Cairo Metropolis. But of course the top sight is the UNESCO World Heritage site Pyramids of Giza, at the western edge of the city, in the \"Haram\" district. The Grand Egyptian Museum has started its trial phase already and is open to visitors. This means that Giza is developing into a tourist base in its own right, especially along the main axis of the Haram or Pyramids Road.\nIt's difficult now to imagine this place 100 years ago, with early tourists arriving by carriage along unpaved roads through the fields. The vast, grubby metropolis now sprawls right to the foot of the pyramids complex. Fortunately, development has been prevented (or removed) on the plateau, so the pyramids still stand proud in an arid expanse. A low ridge cuts the view to the south & west so it feels like the threshold of the Sahara, not just a sandy park or anti-oasis in the midst of burbs and more burbs. To the southeast, the pyramids of Abusir and Saqqara shimmer in the distance.\nLots of countries have ancient pyramids: Mexico, Indonesia, Greece, Sudan, Iran. Egypt has at least 135, with perhaps more undiscovered, but Sudan has about 240. The three main Pyramids in Giza are the focal point of the Giza necropolis, or cemetery, that served the elite of the Old Kingdom capital at nearby Memphis in the 2500s BCE. Three pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty were buried here, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, along with members of their royal household. They chose it, west of Memphis, because west was the direction of the afterlife.\nThe new pyramids were magnificent, but they were something of a giveaway to tomb-robbers. Later pharaohs preferred hidden tombs, such as those in the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor. (So it's from these hidden tombs that most Egyptian mummies and artifacts have been recovered.) All the pyramids fell into disrepair, were repeatedly breached by robbers, and their stone cladding was pilfered for building. Wind and rain have whittled them down. However, they're still magnificent.\nAnother magnificent thing about the pyramids is their age: when the Great Pyramids were being constructed, mammoths still roamed Siberia and North America. Forty-two centuries (4200 years) have seen these pyramids stand tall and proud over the cities of the Nile delta.\n\n## Get in\nWhen seeking transport, ask for \"Haram\" and shape your hands like a pyramid by making an upside down Vicory sign with your index and middle finger: people, especially minibus drivers will know where you want to go. Also, see Egypt#By metro or Egypt#By train for more details.\nIn Summer 2025 the gates the the park were reconfigured. The Mena Gate that you could enter from the east was closed. A new main gate was established to the south of the park that has a higher capacity but requires you to take a shuttle bus or a long walk through the park get to what you want to see. There is a sneaky subgate, at the southeast of the park, near the sphinx, which is normally used as an exit but where you can also buy tickets (the ticket office is in an alleyway on the right of the gate), and here you'll enter almost right under the sphinx.\n\n## By plane\nSphinx International Airport (SPX  IATA) near Giza opened in 2020 and as of 2025 has flights with Wizzair from the UK, UAE and various other points in Europe.\n\n## By train\nThe main railway line between Cairo and Luxor/Aswan runs through Giza, where most services halt, so you can travel along the Nile valley without backtracking via downtown Cairo. Indeed some seasonal sleeper trains start from Giza rather than Cairo Ramses station.\n30.00595131.2079651 El Giza railway station, Al Omraneyah Ash Sharqeyah, Al Omraneyah.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## By taxi\nGet an Uber or InDrive to the pyramids. From anywhere in Cairo it won't cost you more than LE150.\nAll the standard warnings about Cairo taxis (see Cairo#By taxi) apply with even greater force around this prime tourist spot. So many tourists, so many of them unwary or jet-lagged, let's fleece these lambs! And it's remarkable how swiftly a \"broken\" taxi meter is restored to life once the driver sees you're serious about bailing out. Taxi drivers may pressure you to see the pyramid complex on horseback, and take you to their friend's stable, but the site is walkable (only a few kilometers across in any direction, maybe 10 km² in area total).\nThe taxi should be able to take you right to the pyramids entrance gate at the very end of the avenue, whereas buses and other vehicles must stop about 500 m short of there. Coming back, taxis will be waiting around the exit gate near the Sphinx.\n\n## By metro/bus\nTake the metro to the Giza metro station. From near there, frequent buses and microbuses run west towards the pyramids, for a fare of LE7. Listen out for conductors shouting \"Haram!\" or look for route numbers 355 or 357. Many of these buses, along with routes 900 and 997, start from central Cairo: look for them around Midan Tahrir. A bus from downtown will be a slow, bumpy experience, as Giza town traffic is just as congested as central Cairo traffic, so use the Metro to get to Giza station and take the microbus from there.\nAs of 2025, the metro is being extended towards the pyramids and the entire road is a construction project, so it can be somewhat of a maze to find the buses and minibuses that can take you toward the pyramids. Don't ask around at the metro station; people will try to hustle you. Instead just point yourself in the direction of the main east-west road and once you find the road walk west until you see minibuses or people waiting impatiently for one. Once you find local Egyptians uninterested in your visit to the pyramids they'll typically be kind and helpful.\nBuses and microbuses can only run to within 500m of the old Mena Gate, then they must either turn back or turn off North into the burbs. However, the Mena Gate was closed in 2025, and you need to exit at the intersection where your ride deviates from its western course. Do not walk west to the Mena Gate, lest you want to finally hear taxi drivers telling you the truth that something is closed. Instead, you must walk south for about 25 minutes (if it's hot, consider the wisdom of this) to head to the subgate that is normally used as an exit near the sphinx. Surprisingly, you can buy tickets here as well, and in fact this is a much quicker way to get to the pyramids and the sphinx than using the new main gate further on.\n\n## Pyramids\nSee also Giza with children article for practical suggestions.\nThe pyramids and associated sites are on the plateau 8 km west of Giza downtown. You'll see them looming up as you approach along Al-Haram Road. You can enter the complex by the main gate at the western terminus of that road. You'll then progress anti-clockwise through the site, eventually to exit near the Sphinx. Alternativelly, you can buy a ticket and enter near the Sphinx; however, in that case, you'll walk up the hill. Both entrances can also be used as exits.\nIgnore the nay-sayers who say this place is not worth the bother: it definitely is. It's spacious and absorbs the crowds (which are greater on Friday when Egyptians come to visit on droves.) The standard advice is to come very early to beat the crowds, who will arrive fairly soon after you. If you come in the cool months the midday sun is not hot, albeit still strong on UV. What's less obvious is whether the pyramid interiors are worth it, and you do need to come early for those. The extra admission is not too cheap and the interiors are hot, humid, cramped, claustrophobic and lacking \"atmosphere\" in any sense. The passages are steep, dusty and hard to move through, and those with any heart or lung or musculo-skeletal limitations will be miserable at best.\nIn good weather, the site is walkable if you're moderately fit -- there is no need for a camel or horse ride, and some people express concern about the way the animals are treated. You can also walk out to the west of the pyramids for a great panorama. In the heat of the summer, you may feel differently.\nIn all cases, most hustlers give up if you just wave them off with your hand and smile saying \"Thank you\". Avoid any further conversation and/or help or photos!\nThe complex is open daily 07:00-17:00 (and winter until 16:00). Individual sites within the complex may close earlier.\nEntry fees for foreigners (as of October 2024), students get 50% discount:\nGeneral admission to the complex: LE540\nEntrance to the Great (Khufu/Cheops) Pyramid : LE900\nEntrance to the Pyramid of Khafre or Menkaure: LE220\nEntrance to the Tomb of Mars Ankh: LE120\nEntrance to the Tombs of the Laborers: LE700\nAll these tickets can be bought at 29.9816231.132431 the main entrance, at the 29.9754531.1407912 Eastern entrance as well as at the entrances to the sites (but it is recommended to use the first two mentioned). Never surrender your ticket: the entrance guards will tear it and give it back to you. Anything else is a scam or a hustle.\nThe Great Pyramid interior is always open, while access to Khafre and Menkaure pyramid interiors alternates each year. Limited numbers of these extra tickets are available each day, so by mid-morning they might be all gone; there isn't a pre-booking system. No cameras are allowed into the pyramids.\n29.97972231.1344441 Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops). 8AM-noon, 1-4PM. The oldest, the largest in Egypt, and the last surviving representative of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built to a height of 146 m (479 ft), but is now slightly reduced to a still towering 137 m (449 ft). Over 2 million blocks of stone were used to construct it, all through manual labour. Entry to the interior is on the north side, facing your approach. LE900.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97160931.1278352 Queens' Pyramids and Nobles' Tombs. All over the complex, but especially around the Great Pyramid, are various of these pyramids and tombs. On its eastern flank, you'll find the burial pits for his \"solar boats\", to carry him into the afterlife. Along the west flank are noblemen's tombs, such as those of Senegemib. Several of these tombs are open to visit and usually free of tourist hordes. There's no extra charge though baksheesh may be appreciated. Enjoy the peace and quiet in the shade of one of the Queen's pyramids along the south flank of Menkaure's Pyramid to take a little break from the hustle on the plateau.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97631.1309723 Pyramid of Khafre (Pyramid of Chephren). Khafre was the son and successor of Khufu. His pyramid (at 136 m) is slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid, but it's set on higher ground so it looks larger. A few blocks of the original limestone cladding survive at its tip; once all the pyramids were fully encased in this way. Entry to the interior is on the north flank.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.972531.1283334 Pyramid of Menkaure. Menkaure was probably the son and successor of Khafre. His pyramid is the smallest here at 62 m high, originally 66.5 m. Entry to the interior is on the north flank. Along the south flank are his Queens' pyramids, and on the east flank is his funerary temple. LE220.      (updated Oct 2024)\nAncient causeways link the Khafre and Menkaure pyramids to the necropolis entrance gate next to the Sphinx. At the foot of each is another small temple dedicated to that pharaoh. The causeways are rough going so you may prefer to loop back along the paved driveway. The horse and camel-drivers will now be getting a bit desperate as you approach the exit, and will drop their prices; keep walking.\n29.9752731.137685 Great Sphinx of Giza. Like pyramids, sphinxes (ancient and modern) are found in many lands; this one is specifically the Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a single block of sandstone 45 m long by 22 m wide, bearing a man's head upon a lion's haunches. It is understood, by mainstream archeologists, to have been carved out of the bedrock in the reign of Khafre, bears his likeness, and represents a guardian spirit of the necropolis. Its original name is unknown but it was variously dubbed \"Horus of the horizon\" for the sun god or Abu el-Hol (\"Father of Terror\"). We know it by its Greek name Sphinx, which may mean \"strangler\" (as a lion crushes the neck of its prey, or the fate of those who failed to answer its riddles), or may simply mean \"carved from living rock\". Being solid, it has no inner passageways.It's a frankly mangy-looking lion and its face has always presented an irresistible target. The nose was hacked off by the 15th-century but each successive wave of rulers has blamed the previous lot: 20th-century Egyptians blamed the Brits who blamed Napoleonic troops who blamed the Ottoman Turks. The broken-off regal beard is now in the British Museum.The Sphinx faces east and you approach it, nearing the exit gate, along its north flank. This means that its main features will be in shade, you need morning light for a good photo. (Unlike the pyramids, always with one flank upturned to the sun and the deified Khufu.) To get closer you can pay extra for the enclosure just in front of its paws. There's little point in doing so, the place is crowded with people taking silly selfies, and the slightly closer view just emphasises the manginess.      (updated Oct 2024)\n\n## Grand Egyptian Museum\n29.99361131.1197226 Grand Egyptian Museum (المتحف المصري الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Miṣriyy al-Kabīr), El Remayah Square, Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, Giza (2 km northwest of the Pyramids), ☏ +20 235317344, tourism_info@easwaaqmisr.com. 09:00-17:00. The Grand Egyptian Museum is the long-awaited primary replacement for the venerable Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir, with much bigger exhibition, storage and workplace areas. It was formally opened on 1 November 2025. LE1200.      (updated Aug 2025)\n\n## At the pyramids\nBefore you get on the back of a camel or horse have a look at how they treat their animals. You might change your mind. If you anyway decide to take the offer of one of the horsemen or camel guys, make sure you discuss the price and where you go first. Ask to confirm it covers two people/two horses. Negotiate the price you want. At the end of the trip, when you get back to where you had agreed, get off the horse/camel, hand the man the agreed money and walk away. They will try to come up with all sorts of scams to get more money out of you. If you are happy and wish to give a tip, do it because you choose. Don't feel pressured into giving extra. Just walk away. They won't follow you.\nCamel rides. Avoid succumbing to the temptation of taking a camel ride around the Pyramids, if you can, the practice is noisy, smelly and overrated. Basically, there are many better places in Egypt to take a camel ride, if you must. Things are a little better run than they used to be, and the practice of taking tourists out into the desert and refusing to return unless \"tipped\" is rather rare now.\nGo horse riding in the desert to experience the spirit of the Egyptian horses and the true majesty of the Pyramids seen from outside the 'circus ring' wall. Be careful of touts, however; it's best to ride from one of the better quality stables, like FB Stables or Cairo Horse Riding School. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield on a half day trip to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out overnight with a barbecue and fire. You can also watch the Sound and Light show from FB's rooftop terrace. If you do ride with a tout (they will encourage you to do this if the area is closed for entry for example) they will make out that you will have a great view of the pyramids (which you won't), they will then charge you a fortune, ride at high speed through the streets without a helmet or any regard for safety, they will then demand a tip as you ride back and try to take you to a 'museum' which is a just shop where you will be pressured to buy.\nSee the sunrise, the first sun beams colouring the Pyramids from the terrace on the third floor of a cafe or from the roof terrace of the hostel situated near the second western entrance and ticket-office.\n[dead link] Cairo Horse Riding School, Mansouriya Road (Ext 31 Maadi Ring Road), ☏ +20 1207362425. This expat-run stable is situated inside a pristine Arabian horse ranch about ten minutes away from the Pyramids. The emphasis is on compassionate horsemanship and most of their school horses are rescues from the pyramid area which they have lovingly rehabilitated. They offer rides in the peaceful parts of the Giza desert and along countryside lanes, and longer rides to the Abu Sir Pyramid complex or jumping and dressage lessons inside their arena. (updated Mar 2017)\nFB Stables, Gamal Abdul Nasser St, Sphinx (turn left after the sphinx KFC, then right in Gamal Abdul Nasser Street -- FB is the last stables on the left), ☏ +20 106 507 0288. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, Karim at FB Stables is also great for a \"tourist\" type ride to view the Pyramids and Sphinx from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Sir can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and moonlit rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivalled views over the Pyramids: a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light shows. Great horses, and no beating.\n29.9746531.139511 [dead link] Pyramids Sound and Light Show (Son-et-Lumière) (entrance is by the Sphinx gate (i.e. the pyramids exit)), info@soundandlight.com.eg. Daily 7PM in English, 8PM in another language. Distinctly kitsch but a fun evening if you're in the right mood. The \"voice of the Sphinx\" narrates (often inaccurately) the history of the Giza necropolis and its place in Egyptian history, while a laser display picks out details of the Pyramids and projects scenes onto the side of the Great Pyramid. There are two shows each evening, the first in English and the second in another European language: free headphone translations are available if you're in the \"wrong\" show. In busier times there is a third show, but nowadays this is just (not Fridays) for special bookings, with other languages available. Bring warm clothing. The same company puts on very similar sound & light shows at Luxor-Karnak, Edfu and Philae. You could watch the whole thing cheaper, and almost as well, by eating at Pizza Hut opposite and paying a baksheesh to sit on the terrace. LE130.    (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Elsewhere\n30.0238831.214452 Giza Zoo. The main zoo of Greater Cairo, founded in 1891. 2 km NE of Giza metro station but near the riverside, so if you're coming from downtown especially with children, it's easier to take a taxi. This is an old-fashioned zoo with a poor record for safety and animal welfare.      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.98331.137613 Mena House Oberoi Golf Course (In front of the pyramids).    (updated Dec 2018)\n30.02953431.2140344 Orman Botanical Garden (in front of the Giza Zoo). 9AM–4PM. LE5 per person and LE20 per car.    (updated Dec 2018)\n29.99717131.2151335 Pharaonic Village. 9AM–7PM. Advertised as \"the living museum of Egyptian history, with replicas of an ancient village & the tomb of Tutankhamen.\" Actors dressed as ancient Egyptians play various scenes. Not very authentic, but can be interesting for kids. It has several museums and lots of souvenir shops.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Buy\nAl Amir Perfume Palace, 9 Abu el Houl St., ☏ +20 2 385 4963. An overwhelming smell will hit you as soon as you walk inside, if you can stand the smell for more than a few minutes you can find some good deals on perfume.\nLegends and Legacies, 20 Abuu Hazim St. (Off of Pyramid Road). A relaxed indoor bazaar.\nBeymen, FourSeasons Nile Plaza. Chic designer shopping including brands such Chanel, Prada, Gucci, and Christian Dior.\n\n## Eat\nWestern fast food options are located opposite the main ticket gates to the Pyramid enclosure, Pizza Hut and KFC included, so you can munch on a Tower burger and sip on a Coke in air-conditioned comfort whilst gazing on the more than 4,000-year-old Sphinx across the road. Many may prefer a more authentic experience, although the novelty of the situation could be interesting.\n\n## Budget\n29.97759931.1427981 El Gizawy restaurant, Nazlet El-Semman, Al Haram. At the pyramids entrance where the homestays are. Local specialties. The staff speaks sufficiently good English. Popular with the locals. Falafel for LE7, Egyptian pasta for LE25.    (updated Dec 2022)\n\n## Splurge\n29.98555631.1327782 Marriott Mena House, 6 Pyramids Road, ☏ +20 2 3833222. Built in 1869 as a royal lodge for King Ismail the Magnificent, this magnificent palace has housed guests including Empress Eugenie and Prince Albert. Tastefully restored and located very close to the Pyramids. Rooms in the newer Garden wing from US$150, Palace wing rooms from $210; be sure to ask for a room with a view of the Pyramids. The main Pyramids gate is a 5-minute walk away.      (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Drink\nSince Egypt is a Muslim country, alcohol is not generally permitted. It will generally only be served in hotels.\nYou might find more options in Gezira neighborhood.\n29.99061131.1343031 El Mandara Coffee Shop, Abou Al Mohsen (close to Pyramids). Local cafe with Hookahs and non-alcoholic drinks, black tea and Egyptian coffee, frequented by locals, inside and streetside sitting. LE3-10.    (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are a number of 29.97591531.1414771 accommodations near the entrance to the pyramids. You gonna find hotels, homestays and hostels, many of them with a pyramid view. A good area to stay is around the street Abou Al Hool Al Seiahi. There you find touristy and non-touristy restaurants and grocery stores around.\n\n## Cope\nDecent toilets are next to the ticket office and inside the boat museum (if you have that ticket). From the main entrance, you enter the complex and ascend the driveway towards the Great Pyramid, suitably awe-inspired, and muttering a continual \"lah shukran, lah shukran\" to dismiss the touts, guides, and offers of camels. If you do fancy a ride, see \"Do\" below.\n\n## Stay safe\nClimbing the Pyramids is dangerous and strictly illegal. It adds to wear and tear on the structure, and any stumble is likely to prove fatal. Also, it's hard gritty work and not nearly as cool as you'd imagined, so don't think about it.\nThe Giza Pyramids, being the main tourist attraction in Egypt, attract millions of tourists each year. They likewise attract a large number of the most determined opportunists for miles around. Report any instances of harassment by camel drivers and tourist touts to the black-uniformed (or white-uniformed in the summer) Tourist Police immediately, and be prepared for all manner of potential scams, possibly including \"advice\" from official-looking individuals that an attraction is closed or has an alternate entrance. Also be aware that any \"favour\" of any kind (offering directions, being shown something, etc.) might be done in expectation of a tip, so be cautious when accepting unsolicited help (although don't let your holiday be spoiled by overzealous caution, you also might encounter genuine help). Also note that some Tourist Police might routinely offer to help you in the expectation of a tip. Many known scammers will operate in front of the tourist police, who are either in on it or don't bother to intervene.\nIf on your own, headphones make the incessant \"Hello, where are you from my friend\" conversation-starters easier to ignore, smiling and pointing at the headphones seems to do the trick.\nAvoid making eye contact, starting conversations or accepting any help with taking pictures or posing for pictures for you: they will see you as an easy target for harassment.\nSay \"La Shukran\" (No thanks) as you do this, it shows you know a bit more than the average tourist and will not be seen as aggressive or rude. Smiling as you say it doesn't hurt as it doesn't seem to be seen as an invite to talk, but shows you are not trying to offend.\nBe cautious when choosing a local horse or camel ride; you may be ripped off or put in dangerous situations. The \"donkey-mafia\" that operate by the doors of the main entrance will adopt the most \"persuasive\" and often bullish techniques to get you onto their animals, and they do not appear to understand the meaning of the word \"No\". They will cause such a scene when you say no and have to get off them, which will result in you having to pay for the privilege of refusing their hospitality. Note: Some of these people were involved in the Battle of the Camels during the revolution, in which innocent civilians were killed. Use as your conscience dictates.\nAs anywhere else in Egypt, in hot months especially, take plenty of bottled water with you, wear a hat and wear sunscreen—sunglasses are also definitely a good idea.\n\n## Go next\nCairo/Downtown – where you can see the Egyptian Museum, Cairo Tower, El-Cornish, sail in Nile Cruise, hotels, restaurants, etc. Then you can go to El-Moez St., El-Hussain area, Khan El-Khalili, and Old Cairo Churches. From near the entrance of the pyramids area, take the 29.97736731.142762 city bus line 2001 to the Giza metro station or any microbus going the same way. In Google Maps, the bus stop at the pyramids is called \"bus terminal\". From the Giza station the metro brings you to Downtown cairo. Neither that city bus nor the metro have A/C, so it's just a good option in winter time. In other seasons it's better to take an Uber/Careem.",
