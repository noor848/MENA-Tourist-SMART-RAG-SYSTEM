      "content": "The Siwa Oasis (Arabic: واحة سيوة Wāḥat Sīwah [ˈwæːħet ˈsiːwæ]) is an urban oasis in Egypt. It is situated between the Qattara Depression and the Great Sand Sea in the Western Desert, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of the Egypt–Libya border and 560 kilometres (350 mi) from the Egyptian capital city of Cairo. It is famed from its role in ancient Egypt as the home to an oracle of Amun, the ruins of which are a popular tourist attraction, giving it the ancient name Oasis of Amun-Ra, after the major Egyptian deity.\n\nGeography\nThe oasis is in a deep depression that reaches −19 metres (−62 ft) below sea level. To the west, the al Jaghbub Oasis rests in a similar depression and to the east, the large Qattara Depression is also below sea level. The depression is fertile due to both natural flowing artesian wells and irrigation. It is the site of about 200 natural springs. Siwa is directly adjacent to the Libyan Desert plateau. The geology is characterised by horizontal layers of porous limestones alternated with marls and clays dating back to the Miocene. The limestone plateau and inselbergs resulting from the oasis' erosion along the dunes create reliefs that the Isiwan describe as mountains (adrar in Tamizight). Two large salt lakes are fed by drainage water of agricultural origin. The oasis supports the cultivation of thousands of date palms and olives. Siwa has a temperate desert climate.\n\nName\nThe Ancient Egyptian name of the oasis was sḫt jꜣmw, meaning \"Field of Trees\". The native Libyan toponym may be preserved in the Egyptian t̠ꜣ(j) n d̠rw \"tꜣj on the fringe\" where t̠ꜣ transcribed the local Palaeo-Berber name *Se or *Sa. This name survived in the works of Muslim geographers as سنترية Santariyyah. \nSiwah is the Arabic name of the oasis called Sali in Berber. The oasis is also called Isiwan in modern Berber. \nThe etymology of the word سيوة Siwah is unclear. Champollion derives it from Coptic ⲥⲟⲟⲩϩ (soouh) – a corruption of Egyptian word for \"oasis\", ⲟⲩⲁϩ (ouoh). The additional evidence of the Egyptian source of Siwa's name is another place name in Kharga Oasis that may share the same etymology – S.t-wȝḥ, modern Deir el-Hagar). Basset links it to a Berber tribal name swh attested further west in the early Islamic period, while Ilahiane, following Chafik, links it to the Shilha Berber word asiwan, a type of bird of prey, and hence to Amun-Ra, one of whose symbols was the falcon. Some classical authors referred to the site as \"Ammonium\".\n\nHistory\nAlthough the site is known to have been settled since at least the 10th millennium BCE, the earliest evidence of any connection with Ancient Egypt is the 26th Dynasty, when a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BCE), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: Zeus Ammon), who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. Herodotus knew of a \"fountain of the Sun\" that ran coldest in the noontime heat. During his campaign to conquer the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert. The oracle, Alexander's court historians alleged, confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt, though Alexander's motives in making the excursion, following his founding of Alexandria, remain to some extent inscrutable and contested. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its Ancient Egyptian name was sḫ.t-ỉm3w, meaning \"Field of Trees\".\nIn the 12th century, Al-Idrisi mentions it as being inhabited mainly by Berbers, with an Arab minority; a century before Al-Bakri stated that only Berbers lived there. The Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi traveled to Siwa in the 15th century and described how the language spoken there 'is similar to the language of the Zenata'.\nThe first European to document a visit since Roman times was the English traveler William George Browne, who came in 1792 to see the ancient temple of the Oracle of Amun. Bompiani, in her description of the 19th-century explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti, called this site the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon.\nSiwa was annexed by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1820, but the Egyptian representative in Siwa was assassinated in 1838. At some point, Muhammad al-Sanusi stayed at Siwa for a few months and gathered some followers there. Later, Siwa was a base of the Sanusiyya in their fight against the British from 1915 to 1917. Meanwhile, in the spring of 1893, German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt took photographs of the architecture of the town of Siwa, now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.\nEgyptian rule from distant Cairo was at first tenuous and marked by several revolts. Egypt began to assert firmer control after a 1928 visit to the oasis by King Fuad I, who berated the locals for homosexual practices and specified punishments to bring Siwan behaviour in line with Egyptian morals.\nSiwa was also the site of some fighting during World War I and World War II. The British Army's Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was based here, but Rommel's Afrika Korps also took possession three times. German soldiers went skinny dipping in the lake of the oracle, contrary to local customs which prohibit public nudity. In 1942, while the Italian 136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti occupied the oasis, a tiny Egyptian puppet government-in-exile was set up at Siwa. The oasis makes a brief appearance as a base of the LRDG in the 1958 war film Ice Cold in Alex.\nThe ancient fortress of Siwa, known as the Shali Ghadi (Shali being the name of the town, and Ghadi meaning \"remote\"), was built on natural rock (an inselberg) and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926 it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it, and in some cases those, in turn, have been replaced by more modern cinder block and sheet metal roof buildings. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights. It is most easily approached from its southwest side, south of the end of the paved road which curves around from the north side of the Shali. Several uneven pedestrian streets lead from the southwest end of the Shali into it, and the ground is rent in places by deep cracks. Many of the unreinforced kershif buildings bordering the streets of the Shali are also split by large cracks, or they are partially collapsed.\nOther local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs; and \"Cleopatra's Bath\", an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BCE, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi. The revelations of the oracle fell into disrepute under the Roman occupation of Egypt.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.\n\nCulture\nThe traditional culture of Siwa shows many unique elements, some reflecting its longstanding links with the isolated oasis life and the fact that the inhabitants are Siwi Berbers. There are 10 tribes in Siwa that speak an eastern Berber language (Siwi). These tribes have their own cultures and ideals. Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa's only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca.\n\nAs a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies. These pieces were decorated with symbols which related to Siwa's history and beliefs and attitudes.\nThe best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called 'adrim' and a round necklace, called 'aghraw', from which it hung over the breast. A girl would give up the disc at a special ceremony in the spring the day she was married. The jewelry, which was made by local silversmiths, consisted of silver necklaces, earrings, bangles, hair ornaments, pendants, and many rings. For a wealthy woman, the full ensemble could weigh as much as five or six kilos. These pieces are decorated with symbols common to Berber people across North Africa designed to promote good health, fertility and to protect the wearer from misfortune. Some of the same signs and patterns are found on the embroidery which embellishes women's dresses, trousers, and shawls.\n\nArt and local customs\nThe arrival of the road and of television exposed the oasis to the styles and fashions of the outside world and the traditional silver ornaments were gradually replaced by jewelry made of gold. Evidence of the old styles and traditions are however still in evidence in the women's embroidery and costume. The material for the \"tarfutet\", the distinctive all-enveloping shawl worn by women, are brought from outside the oasis, specifically from the town of Kirdasa, in the Giza Governorate.\n\nFestivals\nSiwi people are very religious so on Ramadan, they tend to close all the shops and stay at home for the whole month. Like other Muslim Egyptians, Siwis celebrate Eid al-Fitr (lʕid ahakkik,\"the Little Eid\") and Eid al-Adha (lʕid azuwwar,\"the Big Eid\"). Unlike other Egyptians, however, on Eid al-Adha Siwis cook the skin of the sheep (along with its innards) as a festival delicacy, after removing the hair. They also eat heart of palm (agroz).\nThe Siyaha Festival (Eid El Solh–Eid El Hasad), in honour of the town's traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa (the name is often misunderstood as a reference to \"tourism\", but in fact predates tourism). It is known that on this occasion Siwi men meet on a mountain near the town, Gabal Al–Dakrour, to eat together, sing chants while thanking God, and reconcile with one another; all Siwi houses co-operate in preparing and cooking food, in this day Siwian people eat fattah (rice, toasted bread and meat), after Dohr prayer (12:00 PM) all Siwian youth gather to set the banquet, nobody is allowed to eat before the caller announces to start eating so they can all eat together, the women stay behind in the village, and celebrate with dancing, singing, and drums. The food for the festival is bought collectively, with funds gathered by the oasis' mosques, celebrations last for 3 Qamari days, and in the early morning of the fourth day, siwian men form a big march, while holding flags and singing spiritual songs. The march starts from Gabal El – Dakrour and ends in Sidi Solayman square – in the center of Siwa – declaring ending of festivals, and beginning of a new year without hatred or grudge, and with love, respect and reconciliation.\nSiwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults' celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.\n\nRelations with the Bedouins\nSiwans are preferentially endogamous, only rarely marrying non-Siwans. Nonetheless, Bedouin brides command a higher brideprice in Siwa than Siwan ones.\nAccording to older members of the Awlad Ali Bedouins, the Bedouin relations with Siwans were traditionally mediated through a system of \"friendship\", whereby a specific Siwan (and his descendants) would be the friend of a specific Bedouin (and his descendants). The Bedouin would stay at the Siwan's house when he came to Siwa, and would exchange his animal products and grain for the Siwan's dates and olive oil.\nSiwa's Berbers are close to 30,000 in number.\nThe hot springs are an attraction to visitors.\n\nRole of women\nWomen have traditionally played a prominent role in Siwan households, often being in charge of a household's financial decisions. They have also been responsible for raising children; the town's deputy mayor said in 1985, \"If our children speak Siwi, it to our womenfolk that they owe it.\"\n\nSiwan pederastic tradition\nSiwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of intergenerational male homosexuality and rituals celebrating same-sex marriage – traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century.\nThe German Egyptologist Georg Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that pederastic relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage: \"The feast of marrying a boy was celebrated with great pomp, and the money paid for a boy sometimes amounted to fifteen pounds, while the money paid for a woman was a little over one pound.\" Mahmud Mohammad Abd Allah, writing of Siwan customs for the Harvard Peabody Museum in 1917, commented that although Siwan men could take up to four wives, \"Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.\"\nIn 1937, the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: \"All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy...among themselves the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition....Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks' sons....Most of the boys used in sodomy are between 12 and 18 years of age.\" After an expedition to Siwa, the archaeologist Count Byron de Prorok reported in 1937 \"an enthusiasm [that] could not have been approached even in Sodom... Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging...Every dancer had his boyfriend...[and] chiefs had harems of boys\".\nIn the late 1940s, a Siwan merchant told the visiting British novelist Robin Maugham that the Siwan women were \"badly neglected\", but that Siwan men \"will kill each other for boy. Never for a woman\", although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who studied Siwa for three decades, observed in 1973 that \"While the Siwans were still living inside their walled town, none of these bachelors was allowed to spend the night in the town and had to sleep outside the gates...Under such circumstances it is not surprising that homosexuality was common among them....Up to the year 1928, it was not unusual that some kind of written agreement, which was sometimes called a marriage contract, was made between two males; but since the visit of King Fu'ad to this oasis it has been completely forbidden...However, such agreements continued, but in great secrecy, and without the actual writing, until the end of World War II. Now the practice is not followed.\"\nDespite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. When the Siwa-born anthropologist Fathi Malim included reference to Siwan homosexuality (especially a love poem from a man to a youth) in his book Oasis Siwa (2001), the tribal council demanded that he blank out the material in the current edition of the book and remove it from future editions, or be expelled from the community. Malim reluctantly agreed and physically deleted the passages in the first edition of his book, and excluded them from the second. A newer book, Siwa Past and Present (2005) by A. Dumairy, the Director of Siwa Antiquities, omits all mention of the famous historical practices of the inhabitants.\n\nPeople\nAbout 80 km (50 mi) in length and 20 km (12 mi) wide, Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt's most isolated settlements, with about 25,000 people, mostly Siwi Berbers (Siwi: Isiwan. The municipality hosts the easternmost Berber-speaking community, whose language, called Siwi (Jlan n Isiwan), shares many linguistic features with the languages of Sokna and El Foqaha in Libya, partially also with the Zenati group, and which has been heavily influenced by Arabic.\nWhile the majority of the population of Siwa is Berber, the oasis is also home to a Bedouin community related to the Awlad Ali, the Shahibaat, as well as to a growing number of other Egyptian settlers. Currently, the entire population of the oasis speaks Arabic as either a first or a second language. The Siwi Berber population is also fluent in Egyptian Arabic, which is called Masri \"Egyptian\".\n\nEconomy\nSiwa has been noted for its dates since ancient times, and today date palm cultivation is by far the largest component of its economy. In a distant second place, with about one-fifth of the scale as dates, is olive cultivation. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.\nTourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income. Much attention has been given to creating hotels that use local materials and display local styles.\n\nArchaeology\nIn the mid-20th century, Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry worked at Siwa (and elsewhere in the Western Desert).\nIn 1995, Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced that she had identified the tomb of Alexander the Great in the oasis of Siwa. She made the following statement to the Greek media:\n\nBut I am speaking to every Greek all over the world. I want every one of you to feel proud because Greek hands have found this very important monument.\n\nThis statement was an answer to the, at the time, Greek prime minister Costas Simitis who urged the archaeologists to stop their research in Egypt and sent a Greek Embassy advisor to ask the Egyptian government to withdraw Mrs Souvaltzi’s permission to excavate in the area. The case is still active in the Greek courts of law.\nAn extremely old hominid footprint was discovered in 2007 at Siwa Oasis. Egyptian scientists claimed it could be 2–3 million years old, which would make it the oldest fossilized hominid footprint ever found. However, no proof of this conjecture was ever presented.\nIn late 2013, an announcement was made regarding the apparent archaeoastronomy discovery of precise spring and fall equinox sunrise alignments over the Aghurmi mound/Amun Oracle when viewed from Timasirayn temple in the Western Desert, 12 km away across Lake Siwa. The first known recent public viewing of this event occurred on March 21, 2014, during the spring equinox.\n\nIn popular culture\nSiwa Oasis is an official map for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory which belongs to North Africa Campaign. The fifth mission from the game Sniper Elite III takes place on the Siwa Oasis. Siwa is prominently featured in the videogame Assassin's Creed: Origins and is the birthplace and home of the protagonist Bayek of Siwa. In British author Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, the ninth and eleventh instalments Scorpia Rising and Never Say Die feature Siwa. In Australian author Matthew Reilly's Jack West series of seven novels starting with Seven Ancient Wonders feature prominently the Oracle of Siwa.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBattesti, Vincent (2006).

      "content": "## Overview\nSiwa is an oasis and town in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is the most remote of Egypt's five western oases. The oasis is 80 km long by 20 km wide, with a population in 2016 of some 33,000. It has a scattering of villages but only one large settlement, here referred to as \"Siwa town\" for clarity. Its main sight is the Temple of the Oracle, which even Alexander the Great came to visit.\n\n## Understand\nSiwa is in a great depression in the Sahara, so although it is 300 km from the Mediterranean coast at Marsa Matruh, it lies at sea-level or even a few metres below. This brings it close to a great aquifer of sandstone and limestone, containing \"fossil water\" - rain that fell 40,000 years ago. All the oasis water comes from this non-renewable resource. The depression was scoured out by wind-blown sand and salt, and the water is only usable if it is not salty. Most of Siwa's water is salty and the town is surrounded by large bitter lakes, which support wildlife (eg migratory birds, which gorge on the insects and grubs) but not agriculture. Wells nowadays have to drill down 300 m to access fresh water, so the area remains fertile but its development is constrained - tourist hotels are notoriously profligate users of water. Siwa's aquifer continues across the border into Libya, where it emerges as the Jaghbub oasis. Some 200 km east of Siwa is the even larger and deeper depression of Qattara, where all the water is saline and useless, so it is not an oasis.\nThe inhabitants of Siwa are ethnically Berber and their mother tongue is a Berber language called Siwi. They also speak Egyptian Arabic, and many can speak a little English.\nLike the other western oases, the climate is hot desert, near 40°C summer and 5°C in winter. There is almost zero rainfall.\n\n## Get in\nThere are no flights to Siwa so the only approach is along two very long roads.\n\n## By road\n550 km west of Cairo (but 750 km by either road) or from Alexandria, the best approach is by the coast road to Marsa Matruh, then it is 300 km southwest across the desert to Siwa. This road is asphalt throughout—beware blowing sand. It is a long way with no filling stations though there is a café midway.\nThe other way is to Bahariyya oasis then west across the desert. This road is asphalt. From there a dirt track heads west to Siwa. It is being upgraded and buses previously ran this way, but in 2019 it was closed by the military.\nWest of Siwa is the border with Libya (50 km), which is closed throughout, and south are only the trackless sands of the desert.\n\n## By bus\n29.20525.5191 Siwa main bus stop. You would not call it a station. It is in the broad street outside the police station. Tickets go on sale about 1 hr before the bus departs. Taxis also gather in this area.    (updated Jun 2020)\nCairo – Nightly around 8PM from Cairo bus terminal West Delta Bus line and heading back at the same time. 12 hr. LE200 (Jan 2022). This bus can be cold and drafty in the winter.\nMarsa Matruh – At least daily from the coast. 4 hr. You might prefer to take a day-time bus through Marsa Matruh from Cairo.\nBahariyya – In 2019, there was no bus or taxi service, or least foreigners were not allowed along that road.\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi on the Marsa Matruh route might cost LE1,000.\n\n## By bicycle\nBicycles are the best way to explore Siwa and surroundings, and Chinese gear-less models can be rented for LE10 per day (LE5 half day). Before accepting a bike, however, check that it is sturdy, that the brakes are functioning well and that the handle bars are not cracked or bent. Driving on sand-covered streets can be quite a challenge for inexperienced cyclists.\n\n## By donkey cart\nDonkey cart drivers are mostly children who have been riding donkeys for several years. Prices for this mode of transport are negotiable - just make sure the price is clearly agreed before setting off - and run from around LE3 for a short trip within the downtown up to LE30 for longer journeys. To get a few people and their backpacks from the bus station to town center can be as cheap as LE1.50. An afternoon trip to Cleopatra's Well will probably cost about LE20-25.\n\n## See\nSiwa town\nKing Farooq Mosque\nTomb of Sidi Suleiman\n29.2037725.518011 The museum. Sa-Th.

(updated Jun 2020)\n29.20525.5443 Temple of the Oracle (Aghurmi) (Hill of Aghurmi 4 km east of town). The temple, built perhaps in 570 BCE, was dedicated to Amun, the same deity as Zeus or Jupiter / Jove. The priestly oracles pronounced on propositions put to them and in 331 BCE Alexander the Great came to ask if he was the son of Zeus. He sent everyone else out of the room before receiving the answer, and afterwards enough gold was distributed to ensure that the answer was yes as he had claimed. It is called \"leadership\", and thus he legitimised his rule in Egypt. He intended to be buried here but lies in Alexandria at an unknown site. The temple is undecorated except for the Hall of the Sacrament. It never had a tiled roof, but palm trunks were overlain. The area became built over and the temple was lost sight of until rediscovered in 1853. LE50 foreigner, LE25 adult, LE15 student.     (updated Jan 2021)\n29.20168125.5449194 Temple of Umm Ubeida (Umm Ubaydah/Temple of Amun) (400 m south of Temple of the Oracle). This temple was probably built by Nectanebo around 380 BCE. It too was dedicated to Amun, and in the 18—19th century became a decoy: explorers looking for the Temple of the Oracle thought this must be it. They made detailed sketches of its layout and decorations, fortunately, because in 1897 the Ottoman governor decided that the limestone masonry would be much better employed for a new police station, so he blew it up. Only one wall remains and various large fragments. The origin of the present temple name is uncertain, but \"baydah\" means white. free.

Limestone hillock with many rock-cut tombs, mostly from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. The highlight is the group of four tombs on the northeast slope (no photography within). These are the Tomb of Si-Amun with beautifully colored reliefs; the Tomb of Mesu-Isis is little decorated but contains a mummified skull; the Tomb of Per-nj-pa-thot has inscriptions and drawings; and the Tomb of the Crocodile where the wall paintings are deteriorating, but the yellow crocodile is probably the deity Sobek. Adult LE50.     (updated May 2020)\n29.18925.5536 Gebel Darkur (4 km southeast of town). This is a limestone scarp west of town; you can climb it for the view. There are several rock tombs, but they're plain with no inscriptions or decorations. The thing to do here is to have yourself buried in hot sand for 20 minutes, it's supposed to be good for rheumatism. In October there's a village festival here, but it's a Siwa family reunion not a tourist event.     (updated May 2020)\n29.233625.43847 Ain Duheiba.

(updated Jun 2020)\n29.23825.3259 Maraqi (30-35 km west of Siwa). A secondary oasis dotted with rock tombs and scraps of temple ruins, and there is a prehistoric human footprint. The area is fertile, though the lake it surrounds is very salty. Here you are close to the border, so the military may curb your explorations. The aquifer continues northwest under the border to re-emerge at El Jaghbub oasis in Libya.     (updated Jun 2020)\n29.122225.433910 Biʾr Wahid (Well No. 1) (15 km southwest of town).
