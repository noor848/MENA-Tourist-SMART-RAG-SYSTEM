      "content": "Wadi El Natrun (Arabic: وادي النطرون, lit. 'Valley of Natron'; Coptic: Ϣⲓϩⲏⲧ, romanized: Šihēt, lit. 'measure of the hearts') is a depression in northern Egypt that is located 23 m (75 ft) below sea level and 38 m (125 ft) below the Nile River level. The valley contains several alkaline lakes, natron-rich salt deposits, salt marshes and freshwater marshes.\nIn Christian literature it is usually known as Scetis (Σκήτις  in Hellenistic Greek) or  Skete (Σκήτη, plural Σκήτες in ecclesiastical Greek). \nIt is one of the three early Christian monastic centers located in the Nitrian Desert of the northwestern Nile Delta. The other two monastic centers are Nitria and Kellia. Scetis, now called Wadi El Natrun, is best known today because its ancient monasteries remain in use, unlike Nitria and Kellia which have only archaeological remains. The desertified valley around Scetis in particular may be called the Desert of Scetis.\n\nGeography\nWadi al-Natrun is the common name for a desert valley located west of the Nile Delta, along the El Tahrir markaz, which is about 10 km west of the entrance to Sadat City on the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, and about 50 km from Khattabah on the Nile (Rashid Branch), and it falls below the level of the plateau surface surrounding it about 50 meters. The length of this depression ranges between 5, 55 and 60 km, while its average width is 10 km, and its deepest point reaches 24 meters below sea level. The depression is the smallest depression in the Egyptian Western Desert, with an area of about 500 km2. Therefore, it is true that it is a depression and not a valley, because the region is a closed depression that has a beginning and an end, and it has no source, estuary or tributaries, so the launch of the word \"Wadi\" on the depression is not topographically correct.\nThe Wadi contains 12 lakes, the total surface area of which is 10 km square and their average depth is only 2 m. The color of these lakes is reddish blue because its water is saturated with the Natron salt.\n\nHistory\nFossil discoveries\nFossils dating to the Pliocene era (5.3-2.6 million years ago) have been discovered in the Wadi El Natrun region, including the long-snouted crocodile Euthecodon, softshell turtles, the camel Paracamelus, the three toed hipparionine equine Cormohipparion, the primitive hippopotamus Archaeopotamus andrewsi, antelope including reedbuck (Renunca) and Alcelaphinae, and the elephant-relative Deinotherium.\n\nAncient history\nNatron valley is first attested in the story of the Eloquent Peasant, and it is mentioned among the list of seven oases in the Temple of Edfu. In Ptolemaic times it constituted part of the Nitrite nome (Ancient Greek: Νιτριώτης νομός). It was also known in Coptic as Mountain of Salt (Coptic: ⲡⲧⲱⲟⲩ ⲙⲡϩⲙⲟⲩ) or Phanihosem (Coptic: ⲫⲁⲛⲓϩⲟⲥⲉⲙ, lit. 'the one (place) on the natron').\nThe importance of the Natrun valley dates back to the Pharaonic era, as the ancient Egyptians and the Libyans fought many battles there. And this ended up with the Egyptians overcoming them and annexed the eastern side of the desert, which still belongs to Egypt. Then, Wadi al-Natrun became an administrative part of the country in the Pharaonic era, but there is no information about its history during their reign, and the latest writings on the wars between the Libu and the Egyptians indicate that the last of them was in 1170 BC during the reign of Ramesses III.\nAs for the religious significance of Wadi al-Natrun, there are many discoveries that indicate that this area was considered sacred as early as year 2000 BCE at the very least. Among these discoveries is a bust of black granite dating back to the era of the Seventeenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs, and there is also a granite gate and stones from the lintel of a door bearing cartridges for King Amenemhat I, in a place called the backbone.\n\nEconomic history\nThe alkali lakes of the Natron Valley provided the Ancient Egyptians with the sodium bicarbonate used in mummification and in Egyptian faience, and later by the Romans as a flux for glass making.\nThe Egyptian Salt and Soda Company Railway was built at the end of the 19th century as a 33 miles (54 km) long narrow gauge railway with a gauge of 750 mm, which attracted the first tourists to the wadi.\n\nMonastic history\nThe desolate region became one of Christianity's most sacred areas. The Desert Fathers and cenobitic monastic communities used the desert's solitude and privations to develop self-discipline (asceticism). Hermit monks believed that desert life would teach them to eschew the things of this world and follow God's call. Between the 4th and 7th century AD, hundreds of thousands of people from the world over joined the hundreds of Christian monasteries in the Nitrian Desert, centered on Nitria, Kellia and Scetis (Wadi El Natrun).\nSaint Macarius of Egypt first came to Scetis (Wadi El Natrun) around 330 AD where he established a solitary monastic site. His reputation attracted a loose band of anchorites, hermits and monks who settled nearby in individual cells. Many of them came from nearby Nitria and Kellia where they had previous experience in solitary desert living; thus the earliest cenobitic communities were a loose consolidation of like-minded monks.  By the end of the fourth century, four distinct communities had developed: Baramus, Macarius, Bishoi and John Kolobos. At first these communities were groupings of cells centered on a communal church and facilities, but enclosed walls and watchtowers developed over time and in response to raids from desert nomads. Nitria, Kellia, and Scellis also experienced internal fractures related to doctrinal disputes in Egypt. At its peak the place contained 700 monasteries. The monasteries flourished during the Muslim conquest of Egypt (639–642), but in the eighth and ninth centuries taxation and administration concerns led to conflicts with the Muslim government.\n\nInvasion of Scetis\nScetis was attacked by the Mazices who \"came sweeping off the Libyan desert\" in 407-408 AD and was decimated, causing many notable Desert Fathers to leave the region, such as Abba Anoub. One of the survivors, St. Arsenius the Great, remarked in 410 that, \"The world has lost Rome and the monks have lost Scetis.\" As the Jesuit historian and Professor Willian J. Harmless said, \"Scetis’s destruction marked a turning point in the history of early Christian monasticism. The site would be resettled a few years later, and in fact would suffer other raids, notably in 434, 444, and 570.\"\nNitria and Kellia were eventually abandoned in the 7th and 9th centuries respectively, but Scetis continued throughout the Medieval period. Although some of the individual monasteries were eventually abandoned or destroyed, four have remained in use to the present day:\n\nMonastery of Saint Macarius the Great\nParomeos Monastery\nMonastery of Saint Pishoy\nSyrian Monastery\nSome of the most renowned saints of the region include the various Desert Fathers, including Saint Amun, Saint Arsenius, Saint John Cassian, Saint Isidore of Scété, Saint John the Dwarf, Saint Macarius of Egypt, Saint Macarius of Alexandria, Saint Moses the Black, Saint Pishoy, Sts. Maximos and Domatios, Saint Poimen The Great and Saint Samuel the Confessor.\nTo this day Wadi El Natrun remains the most important center of Coptic monasticism.\n\nSaint-Exupéry's plane crash\nThe environs of Wadi Natrun have been identified as the likely site of where the plane of French \naviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry crashed on December 30, 1935.  After miraculously surviving the crash, he and his plane's mechanic nearly died of thirst before being rescued by a nomad. Saint-Exupéry documented his experience in his book Wind, Sand and Stars. The event is thought to have inspired his most famous work, The Little Prince.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSkete\nDoor of Prophecies\nPikrolimni (lake)\nPachomian monasteries\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nM.

      "content": "## Overview\nWadi El Natrun is a valley in Lower Egypt. The valley contains several alkaline lakes, salt deposits, salt marshes and freshwater marshes. The area home to four historic Coptic monasteries still in use.\n\n## Understand\nWadi El Natrun is an area of low elevation northwest of Cairo. It's characterized by the presence of salt pans, marshes and \"natron\", a naturally occurring mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O, a kind of soda ash) and around 17% sodium bicarbonate (also called baking soda, NaHCO3) along with small quantities of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. It's a key ingredient to the mummification process, as a desiccant of deceased flesh. Natron was harvested here by the Ancient Egyptians, Coptics, and Romans, not to mention modern day Egyptians. For a period, there was also a tourist train to the low-lying lakes.\nWhat is possibly most significant about the area though is the presence of four historic Coptic monasteries still in use. These are the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, Paromeos Monastery, the Monastery of Saint Pishoy, and Syrian Monastery, collectively known as the monastic center of Scetis. From here, the Desert Fathers, with their asceticism, were very noteworthy in developing early Christianity from about 200-400 AD.\nAnother interesting point about the area is that it is believed to be the crash site of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1935, who, after managing to miraculously survive this and then almost dying later of thirst while trying to escape the desert, devised his story for The Little Prince.\n\n## Get in\nThis should be an easy drive from Cairo or Alexandria, being about halfway between the two on highway 75.\n\n## See\nWhen visiting the following monasteries, it is good to take a tour from a monk, to get a better picture of the background of these ancient places. Admission to the monasteries is free, but donations are accepted.\n30.2920930.475651 Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, ☏ +20 48 2600471. Built around 360 AD, it was the monastic home to such saints as Saint Macarius of Alexandria, Saint John the Dwarf, and Saint Paphnutius the Ascetic.

Built in 335 AD by Saint Macarius the Great, it was also the home of Saint Arsenius, Saint Isidore, and Saint Moses the Black. The name Pa-Romeos (that of the Romans) originated from Romans and Roman saints who came to stay there. Five churches are on site, with the oldest dedicated to the VIrgin Mary, and 2.5 km to the northwest is the cave of Pope Cyril VI with relics and icons.

Among the saints resting here are Saint Pishoy, Saint Paul of Tammah, and Pope Shenouda the third. The body of the first is said to be incorrupt. Here also is the Well of the Martyrs where Berber Muslims supposedly cleaned their swords after slaughtering 49 Christians as well as a keep to ward off Berber attacks at that time.    (updated Sep 2020)\n30.3178330.354874 Syrian Monastery, ☏ +20 2 25905161. Also known as Monastery of Saint Mary El-Souria (Dayr al-Suryān) because of its frequent use by Syrian monks from the 8th-14th centuries, was established in the 6th century and likewise went through a series of Bedouin and Berber attacks as well as an instance of plague. Inside is a notable feature called the Door or Gate of Prophecies depicting past and future visions of the Christian faith that the monks had during the 10th century. Frescoes adorn the walls of the church and chapel, and a number of discovered scripts were taken to the British Museum. Just to the west of the monastery is the His Holiness Pope Shenouda III Shrine.
