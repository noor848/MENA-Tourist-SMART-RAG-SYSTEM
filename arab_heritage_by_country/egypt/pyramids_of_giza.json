      "content": "The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the pyramid of Khafre, and the pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.\nThe site is at the edge of the Western Desert, approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 km (8.1 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. It forms the northernmost part of the 16,000 ha (160 km2; 62 sq mi) Pyramid Fields of the Memphis and its Necropolis UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1979. The pyramid fields include the Abusir, Saqqara, and Dahshur pyramid complexes, which were all built in the vicinity of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis. Further Old Kingdom pyramid fields were located at the sites Abu Rawash, Zawyet El Aryan, and Meidum. Most of the limestone used to build the pyramids originates from the underlying Mokattam Formation.\nThe Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.\n\nMaadi settlements\nThe earliest settlement of the Giza plateau predates the pyramid complexes. Four jars from the Maadi culture were found at the foot of the Great Pyramid, likely from a disturbed earlier settlement. Further Maadi settlement near the site was uncovered during work on the Greater Cairo Wastewater Project. Recent reassessment of the radiocarbon dating puts the Maadi culture's eponymous settlement to c. 3800 – c. 3400 BC, which is also the likely maximum possible range for the Giza remains.\n\nPyramids and Sphinx\nThe Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC), the slightly smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren) a few hundred metres to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther south-west. The Great Sphinx lies on the east side of the complex. Consensus among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of Khafre. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as \"queens\" pyramids, causeways, and temples. Besides the archaeological structures, the ancient landscape has also been investigated.\n\nKhufu's complex\nKhufu's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, now buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; diabase paving and nummulitic limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated. The valley temple was connected to a causeway that was largely destroyed when the village was constructed. The causeway led to the Mortuary Temple of Khufu, which was connected to the pyramid. Of this temple, the basalt pavement is the only thing that remains. The king's pyramid has three smaller queens' pyramids (G1-a, G1-b, and G1-c) associated with it and three boat pits. The boat pits contained a ship, and the two pits on the south side of the pyramid contained intact ships when excavated. One of these ships, the Khufu ship, has been restored and was originally displayed at the Giza Solar boat museum, then subsequently moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nKhufu's pyramid still has a limited number of casing stones at its base. These casing stones were made of fine white limestone quarried at Tura.\n\nKhafre's complex\nKhafre's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, the Sphinx temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple yielded several statues of Khafre. Several were found in a well in the floor of the temple by Mariette in 1860. Others were found during successive excavations by Sieglin (1909–1910), Junker, Reisner, and Hassan. Khafre's complex contained five boat-pits and a subsidiary pyramid with a serdab.\nKhafre's pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre's pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.\n\nMenkaure's complex\nMenkaure's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple once contained several statues of Menkaure. During the 5th Dynasty, a smaller ante-temple was added on to the valley temple. The mortuary temple also yielded several statues of Menkaure. The king's pyramid, completed c. 2510 BC, has three subsidiary or queen's pyramids.\nOf the four major monuments, only Menkaure's pyramid is seen today without any of its original polished limestone casing.\n\nSphinx\nThe Sphinx dates from the reign of king Khafre. During the New Kingdom, Amenhotep II dedicated a new temple to Hauron-Haremakhet and this structure was added onto by later rulers.\n\nTomb of Queen Khentkaus I\nKhentkaus I was buried in Giza. Her tomb is known as LG 100 and G 8400 and is located in the Central Field, near the valley temple of Menkaure. The pyramid complex of Queen Khentkaus includes her pyramid, a boat pit, a valley temple, and a pyramid town.\n\nConstruction\nMost construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. Disagreements arise over the feasibility of the different proposed methods by which the stones were conveyed and placed.\nIn building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time. They would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock—not sand—which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.\nFor the Great Pyramid, most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the Nile. These exterior blocks had to be carefully cut, transported by river barge to Giza, and dragged up ramps to the construction site. Only a few exterior blocks remain in place at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. During the Middle Ages (5th century to 15th century), people may have taken the rest away for building projects in the city of Cairo.\nTo ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded over time.\nNew insights into the closing stages of the Great Pyramid building were provided by the 2013 find of Wadi el-Jarf papyri, especially the diary of inspector Merer, whose team was assigned to deliver the white limestone from Tura quarries to Giza. The journal was already published, as well as a popular account of the importance of this discovery.\n\nPurpose\nThe pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled Ancient Egypt. A portion of the pharaoh's spirit called his ka was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the \"former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead\". It is theorized the pyramid not only served as a tomb for the pharaoh, but also as a storage pit for various items he would need in the afterlife. The people of Ancient Egypt believed that death on Earth was the start of a journey to the next world. The embalmed body of the king was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife.\n\nAstronomy\nThe sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were astronomically oriented to the cardinal directions within a small fraction of a degree. According to the disputed Orion correlation theory, the arrangement of the pyramids is a representation of the constellation Orion.\n\nWorkers' village\nThe work of quarrying, moving, setting, and sculpting the huge amount of stone used to build the pyramids might have been accomplished by several thousand skilled workers, unskilled laborers and supporting workers. Bakers, carpenters, water carriers, and others were also needed for the project. Along with the methods used to construct the pyramids, there is also wide speculation regarding the exact number of workers needed for a building project of this magnitude. When Greek historian Herodotus visited Giza in 450 BC, he was told by Egyptian priests that \"the Great Pyramid had taken 400,000 men 20 years to build, working in three-month shifts 100,000 men at a time.\" Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid.\nThe Giza pyramid complex is surrounded by a large stone wall, outside which Mark Lehner and his team discovered a town where the pyramid workers were housed. The village is located to the southeast of the Khafre and Menkaure complexes. Among the discoveries at the workers' village are communal sleeping quarters, bakeries, breweries, and kitchens (with evidence showing that bread, beef, and fish were dietary staples), a copper workshop, a hospital, and a cemetery (where some of the skeletons were found with signs of trauma associated with accidents on a building site). The metal processed at the site was the so-called arsenical copper. The same material was also identified among the copper artefacts from the \"Kromer\" site, from the reigns of Khufu and Khafre.\nThe workers' town appears to date from the middle 4th Dynasty (2520–2472 BC), after the accepted time of Khufu and completion of the Great Pyramid. According to Lehner and the AERA team:\n\nThe development of this urban complex must have been rapid. All of the construction probably happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure, builders of the Second and Third Giza Pyramids.\nUsing pottery shards, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to date the site, the team further concludes:\n\nThe picture that emerges is that of a planned settlement, some of the world's earliest urban planning, securely dated to the reigns of two Giza pyramid builders: Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC).\nRadiocarbon data for the Old Kingdom Giza plateau and the workers' settlement were published in 2006, and then re-evaluated in 2011.\n\nCemeteries\nAs the pyramids were constructed, the mastabas for lesser royals were constructed around them. Near the pyramid of Khufu, the main cemetery is G 7000, which lies in the East Field located to the east of the main pyramid and next to the Queen's pyramids. These cemeteries around the pyramids were arranged along streets and avenues. Cemetery G 7000 was one of the earliest and contained tombs of wives, sons, and daughters of these 4th Dynasty rulers. On the other side of the pyramid in the West Field, the royals' sons Wepemnofret and Hemiunu were buried in Cemetery G 1200 and Cemetery G 4000, respectively. These cemeteries were further expanded during the 5th and 6th Dynasties.\n\nWest Field\nThe West Field is located to the west of Khufu's pyramid. It is divided into smaller areas such as the cemeteries referred to as the Abu Bakr Excavations (1949–1950, 1950–1951, 1952, and 1953), and several cemeteries named based on the mastaba numbers such as Cemetery G 1000, Cemetery G 1100, etc. The West Field contains Cemetery G1000 – Cemetery G1600, and Cemetery G 1900. Further cemeteries in this field are: Cemeteries G 2000, G 2200, G 2500, G 3000, G 4000, and G 6000. Three other cemeteries are named after their excavators: Junker Cemetery West, Junker Cemetery East, and Steindorff Cemetery.\n\nEast Field\nThe East Field is located to the east of Khufu's pyramid and contains cemetery G 7000. This cemetery was a burial place for some of the family members of Khufu.\nThe cemetery also includes mastabas from tenants and priests of the pyramids dated to the 5th Dynasty and 6th Dynasty.\n\nCemetery GIS\nThis cemetery dates from the time of Menkaure (Junker) or earlier (Reisner), and contains several stone-built mastabas dating from as late as the 6th Dynasty. Tombs from the time of Menkaure include the mastabas of the royal chamberlain Khaemnefert, the King's son Khufudjedef (master of the royal largesse), and an official named Niankhre.\n\nCentral Field\nThe Central Field contains several burials of royal family members. The tombs range in date from the end of the 4th Dynasty to the 5th Dynasty or even later.\n\nTombs dating from the Saite and later period were found near the causeway of Khafre and the Great Sphinx. These tombs include the tomb of a commander of the army named Ahmose and his mother Queen Nakhtubasterau, who was the wife of Pharaoh Amasis II.\n\nSouth Field\nThe South Field includes mastabas dating from the 1st Dynasty to 3rd Dynasty as well as later burials. Of the more significant of these early dynastic tombs are one referred to as \"Covington's tomb\", otherwise known as Mastaba T, and the large Mastaba V which contained artifacts naming the 1st Dynasty pharaoh Djet. Other tombs date from the late Old Kingdom (5th and 6th Dynasty). The south section of the field contains several tombs dating from the Saite period and later.\n\nTombs of the pyramid builders\nIn 1990, tombs belonging to the pyramid workers were discovered alongside the pyramids, with an additional burial site found nearby in 2009. Although not mummified, they had been buried in mudbrick tombs with beer and bread to support them in the afterlife. The tombs' proximity to the pyramids and the manner of burial supports the theory that they were paid laborers who took pride in their work and were not slaves, as was previously thought. Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid. Most of the workers appear to have come from poor families. Specialists such as architects, masons, metalworkers, and carpenters were permanently employed by the king to fill positions that required the most skill.\n\nShafts\nThere are multiple burial-shafts and various unfinished shafts and tunnels located in the Giza complex that were discovered and mentioned prominently by Selim Hassan in his report Excavations at Giza 1933–1934. He states: \"Very few of the Saitic [referring to the Saite Period] shafts have been thoroughly examined, for the reason that most of them are flooded.\"\n\nOsiris Shaft\nThe Osiris Shaft is a narrow burial-shaft leading to three levels for a tomb and below it a flooded area. It was mentioned by Hassan, and a thorough excavation was conducted by a team led by Hawass in 1999. It was opened to tourists in November 2017.\n\nNew Kingdom and Late Period\nDuring the New Kingdom Giza was still an active site. A brick-built chapel was constructed near the Sphinx during the early 18th Dynasty, probably by King Thutmose I. Amenhotep II built a temple dedicated to Hauron-Haremakhet near the Sphinx. As a prince, the future pharaoh Thutmose IV visited the pyramids and the Sphinx; he reported being told in a dream that if he cleared the sand that had built up around the Sphinx, he would be rewarded with kingship. This event is recorded in the Dream Stele, which he had installed between the Sphinx's front legs.\nDuring the early years of his reign, Thutmose IV, together with his wife Queen Nefertari, had stelae erected at Giza.\nPharaoh Tutankhamun had a structure built, which is now referred to as the king's resthouse.\nDuring the 19th Dynasty, Seti I added to the temple of Hauron-Haremakhet, and his son Ramesses II erected a stela in the chapel before the Sphinx and usurped the resthouse of Tutankhamun.\nDuring the 21st Dynasty, the Temple of Isis Mistress-of-the-Pyramids was reconstructed. During the 26th Dynasty, a stela made in this time mentions Khufu and his Queen Henutsen.\n\nDivision of the 1903–1905 excavation of the Giza Necropolis\nIn 1903, rights to excavate the West Field and Pyramids of the Giza Necropolis were divided by three institutions from Italy, Germany, and the United States of America.\n\nBackground\nPrior to the division of the Giza Plateau into three institutional concessions in 1903, amateur and private excavations at the Giza Necropolis had been permitted to operate. The work of these amateur archaeologists failed to meet high scientific standards. Montague Ballard, for instance, excavated in the Western Cemetery (with the hesitant permission of the Egyptian Antiquities Service) and neither kept records of his finds nor published them.\n\nItalian, German, and American Concessions at Giza\nIn 1902, the Egyptian Antiquities Service under Gaston Maspero resolved to issue permits exclusively to authorized individuals representing public institutions. In November of that year, the Service awarded three scholars with concessions on the Giza Necropolis. They were the Italian Ernesto Schiaparelli from the Turin Museum, the German Georg Steindorff from the University of Leipzig who had funding from Wilhelm Pelizaeus, and the American George Reisner from the Hearst Expedition. Within a matter of months, the site had been divided between the concessionaires following a meeting at the Mena House Hotel involving Schiaparelli, Ludwig Borchardt (Steindorff's representative in Egypt), and Reisner.\n\nDivision of the West Field\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the three largest pyramids on the Giza plateau were considered mostly exhausted by previous excavations, so the Western Cemetery and its collection of private mastaba tombs were thought to represent the richest unexcavated part of the plateau. George Reisner's wife, Mary, drew names from a hat to assign three long east-west plots of the necropolis among the Italian, German, and American missions. Schiaparelli was assigned the southernmost strip, Borchardt the center, and Reisner the northernmost.\n\nDivision of the Pyramids\nRights to excavate the Pyramids were then also negotiated between Schiaparelli, Borchardt, and Reisner. Schiaparelli gained rights to excavate the Great Pyramid of Khufu along with its three associated queens' pyramids and most of its Eastern Cemetery. Borchardt received Khafre's pyramid, its causeway, the Sphinx, and the Sphinx's associated temples. Reisner claimed Menkaure's pyramid as well as its associated queens' pyramids and pyramid temple, along with a portion of Schiaparelli's Eastern Cemetery. Any future disputes were to be resolved by Inspector James Quibell, as per a letter from Borchardt to Maspero.\n\nImmediate aftermath\nThis arrangement lasted until 1905, when, under the supervision of Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini, the Italian excavations ceased at Giza. As the Italians were more interested in sites which might yield more papyri, they turned their concession of the southern strip of the Western Cemetery over to the Americans under Reisner.\n\nModern usage\nIn 1978, the Grateful Dead played a series of concerts later released as Rocking the Cradle: Egypt 1978. In 2007, Colombian singer Shakira performed at the complex to a crowd of approximately 100,000 people. The complex was used for the final draw of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2021 World Men's Handball Championship.\nEgypt's Minister of Tourism unveiled plans for a €17,000,000 revamp of the complex by the end of 2021, in order to boost tourism in Egypt as well as make the site more accessible and tourist-friendly. According to Lonely Planet, the refurbishment includes a new visitors' centre, an environmentally-friendly electric bus, a restaurant (the 9 Pyramids Lounge), as well as a cinema, public toilets, site-wide signage, food trucks, photo booths, and free Wi-Fi. The new facility is part of a wider plan to renovate the 4,500 year old site.\n\nSee also\nEgyptian pyramids\nList of Egyptian pyramids\nList of largest monoliths, includes section on calculating weight of megaliths\nOutline of Egypt\nTeotihuacan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nGiza Plateau\nPyramids in Giza – Pictures of Giza Pyramids published under Creative Commons License.\nWebsite of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates, researching Giza for over 30 years\n3D virtual tour explaining Houdin's theory Archived 28 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine (plug in needed)\nThe Giza Archives at Harvard University – since 2010, the Giza Archives Project website Archived 11 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine maintained by the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, has moved to Harvard University with an improved, expanded website.

      "content": "## Overview\nPicture yourself in Egypt and you picture this. Imagine Ancient Egypt and this is where your mind will land. Here is Giza, the city just west of Cairo, where on a desert plateau stand the Pyramids, Sphinx and royal tombs of the pharaohs.\n\n## Understand\nEverything west of the Nile's eastern bank is actually in the City of Giza (الجيزة el-Gīza) rather than the City of Cairo. It's a huge conurbation that includes the Nile islands of Gezira and Roda, the riverside neighbourhoods of Dokki and Mohandeseen, and mile after mile of tatty low-rise and 'burbs. Giza plus Cairo and three other townships make up the Greater Cairo Metropolis. But of course the top sight is the UNESCO World Heritage site Pyramids of Giza, at the western edge of the city, in the \"Haram\" district. The Grand Egyptian Museum has started its trial phase already and is open to visitors. This means that Giza is developing into a tourist base in its own right, especially along the main axis of the Haram or Pyramids Road.\nIt's difficult now to imagine this place 100 years ago, with early tourists arriving by carriage along unpaved roads through the fields. The vast, grubby metropolis now sprawls right to the foot of the pyramids complex. Fortunately, development has been prevented (or removed) on the plateau, so the pyramids still stand proud in an arid expanse. A low ridge cuts the view to the south & west so it feels like the threshold of the Sahara, not just a sandy park or anti-oasis in the midst of burbs and more burbs. To the southeast, the pyramids of Abusir and Saqqara shimmer in the distance.\nLots of countries have ancient pyramids: Mexico, Indonesia, Greece, Sudan, Iran. Egypt has at least 135, with perhaps more undiscovered, but Sudan has about 240. The three main Pyramids in Giza are the focal point of the Giza necropolis, or cemetery, that served the elite of the Old Kingdom capital at nearby Memphis in the 2500s BCE. Three pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty were buried here, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, along with members of their royal household. They chose it, west of Memphis, because west was the direction of the afterlife.\nThe new pyramids were magnificent, but they were something of a giveaway to tomb-robbers. Later pharaohs preferred hidden tombs, such as those in the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor. (So it's from these hidden tombs that most Egyptian mummies and artifacts have been recovered.) All the pyramids fell into disrepair, were repeatedly breached by robbers, and their stone cladding was pilfered for building. Wind and rain have whittled them down. However, they're still magnificent.\nAnother magnificent thing about the pyramids is their age: when the Great Pyramids were being constructed, mammoths still roamed Siberia and North America. Forty-two centuries (4200 years) have seen these pyramids stand tall and proud over the cities of the Nile delta.\n\n## Get in\nWhen seeking transport, ask for \"Haram\" and shape your hands like a pyramid by making an upside down Vicory sign with your index and middle finger: people, especially minibus drivers will know where you want to go. Also, see Egypt#By metro or Egypt#By train for more details.\nIn Summer 2025 the gates the the park were reconfigured. The Mena Gate that you could enter from the east was closed. A new main gate was established to the south of the park that has a higher capacity but requires you to take a shuttle bus or a long walk through the park get to what you want to see. There is a sneaky subgate, at the southeast of the park, near the sphinx, which is normally used as an exit but where you can also buy tickets (the ticket office is in an alleyway on the right of the gate), and here you'll enter almost right under the sphinx.\n\n## By plane\nSphinx International Airport (SPX  IATA) near Giza opened in 2020 and as of 2025 has flights with Wizzair from the UK, UAE and various other points in Europe.\n\n## By train\nThe main railway line between Cairo and Luxor/Aswan runs through Giza, where most services halt, so you can travel along the Nile valley without backtracking via downtown Cairo. Indeed some seasonal sleeper trains start from Giza rather than Cairo Ramses station.\n30.00595131.2079651 El Giza railway station, Al Omraneyah Ash Sharqeyah, Al Omraneyah.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## By taxi\nGet an Uber or InDrive to the pyramids. From anywhere in Cairo it won't cost you more than LE150.\nAll the standard warnings about Cairo taxis (see Cairo#By taxi) apply with even greater force around this prime tourist spot. So many tourists, so many of them unwary or jet-lagged, let's fleece these lambs! And it's remarkable how swiftly a \"broken\" taxi meter is restored to life once the driver sees you're serious about bailing out. Taxi drivers may pressure you to see the pyramid complex on horseback, and take you to their friend's stable, but the site is walkable (only a few kilometers across in any direction, maybe 10 km² in area total).\nThe taxi should be able to take you right to the pyramids entrance gate at the very end of the avenue, whereas buses and other vehicles must stop about 500 m short of there. Coming back, taxis will be waiting around the exit gate near the Sphinx.\n\n## By metro/bus\nTake the metro to the Giza metro station. From near there, frequent buses and microbuses run west towards the pyramids, for a fare of LE7. Listen out for conductors shouting \"Haram!\" or look for route numbers 355 or 357. Many of these buses, along with routes 900 and 997, start from central Cairo: look for them around Midan Tahrir. A bus from downtown will be a slow, bumpy experience, as Giza town traffic is just as congested as central Cairo traffic, so use the Metro to get to Giza station and take the microbus from there.\nAs of 2025, the metro is being extended towards the pyramids and the entire road is a construction project, so it can be somewhat of a maze to find the buses and minibuses that can take you toward the pyramids. Don't ask around at the metro station; people will try to hustle you. Instead just point yourself in the direction of the main east-west road and once you find the road walk west until you see minibuses or people waiting impatiently for one. Once you find local Egyptians uninterested in your visit to the pyramids they'll typically be kind and helpful.\nBuses and microbuses can only run to within 500m of the old Mena Gate, then they must either turn back or turn off North into the burbs. However, the Mena Gate was closed in 2025, and you need to exit at the intersection where your ride deviates from its western course. Do not walk west to the Mena Gate, lest you want to finally hear taxi drivers telling you the truth that something is closed. Instead, you must walk south for about 25 minutes (if it's hot, consider the wisdom of this) to head to the subgate that is normally used as an exit near the sphinx. Surprisingly, you can buy tickets here as well, and in fact this is a much quicker way to get to the pyramids and the sphinx than using the new main gate further on.\n\n## Pyramids\nSee also Giza with children article for practical suggestions.\nThe pyramids and associated sites are on the plateau 8 km west of Giza downtown. You'll see them looming up as you approach along Al-Haram Road. You can enter the complex by the main gate at the western terminus of that road. You'll then progress anti-clockwise through the site, eventually to exit near the Sphinx. Alternativelly, you can buy a ticket and enter near the Sphinx; however, in that case, you'll walk up the hill. Both entrances can also be used as exits.\nIgnore the nay-sayers who say this place is not worth the bother: it definitely is. It's spacious and absorbs the crowds (which are greater on Friday when Egyptians come to visit on droves.) The standard advice is to come very early to beat the crowds, who will arrive fairly soon after you. If you come in the cool months the midday sun is not hot, albeit still strong on UV. What's less obvious is whether the pyramid interiors are worth it, and you do need to come early for those. The extra admission is not too cheap and the interiors are hot, humid, cramped, claustrophobic and lacking \"atmosphere\" in any sense. The passages are steep, dusty and hard to move through, and those with any heart or lung or musculo-skeletal limitations will be miserable at best.\nIn good weather, the site is walkable if you're moderately fit -- there is no need for a camel or horse ride, and some people express concern about the way the animals are treated. You can also walk out to the west of the pyramids for a great panorama. In the heat of the summer, you may feel differently.\nIn all cases, most hustlers give up if you just wave them off with your hand and smile saying \"Thank you\". Avoid any further conversation and/or help or photos!\nThe complex is open daily 07:00-17:00 (and winter until 16:00). Individual sites within the complex may close earlier.\nEntry fees for foreigners (as of October 2024), students get 50% discount:\nGeneral admission to the complex: LE540\nEntrance to the Great (Khufu/Cheops) Pyramid : LE900\nEntrance to the Pyramid of Khafre or Menkaure: LE220\nEntrance to the Tomb of Mars Ankh: LE120\nEntrance to the Tombs of the Laborers: LE700\nAll these tickets can be bought at 29.9816231.132431 the main entrance, at the 29.9754531.1407912 Eastern entrance as well as at the entrances to the sites (but it is recommended to use the first two mentioned). Never surrender your ticket: the entrance guards will tear it and give it back to you. Anything else is a scam or a hustle.\nThe Great Pyramid interior is always open, while access to Khafre and Menkaure pyramid interiors alternates each year. Limited numbers of these extra tickets are available each day, so by mid-morning they might be all gone; there isn't a pre-booking system. No cameras are allowed into the pyramids.\n29.97972231.1344441 Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops). 8AM-noon, 1-4PM. The oldest, the largest in Egypt, and the last surviving representative of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built to a height of 146 m (479 ft), but is now slightly reduced to a still towering 137 m (449 ft). Over 2 million blocks of stone were used to construct it, all through manual labour. Entry to the interior is on the north side, facing your approach. LE900.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97160931.1278352 Queens' Pyramids and Nobles' Tombs. All over the complex, but especially around the Great Pyramid, are various of these pyramids and tombs. On its eastern flank, you'll find the burial pits for his \"solar boats\", to carry him into the afterlife. Along the west flank are noblemen's tombs, such as those of Senegemib. Several of these tombs are open to visit and usually free of tourist hordes. There's no extra charge though baksheesh may be appreciated. Enjoy the peace and quiet in the shade of one of the Queen's pyramids along the south flank of Menkaure's Pyramid to take a little break from the hustle on the plateau.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.97631.1309723 Pyramid of Khafre (Pyramid of Chephren). Khafre was the son and successor of Khufu. His pyramid (at 136 m) is slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid, but it's set on higher ground so it looks larger. A few blocks of the original limestone cladding survive at its tip; once all the pyramids were fully encased in this way. Entry to the interior is on the north flank.      (updated Oct 2024)\n29.972531.1283334 Pyramid of Menkaure. Menkaure was probably the son and successor of Khafre. His pyramid is the smallest here at 62 m high, originally 66.5 m. Entry to the interior is on the north flank. Along the south flank are his Queens' pyramids, and on the east flank is his funerary temple. LE220.      (updated Oct 2024)\nAncient causeways link the Khafre and Menkaure pyramids to the necropolis entrance gate next to the Sphinx. At the foot of each is another small temple dedicated to that pharaoh. The causeways are rough going so you may prefer to loop back along the paved driveway. The horse and camel-drivers will now be getting a bit desperate as you approach the exit, and will drop their prices; keep walking.\n29.9752731.137685 Great Sphinx of Giza. Like pyramids, sphinxes (ancient and modern) are found in many lands; this one is specifically the Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a single block of sandstone 45 m long by 22 m wide, bearing a man's head upon a lion's haunches. It is understood, by mainstream archeologists, to have been carved out of the bedrock in the reign of Khafre, bears his likeness, and represents a guardian spirit of the necropolis. Its original name is unknown but it was variously dubbed \"Horus of the horizon\" for the sun god or Abu el-Hol (\"Father of Terror\"). We know it by its Greek name Sphinx, which may mean \"strangler\" (as a lion crushes the neck of its prey, or the fate of those who failed to answer its riddles), or may simply mean \"carved from living rock\". Being solid, it has no inner passageways.It's a frankly mangy-looking lion and its face has always presented an irresistible target. The nose was hacked off by the 15th-century but each successive wave of rulers has blamed the previous lot: 20th-century Egyptians blamed the Brits who blamed Napoleonic troops who blamed the Ottoman Turks. The broken-off regal beard is now in the British Museum.The Sphinx faces east and you approach it, nearing the exit gate, along its north flank. This means that its main features will be in shade, you need morning light for a good photo. (Unlike the pyramids, always with one flank upturned to the sun and the deified Khufu.) To get closer you can pay extra for the enclosure just in front of its paws. There's little point in doing so, the place is crowded with people taking silly selfies, and the slightly closer view just emphasises the manginess.      (updated Oct 2024)\n\n## Grand Egyptian Museum\n29.99361131.1197226 Grand Egyptian Museum (المتحف المصري الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Miṣriyy al-Kabīr), El Remayah Square, Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, Giza (2 km northwest of the Pyramids), ☏ +20 235317344, tourism_info@easwaaqmisr.com. 09:00-17:00. The Grand Egyptian Museum is the long-awaited primary replacement for the venerable Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir, with much bigger exhibition, storage and workplace areas. It was formally opened on 1 November 2025. LE1200.      (updated Aug 2025)\n\n## At the pyramids\nBefore you get on the back of a camel or horse have a look at how they treat their animals. You might change your mind. If you anyway decide to take the offer of one of the horsemen or camel guys, make sure you discuss the price and where you go first. Ask to confirm it covers two people/two horses. Negotiate the price you want. At the end of the trip, when you get back to where you had agreed, get off the horse/camel, hand the man the agreed money and walk away. They will try to come up with all sorts of scams to get more money out of you. If you are happy and wish to give a tip, do it because you choose. Don't feel pressured into giving extra. Just walk away. They won't follow you.\nCamel rides. Avoid succumbing to the temptation of taking a camel ride around the Pyramids, if you can, the practice is noisy, smelly and overrated. Basically, there are many better places in Egypt to take a camel ride, if you must. Things are a little better run than they used to be, and the practice of taking tourists out into the desert and refusing to return unless \"tipped\" is rather rare now.\nGo horse riding in the desert to experience the spirit of the Egyptian horses and the true majesty of the Pyramids seen from outside the 'circus ring' wall. Be careful of touts, however; it's best to ride from one of the better quality stables, like FB Stables or Cairo Horse Riding School. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield on a half day trip to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out overnight with a barbecue and fire. You can also watch the Sound and Light show from FB's rooftop terrace. If you do ride with a tout (they will encourage you to do this if the area is closed for entry for example) they will make out that you will have a great view of the pyramids (which you won't), they will then charge you a fortune, ride at high speed through the streets without a helmet or any regard for safety, they will then demand a tip as you ride back and try to take you to a 'museum' which is a just shop where you will be pressured to buy.\nSee the sunrise, the first sun beams colouring the Pyramids from the terrace on the third floor of a cafe or from the roof terrace of the hostel situated near the second western entrance and ticket-office.\n[dead link] Cairo Horse Riding School, Mansouriya Road (Ext 31 Maadi Ring Road), ☏ +20 1207362425. This expat-run stable is situated inside a pristine Arabian horse ranch about ten minutes away from the Pyramids. The emphasis is on compassionate horsemanship and most of their school horses are rescues from the pyramid area which they have lovingly rehabilitated. They offer rides in the peaceful parts of the Giza desert and along countryside lanes, and longer rides to the Abu Sir Pyramid complex or jumping and dressage lessons inside their arena. (updated Mar 2017)\nFB Stables, Gamal Abdul Nasser St, Sphinx (turn left after the sphinx KFC, then right in Gamal Abdul Nasser Street -- FB is the last stables on the left), ☏ +20 106 507 0288. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, Karim at FB Stables is also great for a \"tourist\" type ride to view the Pyramids and Sphinx from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Sir can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and moonlit rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivalled views over the Pyramids: a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light shows. Great horses, and no beating.\n29.9746531.139511 [dead link] Pyramids Sound and Light Show (Son-et-Lumière) (entrance is by the Sphinx gate (i.e. the pyramids exit)), info@soundandlight.com.eg. Daily 7PM in English, 8PM in another language. Distinctly kitsch but a fun evening if you're in the right mood. The \"voice of the Sphinx\" narrates (often inaccurately) the history of the Giza necropolis and its place in Egyptian history, while a laser display picks out details of the Pyramids and projects scenes onto the side of the Great Pyramid. There are two shows each evening, the first in English and the second in another European language: free headphone translations are available if you're in the \"wrong\" show. In busier times there is a third show, but nowadays this is just (not Fridays) for special bookings, with other languages available. Bring warm clothing. The same company puts on very similar sound & light shows at Luxor-Karnak, Edfu and Philae. You could watch the whole thing cheaper, and almost as well, by eating at Pizza Hut opposite and paying a baksheesh to sit on the terrace. LE130.    (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Elsewhere\n30.0238831.214452 Giza Zoo. The main zoo of Greater Cairo, founded in 1891. 2 km NE of Giza metro station but near the riverside, so if you're coming from downtown especially with children, it's easier to take a taxi. This is an old-fashioned zoo with a poor record for safety and animal welfare.      (updated Jan 2018)\n29.98331.137613 Mena House Oberoi Golf Course (In front of the pyramids).    (updated Dec 2018)\n30.02953431.2140344 Orman Botanical Garden (in front of the Giza Zoo). 9AM–4PM. LE5 per person and LE20 per car.    (updated Dec 2018)\n29.99717131.2151335 Pharaonic Village. 9AM–7PM. Advertised as \"the living museum of Egyptian history, with replicas of an ancient village & the tomb of Tutankhamen.\" Actors dressed as ancient Egyptians play various scenes. Not very authentic, but can be interesting for kids. It has several museums and lots of souvenir shops.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Buy\nAl Amir Perfume Palace, 9 Abu el Houl St., ☏ +20 2 385 4963. An overwhelming smell will hit you as soon as you walk inside, if you can stand the smell for more than a few minutes you can find some good deals on perfume.\nLegends and Legacies, 20 Abuu Hazim St. (Off of Pyramid Road). A relaxed indoor bazaar.\nBeymen, FourSeasons Nile Plaza. Chic designer shopping including brands such Chanel, Prada, Gucci, and Christian Dior.\n\n## Eat\nWestern fast food options are located opposite the main ticket gates to the Pyramid enclosure, Pizza Hut and KFC included, so you can munch on a Tower burger and sip on a Coke in air-conditioned comfort whilst gazing on the more than 4,000-year-old Sphinx across the road. Many may prefer a more authentic experience, although the novelty of the situation could be interesting.\n\n## Budget\n29.97759931.1427981 El Gizawy restaurant, Nazlet El-Semman, Al Haram. At the pyramids entrance where the homestays are. Local specialties. The staff speaks sufficiently good English. Popular with the locals. Falafel for LE7, Egyptian pasta for LE25.    (updated Dec 2022)\n\n## Splurge\n29.98555631.1327782 Marriott Mena House, 6 Pyramids Road, ☏ +20 2 3833222. Built in 1869 as a royal lodge for King Ismail the Magnificent, this magnificent palace has housed guests including Empress Eugenie and Prince Albert. Tastefully restored and located very close to the Pyramids. Rooms in the newer Garden wing from US$150, Palace wing rooms from $210; be sure to ask for a room with a view of the Pyramids. The main Pyramids gate is a 5-minute walk away.      (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Drink\nSince Egypt is a Muslim country, alcohol is not generally permitted. It will generally only be served in hotels.\nYou might find more options in Gezira neighborhood.\n29.99061131.1343031 El Mandara Coffee Shop, Abou Al Mohsen (close to Pyramids). Local cafe with Hookahs and non-alcoholic drinks, black tea and Egyptian coffee, frequented by locals, inside and streetside sitting. LE3-10.    (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are a number of 29.97591531.1414771 accommodations near the entrance to the pyramids. You gonna find hotels, homestays and hostels, many of them with a pyramid view. A good area to stay is around the street Abou Al Hool Al Seiahi. There you find touristy and non-touristy restaurants and grocery stores around.\n\n## Cope\nDecent toilets are next to the ticket office and inside the boat museum (if you have that ticket). From the main entrance, you enter the complex and ascend the driveway towards the Great Pyramid, suitably awe-inspired, and muttering a continual \"lah shukran, lah shukran\" to dismiss the touts, guides, and offers of camels. If you do fancy a ride, see \"Do\" below.\n\n## Stay safe\nClimbing the Pyramids is dangerous and strictly illegal. It adds to wear and tear on the structure, and any stumble is likely to prove fatal. Also, it's hard gritty work and not nearly as cool as you'd imagined, so don't think about it.\nThe Giza Pyramids, being the main tourist attraction in Egypt, attract millions of tourists each year. They likewise attract a large number of the most determined opportunists for miles around. Report any instances of harassment by camel drivers and tourist touts to the black-uniformed (or white-uniformed in the summer) Tourist Police immediately, and be prepared for all manner of potential scams, possibly including \"advice\" from official-looking individuals that an attraction is closed or has an alternate entrance. Also be aware that any \"favour\" of any kind (offering directions, being shown something, etc.) might be done in expectation of a tip, so be cautious when accepting unsolicited help (although don't let your holiday be spoiled by overzealous caution, you also might encounter genuine help). Also note that some Tourist Police might routinely offer to help you in the expectation of a tip. Many known scammers will operate in front of the tourist police, who are either in on it or don't bother to intervene.\nIf on your own, headphones make the incessant \"Hello, where are you from my friend\" conversation-starters easier to ignore, smiling and pointing at the headphones seems to do the trick.\nAvoid making eye contact, starting conversations or accepting any help with taking pictures or posing for pictures for you: they will see you as an easy target for harassment.\nSay \"La Shukran\" (No thanks) as you do this, it shows you know a bit more than the average tourist and will not be seen as aggressive or rude. Smiling as you say it doesn't hurt as it doesn't seem to be seen as an invite to talk, but shows you are not trying to offend.\nBe cautious when choosing a local horse or camel ride; you may be ripped off or put in dangerous situations. The \"donkey-mafia\" that operate by the doors of the main entrance will adopt the most \"persuasive\" and often bullish techniques to get you onto their animals, and they do not appear to understand the meaning of the word \"No\". They will cause such a scene when you say no and have to get off them, which will result in you having to pay for the privilege of refusing their hospitality. Note: Some of these people were involved in the Battle of the Camels during the revolution, in which innocent civilians were killed. Use as your conscience dictates.\nAs anywhere else in Egypt, in hot months especially, take plenty of bottled water with you, wear a hat and wear sunscreen—sunglasses are also definitely a good idea.\n\n## Go next\nCairo/Downtown – where you can see the Egyptian Museum, Cairo Tower, El-Cornish, sail in Nile Cruise, hotels, restaurants, etc. Then you can go to El-Moez St., El-Hussain area, Khan El-Khalili, and Old Cairo Churches. From near the entrance of the pyramids area, take the 29.97736731.142762 city bus line 2001 to the Giza metro station or any microbus going the same way. In Google Maps, the bus stop at the pyramids is called \"bus terminal\". From the Giza station the metro brings you to Downtown cairo. Neither that city bus nor the metro have A/C, so it's just a good option in winter time. In other seasons it's better to take an Uber/Careem.",
