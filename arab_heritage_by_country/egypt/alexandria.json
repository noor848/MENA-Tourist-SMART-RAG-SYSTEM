      "content": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.\n\nName\nAlexandria was located on the earlier Egyptian settlement, which was called Rhacotis (Ancient Greek: Ῥακῶτις, romanized: Rhakôtis), the Hellenised form of Egyptian r-ꜥ-qd(y)t. As one of many settlements founded by Alexander the Great, the city he founded on Rhacotis was called Alexándreia hḗ kat' Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον), which some sources translated as \"Alexandria by Egypt\", as the city was, at that time, in the periphery of Egypt proper (the area beside the Nile). Some of the Alexandrian and Greek populaces, e.g., Hypsicles, also referred to the city as Alexándreia hḗ prós Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ πρός Αἴγυπτον, \"Alexandria near Egypt\"). In the course of Roman rule in Egypt, the city's name was Latinised as Alexandrēa ad Aegyptum.\nAfter the capture of Alexandria by the Rashiduns in AD 641, the name was Arabicised: initial Al- was re-analysed into the definite article; metathesis occurred on x, from [ks] to [sk]; and the suffix -eia was assimilated into the feminine adjectival suffix -iyya (ـِيَّة), finally rendering the name al-ʔiskandariyya (الْإِسْكَنْدَرِيَّة).\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nRadiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th–21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000–800 BC, followed by the absence of activity after that. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian: rꜥ-qdy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there were in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater.\n\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia), as one of his many city foundations. After he captured the Egyptian Satrapy from the Persians, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In one century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\nThe Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept the city in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning (Library of Alexandria, which faced destruction during Caesar's siege of Alexandria in 47 BC), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Egyptian and Jewish. By the time of Augustus, the city grid encompassed an area of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi), and the total population during the Roman principate was around 500,000–600,000, which would wax and wane in the course of the next four centuries under Roman rule.\nAccording to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 AD, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the Roman emperor, which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the Alexandrian pogroms. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.\n\nIn 115 AD, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Diaspora revolt, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215 AD, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365 AD, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\nIslamic era\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. The city was mostly uninjured by the conquest and a new palace called Tarawus was erected in the eastern part of the city, later known as Qasr Faris, \"fort of the Persians\". Although the Byzantine emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664–665.\nIn reference to Alexandria, Ibn Battuta speaks of a number of Muslim saints that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj, who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut al-'Arshi, a disciple of Abu Abbas El Mursi. Ibn Battuta also writes about Abu 'Abdallah al-Murshidi, a saint that lived in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. Although al-Murshidi lived in seclusion, Ibn Battuta writes that he was regularly visited by crowds, high state officials, and even by the Sultan of Egypt at the time, al-Nasir Muhammad. Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on two occasions: in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer possible to enter.\nThroughout the late medieval period, Alexandria re-emerged as a major metropolis and the most important commercial port in Egypt and one of the most important in the Mediterranean. The jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela even described it as “a trading market for all nations”. Indeed, Alexandria was the outlet for all goods coming from Arabia, such as incense, and from India and South-East Asia, such as spices (pepper, cloves, cinnamon, etc.), precious stones, pearls and exotic woods like brazilwood. But it was also the outlet for goods from Africa, such as ivory and precious woods. These goods arrived in Alexandria after passing through Aden on their way to the Red Sea, then headed up the Red Sea to be unloaded in the port of Aydhab. From Aydhab, a caravan took the goods to the Nile, probably to the town of Qus. From there, the goods sailed to Alexandria. These goods then found their way to the Alexandria market alongside Egyptian products.\nThis route was the cheapest and fastest in comparison with the land routes that reached the Mediterranean from Syria or Constantinople. Latin merchants (Venetians, Genoese, Pisans, Aragonese, Provençals, etc.) thus entered this market. As early as the 12th century, the major trading cities had funduqs and consuls in Alexandria. A funduq, in this context is an area, often fortified, within the city dedicated to the community of a trading nation under the authority of a consul. The consul was responsible for adjudicating disputes between merchants of his nation, and also when a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against a merchant of their nation.The terms of this installation were often set out in treaties between the sultans and the consuls. These treaties were part of a policy pursued by the early Mamluk sultans, who encouraged the arrival of merchants from Europe in Alexandria, since this trade not only brought the sultan considerable revenue, but also enabled him to obtain supplies of wood and iron from Europe. Later, in the 14th century, the Latin trade in Alexandria was also important for the sultans, as it enabled them to obtain supplies of mameluks (slave-soldiers) often sold by Genoese merchants.\n\nAs this trade was very important to the sultans, they were keen to control the city's institutions. Indeed, in Alexandria, in addition to an Emir (governor), the sultan sent a customs inspector who answered directly to the nazir al-khas (person in charge of managing the sultan's patrimony). Customs was not only responsible for collecting customs duties, but also for the security of the port and its warehouses. Alexandria customs also played a role in commercial arbitration and was the preferred circuit for the sale of products brought in by the merchants, which took place at auction. These sales were set up to encourage the merchants to sell their products to or through the sultan, rather than selling them freely on the city's markets. Latin merchants also had jurisdictional privileges : in addition to being judged by their consul if a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against them, Latin merchants could not be judged by the qadis (civil judges) but had to be judged by the mazalim (the sultan's courts).Alexandria lost much of its importance in international trade after Portuguese navigators discovered a new sea route to India in the late 15th century. This reduced the amount of goods that needed to be transported through the Alexandrian port, as well as the Mamluks' political power. After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and it only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1820.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and, by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernise the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.\nIn July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nEuropeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalisation of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\nGeography\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. It is in the Far West Nile delta area. It is a densely populated city; its core areas belie its large administrative area. The city's geology constitutes of soil sediments, oolitic sand and clay, oolitic limestone (from the Middle Miocene), grey shelly dolomite, marly dolomite, oncolitic limestone and dolomite, and as well as shelly limestone.\n\nNotes: 2020 CAPMAS projection based on 2017 revised census figures, may differ significantly from 2017 census preliminary tabulations. The 14 kisms were reported simply as Alexandria city by CAPMAS in 2006 but given explosive growth definitions, likely informal, may have changed or may be set to change. Same area with 12 kisms existed in 1996. Kisms are considered 'fully urbanised'\n\nClimate\nAlexandria has a hot steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), virtually hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh). Like the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate than the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 °C (41 °F).\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 °C (86 °F). The average annual rainfall is around 211 mm (8.3 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)\nPort Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °C (32 °F) on 31 January 1994.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Alexandria in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Gaza City. The annual temperature would increase by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), and the temperature of the warmest and the coldest month by 2.9 °C (5.2 °F) and 3.1 °C (5.6 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nDue to its location on a Nile river delta, Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable cities to sea level rise in the entire world. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already have to be relocated before 2030. The 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that by 2050, Alexandria and 11 other major African cities (Abidjan, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the \"moderate\" climate change scenario RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5, while RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. Additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. In every single estimate, Alexandria alone bears around half of these costs. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Recent studies published in Earth's Future by the American Geophysical Union indicate that rising sea levels are causing increases in coastal aquifer levels, reaching building foundations and accelerating their corrosion and potential collapse. The study predicts that in 2025, more than 7000 buildings in Alexandria will be at risk of collapse due to these groundwater processes.\n\nAncient layout\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\n\nRhakotis\nRhakotis (from Coptic Rakotə, \"Alexandria\") was the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians.\n\nBrucheum\nBrucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times, Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal.\n\nJewish quarter\nThe Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city.\n\nTwo main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 m (200 ft) wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; the line of the great East–West \"Canopic\" street is also present in modern-day Alexandria, having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharae Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260 m-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"—a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m or 590 ft). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour.\nIn Strabo's time (latter half of the 1st century BC), the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port\", and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus.\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks which became known as \"Cleopatra's Needles\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; site unknown.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar\", which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 m (453 ft) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 AD, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\nCityscape\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\nPompey's Pillar\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 ft (27 m) high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 m3 (4,662 cu ft) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes, but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.\n\"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nCatacombs of Kom El Shoqafa\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.\n\nKom El Deka\nThe most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\n\nTemple of Taposiris Magna\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\nCitadel of Qaitbay\nCitadel of Qaitbay is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by the mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built on an area of 17,550 square metres.\n\nExcavation\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.\n\nPlaces of worship\nIslam\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi Besher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nChristianity\nAlexandria was once considered the third-most important city in Christianity, after Rome and Constantinople. Until 430, the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Alexandrian Church split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral (though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo). The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint George's Church in Sporting, Saint Mark and Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi Anárgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel and Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark and Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Collège Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\nJudaism\nAlexandria's Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.  The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010. The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Université Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\nIn September 2023, The Greek University of Patras announced that it is opening a branch in Alexandria, in a first-of-its-kind move by a Greek higher education institution.  The Greek university of Patras branch will operate two departments, one Greek-speaking and one English-speaking in the subjects of Greek culture, Greek language and Greek philosophy.\n\nSchools\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Collège de la Mère de Dieu, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, Collège Saint Marc, Écoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish-language schools in Alexandria are the most popular; those in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Forsan American School, Forsan International School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Zahran Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College (previously called English Girls' College).\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\n\nWomen\nAround the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fatāh by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.\n\nTransport\nAirports\nThe city's principal airport is currently Alexandria International Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city centre, which is now composed of 2 Terminals. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which was opened in February 2010 wherease Terminal 2 is the Brand New Terminal and was inaugurated in 2025.\n\nPort\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as Alexandria Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbour, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\nRoads\nAmong the most important are three main roads that run parallel and connect the city center to its eastern parts: Alexandria Corniche (or El-Geish Road), which is approximately 17 km long and connects the Bahary area in the west to the Mandara area in the east; Al-Horreya Road (or Abu Qir Road), about 10 km long, linking the Shallalat area in the west to the Victoria area in the east; and Al-Mahmoudia Axis, which is 23 km long and connects the Qabbari area in the west to the Abis villages in the southeast. In addition to these, there are other major roads such as Fouad Street, considered the oldest street in Alexandria, Malek Hefni Street, Suez Canal Street, Nabi Daniel Street, Port Said Street, Sultan Hussein Street, and the Ring Road. Alexandria also includes several highways that connect it to other cities, such as the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, the Cairo–Alexandria Agricultural Road, the International Coastal Road, the Al-Mashir Fouad Abu Zekri Axis, and the Kafoury–Borg El Arab Road.\n\nRail\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the centre of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\nTrams\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east.\n\nMetro\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro was due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\nCulture\nLibraries\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses—the Museion, Greek Μουσείον (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day, the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.\nThe Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\nMuseums\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum was the city's main archeological museum, focused on artifacts from its Greco-Roman period. It was opened in 1892 and was closed in 2005 for extensive renovations and expansion. The museum re-opened to the public in October 2023.\nOther museums in the city include the Cavafy Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Royal Jewelry Museum.\n\nTheaters\nAlexandria Opera House hosts performances of classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera.\n\nPoetry\nDuring the Hellenistic period, poets evolving in the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Philiscus of Corcyra, Lycophron, Alexander Aetolus, Sositheus,...) are currently known as the Alexandrian Pleiad.\nIn modern times, Constantine P. Cavafy, a major Greek poet who was born and lived in Alexandria used several themes associated with this city in his work: \"Alexandrian Kings\", \"In Alexandria, 31 B.C.\", \"Myres: Alexandria 340 A.D\", \"Kaisarion\" and \"The God Abandons Antony\". In the latter, Alexandria becomes the symbol of the life whose forthcoming loss must be faced with dignity.\n\nSports\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nAlexandria is also known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city. Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Asmat Abdel-Meguid (1923–2013), Egyptian diplomat\nSoheir Bakhoum (1947–2003), Egyptian numismatist\nConstantine P.

      "summary": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.",

      "content": "الإسْكَنْدَرِيَّة هي العاصمة الثانية لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمة محافظة الإسكندرية وأكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهة الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينة الإسكندرية الكثير من المعالم المميزة، إذ يوجد بها أكبر موانئ مصر البحرية وهو ميناء الإسكندرية الذي يمر به نحو 60% من إجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصرية، وتضم أيضًا مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة التي تحتوي على أكثر من ثمانية ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الإسكندرية القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الأثرية مثل قلعة قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمة، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الأنشطة الاقتصادية، وتنقسم الإسكندرية إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي: حي أول المنتزة، حي ثان المنتزة، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي أول العامرية، وحي ثان العامرية.\nبدأ العمل على إنشاء الإسكندرية على يد الإسكندر الأكبر سنة 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيرة ممتدة أمام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيرة أخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيرة مريوط، واتخذها الإسكندر الأكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمة لمصر لما يقرب من ألف سنة، حتى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنة 641 م، اشتهرت الإسكندرية عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية القديمة والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الإسكندرية والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل إلى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المنارة قائمة حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنة 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين أن اختيار الإسكندر الأكبر لمدينة الإسكندرية كي تكون عاصمة لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمة الأوديسة، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن أوديسيوس ملك إيثاكا، إلى مينلاوس ملك إسبرطة يسأله إن كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن أهوال الحرب وشجاعة ملك إيثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وأنه بعدما أضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيرة فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك إسبرطة: «كان في مقدورنا أن نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الأنهار».\n\nالتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nفي بداية القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، لم تكن الإسكندرية سوى قرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\" يحيط بها قرى صغيرة، يقول عنها علماء الآثار أنها ربما كانت تعدّ موقعًا استراتيجيًا لطرد الأقوام التي قد تهجم من حين إلى آخر من الناحية الغربية لوادي النيل، أو لربما كانت «راكتوس» مجرد قرية صغيرة تعتمد على الصيد ليس إلا، وعلى امتداد الساحل الرئيسي للقرية توجد جزيرة تسمى \"جزيرة فاروس\" يوجد بها ميناء يخدم الجزيرة والقرى الساحلية معًا، في ذلك الوقت كانت مصر تحت الاحتلال الفارسي منذ سقوط حكم الفراعنة والأسرة الثلاثون سنة 343 ق م، ولم تكن مصر الوحيدة الواقعة تحت احتلال الفرس، فقد كانت بلاد الشام والعراق واقعة تحت هذا الاحتلال، وفي مقابل قوة الفرس كانت قوة الاغريق في ازدياد سريع، وبدأت المواجهة بينهما في ربيع سنة 334 ق.م، واستمرت المعارك بينهما حتى دخل الإسكندر الأكبر مدينة صور ومن ثم إلى غزة حتى أتم دخول مصر سنة 333 ق م.\nبعد دخول الإسكندر الأكبر مصر وطرده للفرس منها، استقبله المصريون بالترحاب نظرًا للقسوة التي كانوا يُعاملون بها تحت الاحتلال الفارسي، ولكي يؤكد الإسكندر الأكبر أنه جاء إلى مصر صديقًا وحليفًا وليس غازيًا مستعمرًا، اتجه لزيارة معبد الإله آمون إله مصر الأعظم في ذلك الوقت، فذهب إلى المعبد في واحة سيوة، وأجرى له الكهنة طقوس التبني ليصبح الإسكندر الأكبر ابنًا للإله آمون، ولُقب فيما بعد بابن آمون،  وفي طريقه إلى المعبد مرّ بقرية للصيادين كانت تُسمى «راقودة»، فأعجب بالمكان وقرر أن يبني مدينة تحمل اسمه لتكون نقطة وصل بين مصر واليونان وهي مدينة الإسكندرية (باليونانية القديمة: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον؛ وباليونانية الحديثة: Αλεξάνδρεια)، وعهد ببنائها إلى المهندس دينوقراطيس، والذي شيدها على نمط المدن اليونانية، ونسقها بحيث تتعامد الشوارع الأفقية على الشوارع الرأسية،  وكذلك إنشاء جسر يصل بين الجزيرة والقرية أُطلق عليه \"هيبتاستاديون\"، وبعد عدة شهور ترك الإسكندر مصر متجهًا نحو الشرق ليكمل باقي فتوحاته، ففتح بلاد فارس، لكن طموحاته لم تتوقف عند هذا الحد بل سار بجيشه حتى وصل إلى الهند وآسيا الوسطى، وبينما كان الإسكندر هناك فاجأه المرض الذي لم يدم طويلاً حيث داهمه الموت بعد عشرة أيام وهو لم يتجاوز الإثنين والثلاثين من عمره.\nاتسمت الإسكندرية في مطلعها بالصبغة العسكرية كمدينة للجند الإغريق، ثم تحولت أيام البطالمة الإغريق إلى مدينة ملكية بحدائقها وأعمدتها الرخامية البيضاء وشوارعها المتسعة،  وتحوّلت في ذلك الحين إلى عاصمة لمصر، وأصبحت إحدى حواضر العلوم والفنون بعد أن شيَد فيها البطالمة عددًا من المعالم الكبرى مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية التي تُعد أول معهد أبحاث حقيقي في التاريخ، وفنار الإسكندرية التي أصبحت أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع في العالم القديم، وكانت تطل على البحر وجنوب شرقي الميناء الشرقي الذي كان يطلق عليه الميناء الكبير؛ إذا ما قورن بينه وبين ميناء هيراكليون عند أبو قير على فم أحد روافد النيل القديمة التي اندثرت، وحالياً انحسر مصب النيل ليصبح على بعد 20 كيلومتراً من أبوقير عند رشيد.\nخضعت المدينة اسميًا للرومان سنة 80 ق م، وفقًا لرغبة بطليموس العاشر، واستمر الأمر على هذا المنوال قرابة قرن من الزمن قبل أن تسقط بيد يوليوس قيصر بعد حصار الإسكندرية (47 ق.م)، عندما استغلت روما النزاع والحرب الأهلية القائمة بين بطليموس الثالث عشر ومستشاريه وشقيقته كليوبترا السابعة، وبعد عدة معارك انتصر قيصر وتم قتل أخيها، وبذلك استطاعت كليوباترا الانفراد بحكم مصر، وعلى أحد آراء بعض المؤرخين فقد تم حرق مكتبة الإسكندرية الشهيرة في ذلك الوقت في صراع يوليوس قيصر مع بطليموس الثالث عشر. سقطت المدينة بيد القائد «أوكتافيوس» الذي أصبح لاحقًا الإمبراطور «أغسطس» في 1 أغسطس سنة 30 ق م، بعد معركة الإسكندرية، وبهذا أصبحت مصر ولاية رومانية، ظلت الإسكندرية أكبر مدينة في الإمبراطورية الرومانية الواسعة بعد روما العاصمة، وأقدم الرومان على عمل العديد من الإصلاحات فيها، فقاموا بتجديد وإعادة حفر القناة القديمة التي كانت تربط نهر النيل والبحر الأحمر لخدمة التجارة، وكذلك فقد أعطى الرومان لليهود في الإسكندرية والذين كانوا يمثلون جزءًا أساسيًا من التركيبة السكانية للمدينة، حريات كثيرة وسُمح لهم بإدارة شئونهم الخاصة.\nغير أن كل ذلك لم يوقف حركات التمرد والتوتر في المدينة والتي وصف أحد الكتاب القدماء أهلها بأنهم \"الأكثر رغبة في الثورة والقتال من أي قوم آخر\"، فمن أعمال الشغب في الإسكندرية سنة 38 وتمرد اليهود سنة 116، والتوتر المتواصل بين اليهود واليونان على مسائل قديمة، فضلاً عن احتجاج السكندريون بصفة عامة على الحكم الروماني، والذي أدى سنة 215 وعلى إثر زيارة الإمبراطور الروماني إلى الإسكندرية إلى قتل ما يزيد عن عشرين ألف سكندري بسبب قصيدة هجاء قيلت في الرجل، غير أن من أهم أسباب الاضطراب هو أن العالم قد شهد أحد أهم الأحداث في التاريخ وهو ميلاد الديانة المسيحية، والتي تزامنت مع بداية الحكم الروماني في مصر، وحيث أن الديانة الجديدة بدأت تجذب الكثير من المصريين وتدعوهم إلى نبذ الوثنية وعبادة الله، فقد بدأ عصر جديد من الاضطهاد حيث كانت روما تريد فرض عبادة الإمبراطور وكذلك العبادات الوثنية على المصريين. ضربت موجة تسونامي هائلة المدينة بتاريخ 21 يوليو 365،  جرّاء زلزال وقع بالقرب من جزيرة كريت، ونجم عنها خراب ودمار كبيرين.\nاكتسبت المسيحية قوة كبيرة رغم كل النزاعات وذلك في مواجهة ديانة باقي المصريين من الوثنيين وخاصة في عهد الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الكبير (378-395) الذي أصدر مرسوماً ببطلان العبادات الوثنية، فعقد بطريرك الإسكندرية ثيوفيلوس (385-412) عزمه على تنفيذ المرسوم الإمبراطوري بدقة وحزم وقد عاونه اتباعه وقوات الإمبراطور، فتم تدمير عدد من المعابد الوثنية وتحويل بعضها الآخر إلى كنائس مثل معبد سرابيوم المقام للإله سيرابيس وذلك سنة 391 حيث شيدت على أطلاله كنيستان.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nخضعت الإسكندرية للإمبراطورية البيزنطية بعد انقسام الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى قسمين غربي روماني وشرقي رومي بيزنطي، وفي القرن السابع الميلادي كانت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية قد وصلت إلى حالة بالغة من الضعف، فشجع ذلك الإمبراطورية الفارسية الساسانية في الشرق على الهجوم على ممالكها واحتلال الشام ومصر، فدخل الفرس الإسكندرية ونهبوا المدينة وقتلوا الكثير من أهلها، لكن الحكم الفارسي لم يدم إلا بضع سنين حيث استطاع الإمبراطور هرقل استرداد ممالكه ورجعت الإسكندرية من جديد تابعة للإمبراطورية البيزنطية، وقد أراد هرقل تعيين بطريرك قوي في الإسكندرية يسند له الرئاسة السياسية بجانب سلطته الدينية ليكون قادر على قهر الأقباط وإرغامهم على اتباع مذهب المونوثيليتية فعين بطريركًا رومانيًا يدعى «كيرس» والمعروف عند مؤرخي العرب باسم «المقوقس»، لتحقيق هذه الغاية، إلا أنه فشل في ذلك، وخلال هذا العهد كان الإسلام قد برز في شبه الجزيرة العربية واستقطب أعدادًا كبيرة من الناس، وكان النبي محمد قد أرسل إلى حكام الدول المجاورة رسائل يدعوهم فيها إلى الإسلام، وكان المقوقس من ضمن هؤلاء الحكام.\n\nبعد وفاة النبي محمد، خرج العرب المسلمون من شبه الجزيرة العربية لنشر الإسلام في أنحاء العالم المعروف، فانطلق عمرو بن العاص من القدس إلى مصر، بعد أن شاور الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب، سالكًا الطريق التي سلكها قبله قمبيز والإسكندر الأكبر، واصطدمت القوة العربية بالروم في مدينة الفرما مدخل مصر الشرقي، فسقطت المدينة بيد عمرو، ثم تبعتها بلبيس، وكان المقوقس عامل الروم على مصر قد تحصن بحصن إزاء جزيرة الروضة على نهر النيل، ورابط عمرو في عين شمس، ولما وصلت الإمدادات من الخليفة عمر، تقاتل الفريقان في منتصف الطريق بين المعسكرين،  فانهزم المقوقس واحتمى بالحصن، ولمّا ضيّق عمرو عليه الحصار اضطر إلى القبول بدفع الجزية،  وتابع عمرو استيلائه على المدن المصرية ولم يبق إلا الإسكندرية عاصمة الديار المصرية وثانية حواجز الإمبراطورية البيزنطية، وكان الاسطول البيزنطي يحميها من البحر، ولكن شدّة الغارات البريّة العربية، وموت هرقل وارتقاء ابنه قسطنطين الثاني عرش الإمبراطورية وكان حديث السن، جعلت الروم يوافقون على شروط الصلح، فجلت قواتهم وأسطولهم عن المدينة ودخلها المسلمين فاتحين، وأطلقوا الحرية الدينية للأقباط وأمّنوهم على ممتلكاتهم وأرواحهم.\n\nولكن بعد مدة قصيرة من السيطرة على المدينة قام البيزنطيون بهجوم مضاد ليستعيدوا المدينة من جديد إلا أن عمرو بن العاص استطاع هزيمتهم ودخل الإسكندرية مرة أخرى في صيف سنة 646، ورحب الأقباط في الإسكندرية بقيادة البطريرك بنيامين الأول بالمسلمين ترحيبًا بالغًا وبذلك فقدت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية أغنى ولاياتها إلى الأبد، فقدت الإسكندرية مكانتها السياسية بعد ذلك بسبب اتخاذ عمرو بن العاص من الفسطاط عاصمة له بدلاً منها، لكنها استمرت الميناء الرئيسي لمصر وأبرز مرافئها التجارية، نشطت حركة التجارة في الإسكندرية خلال العهد الإسلامي، كذلك تم بناء سور جديد للمدينة، ووفد إليها الكثير من العلماء من أمثال الإمام الشاطبي والحافظ السلفي وابن خلدون وغيرهم الذين أثروا الحركة العلمية للمدينة، ومن المعالم التي تركتها المرحلة الأولى للفتح ضريح وجامع أبو الدرداء أحد صحابة النبي محمد في منطقة العطارين والذي شارك في فتح مصر.\nتعرضت الإسكندرية لحصار عُرف بحصار الإسكندرية (1174) من جانب الأسطول الصقلي كجزء من الحملات الصليبية ضد الشرق، إلا أنه فشل فشل ذريعًا، وتعرضت كذلك لعدة زلازل قوية سنة 956 ثم 1303 ثم 1323 أدت إلى تحطم فنار الإسكندرية ولم يبق منها سوى الأساس الحجري الذي شيدت عليه قلعة قايتباي في منتصف القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، كما تعرضت الإسكندرية لهجمات صليبية كان أخرها في أكتوبر سنة 1365 عانت فيها من أعمال قتل دون تمييز بين مسلم ومسيحي ونهب وضربت المساجد،  إلا أنه وفي سنة 1480 قام السلطان المملوكي قايتباي ببناء حصن للمدينة لحمايتها في نفس موقع المنارة والمعروفة الآن بقلعة قايتباي، حيث حظيت الإسكندرية في عهده بعناية كبيرة، وقد هيأت الدولة المملوكية وسائل الراحة لإقامة التجار الأوروبيين في مينائي الإسكندرية ودمياط فبنيت دور الإقامة ووضعت تحت تصرف التجار حتى يعيشوا وفق النمط الذي اعتادوه في بلادهم، وفي وقت لاحق فقدت الإسكندرية الكثير من أهميتها بعد اكتشاف طريق رأس الرجاء الصالح في سنة 1498 وتحوّل طريق التجارة إلى المحيط الأطلسي بدلاً من البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وكذلك بعد جفاف فرع نهر النيل والقناة التي كانت تمد المدينة بالمياه العذبة.\n\nالعصور الحديثة\nخضعت الإسكندرية مع باقي مصر إلى الحكم العثماني بعد انتصار السلطان سليم الأول على المماليك في معركة الريدانية ودخل مصر سنة 1517، شهدت الإسكندرية أحداثًا مهمة خلال القرن الثامن عشر تمثلت بالحملة الفرنسية على مصر ودخول الجنود الفرنسية بقيادة نابليون بونابرت الإسكندرية في أوائل يوليو 1798 بدون مقاومة تُذكر، واعتبرت الدولة العثمانية احتلال بونابرت لمصر اعتداءً عليها، ووقف الإنجليز والروس إلى جانب العثمانيين وعرضوا المساعدة على الباب العالي لإخراج الفرنسيين من مصر،  وسرعان ما التحمت القوات البريطانية مع الفرنسية في معركة الإسكندرية (1801) في معركة أدت لخروج القوات الفرنسية من مصر،  لتدخل الإسكندرية ومصر بصفة عامة مرحلة جديدة مليئة بالنهضة في جميع المجالات.\n\nتدين الإسكندرية لمحمد علي باشا بالنهضة حيث أنه أعاد للمدينة الحياة بعدّة وسائل ففي سنة 1820 تم الانتهاء من حفر قناة المحمودية لربط الإسكندرية بنهر النيل مما كان له الفضل في إنعاش اقتصاد الإسكندرية،  وقد صمم الميناء الغربي كي يكون هو الميناء الرسمي لمصر وتم بناء منارة حديثة عند مدخله، كذلك فإن منطقة المنشية هي بالأساس من تصميم مهندسيه، كما شيد محمد علي عند رأس التين مقره المفضل وأصبحت الإسكندرية هي مقر قناصل الدول الغربية مما جعل لها شخصية أوروبية حيث جذبت العديد من الفرنسيين واليونانيين واليهود والشوام بسبب الانتعاشة التي حظيت بها المدينة،  كما أنشأ دار الصناعة البحرية في المدينة والتي يطلق عليها حالياً \"ترسانة الإسكندرية\"، وذلك لتلبية احتياجات الأسطول المصري على يد المهندس الفرنسي سيريزى بك.\n\nأصبحت الإسكندرية منذ تولي محمد علي الحكم وخلال المائة وخمسين سنة التالية أهم ميناء في البحر المتوسط ومركزًا مهما للتجارة الخارجية،  ومقرًا لسكان متعددي الأعراق واللغات والثقافات، وتحت حكم خلفاء محمد علي استمرت الإسكندرية في النمو الاقتصادي، فشهدت في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل تحديداً اهتماماً يُشابه الاهتمام الذي أولاه لتخطيط مدينة القاهرة، فأنشأ بها الشوارع والأحياء الجديدة وتمت إنارة الأحياء والشوارع بغاز المصابيح بواسطة شركة أجنبية،  وأنشأت بها جهة خاصة للاعتناء بتنظيم شوارعها وللقيام بأعمال النظافة والصحة والصيانة فيها، ووضعت شبكة للصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الأمطار،  وتم رصف الكثير من شوارع المدينة، وقامت إحدى الشركات الأوروبية بتوصيل المياه العذبة من منطقة المحمودية إلى المدينة وتوزيعها بواسطة \"وابور مياه\" الإسكندرية، وأنشأت في المدينة مباني ضخمة وعمارات سكنية فخمة في عدد من الأحياء كمنطقة محطة الرمل وكورنيش بحري.\n\nتعرضت الإسكندرية خلال هذه العصر الحديث إلى الكثير من الأحداث وخاصة بعد مذبحة الإسكندرية وعند بداية الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر، حيث قام الأسطول البريطاني بقصف الإسكندرية لمدة يومين متواصلين حتى استسلمت المدينة معلنةً بداية الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر،  والذي دام لسبعين عامًا،  وتحت الاحتلال البريطاني زاد عدد الأجانب وخاصة اليونان الذين أصبحوا يمثلون مركزًا ثقافيًا وماليًا مهم في المدينة،  وتحولت الإسكندرية وقناة السويس إلى مواقع إستراتيجية مهمة للقوات البريطانية،  تعرضت المدينة لأضرار هائلة في فترة الحرب العالمية الثانية،  حيث كانت تقصفها الطائرات الحربية لدول المحور خصوصًا الإيطالية والألمانية ما تسبب في دمار ومقتل المئات واعتبرت الإسكندرية أكثر المدن المصرية تضرراً من تلك الحرب،  وبعد نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية وقيام حركة 23 يوليو 1952 أُلغيت الملكية في مصر وغادر الملك فاروق الأول آخر ملوك الأسرة العلوية إلى المنفى،  وقامت الجمهورية المصرية على أنقاض المملكة بقيادة جمال عبد الناصر الذي أعلن من الإسكندرية وبالتحديد في ميدان المنشية تأميم قناة السويس،  وقد قلت أعداد الجاليات الأجنبية في الإسكندرية بعد سياسة التأميم التي اتبعها عبد الناصر وكذلك بسبب الحروب التي خاضتها مصر مع إسرائيل، إلا أنه ما يزال هناك جالية يونانية بسيطة في المدينة. وفي 12 سبتمبر 1955 تعرضت الإسكندرية لزلزال بقوة 6.3 على مقياس ريختر، تسبب في في مقتل 18 شخصًا وإصابة 89 شخصًا حيث انهار 40 منزلًا بالكامل و420 منزلًا بشكل جزئي، وكان للإسكندرية حضور سياسي حيث استضافت مؤتمر قمة الدول العربية 1964 والذي أقُيم في قصر المنتزه بحضور أربعة عشر زعيمًا عربيًا.\n\nالمرحلة المعاصرة\nبعد بداية سنة 2011 بعشرين دقيقة حدث انفجار كبير أمام كنيسة القديسين في منطقة سيدي بشر أثناء الاحتفالات بعيد الميلاد للكنائس الشرقية، نجم عنه 24 قتيلًا (بينهم مسلمون) كما أصيب 97 شخصًا،  أحدثت هذه العملية صدمة في مصر وفي العالم كله، واتهمت وزارة الداخلية المصرية تنظيم جيش الإسلام الفلسطيني بالمسئولية عن الحادث،  واحتج كثير من المسيحيين في الشوارع وهتفوا بشعارات ضد نظام حكم مبارك، وانضم بعض المسلمين للاحتجاجات، وحدثت اشتباكات بين الشرطة والمحتجين في الإسكندرية والقاهرة.\nبعد نجاح الثورة التونسية وإسقاط نظام الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي،  انتقلت روح الثورة إلى مصر، فخرج الآلاف من الأشخاص إلى شوارع القاهرة والإسكندرية وغيرها من المدن المصرية مطالبين بتحسين الوضع المعيشي وخفض الأسعار وتحسين الوضع الاجتماعي للناس. وقد بدأت المظاهرات بالإسكندرية بمنطقة المنشية والعطارين ومحطة الرمل والمنتزه وسيدي جابر. وقد تعاظم شأنها وازداد عدد المشاركين بها مع مرور الوقت، مطالبين بتنحي الرئيس حسني مبارك، أسفرت المظاهرات التي بدأت في 25 يناير عن تنحي حسني مبارك،  فكان من شأن ذلك تهدئة الأوضاع بعض الشيء في المدينة وتفريق المتظاهرين.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة الإسكندرية شمال مصر على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط عند التقاء خط العرض 31° 11' 34.6 شمال، وخط الطول 29° 54' 17.5 شرق، وهي عبارة عن شريط ساحلي بطول حوالي 55 كم شمال غرب دلتا النيل بدءاً من أبو قير شرقًا وحتى سيدي كرير غربًا، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71.5 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي،  ومن الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير،  ومن الغرب منطقة سيدي كرير حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي ومركز ومدينة برج العرب،  والتربة في مدينة الإسكندرية سهلية منبسطة على ارتفاع -1 من مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز الإسكندرية بمناخ معتدل، إذ يسود بها مناخ البحر المتوسط والذي يتميز بصيفه الحار والجاف وشتائه الرطب والمعتدل والممطر، يمتد فصل الشتاء في الإسكندرية عبر شهور ديسمبر، يناير، وفبراير وتترواح درجة الحرارة العظمى فيه ما بين 12 و 18 درجة مئوية، وتتعرض الإسكندرية خلال هذا الفصل إلى العديد من العواصف الرعدية الشديدة والبرد والأمطار الغزيرة في ظاهرة جوية يُطلق عليها \"نوة\"، أما فصل الصيف في الإسكندرية، فيمتد عبر شهور يونيو، يوليو، وأغسطس وتترواح درجة الحرارة فيه ما بين 25 و 30 درجة مئوية،  ويتميز صيف الإسكندرية بالجفاف وارتفاع نسبة الرطوبة، أما فصلي الربيع والخريف فيعدّان أفضل وقت لزيارة المدينة، وفيهما لا تزيد درجة الحرارة العظمى عن 22 درجة مئوية باستثناء زمن الموجات الخماسينية التي تصل فيها الحرارة في أشهر الربيع إلى 32 درجة مئوية أحيانًا.\n\nالتخطيط والتقسيم الإداري\nلم يكن تخطيط مدينة الإسكندرية مختلفًا عن السابق بل كان تخطيطاً أشبه بالمدن الإغريقية القديمة، حيث كان يأخذ شكل شطرنج وهو عبارة عن شارعين رئيسيين ومتقاطعين بزاوية قائمة هما شارع «كانوبك» وشارع «سوما» وعرض كل منهما 14 متر، ومنهما تتفرع شوارع جانبية متوازية عرضها 7 أمتار،  وكان شارع «كانوبك» (شارع فؤاد حاليًا) يربط بوابة القمر من الغرب وبوابة الشمس من الشرق، ويمتد شرقًا ليربط مدينة كانوب (أبو قير)، وكان يتقاطع شارع سوما (شارع النبي دانيال حاليًا) مع شارع كانوبك ويمتد من الشمال للجنوب، وتقاطعهما كان مركز مدينة الإسكندرية.\nاتسعت الإسكندرية في القرن العشرين اتساعًا كبيرًا، وتوسّع العمران بها في الاتجاهين الشرقي والغربي خاصة، بالإضافة إلى الاتجاه الجنوبي. بالنسبة للتوسع نحو الجنوب فقد امتد العمران في منطقة محرم بك إلى ترعة المحمودية ومنطقة غيط العنب، وحاليًا توسعت المدينة نحو الشرق وساعد على ذلك وجود قطار أبو قير الذي ساعد في نمو العمران إلى مناطق سيدي بشر، المندرة، والمعمورة وصولاً إلى أبو قير،  أما التوسع نحو الغرب فشمل مناطق المكس والدخيلة والكيلو 21 وصولاً إلى سيدي كرير، حتى بلغ طول الشريط الساحلي للإسكندرية حوالي 55 كم،  كما توسعت المدينة جنوبًا حتى وصلت إلى مناطق الكافوري والعامرية وحدود محافظة البحيرة.\nتنقسم مدينة الإسكندرية حاليًا إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي:\n\nحي أول المنتزة يضم قسم أول المنتزة ويتبعه تسعة شياخات و96 قرية بتوابعها، ومن أهم مناطقه ميامي، سيدي بشر، فيكتوريا، والعوايد.\nحي ثان المنتزة يضم قسم ثان المنتزة، ويتبعه

السياحة، الزراعة، الصناعة، الصيد، شركات القطاع الخاص، الوظائف الحكومية، والأعمال الحرة والحرفية، ويتحدث السكان اللغة العربية باللهجة السكندرية، حيث تأثرت اللهجة والثقافة السكندرية بوجود عدد كبير من الأجانب في المدينة لأن معظم الأجانب مثل الإيطاليين واليونانيين كانوا كانوا يفضلون البقاء بالإسكندرية لتمتعها بمناخ حوض البحر المتوسط، ولعل من أبرز الكلمات الموجودة في اللهجة السكندرية كلمة \"مَنَفِيسْتُو\" ويُقصد بها الكتيبات الصغيرة جدًا التي يستخدمها التلاميذ وأصلها إيطالي، وكلمة \"جُومَة\" والمقصود بها الممحاة وأصلها كذلك إيطالي، وأيضاً كلمة \"مَسْتِيكَة\" والمقصود بها اللبان أو العلك، وأصلها إيطالي كذلك، بالإضافة إلى ذلك فهناك العديد من أحياء المدينة يعود أصل تسميتها لأشخاص أجانب عاشوا بالإسكندرية مثل لوران، جليم، سموحة، بولكلي، كرموز، راغب، ونجت، وفلمنج، كما يتحدث عدد من السكان اللهجة البدوية وهم الأفراد المنُحدرين من القبائل العربية، ويسكن أغلبهم بمناطق غرب الإسكندرية، وأيضًا العديد من الوافدين من المحافظات المصرية الأخرى والذين يتحدثون بلهجاتهم الأصلية، تعتبر الإسكندرية من أكثر المدن المصرية كثافة بالسكان نسبة إلى إجمالي مساحتها، حيث تبلغ الكثافة السكانية في المدينة حوالي 1997 نسمة للكيلو متر المربع، وبلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2024 حوالي 5,408,311 نسمة مُقسمين كالتالي:\n\nالثقافة\nتُعقد في الإسكندرية العديد من النشاطات الثقافية، السياحية، والسياسية خاصة بعد اختيارها كعاصمة الكتاب العالمية سنة 2002، وعاصمة الثقافة الإسلامية لسنة 2008،

الطفل، قصر التذوق، مركز الحرية للإبداع، قصر ثقافة الأنفوشي، قصر ثقافة سيدي جابر، قصر ثقافة أبوقير.\n\nالدين\nالإسلام\nيعتنق أغلب السكندريين الإسلام دينًا على منهج أهل السنة والجماعة، وقد انتشر الإسلام في المدينة انتشارًا كبيرًا بعد أن فتحها عمرو بن العاص في القرن السابع حتى طغى على المسيحية التي كانت سائدة قبل هذا، وتتميز الإسكندرية باحتضانها للعديد من المدارس والمنشآت الدينية الإسلامية وعشرات المساجد الكبيرة الأثرية والتي تتركز أغلبها في ميدان المساجد بحي الجمرك.\nومن أشهر المساجد الموجودة الإسكندرية مسجد أبو العباس المرسي، مسجد القائد إبراهيم، مسجد الشيخ إبراهيم، مسجد محمد كريم، مسجد الشيخ الشاطبي، مسجد العطارين، مسجد النبي دانيال، مسجد تربانة، مسجد الشوربجي، مسجد أبي الدرداء، مسجد عبد الرحمن بن هرمز، مسجد حاتم، مسجد سيدي بشر، مسجد المواساة، مسجد أحمد يحيى، مسجد البوصيري، بالإضافة إلى العديد من المساجد والزوايا المنتشرة في كافة أحياء المدينة.\n\nالمسيحية\nبعد أن أعلنت المسيحية ديانة رسمية للإمبراطورية الرومانية، أصبحت الإسكندرية مركزًا لبطريركية من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، بعد أن تقرر إنشائها في مجمع نيقية الأول سنة 451، وكان من ضمن الذين كتبوا قانون مجمع نيقة، أحد أبناء الكنيسة القبطية وهو البابا أثناسيوس بابا الإسكندرية الذي استمر على كرسيه لمدة 46 عامًا، وتُعدّ مدرسة الإسكندرية المسيحية أول مدرسة من نوعها في العالم، فبعد نشأتها سنة 190 على يد بنتينوس السكندرى، أصبحت مدرسة الإسكندرية أهم معهد للتعليم الديني في المسيحية. كثير من الأساقفة البارِزين من عِدَّة أنحاء في العالم تعلموا في تلك المدرسة، مثل أثيناغوارس، إكليمندس الإسكندري، ديديموس الضرير، وأوريجانوس الذي يُعتبر أب علم اللاهوت.\nيتبع معظم المسيحيين السكندريين الكنيسة القبطية الأرثوذكسية، وتعتبر الكاتدرائية المرقسية الكنيسة الأولى وفيها حسب التقليد رأس القديس مارمرقس الرسول، ويتبع بعضًا من المسيحيين الآخرين في المدينة كنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس، كما اعتنق عدد من السكان المذهب الكاثوليكي والبروتستانتي خلال القرن التاسع عشر عندما وصلت عدّة بعثات تبشيرية من أوروبا والولايات المتحدة إلى الشرق وعملت على نشر مذهبها، ويمثل أتباع هذه الكنائس اليوم أقلية مسيحية في الإسكندرية، ومن أشهر الكنائس القبطية في المدينة الكاتدرائية المرقسية، كاتدرائية سانت كاترين، كنيسة الأنبا تكلاهيمانوت، كنيسة السيدة العذراء ومارجرجس، كنيسة القديس سابا، كنيسة القديسين، وبطريركية الإسكندرية للروم الأرثوذكس، والعديد من الكنائس الأخرى في مختلف أحياء المدينة.\n\nاليهودية\nكانت الإسكندرية موطنًا كبيرًا للجالية اليهودية، لكنها اليوم في عداد المندثرة، خصوصًا بعد أن رحل الكثير من اليهود المصريين والأجانب إلى إسرائيل بعد قيامها، أو بسبب ترحيل البعض الآخر في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر إما لاتهامهم بالعمل الجاسوسي لصالح إسرائيل، أو بسبب الخوف من إقدامهم على ذلك، كان عدد يهود الإسكندرية في القرن التاسع عشر نحو أربعة آلاف يهودي، ووصل عددهم إلى ثمانية عشر ألفًا في أوائل القرن العشرين، وارتفع إلى أربعين ألفًا سنة 1948،  وكان نصف يهود الإسكندرية من اليهود المصريين والنصف الآخر ينقسم إلى ثلاثة أقسام أولهم اللادينو من سكان حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذين هاجروا من إسبانيا والثلث الثاني من يهود إيطاليا وشرقي أوروبا، والثلث الثالث من يهود المغرب والشرق الأوسط الذين يتحدثون العربية،  وفي أوائل عقد الثلاثينات من القرن العشرين هاجرت مجموعة من يهود السالونيك، النمسا، المجر، وبولندا إلى مصر هربًا من صعود النازية في ألمانيا،  ومن أشهر المعالم اليهودية الباقية في المدينة اليوم، كنيس إلياهو هانبي (بالعبرية: בית הכנסת אליהו הנביא)، الذي يقع في شارع النبي دانيال بوسط المدينة،  وهو مغلق حاليًا ولا يُستخدم في طقوس العبادة.\n\nالسياحة والآثار\nالمناطق الأثرية\nالمتاحف\nالقصور\nالخدمات\nالتعليم\nالتعليم قبل الجامعي\n\nتضم الإسكندرية عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس بكافة مراحلها التعليمية رياض الأطفال، الابتدائي، الإعدادي، والثانوي، وبمجالاته العامة والفنية والأزهرية، ويرتبط ذلك بارتفاع المستوى الثقافي والتعليمي للسكان خاصة فيما يتعلق بتعليم الأبناء، ففي العام الدراسي 2007 - 2008 بلغ عدد المدارس في نطاق مدينة الإسكندرية حوالي 1766 مدرسة، بها 19657 فصلاً تعليميًا، ويدرس بها حوالي 880337 طالبًا، منهم 428619 من البنات، و 451718 من

القنوات المتفرعة من الفرع الكانوبي لنهر النيل (فرع رشيد حاليًا)، ثم يتم تخزين هذه المياه في فترات الفيضان داخل صهاريج موزعة على عدة أماكن في المدينة لاستخدامها باقي العام، وخلال القرن 19 تم حصر عدد صهاريج المياه المستخدمة في الإسكندرية وبلغ عددها 119 صهريج، لم يتبقى منهم حاليًا سوى خمسة صهاريج هي صهريج ابن النبيه، ابن بطوطة، الباب الأخضر، دار إسماعيل، والمباهما، ولم تعرف المدينة نظام معالجة مياه الشرب وضخها بالأنابيب سوى سنة 1860 عندما تأسست شركتان للعمل في هذا المجال هما شركة ترشيح مياه الرمل وهي شركة متعددة الجنسيات، والشركة المدنية وهي شركة فرنسية تحولت فيما بعد إلى شركة إنجليزية ذات مسئولية محدودة تحت اسم \"شركة مياه الإسكندرية المحدودة\"، وحصلت على حق امتياز توصيل المياه بالأنابيب داخل الإسكندرية في مارس 1879، وظلت تعمل في ظل الإدارة الإنجليزية حتى تحولت إلى شركة مساهمة مصرية في يونيو 1958، وفي يوليو 1961 صدر قانون 117 لعام 1961 بتأميم الشركة وتحويل أسهمها إلى سندات حكومية وتحولت إلى إحدى الجهات التابعة لمحافظة الإسكندرية.\n\nبلغ طول شبكات توزيع المياه بمدينة الإسكندرية في

تغطية 89.8% من مناطق المدينة، ويعمل نظام الصرف الصحي في مدينة الإسكندرية من خلال عدة محطات معالجة الصرف الصحي تتبع شركة الصرف الصحي بالإسكندرية، أهمها محطة معالجة التنقية الشرقية: وتُعد أكبر محطة معالجة صرف صحي بالمدينة، بطاقة استيعابية 800 ألف متر مكعب يوميًا، وتصل طاقتها في حالات الطوارئ إلى 1.2 مليون متر مكعب يومياً، فهي تستقبل وتعالج وحدها ما يقرب من 40% من مياه الصرف الصحي بالمدينة، محطة معالجة الصرف الصحي بالعجمي بطاقة استيعابية 220 ألف متر مكعب يوميًا،  محطة معالجة الصرف الصحي بالمعمورة، ومحطة معالجة الصرف الصحي بالعامرية بطاقة استيعابية 100 ألف متر مكعب يوميًا.\n\nالكهرباء\nتُعد الإسكندرية ثاني مدينة مصرية يتم توصيل الكهرباء إليها بعد العاصمة القاهرة وذلك من خلال شركة ليبون الفرنسية، وأقيمت أول وحدة توليد كهرباء بخارية في الإسكندرية بمنطقة كرموز سنة 1895، كان المحامي الفرنسي مانولدي الذي يقطن في شارع صلاح سالم هو أول مشترك يصله التيار الكهرباء وذلك في 11 مايو 1895، وتوالى بعد ذلك دخول الكهرباء إلى المنازل، البنوك، الجمعيات، والقنصليات الموجودة بالمدينة، وكانت طريقة الحساب على استهلاك الكهرباء تم بناءً على عدد المصابيح الموجودة لدى المشتركين إلى أن تم تركيب عدادات الكهرباء.\nتتغذى مدينة الإسكندرية من الكهرباء من خلال شركة الإسكندرية لتوزيع الكهرباء، وتضم الإسكندرية خمسة محطات توليد كهرباء ويتبعها عدد من محطات المحولات المنتشرة في أحياء المدينة هي محطة كهرباء كرموز الغازية بقدرة تصميمية 23.5 ميجاواط، محطة كهرباء السيوف الغازية بقدرة تصميمية 33 ميجاواط، محطة كهرباء

      "content": "## Overview\nAlexandria (pronounced al-ig-ZAN-dree-uh ; Arabic: الإسكندرية ‎/ اسكندرية al-Iskandariyya / Eskendereyya ) is Egypt's second largest city (5.2 million people in 2018), its largest seaport, and the country's window onto the Mediterranean Sea. The city is a faded shadow of its former glorious cosmopolitan self, but still worth a visit for its many cultural attractions and still-palpable glimpses of its past.\n\n## History\nFew cities of the world have a history as rich as that of Alexandria; few cities have witnessed so many historic events and legends. Founded by Alexander the Great (Iskander al-Akbar) in 331 BCE, Alexandria became the capital of Greco-Roman Egypt; its status as a beacon of culture is symbolized by Pharos, the legendary lighthouse.\nThere had long been a fishing village here, called Rhakotis, but Alexander had greater plans for it. Its strategic value was obvious: it had a great natural harbour, a backing lagoon to prevent land attack, a fertile hinterland, and potential control of trade routes up the Nile and overland to the Red Sea and Arabia. But the approach to the harbour was tricky: the coastline and off-shore islands were low and without landmarks, so sailors could easily take the wrong channel and get wrecked on the shoals. To guide them in, Alexander's successors Ptolemy I & II built a lighthouse on the nearby island of Pharos. It stood just over 100 m tall, so only the Great Pyramids were taller. A bronze mirror atop it reflected sunlight by day, and by night the flames of oil-soaked sheep fleeces. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the name of the island \"Pharos\" came to apply to all subsequent lighthouses, and spawned modern words such as \"phares\" in French.\nA jetty over 1 km long was built to connect Pharos to the mainland, dividing the bay into an eastern and western harbour. Silt and landfill built up along the jetty so it broadened into a peninsula, the present-day district of Anfushi. The lighthouse was badly damaged by earthquakes in 956, 1303 and 1323, then fell into disuse and disrepair. In 1480 Sultan Qaitbey used the ruined stone to build his fortress here. The rest of it was eaten by coastal erosion, and came to lie on the sea-bed. But a combination of ancient descriptions, modern marine archaeology and satellite imaging give us a detailed picture of it.\nAlexandria under Ptolemy I & II prospered not just through trading, but as a knowledge economy. They set out to acquire and understand every manuscript they could. Arriving ships were searched, and any manuscripts seized and copied onto papyrus. In the great Library of Alexandria texts were translated, catalogued and studied. Scholars, philosophers and scientists flocked to work on these texts, and to create new material. Just one example of their creative output was the Septuagint, the first Greek translation of Hebrew holy texts that became the Christian Bible Old Testament.\nTrade and knowledge made Alexandria cosmopolitan, with the largest Jewish populations and Hellenistic cultures anywhere. It retained its importance, and was capital of Egypt, while power was shifting elsewhere: the rise and decline of Rome, the rise of Byzantium, and growth of Persia. But the city suffered natural disasters (eg the tsunami of 365 CE) and a series of wars (particularly against Rome), and the library was destroyed. When the Arabs conquered Egypt in 641 CE they founded a new capital to the south in Fustat, now Cairo. Politically, economically and intellectually, Alexandria was no longer the place to be.\nAlexandria survived as a trading port; Marco Polo described it around 1300 as one of the world's two busiest ports, along with Quanzhou. However, its strategic location meant that every army on its way to Egypt passed through: Napoleon's troops stormed the city in 1798, but the British conquered it in the Siege of Alexandria in 1801. The Egyptians under Mohammed Ali took control of the city and rebuilt it, but the Orabi Rebellion in 1881 and massacres of Europeans in the city led the British to strike back and hammer the rebels with the three-day Bombardment of Alexandria, reducing much of the city center to rubble.\nOnce again, Alexandria rose from the ashes. Its cosmopolitan and decadent lifestyle before and during World War II gave birth to its greatest poet, Constantine P. Cavafy, and was chronicled in Laurence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet and a series of works by E.M. Forster including Alexandria: A History and Guide (1922), described by some as the best travel guide ever written.\nYet this world, too, took a shattering blow in the 1950s when Egypt's new fiercely nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized vast swathes of the economy and forbade foreigners from owning or running companies. This forced tens of thousands of foreigners out of the country, including virtually all of Alexandria's once 150,000-strong Greek community. Alexandria thus ceased to be a cosmopolitan city.\nToday's Alexandria is a dusty seaside Egyptian town with miles of tatty low-rise and 'burbs holding its population of 5 million, yet its status as Egypt's leading port keeps business humming, and tourists still flock to the beaches in the summertime. And while much of the city is badly in need of major repair, its history is still evident: the French-style parks and the occasional French street sign survive as a legacy of Napoleon, and the few remaining Greek restaurants and cafés still do a good trade.\n\n## Climate\nAlexandria has a hot desert climate (BWh), but highly influenced by sea breeze, with sunny hot humid summers and mild moderately wet winters. The daytime can be humid in summer, with summer temperatures averaging 31 °C (88 °F), but evenings are usually cooler and breezy, especially by the Corniche. Winters can get cold, with daytime highs down sometimes to 12 °C (53 °F), with occasional rain and sometimes hail. Humidity is high throughout the year. The best time to visit Alexandria is in spring (March–June) and autumn (September–November). It's at its busiest in summer, when Egyptians flock down to escape the searing heat of Cairo.\n\n## Orientation\nAlexandria is a long thin city, pinched between the swampy delta and the sea. Its east-west artery, the Corniche, rolls on for about 30 km. However the advantage to the visitor is that all transport is funnelled along this corridor, so you shouldn't wait more than a minute for a taxi, buses or microbus going your way. The tram line runs parallel a block or two further inland.\nAt the western tip lies the Citadel of Qaitbey, built near (and from) the ruined ancient lighthouse or Pharos. The Corniche then sweeps around the eastern harbour, with Anfushi the tongue of land behind it, to the central hotel area around Saad Zaghloul; then passes the east end of the harbour at the jetty opposite the new library. Almost all the sights, and the bulk of the accommodation and restaurants, are along this congested 5-6 km strip or nearby. But on and on eastwards rolls the Corniche through rundown beachfront districts of Rushdy, San Stefano and Mandarah. The blingy hotels of Montazah are a bright spot then the tat, burbs and ribbon-development resume, out to Aboukir.\n\n## Tourist offices\nEgyptian Tourist Authority. \n  Raml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556. \n  Nuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527. \n  Borg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119. \n  Marine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494. \n  Misr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985. \n  Sidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\nRaml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556.\nNuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527.\nBorg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119.\nMarine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494.\nMisr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985.\nSidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\nRaml Station, Saad Zaghlui Squ, ☏ +20 3 485 1556.\nNuza Airport, ☏ +20 3 4250 526, +20 3 4250 527.\nBorg El Arab Airport, ☏ +20 3 4485119.\nMarine Passenger Station, ☏ +20 3 4803494.\nMisr Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 3925985.\nSidi Gaber Railway Station, ☏ +20 3 4263953.\n\n## By plane\nAlexandria has domestic flights daily from Cairo, Luxor, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh, with Egyptair the main operator. Saudia Airlines fly from Jeddah and the Gulf States, and Turkish Airlines fly from Istanbul. Flights from Italy by Wizz Air have ended as of June 2023. And all of airlines of the country including: Air Cairo Air Arabia Nile Air FlyEgypt and Petroleum air services (PAS).\n30.91777829.6963891 Borg el Arab Airport (HBE  IATA). All flights into Alexandria use this airport 45 km southwest of downtown. It's small but modern, ample for the low passenger numbers it now handles. Cafe and clean toilets and that's about all. There is no public transport - a taxi downtown will take 60-90 min, and reckon at least LE400 as they've no competition.      (updated Oct 2021)\nCairo (CAI IATA) is the main portal of entry into Egypt and you travel onwards overland. The Cairo-Alex flight only makes sense as a connection with another flight.\n\n## By train\nTrain is the easiest way to travel between central Cairo and Alexandria, with 30 services a day. Best of these are the \"Specials\", running non-stop and taking 2 hr 40 min; almost as good are the \"Express\" services taking around 3 hours (usually stopping only in Tanta on the way). These trains are clean and comfortable, air-conditioned, and with snacks available. For foreigners, one-way AC2 tickets cost 35USD and AC1 tickets cost 40USD (+ 1USD if you pay by credit card) (October 2025). The fast trains are sometimes also called Spanish, French or Turbo because of their rolling stock. See \"Egypt#get around by train\" for how to buy tickets.\nTrains from Cairo all depart from Ramses Station. In Alexandria they arrive downtown at 31.19333329.9063062 Misr station , where taxis and microbuses are waiting, or a 15-min stroll north along Nabi Daniel St brings you onto the Corniche. Nabi Daniel is a street market and closed to traffic, so taxis use the parallel Saad Zaghlool St.\nBut when your \"non-stop\" train arrives, and everyone piles out, ask around before following. You may have stopped 3 km east at 31.21937129.9427873 Sidi Gaber station  on Abu Qir St at the top of Mushir Ahmad Ismail St. Only get off here if you're heading for an eastern district such as San Stefano. Otherwise sit tight, and in a couple of minutes the train will rumble on and terminate at Misr Station.\nTrains to Alexandria also run from Marsa Matruh and the delta towns. These are slower \"ordinary\" trains and you buy your ticket at the station. Some trains run directly from Luxor via Cairo, but these too are slow \"ordinary\" trains, and you're better taking fast trains and changing in Cairo.\n\n## By bus\nThere are a variety of local bus services which have improved significantly in the past few years, but they are rather confusing for those who haven't lived in Alexandria for a while. Apart from city buses, you will also find \"mini-buses\", which work on hop-and-go basis. They are easily recognizable 14-person buses, which will stop when you wave and stop where you need to get off. The drivers rarely speak English, so make sure you know the Arabic name of your destination or that you already know where to stop. The routes are usually along the main streets, with drivers following well-known routes. The routes are written in Arabic on the sides of the vehicle, but even if you speak Arabic this may not be helpful; the drivers sometimes change routes without changing their signage. However, if you remain in Alexandria for some time you may learn the somewhat elaborate system of hand signals the locals have devised to indicate the desired destination.\n\n## By minibus\nYou can take a minibus from Cairo for about LE140 (October 2025). These wait just the the west of Ramsis Station in Cairo; look for the white vans and listen for shouts of “Alexandria!” to find the right vehicle. The minibuses will leave when full. While this is your cheapest option from most departure points, know that the minibuses can be hot and cramped, and your driver will likely drive like a mad person, so take them at your own risk.\n\n## By car\nThere are two roads between Cairo and Alexandria, both taking 3 hours. The usual cautions for driving in Egypt apply; see Egypt#By car.\nAgriculture Road has a speed limit of 90 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. This is the main road, so it can get a little crowded. It also gives access to Damnhour and Tanta.\nDesert Road has a speed limit of 100 km/hr for private cars and has 4 lanes in each direction. True to the name, this crosses the desert and is less crowded and faster. There are cafes every few km.\n\n## By boat\nAlex remains a major sea port, but all international passenger services are axed because of this region's turmoil and loss of tourist traffic. It may still be possible to arrange freighter travel, but with so many migrants trying to reach Europe from the Middle East by sea in the 21st century, they will be very wary about taking you. So your best bet may be to call in a favour from a friend with a gin-palace private yacht.\nThe Med cruise liners seldom visit here nowadays. Nile cruises still call at Alexandria, Cairo and the ancient Egyptian sites up to Luxor and Aswan. But all of these are package tourist itineraries, and not available to book as point-to-point ferries.\n\n## Get around\nAlexandria is a long, long city but there's good transport along the Corniche. It also extends several km inland past the lagoons, but you've no reason to go that way.\n\n## By taxi\nAlexandria's yellow and black taxis are a good way to travel in the city, and a cheap one as well. Be careful though: taxis will uniformly refuse to use meters (the rates haven't been adjusted in years) and drivers love to take advantage of non-Alexandrians (both foreign and Egyptian), so it's best to agree on the fare before you get in. If you are on a day trip to Alexandria, hire a taxi outside the railway station for the day.\nTo get into a taxi, wave at the driver and yell the name of your destination. If the driver agrees they would park at the side of the road as soon as possible. Some taxis will stop to pick you up even if they already have a passenger, but such offers are best refused. Furthermore, always check back once you get out of the taxi, there is no number to call if you lose anything of value, and nearly no chances of having it returned.\nCareem and Uber operate in Alexandria. Careem requires an Egyptian phone number.\n\n## By tram\nAlexandria has a creaky, slow but very cheap tram system that dates back to 1860 and looks the part — it's the oldest one still running in Africa. The route map is remarkably confusing and changes on a regular basis, but one factor stays constant: the network is split into the interurban Ramleh Lines (Tram el-Raml), which use blue-and-cream trams and run across the city a few blocks back from the sea towards the eastern suburbs, and the City Lines (Tram el-Madina), which use bright yellow trams and run west and south of central Alex. The two meet at Raml Station (محطة الرمل Mahattat el-Raml), right at the heart of Alex. In general, the Ramleh Lines are relatively quick despite their age, as they have substantial stretches of dedicated and uninterrupted right-of-way; the City Lines, however, frequently get stuck in traffic.\nFor both lines, the flat fare is LE1, bought on board. Note that the first car (out of three) in the blue trams is reserved for women only. The lines run until 1AM, every 10-30 min or so.\nProbably the most useful service for tourists is yellow tram #25, which runs from Raml Station to Ras el-Tin and Fort Qait Bey. You can also hop on any blue tram west from Sidr Gabr bus/railway station to get to Raml, but not all eastbound trams stop there.\n\n## Historical monuments\n31.21329.88521 Citadel of Qaitbay, Ras el-Tin (yellow tram or microbus to Anfushi), ☏ +20 3-4809144. 9:00-20:00. Set on the tip of the Anfushi/Pharos promontory, looking back over the eastern harbour and downtown Corniche. It was built by Mameluke Sultan Abdul-Nasser Qa'it Bay in 1477 CE, by re-cycling the stone of the ruined lighthouse. It tried (with limited success) to defend the city against invaders, from crusaders to Napoleon, and was in military use as late as 1882, when the British bombarded it. There are two entrances and admissions. West, facing your approach along the Harbour mall, is the ground-floor Maritime Museum - this is of little interest. (Its collection continues in a building on the mall.) Come round to the south flank facing the Corniche for the main entrance into the Citadel. There's a fortified courtyard, then a 4-storey bastion. Citadel LE150 for foreigners and LE60 for Egyptians and Arabs.      (updated Oct 2024)\n31.2308729.94722 Mostafa Kamel Necropolis (Mustafa Kamel Cemetery/Tombs). The cemetery includes four tombs dating from the 2nd century BC, all of which are in excellent condition and beautifully decorated. The cemetery bears the name of Mostafa Kamel, one of 20th century Egyptian politics' greatest legends. It was he who pronounced the famous phrase: \"If I were not born an Egyptian, I would like to be an Egyptian.\" As of October 2025, the site is closed for renovations.     (updated Oct 2025)\n31.18694429.9047223 Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, Carmouz district, south of Anfushi. 9:00-16:00. These catacombs were probably carved out to be a single wealthy family's mausoleum, and later expanded to take other elite funerals, from the 2nd to 4th century CE. The name \"Kom el-Shoqafa\" means \"mound of shards\" as people brought offerings to the dead here in earthenware bowls, then smashed the empties before returning home. They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels (the lowest now flooded by groundwater) for the funeral rituals and entombment. The place was discovered in 1900 when the ground gave way under a donkey. Built as a separate (and older) catacomb, the Hall of Caracalla became linked when energetic tomb-robbers tunnelled through. It seems to have been a burial place for the Roman emperor's horses, as horse bones predominate. No, not the donkey's. The catacombs are interesting for their plan and for their decoration, as the last of the pharonic burials transitioned into Grecian and Roman styles. But if you've seen the richly decorated burial chambers around Luxor, this one will suffer by comparison. LE150 for foreigners and LE30 for Egyptians.

Daily. \"Kom el-Dikka\" means \"pile of rubble\" - so much for the grandeur of the Roman Empire. In Ptolemaic times this area was the Park of Pan, a pleasure garden surrounded by villas and baths. Highlights built in the 2nd century CE are the Villa of the Birds, with fine mosaics, and Egypt's only Roman amphitheatre. This has 13 semicircular tiers made of white and grey marble, with seats for up to 800 spectators, galleries and sections of mosaic-flooring. Excavations continue, and in 2010 a Ptolemaic temple was unearthed. You can see the amphitheatre well enough just by peering through the railings, but you'll have to pay to get inside to see the mosaics and other small artefacts. LE150 for foreigners.

Opened in 1902, this is one of Alexandria's two grand old hotels (the Cecil is the other). It has been partly renovated, keeping the turn-of-the-century style. It's on Alexandria's main street, handy for sightseeing but lower floor rooms (especially at the back) can be noisy. The food is nothing special but the views from the rooftop restaurant make it special. B&B double LE1500.

Daily 7AM-11PM.\n\n## Bars\nTime was, way back, when a maze of bars and nightclubs filled the city. They're now mostly confined to the hotels, with few free-standing bars. Still, enough remain for visitors to get squiffy recalling their days on General Auchinleck's staff, eyes swivelling independently upwards to recreate the effect of an old ceiling fan.\n31.198129.89558 Spitfire Bar, 7 Old Borsa Street, Mansheya (off Saad Zaghloul Street before Cherry Maryski Hotel). Daily 4PM-midnight. Cheerful bar with food a short block off the main downtown street. \"Atmospheric\", meaning the building looks derelict, but persevere.

The most central branch on Saad Zaghloul Square is open daily noon-2AM.\nSan Giovanni Club within that hotel has live music, singers and oriental dancers until late.\n\n## Sleep\nAccommodation in Alexandria has quite a different feel due to the old buildings with sometimes nice colonial style lobbies. There is a good selection of hotels in all price ranges.\n\n## Apartments\nFor stays of a month or more, consider renting. Apartments are easy to come by, in a range of prices (LE180-1000 per week) and states of repair. Landlords/ladies tend to live in the same blocks and will be willing to haggle the rates. It's definitely worth visiting an apartment before placing any money down, preferably in late afternoon so you see how well the lighting works and the worst of any insect problems. (It's very unlikely to find any accommodation near the coast that's completely roach-free!)\n\n## Stay safe\nAlthough crime is rarely violent, beware of pickpockets and don't flash your valuables or wear a bum bag or fanny pack. Street kids, taxi drivers, and others may harass tourists. They will usually desist after a stern \"La!\" or two. Or you can say \"la shukran!\" (no thanks) or \"emshi\" (go!).\nAlexandria is a conservative city, so women should cover their shoulders, midriffs, cleavage and legs. Even still, women can expect to be heckled or harassed in the street, especially if walking alone. The best response is to ignore the offender and pretend you don't hear anything. Cover your head when entering places of worship.\n\n## Emergency\nEmergency number: 123\nPolice number: 122\nFire HQ number: 180\nMilitary Police hotline: 16039 or 19039\nCentral Ambulance, Kom El Dekka (opposite Alexandria Station), ☏ +20 3-4922257.\n31.20336129.9276398 El Moassa Hospital, El Horreya Rd., El Hadara, ☏ +20 3-4212885, +20 3-4212886, +20 3-4212887, +20 3-4212888.\nEl Shatby Hospital, Dr. Hassan Sobhy St., El Shatby, ☏ +20 3-4871586.\nMedical Research Institute, El Horreya Rd.
