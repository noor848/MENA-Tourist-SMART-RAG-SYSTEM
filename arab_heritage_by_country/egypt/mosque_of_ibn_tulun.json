      "content": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and early history\nThe mosque was commissioned by Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Abbasid governor of Egypt from 868 to 884. He was able to establish himself as a de facto autonomous ruler over Egypt and parts of the Levant. In 870, he began construction on a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i. It was located a short distance to the northwest of Fustat (the first Muslim capital of Egypt and its main city) and al-'Askar (the second capital built nearby by the Abbasids).\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque was built to serve as al-Qata'i's congregational mosque. It was the third congregational mosque to be built in what is now Cairo, after the Mosque of 'Amr and the main mosque of al-'Askar. The medieval historian al-Maqrizi states that its construction started in 876 CE, while an original inscription slab found in the mosque identifies the date of completion as Ramadan 265 AH, corresponding to April–May 879 CE. According to Balawi, a 10th-century author, the architect of the mosque was a man named al-Nasrani, a non-Muslim, possibly Christian, who had previously designed the Aqueduct of Basatin, another of Ibn Tulun's construction projects in the area.\nThe mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, \"The Hill of Thanksgiving.\" One local legend says that it is here that Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat. Ibn Tulun's administrative palace, the Dar al-Imara, adjoined the mosque directly on its southeastern side, behind the qibla wall. Ibn Tulun was able to enter his mosque directly from the Dar al-Imara via a doorway that can still be seen to the right of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla).\nAl-Qata'i was eventually razed to the ground in 905 by the Abbasid general Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who was sent to retake control of Egypt. Only the mosque and the adjoining Dar al-Imara were left standing. The mosque was spared because of its religious function while the palace was re-used by the subsequent Ikhshidid governors as an administrative center. Today, the mosque is the only surviving monument of this city.\n\nLater history\nThe mosque and the palace continued to see some use during the Fatimid period (after 969) and the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz is recorded as having ordered some construction in the mosque in 1132, though it is unclear what work was done. The original fountain (fawara) in the center of the mosque's courtyard, which had previously burned down, was rebuilt on the orders of Caliph al-'Aziz in 995. The mosque and the area around it declined further in the following century. Part of the mosque was burned during riots in 1067. Badr al-Jamali (d. 1094), the powerful Fatimid vizier, restored the mosque, as indicated by the inscription he placed above what is still the main entrance to the mosque today. Badr al-Jamali's son and successor, al-Afdal Shahinshah, added a flat stucco mihrab to one of the prayer hall's piers in 1094.\n\nBy the 12th century, the mosque was being used as a caravanserai for North African pilgrims on their way to the Hijaz. After the assassination of the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–1293), one of the accomplices in the murder, Lajin, hid inside the mosque, by which time the building had fallen into ruin. Mamluk-era writers report that Lajin hid inside the ruins of the original minaret, spent a miserable year there, and vowed that if God saved him and allowed him to become sultan he would restore the mosque. When he later became sultan (r. 1296–1299), he fulfilled this pledge and initiated a major restoration of the mosque in 1296. Lajin's works, many of which remain today, included renovating the main mihrab's decoration, building the dome in front of it, adding a new wooden minbar (pulpit), renovating the minaret, and building the present-day fountain in the center of the courtyard and the domed structure over it.\nIn 1524, a zawiya (Sufi convent) and tomb were built next to the minaret and are mentioned by historical sources as associated with a founder named either Sheikh Sharaf al-Din al-Madini or Sheikh al-Bushi. Its ruined remains were demolished in 1943.\nAt some point during the reign of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century, the mosque was turned into a military hospital and then a salt warehouse. A blacksmith workshop was also installed in it. In 1846, Clot Bey received permission from Muhammad Ali to convert it into a mental asylum and sometime after this it became a poorhouse. During the conversion, Clot Bey ordered some of the arches around the mosque's courtyard to be walled up, an act which was criticized as vandalism by some 19th-century writers who visited the site afterwards.\n\nAs a result of these different uses, the building deteriorated severely in the 19th century  Some of the arches of the prayer hall along the courtyard façade collapsed in 1877. The mosque continued to be neglected in this manner until 1880, when architect Julius Franz Pasha, the head of the government's Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe ('Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of Arab Art'), closed the building and evicted its inhabitants. After this, it was examined by the Comité and assessed for repairs. Damage to the ceiling, arches, and minbar were all reported, among other problems. Recommendations were made to remove the walls blocking the arches and demolish the ad hoc structures that had been constructed inside the mosque by its poor inhabitants.\n\nAfter another examination in 1890, the Comité began restoration work. Various works were undertaken over the following years, though not enough to resolve all problems. The ceiling over the prayer hall continued to progressively fall apart, along with its arches facing the courtyard. A major event was the visit of King Fuad I, who attended Friday prayers in the mosque on 3 May 1918, the first ruler of Egypt to do so since Sultan Lajin. He subsequently took an interest in the mosque's maintenance and ordered the expropriation and removal of structures encroaching on it. In the following decade, efforts continued to remove encroaching structures and clear rubble. The Comité finally reconstructed the mosque's ceiling in 1927 and in the following two years it reconstructed the damaged arches of the prayer hall. Repair works continued intermittently after this, including the reconstruction of the westernmost walls of the ziyada (outer enclosure) from 1947 to 1948.\n\nThe Comité was dissolved in 1961 and the mosque, like other Islamic-era monuments in Cairo, was neglected for a time after this. Restoration efforts were resumed in 1978 by the government's Egyptian Antiquities Organization. While the mosque did not suffer greatly from the 1992 Cairo earthquake, the top of the minaret was damaged and its integrity compromised, which elicited the installation of scaffolding to support it.\n\nThe mosque underwent a full restoration from 2002 to 2004, which cost 2.5 million US dollars. One of the significant changes to the mosque's appearance was the paving of the entire courtyard with stone, as it had previously been largely unpaved. This had the negative side effect of causing humidity to accumulate along the walls, which were then injected with a consolidant. This action and other aspects of the restoration project were questioned and criticized by some scholars of Islamic architecture, including Caroline Williams.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque is the oldest mosque in Egypt to largely retain its original form. Its architectural style is closely modeled on that of the Abbasid capital of the time, Samarra, where Ibn Tulun had spent much of his early career before being sent to Egypt. As a result, the mosque is one of the best surviving examples of the Abbasid architectural style of this period, which was dominated by the influence of Samarra. The mosque is one of the largest in Egypt by area: including its outer enclosure (ziyada), it occupies 26,318 square metres (283,280 sq ft). It is built primarily out of brick, except for the minaret, which is built of stone.\n\nExterior\nAn outer enclosure, the ziyada, surrounds the mosque on three sides and provided a buffer between the prayer space and the surrounding urban environment. The mosque's minaret stands in this enclosure on the northwest side. Originally, the mosque's ziyada contained ablutions facilities, latrines, and a medical clinic. The outer walls of the ziyada were likely adjoined by shops and neighbourhood markets. In the early 20th century, any market structures that were still adjoining the outer walls were removed.\n\nThe mosque had a total of twenty-two entrances: nineteen entrances through the ziyada (with doorways in the outer wall corresponding to doorways into the mosque proper) and another three doorways in the qibla (southeastern) wall. Only one entrance is used by visitors today. Unlike in later Egyptian mosques, none of the entrances are given architectural prominence, as this was not a feature of mosque architecture in Egypt until the later Fatimid period. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque are both topped by decorative crenellations consisting of brick openwork whose form, vaguely reminiscent of linked human figures, is likely derived from the decorative motifs inside the mosque.\n\nInterior\nOn the inside, the mosque consists of a spacious central courtyard (sahn) surrounded on four sides by roofed halls or galleries (riwaqs) divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches supported on piers. On the qibla side, this roofed area forms the main prayer hall and is five aisles deep, while the other three wings around the courtyard are two aisles deep. The arches and piers are built of brick and uphold a wooden roof built with palm. The corners of the piers are rounded by engaged columns. The upper parts of the piers, between the arches, are pierced with pointed windows that have their own colonettes.\nA dikka (raised platform for muezzins and Qur'an reciters) is located between two piers in the center of the prayer hall. It most likely dates to the Mamluk period. Next to the main mihrab (the concave niche in the qibla wall) is a wooden minbar, a pulpit for the imam, consisting of a wooden staircase leading to small kiosk-like structure topped by a curving finial. The inscription on the minbar attributes it to Sultan Lajin and dates it to 1296. It is an excellent example of early Mamluk-period woodwork.\n\nDecoration and inscriptions\nThe outlines of the arches, their intrados (undersides), and the capitals of the engaged columns are covered with carved stucco decoration, although only the arches of the southwestern side still preserve most of their intrados decoration. This decoration features geometric and floral patterns. They are derived from the Abbasid style associated with Samarra in this period, particularly those known to scholars as the \"Samarra B\" and \"Samarra C\" styles. Originally, this stucco decoration would have been painted in vivid colours, but the paint has since faded away. On the courtyard façades, the windows between the arches are also flanked by decorative rosettes. \nThe 128 windows of the mosque are also outlined with similar stucco decoration and are covered by stucco grilles. The window grilles seen today have a variety of geometric designs and date from different periods and restorations. Three or four of them are still original, from Ibn Tulun's time, and feature the simplest designs. The rest, with more complex designs, are from later restorations, including at least six from the Mamluk restoration of 1296.\n\nA long inscription on a wooden frieze runs just below the ceiling around the walls of the entire mosque, although much of it has disappeared over time and the frieze is now fragmented throughout the mosque. The inscription is carved in Kufic letters and is nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long in total. It replicates verses from the Qur'an, totaling to around one fifteenth of the entire book. The inscription is unusual for its time and it makes the Ibn Tulun Mosque the oldest surviving Islamic monument to contain religious inscriptions of such length.\n\nMihrabs (prayer niches)\nThe mosque contains six mihrabs (niches symbolizing the qibla or direction of prayer) at the mosque, five of which are flat as opposed to the main niche, which is concave. The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It dates from the Tulunid period but was redecorated under Sultan Lajin. The carved stucco decoration around the niche still dates from the Tulunid period, as do the pairs of marble columns with Coptic-style capitals on either side of the niche. Above the niche is a wooden frieze carved with a Kufic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim declaration of faith) followed by a blessing. Above this is a panel of wood with traces of faded painted decoration. The decoration inside the niche dates from Sultan Lajin's restoration. The upper zone is made of painted wood whose decoration has deteriorated, while the lower zone is covered in marble paneling that is characteristic of Mamluk decoration. In between these two zones is a wide band of glass mosaic containing an inscription of the Shahada in Naskhi script.\nThe other mihrabs in the prayer hall, all flat instead of concave, are the following:\n\nThe same qibla wall also features a smaller stucco mihrab to the left of the main niche. Its muqarnas sculpting and Naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin.\nThe two mihrabs on the piers flanking the dikka are decorated in the Samarran style, with one containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kufic Shahada inscriptions on both do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shi'a Fatimids came to power.\nThe westernmost mihrab, installed by al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with influences from Persia. The Kufic inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, on whose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shi'a Shahada including Ali as God's wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.\nOn the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdal's mihrab. It differs, however, by referring to Sultan Lajin instead of al-Mustansir, and a lack of Ali's name.\n\nFountain\nIn the center of the courtyard is a fountain (fisqiya) used for ablutions. It is sheltered by a square kiosk that is open through arches on all four sides, built in stone, and covered by a dome, built in brick. This dates to the restoration of Sultan Lajin in 1296, confirmed by a wooden inscription (now partially faded) in an upper corner on the outer wall of the kiosk. \nThe original Tulunid fountain of the mosque, referred to as a fawwāra, was covered by a dome resting on ten columns and surrounded by another sixteen columns. The columns were made of gilded marble. This structure burned down, most likely in the late 10th century, before it was replaced by another.\nThe present-day fountain consists of an octagonal stone basin on the floor. It was formerly surrounded by a marble floor which has since been replaced by modern pavement. The squinches inside the dome are executed in muqarnas (\"stalactite\"-style sculpting). Above the muqarnas is an inscription band carved in stucco containing part of Surah 4:43 from the Qur'an. At the apex of the dome is a circular medallion of carved stucco containing another inscription, of Surah 5:6. The outer walls of the kiosk were crowned by stepped crenellations that have disappeared.\nInside the northeastern wall, which is thicker than the others, is a small staircase that once led to a small room built on top of the wall, at the same level as the drum of the dome. This room, of unclear purpose and origin, could still be seen in 19th-century photos but was removed in the early 20th century. A sundial that once existed in the kiosk, mentioned in Sultan Lajin's inscription and recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, may have been associated with this room. This feature suggests that the room was intended for use by the timekeeper of the mosque.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret is unusual in form. It consists of a rectangular (cuboid) shaft at the base, followed by a cylindrical section. An external staircase wraps around both sections in a spiral fashion. The shaft is crowned by a lantern-like summit, sometimes described as a mabkhara, with a ribbed dome. The tower is connected to the wall of the mosque by a bridge with horseshoe arches.\nThere is scholarly controversy over the construction date of the minaret. Historical records attest that the original minaret built under Ibn Tulun had an external staircase, which recalls the design of the helicoidal or spiral minarets in Abbasid Samarra (such as the Malwiya). The minarets of Samarra were thus probably the inspiration for its design. At least one historical source, Ibn Duqmaq, claimed that the staircase was wide enough to accommodate two camels. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his officials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his finger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing his minaret. Architectural historian Tarek Swelim argues that the original minaret was probably aligned with the central axis of the building, like other Abbasid minarets from the 9th century, instead of the current tower's location.\n\nMany of the architectural features in the current structure, however, point to a later construction. The design of the minaret's top level, in the characteristic mabkhara-style, is of early Mamluk style, while the horseshoe arches and corbels look to be of 13th-century Andalusi inspiration. The fact that it is built of stone instead of brick is inconsistent with the rest of the mosque. Moreover, the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time.\nArchitectural historians have drawn varying conclusions. K. A. C. Creswell argued that the entire structure of the present minaret is a reconstruction by Mamluk sultan Lajin from the 1296 restoration and that it was inspired by the original Tulunid spiral minaret. Jonathan Bloom suggests that the original minaret may have disappeared by the second half of the 12th century and that it was rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century. Doris Behrens-Abouseif argues that the structure instead shows evidence of multiple construction phases and that the original Tulunid minaret mostly survived but was then restored by Sultan Lajin, who added some of the present-day elements. She notes that the main shaft does not resemble any Mamluk-era minarets and that this would be unlikely if Lajin had rebuilt it completely. She also points out that one 10th-century source, al-Muqaddasi, states that the Tulunid minaret was indeed built of stone and notes that no sources mention its demolition or disappearance. Tarek Swelim suggests that the original minaret was damaged and at some point was replaced by a minaret with the present-day rectangular base, built next to the original. He suggests that the circular portion of the shaft was perhaps added during the Ayyubid period (late 12th to early 13th centuries) and then the top level was added by Lajin.\nHistorical sources and early 19th-century illustrations indicate that the minaret was previously topped by an unusual copper finial in the shape of a boat. This finial was possibly replaced by a similar one at some point before the 1840s but it must have disappeared sometime between 1800, when it was last noted, and 1892, when it was replaced by a crescent-shaped finial.\n\nAdjacent structures\nAt the southwestern corner of the mosque, standing within the ziyada, is a sabil-maktab or sabil-kuttab (structure combining a sabil and maktab). This structure has been attributed to either Sultan Lajin in 1296 or to Sultan Qaytbay between 1462 and 1482. Tarek Swelim suggests that it was most likely built first by Lajin and then restored by Qaytbay. \nAt the southeastern corner of the mosque, located outside the ziyada and on the site of the former Dar al-Imara, is a pair of historic mansions, connected by a bridge, which became known as Bayt al-Kritliya. They were built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The complex now serves as the Gayer-Anderson Museum. Another structure outside the ziyada, adjoining its outer wall on the northwest side, is the Madrasa of Amir Sarghatmish, built around 1350.\n\nIn popular culture\nParts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the mosque. The mosque is featured in the game Serious Sam 3: BFE, forming a significant part of the game's third level. It is also featured in a level of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation.\n\nThe front of the Egyptian five-pound banknote has been adorned with an illustration of the Ibn Tulun Mosque in multiple editions. Meanwhile, the back of the current banknote features an image of a Pharaonic painting.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nBehrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989).

القطائع ليصبح ثالث مسجد جامع بني في عاصمة مصر الإسلامية بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي بني في الفسطاط، وجامع العسكر الذي بني في مدينة العسكر ورغم أن مسجد عمرو بن العاص لا يزال موجودًا إلا أن المسجد الطولوني يعد أقدم مساجد مصر القائمة حتى الآن لاحتفاظه بحالته الأصلية بالمقارنة مع مسجد عمرو بن العاص الذي توالت عليه الإصلاحات التي غيرت معالمه.\nشُيد المسجد فوق ربوة صخرية كانت تعرف بجبل يشكر، ويُعتبر من المساجد المعلقة، وهو أحد أكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات الخارجية حوالي ستة أفدنة ونصف الفدان، وقد بُني على شكل مربع مستلهمًا من طرز المساجد العباسية وخاصة مسجد سامراء بالعراق الذي استلهم منه المنارة الملوية. يقع المسجد حاليًا بميدان أحمد بن طولون بحي السيدة زينب التابع للمنطقة الجنوبية بالقاهرة، ويجاور سوره الغربي مسجد صرغتمش الناصري فيما يجاور سوره الشرقي متحف جاير أندرسون.\n\nالمنشئ\nمنشئ المسجد هو أحمد بن طولون مؤسس الدولة الطولونية في مصر والشام، تعود أصوله إلى قبيلة التغزغز التركية، وكانت أُسرته تقيم في بخاري. كان والده «طولون» مملوكًا لنوح بن أسد الساماني عامل بخارى وخراسان، فأرسله هدية إلى الخليفة المأمون مع من أُرسل من المماليك الترك سنة 200هـ/816م. واسم طولون مشتق من كلمة تركية (بالتركية: Tolun) معناها البدر الكامل. أنجب طولون عددًا من الأبناء من بينهم أحمد الذي يكنى بأبي العباس سنة 220هـ/835م وولد في بغداد بالعراق من جارية تدعى قاسم، فنشأ مختلفًا عن أقرانه من أولاد العجم، حريصًا على الابتعاد عن جو العبث واللهو والمنكرات، واشتهر بالتقوى والصلاح والشدة والقوة والبأس. أرسله الوزير عبيد الله بن يحيى بن خاقان إلى ثغر طرسوس فقضى فيه عدة سنوات أخذ خلالها العلم والحديث والآداب عن كبار العلماء. بدأ بزوغ نجم أحمد بن طولون عندما كان في العشرين من عمره بعد وفاة والده سنة 240هـ/854م، حيث فوض إليه الخليفة العباسي المتوكل ما كان لأبيه من الأعمال العسكرية.\n\nبعد مقتل الخليفة المستعين وتولية المعتز، وُلي بايكباك التركي على مصر ولكن لرغبته في البقاء قريبًا من عاصمة الخلافة أناب أحمد بن طولون عنه في أمور الحكم لما عرف عنه من رجاحة العقل وحسن السيرة ولقرابته منه، فدخل ابن طولون مصر سنة 254هـ/868م. ورغم وشاة مراكز القوى في مصر التي كانت توزع عليها سلطة الحكم بأحمد بن طولون عند الخليفة، إلا أنه ظل في سدة الحكم باستخدام سياسة بذل المال لأولي الأمر في بغداد، كما كان يدعمه حلفاؤه من القادة الترك المُهيمنين على مقدرات الخلافة مثل بايكباك ويارجوخ. بدأ أحمد بن طولون في تدعيم أواصل حكمه في مصر، فتخلص من بعض أعدائه وأضعف البعض الآخر وكان على رأسهم ابن المدبر وشقير الحاجب، وساعدته الظروف السياسية في بغداد على الوصول إلى مراده حيث قتل بايكباك سنة 256هـ/870م وخلفه يارجوخ واليًا على مصر، الذي أناب بدوره ابن طولون على الحكم، ولما توفي يارجوخ سنة 259هـ/873م، ولى الخليفة المعتمد ابن طولون حكم مصر، وفي سنة 263هـ/877م قلده المعتمد أمر خراج مصر وإمرة الثغور الشَامية، فأضحى السيد الأوحد للديار المصرية والمشرف على جميع أمورها، وقام بِضرب الدينار الأحمدي رمزًا لهذا الاستقلال، وامتدت حدود دولته من ليبيا إلى حدود الدولة البيزنطية في آسيا الصغرى، ومن نهر الفرات إلى شلال النيل الأول. كان ابن طولون رجل دولة من الطراز الأول ذو كفاءة إدارية وعسكرية، فعني بشئون دولته ووضع أسس تحويلها إلى دولة قوية، وشملت إصلاحاته سائر شئون الدولة المختلفة، فبنى مدينة القطائع وشيد القصور والمستشفيات والملاجئ وقناطر المياه، وشجع الزراعة وأصلح السدود والترع والقنوات، وحفر الجديد منها، وحمى الفلاحين من ظلم جباة الضرائب وأصلح مقياس النيل بالروضة. كما ازدهرت في عهده الصناعة، فاشتهرت مصر بصناعة النسيج. وأنشأ كذلك مسجده المعروف الذي لا يزال شاهدًا على ازدهار عصر بانيه. أدى نجاحه في إدارة شئون البلاد إلى انتشار الرخاء والعمار والعدل بين الرعية. وتوفي أحمد بن طولون سنة 270هـ/884م وخلفه على الحكم ابنه خمارويه ودفن بمدافن الطولونيين بالقرافة الصغرى بالقرب من بابها بسفح المقطم.\n\nالمهندس\nاختلف المؤرخون حول شخصية مهندس المسجد، فرجح بعضهم أنه كان نصرانيًا يدعى سعيد بن كاتب الفرغاني، وأنه كان مهندس عينًا للماء طلب بنائها ابن طولون فلما أتمها دعا ابن طولون لزيارتها ولسوء حظه كان بموضع البناء جيرًا لا زال رطبًا غاصت به قدم فرس ابن طولون فكبا به فظن أنه أراد به سوءًا، فأمر بجلده وسجنه، وظل بمحبسه حتى أراد ابن طولون بناء الجامع فقُدر له ثلاثمائة عمود صعب تدبيرها إلا عبر استخدام أعمدة الكنائس والأديرة المتخربة، فتورع ابن طولون عن ذلك، ولما بلغ النصراني في محبسه الخبر كتب لابن طولون أنه يبنيه له كما يحب ويختار بلا أعمدة إلا عمودي القبلة، فأخرجه ابن طولون وأحضر له جلودًا للرسم، فصور له النصراني المسجد فأُعجب به واستحسنه، وأطلق سراحه وخلع عليه ورصد له مائة ألف دينار لنفقة البناء وكل ما يحتاج بعد ذلك، فوضع النصراني يده في البناء في موضع جبل يشكر، فلما أتم البناء وراح ابن طولون لزيارة المسجد، صعد النصراني إلى المنارة صائحًا بابن طولون بطلب الجائزة والأمان خوفًا من أن يجري له ما جرى في المرة الأولى، فأمنه ابن طولون وكافأه بعشرة آلاف دينار وخلع عليه وأجرى له رزقاً واسعاً. أما المجموعة الأخرى من المؤرخين فيرجحون أن المهندس لم يكن نصرانياً بل كان عراقيًا بسبب تأثر مصمم المسجد بتصميم مسجد سامراء بالعراق، وعدم استخدام الأساطين أو الأعمدة الرخامية في البناء بل استُخدم بدلًا من ذلك العقود القائمة على دعائم من الآجر. ورجح بعضهم أن المهندس هو أحمد بن محمد الحاسب الذي قدم من العراق لبناء مقياس النيل الجديد بالروضة.\n\nالتاريخ\nلما أسس أحمد بن طولون مدينته القطائع سنة 256هـ/870م كي تكون مدينة خاصة به وبحاشيته وجنده، بعد أن ضاقت عليهم الفسطاط والعسكر، وكرمز لاستقلاله عن الدولة العباسية، وكما كان معهودًا في ذلك الوقت بأن المسجد الجامع هو مركز العواصم الإسلامية، فقد شيد بن طولون مسجده الضخم بالقطائع، وذُكر أن من أسباب بناء الجامع هو ضيق جامع مدينة العسكر بالمصلين، فبدئ في بناء المسجد سنة 263هـ/877م وانتهى البناء في سنة 265هـ/879م، ورصد لبناء المسجد مائة ألف دينار ولكن بلغت تكلفته عند الانتهاء منه مائة وعشرون ألف دينار كان مصدرها كنز عثر عليه بن طولون في الجبل.\nلما أُتمت عمارة المسجد نُقل إليه القراء والفقهاء وصلى فيه القاضي بكار بن قتيبة، ودرس فيه الربيع بن سليمان حديث «من بنى لله مسجدً ولو كمفحص قطاة بنى الله له بيتًا في الجنة»، وتصدق بن طولون بصدقات عظيمة وأطعم الفقراء والمساكين، وقد تقرب الناس بالصلاة فيه وألزم أولادهم صلاة الجمعة في فوارة الجامع ثم يخرجون بعد الصلاة إلى مجلس الربيع بن سليمان ليكتبوا العلم ومع كل واحد وراق وعدة غلمان. وعرف الجامع في القرن الرابع الهجري/العاشر الميلادي بـ«الجامع الفوقاني»، تمييزًا له عن «الجامع السفلاني» وهو جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط.\nلما فشلت مؤامرة قتل السلطان الأشرف خليل بن قلاوون، التي شارك الأمير حسام الدين لاجين في تدبيرها، هرب لاجين ولوحق فتخفى بالمسجد، ونذر إلى الله إن نجا من هذه المحنة أن يعمرن المسجد، فتحقق مراده وجلس على عرش مصر، فأبر بنذره وأكمل إصلاح المسجد من كل وجه سنة 696هـ/1296م، ورتب فيه دروسًا للفقه على المذاهب الأربعة، ودرسًا في تفسير القرآن الكريم، ودرسًا في الحديث النبوي، ودرسًا في الطب، ورتب للمسجد خطيبًا ومؤذنين وفراشين وقرر لهم رواتب، وعمل بجواره مكتبًا لإقراء أيتام المسلمين القرآن الكريم، ومنذ إجراء تلك التجديدات أصبح يلي نظارة المسجد قاضي القضاة، وكان أول من ولي نظارته قاضي القضاة بدر الدين بن جماعة. وفي سنة 767هـ جدد الأمير يلبغا الخاصكي العمري درسًا بالمسجد فيه سبعة مدرسين للحنفية، وقرر لكل فقيه من الطلبة في الشهر أربعين درهماً وأردب قمح.\n\nقصص حول المسجد\nلما أمعن أحمد بن طولون في الصحراء غاصت قدم فرس أحمد غلمانه في الرمال فسقط الغلام فوقف بن طولون ونظر فوجد فتق مكان قدم الفرس ففتح فأصاب فيه من المال ما بلغ مقداره ألف ألف دينار وهو ما سمي «المطلب» الذي شاع خبره، وكتب به إلى الخليفة المعتمد في بغداد يستأذنه فيما يصرفه فيه من وجوه البر، فبنى منه «البيمارستان»، ثم أًصاب بعده في الجبل مالًا عظيمًا «الكنز» فبنى منه الجامع، وأوقف جميع ما بقي من المال في الصدقات.\nلما مر أحمد بن طولون على المسجد أثناء بنائه في رمضان، فرأي العمال يشتغلون إلى وقت الغروب، فسأل متى يشتري هؤلاء الضعفاء إفطار لأولادهم، وأمر بصرفهم وقت العصر، فاتخذ هذا سنة من وقتها.\nلما أتم بناء المسجد رأى أحمد بن طولون في منامه كأن الله تعالى قد تجلى للقصور التي حول المسجد ولم يتجلى للمسجد، فسأل المعبرين، فقالوا: يخرب ما حوله ويبقى قائمًا وحده، فقال: من أين لكم هذا، قالوا: من قوله تعالى: ﴿فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًَّا﴾ [الأعراف:143]، وقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: إذا تجلى الله لشئ خضع له.\nلما فرغ أحمد بن طولون من بناء المسجد أمر حاشيته بسماع ما يقول الناس فيه من الأقوال والعيوب، فقال رجل: محرابه صغير، وقال آخر: ما فيه عمود، وقال آخر: ليست له ميضأة، فبلغه ذلك فجمع الناس وقال: أما المحراب فأني رأيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقد خطه لي في منامي، وأصبحت فرأيت النمل قد طافت بذلك المكان الذي خطه لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وأما العمد فأني بنيت هذا الجامع من مال حلال وهو الكنز، وما كنت لأشوبه بغيره، وهذه العمد إما أن تكون في مسجد أو كنيسه فنزهته عنها، وأما الميضأة فإني نظرت فوجدت ما يكون بها من النجاسات فطهرته عنها، وها أنا ابنيها خلفه وأمر ببنائها.\nلما فرغ أحمد بن طولون من بناء الجامع رأى في منامه كأن ناراً نزلت من السماء فأخذت الجامع دون ما حوله من العمران، فلما أصبح قص رؤياه فقيل له: أبشر بقبول الجامع المبارك لأن النار كانت في الزمن الماضي، إذا قبل الله قرباناً نزلت نار من السماء أخذته.\nلما رقي الخطيب أبو يعقوب البلخي المنبر وخطب، دعا للمعتمد ولولده ونسي أن يدعو لابن طولون ونزل عن المنبر، فأشار الأمير إلى غلامه نسيم بضرب الخطيب خمسمائة سوط، فتذكر الخطيب سهوه وهو على مراقي المنبر فعاد وقال: الحمد لله وصلى الله على سيدنا محمد ولقد عهدنا إلى بني آدم من قبل فنسى ولم نجد له عزما، اللهم وأصلح الأمير أبا العباس أحمد بن طولون مولى أمير المؤمنين، وزاد في الشكر والدعاء له بقدر الخطبة ثم نزل، فنظر الأمير إلى الغلام باستبدال الأسواط بالدنانير، ووقف الخطيب على ما كان منه فحمد الله تعالى على سلامته وهنأه الناس.\nلما انتهى الجامع وفتح للصلاة لم يحضر أحد من المصلين لاعتقادهم أنه بني بمال لا يعرفون أصله وكان الناس في ذلك الوقت محترزين على دينهم، فعز ذلك على ابن طولون وجمعهم في يوم جمعة وخطب فيهم وأقسم بالله العظيم الذي لا إله إلا هو أنه ما بنى هذا الجامع «ويده تشير إليه» بشيء من ماله وأنه بناه بكنز ظفر به في الجبل الثالث، وأن العشارى الذي نصبه على مئذنته وجده في الكنز، وأكمل الخطبة، فلما سمع الناس ذلك اجتمع خلق كثير وصلوا فيه الجمعة ولما سمع الناس حكاية المحراب الذي خطه النمل عظم ذلك عندهم حتى ضاق بالمصلين فقالوا لابن طولون نريد أن تزيد لنا فيه زيادة، فزاد فيه ما يعرف حالياً بالزيادات.\n\nالتصميم\nيعتبر المسجد من المساجد المعلقة إذ يصعد إلى أبوابه الداخلية بدرجات دائرية، وهو من أكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات ستة أفدنة ونصف الفدان، استخدم في بنائه الطوب الأحمر، وأقيم على جبل يشكر، فكان أساسه في حدوده القبلية على صخر الجبل مباشرة، أما في حدوده البحرية فكانت أساساته على عمق خمسة أمتار. وضع تصميمه على مثال المساجد الجامعة التي لها صحن كبير مكشوف تحيط به أروقة ذات عقود. وبني المسجد على شكل مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 162.25 متر × 161.50 متر، يشغل منها المسجد مع جدرانه مستطيلاً طول ضلعه 137.80 متر × 118.10 متر، ويتوسطه صحن مكشوف مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 92.35 متر × 91.80 متر، ويحيط بالجامع من جوانبه القبلية والبحرية والغربية أروقة غير مسقوفة تعرف بالزيادات وهي من المسجد، وأسوار هذه الزيادات عاليه بسيطة، فتحت بها أبواب تقابل أبواب الجامع، تتوجها من أعلى شرفة مفرغة، كما فتحت بأسوار الجامع أبواب وشبابيك علوية، بينها حنايا وطاقات مخوصة تتوجها من أعلى شرفات. وللمسجد 21 باب يقابلها نفس العدد في الزيادات، ويوجد في بعض الأبواب معابر خشبية قديمة بها زخارف مورقة، وسبب تعدد الأبواب كان لتسهيل الوصول إلى المساكن والأسواق التي كانت حول الجامع.\nبعد تجاوز سور الزيادة وأبواب المسجد يُوصل إلى الإيوانات التي يتوسطها صحن كبير، يمثل الإيوان الشرقي إيوان القبلة وهو أكبر الإيوانات وأكثرها أروقة وزخرفة، حيث يشتمل على خمسة أروقة، فيما تشتمل باقي الإيوانات على رواقين، وبه اللوحة التأسيسية للمسجد التي تتضمن تاريخ إنشاؤه، ويتوسط جداره الشرقي المحراب الرئيسي، وهيكله طولوني، أما الفسيفساء والطاقية الخشب ومقرنص القبة أعلاه فهي من أعمال السلطان لاجين، الذي تنضم إلى أعماله أيضاً المنبر الخشبي الذي اتُخذت حشواته من خشب الساج الهندي والأبنوس المدقوق بنقوش مورقة في منتهى الدقة، ونقل لاجين المنبر القديم إلى الجامع الظاهري الذي تلاشى حالياً ولم يبق له أثر. وبالإضافة إلى المحراب الرئيسي بهذا الإيوان توجد خمس محاريب جصية غير مجوفة أخرى استجدت بعد ذلك، اثنان صغيران أحدهما على يمين دكة المبلغ والأخر على يسارها، والمحراب المستنصري الموجود في منتصف البائكة الثانية بالرواق الشرقي من جهة الصحن، وعلى يساره محراب السلطان لاجين، ومحراب يعود إلى عصر المماليك البحرية على يسار المحراب الرئيسي. والأروقة مكونة من دعائم مبنية بالطوب مخلق في نواصيها الأربع عمد وتيجان تحمل عقوداً ستينية حليت حافاتها بزخارف جصية نباتية وفتح فيها شبابيك حليت بزخارف متنوعة، ويعلو العقود إفريز زخرفي من الجص يعلوه إزار خشبي يحيط بأروقة المسجد مكتوب فيه بالخط الكوفي البارز سورتا البقرة وآل عمران. وكان لاختيار الدعائم بدلاً من العمد دليلاً على حسن ذوق المصمم لتماثلها في الطول والسمك وهو ما لا ينطبق على العمد الرخامية التي كانت تختلس عادة من من الكنائس والأديرة المتخربة. استعمل الأسمنت المسلح بالسقوف الأثرية لأول مرة في هذا المسجد، وكان ذلك على يد محمود باشا أحمد مدير إدارة حفظ الآثار العربية فبنى السقف بتقاسيمه القديمة من الأسمنت المسلح ثم غلفه بالأخشاب القديمة والجديدة المطابقة للقديم. ويحيط بجدران المسجد الأربعة من أعلى مائة وتسعة وعشرون شباكاً من الجص المفرغ بأشكال هندسية ونباتية.\nوالقبة وسط الصحن هي ثالث قبة أقيمت للمسجد، حيث احترقت القبة الأولى الطولونية للصحن سنة 376هـ/986م، وتهدمت الثانية التي أنشئها العزيز بالله وقيل أمه تغريد سنة 385هـ/995م، وحلت محلها القبة الموجودة حالياً وهي من ضمن أعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد وأنشئها سنة 696هـ/1296م، وهي قبة كبيرة يقاس كل من ضلعيها القبلي والبحري 12.75 متر وضلعيها الشرقي والغربي 14.10 متر، وهي محمولة على أربعة عقود كانت شبابيكها محلاة بزخارف وكتابات كوفية، وبرقبتها من الداخل كتبت آية الوضوء، ويتوسطها فسقية، وفي جدارها سلم يوصل إلى سطح قاعدتها المربعة. أقيمت المنارة على مسافة 0.40 سم من حائط الزيادة الغربية وهي مبنية بالحجر مقاس قاعدتها 12.78 متر × 13.65 متر، وهي مكونة من أربع طبقات الأولى مربعة والثانية مستديرة وهي التي بها السلم الحلزوني والثالثة مثمنة أما الرابعة فتعلوها طاقية تكون معها شكل مبخرة. وهي المنارة الوحيدة في مصر التي لها سلم خارجي يشبه منارة مسجد سامراء. وتاريخ إنشاء المنارة محل خلاف بين الأثريين حيث يرى بعضهم أن السلطان لاجين جددها كاملة سنة 696هـ/1296م على مثالها القديم ضمن أعماله بالمسجد، ويرى البعض الآخر أنها طولونية عدا قمتها التي جددها السلطان لاجين.\nأما القبة فوق المحراب فهي مكونة من قاعدة مربعة من الخارج تحتوي على مجموعة من المقرنصات مكسوة بالخشب لتحويل المربع إلى شكل مثمن ثم إلى الدائرة التي ترتكز عليها القبة، وتلك القبة من أعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد. ألحق بالمسجد سبيل يقع بالناحية الشرقية من الزيادة الجنوبية له واجهة رئيسة هي الغربية يبلغ طولها 19.80 متر وتنقسم إلى جزأين الأول يضم باب الدخول والثاني يضم شباك السبيل، وحجرة التسبيل مستطيلة المسقط طولها من الشرق إلى الغرب 11.75 متر وعرضها 5.35 متر، ويغطي حجرة السبيل سقف من براطيم خشبية عليه آثار زخارف نباتية ملونة وبأركانه أربع مقرنصات يتكون كل منها من سبع حطات متتالية. وبجوار المحراب الرئيسي باب في الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية كان يخرج ويدخل منه ابن طولون إلى دار الإمارة الملاصقة للمسجد ليغير ثيابه أو يجدد وضوئه أو لأخذ قسط من الراحة ثم يعود فيدخل إلى الصف الأول دون أن يتخطى جموع المصلين، ودمرت هذه الدار مع الدمار الذي حل بمدينة القطائع بعد زوال الدولة الطولونية، والدار القائمة اليوم مكانها هي من أعمال السلطان لاجين.\n\nنص التأسيس\nنص التأسيس على واجهة مدخل الباب\n\nالترميم\nتوالت يد الإصلاح والترميم على المسجد في أكثر من مناسبة كان منها في عهد الخليفة الحاكم بأمر الله الذي أنزل إلى المسجد ثمانمائة وأربعة عشر مصحفاُ. وكان في وسط صحن المسجد فسقية من الرخام تعلوها قبة مثمنة الشكل مذهبة ومحمولة على أعمدة من رخام، تعرضت سنة 376هـ/986م في عهد الخليفة الفاطمي العزيز بالله لحريق، فأقام بدلاً منها قبة أخرى سنة 385هـ/995م، ولكن هذا التجديد لم يقو أيضاً على مواجهة عوامل الزمن. وخلال خلافة المستنصر بالله سنة 470هـ/1077م اجتاح مصر الوباء والقحط، فنشعت جدران المسجد وألم به الخراب، فلحقه الوزير بدر الدين الجمالي سنة 470هـ/1077م وأصلح أركانه وقوم بنيانه. وفي سنة 526هـ/1131م أمر الخليفة الحافظ لدين الله ببعض إصلاحات بالمسجد. وفي عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي اختص المسجد بفريق من المغاربة استعمره أكثر من جيل، إلى أن تولى حكم مصر السلطان الظاهر بيبرس فاتخذ ملحقات المسجد شونة للغلال سنة 662هـ/1263م. ثم كانت إصلاحات السلطان حسام الدين لاجين سنة 696هـ/1296م التي شملت بناؤه للسبيل الموجود بالنصف الشرقي من الزيادة القبلية والذي جدده السلطان قايتباي فيما بعد، وإنشاؤه القبة القائمة اليوم على فسقية بوسط الصحن والتي لها سلم يؤدي إلى ظهرها عمل في جدار قاعدتها البحري بدلاً من بناؤه منفصلاً، وتجديده كذلك الجزء العلوي المضلع من المئذنة الكبرى الذي يعلو دورتها المستديرة، وتشييده للمنبر الحالي. وفي عهد الناصر محمد بن قلاوون أنشأ بالمسجد منارتين أسطوانيتين على طرفي جداره الشرقي بناهما بالطوب، هدمت الأولى في القرن الثالث عشر الهجري، والثانية البحرية الشرقية في سنة 1933 لخلل بهما. وفي عهد الظاهر برقوق أنشأ الحاج عبيد بن محمد البازدار سنة 792هـ/1390م رواقاً بجوار المئذنة الكبرى، وجدد ميضأة بجانب الميضأة القديمة، ثم تلاه الشيخ شرف الدين المدني فأنشأ مصلى وتربة سنة 930هـ/1534م، وقد زالت إنشاءات البازدار والمدني في عمارة سور الزيادة الغربية سنة 1943. وفي أيام محمد بك أبى الذهب أنشأ بالمسجد مصنعاً لعمل الأحرمة الصوفية. وفي سنة 1263هـ/1847م حول كلوت بك المسجد إلى ملجأ للعجزة، وظل كذلك حتى سنة 1882 حين أدركت لجنة حفظ الآثار العربية المسجد فوجهت إليه عنايتها وقامت خلال الفترة من 1890 وحتى 1918 بإزالة الأبنية المستحدثة التي كانت بداخل الإيوانات، وهدمت بعض الدور التي كانت تحجب الوجهة الشرقية للمسجد، وأزالت الأتربة والأنقاض، وأصلحت القبة التي فوق المحراب والمنارة الكبيرة والمنارة البحرية الشرقية والمنبر والشبابيك الجصية وجزء من السقف، وحافظت على الزخارف الجصية.\nوفي عهد الملك فؤاد الأول سنة 1918 رغب في إعادة إقامة الشعائر الدينية بالمسجد فصلى فيه فريضة الجمعة وأمر بتخلية جوانبه وتتميم إصلاحه، فقامت اللجنة بتخلية الوجهة البحرية وفتح أبوابها، وإصلاح أسوارها وأزالت الأبنية المحدثة بالزيادة القبلية، وأخلت قسم كبير من الوجهتين الشرقية والغربية، وبلطت أروقة الإيوانات الغربية والبحرية والقبلية، وأصلحت الزخارف الجصية بباطن العقود، والسبيل الموجود بالزيادة القبلية، وأزالت الأتربة من الزيادات ومهدتها ومعها والصحن، وأعادت بناء الرواق المشرف على الصحن من الإيوان الشرقي، كما عملت لجميع الأروقة سقف من الأسمنت المسلح برسم السقف القديم وغلفته بأخشاب أدخلت فيها الأجزاء القديمة، وأعادت تركيب الإزار الكوفي فيها، وبلغت تكلفة تلك الإصلاحات 40 ألف جنيه، كما بلغت تكلفة نزع الملكية 45 ألف جنيه. وفي عهد الملك فاروق الأول أُصلح كثير من الشبابيك الجصية كما أصلح المحراب المستنصري ونزعت ملكية بعض الدور التي تلاصق الزيادة الغربية بجوار المنارة الكبيرة وكذلك بقية الدور التي تحجب الوجهتين الشرقية والقبلية. أما آخر محاولات ترميم المسجد فكانت في عام 2005 حين قامت وزارة الثقافة المصرية بترميم زخارفه وافتتاحه كواحد من بين 38 مسجداً تم ترميمها ضمن مشروع القاهرة التاريخي، وقد أعلنت وزارة الثقافة أن إعادة ترميم الجامع تجاوزت تكلفتها 12 مليون جنيه.\n\nسرقة المحتويات\nفي يونيو 2014 سُرقت مفصلات نحاسية من باب المقدم «باب المنبر» عليها نقوش إسلامية تعود للعصر المملوكي، وفي يوليو 2014 تمكنت الشرطة من ضبط المسروقات والقبض على اللصوص.\n\nالتكريم\nبما أن المسجد الطولوني من الآثار المصرية التي لها رونق خاص، وكنوع من تسليط الدولة المصرية الضوء على أحد أبرز معالمها السياحية والأثرية، فقد تم تزيين وجه العملة الورقية المصرية فئة خمسة جنيهات برسم صورة مسجد ابن طولون في أكثر من إصدار، فيما يحمل ظهر الورقة الحالية صورة للوحة فرعونية.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر أيضًا\nمصادر\nهوامش\nملاحظات\nمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\nصور
