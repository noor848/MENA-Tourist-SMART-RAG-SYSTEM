      "content": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Cairo is derived from the Arabic al-Qāhirah (القاهرة), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Its full, formal name was al-Qāhirah al-Mu'izziyyah (القاهرة المعزيّة), meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'. It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, known in Arabic by names such as an-Najm al-Qāhir (النجم القاهر, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding.\nEgyptians often refer to Cairo as Maṣr (IPA: [mɑsˤɾ]; مَصر), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasising the city's importance for the country.\nThere are a number of Coptic names for the city. Tikešrōmi (Coptic: Ϯⲕⲉϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ Late Coptic: [dikɑʃˈɾoːmi]) is attested in the 1211 text The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' (Ϯ-, 'the', ⲕⲁϣ-, 'to break', and ⲣⲱⲙⲓ, 'man'), akin to Arabic al-Qāhirah, or a derivation from Arabic قَصْر الرُوم (qaṣr ar-rūm, \"the Roman castle\"), another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo. The Arabic name is also calqued as ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ϯⲣⲉϥϭⲣⲟ, \"the victor city\" in the Coptic antiphonary.\nThe form Khairon (Coptic: ⲭⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ) is attested in the modern Coptic text Ⲡⲓⲫⲓⲣⲓ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉ ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ ⲙ̀ⲙⲏⲓ Ⲃⲉⲣⲏⲛⲁ (The Tale of Saint Verina). Lioui (Ⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [lɪˈjuːj]) or Elioui (Ⲉⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [ælˈjuːj]) is another name which is descended from the Greek name of Heliopolis (Ήλιούπολις). Some argue that Mistram (Ⲙⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈmɪstəɾɑm]) or Nistram (Ⲛⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈnɪstəɾɑm]) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it is rather a name for the Abbasid province capital al-Askar. Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲏ (Kahi•ree) is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being Ⲕⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ [Kairon] and Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲁ [Kahira]) which is modern folk etymology meaning 'land of sun'. Some argue that it was  the name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory. Cairo is also referred to as Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ (Late Coptic: [ˈkɪmi]) or Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ (Late Coptic: [ˈɡɪpdos]), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\nSometimes the city is informally referred to as Cairo by people from Alexandria (IPA: [ˈkæjɾo]; Egyptian Arabic: كايرو).\n\nHistory\nAncient settlements\nThe area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions (roughly Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt), which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant. Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south west of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the modern districts of Matariya and Ain Shams in northeastern Cairo. It was largely destroyed by the Persian invasions in 525 BC and 343 BC and partly abandoned by the late first century BC.\nHowever, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD. Around the turn of the fourth century, as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a large fortress along the east bank of the Nile. The fortress, called Babylon, was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian (r. 285–305) at the entrance of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea that was created earlier by Emperor Trajan (r. 98–117). Further north of the fortress, near the present-day district of al-Azbakiya, was a port and fortified outpost known as Tendunyas (Coptic: ϯⲁⲛⲧⲱⲛⲓⲁⲥ) or Umm Dunayn. While no structures older than the 7th century have been preserved in the area aside from the Roman fortifications, historical evidence suggests that a sizeable city existed. The city was important enough that its bishop, Cyrus, participated in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.\nThe Byzantine-Sassanian War between 602 and 628 caused great hardship and likely caused much of the urban population to leave for the countryside, leaving the settlement partly deserted. The site today remains at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (from the late 7th or early 8th century), are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo.\n\nFustat and other early Islamic settlements\nThe Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt was led by Amr ibn al-As from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of Alexandria, the Egyptian capital at the time, he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress. The city, known as Fustat (Arabic: الفسطاط, romanised: al-Fusṭāṭ, lit. 'the tent'), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt. Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and André Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat. \nThe choice of founding a new settlement at this inland location, instead of using the existing capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, may have been due to the new conquerors' strategic priorities. One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient canal in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to Medina, the capital of the caliphate in Arabia. Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).\n\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as al-Askar (Arabic: العسكر, lit. 'the camp') as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786. The Red Sea canal re-excavated in the 7th century was closed by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), but a part of the canal, known as the Khalij, continued to be a major feature of Cairo's geography and of its water supply until the 19th century. In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, a Nilometer was built on Roda Island near Fustat. Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\n\nIn 868, a commander of Turkic origin named Bakbak was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'taz to restore order after a rebellion in the country. He was accompanied by his stepson, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who became effective governor of Egypt. Over time, Ibn Tulun gained an army and accumulated influence and wealth, allowing him to become the de facto independent ruler of both Egypt and Syria by 878. In 870, he used his growing wealth to found a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i (Arabic: القطائـع, lit. 'the allotments'), to the northeast of Fustat and of al-Askar. \nThe new city included a palace known as the Dar al-Imara, a parade ground known as al-Maydan, a bimaristan (hospital), and an aqueduct to supply water. Between 876 and 879 Ibn Tulun built a great mosque, now known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, at the center of the city, next to the palace. After his death in 884, Ibn Tulun was succeeded by his son and his descendants who continued a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids. In 905, the Abbasids sent general Muhammad Sulayman al-Katib to re-assert direct control over the country. Tulunid rule was ended and al-Qatta'i was razed to the ground, except for the mosque which remains standing today.\n\nFoundation and expansion of Cairo under the Fatimids\nIn 969, the Fatimid Caliphate conquered Egypt after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah instructed his courtier and general Jawhar al-Saqili to establish a new fortified city northeast of Fustat and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah, which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books. When Caliph al-Mu'izz arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, Qāhirat al-Mu'izz (\"The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz\"), from which the name \"Cairo\" (al-Qāhira) originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish palace complex that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier (1073–1094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city. Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today.\nDuring the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile. Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people. They may have been similar to Roman insulae and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and Ottoman periods. However, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier Shawar set fire to the unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by Amalric, the Crusader king of Jerusalem. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\n\nWhile the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'Āḍid. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel. These construction projects continued beyond Saladin's lifetime and were completed under his Ayyubid successors.\n\nFurther expansion and decline under the Ayyubids and Mamluks\nIn 1250, during the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of al-Salih and power transitioned instead to the Mamluks, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, Shajar ad-Durr, who ruled for a brief period around this time. Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the Mamluk Sultanate passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260) and for eliminating the last Crusader states in the Levant.\nDespite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341, with interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\nMulti-story buildings occupied by rental apartments, known as a rab' (plural ribā' or urbu), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period. These apartments were often laid out as multi-story duplexes or triplexes. They were sometimes attached to caravanserais, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The oldest partially-preserved example of this type of structure is the Wikala of Amir Qawsun, built before 1341. Residential buildings were in turn organised into close-knit neighbourhoods called a harat, which in many cases had gates that could be closed off at night or during disturbances.\n\nWhen the traveller Ibn Battuta first came to Cairo in 1326, he described it as the principal district of Egypt. When he passed through the area again on his return journey in 1348, the Black Death was ravaging most major cities. He cited reports of thousands of deaths per day in Cairo. Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. \nDuring its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412. It was nonetheless in this period that the largest Mamluk-era religious monument, the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, was built. In the late 14th century, the Burji Mamluks replaced the Bahri Mamluks as rulers of the Mamluk state, but the Mamluk system continued to decline.\nThough the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration. More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness. Its economy and politics also became more deeply connected with the wider Mediterranean. Some Mamluk sultans in this period, such as Barbsay (r. 1422–1438) and Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496), had relatively long and successful reigns. After al-Nasir Muhammad, Qaytbay was one of the most prolific patrons of art and architecture of the Mamluk era. He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt. The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay. The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\n\nOttoman rule\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517. Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital. For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of Yemeni coffee and Indian textiles, primarily to Anatolia, North Africa, and the Balkans. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren Hejaz, especially during the annual hajj to Mecca. It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of Islamic scholars. The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c. 1557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople. The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Geniza.\n\nUnder the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel. The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean. Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.\nThe French occupation was short-lived as British and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable Albanian contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801. The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened Mamluks jostling for control of the country. Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named Muhammad Ali Pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually, with the approval of the religious establishment, viceroy of Egypt in 1805.\n\nModern era\nUntil his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition. Isma'il also sought to modernise the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.\nThe immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the British invasion in 1882. The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il. Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\nIn 1906, the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. In 1905–1907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood. In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.\n\nThe British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate. Nevertheless, this led to Egypt's independence in 1922.\nThe King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad. The goal of the government of the newly formed Kingdom of Egypt was not to delegitimise the other variant Quranic texts (\"qira'at\"), but to eliminate errors found in Qur'anic texts used in state schools. A committee of teachers chose to preserve a single one of the canonical qira'at \"readings\", namely that of the \"Ḥafṣ\" version, an 8th-century Kufic recitation. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran for much of the Islamic world. The publication has been called a \"terrific success\", and the edition has been described as one \"now widely seen as the official text of the Qur'an\", so popular among both Sunni and Shi'a that the common belief among less well-informed Muslims is \"that the Qur'an has a single, unambiguous reading\". Minor amendments were made later in 1924 and in 1936 - the \"Faruq edition\" in honour of then ruler, King Faruq.\n\nBritish occupation until 1956\nBritish troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis. Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million—and its area increased from 10 to 163 km2 (4 to 63 sq mi).\nThe city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Tahrir Square and the Nile Corniche, and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.\n\nAfter 1956\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Cairo continued to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006, the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269. The population explosion also drove the rise of \"informal\" housing ('ashwa'iyyat), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control. The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo. According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.\nThe \"formal\" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of Madinat Nasr, a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s. Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land. These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods. As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\nConcurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city. In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n\n2011 Egyptian revolution\nCairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. More than 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nDespite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.\n\nPost-revolutionary Cairo\nUnder the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\n\nGeography\nCairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 km (100 mi) south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 km (75 mi) west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal. The city lies along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 km2 (175 sq mi). Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\nUntil the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the Mokattam highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of Geziret al-Fil is occupied by the Shubra district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes Zamalek and Gezira. Land reclamation efforts by the Mamluks and Ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.\nBecause of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. \nThe Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\nNorthern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate. Giza city has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today has a population of 2.7 million. The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\n\nClimate\nIn Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate (BWh according to the Köppen climate classification system).\nWind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. Winters are mild to warm, while summers are long and hot. High temperatures in winter range from 14 to 22 °C (57 to 72 °F), while night-time lows drop to below 11 °C (52 °F), often to 5 °C (41 °F). In summer, the highs often exceed 31 °C (88 °F) but rarely surpass 40 °C (104 °F), and lows drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its proximity to the Mediterranean coast. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades. Dew points in the hottest months range from 13.9 °C (57 °F) in June to 18.3 °C (65 °F) in August.\n\nMetropolitan area and districts\nThe city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa. While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza Governorate, and Qalyubia Governorate. As a contiguous metropolitan area, various studies have considered Greater Cairo be composed of the administrative cities that are Cairo, Giza and Shubra al-Kheima, in addition to the satellite cities/new towns surrounding them.\nCairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra administrative division between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas (manatiq, singl. mantiqa) divided into 38 districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):\nThe Northern Area is divided into 8 Districts:\n\nShubra\nAl-Zawiya al-Hamra\nHadayek al-Qubba\nRod al-Farg\nAl-Sharabia\nAl-Sahel\nAl-Zeitoun\nAl-Amiriyya\n\nThe Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts and three new cities:\n\nMisr al-Gadidah and Al-Nozha (Heliopolis)\nNasr City East and Nasr City West\nAl-Salam 1 (Awwal) and al-Salam 2 (Than)\nAin Shams\nAl-Matariya\nAl-Marg\nShorouk (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nBadr (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nAl-Qahira al-Gadida (New Cairo, three qisms, under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nThe Western Area divided into 9 Districts:\n\nManshiyat Nasser\nAl-Wayli (Incl. qism al-Daher)\nWasat al-Qahira (Central Cairo, incl. Al-Darb al-Ahmar, al-Gamaliyya qisms)\nBulaq\nGharb al-Qahira (West Cairo, incl. Zamalek qism, Qasr al-Nil qism incl. Garden City and part of Down Town)\nAbdeen\nAl-Azbakiya\nAl-Muski\nBab al-Sha'aria\n\nThe Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:\n\nMasr El-Qadima (Old Cairo, including Al-Manial)\nAl-Khalifa\nAl-Moqattam\nAl-Basatin\nDar al-Salam\nSayyidah Zainab District\nEl Tebbin\nHelwan\nAl-Ma'sara\nAl-Maadi\nTora\n15th of May (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nSatellite cities\nSince 1977 a number of new towns have been planned and built by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) in the Eastern Desert around Cairo, ostensibly  to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: 15th of May City, Badr City, Shorouk City, and New Cairo. In addition, two more are under construction: the New Administrative Capital. And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.\n\nPlanned new capital\nIn March 2015, plans were announced for a new city to be built east of Cairo, in an undeveloped area of the Cairo Governorate, which would serve as the New Administrative Capital of Egypt. Cairo also introduced more modern metro lines to reduce traffic in central areas.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census, Cairo had a population of 9,539,673 people, distributed across 46 qisms (police wards):\n\nReligion\nThe majority of Egypt and Cairo's population is Sunni Muslim. A significant Christian minority exists, among whom Coptic Orthodox are the majority. Precise numbers for each religious community in Egypt are not available and estimates vary. Other churches that have, or had, a presence in modern Cairo include the Catholic Church (including Armenian Catholic, Coptic Catholic, Chaldean Catholic, Syrian Catholic, and Maronite), the Greek Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), and some Protestant churches. Cairo has been the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church since the 12th century, and the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope is located in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Until the 20th century, Cairo had a sizeable Jewish community, but as of 2022 only three Jews were reported to be living in the city. A total of 12 synagogues in Cairo still exist.\n\nEconomy\nCairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing – specifically the production of sugar cane. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world.\nCairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.\nThis growth until recently surged well ahead of city services. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like \"hyper-urbanization\".\n\nAutomobile manufacturers from Cairo\nArab American Vehicles Company (vehicles by Stellantis alliance)\nEgyptian Light Transport Manufacturing Company (Egyptian NSU pedant)\nGhabbour Group (Fuso, Hyundai and Volvo)\nMCV Corporate Group (a part of the Daimler AG)\nMod Car\nSeoudi Group (Modern Motors: Nissan, BMW (formerly); El-Mashreq: Alfa Romeo and Fiat)\nSperanza (former Daewoo Motors Egypt; Chery, Daewoo)\nGeneral Motors Egypt\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth\nCairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of medical care in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the JCI-accredited As-Salaam International Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Dar Al Fouad, Nile Badrawi Hospital, 57357 Hospital, as well as Qasr El Eyni Hospital.\n\nEducation\nGreater Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.\nToday, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the Egyptian educational system, has the largest number of educational schools, and higher education institutes among other cities and governorates of Egypt.\nSome of the International Schools found in Cairo:\n\nUniversities in Greater Cairo:\n\nTransport\nCairo has an extensive road network, rail system, subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses. Cairo International Airport is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.\n\nPublic transportation\nCairo, specifically Ramses Station, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network. The Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit and runs the Cairo Metro. The metro network covers Helwan and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during rush hour. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want. Trams in Greater Cairo and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution. In 2022, the Cairo Light Rail Transit system opened. Despite the name, the CLRT is more like a commuter rail system than a Light Rail system. As of 2025, the system consists of a single bifurcating line of 12 stations over 70 km, with a top speed of 12p km/h. In 2017, plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking 6th of October to suburban Giza, a distance of 35 km (22 mi), and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of 52 km (32 mi).\n\nRoads\nTwo trans-African automobile routes originate in Cairo: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Cairo-Dakar Highway. An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new Ring Road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the 6th October Bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.\nCairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded. Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas.\n\nOther forms of transport\nBolt\nCairo Nile Ferry\nCairo Taxi/Yellow Cab\nCareem\nDiDi\nUber\n\nCulture\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nCairo Opera House\nPresident Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations.\n\nKhedivial Opera House\nThe Khedivial Opera House, or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\n\nCairo International Film Festival\nCairo held its first international film festival 16 August 1976, when the first Cairo International Film Festival was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.\nThis achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the FIAPF with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.\nIn 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, Hussein Fahmy, who was appointed by the Minister of Culture, Farouk Hosni, after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.\n\nCairo Geniza\nThe Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the Ben Ezra Synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the University of Cambridge runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\nSports\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues, most notably Al Ahly and Zamalek SC, who were the CAF first and second African clubs of the 20th century. The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football. They play their home games at Cairo International Stadium, which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo.\nThe Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960. Its multi-purpose sports complex houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, satellite fields that hold regional and continental games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. Egypt later won the competition and the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only to win the African Nations Cup back to back. Egypt won the title for a record six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola in 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. As of 2021, Egypt's national team is ranked #46 in the world by FIFA.\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Beijing. However, Cairo did host the 2007 Pan Arab Games.\nThere are other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including Gezira Sporting Club, el Shams Club, Shooting Club, Heliopolis Sporting Club, and several smaller clubs. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's downtown), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.\nMost of the sports federations of the country are located in the city suburbs, including the Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in 6 October City, a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts. In 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the International Rugby Board.\nEgypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in professional and junior divisions. Egypt has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year. Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been the women's world number one. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship. In 2017 she retained her title.\nCairo is the official endpoint of Cross Egypt Challenge where its route ends yearly in the most sacred place in Egypt, under the Great Pyramids of Giza with a huge trophy-giving ceremony.\n\nCityscape and landmarks\nTahrir Square\nTahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the 1952 Revolution which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the Mogamma governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the Arab League, the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the Egyptian Museum. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square has witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient obelisk from the reign of Ramses II, originally unearthed at Tanis (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed sphinx statues moved from Karnak.\n\nEgyptian Museum\nThe Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among the collections on display are the finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nGrand Egyptian Museum\nMuch of the collection of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, including the Tutankhamun collection, are slated to be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction in Giza and was due to open by the end of 2020.\n\nCairo Tower\nThe Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It is one of Cairo's landmarks and provides a bird's eye view of the city to restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island on the Nile River, in the city centre. At 187 m (614 ft), it is 44 m (144 ft) higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some 15 km (9 mi) to the southwest.\n\nOld Cairo\nThis area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the Coptic Museum, which showcases the history of Coptic art from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, the oldest and best-known synagogue in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.\n\nTo the north of this Coptic enclave is the Amr ibn al-'As Mosque, the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly Fustat, founded in 642 AD right after the Arab conquest but rebuilt many times since. A part of the former city of Fustat has also been excavated to the east of the mosque and of the Coptic enclave, although the archeological site is threatened by encroaching construction and modern development. To the northwest of Babylon Fortress and the mosque is the Monastery of Saint Mercurius (or Dayr Abu Sayfayn), an important and historic Coptic religious complex consisting of the Church of Saint Mercurius, the Church of Saint Shenute, and the Church of the Virgin (also known as al-Damshiriya). Several other historic churches are also situated to the south of Babylon Fortress.\n\nIslamic Cairo\nCairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of Islamic architecture in the world. The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterised by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as \"Islamic Cairo\", especially in English travel literature. It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.\nThe first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the classical period of Islamic civilisation. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful. Another Abbasid construction, the Nilometer on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the Nile, which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.\nThe settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: al-Qahira) was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the Aqmar Mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i.\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the al-Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), a sabil (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. Still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which today hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The Khan al-Khalili is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).\n\nCitadel of Cairo\nThe Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by Salah al-Din in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the Muqattam Hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and Fustat to the southwest. It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when Khedive Isma'il moved to 'Abdin Palace. It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the National Military Museum, the 14th century Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the 19th century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.\n\nKhan el-Khalili\nKhan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar, or marketplace adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by Sultan al-Ghuri, who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today. Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate Mamluk-style gateways. Today, Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.\n\nSociety\nIn the present day, Cairo is a heavily urbanised city. Because of the influx of people into the city, lone standing houses are rare, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. Single detached houses are usually owned by the wealthy. Formal education is also seen as important, with twelve years of standard formal education. Cairenes can take a standardised test similar to the SAT to be accepted to an institution of higher learning, but most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the workforce. Egypt still struggles with poverty, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day.\n\nWomen's rights\nThe civil rights movement for women in Cairo – and by extent, Egypt – has been a struggle for years. Women are reported to face constant discrimination, sexual harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. A 2013 UN study found that over 99% of Egyptian women reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives. The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalising sexual harassment. The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous megacity for women in the world. In 2020, the social media account \"Assault Police\" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders. The account was founded by student Nadeen Ashraf, who is credited for instigating an iteration of the #MeToo movement in Egypt.\n\nPollution\nThe air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.\nIn recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of smog  has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to temperature inversion. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.\nCairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.\nThe city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which are not collected or managed. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the Zabbaleen community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat Naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.\n\nInternational relations\nThe Headquarters of the Arab League is located at Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nZulfikar family, Egyptian noble family\nRabab Al-Kadhimi (1918–1998), dentist and poet\nWael Alaa (born 1987), musician known as Neobyrd\nAmr Aly (born 1962), American soccer player and Olympian\nGamal Aziz, also known as Gamal Mohammed Abdelaziz, former president and chief operating officer of Wynn Resorts, and former CEO of MGM Resorts International, indicted as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal\nYasser Arafat (1929–2004), born Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was the 3rd Chairman of The PLO and first president of the Palestinian Authority\nAbu Sa'id al-Afif, 15th-century Samaritan\nEzz El-Dine Zulficar (1919–1963), Egyptian film director, screenwriter, actor and producer, known for his distinctive style, which blends romance and action.

      "summary": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.",

      "title": "القاهرة",
      "content": "القَاهِرَة هي عاصمة جمهورية مصر العربية وأكبر وأهم مدنها، وتعد أكبر مدينة عربية من حيث تعداد السكان والمساحة، وتحتل المركز الثاني أفريقيًا والسابع عشر عالميًا من حيث التعداد السكاني، كما أنها جزء من أكبر تجمع حضري في أفريقيا والوطن العربي والشرق الأوسط. تعد منطقة القاهرة الكبرى الثانية عشرة من حيث عدد السكان في العالم حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها 21,322,750 مليون نسمة حسب إحصائيات عام 2021. يمثلون 20% من إجمالي تعداد سكان مصر أكثر من (107 مليون نسمة).\nتعد مدينة القاهرة من أكثر المدن تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً، حيث شهدت العديد من الحقب التاريخية المختلفة على مر العصور، وتوجد فيها العديد من المعالم القديمة والحديثة، فأصبحت متحفاً مفتوحاً يضم آثاراً فرعونية ويونانية ورومانية وقبطية وإسلامية. يعود تاريخ المدينة إلى نشأة مدينة أون الفرعونية أو هليوبوليس «عين شمس حالياً» والتي تعد واحدة من أقدم مدن العالم القديم. أما القاهرة بطرازها الحالي فيعود تاريخ إنشائها إلى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص عام 641 م وإنشائه مدينة الفسطاط، ثم إنشاء العباسيين لمدينة العسكر، فبناء أحمد بن طولون لمدينة القطائع، ومع دخول الفاطميين مصر قادمين من إفريقية (تونس حالياً) بدأ القائد جوهر الصقلي في بناء العاصمة الجديدة للدولة الفاطمية بأمر من الخليفة الفاطمي المعز لدين الله وذلك في عام 969م، وأطلق عليها الخليفة اسم «القاهرة». وأطلق على القاهرة- على مر العصور- العديد من الأسماء، فهي مدينة الألف مئذنة ومصر المحروسة وقاهرة المعز. شهدت القاهرة خلال العصر الإسلامي أرقى فنون العمارة التي تمثلت في بناء القلاع والحصون والأسوار والمدارس والمساجد، مما منحها لمحةً جماليةً لا زالت موجودة بأحيائها القديمة حتى الآن.\nوتعد القاهرة محافظة ومدينة، أي أنها محافظة تشغل كامل مساحتها مدينة واحدة، وفي نفس الوقت مدينة كبيرة تشكل محافظة بذاتها، وتنقسم إلى 37 حياً، وتحتفل القاهرة بعيدها القومي في 6 يوليو من كل عام، وهو اليوم الذي يوافق وضع القائد جوهر الصقلي حجر أساس المدينة عام 969م، ليبلغ عمر القاهرة الآن ما يربو على 1055 عام.\nتعد القاهرة أيضاً مقراً للعديد من المنظمات الإقليمية والعالمية، حيث يقع بها مقر جامعة الدول العربية، والمكتب الإقليمي لكل من: منظمة الصحة العالمية، منظمة الأغذية والزراعة، منظمة الطيران المدني الدولي، الاتحاد الدولي للاتصالات، صندوق الأمم المتحدة للسكان، هيئة الأمم المتحدة للمرأة، مقر برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية للأمم المتحدة، وكذلك مقر الاتحاد الإفريقي لكرة السلة.\n\nالتسمية\nاختلفت الأقاويل حول سبب تسمية القاهرة بهذا الاسم، فقيل أن جوهر الصقلي سمى المدينة في أول الأمر المنصورية تيمناً باسم مدينة المنصورية التي أنشأها خارج القيروان المنصور بالله والد المعز لدين الله، أو تيمناً باسم والد المعز نفسه إحياءً لذكراه، واستمر هذا الاسم حتى قدم المعز إلى مصر فأطلق عليها اسم «القاهرة»، وذلك بعد مرور أربع سنوات على تأسيسها، تفاؤلاً بأنها ستقهر الدولة العباسية المنافسة للفاطميين، وقيل أنه سماها بالقاهرة لتقهر الدنيا، أو أنها سميت نسبة إلى الكوكب القاهر وهو كوكب المريخ. ولمدينة القاهرة عدة أسماء شهيرة منها مصر المحروسة، قاهرة المعز، مدينة الألف مئذنة، جوهرة الشرق.\n\nالتاريخ\nاكتسبت القاهرة مكانتها وتأثيرها على مختلف الحضارات بفضل موقعها الاستراتيجي الذي اختاره لها أهل مصر منذ فجر الحضارة، وتميزت عن بقية العواصم التاريخية بصفة الاستمرار، فشكل تطورها سلسلة من الحلقات بدأت مع مدينة أون في عهد ما قبل الأسرات والتي كانت بمثابة العاصمة الدينية بعد توحيد البلاد وبداية عهد الأسرات على يد الملك مينا بينما كانت منف هي أول عاصمة إدارية وسياسيه لمصر بعد استقرار الوحدة. وعرفت أون فيما بعد بالاسم الإغريقي هليوبوليس أو عين شمس حالياً. عقب الفتح الإسلامي لمصر سنة 18 هـ/639 م، شيد عمرو بن العاص مدينة الفسطاط سنة 21 هـ/641 م، وبنى جامع عرف باسمه، ثم اختطت أماكن إقامة القبائل العربية. وعقب قيام الدولة العباسية والقضاء على الدولة الأموية أنشأ العباسيون مدينة العسكر في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط وأقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيها صالح بن علي دار الإمارة وثكن الجند، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر، وبمرور الأيام اتصلت العسكر بالفسطاط وأصبحتا مدينة كبيرة خطت فيها الطرق وشيدت بها المساجد والأسواق. وذلك إلى أن تولى أحمد بن طولون حكم مصر ورأى أن مدينة العسكر لا تتسع لحاشيته وجنده، فصعد إلى جبل المقطم ورأى بين العسكر والمقطم أرض فضاء فاختط في موضعها مدينته الجديدة التي سميت القطائع. وبعد قرابة مائة عام على إنشاء القطائع دخل الفاطميون مصر بقيادة جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفة المعز لدين الله، فأخذ في وضع أساس «القاهرة» شمال شرقي القطائع، كما وضع أساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الأزهر.\n\nالعصور القديمة\nأون\nكانت مدينة أون القديمة وموقعها حالياً منطقة المطرية وعين شمس من أبرز مراكز الثقافة المصرية القديمة وذكرت في المتون المصرية القديمة بأسماء «أونو أفق السماء» و«أنو سماء مصر» واعتبرتها مقر الآلهة المختارة وموطن ميلاد كل معبود، وسميت المدينة في القبطية «أونو»، وفي اليونانية «هليوبوليس» بمعنى مدينة الشمس. كان للمدينة ماضيها السياسي حيث تعد واحدة من أقدم عواصم مصر المتحدة في فجر التاريخ وذلك نتيجة لجهود زعمائها الذين أقاموا بها أول وحده للوجهين سبقت الوحدة التي تمت على يد الملك مينا. وكفل للمدينة شهرتها في الفلسفة والدين قدم مذهبها في تفسير نشأة الوجود. أما في الفلك ترجع شهرة المدينة إلى ابتكار التقويم الشمسي الذي تميزت به الحضارة المصرية. وعلى الرغم من أن مدينة أون لم تلعب دوراً سياسياً بارزاً في العصور التاريخية إلا أنها ظلت محتفظة بمكانتها الثقافية والحضارية والدينية وحرص الملوك على ترك آثارهم بها على مر العصور، وأسفرت الحفائر الحديثة عن الكثير من الآثار التي تدل على ذلك منها الجزء العلوي لمسلة صغيرة من الحجر الرملي تعود إلى عهد الملك تتي من الدولة القديمة. ومن آثار عصر الدولة الوسطى، مسلة من الجرانيت الأحمر أقامها الملك سنوسرت الأول، وبقايا مسلة للفرعون تحتمس الثالث، وعدد من اللوحات من الحجر الجيري وجزء من تمثال أثري. ومن آثار عصر الدولة الحديثة، عمود مرنبتاج الموجود في منطقة المعابد، وتمثال الملك سيتي الثاني من الحجر الجيري، وبقايا معبد للملك رمسيس الثالث، وعدد من تيجان الأعمدة وأجزاء من أعمدة وتماثيل لأبو الهول.\n\nبابليون\nتقع مدينة بابليون في منطقة القاهرة القبطية حالياً، وقام بإنشائها رمسيس الثاني واتخذت اسمها من أسرى البابليين الذين ثاروا عليه، فبنى بها القلعة التي اعتقلهم فيها، ثم أطلق الاسم على المدينة بأكملها. واشتهرت المدينة في العصر الروماني في عهد الإمبراطور أغسطس، وأمر بإعادة بنائها الإمبراطور تراجان عام 130 ق.م وحول الحصن إلى مدينة عسكرية، ورمم الحصن ووسعه الإمبراطور الروماني أركاديوس في القرن الرابع الميلادي. استعمل في بناء الحصن أحجار أخذت من معابد فرعونية وأكملت بالطوب الأحمر ولم يبق من مباني الحصن حالياً سوى الباب القبلي الذي يكتنفه برجان كبيران، وبنى فوق أحد البرجين الكنيسة المعلقة، كما بني فوق البرج الآخر كنيسة مار جرجس الروماني للروم الأرثوذكس، وعلى باقي السور بنيت كنيسة القديس أبو سرجة وكنيسة العذراء وقصرية الريحان ودير مار جرجس للراهبات وكنيسة القديسة بربارة ومعبد لليهود. يعرف الحصن الروماني بقصر الشمع أو قلعة بابليون وتبلغ مساحته حوالي نصف كيلومتر مربع، ويقع بداخله المتحف القبطي. في عام 641 م سقط الحصن في يد عمرو بن العاص بعد حصار دام نحو سبعة أشهر في 18 ربيع الآخر 20 هـ/16 أبريل 641 م، وكان سقوطه إيذاناً بدخول الإسلام في مصر. اختار عمرو بن العاص مكان إستراتيجي شمال حصن بابليون وأقام فيه مدينة الفسطاط وداخلها حصن بابليون لتكون مدينة للجند العرب.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nالفسطاط\nاتخذت الفسطاط اسمها من خيمة عمرو بن العاص التي أقامها في وسط معسكره، وأنشأها عمرو بن العاص شمال حصن بابليون، وأمر بتخطيطها لتكون أول عاصمة للإسلام في مصر بدلاً من الإسكندرية، وفي وسط المدينة أقام مسجداً للصلاة سمي باسمه واشتهر بمناراته الأربعة، وخططت الأرض حوله إلى أحياء، وولى عمرو بن العاص أربعة من المسلمين لتنظيم المدينة وهم معاوية بن خديج التجيبي، شريك بن سمي الغطيفي، عمرو بن محزم الخولاني، جبريل بن ناشرة المعافري. اشتهرت الفسطاط بشوارعها المرصوفة ومنازلها الفسيحة التي تتوسطها نافورات المياه والحدائق الداخلية، وتعددت بالمدينة الأسواق التي كان يقع معظمها على شاطئ نهر النيل وذلك بخلاف الأسواق حول الجامع. تميز اختيار موقع المدينة بسهولة الدفاع عنه لأسباب طبيعية فالنيل يحدها من الغرب وجبل المقطم من الشرق واللذان شكلا حاجزا طبيعياً ضد أي اعتداء خارجي.\n\nالعسكر\nالعسكر هي ثاني العواصم الإسلامية في مصر، وأنشأها العباسيون في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط، وأقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيه صالح بن علي دار الإمارة وثكنات الجند أو دار العسكر، ومنه اتخذت المدينة اسمها، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر. تعتبر المدينة امتداداً للاتجاهات التخطيطية والعمرانية لمدينة الفسطاط، وعظمت بها العمارة وشيدت المساكن والقصور وتوسع عمرانها حتى التحمت بالفسطاط، وحكم مصر منها 65 والياً على امتداد 120 عاماً، ويرجح أن موقعها كان بالقرب من حي السيدة زينب حالياً.\n\nالقطائع\nالقطائع هي المدينة التي أسسها أحمد بن طولون، لتصبح بذلك ثالث عاصمة إسلامية في مصر، ويرجع اسمها إلى نظام تخطيطها المنقول عن مدينة سامراء التي شب فيها بن طولون، وهو التخطيط المتقاطع المكون من قطع سكنية كل منها لجماعة من السكان تربطهم رابطة أو طبقة أو مستوى واحد، يطلق عليها اسم القطع. شيدت المدينة في الأرض الفضاء بين مدينة العسكر وجبل المقطم، ووضعت أولى خططها عام 256 هـ/870 م، وبعد ست سنوات في عام 876 م احتفل ابن طولون بوضع أساس الجامع الذي سمي باسمه على جبل يشكر، والذي انتهى بناؤه في سنتين، ويقع في وسط المدينة، ويعد من أكبر مساجد العالم الإسلامي بمساحة تبلغ 26500 متر مربع، واشتهر باسم الجامع المعلق إذ يصعد إلى أبوابه بسلالم دائرية الشكل، كما أنشأ ابن طولون أول مستشفى في مصر بمنطقة البساتين. وانتقل إلى المدينة كل من له صلة بالحكم أو إدارة البلاد وأفراد الجيش، ولم يكن مسموحاً للعامة بالسكن فيها. ظلت القطائع عاصمة مصر خلال الحكم الطولوني الذي استمر 27 عاماً حتى سنة 293 هـ/905 م، مع قدوم الجيش العباسي إلى مصر، والذي محى القطائع وحولها إلى أطلال مع الإبقاء على الجامع، وعادت مدينة العسكر مقراً للحكم حتى دخول الفاطميين.\n\nقاهرة المعز\nبعد قرابة المائة عام على إنشاء القطائع، قدم إلى مصر جيش الفاطميين من المغرب بقيادة جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفة المعز لدين الله، ووصل إلى الفسطاط في 11 شعبان 358 هـ/يوليو 969 م، ودخلها في اليوم التالي، ونزل مع جنوده في الفراغ الواقع شمال شرقي القطائع وأخذ في وضع أساس القاعدة الفاطمية الجديدة في 17 شعبان 385 هـ/7 يوليو 969 م، والتي سماها «القاهرة»، كما وضع أساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير في 18 شعبان 358 هـ، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الأزهر في جمادي الأول سنة 359 هـ/أبريل 970 م. أنشئت المدينة على مساحة 340 فدان، وبني حولها سور من اللبن مربع الشكل طول كل من ضلعيه الشمالي والجنوبي 1500 ذراع، وضلعيه الشرقي والغربي 1700 ذراع، وبكل ضلع من أضلاع السور بوابتان، فالضلع الشمالي به باب النصر وباب الفتوح، والشرقي به باب البرقية (الغريب) والقراطين (المحروق)، والجنوبي يواجه الفسطاط عند باب الخلق وبه باب زويلة (المتولي) وباب الفرج، والغربي به باب القنطرة وباب سعادة. بدأت المدينة كمدينة عسكرية تشتمل على مساكن الأمراء ودواوين الحكومة وخزائن المال، وفي سنة 973 تحولت إلى عاصمة الدولة الفاطمية عندما انتقل إليها المعز لدين الله من المغرب، وأطلق عليها قاهرة المعز. بعد انقضاء 120 سنة من تأسيس القاهرة رأى أمير الجيوش بدر الجمالي وكان وزيراً للخليفة المستنصر بالله أن الناس شيدوا خارج سور القاهرة بسبب اتساع العمران، فأحاطها بسور وصله بسور جوهر عام 480 هـ/1087 م، وأقام السور الجديد من اللبن والأبواب من الحجارة.\n\nالعصر الأيوبي\nأرسل السلطان نور الدين محمود حملة إلى مصر لطرد الصليبيين بقيادة أسد الدين شيركوه، الذي اصطحب معه صلاح الدين ابن أخيه نجم الدين أيوب. وعقب وفاة شيركوه ولي الخليفة العاضد صلاح الدين وزارة مصر، فأصبح بذلك الرجل الأول في الدولة. ثم استبد صلاح الدين بالأمور وضعف أمر العاضد وهدم دار المعرفة وبناها مدرسة شافعية وبنى دار الغزل للمالكية وعزل قضاة الشيعة وأقام قاضياً شافعياً في مصر واستناب في جميع البلاد. وبدلاً من أن ينشئ صلاح الدين عاصمة جديدة، اتجه إلى ضم ضواحي المدينة الأربعة (الفسطاط والعسكر والقطائع والقاهرة الفاطمية) لتكون معاً عاصمة الدولة، فخرجت القاهرة عن نطاق أسوارها القديمة وامتد تخطيطها ليصل إلى قلعة الجبل، التي ظلت مقراً لحكم مصر في مختلف العصور التي تلت حكم الأيوبيين، وحتى عصر الخديوي إسماعيل الذي نقل مقر الحكم إلى قصر عابدين. وفي عام 569 هـ انتدب بهاء الدين قراقوش لمد سور حول القاهرة بحدودها الجديدة، فزاد في سور القاهرة الممتد من باب القتطرة إلى باب الشعرية، ومن باب الشعرية إلى باب البحر، ثم زاد في الجزء الذي يلي باب النصر إلى برج الظفر ومن هذا البرج إلى برج البرقية ومنه إلى درب بطوط وإلى خارج باب الوزير ليتصل بسور قلعة الجبل. ومن معالم تلك الحقبة التي ما زالت باقية، سواقي عيون بئر يوسف وقناطر مجرى المياه التي تحمل المياه إلى القلعة.\n\nالعصر المملوكي\nيعد عصر المماليك هو العصر الذهبي للقاهرة، ولا سيما بعدما خفت وطأة الحروب الصليبية في الشام، وانتصر المماليك على المغول. ففي عهد الظاهر بيبرس امتدت القاهرة في اتجاه الشمال خارج أسوارها في حي الحسينية، وشيد مسجداً رائعاً يعرف اليوم باسم جامع الظاهر وكان اسمه قديماً جامع الصافية، كما شيد العديد من المباني في قلعة صلاح الدين كدار الذهب، وأنشأ الأسواق والجسور والقناطر، وشاركه أمراؤه في بناء العديد من العمائر والرباع والخانات والدور والمساجد والحمامات التي أضافت لمسة من الجلال والجمال على المدينة.\n\n وفي عهد أسرة قلاوون التي حكمت مصر قرابة المائة عام، شيد المنصور قلاوون طائفة من العمائر النادرة، منها مدرسة الجليلة وقبته أو ضريحه، وأنشأ المارستان وجعله وقفاً لجميع الطوائف من الملك حتى العبيد، وما زال جزء منه قائماً إلى اليوم. وفي أيام السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، امتدت القاهرة جهة الشمال عبر الصحراء والشمال الغربي والغرب أيضاً بما طرحه النيل من طمي أثمر تدريجياً عن أرض جديدة غرب القاهرة، فلم يترك أمراء المماليك قطعة أرض داخل القاهرة إلا وأقاموا فيها المساجد والمدارس والحمامات والسبل والوكالات والأضرحة، فعم الرخاء على المدينة وازدهرت التجارة وتسابق الأمراء والأعيان على تشييد أبهى فنون العمارة. وأحب السلطان الناصر العمارة فرصع القاهرة بأفخم المباني، وأنشأ تحت قلعة صلاح الدين ميداناً للألعاب والمسابقات بين الأمراء، وعمر كثيراً من القصور داخل القلعة، وشيد جامعه ذا المئذنتين الذي ما زال قائماً حتى الآن، وفي أيامه زار مصر الرحالة المسلم ابن بطوطة في عام 1326 فقال عنها «قهرت قاهرتها الأمم، وتملكت ملوكها نواصي العرب والعجم»، وفي أثناء حكم المماليك البحرية ولد المؤرخ تقي الدين المقريزي، الذي ألف موسوعة هامة عن خطط مصر وعن القاهرة بوجه خاص وصفت جمال عمارة القاهرة وفنونها. وفي أيام السلطان حسن بن قلاوون شيدت عمارة جليلة تمثلت في مدرسة ومسجد السلطان حسن، الذي يعد أجمل مساجد القاهرة. وفي عهد المماليك الجراكسة ظهر حبهم للعمائر الجميلة والذوق السليم، فشيد سلاطينهم وأمراؤهم العمائر والمساجد ومنها مسجد الملك الظاهر برقوق بجوار مدرسة الناصر قلاوون، وخانقاه الملك الناصر بن برقوق، وهي بناء ضخم صمم ليخدم عدة أغراض، فهو ضريح لآل برقوق ومدرسة للعلوم ومسجد وخانقاه فخمة، ومسجد الملك المؤيد شيخ بجوار باب زويلة، ومسجد السلطان الأشرف برسباي، ومسجد السلطان الأشرف قايتباي، ومسجد السلطان قنصوه الغوري.\n\nالعصر العثماني\nاستولى السلطان سليم على مصر وشرع في تأييد سلطته، فجعل عليها حاكماً يلقب بالباشا، وليضمن عدم خروج الباشا على الآستانة ويستقل بمصر، جعل في مصر ثلاث إدارات كل منها يراقب الآخر، حتى لا يخشى من اتحادها أو تمردها، فكانت القوة الأولى هي «الباشا» وأهم واجباته هي إبلاغ الأوامر السلطانية لرجال الحكومة والشعب ومراقبة تنفيذها، والقوة الثانية هي «الوجاقات الست» وواجبها هو حفظ النظام والدفاع عن القطر المصري، وتوزعت في القاهرة والمراكز الرئيسية، أما القوة الثالثة فهي «المماليك» وهم بقايا المماليك البحرية والجراكسة، وواجبهم حفظ التوازن بين الباشا والوجاقات لأنهم أعداء لكلا الفريقين. وظل أمراء المماليك هم أصحاب القوة الفعلية بالبلاد، وزاد نفوذهم مع تقلص نفوذ الباب العالي وتقلص نفوذ ولاته في مصر. ومن آثار تلك الحقبة التي ما زالت باقية مسجد محمد بك أبو الذهب تجاه الجامع الأزهر، وعمائر عبد الرحمن كتخدا «محافظ مصر»، والذي كان مغرماً بالبناء فأنشأ وجدد الكثير من المساجد والسبل والأضرحة، وكان في مقدمة الساعين لتجميل القاهرة، ويتجلى ذلك في سبيله الرائع الواقع في ملتقى شارعي النحاسيين والجمالية والمعروف باسمه حتى اليوم، كما أنشأ بالقرب من باب الفتوح مسجداً وكتاباً، وزاد في مقصورة الجامع الأزهر وبنى به محراباً جديداً وأقام له منبراً وأنشأ له باباً عظيماً وبنى بأعلاه مكتباً لتعليم الأيتام من أطفال المسلمين، وبنى المدرسة الطيبرسية، وأنشأ عند باب البرقية «باب الغريب» جامعاً ومكتباً، وجامعاً ومكتباً وساقية ومنارة جهة الأزبكية، كما بنى المشهد الحسيني، ومشاهد السيدة زينب والسيدة سكينة والسيدة عائشة والسيدة فاطمة والسيدة رقية، وجدد المارستان المنصوري، وكانت دار سكناه بحارة عابدين من الدور العظيمة المحكمة الوضع والإتقان.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nعصر الأسرة العلوية\nأسس محمد علي الأسرة العلوية في مصر وأرسى خلال حكمه أسس النهضة الحديثة، وانتقل بمصر من الاضمحلال الذي سيطر عليها خلال حكم العثمانيين إلى مشارف العصر الحديث، وارتقى بها إلى رتب الدول المتقدمة. أدرك محمد علي بعبقريته الفطرية الفذة أن السبيل لبناء النهضة هو الارتقاء بالعلوم والإدارة والصناعة والزراعة، فأنشأ المدارس الحديثة وأرسل البعثات العلمية وأعاد تنظيم الجيش والإدارة الحكومية وشيد دور الصناعة بأنواعها والتي تركزت بمنطقة السبتية، كما أقام الجسور والقناطر وحفر الترع. واهتم محمد علي بالقاهرة فأمر بتنظيم وتوسيع وتنظيف وإنارة شوارعها، وأزال الأنقاض المحيطة بها وردم بها بركها، وكون في عام 1834 مجلساً للإشراف على تجميل القاهرة، كما استقدم الفنانين والعمال المهرة من فرنسا وإيطاليا وتركيا لبناء القصور واشترط عليهم تعيين أربعة من المصريين مع كل منهم ليتعلموا حرفتهم، ومن أشهر القصور التي شيدها قصر الجوهرة وقصر القبة وقصر الحرم وقصر الأزبكية وقصر النيل، وقام أيضاً ببناء جامعه بالقلعة، والذي تم تصميمه على غرار مسجد السلطان أحمد بالآستانة. وفي أبريل 1847 انتقلت ولاية مصر من محمد علي إلى إبراهيم باشا، والذي اهتم بتقوية الجيش والأسطول ونظم جمعية الحقانية لتنظيم سير القضايا، وشيد قصر الروضة والقصر العالي، وفي عهده تم ردم بركة الأزبكية تماماً وحولت إلى متنزه ضخم. وفي عهد عباس باشا الأول منح امتياز إنشاء خط سكك حديدية بين القاهرة والإسكندرية للبريطانيين عام 1851، وأنشئ حي العباسية في صحراء شمال شرق القاهرة عام 1849 بغرض إقامة ثكنات عسكرية، كما أقام فيها سراي الباشا أو «سراي الحصوة» ومدرسة حربية ومستشفى. عقب وفاة عباس الأول آل حكم مصر إلى سعيد باشا، فافتتح في عهده خط السكك الحديدية بين القاهرة والإسكندرية عام 1854، وأنشئت المحطة الرئيسية للسكك الحديدية بباب الحديد عام 1856، وبوفاته انتقل حكم مصر إلى إسماعيل باشا عام 1863.\n\nعصر الخديوي إسماعيل\nيعود لقب القاهرة الخديوية إلى أول حاكم لمصر يحمل هذا اللقب وهو الخديوي إسماعيل، والذي تولى عرش مصر في 18 يناير 1863، فمنح القاهرة وجهاً جديداً متألقاً، وحدد معالمها الحضارية من خلال إنجازات بقيت محفورة على جدران مبانيها وشوارعها الحديثة. كانت القاهرة عند تولي إسماعيل باشا عرش مصر يبلغ تعدادها 270 ألف نسمة وتمتد من منطقة القلعة بسفح المقطم شرقاً إلى مدافن الأزبكية وميدان العتبة والمناصرة غرباً، وساد على أحيائها الانحلال العمراني مما أثار حماس إسماعيل باشا لصنع ثورة عمرانية بعاصمة البلاد ترقى بها إلى مصاف العواصم الأوروبية، ولتكون «باريس الشرق»، فطلب إسماعيل باشا من الإمبراطور نابليون الثالث أن يقوم هاوسمان المهندس العالمي بتخطيط القاهرة على غرار التخطيط الجديد لباريس، واستغرق إعداد وتصميم وتنفيذ المشروع خمس سنوات، وفي عام 1872 افتتح الخديوي إسماعيل شارع محمد علي «القلعة»، كما شق شارع «كلوت بك» عام 1875، وأنشأ دار الأوبرا، والكتب خانة، وكان من أهم القصور التي شيدت خلال تلك الحقبة قصر عابدين، الذي بدأ إنشاؤه في غام 1863، وأصبح مقر الحكم بدلاً من القلعة في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل، ويعود اسم القصر إلى أنه بني مكان قصر «عابدين بك»، وطلب إسماعيل باشا الاحتفاظ باسم عابدين للقصر وميدانه. وفي فترة لاحقة أنشئ كوبري قصر النيل وكوبري أبو العلا ليصلا القاهرة بجزيرة الزمالك والجيزة، وأدخل خط الترام إلى شوارع القاهرة عام 1896 لربط العتبة الخضراء بالعباسية.\n\nالقاهرة المعاصرة\nفي بداية القرن العشرين شهدت مدينة القاهرة تطوراً هائلاً نتيجة قدوم رجال الأعمال الأجانب، وتم إنشاء العديد من الوكالات والمحال التجارية والتي أصبحت فيما بعد علامات تجارية شهيرة مثل جروبي وغيره، كذلك شهدت توسعاً من خلال ربط شبرا بالقاهرة عام 1902، وربط حي الظاهر بالسيدة زينب وغرب الأزبكية عام 1903، وبدأ نمو حي الفجالة وحي التوفيقية، كما بدأ إنشاء حي جاردن سيتي عام 1906، وتعمير حي الزمالك عام 1905، وبدأ العمل في ضاحية مصر الجديدة عام 1906، أما ضاحية المعادي فنشأت عام 1907.\nوخلال ثورة 1919 كانت القاهرة هي مركز الاحتجاجات والتي كانت تتخذ من بيت سعد زغلول (بيت الأمة) مقراً لها، وعقب الثورة والانتهاء من تأسيس بنك مصر أصبحت القاهرة مركز ومقر للعديد من الشركات والمشروعات المصرية التي نشأت واحدة تلو الأخرى، وبلغت القاهرة في العشرينيات مستوى عال من الرقي والتحضر، ففي عام 1921 تم اختيارها لتنظيم مؤتمر القاهرة الذي جمع العديد من قادة أوروبا والشرق الأوسط لبحث تداعيات الحرب العالمية الأولى، كذلك في عام 1925 حصلت على وسام أجمل وأنظف مدينة في دول حوض البحر المتوسط باعتبارها مدينة الأناقة في تصميم مبانيها ونظافة شوارعها وانتظام حركة المرور بها.\n\nوفي نوفمبر 1943 أثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية، شهدت القاهرة اجتماع قادة الحلفاء في مؤتمر القاهرة والذي حضره الرئيس فرانكلين روزفلت وونستون تشرشل والقائد الصيني تشان كاي شيك ورئيس وزراء تركيا عصمت إينونو، وكان المؤتمر بمثابة نقطة فارقة بصدور إعلان القاهرة الذي تم التوقيع عليه يوم 27 نوفمبر 1943 ونص على نشر قوات في فرنسا وضرورة انسحاب اليابان من المقاطعات الصينية، واستمرار المعارك حتى الاستسلام غير المشروط.\n\nوفي 26 يناير 1952 عقب وقوع موقعة الإسماعيلية يوم 25 يناير بين القوات البريطانية وقوات الشرطة المصرية، قام مجهولون بإشعال حرائق في مدينة القاهرة التهمت الكثير من الأماكن العامة والفنادق والسينيمات والمحلات تجارية والمكاتب، كما أسفرت عن عشرات الضحايا. أدت تلك الأحداث إلى استقالة وزارة الوفد ذات الشعبية الجماهيرية، وتولى الوزارة علي ماهر باشا، وأعلنت الأحكام العرفية في البلاد، وتلاها في يوليو قيام الضباط الأحرار بالتحرك كبداية لأحداث ثورة 23 يوليو، وكانت القاهرة محطة فاصلة في تلك الأحداث، بالرغم من أن الملك فاروق وحاشيته كانوا بالإسكندرية، إلا أن حصار قصر عابدين والاستيلاء على القيادة العامة للجيش المصري تسبب في رضوخ الملك فاروق لمطالب الحركة، ووافق على مغادرة البلاد في 26 يوليو والتنازل عن العرش لابنه.\nوعقب حرب 1967 ونتيجة للمعارك تم إجلاء سكان محافظات القناة (بورسعيد، الإسماعيلية، السويس)، وكانت القاهرة من أكثر المحافظات استقبالاً للنازحين والتي كانت بأعداد كبيرة، تسببت في اندلاع الأزمة العقارية وقتها وارتفاع أسعارها بشكل متزايد، وترتب عليها ظهور العديد من المناطق السكنية مثل منشأة ناصر وغيرها.\n\nوفي أعقاب حرب أكتوبر وبداية عصر الانفتاح الاقتصادي شهدت القاهرة موجة هجرة واسعة من سكان الأقاليم بغرض التعليم أو العمل، وترتب عليها تغير ديموغرافيا المدينة عما كانت عليه، حيث بدأت عمليات هدم القصور القديمة لبناء أبنية سكنية وكذلك شهدت فترة الثمانينات والتسعينيات أوسع عمليات التعدي والبناء على الأراضي الزراعية، مما ترتب عليها فقدان القاهرة معظم مساحاتها الخضراء. شهد الربع الأخير من القرن العشرين مرحلة بناء المدن الجديدة، فبعد إنشاء مدينة نصر في عهد ناصر ومدينة 15 مايو ومدينة السلام في عهد السادات، شهد عهد مبارك إنشاء القاهرة الجديدة ومدينة بدر والشروق، وشهد أيضاً تشغيل مترو الأنفاق وإنشاء الطريق الدائري ليكون أكبر طريق بري يربط القاهرة الكبرى ببعضها.\nفي 25 يناير 2011 انطلقت مجموعة من التظاهرات والاحتجاجات الشعبية ذات الطابع الاجتماعي والسياسي، وكان ميدان التحرير بالقاهرة أبرز أماكن هذه المظاهرات حيث شهد أعداداً وصفت بالمليونية، كما شهدت القاهرة أيضاً أحداث لاحقة مثل أحداث مسرح البالون، أحداث ماسبيرو، أحداث محمد محمود، أحداث مجلس الوزراء، أحداث العباسية.\nوعقب تولي محمد مرسي رئاسة الجمهورية اتخذ عدة إجراءات وأصدر قرارات أثارت ضده احتجاجات ومظاهرات، كان أبرزها أحداث قصر الاتحادية مما أسفر عن وقوع ضحايا، وفي 30 يونيو 2013 خرجت مظاهرات حاشدة من المعارضين لحكم محمد مرسي في الميادين المصرية وعلى رأسها ميدان التحرير مطالبين بانتخابات رئاسية مبكرة ورحيل النظام.\n\nتوسعات المدينة\nاعتمدت الحكومة المصرية خطة إستراتيجية قومية لغزو الصحراء وإقامة مجتمعات عمرانية جديدة خارج وادي النيل ودلتاه لتكون مراكز حضارية ومناطق جذب سكاني واقتصادي بهدف إعادة توزيع السكان والأنشطة المختلفة توزيعاً متوازناً على أنحاء جمهورية مصر العربية، وبدأت تلك المشاريع خلال العهد الملكي مع إنشاء ضاحية مصر الجديدة «هليوبوليس» التي تعد أهم التجارب على مستوى العالم في مجال إنشاء المدن الجديدة خلال النصف الأول من القرن العشرين، والتي تعود فكرة إنشائها إلى عام 1905، واستوحي تخطيطها من المدن الحدائقية التي شيدت في أوروبا نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، فكان انتشار الفراغات الحضرية الكبيرة والشوارع المستقيمة المتسعة والتي خططت في هيئة حي عمراني راق يضاهي الأحياء الأوروبية. وفي أعقاب ثورة 23 يوليو 1952 أنشئت مدينة نصر بقرار من الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر بهدف التوسع العمراني في المنطقة الصحراوية شمال شرق القاهرة وخصوصاً شرق حي العباسية بعيداً عن الأراضي الزراعية، وأعطى إشارة البدء لإنشاء مدينة متكاملة بأسلوب حضاري راق وطريقة عمرانية متميزة أطلق عليها «مدينة نصر». نفذ التخطيط الأولي والتصاميم المعمارية لمشروع المدينة المهندس المعماري سيد كريم، على مساحة تصل لأكثر من 250 كم مربع وتمتد في الشرق من طريق مصر/السويس حتى الكيلو 51 وتقاطعه مع طريق القطامية، وفي الغرب من شارع صلاح سالم وفي الشمال حي مصر الجديدة وفي الجنوب المقطم. وفي عام 1978 بدأ إنشاء مدينة 15 مايو التي تعد إحدى مدن الجيل الأول من المجتمعات العمرانية الجديدة التي قامت بإنشائها وزارة الإسكان والتي تعود تسميتها نسبة إلى ثورة التصحيح في 15 مايو 1971، ويربط مدينة 15 مايو بالقاهرة طريقان رئيسيان هما كورنيش النيل وطريق الأوتوستراد، وبدأت في استقبال سكانها بعد عامين فقط من البدء في تنفيذها. وفي عام 1979 صدر قرار إنشاء مدينة القاهرة الجديدة والتي توسعت بأحيائها المعروفة الأمل والرحاب ومدينتي والتجمع الأول والثالث والخامس.\nوفي عام 1982 صدر قرار رئيس مجلس الوزراء بإنشاء مدينة بدر بطريق القاهرة/السويس على مساحة 18454.43 فدان، منها 7018 فدان مناطق سكنية، و2173 فدان مناطق خدمية. وفي عام 1995 صدر قرار جمهوري بإنشاء مدينة الشروق على مساحة 16.11 ألف فدان منها 9200 فدان كتلة عمرانية، أضيف إليها 5302 فدان عام 2015.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nالموقع\nتقع القاهرة على جوانب جزر نهر النيل في شمال مصر، مباشرة جنوب شرق النقطة التي يترك فيها نهر النيل واديه محصوراً فيِ الصحراء منقسماً إلى فرعين داخل منطقة دلتا النيل المنخفضة. بني الجزء الغربي على نموذج مدينة باريس مِن قبل حاكم مصر الخديوي إسماعيل في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر، والذي تميز بالأحياء الواسعة والحدائق العامة والمناطق المفتوحة. أما القسم الشرقي الأقدم للمدينة فتوسع بشكل عشوائي على مدى القرون، وامتلأ بالطرقِ الصغيرة والمباني المزدحمة. بينما يمتلئ غرب القاهرة بالبنايات الحكومية والهندسة المعمارية الحديثة، وأصبح الجزء الأهم في القاهرة، ويحوي النصف الشرقي الآثار التاريخية للمدينة على مر العصور لما يوجد به من مساجد وكنائس عتيقة ومباني أثرية ومعالم قديمة، كما توسعت المدينة شرقاً بإنشاء حي مدينة نصر الذي يعتبر من أكبر أحياء القاهرة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nتنقسم المدينة إلى أربع مناطق رئيسية هي:\n\nالمنطقة الشرقية وتضم 9 أحياء هي: (أول السلام، ثان السلام، المرج، عين شمس، المطرية، مصر الجديدة، النزهة، غرب مدينة نصر، شرق مدينة نصر).\nالمنطقة الغربية وتضم 9 أحياء هي: (الوايلي، باب الشعرية، منشأة ناصر، عابدين، الموسكي، الأزبيكة، بولاق، وسط، غرب).\nالمنطقة الشمالية وتضم 8 أحياء هي: (الزيتون، حدائق القبة، الأميرية، الزاوية الحمراء، الشرابية، الساحل، شبرا، روض الفرج).\nالمنطقة الجنوبية وتضم 11 حي هم: (السيدة زينب، مصر القديمة، الخليفة، المقطم، البساتين، دار السلام، المعادي، طره، حلوان، التبين، 15 مايو).\n\nالمناخ\nيتصف مناخ القاهرة بالاعتدال معظم أيام السنة ويتراوح المعدل اليومي لدرجة الحرارة خلال فصل الصيف بين 22 درجة مئوية و34 درجة مئوية في حين يتراوح المعدل اليومي خلال فصل الشتاء بين 18 درجة مئوية و9 درجة مئوية. ويمكن اعتبار أن هناك موسمين خلال العام صيف ساخن من مايو إلى أكتوبر، وشتاء معتدل من نوفمبر إلى أبريل، ويتميز مناخ القاهرة أيضاً بأنه جاف جداً، ويسقط المطر بكثافة منخفضة خلال فصل الشتاء، وترتفع مستويات الرطوبة خلال الصيف، وأحياناً تتعرض القاهرة لهبوب بعض الرياح الساخنة المحملة بالغبار خلال الفترة الممتدة بين شهري مارس ويونيو وتعرف باسم رياح الخماسين.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان القاهرة بنهاية عام 2018 9.7 مليون نسمة بنسبة 10.6% من إجمالي تعداد سكان مصر. لتكون بذلك أكثر مدن مصر المأهولة بالسكان، وأكثرها ازدحاماً بما تحتويه من هيكل عرقي وبنية أساسية ووظائف محلية ودولية متعددة، كما ينزح إليها الآلاف يومياً من المحافظات بسبب عملهم داخل القاهرة أو إنجاز المصالح الشخصية أو العلاج نتيجة لتركز الاستثمارات والأجهزة الحكومية وكبرى المستشفيات بها.\n\nاللغة\nيتحدث سكان القاهرة اللغة العربية، إلا أن العربية المحكية في القاهرة تختلف عن تلك المحكية في مصر الوسطى والعليا، والعربية المصرية هي الأهم بين أشكال العربية الحديثة المحكية في المنطقة، ومرد ذلك أساسا أن صناعة السينما المصرية ومركزها القاهرة هي الأكبر في الوطن العربي ويتم عرض الأفلام المصرية في المنطقة العربية دون ترجمة أو دوبلاج. بخلاف الأخبار وما شابهها، كما أن الأفلام لا تسجل باستخدام الفصحى - لغة كتابة الوطن العربي بأسره - بل تستخدم اللغة المحكية للمنطقة، وبالتالي كانت اللهجة المستخدمة هي المصرية لمعظم هذه الأفلام، ولهذا السبب فإن العربية المصرية وخاصّة اللهجة القاهرية مفهومة في عموم المنطقة العربية. العربية الفصحى هي ومنذ السيطرة العربية على مصر في القرن السابع لغة الكتابة والأدب، ولا تستخدم القبطية إلا كلغة طقسية للكنيسة الأرثوذكسية القبطية، والقبطية هي استمرار للغة المصرية القديمة وتكتب بحروف مشتقة من اليونانية وهي غير محكية اليوم إلا كلغة مقدسة. كلغات أجنبية فإن الإنجليزية والفرنسية تستخدم كلغة نخبوية على نطاق ضيق.\n\nالدين\nالإسلام هو الدين الرسمي لمصر بما فيها مدينة القاهرة وذلك طبقاً للدستور المصري، ويعترف بحقوق أتباع الديانات الثلاث اليهودية والمسيحية والإسلام، وغالبية سكان المدينة من المسلمين من أهل السنة والجماعة، وأكثر الأقلية من المسيحيين الأرثوذكس، والأقليات الأخرى من طوائف مسيحية بجانب اليهود. أهم المؤسسات الدينية العاملة في الدولة هي الجامع الأزهر الذي يعتبر أحد أهم أعمدة الإسلام السني في العالم، كذلك تحتل الكنيسة القبطية الأرثوذكسية مكانة هامة باعتبارها كنيسة وطنية تمثل غالبية مسيحيي مصر، أما اليهود فليس لهم مؤسسة دينية ترعاهم لقلة عددهم ولكن يرعى شئونهم طائفة خاصة بديانتهم.\n\nالثقافة\nالعمارة\nتتميز القاهرة كمدينة تاريخية بتراثها العريق واحتضانها لمجموعة فريدة من العمائر التي تعكس تطور العمارة الإسلامية بالمدينة على مدار ألف وثلاثمائة عام وأصبح الآن هذا التطور البنائي متحفاً مفتوحاُ للعمارة يعرض في ردهاته عمائر كل مرحلة من مراحل تقدم المدينة في حلقة متصلة من الأساليب المعمارية تتجلى في مبانيها كالمساجد والزوايا والمدارس والتكايا والقصور والدور والحمامات والأسبلة والقناطر والوكالات والخانات والأسواق فضلاً عن قلاعها وأسوارها وأبوابها.\nاستلهمت العمارة القاهرية المعاصرة أفكارها ومفرداتها من التراث المعماري المصري. ففي بدايات القرن العشرين اتجه بعض المعماريين إلى استعمال العناصر الشكلية للطراز الفرعوني مثل البوابات والأعمدة وقلدوها بالمواد والإنشاءات الحديثة، وفي فترة التسعينيات استلهم الطراز الفرعوني في التصميم من خلال نقل مفردات المعبد الفرعوني إلى واجهات المبنى، والتركيز على استخدام الشكل الهرمي كما في نصب الجندي المجهول بمدينة نصر. فيما استلهم بعض المعماريين تصميماتهم من التراث المعماري الإسلامي، وظهرت لذلك عدة شواهد في النصف الأول من القرن العشرين مثل معهد الموسيقى العربية بشارع رمسيس (1929) ومبنى جمعية المهندسين المصرية بنفس الشارع (1935)، وفي فترة الثمانينيات والتسعينيات بدأت تظهر نماذج لإعادة هذا الفكر المعماري منها مبنى مركز الدراسات التخطيطية والمعمارية بمصر الجديدة، ومبنى قاعة النيل للفنون التشكيلية بالجزيرة، والمباني العالية في أبراج مركز التجارة العالمي بكورنيش النيل، والذي يعطي دلالة واضحة على إمكانية الاستفادة من التراث الإسلامي مع معطيات العمارة المعاصرة والتي تركز على استخدام المباني العالية خاصة في المدن الكبرى كأحد المحددات الاقتصادية نظرا لارتفاع أسعار الأراضي.\n\nالإعلام\nتصدر الصحف المصرية الرئيسية الرسمية وغير الرسمية من القاهرة، ومنها مؤسسة الأهرام أعرق المؤسسات الصحفية في مصر وتصدر عنها جريدة الأهرام اليومية والأهرام إيبدو وجريدة المساء ومجلة العربي ومجلات أخرى، ودار أخبار اليوم والتي يصدر عنها جريدة الأخبار اليومية وأخبار اليوم الأسبوعية والعديد من المجلات، ودار التحرير ويصدر عنها جريدة الجمهورية، ويصدر أيضا في القاهرة العديد من الصحف الخاصة مثل جريدة المصري اليوم وجريدة الوفد والدستور وروز اليوسف وغيرها، وكذلك يوجد بالقاهرة مقر وكالة أنباء الشرق الأوسط، وهي وكالة الأنباء الرئيسية في مصر. والقاهرة هي مقر قنوات مبنى الإذاعة والتلفزيون بماسبيرو الذي تنطلق منه القنوات الإذاعية والتلفزيونية الحكومية.\n\nالفنون\nتزخر القاهرة بالفنانين التشكيليين والنحاتين والمبدعين الفنيين المتواجدين بها بصفة دائمة، وتعد مركزاً للفنون بمختلف أنواعها والأمسيات والندوات الثقافية والعروض المسرحية والسينمائي، وهي واحدة من المدن المبدعة المسجلة في قائمة اليونسكو للمدن المبدعة في مجال الفنون والحرف منذ 2017م، وتتمثل أبرز مظاهر الفنون في القاهرة في دار الأوبرا المصرية أو المركز الثقافي القومي بجزيرة الزمالك والذي تم تشييده كمنحة من الحكومة اليابانية لنظيرتها المصرية وبنيت الدار على الطراز الإسلامي وتم افتتاحها في 10 أكتوبر 1988 كدار بديلة لدار الأوبرا الخديوية التي بناها الخديوي إسماعيل عام 1869 واحترقت في 28 أكتوبر 1971 بعد أن ظلت منارة ثقافية لمدة 102 عام.\n\nالمطبخ\nالمطبخ القاهري هو رأس المطبخ المصري البسيط المتنوع، الذي يعطى للخبز فيه الأولوية ويُطلق عليه العيش باللهجة القاهرية كمرادف للفظ الحياة، ويُعد طبقيّ الفول والطعمية من أشهر عناصر الفطور القاهري. كذلك يُعد الكشري والمسقعة والمحشي والملوخية والفتة والكوارع والأرز بأنواعه من أبرز الأطباق الرئيسية. كما أن الشاي والقهوة وعصير القصب والعرقسوس والسوبيا من أكثر المشروبات شعبية في المدينة.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالقاهرة هي مركز مصر الاقتصادي، كونها عاصمة البلاد وأكثر المدن المصرية المأهولة بالسكان، وأقواها من حيث البنية التحتية، وبها تقع مقرات الشركات الكبرى، مركز التجارة العالمي، البورصة المصرية، البنك المركزي المصري، البنوك الرئيسية، وزارة التجارة والصناعة، وزارة الاستثمار، وزارة التعاون الدولي، وهي المقر الإقليمي للمنظمة العربية للتنمية الصناعية والتعدين واختارتها المنظمات والمؤسسات الدولية كمقر لمكاتبها الإقليمية في مصر مثل مؤسسة التمويل الدولية، البنك الدولي، برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، منظمة العمل الدولية، صندوق النقد الدولي، منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتنمية الصناعية، منظمة الأقطار العربية المصدرة للبترول، مجلس الوحدة الاقتصادية العربية. كما تضم عدة مناطق صناعية هي شق الثعبان على مساحة 1000 فدان، جنوب حلوان على مساحة 7 فدان، القطامية على مساحة 71 فدان، الروبيكي على مساحة 1629 فدان. بخلاف مراكز الصناعة اليدوية المتمثلة في مركز الحرف التقليدية بالفسطاط الذي يضم بين طياته ورشاً لأنشطة عديدة لفن النجارة من تطعيم بالصدف والأرابيسك، وفن الزجاج المعشق بالجبس والحلي والخيامية والخزف. بجانب أسواق التحف والتذكارات والعطور الشهيرة بخان الخليلي الذي يعد أشهر الخانات الإسلامية في العالم، ويقع في القاهرة الفاطمية على مشارف شارع المعز لدين الله، ويتخلله شبكة من الأسواق التقليدية وورش المقتنيات والمشغولات القضية والنحاسية والمذهبة والجلدية والخشبية والورقية. وفي عام 2009 احتلت القاهرة المركز السابع ضمن أبرز 50 مدينة مؤهلة لتقديم خدمات تكنولوجيا المعلومات بنظام التعهيد.\n\nالسياحة\nالقاهرة مدينة سياحية من الطراز الأول حيث تتعدد بها جميع المظاهر السياحية التي قد يحتاج إليها أي زائر، فبها العديد من المواقع الأثرية التي تعود لعصر الفراعنة، وأسوار المدينة القديمة التي ترجع إلى العصر الإسلامي، والمواقع الأثرية الإسلامية والمسيحية واليهودية الموجودة منذ دخول الأديان المختلفة لمصر.\nكما ينتشر بالمدينة مناطق التسوق الشهيرة، والعشرات من القصور والمساجد والكنائس والبوابات التاريخية والمباني العريقة من مختلف العصور بالإضافة للأماكن الثقافية والفنية والمسارح وغيرها، وينتشر بها أعداد كبيرة من الفنادق وأماكن الإقامة بمختلف أنواعها ودرجاتها.\nوتزخر كذلك بالمحميات الطبيعية البعيدة عن زحام قلب المدينة، والتي تبرز كمزارات باعثة على الهدوء والراحة والتأمل في الطبيعية. بخلاف التمتع برحلات نهر النيل الذي بني على ضفتيه درة ما تملكه المدينة من منشآت معمارية حديثة.\n\nالسياحة الترفيهية\nالقاهرة موقع لعدة مزارات سياحية ترفيهية هامة تضم حدائق ترفيهية على مساحات شاسعة يقبل عليها الكبار والصغار على حد سواء ومنها حديقة الأزبكية، الحديقة الدولية، حديقة الفسطاط،  والحديقة اليابانية بحلوان والتي تحتوي على بعض التماثيل التي ترمز لحقب تاريخية مختلفة، مثل تمثال زهرة اللوتس، تماثيل أفيال الشرق التي تحرس المكان، تمثال وجه الحياة وهو لامرأة تغمض عينيها مع ابتسامة خجل تعكس فكرة تقديس الشرق للمرأة، و48 تمثالاً لتلاميذ «شيبة» يجلس ليعلمهم الديانة البوذية أمام البحيرة الكبيرة، تمثال الحكمة الثلاثية وهو لثلاثة قرود تحث الإنسان على عدم التدخل في شؤون الغير «لا أسمع لا أرى لا أتكلم»، بالإضافة إلى بحيرة اللوتس وكشك الموسيقى والأشجار. ويأتي على رأس متنزهات القاهرة حديقة الأزهر التي تعد أحد أضخم حدائق القاهرة وواحدة من أكبر وأجمل حدائق العالم. تقع على مساحة 80 فدان كانت تستغل في الماضي كمقلب للقمامة والمخلفات لمدة تزيد على ألف عام. تم الإعلان عن المشروع في عام 1984 وافتتحت للزائرين في عام 2005 حيث استغرق إنشاؤها أكثر من 7 أعوام بتكلفة إجمالية تزيد على 100 مليون جنيه تحملتها مؤسسة أغاخان للعمارة الإسلامية.\nكما يبرز برج القاهرة كأحد معالم المدينة الحديثة والذي صممه المهندس نعوم شبيب، وتم بناؤه على شكل زهرة اللوتس المصرية من الخرسانة المسلحة خلال الفترة من 1956 وحتى 1961. يقف البرج على قاعدة من أحجار الجرانيت الأسواني التي سبق أن استخدمها المصريون القدماء في بناء معابدهم ومقابرهم، ويصل ارتفاعه إلى 187 متر وهو أعلى من الهرم الأكبر بالجيزة بحوالي 43 متر، ويتكون من 16 طابقاً، وتستغرق رحلة الوصول إلى قمة البرج 45 ثانية داخل المصعد للوصول إلى نهايته. يقع البرج في قلب القاهرة على جزيرة الزمالك بنهر النيل. ويوجد بقمته مطعم سياحي على منصة دوارة تسمح لرواد المطعم بمشاهدة معالم القاهرة من كل الجوانب. وتكتسب الرحلات النيلية شعبية متزايدة لدى السائحين بنوعيها ما بين رحلات بسيطة على ظهر مراكب خشبية عتيقة أو رحلات تتسم بالرفاهية على متن سفن عصرية.\n\nالسياحة البيئية\nبعيداً عن صخب وزحام القاهرة تظهر المحميات الطبيعية بالمدينة كأحد المزارات البارزة التي تبعث على الراحة والهدوء، وتتمثل في محمية وادي دجلة التي تقع شرق ضاحية المعادي بالصحراء الشرقية، والتي تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 60 كم مربع، وهي محمية غنية بالحفريات، وتتميز باحتوائها على العديد من الكائنات الحية الحيوانية مثل الغزلان، الأرانب الجبلية، الثعلب الأحمر، الفأر ريشي الذيل، إضافة إلى أنواع عديدة من الحشرات، فضلاً عن تسجيل ما يقارب الـ 18 نوع من الزواحف، و12 نوع من الطيور الممثلة لبيئة الصحراء الشرقية المقيمة والمهاجرة. وعلى بعد 18 كم من شرق ضاحية المعادي تقع محمية الغابة المتحجرة والتي تمثل كنزاً جيولوجياً وتراثاً إنسانياً، حيث تضم الغابة أشجاراً تحتفظ بسيقانها وفروعها بكامل التفاصيل متناثرة على مساحة 7 كم مربع تحولت إلى أشجار من حجارة. ووقع هذا التحول الطبيعي منذ العصر الاليجوسين أي منذ نحو 35 مليون سنة وتعد هذه الغابة الكثيفة من الأشجار المتحجرة نتاجاً طبيعياً للعصر الذي بدأت الأنهار تدخل فيه إلى مصر من الجنوب. كما توجد بالمحمية بعض تكوينات الأيوسين الأعلى وتحتوي على بعض الحفريات اللافقارية وعمرها يرجع إلى 60 مليون سنة. وفي حلوان ينبع أحد أشهر العيون المائية في مصر وهي «عين حلوان»، والتي كانت مقصداً لأهالي وسكان القاهرة بسبب كمية مائها المعدني الكبريتي المعالج للكثير من الأمراض الجلدية والذي يعد من أغنى العناصر الشفائية الطبية، بالإضافة إلى مناخ حلوان الجاف الذي يهيئ جواً مناسباً للاستشفاء من أمراض عديدة أهمها الأمراض الجلدية والروماتيزمية والمفصلية.\n\nالسياحة الثقافية\nتعد السياحة الثقافية في القاهرة أحد أهم عوامل الجذب السياحي إذ تمتلك المدينة مجموعة من الآثار المتنوعة صنعت من مناطق كاملة متاحف مفتوحة وساهمت في نشأة متاحف مصرية ذات مكانة عالمية، وكانت مصدر إلهام عشرات الكتب والروايات مثل ثلاثية نجيب محفوظ التي تعد أفضل رواية عربية، كما تبرز مدينة أون الفرعونية بمنطقة عين شمس بمعالمها الأثرية

والمعارض نمطاً سياحياً هاماً لمدينة القاهرة، وتحظى فعاليتها بإقبال جماهيري من الداخل والخارج، وذلك بقصد تحقيق عدة أهداف منها الترويج السياحي وتنويع مفردات الجذب السياحي، وتشجيع أنشطة التسوق، ورعاية الأحداث الفنية.\nوتأتي القاهرة على رأس المدن المصرية التي تستضيف المؤتمرات والمعارض الدولية لما يتوافر بها من مراكز دولية للمؤتمرات تتمتع بإمكانيات فنية وتكنولوجية وتجهيزات حديثة، وإمكانية فندقية عالية المستوى تعمل على راحة ضيوف المدينة، ومن أهم تلك التجمعات معرض القاهرة الدولي للكتاب، مهرجان القاهرة الدولي للأغنية الشعبية، مهرجان القاهرة السينمائي الدولي، مهرجان القاهرة الدولي للمسرح

أسوان. وتشرف عليها هيئة الكومنولث وهي منظمة تشرف على 23 ألف موقع منتشرة في 154 دولة لرفات ضحايا الحروب العالمية.\nتحظى المقابر باهتمام الآلاف من أحفاد ضحايا الحربين العالمية الأولى والثانية بالعالم ممن يهتمون بزيارتها تخليداً لذكرى أجدادهم. يأتي نصيب القاهرة في مقبرتين تقع الأولى بالقرب من شارع صلاح سالم وصممها السير روبرت لوريمر، والثانية في هليوبوليس وصممها هربرت ورثينجتون.\n\nمواقع التراث العالمي\nتعد القاهرة القديمة إحدى أقدم مدن العالم الإسلاميّة بما تضمه من جوامع ومدارس وحمامات وينابيع. تأسست المدينة في القرن العاشر وأصبحت مركزاً للعالم الإسلامي ووصلت لعصرها الذهبي في القرن الرابع عشر. وقررت لجنة اليونسكو إدراجها ضمن قائمة التراث العالمي في عام 1979. تضم القاهرة التاريخية أنواعاً من العمائر رفيعة الطراز مثل المدارس والوكالات والخنقاوات والأسبلة والحمامات والبيوت والقصور الأثرية مثل بيت السحيمي وقصر الأمير بشتاك، والأسواق مثل خان الخليلي والصاغة والنحاسين، والأحياء العتيقة مثل التربيعة والخيامية وتحت الربع، ويحيط بها أسوار وبوابات مثل باب النصر وباب الفتوح والتي كانت تغلق قديماً في المساء لحفظ الأمن والنظام.\nكما تحتضن المدينة عدداً ضخماً من المساجد القديمة منها جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي يعد أول بناء أقيم في الفسطاط، وجامع ابن طولون الذي يعتبر ثالث مسجد أنشئ في مصر بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص وجامع العسكر وبدأ بناءه عام 876 وأتم تشييده في عام 879، فيما يعد الجامع الأزهر أول عمل معماري فاطمي عاصر تأسيس القاهرة وظل باقياً حتى اليوم وأنشأه جوهر الصقلي قائد المعز لدين الله فبدأ العمل في بنائه عام 970 وانتهى من تأسيسه عام 972، وفي عهد الخليفة الظافر بأمر الله شيد مسجد الحسين عام 1154.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالتعليم\nكانت القاهرة منذ فترة طويلة محور التعليم والخدمات التعليمية ليس فقط لمصر ولكن أيضاً للعالم الإسلامي قاطباً. وبالقاهرة العدد الأكبر من المدارس والجامعات والمعاهد بين مدن مصر، ومرجع ذلك هو عدد سكانها الضخم. ولا يختلف التعليم في القاهرة عن التعليم في باقي أنحاء مصر، فهو تقريباً بنفس الجودة. يوجد بجانب المدارس الحكومية العديد من المدارس الخاصة التي تدرس مناهج مشابهة للمناهج في المدارس الحكومية ولكنها أقل في أعداد الطلاب وأكثر كفاءة من المدارس الحكومية الرسمية نظراً للدعم المالي المتوفر، وهناك مدارس اللغات التي تدرس نفس المناهج باللغات الإنجليزية أو الفرنسية أو الألمانية وهي تسير على النظام التعليمي المتبع في هذه الدول، وهناك المدارس الدينية وعلى رأسها المدارس الأزهرية التي تتميز بذاتيتها في المناهج والزيادة في بعض المواد الدينية. وتعتبر القاهرة هي مهد تأسيس جامعة القاهرة كأول جامعة على النظم الحديثة، حيث تم إنشاؤها تحت اسم (الجامعة المصرية) في قصر جناكليس (بشارع القصر العيني) عام 1907 قبل أن يتم نقل الجامعة إلى مقرها الحالي بالجيزة، وتضم المدينة حالياً عدة جامعات متنوعة ما بين عريقة وحديثة النشأة منها جامعة حلوان، جامعة عين شمس، جامعة الأزهر، الجامعة الأمريكية، الجامعة الألمانية، الجامعة الفرنسية، الجامعة البريطانية، الجامعة الروسية، أكاديمية الشرطة، فرع الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم.\n\nالصحة\nالقاهرة موقع لمئات المستشفيات العامة والخاصة، ومن أشهر مستشفياتها الحديثة: عين شمس التخصصي، السلام الدولي، النزهة الدولي، دار الشفاء، دار الحكمة، كليوباترا، مستشفى العباسية للصحة النفسية، مستشفى الأمراض الصدرية بالعباسية، مستشفى 57357 لعلاج سرطان الأطفال بالمجان، المعهد القومي للكلى والمسالك البولية، ويضم شارع القصر العيني التاريخي عدة صروح صحية هي المعهد القومي للأورام، المعهد القومي لأبحاث الأمراض المتوطنة والكبد، المعهد القومي للتغذية، مستشفى قصر العيني. واختيرت المدينة أيضاً كمقر لأكبر مستشفيات إدارة الخدمات الطبية للقوات المسلحة المصرية ومنها المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحة بكوبري القبة، المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحة بالمعادي، مستشفى غمرة العسكري، مستشفى ألماظة العسكري، مستشفى الحلمية العسكري للعظام والتكميل، مستشفى العاملين المدنيين بالقوات المسلحة، مستشفى الجلاء لعائلات ضباط القوات المسلحة.\n\nالرياضة\nيوجد بالقاهرة العدد الأكبر من الأندية الرياضية الموجودة في مصر وأكثرها شعبية، بالإضافة لأكبر عدد من الملاعب والصالات الرياضية لمختلف الألعاب. وقامت القاهرة بتنظيم العديد من البطولات والدورات الرياضية الأفريقية والشرق أوسطية والإسلامية والبحر متوسطية والعالمية ومن أبرزها كأس الأمم الأفريقية لكرة القدم 1986، دورة الألعاب الأفريقية 1991، بطولة العالم لكرة اليد للرجال 1999، بطولة العالم للأسكواش للرجال 2006، كأس الأمم الأفريقية لكرة القدم 2006، بطولة العالم لكرة اليد للرجال للأندية 2007، كأس العالم تحت 20 سنة لكرة القدم 2009، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للرجال 2010، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للسيدات 2010، بطولة أفريقيا لكرة اليد للرجال 2016، بطولة العالم لكرة السلة للشباب تحت 19 سنة 2017، كما ستستضيف كأس العالم لكرة اليد في عام 2021. من أشهر أندية القاهرة النادي الأهلي، نادي الزمالك، نادي الجزيرة، نادي الزهور، نادي هليوبوليس، نادي الشمس، نادي السكة الحديد، نادي المقاولون العرب، نادي النصر، وادي دجلة. ومن أهم الصروح الرياضية في القاهرة ستاد القاهرة الدولي الذي تأسس في عام 1955 واكتمل بناؤه عام 1960 وافتتحه الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر في احتفالات ثورة يوليو في نفس العام، وسمي باستاد ناصر، إلى أن غير الاسم الرئيس محمد حسني مبارك ويعد من أكبر الصروح الرياضية في الشرق الأوسط وأفريقيا وبه مجمع لألعاب الصالات الصالات، وفي عام 2015 احتل المركز الـ 26 في قائمة أفضل ملاعب العالم بناءً على عدة معايير أبرزها السعة الجماهيرية وتاريخ الإنشاء والهندسة المعمارية، وذلك بجانب ملاعب كرة القدم الشهيرة مثل ملعب الكلية الحربية، ملعب 30 يونيو «ستاد الدفاع الجوي».\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيصل محاور وأحياء ومناطق القاهرة ويربطها بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر شبكة طرق ومواصلات ضخمة، يدار أغلبها باستخدام إشارات المرور الإلكترونية وتراقب بكاميرات المراقبة، وتخدم يومياً ملايين المواطنين. تضم تلك الشبكة عدة كباري وجسور بالإضافة إلى خطوط السكك الحديدية وقطارات الأنفاق جنباً إلى جنب الحافلات العامة وسيارات الأجرة. ويربط المدينة بباقي مدن العالم ميناء القاهرة الجوي الذي يعد المطار الأهم والأكبر في مصر.\n\nميناء القاهرة الجوي\nميناء القاهرة الجوي أو مطار القاهرة الدولي هو مطار دولي يقع على مسافة 22 كم شمال شرق مدينة القاهرة، وتبلغ مساحته حوالي 40 مليون متر مربع. يعود تاريخ إنشاء المطار إلى عام 1942 وافتتح بشكله الحديث في عام 1963، ويعتبر البوابة الجوية الرئيسية لمصر، فيما يعد ثاني أكبر مطار في قارة أفريقيا من حيث الحركة الجوية بعد مطار كيب تاون بجنوب أفريقيا. يمثل المطار حوالي 40% من الحركة الجوية بمصر ويرتبط بـ 91 مطار في مختلف أنحاء العالم من خلال خطوط الطيران المختلفة. تبلغ الطاقة الاستيعابية للمطار حالياً 22 مليون راكب سنوياً، ويستخدمه أكثر من 60 شركة طيران من مختلف دول العالم، وعشرة شركات للشحن الجوي، بالإضافة لرحلات الطيران العارض ويقوم على إدارته وتشغيله شركة ميناء القاهرة الجوي. اختير المطار كأفضل مطارات أفريقيا لعام 2006 من قبل اتحاد شركات الطيران الأفريقية وذلك من خلال استقصاء أجراه الاتحاد عن تطوير المطارات الأفريقية من حيث الأداء والبنية التحتية والتحديث المستمر. ازدادت أهمية المطار خاصة بعد انضمام شركة مصر للطيران إلى تحالف ستار وتحول مطار القاهرة إلى مطار محوري يربط بين أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط وأوروبا، وذلك لتجميع ركاب الترانزيت والانطلاق بهم إلى جميع مطارات العالم. يضم المطار ثلاثة مباني للركاب مبنى رقم (1) سعته 6 ملايين راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (2) سعته 3.5 مليون راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (3) سعته 11 مليون راكب/سنوياً، بالإضافة إلى مبنى الرحلات الموسمية وسعته مليوني راكب/سنوياً، كما يضم أربعة مدارج لإقلاع وهبوط الطائرات.\n\nالنقل النهري\nبدأ استخدام الأوتوبيس النهري عام 1961 كوسيلة مواصلات ولأغراض الرحلات النيلية القصيرة، وفي 1 مارس 2016 تم افتتاح مشروع التاكسي النهري من القاهرة إلى المعادي، على أن يبدأ خط سير التاكسي النهري من مرسى نادي اليخت بكورنيش المعادي مروراً بثلاث محطات هي منيل الروضة، جاردن سيتي، وصولاً إلى التحرير كمرحلة أولى، بحيث يتم مد المشروع ليغطي باقي مناطق القاهرة الكبرى. يعمل التاكسي النهري حالياً بشكل تجريبي لأغراض نقل الركاب والسياحة والرحلات وذلك للحين الانتهاء من إجراءات ترخيص المراسي من محافظتي القاهرة والجيزة. وترتبط القاهرة بباقي محافظات مصر بعدة خطوط ملاحية نهرية تتمثل في خط القاهرة/أسوان، خط القاهرة/الإسكندرية، خط القاهرة/دمياط. تتمثل أهمية النقل النهري من منطلق أنه أكثر وسائل الانتقال أماناً لقلة الحوادث مقارنة بوسائل النقل الأخرى نظراً لانسيابية الحركة، ولعدم وجود تقاطعات مرورية كما أنه صديق للبيئة وكذلك يتمتع بمعدل استهلاك وقود منخفض والقدرة على نقل الشحنات ذات الأحجام الكبيرة والتي لا يمثل عنصر الوقت والسرعة أهمية كبيرة في نقلها.\n\nالسكك الحديدية\nتعتبر محطة سكك حديد القاهرة «محطة مصر أو محطة رمسيس أو محطة باب الحديد» من أقدم محطات السكك الحديدية الموجودة في العالم حيث تعد سكك حديد مصر هي أول خطوط سكك حديد يتم إنشاؤها في أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط والثانية على مستوى العالم بعد المملكة المتحدة حيث بدأ إنشاؤها في خمسينيات القرن التاسع عشر، وبدأ تشغيلها في عهد الخديوي إسماعيل، ويقوم على تشغيل المحطة الهيئة القومية لسكك حديد مصر التي تعرف اختصاراً باسم (س.ح.م) وهي شركة تمتلكها الحكومة المصرية بالكامل. خضعت المحطة إلى عملية تطوير شاملة على مرحلتين تضمنت ترميم واجهة المحطة الرئيسية التاريخية، وتجديد صالة كبار الزوار ومكتب شرطة السياحة ومكتب ناظر المحطة، بالإضافة للأرصفة الرئيسية الأربعة والساحة الخارجية للمحطة، وتم فتح عدد من المحلات التجارية ومكاتب لبعض البنوك ومول تجاري يضم أنشطة تجارية وخدمية وترفيهية ومقاهي بهدف زيادة عائدات المحطة السنوية، بالإضافة إلى إعادة تصميم البهو الرئيسي وتطوير صالة التذاكر لتصبح صالة إلكترونية، وزيادة القدرة الكهربائية للمحطة، وتم تزويد المحطة بماكينات لصرف تذاكر القطارات من خلال بطاقات الدفع مقدماً، مع إمكانية الحجز عن طريق الكمبيوتر وبطاقات الصرف الآلي، مما أدي إلى تقليل الزحام على شباك التذاكر. وتم إضافة نصب تذكاري في البهو الرئيسي للمحطة على هيئة هرم نصفه الأعلى مفرغ لرؤية هرم داخلي وآخر بلوري يضم قائمة بأسماء شهداء ثورة 25 يناير، وزودت المحطة ببوابات أمنية إلكترونية وشبكة مراقبة بالكاميرات. وصلت تكلفة تطوير المحطة إلى 160 مليون جنيه، وقام بإعداد المخطط العام والتصميمات والرسومات الهندسية للمشروع المركز الهندسي للخدمة العامة بكلية الهندسة بجامعة الإسكندرية.\n\nالترام\nيعود تاريخ ترام القاهرة أو ترام مصر الجديدة إلى ثمانينات القرن الماضي، حينما قرر البارون إمبان المهندس البلجيكي إنشاء مصر الجديدة، وكانت فكرته حينها بتدشين ترام يجوب الشوارع الفارغة ليجذب إليها المواطنين، وتولت شركة مصر الجديدة للإنشاء والتعمير مسئولية تعمير المدينة الجديدة وتوفير البنية التحتية من كهرباء ومياه وكذلك إدارة الترام. كان الترام يمر بـ 16 محطة وشهد انكماشاً في عدد المحطات حتى وصلت حالياً إلى 8 محطات فقط متمثلة في 3 خطوط. يعد الترام وسيلة مواصلات سهلة واقتصادية، ما يجعله الخيار الأنسب لمحدودي الدخل. وبين الحين والآخر تنتشر أخبار عن إلغاؤه بهدف توسيع الطرق التي يمر بها لتقليل معدل التكدسات المرورية، فيما تنفي المصادر الحكومية تلك الأخبار وتصرح بنيتها لتطويره وتحديث العربات لتقديم خدمة أفضل للمواطنين.\n\nقطارات الأنفاق\nتحتل القاهرة المركز السابع عالمياً بين أكثر مدن العالم ازدحاماً مما دعا الحكومة المصرية لاتخاذ إجراءات موازية لتحسين شبكة المواصلات لكي تتماشى مع الزيادة السكانية بالمدينة وتستطيع أن تغطي متطلباتها، فبدأ التفكير في مشروع مترو الأنفاق كأحد حلول الأزمة المرورية بالعاصمة المصرية. بدء تنفيذ المرحلة الأولى من الخط الأول عام 1982، وانتهت في 1 أكتوبر 1987 والمرحلة الثانية في 12 أبريل 1989 ليربط المنطقة الصناعية وجامعة حلوان بالمنطقة التجارية بوسط القاهرة ومنطقة شمال شرق القاهرة، حيث وصل حتى المرج بطول 42.7 كم، ويرتبط الخط تبادلياً بخطوط السكك الحديدية الرئيسية للوجه القبلي والبحري عند محطة الشهداء (مبارك سابقاً) وبخط السويس / إسماعيلية عند محطة عين شمس وبخط المرج / شبين القناطر / قليوب عند محطة المرج، ويبلغ عدد محطات الخط 34 محطة منهم 5 محطات نفقية، وبقية المحطات سطحية. وبسبب الزيادة للسكانية ومشاكل النقل العام بدأت الحكومة المصرية التفكير في دعم مترو الأنفاق بإنشاء خط ثاني يربط القاهرة بمحافظتي الجيزة والقليوبية ويربط محطة سكك حديد شبرا الخيمة مع محطة سكك حديد الجيزة. فأنشئ الخط الثاني من محطة شبرا الخيمة إلى الجيزة مروراً بمحطة الشهداء «رمسيس» ومحطة السادات «التحرير» التبادلية أيضاً. وتلبية لمطالب النقل الكثيفة تم تنفيذ المرحلة الأولى والثانية والثالثة من الخط الثالث لمترو الأنفاق ليربط شرق القاهرة بغربها، مع تبادل الخدمة مع القطار الكهربائي الخفيف LRT في محطة عدلي منصور المركزية، ومع الخط الأول في محطة جمال عبد الناصر ومع الخط الثاني في محطة العتبة، وذلك بهدف خفض المرور السطحي لوسائل النقل الأخرى بما يعادل مليوني رحلة/يومياً، ووفر زمن الرحلات خلال العام بقدر 564 مليون ساعة لجميع وسائل النقل.\n\nسيارات الأجرة\nاشتهرت سيارات الأجرة بالقاهرة باللونين الأبيض والأسود. ثم أنشئ جهاز تاكسي العاصمة لإدخال سيارات حديثة إلى شوارع القاهرة تعمل إلى جانب التاكسي القديم وتستخدم تعريفة ركوب محددة، وتميزت تلك السيارات باللون الأصفر. وذلك حتى بدأت محافظة القاهرة مشروع إحلال وتبديل سيارات التاكسي القديم بأخري حديثة تتميز باللون «الأبيض» عن طريق جهاز تاكسي العاصمة، وبالتعاون بين محافظة القاهرة ووزارتي البيئة والمالية وعدد من الجهات التنفيذية. ويعتبر تاكسي لندن «الأسود» الذي ظهر في القاهرة عام 2010 من أفضل سيارات الأجرة بالمدينة، رغم ارتفاع أسعاره نسبياً، إلا أنه موجه في الأساس لخدمة السائحين ورجال الأعمال. وبسبب تطور الخدمات التقنية وانحدار خدمة التاكسي «الأبيض»، ظهرت في أواخر عام 2015 شركات تستخدم السيارات الخاصة في الأغراض التجارية لنقل الأفراد بأجر، وذلك باستخدام تطبيقات الأجهزة الذكية.\n\nحافلات النقل العام\nيقوم على تشغيل حافلات نقل الأفراد بالقاهرة هيئة النقل العام التابعة لمحافظة القاهرة والتي قامت منذ عام 2010 بالبدء في تحديث أسطولها من الحافلات وقامت بطرح أوتوبيسات جديدة اختير لها اللون الأحمر، وسحب الأوتوبيسات القديمة ذات اللون الأخضر والأخرى ذات اللون الأبيض. كما قامت بإدخال أوتوبيسات أخرى جديدة للخدمة في عام 2016، اختير لها اللون الأزرق. وفي عام 2015 تسلمت القاهرة 600 حافلة نقل عام مقدمة كمنحة من دولة الإمارات لتطوير أسطول هيئة النقل العام بالقاهرة بقيمة إجمالية 550 مليون جنيه، والتي روعي في تصنيعها التمتع بمواصفات الخدمة الشاقة وأن يتم تصنيعها بنسبة 50% في مصر والنصف الآخر في مصنع للحافلات بأبوظبي بالإمارات.\n\nالطرق البرية\nيربط مناطق القاهرة عدة محاور مرورية أشهرها الطريق الدائري وهو طريق محيطي أنشئ بهدف ربط محافظات القاهرة الكبرى، وتخفيف زحام السيارات داخل القاهرة وضواحيها حيث تصل الحركة المرورية عليه إلى أكثر من 100 ألف سيارة/يوم. بدأت وزارة الإسكان في إنشاء الطريق عام 1986 وتم الانتهاء منه بالكامل عام 2005 بطول إجمالي 100 كم. وكوبري أكتوبر الذي يتراوح عرضه بين 14 إلى 34 متر ويشمل 23 مطلع ومنزل بعرض 7 إلى 8 متر، يبدأ الكوبري من الدقي ويعبر نهر النيل ويمر بمنطقة غمرة حتى يصل إلى طريق النصر. وشارع صلاح سالم الذي يعد من أكبر وأطول شوارع القاهرة، حيث تصب فيه روافد من جميع أنحاء المدينة مما يجعله محوراً رئيسياً. وطريق النصر وشارع جسر السويس. ومن أشهر ميادين القاهرة الخديوية ميدان التحرير، ميدان رمسيس، ميدان العتبة، ميدان التوفيقية، ميدان طلعت حرب، ميدان عابدين، ميدان الفلكي، ميدان لاظوغلي، ميدان باب اللوق، ميدان مصطفي كامل، ميدان محمد فريد، ميدان الأوبرا. ومن ميادين القاهرة القديمة ميدان السيدة زينب، ميدان السيدة عائشة، ميدان السيدة نفيسة. ومن ميادين منطقة مصر الجديدة والقبة ميدان العباسية، ميدان حدائق القبة، ميدان روكسي، ميدان تريومف، ميدان المحكمة، ميدان الجامع، ميدان الكوربة، ميدان هليوبوليس. ومن ميادين مدينة نصر ميدان الساعة، ميدان رابعة العدوية.\n\nالمسافة بين القاهرة والمدن المصرية\nفيما يلي جدول المسافة بالكيلومتر بين مدينة القاهرة وبعض المدن المصرية:\n\nمشاكل المدينة\nالعشوائيات\nتعد مشكلة العشوائيات من مشكلات المدينة المعاصرة التي نمت أوضاعها مع الزيادة السكانية التي شهدتها المدينة منذ الستينات، وما صاحب ذلك من تغيرات اجتماعية واقتصادية أدت إلى استمرار تزايد معدلات الهجرة من الريف إلى القاهرة مما أسفر عن معدلات طلب متزايدة بسوق العقارات يقابلها نقص في عدد الوحدات السكنية المطروحة، فظهرت على السطح مشكلة المناطق العشوائية التي تنوعت ما بين مساكن الإيواء المؤقت، ومساكن وضع اليد المشيدة على أراضي مغتصبة، والمساكن المشيدة بتقاسيم غير معتمدة أو بدون تراخيص قانونية. ونتيجة لتفشي تلك الظاهرة بالقاهرة وعدة مدن مصرية أخرى، بدأت الحكومة المصرية في التعامل معها عن طريق عدة محاور منها التطوير من خلال موازنة الدولة، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع جهات دولية، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الجمعيات الأهلية ورجال الأعمال والمجتمع المدني، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الوزارات ذات الصلة بأماكن التطوير.\n\nالتلوث\nتتعدى نسبة تلوث هواء القاهرة بالأتربة المؤشرات الدولية بـ 7 مرات، وصنفها المؤتمر السنوي الـ 11 للجمعية المصرية للشعب الهوائية والصدر والحساسية القاهرة كثالث أكثر مدن العالم في معدل تلوث الهواء بعد مدينتي «نيومكسيكو» المكسيكية، والعاصمة الصينية «بكين». ويعود ارتفاع نسبة التلوث بالقاهرة إلى عدة أسباب منها الدخان الناتج عن حرق قش الأرز في بعض محافظات الدلتا وشمال الصعيد القريبة من القاهرة، مما يشكل ما يعرف منذ سنوات بظاهرة «السحابة السوداء»، كما تضخ المصانع بالقاهرة والمحافظات القريبة منها (الجيزة والقليوبية) والتي تصل إلى حوالي 12600 منشأة صناعية كميات كبيرة من الملوثات والأدخنة، فيما تضخ حرائق القمامة في الأماكن المكشوفة داخل القاهرة وفي المحافظات القريبة منها بالإضافة إلى عوادم وسائل النقل والمواصلات أطنان من الأدخنة الملوثة. وتقدر الخسائر المادية المترتبة على تلوث الهواء والجو في القاهرة بحوالي 10 مليارات جنيه سنوياً.\n\nالزحام\nأصبحت مشكلة التكدس المروري والزحام بالقاهرة أحد أزمات المدينة اليومية، وخصوصاً خلال ساعات الذروة. وكشفت دراسة حديثة عن أزمة المرور بالقاهرة صادرة عن البنك الدولي بالاشتراك مع المعهد القومي للنقل التابع لوزارة النقل أن الزحام المروري في القاهرة يتسبب في خسائر سنوية للدولة تقدر بحوالي 50 مليار جنيه، بما يعادل %4 من إجمالي الناتج المحلي السنوي للدولة، تشمل تكاليف الوقود والآثار الصحية الناتجة من سوء نوعية الهواء والحوادث، بجانب التأخير في الانتقال والوصول. وأضافت الدراسة أن متوسط السرعة على الطرق الرئيسية في القاهرة تتراوح بين 15 و40 كم في الساعة. وتعود تلك المشكلة إلى عدة عوامل أهمها الزيادة السكانية غير المخطط لها، وبالتالي لم تتمكن الشوارع العامة من استيعاب تلك الأعداد وتحقيق سيولة مرورية مقبولة، إهمال صيانة الطرق الرئيسية وتوسيعها ودعمها بأنظمة مرورية حديثة وتخطيط أماكن للانتظار، عدم وجود حارات خاصة لحافلات النقل العام ومقطورات النقل الثقيل، عدم تطبيق قواعد المرور بحزم، ضعف سلوكيات القيادة، انتشار الباعة الجائلين بالميادين والشوارع، ظاهرة المواقف العشوائية، قلة ساحات انتظار السيارات سواء السطحية أو متعددة الطوابق.\n\nأعلام المدينة\nمحمد رفعت، رائد قراء القرآن الكريم في مصر، من مواليد 9 مايو 1882 بحي المغربلين.\nطلعت حرب، رائد الاقتصاد

      "content": "## Overview\nCairo (pronounced KY-roh; Arabic: القاهرة al-Qāhirah) is the capital of Egypt (until the New Administrative Capital is completed) and, with a total population of Greater Cairo metropolitan area in excess of 16 million people, one of the largest cities in both Africa and the Middle East (the regions which it conveniently straddles). It is also the 19th largest city in the world, and among the world's most densely populated cities.\nOn the Nile river, Cairo is famous for its own history, preserved in the fabulous medieval Islamic city and Coptic sites in Old Cairo — with historic Cairo inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The Egyptian Museum in the city centre is a must see, with its countless Ancient Egyptian artefacts, as is shopping at the Khan al-Khalili bazaar. No trip to Cairo would be complete without a visit to the Giza Pyramids and to the nearby Saqqara Pyramid Complex, where visitors will see Egypt's first step pyramid built by the architect Imhotep for the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser.\nThough firmly attached to the past, Cairo is also home to a vibrant modern society. The Midan Tahrir area situated in downtown Cairo, built in the 19th century under the rule of Khedive Ismail, has strived to be a \"Paris on the Nile\". There also are a number of more modern suburbs including Ma'adi and Heliopolis, while Zamalek is a quiet area on Gezira Island, with upmarket shopping. Cairo is best in the autumn or spring, when the weather isn't so hot. A felucca ride on the Nile is a good way to escape from the busy city, as is a visit to Al-Azhar Park.\n\n## Districts\nGreater Cairo is vast; with more than 20 million people (2018), it's the largest metropolitan area in Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## Understand\nCairo is on the Nile, and has ancient origins in the vicinity of the Pharaonic city of Memphis. The city started to take its present form in 641 CE, when the Arab general Amr Ibn Al-Ase conquered Egypt for Islam and founded a new capital called Misr Al-Fustat, \"the City of the Tents\". The legend is that Al-Ase, on the day he was leaving to conquer Alexandria, found two doves nesting in his tent. Not wanting to disturb them, he left the tent. Upon returning victorious, he called his soldiers to pitch their tents around his, and this became the site of the new city in what is now Old Cairo. The name may have been a pun – Misr/Masr is the Arabic word for city, but it is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt. The Tunisian Fatimid dynasty captured the city in 969 CE and founded a new city, Al-Qahira (\"The Victorious\") just north of Al-Fustat. Al-Qahira gave the city its English name, Cairo, but the locals still call it MàSr (مصر), which is also the Arabic name of the entire country of Egypt (similar to Mexico City in Mexico).\n\n## Climate\nThe best time to visit Cairo is during the winter from November to March, when daytime highs mostly stay below 26°C (79°F), with night time lows around 10°C (50°F) with occasional rain showers clearing the air, but still, you do not need an umbrella, even the rainiest months of the year rarely top 10 mm (0.4 in).\nIf visiting during winter, be aware that not all buildings are equipped with heaters, including some hotels and hostels. Visitors should always pack a few warm jumpers (sweaters) and a warm jacket for evening wear. In Cairo, in indoor buildings without air-conditioning, temperatures are about 15°C (59°F) in the coldest winter days and about 34°C (93°F) in the hottest summer days.\nThe brief spring from March to May can be pleasant as long as there are no sand storms, but summer temperatures, on the other hand, can reach a searing 38°C (100°F). In September and October, the period of late summer and early autumn, farmers burn rice husks to ash after sunset near Greater Cairo and this makes the air smokey.\n\n## Orientation\nToday's Greater Cairo is a city with at least 20 million inhabitants (2018), where skyscrapers and fast food restaurants nestle up to world heritage monuments. Cairo used to be the designated name of the city on the eastern bank of the Nile, and this is where you'll find both the modern Downtown, built under influence of French architecture, today the centre of commerce and popular life, as well as historic Islamic and Coptic sights.\nOutside the core on the eastern bank, you'll find the modern, more affluent suburbs of Heliopolis and Nasr City near the airport, and Ma'adi to the south. In the middle of the Nile is the island of Gezira and Zamalek, where many embassies exist. On the western bank is lots of modern concrete and business, but also the great Giza pyramids and, further to the south, Memphis and Saqqara. The city might seem like a lot to handle, but give it a try, and you will find that it has a lot to offer for any traveller.\n\n## By car\nDriving in Cairo is not recommended or necessary. The traffic is, at the least, overwhelming for the common traveler. The driving has a consistency, but not in any official way. Road signs, lanes, right-of-ways, etc. are not adhered to, and there are a large number of junctions and flyovers. Traffic signals exist in only a few locations and are routinely ignored. However, sometimes police officers are directing traffic at busy intersections. In downtown Cairo, drivers will sometimes bump other cars that are blocking their way. Also, do not be upset if your side-view mirror gets hit. At night, many drivers do not use headlights, so use extra caution or avoid driving at night. In Egypt, vehicles travel on the right side of the road. Instead of making a left turn, you will often need to make a U-turn and backtrack, or you can make three right turns.\nParking houses or official parking spots are rare. Cars may be parked two or three deep on the side of the road, and will often be left unlocked, and out-of-gear, so they can be moved. In many places, people work to look after parked cars. A small tip is expected for this service. You can also use valet parking.\nTo get to Alexandria, the North Coast, the Delta and the Western Desert drivers should take the Cairo - Alexandria Desert Road from the Mewhwar Road- 26 July corridor from Downtown Cairo.\nTo get to Beni Sueif, Fayoum, Assyut, Luxor, and Aswan, drivers from Downtown should take the Sixth Of October-Fayoum exit at the Remaya Roundabout beside the Giza Pyramids at Le Meridien Hotel, to the Fayoum turn off at the Fayoum - Sixth Of October junction, 6 km (3.7 mi) from Remaya Roundabout.\nTo get to Suez, Port Said, and Ismailia, drivers from Downtown should take the Ring Road to the Suez Road junction for Suez, and the Ismailia junction off the Ring Road for Ismailia and Port Said.\nTo get to Hurghada, and Ain Sukhna, drivers from Downtown, should take the Ring Road to the New Ain Sukhna Toll Road at Kattamaya.\nTo get to Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba, Ras Sidr, Al-Arish, and Rafah on the Sinai Peninsula, drivers from Downtown, should take the Ring Road to the Suez Road junction at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, through the Ahmed Hamdy Tunnel, on to the Sinai Peninsula.\n\n## By plane\n30.1191431.400731 Cairo International Airport (CAI  IATA) (in Heliopolis, to the northeast of the city around 15 km from Cairo's city centre). The busiest airport in Africa with more than 16 million passengers per year, it is also the largest in Egypt and is the main hub for the flag carrier EgyptAir and Nile Air as well as several other airlines and the primary entry point to the country.      (updated Jan 2018)\nCairo airport has frequent flights from other Egyptian cities, the Gulf states and Levant, and usually daily flights from the European and North African capitals. There are direct flights from Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Mumbai, New York, Washington D.C, Tokyo and Toronto but travel from the Far East or North America will usually involve a change.\nThe main operator is EgyptAir (the national carrier) and its Star Alliance partners Aegean, Air China, Asiana Airlines,   Austrian Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, ITA Airways[dead link], LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss, Turkish Airlines.\nSkyTeam is represented by Air France, China Eastern Airlines,  KLM, Middle East Airlines, Saudia, and TAROM. Oneworld by British Airways, Iberia, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, and Royal Jordanian. \nOther Carriers include Aeroflot, Afriqiyah Airways,\nAir Algérie,\nAir Montenegro,\nAlexandria Airlines, AlMasria Universal Airlines, Emirates, Etihad, \nFly Baghdad,\nGulf Air, \nHainan Airlines, Iraqi Airways, Jordan Aviation[dead link], Kuwait Airways, Libyan Airlines, Neos, Nesma Airlines, Nile Air, Nordwind Airlines[dead link],   Oman Air, Petroleum Air, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, Rossiya Airlines, Saudia, SCAT Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, Smartwings, Sudan Airways, SunExpress, Syrian Air[dead link], Tunisair, and Yemenia. There are also budget carriers Air Arabia, Air Cairo, AJet, \nEurowings, \nflyadeal,   flynas, Jazeera Airways, Transavia[dead link], and Vueling.\nThe airport has three terminals. EgyptAir and all Star Alliance members (Lufthansa Group, Singapore Airlines, LOT, etc.) operate all flights to Terminal 3, which is integrated with Terminal 2 (British Airways, Air France, and some others) through an air bridge. Most other airlines arrive at Terminal 1, like Saudia (Terminal 1 Hall 2), and Sky Team, Oneworld, Emirates, and Etihad (Terminal 1 Hall 1). All terminals offer a reasonable variety of duty-free shops and restaurants. In Terminal 1 there are some duty-free shops opposite the gates, with more shops on the first floor. The lounges, a pub, McDonald's and coffee shops such as Starbucks are on the second floor. Terminal 3 has a central market place and food court, plus some shops and cafes along the concourses. There's not much open seating, as most seating is in the gate lounges which only open an hour before departure. This is okay when flights leave on time, but when there are delays the concourse becomes congested while lots of empty seats lie inaccessible beyond the lounge plate-glass.\nA free shuttle bus runs between the terminals and to the bus station every 15-30 minutes, 24 hours a day. At Terminal 3 its stop is at the arrival level on the second island at the end of the bus lane (turn right after the exit and cross the first lane). At Terminal 1 you must leave through the main exit and turn left to get to the station. The Shuttle Bus stops are at Hall 3 in front of the AirMall and at Hall 1 at the curbside. The bus stops are not marked. Sometimes you have to change buses at the bus station due to the driver's coffee break. Taxi drivers will try to lure you at the airport by misinforming you about the free shuttle bus, but if you go outside the terminal, you will find it.\nVisitors are allowed to buy duty-free articles on arrival, up to 4 extra litres of alcohol. At the checkout, a customs official will check your passport and give approval for the purchase. You can be accompanied by the person picking you up. It's fine if you expect to consume what you buy, or treat friends, but there's sometimes a racket where the local person gets you to buy up to your limit on his behalf— he'll pay you fairly for the extra.\nYou should exchange some money in the airport — it is best to do this before going through customs. Get some change in the process (smaller than the usual LE200 notes), as taxi drivers and others will always claim to be unable to give change. ATMs for all major cards are available in the arrival halls. Visas are available before immigration, for US$25. When arriving at terminal 3, everybody immediately starts queuing to buy visas from one of the bank counters on the left side. It seems these banks often don't accept cards or even Egyptian pounds (LE), which is problematic if you arrive with limited hard currency. There's an ATM on the other side of the area in this case, as well as an exchange office that also sells visas, and accepts Egyptian pounds as currency. So just go there to buy the visa, ignoring the bank counters, and avoiding the queues.\nPublic buses to Midan Tahrir (read the warnings about the district) or Midan Ramses runs from the airport bus station, which is connected to the terminals by the free Shuttle Bus (see above). The 356 (٣٥٦) bus is running to both in 2025. The services definitely running in 2018 are the 111 (١١١, direction Shobra, passes by Midan Ramses), and the LE8. These run every 30 minutes and take 60–120 min depending on traffic. Buses 27 (٢٧) and 400 (٤٠٠) may also run.\nOnce you arrive at the airport bus terminal, look for a bus by explaining where you want to go; for the downtown terminal you can say \"Abdel Moneim Riad\", pronounced \"Adbel Moneem Riad\", and someone should direct you on to a bus.\nBuses from downtown to the airport run from the bus terminal Abel Moneim Riad just north of the Egyptian Museum (under the highway bridge). If the stop's not obvious, ask for the airport or in Arabic the word is \"matar\" (مطار).\nScheduled buses no longer run directly from the airport to Alexandria or other delta cities. Either negotiate a taxi transfer or go downtown for onward transport.\nWhite meter taxis are available at the terminals. Insist on using the meter. Do not accept a fixed price as this tends to be double the fare by meter. Report taxi drivers who refuse to use the meter to Airport Security or Tourist Police. Refuse to pay the \"ticket\" (airport parking fee) for the driver. If you are going to downtown Cairo, you may be able to share a taxi with other tourists or backpackers. Have small notes available, mostly the taxi driver will claim not to have any change, but they actually do have. Another option is to use transportation arranged by your hotel or hostel, though this service is often not complimentary.\nMost Egyptians who can afford it use Uber taxis, as they have fixed rates. From the beginning of Al-Haram (Giza area around the pyramids) to the airport costs LE200-300, depending on the time and type of car (Jan 2023). Careem is also readily available, prices might be a bit cheaper than Uber, to downtown Cairo, cost was around LE150 (November 2023). inDrive is also available.\nThere are numerous limousine services. Pick-up points are in front of the terminals (curbside). The prices are fixed depending on the destination and the car category. Category A is luxury limousines (Mercedes-Benz E-Class), Category B are Micro Buses for up to 7 passengers and Category C are mid-sized cars (e.g. Mitsubishi Lancer). London Taxis are available from Sixt as a new Category D.\nThere is a planned metro Line 3 extension to the airport, but construction has not started as of Jan 2023.\nWhen returning to the airport from downtown, allow at least two hours to get here, and 3 hours from Giza, as the roads can be very congested. The new airport road connects the airport with the intersection of the Ring Road and Suez Road and has no traffic jams. If you depart on Friday morning or mid-day, the trip to the airport will be quick, as roads are deserted while people go to the mosque for Friday prayers.\nUpon arriving, you must pass through a security checkpoint before you can access the ticketing & check-in area. You'll need a printout of your itinerary or ticket to show the security staff here. After checking-in you will pass through a second checkpoint (including passport control) to get airside, then there's a third just before boarding your aircraft - only then can you restock on water. Allow plenty of time for all this, as lines can be long. There is no left-luggage room at the airport.\nThe airport is on the north-eastern outskirts of the city at Heliopolis. If you want to spend the night at the airport, there are three hotels available:\nNovotel Cairo Airport, H0502@accor.com. (updated Mar 2017)\nLe Passage (formerly Iberotel), cairo@jaz.travel.\nLe Meridien Cairo Airport, Reservations.03265@lemeridien.com.\nThere are other lodging options in nearby Heliopolis.\nBorg el Arab (HBE IATA) near Alexandria has far fewer flights and poor ground connections.\n30.10972230.8944442 Sphinx International Airport (SPX IATA). As of 2025 it is served mainly by budget airlines, including Air Arabia, Air Cairo, Condor, EasyJet, Edelweiss Air, Flydubai, Flynas, Jazeera Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Pegasus Airlines, SalamAir and Wizz Air.   (updated Jun 2024)\n30.07583331.8333333 Capital International Airport (CCE IATA). The airport in the New Administrative Capital sees very limited flights. As of 2025 it has only seasonal charter services operated by Smartwings.    (updated Jun 2025)\n\n## By train\nCairo is the hub for railways in Egypt, almost all trains start and terminate here. The governmental Egyptian National Railways[dead link] (السكك الحديدية المصرية‎), often abbreviated as ENR, operates all trains. One exception is the private company Watania that operates high-end trains between Cairo, Luxor and a few other cities.\nThere are up to 30 departures per day from Alexandria, with the fastest trains called Specials running non-stop at 2 hr 40 min. Express trains are slightly slower at around 3 hours. These trains are clean and comfortable, air-conditioned, and with snacks available. Some will variously refer to these fast trains as \"Spanish\", \"French\" or \"Turbo\" because of their rolling stock.\nTravelling along the Nile to and from Aswan and Luxor is very popular. At least one daytime and one overnight train per day offers superior quality and is generally recommended for tourists. Journey time is 10 hours from Luxor and another four from Aswan. Ordinary trains ply the same route, some commence in Alexandria, but they are much less comfortable with hard seats and squalid toilets. Lights stay on all night and you'll probably be woken several times for ticket checks.\nNumerous 3rd and 2nd class trains operates to and from most cities in Lower Egypt and along the Mediterranean coast to and from El Alamein.\nThe most common way of getting tickets is to buy them in advance at stations. However, buying tickets in advance via a booking agent or from Abela Trains assures your seat and avoids hassle at stations. Since 2022, foreigners pay a hefty premium to ride Egyptian trains, and prices are typically 10x higher than the local price. If you are on a budget, consider a bus.\nAlmost all mainline trains from Cairo run from the main railway station, Ramses. However, in a few years time - around 2023 - a new major station, Bashteel, will be completed. As of 2022, it is not known how it will affect the other stations.\n30.06361131.2472224 Cairo Ramses railway station (محطة رمسيس) (Shohadaa (Martyrs) metro station), ☏ +20 2 2575-3555. The main railway station, also known as Misr Station (محطة مصر). Restaurants and shops are available, however there's no left luggage facility. Allow time to get through the multiple security queues. Notice that the ticket office has multiple windows for different classes and destinations, so check that you are in the correct line. Departure and arrival boards in the main concourse and on platforms scroll between Arabic and English, rather slowly.   (updated Sep 2020)\n30.00538431.2080095 Giza railway station (Omm El-Misryeen metro station). Not particularity near the pyramids, but Giza serves as a major hub for the city's southern parts. Most trains from Upper Egypt call here.    (updated Sep 2020)\n30.066331.18876 Cairo Bashteel railway station. New major station under construction, expected to open in 2023.      (updated Mar 2023)\n30.13099131.31917 Cairo Ain Shams railway station (Ain Shams metro station). Small station where slow trains to and from Suez terminate.    (updated Sep 2020)\n\n## By bus\nThe large red, white and blue public buses cover the entire city and are much cheaper, costing LE4-6, but are usually crowded and slow. However, there are the similar air-conditioned buses that charge LE7-12. They can be found in the main squares in Cairo. Also found in main squares are the smaller mini-buses that are usually orange and white or red, white and blue. Because of problems with sexual harassment women travellers are advised only to take the small minibuses and buses which prohibit standing. On minibuses, the fare starts at LE5 and goes up to LE15 depending on the length of the route.\nApart from the main bus stations, buses can be hailed from street-level. Buses are seldom marked with destination, instead passengers shout out (or use a number of sign-language like hand codes) their destinations and if the bus goes this place it will stop. Travellers unfamiliar with Cairo can ask bus drivers or passengers to let them know where there stop is. Simply politely blurt out the name of your destination to the bus driver or a friendly looking passenger and they will take care of you.\nLate night bus riders: bus frequency, length of route, and in some cases, fees can vary during the late evening hours onward. In some cases, a route may terminate, without notice, short of your destination. When this takes place, locals rely upon private citizens hoping to make some additional money, to get them to their final destination. As always, use caution, if you should choose to accept private transportation. Since many mini-buses will not depart until the bus is nearly full, you should be prepared for a lengthy period of time, while the driver waits for enough people to board.\nThere are a number of major bus stations (mawqaf موقف, pl. mawaqif مواقف) throughout the city. One of the largest is conveniently located behind the Egyptian Museum in Midan Tahrir. There are actually two stations - the main bus station for the city buses, and the minibus station behind it. There are also bus stations in Midan Ramses, under the overpass. Buses run from Ramses to Heliopolis, City Stars Mall and other destinations not covered by the Tahrir bus station.\n\n## Get around\nYou will find that it's useful to have several maps handy if you are looking to get around Cairo on your own. Spellings of street and place names can vary from map to map and from map to actual location, and not every street will appear on every map.\n\n## By metro\nCairo is home to Africa's first and most expansive metro system. While Cairo's metro system is modern and sleek, the three lines are all too limited in scope. The rolling stock is modern on line 3 (and sometimes 2) with AC. And line 3 (the most recent one) is operated by RATP Dev, a subsidiary of RATP, the French operator of the Paris metro.\nAs of October 2024, a single trip ticket ranges from LE8-20, depending on the number of stations covered:\nLE8: up to 9 stations (yellow ticket)\nLE10: 10-16 stations (green ticket)\nLE15: 17-22 stations (purple ticket)\nLE 20: more than 23 stations (beige ticket)\nIt is a crowded subway, but no more than Tokyo, Paris or London. If you are used to the metro in big cities and/or can deal with the crowding (be extra careful to avoid pickpocketing), it is the best way of avoiding traffic jams while travelling.\nThe key interchanges are Shohadaa (Martyrs) (formerly Mubarak) at Midan Ramses, Sadat at Midan Tahrir, and Attaba (Ataba; عتبة).\nYou'll need to be assertive (but not stroppy) when trying to buy tickets - Egyptians don't queue. First get your small change ready in a quiet area, so you're not fumbling with wallet and big notes and dropping your passport amidst the crowd. Then steadily press through the crowd to the ticket window, as they are doing. If you intend to make a return or future trip, buy multiple tickets, so you only have to scrummage once. There are ticket vending machines available, though sometimes they're low on change.\nThe Cairo Metro has stations in Dokki and Maadi, among other places. To reach the Giza Pyramids, take the metro to Giza town then pick up a bus or taxi for \"Al-Haram\". You can also reach Heliopolis (Masr el-Gedida) using line 3, at the stations: Al Ahram (Korba) and Koleyet El Banat (Merghani). The extension of this line to the airport was due in 2020 but still isn't finished yet. As of June 2025, line 3 has one branch ending in Adly Mansour. The station to the airport is still under construction.\nTwo cars in the middle section of each train are reserved for women. One of them is for women only till 9PM, while the other is for women all the time. The metro stops running at around 12:20AM and starts up again around 5:15AM. There are no timetables for lines 1 and 2, but departures are very frequent. Line 3 runs every 8 minutes.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis in Cairo are solid white. They are equipped with meters but these are not always used. They can be hailed from the street, and are common enough to be used perhaps exclusively (given a little patience) by any traveler.\nTaxis usually expect more money for ferrying more people. If you decide not to negotiate the price beforehand (this is the better method) be ready to jump ship and/or bargain hard if the cabbie brings up the fare after you are in the car. They rarely accept more than 4 people to a taxi.\nDo not let the taxi driver choose you. You choose him and always look confident as if you use them regularly. Flag one down, hop in and always sit in the back of the cab. Try not to get into any discussion with the driver. Simply state your destination and look out the window. Ignore any chat if you can. Egyptians do not chat with drivers on the whole. Avoid eye contact especially in the mirror.\nDo not confirm the fare before getting in, ordinary Egyptians do not do that. As a tourist, you might prefer to state a price beforehand, which may prevent ripoffs, but will require you to quote above local prices. Instead the correct sum is paid through the window after leaving. You simply step out of the cab, with no discussion of the price (unless the taxi driver thinks you've given them an unfair price). If you are obviously a tourist with your Lonely Planet Guide, North Face backpack, and are wearing shorts then you can sometimes expect an argument even if you have offered the correct price. Either pay them more to keep the peace (odds are they need the money more than you) or just walk away. As long as the driver does not leave the car, you are alright. If this happens, consult someone nearby. Try to avoid those loitering outside 5-star hotels and restaurants to minimise this. Using a big hotel as your destination may also inflate the price.\nTaxi drivers may try to pressure you into taking an expensive tour with them instead of a cheap ride.\nIf you feel unsafe, such as if the driver drives recklessly, tell the driver to slow down. If he does not do this immediately, ask him to stop and simply get out and walk away, but be careful not to end up at a remote place where it would be dangerous and difficult to find another thing to ride. Never continue travelling in any vehicle which you deem to be unsafe, especially in the dark on unlit roads, or in single track highways where overtaking is dangerous.\n\n## By ride-hailing service\nIt's preferable to use Careem, inDrive or Uber rather than regular cabs. Locals consider them cheaper and safer (especially for women). Just get a local SIM card and you'll be fine. You can also find the app price, get a screen shot, and use that to negotiate with cabs.\nCareem. Smart phone app offers address based routing and calculates price according to them. You need an Egyptian phone number (e.g. from a local SIM card) to use Careem. (updated Oct 2025)\ninDrive. Smart phone app offers address based routing and allows you to negotiate a price with multiple drivers. (updated Oct 2025)\nUber Cairo. Smart phone app offers address based routing and calculates price according to them. (updated Mar 2021)\n\n## By bicycle\nCairo is generally not safe for cycling. A small bike sharing system called Cairo Bike does exist.\n\n## Disabled access\nAccess in Cairo is patchy. Anyone with moderate to serious mobility issues should expect to spend a lot of time in taxis.\nMany buildings have step-only access. Pavements are variable, even around the popular tourist attractions. There is often an incredibly steep drop from the curbs and where there are ramps they are better suited to pushchairs than wheelchairs. Expect potholes, gulleys, poorly cordoned-off building works and street works, and cars parked across the pavement, where there is a pavement at all.\nThe white stick is recognised and help is often offered. The help that is offered can be a little misguided at times but it's usually well intentioned.\nAlthough more expensive by far, it is probably best to arrange taxis for major trips (such as visiting the pyramids) via your hotel. Picking up a taxi on the street can be hit and miss. Do not expect to be dropped off at the exact spot that you asked for; you will often be taken to somewhere nearby. Always fix a price before you get into a taxi.\nConcessions on tickets cannot be taken for granted. For example, the Egyptian Museum offers a 50% concession for disabled patrons (and students) whereas the Cairo Tower doesn't offer concessions at all.\nA visit to the pyramids is a must. How one does it is either through one of the many stables around the site or taking a taxi to the Sphinx entrance and attempting to walk. The site is amazingly up and down. A good level of mobility would be required to attempt it by foot. If you opt for a horse/camel ride, make sure that you haggle hard. (July is the quiet season, when it may be possible to get a 2-hour camel ride for less, albeit when you're with someone who knows the owner of the stables).\nIf you are visually impaired or in any other way disabled it may be possible to gain permission to touch the pyramids. The outside of the pyramids are usually off limits to tourists and surrounded by a cordon. To arrange permission to touch a pyramid, approach one of the many tourist police dotted around the site. (Since the revolution with decreased tourism it is a lot easier to do things like climb on the pyramids, go inside the Sphinx fence or inside the pyramids - for a charge!)\n\n## See\nCairo is a vast metropolitan cityscape. It includes an array of modern skyscrapers, mosques, bazaars and ruins of associated ancient monuments outside the city.\nCairo has an overwhelming array of attractions, listed under their individual districts along with transport and other practicalities. Some highlights:\nPyramids of Giza and the Sphinx. The oldest and only surviving monuments of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it is the country's most famous tourist attraction. See it now before the hordes return.\nGrand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is the newest national museum in Giza, Egypt. It is located about two kilometers from the Giza Pyramid Complex.\n30.04777831.2333331 Egyptian Museum (250 m north of Tahrir square), ☏ +20 2 25796948. Much of its collections were moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum in 2022. Adult 550 LE, student: 275 LE; photography (personal use) free; video 300 LE.      (updated Oct 2025)\nCitadel and Mosque of Mohamed Ali Pasha, in Islamic Cairo. A grand castle built by Salah Al-Din. Also parts of the water pipes (Majra Al-Oyouon) are still there, these pipes used to carry the water from the Nile River to the citadel. Mohamed Ali is considered to be the founder of modern Egypt, the ancestor of the last King of Egypt, King Farouk.\nAl-Azhar Mosque. One of the pillars of Islamic thought and home to the world's oldest university.\nNational Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC) hosts a sweeping collection that gives you an overview of Egyptian culture through the ages.\nIbn Tulun (مسجد أحمد بن طولون) (close to Sayida Zeinab). Arguably the oldest mosque in Cairo, built between 868-884.\nThe Coptic Quarter, in Coptic Cairo, notably the museum and the \"Hanging Church\" (Church of the Virgin Mary)\nCairo Tower (185 m./610 ft.) on Gezira Island offers a 360-degree view of Cairo, along with the Giza Pyramids off in the distance to the west.\n30.040531.26462 Al-Azhar Park. A landscaped garden overlooking the Citadel\n30.047531.2622223 Khan El Khalily. Cairo's souk area where visitors will find many merchants selling perfume, spices, gold, Egyptian handicrafts.\n30.041731.24834 Abdeen Palace. About 1 km east of Midan El-Tahrir, it was the royal residence until the Egyptian monarchy was deposed in 1952.      (updated Jan 2018)\nPharaonic Village. Welcome to Egyptland! Especially if you've kids in tow, this showground and retail park will give you an instant Egypt-in-miniature. In Giza about 20 minutes drive from Downtown. (updated Jan 2018)\n\n## Further afield\n29.831.2333335 Dahshur Pyramids. For a contrast to touristy Pyramids of Giza, head south to the oldest known pyramid, the Red Pyramid. The neglected Dahshur Pyramids are interesting and worth a visit, considering its history and the hassle-free atmosphere. Also, see the weird Bent Pyramid there and hike around the area to the Black Pyramid. The Red Pyramid has an entrance to the inside, which you can climb down.   (updated Jan 2018)\nAlso, the pyramids of Saqqara and Memphis offer an easy day trip out of Cairo.\n\n## Coffee and shisha\nHave a coffee, mint tea or Cola at El Fishawy's coffee shop in Khan El-Khalili. Smoke a shisha water pipe (try the \"double apple\" flavor) and watch the world go by. Great cheap entertainment.\n\n## Felucca\nRide a felucca along the Nile River. A great way to relax and enjoy a night under the stars in Cairo. Feluccas are available across from the Four Seasons Hotel in Garden City. Pay after your ride, or you may get much less than you bargained for. Public boats with loud noisy music and a giggling crowd are also available for 1/2 hour, but are very uncomfortable.\n\n## Parks\nCairo has a shortage of parks, but a few of them exist.\nThe most famous is the Giza Zoo, which is in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in Giza. This is one of the oldest zoos in the world, opened in 1891.\nHadiqat Al Orman (English: Al Orman Gardens), Giza. This is a fairly large park near the Giza Zoo. It can be entered by paying a daily ticket at the gate. It contains a variety of trees and flowers and is a nice place to escape the noise and traffic of the city. However, it may be very crowded with locals, especially on weekends and public holidays like Eid.\nHadiqat Al Azbakiya (English: Al Azbakieya Gardens). Another nice park to enjoy the greenery and scenery of trees and gardens, while remaining inside the city. It is located in the Azbakiya area of Cairo, and the best option is to take a taxi.\nGenenet El Asmak (English: Garden of the Fish), Zamalek. A nice park, which also includes several large caves containing water aquariums, where you can see different species of fish and underwater life through glass windows. Like other parks, a very cheap ticket enables you to enter and enjoy the day there.\nMerryland (Arabic: Genenet El Merryland), in Heliopolis district near Roxy Cinema. Again, another park with trees and gardens and nice scenery, and there are restaurants and cafes in the park.\nEl Hadiqa El Dawliya (English: the International Garden),  in Nasr City district. It was opened when Nasr City district was built in the 1960s. Sections of the park contain copies of famous buildings from around the world (i.e. the Eiffel Tower of Paris, Great Wall of China, the windmills of Holland). The copies are much smaller of course, similar to small statues. Interesting to see.\nAl-Azhar Park - has restaurants and entertainment available. It has a good vantage point of Islamic Cairo and the city skyline.\nYou can also take a stroll along the Corniche el-Nil, and there is a river promenade on Gezira Island.\nDesert Park. Wadi Digla Protected Area is a 60-km² environmentally protected park near Ma'adi, that offers opportunity for taking a trek, jogging, rock climbing, and cycling. Wadi Degla is also a good spot for bird watching, and viewing the various reptile species, plants, and deer that reside there. You can take a cab from Ma'adi to the entrance at Wadi Delga. Cab drivers in Ma'adi should know where to go.\n\n## Recreation\nOther options for relaxation include visiting the Giza Zoo and the Cairo Botanical Gardens, or watching horse racing at the Gezira Club in Zamalek, or, when you need a break from city life, try a round of golf on the famous Mena House Golf Course overlooking the Pyramids, or The Hilton Pyramids Hotel tournament golf course and nearby Sixth Of October City, Ten minutes drive from Giza Pyramids.\nOr if the family, and especially children are fed up looking at monuments and museums, a 10-minute trip from the Giza Pyramids by micro-bus, taxi, or car, will take you to two of the biggest and best theme parks in Cairo, Dream-park, and Magic land, both in nearby Sixth Of October City.\nMagic land is also part of The Media Production City complex, including The Mövenpick Hotel, where visitors can take a tour of the Egyptian TV and drama sets, and studios which house many of the Egyptian and other Arabic TV stations.\n\n## Shopping\nCitystars is Egypt's premier shopping mall and is quite comparable to a foreign mall. It offers most international brands and most international food chains. It offers a cinema and amusement park. Mall of Arabia is a brand new spacious shopping mall in the suburb of 6 October City. It is Cairo's other premier shopping destination, featuring many of the same American and European clothiers as Citystars.\n\n## Sports\nFootball: The national soccer team play at Cairo International Stadium in Nasr City 10 km east of the centre. Half the club teams in the Premier League, Egypt's top tier, are based in Cairo, so there will be several top-flight matches on any weekend October to April. Choose from Zamalek (also based at International Stadium), Al Ahly, Pyramids, Future, National Bank, ENPPI, Ceramica Cleopatra, El Geish, Al Mokawloon and East Company.\nHorse riding in the desert from one of the Nazlet El-Samaan stables such as FB Stables (contact Karim +20 106 507 0288 or visit the website) in Giza. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out over night with a barbecue and fire. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, FB Stables is also great for a 'tourist' type ride to view the Pyramids from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Seer can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and full moon rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivaled views over the Pyramids - a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light show.\n\n## Music and culture\nSufi dancing - The Al Tanura Troupe offers free performances every Saturday, Monday and Wednesday night at 8:30PM (7:30PM during winter) at the Al-Ghouri Mausoleum. This picturesque place is situated nearby the Khan el Khalili souk, on a narrow street between the Al Azhar and Al Ghouri mosques.\nThe Culture Wheel (الساقية Al-Saqia). The largest independent cultural centre in Cairo, offers concerts almost every night.\nThe Garden Theater. In Al-Azhar Park offers a range of musical performances. The venue is also a great place for an evening stroll.\nCairo Opera House. It hosted the Cairo International Film Festival in 2012 and screened some international films with very cheap subsidized ticket prices.\nEgyptian Centre for Culture & Art (MAKAN). Egyptian Traditional music.\nThe Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art, Hussein El Me'mar Pasha street, ☏ +20 2 2 576 80 86, info@thetownhousegallery.com.

(updated Apr 2020)\nKalimat Language and Cultural Centre, 22, Mohamed Mahmoud Shaaban St., Mohandessin, ☏ +202 761 8136, +202 337 5814. This is a great language school with a lot of friendly teachers and students from around the world. (updated Apr 2020)\n\n## Work\nThere are many thousands of people from South East Asia, China, and the Far East working low-paying jobs in factories and similar places. They're hired because they're cheaper than hiring locals.\nSome well-to-do families also like to hire foreign workers to work in their houses as cleaners, housekeepers etc. The majority come from poorer African countries or places like the Philippines and Indonesia.\nIf you come from the West however, the situation may be very different depending on your qualification. The most demanded are those who come from native English speaking countries (i.e. the UK, USA, Canada, Australia). The most demanded jobs for these people are English teachers at schools and some university professors. There are many foreign schools in Cairo and some other big cities that prefer to hire native English speakers as part of their school staff. The reason is obviously the ability to teach English with a native accent and more importantly their foreign qualifications. Other opportunities may arise in similar institutions if your native language is French, less if it's German, and even less if it is some other European language.\nThere is some demand for Russians also in nightclubs, and hotels. The tourism industry in general may be willing to hire foreigners from European backgrounds to work in countless diving centres and small business around the Red Sea area in Dahab, Hurghada, and Sharm El Sheikh, where many tourists come from Europe to take diving courses in their native language (German, Dutch, French, Italian, Russian, English, Polish) and other languages being the most popular.\nThe American International School in Cairo (AIS), (2 locations in 6 October City Sheikh Zayed) and Fifth Settlement (EL Tagamoa El Khames ) the two being on the Western and Eastern corners of the city.\nCAC (Cairo American College) in Maadi, with a long history of American curriculum and American/Foreign staff, and foreign students.\nThe American University in Cairo\nCanadian International College\nGerman University in Cairo (GUC)\nFor other kinds of jobs, the best option is to have a technical background or previous managing experience in a multinational company and get transferred to the local branch of the company in Egypt.\nOther opportunities include teaching English as a free-lance instructor, but it may take a while before you are able to gather enough students to make a good living. Many people in Egypt want to learn English or improve it as it is always demanded in the Egyptian market.\nIf you have professional qualifications there are many possibilities for work in Cairo. Try any of the local employment or job websites:\nCareer Mideast, one of the oldest job websites in the country, serving the entire Middle East Region, even other countries\nBayt you will find jobs in the entire Middle East including Egypt in all sectors\nThe American Chamber of Commerce website (they have a comprehensive database of all kinds of jobs in all sectors and industries)\nWazayef Masr (it can be easily found on Google search)\nThere are several employment fairs that take place every few months in Cairo. Most of them are free to attend by anyone looking for a job. They usually are advertised in English adverts in the Arabic newspapers such as Al Ahram newspaper. The ads are easy to spot as they are large picture advertisements and written in English, even though the newspaper is in Arabic. They normally take place in well-known places like large five star hotels or the City Stars shopping complex. Examples include Job Master Job Fair, Wazayef Masr Job Fair, and the American Chamber of Commerce Job Fair. You can meet lots of different employers, with mostly multinational companies based in Cairo and other local well-known Egyptian companies. Most recruitment teams at the fairs speak fluent English. You must bring your cv/resume as most employers expect you to apply for a job on the same day, then you will be called for an interview a few days/weeks later if they have a suitable vacancy. Take at least 20-30 copies, one for each employer and dress semi-formally or formally.\nAnother option is any of the foreign embassies located in Cairo.\nYou can also try the English weeklies al-Ahram and al-Waseet for job vacancies. Otherwise, if you have some connections, you can always network with people that you know, and sometimes it may lead to landing a job somewhere.\nEgyptian work conditions may be very different from Western ones. It is more of a friendly casual environment, but everybody is still treated with respect. Working hours are normally 9AM-5PM, and the weekend is Friday and Saturday (Friday substituted for Sunday because it is the day that Muslims go to pray at the mosque). Annual leave is normally 21 days, and most national holidays are days off as well.\n\n## Buy\nATMs are found in various places throughout downtown. A more secure option are the ATMs in the five star hotels. There also are numerous places that handle currency exchange, or you can try any major bank such as HSBC or Commercial International Bank.\nForeign currencies can also be exchanged for Egyptian pound in all the Egyptian banks like Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt[dead link], Banque de Caire[dead link], Arab African Bank[dead link], the United Bank[dead link], or the large branches of Bureau de Change.\nMany merchants will try to scam you out of as much as they possibly can. A particularly common trick are the papyrus museums. They come in many different flavours, but they often call themselves galleries, museums or workshops. You will be given a brief talk or demonstration on how papyrus is made, and warned against cheaper shops that make their papyrus from banana leaf (though no matter where you go, no one has a sample to show you, questioning the legitimacy of this \"warning\"). The prices will be in the hundreds, and you will be offered what appears to be an excellent discount. If you look around, however, you will see most of what they offer is worth very little. Tour guides, taxi drivers and hotel staff are all in on this, and will often get a 50% commission if they lead an unwitting tourist into this trap.\nThe Khan El-Khalili bazaar is a giant souq in Islamic Cairo. The merchants here are ravenous and skilled, so don't fall for the hard sell and be prepared to haggle. This is a great place to buy rustic glassware and perfume bottles. Be choosy.\nZamalek has a number of small, but high-end shops, along with shops selling crafts, jewelry and other items. Fair Trade Cairo in Zamalek is a great shop selling high quality crafts made by local artisans. Nefertari, also in Zamalek, has wonderful organic cotton linens, skin care products, and the like. There is also Nomad, that has a small, charming second floor showroom in Zamalek, as well as Nagada, and Khan Misr Taloun. Diwan, in Zamalek, is a very nice primarily English-language bookstore.\nMidan Talaat Harb and surrounding streets, including Talaat Harb Street, are home to countless shops, selling everything from shoes and books to sweets.\nThe Midan Ataba area in Downtown Cairo is home to large bookseller markets, where you can find inexpensive books, as well as electronics and clothing markets, but be aware of the over crowding, as it is easier to pickpocket.\n\n## Eat\nCairo has an enormous number of restaurants, catering to most needs. Ironically though, one may want to avoid any restaurants listed in popular guidebooks. Egyptian restaurants have a habit of after being listed, cooking up a special English menu with vastly inflated prices. That said, cheap food can be found everywhere in street restaurants and snack stalls. The top notch restaurants are often, but not always, found in hotels and Nile boats. The borders between restaurants and cafes are not crystal-clear in the Egyptian capital. In many places it is perfectly acceptable to just have a drink or sheesha. Medium and high-range outlets might have a minimum charge. Cheaper restaurants will normally not serve alcohol as well as some more expensive outlets.\nIn general, downtown is good for budget eating, while for higher quality eating you should head to Zamalek, Mohandiseen or any of the other more affluent parts of town.\n\n## Egyptian and Middle Eastern food\nTraditional Egyptian staples are available almost everywhere. In stalls and street restaurants you will find traditional dishes like fūl (bean paste), falāfel, moussaka, koshari (rice, macaroni, lentils, chick peas and tomato sauce), feTīr (pancakes with different fillings) and shawarma (an import from Lebanon and Syria — pieces of roasted meat usually wrapped in bread). Cheaper places will only serve up vegetables and maybe beef hot dogs or corned beef. Eggs, fried potatoes and salads are also usually available. Hygiene varies wildly and the best advice is to go for the most visited places. Avoid empty restaurants as the food will be less fresh. Especially downtown, you can find many good koshari shops, including many outlets of the excellent Koshari Tahrir chain. Delicious and cheap fūl, falāfel, and shawarma sandwiches can be bought at the many outlets of popular Gad fast food chain dotted around Cairo.\nIn the medium and upper price range your choice of traditional Egyptian food will be more limited. Although the situation is improving, traditionally Egyptian gastronomical experiences are still mostly restricted to private homes. Quality chain restaurants like Felfela (several outlets), Abou El Sid (Zamalek, Maadi and Dokki), Cairo Kitchen (Zamalek and Maadi), and Abou Shakra offer authentic Egyptian food.\nOtherwise oriental or Middle Eastern restaurants tend to mix styles or completely go for more Lebanese-style eating, considered more stylish by rich Cairenes. The good side of this is that Cairo is blessed with many quality Lebanese outfits, from chains like Dar Al-Qamar to stylish restaurant establishments. Additionally, Turkish food and restaurants catering to Gulf visitors can be found.\n\n## Western and Asian food\nCairo has a number of Western fast food outlets available. McDonalds, Hardees, Pizza Hut, and KFC[dead link] are spread about the city, but they are relatively more expensive. Most of these also offer free wireless internet.\nLighter meals like sandwiches and salads as well as pastries can be found in western-style bakeries and cafes. Popular chains like Cilantro, Beanos and Costa as well as individual outlets all offer more or less similar dishes. Most of these places also offer free wireless internet.\nMaison Thomas has several branches throughout Cairo, including Mohandiseen, Zamalek, and Maadi, and serves some of the best pizza in Cairo. If you prefer more stylish international dining, Cairo offers a wide variety: Italian, Chinese and Japanese outlets in addition to the ambiguous continental cooking abound, especially in areas like Zamalek, Mohandseen and Dokki.\n\n## Hygiene and diet issues\nFor health reasons it is advisable not to drink tap water or eat unpeeled fresh fruits and vegetables—at least for the first few days of the visit. There are few solely vegetarian options, L'aubergine in Zamalek is a good restaurant for vegetarian food. Otherwise, Egyptian cuisine is dominated by vegetable courses, but be aware of \"hidden\" meat in stock, sauces and the like. One should also be cautious about frozen drinks or ice creams sold outside of main hotels. Also, if served eggs, one should be cautious to ensure that they are fully cooked (sunny side up eggs may allow certain organisms to be transmitted).\n\n## Self-catering\nThe Metro chain and Alfa Market dotted around Cairo are convenient supermarkets. They often stock Western brands. Otherwise vegetables and fruit are plentiful and cheap. Bakeries such as The Bakery chain sell western-style bread and pastries. Organic food from the local ISIS brand is available at the supermarkets Metro and Carrefour and the Sekem Shop in Ahmed Sabri Street (شارع احمد صبر), Zamalek.\nBy far the cheapest and most satisfying option, buying from souks and outdoor markets makes for a crash course in Arabic and haggling, not to mention that the produce is often superb! Bread can be found on nearly every corner and comes in two types - whole wheat aysh baladi and white flour aysh shami. Both are baked fresh daily and delivered by thousands of kids on bicycles to every corner of the city. Every neighborhood has a few streets dedicated to produce and other goods. Always wash fruit thoroughly before eating. Eating a fresh Roma tomato in the heat of Summer straight from a market seller after being washed is a delight, hard to match. The fruits and vegetables in Egypt may not conform to EU or US standards of size, but their taste is far superior.\nSmall bakeries (furne) sell every kind of baked good imaginable - ranging from Italian style bread sticks with nigella and sesame seeds to croissants, donuts and anything with dates in it. Fresh goods from these bakeries offers a nice alternative to the standard Egyptian breakfast of beans, beans, and beans, as well as the fact that this bread is very cheap.\n\n## Drink\nCairo has a wide range of drinking options from the very traditional to fashionable and modern. At the other end of the scale, almost any street in Cairo has a traditional coffee house, ´ahwa, a traditionally male institution of social life tracing many hundreds of years back in history. Besides that you'll find everything from fruit stalls to patisseriés and bakeries and modern cafés whipping up all varieties of modern European coffee. In addition to the traditional Turkish coffee and shai tea, virtually everywhere you'll find drinks like hibiscus tea kerkedeeh, served warm or cold depending on season, sahleb, a milk-based drink usually served in winter, fakhfakhenna (a kind of fruit salad), sugarcane juice, mango and tamarind juice, Tamr hindi.\n\n## Traditional coffee houses\nCairo remains one of the best cities in the world to sample the traditional coffee house culture of the region. They are called maqhâ in Standard Arabic, but in the local dialect this is turned into ´ahwa. The Turkish coffee remains an invariable ingredient in any Cairene coffee house, and water pipe (sheesha) and tea is even more popular. While considered \"old fashioned\" for a time, these places are again turning fashionable among younger crowds and even smoking a water-pipe is no longer a male-only pastime. Places vary from just a small affair—plastic chairs and tables put out on the street—to more elaborate cafes especially in upscale and tourist areas.\nFor many, the sheesha or water pipe, is the main attraction of any visit to a Cairene coffee house. It is usually available in at least two varieties, mu´assal, pure tobacco, and tofâh, apple-flavored. Other fruit varieties are sometimes available. Coffee houses range from the more elaborately decorated to a simple counter and some plastic chairs and tables spread out in the street. Foreigners are invariably made welcome, although women might feel uncomfortable visiting coffee houses in traditional, poor areas of the city. However, in downtown and the tourist areas of Islamic Cairo single or women-only groups should not expect anything more than the ordinary hassle.\nTurkish coffee (´ahwe turki) is served either sweet (helwa), medium sweet (masbout), with little sugar (sukr khafeef) or no sugar (sâda). Sweet means very sweet. Tea (shai) is served either as traditional loose tea (kûshari, not to be confused with the Cairo macaroni-rice stample kushari), known as dust tea in English, or in a tea bag. Most coffee shops usually offer fresh mint leaves to put in your tea, upon request. A range of soft drinks are usually available. Most typically you will find hibiscus tea (karkadee), served warm in the winter season and cold during the warmer parts of the year.\n\n## Fruit juice stalls\nDuring the hot Cairo summer, fruit juice stalls selling fresh juice (and occasionally fruit salads and other soft drinks) are a delight not to be missed. Basically these places sell fresh-pressed juice of whatever is in season. Typical choices include orange (borto'ân), lemon (lamūn), mango (manga) and strawberry (farawla), guava (gawafa), pomegranate (Rommân). Prices and quality depend on season and availability. These places are spread out around the city and available at almost all the places tourists typically visit and in all local residential districts. Traditional coffee houses or fruit juice stalls might sell all or some of these drinks.\nA health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general, food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. Some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water.\n\n## Modern cafes and pastry shops\nModern cafes and patisseries are spread out around the city. Typically they serve light food like sandwiches and salad in addition to espresso-based coffees and pastries. Many of these places are chains, like Cilantro, Beanos, Cinnabon, Orangette, the Bakery and Coffee Roastery. Most of these places, including all the chains mentioned above, offer wireless internet connection as well. International chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks are also widely available throughout Cairo.\n\n## Nightlife\nFor the capital of a Muslim country, Cairo is relatively liberal when it comes to the consumption of alcohol. A wide range of bars and dance clubs is available, basically in every major hotel, and some are open 24/7. If you would like to explore the less fancy drinking places in Cairo, Downtown is definitely the place to go. Upscale nightspots are found in and around the Zamalek area\n\n## Sleep\nCairo has a tremendous range of accommodation, from low-rent budget hotels downtown to five-star palaces along the Nile. See individual district articles for hotel listings.\nYou can also stay in an accommodation in Giza directly at an entrance to the pyramid area. Many of these accommodations have a pyramid view.\n\n## Mail\nThe main post office[dead link] of Cairo is on Midan Ataba (open Sa-Th 7AM-7PM, F and holidays 7AM-noon). The poste restante office is to be found along the side street to the right of the main entrance to the post office and through the last door (open Sa-Th 8AM-6PM, F and holidays 10AM-noon) - mail will be held for 3 weeks.\nAlways use the register mail facility to post anything valuable or important. It takes longer but each step of the journey is recorded, as many letters do not arrive at their destinations when using regular mail service.\n\n## Mobile phones\nInstead of using your phone from your home country (which often tend to carry very high roaming fees), consider obtaining an Egyptian SIM card or cheap unlocked phone. The 2 main carriers in Egypt are Orange Egypt and Vodafone Egypt, with UAE's Etisalat a growing 3rd player in the Egyptian market. Orange and Vodafone offer the best coverage, but for tourists Etisalat is the best option because it gives the most bang for your buck with minutes and seems to have the lowest calling rates abroad out of any of the three.\nYou can find mobile dealerships in every section of Cairo, and getting set up is fairly easy. You will need to bring your passport. If you don't have an unlocked phone, many shops will sell cheap older models as secondhand phones. But beware, make sure that the phone is fully functional before purchasing it, and buying a used one is at your own risk (as a good percentage of these tend to be stolen ones).\n\n## Tourist information\nThe Egyptian Tourist Authority http://www.touregypt.net has offices in Cairo City Center, 5 Adly Street, phone: 3913454, Pyramids, Pyramids Street, phone: 3838823, fax: 3838823, Rameses Railway Station, phone: 5790767, Giza Railway Station, phone: 5702233, El Manial, Manial Palace, phone: 5315587, Airport, phone: 2654760, fax: 4157475, New Airport, phone: 2652223, fax: 4164195 and Cairo International, Airport phone: 2914255 ext.2223.\n\n## Stay safe\nScams against tourists are almost a national sport, though they're usually obvious. A good rule of thumb is that if someone approaches you on the street, they're trying to scam you. Don't talk to them. Common scams are:\nDuring politically-calm times, you can walk around the main streets anytime you feel like roaming. It is fairly safe and you will always find lots of people around smiling and offering to help. Women alone can expect to be the target of an excessive amount of catcalling, but it rarely goes beyond that. Around the more touristy locations there is an abundance of 'helpful' people, but be careful who you go with and under no circumstance let anyone push or guide you anywhere that you do not want to go! If you get lost look for the security and police officers. Many speak some English, and most know their local area very well as well as the tourist spots.\nCrossing streets is another major challenge in Cairo. Traffic lights, which only exist in a few locations, are routinely disregarded. In downtown Cairo, police officers may be controlling traffic at key intersections at busy times. Crossing the street is like playing the video game \"Frogger\", hurrying across the street one lane at a time, when there is a small break in traffic. One way to cross a street that proved to be effective is to place yourself next to an Egyptian who wants to cross the street and follow.\nAlso, when riding in a taxi, the driver may go quite fast and drive erratically. If at any time you feel unsafe, tell the driver to stop and get out.\nBe careful about wearing the jerseys of local football clubs Al Ahly and Zamalek, as violent incidents have been known to occur between the supporters of both clubs.\n\n## Emergency services\nPolice, ☏ 122.\nAmbulance, ☏ 123.\nFire, ☏ 180.\n\n## Stay healthy\nAs elsewhere in Egypt, be careful with what you eat. Raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings like mayonnaise and minced meat are particularly risky. Avoid cold salads and puddings from buffets even in the 5-star hotels just to be on the safe side. Opinions on tap water vary, but most visitors choose to stick to the bottled stuff. Large bottles of water can be purchased for LE10-20. Avoid ice in drinks, and only eat fruit with a skin you can wash or peel.\nYou may find that stomach medications you bring from home simply don't work.\nAll visitors would do well to buy from any pharmacy Egyptian brand drugs. The best and most common being Entocid and Antinal. Diarrhea and vomiting can almost always be stopped by taking 2 of these tablets with a glass of water in a few hours.\nIf symptoms persist, it is wise to consult a doctor as dehydration can come on quickly in summer.\nSmog can reach extreme levels, especially in late summer and fall before the rains. This, coupled with the summer heat, can make spending time outdoors in the summer quite unpleasant.\nMosquitos are active from dusk till dawn, and one mosquito in a bedroom can cause much discomfort by morning, so it is always wise to kill any before sleeping. A fly swatter is best as they move due to air pressure. Wear long sleeves and long trousers when out at night. When outside, sit in a breeze or in front of a fan as they do not like moving air.\n\n## Hospitals\nFor medical care, hotels usually have a house doctor on call. Any major operations are best performed outside Egypt, but the following hospitals are generally considered the best in Cairo:\nCleopatra Hospital, Heliopolis, ☏ +20 2 2414-3931.\nDar El Fouad Hospital, 6th of October City, ☏ +20 2 3835-6030.\nBackpackers will see doctors' offices dotted all around Cairo on board signs. They are speciality specific. Just look for one and then inquire. Most surgeries open after 5PM and run late till sometimes midnight. A consultation fee will give you a consultation and one follow up appointment.\nTravellers can also visit private hospitals like El Salam, Dar Al Fouad, 6 October University Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Kasr El-Eney during the day. Each has an outpatient clinic with various specialists on duty. Usually no appointment is necessary and you will be seen depending on how early you arrive.\n\n## Embassies and consulates\nAfghanistan.\nAustralia, World Trade Centre (11th Floor), Corniche El Nil Boulac (Code No. 11111), ☏ +202 2770 6600, fax: +202 2770 6650, cairo.austremb@dfat.gov.au.\nBrazil, Nile City - North Tower C – 18th Floor, Nile Corniche, ☏ +202 24619837.\nCanada, Nile City Towers, 2005 (A) Corniche El Nile, South Tower, 18th floor, ☏ +202 2461 2200, fax: +202 2461 2201, cairo-cs@international.gc.ca.\nChina, 14 Bahgat Aly Street, Zamalek, ☏ +20 2 2738 0488, fax: +20 2 2735 9459, webmaster_eg@mfa.gov.cn.

They're a good spot for an afternoon picnic away from the city.\nAlexandria can be done as a day-trip, though it deserves longer. Top sights are the new library, the national museum, and Qaitbey fortress; then enjoy a fish dinner on the Corniche and maybe a drink. The train takes about 2½ hours, see section on \"Get in by train\" above for times and fares.\nAin al-Sukhna is the closest Red Sea resort to Cairo and easily reached on a day trip. This place is growing rapidly to become the getaway for Cairo's moneyed elite. To get here, hire a taxi for the day.\nFayoum is another popular place for Egyptians to picnic. While the city offers little in itself, the Qaroon lake and Wadi Al-Rayyan both offer scenic spots for relaxing and the area also contains some of the first pyramids in history. Get there by bus and then get a taxi to drive you around for the day. It's possible to stay overnight at the scenic Tunis village.\nSiwa and Bahariyya are oases in the desert, far from the city hubbub.\nThe other major centres in Egypt, needing several days to visit, are Luxor and Aswan for antiquities, and the Red Sea resorts such as Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh.",
