      "content": "Amarna (; Arabic: العمارنة, romanized: al-ʿAmārna) is an extensive ancient Egyptian archaeological site containing the ruins of Akhetaten, the capital city during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The city was established in 1346 BC, built at the direction of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and abandoned shortly after his death in 1332 BC.\nThe site is on the east bank of the Nile River, in what today is the Egyptian province of Minya. It is about 58 km (36 mi) south of the city of al-Minya, 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor (site of the previous capital, Thebes). The city of Deir Mawas lies directly to its west. On the east side of Amarna there are several modern villages, the chief of which are l-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.\nActivity in the region flourished from the Amarna Period until the later Roman era.\n\nName\nThe name Amarna comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements. The ancient Egyptian name means \"the horizon of the Aten\".\nEnglish Egyptologist Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as Alabastron, following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (On Stones) and Ptolemy (Geography), although he was not sure about the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.\n\nCity of Akhetaten\nThe area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was this city that Akhetaten described as the Aten's \"seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it\".\nIt may be that the Royal Wadi's resemblance to the hieroglyph for horizon showed that this was the place to found the city.\nThe city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mudbrick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.\nIt is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan in large part because it was abandoned almost completely shortly after the royal government of Tutankhamun quit the city in favor of Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign,  if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned, it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately 8 miles (13 km) of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population. The entire city is encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae (labeled A thru V with discontinuities left for those thought to be missing, Stele B was defaced by locals in 1885) detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.\nThe earliest dated stele from Akhenaten's new city is known to be Boundary stele K which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten's reign. (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten's foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh's wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife Nefertiti, and his eldest daughter Meritaten as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial. Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:\n\nHis Majesty mounted a great chariot of electrum, like the Aten when He rises on the horizon and fills the land with His love, and took a goodly road to Akhetaten, the place of origin, which [the Aten] had created for Himself that he might be happy therein. It was His son Wa'enrē [i.e. Akhenaten] who founded it for Him as His monument when His Father commanded him to make it. Heaven was joyful, the earth was glad every heart was filled with delight when they beheld him.\n\nThis text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten \"and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the lunettes of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays.\"\n\nSite and plan\nLocated on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a \"Royal Road\", now referred to as \"Sikhet es-Sultan\". The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the North City, with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.\n\nNorth City\nIf one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the North Riverside Palace. This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the royal family. Located within the North City area is the Northern Palace, the main residence of the royal family. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.\nThe North City was an administrative area. It contains the ruins of royal palaces, especially the Northern Palace and other administrative buildings and occupies an area between the river and the cliffs that terminate the plains to the north of the city itself.\n\nCentral City\nMost of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the Great Temple of the Aten and the Small Aten Temple were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the king and royal family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp. Located behind the Royal Residence was the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, where the Amarna Letters were found.\nThis area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.\n\nSouthern suburbs\nTo the south of the city was the area now referred to as the Southern Suburbs. It contained the estates of many of the city's powerful nobles, including Nakhtpaaten (Chief Minister), Ranefer, Panehesy (High Priest of the Aten), and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.\nFurther to the south of the city was Kom el-Nana, an enclosure, usually referred to as a sun-shade, and was probably built as a sun-temple., and then the Maru-Aten, which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for Akhenaten's queen Kiya, but on her death her name and images were altered to those of Meritaten, his daughter.\n\nCity outskirts\nSurrounding the city and marking its extent, the Boundary Stelae (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.\n\nAway from the city Akhenaten's Royal necropolis was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten's tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely Meketaten, his second daughter.\nIn the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their Tombs.\n\nLife in ancient Amarna/Akhetaten\nMuch of what is known about Amarna's founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city. These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.\nTo make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military. Ay, one of Akhenaten's principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father Yuya had been an important military leader. Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together; they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt's history under Akhenaten's father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, \"it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna.\"\n\nReligious life\nWhile the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, or perhaps more accurately, monolatrism, archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.\n\n... at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by Kemp (2008: 41–46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of Bes, the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, Taweret, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen's village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to Isis and Shed have been discovered (Watterson 1984: 158 & 208).\n\nThe Amarna letters\nIn 1887, a local woman digging for sebakh uncovered a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets (now commonly known as the Amarna Letters). These tablets recorded select diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in Akkadian, the lingua franca commonly used during the Late Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and led to a further increase in exploration.\n\nAmarna art-style\nThe Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions. Unlike the strict idealistic formalism of previous Egyptian art, it depicted its subjects more realistically. These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.\nWhile the worship of Aten was later referred to as the Amarna heresy and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.\n\nArchaeology\nThe first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by Claude Sicard, a French Jesuit priest who was travelling through the Nile Valley who described the site and made a crude sketch\nof Stela A. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by Napoleon's corps de savants in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in Description de l'Égypte between 1821 and 1830.\nAfter this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.\nThe Prussian expedition led by Richard Lepsius visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results included an improved map of the city. Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved Denkmäler plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892 Alessandro Barsanti and Urbain Bouriant partly cleared the robbed out king's tomb. In 1891 and 1892 Sir Flinders Petrie worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the Great Temple of the Aten, the Great Official Palace, the King's House, the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage, Petrie's excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded faience, glass, and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds). By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site's potential.\n\nModern excavations\nThe copyist and artist Norman de Garis Davies published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908.\nFrom 1907 until 1914 the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft expedition, led by Ludwig Borchardt, worked extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The first several years were spent doing\nsurvey work with excavation beginning in 1911. The famous bust of Nefertiti, now in Berlin's Ägyptisches Museum, was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.\nIn two seasons between 1923 and 1925 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort, Stephen Glanville, and John Pendlebury. Mary Chubb served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures. Their work resumed in\ntwo seasons between 1930 and 1932.\nExcavation resumed in the 1977 under with the Amarna Survey directed by Barry J. Kemp with the University of Cambridge and Amarna Expedition under Salvatore Garfi  under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society and continued until 1982. Work was curtailed at that point due to regional conditions but resumed in 1996 under the Amarna Project and still under the direction of Barry J. Kemp. In the 2000 season work also included the nearby arcaheologicl\nsite of Kom el-Nana and the start of a GPS survey of the region around Amarna. Much of the work during this period was at the house of the king's chief charioteer, Ranefer which had been partially excavated in 1921. A separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb.\nExcavation at Amarna, under Amarna Project, continues to the present. Work includes excavation at a cemetery, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles and at several other cemeteries of private individuals.\n\nIn media\nFictional\nThe Painted Queen written by the famous Elizabeth Peters a.k.a. Barbara Mertz is the most recent installment to the Amelia Peabody novels after the author's passing in 2013. Elizabeth Peters was a school trained archaeologist, but was persuaded by her male colleagues that a woman was not to be an archaeologist, so \"she created characters based on those misogynistic Egyptologists...\" as stated by Sarah Parcak, a female archaeologist that specializes in remote sensing. The adventure stars a female archaeologist Amelia Peabody and the mystery of the missing Bust of Nefertiti. The Painted Queen takes place in the 1912, several years after the actual excavations at Amarna, when excavations in Egypt are solely European, local hires, or looters. Like all good mystery novels, there is humor, twists, and turns, and a predictable ending of a solved case.\nNefertiti by Michelle Moran is a historical fiction work that guides the reader from the perspective of Queen Nefertiti and her younger sister Mutnodjmet. The story follows the timeline from her time in Thebes to Amarna and after Akhenaten's death. Nefertiti was the Chief wife in Akhenaten's court or haram. Though she is well known by name, as many historical female role models, her story is often overlooked for masculine rulers. Michelle Moran webs her story of the queen and her sister with political secrets, loss of innocence, and female strength in a patriarchal society.\n\nNon-fictional\nThe City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People by Barry Kemp, discusses everything from the conception of Amarna to the abandonment of the city. Within the book are images that display art, architecture, and the city as it was (reconstructed) and now. It also has a short chapter written by Kemp in the book Cities That Shaped the Ancient World.\n\nMagazines\nIn the past years National Geographic and archaeological articles have published articles on Amarna, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, or Nefertiti. Most of the article can be found in both the paperback or on the National Geographic website (currently the most recent article was published January 2021).\n\nOpera\nAkhnaten, act II, scene 3 (\"The City\") by Philip Glass describes the mandate from Akhenaten to build Akhetaten. In the English lines, it is consistently referred to as the \"City of the Horizon\".\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nAldred, Cyril (1988). Akhenaten: King of Egypt. London: Thames and Hudson.

      "content": "Amarna (Tell el-Amarna ou el-Amarna) est le site archéologique des ruines d'Akhetaton, la capitale construite par le pharaon Akhenaton aux alentours de -1360. \nLe nom arabe de Tell el-Amarna est sans doute la contraction des noms du village actuel, el-Till, et d'une tribu nomade, les Beni Amran, qui quittèrent le désert au XVIIIe siècle pour s'installer sur les bords du Nil. Akhetaton signifie « L'Horizon d'Aton » en égyptien ancien. \nÀ cet endroit, situé entre Thèbes et Memphis, les hautes falaises de la chaîne Arabique qui se dressent sur la rive droite du Nil s'écartent du fleuve pour former un hémicycle de douze kilomètres de longueur ; c'est là qu'en l'an 4 de son règne (vers -1360) Akhenaton jeta les fondations de la cité qui sera la capitale de l'empire égyptien pendant un quart de siècle. La ville, dédiée au culte du dieu unique Aton, fut élevée rapidement en briques crues et en talatates ; quatre ans après sa fondation, elle était déjà habitée par une population nombreuse qu'on estime à vingt mille personnes au moins. Des stèles frontières délimitèrent le territoire de la ville. Sur l'une d'entre elles, le roi proclame qu'Aton lui-même avait choisi cet emplacement parce qu'il était vierge de la présence de toute autre divinité. Lorsque Toutânkhamon quitta Akhetaton pour retourner à Thèbes, la cité fut laissée à l'abandon, puis démantelée par les successeurs d'Akhenaton et recouverte par les sables. \nAkhetaton est la seule ville de l'Égypte antique dont nous ayons une connaissance détaillée, notamment à cause du fait qu'elle fut désertée peu de temps après la mort d'Akhenaton, pour ne plus jamais être occupée. Cependant, en raison de son caractère exceptionnel et des conditions dans lesquelles la ville fut fondée puis abandonnée, il est difficile de savoir dans quelle mesure « L'Horizon d'Aton » était représentatif de l'urbanisme égyptien.\n\nLes fouilles\nVisité sporadiquement par des voyageurs et des collectionneurs d'antiquités au XVIIIe siècle, cartographié par les savants de la campagne d'Égypte, le site fut exploré au XIXe siècle par des missions archéologiques britanniques et allemandes. L'Allemand Karl Richard Lepsius copia les inscriptions, les fresques et les reliefs auxquels il avait accès et les publia dans ses Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien (1849-59) (Monuments d'Égypte et d'Éthiopie). D'autres relevés du site furent réalisés entre 1891 et 1908 par Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie et Norman de Garis Davies. Les publications de ces savants sont d'une grande valeur, car depuis lors le site fut vandalisé régulièrement par des villageois en quête de matériaux de construction et de sebakh, un engrais naturel. De 1907 à 1914, la Deutsche Orientgesellschaft explora l'atelier du sculpteur Thoutmès où elle découvrit le buste de Néfertiti qui est exposé depuis le 16 octobre 2009 au Neues Museum de Berlin. Les fouilles furent interrompues pendant la Première Guerre mondiale, puis reprirent dans les années 1920. Depuis 1977, la Société d'exploration de l'Égypte (Egypt Exploration Society) procède à l'étude systématique du site, sous la responsabilité de Barry J. Kemp, directeur des fouilles et professeur à l'Université de Cambridge.\n\nChronologie des fouilles\n1714 - Le jésuite français Claude Sicard décrit le premier une stèle d'Amarna ;\n1798-1799 - Les savants de Bonaparte établissent une carte d'Amarna publiée dans la Description de l'Égypte (1809 – 1828) ;\n1824 - Sir John Gardner Wilkinson explore et cartographie les ruines de la cité antique ;\n7 novembre 1828 - Jean-François Champollion visite brièvement le site ;\n1833 - Le copiste Robert Hay et G. Laver explorent des tombes sud et en reproduisent les reliefs sur des gravures conservées depuis à la British Library ;\n1843-1845 – Une expédition prussienne dirigée par Karl Richard Lepsius établit une topographie d'Amarna au cours de deux visites de douze jours. Les dessins et les moulages en plâtre que l'expédition avait réalisés sur les lieux sont publiés dans Denkmäler aus Ægypten und Æthiopien (1849-1859) ;\n1881-1882 - Découverte de la tombe d'Akhenaton par des habitants de la région ;\n1887 - Découverte d'un dépôt de tablettes d'argile gravées en cunéiforme : les lettres d'Amarna ;\n1891-1892 - Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie étudie le Grand temple d'Aton et les palais royaux entre autres ;\n1903-1908 - Norman de Garis Davies dessine et photographie les tombes et les stèles d'Amarna ;\n1907-1914 – Une mission archéologique allemande dirigée par Ludwig Borchardt sous la tutelle de la Société allemande d'Orient (Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft) fouille les périphéries nord et sud de la cité. Elle découvre notamment le fameux buste de Néfertiti, le 6 décembre 1912. Les fouilles sont interrompues par la Première Guerre mondiale.\n1921-1936 - T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort et John Pendlebury explorent le site ;\nAnnées 1960 - Des fouilles sont organisées régulièrement par le Conseil suprême des Antiquités égyptiennes ;\nÀ partir de 1977 - Barry J. Kemp dirige les expéditions de l'Egypt Exploration Society, qui deviennent annuelles ;\n1974-1989 - Geoffrey T. Martin publie ses études de l'hypogée dit la Tombe royale dans The Royal Tomb at el-Amarna.\n\nLes lettres d'Amarna\nEn 1887, une villageoise cherchant du sebakh sur le site découvrit un dépôt de plusieurs centaines de tablettes provenant des archives royales. Ces tablettes, les lettres d'Amarna, sont rédigées en akkadien cunéiforme, la langue des relations diplomatiques de l'époque. Il s'agit pour la plupart de missives échangées entre la cour royale et ses vassaux du Proche Orient ainsi que ses alliés d'alors. Cette découverte est très précieuse, car elle couvre les échanges entre les chancelleries depuis la fin du règne d'Amenhotep III, attestant encore une fois qu'une corégence avec son fils est plus que probable, jusqu'aux temps troubles du règne d'Akhenaton. Ainsi, elles comportent une série d'appels à l'aide lancés par les vassaux égyptiens en Syro-Palestine, menacés par les ambitions hittites, et des lettres adressées « au grand roi, leur frère » par les rois de Babylone, d'Assyrie et du Mittani, qui devaient eux aussi faire face à cette rupture de l'équilibre des forces dans la région auquel Pharaon semble cependant avoir été indifférent.\nBien sûr, les lettres d’Amarna ne donnent qu'un aperçu forcément incomplet de cette période, mais elles attestent néanmoins les liens étroits existant entre les cours royales de la région et témoignent de l'activité diplomatique intense qui dans l'Antiquité déjà caractérisait les rapports entre les protagonistes du Proche Orient.\n\nL'Horizon d'Aton\nLa ville, située en face d'Hermopolis Magna, formait un vaste ensemble qui s'étirait sur près de neuf kilomètres. Les fouilles ont révélé l'existence de quatre palais, étagés du nord au sud le long du Nil. Le « Palais nord des berges du fleuve » entouré d'un mur d'enceinte paraît avoir été la résidence royale, fortifiée et isolée de la ville proprement dite. Plus au sud se trouvait un deuxième palais construit vraisemblablement pour Kiya, la « Grande Épouse aimée du roi ». Au centre de la ville se dressait le Grand Palais ou Palais officiel avec ses nombreuses dépendances administratives, ses cours cérémonielles et son pavillon royal qui comprenait une salle d'audience. L'accès se pratiquait au nord et à l'ouest par deux axes de circulation qui se croisent et distribuent les différentes parties principales. Le portail nord donnait sur un vaste parvis qui précédait le Grand temple d'Aton, tandis que l'accès ouest devait donner sur le Nil et un port royal.\nLa grande avenue qui reliait le Grand palais aux deux palais septentrionaux, la voie royale, sans doute la voie processionnelle d'Akhenaton, divisait le palais en deux zones distinctes : l'une, à l'ouest de l'avenue, bordant le Nil, davantage administrative et cérémonielle, avec sa gigantesque salle du trône, et une grande cour avec un kiosque monumental bordée de colosses du rois ; l'autre, à l'est, plus intime avec les appartements royaux, ses jardins et ses dépendances. L'avenue était enjambée par un pont couvert reliant les deux parties, et dans lequel était aménagée une « fenêtre des apparitions », celle-là même depuis laquelle le roi couvrait de l'or de la récompense ses fidèles sujets. De part et d'autre du Palais officiel furent édifiés le Grand temple, la « Demeure d'Aton dans Akhetaton », une enceinte de 760 × 270 m, et le Petit temple, consacré lui aussi à Aton.\nÀ la périphérie sud enfin, le Marou-Aton était sans doute un lieu de plaisance et de recueillement, bâti pour satisfaire l'amour porté à la nature par la famille royale : il possédait de vastes jardins, dont le roi semble avoir fait un parc zoologique, ainsi que plusieurs lacs artificiels. \nLes deux temples d'Aton occupaient le centre de la ville, jouxtant le Grand Palais. Contrairement aux temples égyptiens habituels, où l'on passe de la lumière à l'ombre profonde du Saint des Saints, ils offraient aux rayons du dieu-soleil leurs cours à ciel ouvert et leurs trois cent soixante-cinq autels couverts d'offrandes. Ces sanctuaires furent vraisemblablement conçus sur le même modèle que le Gem-Aton (Aton est trouvé) de Karnak, partiellement dégagé, qu'Akhenaton avait fait édifier au début de son règne lorsqu'il résidait encore à Thèbes : ils étaient composés d’une salle hypostyle et d’une succession de pylônes, donnant sur six grandes cours avec  les autels à offrandes – à l’inverse de la structure des temples classiques où les cours précèdent les salles hypostyles. Les portes des pylônes devaient comporter une particularité : peut-être les linteaux étaient-ils brisés pour que rien n'entrave l'accès du soleil au temple. Il faut pourtant remarquer que pour les détails architecturaux les archéologues en sont souvent réduits à des hypothèses, chacun proposant la sienne, d’autant que des deux temples il ne subsiste que les fondations et les représentations dans les tombes.\n\nNéanmoins, on peut raisonnablement supposer que l'architecture de ces temples est la même que celle qu’Akhenaton voulut pour son Héliopolis du Sud, Thèbes, et il la développa de manière magistrale à Akhetaton comme il sied à une nouvelle capitale : il s'agissait donc de monuments exclusivement dédiés à la lumière solaire, ce qui les rattache davantage aux temples solaires de l'Ancien Empire qu'aux sanctuaires classiques du Nouvel Empire. Peut-être pouvons-nous même déceler dans ce type d’architecture des influences héliopolitaines, bien que le site d'Héliopolis ait été autant bouleversé que celui de Tell el-Amarna.\nAvec le Grand Palais, les deux temples d'Aton étaient l'élément déterminant d'Akhetaton – sa raison d'être, et ils formaient ainsi la scène sur laquelle se jouait la vie de la cour royale, mais aussi les grandes cérémonies rituelles exclusivement dédiées à Aton, et exclusivement accomplies par le roi lui-même.\nAutour de ce vaste ensemble s'éparpillaient sans aucune planification urbaine les demeures des dignitaires, entourées de maisons plus modestes, ce qui fait dire à Sergio Donadoni que « la ville surgit sans plan prémédité […] : près du dieu le roi, près du roi les dignitaires du royaume, près des dignitaires leurs auxiliaires – mais tout ceci sans qu'il existe des quartiers fondamentalement différenciés par le statut de leurs habitants ». L'intérêt principal de cet urbanisme désordonné est d'avoir été conservé tout au moins quant à ses fondations. Ainsi nous disposons de véritables plans de demeures amarniennes, depuis le palais royal jusqu'à la maison du simple serviteur. Ces témoignages sont uniques pour la période de la XVIIIe dynastie.\n\nLes nécropoles et le village des artisans\nL'autre transformation radicale qu'entreprit Akhenaton en fondant sa nouvelle capitale fut de transférer la nécropole royale en abandonnant la rive occidentale de Thèbes et la vallée des Rois. Cet évènement sans précédent s'appliqua également aux grands du royaume, qui renoncèrent à leurs projets thébains pour se faire inhumer au plus proche de leur souverain. Ce changement ne pouvait se faire sans l'établissement à Akhetaton d'une communauté d'artisans, peut-être ceux-là mêmes qui vivaient à Deir el-Médineh.\n\nLa nécropole des nobles\nLes sépultures des notables furent creusées dans la falaise, au nord et au sud de la ville. Elles sont peu nombreuses, une quarantaine environ, destinées aux grands dignitaires qui avaient choisi de suivre le pharaon dans sa capitale. Les mieux conservées, les plus belles aussi car décorées dans le plus pur style amarnien, sont le tombeau de Mahou, le chef de la police, et celui d'Aÿ, le successeur de Toutânkhamon. Ces tombes comportent des salles à colonnes, sans doute conçues et élaborées sur le modèle des grandes salles d'apparat des demeures que les dignitaires occupèrent de leur vivant. En cela, elles sont très semblables à celles que se firent aménager les courtisans d'Amenhotep III à Thèbes ouest, notamment le vizir Ramosé qui fut contemporain des deux règnes et dont le tombeau porte par ailleurs sur ses parois les premiers éléments du changement stylistique inspiré ou imposé par Akhenaton lui-même. \nDans les nécropoles amarniennes en revanche, les scènes sculptées sont exclusivement réalisées dans le nouveau style amarnien et elles ont toutes trait à la vie à Akhetaton. On y voit Pharaon et sa famille faire offrande au dieu Aton, de même que des descriptions du palais saisissantes de réalisme, bien qu'il soit parfois malaisé à les interpréter en raison de la façon non-perspective qu'avaient les Égyptiens de représenter les bâtiments. Il n'en reste pas moins que ces scènes tranchent avec les reliefs des tombes classiques. Ainsi, à l'entrée, sont figurés le propriétaire et sa compagne agenouillés face à la sortie et faisant le geste de la prière devant un long texte qui est un hymne au soleil. De la sorte, ils pouvaient bénéficier des premiers rayons du soleil levant et lui adresser une prière que le roi lui-même aurait écrite : l'Hymne à Aton.\n\nLa nécropole royale\nUn vaste hypogée situé à l'écart dans une gorge désertique, le ouadi royal, pourrait être le tombeau ayant abrité la dépouille momifiée d'Akhenaton, ainsi que celles de la famille royale, mais rien ne le prouve. Cet hypogée fut conçu pour abriter le corps du roi. On y a en effet relevé une multitude de fragments d'un sarcophage en quartzite rouge, qui a été reconstitué et est exposé actuellement dans les jardins du Musée du Caire. Ce sarcophage ressemble beaucoup à ceux des règnes suivants sculptés pour Toutânkhamon, Aÿ ou même Horemheb et que l'on a retrouvés dans leurs tombes de la vallée des Rois. La différence majeure réside évidemment dans les cartouches aux noms du roi et du dieu Aton, et surtout dans le fait que les quatre personnages féminins qui étendent leurs ailes protectrices autour du sarcophage ne sont pas les déesses prophylactiques classiques que l'on retrouvera ultérieurement, mais bien quatre représentations de Néfertiti personnifiée en Sothis, l'étoile qui dans la mythologie égyptienne assurait l'éternel retour de l'inondation annuelle lors de son lever héliaque. Ce dernier détail démontre que la réforme religieuse avait atteint tous les domaines, y compris celui de la résurrection, apanage du dieu Osiris. Akhenaton en garda par ailleurs les symboles et les rites principaux dont celui de la momification, ce qu'attestent les restes d'un coffret à canopes ou les ouchebtis retrouvés dans l'hypogée royal, mais là encore de même que pour la personne du roi, la solarisation avait fait son œuvre, et Pharaon était complètement assimilé au dieu Soleil même dans son tombeau.\n\nL'architecture de l'hypogée en est une autre preuve. Il fut conçu sur un plan rectiligne faisant face à l'est afin de recevoir les rayons solaires qui théoriquement auraient pu pénétrer au plus profond du caveau. L'emplacement même de la nécropole achève la démonstration. Il fut choisi non plus à l'ouest, dans le domaine traditionnel d'Osiris, mais à l'est de la ville, dans un ouadi qui, depuis la ville, apparait entre deux collines au milieu desquelles se lève chaque matin le soleil, l'astre divin que Pharaon à sa mort rejoindra pour l'éternité. Ainsi Akhenaton revenait à la vie chaque matin, à chaque nouvelle aube. La révolution religieuse avait donc bien eu lieu jusque dans l'interprétation du mythe de la résurrection et cet ultime acte de foi, entre autres, fut sans doute à l'origine de la haine que le pharaon attira sur lui après sa disparition, lorsque ses successeurs seront incapables de résister aux pressions des clergés des grands dieux ancestraux du pays, dont celui d'Osiris en Abydos.\n\nAutre particularité de cet hypogée : juste avant la salle du sarcophage se trouvent deux galeries latérales dont l'une mène à deux autres chambres, elles aussi inachevées, mais dont le décor est pour le moins insolite dans une tombe royale. Les murs sont en effet décorés de scènes de deuil où l'on voit Pharaon et sa reine pleurer Mâkhétaton une de leurs filles morte autour de la 12e année du règne. Il s'agit d'un témoignage unique en son genre, nous livrant un des aspects les plus touchants du règne d'Akhenaton. Après l'an XII, des décès successifs endeuillèrent la famille royale et entamèrent l'extinction de la lignée royale. Mâkhétaton mourut probablement en couches, car on peut distinguer sur le registre inférieur une servante quittant la salle où repose la défunte et emportant un nourrisson dans ses bras, alors que toute l'assistance semble éplorée, ce qui donne à la scène une intensité dramatique.\nAkhenaton voulut probablement que ses filles fussent enterrées avec lui et transforma ainsi son hypogée en un caveau familial. L'autre galerie aurait été prévue pour la reine Néfertiti, mais cette hypothèse reste à confirmer.\nÀ proximité de la tombe royale d'autres hypogées avaient commencé à être aménagés, mais ils ne furent jamais achevés. Ils étaient probablement destinés aux autres membres de la cour royale.\n\nLe village des artisans\nÀ proximité de la nécropole sud, les archéologues ont déblayé un village des artisans de Tell el-Amarna où les artisans vivaient avec leurs familles : une soixantaine de maisons construites en briques d'argile, comprenant  quatre pièces, et sans doute peu confortables. Tout comme Deir el-Médineh, le village était entouré d'un mur d'enceinte percé d'une seule porte, moins pour séquestrer les artisans que pour empêcher les détournements de matériaux. Cependant à la différence de la ville royale, et même de l'exemple thébain, le village des artisans d'Akhetaton fut conçu sur un plan urbanistique bien déterminé, avec des rues se coupant à angle droit et des habitations aux proportions standardisées. En cela ce village rappelle l'exemple d'une ville de pyramide du Moyen Empire découverte à Kahun à l'entrée de l'oasis du Fayoum, à proximité d'El-Lahoun, où Sésostris II avait fait édifier son complexe funéraire.\n\nL'art amarnien\nL'art amarnien est unique, de par sa période « expressionniste » (par comparaison - abusive, mais faute de mieux - avec certaines œuvres des artistes expressionnistes allemands), puis son naturalisme, tous deux fondés sur les mêmes motivations spirituelles. Ces formes artistiques et ces pratiques artistiques semblent en rupture radicale avec l'art égyptien qui avait précédé, au Moyen Empire - quoique Sésostris III pose déjà problème -, puis avec des personnalités fortes comme la reine Hatchepsout et le roi Thoutmôsis III. Cependant cette « révolution amarnienne » qui commence à Thèbes, a été très clairement annoncée sous Amenhotep III et la reine Tiyi. \nLes scènes représentées s'écartent totalement des sujets traditionnels de la religion égyptienne centrée autour du culte d'Amon, des images de la monarchie égyptienne en figurant, par exemple, la famille royale avec ses enfants. Cependant de telles images, la famille royale, sont restées longtemps l'objet d'interprétations anachroniques. Une meilleure connaissance de cette période, au cours des vingt dernières années, a permis d'écarter bien des erreurs. Plusieurs grandes expositions, mais aussi des fouilles archéologiques ont pu faire avancer considérablement l'état de ces connaissances. \nDes objets typiques de l'époque amarnienne ont été découverts dans des régions éloignées de l’Égypte comme dans la région palestinienne.\nAprès la fin de l'expérience amarnienne, l'art égyptien retourna à l'iconographie et, progressivement, au style traditionnel.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\n(en) Dorothea Arnold, The Royal women of Amarna : images of beauty from Ancient Egypt, New York (N.Y.), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Abrams, 1996, 169 p., 29 cm.

      "summary": "Amarna (Tell el-Amarna ou el-Amarna) est le site archéologique des ruines d'Akhetaton, la capitale construite par le pharaon Akhenaton aux alentours de -1360. \nLe nom arabe de Tell el-Amarna est sans doute la contraction des noms du village actuel, el-Till, et d'une tribu nomade, les Beni Amran, qui quittèrent le désert au XVIIIe siècle pour s'installer sur les bords du Nil. Akhetaton signifie « L'Horizon d'Aton » en égyptien ancien. \nÀ cet endroit, situé entre Thèbes et Memphis, les hautes falaises de la chaîne Arabique qui se dressent sur la rive droite du Nil s'écartent du fleuve pour former un hémicycle de douze kilomètres de longueur ; c'est là qu'en l'an 4 de son règne (vers -1360) Akhenaton jeta les fondations de la cité qui sera la capitale de l'empire égyptien pendant un quart de siècle. La ville, dédiée au culte du dieu unique Aton, fut élevée rapidement en briques crues et en talatates ; quatre ans après sa fondation, elle était déjà habitée par une population nombreuse qu'on estime à vingt mille personnes au moins. Des stèles frontières délimitèrent le territoire de la ville. Sur l'une d'entre elles, le roi proclame qu'Aton lui-même avait choisi cet emplacement parce qu'il était vierge de la présence de toute autre divinité. Lorsque Toutânkhamon quitta Akhetaton pour retourner à Thèbes, la cité fut laissée à l'abandon, puis démantelée par les successeurs d'Akhenaton et recouverte par les sables. \nAkhetaton est la seule ville de l'Égypte antique dont nous ayons une connaissance détaillée, notamment à cause du fait qu'elle fut désertée peu de temps après la mort d'Akhenaton, pour ne plus jamais être occupée. Cependant, en raison de son caractère exceptionnel et des conditions dans lesquelles la ville fut fondée puis abandonnée, il est difficile de savoir dans quelle mesure « L'Horizon d'Aton » était représentatif de l'urbanisme égyptien.",

      "content": "## Overview\nAmarna (el-Amarna) is a significant archaeological location in Middle Egypt, in the modern Egyptian province of el-Minya. Amarna sits between the east bank of the river Nile and the high plateau of the Eastern Desert, some 58 km (36 mi) south of Minya, 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor and 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\n## Understand\nThe diverse and scattered archaeological sites at Amarna represent the remains of the short-lived capital of Akhenaten, the \"heretic\" Pharaoh of the late 18th Dynasty.\nAmarna has, since 1982, been the target of nearly annual archaeological excavations by a team from the University of Cambridge, England.\n\n## Get in\nRoad and rail links with Amarma are accessible only on the opposite (west) bank of the Nile, making a river crossing necessary (an eastern access by a feeder road from the Cairo-Asyut desert highway is reportedly planned).\nFor the northern and central parts of Amarna (including the North Tombs), the tourist ferry to 27.66050130.895781 el-Till should be used. This can be reached by tourist car/taxi from Mallawi (which has a railway station) or from Minya. Vehicles are available for hire at el-Till. This is the usual means of tourist access.\nFor the South Tombs the ferry to el-Hagg Qandil is an alternative, if perhaps somewhat risky. This is accessible by vehicle from Deir Mawas, along the road which passes the village of Beni Amran. From Deir Mawas to the ferry the distance is about 1.75 km (just over one mile). Deir Mawas also has a local railway station. Transport is far less likely to be available for hire from el-Hagg Qandil.\nBecause of security issues, foreign visitors are escorted around the site by representatives of the Tourist Police who are based at the el-Till ferry. For this reason, use of the el-Hagg Qandil ferry by foreigners is discouraged. If you take this route, you may be escorted to el-Till or be taken back to the train stations at Mallawi or Minya.\n\n## Get around\nEl-Till ferry to the North Tombs: 3.2 km (2 mi); el-Till ferry to the North Palace: 2 km (1 1/4 mi); el-Till ferry to the Central City: 2 km (1 1/4 mi); North to South Tombs: 5.6 km (3 1/2 mi); el-Till ferry to the Royal Tomb: 11 km (7 mi).\n\n## See\n27.6730.9033331 Northern Palace.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64926630.8975092 the Great Aten Temple.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64519330.8946443 the Small Aten Temple.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.66163330.9268694 the Northern Tombs.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.64560730.9381095 the Southern Tombs.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.626230.98526 Royal Tomb of Akhenaten.      (updated Aug 2020)\n27.633330.91677 Workmen's Village. It housed the workers who constructed and decorated the tombs of the city's elite, making it comparable to the better studied Theban workers village of Deir el-Medina.   (updated Aug 2020)\nUsual tourist itineraries: from el-Till to the Northern tombs, nos. 3-6 (1 and 2 require an extra excursion), returning to el-Till via a detour to the Northern Palace. The Central City can be added as a further detour. This can be accomplished in half a day or less. The Royal Tomb can be reached by an extension to the asphalt road, in a 30-min drive from the Northern Tombs. A much longer excursion can be taken to the Southern Tombs, along the road beside the cultivation, which passes through much of the ancient city. The greater part of a day should be allowed for this extended trip.\n\n## Eat and drink\nThere is a small, privately-run tourist kiosk with toilets at the foot of the slope beneath the North Tombs. A second has been built below the South Tombs but is reportedly not yet in operation. Prudence would suggest that you bring food and water with you (and maybe some toilet tissue as well!)\n\n## Sleep\nThere are no accommodation options at the site of Amarna. Travellers are generally advised to seek accommodation in one of the nearby cities of Mallawi or Minya.",
