This northern side is the direction from which the city opens up to the coastal regions in the area of Al-Batinah (including Al-Musannah and Al-Suwayq), which is the most active and important vital passage in the region. It is also considered a link connecting the city to the Omani capital, Muscat, which is only 160 km away. Rustaq is also distinguished by its rocky and sandy desert environment in the northeastern direction.\n\nClimate\nHistory\nDuring the days of the Sasanian Empire, Al-Rustaq had a Persian marzban (military governor), whom Sasanians in the area would report to. Dibba and Tuwwam, which Oman today shares with the U.A.E., were taxed by Al-Julanda, who were clients of the Sasanians. There are also historical mosques in Rustaq, including Al-Bayada Mosque, the Basra Mosque, and the Qasra Mosque.\n\nRustaq Castle\nRustaq Fort, built four centuries prior to the 7th century C.E., is an imposing structure built on three levels, containing separate houses, an armoury, a mosque and four towers.
