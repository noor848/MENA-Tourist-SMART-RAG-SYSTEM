      "content": "Salalah (Arabic: صَلَالَة, romanized: Ṣalālah) is the capital and largest city of the southern Omani governorate of Dhofar. It has a population close to 331,949.\nSalalah is the third-largest city in the Sultanate of Oman, and the largest city in the Dhofar province. Salalah is the birthplace of former Omani Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Salalah attracts many tourists from other parts of Oman and from abroad during the monsoon/khareef season, from June to September. The climate of the region and the monsoon allow the city to grow some vegetables and fruits like coconut and bananas. There are many gardens within the city where these vegetables and fruits grow.\n\nHistory\nSalalah currently is and was the traditional capital of Dhofar, which reached the peak of prosperity in the 13th century thanks to the incense trade. Later it decayed, and in the 19th century it was absorbed by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.\nBetween 1932 and 1970, Salalah was the residence of Sultan Said bin Taimur. His son, Qaboos, who acceded to his father's throne in 1970, decided to move his capital to Muscat, the largest city in Oman, where he lived until he quietly left for treatment in Germany. Sultan Qaboos's absence was much regretted in Salalah, where his palace was always kept ready to receive him. His last visits were in 2006 to meet influential tribal and local leaders, and in 2010 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his accession with a massive parade watched for several hours by an estimated 100,000 spectators.\nDespite the Sultan's generally benevolent government running Oman without national taxation, thanks to its vast mineral resources, and with all menial work done by Asian labourers, Salalah saw peaceful protests for a few months in 2011 in the domino effect of the Arab Spring. Some Omani protesters demanded the dismissal of current ministers, better job opportunities, salary increases, a solution to the increasing cost of living, or the establishment of Islamic banks.\n\nDemographics\nReligion\nThe city, like many other in Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula, has a relatively large expatriate community, mainly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.\nThe majority of the Omani population (98.9%) in Salalah is Muslim. Unlike Omanis on the eastern coast of Oman in and around Muscat, most of whom are Ibadis, most Muslims in Salalah follow the Sunni sect of Islam. There is also a considerable population of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs in the expatriate community.\n\nLanguage\nArabic is the official language. The unofficial, unwritten non-Arabic language known as Shehri is the second most spoken language and the mother tongue of many in Salalah and its surrounding areas, with 25,000 estimated speakers as of 1993.\nEnglish is the official foreign language and the most spoken language of the expats. Malayalam is another popular language and together with Tamil, Telugu, along with Urdu, Hindi, European Spanish, Catalan, Romanian and Somali are widely spoken language among expatriates.\n\nEconomy\nAPM Terminals, part of the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group of Denmark, manages the Port of Salalah; one of the largest ports on the Arabian Peninsula which is an important transshipment hub for container shipping in the area. The Port of Salalah is also one of the most vital ports on the peninsula connecting together Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. But the port is outside the city, to the south. It is also the largest private employer in the Dhofar region. The Salalah Free Zone, situated right beside the port, is emerging as a new center for heavy industries in the Middle East.\n\nTourism\nSalalah has an international tourist economy with many Middle Eastern tourists during the Khareef season from June to September. In this season the mountains turn green, and there are many waterfalls to visit, such as at Wadi Darbat, Ain Athum, Ain Tubrook, and Ain Khor. There are four reputed tombs of Islamic prophets: Nabi Imran, possibly the Virgin Mary's father but more likely a local prophet; Nabi Ayoob, the biblical Job; Nabi Houd; and Nabi Salih. The city received more than 600,000 tourists during the khareef season in 2017. Amongst the Dhofar Governorate's cultural attractions is the Salalah carnival, which includes the usual rides, family activities, concerts, cultural events and vendors.\nOne of Joachim's or Al Imran's believed graves is in Salalah; which is claimed to be the \"longest grave in the world\" (12 metres).\n\nClimate\nThe city has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), although summers are cooler than in more northern or inland parts of Oman. Salalah is very cloudy and foggy during the monsoon months of July and August, even though it receives relatively little rainfall. Khareef, خريف means \"autumn\" in Arabic, but it refers to monsoon when describing the region around Salalah. During this time, the brown landscape of Salalah and its surroundings are completely transformed to beautiful and lush green scenes. This provides picturesque scenes for photos. \nCyclone Mekunu, which originated over the Arabian Sea, became an extremely severe cyclone before hitting the Salalah city on 25 May 2018. 200 km/h was the recorded windspeed, and the city of Salalah was pounded with over 617 mm (24.3 in) of rainfall, which is almost 5 years of Oman's average rainfall.\n\nSports\nSalalah is known as the home of some of the best football clubs in Oman. In total, Salalah has four sport clubs based in the city: Salalah Club, Al-Ittihad, Al-Nasr, and Dhofar (the most successful club in the League with 11 trophies).\nDhofar F.C. have been nicknamed as \"Al-Zaeem\", or \"The Leader(s)\", due to their enormous success in both the Omani League, and in the Sultan Qaboos Cup.  Dhofar also have an adequate number of trophies in sports like volleyball, and handball. Al-Nasr have also been known for their great success in football, winning the Omani League five times, and the Sultan Qaboos Cup 4 times. Al-Nasr, like Dhofar, have also been successful in other sports such as hockey, basketball, volleyball, and handball.\nSalalah currently has two stadiums, the Salalah Sports Complex (also known as the \"Youth Sports Complex\"), which is the only multi-purpose stadium in Salalah.  The newer, Al-Saadah Stadium is the newly built stadium in Al-Saada district of Salalah devoted to football.  Incorporated in the walls of the sports complex apart from the football stadium is a hockey field, tennis court, Olympic swimming pool, and indoor volleyball/basketball court. Al-Saada Stadium is the venue where Saudi national football team, and the Omani national team first met in Salalah on August 12, 2009.\nThe most popular sport played among the youth is by far football. It is very normal to see a group of boys and young men from around the area playing in makeshift fields in parking lots, or in a large open area. Beach football is also a common sight to see along the beach in the Al-Haffa district. Another popular sport in Salalah is volleyball. Although not as popular as football the game is frequently played, special in the beach of Salalah.\nIn December 2026, Salalah will host the finish of the Budapest–Baghdad–Salalah Rally, a transcontinental endurance rally spanning over 10,000 kilometers. The route starts in Budapest and passes through numerous countries across Europe and the Middle East – including Iraq and Saudi Arabia – before reaching its final destination in southern Oman. The event is a unique blend of adventure travel and motorsport, where participants compete or tour in various vehicle categories such as motorcycles, cars, quads, and side-by-sides. Designed in the spirit of minimalist assistance, the rally combines challenging navigation with cultural interaction, aiming to showcase the natural beauty and hospitality of the regions along the route. Salalah, as the endpoint, plays a symbolic and celebratory role, highlighting its geographical and cultural significance.\n\nEducation\nCurrently Salalah has two colleges, the Salalah College of Technology and Salalah College of Applied Science, both of which are government owned and sponsored.\nThe Salalah College of Applied Sciences incorporates an English Department. Its aim is to offer students a solid grasp of the English language so that they may go on to complete further studies in important sectors such as I.T. and Communication and Design.\nSalalah is also home to a private university, Dhofar University which is one of the largest in the region. It has significant shares owned by Mustahil Al-Mashani, uncle of Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Recently the university has constructed a new campus worth 25 million OR.\nBritish School Salalah was founded in 1970. The school follows the National Curriculum of England and Wales, and offers schooling to children from Reception to Year 10 (Year 11 from August 2021). It is also situated in Dahariz next to the Indian School and Pakistani School.\nThe Indian School Salalah, established in 1981, is an Indian-run, self-financing, co-educational institution, primarily established to meet the academic needs of children of Indian expatriates working in Salalah.\n\nTransportation\nAir transport\nSalalah International Airport mainly caters to domestic flights from Muscat and some International flights from India and regional Arab countries such as Qatar, U.A.E, and Saudi Arabia. Oman Air, the national airline operates five flights daily from Salalah to Muscat, the capital city and also two flights to Dubai weekly.\nOman Air introduced Oman Air Pass for regular travelers between Salalah and Muscat. Qatar Airways has daily flights from Salalah to Doha connecting to over 130 destinations worldwide.\nVery convenient connections are available to destinations in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. There is also a direct weekly flight from and to Kochi, Kozhikode (Calicut) for the Malayalee expatriates. During the Khareef Season (Monsoons) there are weekly flights to other international destinations including Sweden and Turkey. There are also transit flights to almost all countries.\nThe new International airport opened on 15 June 2015 and the old Airport has since then been converted into a Domestic and emergency Airport.\n\nBus\nThere is a daily bus service from Deira, Dubai, UAE to Salalah at 3pm. There is daily bus service between Muscat and Salalah from many bus service providers.\n\nPublic transport\nSalalah did not have a public transportation system within the city limits until 2018, but in 2019 Sultan Qaboos announced a bus service within the city from Salalah airport to city center and city center to Salalah port.\nOman National Transport Company (Mwasalat) has started daily public bus service in Salalah from December 2018.\nLong-distance air-conditioned buses are operated daily from Salalah to Haima, Muscat, Nizwa, Al-Buraimi, Dubai, Al-Ain, Al-Ghaydah, Mukalla, and Seiyun, as well as PDO locations such as Marmul.\nOther forms of public transport popular in Salalah are taxis. Generally fares vary from half a Rial to 2 Rials depending on the distance to destination. Taxis are color-coded orange and white and provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baisa buses, which are not as popular in the city.\nMinibuses, colour-coded orange and white, are unmetered like taxis, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of negotiation, although drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi.\n\nWater transport\nThe Port of Salalah is one of the deepwater ports in Oman and also eleventh-busiest transshipment port in the world, second-busiest port in the Middle East, which is located at Port Raysut (Salalah). It can accommodate large vessels up to 18m draft. It is the main container tran-shipment terminal of the region. This port is operated and managed by Salalah Port Services Company (S.A.O.G.). The port also welcomes cruise liners and luxury ships.\n\nCity districts and suburbs\nAl-Dahariz\nAl-Haffa\nAl-Qouf\nAl-Mughsail\nAl-Mutaaza\nAl-Saada\nAl-Wadi\nAuqad\nCity Center\nEastern Salalah\nIttin\nNew Salalah (Salalah Al-Jadidah)\nWestern Salalah (also known as Al-Gharbia, and Al-Qantra)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nBountiful (Book of Mormon)#Salalah\nDuqm\nList of cities in Oman\nMuseum of the Land of Frankincense\nOkkad\nOwtar\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nBeautiful Salalah\nSalalah - City of the Prophets\nPort of Salalah",

      "content": "## Overview\nSalalah is the capital city of Oman's southern Dhofar region. It is the second largest city in the Sultanate, and has the distinction of being the Sultan Qaboos' birthplace. For most visitors, Salalah is the gateway to Oman’s most southerly governate of Dhofar – a historically independent, and culturally and ecologically unique region.\n\n## Understand\nAs the traditional regional capital, the city’s history stretches back two millennia, when, thanks to its strategic location, it was an important stop on the frankincense and silk trading routes. In the 19th century the region was incorporated into the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and Salalah served as the country’s capital from 1932 until the accession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970, who relocated the capital to Muscat. Salalah was the Sultan’s birthplace in 1940, and his mother was a member of a prominent regional Jebbali tribe; to this day the Sultan maintains close ties to the city.\nToday Salalah is still known for the cultivation and trade of frankincense (albeit now on a smaller scale), and is famous for its summer khareef (monsoon) and annual Salalah Festival, when visitors flock to the region to escape the blazing hot temperatures elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula. As lodging and eating establishments outside the city are scarce, it serves as a useful and interesting base for travellers wanting to explore the wider area at any time of year.\n\n## Read\nMaria Dekeersmaeker, The DNA of Salalah, Dhofar: A Tourist Guide. Written by a Belgian journalist based in Salalah, this unusual book is a treasure trove of facts and history, organized thematically.\n\n## Climate\nMost visitors come to Salalah during July and August to enjoy the annual khareef, when the nearby wadis are full of water. Occasionally streets flood, and ocean currents are too strong for swimming or diving. The crowds leave in September along with the rains, but the vegetation is still green, and hotel prices have started to come down.\nDiving is only possible during the dry season, from October to the end of May, and this is also the optimal time for bird watching. May and especially June are the hottest months of the year, with humidity steadily increasing until the rains bring relief again in late June or early July.\n\n## By plane\nOman Air. Flies from Muscat to Salalah at least three times a day, with a flight time of 1hr 30min. Operates direct international flights from Dubai W-Sa, with a flight time of some two hours, as well as to Jeddah Th and Sa, with a flight time of 2hr 50min.\nAir Arabia. Flies from Sharjah on Su M W Th, with a flight time 1hr 45min.\nQatar Airways. Operates direct flights from Doha 3 times daily, with a flight time of 2hr 10min.\nBeware, the taxi from the airport is 10 or 20 times the normal taxi rate.\n\n## By car\nIf you hire a car, 2WD cars are adequate for most sights within Salalah itself. Outside of Salalah, however, many places of tourist interest lie off road, and SUVs are recommended particularly during the khareef season because of slippery terrain. Book your car well in advance if you plan to visit during this peak period, as rental agencies often run out of vehicles.\n\n## By bus\n17.01887454.0984151 ONTC Bus Station (next to the New Souq / Central Market), ☏ +968 23 292773, fax: +968 23 202721, info@ontcoman.com.

Shuttle buses transport visitors from the ship to the port entrance, and taxis are also available. Visitors need to bring only their cruise boarding pass and their Tourist Entry Permit.\n\n## On foot\nIt is possible to explore parts of Salalah on foot, as most places of interest are close to each other. During warmer times of year, though, walking may not be the best idea.\n\n## By taxi\nThe usual unmetered Omani taxis operate here. Negotiate the price before getting in. In 2021, a ride within the city was 1 rial. Most of the time, regular taxis were cheaper than the ride-hailing app Otaxi, but the app can be used to estimate a price.\n\n## See\nThe old city is confined to the area called Al Haffa (Hafah), on the seafront.\n17.00692954.1324331 Al Baleed Archeological Park, As Sultan Qaboos St, ☏ +968 23 303577, incense@omantel.net.om.

Old rooms, basic but decent. Very close to the airport and in the centre of the city so it's easy to reach any place you want to get to, reasonable swimming pool, gym and tennis courts. Banking and rent a car services are available in the same building.    (updated Oct 2017)\n17.01887154.0596835 Hamdan Plaza Hotel, Al Wadi St (across from Lulu Hypermarket), ☏ +968 23 211025. Free breakfast with wi-fi.\n\n## Splurge\n17.00881754.1512866 Crowne Plaza Resort Salalah, Dahreej, ☏ +968 23 235333. Check-in: 2PM, check-out: noon. A better alternative for luxury accommodation as the property is much larger than the Hilton and more importantly it is close to the city centre. RO 72+/night.\n16.98136154.0153847 Hilton Salalah, As Sultan Qaboos St, ☏ +968 23 211234, fax: +968 23 210084. Check-in: 2PM, check-out: noon. A popular choice for European visitors. It is roughly 12 km outside the city and runs a daily shuttle service to and from the Gold Souq. However, the hotel cannot really be recommended as the service is appalling and a general sense of \"the inmates running the asylum\" pervades. RO 59+/night.\n17.03146454.2997178 Juweira Boutique Hotel, Taqa Rd (Marina Town), ☏ +968 23 239600, fax: +968 23 239622.

(updated Jan 2017)\n\n## Drink\nAlcohol for non-Muslim visitors is available at high end hotels like Oasis Club near the port, as well as at the bars in the Crowne Plaza, Hilton, and Juweira Boutique hotels.\nFor a refreshing drink, stop at any of the many roadside vendors selling fresh coconut. They will lop the top off a green coconut for you for 200-300 baizas.\n\n## Sleep\nDuring the annual khareef from July-September the population of Salalah balloons with visitors from elsewhere in Oman and the Persian Gulf, so if you plan to visit during this time it is essential to make reservations well in advance. During other times of year rooms are plentiful and rates are more reasonable.\n\n## Connect\nMobile coverage using Oman's providers is close to flawless, but roaming can sometimes be slow. There are several internet cafes around town, but speeds are inconsistent. Prices vary, but are usually cheap. You can also buy a tourist SIM card from any of the two main phone companies.\n\n## Stay safe\nSalalah is a very safe place. However, the Salalah (Arab) way of driving might need some getting used to for non-Arabs.\nDon't go swimming in the sea or permit toddlers/children to wander off at beaches. The sea has very strong ocean currents and the seabed has a steep drop off, making it very unsafe for swimmers, experienced or beginner.\n\n## Cope\nRemember to carry your passport and visa papers with you wherever you go, at least photocopies, as you can expect local police or military patrols to check on you when you least expect them to show up, even if you are within city limits (a routine procedure to check for illegal workers and immigrants).\nIt's advisable for women to bring conservative clothing, especially if travelling outside the city. A general rule is to keep shoulders and knees covered. Western swimwear is acceptable on private hotel beaches, but not on public beaches where one-piece suits, or even t-shirts and swimming shorts, are preferable. Keep a sarong handy.\nBring plenty of water and sunblock if travelling outside the city.\n\n## North\n17.11190253.99384811 Job's Tomb (An-Nabi Ayyub) (30km northwest of Salalah off of Atin Rd). Believed by many to be the tomb of the biblical figure Job, on a hilltop overlooking Salalah. There is a small restaurant nearby with wonderful views. 500 bzs.\n17.12882654.23558412 Ayn Razat (Ain Razat). Th-F, daily during the khareef. Freshwater springs surrounded by gated rose gardens, with several pools and caves nearby. Swimming is not permitted because of the presence of schistosomiasis (bilharzia); toilets available.     (updated Aug 2017)\n\n## East\nTaqah coastal city is 35km away on Highway 49, and Mirbat also on the coast is an hour's drive.\n\n## West\nTo the west is Mughsayl with its famous blowholes, and some dramatic coastline (see Itineraries in Dhofar).",
