      "content": "## Overview\nSur is a city in Central Coastal Oman, best known for its dhow shipyards.\n\n## Understand\nSur was founded in the 6th century CE as a trading port and has a long history of ship building, continuing to the present day. In addition to being an interesting destination in its own right, it makes a good base for day trips to Wadi Shab, Wadi Tiwi, and Ras al-Jinz turtle reserve established  in 2008, all described in Central Coastal Oman.\n\n## Read\nTim Severin, The Sindbad Voyage. In 1980 Severin and a crew of Omanis – including several from Sur – sailed in a traditional dhow from Muscat to Guangzhou, China, in an effort to recreate the legendary voyages of Sindbad. The dhow was built in Sur by Omani and Indian shipwrights using completely traditional materials and techniques, described at length by the author.\n\n## Get in\nThere is no airport in Sur. Although one was in the works several years ago, the project has since been abandoned due to the expected increased frequency of cyclones.\nSur is a 2.5-hour drive south of Muscat, off of Highway 17. A taxi from the Rusayl Roundabout will cost about RO 25 (shared RO 5). Microbuses cost RO 3 and travel inland via Highway 23, passing Ibra.\n22.56825259.5250011 Mwasalat (ONTC) (near Sur Souq), ☏ +968 25 540019, info@mwasalat.om. Runs daily buses to and from Muscat (4 hrs 15 min) along Highway 23 via Ibra.\n\n## Get around\nThere is no public transportation in Sur beside taxis, which charge 150 Bzs for any ride within Sur.\n\n## See\n22.56178759.5368691 Dhow shipyard (near the suspension bridge to Al Ayjah). Sur is where authentic dhows are still built in the traditional fashion. NOTE: the locals don't call them \"dhows\" but rather safeena (ship) or suh-fin (ships). If you say \"dhow,\" they'll be perplexed.\n22.56117859.5311992 Fatih Al-Khair (Dhow Museum). If you are an enthusiast of hand-made wooden boats and ships, this is definitely worth a visit. Several old dhows are on display, the largest of which is the Fatih Al-Khair, built in Sur 150 years ago and now beautifully restored.\n22.57940259.5040653 Sunaysilah Fort (Sinaysla Fort) (off of Hwy 23 near Roundabout 3). Sa-Th 8:30am-2:30pm. If the \"natour\" (guardian) isn't there, just walk up to the fort itself and he'll see you, come sell you a ticket and then sit in the entrance hall while you look around the displays. It is possible to climb all four towers which offer great views of the town. Don't expect much in the way of history or signs. 500 Bzs.\n22.5539359.4887664 Bilad Sur Fort (Bilad Sur Castle) (off of Hwy 23 near Roundabout 1). Built 200 years ago, the fortress is closed for renovation.\n22.56517659.5431655 Al Hamooda Fort (Al Ayjah Fort) (Al Ayjah).

Daily in the morning. Visitors can watch fishermen unload and sell the catch of the day.\n22.56987259.5318159 Corniche (boardwalk). A pleasant seaside promenade.\n\n## Buy\n22.56970859.5239141 Souq. Visitors may find the souq disappointing, as it is filled with everyday Chinese-made goods and Indian-made khangars (daggers).\nDhow models (in a shed at the shipyard). Erratic opening hours. Dhow models of various sizes, made by the shipwrights, are for sale.\n\n## Eat\nSur has several decent restaurants but no five-star menus.\nBawadi Al Ayga (in the souq, near Nadi Sur Sports Club). Indian restaurant. A lot of the locals know it but everyone knows where Nadi Sur is so just take a taxi there.

Indian restaurant, with food about the same quality as Bawadi but slightly more expensive. They also have \"Chinese\" food. The ambiance is extremely noisy. Staff are friendly, and a couple of them speak English. Many Omanis come here with their families, there is a family section in the back of the restaurant.\n22.59517759.4939432 Sur Beach Hotel Restaurant, Al Murtefeh (near the beach). Food is okay, not great and a touch more expensive than Spicy Village.\n\n## Sleep\n22.56116859.5409891 Al Ayjah Plaza Hotel, Al Ayjah, ☏ +968 25 544433.
