It is only about 600 m away from the sea, between the coastal towns of Ḑibāb and Bamah (Bimmah). The sinkhole was formed by a collapse of the surface layer due to dissolution of the underlying limestone. However, locals used to believe this sinkhole in the shape of a water well was created by a meteorite, hence the Arabic name Hawiyyat Najm which means \"the deep well of the (falling) star\".\nBimmah Sinkhole ranges in depth from only a few feet to over 300+ feet in the deepest part.\n\nGallery\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",
