      "content": "Lifta (Arabic: لفتا; Hebrew: ליפתא) was a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled by Zionist paramilitary forces during the 1948 Palestine war.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the village was recorded to have a population of 400 Arabs, all Muslim households. In 1834, a battle took place in the village during the Palestinian Peasants' Revolt. A British 1922 census registered Lifta's population at 1,451, all Muslims.\nPrior to 1948, the village had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. In the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians. In addition, a small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian Arab majority as 'excellent'.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine war, a massacre occurred on 28 December 1947, when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on a cafe in Lifa. The mukhtar's home was also incinerated by the Zionist forces and 20 buildings were blown up as the village was put under siege. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled, and the abandoned village was later repopulated by Jewish immigrants until the 1970s. In July 2017, Israel declared Lifta (called Mei Neftoach) as a national nature reserve. It has been referred to as the \"Palestinian Pompeii\".\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nA perennial spring located in the channel's upper section is believed to be the site where the village first developed. Surrounding this spring, artifacts including a burial cave and pottery shards from the Middle Bronze Age II and Iron Age II periods were uncovered.\nArchaeological remains dating as far back as Iron Age II have been found in the village.\n\nBiblical identification\nThe site is considered by some to be identical with biblical Hebrew: מי נפתוח Mei Neftoach. It was populated since ancient times; \"Nephtoah\" (Hebrew: נפתח, lit. spring of the corridor) is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the border between the Israelite tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and was the northernmost demarcation point of the territory of the Tribe of Judah. Other scholars hold the identification to be plausible but by no means certain. Kitchener and Conder found the identification with Nephtoah unsatisfactory, and preferred to identify Lifta with Eleph of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28).\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nThe Romans and Byzantines called it Nephtho, and the Crusaders referred to it as Clepsta.\n\nCrusader period\nThe remains of a court-yard home from the Crusader period remains in the centre of the village.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596, Lifta was a village in the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Jerusalem under the liwa' (district) of Jerusalem, and it had a population 72 Muslim households, an estimated  396 persons. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, fruit orchards and vineyards; a total of 4,800  akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1834, a battle took place here, during the revolt of that year. The Egyptian Ibrahim Pasha and his army fought and defeated local rebels, led by Shaykh Qasim al-Ahmad, a prominent local ruler. However, the Qasim al-Ahmad family remained powerful and ruled the region southwest of Nablus from their fortified villages of Deir Istiya and Bayt Wazan some 40 kilometers (25 mi) due north of Lifta. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted  Lifta  as a Muslim village, located in the Beni Malik area, west of Jerusalem. Robinson hired muleteers from Lifta, noting that in Lifta \"every peasant keeps his mule and usually accompanies it\".\nIn 1863 Victor Guérin described Lifta as being surrounded by gardens of lemon-trees, oranges, figs, pomegranates, alms and apricots. An Ottoman village list of about 1870 indicated 117 houses and a population of 395, though the population count included men, only.\nThe PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described it as a village on the side of a steep hill, with a spring and rock-cut tombs to the south.\nIn 1896 the population of Lifta was estimated to be about 966 persons.\nIn 1907 the German historian Gustav Rothstein was invited to Lifta by his Arabic language teacher, Elias Nasrallah Haddad. Rothstein wrote a 20-pages article describing the marriage celebrations and religious festivals in Lifta.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nIn 1917, Lifta surrendered to the British forces with white flags and, as a symbolic gesture, the keys to the village.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, Lifta had a population 1,451, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census (when Lifta was counted with \"Shneller's Quarter\"), to 1,893; 1,844 Muslims, 35 Jews and 14 Christians, in a total of 410 houses.\nDuring the 1929 Palestine riots, according to one Israeli source, some villagers from Lifta were among gangs that  participated in a number of robberies and attacks on nearby Jewish communities.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians, and the total land area was 8,743 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. 3,248 dunams were for cereals, while 324 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nPrior to 1948, the village, with a population of some 2,500 people, had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. A small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian majority as 'excellent'.\n\n1948 war and depopulation\nIn the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Lifta, Romema, and Shaykh Badr which were strategically located on the road leaving Jerusalem to Tel-Aviv, were an operational priority for Jewish forces.  Some families had already left the village after a decision had been made  somewhat earlier on 4 December, to evacuate its women and children, in order to host a military company, and on 4 December 1947 some Arab families left. By mid-December irregular Arab militia took up positions in Lifta to defend the site. Hagannah patrols engaged in firefights with the village militiamen while Irgun and Lehi were even more aggressive. On 28 December 1947, the village suffered from what survivors called the Lifta massacre when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on the café of Salah Eisa. In order to warn residents that they should evacuate, the mukhtar's home was incinerated, and 20 buildings blown up as the village was put under siege. The attack left seven dead, and more women and children left the village. The village was suffering from food shortages in the beginning of January. Subsequently, a number of the villagers returned home, with Benny Morris reporting \"some, or most\" doing so. Subsequently, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, while visiting the village, ordered the women, children and elderly to evacuate and the men to stay put. On 29 January, a Lehi raid blew up 3 houses in the village. By early February the village was abandoned by the irregular militia. Benny Morris lists the cause of the depopulation of the village as being a military assault on the settlement.\nAccording to one resident, interviewed in 2021, there were are around 40,000 descendants of the original refugee population, dispersed in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan and the Palestinian diaspora. Several families still retain their Ottoman period property deeds, attesting to their ownership of parts of Lifta.\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the expulsion of its Palestinian villagers, of Lifta's 410 homes, 60 stone houses, some three stories high, remained, together with its  mosque, an olive press, and a tiled pathway to a spring. It is listed by Unesco as a potential World Heritage Site, and in 2018, the World Heritage Fund registered the village among a list of 24 heritage sites that were endangered.\nLifta was used for Jewish refugee housing during the war, and following the war the Jewish Agency and the state of Israel settled Jewish immigrants from Yemen and Kurdistan in the village, totaling 300 families. However ownership of the houses was not registered in their name. Living conditions in Lifta were difficult, the buildings were in poor repair, poor roads and transport, and lack of electricity, water, and sanitation infrastructure. In 1969-71 most of the Jewish inhabitants of Lifta chose to leave as part of a compensation program by Amidar. Holes were drilled in the roofs of the evacuated buildings to make them less inhabitable, so that squatters wouldn't take up residence. 13 families, who lived in the portion of the village close to Highway 1 and didn't suffer from transportation issues chose to remain.\nIn the 1980s, Lifta was declared a municipal nature reserve under the auspices of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.\nIn 1984, one of the abandoned buildings in the village was occupied by the \"Lifta gang\", a Jewish group plotting the blow up the mosques on the Temple Mount, who were stopped at the gates of the site with 250 pounds of explosives, hand grenades, and other armaments.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Jewish residents, some of the buildings in the village were used for Lifta drug abuse rehabilitation center for adolescents, which was closed in 2014, and from 1971 for the Lifta high school, an open education school, which relocated to German Colony, Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nIn 2011, plans were announced to demolish the village and build a luxury development consisting of 212 luxury housing units and a hotel. Former residents brought a legal petition to preserve the village as a historic site. Lifta was the last remaining Arab village that was depopulated to have not been either completely destroyed or re-inhabited.  In 2012, the  plans to rebuild the village as an upscale neighborhood were rejected by the Jerusalem District Court.\nBy 2011, three books about the Palestinian village history had been published.\nIn June 2017 the last Jewish residents left the village following a settlement with the government who acknowledged they were not squatters but rather resettled in Lifta by the appropriate authorities.\nIn July 2017 Mei Neftoach was declared a national nature reserve. 55 out of 450 pre-1948 stone houses are still standing.\nIn 2021, the Israel Land Administration, without informing beforehand the Jerusalem Municipality authorities,  announced on Jerusalem Day that it was reported to be preparing a tender for the  construction of a luxury neighborhood on the village's ruins, projected to consist of  259 villas, a hotel, and a mall. On 11 August 2022, the plan to demolish Lifta and build luxury housing was shelved, with new Jerusalem mayor Moshe Lion seeking to preserve the village of Lifta and transform it into a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The previous Mayor of Jerusalem, Israeli businessman and politician Nir Barkat, had initially approved the plan for Lifta's demolition before changing his mind, opposing the development plans after visiting the site. Currently, Lifta is still on the list of UNESCO's tentative World Heritage Sites.\n\nArchaeology\nIn 2010, an archaeological survey was conducted at Lifta by Mordechai Heiman on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).\n\nArab traditional dress\nLifta was among the wealthiest communities in the Jerusalem area, and the women were known for their fine embroidery Thob Ghabani bridal dresses were sewn in Lifta. They were made of ghabani, a natural cotton covered with gold color silk floral embroidery produced in Aleppo, and were narrower than other dresses. The sleeves were also more tapered. The sides, sleeves and chest panel of the dress were adorned with silk insets. The dresses were ordered by brides in Bethlehem. The married women of Lifta wore a distinctive conical shaṭweh head-dress, that was also worn in Bethlehem, Ayn Karim, Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\nNotable people\nRasmea Odeh\nYahya Hammuda\n\nSee also\nAli Abunimah\nList of modern names for biblical place names\nPalestinian costumes\nZochrot\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Lifta, palestineremembered.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, Zochrot\n[1], The Ruins of Lifta (2016)\nIsrael Antiquities Authority, Jerusalem, Lifta, Survey (2010)\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nLifta in Antiquity Archaeological Survey of Israel\nF.A.S.T.-Lifta Preservation Joint project on the reconstruction of memory and the preservation of Lifta, archive.org, 14 May 2006.\nLifta photos by Dr Moslih Kanaaneh, jalili48.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, by Rami Nashashibi (1996), Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society.\nLifta, zochrot.org\nReturn to Lifta, 13 May 2006, zochrot.org\nLifta Society website, liftasociety.org\nLifta website, schulen.eduhi.at\n3D models of different houses in Lifta, sketchfab.com; accessed 2 September 2015.",

      "content": "Lifta (لفتا; ליפתא) était un village palestinien situé aux alentours de Jérusalem, existant jusqu’à la fin de la Palestine mandataire. Ses habitants ont été expulsés par des milices paramilitaires sionistes pendant la guerre de 1948 en Palestine.\nÀ l’époque ottomane, le village avait 400 habitants, tous musulmans. En 1834, une bataille a lieu durant la révolte de Palestine. Lors du recensement britannique de 1922, 1451 habitants sont enregistrés, tous musulmans. Avant 1948, le village avait des vergers, des moulins à huile, un pressoir à vin, une clinique moderne, deux cafés, deux charpentiers, des salons de coiffure, un boucher et une mosquée. Dans les statistiques villageoises de 1945, la population est de 2250, dont 20 chrétiens. Quelques Juifs y habitaient, et un ancien habitant juif décrit les relations entre sa famille et la majorité arabe comme excellentes.\nPendant la guerre de 1948, un massacre a lieu le 28 décembre 1947, quand une milice paramilitaire juive attaque un café à la mitrailleuse et à la grenade. La maison du moukhtar est incendiée par les sionistes et 20 maisons démolies détruites. Les habitants arabes sont expulsés, et le village repeuplé par des immigrants juifs. En juillet 2017, Israël déclare Lifta (Mei Neftoach) réserve naturelle nationale. Le village est surnommé le « Pompéi palestinien ».\n\nGéographie\nLe village est situé sur le versant ouest et nord-ouest d’une colline escarpée dominant l’oued Salman (Wadi Salman). Les rues du village suivaient la courbe de la colline. La route entre Jérusalem et Jaffa passait immédiatement au sud du village ; quelques chemins reliaient Lifta aux villages voisins. L’oued Shami était utilisé pour irriguer les cultures. Lifta se trouvait à seulement à 5 kilomètres à l’ouest de Jérusalem. À la fin de la période du mandat britannique, le village s’agrandit vers le sud-est, les dernières maisons de Lifta rejoignant celles du quartier ouest de Jérusalem, Rumaymah ou Romema (en), ainsi que vers le sud et le sud-ouest, le long de la route Jaffa-Jérusalem. Le territoire de Lifta se trouve au nord et au nord-ouest de Jérusalem. Le village était situé à une altitude d’environ 675 m.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nUne source permanente est vue comme le site primitif du village. Parmi les découvertes archéologiques autour de la source se trouvent une grotte utilisée comme tombeau, des fragments de poterie du bronze moyen II et de l’âge du fer II.\nD’autres restes archéologiques de l’âge du fer II ont été découverts au village.\n\nIdentification biblique\nLe site est considéré par certains comme identique à celui du village biblique de Mei Neftoach (מי נפתוח), peuplé anciennement. Nephtoah (en hébreu ancien נפתח, littéralement la source du détroit) est mentionné dans la bible hébraïque à la frontière entre les tribus israélites de Juda et de Benjamin et qu’il était le point le plus au nord de la tribu de Juda. D’autres universitaires considèrent cette identification comme plausible mais non certaine. Kitchener et Conder jugent cette identification insatisfaisante, et préfèrent identifier Lifta avec Eleph, de la tribu de Benjamin (cité dans le livre de Josué 18:28).\n\nPériodes romaine et byzantine\nLes Romains et les Byzantins l’appellent Nephtho.\n\nCroisades\nAucune information n’est disponible pour la période islamique. À l’époque des Croisades, les Européens appellent le village Clepsta. Les restes d’une cour de maison  de l’époque des Croisades ont été retrouvées au centre du village.\n\nPériode ottomane\nEn 1596, Lifta était un village de la nahié (sous-district) de Jérusalem de la liwa' de Jérusalem, et avait une population de 72 ménages musulmans, soit environ 396 habitants. Tous les revenus fiscaux allaient à une fondation religieuse, ou waqf.\nEn 1834, une bataille a lieu durant la révolte de Palestine. Ibrahim Pacha conduit son armée qui défait les rebelles, menés par le cheikh Kassim al-Ahmad (en), un notable important qui habitait le village. La famille de Kassim al-Ahmad restait puissante et dominait la région au sud-ouest de Naplouse de leurs villages fortifiés de Deir Istiya et Beit Wazan. En 1838, le bibliste Edward Robinson cite Lifta comme village musulman, situé dans la zone Beni Malik, à l’ouest de Jérusalem.\nEn 1863, Victor Guérin décrit Lifta, entouré de jardins de citronniers, orangers, figuiers, grenadiers et abricotiers. Une liste de village ottomane de 1870 indique 117 maisons et 395 hommes.\nLe rapport du fonds d’exploration de la Palestine de 1883 décrit un village sur le côté d’une colline avec, au sud, une source et des tombeaux taillés dans la pierre.\nEn 1896, la population est estimée à 966 habitants.\nEn 1907, l’historien allemand Gustav Rothstein est invité à Lifta par son professeur d’arabe, Elias Nasrallah Haddad. Il écrit un article de 20 pages décrivant les cérémonies de mariage et les fêtes religieuses à Lifta.\n\nPériode du mandat britannique\nEn 1917, Lifta se rend aux forces britanniques en agitant le drapeau blanc et symboliquement, les clés du village.\nDans le recensement de 1922, Lifta a 1451 habitants, tous musulmans augmentant à 1893 au recensement de 1931 (les habitants de Lifta étant alors comptés avec l’orphelinat Schneller (en), ou orphelinat syrien) ; parmi eux, 1844 musulmans, 35 juifs et 14 chrétiens, avec 410 maisons.\nPendant les émeutes de 1929, selon une source israélienne, quelques villageois de Lifta participaient aux bandes qui ont attaqué et pillé les communautés juives des alentours.\nDans les statistiques des villages de 1945, la population de Lifta était de 2250 habitants, dont 2230 musulmans et 20 chrétiens ; la superficie totale était de 8743 dunams, dont 3248 dunams consacrés aux céréales et 324 construits.\nAvant 1948, le village, avec environ 2500 habitants, avait des vergers, des moulins à huile, un pressoir à vin, une clinique moderne, deux cafés, deux charpentiers, des salons de coiffure, un boucher et une mosquée. Quelques Juifs habitaient dans le village, et un ancien habitant juif a décrit la relation de sa famille avec la majorité arabe comme « excellente ». La partie arabe de la population possédait 89 % des terres, les Juifs environ 8 %, le restant étant des terres publiques.\nL’économie du village dépendait fortement des liens avec Jérusalem, dont le marché absorbait les produits agricoles des paysans de Lifta, qui profitaient des services de la ville. Dans les années 1940, la prospérité du village s’est beaucoup accrue, permettant d’améliorer le réseau routier. Deux cafés et un club étaient le centre de la vie sociale à Lifta, attirant même des clients de Jérusalem. Deux écoles se trouvaient au village, une pour les filles et une pour les garçons, l’école de filles ayant été financée collectivement par plusieurs villages.\n\nGuerre de 1948 et expulsion\nDans la guerre civile de 1947-1948 Lifta, Romema et Shaykh Badr, situés stratégiquement sur la route de Jérusalem à Tel-Aviv, étaient prioritaires dans les opérations des forces juives. L’histoire officielle de la Haganah indique simplement que les habitants de Lifta ont « libéré » le village [aux Israéliens]. Selon Benny Morris, quelques familles avaient quitté le village après que la décision ait été prise, un peu avant le 4 décembre, d’évacuer les femmes et les enfants afin d’accueillir un compagnie de militaires. Selon Ilan Pappé, le premier accrochage se situe en décembre, quand le propriétaire d’une station-service de Romema, mais vivant à Lifta, est tué par la Haganah, sous le prétexte (fallacieux) qu’il incitait les Arabes à caillasser les véhicules des Juifs qui traversaient le village. En réplique à cet assassinat, les habitants de Lifta se mettent effectivement à jeter des pierres sur les véhicules des Juifs. Selon Morris, les premiers accrochages remontent à mi-décembre, quand une milice paramilitaire arabe prend des positions pour défendre Lifta. Les patrouilles de la Haganah échangeaient quelques coups de feu avec ces miliciens, alors que l’Irgoun et le Lehi étaient bien plus agressifs. Le 28 décembre 1947, le village subit un massacre. La Haganah lança une attaque à la grenade et à la mitrailleuse sur le café de Salah Eisa. Afin de faire comprendre aux habitants qu’ils devaient quitter leur  village, la maison du moukhtar est incendiée, et 20 bâtiments détruits. L’attaque fait sept morts (six selon d’autres sources) ; de nombreuses femmes et enfants quittent le village. Le même jour, les terroristes du Lehi attaque de son propre chef un bus arabe et tirent dedans, afin de « punir les villages arabes ». Après fin décembre, une grande partie des villageois prennent la fuite. Une autre opération de la Haganah a lieu le 11 janvier, afin d’accélérer la fuite des villageois et sur les villages voisins. Lifta subit ensuite des pénuries alimentaires, début janvier 1948. Un certain nombre de villageois retournèrent chez eux. En conséquence, lors de sa visite du village, Abd al-Kader al-Husseini ordonne que les femmes, les enfants et les vieillards quittent le village, les hommes devant rester. Le 29 janvier, le Lehi détruit 3 maisons du village. Début février, le village est abandonné par la milice. Selon Benny Morris, c’est un assaut qui est la cause de la dépopulation du village. Selon Palestine Remembered, les derniers habitants à quitter le village ont été transportés par camion à Jérusalem-Est. Le 7 février, lors de son voyage à Jérusalem, David Ben Gourion visite Lifta, et exprime sa satisfaction le soir même devant le conseil du Mapaï : « Quand vous arrivez à Jérusalem par Lifta-Romema, Mahane Yehuda, King Georges Street (en) et Méa Shéarim, il n’y a pas d’étrangers [d’Arabes]. 100 % de Juifs ».\nSelon un entretien mené avec un habitant en 2021, il y a environ 40 000 réfugiés palestiniens descendant de ces Arabes chassés de leurs maisons, répartis à Jérusalem-Est, la Cisjordanie, la Jordanie et la diaspora palestinienne. Plusieurs familles conservent leurs actes de propriété de l’acte ottomane, attestant de leur droits de propriété à Lifta.\n\nPériode israélienne\nLifta a été utilisé pour abriter des réfugiés juifs pendant la guerre, et après la guerre l’agence juive et Israël ont installé des immigrants juifs du Yémen et du Kurdistan, 300 familles au total. La propriété des maisons n’était pas enregistré à leur nom. Les conditions de vie étaient difficiles : mauvais état des maisons, les routes et les moyens de transports étaient défaillants, et il n’y avait ni électricité, ni eau courante, ni installations d’épuration. En 1969-71, la plupart des Juifs du village choissisent de partir dans le cadre d’un programme de compensation d’Amidar, l’agence immobilière nationale. Des trous ont été percés dans les toits des maisons abandonnées pour les rendre inhabitables, et éviter ainsi le retour des réfugiés, qualifiés de squatteurs. Treize familles, vivant dans la partie du village proche de l’autoroute 1 et n’ayant pas de problèmes de transport, ont choisi de rester. Des hippies et des sans-abris ont vécu à Lifta un certain temps.\nLes colonies juives de Mey Niftoach et Givat Shaul sont implantées sur les terres de Lifta.\nDans les années 1980, Lifta est classé réserve naturelle municipale, sous l’égide de la direction de la Nature et des Parcs.\nEn 1984, un des bâtiments abandonnés est occupé par la bande de Lifta, un groupe de Juifs complotant la destruction des mosquées de l’esplanade des Mosquées à Jérusalem, qui ont été arrêtés à l’entrée du site avec 120 kilos d’explosif, des grenades à main et d’autres armes\nAprès le départ des habitants juifs, plusieurs bâtiments du village ont été utilisés pour le centre de désintoxication pour adolescents de Lifta, fermé en 2014 et par l’école supérieure de Lifta depuis 1971, une école à éducation ouverte, réinstallée dans la colonie allemande de Jérusalem (en) en 2001.\nEn 2011, un projet de démolition du village pour le remplacer par un ensemble de 212 logements de luxe et un hôtel est présenté. Les anciens habitants ont fait une demande légale pour préserver le village comme site historique. Lifta était le dernier village arabe vidé de ses habitants à n’avoir ni été complètement détruit ni réoccupé. En 2012, ce projet est rejeté par le tribunal de district de Jérusalem.\nEn 2011, trois livres sur l'histoire du village palestinien avaient été publiés.\nEn juin 2017, les derniers habitants juifs quittent le village après un accord avec le gouvernement qui reconnait qu’ils ne sont pas des squatteurs, mais qu’ils avaient été installés là par les autorités compétentes. En juillet 2017, Mei Neftoach est déclaré réserve naturelle nationale, 55 des 450 maisons d’avant 1948 étant encore debout.\nEn 2021, l’autorité foncière d'Israël, sans en informer la municipalité de Jérusalem, announce lors de la journée de Jérusalem un appel d’offres pour un nouveau projet de quartier de luxe sur les ruines du village, avec 259 villas, un hôtel et un centre commercial. Le 11 août 2022, ce plan est abandonné, le nouveau maire de Jérusalem, Moshe Lion, cherchant à préserver le village et à le faire accéder au rang de patrimoine mondial. L’ancien maire, Nir Barkat, également homme d’affaires, avait approuvé le plan de démolition avant de changer d’avis après une visite du site.\n\nCulture\nUn sanctuaire consacré au sage cheikha Badr se trouvait au village.\n\nPatrimoine mondial\nAprès l’expulsion des villageois palestiniens, il restait 60 maison de pierre sur les 410 du village, certaines à trois étages, avec la mosquée, un moulin à huile et un sentier empierré vers la source. Le village a été placé comme potentiel élément du patrimoine mondial par l’Unesco, classement validé en 2018 comme site en danger.\n\nRobes traditionnelles\nLifta était l’une des communautés les plus prospères autour de Jérusalem, et les femmes de Lifta étaient connues pour leurs broderies[Quand ?]. Les robes de mariées Thob Ghabani étaient cousues à Lifta. Elles étaient taillées dans du ghabani, un coton naturel couvert de broderiess de soie de couleur dorée produites à Alep, et étaient plus reserrées que les autres robes. Les manches étaient aussi plus étroites. Les flancs, les manches et le bustier étaient aussi ornés d’empiècements de soie. Les robes étaient fabriquées à Bethléem. Les femmes mariées de Lifta portaient un shaṭweh, coiffe conique distinctive, également portée à Bethléem, Ein Kerem, Beit Jala et Beit Sahour[Quand ?]\n\nPersonnalités liées à Lifta\nRasmea Odeh\nYahya Hammouda\n\nActuellement\nOutre les maisons conservées du village, des figuiers et des amandiers des vergers de Lifta subsistent le long du cours d’eau issu de la source. La mosquée et le club du village sont encore debout ; le cimetière est recouvert de buissons.\n\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nBibliographie générale\nJames Turner Barclay, The city of Great King; or, Jerusalem as it was, Philadelphia, J.

      "summary": "Lifta (لفتا; ליפתא) était un village palestinien situé aux alentours de Jérusalem, existant jusqu’à la fin de la Palestine mandataire. Ses habitants ont été expulsés par des milices paramilitaires sionistes pendant la guerre de 1948 en Palestine.\nÀ l’époque ottomane, le village avait 400 habitants, tous musulmans. En 1834, une bataille a lieu durant la révolte de Palestine. Lors du recensement britannique de 1922, 1451 habitants sont enregistrés, tous musulmans. Avant 1948, le village avait des vergers, des moulins à huile, un pressoir à vin, une clinique moderne, deux cafés, deux charpentiers, des salons de coiffure, un boucher et une mosquée. Dans les statistiques villageoises de 1945, la population est de 2250, dont 20 chrétiens. Quelques Juifs y habitaient, et un ancien habitant juif décrit les relations entre sa famille et la majorité arabe comme excellentes.\nPendant la guerre de 1948, un massacre a lieu le 28 décembre 1947, quand une milice paramilitaire juive attaque un café à la mitrailleuse et à la grenade. La maison du moukhtar est incendiée par les sionistes et 20 maisons démolies détruites. Les habitants arabes sont expulsés, et le village repeuplé par des immigrants juifs. En juillet 2017, Israël déclare Lifta (Mei Neftoach) réserve naturelle nationale. Le village est surnommé le « Pompéi palestinien ».",
