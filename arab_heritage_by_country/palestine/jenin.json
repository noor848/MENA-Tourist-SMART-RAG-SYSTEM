      "content": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEtymology\nJenin has been identified as the place \"Gina\" or \"Ginah\" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning \"the spring of gardens\" or \"the spring of Ganim\", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city's ancient name.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nJenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as \"Ein Ganim\", \"Beth Hagan\", \"Ginah\", and \"Ginae\", along other names.\nTell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district. The tell is also known as Tell el-Nawar, a term derived from the Arabic word for \"gypsies,\" due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.\n\nBronze Age\nJenin has been identified as the place Gina or Ginah mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\n\nIron Age\nJenin is identical to Ein-Ganim, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with Beth-Haggan, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah's flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as Gini.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nJosephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions Ginae as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, Ginae was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.\nBiblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, \"the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive\", was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke's Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.\nCeramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, \"is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance\".\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major), to distinguish it from the town of Zir'in, which they called Petit Grin. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nShortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as \"a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.\" In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.\nIn 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) \"to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of 'Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.\" As one of the stations of the Mamluk barid (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun's son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1299–1309, 1310–1341), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans' drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as \"an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water\" north of Qaqun \"on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]\". He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a nahiya (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.\nThe tax registers from 1548 to 1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed sanjak-bey (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun sanjak-bey in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.\nThe Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town's Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and sanjak-beys of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it \"does not exist anymore\". No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.\nIn the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the mallakin (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Jenin as \"The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.\"\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on \"an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage\" that caused the British administration \"grave concern\", according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya'bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\nThe village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.\n\nIsraeli occupation 1967 to 2020\nJenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.\nOn 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.\nAccording to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.\nAccording to the BBC, the city is \"Known among Palestinians\" as \"the Martyrs' capital\", but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.\nDuring the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians,  were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.\nDuring a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.\n\nIn the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.\n\nIsraeli occupation in the 2020s\nOn 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.\nOn 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.\nOn 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city's refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled \"militants\", were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said \"The operation is progressing as planned,\" and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a \"center for terrorist activity\" thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.\nOn 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nGaza war\nDuring the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.\nJenin was severely damaged during the Gaza war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.\n\nIn late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that \"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.\" The governor of Jenin said that \"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.\" The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is \"not extremely different from regular activity\". At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying \"a dead and a wounded person\", leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.\nAlso in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures\".\nIn December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called \"Protect the Homeland\". The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.\nOn January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin were ongoing as of late February 2025. Around 100 homes had been demolished, residents were being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks had been deployed.\n\nGeography\nJenin is situated at the foot of the rugged northernmost hills (Jabal Nablus) of the West Bank, and along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amer), which the city overlooks. Its highest elevation is about 250 meters above sea level and its lowest areas are 90 meters above sea level. Immediately southwest of Jenin is the Sahl Arraba plain (Dothan Valley), while further south is the Marj Sanur valley. About 1.5 kilometers to Jenin's east is Mount Gilboa (Jabal Faqqua).\nJenin is 42 kilometers north of Nablus, 18 kilometers to the south of Afula, and 51 kilometers southeast of Haifa. The nearest localities are Umm at-Tut and Jalqamus to the southeast, Qabatiya and Zababdeh to the south, Burqin to the southwest, Kafr Dan to the west, Arranah, Jalamah and the Arab Israeli village of Muqeible to the north, Deir Ghazaleh to the northeast, and Beit Qad and Deir Abu Da'if to the east.\n\nClimate\nGovernment\nJenin municipality was established in 1886 under the Ottoman rule with no more than 80 voters and elections were made every 4 years until 1982 when the Israeli government took control over the municipality until 1995. \nList of Jenin mayors:\n\nMunicipal elections were held in Jenin on 15 December 2005. Six seats each were won by Hamas and the local coalition of Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Jenin was one of several Palestinian cities where Hamas showed a dramatic growth in electoral support.\n Hadem Rida was then elected as Mayor of the city, until he was arrested by the Israel Forces and spent 3 years in jail. After his release, he resigned from the position and went back to practice in his clinic in Jenin city.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jenin had a population of 49,908, the Jenin Refugee Camp of 10,417 on 373 dunams (92 acres). Some 42.3% of the population of the camp was under the age of 15.\n\nPublic institutions and landmarks\nJenin is home to many institutions, landmarks, and works of art.

According to local traditions, he was a descendant of Ali Zayn al-Abidin, the grandson of Muhammad and the sixth Sh'ia Imam. According to a local tradition, Sheikh Izz al-Din fought alongside Saladin against the Crusaders. The tomb possibly predates the cemetery, which served as a burial site for the people of Jenin and the Turabay dynasty.

      "content": "جِنِين مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة جنين وأكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفة الغربية المحتلة التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية. تعتبر تاريخيًا، إحدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافة 75 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الأردن من ناحية الشرق، ومرج بن عامر إلى جهة الشمال.\nبالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبة مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلا اقتصاديا أكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 48,479 نسمة بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 آلاف نسمة، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا أو طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، أما المحافظة فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمة.\nتصل مساحة مدينة جنين وحدها إلى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس أكبر مدينة فلسطينية في الضفة الغربية بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحة محافظة جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا أي 9,7% من مساحة الضفة الغربية الإجمالية. يتبع المدينة مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينة عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والآشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن الكنعانيين هم من أسسها في حدود سنة 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من أقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال مأهولة بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينة بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر أخصب أراضي فلسطين التاريخية، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطية.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تارة تنهض وتارة أخرى تنتكس، إلا أن المدينة ازدهرت في أواخر الحكم العثماني وتأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياة في جنين بصورة متسارعة عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين إليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمة بين المدن الكبرى بالضفة الغربية في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينة جنين شأن عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بداية الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبة لإسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركة عدد كبير من أبناءها في العمل المسلح ضد إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضة الثانية.\n\nتسمية\nتقوم مدينة جنين على الأرض التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جنيم» وتعني بالكنعانية عين الجنائن. لذلك سُميت بهذا الاسم بسبب الجنائن التي تحيط بها.\nذًُكرت مدينة «عين جنيم» في التوراة على أنها إحدى المدن التي سكنها اللاويون المنتمين لقبيلة «إسحقكر»، والذين غيروا اسمها إلى «جنّت» بعد بضع سنوات من استقرارهم بها. وفي كتابات أخرى يُرمز إلى المدينة باسم «جيني»، ويذكر المؤرخ اليهودي «يوسيفوس فلافيوس» أن مدينة جنين كانت إحدى مدن شمال السامرة.\n\nتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nتوفرت في موقع جنين المظاهر الطبيعية اللازمة لأي استقرار بشري، ففيه توفر الماء والسهل والجبل والأودية والكهوف، وبالتالي وفر هذا الموقع الماء والغذاء والمأوى والطريق. وعليه فليس من المستغرب أن يكون الإنسان الأول قد أقام في هذا الموقع ولا سيما أنه اكتشفت بقايا الإنسان الأول في جبل الكرمل القريب من موقع جنين، وفي نفس الوقت ليس هناك ما يحول دون انتقال ذلك الإنسان من جبل الكرمل إلى جنين. وقبل الميلاد بقرون عديدة كانت مدن بيت شان (بيسان) ومجدو ودوثان، وحتى تقوم بين هذه المدن علاقات تجارية فلا بد من موقع وسطي يقوم بتقديم الخدمات للقوافل التجارية، وأنسب موقع في هذا المجال هو موقع مدينة جنين الذي بقع في وسط المثلث الذي شكله مواقع تلك المدن. ويعزز هذا الرأي ورود اسم المدينة في النصوص المصرية القديمة وفي الوثائق البابلية والآشورية. وقد ورد اسم المدينة في التوراة باسم «عين جنيم» أو \"Eun Gannim\" (بالعبرية: ג'נין) أي عين الجنات لكثرة مياهها وبساتينها، وكانت تعرف باسم «باب السامرة» (سبسطية الحالية) لأنها تقع عند بداية الوادي الذي يصل بين مرج ابن عامر وجبال السامرة. ونظراً لعدم حصانة موقع عين جانيم أنشأت في ذلك الوقت «مدينة بلعام» (بلعمة حالياً) التي تقع جنوب جنين ومشرفة على طريق السامرة. والمعروف أن جنين الحالية تقوم على المنطقة التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جانيم» العربية الكنعانية.\n\nالعهد الفينيقي والإغريقي\nعُثر على 4 مشاعل مصنوعة من الطين النضيج في جنين، وهي ذات أصل فينيقي وتعود للقرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وكان صاحب هذا الاكتشاف هو عالم الآثار «ج.أ. هاردينغ»، الذي قال بأن هذا دليل على وجود نوع من التفاعل والعلاقات التجارية بين سكان جنين وفينيقيا في ذلك الزمن.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nفي العهد الروماني كانت في مكانها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي»، وقد مر بالقرب منها المسيح أكثر من مرة وهو في طريقه من الناصرة إلى القدس. وقد اعتنق سكانها المسيحية، حيث عثر على بقايا كنيسة بالقرب من مركز جنين، في قرية برقين تحديداً، ويعود تاريخ هذه الكنيسة إلى القرن السادس الميلادي. وقد غير الرومان اسمها من «عين جنيم» إلى «جنين».\n\nالفتح الإسلامي والصليبيون\nولما جاء الفتح الإسلامي حُرّف اسمها إلى «جينين»، وقد قال عنها ياقوت الحموي في معجم البلدان بأنها «بليدة حسنة بين نابلس وبيسان من أرض الأردن، بها عيون ومياه.» وتعاقبت على حكم المنطقة الدولة الأموية ثم العباسية. وعندما انحطت هذه الأخيرة أخذ يسيطر على فلسطين فئة خارجة عن القانون، مما سهّل على الصليبيين غزوها.\nسقطت مدينة جنين تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1103م، وقد احتلها دوق أدنبرة، ودخلت ضمن إمارة بلدوين ومملكة بيت المقدس. وقد غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى «غرين الكبرى» (بالفرنسية: Grand Grin)، تمييزاً لها عن بلدة زرعين التي دعوها باسم «غرين الصغرى» (بالفرنسية: Petit Grin)، وقد أحاطها الصليبيون بقلاع وحصون منيعة.\nبقيت جنين بيد الصليبيين حتى عام 1187م، حيث هاجمها صلاح الدين الأيوبي إذ استطاع جنده ثقب قلعتها ولكن القلعة سقطت عليهم، وبالتالي غادرها صلاح الدين إلى زرعين ومن ثم إلى عين جالوت. وبعد معركة حطين سقطت جنين بيد المسلمين، وقد عقد صلاح الدين صلحاً مع أعدائه عام 588 هـ، وبالتالي تركها وغادر بعد ذلك إلى بيسان.\nفي عام 1229 عُقد صلح بين فردريك الثاني - إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة والكامل الأيوبي خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة، أعطيت المدينة بموجبه إلى الصليبيين ولكن الملك الصالح أيوب استطاع تحريرها نهائياً عام 1244م في معركة هربيا بمساعدة الخوارزمية. وفي عام 1255م تم الاتفاق بين الناصر الأيوبي وبين عز الدين أيبك، أول سلاطين المماليك، على إعطائه كل الأراضي التي تقع غرب نهر الأردن (فلسطين حالياً)، وبالتالي دخلت جنين في حوزة المماليك.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nلقد كانت جنين وزرعين إحدى إقطاعيات الظاهر بيبرس، في عام 1260 شهدت منطقة عين جالوت الواقعة بالقرب من زرعين، شمال جنين واحدة من المعارك الفاصلة في التاريخ، حيث تعد معركة عين جالوت من أهم المعارك في تاريخ العالم الإسلامي، انتصر فيها المسلمون المماليك انتصارا ساحقا على المغول وكانت هذه هي المرة الأولى التي يهزم فيها المغول في معركة حاسمة منذ عهد جنكيز خان. أدت المعركة لانحسار نفوذ المغول في بلاد الشام وخروجهم منها نهائيا وإيقاف المد المغولي المكتسح الذي أسقط الخلافة العباسية سنة 1258م. وفي عام 1280م ولّى السلطان قلاوون الأمير بدر الدين درباس ولاية جنين ومرج ابن عامر. ومن أبرز حوادث جنين في العهد المملوكي، انتشار الوباء في مصر والشام عام 748هـ، ويعود تمكن الوباء من هذه المدينة لانفتاحها على البلدان الأخرى ولكثرة الوافدين إليها حيث كانت جنين مركزاً من مراكز البريد بين غزة ودمشق. وقد حكم الأمراء الحارثيون - الذين أعلنوا الولاء للعثمانيين - هذه البلاد. وكانت مدينة جنين مركزاً لزعامتهم (من 1601م إلى 1671م) حيث خرجت الإمارة منهم بعد هذا التاريخ وتولى الإمارة أحمد باشا الترزي ثم جاء بعده شيوخ المهاميط وأشهرهم الشيخ علي من أواخر القرن السابع عشر حتى أوائل القرن الثامن عشر. وفي عام 1566م قامت فاطمة خاتون زوجة والي دمشق ببناء جامع اشتمل على حمام وتكية وسوق (وهو جامع جنين الكبير حالياً) وقد بقي آل طرباي مسيطرين على المنطقة وموالين للعثمانيين الذين ساعدوهم ضد الأمير فخر الدين المعني الثاني - حاكم لبنان - الذي فر إلى أوروبا عام 1613م، ولكنه ما لبث أن عاد ثانية إلى المنطقة، وتمكن من هزيمة الطرباي الذين حكموا المنطقة عام 1624م. وفي عام 1660م ألحقت جنين مع سنجق اللجون بولاية صيدا.\nفي عام 1799 هاجم الفرنسيون بقيادة نابليون فلسطين وعسكر قائده كليبر في مرج ابن عامر، هنا هاجمه جنود الدولة العثمانية بمساعدة أهالي جنين ونابلس، الذين كادوا يقضون على الفرنسيين في تلك المنطقة، لولا أن هبّ نابليون لنجدة كليبر، حيث قطع نابليون خط إمدادات العثمانيين. ولما انتصر الفرنسيون أمر نابليون جنده بحرق جنين ونهبها انتقاماً منهم لمساعدتهم للعثمانيين. وبعد اندحار الفرنسيين ورجوعهم إلى مصر نمت مدينة جنين ثانية وأصبحت مركزاً لمتسلمية جنين، يحكمها متسلم ينوب عن والي صيدا وكانت في الغالب لعائلتي آل جرار وآل عبد الهادي.\nوكان جبل نابلس في هذه الفترة ينقسم إلى متسلميتين: الأولى «متسلمية اللجون» والتي انتقلت فيما بعد إلى جنين والثانية «متسلمية نابلس» واللتان تقعان ضمن سنجق البلقاء (نابلس) التابع لولاية بيروت العثمانية. وكان آل جرار أمراء متسلمية اللجون منذ أوائل القرن الثامن عشر، ففي نهاية هذا القرن قامت الدولة العثمانية بتعيين الشيخ يوسف الجرار أميراً على اللجون في بلاد حارثة، والذي قام وبمساعدة سكان المنطقة والعثمانيين بنجدة أحمد باشا الجزار حاكم عكا في التصدي للغزو الفرنسي على المدينة.\nثم دخلت جنين كباقي مدن الشام تحت الحكم المصري بعد أن نجح إبراهيم باشا في طرد العثمانيين، وعين حسين عبد الهادي حاكماً لها، كما جعلها مركز لواء خاصاً به، إلا أن حكم المصريين لم يدم طويلاً حيث اضطر المصريون للخروج من بلاد الشام عام 1840م. فعادت جنين قائمقامية في متصرفية نابلس التابعة لولاية بيروت التي أنشئت بدلاً من ولاية صيدا. وفي القرن العشرين ربطت جنين بسكة حديد الحجاز التي وصلتها بالعفولة وبيسان ونابلس، وفي الحرب العالمية الأولى أقام الجيش الألماني مطاراً عسكرياً غرب جنين.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عهد الانتداب البريطاني أصبحت المدينة مركزاً لقضاء جنين، ولها سجل حافل بالنضال ضد الاستعمار البريطاني والصهيوني، حيث أعلنت أول قوة مسلحة ضد الاستعمار البريطاني عام 1935م بقيادة عز الدين القسام، والذي استشهد لاحقاً في أحراش بلدة يعبد وهي أحد البلدات التي تقع غرب مدينة جنين. وقد اشترك سكان المدينة في إضراب عام 1936، وقد تعرضت جنين إبان فترة الانتداب البريطاني إلى الكثير من أعمال العنف والتنكيل والتخريب وهدم البيوت على أيدي القوات البريطانية نتيجة لبعض الحوادث مثل قتل حاكم جنين «موفيت» في عام 1938.\n\nقيام دولة إسرائيل\nأما بعد انسحاب البريطانيين من فلسطين منتصف 1948، وفي خضم [[حرب فلسطين\n1948|الحرب العربية-الإسرائيلية الأولى]] أو النكبة، اختير القائد عبد القادر الحسيني لتولي القيادة العسكرية في جبل القدس. ولما تأخر وصول كتاب جيش الإنقاذ من الدول العربية المجاورة حتى أواخر شهر كانون الثاني سنة 1948، قرر الحسيني تعبئة القوى الشعبية في القسم العربي من التقسيم وقد كان يعتمد على متطوعي جبل نابلس لتاريخ هذا الجبل البطولي والعسكري، ولذا فقد وفد إلى مدينة جنين مطلع شهر كانون الثاني وبعد مناقشات ومحادثات مع وجهاء المنطقة، عقدت عدة اجتماعات في قرى القضاء وتطوع عدد كبير من المقاتلين واختار الجمع الشيخ فوزي الجرار قائداً لجميع فرق مقاتلي جبل نابلس. وقد أقرت الهيئة العربية العليا والقيادة العسكرية العليا لجامعة الدول العربية هذا التعيين واعتمدته وأوصت أن يتخذ جرار مراكزه في قرى صانور، صير وجبع.\nولقد خاضت جنين بمدنها وقراها معركة الدفاع عن الوجود ضد المنظمات الصهيونية المسلحة، التي استولت في أواخر مايو سنة 1948 على قرى زرعين، والمزار، ونورس، وصندلة، والجلمة، والمقيبلة، وفقوعة، وعرانة، وحاولت الاستيلاء على مدينة جنين حيث تم تطويقها في 3 يونيو 1948 وكان عدد الصهاينة 4000 مقاتل؛ فاستولوا على معظم أحياء المدينة وتحصن المجاهدون في عمارة الشرطة في المدخل الغربي لجنين. حتى وصلت نجدة للمحاصرين قوامها 500 جندي عراقي بقيادة عمر علي وحوالي 800 من المجاهدين الفلسطينيين من المدينة. وبعد معارك دامية خارج البلدة وفي شوارعها وأزقتها شارك فيها العديد من سكان المنطقة وقراها المجاورة تقدم العرب لاسترداد قراهم المحيطة بالمدينة. وقد كانت معركة جنين التي وقعت في 3 حزيران سنة 1948 مفخرة للمقاتلين من أهل البلاد الذين استشهد منهم العشرات بالإضافة للعدد الكبير من الجرحى، والتي أدت في آخر المطاف إلى انسحاب القوات الإسرائيلية من جنين في 4 حزيران سنة 1948 وتكبيدها خسائر جسيمة بلغت 1241 قتيل ومفقود من أصل 4000 جندي إسرائيلي كانوا يحاصرون المدينة. يستذكر الفلسطينيون شهداء الجيش العراقي الذين سقطوا دفاعاً عن جنين، حيث توجد مقبرة للعشرات منهم بالقرب من مثلث الشهداء جنوب المدينة.\n\nقيام السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً للواء جنين التابع لمحافظة نابلس. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة. رزحت جنين تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة جنين التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة. استمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة جنين، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nفي 3 نيسان من سنة 2002 قامت القوات الإسرائيلية باقتحام جنين ومخيمها في عملية استمرت 10 أيام متواصلة، ارتكبت فيها إسرائيل مجزرة راح ضحيتها 58 فلسطيني، فيما تكبدت هي خسائر جسيمة بأعداد القتلى حيث ناهزت العشرين قتيل من الجنود الإسرائيليين الذي اشتبكوا في حرب شوارع مع فصائل المقاومة داخل مخيم المدينة في ما أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nحرب غزة (2023)\nخلال حرب غزة، نفذت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية عمليات متعددة في جنين. وفي 22 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، نفذت القوات الإسرائيلية غارة جوية استهدفت مجمعًا تحت الأرض أسفل مسجد الأنصار في مخيم جنين للاجئين\nبالمدينة +، ما أدى لاستشهاد اثنين وأصيب آخرين بجروح متفاوتة، وقيل إنها كانت أول غارة جوية في الضفة الغربية منذ الانتفاضة الثانية. وإدعى الجيش الإسرائيلي أن الضربة استهدفت نشطاء من حماس والجهاد الإسلامي في فلسطين كانوا يخططون ل\"هجوم إرهابي\".\nوتعرضت جنين لأضرار بالغة خلال الحرب على غزة، وبحلول يونيو 2024، أدت الهجمات المتكررة بالقنابل والتوغلات بالجرافات من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية إلى تدمير كل شارع وتحويل كل ساحة عامة إلى أنقاض. وفي حادثة واحدة في 21 مايو، وفقًا للصحفي الإسرائيلي جدعون ليفي، أطلق قناص إسرائيلي النار على المارة ما أدى لاستشهادهم، بما في ذلك جراح الدكتور أسيد جبارين (50 عامًا) أثناء توجهه إلى العمل في مستشفى جنين الحكومي.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nورد اسم جنين بالمخطوطات المصرية القديمة، وكذلك البابلية والآشورية وفي التوراة والإنجيل، وهي مشتقة من الاسم القديم «عين جهانيم» أو «جنيم» وهي قريبة من الجنائن والبساتين. وتعتبر جنين خامس الأماكن المقدسة عند المسيحيين، لمرور يسوع المسيح من قرية برقين، حيث أشفى العشرة البرص المنعزلين في مغارة بطرف القرية.\nوفي المكان نفسه وفي أوائل القرن الرابع الميلادي أقام قسطنطين الكبير كنيسة برقين المعروفة بكنيسة جرجس وقد قامت الحكومة الهولندية بإجراء الإصلاحات اللازمة لها بالتنسيق مع دائرة الآثار في السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية باعتبارها من الأماكن المقدسة لدى النصارى، وأصبحت هذه الكنيسة تعتبر طريق الوصل للحجاج المسيحيين من الناصرة إلى بيت لحم. وفي الفترة المشار إليها أقيمت في جنين كنيسة من ضمن 31 مدينة و442 قرية في عموم أراضي فلسطين، وظلت الكنيسة قائمة إلى أن دمرها زلزال عام 560م. كما تضم المحافظة ديراً للاتين يقع في قرية الزبابدة ذات الأغلبية المسيحية، الواقعة جنوب شرق جنين.\nأما إسلامياً، فيقع في المدينة واحد من أقدم وأكبر المعالم الإسلامية العثمانية في فلسطين وهو جامع جنين الكبير الذي أنشأته فاطمة خاتون ابنة محمد بك بن السلطان الملك الأشرف قانصوة الغوري في القرن السادس عشر. ويُعتبر هذا المسجد من أبرز المعالم التاريخية في الحضارة الإسلامية في فلسطين، ومن أقدم التحف المعمارية العثمانية في البلاد.\n\nالجغرافية\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة جنين على دائرة عرض 32,28 شمالاً وعلى خط طول 35,18 شرق غرينتش، كما تقع على الإحداثيات 208 عرض و178 طول حسب شبكة الإحداثيات الفلسطينية.\nينقطع في الأجزاء الشمالية من فلسطين استمرار الإقليم الجبلي المحاذي للسهول الساحلية مكوناً سهلاً يشبه مثلثاً متساوي الأضلاع، تمتد قاعدته من سفوح جبل الكرمل في حيفا حتى شرق جنين، ويمتد الضلع الأول من جنوب شرق الناصرة وينتهي في جوار مدينة جنين، ويمتد الضلع الثاني بمحاذاة جبال الجليل. ويطلق على السهل اسم مرج ابن عامر. وبالتالي، يمثل موقع مدينة جنين رأس مثلث سهل مرج ابن عامر، عند التقاء المرتفعات الممتدة من جبل الكرمل ومن جنوب شرق الناصرة.\nومما يعطي موقع مدينة جنين أهمية أنها تقع في موقع وسطي بالنسبة للمدن الفلسطينية، حيث تقع جنوب مدينة الناصرة على بعد 25 كم، وإلى الجنوب الشرقي من مدينة حيفا على بعد 50 كم، وإلى الشمال من مدينة نابلس على بعد 43 كم.\nتقع المدينة على السفح الشمالي لجبال نابلس على الجانب المطل على مرج بن عامر، وتنتشر مساكن المدينة على هذا السفح من ارتفاع يناهز 125م إلى ارتفاع يقارب 225م. ويتراوح انحدار هذا السفح بين 10-15 %، مما يشير إلى تدرج السفح بشكل تدريجي. وعند قمة السفح تقوم هضبة فسيحة ترتفع تدريجياً نحو الشرق، وتطل باتجاه الشمال على مرج ابن عامر ومن الجنوب الغربي تطل على سهل عرابة الذي يرتفع قرابة 250م، وبالتالي يظهر السفح الذي تقوم عليه المدينة، عتبة بين سهل مرج ابن عامر وبين سهل عرابة.\n\nقرى جنين\nفي محافظة جنين مدينتان، مدينة جنين وقباطية، ويتبع المحافظة 14 بلدية كبيرة (هي يعبد، عرابة، برقين، صانور، سيلة الحارثية، سيلة الظهر، الزبابدة، اليامون، كفر راعي، كفر دان، ميثلون، دير أبو ضعيف، جبع، عجة، صير)، كما ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من القرى ومخيم يقع إلى الغرب من المدينة، والذي تعرض للاجتياح الإسرائيلي في شهر نيسان عام 2002. كانت جنين تضم قبل نكبة 1948 حوالي (70) قرية كبيرة وصغيرة وبعد النكبة اقتصرت على ما يقارب 30 قرية صغيرة. ومثل باقي المدن الفلسطينية، تعرضت أراضي شاسعة من جنين وقراها للمصادرة من قبل إسرائيل، حيث أقام على أرضها ما يزيد عن 10 مستوطنات.\n\nالمناخ\nيختلف مناخ منطقة جنين عن المناخ العام لفلسطين، وذلك لوضعها الطبوغرافي. فتقع المدينة على ارتفاع يتراوح بين 125 و225 متر، كما تحاط بعدد من المرتفعات، فمن الشرق تحيط بها جبال جلبون ومن الجنوب والغرب والشمال الغربي تحيط بها جبال نابلس وامتدادها في جبل الكرمل، وإن انفتاحها على مرج ابن عامر تقفله جبال الجليل على بعد لا يتجاوز 20 كم. هذا الوضع قلل من استفادة المدينة من الرياح الغربية والجنوبية الغربية الماطرة والمعدلة لدرجة الحرارة، كما عمل على إبعاد مناخ جنين عن مناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وجعلته أكثر تطرفاً. مثلاً، تتلقى منطقة جنين كمية من الأمطار أقل من كمية الأمطار التي تتلقاها منطقة يعبد المجاورة بمئة وخمسين مليمترا، وحرارتها أعلى من حرارة المنطقة المجاورة.\n\nالسكان\nإن نمو عدد السكان في جنين لم يكن بمعدل كبير في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1922 و1931، وذلك بسبب هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى مدن السهل الساحلي، إلا أن هذا النمو بدأ يرتفع فيما بعد ليتضاعف عام 1947م؛ بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها، وبفعل الركود الاقتصادي الذي أصاب المناطق الساحلية، وبحكم الحرب العالمية الثانية والأحداث الجارية في المنطقة. وفي عام 1952 سجل تعداد سكان جنين ارتفاعاً كبيراً بعد تدفق أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عقب نكبة العام 1948، وعاد لينخفض انخفاضاً حاداً عام 1967 بسبب نزوح أعداد كبيرة من سكان المدينة إلى شرق الأردن ودول الخليج في أعقاب نكسة عام 1967. وفي سنة 1980 عاد عدد السكان للارتفاع بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها وما زال يواصل ارتفاعه حتى الآن.\nوفقاً لإحصاء عام 2007، فقد بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 39,000 نسمة، من بينهم 19,238 إناث و 19,766 ذكور. كما يبلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين الذي يقع غرب المدينة 16,000 لاجئ، حسب إحصائيات وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) والتي أشارت إلى أن 42.3% من سكان المخيم هم دون سن الخمسة عشر عام، وهذا يعني أن النسبة الكبرى من سكان جنين ومخيمها من الشباب. أما بالنسبة للعدد الإجمالي لسكان محافظة جنين فقد بلغ في عام 2007 حوالي 256,000 نسمة، وهو ما يشكل نسبة 6,8% من تعداد الشعب الفلسطيني داخل الأراضي الفلسطينية. يُشكل مسلم الغالبية العظمى من السكان كباقي مناطق الأراضي الفلسطينية، وتتواجد أقلية المسيحية في إسرائيل تنتشر في بعض قرى المحافظة وفي جنين نفسها. وهذا جدول بأعداد سكان منطقة جنين في سنوات مختلفة:\n\nمخيم جنين\nأسست وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (UNRWA) مخيمَ اللاجئين عام 1953 برعاية أردنية. ويقع المخيم غرب مركز المدينة، ويمتد على مساحة ضيقة لا تتجاوز الكيلومتر المربع، ويعيش فيه كما ذُكر ما يقارب 16,000 لاجئ، مما يجعله بقعة مكتظة سكانياً، وهو أمر غير صحي وخصوصًا في ظل النقص الحاد في الخدمات الأساسية.\n\nكان مخيم جنين هدفا استراتيجيا لقوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حيث حاولت استهدافه مرات عدة، لكنها فشلت أمام مقاومة أبنائه، حيث وجدت قوات الاحتلال صموداً من سكانه الذين أصروا على البقاء داخل المخيم رغم الأضرار الكبيرة التي تعرضوا لها، وبلغت الاعتداءات الإسرائيلية على المخيم ذروتها فجر 3 نيسان سنة 2002 حين اقتحمت المخيم واشتبكت مع فصائل المقاومة بحرب شوارع أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nالمواصلات\nكان لموقع جنين أكبر الأثر في حياة المدينة قديماً وحديثاً، ويظهر ذلك في تاريخها الاقتصادي والاجتماعي، وفي أهميتها كعقدة مواصلات بين جبال فلسطين الوسطى (نابلس - القدس - الخليل) ومدنها، وبين شمال فلسطين لا سيما طريق القدس - الناصرة. كما تتفرع من المدينة طرق إلى حيفا وعكا. وقد حظيت مدينة جنين باهتمام بالغ من حيث المواصلات، حيث عُبدت الطرق إليها قبل الطرق الساحلية التي كانت تعتبر أهم الطرق بالنسبة للمستعمرين أيام الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ولم تتوقف أهمية المدينة على الطرق البرية، بل امتدت أهميتها إلى الخطوط الحديدية، حيث يمر بها خط يصل إلى العفولة ومن ثم بيسان فطبريا.\nتعدّ مدينة جنين من المدن الفلسطينية التي نشأت قديمِاً وتطورت عمرانيًا وذلك نتيجة للتزايد السكاني، ولكن لم تتطور شبكة المواصلات فيها بشكل مواز، ويعود ذلك لفترات الاحتلال المتعاقبة والتي مرت بها المدينة، والظروف الاقتصادية والاجتماعية الناجمة، مما أدى إلى ظهور العديد من المشاكل في نظاِم المواصلات سواءً على مستوى تخطيط وتنظيم الطرقات والشوارع، أو على مستوى البنية الإنشائية للطرق.\n\nتأتي أهمية مدينة جنين من حيث نوع الخدمات التي تقدمها والمؤسسات الموجودةِ فيها، والتي تتضمن مكاتب حكومية ومدارس، ومستشفيات، وبنوك، وأسواق، ومحلات تجارية ومنطقة صناعية، والتي تقدم خدمات للقرى والبلدات في المحافظة. إضافة لذلك، فان أهمية المدينة تعود إلى الطرق الإقليمية والتي تم تخطيطها من قبل وزارة التخطيط والتي تمر عبر مدينة جنين، فالطريق الأولى من وادي الأردن إلى الناصرة، والأخرى تربط الخليل بحيفا وتمر عبر مدينتي نابلس ورام الله، وتأتي أهمية المدينة أيضا بسبب قربها من الخط الأخضر الوهمي الذي يفصل مناطق عام 1948 عن المناطق المحتلة عام 1967، حيث تشكل مركزا للتسوق للفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر.\nوتزداد أهمية النقل في مدينة جنين وذلك نتيجة للتوسع المدينة ونموها المتسارع. ويستخدم سكان المدينة في تنقلهم داخل المدينة وسائل نقل مختلفة. إلا أنه تبين من المسح الميداني عام 2007، أن هناك انخفاض في استخدام السيارات الخاصة في المدينة، حيث بلغت نسبة الأسر التي تمتلك سيارة خاصة 13.8% من مجموع الأسر بالمدينة. في مقابل ذلك يلاحظ ارتفاع في استخدام سيارات الأجرة وخاصة للتنقل بين مركز المدينة ومناطقها المختلفة، حيث بلغت نسبة مستخدمي هذه الوسيلة 43.9%، وبنسبة أقل للحافلات تبلغ 25.3% من مجموع السكان.\nتتكون الشبكة الحالية للطرق في مدينة جنين من مجموعة من الممرات الرئيسية، التي يتراوح عرضها من أربع مسارب إلى مسربين، تربط أجزاء المدينة ببعضها، كما تربطها بمدن فلسطينية أخرى، بالإضافة لقرى محافظة جنين، وهذه الطرق هي:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمدينة جنين إحدى المدن الرئيسية في فلسطين، بالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها تاريخياً حتى النكبة، مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلاً اقتصادياً يفوق حجمها السكاني بشدة، وهذا يعود لتمتع المحافظة بخصائص طبيعية متنوعة وفرت لها موارد اقتصادية متنوعة لا سيما في مجال التعليم والخدمات والمهن والحرف، مما مكن أبناءها من إيجاد فرص عمل في الدول العربية المجاورة، وهذا بدوره خفض من أثر المدينة بالمساهمة الفعالة بالحجم السكاني في الضفة الغربية، ولكنه أتاح الفرصة لرفع معدلات حوالات المغتربين للمدينة والمحافظة بشكل كبير مما أثر على اقتصاد المدينة والبلاد بشكل إيجابي. تدير غرفة تجارة وصناعة وزراعة لواء جنين الأوضاع الاقتصادية في المدينة.\n\nالتجارة\nوتنتشر الأسواق في مدينة جنين: فهناك السوق الشعبي، سوق الحلال، سوق الجملة، سوق السيباط، سوق شارع الناصرة، سوق شارع أبو بكر، سوق شارع بورسعيد، سوق شارع فيصل، سوق شارع الهلال، سوق شارع فاطمة خاتون، وسوق الحسبة القديمة. وتحتوي الأسواق المذكورة على العديد من المحلات التجارية المختلفة. بالإضافة إلى سوق تجاري رئيس يقع وسط المدينة وآخر يقع شمال المدينة مخصص لاستقبال المتسوقين الفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر الذين يشكلون 85% من القوة الشرائية حسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية والصناعية في جنين.\n\nالزراعة\nتعتبر الزراعة نشاطاً رئيسياً في مدينة جنين ومحافظتها، حيث يعتمد عليها غالبية السكان سواء كان ذلك بصورة مباشرة أو غير مباشرة. وقبل هجرة بعض سكانها إلى دول الخليج في ستينات القرن العشرين، كانت الزراعة هي المورد الوحيد في المنطقة. وتعد مدينة جنين زراعية لحد كبير إذ تشكل مركز التسويق والتمويل الزراعي للمحافظة، حيث تعد أراضيها الزراعية واحدة من أكثر المناطق خصوبة في الضفة الغربية، حيث تزرع سنوياً بالمحاصيل الحقلية والخضار والأشجار المثمرة كالزيتون واللوزيات والحمضيات، بالإضافة إلى استخدام البيوت البلاستيكية على نطاق واسع. كما تشتهر المحافظة منذ عقود بزراعة فاكهة البطيخ بشكل لافت. قدرت وزارة الزراعة الفلسطينية مساحة الأرض المزروعة في المحافظة عام 1998/1997، حوالي 367,415 دونم وهو ما يعادل حوالي 20% من مساحة الأرض المزروعة في الأراضي الفلسطينية.\nتتمتع منطقة جنين وطوباس بثروة حرجية تميزها على باقي محافظات السلطة الفلسطينية، وتنتشر الغابات على مساحة تقارب 270,000 دونم، تشكل حوالي 85% من أحراش الضفة الغربية، إلا أنها تقع في الغالب في التصنيف (ج) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\n\nالصناعة\nبدأ اقتصاد المدينة يتحول تدريجياً إلى الصناعة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية في منتصف تسعينات القرن الفائت، وبالأخص الصناعات الخفيفة والمتوسطة، حيث ستنشأ منطقة صناعية دولية من أجل تفعيل الحركة الاقتصادية وتنشيطها، وإيجاد فرص عمل لعدد كبير من أهالي المنطقة، وجعل جنين همزة وصل بين عرب الداخل وباقي مناطق السلطة الفلسطينية. ويمكن إجمال هذه الصناعات بالتالي: صناعات زراعية، وتشمل معاصر الزيتون والمطاحن؛ وصناعات خاصة بالبناء وتشمل المقالع والمحاجر والكسارات وصناعة البلاط والفسيفساء؛ وصناعة الملابس والأحذية والخشب والحديد.\nفي عام 2008، افتتح مهرجان للصناعات الوطنية الفلسطينية في القرية السياحية شرق جنين، برعاية السلطة الفلسطينية وبدعم أوروبي، وكان لذلك شأن كبير في تقدم المشاريع الاقتصادية وتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي في المحافظة والأراضي الفلسطينية بصورة عامة.\n\nالعمارة\nتعتبر مدينة جنين مدينة سكنية إلى حد كبير، بالإضافة لكونها مركز تجاري وزراعي، إلا أن طابع المنازل والبنايات السكنية يغلب عليها، ويختلف حجم البناء ومساحة المساكن بالنسبة للمدينة عنه في المدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، فبلغ متوسط عدد الغرف فيها 4.5 غرفة لعام 2007، بينما المعدل العام في المدن الفلسطينية هو 3.6 غرفة، وقد يعود هذا إلى عدد من العوامل منها العادات والتقاليد، حيث أن البناء حجمه وشكله ومادته كلها تعزز القيمة الاجتماعية للأسرة. ويظهر ذلك بوضوح عند الذين تركوا الأرياف ثم انتقلوا إلى السكن في مدينة جنين، كما للدخل دور في عدد الغرف بالمسكن.\nوتتوفر في محافظة جنين مناطق متعددة يتم استخراج حجارة البناء منها ومن هذه المناطق قباطيا وعجة وغيرها، مما دفع الكثير من السكان لاستخدام الحجارة في بناء مساكنهم بنسبة عالية. ويستخدم الطوب أيضا بنسبة كبيرة - خاصة بمخيم المدينة، كما تستخدم الدكة والطين بنسب أقل. إن نسبة المساكن المبنية من الحجر بلغت 40.5% من مساكن المدينة، وهي نسبة مقاربة للنسبة العامة لمدن الضفة الغربية والتي هي 40% حسب إحصاء سنة 1997.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة جنين مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، وهي الأولى على مستوى الضفة الغربية، حيث تشاطر النسبة ذاتها تقريباً كل من سلفيت وطولكرم - وتبلغ نسبة الأمية في محافظة جنين 3,9% من الذين هم أكبر من 10 سنوات، بينما المعدل العام في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nعرفت المدينة حركة تعليمية منذ أمد بعيد، حيث كان نظام (الكتاتيب) سائداً منذ بداية القرن التاسع عشر. وقد شهدت مساجد المدينة الحلقات التدريسية والمناظرات العلمية من قبل مشاهير العلماء المسلمين، وغلب على هذه الحركة العلمية الطابع الديني حيث كانت تدرس علوم الدين المختلفة من فقه وحديث.\nوفي نهاية القرن التاسع عشر أقيمت أول مدرسة ابتدائية ضمت أربعة صفوف، ثم تبع إنشاء المدرسة الابتدائية أخرى علياً. وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى بعد الانتداب البريطاني، لأن البريطانيين لم يكونوا معنيين بتطور الخدمات العامة لا سيما الخدمات التعليمية. وفي عام 1943 ارتفعت معدلات التضخم في البلاد بشكل حاد، وهذا دفع الاستعمار البريطاني للقيام ببعض الخدمات لامتصاص الفائض النقدي في البلاد، فأنشأ في مدينة جنين مدرسة ثانوية، دفع الأهالي تكاليفها بالكامل. ومن الأمور التي ساهمت فعلاً في تطوير الحركة العلمية في المدينة تشكيل لجنة المعارف المحلية التي كانت مهمتها البحث في الموارد والمصادر المالية التي يمكن عن طريقها تطوير التعليم في المدينة.\n\nوبعد حرب سنة 1948 لم يكن في المدينة سوى مدرستين، واحدة للذكور وأخرى للإناث. وبعد تولي الحكومة الأردنية زاد عدد المدارس وتضاعف عدد الطلاب.\nوفي عام 1982 بلغ عدد المدارس في مدينة جنين إحدى عشرة مدرسة للذكور وست مدراس للإناث، وبلغ عدد الطلاب في هذه السنة 2610 طالباً و2495 طالبة ومما تجدر الإشارة إليه هو أن عدد الطلاب الذكور في هذه السنة لم يتجاوز عدد الطلاب عام 1960. هذا يشير إلى ظاهرة الهجرة من المدينة في الفترة التي تلت حرب سنة 1967، أما من حيث الطالبات فقد تضاعف عددهن تقريباً بين هاتين السنتين.\nأنشأت الحكومة الأردنية في عام 1965 مديرية التربية والتعليم في جنين لتشرف على 65 مدرسة موزعة بين الذكور والإناث في التجمعات السكانية المختلفة التابعة للواء جنين آنذاك ويعمل بها 508 معلمة ومعلم. في عام 2005 بلغ عدد المدارس التابعة للمديرية 110 مدارس، وعدد الطلبة 37,531 طالب وطالبة وعدد المعلمين 1,852 معلم ومعلمة.\nأما على صعيد التعليم العالي، فقد شهدت جنين طفرةً كبيرةً في أعداد حَمَلة شهادات البكالوريوس والماجستير في كثير من التخصصات سواء في الضفة الغربية أو في الخارج. ويتبع تنظيم محافظة جنين اليوم جامعة خاصة هي الجامعة العربية الأمريكية - جنين وفرع لجامعة القدس المفتوحة، والتي لا تقتصر خدماتها التعليمية على سكان محافظة جنين فقط، بل تمتد هذه الخدمات لتشمل القرى وبعض المدن المحيطة بها.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءً من هوية سكان منطقة جنين منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الريف الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى كاف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميز في منطقة جنين وشمال الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأبيض المقلم طولياً. كذلك يظهر التأثير الريفي في المطبخ الفلسطيني لهذا الجزء من فلسطين والذي يشتهر بطبق المسخن الشعبي، الذي يعتبر في نفس الوقت من الأكلات الوطنية في المطبخ الفلسطيني.\nتحوي جنين وقراها عدداً كبيراً من المعالم الثقافية البارزة على مستوى الضفة الغربية، لكنها في الغالب إما أن تكون قد عانت أو تضررت بسبب الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. فقد تم في عام 2009 العمل على إعادة ترميم وتأهيل سينما جنين بدعم ألماني -والتي كانت تعتبر من أكبر صالات العرض في الضفة الغربية- بعد إغلاقها مدة تزيد عن 22 عاماً، أي بعد الانتفاضة الأولى مباشرة.\nبموازاة ذلك يوجد في مخيم جنين مسرح هو مسرح الحرية. يعتبر مسرح الحرية الأول في المنطقة والوحيد، تأسس عام 1990. يعمل المسرح على عقد ورش عمل مختلفة في مجالي الدراما وموسيقى الأطفال والشباب، حيث يقوم كادر العمل المسرحي بتدريب استشاريين من الشباب للعمل مع المشاركين من مخيم جنين. يوفر المسرح أيضاً دورات في العلاج من خلال التمثيل المسرحي. وتجدر الإشارة إلى أنه يقام في محافظة جنين كل عام مهرجان ثقافي هو مهرجان مرج ابن عامر للتراث والثقافة والذي يعكس الوجه الحضاري والثقافي للمحافظة والضفة الغربية بشكل عام.\nوفي جنين أيضاً مركزاً للثقافة والإبداع أُسّس عام 2005، ومعهد جنين للموسيقى يضم أوركسترا جنين للشباب، ومتحف جنين للتراث الشعبي يحاكي تاريخ فلسطين ويعتبر الأول من نوعه في البلاد، وهو يجسد جانبا من تاريخ فلسطين منذ العهدة العمرية وحتى عودة الرئيس ياسر عرفات إلى فلسطين، ويقع في القرية السياحية جنوب شرق المدينة.\n\nالإعلام\nتوجد في جنين محطتان محليتان للبث الأرضي هما تلفزيون جنين المركزي وتلفزيون فرح، كما تبث محطتان إذاعيتان من المدينة على موجة (إف أم) هما: راديو البلد - جنين وصوت الأحلام، يغطي بثيهما معظم مناطق شمال الضفة الغربية.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nتحوي المدينة عدداً قليلاً من المنشآت الكبيرة في المجالات الخدمية والاجتماعية والصحية، فتوجد بعض المستشفيات الصغيرة والعيادات بالإضافة إلى مستشفى جنين الحكومي ومستشفى الشفاء. أما بالنسبة للجانب الرياضي، فيوجد في جنين ملعب يتبع البلدية ويتسع لثلاثة آلاف متفرج، يلعب فيه نادي جنين الرياضي الذي يلعب في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز، إضافة إلى عدة فرق تنتشر في قرى المحافظة. وتوجد في المدينة العديد من المكتبات أهمها مكتبة البلدية القديمة وسط المدينة.\n\nبلدية جنين\nتم إنشاء أول بلدية في مدينة جنين عام 1886 برئاسة الحاج عبد المجيد منصور حيث كان عدد الناخبين لا يتجاوز الثمانين ناخباً من بينهم ستة أعضاء بطريقة الاقتراع السري، بحيث يعين المتصرف الرئيسي من بين الأعضاء المنتخبين لمدة أربع سنوات. وقد بقي التشريع التركي هذا معمولاً به إلى أن صدر القانون رقم 17 لسنة 1954م. وظل الوضع كما هو إلى أن قامت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقالة آخر مجلس منتخب سنة 1982 والذي كان برئاسة أحمد شوقي موسى المحمود، وتسلمت إسرائيل إدارة البلدية حتى عام 1995 حيث تشكلت لجنة وطنية برئاسة وليد أبو مويس، وقد تسلم رئاستها بقرار رئاسي من الرئيس ياسر عرفات في تشرين الأول من سنة 1995، أي بعد تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية. وتتبع بلدية جنين اليوم 14 بلدية وحوالي 30 قرية في المحافظة.\n\nقائمة رؤساء بلدية جنين\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية جنين 18 شخصًا هم:\n\nانظر أيضًا\nمعركة جنين\nفيلم جنين\nاجتياح جنين (2023)\n\nمراجع\nقراءات أخرى\nوصلات خارجية\n\nمعلومات عن جنين من صفحة مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية

      "summary": "جِنِين مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة جنين وأكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفة الغربية المحتلة التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية. تعتبر تاريخيًا، إحدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافة 75 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الأردن من ناحية الشرق، ومرج بن عامر إلى جهة الشمال.\nبالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبة مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلا اقتصاديا أكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 48,479 نسمة بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 آلاف نسمة، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا أو طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، أما المحافظة فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمة.\nتصل مساحة مدينة جنين وحدها إلى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس أكبر مدينة فلسطينية في الضفة الغربية بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحة محافظة جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا أي 9,7% من مساحة الضفة الغربية الإجمالية. يتبع المدينة مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينة عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والآشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن الكنعانيين هم من أسسها في حدود سنة 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من أقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال مأهولة بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينة بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر أخصب أراضي فلسطين التاريخية، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطية.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تارة تنهض وتارة أخرى تنتكس، إلا أن المدينة ازدهرت في أواخر الحكم العثماني وتأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياة في جنين بصورة متسارعة عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين إليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمة بين المدن الكبرى بالضفة الغربية في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينة جنين شأن عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بداية الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبة لإسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركة عدد كبير من أبناءها في العمل المسلح ضد إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضة الثانية.",
