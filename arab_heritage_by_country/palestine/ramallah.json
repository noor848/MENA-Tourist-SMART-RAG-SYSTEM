      "content": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nRamallah was founded in the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.\nSeveral Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called Ramalie. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called al-Burj, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.\n\nOttoman period\nThe area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.\nHaddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian \"of the Greek rite\". There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village \"belonged\" to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Ramallah as\n\nA large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.\n\nBritish Mandate\nDuring World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city's homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.\nThe city became a center of insurgent activity when the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine broke out. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce \"news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.\"\n\nJordanian and Israeli occupation\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized part of the territory, which they named the West Bank, which included Ramallah. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian occupation between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. However, many Palestinians were arrested and jailed for being members of \"illegal political parties\", which included the Palestine Communist Party, and other socialist and pro-independence groups. The city's population had doubled by 1953, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. About one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left by 1956, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. Because of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for the first time in 19 years, residents of Ramallah could freely visit the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel, and engage in commerce there.\nUnlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.\nAccording to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. The popular uprising known as the First Intifada erupted in December 1987, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.\nRamallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. Following the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa in December 1995 and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated \"Area A\" under the accords.\n\nPalestinian Authority control\nThe years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the \"Oslo Years\") brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah's isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine.  It hosts almost all governmental headquarters.  In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.\nOn November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.\nIn December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for a four-year term on the fifteen-seat municipal council. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.\nMunir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, \"The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries\", representing a \"collusion\" between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that \"If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.\" In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.\n\nGeography and climate\nThis area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about 615 mm (24 in) and minimum rainfall is 307 mm (12 in) and maximum rainfall is 1,591 mm (63 in).\nThe Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.\n\nEconomy\nRamallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country's numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.\nConstruction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.\nRamallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to \"exponential growth\". In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research & development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.\nBy 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and \"five-star\" hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, \"more than one hundred\" Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because \"Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.\" One local boasted to a journalist that \"Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.\" This boast was seconded by The New York Times which, in 2010, called Ramallah the \"de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of This Week in Palestine, \"Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.\" Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah's prosperity is part of an Israeli \"conspiracy\" to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.\n\nDemographics\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the Bire area, \"north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.\" In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 \"other\". The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).\nHowever, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically under Jordanian occupation, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. This left slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants Christian by 1967, and the remainder Muslim.\nRamallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in Washington, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in Michigan. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in Detroit. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.\nRamallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.\nOnly in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.\n\nHealth\nIn the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened.\n\nReligion\nThe Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city's largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city.\n\nChristian presence\nRamallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.\nThere is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph's Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.\nAs of 2022, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened \"The Girls Training Home of Ramallah\" in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional \"Tawjihi\" university exams.\nThe activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.\nIn the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.\n\nCulture\nRamallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians.\nIn 2004 the Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.\n\nPalestinian costume\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\nVillages in the Levant under Ottoman rule remained isolated due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.\n\nInternational relations\nMany foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, as of 2010, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRamallah is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nPaul Ajlouny (b. 1933), Palestinian-American publisher and businessman\nHamze Awawde (b. 1990), Palestinian peace activist\nMahmoud Eid (b. 1993), professional footballer\nAmber Fares, Lebanese Canadian filmmaker\nYasmeen Mjalli (born 1996), American and Palestinian fashion designer, photographer and anti-street harassment activist.\nJibril Rajoub (b. 1953), Palestinian political leader, former militant\nMosab Hassan Yousef (b. 1978), Palestinian ex-militant and defector\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nEconomy of the State of Palestine\nAl-Ram, Palestinian town few km southeast of Ramallah\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRamallah City Archived October 16, 2012, at the Wayback Machine\nWelcome To The City of Ramallah\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:  IAA, Wikimedia commons\nRamallah History\nMusic and Art from Ramallah Archived January 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\nQuaker Meeting in Ramallah\nWest Bank/Palestine\nRamallah\nAl Kasaba Theatre\nKhalil Sakakini Cultural Centre\nFirst Ramallah Group\nRamallah International Film Festival Archived June 17, 2013, at the Wayback Machine\nRamallahOnline.com\nRamallah Club of Metro Detroit\nJnewswire.com, Ramallah ancient synagogue\nAnne Brunswic's book Welcome to Palestine, English translation",

      "content": "رام الله مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة رام الله والبيرة. تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الشمال من القدس بحوالي 15 كم، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 880 مترًا، وتبلغ مساحتها 16,5 كم²، بلغ عدد سكانها حوالي 38,998 نسمة، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان المحافظة حوالي 328,861 نسمة. تلاصق رام الله مدينة البيرة حتى تتداخل مبانيهما وشوارعهما لتبدوا كمدينة واحدة، ومع أن مدينة البيرة أكبر من حيث المساحة وعدد السكان، إلّا أن الأشهر بينهما هي مدينة رام الله.\n\nتحتل رام الله حاليًا مركزًا سياسيًا يجعلها من أهم المدن الفلسطينية، إذ إنها تُعتبر العاصمة الإدارية المؤقتة للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وفيها إلى جانب مدينة البيرة مقر الرئاسة الفلسطينية، ومبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، والمقرات العامة للأجهزة الأمنية الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، بالإضافة إلى معظم مكاتب ووزارات السلطة. كما تعتبر العاصمة الثقافية لوجود عدد من المراكز الثقافية الفلسطينية النشطة فيها.\nعُرفت المدينة بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار الصليبيين، ووفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن المدينة قد تأسست في القرن السادس عشر أثناء الحكم العثماني، والتي ازدهرت في آواخر أيامهم إذ تأسس أول مجلس بلدي فيها عام 1908. وقد احتفلت بلدية رام الله مؤخرا بمئويتها الأولى مطلقة مشروعًا تنمويًا بهذه المناسبة.\nتقع رام الله ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، حيث تطل على الساحل الفلسطيني للبحر المتوسط، والذي يبعد عن المدينة حوالي 45 كيلومترا إلى الغرب. أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر بين 770 مترًا. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخيًا منطقة مسيحية، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، مع وجود قوي لأقلية مسيحية.\n\nالتسمية\nتضاربت الأقوال عن تسمية رام الله إذ عرفت في التوراة باسم (رامَتايم صوفيم) وذكرها المؤرخ يوسيفوس باسم (فكولا)، وقيل (جلبات ايلوهم). وقد أثبت الأثريون عدم صحة هذه الأسماء لأن أمكنة الملوك التي نسبت إليهم مثل الملك صموئيل وشاؤول مختلفة عن المدينة الحالية.\nإلا أن هناك تفسيرات أقرب إلى الصحة إذ تعني كلمة رام المنطقة المرتفعة، وهي كلمة كنعانية منتشرة في أماكن مختلفة في فلسطين، وأضاف إليها العرب كلمة الله فأصبحت رام الله، وقد عرفها الصليبيون بهذا الاسم، ولكن الثابت تاريخيا أن قبيلة عربية جاءت في أواخر القرن السادس عشر وسكنت في قرية أو غابة حرجية اسمها رام الله.\n\nالتاريخ\nنظرا لأن رام الله والبيرة تمتدان عمرانيا بشكل متصل، إذ لا يمكن فصل تاريخ المدينتين عن بعضها الآخر، فمن الطبيعي أن يتم دراسة تاريخهما بشكل متكامل. وتشير الدراسات التاريخية والأثرية إلى أن قصة النبي يوسف قد حدثت في منطقة رام الله والبيرة، ولقد اختلف المؤرخون في تحديد البئر الذي ألقي فيه النبي يوسف، وعلى الرغم من هذا الاختلاف فإن موقع البيرة الحالي لا يبتعد كثيرا عن هذه التوقعات بسبب وقوعه على طريق القوافل المتجهة من الجنوب إلى الشمال أو بالعكس، وكان هذا الموقع الذي كانت تحط به الرحال طلباً للراحة والاستجمام وسعياً وراء الطعام والماء، وكان يوجد في البيرة نبع ماء قديم كان معروفا لتلك القوافل، ما حفز الأهالي في ذلك الوقت إلى إقامة أكثر من بناء لتزويد المسافرين بحاجاتهم من الطعام لقاء مال أو مبادلة تجارية، وقد ذكر الإنجيل أن السيد المسيح كان يمر بالبيرة في طريقه من القدس إلى الناصرة (تخلف مع فتيان البيرة الذين كانوا يلهون ويلعبون على نبع الماء وهكذا ضل عن أمه وعن يوسف النجار، مما اضطرها إلى العودة إلى القدس لكي تبحث عنه).\nعند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام في القرن السابع الميلادي دخلت البيرة في حوزة المسلمين، وبنى المسلمون في الفترة الإسلامية المبكرة مسجدين بالقرب من الخان ما زالا مستخدمين حتى اليوم، يعرف الأول منهما باسم «الجامع العمري»، وهو الجامع الملاصق لكنيسة العائلة المقدسة وسط البلدة القديمة، «وجامع العين» الواقع على عين شارع القدس- نابلس بالقرب من مبنى البلدية الحالي. وتغير مركز مدينة البيرة من عصر إلى آخر، ويبدو أن أقدم موقع استوطنه أهل البيرة هو منطقة الإرسال، ثم تل النصبة، ثم عين أم الشرايط، ثم موقع البلدة القديمة الحالي، أما الآن فقد توسعت حدود المدينة فشملت كل هذه المناطق. وفي سنة 1099 وقعت في أيدي الغزاة الفرنجة قبل احتلالهم لمدينة القدس، وأقاموا فيها فترة من الزمن وكانت مركزاً ممتازاً. في عام 1187 عبر جنود المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين البيرة ومن ثم استطاع صلاح الدين انتزاع القدس من أيدي الصليبين.\nكانت رام الله في فترة الحروب الصليبية مستعمرة زراعية إلى جوار البيرة، أطلق الصليبيون عليها اسم \"Ramallie\" أو \"Ramalie\" حيث توجد بقايا برج صليبي في البلدة القديمة لرام الله، ويقال أن رام الله وبعض البلدان الأخرى قد أوقف الملك قلاوون عُشر منتوجات أراضيها على حرم الخليل. إلا أنها لم تكن معروفة حتى القرن السادس عشر بسبب صغر مساحتها وقلة عدد سكانها بالمقارنة بالقرى المحيطة بها.\n\nالدولة العثمانية\nأسست مدينة رام الله على يد شيخ إحدى عشائر الكرك المسيحية يدعى الشيخ راشد الحدادين، قرر الجلو عن موطنه بسبب خلافات عشائرية في القرن السادس عشر. ويحكى أنه جلى من الكرك ليلا وبعد أيام دخل على أهل البيرة فرحبوا به. وأشاروا عليه بخربة اسمها رام الله لتكون موطنه. اشترى الشيخ راشد خربة رام الله من عائلات البيرة القدامى، دون أن يعلم أنه كان يؤسس لمدينة سيكون لها دور هام في تاريخ الفلسطينيين.\nوتجسد تماثيل الأسود الخمسة الواقعة في ساحة المنارة وسط مدينة رام الله تاريخ المدينة، حيث قام النحات أبو صادق غانم بنحتها لترمز لأبناء راشد الحدادين الخمسة، عواد، ويوسف، وجغب، وشقرة، وشراقة، والذين انبثقت منهم عائلات رام الله.\nوقد بدأ في رام الله مع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر تأسيس مدارس كانت من أولى المدارس النظامية في فلسطين، اسمها «الفرندز» وتعني (الأصدقاء)، وهي من المدارس التبشيرية التي بادرت إلى ايجادها جماعة الكويكرز وهي منظمة دينية مسيحية أميركية. وتضم مدرستين في رام الله والبيرة، الأولى للبنات وتعود للعام 1889 والأخرى للصبيان تعود للعام 1901. وكلتاهما تتبعان لمجلس أمناء واحد ويزيد عدد طلابهما الآن عن الألف.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت رام الله بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت رام الله مركزا لقضاء رام الله في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة. كانت المدنية قد ازدادت أهمية في هذه الفترة نتيجة ثلاثة تطورات مهمة: أولها إنشاء أعمدة الإرسال الشاهقة لـ «محطة الإذاعة الفلسطينية» من قبل حكومة الانتداب البريطانية عام 1936 على أراضي قرية البيرة التي يقع مدخلها على الشارع الرئيسي المتجه إلى قرية بيرزيت وقرى بني زيد. وهو الشارع الذي أصبح اسمه منذ ذلك الحين «شارع الإذاعة» أو «شارع الإرسال». وللشارع أهمية كبيرة في ذلك الوقت نظرا لوجود عدد من الفنادق «كفندق الحمراء» و«فندق حرب» وكان يجذب أهالي مدينة رام الله والقدس أيام الآحاد للاستمتاع بالجلوس في أحضان الطبيعة.\nأما التطور الثاني فقد جاء نتيجة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى 1936-1939، حيث أقامت حكومة الانتداب على غرار ما جرى في بقية المدن الفلسطينية، المبنى الضخم المعروف حاليا بمبنى المقاطعة (مبنى تجاري على اسم المهندس البريطاني الذي صمم هذه المباني لتستوعب الدوائر الحكومية والسجون ...الخ). وبالتالي فقد أصبحت معنية بتوسيع شبكة الطرق القريبة لتستوعب الضغط الناجم عن إنشاء هذا المبنى ومحطة الإذاعة. أما التطور الثالث فكان له علاقة بالهجرة إلى الأميركيتين من قبل سكان رام الله والبيرة وتعاظم ثروة أهل المدينتين مما أدى إلى توسع عمراني كبير على امتداد الشوارع الجديدة وخارج إطار المسطحات القديمة والمتراصة نسبيا.\nوقد أدت هذه التطورات إلى توسيع شبكة الطرق في المدينتين، وخصوصا توسيع وتعبيد طريق الإذاعة وإنجاز خريطة التنظيم الهيكلية لرام الله عام 1940. وهكذا أخذت شبكة الطرق المتفرعة عن الميدان شكلها النهائي رغم أن المنطقة المحيطة بالميدان ظلت في معظمها خالية أساسا من العمران. إذ لم تجر خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية تطورات عمرانية تذكر فظروف الحرب قد حالت دون الحصول على مواد البناء وخصوصا الاسمنت والحديد حيث احتفظت بهما حكومة الانتداب للأغراض الحربية.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكانت رام الله في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء رام الله، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\n\nالإدارة الأردنية\nوفي أوائل خمسينيات القرن العشرين خضعت رام الله للحكم الأردني بين حربي 1948 و1967، وأصبحت رام الله فيما بعد مركزا للواء رام الله التابع لمحافظة القدس. وقد كانت المدينة هادئة نسبيا خلال سنوات الحكم الأردني، وكان السكان يتمتعون بحرية الحركة بين الضفة الغربية والأردن ولبنان وسوريا وأماكن أخرى. وكان الأردن بضم الضفة الغربية، يطبق قانونه على الأرض. ومع ذلك، سجن كثير من الفلسطينيين لكونهم أعضاء في ما كانت الحكومة الأردنية تعتبره أحزاب سياسية غير مشروعة، بما في ذلك الحزب الشيوعي الفلسطيني وغيرها من الجماعات الاشتراكية والمؤيدة للاستقلال. وضع القانون الأردني قيودا على الإبداع والحرية المطلوبة من قبل العديد من الفلسطينيين في ذلك الوقت. بحلول عام 1953، تضاعف سكان رام الله، ولكنها لم تكن مجهزة للاقتصاد والبنية التحتية للتعامل مع تدفق القرويين الفقراء. غادر أهالي مدينة رام الله، في المقام الأول إلى الولايات المتحدة. ونظراً لكون مدينة رام الله مركز للواء فقد استأثرت بنصيب وافر من مراكز الخدمات الإدارية والتعليمية والصحية والاجتماعية والاقتصادية يشرف عليها المجلس البلدي والذي قام بتأسيس شركة المياه، وغرفة التجارة تأسست عام 1950م وغايتها تسهيل الأعمال التجارية.\n\nحرب 1967\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي رام الله وقراها وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات، وقد بلغ عدد المستوطنات حتى نهاية عام 1987م حوالي 30 مستوطنة، وأكبر هذه المستوطنات مستوطنة (ريمونيم) وهي قرية تعاونية أنشأت عام 1980م.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة رام الله بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع رام الله مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة رام الله قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nفي عام 1991، ضم الوفد الفلسطيني إلى مؤتمر مدريد للسلام الدولي العديد من وجهاء رام الله. كما خفت حدة الانتفاضة قدما، واستأنفت الحياة الطبيعية في رام الله. في ديسمبر 1995، وذلك تامشيا مع اتفاق أوسلو، تخلى الجيش الإسرائيلي عن المقاطعة وانسحب إلى ضواحي المدينة. تولت السلطة الفلسطينية التي أنشئت حديثا المدنية والمسؤولية الأمنية للمدينة، والتي اعتبرت «المنطقة أ» الخاضعة للاتفاقات.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 1994 تم نقل الحكم فيها للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية بموجب اتفاق أوسلو الموقع عام 1993، التي أُعلن بموجبه عن مناطق المدينة (دون القرى التابعة لها أو امتداداتها) أنها منطقة ألف (أ)؛ وهذه الأرض تخضع لسيطرة شبه كاملة من السلطة الفلسطينية. أصبحت رام الله المقر المؤقت للسلطة الفلسطينية، وبسبب رفض إسرائيل أن يكون مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في القدس الشرقية. وقد شهدت المدينة نهضة حضارية ومعمارية كبيرة في هذه الفترة.\nتعرّض كثير من تلك المقرات في رام الله إلى دمار كبير ألحقته آلة الحرب الإسرائيلية كجزء من الهجمات المستمرة على المدينة في فترة الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، مما أدّى إلى تعطيلها إلى حدِّ كبير، وعادت هذه المقرات للعمل في الفترة اللاحقة للاجتياح الإسرائيلي الكبير للمدينة في عام 2002 جاعلة رام الله العاصمة الإدارية (كأمر واقع) لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية. يشار بالذكر إلى أن حكومة نتنياهو شرعت في إعداد دراسة تهدف إلى إقناع الفلسطينيين بأهمية مدينة رام الله كعاصمة بديلة من القدس الشرقية. وتركز الدراسة على التذكير بمواقف إسحق رابين الذي ثبت مدينة القدس بقسميها الغربي والشرقي، عاصمة أبدية موحدة لدولة اليهود، ومع أنه وافق على فصل الشأن السياسي عن الشأن الديني، ووعد المسلمين والمسيحيين بممارسة شعائرهم في ظل القانون الإسرائيلي، إلا أنه أخضع وعده لضرورات الأمن القومي. لهذا السبب لم يسمح لياسر عرفات بزيارة القدس خوفاً من الجماهير التي ستستقبله.\n\nالجغرافيا\nرام الله مدينة جبلية، مبنية على جبال مطلة إلى الغرب على الساحل الفلسطيني، أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال. تبعد رام الله حوالي عشرة 15 كم إلى الشمال من القدس وتبعد المدينة عن البحر المتوسط الذي يرى من تلالها حوالي 45 كيلومترا هوائيا وكثيرا ما تشاهد منها أثناء النهار السفن الراسية، كما تبعد عن نهر الأردن قرابة 33 كم إلى الغرب. ونظرا لقرب البحر منها فإن الهواء الذي يهب عليها من الغرب يحمل معه بعض الرطوبة ولكن ارتفاع البلدة عن سطح البحر الذي يتراوح بين 830-880 مترا يلطف من هذه الرطوبة. وتبلغ مساحة مدينة رام الله 19 ألف دونم، واتخذت مجالس بلدية سابقة قرارا بتوسيع حدود المدينة إلى ألفي دونم أخرى.\nويتوسط موقع رام الله فلسطين التاريخية تقريبا، حيث تبعد عن نابلس 36 كم إلى الجنوب، وجنين 63 كم إلى الجنوب، والخليل 82 كم إلى الشمال، وغزة 82 كم إلى الشمال الشرقي، ويافا 45 كم إلى الشرق، وحيفا 105 كم إلى الجنوب الشرقي.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى 19 حيًا وهي: الريحان، الدبلوماسي، الكرينعة، الواد، النرجس، الطيرة، المصايف، الإذاعة، ردانا، عين مصباح، الجدول، قدورة، القديرة، الماصيون، عين منجد، باطن الهواء، مركز المدينة، البلدة القديمة والمنطقة الصناعية. أما بالنسبة للطرق، فتقطع رام الله عدة طرق تربط مناطقها ببعض، كما تربطها بالمدن الملتصقة بها كـالبيرة وبيتونيا، وباقي قرى ومدن فلسطين المجاورة كالقدس وبيت لحم ونابلس، والتي قامت بلدية رام الله بتسميتها على أسماء لمناطق وشخصيات فلسطينية أو عالمية، ومن أهم هذه الطرق:\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ رام الله هو مناخ متوسطي ففي الشتاء تتعرض البلدة للرياح الجنوبية الغربية القاسية الماطرة وأحيانا إلى رياح شمالية شرقية جافة باردة نسبيا. أما معدل سقوط الأمطار هو حوالي 20 إنشا أو 500 مليمتر في السنة. وعلى العموم فإن معدل درجة الحرارة في الشتاء نادرا ما يصل إلى 32 فهرنهايت أو صفر مئوي وفي الصيف قلما تزيد على 95 ف أو 35 درجة مئوية ويمكننا القول بأن معدل درجة الحرارة السنوي يتراوح بين 41-77 ف أو 5-25 م.\nوفي أوائل نيسان تأخذ الرياح الخماسينية بالهبوب وهذه رياح جافة تحمل معها كثيرا من الغبار وهي تأتينا من الجنوب وينقطع هبوب الرياح الخماسينية كلما اقترب فصل الصيف وتهب أيضا على البلدة رياح دافئة في أواخر الصيف وأوائل الخريف وتعجل بإنهاء موسمي العنب والتين. وعلى العموم فإن مناخ رام الله لطيف منعش في الصيف دافئ في الشتاء وهذا جعل الحياة فيها حياة نشاط وعمل.\n\nالسكان\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان المدينة في فترات مختلفة:\n\nيبلغ عدد سكان رام الله اليوم قرابة 30 ألف نسمة. وبالرغم من أن رام الله كانت مدينة صغيرة، إلا أن اللاجئين الفلسطينيين بعد النكبة عام 1948 شكلوا جزءا رئيسيا من التوزيع السكاني الجديد، كما أن الهجرة الداخلية وانتقال فلسطينيين للعمل في رام الله بعد قدوم سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية جراء تحولها إلى مركز إداري للسلطة زاد من عدد السكان المستقرين القادمين من مدن أخرى.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكان رام الله عام 1922م حوالي 3067 نسمة، وفي عام 1945م 5080 نسمة، وفي عام 1967م بلغ عدد سكانها حسب الإحصاء الإسرائيلي 12134 نسمة، ارتفع هذا العدد ليصل عام 1987م حوالي 24772 نسمة.\nتتمتع رام الله عن باقي المدن الفلسطينية باستمرارية وتعددية بالنشاطات الثقافية بين المهرجانات والندوات والمؤتمرات والمعارض، ويعود ذلك إلى عدة إسباب، أحدها تمركز عدد كبير من المؤسسات الناشطة في هذا المجال في مدينة رام الله إضافة إلى نشاط بلدية رام الله في هذا المجال ووجود وزارة الثقافة التابعة لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني في المدينة. وكذلك تنوع النسيج الثقافي الاجتماعي في المدينة وإتساع هامش الحرية مما جذب العديد من الشخصيات الثقافية إلى مدينة رام الله من مخرجين وكتّاب وشعراء.\nمن المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطان ومتحف محمود درويش والمركز الثقافي اليوناني والمؤسسة الفلسطينية للفن المعاصر والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي الألماني.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتعكس رام الله صورة مدينة مزدهرة تشهد حركة أعمال محمومة وفورة عقارية كست تلالها بالمباني، غير ان هذه المدينة التي تحتضن مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية تبقى استثناء في مشهد اقتصادي عام هش.\nولقد مارس سكان مدينة رام الله والبيرة العديد من الحرف منذ القدم، منها الزراعة وتربية المواشي حيث زرعوا العنب والتين والزيتون، واشتغل السكان في التجارة حيث تنقل التجار بين المدن والقرى المجاورة، كما اشتغل السكان في الصناعة مثل صناعة الأحذية والملابس والمواد الغذائية والفخار واستمر الحال حتى أوائل القرن العشرين، حيث اتجه السكان إلى الهجرة إلى أمريكا خصوصا الشباب منهم، فأخذت الأموال تتدفق على المدينة ليستثمرها السكان في شراء الأراضي وبناء العقارات لاستغلالها في السياحة، وازدادت حركة التعليم وما أن انتهت الحرب العالمية الثانية حتى وقعت حرب 1948 فكان معظم سكان المدينة قد هاجروا إلى أمريكا باستثناء 12% منهم بقوا في المدينة.\nتوجد حاليا العديد من الصناعات مثل صناعة الورق الصحي والكرتون والأثاث والمواد الغذائية وعصر الزيتون والصابون والألمنيوم والأدوية والكثير من الحرف اليدوية والتقليدية.\nأما بالنسبة للزراعة فقد اضمحلت بسبب هجرة السكان للأراضي الزراعية وتحويلها بنايات لتأخذ مكان البيوت القديمة وأصبحت المدينة تعج بمئات المحال التجارية الممتدة.\nومن الملاحظ أن تكلفة المعيشة في مدينة رام الله هي أعلى مستوى من نظيراتها في المحافظات الأخرى، ويمكن إرجاع السبب إلى عدة عوامل، أهمها وجود شريحة واسعة في رام الله يفوق مستوى دخلها معدل الدخل لباقي سكان رام الله وباقي سكان المحافظات الأخرى نظرا لعمل هذه الشريحة مع المؤسسات الأجنبية والدولية ما يجعلها قادرة على تحمّل هذه النفقات، وثانياً وجود عدد كبير من الأجانب العاملين في رام الله ذوي الدخل المرتفع جداً بالمقارنة مع المواطن العادي مما تسبب في زيادة الأسعار على كافة المستويات وبالذات العقار والمنافع الخدماتية كالمطاعم والقاعات، بالإضافة إلى وجود تحويلات شبه دائمة من المغتربين من سكان قراها الشرقية والتي معظم أفرادها مغتربون في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، وهنالك أمثلة صارخة للقرى الشرقية للمدينة التي حققت أعلى النسب في اغتراب أفرادها إلى الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. ويمكن اليوم أن يُقارن مستوى المعيشة في المدينة بنظيره في مدن عالمية أخرى. يشار إلى أنه يُقام كل عام معرضٌ للصناعات الفلسطينية في مدينة رام الله.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيمكن السفر إلى المدن المجاورة لرام الله بواسطة سيارة أجرة أو حافلات صغيرة. سيارات الأجرة متوفرة دائما في جميع أنحاء مدينة رام الله، كذلك بالنسبة للحافلات أو الحافلات الصغيرة. ويتنقل المواطنون الفلسطينيون بين رام الله والمدن والقرى المجاورة - منذ انتفاضة الأقصى - بصعوبة بالغة، حيث يعاني المواطن وفي كثيراً من الأحيان الامرّين حتى يصل إلى مبتغاه في الوقت المحدد وربما لا يصله إطلاقاً، مرد ذلك الإجراءات الإسرائيلية من حواجز واغلاقات.\nيقع جنوب رام الله في بلدة قلنديا، مطار القدس الدولي أو كما تشيع تسميته «مطار قلنديا»، يقع على أراضي محافظة القدس تحديداً في بلدة قلنديا على طريق (القدس - رام الله). يعتبر المطار أقرب إلى رام الله منه إلى مدينة القدس.\nأنشيء المطار عام 1920 تحت إدارة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين ثم في أوائل الخمسينيات وضع تحت الإدارة الأردنية بعد انضمام الضفة الغربية إلى المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، إلا أنه وقع بيد القوات الإسرائيلية في حرب 1967، والتي سرعان ما غيرت اسمه إلى «مطار عطاروت». ومنذ انتفاضة الأقصى والمطار مهمل بالرغم من أنه تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. شهد المطار حركة سياحية وتجارية نشطة في الخمسينيات والستينيات، وقد استخدمه الكثير من المسافرين وأصحاب الشخصيات الهامة مثل بابا الفاتيكان على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، وذلك لأهمية القدس الدينية والسياحية.\n\nالاتصالات\nتقع في رام الله مقرات شركات الاتصال الفلسطينية التي تزود الضفة الغربية بهذه الخدمة (جوال والوطنية موبايل). تأسست مجموعة الإتصالات الفلسطينية عام 1995 في رام الله، وكانت أول شركة اتصالات مملوكة للقطاع الخاص في العالم العربي وباشرت أعمالها في يناير عام 1997 كمشغل ومقدم لكافة أنواع خدمات الاتصالات في فلسطين. تتكون المجموعة اليوم من شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية، وشركة جوال المزود الفلسطيني الأول لخدمة الاتصال الخلوي في فلسطين وشركة «حضارة» لخدمات الاتصالات وتكنولوجيا المعلومات بالإضافة إلى شركة «حلول» لتكنولوجية المعلومات وشركة «بال ميديا» لتقديم الخدمات المرئية والإعلامية المميزة. بالإضافة إلى هذه الشركات تقوم شركة الوطنية موبايل بتزويد خدمات الاتصالات الخليوية أيضا، والتي اطلقت خدماتها تجارياً في 2009.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nتمتاز مدينة رام الله بغناها المعماري وتطورها الاجتماعي والذي انعكس عبر مبانيها وحاراتها وتجمع ساكنيها، حيث يشعر الزائر بمتابعة بصرية جميلة تعطيه الإحساس والشعور بكينونته كإنسان بمقاييسها الإنسانية والإحساس بالزمن ببعديه الماضي والمستقبلي للواجهات والأسقف والخانات والأزقة. وتعتبر المدينة أكبر تجمع من حيث عدد المباني القديمة في محافظة رام الله، بحيث تحتوي على 381 مبنى قديماً، وتشكل ما نسبته 5 % من عدد المباني الكلي في المحافظة، وتليها بذلك رنتيس، حيث تحتوي على 326 مبنى، ثم نعلين بـ 292 مبنى، ومن ثم عابود بـ 281 مبنى قديماً.\nوقد تأسس في بداية تسعينيات القرن الفائت، مركز معني بالحفاظ على الهوية المعمارية الفلسطينية القديمة في رام الله، اسمه: مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\"، والذي عمل على تحضير مخططات حماية للمباني في التجمعات، وبخاصة تلك التي ما زالت تحافظ على مراكزها ونسيجها المعماري القديم، وكذلك تلك التي تحتوي على عدد كبير من المباني القديمة، بحيث تتم حماية أكبر نسبة ممكنة من المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية بعض التجمعات، ولذلك يمكن حماية ما نسبته 35.41 % من عدد المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية التجمعات التي تحتوي على أكثر من 200 مبنى قديم.\nوقد قامت وحدة التخطيط في مركز رواق، باعداد مخطط الحفاظ على التراث الثقافي للبلدة القديمة في رام الله. حيث تم تعيين حدود وجميع فئات التراث الثقافي في المنطقة التاريخية (من مباني تاريخية، وأحواش، وأزقة...ألخ) وذلك بناءً على الدراسة الميدانية التي قام بها فريق العمل في الموقع.\nنتيجة ذلك تم تقسيم البلدة القديمة إلى منطقتين: «منطقة تاريخية أ» والتي تتميز بنسيج معماري تقليدي وعدد كبير من المباني التاريخية، و«منطقة تاريخية ب» والتي لم تعد تحتفظ بنسيج معماري تقليدي بالرغم من وجود عدد لا بأس به من المباني التاريخية. هذا وتم تعين كل المباني التاريخية المنفردة خارج هاتين المنطقتين.\nكما وتم وضع مسودة أحكام خاصة لتنظيم أعمال البناء في تللك المناطق، والتي تم نقاشها مطولاً مع لجنة أحياء البلدة القديمة المكونة من أعضاء في مجلس بلدية رام الله. هذا وتم اقرار جزء من هذه الأحكام من قبل لجنة التنظيم في البلدية.\n\nالثقافة والسياحة\nإن ما يميز مدينة رام الله هو هذا التناغم والتنوع والاختلاف في إطار الوحدة، ولكثرة من رغب بالسكن في رام الله بسبب هذا الميل العام نحو قبول الآخر، جعل منها مكان جذب للكثيرين من مختلف المناطق والبيئات والأديان ممن بحثوا عن الأمن والأمان. وقد خلق هذا الأمر أيضاً تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً فريداً، ووجد الجميع فيه ما يصبون إليه فتشكلت هذه المدينة المنوعة في ثقافتها وتوجهاتها في إطار من التواصل الغريب.\nتعتبر رام الله مركز للحياه الثقافية والأكثر انفتاحا وليبرالية في الضفة الغربية، ما دفع البعض إلى تسميتها «روح الثقافة» فهي تضم العديد من المكتبات مثل: مكتبة دار الإذاعة ومكتبة رام الله العامة بالإضافة إلى العديد من المراكز الثقافية على تنوعها، فهناك العاملة في إطار الفنون البصرية، أو السينما أو المسرح، أو الرقص الشعبي والمعاصر، أو الشعر والأدب والنشر، أو المؤسسات الموسيقية.\nوتعتبر رام الله مركزا للعديد من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية كالمركز الثقافي الألماني الفرنسي، والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، والمركز الثقافي اليوناني.\nولتطريز الأثواب في رام الله نكهة خاصة فهي لغة للتعبير وحالة نادرة ومميزة عن بقية المناطق الأخرى، بحيث يدمج بين الأشكال الهندسية والمجردة المستطيلة (كالمربعات، والنجوم) وبين الصور الرمزية، ما يعكس الحياة اليومية لأهل رام الله وسكانها. ومن أهم المهرجانات التي تقام خصيصا من أجل الحفاظ على هذا التراث، مهرجان الوفاء للتراث وارث الأجداد السنوي الذي ينظمه نادي شباب رام الله، حيث يتم تنظيم عرضاً للأزياء التراثية الفلسطينية.\nكما وتضم عددا من المراكز الرياضية، والأندية الشبابية الفاعلة، والتي يعود تأسيس بعضها إلى بدايات القرن الماضي، في حين تضم بعض هذه الأندية فرقا كشفية عريقة كان لها حضورها على مدار التاريخ الفلسطيني. من المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطّان، والتي تعمل على تفعيل الحياة الثقافية في فلسطين من خلال إنتاج أعمال مسرحية واستضافة عروض فنية في مجالات المسرح والموسيقى والرقص بالإضافة إلى عرض الأفلام السينمائية اليومية وتنظيم الأسابيع والمهرجانات السينمائية المتخصصة.\nوتضم رام الله كذلك، عددا من الجمعيات الخيرية، النسوية في مجملها، ويعود تأسيس بعضها إلى أربعينيات القرن الماضي، وتهدف هذه الجمعيات التي تضاعفت أعدادها مرارا في العقدين الأخيرين، إلى توفير الدعم للعديد من فئات المجتمع، ومن بينها المرأة، الطفل، كبار السن، ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة، الأيتام، وغيرهم.\n\nتعتبر مدينة رام الله واحدة من المدن الفلسطينية التي يؤمها السياح، وتشكل وجهة رئيسية لهم في جولاتهم السياحية، ولا بد للسائح أن يزور مواقعها الأثرية التي تقسم إلى: أنقاض بناء أثري فيه بقايا برج من حقبة الصليبيين يقع في وسط المدينة، وآثار كنيسة بيزنطية في المدينة.\nوبالرغم من أن المدينة ليست من المدن القديمة جدا إلا أنها تعد أكثر المناطق الفلسطينية جذبا للزائرين على المستوى العالمي والعربي عامة والفلسطينيين خاصة، آخذين بعين الاعتبار أن هذه المدينة مركزا اقتصاديا مهما، وخاصة بعد أن أصبحت مقرا للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية، ومركزا للمؤسسات الأجنبية، والممثليات الدبلوماسية، كما ومقرا لمؤسسات ووزارات السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية...الخ، مما ساهم بشكل فعال في تطور هذه المدينة من كافة النواحي وخاصة سياحيا، فازدحام المدينة يعني بناء المرافق السياحية الكبيرة والحديثة القادرة على تلبية احتياجات ساكنيها، وهذا من شأنه أن يزيد الدخل القومي بشكل كبير. ويوجد في المدينة مركزا معني بالسياحة هو مركز رام الله للمعلومات السياحية الذي تأسس بدعم سويدي وبالتعاون مع وزارة السياحة الفلسطينية ومركز رواق للمعمار الشعبي. وهناك الكثير من الآثار الواقعة في قرى وبلدات قضاء رام الله، فمثلا توجد قلعة حصينة لا تزال آثارها ظاهرة حتى الآن في بيرزيت، مبنى عثماني ضخم في قرية رأس كركر، وآثار كنيسة وقطع معمارية تعود إلى الفترات البيزنطية في قرية جفنا، كما يوجد في قرية عابود الكثير من الأديرة والكنائس المندثرة منذ عهد هيلانة وإبنها قسطنطين، وفيها أيضا مسجد قديم وكنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس. ويزور رام الله سنويا 300,000 سائح. يشار إلى أن السياحة في المدينة كغيرها من مدن فلسطين، تواجه العديد من المشاكل والعقبات، ولعل أول تلك العقبات هو الاحتلال الإسرائيلي الذي يؤثر سلبا بدعاياته المغرضة على السياح الأجانب، ويسعى إلى ضرب قطاع السياحة في المدينة. كذلك ينافس الإسرائيليون السياحة الفلسطينية نظرا لخبرتهم في التسويق.\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nبدأ التعليم في رام الله في مدرسة للروم الاورثوذكس أنشاتها البطريركية في القدس حوالي 1840، عندما حضر مبشر من طائفة البروتستانت اسمه صموئيل غوبات وأسس خمس مدارس إحداها في رام الله، وهي مدرسة تبشيرية، بينما كانت الأولى الأرثوذكسية مدرسة وطنية، وظلت مدرسة غوبات مفتوحة حتى قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى، وفي سنة 1857 قدم اللاتين إلى رام الله، وافتتحوا لهم مدرسة لم تعمر طويلا، أما عن مدارس الإناث، فقد أسست جماعة الفرندز في عام 1889 أول مدرسة من نوعها للإناث في رام الله. والأولى من نوعها في فلسطين، وكان افتتاح هذه المدرسة حافزاً للروم الأرثوذكس لإنشاء مدرسة للبنات، وحذا حذوهم اللاتين، وفي عام 1901 افتتح الفرندز مدرسة البنين في رام الله.\nوفي رام الله اليوم ثلاث مدارس حكومية للذكور ومدرستان للإناث، وبعد عام 1950 افتتحت بعض المعاهد مثل معهد المعلمات الحكومي والحق بالمعهد مدرسة للتطبيقات والتجارب التربوية والتعليم فيها مختلط، ولوكالة الغوث أربع مدارس للذكور ومدرستان للإناث في رام الله كما يتبع وكالة الغوث مركز لتدريب المعلمين والفتيات وهناك سبع مدارس خاصة مختلطة وثلاث مدارس خاصة للإناث وواحدة للذكور ودار لرعاية الأحداث وكلية بيرزيت التي تحولت إلى جامعة وتعتبر من أهم الجامعات الفلسطينية.\nكما أن مدينة رام الله تعتبر مركزاً للنشاط الثقافي في الضفة الغربية إذ تمتلئ بالمسارح ودور السينما والمراكز الثقافية، وفيها المعهد الوطني للموسيقى ومجموعة كبيرة من المنتديات الثقافية.\nالتعليم العالي\nتقع في محافظة رام الله واحدة من الجامعات المميزة فلسطينيا وعربيا، وهي جامعة بيرزيت. يعود تاريخ جامعة بيرزيت إلى عام 1924 عندما تأسست كمدرسة ابتدائية، وكان الهدف الرئيسي للمدرسة توفير فرص التعليم الأولية للفتيات من بيرزيت والقرى المجاورة في وقت انعدمت فيه المدارس تقريباً في تلك المنطقة.\nتطورت المدرسة لتصبح كلية عام 1942، ولما كانت الكلية عندئذ هي المؤسسة الجامعية الوحيدة في المنطقة، فقد قررت التركيز على التعليم الجامعي، وتقرر أن تصبح الكلية نتيجة لذلك «جامعة بيرزيت» في 1972.\n\nالرياضة\nتلعب في محافظة رام الله العديد من الأندية سواء على مستوى كرة القدم أو كرة السلة، منها: مؤسسة شباب البيرة، دير عمار، الجلزون، شباب الامعري، أرثوذكسي رام الله، سلواد، بدو، بيت سيرا، وبير زيت الرياضي. ويشارك بعضها في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز. ويوجد في المدينة ملعبا بلديا يتسع لعدة الآف.\nيقام في مدينة رام الله سباق ماراثون يحمل اسم «القدس عاصمة فلسطين الأبدية»، وذلك رداً على سباق مماثل أقيم في المدينة المحتلة بمشاركة آلاف العدائين الإسرائيليين والأجانب وسط موجة غضب في الشارع الفلسطيني. كما بدأت بلدية رام الله بأعمال الإنشاء لمشروع صالة رام الله الرياضية. ويأتي مشروع الصالة الرياضية كجزء من الخطة التنموية للبلدية.\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من رام الله الكثير من المشاهير الفلسطينيين منهم:\n\nكمال ناصر: سياسي وشاعر فلسطيني شارك في إصدار جريدة (البعث) كما أصدر مجلة الجيل الجديد عام 1949 في القدس. انتخب عام 1969 عضواً في اللجنة التنفيذية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، واغتيل من قبل قوة كوماندوز إسرائيلية وهناك قاعة ومسرح يحملان اسمه في جامعة بيرزيت.\nكريم حنا خلف: ترأس مجلس بلدية رام الله عام 1972 بعد فوزه بالانتخابات. كان عضوا بارزا في الجبهة الوطنية الفلسطينية وقياديا بارزا في لجنة التوجيه الوطني التي كانت تشرف بتوجيه من منظمة التحرير على النضال الوطني ضد الاحتلال.\nموسى حديد: مهندس، شغل منصب رئيس مجلس بلدي رام الله بين عامي 2012 و2022. كما يرأس الاتحاد الفلسطيني للهيئات المحلية للدورة الثانية على التوالي.\nخليل أبو ريا: مدرس وأديب ومرب معروف في رام الله إذ ترك أثرا كبيرا في عقول ونفوس وذكريات الكثيرين من أبناء هذه المدينة. وضع كتابا بعنوان «رام الله قديما وحديثا». وهو المؤسس والمالك للكلية الوطنية، أهم مدارس رام الله.\nفؤاد عيسى شطارة: طبيب فلسطيني. اهتم بالقضايا الوطنية والسياسية وشارك في تأسيس الجمعية التهذيبية السورية التي اهتمت بتعليم الطلاب العرب المتفوقين من الفقراء. وترأس جمعية النهضة الفلسطينية للدفاع عن قضية فلسطين كما ترأس عام 1936 الجامعة العربية في نيويورك.\nبولس شحادة: كاتب وصحفي، أسس جريدة مرآة الشرق في القدس 1919 وهي جريدة يومية سياسية اجتماعية تصدر باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية.\nنسيب شاهين: قام بتأليف كتاب مصور عن رام الله احتوى 445 صورة من أصل 600 صورة.\nمصطفى البرغوثي: أمين عام المبادرة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتميم البرغوثي: أحد أشهر الشعراء الشباب في فلسطين والوطن العربي. وهو ابن الشاعر مريد البرغوثي والكاتبة رضوى عاشور.\nمروان البرغوثي قيادي في حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني فتح، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nأحمد سعدات: أمين عام الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nحنان عشراوي: سياسية فلسطينية، كانت أحد أعضاء الوفد الفلسطيني المفاوض في مؤتمر مدريد عام 1991.\nسعاد العامري: أحد أشهر المعماريات الفلسطينيات. تعمل على الحفاظ على الموروث المعماري الفلسطيني من خلال مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\" والذي تديره منذ 1991.\nمحمد صالح البرغوثي أسس الجمعية العربية السرية ثم أسس حزب البعث في فلسطين وأصبح رئيساً له ثم اتجه إلى الحزب الوطني ثم إلى حزب الاستقلال، توفى عام 1970.\nخليل محمد عيسى أحد قادة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى.\n\nالمعالم\nرام الله تحت الاحتلال\nمنذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية للفلسطينيين ضد الاحتلال الإسرائيلي واجتياح جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مدن الضفة الغربية في خريف عام 2000، كانت مدينة رام الله من المدن الرئيسية في مواجهة العمليات الإسرائيلية بعد مدن جنين، نابلس، طولكرم، الخليل، هذا وقد فرضت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية حظر التجول على المدينة، وخنقت سكانها وعزلتهم عن مدينة القدس حيث يقطن الكثير من أقربائهم.\nو تعيش مدينة رام الله اليوم ظروف صعبة، بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي ومصادرة الكثير من أراضيها من قبل الاحتلال بواسطة جدار الفصل العنصري، والمستوطنين اليهود.\nومع مرور سنوات عديدة على الانتفاضة الثانية، إلا أن مدينة رام الله وأهلها نجحوا في الحفاظ على نشاط اقتصادي عالي وثقافي مميز، مما جعل المدينة أفضل المدن الفلسطينية حالا في ظل الاحتلال.\n\nالمخيمات\nيوجد في منطقة رام الله، 4 مخيمات 3 منها مُسجلة رسميا في وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) وواحد غير مسجل، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفة الغربية، فقد بُني معظمها فوق قطعة من الأرض قامت الأونروا باستئجارها من الحكومة الأردنية. والمخيمات هي:\n\nمخيم الأمعري: قام الصليب الأحمر بتأسيس مخيم الأمعري في عام 1949 ضمن حدود بلدية البيرة، حيث قام بتوفير الخيام للاجئين الذين قدموا من مدن اللد ويافا والرملة، بالإضافة إلى الذين لجئوا من قرى بيت دجن ودير طريف وأبو شوشة والنعاني وصيدون وجمزو وبيت نبالا. وقد تسلمت الأونروا مسؤولية المخيم في عام 1950 وعملت على بناء وحدات سكنية ذات أسقف اسمنتية. وبحلول عام 1957، كانت الأونروا قد أتمت استبدال كافة الخيام بالمساكن الاسمنتية؛ حيث حصلت العائلات التي لا يزيد عدد أفرادها عن خمسة أشخاص على مسكن مؤلف من غرفة واحدة فيما حصلت العائلات الأكبر على مساكن من غرفتين. واليوم، فإن المخيم يغطي مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,93 كيلومتر مربع، ويفصل بين معظم المساكن مساحة تقل عن نصف متر؛ الأمر الذي يجعل التهوية داخل المخيم ضعيفة للغاية. ويرتبط المخيم بشكل كامل بشبكتي الماء والكهرباء البلدية.\nمخيم الجلزون: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.25 كيلومتر مربع على تلة صخرية تبعد مسافة 7 كيلومترات شمال رام الله. وينحدر أصل سكان المخيم من 36 قرية تابعة لمناطق اللد والرملة. وأصبح المخيم تحت السيطرة الإسرائيلية الفلسطينية المشترك في أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو. وتتصل كافة المساكن بالبنية التحتية لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامة.\nمخيم دير عمار: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.16 كيلومتر مربع على بعد 30 كيلومتر إلى الشمال الغربي من رام الله. وقد بني المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض تعود ملكيتها لسكان قرية دير عمار غير اللاجئين. وفي المقابل، فإن منشآت الأونروا في المخيم تعمل على توفير خدماتها للقرويين من غير اللاجئين.\nوتنحدر أصول سكان المخيم من القرى المدمرة التابعة لمناطق الرملة ويافا واللد. وفي أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو، أصبح المخيم واقعا تحت السيطرة المشتركة الفلسطينية الإسرائيلية.\n\nمخيم قدورة: يقع داخل مدينة رام الله بالقرب من مستشفى رام الله الحكومي من جهة الشمال، يبلغ عدد سكانه في منتصف العام 2023 نحو 1040 لاجئ حسب تقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. معظم سكان المخيم من المدن والقرى المهجرة عام 1948 منها: دير طريف، واللد، والسافرية، وبيت نبالا، والرملة، ولفتا، وأبو غوش، والقباب، ويافا، وسلمة، وزكريا، والحديثة، وعمواس، ويالو؛ ومن نازحي عام 1967.\n\nالمستوطنات\nما ان اندلعت حرب 1967 والتي كانت نتائجها احتلال ما تبقى من ارض فلسطين - الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، حتى سارعت إسرائيل في وضع الخطط بهدف اقامة العديد من المستوطنات. وكانت رام الله جزءا من هذا المخطط، حيث بنت إسرائيل في منطقة رام الله حوالي 27 مستوطنة وهي:\nمستوطنات تتوسط مجموعة من البلدات الفلسطينية وهي: المدية، نعلين، دير قديس، حزما، عين حارث، بلعين، أم صفا وبيت سيرا:\n\nمكابيم أب\nكفار روث\nمستوطنة منورة\nشلتا نتتياهو\nحشمونائيم\nكريات سيفر\nوهناك مستوطنات تطوق مدينة رام الله وتسيطر على معظم أراضيها، وهي من الشرق:\n\nتلمون\nياد يائير\nبيت حورون\nجفعات زئيف\nبيت إيل\nبسجوت\nكوخاف يعقوب\nومن الجنوب:\n\nمستوطنة عطروت\nجفعون\nجفعات حداشا أ\nجبعات حدشاة ب\nأما التجمع الاستيطاني شمال شرق رام الله، فيضم مستوطنات: عوفرا، بيت إيل أ، بيت إيل بمعسكر (باعل حتسور)، الذي يطل على منطقة الأغوار الوسطى وأريحا والبحر الميت، على ارتفاع 800 متر عن سطح البحر، وهو ذو أهمية إستراتيجية؛ نظراً لارتفاعه وإشرافه على مساحات واسعة من مناطق وسط الضفة، ويبلغ عدد المستوطنين في ذلك التجمع نحو 5370 مستوطناً. ويشغل مساحة تبلغ أكثر من 2000 دونم.\n\nمدن متوأمة\nالمدن الشقيقة لرام الله هي:\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\n\nموقع بلدية رام الله\nغرفة تجارة وصناعة محافظة رام

      "content": "Ramallah (en arabe : رام الله) est une ville palestinienne située au centre de la Cisjordanie, territoire occupé par Israël depuis 1967. Elle est la capitale administrative de facto de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne ; la capitale officielle, Jérusalem-Est, ayant été annexée par Israël en 1982.\nLa population, initialement composée principalement de Palestiniens chrétiens, comprend, depuis 1948, de nombreux réfugiés musulmans issus de toute la Palestine. L'estimation de la population de la ville, pour 2025, est de 45 644 habitants. Ses habitants s'appellent les Ramallawi.\nYasser Arafat est inhumé dans un mausolée situé dans l'enceinte de la Mouqata'a, quartier général de l'Autorité palestinienne, situé dans la ville.\n\nHistoire\nLes premiers temps\nLa ville de Ramallah fut fondée au milieu du XVe siècle par les Haddadéens, tribu issue des Arabes chrétiens ghassanides. Les Haddadéens, menés par Rached Haddadéen, sont arrivés de l'Est du Jourdain, près de l'emplacement contemporain de la ville jordanienne de Chawbak. La migration de cette tribu est due aux nombreux combats et tensions entre les clans de cette région.\nSelon la légende locale, le frère de Rached, Sabri l'Haddadéen, accueillait l'émir Ibn Kaysoom, chef d'un puissant clan musulman, quand la femme de Sabri donna naissance à une fille. Selon la coutume, l'émir proposa qu'elle se marie à son tout jeune fils quand ils seraient tous deux adultes. Sabri crut que cette proposition n'était pas sérieuse, les mariages entre chrétiens et musulmans étant rares, et lui donna sa parole. Des années après, quand l'émir revint voir les Haddadéens pour qu'ils tiennent leur promesse, ils refusèrent. Ceci déclencha une guerre sanglante entre les deux familles. Les Haddadéens fuirent vers l'ouest et s'établirent dans les collines de Ramallah, où vivaient déjà quelques familles musulmanes.\n\nInstallation chrétienne\nTout au long des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, Ramallah s'agrandit pour devenir un village agricole, attirant ainsi davantage d'habitants (surtout chrétiens) de toute la région. Au début du XVIIIe siècle, la première église orthodoxe arabe est bâtie, puis une autre en 1807. Il y a entre huit-cents et neuf-cents habitants en 1838.\nL'église de l'Épiphanie, édifiée pour remplacer l'ancienne en 1852, est la seule église orthodoxe à Ramallah aujourd'hui. Durant cette décennie, l'Église catholique s'établit dans la ville, devenant le deuxième groupe chrétien à Ramallah. Elle établit l'école de filles Saint-Joseph, ainsi que le lycée mixte al-Ahliyyah, tenu par les religieuses du Rosaire.\nLes quakers anglais arrivent en 1869 et ouvrent une école de filles et un internat d'une quinzaine de garçons en 1901.\n\nÉglises de Ramallah\nÉglise Notre-Dame-de-l'Annonciation (melkite) 1895\nÉglise de l'Épiphanie (grecque-orthodoxe)\nÉglise de la Sainte-Famille (catholique latine)\nCathédrale copte-orthodoxe\nÉglise de l'Espérance (luthérienne-évangélique)\nMaison de prières des quakers\n\nDébut du XXe siècle\nLes autorités ottomanes construisent en 1901 une nouvelle route de Jérusalem à Naplouse passant par Ramallah et Al-Bireh. La jeunesse chrétienne de la ville commence à émigrer aux États-Unis au début du XXe siècle. La ville devient un district en 1902, englobant trente villages et bourgades des alentours.\nLa ville de Ramallah devient une municipalité en 1908 et Élias Odeh en est le premier maire. Le conseil municipal est composé de membres de chaque grande famille.\nAu début de la Première Guerre mondiale, les habitants se rebellent contre l'autorité ottomane. Trente habitants sont tués. En 1915, une invasion de criquets migrateurs détruit les récoltes et l'année suivante, une épidémie de typhoïde décime 30 % de la population.\n\nOccupation britannique et débuts de l'État d'Israël\nRamallah, comme toutes les localités palestiniennes, est sous l'autorité du mandat britannique à partir de novembre 1917 (le mandat est imposé en 1920, auparavant ce sont des forces d'occupation), jusqu'en 1948, date de la fondation de l'État d'Israël. L'électrification de la ville est totalement terminée en 1936. Des milliers de réfugiés, majoritairement musulmans, s'installent aux abords de la ville en 1948.\nRamallah fait partie des Territoires occupés après la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nSous l'influence des migrations de réfugiés palestiniens, musulmans et chrétiens, de nouvelles mosquées et églises sont construites. La mosquée Jamal-Abdel-Nasser dans la ville adjacente de Al-Bireh est l'une des plus grandes de l'agglomération. Les coptes-orthodoxes ont construit une nouvelle église sur les hauteurs de la ville. Il existe aussi une église melkite catholique, une église luthérienne-évangélique, une église épiscopalienne, une église baptiste, etc. Les chrétiens représentent aujourd'hui 25 % de la population de l'agglomération totale et les réfugiés palestiniens 60 % (surtout aux abords de la ville).\n\nRamallah après 1972\nEn 1967, à la suite de la Guerre des Six Jours, tous les territoires palestiniens sont conquis par Israël. Les premières élections municipales depuis le début de l'occupation ont lieu en 1972. Dix ans plus tard, le maire Karim Khalaf est victime d'une tentative d'assassinat par des extrémistes israéliens, tout comme le maire de Naplouse et le maire d'Al-Bireh[réf. souhaitée]. Le conseil municipal suspend son administration.\n\nLa première intifada éclate en 1987. La même année, la première opération à cœur ouvert à l'hôpital est réalisée par le docteur Shawqi Harb.\nL'armée israélienne évacue Ramallah en 1996 et l'Autorité palestinienne installe son administration, un nouveau conseil municipal est réuni.\n\nLa seconde intifada commence en 2000 et se poursuit jusqu'en 2005. En 2002, le quartier commence à être bombardé. Bien que cette solution soit considérée à la base comme provisoire, Ramallah est devenue de facto la capitale de l'Autorité palestinienne. En décembre 2001, Arafat tient des réunions à la Mouqata'a, tout en vivant avec sa femme et sa fille à Gaza. Après des attentats suicides à Haïfa, Arafat est obligé de rester dans l'enceinte du gouvernement à Ramallah.\nLa région fait face à la pression continue de la colonisation israélienne. En 2023, les habitants de la plupart des communautés du territoire situé entre Ramallah et Jéricho, d'une superficie de 150 000 dounams [15 000 hectares], ont été contraints de fuir lorsque les colons, notamment les Jeunes des collines, ont commencé à construire rapidement des avant-postes pastoraux et à commettre des violences contre les résidents avec le soutien de Tsahal et des institutions de l'État israélien.\n\nÉconomie\nCette ancienne petite ville chrétienne est l'épicentre de l'activité économique palestinienne, laquelle doit beaucoup à l'aide internationale et aux capitaux de la diaspora. La ville doit aussi beaucoup au Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne Salam Fayyad, artisan de son essor fulgurant.\nTrois cent cinquante salariés travaillent à l'usine Coca-Cola de Ramallah. La firme américaine est ainsi l'un des plus gros employeurs de la ville.\n\nDescription de la ville\nÀ Ramallah, fulgurant développement économique et fulgurant développement démographique vont de pair. La ville, qui attire les habitants d'autres cités de Cisjordanie (Naplouse, Jéricho, Hébron…) ne cesse de croître. Surtout en hauteur, car les restrictions imposées par Israël rendent presque impossible toute construction en périphérie.\nLa ville est un chantier à ciel ouvert. La frénésie immobilière ne connaît pas de répit et la spéculation fait flamber les prix : le montant du mètre carré a triplé entre 2005 et 2010. La croissance de la demande de logements est de nature exponentielle. Mais l'offre reste très limitée : les contraintes administratives imposées par Israël sont très lourdes, l'État hébreu ne délivre les permis de construire qu'au compte-gouttes, et dans des zones très restreintes.\nRamallah est devenue une capitale de facto, hébergeant les institutions politiques : résidence du président de l'Autorité palestinienne Mahmoud Abbas, QG de l'Autorité palestinienne, ministères…\nLa ville n'en reste pas moins une enclave dont on s'évade très difficilement. À chaque entrée de la ville, des barrages de Tsahal, l'armée israélienne, filtrent les allées et venues des Palestiniens. Du moins, ceux qui disposent d'un permis pour sortir. Au check point de Qalandia, principal passage vers Jérusalem, on reconnaît les véhicules autorisés à quitter la Cisjordanie à leur plaque jaune (israéliennes). Les plaques vertes (palestiniennes), elles, ne permettent aucune incursion en territoire israélien. À Qalandia, l'attente est souvent interminable, une heure trente en moyenne, pour parcourir les dix kilomètres qui séparent Ramallah de Jérusalem.\n\nCulture\nLe théâtre Al-Kasaba est un organisme culturel de cinéma, de théâtre, de musique et de danse créé en 1970.\nDepuis 2004, le centre culturel franco-allemand de Ramallah réunit deux structures en un seul lieu : l'Institut Goethe des Territoires palestiniens et une antenne de l'Institut français de Jérusalem. En plus de proposer aux Ramallawi l’apprentissage des langues de Molière et de Goethe, cet ICFA abrite un Makerspace, un studio d’enregistrement, un espace scénique et le Kultur Cafe.\n\nMusique\nDans les camps de réfugiés de Jénine, Deir Ghassaneh, Kalandia et Jalazone, en Cisjordanie mais aussi de Chatila et de Bourj el-Barajneh à Beyrouth, l'école de musique de l'association Al Kamandjâti, fondée à Angers en 2002 et installée à Ramallah en 2008 par Ramzi Aburedwan, forme des apprentis interprètes. Plus de 150 élèves s'inscrivent chaque année aux cours de théorie de la musique et d’apprentissage d'un ou plusieurs instruments. L'association fournit instruments, pupitres et partitions. Les cours sont assurés par des musiciens étrangers comme ceux de l'Orchestre arabo-andalou d'Anjou, de l'Orchestre de chambre de Paris ou comme le chef Diego Masson qui encadrent les jeunes bénévolement. Des concerts sont organisés en Cisjordanie mais parfois aussi en Israël, souvent annulés en raison des conflits.\nUn concert hautement symbolique a eu lieu en août 2005, à Ramallah : celui de l'Orchestre Divan occidental-oriental, dirigé par Daniel Barenboïm et cofondé par Edward Saïd (décédé en 2003), qui rassemble de jeunes musiciens Israéliens, Arabes et Espagnols[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGouvernement\nAujourd'hui Ramallah est la ville où se trouve le plus de sièges des missions diplomatiques auprès de l'Autorité palestinienne. C'est le cas de l'Afrique du Sud, l'Allemagne, l'Argentine, l'Australie, l'Autriche, le Brésil, le Canada, la Chine, la Corée du Sud, le Danemark, la Finlande, l'Inde, l'Irlande, le Japon, la Jordanie, le Mexique, la Norvège, les Pays-Bas, la Pologne, le Portugal, la Russie, le Sri Lanka, la Suisse et la République tchèque.\n\nPersonnalités\nYasser Arafat (1929-2004), activiste et homme d'État palestinien. Il représente les Palestiniens dans les différentes négociations de paix et signe les accords d'Oslo en 1993. Il devient le premier président de la nouvelle Autorité palestinienne et reçoit le prix Nobel de la paix 1994 en compagnie de Shimon Peres et Yitzhak Rabin. Il est inhumé à la Mouqata'a, son dernier quartier général de Ramallah, le gouvernement israélien ayant refusé qu'il soit enterré à Jérusalem.\nJanette Khoury, née en 1945, femme politique palestinienne.

      "content": "## Overview\nRamallah or Ram Allah (Arabic رام الله Rāmallāh) is a small city in the West Bank region of the Palestinian Territories, located 15 km (10 miles) north of Jerusalem. Since the inception of the Palestinian National Authority, Ramallah has acted as the de facto capital city of the Palestinian administration. The neighboring town of Al-Bireh has over the years fused together with Ramallah and is covered in this article too.\n\n## Understand\nModern Ramallah was founded in the mid-16th century by the Haddadins, a Jordanian tribe of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christian Arabs. The Haddadins, led by Rashid Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River near the Jordanian town of Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is blamed for fighting and unrest among clans in that area. According to living descendants of the original Haddadin family members, Rahid's brother Sabra Haddadin was hosting Emir Ibn Kaysoom, head of a powerful Muslim clan in the region, when Sabra's wife gave birth to a baby girl. According to custom, the Emir proposed a betrothal to his own young son when they came of age. Sabra believed the proposal was in jest, as Muslim-Christian marriages were not customary, and gave his word. When the Emir later came to the Haddadins and demanded that they fulfill their promise, they refused. This set off bloody conflict between the two families. The Haddadins fled west and settled on the hilltops of Ramallah, where only a few Muslim families lived at the time. Today the town has a Muslim majority, but Ramallah retains its title as a historically Christian Palestinian town.\nIn 2017, the city had a population of 39,000, and the metro area 153,000.\nRamallah is known for its religiously relaxed atmosphere; alcohol flows freely and movie theaters and the cafes along its main streets are well attended. Ramallah is, without question, the cultural capital of the West Bank, with a highly educated and fashionable population. It is also the hub of Palestinian feminist activity; the city's women frequently attend university rather than marrying early, and several cafes run exclusively by women are used to fund local feminist organizations.\nWhile there, it is easy to make small talk with the locals. Unless you are firmly anti-Israeli occupation, it is advisable that you do more listening than actual talking yourself, however. For the most part, Palestinians are glad to share their problems and plight with any western visitors.\n\n## Get in\nTourists with passports outside the Middle East have no problem entering or exiting Ramallah. Make sure to have your passport and visa stamp with you. Even though you will probably not need your passport to enter, you will be required to show your passport and stamp in order to re-enter Israel. Once through the checkpoint, it is a short drive to downtown Ramallah. Bear in mind that it is illegal for Israelis to enter Ramallah, under Israeli law.\nOn the way back, if you have an Israeli visa stamp or visa paper with your passport from when you arrived in Israel, then just stay on the bus as it arrives at Kalandia. (Many passengers will get off here to go through a different security check.) A couple of border guards will come on to the bus to check passenger ID documents. They will probably speak English well and may ask some questions about where you are from.\n\n## By bus\nThere is 31.9054935.20711 one bus station on Al-Nahder St. that serves buses from Nablus, and probably other destinations north. There are at least three other bus stations in the city which also serve various destinations. Nevertheless, they are all pretty close to each other.\nFrom Jerusalem the best connection to Ramallah is bus/sherut/serves 218 (and sometimes 219). It departs from the Nablus Road station close to Damascus Gate on Nablus Rd (aka Derech Shchem) and will take you all the way to before mentioned bus station near the central square of al-Manara. The price is ₪10-20, and it takes around 45 minutes.\nFrom Bethlehem take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the Bethlehem bus station at Manger St. in the center. The trip takes 45 min all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the central roundabout with the garden in the middle. The taxis are waiting on the western side of the roundabout. To increase your \"luck\", you can also wait at the roundabout out of the city with the mosque. Even hitchhiking from there makes sense. The trip to Ramallah takes less than an hour for less than ₪15. The exact price is listed in the tourist information on the central roundabout in Jericho centre.\nFrom Nablus the trip is ₪10.5 and it takes about an hour. Ask around from which bus station in Nablus the correct (big) bus starts.\nIt is worth asking the drivers before you get on to double-check the bus is going to the right destination. You might be surprised how many of them can speak basic English. There are two main types of buses. There are small ones with about 20 seats, and biggers ones that look more like coaches and are much more comfortable. They all cost the same, and there is usually a rush of passengers pushing their way onto the buses.\n\n## By taxi\nFrom Jerusalem's Damascus Gate you can find taxis to Ramallah for approximately ₪80-100 depending on your bargaining skills. You can also take a taxi to Kalandia checkpoint and walk through, picking up another taxi on the other side. It costs about ₪30 from Kalandia to Ramallah centre.\n\n## By car\nHeading north from Jerusalem on road #60, you will arrive to Ramallah very quickly. You will have to pass one Israeli checkpoint on the way: Kalandia.\n\n## By plane\nThere is no airport with scheduled passenger flights in the West Bank, so the only nearby passenger airports are Ben Gurion Airport in Lod, then heading towards Jerusalem  or Queen Alia in Amman then heading towards Allenby Bridge aka King Hussein Bridge and passing through it - Visa on arrival for Israel is available for most common nationalities. Ovda Airport near Eilat also sees international flights, but the connection from there to Ramallah is not all that straightforward and more time-consuming.\n\n## Get around\nIt is easy to find a taxi to get around Ramallah (for ₪10 fixed charge, or the amount specified by the fare-meter). Car rentals are also available, but seldom needed. As the city center is relatively small, it is not hard to walk to most destinations downtown (including the old city.) Service shuttles (shared taxis) are also available from downtown to most suburbs and to the outskirts of the city at relatively low prices (₪2.5 inside the city and up to ₪6 to nearby towns and villages). Make sure to confirm a price before getting into a taxi.\n\n## See\nThe city is one of the most vibrant ones in the West Bank. In Ramallah, a few historic and religious sites are present. However, the downtown streets are a must see during the day, as the city is often really congested.\nHisbeh produce market, see below.\n31.9045635.197271 Old City.

If you are visiting Ramallah, it is probable that you are doing so for political, business, and/or humanitarian reasons - expect to have lots of staring, curious (but always friendly) eyes looking at you as you walk through town.\n31.891735.19091 Ramallah Cultural Palace. The main venue for performances and concerts within the city.    (updated Aug 2023)\nJoin a protest, info@hostelinramallah.com.

Hostel in Ramallah has different tours, twice per week they organize trip to one of the protests and Hebron city. Keep in mind that you would protest at your own risk.\nTurkish bath (in the twin-city of El-Bireh). A good destination for foreigners wanting to relax for the day. .\n\n## Learn\nRamallah is the home of the Friends School in the Palestinian Territories. The school has two campuses, one for grades 1-6 and is located near the old city. The other is for grades 7-12 and is located near the old police station destroyed by an Israeli air strike. The schools are famous for their international learning environment, intensive English language focus, and liberal learning atmosphere. The schools are private and have a number of notable Palestinian alumni.\nThe city also has a number of public and private schools that serve a good number of the West Bank youth population. Private schools with specific religious affiliations can also be found.\nIn the twin city of El-Bireh, there is also a school for the blind that also serves as a vocational center.\nBirzeit University, which is in the neighboring town of Birzeit, is one of the Palestinian Authority's leading educational institutions. The University offers a large number of study options and at different levels for students.

The PAS (Palestinian and Arab Studies) program is popular with internationals visiting or working in the West Bank who want to learn Arabic and take classes on the history and politics of the Palestinian Authority.\nThe city also has branches for Al-Quds Open University, which offers continuing education opportunities to many Palestinians.\nThere are a number of vocational training centers in the city, neighboring towns, and refugee camps.\n\n## Work\nRamallah is a vibrant Palestinian business hub, especially as most international agencies and governmental offices are located in the city. However, with the immigration of Palestinians from other cities in the West Bank to Ramallah, there is a highly competitive job market and many Palestinians, especially young men come to the city seeking work.\nThe most popular career portal In Ramallah and Palestine is Jobs in Palestine[dead link]. Here you can find most jobs advertised by INGOs, NGOs, and local companies.\nMajor working opportunities in Ramallah include information technology, pharmaceuticals, development cooperation, and the public sector. Restaurant and coffee shop jobs are also available, mainly during the summer. Agricultural jobs are minimal in the city, but a few can be sought in neighboring villages.\nFor foreigners, work opportunities tend to include consultancies in certain private sector markets - IT is most common. The vast majority of foreigners working in Ramallah are doing development or humanitarian work. A significant number are focused on human rights and advocacy. A number of UN agencies work directly in the West Bank and many, such as the UNDP, maintain office in Ramallah.\nVolunteering opportunities are common in small and medium-sized Palestinian NGOs as well as some international NGOs. Volunteering is an excellent way to get to understand an organisation and the field they operate in. Most local NGOs will appreciate foreign volunteers, particularly if they have good written English skills, enabling them to support fundraising work. Volunteers are often paid small sums to cover basic travel costs but this varies. If you are planning to volunteer, have enough money to support yourself as Ramallah is not a cheap place to live. you could also volunteer in some new small projects as the first youth hostel in the city (Hostel in Ramallah) and through the hostel there are some other projects as an organic farm or refuge camps http://hostelinramallah.com\n\n## Buy\nThere's not a huge amount to do in Ramallah if you are just visiting. A great way to spend your time could be to dip in and out of shops. Shop-keepers are among the most ready-to-talk and many have colourful lives. It gives you a good reason to walk around and take your time.\nYou will never find everything under one roof, but for a basket of common necessities, you will need to visit a baker, grocer, butcher, pharmacy and mini-market. Ramallah city centre, despite the development and growth of some new stores retains a small-town feel due to the protections for tenants that mean many shops have been in the same location for decades (rent agreed at the outset cannot be increased, so in many cases is only a few USD per year).\n31.9045935.206031 Hisbeh produce market (Souq) (near the main bus station and the central mosque, about 150 m away from al-Manara Square (the centre of Ramallah)).

The staple is 'kmaaj' or pitta bread. A bakery in the Old City (Ramallah Tahta) produces brown kmaaj and sliced bread.\nAlso the Arabic variety of ice cream in many places in Ramallah is worth trying - a very different and more gooey and sticky version of what is available in the west.

Expect a selection of imported beers (Heineken, Corona, etc.), spirits, and perhaps red or white wine. Do not display public intoxication, as at best, it is rude and inconsiderate to your Muslim hosts. At worst, it could be dangerous.\nThe city's active nightlife and its relatively liberal culture makes it a hot destination for visitors from other cities including Jerusalem during the weeknights and weekends.\nDuring the night, a good number of shops are still open, especially during the summer. A common habit of the citizens of the city is going out for a drink, dinner, or an argila (flavoured tobacco waterpipe). The city's various coffee shops, bars, and restaurants are a must see/visit.

You can also smoke arghila in almost any restaurant, although some have special areas for them.\nYou can order normal ('aadi') or fresh ('fresh'). Fresh means the tobacco is placed in a piece of fruit like an orange (or even a watermelon). It has a smoother flavour but is more expensive. You should also choose your flavour. Common flavours are double-apple ('tufateen') and lemon and mint ('limun-w-nana').\nDepending on the location and type of restaurant of cafe, the price of smoking a nice and soothing tobacco waterpipe costs anywhere between ₪8-30.

(updated Nov 2017)\n\n## Stay safe\nGenerally speaking, Ramallah is safe for non-Israeli foreigners. The Palestinian residents are usually quite happy to have foreign nationals visit them. Theft is relatively rare, although do not interpret that statement as an OK to let your guard down.\nBear in mind that although Ramallah has been under military occupation for a long time, the city is relatively stable. However, very rarely the Israeli military enters the city to arrest wanted Palestinians. This usually only happens in the dead of night, and they disappear before anyone realizes that they were there. However, the Israeli military can enter Ramallah bluntly, and in large numbers. If this should happen while you are staying in Ramallah, do what the majority of Palestinians do, and stay inside until they leave and away from any soldiers or military vehicles. Do not assume that just because you are a foreign national that you will be safe.\nThat said, Ramallah hasn't seen any widespread violence since 2006 and it is highly unlikely to happen (unless there are escalations with Israel, which will be very apparent via international media). In the cases where the Israelis enter, it is usually to arrest a wanted Palestinian in an outskirts refugee camp in the middle of the night.
