      "content": "Beit Jala (Arabic: ) is a Palestinian Christian town in the Bethlehem Governorate of Palestine, in the West Bank. Beit Jala is located 10 km (6.2 mi)10 km south of Jerusalem, on the western side of the Hebron road, opposite Bethlehem, at 825 meters (2,707 ft) altitude. In 2017, Beit Jala had 13,484 inhabitants according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. About 80% of the population were Christians (mostly Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and about 20% Muslims.\nSaint Nicholas – the inspiration for Santa Claus – is the patron saint of Beit Jala, where the Church of Saint Nicholas was built over a crypt where it is believed he lived for a couple years during his time in Palestine.\n\nEtymology\nConder and Kitchener identified Beit Jala with Galem or Gallim (Γαλλιμ) of the Septuagint, a place in the 9th district of the inheritance of Judah; homonymous with a settlement in Benjamin NE of Jerusalem.\n\nHistory\nByzantine period\nA crypt, dating to the 5th or 6th century C.E., was located under the Church of Saint Nicholas in Beit Jala.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the Crusader era, the village was called Apezala, and the Church of Saint Nicholas was possibly rebuilt during that time.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. In this century, Beit Jala was a large village of Christian and  peasants and it had over ten elders (akabir) who functioned as leaders, with each religious group having separate sets of leaders. Rare for a single village, it and nearby Bethlehem, served as its own separate jurisdiction instead of being grouped with other villages into a nahiya. In April 1531, when an Ottoman official went to Beit Jala to register the village's grapevines for tax purposes, the residents refused to seriously answer his questions and mocked the authority of the Ottoman sultan, marking a notable episode of initial local resistance to the Ottoman taxation methods and procedures. By the end of the 16th century, Beit Jala was almost entirely inhabited by Christians. Beit Jala's size rendered it similar to that of a town, with the village being subdivided into four quarters. The village produced more wheat and barley than surrounding localities and like other villages south of Jerusalem, grape cultivation was greater than olive cultivation. Beit Jala was taxed on these agricultural products as well as figs, honeybees, and goats. It contained one of the six olive presses in the subdistrict of Jerusalem in the 16th century. Despite its large size, Beit Jala was relatively poorer than other villages in the subdistrict.\nIn the 1596 tax-records, it appeared as Bayt Jala, located in the Nahiya of Jabal Quds of the Liwa of Al-Quds. The population was 245 households; 6 Muslims and 239 Christians. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, which included  wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 30,000 akçe.\nIn 1697 Henry Maundrell passed Beit Jala, and noted that: \"no Turk can live in it above two years. By virtue of this report, whether true or false, the Christians keep the Village to themselves without molestation; no Turk being willing to stake his life experimenting the truth of it.\"\nIn the 17th century, the Christians of Beit Jala offered to become Catholic if the Franciscans paid their jizya tax.\nBeit Jala's inhabitants participated in the 1834 peasants' revolt in Palestine against Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian governor of Syria. Beit Jala's residents were believed to have taken part in the looting of Egyptian property and on 31 May, Egyptian troops assaulted the village. Ibrahim Pasha put a stop to the attack, but at least 33 men and women were killed in the attack. In addition, the village's livestock was seized. The attack on Beit Jala prompted rebels from the Ta'amira tribe, a local Bedouin tribe, to enter into Bethlehem to help bolster its defense.\nIn 1838, it was noted as a Greek Christian village, located in the Beni Hasan area, west of Jerusalem. The population was estimated to be around 2000 people.\nBy the mid-19th century, there were 10 Catholics living in Beit Jala. The Latin Patriarchate founded its first parish in Palestine in Beit Jala in 1853. The establishment of the parish faced fierce resistance by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the inhabitants of Beit Jala, leading to several skirmishes and official complaints to the Ottoman authorities by both sides. A Latin church was built in Beit Jala and inaugurated on 18 April 1858. The Jerusalem Society, a Protestant movement struggled to maintain a presence in Beit Jala in the late 19th century. When a clash between Orthodox and Protestant residents ended with the death of an Orthodox girl, the village's Protestant community was evacuated to al-Karak in Transjordan for six months until compensation was paid to the family of the slain girl. In 1866, the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire purchased land in Beit Jala and built a girls' school, the first Russian school to be built in Palestine. It had 60 pupils by 1880 and was assigned a Russian principal. In 1886, it became a teachers' training school and was under the administration of the Palestinian Orthodox Imperial Society.\nAlbert Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that Beit Jala had 234 houses and a population of 874 \"Latins\", though the population count included men, only. Martin Hartmann found that Beit Jala  had 232  houses.\nIn 1883, the  PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Jala as: \"A large and flourishing village of white well-built stone houses, on the slope of a steep hill. The water supply is artificial, with a well in the valley below. The population is said by Pere Lievin to amount to 3,000, of whom 420 are Catholics, and the rest Orthodox Greeks. There is a Greek and a Latin church in the village. There are remarkably fine groves of olives round and beneath the village, and the hill is covered with vineyards which belong to the place.\"\nIn 1896 the population of Beit Jala was estimated to be about 2,880  persons.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Beit Jala had a population of 3,101; 3,060 Christians and 41 Muslims; where the Christians consisted of 2,628 Orthodox, 358 Roman Catholics, 4 Greek Catholic (Melkites), and 1 each of the Armenian Catholic, Maronite and the Coptic Church. In the 1931 census the population had decreased to 2,731; 2,529 Christians, 198 Muslims, 3 with \"no religion\" and 1 Jew; in a total of 631 inhabited houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics  the population of Beit Jala was 3,710; 200 Muslims and 3,510 Christians, with 13,307 (rural) and 737 (urban) dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 9,860 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 1,064 for cereals, while 737 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nBy the end of the Mandate, the population of Beit Jala was apprixmately 4,000.\n\nJordanian period\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Beit Jala came under Jordanian rule.\nThe Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) began relief operations for refugees in the West Bank in 1950. They also worked with Palestinians who had retained their houses and so were not technically refugees, but who had lost their land or means of making a living because of the war. As part of this relief, the MCC founded a school in Beit Jala which was still in operation as of 1979.\nIn 1952, an Israel Defense Forces reprisal raid in Beit Jala killed seven civilians; one man, two women and three children. A complaint was lodged that Israel had violated the General Armistice agreement. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation of Israel for breaching the agreement.\nIn 1961, the population of Beit Jala was  7,966.\n\nPost 1967\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Jala has been under Israeli occupation. Control of the town was assumed by the Palestinian Authority following the 1993 Oslo Accords. According to the Beit Jala Municipality, the city's land holdings have been relegated under different areas of administration. Area A comprises approximately 3,500 dunums, or about 25% of the town's land, which is under Palestinian control. The remaining 75% (Area C) is under Israeli jurisdiction, and 7% of the total Area C is located inside the Municipality border.\nAccording to ARIJ, after the war Israel confiscated 3,147 dunums of Beit Jala land in order to expand the Jerusalem municipal boundaries, later taking further land for the two Israeli settlements of Gilo and Har Gilo, the West Bank barrier and bypass roads.\nDuring the Second Intifada, militants from the Fatah-affiliated Tanzim group used Beit Jala as a base for launching sniper and mortar attacks on the  Israeli settlement of Gilo. Gilo is located on a hilltop across from Beit Jala, partially built on the lands of Beit Jala, Beit Safafa and Sharafat. The Israeli government built a concrete barrier and installed bulletproof windows in homes and schools facing Beit Jala.\n\nMilitants were reported to have used the houses of Palestinian Christian residents to fire on Israeli targets in Gilo. Fighters were initially welcomed by residents, but after their homes were attacked by Israeli retaliatory fire and several fighters and residents were killed, they no longer tolerated the militants' presence. According to John Bunzl, the Israeli press used the incident to suggest there was a Christian-Muslim conflict in the incidents, with the former trying to prevent an attack until the Muslims forced them to surrender. Numerous statements taken from Christian residents appear to refute this. In August 2001, the Israeli Army occupied the northeastern corner of Beit Jala, declaring that it would only leave when the gunfire on Gilo stopped. Two days later, the troops withdrew. Palestinian militants subsequently increased their attacks, adding mortars and heavy machine guns. According to Time magazine, the Palestinian militants were not locals, but took up positions in Beit Jala due to its proximity to Gilo. In August 2010, after a long period of calm, the concrete barrier built to protect Gilo was removed.\nThe Israel barrier in the West Bank will separate over 50 Beit Jala families from their land; although Israel says it is a vital security measure. Palestinians believe the ultimate aim of the barrier is a land grab as it is built inside the occupied West Bank on land Palestinians want for a future independent state. Local church leaders - Latin Catholic and Greek Orthodox - have been involved in the campaign to prevent the construction of the barrier.\n\nGeography\nThe Israel bypass road known as the Tunnels Highway passes directly underneath Beit Jala.\n\nDemographics\nThis town's Christian inhabitants are made up of five Christian tribes that trace their origins as Aramaic-and Arabic speaking people who lived in that area near Bethlehem prior to the Muslim conquest in 634. At the 1931 census of Palestine the population of Beit Jala was 2,732. This included 196 Muslims, 2,532 Christians, and one Jew. In 1947, Beit Jala had a population of approximately 3,700. In 1967, according to a census conducted by the Israeli Army Command, the population was 6,041. The population in 2007 was 11,758 according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nEconomy\nCremisan Cellars, located in the Cremisan monastery, is an important local winemaker. The winery has operated since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1997. Beit Jala was once famous for its pork, olive oil, apricots and stone masonry. Other economic branches are tobacco, textiles, agriculture and pharmaceuticals. The Beit Jala Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company (formerly Jordan Chemical Laboratory) was established in 1958 to manufacture generic drug pharmaceutical products for the local market.\nThe West Bank Barrier is being extended to encircle the area, splitting the monastery, which would end up on the Israeli side, from the sister Salesian convent, and making access to this recreational area for Beit Jala residents very difficult. 57 Christian families are slated to lose their agricultural property.\n\nHealth care\nBeit Jala has a government-run 113-bed hospital, and a 77-bed privately run specialized surgery hospital operated by the Arab Society for Rehabilitation. Primary health care is provided by the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health. In addition, there are many charities, medical institutions and private health clinics. Societies for the disabled in Beit Jala include the Bethlehem Arab Society, Lifegate Rehabilitation and House Jemima, a Dutch-founded home and daycare-center for children with mental disabilities. Al-Hussein Governmental Hospital, Beit Jala is a government hospital here.\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nBeit Jala is home to educational institutions run by a variety of Christian denominations, including the Arab Orthodox Benevolent Society. A Russian Orthodox school was established in 1866. The Latin Patriarchate Seminary, which supervises religious liturgical education in the Jerusalem Patriarchate, moved to Beit Jala in 1936.\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land (ELCJHL) has a congregation in Beit Jala. The denomination also runs the Talitha Kumi School in Beit Jala, which was founded by Lutheran deaconesses in the 19th century and relocated in Beit Jala in 1961. The school has developed an environmental education program and operates the only bird-ringing station in the Palestinian sector. The school also runs a guesthouse.\n\nThe Beit Jala skyline is dominated by several churches, among them the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of St. Michael, and the Church of Saint Nicholas. According to tradition, St. Nicholas spent four years in a cave beneath the Church. These three churches belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. The Latin Church of Annunciation is the Catholic church built in 1850.\nThe Syriac Orthodox Church runs the Mar Afram school in Beit Jala. In 2007, Mar Afram started offering classes in Aramaic (more specifically, Syriac Aramaic) to its students, which were taught by elderly residents of the town who still spoke the waning language fluently.\n\nLocal government\nIn the 2005 municipal election, six seats went to the United Beit Jala list (Fatah and Palestinian People's Party), five seats went to Sons of the Land (PFLP and independents), one seat went to Independent Beit Jala Group and one candidate was elected as an independent. The most popular candidate was Raji George Jadallah Zeidan of United Jala with 2,892 votes, followed by Nadir Antoun Issa Abu Amsha of Sons of the Land with 1764 votes.\n\nSports\nThe Beit Jala Lions is a rugby club active in Beit Jala since 2007. Hailed as the first all-Palestinian rugby team in history, the team is made up almost exclusively of residents of Beit Jala.\n\nProminent people from Beit Jala\nTawfiq Canaan\nToni Qattan\nGhassan Zaqtan\n\nInternational relations\nBeit Jala is twin or sister cities with:\n\n La Calera, Chile\n Aubervilliers, France\n Bergisch Gladbach, Germany\n Jena, Germany\n Varazze, Italy\n Santa Maria del Mar District, Peru\nBeit Jala has friendship agreements with:\n\n Grenoble, France\n Reggio Emilia, Italy\n Trento, Italy\nRepresentatives from Beit Jala and Valfabbrica, Italy, signed a Declaration of Intent in 2012.\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nPalestinian diaspora\nWest Bank\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Site of Beit Jala\nWelcome To The City of Bayt Jala\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nBeit Jala City (Fact Sheet),  Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nBeit Jala City Profile, (ARIJ)\nBeit Jala City Area Photo, (ARIJ)\nThe priorities and needs for development in Beit Jala city based on the community and local authorities’ assessment, (ARIJ)\nTalitha Kumi School\nHouse Jemima\nLifegate Rehabilitation\nBethlehem Arab Society for Rehabilitation\nNativity Hotel in Beit Jala",

      "content": "Beit Jala (« Tapis d'herbe » en araméen) est une ville arabe chrétienne de Palestine sous l'autorité palestinienne, située à 10 km au sud de Jérusalem à 2 km de Bethléem, et à côté de Beit Sahour. En 2007, Beit Jala comptait 11 758 habitants, majoritairement chrétiens avec une minorité musulmane. Près de 100 000 personnes vivant au Chili et dans les Amériques descendent d'habitants ayant émigré pour fuir les combats au cours du siècle passé.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville se trouve à 825 m d'altitude en moyenne (son point culminant est à 925 m) à l'ouest de la route d'Hébron et s'étend sur 14 km2.\nSa pluviométrie est de 700 mm. Les précipitations tombent surtout en hiver, entre fin novembre et fin février, avec rarement de la neige. La température monte parfois à 39 degrés à midi en été.\nLes températures moyennes sont de 9 à 18 °C en hiver et de 26 à 30 °C en été.\n\nHistoire\nDes traces de peuplement datent de l'âge de la pierre vers 200 000 av. J.-C. Il est certain que l'endroit était peuplé par les Cananéens en 3 000 av. J.-C. comme à Bethléem.\nLes ruines les plus anciennes attestant de l'implantation d'une communauté permanente datent de l'époque byzantine aux IIIe et IVe siècles, lorsque des moines, comme saint Nicolas se sont installés ici pour être près du lieu de naissance du Christ. C'est ainsi qu'est construit le monastère Saint-Georges sur la colline. Ses vestiges sont visibles dans la crypte de l'église Saint-Nicolas actuelle, ainsi qu'une grotte où saint Nicolas aurait vécu. Depuis cette époque le village s'est peuplé de chrétiens sans discontinuer.\nBeit Jala et Bethléem ont été ravagés par la rébellion samaritaine de 529 et la région est conquise par le calife Oumar en 637. Les croisés installent un clergé catholique en 1099 qui est expulsé en 1187 par Saladin. La Palestine est conquise par les Ottomans en 1516 et Beit Jala connaît une vie prospère. La sultane haseki Roxelane crée un imaret (soupe populaire) à Jérusalem en 1552. Cet imaret de Roxelane est financé par les impôts de plusieurs villages, affectés à un waqf (fondation pieuse) chargé d’entretenir l’imaret.\nAu XVIIe siècle, la décadence de l'Empire ottoman impose de plus en plus de taxes et de conscriptions forcées d'enfants chrétiens obligés d'abjurer leur foi pour devenir entre autres janissaires. Méhémet Ali d'Égypte occupe la région de 1831 à 1840 et il en est chassé par les Turcs revenus grâce à l'aide des Britanniques. L'émigration des chrétiens, plus éduqués que la moyenne, commence alors à la fin du XIXe siècle, notamment en Argentine et au Chili. C'est à cette époque aussi que les missionnaires orthodoxes russes, catholiques français, britanniques anglicans et allemands luthériens s'intéressent à la région et obtiennent le droit d'ouvrir des écoles et des missions.\n\nLes autorités israéliennes ont confisqué depuis 1967 10 000 dounams sur les 15 000 appartenant à la commune, pour la fondation des colonies juives de Gilo, Har Gilo et Givat Hamatos.\n\nProjet de mur israélien\nEn juillet 2015, la Cour Suprême israélienne a autorisé un mur de séparation dans la vallée de Beit Jala, un projet auquel les Palestiniens s'opposent.\n\nReligion\nLa ville comprend six églises et deux mosquées, dont:\n\nÉglise Saint-Nicolas, église grecque-orthodoxe (la plus importante) reconstruite en 1925\nÉglise Sainte-Marie, église grecque-orthodoxe (la plus ancienne)\nÉglise Saint-Georges, église grecque-orthodoxe\nÉglise catholique de l'Annonciation\nÉglise de la Réformation, église luthérienne fondée par la Jerusalemsverein\nCouvent des Salésiens de Don Bosco (1885) sur les ruines d'un monastère byzantin (VIIe siècle), comprenant un chai renommé pour la viticulture des vignes alentour\nDepuis 2014, les chrétiens de rite syriaque de Beit Jala peuvent s’enregistrer au sein de l’ethnie officielle des Araméens.\n\nÉducation\nLa ville accueille quatre écoles élémentaires et secondaires publiques qui scolarisent 45 % des élèves (1 774 élèves) et six écoles privées confessionnelles qui scolarisent 55 % des élèves (2 133 élèves) dont la célèbre école Talitha Kumi fondée ici en 1951.
