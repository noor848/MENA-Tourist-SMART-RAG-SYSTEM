      "content": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ḫazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Ḫāzat. It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, עַזָּה ʻAzzā, a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root ע-ז-ז‎ ʻayin-zayin-zayin, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The ע‎ in the root ע-ז-ז‎ corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *ʻ sound (compare Hebrew עַז ʻaz with Arabic عَزَّ ʻazza, both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (غَزَّة, Ġazza), Koine Greek (Γάζα, Gáza), and Egyptian (gꜣḏꜣtw) that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *ġ (/ʁ/) sound, and thus cannot have been from the same ע-ז-ז‎ root as עַז ʻaz.\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as Ġazzat Hāšim in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\nEarly Bronze\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\n\nLate Bronze\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as Azzatu. Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\n\nIron Age\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays–Yaman war (793–796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\n\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\n\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\n\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGaza War\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Gaza is 78 kilometres (48 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, 71 kilometres (44 mi) south of Tel Aviv, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\n\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of 270 feet (82 m) above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (maqam) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\n\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\n\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres) of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds 122 trillion cubic feet (3.5 trillion cubic metres) of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\n\nCulture\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include zibdiyit gambari, literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and shatta which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in sayyadiya, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were fellahin (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. Sumaghiyyeh, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. Maftool is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (qahwa) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\n\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\n\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits 1.5 km (1 mi) northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\n\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\n\nInfrastructure\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\n\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) northeast of the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGaza genocide\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian Authority\nList of rulers of Gaza\nOutline of the State of Palestine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nMunicipality of Gaza\nSpokesperson for Gaza Municipality\nGaza at Google Maps\nThe achievements of the municipal council for a period of 5 years (2008–2013) in Arabic Archived 19 August 2014 at the Wayback Machine",
      "summary": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.",

      "content": "غَزَّة مدينة ساحلية فلسطينية، وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة وتقع في شماله، في الطرف الجنوبي للساحل الشرقي من البحر المتوسط. تبعد عن مدينة القدس مسافة 78 كم إلى الجنوب الغربي، ويحدها من الشمال الشرقي أراضي مدينة الخليل الغربية المحتلة منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظة غزة إداريًا وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 2,141,000 نسمة في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها أكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من أكثر المدن كثافة بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينة غزة من أهم المدن الفلسطينية؛ لأهمية موقعها الاستراتيجي والأهمية الاقتصادية والعمرانية للمدينة، بالإضافة إلى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والإنجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزاً إسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى أيضاً غزة هاشم، كما أنها مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو أحد أئمة المذاهب الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948م، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجرت عدة تحسينات على المدينة. احتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967م (عام النكسة)، وبعد اتفاقية أوسلو بين منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية وإسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزة-أريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطة المدنية إلى سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثورة المصرية في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطني غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالأنشطة الاقتصادية الرئيسية في قطاع غزة هي الصناعات الصغيرة والزراعة والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الإسرائيلي والصراعات المتكررة.\n\nالتسمية\nتُعتبر غزة أحد أقدم المدن التي عرفها التاريخ، أما سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم فهو غير مُثبَّت بدقة، لأن هذا الاسم كان قابلاً للتبديل والتحريف بتبدل الأمم التي صارعتها، فهي عند الكنعانيين (هزاتي)، وعند الفراعنة (غزاتو أو غذة) منذ القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، أما الآشوريون واليونانيون فكانوا يطلقون عليها (عزاتي) و(فازا)، وعند العبرانيين (عزة). أما العرب الجنوبيين (سبأ، ومعين) فهي عندهم باللفظ العربي (غزة)، وهي في وصفهم ميناء مهم بالقرب من قرى اليهود، وذكرت لديهم منذ القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد فصاعدًا.\nفي العصور الوسطى، سماها الصليبيون (غادرز)، والأتراك لم يغيروا من اسمها العربي (غزة)، أما الإنجليز ويطلقون عليها اسم (گازا) (بالإنجليزية: Gaza). وقد اختلف المؤرخون - كعادتهم بالنسبة لكثير من المدن القديمة – في سبب تسميتها بغزة، فهناك من يقول إنها مشتقة من المَنَعَة والقوة، وهناك من يقول إن معناها: «الثروة»، وآخرون يرون أنها تعني: «المُميزة» أو «المُختصة» بصفات هامة تميزها عن غيرها من المدن. أما ياقوت الحموي فيقول عنها في معجمه: «غَزَّ فلان بفلان واعتز به إذا اختصه من بين أصحابه».\nارتبط العرب بغزة ارتباطاً وثيقاً فقد كان تجارهم يَفِدون إليها في تجارتهم وأسفارهم باعتبارها مركزاً مهماً لعدد من الطرق التجارية، وكانت تمثل الهدف لإحدى الرحلتين الشهيرتين اللتين وردتا في القرآن الكريم في «سورة قريش»: «رحلتا الشتاء والصيف»: رحلة القرشيين شتاءً إلى اليمن، ورحلتهم صيفاً إلى غزة ومشارف الشام. وفي إحدى رحلات الصيف هذه، مات هاشم بن عبد مناف جدُّ الرسول المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم، ودُفن في غزة بالجامع المعروف حالياً بجامع السيد هاشم في حي «الدرج».\n\nالتاريخ\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد. وطيلة تاريخها، لم يكن لغزة حكم مستقل، حيث احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين وغيرهم. وكانت أول مرة تذكر فيها المدينة في مخطوطة للفرعون تحتمس الثالث (القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد)، وكذلك ورد اسمها في رسائل تل العمارنة. بعد 300 سنة من الاحتلال الفرعوني للمدينة نزلت قبيلة من الفلستينيين وسكنت المدينة والمنطقة المجاورة لها، عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزا إسلاميا مهما وخاصة أنها مشهورة بوجود قبر الجد الثاني للنبي محمد، هاشم بن عبد مناف فيها ولذلك أحيانا تسمى غزة هاشم. وتُعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي 767م الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. سيطر الأوروبيون على المدينة في فترة الحملات الصليبية، لكنها رجعت تحت حكم المسلمين بعد أن انتصر صلاح الدين الأيوبي عليهم في معركة حطين عام 1187. ازدهرت المدينة في آخر أيام الحكم العثماني، حيث تأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي عام 1893. سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزء من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجريت عدة تحسينات في المدينة.\nاحتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967 (النكسة)، ولكن في عام 1993م، نُقلت المدينة إلى السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. بعد انتخابات عام 2006، اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس. ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. لكن بعد الثورة المصرية، قامت مصر بفتح معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطنين غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.\n\nالفترة القديمة\nيعود الاستيطان البشري في منطقة قطاع غزة إلى تل السكن، وهو حصن مصري قديم، والذي بني في الأراضي الكنعانية إلى الجنوب من قطاع غزة في الوقت الحاضر. كما أن مركزًا آخر في المناطق الحضرية المعروفة باسم تل العجول بدأ ينمو على طول وادي مجرى النهر في غزة.\nخلال العصر البرونزي الأوسط، أصبحت تل السكن أقصى مدن جنوب كنعان، وكانت وظيفتها بمثابة حصن. في عام 1650 قبل الميلاد، عندما احتل الهكسوس مصر، عُمرت مدينة ثانية على أنقاض تل السكن. ومع ذلك، هجرها في القرن 14 قبل الميلاد، في نهاية العصر البرونزي.\nأصبحت غزة في وقت لاحق عاصمة مصر الإدارية في أرض كنعان. في عهد تحتمس الثالث، أصبحت المدينة محطة على طريق القوافل بين مصر وسوريا، وجاءت في رسائل تل العمارنة باسم \"Azzati\".\nبقيت المدينة تحت السيطرة المصرية لمدة 350 عاما حتى غزاها الفلستينيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، وأصبحت جزءا من البنتابوليس \"pentapolis\" الخاص بهم. ووفقا لسفر القضاة، فإن غزة كانت المكان الذي كان قد سجن فيه شمشون من قبل الفلستينيين حتى وفاته.\nبعد أن سيطر الآشوريون والمصريون على المدينة، حققت غزة الاستقلال النسبي والازدهار في ظل الامبراطورية الفارسية. ولقد حاصر الاسكندر الأكبر غزة، حيث بقت آخر مدينة تقاوم غزوه في طريقه إلى مصر، لمدة خمسة أشهر قبل احتلالها أخيرا سنة 332 قبل الميلاد، وكان سكانها إما قتلوا أو تم سبيهم. أحضر الإسكندر البدو المحليين ليسكنوا غزة، ونظم المدينة إلى بوليس (أو دولة-المدينة). وقد اكتسبت المدينة سمعة طيبة كمركز مزدهر للتعلم اليونانية والفلسفة.\nشهدت غزة حصارا آخر في 96 قبل الميلاد من قبل الحشمونيين الذين «أطاحوا تماما» في المدينة، مما أسفر عن مقتل 500 من أعضاء مجلس الشيوخ الذين كانوا قد فروا إلى معبد أبولو للسلامة.\n\nالعهد الروماني والبيزنطي\nأُعيد بناء المدينة بعد دمجها في الإمبراطورية الرومانية في 63 قبل الميلاد تحت قيادة بومبيوس الكبير، ثم أصبحت غزة بعد ذلك جزءا من أحد مقاطعات الدولة الرومانية في بلاد الشام. وكانت المدينة مستهدفة من قبل اليهود خلال تمردهم ضد الحكم الروماني في 66 وقد دمرت جزئيا. وظلت مع ذلك مدينة مهمة، خاصة بعد تدمير القدس. طوال العصر الروماني، كانت غزة مدينة مزدهرة وتلقى المنح واهتمام عدة أباطرة. كان 500 عضو في مجلس الشيوخ يحكم غزة، وكان سكان المدينة مجموعة متنوعة من مختلف الأعراق، منهم الفلستينيين والإغريق والرومان والكنعانيين والفينيقيين واليهود والفراعنة والفرس، بالإضافة إلى البدو. وكانت تصدر في غزة عملات معدنية تزين مع تماثيل الآلهة والأباطرة. وخلال زيارته للمدينة في 130م، قام الإمبراطور هادريان بافتتاح حلبة المصارعة شخصيا، في ملعب غزة الجديد، الذي أصبح معروفًا من الإسكندرية إلى دمشق. وقد زينت المدينة في العديد من المعابد الوثنية، وكان الإله الرئيسي \"مارناس\"، وهو أحد الآلهة القديمة التي انتشرت عبادتها في سوريا القديمة منذ النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وكان يطلق عليها داجون. وخُصصت المعابد الأخرى لزيوس، وهيليوس، وأفروديت، وأبولو، وأثينا، وتيشي المحلية.\nبدأت المسيحية بالانتشار في جميع أنحاء منطقة غزة في 250م، بما في ذلك في ميناء غزة.\nوتسارع اعتناق المسيحية في منطقة غزة في فترة القديس بورفيريوس (بين عامي 396م و 420م). في سنة 402م، أمر الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الثاني بتدمير جميع معابد المدينة الوثنية الثمانية، وبعد أربع سنوات كلفت الإمبراطورة ايليا ببناء كنيسة فوق أنقاض معبد Marnas.\nوبعد انقسام الإمبراطورية الرومانية في القرن 3 م، كانت غزة لا تزال تحت سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية الشرقية التي بدورها أصبحت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية. ازدهرت المدينة، وكانت مركزا هاما لبلاد الشام.\n\nالحكم الإسلامي\nفي عام 635م حاصر المسلمون غزة وسيطر عليها جيش الخلفاء الراشدين تحت قيادة عمرو بن العاص بعد معركة أجنادين بين الإمبراطورية البيزنطية والخلافة الراشدة في وسط فلسطين. وكان وصول العرب المسلمين قد جلب تغييرات جذرية على غزة، في البداية حُولت بعض الكنائس إلى مساجد، بما في ذلك المسجد الكبير الحالي في قطاع غزة (الأقدم في المدينة)، كما أن شريحة كبيرة من السكان اعتنقت الإسلام، وأصبحت اللغة العربية هي اللغة الرسمية.\nوتعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الشافعي (767) الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. والذي عاش طفولته المبكرة هناك. وكان الشافعي قد أسس فلسفة إسلامية سنية في الفقه، وسُمي المذهب الشافعي تكريما له. وعلى الرغم من حظر الكحول في الإسلام، سمح للجاليات اليهودية والمسيحية للحفاظ على إنتاج النبيذ والعنب، وهو محصول نقدي رئيسي في المدينة، وكانت أساسا للتصدير إلى مصر. لأنه تحدها الصحراء، وكانت غزة عرضة لقتال جماعات البدو.\nفي عام 796م دُمرت غزة خلال حرب أهلية بين القبائل العربية في المنطقة. ومع ذلك، تم إعادة بناء المدينة من قبل الخلافة العربية الثالثة التي يحكمها العباسيون. وقد وصف الجغرافي العربي المقدسي غزة في 977م حين كان يحكمها الفاطميون «بأنها بلدة كبيرة تقع على الطريق الرئيسي لمصر على الحدود مع الصحراء.» وقد كان في تلك الفترة اتفاق مع السلاجقة، تم بموجبه سيطرة الفاطميين على غزة والأراضي الواقعة جنوبها، بما في ذلك مصر.\n\nالصليبيون والمماليك\nاحتل الصليبيون الأوروبيون المدينة من الفاطميين في عام 1100م، وقام الملك بلدوين الثالث ببناء القلعة التي استخدمها فرسان الهيكل في غزة في عام 1149. كما تحول الجامع الكبير إلى كاتدرائية القديس يوحنا. في عام 1154، كتب الرحالة العربي الإدريسي عن غزة «المدينة اليوم كثيرة السكان، وهي في أيدي الصليبيين».\nفي عام 1187م سيطرت القوات الأيوبية، بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على غزة، ثم دُمّرت تحصيناتها لاحقًا عام 1191م. وقد أمر ريتشارد قلب الأسد بتدعيم المدينة مرة أخري في 1192، لكن تم تفكيك الجدران مرة أخرى نتيجة لمعاهدة الرملة المتفق عليها في 1193. ولقد استمرت الفترة الأيوبية حتى 1260، بعد تدمير المدينة تماما على يد المغول تحت قيادة هولاكو، حيث أصبحت غزة أبعد نقطة إلى جنوب يتقدم إليها الجيش المغولي.\nبعد تدمير غزة على يد المغول، بدأ الجنود المماليك بإدارة المنطقة في عام 1277م. وقد جعل المماليك غزة عاصمة المحافظة التي تحمل اسمها «حاكمية قطاع غزة». هذه منطقة تمتد على طول السهل الساحلي من مدينة رفح في الجنوب إلى الشمال مباشرة من قيسارية، وإلى الشرق. بقدر ما المرتفعات الغربية وتلال الخليل المدن الرئيسية الأخرى في المحافظة وشملت اللد والرملة. وقد استخدم غزة التي دخلت فترة من الهدوء خلال الفترة المملوكية بها كموقع في هجماتهم ضد الصليبيين التي انتهت في 1290.\nفي عام 1294م، ضرب زلزال غزة فدمرها، وبعد مرور خمس سنوات، عاد المغول ليُدمروا كل ما أعاد المماليك بناءه. وقد وصف الجغرافي الدمشقي (الذي توفي عام 1327) غزة باعتبارها «مدينة كثيرة الشجر، كسماط ممدود لجيش الإسلام في أبواب الرمل ولكل صادر ووارد إلى الديار المصرية والشامية.» وفي 1348م، انتشر الطاعون في المدينة، فقضى على معظم سكانها. كما عانى قطاع غزة من الفيضانات المدمرة في عام 1352، والتي كانت نادرة في ذلك الجزء القاحل من بلاد الشام الجنوبية.\nإلا أن الرحالة العربي والكاتب ابن بطوطة عندما زار المدينة في 1355، كتب عنها «انها كبيرة ومزدحمة بالسكان، وفيها العديد من المساجد». وقد ساهم المماليك في الهندسة المعمارية في غزة ببناء المساجد والمدارس الإسلامية، والمستشفيات، والحمامات العامة. كما سمحوا لليهود بالعودة إلى المدينة، وقد شهد العصر المملوكي ازدهار المجتمع اليهودي في المدينة. في عام 1481م، كتب الرحالة مشولام «إنها أرض جيدة، ذات أشجار فاكهة وثمار والتي هي من نوعية ممتازة، وهناك الخبز والخمر، والذي هو من صنع اليهود فقط، وفيها عدد كبير من السكان، هناك 70 عائلة يهودية 4 عائلات سامرية». في نهاية العصر المملوكي كانت الطائفة اليهودية في غزة ثالث أكبر جالية يهودية في فلسطين، بعد صفد والقدس.\nوقد بنى المماليك واحدا من أهم المعالم في غزة، وهو قصر الباشا، الذي كان يُستخدم لحكم المدينة وإدارتها. ويقع القصر في البلدة القديمة وهو اليوم مدرسة للبنات، بالقرب من مقبرة حرب الكومنولث، غالبًا ما يشار إليها بمقبرة الحرب البريطانية، والتي تحتوي على قبور جنود الحلفاء الذين سقطوا في الحرب العالمية الأولى وهي في حي التفاح.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت المدينة تحت حكم الخلافة العثمانية الإسلامية في القرن السادس عشر وبقيت تحت حكمهم حتى سنة 1917 عندما استولت عليها القوات البريطانية خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى بعد ثلاثة معارك ضارية راح ضحيتها الآلاف من كلا الجانبين. وكانت غزة تتبع متصرفية القدس العثمانية، والتي كانت تتبع مباشرة للباب العالي دون أن تتبع أيا من الولايات. وكانت المتصرفية تضم بالإضافة إلى قضاء غزة، كل من أقضية يافا وبئر السبع والخليل. وقد حافظت متصرفية القدس حتى أواخر العهد العثماني- باستثناء الفترة من 1906 حتى 1909 عندما ضم إليها قضاء الناصرة- على حدودها.\nيذكر أنه في الحرب العالمية الأولى عندما صمد لواء واحد من الجيش العثماني مؤلف من أقل من ثلاثة آلف جندي فلسطيني في وجه فرقتين بريطانيتين أمام غزة وكبدهم خسائر فادحة وأرغمهما على التقهقر حتى العريش عام 1917 م، أصدر أحمد جمال باشا القائد التركي الذي اشتهر بخصومته للعرب، بيانا رسميا أشاد فيه بالشجاعة الفذة التي أبداها أولئك الجنود الفلسطينيون في غزة أمام أضعاف أضعافهم من جنود الأعداء، وأنها بسالة خارقة تذكر بالشجاعة التي أبداها آباؤهم من قبل عندما حموا هذه البقاع المقدسة بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت غزة بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت غزة مركزا لقضاء غزة في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة، أصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى الدولة الفلسطينية المقترحة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قامت مصر بدخول المدينة عام 1948. في فبراير عام 1949 وقعت كل من مصر وإسرائيل هدنة تقضي باحتفاظ مصر بالمدينة ولذلك كانت مأوى لكثير من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عند خروجهم من ديارهم. وبقيت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nوكانت غزة في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء غزة، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\nحكومة عموم فلسطين\n\nهي حكومة تشكلت في غزة في 23 سبتمبر 1948  وذلك خلال حرب 1948 برئاسة أحمد حلمي عبد الباقي.\nنشأت فكرت تكوينها عندما أعلنت بريطانيا عن نيتها التخلي عن انتدابها على فلسطين وأحالت قضيتها إلى الأمم المتحدة. أدركت القيادة الفلسطينية عندئذ، ممثلة آنذاك بالهيئة العربية العليا لفلسطين بزعامة الحاج أمين الحسيني، أهمية التهيؤ لهذا الحدث واستباقه بإيجاد إطار دستوري يملأ الفراغ الذي سوف ينجم عن انتهاء الانتداب البريطاني وكان هذا الإطار هو إقامة حكومة عربية فلسطينية.\nكان قبل ذلك فولك برنادوت قد أعلن في تقرير له في 16 سبتمبر 1948 أن العرب لم يبدوا أي رغبة في تشكيل حكومة في القسم العربي من فلسطين مما قد يؤدي إلى ضمه إلى شرق الأردن. وقد قوبل إعلان هذه الحكومة بالرفض من عدة أنظمة عربية هي الأردن والعراق ومصر. وظل تمثيلها شكليا لفلسطين في الجامعة العربية لعدة سنوات قبل انهيارها.\n\nالحكم المصري\nبعد حرب 1948، أُلحقت المدينة مع كامل قطاع غزة بمصر، حيث بقت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nفي فترة العدوان الثلاثي على مصر سنة 1956 قامت إسرائيل باحتلال المدينة والسيطرة على شبه جزيرة سيناء المصرية، لكن الضغط العالمي على إسرائيل اضطرها للانسحاب منها.\nحيث حدث في ربيع 1956 عدّة اصطدامات عسكرية بين مصر وإسرائيل حدثت في قطاع غزة. إسرائيل اتّهمت مصر باستعمال المنطقة كقاعدة للغارات الفدائية على إسرائيل. في أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 1956، هاجمت إسرائيل منطقة قناة السويس في مصر بالتعاون مع فرنسا وبريطانيا، استولت القوّات الإسرائيلية على قطاع غزة وتقدّمت إلى سيناء.\nفي مارس/آذار التالي، حلّت قوات طوارئ الأمم المتحدة محل القوات الإسرائيلية، ومصر استعادت السيطرة على الإدارة المدنية للشريط. وأعيد احتلال المدينة في حرب الستة أيام (5 يونيو 1967 - 10 يونيو 1967).\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي غزة وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nكانت مساحة المستوطنات الإسرائيلية في قطاع غزة تبلغ 155 كيلومترا مربعاً تقريباً، وبالنسبة للكتلة المحيطة بمدينة غزة، وهي الكتلة الشمالية، فتتوزع المستوطنات التي تتصل بإسرائيل عبر طرق عرضية تضمن لها سهولة الاتصال، تضم:\n\nمستوطنة إيرتز: (أنشئت عام 1968م) على الحدود الشمالية لقطاع غزة مباشرة.\nمستوطنة إيلي سيناي: تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر ملاصقة تماما لحدود قطاع غزة الشمالية، وهي مستوطنة زراعية أنشئت عام 1983 لاستيعاب عددا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء في أعقاب اتفاقية السلام المصرية ـ الإسرائيلية.\nمستوطنة نيسانيت: (أنشئت عام 1982م) على بعد 5 كم شرق البحر، وهي مستوطنة زراعية، أنشئت لتستوعب أعدادا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء.\nمستوطنة نتساريم: أنشئت عام 1972 م لتقسم قطاع غزة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي، فهي تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر، وعلى بعد 1 كم إلى الغرب من الطريق الرئيس، وعلى بعد 4 كم جنوب غزة، ونظرا لاتساع مساحة هذه المستوطنة، وموقعها المتميز جنوبي مدينة غزة، والمشاكل الناجمة عن هذه المستوطنة، جعلت منها كتلة استيطانية قائمة بذاتها.\nفي ديسمبر 1987، انخرط سكان غزة مبكرًا في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى (انتفاضة الحجارة) وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع غزة مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. وأغلقت المدارس في مدينة غزة قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية قد انسحبت من قطاع غزة في 15 آب / أغسطس 2005 وذلك بقرار من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي أريئيل شارون بعد إنشاءها منذ 38 عاما، تم بعدها تفكيك 21 مستوطنة بقطاع غزة و4 مستوطنات بالضفة الغربية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nبقيت المدينة تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حتى عام 1994، حيث أنه في سبتمبر 1993، بعد مُفاوضات سرية، وقّع كل من رئيس وزراء إسرائيل إسحاق رابين ورئيس منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية ياسر عرفات اتفاقية إعلان مبادئ التي تقر انسحاب إسرائيل من قطاع غزة ومناطق أخرى، وتحويل إدارة الحكومة المحلية للفلسطينيين، وفي مايو 1994، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من المدينة ومن القطاع بشكل جزئي تاركة عدة مستوطنات لها تحت امرة الجيش الإسرائيلي في عمق القطاع، وتولت بموجب إتفاقية أوسلو السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية إدارة المدينة بعد أن كانت تتخذها قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي مقرًا لها أثناء احتلال قطاع غزة ما بين 1967 و1994، وأصبحت منطقة قطاع غزة جُزئيًا تحت حكم السلطة الفلسطينية، إلا أن قطاع غزة ظل فعليًا تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي إلى أن انسحبت إسرائيل بالكامل من أراضي قطاع غزة في 15 أغسطس 2005 بأوامر من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي وقتها أريئيل شارون وأبقت على حصارها برًا وبحرًا وجوًا.\nبعد فوز حركة حماس بعدد كبير من مقاعد البرلمان الفلسطيني في الانتخابات اندلعت العديد من المناوشات المتفرقة بين عناصر من حركتي فتح وحماس ووصل الأمر ذروته في منتصف يونيو من عام 2007 حيث قامت حركة حماس بالسيطرة على كامل قطاع غزة والمؤسسات الأمنية والحكومية فيه.\n\nوفي نهاية عام 2008 وبداية عام 2009 وتحديدا بدءا من 27 ديسمبر 2008، بدأت إسرائيل حرب عدوانية شرسة على قطاع غزة بدأت بالقصف الجوي العنيف لجميع مقرات الشرطة الفلسطينية ثم تتالى القصف لمدة أسبوع للمنازل والمساجد وحتى المستشفيات وبعد أسبوع بدأت بالزحف البري إلى الأماكن المفتوحة في حملة عسكرية عدوانية غاشمة كان هدفها حسب ما أعلن قادة الاحتلال الصهيوني هو إنهاء حكم حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، والقضاء على المقاومة الفلسطينية لا سيما إطلاق الصواريخ محلية الصنع مثل صاروخ القسام أو صواريخ روسية أو صينية مثل صاروخ غراد التي وصل مداها خلال الحرب إلى 50 كم، واستُخدمت القوات الصهيونية الأسلحة والقذائف المحرمة دوليًا مثل القنابل الفسفورية المسرطنة والقنابل آجلة التفجير وغيرها.\nحاصرت القوات الإسرائيلية قطاع غزة، وقطعت عنها الكهرباء والوقود، وحرمت المرضى من الأدوية، ومنعت الدول العربية المُجاورة من إدخال الوقود إلى القطاع، وما زال الحصار مفروضًا على القطاع حتى الآن، وقد قتل كثير من الفلسطينيين من جراء الاشتباكات والتوغلات الإسرائيلية في القطاع، لا سيما حين قصفت مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزة بالصواريخ وتوغلت فيه.\nنزح كثير من الفلسطينيين إلى معبر رفح آملين أن يدخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية ليبحثوا عن السلام، لكن الإدارة المصرية منعت النازحين من الدخول إلى الأراضي المصرية، وقد كسر النازحون معبر رفح في شهر مارس ودخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية وما زالوا يعانون من آثار الحصار إلى الآن.\nوتحاول منظمات إنسانية دولية كسر الحصار المفروض على غزة من خلال إرسال سفن بها عدد من النشطاء، محملة بالمساعدات الإنسانية، إلا أن إسرائيل تمنع وصول تلك السفن، ومن تلك المحاولات أسطول الحرية عام 2010،  وما تعرض له من هجوم عسكري إسرائيلي.\n\nفي نوفمبر 2012، أقدمت إسرائيل على الهجوم على غزة بقصف عشوائي استهدف في بادئ الأمر أحد قادة حماس، إلاّ إنه طال المدنيين بشكل رئيسي، ونتج عنه العشرات من الضحايا. وقد ردّت المقاومة الفلسطينية بشكل غير مسبوق عبر قصفها لمدن في العمق الإسرائيلي كتل أبيب، وهرتسيليا وبئر السبع بعشرات الصواريخ.\nفي صيف 2014، شنت إسرائيل حربًا أخرى على غزة، فبدءا من يوم 8 يوليو 2014 بدأ الجيش الإسرائيلي عملية الجرف الصامد وردت كتائب عز الدين القسام بمعركة العصف المأكول  وردت حركة الجهاد الإسلامي بعملية البنيان المرصوص وذلك بعد موجة عنف تفجرت مع خطف وتعذيب وحرق الطفل محمد أبو خضير من شعفاط على أيدي مجموعة مستوطنين في 2 يوليو 2014،، وإعادة اعتقال العشرات من محرري صفقة شاليط، وأعقبها احتجاجات واسعة في القدس وداخل عرب 48 وكذلك مناطق الضفة الغربية، واشتدت وتيرتها بعد أن دهس إسرائيلي اثنين من العمال العرب قرب حيفا، وتخلل التصعيد قصف متبادل بين إسرائيل والمقاومة الفلسطينية في قطاع غزة. تخلل هذه الحرب عدة عمليات عسكرية مثل عملية ناحل عوز وعملية العاشر من رمضان.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيقع وسط غزة على تلة بارتفاع 45 قدما (14 متر) فوق مستوى البحر. بُنيت جزء كبير من المدينة الحديثة على طول السهل أسفل التل، وخصوصا في الشمال والشرق، وتشكّل ضواحي غزة. يقع كل من شاطئ وميناء غزة على بعد 3 كم (1,9 ميل) عن مركز مدينة غزة. تبعد مدينة غزة 78 كيلومترًا (48 ميل) إلى الجنوب الغربي من القدس، و 71 كيلومترًا (44 ميل) جنوب تل أبيب،  وعلى بعد 30 كيلومترًا (19 ميل) شمال مدينة رفح. مواقع محيطة تشمل بيت لاهيا وبيت حانون، وجباليا إلى الشمال، وقرية أبو مدين، ومخيم البريج ومخيم النصيرات ومدينة دير البلح إلى الجنوب.\nتبلغ مساحة الأراضي التابعة للبلدية ما يُقارب 45 كم مربع (17 ميل مربع). في الانتداب البريطاني، شكلت المناطق الحضرية (المبنية) ما يقارب 7,960 كيلو متر مربع (3070 ميل مربع) أما المناطق الريفية شكلت 143,063 كيلو متر مربع (55,237 ميل مربع). بلغت مساحة الأراضي المروية 24,040 كم مربع (9,280 ميل مربع) والأراضي المزروعة بالحبوب حيث بلغت مساحتها 117,899 كم مربع (45,521 ميل مربع).\n\nيعتمد سكان غزة على المياه الجوفية كمصدر وحيد للشرب والاستخدام الزراعي والمنزلي. يعد وادي غزة أقرب جدول مائي جنوبا. والذي يحتوي على كمية قليلة من الماء في الشتاء أما صيفا فيكاد لا يحتوي على ماء. يتم تحويل معظم إمدادات المياه فيها إلى إسرائيل. المياه الجوفية على طول ساحل قطاع غزة هو الخزان الرئيسي للماء في قطاع غزة وتتكون معظمها من الحجر الرملي العصر الجليدي. مثل معظم قطاع غزة، مغطى غزة بتراب رباعي.\nالمعادن الطينية في التربة تمتص الكثير من المواد الكيميائية العضوية وغير العضوية والتي قد خففت جزئيًا مدى تلوث المياه الجوفية. تلة معروفة في جنوب شرق غزة تسمى (المنطار) وهو ذات ارتفاع 270 قدم (82 م) فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتشكل البلدة القديمة جزء رئيسي من نواة غزة. وتتكون من حي الدرج في الشمال (المعروف أيضًا باسم الحي مسلم) وحي الزيتون في الجنوب. تعود مُعظم المباني إلى العصر المملوكي أو العصر العثماني وبُنيت على بعض المباني القديمة. وتبلغ مساحة البلدة القديمة حوالي 1,6 كيلومتر مربع (0.62 ميل مربع). تتكون غزة من 11 حي، يقع حي الدرج وحي الصبرة ما بين حي الرمال والبلدة القديمة.\n\nحي الشجاعية: من أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، وينقسم إلى قسمين الشجاعية الجنوبية (التركمان) والشجاعية الشمالية (الجديدة)، بُنى خلال عهد الأيوبيين، يسكنه أكثر من 300 ألف نسمة، ويعمل معظم سكانه بصناعات خفيفة مثل الخياطة والزراعة وغيرها كما أنه يمتاز بأنه منطقة تجارية فيها كل الأشكال التجارية والورش، به مقبرتان القديمة، ومقبرة الشهداء، وبه أكبر منطقة صناعية في غزة، وبه معبر المنطار التجاري. وقد شهد هذا الحي العديد من الاجتياحات الإسرائيلية.\nحي التفاح: تعود هذه التسمية لكثرة أشجار التفاح التي كانت تنتشر في هذا الحي وهو من الأحياء القديمة بمدينة غزة.\nحي الرمال: ويعتبر من أرقى أحياء مدينة غزة وأكبرها مساحة بُني في ثلاثينيات وأربعينيات القرن 20، وينقسم إلي الرمال الشمالي والجنوبي. ويمتد الشمالي منه من بداية حي الشيخ رضوان (الشارع الأول) إلى شارع المختار والرمال الجنوبي من شارع عمر المختار إلى بداية حي تل الهوى.\nحي النصر: سُمي الحي بالنصر احترامًا للجمال عبد الناصر الذي بُني في خمسينيات القرن 20.\nحي الزيتون: سمي بذلك لكثرة أشجار الزيتون المزروعة فيه، ولكن تم اقتلاع وتجريف الكثير منها خلال انتفاضة الأقصى وبخاصة في الحرب الأخيرة من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي على قطاع غزة بتاريخ 27/12/2008 م، ويعتبر حي الزيتون أحد أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، حيث يقطنه أكثر من 100 ألف نسمة.\nحي الدرج: وكان يسمى سابقاً «حي بني عامر» نسبة لقبيلة بني عامر العربية التي سكنته مع بداية الفتح الإسلامي ثم حي«البرجلية» نسبة للمحاربين المدافعين عن أبراج المدينة في العصر المملوكي.\nحي الصبرة: من أحياء غزة القديمة نسبيًا ويقع بعد شارع الثلاثيني.\nحي الشيخ رضوان: يمتد من الشارع الأول إلى الشارع الثالث شمالاً ومن شارع النصر غرباً ومن قرية جباليا النزلة شرقاً ويقع الحي على بعد 3 كيلومتر (1.9 ميل) شمال البلدة القديمة.\nحي تل الهوى: وهو أحد الأحياء الجديدة وبرزت فيه العمارة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية إلى غزة حيث أقيمت أغلب المؤسسات الحكومية في هذا الحي، وعند قدوم حكومة حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس عن طريق الانتخابات قامت بتسميته بتل الإسلام، لكن لم تنجح في ذلك، وبقي الناس ينادوه بتل الهوى.\nحي الشيخ عجلين: هو حي يقع في جنوب مدينة غزة بالقرب من الطريق الساحلي. في 18 نوفمبر 2002، هاجمت قوات الدفاع الإسرائيلية الحي، ودمّرت مكاتب جهاز الأمن الوقائي التابع للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nحي الدرج\nالمخيمات\n\nمخيم جباليا: يقع شمال مدينة غزة ويعتبر أكبر المخيمات ولكنه يتبع لمحافظة شمال غزة وليس لمحافظة غزة.\nمخيم الشاطئ: يقع غرب المدينة مقابلاً للساحل.\nمخيم النصيرات: يقع على بعد 8 كم جنوب مدينة غزة وعلى بعد 6 كم شمال بلدة دير البلح ويقع المخيم في وسط قطاع غزة\n\nالمناخ\nتمتاز غزة بمناخ متوسطي وشتاء معتدل جاف، والصيف حار ساخن. يبدأ فصل الربيع في شهر مارس أبريل وأكثر الشهور حرارة يوليو وأغسطس. أما متوسط ارتفاع درجات الحرارة يبلغ 33 سلسيوس (91 درجة فهرنهايت). ويعد شهر يناير أبرد شهور السنة متوسط الدرجات الحرارة المنخفضة يبلغ 7 سلسيوس (45 درجة فهرنهايت). الأمطار شحيحة وتهطل بين شهري نوفمبر ومارس، ويبلغ معدل الأمطار السنوية قرابة (116 ملم). وتهب الرياح على المدينة من الناحية الجنوبية الغربية. يصل أعلى معدل لسرعة الرياح في الشتاء إلى 60 كم في الساعة (نحو 7.3 عقدة/ساعة)، وأعلى سرعة للرياح في كامل السنة هي في شهر يناير بنحو 7.6 عقدة/ساعة، وقد ترجع هذه السرعة إلى مرور المنخفضات الجوية التي عادة ما تصاحبها رياح شديدة. تبلغ سرعة الرياح أدنى معدلاتها في فصل الصيف، فيبلغ المتوسط الفصلي حوالي 5 عقدة/ساعة، وينخفض متوسط سرعة الرياح في فصل الربيع عما هو في فصل الشتاء ليبلغ 6.7 عقدة/ساعة، وتقل سرعة الرياح في الخريف عن فصل الشتاء والربيع بينما تزيد عن فصل الصيف إذ تبلغ 5.6 عقدة/ساعة.\n\nالسكان\nوفقا للإحصاءات العثمانية في عام 1557، كان عدد الذكور 2477. حسب الإحصائيات عام 1596 أظهرت أن عدد المسلمين كان كالتالي (456 أسرة، 115 عزاب، 59 شخص ديني و19 شخص من ذو الاحتياجات الخاصة). أضف إلى أعداد المسلمين، كان عدد الجنود العثمانيون 119 جندي. أما المسيحين كان عدد الأسر 294 أسرة و7 أشخاص عزاب، بينما كان عدد الأسر اليهودية ما يقارب 73 أسرة و8 أسر من السامريون. في المجموع، بلغ عدد سكان غزة 6,000 نسمة وكانت في المركز الثالث كبراً من حيث عدد السكان في فلسطين العثمانية بعد القدس وصفد.\nفي عام 1838، كان عدد المسلمين 4,000 نسمة و 100 من المسيحيين (دافعين للضرائب مقابل حمايتهم) وبالتالي بلغ عدد السكان النهائي 15,000 أو 16,000 نسمة وأصبحت أكبر من القدس من حيث عدد السكان في ذلك الوقت. العدد الكامل للأسر المسيحية بلغ 57 أسرة. قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى بلغ عدد سكان غزة حوالي 42,000 نسمة، وأدى القتال ما بين القوات العثمانية والألمانية وقوات التحالف إلى انخفاض أعداد سكان غزة.\nحسب الإحصائيات عام 1997، من قبل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني بلغ عدد سكان غزة مع مخيم الشاطئ 353,115 منهم 50,9% ذكور و49,1% إناث. تمتاز غزة بكثرة الشباب بنسبة 60,8% وتتراوح أعمارهم ما بين (0-19 سنة). 28,8% من السكان تتراوح أعمارهم (20-44 سنة)، 7,7% ما بين (45-64 سنة)، وبلغت نسبة الذين تجاوزت أعمارهم 64 عام 3,9%.\nبلغ عدد سكان غزة 590,400 نسمة. سكان مدينة غزة وفلسطين عامة ينحدرون من أصول سامية، وكجميع سكان البحر الأبيض المتوسط لهم ملامح عربية سمراء ومتنوعة لا تخلو من تأثيرات متوسطية.\nفي سنتي 2023 و2024 مارست قوت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي قصفا مباشرا على السكان المدنيين حيث قتلت ما يزيد عن 40 ألف فلسطيني جلهم نساء وأطفال من سكان غزة\n\nالدين\nينتمي معظم سكان غزة إلى الدين الإسلامي السني. عندما كانت غزة تتبع الدولة الفاطمية، كان الشيعة مسيطرين على غزة، ولكن بعدما استرجعها القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي رقي بالنهج السني بصرامة دينية وتعليمية، مما كان له دور في توحيد جنوده العربي والترك.\nتوجد أقلية صغيرة من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين حوالي 3,500 نسمة تعيش في المدينة. وغالبية من المسيحيين تعيش في غزة في حي الزيتون في المدينة القديمة، وينتمون إلى الأرثوذكسية الشرقية من القدس، والروم الكاثوليك، والطوائف المعمدانية. في عام 1906، لم يكن هناك سوى 750 مسيحي، منهم 700 شخص يتبعون الأرثوذكسية و50 يتبعون الكنيسة الرومانية الكاثوليكية.\nاستوطن اليهود غزة منذ زمن،  في أسرة يهودية تعيش في غزة  غادر معظمهم من قطاع غزة بعد الثورة الفلسطينية 1929، حينما تكون مجتمعهم من خمسين أسرة. في إحصائيات سامي هداوي للأراضي والسكان، كان عدد سكان غزة 34,250 نسمة، في عام 1945. غادر معظمهم من المدينة بعد حرب عام 1948، وذلك بسبب انعدام الثقة المتبادلة بينهم وبين الأغلبية العربية.\nتحتوي غزة على العديد من مباني العبادة القديمة من أبرزها الجامع العمري، كنيسة القديس برفيريوس ومسجد السيد هاشم حيث يرقد قبر جد الرسول محمد.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت المدينة ولا زالت مركزًا مُهمًا من حيث موقعها الإستراتيجي بين القارتين الآسيوية والإفريقية ووقوعها على شاطئ البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذي يجعل منها ميناء مهما للتجارة وأعمال الصيد، ولكن صعوبة نقل البضائع عبر المعابر مع إسرائيل وعدم سلاسة النقل مع مصر يجعل حجم التبادل التجاري ضئيلًا مع الحجم المفترض بسبب الموقع الجغرافي. نما الاقتصاد في غزة بنسبة 8% في الأشهر ال 11 الأولى من عام 2010، وبنسبة 5.4% في عام 2009، والنشاط الاقتصادي مدعوم إلى حد كبير من خلال التبرعات والمساعدات الخارجية، والذي يعتبر السبب الرئيسي وراء النمو الذي حدث مؤخرا. غزة مثلها كمثل أي مدينة فلسطينية لا تملك عملة وطنية، ويُستخدم الدينار الأردني والدولار الأمريكي والشيكل الإسرائيلي. ويبلغ معدل الناتج المحلي للفرد 1,763 دولار أمريكي (طبـقًا لإحصائية 1997).\nبعد إتفاق أوسلو، تم توظيف الآلاف من السكان في مختلف الوزارات والأجهزة الأمنية، في حين قامت وكالة الغوث والمنظمات الدولية المختلفة التي تدعم تطوير المدينة بتوظيف آخرين.\nيوجد في غزة نقص خطير في مجال الإسكان والمرافق التعليمية والمرافق الصحية والبنية التحتية وعدم كفاية نظام الصرف الصحي، وقد ساهمت كل منها بتهديد النظافة وإنشاء مشاكل في الصحة العامة. هُناك عدد من الفنادق في غزة، مثل فندق فلسطين والقصر الكبير وآدم والأمل والقدس وكليف والديرة وبيت مارنا. تقع الفنادق على طول حي الرمال باستثناء فندق فلسطين. لدى الأمم المتحدة نادي الشاطئ في الشارع نفسه. غزة ليست مقصد للسُياح، مُعظم الأجانب يقيمون في الفنادق وهم صحفيين وعمال الإغاثة والأمم المتحدة والعاملين في الصليب الأحمر. الفنادق الراقية تشمل فندق القدس والديرة.\nووفقًا لتقرير صدر مؤخرًا عن منظمة أوكسفام، تبلغ نسبة البطالة في غزة ما يقارب 40% ومن المُتوقع أن تصل إلى 50%. وقد دُمر القطاع الخاص الذي يؤمن بدوره 53% من جميع الوظائف في غزة، وقد أفلست الشركات، بالإضافة إلى أن 75,000 عامل من أصل 110,000 هم الآن من دون وظيفة. في عام 2008، تم تعليق 95% من العمليات الصناعية في غزة بسبب عدم وجود المواد الخام للإنتاج وعدم القُدرة على تصدير ما يُنتج. في يونيو 2005، بلغ عدد المصانع في غزة 3,900 مصنع التي تُوظف 35,000 شخص، ولكن بحلول ديسمبر 2007، لم يبقَ سوى 195 مصنعًا التي تُوظف 1,700 شخص. أُصيبت صناعة البناء والتشييد بالشلل مع عشرات الآلاف من العاطلين عن العمل. كما أُصيب القطاع الزراعي بأضرارًا جسيمة وقرابة 40,000 عاملًا لا يحصلون على أي دخل وكانوا يعتمدون على الزراعة كمحصول نقدي.\nفي أغسطس 2009، وعدت حماس كل عامل ب100 دولار في شهر رمضان الكريم. أدى زيادة الازدهار نوعًا ما إلى استبدال واسع للعربات التي تجرها الحمير بالتوك توك. ووفقًا لصندوق النقد الدولي، انخفض معدل البطالة ونما الاقتصاد بنسبة 16% في النصف الأول من عام 2010، تقريبًا ضعف سرعة نمو الاقتصاد في الضفة الغربية.\n الزراعة \n\nاشتهرت غزة قديماً بزراعة محاصيل القمح والشعير والقطن والزيتون. وتصديرها إلى العالم العربي والخارجي، وفي غزة الآن العديد من المزروعات وهي: البطاطا، والطماطم، والخيار، والعنب، والفراولة، والتين، والبطيخ، والشمام. وانتشرت فيها البيارات التي تزرع فيها أجود أنواع الحمضيات كالليمون والبرتقال، والتي يعتمد البعض عليها في تغذية النحل.\nويعتمد الري في مدينة غزة على مياه الآبار، ويجري حالياً دراسات لتحلية مياه البحر تقوم بها البلديات في قطاع غزة. كما يعتمد الاقتصاد في غزة بدرجة كبيرة على زراعة وتصدير الأزهار إلى مختلف دول العالم.\nويربي بعض سكان القطاع حالياً الأغنام والماشية، ويعتمدون عليها في تسيير أمور حياتهم، والتي تسهم كذلك في بعض الصناعات المحلية الخفيفة؛ فقد ساهمت بلدية غزة بإنشاء مسلخ حديث ومتطور يتبع أحدث القوانين الصحية والعملية ويعمل أوتوماتيكياً حسب أحدث النظم والأساليب في العالم، ويعتبر من أكثر المسالخ تطوراً في الشرق الأوسط.\n الصناعة \nتشتهر غزة بصناعة عصر الزيتون والصابون الذي يعتمد على الزيت كمادة أولية كما تعتبر صناعة الفخار من أقدم الصناعات الفلسطينية التي اشتهرت بها المدينة والتي تُباع في شوارع أسواق غزة، وكذلك صناعة الغزل والتطريز والبسط التراثية من صوف الماشية والنسيج والملابس القطنية والأثاث المصنوع من الخيزران وصناعة الزجاج الملون كذلك. فقد تم إنشاء قرية الفنون والحرف التي بُنِيَت من الطين على الطراز المعماري القديم، ويمارس عد من الحرفيين الصناعة التقليدية في تلك القرية. وافتُتَح مول غزة الحديث في يوليو 2010.\n\nالسياحة\nتعتمد السياحة في غزة بشكل رئيسي على البحر الذي تشتهر شواطئه برمالها الذهبية البراقة. كما وتعتمد السياحة كذلك على المواقع الأثرية التاريخية المنتشرة في غزة. وتشتهر غزة كذلك بجوها المعتدل صيفاً وشتاءً والذي يشجع الناس بدوره، على ارتياد الشواطئ والحدائق والمنتزهات وعلى قضاء أوقاتهم في المزارع والبيارات وفي المرافق السياحية.\nتضم غزة العديد من الآثار منها الرومانية والمسيحية، وتتنوع الآثار الإسلامية بين المساجد والمدارس والزوايا والأسواق والقيساريات والأسبلة والحمامات والقصور التي تجلت فيها روعة العمارة والفنون الإسلامية، علاوة على مكتبة مهمة احتوت على عديد من المخطوطات.\nإن أقدم المواقع الأثرية بغزة تل العجول بجنوب المدينة على الضفة الشمالية لوادى غزة، وكان على هذا الموقع مدينة بيت جلايم الكنعانية، ويعتقد أن موقع مدينة غزة القديمة كانت على هذا التل منذ 2000 ق.م. وتضم غزة آثاراً مسيحية مثل دير القديس هيلاريون الذي يعتبر مؤسس حياة الرهبنة في فلسطين وكنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس بحى الزيتون الذي يعود تاريخها إلى بداية القرن الخامس الميلادي وآثاراً إسلامية متنوعة منها المساجد الأثرية كمسجد السيد هاشم الذي يقع بحى الدرج بالمنطقة الشمالية الذي يعود للعصر المملوكي، وجدده السلطان عبد الحميد سنة 1850 م. وتحوى غزة زوايا كالزاوية الأحمدية بحي الدرج، علاوة على المنشآت الأثرية المدنية كالأسواق مثل سوق القيسارية بحى الدرج، وهو ملاصق للجدار الجنوبي للجامع العمرى الكبير، ويعود بناء السوق إلى العصر المملوكي، ويتكون من شارع مغطى بقبو مدبب، وعلى جانبي هذا الشارع حوانيت صغيرة مغطاة بأقبية متقاطعة يطلق عليه سوق القيسارية أو سوق الذهب نسبة إلى تجارة الذهب فيه، والقصور مثل قصر الباشا بحي الدرج المكون من طابقين، ويعود للعصر المملوكي وكان مقراً لنائب غزة في العصرين المملوكي والعثماني، والحمامات كحمام السمرة بحي الزيتون، وهو أحد النماذج الرائعة الباقية للحمامات العثمانية في فلسطين والحمام الوحيد الباقي لغاية الآن في مدينة غزة.\nوكذلك تل الرقيش الذي اكتُشف فيه مستعمرة تعود للعهد الفينيقي في هذا التل تحيطها أسوار دفاعية ضخمة ويبلغ طولها حوالي (1600م).\n\nالثقافة\nالأزياء والتطريز \nتعتبر غزة الموطن الأصلي الشاش، القماش من أجل «ثوب غزة» يتم نسجه بالقرب من المجدل (عسقلان). القطن الأسود أو الأزرق أو المقلمة باللونان الزهري والأخضر، والتي تم تصنيعها في المجدل استمرت بالانتشار في باقي مناطق قطاع غزة من قبل اللاجئين من قرى السهل الساحلي حتى التسعينيات. يتميز الثوب الغزاوي بأكمام ضيقة ومستقيمة. وكان التطريز أقل كثافة من تلك المطبقة في الخليل. ومن الزخرفيات تشمل: مقص، مشط وحجاب والتي رتبت في كثير من الأحيان في مجموعات ثلاثية أو خماسية أو سباعية. ويعتبر استخدام الأرقام الفردية في الفولكلور العربي أن يكون فعالا ضد العين الحسود.\n المطبخ \nوقد تأثر المطبخ في قطاع غزة بالأكلات المجاورة حيث تأثرت بمصر بفضل موقعها على ساحل البحر المتوسط. الغذاء الرئيسي للغالبية العظمى من سكان في المنطقة هو السمك. الصناعة الرئيسية بغزة هي صيد الأسماك إما ان تكون مشوية أو مقلية، وتتسم الأطعمة هناك بإضافة الثوم والفلفل الأحمر والكمون ويتم نقعه في مزيج من الكزبرة، الفلفل الأحمر، كمون، ثوم مفروم والليمون. التأثير المصري يظهر أيضا على جانب الاستخدام المُتكرر للفلفل الحار والثوم والشوندرة نكهة لكثير من وجبات الطعام من قطاع غزة. الطبق الوطني لمنطقة غزة هو سماكية.\nالمراكز الثقافية والمتاحف\n\nتوجد في غزة عدة مراكز ثقافية منها مركز رشاد الشوا. تم الانتهاء من بناء مركز رشاد الشوا الثقافي في عام 1988 وأطلق عليه اسم مؤسسه الأمين السابق للمدينة ويقع في حي الرمال. البناء مكون من طابقان على شكل مثلث وتؤدي المراكز الثقافية ثلاثة وظائف رئيسية: مكان للتجمعات الكبيرة خلال المهرجانات السنوية ومكان لتنظيم المعارض ومكتبة. المركز الثقافي الفرنسي هو رمز للتعاون والشراكة في قطاع غزة. تقدم المعارض الفنية والحفلات الموسيقية وعروض الأفلام وغيرها من الأنشطة. ويقدم دعوات للفنانين الفرنسيين لعرض أعمالهم الفنية كلما أمكن ذلك، ويقدم دعوات أيضًا إلى الفنانين الفلسطينيين من قطاع غزة والضفة الغربية للمشاركة في المسابقات الفنية.\nأنشئت في عام 1998 قرية الفنون والحرف وهي مركز ثقافي للأطفال التي تهدف إلى التشجيع الشامل والمنتظم للفن الإبداعي في جميع أشكاله. وتفاعل المركز مع فئة واسعة من الفنانين من جنسيات مختلفة، ونظم قرابة 100 معرض للفن الإبداعي، والسيراميك، والرسومات، والمنحوتات وغيرها. وقد استفاد ما يقرب 10,000 طفل من مختلف أنحاء قطاع غزة من قرية الفنون والحرف.\n\nالرياضة\nيقع ملعب فلسطين «الاستاد الوطني الفلسطيني»، في غزة ولديه القدرة على استيعاب 10,000 شخصًا. وهو بمثابة موطن للمنتخب الفلسطيني لكرة القدم، ولكن بعد غارة جوية إسرائيلية تضرر بشدة ميدان الملعب، وقد لعبت مبارياته في الدوحة، قطر. تملك غزة الكثير من الأندية الرياضية والتي تشارك في دوري قطاع غزة. وتشمل خدمات الشاطئ (مخيم الشاطئ)، اتحاد الشجاعية، نادي غزة الرياضي ونادي الزيتون.\n\nالتعليم\nوفقًا للإحصاء الفلسطيني في عام 1997، كان أكثر من 90% من سكان غزة الذين تزيد أعمارهم على 10 يجيدون القراءة والكتابة. من سكان المدينة، كانوا 140,848 مسجلين في المدارس (39.8% في المدارس الابتدائية، 33.8% في المدارس الثانوية، و 26.4% في المدارس الثانوية العامة). تلقى نحو 11,134 شخص شهادات البكالوريوس أو الماجستير والدكتوراه.\nفي عام 2006، كان عدد المدارس في غزة 210، وتم تشغيل وبناء 151 منها من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية، و 46 من قبل وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين في الشرق الأدنى، و 13 مدرسة خاصة. التحق ما مجموعه 154,251 طالب وكانوا 5,877 يعملون مدرسين. أثر الاقتصاد المضطهد في الوقت الحالي في قطاع غزة. في سبتمبر 2007، كشف استطلاع للأونروا في قطاع غزة، أن الفشل ينتشر بنسبة 80% من الصف الرابع إلى التاسع، وتصل نسبة الفشل في مادة الرياضيات إلى 90%. في يناير 2008، أفادت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (يونيسف) أن المدارس في غزة قامت بإلغاء الفئات التي كانت عالية في استهلاك الطاقة، مثل تكنولوجيا المعلومات، ومختبرات العلوم والأنشطة اللاصفية.\nيوجد في مدينة غزة عدة جامعات وهي: الجامعة الإسلامية-غزة، جامعة الأزهر-غزة، جامعة الأقصى-غزة (كلية التربية سابقا)، جامعة فلسطين وجامعة الأمة وجامعة القدس المفتوحة وهي تعتمد نظام التعليم المفتوح وتضم حوالي 40,000 طالباً. تأسست الجامعة الإسلامية، التي تتألف من عشرة كليات، من قبل أحمد ياسين ومجموعة من رجال الأعمال في عام 1978، مما يجعلها أول مؤسسة للتعليم العالي في قطاع غزة. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 20,021 طالب وطالبة. جامعة الأزهر في غزة والتي تأسست عام 1991، وتأسست جامعة الأقصى في عام 1991. بدأت جامعة القدس المفتوحة تعليمها في مبنى مستأجر في وسط المدينة وكان ذلك عام 1992 وكان عدد الملتحقين بها 730 طالب وطالبة. بسبب الزيادة السريعة في عدد الطلاب، تم تشيد أول مبنى جامعي في منطقة ناصر. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 3,778 طالب.\nوتقع المكتبة العامة في قطاع غزة قبالة شارع الوحدة، وتحتوي على ما يقارب 10,000 كتابًا في العربية والإنكليزية والفرنسية. ويبلغ مجموع مساحتها حوالي 1410 متر مربع (15,200 قدم مربعة)، ويتكون المبنى من دورين وسرداب. افتتحت المكتبة في عام 1999، بعد تعاون رئيس بلدية غزة عون الشوا وبلدية دونكيرك، والبنك الدولي. الأهداف الرئيسية للمكتبة تتمثل بتوفير مصادر المعلومات لتلبية احتياجات المستفيدين، وتوفير التسهيلات اللازمة من أجل الوصول إلى مصادر المعلومات المتاحة، وتنظيم برامج ثقافية متنوعة مثل النشاطات الثقافية والندوات والمحاضرات والعروض السينمائية والفيديو والفن ومعارض للكتب. وكذلك يوجد بها العديد من المراكز المهنية والتدريبية التابعة لوزارة التعليم العالي ووكالة الغوث.\n\nمشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة\nهناك العديد من المشاكل التي تواجه التعليم في قطاع غزة متمثلة في الاتي:\n- الاكتظاظ الطلابي الكبير في الفصول الدراسية نتيجة لازدياد عدد الطلاب وقلة عدد المدارس. حيث أدت الحروب المتتالية الي تدمير المدارس، وادي الحصار الخانق الي صعوبة إعادة اعمارها\n- تعتبر المعابر من المشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة. حيث استمرار اغلاق المعابر لفترات طويلة يؤدي الي صعوبة التنقل للخارج واستكمال الدراسة\n- من المشاكل الأخرى التي تؤثر سلبا على التعليم مشكلة التيار الكهربائي. حيث ادي الانقطاع المستمر للتيار الكهربائي بمعدل 8 ساعات يوميا الي صعوبة مواكبة الطلاب دراستهم وواجباتهم اليومية.\n\nالمعالم\nالبنية التحتية\nالخدمات\nإمدادات المياه والصرف الصحي\nووفقًا لتعداد المكتب المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني عام 1997، فقد كان 98,1% من سكان غزة يملُكون إمدادات المياه العامة في حين أن البقية يستخدمون النظام الخاص. تم ربط حوالي 87.6% إلى نظام الصرف الصحي العام و 11.8% يستخدمون البالوعة.\nبسبب القيود الشديدة التي فُرضت على إمدادات المياه في غزة، ونظام الصرف بها. لم تعد تعمل الآبار الستة الرئيسية لمياه الشرب، وحوالي 50% من السكان لا يحصُلون على المياه بشكل منتظم. يتسرب يوميًا حوالي 20 مليون لتر من مياه الصرف الصحي الخام و40 مليون لتر من المياه المعالجة جُزئيًا في البحر الأبيض المتوسط نظرًا لقطع الكهرباء وعدم وجود الوقود وقطع الغيار في محطات المعالجة في قطاع غزة. وتزعم البلدية أن تراكم القمامة في الشوارع والطرق وفي الآبار، وفيضانات مياه الصرف الصحي في تتسبب خطر تفشي الأمراض والأوبئة الحشرية، وكذلك الفئران وفي المناطق السكنية.\nالرعاية الصحية\n\nتوجد في المدنية عدة مشافي منها مستشفى القدس، والذي يقع في حي تل الهوى، ويديرُه جمعية الهلال الأحمر الفلسطيني، ويعد ثاني أكبر مستشفى في غزة.\nونتيجة القيود الصارمة على الوقود والكهرباء؛ تُعاني المستشفيات حاليًا من انقطاع التيار الكهربائي الدائم الذي يصل إلى 8-12 ساعة يوميًا. يُوجد حاليًا نقص 60-70 في المئة في وقود الديزل اللازم لمولدات الكهرباء التي أُبلغ عنها. ووفقًا لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، تم رفض تصاريح مغادرة 18.5% من المرضى الذين قدموا تصاريح لكي يتلقوا العلاج الطارئ في المستشفيات خارج قطاع غزة في عام 2007.\nالنقل والمواصلات\n\nيمتد شارع رشيد الساحلي والذي يمتد على طول ساحل غزة ويربطها مع بقية الساحل الشمالي في قطاع غزة ومع جنوبه. الطريق الرئيسي في قطاع غزة، هو شارع صلاح الدين (فيا ماريس الحديثة) والذي يمر عبر وسط مدينة غزة، والذي يربط بدوره دير البلح وخان يونس ورفح في جنوب القطاع وجباليا وبيت حانون في شمال قطاع غزة. المعبر الشمالي من شارع صلاح الدين في إسرائيل هو معبر بيت حانون ومعبر من مصر هو معبر رفح. وقد تم إغلاق المعابر من قبل إسرائيل ومصر منذ عام 2007، ولكن بعد الثورة المصرية قد تم إعادة فتح معبر رفح ولن دون تغيرات تذكر.\nيعتبر شارع عمر المختار الشارع الرئيسي في مدينة غزة للتنقل من الشرق إلى الغرب وبالعكس، وهو فرع من شارع صلاح الدين، والذي يمتد من ساحل الرمال في المدينة القديمة وينتهي في سوق الذهب. وقبل الحصار المفروض على قطاع غزة، كان هناك خطوط منتظمة لسيارات الأجرة نحو مدينتان رام الله، القدس والخليل في الضفة الغربية.\nمطار ياسر عرفات الدولي والذي تم افتتاحه عام 1998 بالقرب من مدينة رفح، ويقع على بعد 40 كم (25 ميل) جنوب قطاع غزة. تضررت المدارجات والمنشآت التابعة للمطار إلى حد كبير خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية على يد الجيش الإسرائيلي وهو معطل عن العمل حالياً. يقع مطار بن غوريون الدولي في إسرائيل على بعد 75 كم (47 ميل) شمال شرق المدينة.، وبطبيعة الحال لا يمكن استخدامه من قبل المواطنين الفلسطينيين.\n\nمعاناة المدينة\nالحصار\n\nتقوم السلطات الإسرائيلية بحصار قطاع غزة وبالتالي المدينة حصاراً كاملاً حيث تمنع السفر من وإلى غزة وتمنع عنها مواد البناء والمواد التموينية والأدوية والمحروقات بأنواعها، وقد دمر هذا الحصار الاقتصاد الغزاوي بشكل شبه كامل. وفي أوائل سنة 2009 بدأت إسرائيل في ضرب قطاع غزة كاملاً. وقد زعمت إسرائيل بأن حماس تهدد أمنها وسكانها.\nولكن الشعب الفلسطيني ولم يستسلم وإنما بادر بشق الأنفاق عند حدود الأراضي المصرية، وساعدت هذه الأنفاق بدخول جميع مستلزمات الحياة من مواد غذائية ومواد بناء وأسلحة وأجهزة كهربائية والسيارات. وبعد عام من شن إسرائيل الحرب على غزة قاموا بعقد عدة اتفاقيات وتهدئات ساهمت بتهدئة الوضع في قطاع غزة وفتح معبر رفح والسماح للمُسافرين بالدخول والخروج من المدينة ولكن بتنسيق من حُكومة حماس المُقالة والسلطة المصرية.\nما زال المواطن الفلسطيني يعاني من أزمة الغلاء المعيشي بالإضافة للمعونات التي تقدم للمواطنين فهي تقدم فقط لعائلات معينة وليس للجميع. ومع ذلك فإن سكان قطاع غزة يعيشون في نعيم أكثر من الضفة الغربية باستثناء تواصل انقطاع التيار الكهربائي بحجة عدم وجود الوقود.\nمجزرة غزة\n\nمجزرة غزة أو محرقة غزة هي عملية إسرائيلية جرت في قطاع غزة على مدار خمسة أيام في شهر فبراير 2008 بدعوى القضاء على عناصر حركة حماس المطلقة للصواريخ على الأراضي الإسرائيلية. وقد جاءت هذه التسمية بعد أن وصف وزير الدفاع الإسرائيلي إيهود باراك ما تفعله القوات الإسرائيلية في غزة بهولوكوست أو إبادة عرقية أو محرقة للفلسطينيين في قطاع غزة إثر مقتل جنديين إسرائيليين على يد عناصر من حركة حماس أثناء مقاوماتها للقوات الإسرائيلية؛ فتبنى التسمية عدد كبير من الكتاب والمفكرين والشخصيات السياسية والدينية العرب والمسلمين، حيث يرونها اسم مناسب للعملية، حيث راح ضحيتها 116 شخص من ضمنهم 26 طفلاً فضلاً عن غيرهم من المدنيين ما بين قتيل وجريح. وفي نفس اليوم الذي أعلنت فيه انتهاء العمليات العسكرية في غزة؛ أعلنت مصادر إسرائيلية أنها كانت مرحلة أولى، وأنه قد تكون هناك عمليات أخرى في القريب.\nالعدوان شنته قوات الاحتلال منذ يوم 27 ديسمبر 2008 على قطاع غزة. وقد ذهب ضحية لهذا العدوان حتى اليوم العشرون ما يزيد على 5,000 مدني شهيد اكثرهم من النساء والأطفال وما يقارب الـ 8,000 جريح من المدنيين، ومعظم الجرحى أصبحوا عاجزين أما أهل غزة فقد ظلوا صابرين يواجهون أكبر ترسانة عسكرية بصُدور عارية وقُلوب ثابتة في مواجهة 10,000 طن من القنابل ألقُيت عليهم ومنها قنابل محرمة دوليًا.\nوقد شهدت فترة العدوان أكبر انتفاضة عالمية ضد المجزرة التي ترتكبها إسرائيل ضد أطفال ونساء وعجائز غزة، حيث عرضت وسائل الاعلام صوراً بشعة من غزة هزت العالم فنزلت الشعوب بمئات الألوف تبكي في الشوارع وتطالب بالتحرك لوقف العدوان والجرائم والمحارق والقنابل الإسرائيلية، وأصبحت غزة مدينة عالمية ورمزاً فلسطينياً كبيراً. وقام بعض الفنانين العربيين والعالميين بإبداء دعمهم وتأييدهم لنضال الغزاويين ومواساتهم في كارثتهم. ومنهم أول مغني أمريكي يغني لغزة وهو مايكل هارت.\nوقد أعلن المسؤولون الإسرائيليون امتداد العمليات العسكرية «حسب الحاجة»، في الوقت الذي ما زالت فيه الدول العربية تتجادل فيما بينها علي ضرورة عقد قمة عربية طارئة. علمًا بأن قطر نادت بعقد قمه عربية مُنذ بداية العدوان الإسرائيلي على غزه لمُناصرة الشعب فيها.\nوجاء هذا مصاحبا لمجهودات دولية تندد بالهجمات بوصفها هجمات همجية ووحشية وغير إنسانية البتة وقد قامت مظاهرات غاضبة في بلدان العالم تندد بالمجزرة. وبعد مرور 22 يوماً توقفت الحرب وانسحبت قوات الصهاينة مهزومة لأنها لم تحقق أهدافها. وخلفت وراءها أكثر من 5000 شهيد وأكثر من 8000 جريح وأكثر من 20000 منزل مدمر.\nالجدار الفولاذي\n\nفي ديسمبر 2009، أعلنت مصر عزمها بناء الجدار الفولاذي تحت الأرض بين رفح المصرية وقطاع غزة يصل إلى عمق 30 مترًا وطول 10 كم، من أجل وقف تسلل الفلسطينيين وتهريب السلاح إلى الأراضي المصرية، ووقف تهريب البضائع المصرية بمُختلف أنواعها للأراضي المحتلة.\nحيث أن الهدف من إنشاء هذا الجدار العازل هو القضاء على الأنفاق التي تصل بين مصر وقطاع غزة، وحيث أن هذه الإنفاق هي المدخل الوحيد الآن لكل احتياجات الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزة بعد أن فرضت مصر الحصار على معبر رفح وهو المنفذ الوحيد لغزة على العالم، وضيقت الخناق على أهل غزة، وهناك قضية مرفوعة الآن في مصر ضد قانونية هذا الجدار.\n\nالحكومة\nاليوم، تُعد غزة العاصمة الإدارية لمحافظة غزة. وتحتوي على مبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لمعظم وزارات السلطة الفلسطينية.\nتم تشكيل أول مجلس بلدي في غزة عام 1893 برئاسة علي خليل الشوا. قامت السلطات العثمانية بتعيين أبنه سعيد الشوا عام 1906 عمدة للمدينة. أشرف الشوا على بناء أول مستشفى في غزة وعدة مساجد ومدارس وترميم الجامع الكبير وإدخال المحراث الحديث للمدينة.\n\nفي 24 يوليو 1994، أعلنت السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في غزة وتم تأسيس مجلس المدينة الأول في الأراضي الفلسطينية. لم تعقد الانتخابات البلدية الفلسطينية في غزة ولا في رفح أو في خان يونس. بدلاً من ذلك، اختارت حركة فتح مسؤولي الحزب في المدن الصغيرة والبلدات والقرى لإجراء الانتخابات مع افتراض أنهم سيفعلون ما هو أفضل في المناطق الأقل حضرية. مع ذلك، فازت حماس المنافسة بأغلبية المقاعد، إذ حصلت على سبعة من بين 10 بلديات تم اختيارها لأول جولة ووصلت نسبة الإقبال على التصويت إلى 80% تقريباً. شهد عام 2007 مواجهات عنيفة بين

      "content": "Gaza (en arabe : غَزَّة, Ġazza [/[ˈɣazza]]) est la principale ville de la bande de Gaza. Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe nom de Gaza découle de la racine cananéenne Ġazzā, la « forte » ou « forteresse ».\n\nHistoire\nGaza est attestée au XVe siècle av. J.-C. au temps des Cananéens. La ville fait alors partie de l'Égypte. Depuis, différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé, la ville étant régulièrement assiégée et prise.\n\nAntiquité\nLa première référence à la ville de Gaza remonte au règne du pharaon égyptien Thoutmôsis III (mort en 1425 av. J.-C.). La ville est également citée dans les lettres d'Amarna (sous la XVIIIe dynastie). Son intérêt principal réside dans sa position stratégique sur la route côtière reliant l'Égypte antique et la Syrie. C'est alors un marché important et un poste avancé égyptien faisant partie du « Chemin d'Horus » (série de forteresses réparties entre Tcharou et Gaza).\nDans les années 1190 avant J.-C., les Philistins, un des peuples de la mer (originaires de Crète selon une tradition biblique) s'installent sur la côte sud cananéenne (de Gaza à Jaffa), après avoir attaqué l'Égypte. Les Philistins laisseront leur nom bien plus tard à l'ensemble du territoire, que les Romains appelleront « Palestine ». La ville philistine d'environ quatre-vingts hectares, murée, est construite sur une colline à quarante-cinq mètres d'altitude, à 2,4 km de la mer Méditerranée. Gaza est mentionnée dans la Bible Hébraïque comme l'une des villes principales des Philistins en guerre contre Israël : c'est là que le juge Samson est capturé et qu'il meurt en faisant s'écrouler un temple philistin.\n\n \nEn 525 av. J.-C., la cité est conquise par Cambyse II, grand roi achéménide de l'Empire perse, pour servir de tête de pont à toutes ses campagnes vers l'Égypte. La ville est prise en 332 av. J.-C. par le Macédonien Alexandre le Grand à l'issue d'un siège. Les habitants sont massacrés ou réduits en esclavage.\n\nPuis, dans le contexte des guerres des Diadoques pour la succession d'Alexandre le Grand, la bataille de Gaza oppose en 312 av. J.-C. les Macédoniens Ptolémée Ier, satrape d'Égypte, à Démétrios Ier, fils du général Antigone le Borgne, maître de l'Asie. Victorieux, Ptolémée doit néanmoins rapidement abandonner ses conquêtes en Syrie et en Phénicie.\nEn 145 av. J.-C., Gaza est conquise par Jonathan Maccabée, frère de Juda Maccabée et fondateur de la dynastie judéenne des Hasmonéens.\n\nÉpoques romaine et byzantine\nEn 63 avant notre ère, Gaza devient une partie de la Judée en tant que province romaine.\nDe grandes mosaïques témoignent de la richesse artistique de cette époque. Le christianisme se répand et les premiers monastères apparaissent. Le port de Gaza exporte un vin blanc fameux local : le vinum Gazetum. \nLa synagogue de Gaza est construite en 508/509 dans le centre de la ville antique de Gaza, aujourd'hui le quartier de Rimal, où vivait la communauté juive de Gaza (du IIe siècle av. J.-C. jusqu'au milieu du XXe siècle).\nGaza est représentée sur la carte de Madaba, au VIe siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nLa ville est considérée comme le lieu où serait mort Hachim ibn Abd Manaf, l'arrière-grand-père de Mahomet au cours d'une expédition commerciale, d'où le surnom de la ville « la Gaza de Hashim », « Ghazzat Hashim ». Une mosquée en son nom s'y trouve, la Mosquée d’al-Sayyid Hashim (en), et sous les arcades serait présente sa tombe.\nLa conquête de Gaza par les Arabes intervient très tôt, sans doute en 634. Elle n'est pas évoquée par les sources arabes mais l'est par les sources byzantines : la population civile, alors non musulmane, doit payer tribut aux Arabes et la garnison, constituée de soixante soldats, est emprisonnée et mise à mort quelque temps plus tard. Sous les Omeyyades, une garnison militaire et un atelier monétaire sont implantés en ville. L'islamisation de la cité est progressive : c'est là que naît l'imam al-Chafii (fondateur de l'école de jurisprudence chafiite), mais ce n'est pas là qu'il vécut et enseigna.\nLa petite communauté juive — présente à Gaza depuis la période hellénistique et également dans la ville de Rafah — paye un impôt de protection, et les Dhimmis ne furent pas inquiétés.\n\nLa cité fait peu parler d'elle jusqu'au XIIe siècle et, au moment de la Croisade, elle a beaucoup décliné. Elle est en ruines et peut-être désertée quand les Croisés occupent le site en 1149 et y construisent un château fort dans la partie la plus élevée. Ce château est confié à la garde des Templiers. Au sud du château, se développe la ville franque avec une grande église gothique qui est aujourd'hui la grande mosquée de Gaza, al-Omari, construite pendant la période des Omeyyades au VIIIe siècle. Une autre église, Saint-Porphyre (orthodoxe), datant du XIIe siècle, plus petite, est considérée comme la plus ancienne de la ville encore active. Tenue par les Templiers, apparemment prospère si l'on en juge par la qualité de sa grande église, Gaza constitue l'avant-poste du Royaume franc de Jérusalem face à l'Égypte. Les sources franques la nomment Gazara, et en ancien français Gadres. Elle ne constitue pas un lieu de pèlerinage, et sa renommée en France ne vient que d'une chanson de geste composée vers 1170, Li Fuerre de Gadres (le sac de Gaza), évoquant la prise de la ville par Alexandre le Grand.\nÀ la fin de 1170, le sultan Saladin s'empare de la ville basse mais échoue à prendre le château. Ce n'est qu'en 1187, au lendemain de la bataille de Hattin, qu'il obtient l'évacuation de Gaza par les Templiers et la remise des forteresses de Gaza et de Darom (Deir el-Balah, au sud de Gaza). Le roi d'Angleterre Richard Cœur de Lion reprend Darom et Gaza en 1192, mais négocie ensuite avec Saladin l'abandon de ces positions jugées trop exposées, qu'il fait évacuer après en avoir détruit les fortifications.\nEn 1239, un retour offensif des Francs est brisé à Beit Hanoun, bourgade du nord de Gaza, dont la mosquée abrite les tombes des musulmans qui sont tués au cours de cette bataille. En 1244, a lieu à Hirbiyyah (en latin Furbia, en français « La Forbie ») une bataille bien plus importante opposant une coalition égypto-khowarizmienne et une coalition syro-franque : le roi Al-Salih Ismaël de Damas avait promis aux Templiers de leur restituer Gaza en cas de victoire, mais ils sont défaits. Gaza demeure au pouvoir des Ayyoubides d'Égypte, puis de Syrie, jusqu'en 1260 où la ville est occupée un temps par les Mongols avant d'être reprise par le chef mamelouk Baybars.\nDans les années 1480, des voyageurs indiquent que Gaza est la ville la plus importante de Palestine. Elle est habitée par des Éthiopiens, des Arabes, des Égyptiens, des Syriens, des Indiens, des Juifs (soixante-six familles), des Samaritains (quatre familles) et des chrétiens, plus de sept-mille hommes, au milieu de dix-mille chameaux. Seuls les Juifs y produisent le vin local.\nL'époque des Mamelouks (fin XIIIe - début XVIe siècle) fut pour Gaza une période prospère de renaissance, malgré des crises.\n\nTemps modernes\nLes Ottomans mettent fin au règne des Mamelouks en 1516 après la bataille de Khan Younès. La ville de Gaza et toute la région sont administrées pendant cinq siècles par la province ottomane d'Égypte jusqu'au début du XXe siècle.\nDans la seconde partie du XVIIe siècle, Gaza est décrite par des pèlerins et voyageurs. Elle est la capitale de la province de Palestine qu'un pacha gouverne. Elle n'est plus entourée de murs mais de monticules de pierres. Le turc, l'arabe et le grec sont les langues qui y sont parlées. Elle possède des bains somptueux et d'immenses bazars. La Grande mosquée est entourée de six mosquées et nombre d'oratoires. On y trouve également une église arménienne et une autre, grecque, ainsi qu'une synagogue et un bain rituel.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nPalestine mandataire\nAu tout début du XXe siècle, on dénombre environ quarante-mille habitants dont sept-cent-cinquante chrétiens et cent-soixante Juifs (majoritairement ashkénazes) vivant dans Gaza prospère et paisible.\n\nQuand éclate la Première Guerre mondiale, l'Empire ottoman s'engage aux côtés de son allié, l'Empire allemand. En novembre 1917, à l'issue de la troisième bataille de Gaza, les troupes britanniques, commandées par le général Allenby, s'emparent de la ville. Les Britanniques destituent le maire de Gaza, Saïd al-Shawwa, nommé par les Ottomans. La Déclaration Balfour se montre favorable à l’établissement d'un « un foyer national pour le peuple juif » en Palestine, en précisant que ce projet ne devra pas porter atteinte aux droits civils et religieux des communautés non juives présentes sur le territoire.\nEn 1922, la Société des Nations place la Palestine sous mandat britannique. C'est à partir de cette période que s'accroît l'immigration juive en provenance d’Europe de l’Est, particulièrement lors des persécutions nazies des années 1930.\n\nGuerre de 1948, Nakba et administration égyptienne\nGaza reste sous le mandat britannique jusqu'à l'évacuation des Britanniques en mai 1948, à la suite de la décision de partage de la Palestine du 29 novembre 1947. Le territoire est divisé en deux par une proposition de l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU), avec un État pour les Arabes (sur 42 % du territoire), un autre pour les Juifs (sur 56 % du territoire), et une zone neutre pour Jérusalem (2% du territoire). Cependant, quand Israël déclare son indépendance, le refus de cette solution par les Arabes entraîne une violente guerre en 1948, opposant Israël à ses voisins arabes.\n\nLors de la guerre de 1948, les Israéliens tentent d’empoisonner les puits avec le germe de la typhoïde, comme ils l’ont fait avec succès à Acre. Mais leur tentative, qui a lieu le 27 mai, est déjouée par la surveillance gazaouie et l’armée égyptienne. Gaza est aussi une des rares villes que les Israéliens bombardent durant cette guerre, « les Gazaouis ont la plus longue histoire de victimes de bombardements par Israël, de 1948 à nos jours ».\nÀ la fin du conflit, trois Arabes sur quatre au moins s’exilent ou sont expulsés (Nakba).\nDe 1948 à 1967, la bande de Gaza est administrée par l'Égypte. À la suite de la crise du canal de Suez, elle est occupée par Israël de novembre 1956 au 7 mars 1957. Outre quatre-mille prisonniers, cette occupation cause la mort de 930 à 1 200 Palestiniens arabes pour une population totale de 330 000 personnes.\n\nGuerre des Six Jours et occupation israélienne\nAprès la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967, la bande de Gaza est à nouveau occupée par Israël qui y implantent plusieurs colonies de peuplement juif.\nEntre 1976 et 1981, un mouvement issus des Frères musulmans égyptiens, le Hamas, crée à Gaza l'université islamique de Gaza et d'autres institutions islamiques (al-Mujamma al-islami, al-Jam'iyya al-islamiyya, etc.).\n\nLe 9 décembre 1987, c'est à Gaza que débute la première intifada, la « révolte des pierres », avant de s'étendre à l'ensemble des territoires occupés jusqu'en 1993, année des accords d'Oslo. « Intifada » est d'ailleurs le seul mot arabe qui intègre le vocabulaire de la politique mondiale au XXe siècle. À la suite d’un accident de circulation que les Arabes considèrent comme un acte intentionnel de la part du chauffeur israélien, des jeunes du camp de Jabalia se révoltent et lancent des pierres sur les forces d'autorité. Les artisans se rebellent aussi en ne se rendant pas au travail, et en fermant leur boutique.\nLe 4 mai 1994, l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine (OLP) obtient la gestion de Gaza et de la région de Jéricho. Le président Yasser Arafat et l'Autorité palestinienne s'installent à Gaza.\n\nRetrait israélien en 2005\nEn 2005, à la suite de la seconde intifada, le gouvernement israélien retire unilatéralement ses forces armées et ses colonies de la Bande de Gaza.Le 25 janvier 2006, le Hamas remporte les élections législatives palestiniennes de 2006. Ismaël Haniyeh est nommé Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne. La collaboration avec l'appareil politique mis en place par le Fatah est difficile.\nEn juin 2007, le Hamas prend le pouvoir à Gaza et chasse les tenants de l'Autorité palestinienne. Israël, qui avait gardé le contrôle des frontières, des eaux territoriales et de l'espace aérien, met en place un blocus de la Bande de Gaza.\n\nGuerre de 2023-2025\nEn octobre 2023, éclate la guerre à Gaza, lancée à la suite de l'incursion le 7 du même mois de commandos du Hamas en Israël depuis Gaza (opération dite « Déluge d'Al-Aqsa ») et le massacre de civils israéliens et étrangers, auxquels Israël répond pour officiellement éliminer le Hamas par des bombardements massifs notamment sur la ville de Gaza avec des milliers de civils gazaouis tués sous les bombes, le blocus intégral du territoire, un siège puis une attaque terrestre, l'ensemble entraînant une crise humanitaire alarmante. En juillet 2024, l'armée israélienne ordonne l'évacuation de toute la ville.\n\nLes écoles servant de lieux de refuge pour les déplacés sont régulièrement bombardées, accusées par Israël de cacher des centres de commandement et d'opérations militaires du Hamas, des terroristes ou des armes. Le 1er août 2024, au moins quinze personnes sont tuées lors d'une attaque israélienne contre l'école Dalal al-Mughrabi, tandis que le 3 août, seize autres personnes sont tuées lors du bombardement de l'école Hamama. Le 4 août, au moins trente personnes sont tuées dans des raids aériens israéliens sur les écoles Nassr et Hassan Salama, à l'ouest de la ville, et le 8 août, au moins dix-sept personnes sont tuées dans des attaques contre les écoles Abdul Fattah Hamouda et az-Zahra. Le 10 août, plus de cent personnes sont tuées et cent-cinquante autres blessées après que les forces israéliennes ont bombardé l'école al-Tabin, à l'est de la ville. Le 21 septembre, vingt-et-une personnes sont tuées lors d'une frappe israélienne sur l'école Al-Zaytoun abritant des déplacés, quand Israël précise que sa cible terroriste se trouvait « à l'intérieur » de l'école Al-Falah, adjacente aux bâtiments de l'école Al-Zaytoun.\n\nLa ville est en grande partie détruite par les bombardements. Selon l'International Crisis Group, la stratégie israélienne est de rendre Gaza invivable en obligeant la population à se déplacer constamment et en détruisant tout.\n\nSelon une enquête d'Amnesty International, les destructions sont injustifiées et contraires au droit international humanitaire. Un rapport de Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) dénonce la « campagne de destruction totale menée par Israël » et affirme les difficultés d'accès pour traiter les blessés.Pour certains chercheurs, les destructions planifiées et délibérées de quartiers entiers de Gaza s'apparente à un urbicide.\nLe 22 août 2025, à la suite du rapport de l'organisme indépendant IPC, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare l'état de famine dans la ville, en « raison de l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » dans l'acheminement des vivres. Responsables de l'approvisionnement alimentaire dans les zones sous occupation militaire selon le droit international, le gouvernement israélien réfute cette accusation, parlant de « préjugés antisémites » et de « mensonges ».\nAu 16 septembre 2025, la ville de Gaza est en grande partie dévastée par les bombardements israéliens avec, selon l'ONU, plus de 78 % des immeubles détruits, partiellement ou totalement, y compris les hôpitaux et les écoles.\n\nGéographie\nClimat\nGaza a un climat chaud, semi-aride ou méditerranéen (malgré de très rares précipitations) avec des hivers doux et secs, et des étés chauds. Les mois les plus chauds sont juillet et août, la température moyenne étant de 33 °C. Le mois le plus froid est janvier avec des températures généralement à 7 °C.\nLa pluie est rare et se situe généralement entre novembre et mars, avec des taux de précipitations annuelles d'environ 116 mm (4,57 pouces).\n\nÉducation\nGaza est une ville jeune : environ 60 % de la population de la ville serait constituée de personnes âgées de moins de 18 ans.\nEn 2006, il y avait 210 écoles à Gaza : 151 étaient gérées par le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne, 46 par l'Office de secours et de travaux des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés de Palestine dans le Proche-Orient (UNRWA) et 13 étaient des écoles privées. Au total, 154 251 élèves étaient inscrits, et 5 877 enseignants étaient employés.\nFin 2023, à la suite de la guerre menée par Israël dans la bande de Gaza, toutes les écoles ont dû être fermés et un grand nombre d'établissements sont devenus des lieux de refuge pour la population civile. À la rentrée 2024, plus de 45 000 enfants de classe primaire n'ont pas pu aller à l'école à cause de la situation actuelle. Ils rejoignent les 625 000 élèves déjà privés d’une année scolaire entière. Quant aux universités de la ville, elles ont été partiellement voire totalement détruites par l’armée israélienne en 2024.\n\nPatrimoine\nLe centre-ville comporte un certain nombre de monuments importants. Toutefois, un grand nombre d'entre eux ont été détruits par les bombardements israéliens depuis 2023.\n\nLa Grande mosquée de Gaza (al-Omari), ancienne église datant du XIIe siècle, a gardé son architecture gothique caractéristique. Elle a ensuite été agrandie au XIIIe siècle sous les Mamelouks, qui lui ont notamment ajouté un minaret. L'édifice a été gravement endommagé au cours de la Première Guerre mondiale, puis fut restauré sous le mandat britannique. En décembre 2023, le monument est détruit par l'armée israélienne.\n\nLe musée de la ville occupe un édifice d'époque mamelouke et ottomane, le Qasr al-Basha, magnifiquement restauré au début des années 2000. C'était au XVIIe siècle la résidence du gouverneur ottoman de Palestine et le général Napoléon Bonaparte y a installé son quartier général lors de son passage dans la ville en 1798. Fin 2023, il est en grande partie détruit par les bombardements israéliens.\n\nOn trouve enfin l'église Saint-Porphyre, qui daterait du début du XIIe siècle, centre de la communauté orthodoxe de la ville, dont l'état actuel paraît remonter à l'époque des croisades. Le 19 octobre 2023, l'église Saint-Porphyre est endommagée par une frappe israélienne lors de la guerre à Gaza.\nLe centre-ville compte encore d'anciennes maisons familiales en pierre locale, également de l'époque ottomane.\nL'église de la Sainte-Famille de Gaza est le centre de la communauté catholique de la bande de Gaza. Le 17 juillet 2025, elle est bombardée par l'armée israélienne, causant trois morts et blessant le curé Gabriel Romanelli.\nGaza compte aussi un hammam datant de l'époque ottomane, récemment restauré, puis détruit par l'armée israélienne pendant la guerre de 2023-2025.\n\nInventaire du patrimoine détruit par l'armée israélienne\nSelon l'UNESCO, au printemps 2025, les deux tiers du patrimoine de la bande de Gaza ont déjà été détruits par l'armée israélienne. Sous la conduite de l’historien Fabrice Virgili, un collectif de chercheurs et d'universitaires français recense le patrimoine architectural, et naturel, détruit par l'armée israélienne. Cette base de données, intitulée Gaza, inventaire d'un patrimoine bombardé, met aussi à disposition une carte évaluant les dommages et la destruction des différents sites.\n\nPersonnalités associées à Gaza\nPersonnalités anciennes\nSylvain de Gaza : saint catholique et orthodoxe, évêque de Gaza, décapité en 311.\nHilarion de Gaza : ascète chrétien (291-371).\nProcope de Gaza : sophiste et exégète chrétien de la fin du Ve siècle.\nZacharie le Rhéteur : évêque et écrivain religieux de la fin du Ve siècle, frère de Procope de Gaza.\nÉnée de Gaza : néo-platonicien converti au christianisme du Ve siècle.\nPorphyre de Gaza : évêque de Gaza et saint chrétien fêté le 26 février.\nIsidore de Gaza : philosophe néo-platonicien, chef de l'école néoplatonicienne d'Athènes vers 490.\nTimothée de Gaza : grammairien et auteur d'un traité zoologique.\nDorothée de Gaza : saint catholique et orthodoxe, moine.\nChorikios de Gaza : rhéteur grec du VIe siècle, natif de Gaza.\nBarsanuphe de Gaza : saint catholique et orthodoxe, moine (VIe siècle).\nAl-Châfi'î : juriste musulman (762-820), fondateur de l'école chaféite.\nSamonas de Gaza : poète et théologien chrétien de langue arabe (Xe – XIe siècle).\nNathan de Gaza : théologien juif, né à Jérusalem (1643–1680), connu pour avoir été le prophète du faux messie Sabbataï Tsevi.\n\nPersonnalités récentes\nMohammad 'Assaf est un palestinien né 1989, et ayant vécu à Gaza pendant sa jeunesse dans un camp de réfugiés à Khan Younis.

Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.",

      "content": "## Overview\nThe Gaza Strip (Arabic غزة, Ghazzah, Hebrew עזה Azza) is a Palestinian territory in the Middle East. The capital and largest city is Gaza. Portions of this page may be out of date because the situation on the ground changes quickly.\n\n## Understand\nPositioned between Israel and Egypt, Gaza Strip contains several towns and cities that have grown together. The capital and largest city is Gaza, with Khan Yunis and Rafah being the second and third largest. Several smaller villages are nestled between these cities. It does have reasonably modern infrastructure and architecture despite its troubles, but a UN report as early as 1952 stated that the Strip was too small to support its population of 300,000, and now there are well over 1.7 million inhabitants. On 7 October 2023, the Israel-Hamas War broke out, and thousands of people have been killed.\nMost inhabitants are descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from their homes in Israel during or after the 1948 war and were not allowed to return to their homes and villages. As they were not Egyptian citizens they were not allowed into Egypt, either.\n\n## History\nGaza has been around for a while: the earliest known reference is an inscription in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, Egypt, dated 1500 BC, which states that the town of Gaza is 'flourishing'. And for a long time it did: a staging post on trade routes connecting Asia and Persia with Arabia, Egypt and Africa, even the name means \"treasure\" in Arabic. Alexander the Great laid siege to the town in 332 BC, executing 10,000 defenders after being held off for two months. Later, the town was held by the Romans, the Crusaders, the Mamluks, the Ottomans and briefly even by the French in 1799, when Napoleon Bonaparte set up camp on his way to defeat in Egypt. The Turks took it back, then lost it to the British in World War I. The Egyptian army grabbed it during the 1948 war that led to Israel's independence, opening camps for Palestinian refugees who fled and were expelled from their homes by Israeli forces — and the current situation began when Israel occupied the Strip in 1967.\nSpurred by the violence of the 1987–1993 Intifada (\"Uprising\"), Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a \"Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements\" in 1993, under which the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created to govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a transitional period \"not exceeding five years\" as a step towards full independence.  Parts of the territories were indeed handed over to the PA between 1994 and 1999, but the peace plans were derailed by the second intifada that broke out in September 2000, unleashing another spiral of violence.\nIsrael unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in 2005, evacuating Jewish settlements and withdrawing its troops from the territory. It did however retain control of the airspace and the coastline in addition to the fact the entire region is circled by a large armed security fence. The Islamist Hamas won elections in 2006 and violently kicked out or killed the remnants of the Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Under Hamas rule, there have been repeated incidents of missile launches from Gaza into Israel and Israeli targeted assassinations of terrorists in Gaza, bombings, and incursions or invasions of Gaza. Israel has also heavily restricted the movement of trade, aid, and people between Gaza and Israel in response to attacks on border crossing points and the Hamas government's non-recognition of Israel. Relations between Hamas and the Egyptian government have also been tense at times, with the Egyptian government sometimes blaming Hamas for attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians in the Sinai but also condemning Israeli actions against Gaza. From December 2008 to January 2009, Israel launched a massive coordinated air, naval, and land offensive against the Hamas government and allied militant organizations. Hostilities resumed in 2012, but a short-lived ceasefire was restored with the help of Egyptian mediation.\nIn 2025, Israel is at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It's very unlikely that you will be able to get into Gaza unless you are an accredited journalist, or UN or charity worker, and you will have performed in-depth risk assessments. Do not rely on a travel guide for your risk assessment. Civilian infrastructure has been hit very hard, and your presence in the strip will divert resources from the needy.\n\n## Geography\nThe Gaza Strip is a narrow, 40-km long slice of land between the Mediterranean to the west and the Negev desert to the east.  Egypt lies to the south, the north and east border Israel.  The urban sprawl of Gaza City, mostly stretching along and around the 3-km long Omar al-Mukhtar Street, covers much of the north. The other main towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah are near the southern border, with most of the rest covered with agricultural land.\nA bit of terminology disentanglement: Gaza Strip refers to the entire 40km by 6km patch of territory. The strip is slightly smaller than Barbados and slightly larger than Malta. Gaza City refers to the town itself, in the northern part of the strip, but due to huge population growth the City now sprawls into many of the surrounding villages and it's a tough task to say what is a part of the City and what isn't. Both city and strip are pretty much interchangeably referred to as Gaza and this guide will follow suit.\n\n## Climate\nTemperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers.\n\n## Terrain\nFlat to rolling, sand and dune covered coastal plain. Cultivated land.\nHighest point: Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda) 105 m (344 ft)\n\n## Get in\nGetting into Gaza is both difficult and unwise. As of around 2003, all would-be visitors were required to apply in advance for Israeli permission to enter the Strip. The application is usually submitted through your embassy in Israel and, in theory takes between 5–10 days. In practice, it can take months, and if you're not either a fully accredited journalist or an aid/human rights worker, you're unlikely to get permission to enter Gaza from Israel.\nBecause of the Israel-Hamas war, it is not possible to enter Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing.\n\n## By plane\nGaza has no functioning airport, as the former Yasser Arafat International Airport (GZA  IATA) has been shut down, and the runway was destroyed by Israeli bulldozers in 2002. The closest airports are El Arish International Airport in Egypt (which has no commercial flights) and Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv (TLV IATA). The closest non-Israeli commercial airports are Jordan's Queen Alia International Airport (AMM IATA) and King Hussein International Airport (AQJ IATA), while the closest Egyptian-controlled airport with non-charter commercial service is Cairo International Airport (CAI IATA). Taba International Airport (TCP  IATA) is closer than Cairo, but only charter flights fly there.\n\n## Entry by land\nThe main point of entry is through the Erez crossing in the north, on the border with Israel. Getting to Erez is easiest done by taxi, it's also possible to travel by Dan BaDarom[dead link] bus #20 from Ashkelon to the checkpoint.\nYou will need a permit from the Israeli Army, or a GPO (press) card. If you have a permit, you need coordination with the Israeli Army, specifying when you are planning to enter and leave Gaza. Journalists with a Government Press Office (GPO) card can come and go as they please. Only vehicles with prior coordination (such as a handful of UN cars) are allowed to drive in and only after a thorough search, which may take months. It's very helpful to travel with someone that's run the gauntlet before the first time via Erez.\nAt Erez, you have to approach the Israeli soldier in a pillbox. They may ask you to open your bags on the table, and (as at TLV) ask if you have weapons. They'll check your passports and permits for allowed entry. You then wait outside an electronic gate for your turn to be called through. You then enter the terminal, hand your passport and coordination over to another soldier to receive an Israeli exit stamp. That soldier may or may not ask you more questions, usually things like whether it's your first time in Gaza, etc.\nIf everything is satisfactory, take back your documents and follow the signs directing you to Gaza. After exiting the terminal, you end up in a long barren concrete tunnel. Don't bring anything too bulky as you'll have to go through a turnstile gate. Coming through the tunnel, you cross a no-man's-land. This is at least 1000m long. Palestinians are allowed in this area so you may be lucky and find a porter, trolley, wheelchair, or similar. Take it. If you take the tuk-tuk, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times and enjoy the ride.\nAfter the gated tunnel you will emerge near a small hut. This is a checkpoint which can be ignored on the way to Gaza (but ignored at your peril on the way back). The only people here will be a few taxi drivers.\nTake a taxi to the Palestinian checkpoint, another 800 m down the road. The going rate is ₪3 per person. You will be searched for unlawful items (make sure you are, it's the hut to the right. Also visit the hut to the left to check your Hamas credentials)\nProhibited goods include alcohol and non-halal food, banned by the Hamas government. If you fail inspection, then at best, your items will be confiscated. At worst, you will be arrested; you are unlikely to see any guns at this point. In a particularly bad situation, retreat to Israel.\nOnce you are through, you can take another taxi, or more likely be picked up by your local contact.\n\n## Exit by land\nEntry, though difficult, pales in comparison to exit. After being deposited at the Hamas checkpoint near Hamsa Hamsa, go to the white caravan to your right to get your exit clearance.\nOnce through, take the taxi (₪3/person) to the forward checkpoint (where the wire fence begins). Then, go to the hut on the right.\nA man will take your passport and call ahead to tell the Israelis you're coming. Ignore this at your own peril.\nOnce you get your passport back, take the tuk-tuk if possible, or begin the 1 km+ walk to Israel.\nWhen you reach the end of the tunnel, you'll see several doors. Once a handful of people have gathered, one of the doors will open (indicated by a green light on top of the door).\nYou will then enter a hall with a table at the centre. Open your bags at the table (there are no obvious signs to do this, but look up and there's a camera. They are checking for obvious things like large bombs)\nWhen they've ensured you have no prohibited items in your bags, go through the turnstile when the light flashes green. You will not receive a verbal \"OK\", but rest assured you will be shouted at in Hebrew if you're not ok.\nYou will see toilet facilities to your right. Use them. Follow the arrows to Israel. You will then encounter another hall with eight doorways. Wait until one of the lights go green then enter that doorway. Leave your bags with the porter at a large security scanner. You should remove all electronics not just laptops, but things like disk drives, mobile phones, etc.) and place them in the large trays. Remove your belt, watch, etc. too.\nKeep your passport and ID on you and enter a series of gates as the lights flash green. When you come to the body scanner (an MMW scanner), put your feet on the markers and place your hands over your head in an \"I surrender\" pose. Keep your passport in your hands. If you've passed initial screening, you will be allowed out to a hall where it appears as if your bags will emerge on a conveyor belt. There may even be empty trays circling it.\nWalk straight through to the departures hall, as your bag will be selected for a hand search. On your left in a row where trays with bags will gather, and you can see the guards searching your bags. Wait patiently. If you haven't passed initial screening, you'll be directed through further scanning. There is a separate section that will reveal itself to you if the guards in the gallery above find the need for a strip search.\nOnce you collect your belongings, you will finally pass through Israeli entry, and get a new stamp in your passport. You're then free and in Israel. Count yourself lucky you own a western passport.\nExit from Gaza could take from 30 minutes to several hours. The checkpoint closes at 14:00, or even earlier. If you are stuck between Hamas and Israel phone your embassy for assistance, but don't try to re-enter Gaza. If you're using Erez you're probably \"western\", and you're safer in Israeli hands.\n\n## By boat\nThe port of Gaza is non-operational, and Gazan waters, seaports, and the coastline are patrolled by the Israeli Navy. If you attempt to reach the Gaza shoreline by boat, you will be stopped by Israeli naval vessels, and turned back. Only boats with prior permission are allowed in. All boats coming from Gaza are allowed to venture six nautical miles into the sea. Any vessel crossing this line is fired on. In 2010 a six-ship flotilla attempted to reach Gaza by sea, and was intercepted by Israeli warships; ten people were killed by Israeli forces and the ships never reached Gaza. It is strongly recommended not to attempt to visit Gaza in this manner.\n\n## Get around\nThere is no public transport in Gaza, but there are numerous service (ser-VEESS) taxis.  Navigation is done by landmark, not street address. Stand on the side of the road that is in the desired direction of travel.  When a driver stops indicate the destination landmark e.g., \"Shifa\" and the number of passengers (\"wahid\" for one, \"it-nayn\" for two.)  If the driver is not headed that way, he may drive on. Travel up and down Omar al-Mukhtar St. will set you back ₪1; trips elsewhere are negotiable.  Near al-Shifa hospital is a line of taxis that travel to destinations beyond Gaza city.  The drivers yell out their destination and wait until their vehicle is pretty much full before they leave. It is advisable to watch your step if walking, since traffic is chaotic and sidewalks are largely non-existent.\n\n## Talk\nThe standard language is Arabic. Hebrew is also understood to some extent, but given the dislike towards Israelis by many Palestinians, English is a safer option.\n\n## See\nGaza is not exactly a top tourist destination and most of its attractions have taken quite a beating during the past 50 years.\n31.50122234.4713891 Grand Omari Mosque (جامع غزة الكبير, Jāmaʿ Ghazza al-Kabīr). Makes up for its lacklustre appearance with an interesting history: it's a converted Crusader church built on the site of a Hellenic temple with pillars from a 3rd-century Jewish synagogue.      (updated Feb 2015)\n31.49988934.4693752 Ibn Uthman Mosque (مسجد ابن عثمان). Completed in 1431.   (updated Feb 2021)\n31.50416434.4690143 Ibn Marwan Mosque. Built in 1324.

(updated Oct 2023)\n31.50395934.462036 Church of Saint Porphyrius. Orthodox church, celebrating Saint Porphyrius who was Bishop of Gaza around 395-420 CE. The current church was built around 1150 by crusaders and renovated extensively in 1856.      (updated Feb 2015)\n31.52408434.4519937 Holy Family Church (كنيسة العائلة المقدسة). Only Catholic church in Gaza.   (updated Aug 2023)\n31.50441734.4659678 Qasr al-Basha (قصر الباشا). Dating back to the 13th century, this former fort is now a museum.   (updated Oct 2022)\n31.34319434.3033069 Caravanserai of Yūnus al-Dawādār (In Khan Yunis, next to the Great Mosque). Also known locally as Barquq Castle. This fortified khan (Arabic inn) dates back to 1387 AD.   (updated Aug 2023)\n31.34360934.30254910 Great Mosque of Khan Yunis (المسجد الكبير) (In Khan Yunis). Main mosque in Khan Yunis, built in 1928.  (updated Aug 2023)\n31.368534.341811 Al-Qarara Cultural Museum (متحف القرارة الثقافي) (In Khan Yunis).    (updated Aug 2023)\n31.44722234.36638912 Ruins of Saint Hilarion Monastery. Located att the archaeological site Tell Umm el-'Amr, Saint Hilarion was an active monastery for four centuries, from the late Late Roman to the Umayyad period. Named after Hilarion the Great (291–371 AD), who is venerated as a saint by the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church. The tell and monastery were listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2024.   (updated Aug 2023)\n31.512134.48213 Gaza War Cemetery, Salah al-Din Rd. Burial site of over 3,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen who perished in the First World War, mainly in the battles for Gaza during 1917.   (updated Aug 2023)\nMore educational might be a UNRWA-arranged visit to one of the refugee camps that dot the strip. The UNRWA office is on al-Azhar St, near the Islamic University, call ahead to see if they can arrange a little tour. Your most probable destination is the optimistically named Beach Camp, a warren of concrete huts and open sewers housing 63,000 people, built next to a sandy beach - and you can walk there on your own, 15 minutes to the north from the intersection of Omar al-Mukhtar St. with the seafront road. UNRWA wisely recommends avoiding military clothing. The Jabaliya refugee camp is also a nearby option. Women visiting the camps should dress more conservatively than they need to in Gaza City - headscarves are certainly recommended.\n\n## Do\nThere's very little to do in Gaza for the average tourist. There is a beach, however the water isn't the cleanest in the area, you'd be better off on a beach further north in Israel. There are nice sunsets though over the Med, which can be seen from hotels like the Al Deira.\n\n## Buy\nDespite the intense conflict and rhetoric, Gazans use the Israeli shekel (₪). But bring some boxes of cigarettes into the Strip and everyone will be your friend. However, please note the policemen at the Hamas checkpoint into Gaza are now opening all bags and disposing of any alcohol (since early 2009). Do not bring alcohol into Gaza, it could land you into serious trouble and it is always good to respect local Islamic customs.\n31.51996134.4480561 Gaza City Centre. This elegant  mall  opened in 2010 is the place to be to escape the hubbub of Gaza's bustling Rimal district. With a fully-stocked supermarket, fast food restaurant and multiple shops, Gazans have quickly taken to this place. Enjoy the relaxing fountains if you have had enough of shopping or need a break. The Gaza Mall is comparable to most Western-style malls only in structure and comfort, but not even remotely in size. You will usually find it packed to the brim with residents of Rimal in the summer escaping the midday heat and may quickly find you want to escape elsewhere.\nPLO Flag Shop. A bit tough to find (ask around) but unmistakable once you spot it. It's the place to buy Palestinian flags, stickers, badges, and pennants. (updated May 2020)\nInteresting sculptures / lampshades fashioned from old cigarette cartons.\nFoustouk and simsimiya. The former is a sticky peanuty snack. The latter is its sesame cousin. An elderly man in Gaza City with a grey tweed jacket crops up on a different street corner when he has a fresh batch.\n\n## Eat\nUsual Arabic cheap eats are available anywhere. Head to the posh suburb of Rimal for fancier food; the restaurant in the Windmill Hotel is nice. If you wish to bring in any food, you should first check which foods are and are not acceptable under Islamic law. If you are caught with forbidden food, it may lead to trouble with the authorities or the local population. Finally, it is not unheard of to be invited over for dinner.\nAbu Hassera. Fish specialist.\nAldeira Restaurant. On the seaside terrace, this restaurant serves lovely mezes (small Mediterranean-style dishes), including the Gazan speciality Daqqa (a sometimes very spicy chili salad, very nice). They also have some tasty main courses: try the shrimps in tomato sauce, baked in the oven, and served in a clay pot. And don't miss out on the fresh strawberry juice! Enhanced with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, it is highly enjoyable.\nMatouk (behind the legislative council building). Serves an excellent chicken tawwouk.\n31.51662634.4499771 [dead link] Roots Club, Cairo St, Remal (in the heart of Gaza City), ☏ +972 8 2888666, fax: +972 8 2888999, info@rootsclub.ps. Fine dining. Offers both high end Arabian/Mediterranean cuisine and cheaper fast food at the Big Bite annex. The restaurant frequently caters for special events, including foreign dignitaries and heads of non-governmental organizations.\nSeafood Restaurant (just north of al-Deira hotel). Very good seafood restaurant.\nAl Mat'haf Resort (Soudnya beach), ☏ +970 8 2858444. On a small hill overlooking the sea in Gaza stands “Al-Mathaf” (Arabic for “The Museum”, pronounced Al-Mat-Haf), a one-of-a-kind recreation and cultural center that showcases Gaza’s rich historical past and seamlessly blends it into the context of life in modern Gaza. As its name suggests, Al-Mathaf is home to Gaza’s finest archaeological museum, which is filled with beautiful artifacts that celebrate Gaza’s rich cultural heritage. Alongside these historical treasures of ancient civilizations, today’s Gazans gathers at Al-Mathaf’s beautiful Restaurant-Café, a center of modern culture and recreation in Gaza. In a time when many in Gaza have forgotten our heritage, Al-Mathaf aims to preserve the region's rich history, provide a venue for modern cultural dialogue, and carry a message for this generation to build a brighter future.\n\n## Drink\nDue to increasingly strong Hamas influences, alcohol is no longer available. Alcohol is forbidden in their interpretation of Islam, and Hamas, as a conservative Islamic group, prohibits it. If you do manage to find some, you should not attempt to go out under the influence; you may land in a very bad situation. If you are caught with booze on your person by Hamas authorities, it will probably be confiscated, and you may be detained. Bags are given a quick search on entry to Gaza.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are several hotels in Gaza. However, it is also possible to stay with locals who might even invite you over for a night.\n31.527534.43711 Al Deira Hotel (فندق الديرة غزة فلسطين), ☏ +972 8 283 8100, fax: +972 8 283 8400, info@aldeira.ps. Massive rooms with a view of the sea, breakfast included. Most international journalists and NGOs stay at the Deira, which has a back-up generator, a business centre and WiFi. Pleasant (though by Gaza's standards not superb) restaurant (with Shisha pipes, although not allowed in the fine Oriental bedrooms). Don't be alarmed that the water tastes salty. Rooms include non-alcoholic minibar, hairdryer, towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a little plate of cookies. $100–185USD/night.      (updated Sep 2023)\nCommodore Hotel. Has a sauna, jacuzzi, massage, multiple restaurants, 24-hour room service, a swimming pool, and reportedly Kosher food.\nGrand Palace Hotel, Al Rasheed Street, ☏ +970 8 2849498, fax: +970 8 2849497, info@grandpalace.ps. At the beach side of Gaza city, 3km from city centre, direct beach view, conference, food and beverage facilities.\nMarna House. Gaza's oldest hotel, run by a friendly family.\n31.54763934.4568772 Al Mat'haf Hotel, info@almathaf.ps (Soudunya beach), ☏ +970 8 2858444. As a second phase, Al-Mathaf is just completed the construction of a boutique hotel, which will feature traditionally designed rooms with a sea view, as well as multi-purpose halls and facilities to provide business services, as well as health, fitness, and spa facilities.    (updated Jul 2017)\n31.579834.4823 Grand Chalet (جراند شاليه), +970 566 400 040. Luxury lodging by the sea.    (updated Dec 2021)\n\n## Work\nRealistically, if you are not already an aid worker, journalist or diplomat, there is no work for you in Gaza. There are a number of NGOs offering internships, such as the Al-Dameer Association for Human Rights in Gaza, the Palestinian Center For Human Rights and others, but these must be arranged well before you get to Gaza.\n\n## Stay safe\nAs of August 2024, Gaza is at war and almost certainly the single most dangerous location to travel to. Anybody who somehow makes it in shouldn't expect any form of food, water, or medicine other than what they brought in themselves. Disease is rampant as a result of poor sanitation, and as of July 2024, there's been an outbreak of polio. Bombings can happen anywhere, including the refugee camps, at any time. If you find yourself in danger (which is likely), your government will not be able to offer any form of assistance.\nGaza's power station and its substation have been severely damaged by Israeli airstrikes and no longer function at the intended capacity. Power outages are very common. These outages are countered by large industrial and small commercial diesel generators which combine to create a cacophony that the locals have somehow become desensitised to. Some of these generators are poorly maintained and leak carbon monoxide. Visitors should be wary of this, particularly in enclosed spaces where it has proven fatal.\n\n## Stay healthy\nTap water in Gaza is not potable and is often dangerously dirty. Some hotels may use filters, but if in doubt, just buy bottles.\nIsrael has blockaded the area since 2007. However, food and medical supplies are generally allowed in after inspection. Any medical requirements should be taken care of in Israel or elsewhere. Anyone visiting Gaza is well advised to have a good grounding in first aid and bring in their own first aid kits. Beware that medical evacuations to Israel can require a long wait at the border.\nDiseases such as yellow fever, malaria and West Nile virus are fairly common in the Gaza Strip. Get vaccinated, wear protective clothing and use mosquito repellent.\n\n## Respect\nWomen should dress conservatively, especially if entering refugee camps. Conservatively within Gaza City means a top with long sleeves and absolutely nothing low cut in the front. Ideally, tops should also be long. Trousers are suitable as long as they are loose and full length, not capri pants.\n\n## Go next\nIsrael\nEgypt",
