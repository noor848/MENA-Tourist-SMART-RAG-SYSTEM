      "content": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\n\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as Hierapolis. However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to Hierolophos.\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh. The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש). The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only—Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies—United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now closed. There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 °C (75.6 °F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\n\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine. In 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 Time magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\n\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\n\nUrban structure\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafés and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nTransportation\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\n\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (Jibal al-Quds), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division. The club has won Israel's championship in 2015, the State Cup four times, and the ULEB Cup in 2004.\nThe Jerusalem Marathon, established in 2011, is an international marathon race held annually in Jerusalem in the month of March. The full 42-kilometre race begins at the Knesset, passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City's Armenian Quarter, and concludes at Sacher Park.

      "summary": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.",

      "content": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.\n\nالتسمية\nأوّل اسم ثابت لمدينة القدس هو «أورسالم» الذي يظهر في رسائل تل العمارنة المصرية، ويعني أسس سالم؛ وسالم أو شالم هو اسم الإله الكنعاني حامي المدينة، وقيل مدينة السلام. وقد ظهرت هذه التسمية مرتين في الوثائق المصرية القديمة: حوالي سنة 2000 ق.م و1330 ق.م، ثم ما لبثت تلك المدينة، وفقًا لسفر الملوك الثاني، أن أخذت اسم «يبوس» نسبة إلى اليبوسيين، المتفرعين من الكنعانيين، وقد بنوا قلعتها والتي تعني بالكنعانية مرتفع. تذكر مصادر تاريخية عن الملك اليبوسي «ملكي صادق» أنه هو أول من بنى يبوس أو القدس، وكان محبًا للسلام، حتى أُطلق عليه «ملك السلام» ومن هنا جاء اسم المدينة وقد قيل أنه هو من سماها بأورسالم أي «مدينة سالم».\nظهر الاسم «أورشليم» أوّل ما ظهر في الكتاب المقدس، وفي سفر يشوع تحديدًا، ويقول الخبراء اللغويون أنه نحت، أي دمج، لكلمتيّ أور، التي تعني «موقع مخصص لعبادة الله وخدمته»، والجذر اللغوي س ل م، الذي يعني على ما يُعتقد «سلام»، أو يشير إلى إله كنعاني قديم اسمه «شاليم»، وهو إله الغسق. أطلق العبرانيون على أقدم الأقسام المأهولة من المدينة اسميّ «مدينة داود» و«صهيون»، وقد أصبحت هذه الأسماء ألقاب ونعوت للمدينة ككل فيما بعد بحسب التقليد اليهودي. حُرّف اسم القدس من قبل الإغريق خلال العصر الهيليني، فأصبح يُلفظ «هيروسليما» (باليونانية: Ἱεροσόλυμα)، وعند سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية على حوض البحر المتوسط، أطلق الرومان على المدينة تسمية «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» (باللاتينية: Colonia Aelia Capitolina) سنة 131 للميلاد. في بعض الرسائل الإسلامية باللغة العربية من القرون الوسطى، وخصوصًا في العهدة العمرية، تذكر المدينة باسم «إيلياء» أو «إيليا» وهو على ما يبدو اختصار لاسمها اللاتيني. ذُكرت المدينة في فترة لاحقة من القرون الوسطى باسم «بيت المقدس»، وهو مأخوذ من الآرامية בית מקדשא بمعنى «الكنيس». ولا يزال هذا الاسم يُستخدم في بعض اللغات مثل اللغة الأردية، وهو مصدر لقب «مقدسي» الذي يطلق على سكان المدينة.\nأما اسم القدس الشائع اليوم في العربية وخاصة لدى المسلمين فقد يكون اختصارًا لاسم «بيت المقدس» أو لعبارة «مدينة القدس» وكثيرًا ما يُقال «القدس الشريف» لتأكيد قدسية المدينة. أما السلطات الإسرائيلية فتشير في إعلاناتها إلى المدينة باسم «أورشليم القدس».\n\nتاريخ القدس\nنظرة شاملة\nتلعب القدس دورًا أساسيًا عند الحديث عن القومية العربية عمومًا والوطنية الفلسطينية خصوصًا، وكذلك بالنسبة للقومية الإسرائيلية أو الصهيونية، لذا فإن الحديث عن تاريخها الطويل، الذي يمتد لأكثر من 5,000 سنة، غالبًا ما يأخذ منحى متحيزًا من الناحية الأيديولوجية. فعلى سبيل المثال، يُركز القوميون الإسرائيليون على الحقبة التاريخية التي استوطن فيها بنو إسرائيل أرض فلسطين ويزعمون بأن جميع يهود العالم اليوم ينحدرون من أولئك القوم إلى جانب المكابيين، مما يدعم قضيتهم الهادفة إلى توطين يهود العالم في فلسطين ويعزز من موقفهم أمام الشعوب المختلفة، حيث يُظهرون أنهم الورثة الشرعيين للمدينة والبلاد ككل. ومن ناحية أخرى، يُركز القوميون العرب والفلسطينيين على الحقبتين المسيحية والإسلامية وغيرها من الحقبات غير الإسرائيلية في تاريخ المدينة، مما يدعم قضيتهم التي تقول بأن الفلسطينيين الحاليين هم ورثة المدينة والبلاد بما أنهم ينحدرون من جميع الشعوب والأمم التي سكنت القدس وفلسطين عبر العصور وتزاوجت واختلطت. وكنتيجة لهذا التباين، يزعم كل من الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين أن الطرف الآخر يُحرّف التاريخ لتحقيق مصالحه الخاصة والقضاء على مصالح الآخر، ولتأييد ادعائه بأحقيته بالمدينة، وبطبيعة الحال فإن كل طرف وجد المؤيدين لرأيه، وأغلبهم من ذات القومية، والمعارضين، وأغلبهم من القومية الأخرى.\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nأظهرت بعض التنقيبات الأثرية وجود بعض الأواني الخزفية في مدينة داود، الواقعة ضمن حدود القدس حاليًا، والتي تعود لحوالي الألفية الرابعة قبل الميلاد، أي منذ العصر النحاسي، وأظهرت اكتشافات أخرى وجود مستعمرة بشرية قامت خلال أوائل العصر البرونزي (ما بين عاميّ 3000 و2800 ق.م تقريبًا)، ويقول بعض المؤرخين أن من أسسها هم الكنعانيون الذين سكنوا فلسطين في الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وخلال هذه الفترة قدم إليها العرب الساميون في هجرتين كبيرتين: الأولى في بداية الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، والثانية في بداية الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، بينما يقول آخرون، مثل عالمة الآثار البريطانية كاتلين كينيون، أن القدس تأسست على يد قوم ساميين شماليين غربيين حوالي سنة 2600 قبل الميلاد. ورد أول ذكر لتجمع سكاني في موقع القدس في رسائل اللعنة الفرعونية من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد، ويُذكر موقع القدس فيها باسم أشمام كأحد تجمعات العدو الذي يجب لعنه كي لا يضر بالجيوش المصرية.\nتنص التوراة على أن المدينة تأسست على يد سام بن نوح، وعابر حفيد سام، من أسلاف النبي إبراهيم (وهو أبو الأنبياء جميعا وجدهم)، وسكنها في ذلك الوقت شعب يُعرف بشعب اليبوسيين، فسُميت المدينة «يبوس» تيمنًا بسكانها. ازدهرت المدينة في عهد ملكي صادق، وهو أحد ملوك اليبوسيين خلال فترة بعثة إبراهيم، واستمر الوضع كما هو إلى حين عهد يشوع، عندما دخلت المدينة في نطاق الأراضي الخاضعة لبني بنيامين، يشوع 28/18] إلا أنها استمرت مأهولة باليبوسيين بعد أن لم يتمكن بنو بنيامين من طردهم. سيطر الملك والنبي داود على المدينة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، بعد أن احتلها من اليبوسيين، وجعل منها عاصمة لمملكته. أظهرت أعمال التنقيب مؤخرًا وجود أساسات حجرية ضخمة في وسط القدس، قال الإسرائيليون بأنها بقايا هيكل داود، وقد توقفت أعمال التنقيب بعد أن صرّح الخبراء باعتقادهم هذا، إلى حين أن يتم التصديق على هذا الأمر من قبل مفسري التوراة.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nتنص المخطوطات العبرانية على أن النبي داود دام حكمه لمملكة إسرائيل 40 عامًا، وبالتحديد حتى سنة 970 ق.م، وبعد وفاته خلفه ولده سليمان الذي حكم طيلة 33 عامًا، وفي عهده تمّ تشييد هيكل المدينة على جبل موريا، بالإضافة إلى هيكل سليمان الشهير، الذي يلعب دورًا مهمًا عند اليهود، كونه يمثل المستودع الذي حُفظ فيه تابوت العهد وفقًا للمعتقد اليهودي. أصبحت القدس تُسمى بالمدينة المقدسة في عام 975 ق.م، وشكّلت عاصمة لمملكة إسرائيل الموحدة، وبعد وفاة سليمان انقسمت المملكة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي وذلك بعد تمرد الأسباط العبرية الشمالية بسبط يهوذا الجنوبي الذي كان آل داود ينتمون إليه. سُمي القسم الجنوبي بمملكة يهوذا في الجنوب، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة لها تحت قيادة رحبعام بن سليمان. وفي سنة 587 ق.م، احتل الملك البابلي «نبوخذ نصّر الثاني» مدينة القدس بعد أن هزم آخر ملوك اليهود «صدقيا بن يوشيا»، ونقل من بقي فيها من اليهود أسرى إلى بابل بمن فيهم الملك صدقيا نفسه، وعاث في المدينة دمارًا وخرابًا وأقدم على تدمير هيكل سليمان، مما أنهى الفترة التي يُطلق عليها المؤرخون تسمية «عهد الهيكل الأول».\n\nبعد 50 سنة من السبي إلى بابل، سمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن أراد من أسرى اليهود في بابل بالعودة إلى القدس وإعادة بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود إلى القدس وشرعوا ببناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنة 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الأول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه. وحوالي سنة 445 ق.م، أصدر الملك الفارسي «أرتحشستا الأول» مرسومًا سمح فيه لسكان المدينة بإعادة بناء أسوارها، واستمرت المدينة عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا طيلة العقود التي تلت. فقدت الإمبراطورية الفارسية فلسطين بما فيها القدس لصالح القائد والملك المقدوني، الإسكندر الأكبر، عام 333 ق.م، وبعد وفاته استمر خلفاؤه المقدونيون البطالمة في حكم المدينة، واستولى عليها في العام نفسه بطليموس الأول وضمها مع فلسطين إلى مملكته في مصر عام 323 ق.م. ثم في عام 198 ق.م، خسر بطليموس الخامس القدس ومملكة يهوذا لصالح السلوقيين في سوريا، بقيادة أنطيوخوس الثالث الكبير. حاول الإغريق أن يطبعوا المدينة بطابعهم الخاص ويجعلوا منها مدينة هيلينية تقليدية، لكن هذه المحاولة باءت بالفشل سنة 168 ق.م، عندما قام المكابيين بثورة على الحاكم أنطيوخوس الرابع، تحت قيادة كبير الكهنة «متياس» وأبنائه الخمسة، ونجحوا بتأسيس المملكة الحشمونائيمية وعاصمتها القدس سنة 152 ق.م. استولى قائد الجيش الروماني «پومپيوس الكبير»، على القدس في عام 63 ق.م بعد أن استغل صراعًا على سدّة المُلك بين الملوك الحشمونائيمية، وبهذا ضُمت القدس إلى الجمهورية الرومانية.\n\nالحروب اليهودية الرومانية\nأقدم الرومان على تنصيب حيرود الأول ملكًا على اليهود ليضمنوا سيطرتهم وتحكمهم بمملكة يهوذا، فكرّس حيرود عهده لتجميل المدينة وتطوير مرافقها، فبنى عددًا من الأسوار والقصور والأبراج والقلاع، وقام بتوسيع المعبد حتى تضاعف حجم المنطقة حيث يقع. وبعد وفاة حيرود الأول في السنة السادسة قبل الميلاد، خلفه حيرود الثاني في حكم القدس من عام 4 قبل الميلاد حتى 6 بعده وعندها أخضع الرومان مملكة يهوذا للحكم الروماني المباشر نتيجة لعدم ثقة الحكومة بحيرود، فأصبحت تُعرف بمقاطعة اليهودية، على الرغم من أن خلفاء حيرود الأول، المتحدرين من أغريباس الثاني، استمروا بحكم المناطق المجاورة بوصفهم ملوك تابعين لروما حتى سنة 96 ميلادية.\nشهد الحكم الروماني المباشر للقدس حوادث كثيرة، أولها الثورة اليهودية الكبرى، التي استمرت من سنة 66 إلى سنة 70م، حيث قام اليهود في القدس بأعمال شغب وعصيان مدني قمعها الحاكم الروماني «تيطس» بالقوة فأحرق المدينة وأسر كثيراً من اليهود ودُمّر المعبد للمرة الثانية، وعادت الأمور إلى طبيعتها في ظل الاحتلال الروماني للمدينة المقدسة. ثم عاود اليهود التمرد وإعلان العصيان مرتين في عاميّ 115 و132م، والمرة الأخيرة عُرفت بثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، تيمنًا بقائد العصيان، وخلالها تمكن اليهود بالفعل من السيطرة على المدينة، وأعلنوها عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا مجددًا، إلا أن الإمبراطور الروماني «هادريان» تعامل مع الثوّار بعنف وأسفر ذلك عن تدمير القدس للمرة الثانية، وأخرج اليهود المقيمين فيها ولم يبق إلا المسيحيين، ومن شدّة نقمة الإمبراطور على اليهود، أصدر مرسومًا بجعل المدينة ذات طابع روماني فتم تغيير اسمها إلى «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» واشترط ألا يسكنها يهودي، بل أقدم على تغيير اسم مقاطعة اليهودية بكاملها وجعله «مقاطعة سوريا الفلسطينية» (باللاتينية: Syria Palaestina) تيمنًا بالفلستينيون الذين سكنوا الساحل الجنوبي الكنعانيون.\n\nخضعت المدينة لسيطرة الرومان ثم الروم البيزنطيين خلال القرون الخمسة التي تلت ثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، وبعد أن نقل الإمبراطور الروماني قسطنطين الأول عاصمة الإمبراطورية الرومانية من روما إلى بيزنطية، وأعلن المسيحية ديانة رسمية للدولة، أمر بتشييد عدد من المعالم المسيحية بالقدس، فبنيت كنيسة القيامة عام 326م، فكانت تلك نقطة تحول بالنسبة للمسيحيين في المدينة، حيث لم يعودوا مضطهدين، واستطاعوا ممارسة شعائرهم الدينية بحريّة. أصبحت القدس مركزًا لبطريركية من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، وهي إلى جانب القدس: الإسكندرية وروما والقسطنطينية وأنطاكية، بعد أن تقرر إنشائها في مجمع نيقية. استمرت القدس بالنمو والاتساع منذ أن انتهى عهد الهيكل الثاني بعد تدمير الأخير، حيث بلغت مساحتها كيلومترين مربعين (0.8 أميال مربعة.) ووصل عدد سكانها إلى حوالي 200,000 نسمة. استمر حظر دخول اليهود إلى القدس طيلة عهد قسطنطين الأول حتى القرن السابع الميلادي.\n\nحروب الروم والفرس\nانقسمت الإمبراطورية الرومانية عام 395م إلى قسمين متناحرين: الإمبراطورية الغربية وعاصمتها روما، والإمبراطورية الشرقية أو البيزنطية وعاصمتها القسطنطينية، وخضعت القدس مع باقي بلاد الشام إلى الإمبراطورية الأخيرة. شجع الانقسام الروماني الفرس على الإغارة على القدس، فأمر شاه الإمبراطورية الساسانية، كسرى الثاني، قائدا جيوشه «شهربراز» و«شاهين»، بالسير إلى سوريا واستخلاص القدس من أيدي الروم، ففعلا ما طُلب منهما ونجحا في احتلالها، خصوصًا بعد أن ساعدهم اليهود في فلسطين، الذين كانوا ناقمين على البيزنطيين.\nفتح الفرس المدينة في سنة 614م، بعد حصار استمر 21 يومًا. تنص السجلات البيزنطية أن الفرس واليهود ذبحوا آلاف المسيحيين من سكان القدس، وما زال هذا الأمر موضع جدال بين المؤرخين، حيث قال البعض بصحته ونفاه البعض الآخر. استمرت المدينة خاضعة للفرس طيلة 15 سنة، إلى أن استطاع الروم استعادتها سنة 629م تحت قيادة الإمبراطور هرقل، وظلت بأيديهم حتى الفتح الإسلامي عام 636م.\nيؤمن المسلمون أنه خلال هذه الفترة، وبالتحديد في عام 621م تقريبًا، شهدت القدس زيارة النبي محمد، حيث أسرى به الملاك جبريل ليلاً من المسجد الحرام إلى المسجد الأقصى ثم صعد إلى السماوات العلى حيث رأى الأنبياء والرسل السابقين وعاد بعد أن خاطب الله الذي علّمه عدد الصلوات المفروضة على الإنسان، وبهذا الحدث، أصبحت القدس ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي\nأصبحت القدس مدينة مقدسة بالنسبة للمسلمين بعد حادثة الإسراء والمعراج، وبعد أن فُرضت الصلاة على المسلمين، أصبحوا يتوجهون أثناء إقامتها نحو المدينة، وبعد حوالي 16 شهرًا، عاد المسلمون ليتوجهوا في صلاتهم نحو مكة بدلاً من القدس، بسبب كثرة تعيير اليهود للنبي محمد وللمسلمين بسبب استقبالهم لقبلة اليهود، ولأسباب أخرى.\n\nفي عهد عمر بن الخطاب والفتوحات الإسلامية، أُرسل عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح لفتح فلسطين عامة ونشر الدعوة الإسلامية فيها، لكن القدس عصيت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعة أسوارها، حيث اعتصم أهلها داخل الأسوار. وعندما طال حصار المسلمين لها، طلب رئيس البطاركة والأساقفة، المدعو «صفرونيوس»، طلب منهم أن لا يسلم القدس إلا للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب بشخصه. فأرسل عمرو بن العاص يخبر عمر في المدينة بما طلبه صفرونيوس رئيس الأساقفة المسيحيين في القدس فاستشار الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب أصحابه فكان أول من تكلم عثمان بن عفان فقال: «أقم ولا تسر إليهم فإذا رأوا أنك بأمرهم مستخفن ولقتالهم مستحقر فلا يلبثون إلا اليسير حتى ينزلوا على الصغار ويعطوا الجزية». وقال علي بن أبي طالب: «إني أرى أنك إن سرت إليهم فتح الله هذه المدينة على يديك وكان في مسيرك الأجر العظيم». ففرح عمر بن الخطاب بمشورة علي فقال: «لقد أحسن عثمان النظر في المكيدة للعدو وأحسن علي المشورة للمسلمين فجزاهما الله خيراً ولست آخذاً إلا بمشورة علي فما عرفناه إلا محمود المشورة ميمون الغرة».\nفقصد عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه ومعهما ناقة إلى بيت المقدس في رحلة شاقة. وما أن وصلا مشارف القدس حتى أطل عليهما صفرونيوس والبطاركة وسألوا من هذين الرجلين فقال المسلمون إنه عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه، فسأل أيهما عمر فقيل ذاك الواقف على قدميه إذ كان خادمه ممتطيا الناقة فذهلوا بهذا لأنه مذكور في كتبهم، فكان الفتح العمري لبيت المقدس. كتب عمر مع المسيحيين وثيقةً عُرفت باسم «العهدة العمرية» وهي وثيقة منحتهم الحرية الدينية مقابل الجزية، وتعهد بالحفاظ على ممتلكاتهم ومقدساتهم، وعرض صفرونيوس على عمر بن الخطاب أن يؤدي الصلاة في كنيسة القيامة بعد أن حان موعدها أثناء زيارته لها، فخرج من الكنيسة وصلى على مبعدة منها وعاد. ولمّا سأله البطريرك صفرونيوس عن السبب أجابه أنه يخاف من أن يتخذ المسلمون من فعله ذريعة فيما بعد للسيطرة على الكنيسة فيقولون من بعده «ها هنا صلّى عمر» وبالتالي يحولون الكنيسة إلى مسجد للمسلمين. سمح المسلمون لليهود بالرجوع للسكن في المدينة بعد فتحها، وطبقوا عليهم ما طبقوه على المسيحيين من حماية لمقدساتهم مقابل الجزية. أقام المسلمون مسجدًا في الموقع الذي صلّى به عمر بن الخطاب، بالقرب من مدخل كنيسة القيامة اليوم، وقال الأسقف الغالي «أركولف» الذي عاش في القدس من سنة 679 حتى سنة 688، أن مسجد عمر كان مبنًى خشبيًا مربع الشكل بُني على أنقاض بعض المباني والمنشآت، وكان يتسع لحوالي 3,000 مصل.\n\nقام عمر بن الخطاب بعد فتح المدينة بالبحث عن مكان المسجد الأقصى المذكور في القرآن والصخرة المقدسة واضعًا نصب عينيه الرواية التي سمعها من محمد ليلة الإسراء، وسأل الصحابة وكعب الأحبار، وهو من اليهود الذين أسلموا، والبطريرك صفرنيوس، وكان عمر بن الخطاب يراجع المرافقين له حين يدلونه على مكان لا يجد أوصافه تنطبق على ما لديه قائلاً: «لقد وصف لي رسول الله صلّى الله عليه وسلم المسجد بصفة ما هي عليه هذه». وقد عثر الخليفة على مكان المسجد الأقصى والصخرة المقدسة في وقت قصير، وكان المكان مطموراً بالأتربة التي تكاد تخفي معالمه. وأمر عمر بن الخطاب بإقامة مسجد موضع المسجد الأول، وإقامة ظلة من الخشب فوق الصخرة المقدسة، وعندما جاء الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة فوق الصخرة المقدسة عام 691، ثم بنى الخليفة الوليد بن عبد الملك الجامع القبلي عام 709. يقول المؤرخ من القرن العاشر، محمد بن أحمد شمس الدين المقدسي، أن عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة وجعل منها ذهبية كي تطغى على قبب الكنائس المنتشرة في القدس، ولتصبح معلمًا بارزًا يلفت نظر الزائر أوّل ما يراها. اهتم الأمويون والعباسيون بالمدينة فشهدت نهضة علمية في مختلف الميادين، لكن شهرتها سرعان ما تضعضعت بسبب عدم الاستقرار الذي شهدته الدولة العباسية وانقسامها إلى دويلات عديدة.\n\nعهد الصليبيين، الأيوبيين، والمماليك\nأدّى تفكك الدولة العباسية إلى دويلات متناحرة إلى ضعف العمل بالشريعة الإسلامية من قبل بعض الحكّام، فلقي المسيحيون كثيرًا من الاضطهاد، وهُدمت كنيسة القيامة في القدس خلال عهد الخليفة الفاطمي، أبو علي منصور الحاكم بأمر الله، وتعرّضت حياة الحجاج الأوروبيين للخطر. وعندما سقطت القدس بقبضة الأتراك السلاجقة سنة 1076، ازدادت الحالة سوءًا وكثر التعدي على الحجاج الأوروبيين بشكل خاص بسبب ما كانوا يحملونه معهم من النفائس والأموال، فكانت تلك إحدى الأسباب التي أدّت لنشوب الحروب الصليبية. انطلق الصليبيون في حملتهم الأولى سنة 1095 متوجهين إلى مدينة القدس، فوصلوها في سنة 1099 وضربوا الحصار عليها فسقطت في أيديهم بعد شهر من الحصار، وقتل الصليبيون فور دخولهم القدس قرابة 70 ألفًا من المسلمين واليهود وانتهكوا مقدساتهم، وقامت في القدس منذ ذلك التاريخ مملكة لاتينية تُحكم من قبل ملك كاثوليكي فرض الشعائر الكاثوليكية على المسيحيين الأرثوذكس مما أثار غضبهم.\n\nاستطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد القدس من الصليبيين عام 1187 بعد معركة حطين، وعامل أهلها معاملة طيبة، وأزال الصليب عن قبة الصخرة، ودعا اليهود والمسلمين ليعودوا إلى المدينة، واهتم بعمارتها وتحصينها. ولكن الصليبيين نجحوا في السيطرة على المدينة بعد وفاة صلاح الدين في عهد الإمبراطور فريدريش الأول بربروسا إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة، وكانت القدس في هذه الفترة قد ضعف شأنها وأفل نجمها وأصبحت مجرّد قرية عاديّة نظرًا لتراجع أهميتها الإستراتيجية، خصوصًا بسبب انهماك أولاد صلاح الدين بالنزاع فيما بينهم، وعدم تركيزهم على محاربة الصليبيين. ظلت القدس بأيدي الصليبيين 11 عامًا إلى أن استردها نهائياً الملك الصالح نجم الدين أيوب عام 1244.\nتعرضت المدينة لغزو التتار الخوارزميين عام 1244، الذين قضوا على القسم الأعظم من سكانها المسيحيين وطردوا اليهود منهم. هُزم التتار على يد المماليك بقيادة سيف الدين قطز والظاهر بيبرس في معركة عين جالوت عام 1259، وضمت فلسطين بما فيها القدس إلى السلطنة المملوكية التي حكمت مصر والشام بعد الدولة الأيوبية حتى عام 1517. وخلال هذه الفترة تعرّضت المدينة والمنطقة ككل لسلسلة من الزلازل وتفشّى فيها وباء الطاعون الأسود.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت جيوش العثمانيين فلسطين بقيادة السلطان سليم الأول بعد معركة مرج دابق في سنة 1517، وأصبحت القدس مدينة تابعة للدولة العثمانية طيلة 400 سنة حتى سقوطها بيد قوّات الحلفاء في الحرب العالمية الأولى سنة 1917. تمتعت القدس بعهد من الرخاء والازدهار خلال عهد السلطان سليمان الأول \"القانوني\"، خليفة سليم الأول، حيث أعاد الأخير بناء أسوار المدينة وقبة الصخرة. استمرت القدس خلال معظم العهد العثماني مجرّد مدينة محلّية عادية ولم يعلوا شأنها التجاري أو الثقافي بشكل يُذكر، لكنها بقيت من ضمن المدن العثمانية المهمة نظرًا لمكانتها الدينية. تطوّرت الحياة المقدسيّة بشكل ملحوظ خلال القرن التاسع عشر بعد أن أنشأت السلطات العثمانية عدد من المرافق الحديثة لتسهيل حياة الناس، فافتتح مركز للبريد وأنشأت خطوط سير نظامية مخصصة لمركبات الجياد العمومية، وأُنيرت الشوارع بالمصابيح الزيتيّة، وفي أواسط القرن سالف الذكر أنشأ العثمانيون أوّل طريق معبّدة بين القدس ويافا، وبحلول عام 1892، كانت المدينة موصولة بغيرها من المدن الشاميّة والحجازية بسكة حديدية.\nخلال الفترة الممتدة من عام 1831 حتى عام 1840، أصبحت فلسطين جزءًا من الدولة المصرية التي أقامها محمد علي باشا، وخلال هذا العهد أخذت الإرساليات والقنصليات الأجنبية تضع موطئ قدم لها في المدينة. وفي سنة 1836، سمح إبراهيم باشا بن محمد علي، سمح لليهود أن يعيدوا إنشاء أربعة معابد رئيسيّة، ومن ضمنها كنيس الخراب. ثار الشوام على الحكم المصري بعد أن استقر في البلاد لأسباب مختلفة منها زيادة الضرائب بمقدار لم يعهده الناس أيام العثمانيين والتجنيد الإجباري في الجيش المصري، وكان من ضمن هذه الثورات ثورة قامت في سنة 1834 بفلسطين بقيادة قاسم الأحمد، الذي قاد جيشًا من الثوّار من مدينة نابلس تعاونه عشائر بلدة أبو غوش، وهاجم القدس ودخلها بتاريخ 31 مايو 1834، لكن الجيش المصري استطاع أن يرد الثوّار على أعقابهم في الشهر التالي.\nعادت القدس إلى الحكم العثماني بعد هزيمة المصريين أمام الجيوش الحليفة العثمانية والأوروبية سنة 1840، إلا أن كثيرًا من المصريين بقي واستقر بالمدينة، وفي نفس الفترة قدمت وفود من اليهود والمسلمين المغاربة، من مدينة الجزائر وغيرها من مدن المغرب العربي، واستقرت في القدس. أخذت القوى العظمى في العالم تتدخل في الشؤون الداخلية العثمانية بشكل متزايد خلال عقد الأربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بحجة حماية الأقليات الدينية في الدولة العثمانية، وقد لعب القناصلة في القدس دورًا كبيرًا في هذه المسألة. أفاد القنصل البروسي بالقدس أن عدد سكان المدينة في سنة 1845 وصل إلى 16,410 نسمة، منهم 7,120 يهودي، 5,000 مسلم، 3,390 مسيحي، 800 جندي تركي، و100 شخص أوروبي. ارتفعت نسبة الحجاج المسيحيين في المدينة خلال العهد العثماني، الأمر الذي كان يجعل جمهرة المسيحيين بالقدس تتضاعف في حجمها خلال موسم الفصح.\n\nأخذت المنازل تظهر خارج أسوار القدس خلال عقد الستينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بعد أن ازداد عدد سكان المدينة بفعل المهاجرين، ولإقامة منشآت أكثر صحيّة مخصصة لاستضافة الحجاج المسيحيين، خصوصًا وأن كثيرًا منهم كان يشتكي من الاكتظاظ السكاني داخل المدينة ومن رداءة نظام الصرف الصحي. ومن المنشآت المهمة التي برزت خلال هذه الفترة، المجمّع الروسي سنة 1860، الذي خُصص لاستقبال وإيواء الحجاج الروس الأرثوذكس. قدّرت إحدى إحصائيات إرسالية أمريكية عدد سكان القدس سنة 1867 «بأكثر من» 15,000 نسمة، 6,000 منهم مسلمين، وما بين 4,000 إلى 5,000 منهم يهود، كذلك تبيّن أن عدد الحجاج الروس كان يتراوح بين 5,000 إلى 6,000 حاج كل عام. أنشأت الدولة العثمانية عام 1880 متصرفية القدس، وأزيل الحائط القديم للمدينة عام 1898 لتسهيل دخول القيصر الألماني ڤيلهلم الثاني وحاشيته أثناء زيارته للقدس. وظلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني حتى هزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني وحرب سنة 1948\nسقطت القدس بيد الجيش البريطاني بقيادة الفريق أول إدموند ألنبي في سنة 1917، بعد أن تقهقر الجيش العثماني مهزومًا أمامهم، وفي سنة 1922 منحت عصبة الأمم بريطانيا حق الانتداب على فلسطين وإمارة شرق الأردن والعراق، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة فلسطين تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nدخلت المدينة في عهد جديد كان من أبرز سماته زيادة أعداد المهاجرين اليهود إليها خاصة بعد وعد بلفور الذي أصدرته الحكومة البريطانية، وقد أظهرت بعض إحصائيات تلك الفترة أن عدد سكان المدينة ارتفع من 52,000 نسمة عام 1922 إلى 165,000 نسمة عام 1948 بفعل هجرة اليهود. أدّى ازدياد عدد اليهود في فلسطين عمومًا والقدس خصوصًا، وشرائهم للأراضي ومساعدة البريطانيين لهم، أدّى إلى استياء المقدسيين من مسلمين ومسيحيين، فقامت أعمال شغب في سنتيّ 1920 و1929، وعُرفت الأخيرة بثورة البراق، قُتل خلالها عدد من اليهود. عمل البريطانيون على إخماد هذه الثورات، وساهموا في جعل اليهود يستقرون في المدينة عن طريق بنائهم لأحياء سكنيّة كاملة في شمال وغرب المدينة، وإنشائهم لعدد من مؤسسات التعليم العالي، مثل الجامعة العبرية.\nأحيلت قضية القدس إلى الأمم المتحدة بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية، فأصدرت الهيئة الدولية قرارها في 29 نوفمبر سنة 1947 بتدويل القدس تحت رعايتها وإشرافها. وجاء في القرار أنه سوف يُطبّق طيلة 10 سنوات، ويشمل مدينة بيت لحم، وأنه بعد هذه الفترة سيتم إجراء استفتاء عام لتحديد نظام الحكم الذي يرغب أغلبية سكان المدينة بتطبيقه عليهم. إلا أن تطبيق هذا القرار لم يُكتب له أن يتم، فبعد أن أعلنت بريطانيا في عام 1948 إنهاء الانتداب في فلسطين وسحب قواتها، استغلت العصابات اليهودية حالة الفراغ السياسي والعسكري وأعلنت قيام الدولة الإسرائيلية، فثار العرب عمومًا والفلسطينيون خصوصًا وأعلنوا الحرب على إسرائيل، فهوجمت المدينة من قبل الجيش العربي والثوّار الفلسطينيين، وقُتل عدد من الإسرائيليين في هذا الهجوم وتم أسر البعض الآخر. كذلك هاجم القنّاصة العرب القسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nالتقسيم والضم\nكان من نتائج حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب والإسرائيليين أن قُسمت القدس إلى شطرين: الجزء الغربي الخاضع لإسرائيل، والجزء الشرقي الخاضع للأردن. وفي شهر نوفمبر من نفس السنة، أقيمت منطقة عازلة بين الجزئين، حيث قابل قائد القوّات الإسرائيلية في القدس، موشيه دايان، نظيره الأردني عبد الله التل في إحدى منازل حيّ مصرارة بالقدس، وقاما بتعليم الحدود الفاصلة بين شطريّ المدينة، حيث لوّنت حصة إسرائيل باللون الأحمر وحصة الأردن باللون الأخضر. نجم هذا اللقاء عن رسم خريطة لحدود غير رسميّة بين الطرفين المتحاربين، لكنها أخذت بعين الاعتبار عند توقيع اتفاقية الهدنة بين إسرائيل ولبنان ومصر والأردن وسوريا سنة 1949، والتي اتفقت فيها تلك الدول على وقف إطلاق النار والتزام الإسرائيليين بالبقاء ضمن هذه الحدود لحين إيجاد حل سلمي للنزاع. كذلك نصّت هذه الاتفاقية على تقسيم القدس على أن يبقى جبل المشارف في يد إسرائيل على الرغم من أنه يقع في القسم الشرقي، بوصفه جيب داخلي. بناءً على هذا، أقيمت الحواجز الاسمنتيّة والأسلاك الشائكة في وسط المدينة ومرّت بالقرب من باب الخليل في الجانب الغربي من البلدة القديمة، وأُنشأت نقطة عبور شمال الأخيرة عُرفت بمعبر ماندلباوم. استمرت بعض المناوشات العسكرية بين الأردن وإسرائيل بين الحين والآخر على الرغم من اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار، إلا أنها لم تكن ذات أهمية تُذكر غالبًا. كان داود بن گوريون، رئيس وزراء إسرائيل، قد أعلن في 3 ديسمبر 1948 أن القدس الغربية عاصمة للدولة الإسرائيلية الوليدة، وفي سنة 1950 أعلن الأردن رسميًا خضوع القدس الشرقية للسيادة الأردنية، وقد اعترفت المملكة المتحدة وباكستان بهذا الضم، فيما لم تعترف دول أخرى بهذا الأمر بحجة أن القدس الشرقية خضعت للأردن بحكم الأمر الواقع وليس بشكل رسمي، ويشكك البعض إن كانت باكستان قد اعترفت بضم الأردن للقدس الشرقية حتى.\nخضعت أغلبية المواقع المقدسة في القدس للسيادة الأردنية، بما أن أغلبها يقع في القسم الشرقي من المدينة، فأجرت الحكومة الأردنية عدد من الإصلاحات والترميمات لقبة الصخرة والمسجد الأقصى، وسمحت للمسيحيين الأجانب بزيارة المقدسات المسيحية شرط خضوعهم للرقابة، أما اليهود فلم يُسمح لهم بدخول المدينة لاعتبارات سياسية، حيث كانت الحكومة تخشى أن يعمل بعضهم في الجاسوسية لصالح إسرائيل.\n\nخاض العرب وإسرائيل حربًا أخرى في سنة 1967 انتصرت فيها الأخيرة، وقامت بالسيطرة على القدس الشرقية، وكان من نتيجة ذلك أن عاد اليهود ليدخلوا دون أي قيود إلى أماكنهم المقدسة، كذلك أزيلت القيود المفروضة على المسيحيين الغربيين، أما المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة فاستمرا خاضعين للأوقاف الإسلامية. قام الإسرائيليون بهدم حارة المغاربة بعد دخولهم المدينة، بما أنها كانت تواجه حائط البراق الذي يتعبّد اليهود عنده، ولكي يجعلوا من الموقع ساحة لرفع الصلاة اليهودية. قامت إسرائيل بتوسيع حدود المدينة بعد انتهاء الحرب وذلك عبر بناء عدد من الأحياء السكنية والمستعمرات اليهودية شرق الخط الأخضر، وقد أقدمت إسرائيل منذ سنة 1967 بمحاولات عديدة تهدف إلى تهويد المناطق التي احتلتها بعد الحرب، وذلك عبر وسائل عديدة، منها التركيز الإعلامي على أهمية المواقع الأثرية العبرانية في المدينة.\nقوبل ضم إسرائيل للقدس الشرقية بالاستنكار الدولي، وبعد أن أصدرت إسرائيل قانون أساس اعتبرت فيه القدس الموحدة عاصمة أبدية للبلاد، أصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 الذي نص على أن إسرائيل خرقت قانونًا دوليًا وطالب جميع الدول الأعضاء بسحب ما تبقى من سفاراتها من القدس. ما زالت مسألة القدس تُشكل قضية محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي، خصوصًا مع إقرار الحكومة الإسرائيلية بناء وحدات استيطانية جديدة على الدوام في حارات وأحياء في البلدة القديمة يسكنها مسلمون وتحوي مقدسات إسلامية، في سبيل رفع عدد اليهود في القدس الشرقية، إلا أن علماء الدين المسلمون وعدد من المؤرخين العرب يزعمون أن اليهود ليس لهم أي حق في المدينة لأسباب متنوعة، منها أن حائط البراق الذي بُني منذ حوالي 2,500 سنة كان جزءًا من مسجد سليمان الذي تسميه اليهود هيكل سليمان. طالب الفلسطينيون وما زالوا بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة للدولة الفلسطينية المستقبلية، لذا لطالما كانت حدود المدينة موضع نقاش وجدال في المحادثات الثنائية بين السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل. أقام بعض الأشخاص من الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين الراغبين بالسلام نصبًا تذكاريًا مصنوع من الأسلحة القديمة البالية، يواجه سور القدس القديم ونقشوا عليه عبارات بالعربية والعبرية مقتبسة من سفر أشعياء.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينة القدس في وسط فلسطين تقريبًا شرق البحر المتوسط، على رعن هضبة من هضاب جبال الخليل، التي تضم عددًا من الجبال بدورها، وهي: جبل الزيتون أو جبل الطور شرق المدينة، جبل المشارف ويقع إلى الشمال الغربي للمدينة، ويُقال له أيضًا «جبل المشهد»، وقد أقيمت فوقه في سنة 1925 الجامعة العبرية، ومستشفى هداسا الجامعي في سنة 1939، جبل صهيون ويقع إلى الجنوب الغربي وتكوّن البلدة القديمة جزءًا كبيرًا منه وتمر أسوارها من فوقه، جبل المكبر الذي سُمي بهذا الاسم عندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس وكبّر على متنه، بالإضافة إلى جبل النبي صموئيل، وجبل أبو غنيم. ترتفع القدس عن سطح البحر المتوسط نحو 750 مترًا (2,460 قدمًا)، وعن سطح البحر الميت نحو 1150 مترًا (3,770 قدمًا). بالإضافة إلى جبال القدس فإن هناك ثلاثة أودية تحيط بها وهي: وادي سلوان أو وادي جهنم واسمه القديم «وادي قدرون»، الوادي أو الواد، وادي الجوز، ونبع أم الدرج.\nكانت القدس محاطة بغابات من أشجار الجوز الزيتون الصنوبر منذ القدم، إلا أن الحروب والاستغلال البشري كان لها وقعٌ مدمّر عليها، فاختفت معظم هذه الغابات، وقد أثّر ذلك على تماسك التربة، فاضطر المزارعون إلى تشييد المدرّجات الزراعية على عدد من السفوح لمنع تآكلها وانجراف تربتها. شكّل شح المياه مشكلة للمقدسيين منذ العهود الأولى لاستيطان المدينة، فقاموا بتشييد عدد من القناطر والقنوات لجرّ مياه الأنهار، إضافة لعدد من البرك والآبار لجمع ماء الأمطار، وما زال البعض منها موجودًا بالبلدة القديمة. ومن أبرز آبار المدينة بئر أيوب، نسبة إلى النبي أيوب، وهذه البئر هي التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن بسورة ص، حيث جاء: ﴿ارْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ﴾، كذلك من أبرز بركها أو عيونها، العين المعروفة بعين سلوان، وهي إحدى العيون الجارية التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن أيضًا في سورة الرحمن: ﴿فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ﴾. قال مجير الدين الحنبلي عن القدس في نهاية القرن التاسع سنة 900 هـ: \n\nتبعد القدس نحو 60 كيلومترًا (37 ميلاً) عن البحر المتوسط، وحوالي 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) عن البحر الميت، و250 كيلومتر (155 ميلاً) عن البحر الأحمر، وتبعد عن عمّان 88 كيلومتر (55 ميلاً)، وعن بيروت 388 كيلومتر (241 ميلاً)، وعن دمشق 290 كيلومتر (180 ميلاً). أما المدن والبلدات المجاورة للقدس فتشمل: بيت لحم وبيت جالا جنوبًا، أبو ديس ومستوطنة معاليه أدوميم شرقًا، مڤاسرت صهيون غربًا، ورام الله ومستوطنة گفعات زئيف شمالاً.\n\nمناطق القدس\nتمتد أراضي بلدية القدس اليوم لتشمل مناطق شاسعة كانت في السابق قرى أو ضواحي للمدينة، فتشمل حدود البلدية كل من: بيت حنينا، كفر عقب، شعفاط، التل الفرنسي، جبل المشارف، الشيخ جراح، وادي الجوز، جبل الزيتون، البلدة القديمة، سلوان، العيسوية، رأس العمود، أبو الطور، جبل المكبر، صور باهر، أم طوبا، جبل أبو غنيم، بيت صفافا والولجة، قائمة المدن والقرى في فلسطين التاريخية.\nمن جهة أخرى، أقامت إسرائيل العديد من المستوطنات، كما قامت بضم مستوطنات قديمة أخرى خارج حدود البلدية بعد احتلالها للقدس الشرقية عام 1967 وبنائها لجدار الفصل عام 2002، والذي عزل العديد من البلدات العربية عن القدس، كالعيزرية، أبو ديس، الرام، حزما، عناتا، السواحرة الشرقية، بيت إكسا، الشيخ سعد وقلنديا - حيث مطار القدس الدولي، والتي من المفترض أن تشكل الامتداد الطبيعي لتوسع الأحياء العربية في المدينة مستقبلاً. وهذه المستوطنات هي: مستوطنة عطروت، مستوطنة نيڤيه يعقوب، مستوطنة بيسغات زئيف، مستوطنة رامات أشكول، مستوطنة غيلو، مستوطنة هماطوس ومستوطنة ناليبوت مزراح.\nالقدس الغربية\nأقدمت إسرائيل بعد قيامها عام 1948، على تدمير معظم القرى الواقعة غرب القدس، من أهمها: المالحة، دير ياسين، عين كارم، لفتا، والقسطل. وأقامت مكانها العديد من المستوطنات التي أصبحت تشكل فيما بعد مناطق القدس الغربية، وهي: گفعات شاؤول، بيت هيكرم، جبل هرتزل، كريات هيوفيل، عميق زيفائيم، يمين موشيه، ربحاميا، نحلاؤوت، محانيه يهودا، مئة سيعاريم، روميما وگفعات رام.\n\nالحياة البرية والغابات\nيقع في محيط القدس عدة غابات ومناطق برية مثل وادي الغزال، تقع هذه المنطقة بوسط القدس بالقرب من حي «گفعات مردخاي» اليهودي،\nوهي أرض مكشوفة تبلغ مساحتها 260 دونمًا. أُطلق هذا الاسم على الوادي كون ما يُقارب من 17 غزالاً جبليًا تتخذ منه موطنًا ولا تستطيع مغادرته لإحاطة المدينة به من مختلف الجوانب. كان متعهدو العقارات والمقاولون قد خططوا لتحويل المنطقة إلى منطقة سكنية، لكن محبي الطبيعة وجمعية حماية البيئة في إسرائيل استطاعت إيقاف هذا الأمر، وإرغام السلطات المختصة على النظر في مسألة حماية الموقع.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز القدس بمناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط (تصنيف كوبن للمناخ: Csa)، مع صيف حار جاف، وشتاء مُعتدل البرودة رطب. تتساقط الثلوج عادةً مرة أو مرتين خلال الشتاء، على الرغم من أن المدينة تختبر تساقطًا كثيفًا للثلوج مرة كل ثلاث إلى أربع سنوات، في المتوسط، مع تراكم قصير العمر.\nيُعتبر يناير أبرد شهور السنة، بمتوسط درجة حرارة 9.1 درجة °مئوية (48.4 درجة °فهرنهايت)؛ يُعد شهري يوليو وأغسطس الأكثر سخونة، حيث يبلغ متوسط درجة الحرارة 24.2 درجة °مئوية (75.6 درجة °فهرنهايت)، وعادة ما تكون أشهر الصيف جافة. يبلغ متوسط هطول الأمطار السنوي حوالي 537 مليمترًا (21 إنشًا)، وذلك في الفترة الممتدة بين شهريّ أكتوبر ومايو، أما الأشهر الأخرى فينعدم فيها تساقط الأمطار غالبًا. تساقط الثلوج ليس شائعًا، لكن تساقط الثلوج بغزارة يعتبر نادرًا. تلقت القدس أكثر من 30 سم (12 بوصة) من الثلج في 13 ديسمبر 2013، والتي شلت المدينة تقريبًا. مع متوسط درجات حرارة في الصيف مماثلة للسواحل، فإن التأثير البحري من البحر الأبيض المتوسط قوي، لا سيما بالنظر إلى أن القدس تقع على خط عرض مشابه للصحاري الحارة غير البعيدة إلى الشرق.\nكانت أعلى درجة حرارة مُسجلة في القدس 44.4 درجة °مئوية (111.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 28 و30 أغسطس 1881، وكانت أدنى درجة حرارة مُسجلة −6.7 درجة °مئوية (19.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 25 يناير 1907.\nيأتي معظم تلوث الهواء في القدس من حركة مرور السيارات. لم يتم بناء العديد من الشوارع الرئيسية في القدس لاستيعاب هذا الحجم الكبير من حركة المرور، مما أدى إلى ازدحام حركة المرور والمزيد من انبعاثات أول أكسيد الكربون في الهواء. تُساهم انبعاثات المصانع بنسبة ضئيلة من تلوّث الهواء بالمدينة، إلا أنه يمكن لتلك الصادرة عن المصانع الواقعة على ساحل البحر المتوسط أن تتجه شرقًا ناحية القدس وتُشكل ضبخانًا فوقها.\n\nالقرى\nقرى القدس عديدة وكثيرة فقد اختلف التحاق بعض القرى لمدينة القدس وفقًا للتغيرات التاريخية التي مرت بها المدينة. كان آخر تغيير لحدود مدينة القدس الإدارية في يونيو سنة 1967 بموجب قرار أصدرته الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد احتلال الضفة الغربية من الأردن. نص هذا القرار على ضم 70,4 كيلومترات مربعة إلى منطقة البلدية المقدسية الإسرائيلية وفرض القانون الإسرائيلي عليها. كانت 6,4 كيلومترات مربعة من المساحة المضمومة تابعة للبلدية المقدسية الأردنية قبل حرب سنة 1967، أما الباقي فكان من أراضي بعض القرى المجاورة للقدس. أقدم الإسرائيليون على هدم عدد من القرى الفلسطينية وبناء قرىً ومستوطنات جديدة على أنقاضها، وقد سمحت الحكومة في وقت لاحق لبعض المهجرين من الفلسطينيين بالعودة إلى قراهم، فأقاموا بجانب المستوطنات قرىً جديدة. حاز سكان المنطقة المضمومة على مكانة «مقيم دائم» في إسرائيل، دون أن يحصلوا على المواطنة، أما القرى التي بقيت خارج حدود القدس الإدارية وسكانها، فيخضعون لسيطرة الحكم العسكري أو لسيطرة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. وكانت الحكومة الإسرائيلية قد أصدرت قانون أملاك الغائب عام 1950، الذي منح إسرائيل صفة الوصي على على أملاك الفلسطينيين الغائبين، وأعطاها الحق في الاستيلاء عليها وإدارتها. من القرى العربية التي كانت بجوار القدس من جانبها الغربي قبل حرب سنة 1948 لم تبق إلا ثلاثًا: أبو غوش (أكبرها)، عين رافة، وعين نقوبا. تعتبر هذه القرى الثلاثة اليوم تجمعات عربية إسرائيلية وسكانها ذوي جنسية إسرائيلية. ومن قرى القدس الأخرى: إشوع، البريج، بيت أم الميس، بيت عطاب، بيت محسير، جرش، خربة العمور، خربة اللوز، دير الشيخ، وغيرها.\n\nالتركيبة السكانيّة\nأشارت الإحصاءات الإسرائيلية الرسمية الصادرة نهاية عام 2000 إلى أنّ تعداد السكان في المدينة ارتفع بنسبة 2% من إجمالي السكان البالغ 646,3 ألف نسمة، بينهم 436,7 ألف يهودي بنسبة 67,6%، في حين بلغ عدد السكان العرب 209,5 آلاف عربي بنسبة 32.4%. وقد تبيّن في إحصائية أخرى من نفس السنة أن نسبة السكان من اليهود تتراجع تدريجيًا بينما نسبة العرب في ازدياد مطّرد، ويرجع ذلك إلى نسبة الولادات الأعلى عند العرب وإلى هجرة البعض من اليهود إلى مدن وبلدان أخرى. كذلك أفادت نفس الدراسة أن حوالي 9% من جمهرة البلدة القديمة البالغة 32,488 نسمة كانوا يهودًا. بلغت نسبة الكثافة السكانيّة بالمدينة في نهاية عام 2005 حوالي 5,750.4 نسمة في الكيلومتر المربّع (14,893.5 نسمة/ميل مربّع)، وفي نهاية سنة 2006 أظهرت إحصائية أعدّتها مؤسسة إسرائيلية للدراسات حول مدينة القدس إن عدد سكان القدس بلغ 733 ألف شخص بينهم 481 ألف يهودي و252 ألف فلسطيني يعيشون خصوصًا في الأحياء الشرقية من المدينة. وفي شهر ديسمبر من سنة 2007، وصل عدد سكان القدس إلى 747,600 نسمة، 64% منهم يهود و32% مسلمين و2% مسيحيين.\n\nيخوض الفلسطينيون والإسرائيليون حربًا ديمغرافيّة في القدس، حيث يسعى كل طرف إلى زيادة عدد السكان المنتمين إلى عرقيته ليضمن هيمنته على المدينة، وتعمل الحكومة الإسرائيلية - كما تقول الدكتورة سارة هيرشكوبيتس رئيسة قسم التخطيط الإستراتيجي في بلدية القدس - على ألا تتعدى نسبة العرب بالمدينة 28%. وتحاول الحكومة الإسرائيلية زيادة عدد اليهود في المدينة بطرق عدة، منها على سبيل المثال العمل على إحلال اليهود محلّ العرب الذين هدّمت منازلهم بحجّة البناء دون تصريح. وتشير إحصائيات بيت الشرق لعام 1999 في هذا الصدد إلى هدم أكثر من ألفيْ منزل منذ عام 1967، مما خلق ظروفاً صعبة للفلسطينيين حيث يسكن معظمهم في منازل مكتظة. ومن الوسائل الأخرى التي تتّخذها إسرائيل لإجبار المقدسيّين على الهجرة من القدس، عدم منحهم تصاريح بناء إلا فيما ندر، وتسهيل بناء المنازل لليهود المهاجرين. وفي سنة 2005، قدم المدينة 2,850 مهاجر يهودي جديد من الولايات المتحدة وفرنسا ومن بعض دول الاتحاد السوڤيتي السابق، وبنهاية السنة ذاتها تبيّن أن 16,000 من السكان غادر المدينة، إلا أن جمهرة المدينة ما زالت في ازدياد بفضل ارتفاع نسبة الإنجاب بين الأهالي العرب واليهود الحريدية. يصل معدل الخصوبة الكلي في القدس إلى 4.02، وهو أعلى من ذاك الخاص بتل أبيب (1.98) والمعدل الوطني حتى، الذي يصل إلى 2.90.\n\nبلغت الزيادة الصافية للسكان في سنة 2000، بعد حساب الولادات والوفيات والمهاجرين من وإلى المدينة، 12600 نسمة، كان نصيب اليهود منها 2900 نسمة، في حين بلغت الزيادة العربية 9700. وبهذا كانت نسبة نمو السكان اليهود في القدس هي 0.7% بينما كانت عند السكان العرب 4.7%. وفي سنة 2005 ازداد عدد السكان بحوالي 13,000 نسمة، أي قرابة 1.8%، وهي نسبة مشابهة لنسبة معدّل النمو السكاني في إسرائيل في ذلك العام، إلا أن ما يميزها هو التباين في التركيبة السكانيّة والعرقيّة، فقرابة 31% من الجمهرة اليهودية تألفت من أولاد دون سن الخامسة عشر، بالمقابل فإن هذه النسبة وصلت لحوالي 42% عند السكان العرب، ويتوافق ذلك مع الدراسات التي أظهرت تراجع عدد اليهود في القدس خلال العقود الأربع الماضية، واتجاه معظمهم إلى المدن الساحلية والضواحي.\nعادت نسبة اليهود الحريدية في المدينة إلى الارتفاع بحلول عام 2009، حيث تبيّن في إحدى الإحصائيات أن 59,900 تلميذ من أصل 150,100، أو 40% منهم، يطلبون العلم في المدارس الرسميّة العلمانيّة والدينيّة على حد سواء، بينما 90,200 تلميذ أو 60% من المجموع الأصلي، يتلقون دراستهم في مدارس حريدية خاصة.\nيرى العديد من الإسرائيليين أن القدس مدينة فقيرة تمزقها النزاعات السياسية والدينية، لذا فهم يفضلون سكن مدن أخرى أكثر أمانًا وغنى، وبالمقابل تستقطب المدينة عددًا كبيرًا من الفلسطينيين من سكّان الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، كونها تقدم لهم فرص عمل وخدمات صحية أكبر من تلك المتاحة في مدنهم وقراهم. شجّع الزعماء الفلسطينيون والعرب السكان الفلسطينيين عبر السنين على البقاء في المدينة لتأكيد حقهم بالمطالبة بها، وقد فعل البعض منهم هذا.\n\nمخيم شعفاط\nتأسس مخيم شعفاط للاجئين في عام 1965، أي بعد أكثر من عقد واحد على تأسيس كافة المخيمات الرسمية الأخرى في الضفة الغربية، وذلك فوق أرض مساحتها 0,2 كيلومتر مربع شمال القدس. وقد تأسس مخيم شعفاط بعد أن تم إغلاق مخيم المعسكر في المدينة القديمة للقدس بسبب سوء الظروف الصحية فيه.\nوتعود أصول اللاجئين في مخيم المعسكر والذين رُحلوا إلى شعفاط إلى 55 قرية تابعة لمناطق القدس واللد ويافا والرملة. ومثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسس المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من الحكومة الأردنية.\nويُعد مخيم شعفاط المخيم الوحيد في الضفة الغربية الذي يقع ضمن الحدود البلدية للقدس. ولذلك، فإن اللاجئين فيه يحق لهم الحصول على هويات مدنية تابعة للقدس، الأمر الذي يضمن لهم حقوق الإقامة في القدس ويجعلهم مؤهلين للحصول على بعض الخدمات الاجتماعية الإسرائيلية، بما في ذلك الرعاية الصحية.\nوفي الوقت الذي تبين سجلات الأونروا الرسمية أن عدد اللاجئين المسجلين في المخيم يصل إلى حوالي 11,000 لاجئ، إلا أنه من المرجح أن يبلغ عدد اللاجئين فيه أكثر من 18,000. ويُقدر أن حوالي 4,000 لاجئ قد انتقلوا إلى المخيم في السنوات الأخيرة لتجنب فقدان حقوق الإقامة في القدس. ويعمل حوالي 70% من سكان المخيم في القطاع الخاص الإسرائيلي.\n\nتهويد القدس\nتتّبع إسرائيل سياسة دمج المستوطنات لاستيعاب أكبر عدد ممكن من اليهود داخل القدس، فعلى سبيل المثال دمجت الحكومة الإسرائيلية مستوطنة گفعات زئيف ومعاليه أدوميم ومناطق الخط الأخضر لاحتواء حوالي 30 ألف مستوطن جديد داخل المدينة. كما بنت 142 ألف شقة في القطاع اليهودي لزيادة حجم السكان فيها. تفيد إحدى تقارير البنك الدولي أن عدد مخالفات البناء في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1996 و2000، كان أكبر بأربع مرّات ونصف في الأحياء اليهودية، وأن عمليات الهدم في القدس الغربية كانت أقل بأربع مرّات من تلك الحاصلة في القدس الشرقية؛ كذلك أفاد التقرير أن السلطات الإسرائيلية كانت تمنح الفلسطينيين أذونًا بالبناء أقل بكثير من الأذون التي تمنحها لليهود، وأن المخالفين الفلسطينيين تُزال مخالفاتهم بنسبة أكبر من مخالفات اليهود. حصلت بعض المؤسسات اليهودية على إذن من الحكومة الإسرائيلية خلال السنوات القليلة الماضية، يسمح لها بتشييد المباني والمعالم على الأراضي المتنازع عليها، من شاكلة «حديقة الملك سليمان» المخطط إنشاؤها في قرية سلوان بمدينة داود، والتي يُشكل العرب حوالي 60% من سكانها، وفي مقبرة «مأمن الله». أطلق معارضو هذه الخطوات المُتخذة من قبل الحكومة الإسرائيلية مصطلح «تهويد القدس» على هذه الإجراءات، كونها تصب في مصلحة اليهود دون الفلسطينيين.\n\nالقدس الرسمية\nالبلديّة\nتأسس المجلس البلدي لمدينة القدس في سنة 1863 أبّان الحكم العثماني، وقد انقسم هذا المجلس إلى مجلسين عند تقسيم المدينة. تولت أمانة القدس الاهتمام بالقدس العربية بين نكبة فلسطين واحتلال القدس في حرب 1967.\nيتألّف مجلس بلديّة القدس الإسرائيلي اليوم من 31 عضوًا منتخبًا على رأسهم رئيس البلديّة، الذي يُنتخب لخمس سنوات، ويتمتع بحق تعيين ستة مفوضين بلديين لينوبوا عنه، وهؤلاء إلى جانب رئيس البلدية يتلقون رواتبهم كاملة من الحكومة الإسرائيلية، أما باقي الأعضاء فيُعتبر عملهم تطوعيًا. يعقد مجلس بلدية القدس معظم اجتماعاته بصفة سريّة، عدا جلسة واحدة في كل شهر تكون علنيّة. تُشكل الأحزاب الدينية عصبة قويّة داخل مجلس البلدية، حيث تسيطر غالبًا على معظم المقاعد. يقع دار بلدية القدس ومكتب رئيسها في ساحة الصفراء في شارع يافا. يتكوّن مجمّع البلدية، الذي افتتح في سنة 1993، من مبنيين حديثيّ البناء إلى جانب عشرة مبان قديمة مجددة، تحيط بساحة عامّة واسعة. تتبع المدينة محافظة القدس وتُشكّل عاصمتها. إضافة إلى ذلك، تقوم مؤسسة الأقصى لإعمار المقدسات بصيانة وترميم ورعاية المؤسسات والمباني الإسلامية في القدس.\nقامت بلدية القدس الغربية في سنة 1949 بإجراء مسابقة لتصميم علم للشطر الغربي من المدينة، ففاز تصميم تضمن رسمًا لخطين عريضين باللون الأزرق يرمزان إلى شال الصلاة اليهودية، على خلفية بيضاء يقع في وسطهما شعار المدينة. وجعلت إسرائيل التصميم الإسرائيلي شعارًا للمدينة بشطريها بعد حرب سنة 1967 عندما ضمت القدس الشرقية، على الرغم من أن السكان العرب والمجتمع الدولي لم يتعرف بذلك، لكن العلم والشعار بقيا بحكم الأمر الواقع. صُمم شعار القدس ما بين سنتيّ 1950 و1951، وهو يُظهر أسدًا جامحًا يُرمز به إلى أسد يهودا، شعار القبيلة اليهودية القديمة، محاطًا بأغصنة زيتون، وفي الخلفية رُسم حائط البراق. أما السلطة الفلسطينية فلم تنشئ شعار ولا علم للمدينة.\n\nرؤساء البلدية\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية القدس عدد من أعيان المدينة، كان أولهم «موسى العلمي». تولّى اليهود رئاسة البلدية لأوّل مرة في سنة 1937، وذلك عندما فاز «دانيال أستر» برئاسة البلدية بدعم من حكومة الانتداب البريطانية. وعندما انقسمت القدس إلى شطرين، أصبحت هناك بلديتين: بلدية القدس الشرقية ورئيسها عربي، وبلدية القدس الغربية ويرأسها إسرائيلي. أما أوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الشرقية فهو «أنور الخطيب»، وأوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الغربية هو الحاكم العسكري «دوڤ يوسف». وعندما ضمّت إسرائيل القدس الشرقية بعد حرب حزيران سنة 1967، أسست بلدية «أورشليم القدس» وتولّى رئاستها «ثيودور كولك». يشغل نير بركات منصب رئيس بلدية أورشليم القدس حاليًا، ويرأس زكي الغول أمانة القدس الشرقية، بما أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وأغلب دول العالم لا تعتبر ضم الأخيرة قانونياً.\n\nالوضع السياسي\nبعد أن أصدرت هيئة الأمم المتحدة قرارها القاضي بتقسيم فلسطين في سنة 1947، نصّت على وجوب تدويل القدس تحت إشرافها ورقابتها، وقد سارع القادة اليهود إلى قبول هذا الأمر نظرًا لأنه يحقق مطامحهم في إقامة دولة لهم، بينما عارضه الزعماء العرب ورفضوا أي تقسيم يُخطط إجراؤه في فلسطين. انقسمت المدينة إلى شطرين بعد حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب وإسرائيل، واحتلت الأخيرة القسم الغربي، فيما سيطر الأردن على القسم الشرقي. اعتبرت معظم الدول، وما زالت، أن وضع القدس ينبغي أن يُحدد كما ورد في قرار التقسيم، لذا فإن أغلبها لا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل.\nبعد أن أعلن دافيد بن غوريون، أوّل رئيس وزراء لإسرائيل، أن القدس الغربية عاصمة البلاد، اتخذت جميع الهيئات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، من قضائية وتشريعية وتنفيذية، من المدينة مقرًا لها، عدا وزارة الدفاع، التي لا تزال تتخذ من منطقة كرياة بوسط تل أبيب مركزًا لها. سيطرت إسرائيل على المدينة بشطريها مباشرةً بعد حرب سنة 1967، وجعلت منها جزءًا من العاصمة بحكم الأمر الواقع، على الرغم من معارضة المجتمع الدولي لهذا الأمر. لا تزال هويّة القدس كعاصمة «أبديّة» لإسرائيل تُشكّل موضع جدل كبير في المجتمع الدولي، فعلى الرغم من أن بعض الدول فتحت قنصليات لها في المدينة، فإن جميع السفارات موجودة خارجها، ومعظمها في تل أبيب. وبسبب عدم الاعتراف بالقدس كعاصمة لإسرائيل، فإن معظم الصحف العالمية والمحلية تصف إعلانات الحكومة الإسرائيلية بأنها «صادرة عن تل أبيب».\nأصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 بتاريخ 20 أغسطس سنة 1980، الذي نصّ على أن قانون الأساس الذي أصدرته إسرائيل واعتبرت فيه القدس عاصمة أبدية لها، قانونًا «فاسدًا باطلاً وينبغي إلغاؤه فورًا»، واقتُرح أن تقوم الدول الأعضاء في هذا المجلس بسحب كل هيئاتها الدبلوماسية من المدينة حتى تذعن إسرائيل للقرار الدولي، وقد استجابت معظم الدول ذات السفارات المتبقية في القدس لهذا الأمر، وقامت بنقل مراكز سفاراتها إلى تل أبيب، كما فعلت غيرها من الدول قبيل صدور القرار رقم 478، وكنتيجة لهذا الأمر، فرغت القدس من السفارات الأجنبية، لكن بعضًا منها اتخذ من إحدى ضواحيها، وهي «مڤاسرت صهيون»، مقرًا لها، كذلك استمرت 4 قنصليات موجودة بالمدينة. قرر الكونغرس الأمريكي نقل مقر السفارة الأمريكية من تل أبيب إلى القدس في سنة 1995، وذلك بعد إصدار «قانون السفارة في القدس» (بالإنگليزية: Jerusalem Embassy Act)، إلا أن بيل كلنتون، رئيس الولايات المتحدة آنذاك، استمر بتأجيل التوقيع على هذا القرار إلى أن انتهت ولايته، وعندها قال الرئيس الذي خلفه، وهو جورج بوش الابن، قال بأن قرارات الكونغرس المتعلقة بوضع القدس ليست إلزامية والهدف منها إبداء النصح والمشورة فقط، فلم يُقدم على توقيع القرار واستمرت السفارة الأمريكية موجودة في تل أبيب. قال أمين عام الأمم المتحدة، بان كي مون، في 28 أكتوبر سنة 2009، بأن القدس يجب أن تكون عاصمةً لكل من فلسطين وإسرائيل كي يتحقق السلام العادل والشامل.\n\nتقع في القدس أبرز المؤسسات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، بما فيها البرلمان أو الكنيست، والمحكمة العليا، والمقر الرسمي لرئيس الجمهورية ورئيس الوزراء. وقبيل إعلان قيام «دولة» إسرائيل، كانت القدس عاصمةً إدارية للأراضي الشاميّة الخاضعة للانتداب البريطاني، أي تلك التي تشمل اليوم أراضي السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل والأردن. كانت القدس الغربية عاصمةً لإسرائيل من سنة 1949 حتى سنة 1967، إلا أن دول العالم لم تعترف بهذا الأمر بما أن قرار الأمم المتحدة رقم 194 كان قد نصّ على تدويل المدينة. بعد أن خضعت المدينة بشطريها لإسرائيل بعد حرب سنة 1967، أعلنت حكومة ليڤي أشكول تطبيق القانون الإسرائيلي على القدس الشرقية وامتداد نطاق اختصاص القضاء الإسرائيلي إليها، لكنها وافقت على خضوع منطقة المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة لوزارة الأوقاف الأردنية. أمرت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقفال بيت الشرق، وهو مقرّ منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، في سنة 1988 لأسباب أمنيّة، وفي سنة 1992 أعيد افتتاح البيت بصفته مضافة. نصّت اتفاقية أوسلو على أن الوضع النهائي للقدس يجب أن يتحدد عن طريق مفاوضات مع السلطة الفلسطينية، التي تعتبر القدس الشرقية عاصمة لدولة فلسطينية مستقبلية، وقد قال الرئيس الفلسطيني محمود عبّاس أن أية مفاوضات لا تتضمن الاعتراف بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة لفلسطين ستكون غير مقبولة. في السادس من ديسمبر 2017 قرر الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب الاعتراف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل ونقل سفارة الولايات المتحدة إلى القدس.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nالقدس مدينة ذات أهمية دينية كبرى عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث: اليهود والمسيحيون والمسلمون. أظهرت إحدى الإحصائيات من سنة 2000 أن القدس تحوي حاليًا 1204 كنسات، 158 كنيسة، و73 مسجدًا، والبعض من دور العبادة هذه يُعتبر من بين أكثر المواقع تقديسًا عند أتباع هذه الديانة أو تلك، إن لم يكن أقدسها في بعض الأحيان، لذا فقد كان انتهاك حُرمة إحدى هذه الدور من بين الأسباب التي أدّت دومًا إلى حصول نزاعات كبيرة في المدينة والمنطقة ككل.\n\nفي الإسلام\nالقدس هي ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وكانت تمثّل قبلة الصلاة الإسلامية طيلة ما يُقارب من سنة، قبل أن تتحول القبلة إلى الكعبة في مكة. وقد أصبحت القدس مدينة ذات أهميّة دينية عند المسلمين بعد أن أسرى الملاك جبريل بالنبي محمد إليها، وفق المعتقد الإسلامي، قرابة سنة 620 حيث عرج من الصخرة المقدسة إلى السماوات العلى حيث قابل جميع الأنبياء والرسل الذين سبقوه وتلقّى من الله تعاليم الصلاة وكيفية أدائها. تنص سورة الإسراء أن محمدًا أُسري به من المسجد الحرام إلى «المسجد الأقصى»: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾؛ وقد أجمع المفسرون على أن المقصود بالمسجد الأقصى مدينة القدس ذاتها، وسُميت الأقصى لبعد المسافة بينها وبين المسجد الحرام، إذ لم يكن حين إذن فيها المسجد الأقصى الحالي. يقع اليوم معلمين إسلاميين في الموقع الذي عرج منه النبي محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم) إلى السماء، وهما قبة الصخرة التي تحوي الصخرة المقدسة، والمسجد الأقصى الذي بُني خلال العهد الأموي. ومما يجعل من القدس مدينة مهمة في الإسلام أيضًا، أن عددًا كبيرًا من الأنبياء والصالحين الذين يتشارك المسلمون وأهل الكتاب عمومًا بالإيمان بهم، مع اختلاف النظرة إليهم، حيث يعتبر المسلمون واليهود أن عدد منهم أنبياء أو رسل بينما ينظر المسيحيون إليهم بصفتهم قديسين، قطنوا المدينة عبر التاريخ أو عبروها، ومنهم داود وسليمان وزكريا ويحيى والمسيح عيسى بن مريم، وكذلك لذكر المدينة في القرآن بأنها وما حولها أراض مباركة شكّلت قبلة للأنبياء ومهبطًا للملائكة والوحي وأن الناس يُحشرون فيها يوم القيامة.\nأما عند الشيعة الإثنا عشرية فالمسجد الأقصى مكانه في السماء الرابعة وليس على الأرض فليس للمسجد الأقصى مكانة ذات أهمية لديهم، عن سلام الحناط، عن رجل، عن أبي عبد الله قال: سألته عن المساجد التي لها الفضل فقال: المسجد الحرام ومسجد الرسول، قلت: والمسجد الأقصى جعلت فداك؟ فقال: ذاك في السماء إليه أسري رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فقلت: إن الناس يقولون: إنه بيت المقدس؟ فقال: مسجد الكوفة أفضل منه.\n\nفي المسيحية\nيجلّ المسيحيون القدس لأسباب مختلفة، منها تاريخها الذي ورد ذكره في العهد القديم، إضافة إلى لعبها دورًا محوريًا في حياة يسوع المسيح. ينص العهد الجديد أن يسوع أُحضر إلى المدينة بعد ولادته بفترة قصيرة، وتذكر التقاليد المسيحية أنه قام لاحقًا بتطهير معبد حيرود من الأصنام الرومانية التي وضعها الملك حيرود داخله، وأنه قلب موائد الصيارفة وكراسي باعة الحمام ولم يدع أحدًا يجتاز الهيكل بمتاع.\nيؤمن البعض أن العليّة حيث تناول المسيح وتلاميذه العشاء الأخير، تقع على جبل صهيون في ذات المبنى حيث يقع ضريح الملك داود. ومن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة في المدينة أيضًا، التلّة المعروفة باسم «جلجثة»، وهي موقع صلب يسوع بحسب الإيمان المسيحي. يصف إنجيل يوحنا هذه التلّة بأنها تقع خارج القدس، إلا أن بعض الحفريات أظهرت مؤخرًا أنها تقع على بُعد مسافة قليلة من البلدة القديمة داخل حدود المدينة الحاليّة. أمّا أقدس الأماكن المسيحية في القدس فهي كنيسة القيامة، التي يحج إليها المسيحيون من مختلف أنحاء العالم منذ حوالي ألفيّ سنة، ويقول بعض الخبراء والمؤرخين أنها أكثر المواقع احتمالاً بأن تكون قد شُيدت على الجلجثة.\n\nفي اليهودية\nأصبحت المدينة مقدسة عند اليهود بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعلها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة في القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد. وكانت القدس تحوي الهيكل الذي بناه سليمان بن داود، الذي يسميه اليهود «هيكل سليمان»، بالإضافة إلى هيكل أو معبد حيرود الذي شُيّد في وقت لاحق بعد أن هُدم الهيكل الأوّل. ورد ذكر هذا الهيكل 632 مرّة في الكتاب المقدس، وما زال اليهود اليوم يتعبدون عند حائط البراق أو حائط المبكى، الذي يؤمنون بأنه كل ما تبقى من المعبد القديم، ويُشكل هذا الحائط ثاني أقدس الأماكن في اليهودية بعد «قدس الأقداس».\nتُبنى جميع الكنس في العالم ومحرابها يواجه القدس، أما محاريب كنس القدس فتواجه «قدس الأقداس». تنص التوراة الشفهية والشريعة اليهودية أن الصلاة يجب أن تتلى في اتجاه القدس وهيكل حيرود، والكثير من الأسر اليهودية تضع لويحة «مزراح» على إحدى جدران منزلها لتحديد قبلة الصلاة. ذُكرت القدس في التناخ 669 مرّة، وذُكر اسم «صهيون» التي يقصد بها اليهود المدينة تارة وفلسطين ككل تارة أخرى، 154 مرّة.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة بحد ذاتها إحدى المعالم التاريخية المقدسية. تبلغ مساحة القدس القديمة، ضمن الأسوار قرابة كيلومترًا مربعًا ويقع المسجد الأقصى في الناحية الشرقية من المدينة وأسوارها. وتقسم المدينة إلى حارات أو خطط، وفي هذه الأحياء أسواق محلية صغيرة استقلت عن الأسواق الرئيسة، وكانت الأحياء تضم مجموعات سكانية منسجمة في بيئتها الاجتماعية والدينية، وطرق المدينة القديمة متعرجة، غُطي بعضها بعقود، وقد تقوم منشآت أو امتدادات عالية للبيوت. ومن أهم هذه المنشآت المساجد والمآذن والمدارس، وإذا استثنيت قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، فإن أكثر المساجد والمآذن في القدس تعود إلى العصر المملوكي، مثل المئذنة الفخرية عام 1278، ومئذنة باب الغوانمة من عام 1329، ومئذنة باب الأسباط عام 1367. ومن المساجد هناك مسجد القلعة الذي بُني عام 1310، والمسجد القيمري عام 1276 وجامع الخانقاة الصلاحية، وتعود مئذنته إلى عام 1395. ومن المساجد التي بنيت في العهد العثماني مسجد النبي داود الذي أنشأه السلطان سليمان القانوني وهو مجمع معماري، ولقد حوّلته إسرائيل إلى كنيس وأزيلت الكتابات القرآنية منه واستبدلت بكتابة عبرية، وجامع المولوية المُشيّد سنة 1587 والمسجد القيمري.\nإن أكثر المباني الإسلامية في القدس هي المدارس التعليمية. حيث أن عدد المدارس والزوايا في القدس خلال القرن الحادي عشر الهجري كان 630 مدرسة، ومن أقدم المدارس المدرسة المنصورية التي أنشأها الملك المنصور قلاوون. وتمتاز عمارة المدارس بالفناء ذي البركة تشرف عليه الأواوين والغرف، أما الواجهة الجميلة التي تدخل منها إلى المدرسة من خلال دركاه، فهي من مميزات العمارة المملوكية، وإذا كانت المدارس المملوكية في القدس لم ترق إلى مستوى المدارس في القاهرة التي تميزت بالاتساع والفخامة كمدرسة السلطان حسن، فإنها مع ذلك تتمتع بالأناقة والبساطة والوحدة، ومن أهم المدارس المملوكية الباقية حتى اليوم: المدرسة السلامية (1300م)، المدرسة الجاولية (1320م)، المدرسة التنكزية (1329م)، المدرسة الأمينية (1330م)، المدرسة الملكية (1340م)، المدرسة الفارسية (1353م)، المدرسة الأرغونية (1356م)، المدرسة القشتمرية (1358م)، المدرسة المحدثية (1360م)، والمدرسة الطشتمرية (1384م). تشمل معالم القدس الحاليّة ما يلي:\n\nالثقافة\nتُعتبر القدس مدينةً تنصهر فيها دينيًا الثقافة في بوتقة واحدة، نظرًا لأهميتها الدينية ولعب الدين دورًا مهمًا في حياة سكانها من العرب والإسرائيليين، كما أن ثقافة سكان منطقة القدس شكلت جزءًا كبيرًا من هويتهم منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الحضر الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن معظم اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميّز في منطقة القدس ووسط الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى، حيث أن لمدينة القدس ثوبها الخاص، الذي يمتاز بأنه أكثر الأثواب الفلسطينية جمعًا لآثار كل العصور التي مرت على المدينة، فعلى الصدر توجد قبة ملكات الكنعانيون وعلى الجوانب تظهر طريقة التصليب منذ أيام الحكم الصليبي، كما ويظهر الهلال والآيات القرآنية كدليل على عودة القدس للحكم الإسلامي العربي. وبشكل عام فإن آثار النكبة تظهر علي الثوب الفلسطيني، إذ يظهر الحزن والحنين من خلال الألوان، من خلال اختفاء الألوان الزاهية مشيرة إلى أن ظهور تطريز الماكينة دليل على عدم اهتمام المرأة بالتطريز وعلى الوضع الاقتصادي السيئ.\nيُعتبر المتحف الإسرائيلي أحد أهم المواقع الثقافية بالمدينة، حيث يستقبل نحو مليون زائر سنويًا، يُشكل السيّاح ثلثهم. تصل مساحة مجمّع المتحف إلى 20 دونم (81,000 م2) وهو يضم عدد من المباني ذات المعارض المختلفة، حيث تُعرض أعمال فنيّة إسرائيلية وأوروبية، إضافة للعديد من المكتشفات الأثرية والمخطوطات اليهودية القديمة. وفي المتحف معلمٌ بارز هو صحن مائي يُعرف بصحن الكتاب، وهو يحوي مخطوطات البحر الميت التي اكتُشفت في أواسط القرن العشرين في كهوف خربة قمران بالقرب من البحر سالف الذكر. خُصصت إحدى أجنحة المتحف لتلقين الأطفال دروس في الرسم النحت، ويزور هذا الجناح قرابة 100,000 طفل في السنة، ولهذا المتحف حديقة خارجية مخصصة لعرض أعمال النحت، ومن أبرز المنحوتات فيها المنحوتة المصغرة لمعبد حيرود. ومن المتاحف الأخرى ذات الأهمية، متحف روكفلر في القدس الشرقية أو «متحف فلسطين للآثار» سابقا، الذي بُني أيام الانتداب البريطاني في سنة 1938، وهو يُعد أوّل متحف للآثار شُيّد في الشرق الأوسط. والذي تتخذه اليوم سلطة الآثار الإسرائيلية مقرا لها.\n\nتأوي القدس النصب التذكاري المعروف باسم نصب «ياد ڤاشيم» (بالعبرية: יד ושם)، المخصص لإحياء ذكرى اليهود الذين قضوا في المحرقة النازية، وهذا النصب مجمّع ذو أجنحة عديدة تُشكل أكبر أرشيف عالميّ لكل ما يتعلق بالمحرقة سالفة الذكر. من أبرز أجنحة المجمّع متحفًا فريدًا يعرض مواضيعًا مختلفة تتعلق بالإبادة الجماعية لليهود ويُركز على الروايات والقصص المتعلقة ببعض الأفراد والعائلات الذين قُتلوا آنذاك، كما يعرض مجموعة فنيّة من أعمال بعض الفنانين الذين قضوا نحبهم في المحرقة. يُحيي هذا النصب أيضًا ذكرى الأطفال اليهود الذين قتلهم النازيون بالإضافة إلى «الشرفاء من بين الأمم»، ويُقصد بهم الأشخاص غير اليهود الذين خاطروا بحياتهم خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية لإنقاذ أطفال اليهود من الإعدام. كذلك هناك جناحٌ يُطلق عليه تسمية «الجناح الموصول»، وهو يعرض أعمال فنيّة تمثل العيش المشترك بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، وهو يقع على الطريق الفاصلة بين القدس الشرقية والغربية.\n\nتتخذ عدّة مراق وفرق فنيّة من القدس مقرًا لها، ومن هذه الأوركسترا السمفونية المقدسيّة التي تأسست في عقد الأربعينات من القرن العشرين، بالإضافة إلى الأوركسترا الإسرائيلية التي تؤدي أعمالها الفنية في مركز المؤتمرات الدولية (بالعبرية: מרכז הקונגרסים הבינלאומי) الذي يقع بالقرب من مدخل القدس الغربيّة، وأيضًا المركز الموسيقي في القدس، الواقع حي «يمين موشيه»، وغيرها. استضافت القدس «المهرجان الإسرائيلي» طيلة 25 عامًا، وهذا المهرجان يُقام سنويًا منذ سنة 1961 وتؤدى فيه عدّة أعمال مسرحية خارجية وداخلية بالإضافة لحفلات موسيقية لمغنين محليين وعالميين. يستضيف مسرح القدس في حارة الطالبية ما يزيد عن 150 حفلاً موسيقيًا في السنة، إلى جانب عروض مسرحية وراقصة لفنانين عالميين. وهناك أيضًا «مسرح خان» الذي يقع في الكاروانسرا مقابل محطة القطارات القديمة، وهو مسرح الذخائر الوحيد بالمدينة. ومن البرامج الثقافية الخاصة بالقدس، مهرجان القدس السينمائي، الذي تُعرض فيه أعمال سينمائية إسرائيلية وعالمية.\n\nتؤوي القدس بعض معارض اللوحات مثل «بيت تيخو»، في وسط المدينة، وهو منزل قديم تحوّل إلى متحف حاليًا، تُعرض فيه لوحات الفنانة «حنّة تيخو» المعروفة برسمها لتلال القدس، والمجموعات العبرانية لزوجها الذي كان يعمل كحالاً، وافتتح أول عيادة لطب العيون في القدس سنة 1912. كذلك هناك معرض الحوش، وهو معرض فني فلسطيني تأسس في سنة 2004 تُعرض فيه عدّة أعمال فنيّة لفنانين فلسطينيين.\n\nأعلنت القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية في سنة 2009. تُشكل المدينة مقرًا للمسرح الوطني الفلسطيني، الذي يعمل على الحفاظ على الثقافة والهويّة العربية والفلسطينية للقدس، بالإضافة لإجراء عدّة نشاطات تهدف إلى إحياء اهتمام الفلسطينيين بالفن. يرعى معهد إدوارد سعيد الوطني للموسيقى الأوركسترا الشبابية الفلسطينية، التي قامت بجولة فنيّة شملت دول الخليج العربي وغيرها من دول الشرق الأوسط في سنة 2009. يقع المتحف الإسلامي في القدس على متن الحرم القدسي الشريف، وقد تأسس هذا المتحف في سنة 1923، وهو يضم كثيرًا من القطع الأثرية الإسلامية، التي تتراوح من أدوات الكحل صغيرة الحجم والمخطوطات النادرة، إلى العواميد الرخامية الضخمة. حظرت إسرائيل احتفالات إعلان القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية بحجة أنها كانت برعاية السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وأقيم احتفال في بلدة بيت عنان عوضًا عن ذلك، وعلى مدى 4 أيام، وحضره ما يزيد عن 15,000 شخص.\nهناك عدد من المؤسسات والمنظمات اللاربحيّة في القدس، التي تسعى للتقريب بين السكان من العرب والإسرائيليين، ومن شاكلة هذه المنظمات: «الصندوق الإبراهيمي» و«مركز التبادل الثقافي المقدسي»، الذان يُشجعان على القيام بمشاريع ثقافية مشتركة بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، كذلك «مركز القدس للموسيقى والرقص الشرقي» الذي يُخصص حلقات عمل للإسرائيليين والعرب على حد سواء، ويهدف إلى تعزيز لغة الحوار والتواصل بين الطرفين عن طريق تشجيعهم على القيام بأعمال فنيّة مشتركة، أيضًا هناك الأوركسترا اليهودية العربية الشبابيّة، التي تؤدي عروض موسيقية تقليدية أوروبية وشرق أوسطيّة. قام الفنان البولندي «تشيسلاو دزاڤيگاي» بصنع منحوتة تمثّل التعايش السلمي الذي يُطمح إليه بين الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين، وأطلق عليه «نصب التسامح» ونُصب في سنة 2008 على تلة فاصلة بين مستوطنة تلبيوت الشرقية وجبل المكبر، كعلامة على نضال المقدسيين في سبيل الحصول على السلام.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكان الحج إلى القدس يُشكل أبرز مواردها المالية عبر التاريخ، بما أنها مدينة داخلية تقع بعيدًا عن المرافئ الهامّة مثل يافا وغزة. لا تزال المعالم الدينية في القدس هي ما يستقطب الزوّار الأجانب بشكل رئيسي، حيث أن معظمهم يأتي ليزور حائط البراق وكنيسة القيامة والمسجد الأقصى، وغيرها من الأماكن في البلدة القديمة، إلا أنه أصبح من الجليّ خلال نصف القرن الفائت أن المدينة لا يمكنها أن تعتمد على هذه الزيارات وحدها لتؤمن مدخولاً كافيًا يفي بجميع الحاجات الحياتية للسكان.\nتُظهر عدّة إحصائيات أن اقتصاد المدينة في نمو مطّرد، إلا أنه من الملاحظ بأن القدس الشرقية لا تزال أقل نموًا من الغربية، لكن على الرغم من ذلك فإن نسبة الأسر العربية التي يعمل عدد من أفرادها أعلى من تلك الخاصة بالأسر اليهودية، حيث تصل الأولى إلى 76.1% والثانية إلى 66.8%. يصل معدّل البطالة في القدس إلى 8.3%، وهو بهذا أقل من المعدّل الوطني الإسرائيلي الذي يصل إلى 9.0%، على الرغم من أن نسبة القوّة العاملة بالمدينة أقل من تلك الخاصة بمدن أخرى مثل تل أبيب (58.0%) وحيفا (52.4%). أظهرت دراسات أخرى أن نسبة الفقر بالقدس ارتفعت بشكل ملحوظ خلال الفترة الممتدة من سنة 2001 حتى سنة 2007، حيث ازدادت نسبة السكان الذين يعيشون تحت خط الفقر بحوالي 40%. وصل معدّل المدخول الشهري للعامل في القدس خلال سنة 2006 إلى 5,940 شيكل جديد (1,410 دولار أمريكي)، أي أقل بحوالي 1,350 شيكل من العامل في تل أبيب.\n\nأصدرت السلطات البريطانية قانونًا أيام الانتداب ينص على عدم جواز تشييد المباني إلا باستخدام الحجر المقدسي، وذلك في سبيل الحفاظ على الهويّة التاريخية وجماليّة هذه المدينة الفريدة، وما زال هذا القانون ساري المفعول حتى الوقت الحالي، وهناك جهود لتكملته عن طريق عدم التشجيع على بناء المصانع داخل القدس؛ وقد خصصت السلطات الإسرائيلية 2.2% فقط من مساحة المدينة لتشييد المصانع، وبالمقابل يُلاحظ أن نسبة الأراضي المخصصة للبنى التحتية في تل أبيب تفوق تلك الخاصة بالقدس بحوالي الضعف، بينما تفوق نسبة تلك الأراضي في حيفا نسبة أراضي القدس بحوالي سبعة مرّات. يعمل ما نسبته 8.5% من إجمالي القوة العاملة الخاصة بمحافظة القدس في قطاع الصناعة، وهذا يُشكل نصف المعدل الوطني في إسرائيل (15.8%)، بالمقابل تفوق نسبة المقدسيين العاملين في قطاعات أخرى باقي المعدلات الوطنية. قامت بضعة شركات التقنية العالية بفتح فروع لها أو نقل مراكزها حتى من تل أبيب إلى القدس، وقد أدّى مثل هذا الأمر إلى توفير 12,000 فرصة عمل جديدة في سنة 2006. من المراكز الاقتصادية المهمة في القدس ما يُعرف باسم «مجمّع الصناعات العلمية الغنيّة»، وهو مجمّع يقع في شمال المدينة ويُشكل مقرًا لبعض أهم الشركات مثل: إنتل، شركة تيڤا لصناعة الأدوية، أتوترونكس عوفير، وشركة ECI للاتصالات. يُخطط بعض المسؤولين لتوسعة هذا المجمّع حتى يُغطي مساحة 530,000 متر مربّع (130 فدّان)، ويتسع لمزيد من الشركات بالإضافة لمحطة إطفاء ومدرسة.\nلعبت الحكومة الإسرائيلية دورًا كبيرًا في تنمية اقتصاد القدس منذ تأسيس «دولة» إسرائيل، فهناك عدد كبير من الوظائف الحكومية الشاغرة بالمدينة، كونها مقر للحكومة، والأخيرة تقدم دعمًا وحوافز متعددة للشركات والمؤسسات الوليدة، كي تستمر متمركزة بالقدس. أفادت مجلة «السياحة والترفيه» (بالإنجليزية: Travel + Leisure) الأمريكية أن القدس هي أفضل مدن أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط للسياحة الترفيهية في سنة 2010.\nيقول الخبراء أن اقتصاد القدس الشرقية لا يزال يُعاني من مشاكل وعوائق مختلفة لأسباب عديدة، منها جدار الفصل العازل الذي شيدته إسرائيل في عمق الضفة الغربية وفي محيط مدينة القدس، الأمر الذي يؤدي إلى إخراج مدينة القدس من ارتباطها ببقية الأراضي الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، والذي يجعلها مفتوحة فقط نحو إسرائيل، بالإضافة لإقامة الحواجز العسكرية وإعاقة دخول سكان القرى المجاورة للقدس، وباقي سكان المدن الفلسطينية مع ارتفاع تكلفة نقل البضائع نتيجة الحواجز والإغلاق. وحسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية في آخر دراسة أعدتها في شهر يوليو من سنة 2006 فإنّ مدينة القدس كانت بحاجة إلى استثمارات فورية تقارب المئة وخمسون مليون دولار كنقطة بداية كاستثمارات فورية خلال الأعوام الثلاثة القادمة، وتشمل هذه الاستثمارات مجالات الإسكان السياحة وترميم البلدة القديمة، وتطوير الصناعات الحرفية في المدينة.\n\nومن الصعوبات التي تواجه هذا الشطر من المدينة وتعيق نموّه بشكل مطّرد التشدد في فرض الضرائب وجبايتها وتطبيق باقي القوانين الاقتصادية والاجتماعية على العرب الفلسطينيين في القدس. كذلك يقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن هنالك تشدّد في منع دخول المنتجات الفلسطينية إلى أسواق القدس، خصوصاً المنتجات الغذائية كالألبان البيض وهي منتجات أقلّ سعراً من المنتجات الإسرائيلية المماثلة.\nوقد أدّت القيود والإجراءات الإسرائيلية إلى تراجع الأداء الاقتصادي للقدس الشرقية في مختلف القطاعات، فقد اضطر عدد من المصانع إلى تقليص إنتاجها أو إغلاق مصانعها بسبب انخفاض الطلب على المنتجات المحلية غير الغذائية منها إلى الثلث وضعف إمكانية المنتج المحلي على المنافسة نتيجة لارتفاع تكاليف التوزيع بسبب الإغلاق، كذلك ظهر أنه في شهر أكتوبر من سنة 2000 انقطع التدفّق السياحي إلى الشطر الشرقي، وألغيت جميع الحجوزات حتى نهاية سنة 2001، فكان من نتيجة ذلك أن أغلقت بضعة فنادق أبوابها وسرّحت موظفيها.\n\nيقول مدير الغرفة التجارية في القدس الشرقية، عزّام أبو السعود، أنّ موضوع الاستثمار، وبوجه الخصوص الاستثمار طويل المدى، أو الذي يستغرق إقامة منشآته عدة سنوات، والبحث عن مستثمرين، هو العنصر الذي يجب التركيز عليه في سبيل النهوض باقتصاد القدس الشرقية، ودعا إلى إنشاء صندوق ضمان الاستثمار، الذي يضمن للمستثمر الخائف عائدًا مناسبًا لأمواله، وضمانات أن لا يؤثّر الوضع الأمني السياسي على مشروعه، وضمان عائد مجدي لاستثماره، كذلك دعا إلى عدم إغفال موضوع التدريب واقتباس النموذج الألماني في التدريب الحرفي، كونه النموذج الذي قاد الألمان لإعادة بناء اقتصادهم الذي دمرته الحرب العالمية الثانية. وقال أنه يجب أن يتم إحياء مشروع سوق القطّانين بالبلدة القديمة، وكذلك الحمامات المملوكية أو التركية بعد ترميمها. هذا بالإضافة إلى تحويل جزء من الاستثمار إلى قطاع الإسكان والإنشاءات لتوفير المنازل الكافية لبقاء أكبر عدد من سكان القدس. والاهتمام الأكبر بترميم منازل البلدة القديمة، وأنْ يشمل المنازل القديمة خارج السور وذلك لتوفير نوعية حياة أفضل للسكان. وفي سنة 2010، أعلن المهندس مازن سنقرط رئيس مجموعة سنقرط الاستثمارية عن تأسيس شركة قابضة في القدس تحمل اسم«القدس القابضة» برأسمال 20 مليون دولار بهدف الاستثمار في عدد من القطاعات الاقتصادية والتعليمية في القدس الشرقية.\n\nالمواصلات\nيُعتبر مطار القدس الدولي أقرب المطارات إلى القدس، وقد كان يُستخدم للطيران المدني حتى أغلقته السلطات الإسرائيلية في سنة 2001، وسيطر عليه الجيش الإسرائيلي لقمع الانتفاضة التي قامت في وجه إسرائيل في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة. تحوّلت جميع الرحلات الجويّة بعد إغلاق المطار إلى مطار بن غوريون الدولي، وهو أكبر مطارات إسرائيل وأكثرها ازدحامًا، حيث يصل عدد المسافرين فيه سنويًا إلى 9 ملايين مسافر.\nتتولى شركة «إيگد» التعاونية، وهي ثاني أكبر شركة نقل بالحفلات في العالم، تقديم خدمة النقل للسكّان من وإلى القدس، وبداخلها، وهي تتمركز في محطة حافلات المدينة الواقعة في شارع يافا بالقرب من مدخل الطريق السريع الغربي للقدس. كانت الحافلات وسيارات الأجرة والسيارات الخصوصية هي وسائل النقل الأكثر استعمالاً في القدس حتى سنة 2008، عندما أُطلق مشروع سكة الحديد الخفيفة، وابتُدئ العمل فيه على قدم وساق. يقول المهندسون العاملون على المشروع، أن هذه القاطرات ستقدم خدمة النقل لحوالي 200,000 شخص يوميًا، وسيكون لها 24 محطة. انتهى العمل على هذه السكّة في 15 يونيو سنة 2010، وتمت تجربة القاطرة الأولى في 23 أغسطس من نفس العام.\n\nمن المشاريع الأخرى التي تنوي إسرائيل تنفيذها بالقدس، مشروع سكة حديدية سريعة تمتد من تل أبيب إلى القدس، يُخطط الانتهاء من العمل عليها في سنة 2011، وستكون محطتها الأخيرة محطةً تحتأرضيّة على عمق 80 مترًا (262.47 قدمًا)، تقع بالقرب من مركز المؤتمرات الدولية ومحطة الحافلات، ويهدف المسؤولون إلى وصل هذه السكة في نهاية المطاف بمحطة المالحة، وهي محطة القطارات المملوكة من قبل الدولة، والتي تقدم خدمة النقل من القدس إلى تل أبيب مرورًا بمدينة بيت شيمش.\nتُعتبر طريق مناحيم بيگن السريعة إحدى أبرز طرق القدس التي تصل شمالها بجنوبها؛ فهي تمتد على طول القسم الغربي من القدس وتتصل بطريق «معاليه بيت حورون» في الشمال لتكمل اتجاهها نحو تل أبيب. يمتد الطريق السريع رقم 60 عبر وسط المدينة بالقرب من الخط الأخضر الفاصل بين القدس الشرقية والغربية. يجري العمل حاليًا على تشييد طريق تحيط بالمدينة يبلغ طولها 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) لتصل الضواحي ببعضها البعض، لكن ردود الفعل حول هذا المشروع جاءت متناقضة حيث عارضه البعض وقبله البعض الآخر.\n\nالتعليم\nتتخذ عدّة جامعات مرموقة من القدس مقرًا لها، وتؤمّن برامج تعليمية للطلاّب باللغات العربية، العبرية، والإنگليزية، ومن هذه الجامعات الجامعة العبرية التي تأسست في سنة 1925، وتُعتبر حاليًا من بين أفضل 100 مؤسسة تعليمية في العالم. كان بعض أبرز العقول المفكرة في العالم أعضاءً في مجلس أمناء هذه الجامعة، ومنهم ألبرت أينشتاين وسيگموند فرويد، وقد تخرّج منها بعض الفائزين بجوائز نوبل مثل: أڤرام هيرشكو، داود گروس، ودانيال كاهنمان. تشتهر الجامعة العبرية بمكتبتها المعروفة بالمكتبة اليهودية، التي يُحتفظ فيها بأكثر من 5 ملايين كتاب. افتتحت هذه المكتبة في سنة 1892، أي قبل افتتاح الجامعة ذاتها بحوالي ثلاثة عقود، وهي اليوم المكتبة المركزية للجامعة ومكتبة إسرائيل الوطنية. للجامعة العبرية 3 أحرام جامعيّة في القدس: على جبل المشارف، تلة الشيخ بدر، وحرم طبيّ في مستشفى حداثة بعين كارم.\nتأسست جامعة القدس المفتوحة في سنة 1984 لتكون جامعة رائدة لسكّان القدس العرب، وتصف الجامعة نفسها على أنها «الجامعة العربية الوحيدة في القدس». تعاونت جامعة القدس المفتوحة وكليّة بارد من نيويورك على افتتاح كليّة مشتركة في ذات المبنى الذي كان يُشكل مقر المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني حيث كان يقع مكتب الرئيس الفلسطيني ياسر عرفات، وذلك في خريف سنة 2010، ومن المقرر إنشاء برنامج دراسي لمنح درجة ماجستير تدريس الآداب. يقع الحرم الرئيسي لهذه الجامعة جنوب شرقي القدس في بلدة أبو ديس، وتبلغ مساحته 190,000 متر مربّع (47 فدّان). ومن مؤسسات التعليم العالي الأخرى في المدينة: أكاديمية القدس لتعليم الموسيقى والرقص، وأكاديمية بيتسالئيل للفنون والتصميم، وكلا المبنيين يقعان في حرم الجامعة العبرية.\n\nتأسست كليّة القدس للعلوم التقنية في سنة 1969، وهي تؤمن برامج تدريب هندسية وتقنية للطلاّب، وهذه الكليّة هي إحدى المدارس التي تجمع بين البرامج العلمانية والدينيّة في القدس الغربية، وفي الشطر الأخير من المدينة عدد من المدارس الدينية اليهودية مثل «مدرسة صموئيل» و«مدرسة مير يشيڤا»، التي يُزعم أنها أكبرها. وصل عدد التلاميذ في السنة الدراسية الأخيرة في المدارس اليهودية خلال العام الدراسي 2003–2004 إلى 8,000 تلميذ، إلا أن 55% من هؤلاء فقط يتقدمون لامتحان شهادة الثانوية العامة، أما الباقون فيلتحقون بالمعاهد المهنية الحريدية. تُقدّم بلديّة القدس حوافزًا مالية في سبيل استقطاب المزيد من التلاميذ اليهود إلى الجامعات الإسرائيلية في القدس، بالإضافة إلى إعانات لأولئك الذين يستأجرون شققًا سكنية للإقامة فيها طيلة مدة دراستهم.\n\nتسعى المؤسسات الإسرائيلية المختلفة وبدعم من الحكومة من أجل تحقيق سيطرة مطلقة على قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، وذلك بعد أن تمّ التحكم بنحو 66% من قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، حيث تم فرض المناهج التعليمية على المدارس الابتدائية العربية هناك منذ عام 1968، وتبعًا لذلك تم استبدال كلمة «فلسطين» بكلمة «إسرائيل» و«القدس» بكلمة «أورشليم القدس». ويقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن الحكومة الإسرائيلية تحاول التضييق على الطلبة العرب في مدينة القدس لإجبارهم على ترك المدينة للاستئثار بخيارات التعليم، الأمر الذي يعرضهم للانتقال من مدينة القدس وفقًا لما تنص عليه القوانين الإسرائيلية. يُعاني معظم الطلاّب العرب في القدس من عوائق ومشاكل عديدة من جراء السياسات الإسرائيلية، فثمة اكتظاظ شديد في الصفوف المدرسية والدوام في غالبية المدارس على فترتين، وهناك نقص حاد وكبير في المختبرات في المدارس العربية في القدس، ناهيك عن ضعف التجهيزات الرياضية وكذلك النقص الواضح للمعلمين والخدمات، والملاحظ أيضًا أن المدارس غير مؤهلة للتدريس الجيد بسبب قدمها وعدم القيام بعملية تحديث ضرورية. ونظرًا لهذه الأسباب وصلت نسبة تسرب الطلبة العرب في القدس قبل الوصول إلى المرحلة الثانوية إلى نحو 50% خلال العقد الأول من القرن الحادي والعشرين، كما تشير إحدى الدراسات، وقد أدّى هذا إلى هجرة لطلاّب وأسر كاملة إلى مدن وقرى الضفة الغربية للبحث عن فرص تعليم مجانية. يلتحق البعض من المقدسيين العرب بالمدارس الإسرائيلية، لكن هؤلاء يتبعون في غالبيتهم إدارات وسياسات إما البلدية أو وزارة المعارف الإسرائيلية، التي تهدف إلى «تعميق المفاهيم الصهيونية، وضرب الانتماء الفلسطيني، من خلال حصص تعليمية عن الهوية اليهودية والتراث اليهودي الصهيوني، وربط الهبات والمكافآت للمدارس بنسبة التجنيد للجيش أو الخدمة المدنية والعسكرية، إلى جانب معايير أخرى».\nأطلقت ملكة الأردن رانيا العبد الله مبادرة «مدرستي فلسطين» وذلك لدعم التعليم وتحسين البيئة التعليمية في مدارس القدس العربية، «لا لأن للأردن علاقة بالقدس ودورًا تاريخيًا فقط ولكن لأن القدس مسؤولية كل عربي أولاً واخيرًا» على حد تعبيرها. من أبرز المؤسسات التعليمية في القدس الشرقية، المركز المعروف باسم «المركز التربوي لتطوير العاملين في حقل التعليم في القدس»، الذي يُعتبر المركز الوحيد التي يقدم الخدمات لمعلمي شرقي القدس. يرى المركز نفسه كمحور تربوي يُقدم الخدمات لجهاز التعليم بكل ما لديه من موارد وإمكانات.\n\nالرياضة\nتعتبر كل من كرة القدم وكرة السلة، اللعبتان الأكثر شعبية في مدينة القدس، سواء عند العرب أو اليهود. يعتبر نادي جبل المكبر (المؤسس في 1976) من أشهر الأندية المقدسية والذي يلعب بالدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز بالضفة الغربية، والذي هو عضو في الاتحاد الآسيوي لكرة القدم، ويتخذ من ملعب فيصل الحسيني مركزًا له، والذي يقع في الرام شمال القدس. من جهة أخرى، يعتبر كل من نادي بيتار القدس ونادي هابويل القدس من أكثر الأندية شهرة في إسرائيل، ويتخذان أيضًا من ملاعب القدس مركزًا لهما. من الأندية الفلسطينية الأخرى في القدس: هلال القدس، العربي بيت صفافا، الأنصار المقدسي، دي لاسال، أهلي القدس، جبل الزيتون، إسلامي سلوان، أبناء القدس، أرثوذكسي القدس، وغيرها.\nعرفت الرياضة النسوية الفلسطينية نهوضًا ملحوظًا في القدس منذ أن تولى اللواء جبريل الرجوب رئاسة اتحاد الكرة الفلسطينية واللجنة الأولمبية الفلسطينية، وقد تأسس فريق كرة القدم النسائية الأول بالمدينة حوالي سنة 2008، وواجه وما زال مشكلات كبيرة وهي النقص الحاد في الدعم المادي وحتى المعنوي، لكنه استطاع أن يصبح من الأندية المعروفة على الرغم من ذلك.\nيقام في القدس سنويًا، سباق جري سنوي نصفي، حيث يركض المتسابقون من كل أنحاء العالم متنافسين في جولة حول أشهر معالم المدينة. بالإضافة إلى هذا السباق النصفي ذو 21.1 كم، يمكن للمشاركين الركض مسافة 10 كم. كل من المسارين يبدأ وينتهي عند تلة الشيخ بدر أو «گفعات رام».\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من القدس عددٌ من المشاهير، من عرب وإسرائيليين، ومنهم:\n\nالعرب\nمحمد كامل البديري، مفوض مقاطعة رام الله خلال العهد العثماني ومؤسس جريدة الصباح.\nمبارك عوّاد، عالم نفس فلسطيني أمريكي، لجأ إلى القدس الشرقية عند قيام «دولة» إسرائيل ورفض الجنسية الإسرائيلية عند عرضها عليه.\nابتسام بركات، كاتبة وشاعرة ومربية فلسطينية أمريكية. نشرت مذكرات طفولتها تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي بعنوان «تذوّق السماء: طفولة فلسطينية»، في سنة 2007 فحازت على إعجاب الناس وفازت بعدّة جوائز.\nمصطفى البرغوثي، ناشط سلمي فلسطيني، رُشّح لرئاسة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في سنة 2005، لكنه خسر لصالح محمود عباس.\nجمال الدجاني، صحافي فلسطيني أمريكي ومنتج برامج تلفزيونية فائز بعدد من الجوائز.\nوليد خالدي، مؤرخ فلسطيني خرّيج جامعة أوكسفورد، يتحدث في أغلب مؤلفاته عن تهجير الفلسطينيين، وهو أحد مؤسسي الجمعية

      "summary": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.",

      "content": "Jérusalem (prononciation française /ʒe.ʁy.za.lɛm/), en hébreu : יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim (dénomination israélienne officielle) ; en arabe : القدس, al Quds  ou اورشليم, Ûrshalîm (dénomination israélienne officielle en arabe), est une ville du Proche-Orient ; sa vieille ville occupe une place centrale dans les religions juive et chrétienne, et une place importante dans la religion musulmane ainsi que dans le conflit en cours depuis la création d'Israël en 1948.\nEn 1947, dans son plan de partage de la Palestine mandataire, l'ONU dote Jérusalem d'un statut international, mais la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948-1949 aboutit à un partage de la ville entre occupation israélienne (Jérusalem-Ouest) et jordanienne (Jérusalem-Est). Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.\n\nMentions antiques, étymologie, autres noms\nMentions dans les textes antiques\nJérusalem est mentionnée pour la première fois dans des textes égyptiens dits « d'exécration » datant des XXe et XIXe siècles av. J.-C., période durant laquelle Canaan est vassal de l'Égypte pharaonique. La prononciation exacte de son nom ne ressort pas clairement des hiéroglyphes : on trouve Rushalimu, Urushalimu ou d'autres variantes.\nPar la suite, le nom de Jérusalem (Yeroushalayim) apparaît dans la Bible hébraïque, dans des textes grecs (dont le Nouveau Testament chrétien) et dans des textes latins, païens ou chrétiens. [réf. nécessaire]\n\nÉtymologies proposées par les spécialistes\nOn peut supposer[réf. nécessaire] que le nom de la ville évoque le culte du dieu Shalim (ou Shalimu), car il était courant alors d'appeler les cités du nom de la divinité locale. Le nom de « Jérusalem » renvoie donc probablement au culte de ce dieu cananéen, populaire dans le panthéon ouest-sémitique, divinité de la création, de l'exhaustivité[pas clair] et du soleil couchant. Le début du mot « Jérusalem » vient de uru, qui signifie « fondation » ou « ville fondée par », le sens primitif du nom est donc « ville fondée par Shalem » ou « sous la protection de Shalem ».\nUne étymologie détaillée a été donnée en 1859 par Nathaniel Philippe Sander et Isaac Léon Trenel : le nom de « Yeru-Shalem » provient selon eux de deux racines chaldéennes, YeRu (« ville », « demeure ») et ShLM, qui a donné les mots shalom en hébreu et salaam en arabe. Cette racine trilitère ShLM signifie aujourd'hui « paix », mais le sens initial était celui de la complétude, de l'achèvement, d'où dérive ultérieurement la notion de paix.\n\nChangements de nom sous l'Empire romain\nEn 130 après J.-C., l'empereur Hadrien donne à Jérusalem le nom romain d'« AElia Capitolina », Aelius étant le nom de gens d'Hadrien et Capitolinus en hommage au dieu Jupiter capitolin et procède à une refondation rituelle de la ville. Le nom couramment utilisé est Aelia.\nDevenue païenne, elle est la seule ville de l'Empire romain à être interdite aux Juifs, mesure qui reste en vigueur jusqu'à la conquête musulmane (638).\nEn 325, l'empereur Constantin lui rend son nom, mais la christianise.\n\nAprès la conquête musulmane (638)\nAprès la conquête de la région par l'armée musulmane du calife Omar en 638, elle devient en arabe Iliya (إلياء) ou Bayt al-Maqdis (« Maison du Sanctuaire »), équivalent de l'hébreu Beit ha-Mikdash (« Maison sainte »), expressions désignant le temple de Jérusalem ou la mosquée al-Aqsa (الاقصى), lieu du départ de l'ascension de Mahomet, située sur l'emplacement du temple juif détruit en 70.\n\nHistoire\nLa frise chronologique ci-dessous présente la succession des principales puissances ou dynasties qui ont administré Jérusalem.\n\nGéographie\nTopographie\nJérusalem, couvrant 126 km2, est localisée entre la mer Méditerranée (à 52 km) et la mer Morte (à 22 km), sur l'extrémité d'un plateau calcaire des monts de Judée (dont le mont Sion) à 745 m d’altitude moyenne, avec de fortes variations entre monts et vallées (de 700 à 800 m environ). Le mont Scopus culmine à 826 m au nord-est et la vallée du Cédron descend sous les 600 m.\n\nMonts\nLe point le plus élevé est le mont Herzl à l'ouest, avec 834 m.\nLes sept collines de Jérusalem sont une région vallonnée des montagnes de Judée, dont les longues extensions se poursuivent vers la plaine côtière à l'ouest et la vallée du Jourdain à l'est. En leur centre, Jérusalem est construite à quelque 700 mètres d'altitude sur cette série de collines : l'Ophel avec les monts Moriah, Herzl (הר הרצל) à l'ouest, des Oliviers (har HaZeitim) s'étendant sur plus de trois kilomètres avec les monts Sion, Scopus (הַר הַצּוֹפִים, har HaTsofim) au nord-est… Ces collines lui ont servi de défense naturelle par le passé et ont joué un rôle dans son développement au cours des siècles. Elles figurent actuellement des sortes de frontières invisibles entre les divers quartiers de Jérusalem.\n\nVallées\nLa cité est entourée de toutes parts de plusieurs vallées, parmi lesquelles celles au nord, proches du plateau, sont moins prononcées que celles situées dans les autres directions. Les deux principales se trouvent au nord-ouest de la ville actuelle.\nÀ l'est de l'ancien Temple, la vallée de Josaphat descend une partie de la ville pour devenir vallée du Cédron (nahal Kidron, נחל קדרון) ; elle sépare la Vieille ville du mont des Oliviers. La vallée Beth Zeita part du nord de la vieille ville actuelle et suit presque en parallèle la vallée du Cédron qu'elle rejoint au pied de l'extrémité nord-est de l'esplanade du Temple ; on y trouve des piscines (de Bethesda, d'Israël) alimentées par les pluies que charrie la vallée. À l'ouest, se trouve l'étroite vallée de la Géhenne (Guei Hinnom, גיא הנום) qui débute près de la porte de Jaffa où ici, elle prend parfois le nom de « vallée de Mamilla », se poursuit vers le sud puis bifurque vers l'est pour rejoindre la vallée transversale (débutant vers la porte de Jaffa et allant d'est en ouest) et celle de Kidron. Entre Kidron et Hinnom, et à l'ouest du mont Moriah, la fine vallée transversale du Tyropéon qui a été en partie comblée (et en partie par l'actuelle rue King David), commence au nord de la porte de Damas, entre dans la Vieille ville et continue sa route pour rencontrer la vallée latérale jusqu'à la Porte des Maghrébins (dite aussi « des Immondices »). Ces trois grandes vallées se rejoignent au sud de l'Ophel, notamment au niveau de l'actuelle piscine de Siloé, pour s'unir en Cédron qui s'élargit et poursuit sa course plus loin au sud-est, vers le désert de Judée et la mer Morte.\n\nClimat\nJérusalem possède un climat méditerranéen et dans une moindre mesure montagnard. Il est marqué par une forte chaleur et une forte aridité en été. Seuls quelques mois en hiver sont humides, en particulier février, où tombe plus de la moitié des précipitations totales annuelles. La neige survient une année sur trois, particulièrement en février ; certaines tempêtes ont fait beaucoup de dégâts, notamment en janvier 1992, avec 50 cm de neige, et en 1920, avec 97 cm.\n\nUrbanisme\nDémographie\nOn appelle Hiérosolymitains les habitants de Jérusalem.\nEn 1947, il y a 205 000 habitants dont 105 000 Arabes (51 %) et 100 000 Juifs (49 %) et autres dans le territoire incluant Jérusalem et les villes et villages proches dont Ein Kerem, Abu Dis, Bethléem et Shuafat. En 1967, il y a 263 307 habitants dont 195 700 Juifs (74 %) et 54 963 Arabes (21 %). En 2004, on compte 706 000 habitants dont 458 000 Juifs (65 %) (dont 200 000 à l’est) et 225 000 Arabes (32 %). En 2022, 59,4 % des habitants de Jérusalem sont juifs, 37,7 % musulmans et 1,3 % chrétiens.\nLa population chrétienne de Jérusalem est actuellement d'environ 16 000 personnes, soit moins de deux pour cent de la population de la ville, alors qu'elle représentait un quart de la population un siècle plus tôt.\nEn 2005, le taux de fécondité des populations juives et arabes de Jérusalem est identique pour la première fois avec 3,9 enfants par femme — conséquence de la baisse significative de la natalité arabe enregistrée depuis quelques années. Depuis cette date, la fécondité des populations juives (4,4 enfants par femme en 2022) a même largement dépassé celle des populations musulmanes (2,9 enfants par femme en 2022).\nUn autre aspect démographique est le déficit migratoire de la ville, puisque chaque année, les habitants quittant la ville sont de 6 000 ou 7 000 plus nombreux que ceux qui viennent s'y installer. La majorité part habiter dans la proche banlieue de Jérusalem où les coûts du logement sont nettement inférieurs.\n\nLa ville « trois fois sainte »\nLa ville de Jérusalem est considérée comme « trois fois sainte » car il s'y trouve les lieux les plus sacrés des religions juive et chrétienne et le troisième lieu saint de l'islam. Au total, on dénombre 56 lieux saints et une centaine d'autres de moindre importance, en majorité situés à Jérusalem-Est.\nLes trois lieux saints les plus célèbres sont :\n\nle mur, vestige du temple d'Hérode, appelé « mur occidental » par les juifs (HaKotel HaMa'aravi, en abrégé HaKotel) et « mur des Lamentations » par les chrétiens ;\nl'église du Saint-Sépulcre où est situé, selon la tradition chrétienne, le tombeau du Christ ;\nle mont du Temple, jadis site du temple de Jérusalem disparu et où se trouve aujourd'hui l'esplanade des Mosquées, (Haram al-Sharif[pas clair]) avec le dôme du Rocher et la mosquée al-Aqsa.\nJérusalem est donc un site exceptionnel pour les trois religions monothéistes.\n\nPour les Juifs\nJérusalem est importante pour les juifs depuis plus de 3 000 ans. Son nom est mentionné dans la Bible hébraïque 660 fois sous la forme habituelle et 158 fois sous la forme « Sion », nom d'une colline de Jérusalem employé métonymiquement pour la ville entière.\nJérusalem est en effet à la fois un lieu important dans les pérégrinations des patriarches racontées dans la Bible ; la capitale politique du royaume d'Israël de David et de Salomon, puis celle du royaume de Juda, plus tard celle du royaume hasmonéen ; le lieu de culte unique du Dieu unique, jusqu'à la destruction du temple de Jérusalem par les Romains.\nC'est à Jérusalem exclusivement que le culte officiel (notamment sous la forme de sacrifices effectués par les prêtres) avait lieu à l'époque des deux temples. Depuis la destruction de 70, il n'y a plus de sacrifices dans le judaïsme, le culte s'est totalement transformé avec l'apparition des synagogues.\nAprès la destruction du temple de Jérusalem en 587 av. J.-C. par Nabuchodonosor, durant l'exil à Babylone (en Mésopotamie) qui a suivi, le psaume 137 évoque fortement Jérusalem (« Si je t'oublie, Jérusalem, que ma main se dessèche... »). Dans ce cas, le retour a pu avoir lieu à la suite de la conquête perse et le temple a pu être reconstruit. Mais après la destruction effectuée en 70 sur ordre de l'empereur Vespasien, les juifs subissent une dispersion (« exil de Rome ») dans tout l'Empire romain. L'identité juive, constamment et intimement liée au souvenir de Jérusalem, la « fille de Sion », se maintient grâce à la transmission de l'héritage biblique et historique enseigné de génération en génération dans les communautés juives, jusqu'à l'apparition du mouvement sioniste à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nC'est à Jérusalem que, selon les textes, les Juifs devront attendre l'arrivée du Messie.\nDu temple de Jérusalem, il ne reste aujourd'hui debout qu'un mur de soutènement (kotel) couramment appelé mur des Lamentations, vestige du temple d'Hérode, devenu un lieu de prières juives, adossé au mont du Temple, devenu un haut lieu de l'islam (Esplanade des Mosquées.\nJérusalem est un lieu de pèlerinage à l'occasion des trois fêtes de pèlerinage (Pessa'h/Pâque, Chavouot, Souccot). Durant la Pâque juive, les mots « L’an prochain à Jérusalem » sont prononcés à la fin de chaque cérémonie.\nAprès chaque repas, la prière du Birkat HaMazon (bénédiction de la nourriture) mentionne Jérusalem.\n\nPartout dans le monde, la prière quotidienne du Juif pieux est toujours adressée en se tournant vers Jérusalem et bénit la construction de cette ville, tout en appelant au retour des exilés. « Puisse nos yeux voir votre retour dans la miséricorde à Sion », Amida.« Pour l’amour de Sion, je ne garderai pas le silence, pour Jérusalem je n’aurai point de repos », Is. 62:1.\n\nPour les chrétiens\nJésus à Jérusalem\nDepuis le Ier siècle, les récits de la vie de Jésus, notamment les Évangiles, font de Jérusalem le théâtre des derniers jours de Jésus lors de la Pâque juive, de sa venue au temple dont il expulse les marchands, de sa Passion, depuis son arrestation à sa crucifixion, puis de sa résurrection, point central des doctrines chrétiennes.\nDans certaines traditions, Jérusalem, précisément le mont des Oliviers, est l'endroit où a eu lieu l'ascension du Christ et c'est là que les chrétiens attendent son retour au jour du Jugement dernier.\n\nLieux saints chrétiens\nEn conséquence, on trouve à Jérusalem différents lieux de la Passion : le Cénacle (lieu du dernier repas avec les apôtres), la via Dolorosa (chemin suivi vers le lieu de la crucifixion), le jardin de Gethsémani (lieu de l'arrestation) au pied du Mont des Oliviers où se trouve l'église de l'Ascension, lieux de pèlerinage.\nOn y vénère aussi des souvenirs de la vierge Marie, de saint Étienne et de saint Jacques le Juste qui y ont été martyrisés, etc.\nSainte Hélène, mère de l'empereur Constantin (IVe siècle), puis les empereurs romains d'Orient et les empereurs byzantins y ont construit de somptueux sanctuaires sur les lieux saints, notamment sur le tombeau de Jésus.\n\nJérusalem dans l'histoire du christianisme\nTrès tôt apparait le concept de « Jérusalem céleste » (Livre de l'Apocalypse), repris notamment par Augustin d'Hippone au Ve siècle dans La Cité de Dieu.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège d'un des patriarcats historiques du christianisme, aux côtés de Rome, d'Antioche, d'Alexandrie et de Constantinople).\nElle devient très tôt un lieu de pèlerinage, le plus important du monde chrétien. L'irruption des musulmans au VIIe siècle pose un problème majeur aux chrétiens : les lieux saints sont désormais sous le contrôle de gouvernants non chrétiens, les califes de Damas, puis de Bagdad, puis d'autres dynasties régnant à partir de l'Égypte.\nLe lien très fort entre les chrétiens et Jérusalem aboutit à la fin du XIe siècle à l'épisode historique majeur des croisades en Terre sainte. En 1099 (première croisade), Jérusalem devient pour neuf décennies la capitale du royaume latin de Jérusalem. La ville est reconquise le 2 octobre 1187 par le sultan d'Égypte et de Syrie Saladin. Une troisième croisade est lancée en 1189, mais elle ne réussit pas à reprendre Jérusalem. La dernière croisade, la neuvième, a lieu en 1271-1272 : c'est un nouvel échec. Par la suite, l'idée de croisade persiste jusqu'à la fin du Moyen Âge, mais aucune expédition en Terre sainte ne peut être mise sur pied.\n\nPour les musulmans\nPour les musulmans, la sainteté de la ville provient de toutes les raisons précédemment citées et surtout à partir du XIIe siècle, du fait que selon la tradition, le prophète de l'islam Mahomet y aurait effectué son voyage nocturne (Isra) en 620 ap. J.-C.\nLe Coran ne mentionne pas explicitement le nom de la ville de Jérusalem mais les traditions l'associent à quelques passages du texte coranique. Le premier est le récit de la montée au ciel de Mahomet (al Mi'raj : l'ascension), accompagné par l'ange Gabriel, à l'emplacement de la « Mosquée la plus lointaine ». C'est en référence à ce récit que la mosquée de Jérusalem sur l'Esplanade des Mosquées (al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf, « Noble Sanctuaire ») a été appelée « al-Aqsa », ce qui veut dire « le plus éloigné », et identifiée comme telle au VIIe ou au VIIIe siècle. Absent donc du Coran, le nom de Jérusalem comme lieu du Voyage nocturne de Mahomet est, par contre, parfaitement explicite dans le récit d'Ibn Ishaq, rédigé 120 à 150 ans après l'Hégire (VIIIe siècle). Pour François Déroche, « une analyse récente fait cependant valoir que, d'après des traditions anciennes, ce voyage nocturne aurait été en direction du ciel ; c'est ultérieurement que l’exégèse classique aurait proposé de comprendre al-masjid al-Aqsâ comme le mont du Temple et fait de ce dernier le point de départ de l'ascension de Mahomet ».\nDe même, selon les traditions musulmanes, les premiers musulmans priaient en direction de Jérusalem - choix communément « interprété comme une tentative en vue de convertir les Juifs de Médine et des environs » ; la direction de la Ka'ba de La Mecque est établie par Mahomet plus tard, en 624. Si le texte coranique mentionne un changement de qibla, il ne cite pas la ville de Jérusalem. Enfin, s'appuyant sur des traditions juives et chrétiennes, l'islam reconnait dans l'expression « l'endroit proche », le lieu du Jugement dernier, à Jérusalem.\nL'islamologue Pierre Lory indique que « la sacralité de Jérusalem était déjà présente aux premiers siècles de l’Hégire, comme en témoignent les mosquées omeyyades. Mais son poids s’est accru à partir des XIe et XIIe, et s’est encore accentué à l’ère moderne ». Pour les musulmans, Jérusalem se voit reconnaître les critères du lieu saint islamique : « nombril de la terre, haut lieu, sanctuaire privilégié ». Ces trois qualités lui étaient déjà appliquées par la tradition juive, et dès le début de l'islam, des Juifs convertis à la religion musulmane, tels Ka‘b al-Ạhbār et Wahb b. Munabbih, « introduisent dans le corpus primitif, des éléments midrashiques les attribuant à cette ville ». Quant à la notion de « mémorial prophétique », elle s'inscrit dans la tradition islamique (Jérusalem est la cité des prophètes (nabî) David (داوود, Dāwūd) et Salomon (سُلَيْمان, Sulaymān), comme le Coran les décrit), et dans le fait qu'« elle a servi de point de départ pour le mi‘rāj, l'Ascension de Mahomet au ciel » ; ainsi, elle a eu un rôle fondamental dans la piété populaire et mystique.\nL'islam a déclaré Jérusalem comme étant sa troisième ville sainte, mais son statut pour l'islam « connut des hauts et des bas. ». Si les hadiths et les traditions musulmanes lui reconnaissent une place importante, elle est très fortement critiquée dès les premiers siècles de l'islam. La dimension religieuse de Jérusalem se développe principalement à partir de 1144 et de l'apparition du religieux dans le discours politique de Zengi dans sa lutte contre les royaumes francs ; les mots masjid Al-Aqsa (« la Mosquée la plus lointaine »), issus du Coran, ne figureront sur cette même mosquée qu'au XIe siècle.\nCe changement de rapport à Jérusalem s'observe par les critiques s'élevant du monde musulman contre le démantèlement des fortifications de Jérusalem en 1219 et la cession de la ville à Frédéric II en 1229, alors que la conquête de la ville par les croisés de la Première croisade, au XIe siècle, n'avait pas créé de telles réactions. « Cette faiblesse [de la sainteté de Jérusalem] aurait tenu tout d'abord au fait qu'une bonne partie des docteurs de la Loi s'opposait à la place d'honneur que les mystiques musulmans voulaient accorder à la ville ».\n\nAdministration et politique\nLa ville tient également une place importante dans les sentiments nationaux israélien et palestinien. L’État d’Israël a fait de Jérusalem-Ouest sa capitale en 1949 (la Jordanie occupant le reste de la ville) puis a fait de Jérusalem « réunifiée » sa capitale après la conquête de la ville en 1967. Bien que de manière générale, ce soit le pouvoir exécutif d'un pays qui choisisse sa propre capitale où siègent ses institutions fondamentales, la grande majorité des pays du monde ont depuis retiré leur ambassade de la ville, contestant à Israël ce choix de 1967. Pour la communauté internationale, Jérusalem-Est est considérée comme « occupée ».\n\nJérusalem a été proclamée « capitale éternelle » d'Israël en 1980 puis capitale de la Palestine en 1988, bien que l'autorité palestinienne n'y siège pas. Selon la communauté internationale, le statut de la ville doit faire l'objet de négociations entre Israéliens et Palestiniens.\n\nLimites administratives\nLa municipalité israélienne administrait 38 km2 de la ville avant la guerre des Six Jours. La municipalité jordanienne ne couvrait que les 6 km2 dont la Vieille ville. Le conseil des ministres israélien du 26 juin 1967 étend le territoire municipal à 71 km2 incluant des terres en bordure des villes d'Al-Bireh, Ramallah et Bethléem. Après la loi de Jérusalem de 1980, un amendement du 27 novembre 2000 fixe définitivement les limites de la municipalité dont la surface est en 2016 de 125 km2.\n\nQuestion du statut de Jérusalem\nLe statut de la ville, intégralement sous administration civile israélienne depuis la guerre des Six Jours, est contesté. La « ligne verte » séparait auparavant Jérusalem-Ouest (Israël) et Jérusalem-Est (territoire occupé par la Jordanie) depuis les accords d'armistice israélo-arabes de 1949. Ces accords indiquent explicitement que la ligne d'armistice ne préjuge pas des revendications territoriales ultérieures. En particulier l'accord israélo-jordanien stipule dans son article VI.9 : « Ces lignes de démarcation sont agréées par les parties sans préjudice d'accords ultérieurs ou d'accords frontaliers ultérieurs ou de revendication ultérieures des parties ». La tentative de confirmation de ces lignes d'armistice en frontières a échoué à la conférence de Lausanne de 1949 (27 avril-12 septembre). Elle avait été convoquée par la commission de conciliation des Nations unies. Finalement les accords d'armistice n'ont pas été enregistrés par les Nations unies qui ont néanmoins contribué à leur surveillance. Ils ont fait l'objet d'une garantie par les membres occidentaux du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies (États-Unis, France, Royaume-Uni). C'est la déclaration tripartite du 29 mai 1950. Entre-temps, la Chambre des députés jordanienne et la Chambre des notables a voté le 24 avril 1950 l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est et de la Cisjordanie.\nLa loi fondamentale israélienne du 30 juillet 1980 déclare que « Jérusalem unifiée [est la] capitale éternelle et indivisible d’Israël ». La résolution 476 et la résolution 478 du Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU estiment que le vote du Parlement israélien constitue « une violation du droit international » et appelle les « États qui ont établi des missions diplomatiques à Jérusalem de retirer ces missions de la Ville sainte ». Elles réaffirment que « l'acquisition de territoire par la force est inadmissible », qu'il doit être mis fin à l'occupation de Jérusalem et que « les dispositions législatives et administratives prises par Israël… n'ont aucune validité en droit et constituent une violation flagrante de la convention de Genève… ». Le Conseil de sécurité mentionne dans ses attendus la ville sainte de Jérusalem, en effet, la délimitation de la vieille ville est la seule internationalement établie.\n\nLe 31 juillet 1988, le roi Hussein déclare à la télévision que la Jordanie abandonne ses revendications de souveraineté sur la Cisjordanie et Jérusalem-Est à l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine. Pour autant, cette déclaration n'a pas de valeur en droit international. Le 26 octobre 1994 le Traité de paix israélo-jordanien est signé. Les frontières internationales entre Israël et la Jordanie sont fixées. Mais, le statut des territoires « …sous contrôle militaire israélien depuis 1967 », c'est-à-dire notamment Jérusalem-Est, est réservé. Il est néanmoins précisé que « le rôle spécial » du royaume de Jordanie sur les lieux de pèlerinage musulmans de Jérusalem est reconnu. Une priorité sera accordée à ce rôle historique lors des négociations sur le futur statut permanent de la ville, ceci conformément à la Déclaration de Washington du 25 juillet 1994. En 2000, l'Autorité palestinienne vote une loi établissant Jérusalem capitale d'un futur État, cette loi est ratifiée en 2002. Pour les parties en présence, le statut de Jérusalem reste une question clé de la résolution du conflit israélo-palestinien. En décembre 2003, l'Initiative de Genève, plan de paix alternatif établi par les anciens partenaires des négociations de Taba, prévoit, dans le cadre d'un règlement global du conflit israélo-palestinien, le partage de la souveraineté sur Jérusalem qui serait la capitale des deux États, les quartiers arabes et l'esplanade des Mosquées étant sous souveraineté palestinienne.\nLa question de la légitimité de chacune des deux parties sur Jérusalem entraîne également des débats d'ordre archéologique. Les Israéliens ont entamé depuis 1967 des recherches pour tenter d'apporter des preuves du Temple de Jérusalem. Palestiniens et Israéliens s'accusent réciproquement de mener des travaux, les uns pour détruire des preuves archéologiques de cette existence, les autres pour fragiliser les fondations des mosquées de la vieille ville. D'après les experts israéliens, les fondations des mosquées ont été fragilisées par plusieurs tremblements de terre au cours des derniers siècles. La discussion sur l'utilisation des expressions mont du Temple/esplanade des Mosquées (Haram al Sharif) est significative par rapport aux soucis des deux parties de gagner la bataille de la légitimité sur Jérusalem.\n\nPosition d'Israël\nAprès la déclaration d'indépendance de l'État d'Israël en 1948 et la guerre qui s'ensuivit, la ville se retrouve divisée entre une partie occidentale annexée par Israël et une partie orientale (comprenant toute la vieille ville) annexée par la Jordanie, séparées par un no man's land. En 1949, Jérusalem-Ouest est proclamée capitale d'Israël.\nEn 1967, lors de la guerre des Six Jours, Tsahal conquiert Jérusalem-Est et Israël déclare Jérusalem réunifiée, sa capitale éternelle et indivisible. Toutefois, en 1996, aucun État n'avait reconnu cette annexion et aucun n'y avait alors d'ambassade ; la situation a évolué depuis lors et plusieurs États (dont les États-Unis) ont déplacé leur ambassade à Jérusalem car l'ONU a jugé nulle et non avenue cette modification du statut de la ville (résolutions 476 et 478 du Conseil de Sécurité). Israël a confirmé la gestion de l'esplanade qui reste depuis lors sous la juridiction d'un organisme musulman, le Waqf.\nEn 1980, dans une des lois fondamentales d'Israël, la Knesset déclare Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible : c'est la Loi de Jérusalem. Les différents pouvoirs israéliens, législatif, exécutif, judiciaire et administratif, sont regroupés à Jérusalem.\nEn 2000 au sommet de Camp David II, Ehud Barak propose de donner la souveraineté palestinienne sur certains quartiers de Jérusalem comme Abou Dis (où se situe l'université al-Qods) ainsi qu'une gestion autonome des quartiers palestiniens. L'échec de ce sommet met fin à ces négociations. En 2005, la question du statut et de l'éventuel partage de Jérusalem reste au cœur du futur processus de paix mais aucune tentative de négociations n'a plus été entamée sur ce point depuis le sommet de Taba.\n\nPosition de l'OLP et de l'autorité palestinienne\nDès le début du Mandat britannique et tout au long de leur combat nationaliste, les Palestiniens ont revendiqué le contrôle de l'ensemble de la Palestine, avec Jérusalem pour capitale mais sans pouvoir concrétiser ses revendications.\nLors de la proclamation d'un État palestinien par l'OLP en 1988, Jérusalem est choisie comme capitale. L'OLP de Yasser Arafat s'est souvent positionnée dans le sens de ces revendications refusant d'avoir une autre capitale que Jérusalem. L'OLP possédait à Jérusalem un siège officieux, la « Maison d'Orient », dirigée par Fayçal Husseini ; en 2001, cette institution a été fermée de force en représailles à la suite d'un attentat. Jérusalem est par ailleurs la ville d'origine de réfugiés palestiniens qui souhaitent revenir y vivre. La question du statut final de la ville est ainsi intimement liée à la question des réfugiés palestiniens.\n\nPosition du Saint-Siège\nLe Saint-Siège n'accepte pas l'annexion de Jérusalem par Israël. Il préconise « un statut spécial, internationalement garanti et déclare moralement et juridiquement inacceptable toute décision et action unilatérale qui modifie son caractère spécifique et son statut ».\n\nPosition de l'ONU\nLa position de l'ONU concernant Jérusalem est liée à la Résolution 181 de l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies (le plan de partage de la Palestine) ainsi qu'aux résolutions de l'Assemblée générale et du Conseil de sécurité qui en découlent.\nLe Conseil de sécurité, dans ses résolutions 476 et 478, déclare que la loi israélienne établissant Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible est nulle et non avenue, et constitue une violation du droit international. La résolution invite les États membres à retirer leur mission diplomatique de la ville.\nDans sa dixième session extraordinaire réunie en urgence le 21 décembre 2017 après la décision du président américain Donald Trump de déplacer l'ambassade américaine à Jérusalem, l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies a demandé aux États de s'abstenir d'établir leur ambassade à Jérusalem et déclaré nulle et non avenue toute décision contraire. Malgré les pressions des États-Unis, la résolution a été largement adoptée par 128 voix pour, 9 voix contre et 35 abstentions.\n\nPremière proposition de l'ONU\nÀ l'expiration du mandat britannique, le plan de partage de la Palestine de novembre 1947 prévoyait que Jérusalem et Bethléem deviennent un corpus separatum sous contrôle international et indépendant de ce qui devait devenir un État arabe et un État juif. Cette séparation devait ainsi garantir à tous les cultes le libre accès à tous les lieux saints en sécurité. Le Comité spécial sur la Palestine avait prévu qu'après un délai de dix ans de corpus separatum, le statut définitif de Jérusalem serait fixé par la population consultée par référendum.\n\nHistorique des résolutions\nLes résolutions suivantes ont été adoptées par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies. Elles concernent Jérusalem de manière tacite (résolution 252) ou explicite pour toutes les résolutions ultérieures :\n\n1968 : résolution 252\n1969 : résolutions 267 et 271\n1971 : résolution 298\n1980 : résolutions 465, 476 et 478\n1996 : résolution 1073\n\nPositions internationales\nDans le passé, avant 1973, certains pays africains, y compris l'Éthiopie et la Côte d'Ivoire, avaient des ambassades à Jérusalem. En 1973, après la guerre du Kippour, de nombreux pays africains décident de rompre leurs relations diplomatiques avec Israël.\nAvant la résolution 478 votée en 1980, 13 pays avaient une ambassade à Jérusalem : la Bolivie, le Chili, la Colombie, le Costa Rica, la République dominicaine, l'Équateur, le Salvador, le Guatemala, Haïti, les Pays-Bas, le Panama, l'Uruguay, le Venezuela. Suivant les termes de cette résolution, les 13 ambassades ont été déplacées à Tel Aviv. Les ambassades du Costa Rica et du Salvador ont de nouveau été déplacées à Jérusalem en 1984, jusqu'en 2006 où ces deux États décident de transférer de nouveau leurs ambassades à Tel Aviv.\n\nLe Congrès des États-Unis a voté le 8 novembre 1995 le Jerusalem Embassy Act qui reconnaît Jérusalem comme capitale de l'État d'Israël, demande que la ville demeure indivise et prévoie des fonds pour y déplacer l'ambassade américaine avant le 31 mai 1999. Cependant le déménagement de l'ambassade a été reporté par la signature de dérogation tous les six mois, jusqu'au 6 décembre 2017, quand le président Donald Trump, revendiquant une nouvelle approche sur le conflit israélo-palestinien, officialise internationalement la reconnaissance par les États-Unis de Jérusalem comme capitale, et donne des instructions pour y transférer l'ambassade.\nLa décision de Donald Trump tranchait sur la politique de la Maison-Blanche de Barack Obama dont le porte-parole, par exemple, à l'occasion de l'éloge mortuaire de Shimon Peres, corrigeait l'expression « Jerusalem, Israel » en supprimant le mot « Israel ». La décision de Trump a été condamnée par des alliés de Washington et par l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies. Le roi saoudien a déclaré qu'elle risque de provoquer « la colère des Musulmans », trois jours après que son fils a proposé à Mahmoud Abbas de renoncer à Jérusalem-Est comme capitale.\nLes États-Unis inaugurent officiellement leur ambassade à Jérusalem le 14 mai 2018, suivis par le Guatemala le 16 mai et le Paraguay le 21 mai. Toutefois, le Paraguay annule cette orientation trois mois plus tard sur décision de son nouveau président, Mario Abdo.\nDans une déclaration au Figaro publiée le 30 novembre 2009, le ministre français des Affaires étrangères d'alors, Bernard Kouchner, déclare : « Pour nous, Jérusalem doit être, à la fois la capitale de l'État d'Israël et du futur État palestinien ».\nLe 8 décembre 2009, l’Union européenne appelle Israël à partager Jérusalem comme capitale conjointe de deux États hébreu et palestinien. Les Vingt-Sept assurent qu’ils « ne reconnaîtront aucun changement autre que négocié » au statut d’avant 1967.\nLe 15 décembre 2018, l'Australie décide de reconnaître Jérusalem-Ouest comme capitale d’Israël, mais sans procéder au transfert de son ambassade installée à Tel-Aviv. Le Premier ministre Scott Morrison conditionne le transfert de l’ambassade à la conclusion d’un improbable accord de paix et annonce projeter de n'ouvrir à Jérusalem qu'un bureau chargé de la défense et du commerce. Le 18 octobre 2022, la ministre des Affaires étrangères, Penny Wong, annonce le retrait de la décision du précédent gouvernement.\nEn septembre 2023, le Premier ministre de Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée James Marape fait de la Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée le cinquième pays (après les États-Unis, le Guatemala, le Honduras et le Kosovo) à établir son ambassade auprès d'Israël à Jérusalem. Cette décision intervient à la suite d'un lobbying dans ce sens de la part d'églises chrétiennes en Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée.\nEn septembre 2025, le Premier ministre fidjien Sitiveni Rabuka est présent à son tour à l'inauguration de l'ambassade fidjienne à Jérusalem, en présence du Premier ministre israélien Benyamin Netanyahou. Il répond ainsi à l'exigence du parti Sodelpa, parti de la droite chrétienne autochtone, qui est membre de son gouvernement de coalition.\n\nQuestion démographique\nStatistiques\nEn 1967, les autorités israéliennes recensent 66 000 Palestiniens résidents dans le territoire annexé par Israël, dont 44 000 de Jérusalem-Est, occupée par la Jordanie. Aucun Juif ne vivait à Jérusalem-Est, du fait de l'expulsion en 1948 par l'armée jordanienne. L'ONU a critiqué Israël dans plusieurs résolutions et considère que des mesures administratives ou législatives altérant la composition démographique de la ville n'a aucune validité.\nMiron Benvisti, politologue israélien et ancien adjoint à la mairie de Jérusalem, qui a longtemps écrit dans le journal « Haaretz », remarque qu'il n'y a pas de statistiques officielles et considère que la proportion démographique n'a pas changé. L'ancien secrétaire général du Congrès juif mondial (CJM) et analyste du Moyen-Orient, Dan Diker (en), critique le concept de judaïsation, entre autres, car Jérusalem était à majorité juive jusqu'à l'occupation jordanienne. Selon Diker, la population arabe de la ville est passée de 26,6 % en 1967 à 31,7 % en 2000 et le nombre de constructions dans les quartiers arabes est plus important que dans les quartiers juifs. Depuis le début des années 2010, le nombre d'enfants par femme devient plus élevé dans la population juive, en raison du nombre croissant de ménages ultraorthodoxes (250 000 habitants) et du départ des laïcs vers d'autres villes israéliennes. La population juive bénéficie en outre d'une espérance de vie nettement plus élevée (83,3 ans pour les Juifs et 73,3 ans pour les Arabes). En contrepartie,l'âge moyen de la première maternité est plus bas chez les femmes arabes que chez les femmes juives, rapprochant les générations.\n\nPolitique et territoires démographiques\nIl existe un débat quant à la volonté politique qu'aurait Israël de modifier l'écart démographique à l’est, peuplé essentiellement par les Palestiniens en 1967.\n\nEn 1980, Israël passe la loi de Jérusalem proclamant Jérusalem une et indivisible et avec des frontières municipales étendues. Le politologue Frédéric Encel le comprend comme une façon de « détruire l’influence palestinienne en modifiant l’équilibre géographique de la ville »[réf. nécessaire]. Il faut ajouter à cela les colonies juives relativement proches de la ville : au nord (Giv'at Ze'ev), au sud (Kedar) et à 7 km à l’est (Ma'aleh Adumim), ce qui augmente le nombre de Juifs dans la région aux alentours de Jérusalem, d'un périmètre de 440 km2[réf. nécessaire]. De nos jours, une ceinture de colonies s'est mise en place à Jérusalem-Est pour séparer les quartiers palestiniens du reste de la Cisjordanie occupée.\n\nLes limites municipales de la ville ne reposent pas totalement sur des territoires accordés par le droit international à l’État d’Israël et la construction de la barrière de séparation impose de fait des frontières non reconnues à l’est de Jérusalem. Les quartiers arabes seraient selon certains[Qui ?], victime d'une politique d'encerclement par les limites municipales de 1967. Jérusalem-Est faisait 38 km2 en 1967, sous l'occupation jordanienne. Et par l'effet de cette limite de municipalité, 108 km2 par la construction de quartiers juifs. Cet état de fait est accentué par le tracé du projet de barrière de séparation qui pourrait encercler Maale Adoumim à 11 km à l'est de Jérusalem. La barrière est destinée, selon Israël, principalement à réduire le nombre d'attentats terroristes palestiniens. Selon l'ONG palestinienne LAW (affilée à la Commission internationale de juristes) : « Israël continue à appliquer des mesures arbitraires et incompatibles avec le droit international pour chasser les Palestiniens de Jérusalem et les remplacer par des Juifs, de façon à cimenter son autorité sur la ville. Cette politique revêt des formes diverses : confiscation des cartes d'identité, retrait des permis de résidence, système fiscal injuste, refus du permis de construire. La politique de permis de construire, que le Conseil économique et social des Nations unies et Amnesty International jugent discriminatoire envers les Palestiniens, et la destruction de maisons appartenant à des Palestiniens affectent également la population arabe de Jérusalem-Est. ».\n\nÉconomie\nHistoriquement, l'économie de Jérusalem était centrée principalement sur les pèlerinages religieux et maintenant plus généralement sur le tourisme, et les entreprises publiques de l'État d'Israël. Depuis la création de l’État d’Israël, le gouvernement est demeuré un acteur majeur dans l'économie de la ville. Il ne génère pas seulement un grand nombre d'emplois mais œuvre à offrir les conditions propices à la création d'entreprises.\nBien que Tel Aviv reste le centre financier d'Israël, un nombre grandissant de sociétés high tech quittent Tel Aviv pour Jérusalem. La zone industrielle Har Hatzvin située au nord de la ville accueille plusieurs grandes sociétés comme Intel, Teva Pharmaceutical, et ECI Telecom.\nParmi les principales industries de Jérusalem, citons les fabriques de chaussures, le textile, l'industrie pharmaceutique, les produits de métaux, et les articles imprimés. Les usines sont situées surtout dans la zone industrielle d'Atarot au nord, le long de la route de Ramallah.\nJérusalem affiche, en 2023, un taux de pauvreté de 43 %. Les disparités sont importantes entre la population juive (32 % de pauvres) et arabe (61 %). Elles se retrouvent également dans le décalage entre Jérusalem-Ouest et Jérusalem-Est, en partie lié à la surdensité de l'habitat et aux sous-investissements : seuls 10 % du budget municipal reviennent à la partie orientale de la ville, qui représente 37 % de son territoire et 40 % de sa population. Le secteur Ouest concentre par ailleurs institutions et grands centres commerciaux.\n\nArt et culture\nPierre de Jérusalem\nEn application d'un décret de 1918, toutes les constructions nouvelles et les restaurations patrimoniales effectuées à Jérusalem sont réalisées essentiellement en pierre calcaire dite « pierre de Jérusalem », particulièrement la catégorie grey gold (« or gris ») issue des monts de Judée aux alentours de la capitale israélienne, utilisée déjà dans l’Antiquité — et servant encore de nos jours pour les édifices publics ou bâtiments privés.\n\nMonuments et archéologie\nOn trouve à Jérusalem un grand nombre de monuments religieux et historiques, comme le Mur occidental — aussi appelé mur des Lamentations — la mosquée al-Aqsa et le dôme du Rocher, l'église du Saint-Sépulcre. La Vieille Ville est complètement ceinturée de murailles qui datent du XVIe siècle. De nombreux sites archéologiques existent à Jérusalem, notamment les écuries de Salomon, la Cité de David.\n\nMusée national d'Israël\nFondé en 1965, le Musée national d'Israël est l'un des plus riches du Moyen-Orient avec près de 500 000 œuvres. Ce musée encyclopédique contient des collections issues de fouilles archéologiques de la préhistoire à l'époque moderne, et de dons importants provenant de tous les continents. Chacune de ses cinq ailes thématiques trouve son public : Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Judaïca (ethnologie juive), Sanctuaire du Livre (les plus anciens manuscrits bibliques au monde, dits manuscrits de la Mer morte, des grottes de Qumran), Jeunesse et médiation culturelle où certains programmes stimulent la compréhension entre jeunes juifs et arabes. Y figurent aussi la spectaculaire maquette de Jérusalem à l'époque du Second Temple (Ier siècle) avant sa destruction par les Romains, des répliques à l'identique de synagogues européennes du XVIIe siècle, et le célèbre Jardin d’art Billy Rose, conçu par le sculpteur nippo-américain Isamu Noguchi, tenu pour être l’un des plus beaux jardins d’art sculptural du XXe siècle, où se déroulent festivals, spectacles de danse ou concerts de qualité au milieu de nombreuses aires de détente. Ce vaste musée, sur un campus de plus de 80 000 mètres carrés, accueille près d'un million de visiteurs par an dont un tiers de touristes. Outre les programmes proposés sur son campus principal, le Musée d'Israël se déploie sur deux autres établissements de Jérusalem : la Maison Ticho (exposant des œuvres d'artistes de toutes disciplines) liée à l'École des beaux-arts Bezalel, institut centenaire sur le mont Scorpus, et le musée Rockefeller (archéologie de la terre d'Israël et de Palestine), édifice érigé en 1938.\n\nMusée des pays de la Bible\nLe Musée des pays de la Bible de Jérusalem est le seul musée d'histoire au monde qui explore et retrace la civilisation et la culture de tous les peuples mentionnés dans la Bible. Ses trésors archéologiques des cultures du Proche-Orient remontent de la préhistoire jusqu'à la rédaction du Talmud, au début de l'ère chrétienne. Il dispense en outre des conférences sur tous les aspects culturels de la région. Ce musée a acquis une renommée internationale en tant que centre universel pour la programmation culturelle et éducative.\n\nMusée d'art islamique\nLe musée d'art islamique fondé par la mécène britannique, Lady Vera Salomons, a ouvert ses portes en 1974 et est le seul de son genre en Israël. Il contient l'une des plus importantes collections au monde d'art islamique allant du VIIe au XIXe siècle, avec plus de 3 000 pièces rares en provenance d'Égypte, Syrie, Irak, Iran, Turquie, Afghanistan, Inde ou Espagne, qui instruisent sur les raffinements du monde artistique et culturel musulman. Une collection permanente d'œuvres est présentée face à des expositions temporaires qui lui font toujours écho. En outre, le musée expose la collection Salomons de montres et horloges remarquables. Il développe aussi des partenariats culturels, éducatifs ou événementiels en Israël et à l'étranger pour établir des ponts culturels et promouvoir le dialogue entre arabes et juifs, conformément aux vœux de sa fondatrice et de son illustre famille.\n\nParcs\nLe parc Rabinovitch également désigné sous le nom de Mifletzet (Monster) Park, contient une sculpture monumentale de Niki de Saint Phalle : Le Golem commandée à l'artiste par Teddy Kollek, maire de Jérusalem en 1971, inaugurée en 1972. Ce même parc contient aussi un stabile d'Alexander Calder, réalisé en 1976/1977 sous le titre Hommage à Jérusalem, comparable à l'Araignée Rouge du même artiste.\nLe Monstre et le stabile sont tous deux situés sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de Jérusalem.\nUn autre parc intitulé le Zoo biblique de Jérusalem, contient un grand nombre de sculptures monumentales d'animaux, réalisées par Niki de Saint Phalle en 1994 que l'artiste a réunis sous le titre L'Arche de Noé.\n\nVie sociale\nReligion\nJérusalem est une ville qui revêt une importance religieuse significative pour trois grandes religions monothéistes : le judaïsme, le christianisme et l'islam. Ces religions considèrent Jérusalem comme un lieu saint et sacré, ce qui en fait l'une des villes les plus contestées et les plus sensibles sur le plan religieux et politique.\n\nÉducation\nJérusalem accueille de nombreuses universités prestigieuses offrant des cours en hébreu, arabe et en anglais. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1925 ; elle fait depuis partie des 100 meilleures universités du monde et accueille des professeurs et étudiants de toute confession. Albert Einstein ou Sigmund Freud ont fait partie du conseil de ses gouverneurs. L'université compte parmi ses anciens élèves quelques lauréats du prix Nobel dont les universitaires Avram Hershko, David J. Gross et Daniel Kahneman.\nLe travail des étudiants et chercheurs est facilité par la bibliothèque nationale d'Israël, qui dispose de près de cinq millions de volumes. La bibliothèque a ouvert ses portes en 1892, près de trente ans avant la première université. C'est le site où figure le plus grand nombre de livres à thème hébraïque. Aujourd'hui, elle réunit la bibliothèque nationale et la bibliothèque universitaire. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem est composée de trois campus, l'un au mont Scopus, l'autre à Guivat Ram, et le campus de médecine au centre médical Hadassah.\n\nL'université al-Qods a été fondée en 1984 et son campus principal est situé à Abu Dis (plus précisément en \"zone B\", sous contrôle israélien et palestinien) au sud-est de la ville, sur près de 19 hectares. Il existe quatre autres sites de l'université al-Qods développés dans l'agglomération de Jérusalem, à Jérusalem-est (Haram) à Sheikh Jarrah, Beit Hanina ou Ramallah. L'université accueille des universitaires locaux et de pays arabes  pour enseigner à 13 000 étudiants venus des régions de Jérusalem, Bethléem, Hébron, Jénine, Jéricho, Naplouse, Ramallah, Tulkarem et Qalqilya, dans les domaines des arts, sciences et technologie, ingénierie, administration, économie, éducation, médecine, para-médecine, dentisterie, santé publique, pharmacie, droit, fondements de la religion ou études coraniques et islamiques.\nL'université al-Qods a fait l'objet de controverses quant à la pratique de la liberté d'expression.\nD'autres instituts d'études supérieures dans Jérusalem sont l’Académie de musique et de danse de Jérusalem et l’École des beaux-arts Bezalel dont les bâtiments sont situés sur le campus de l'université hébraïque de Jérusalem.\nLa faculté des Technologies de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1969 et offre un enseignement d'ingénierie et de hautes technologies industrielles de réputation mondiale. Différents cursus y sont organisés, notamment en bio-informatique, en chimie numérique ainsi que des programmes spéciaux tels que Education For Ethiopians.\n\nCritiques\nL'enseignement pour les Arabes de Jérusalem et d'Israël est critiqué pour sa qualité inférieure à celle de l'enseignement pour les Juifs. De nombreuses écoles de l'Est de Jérusalem sont remplies à leur capacité maximum, au point qu'on enregistre des plaintes contre la surpopulation. Cependant, la municipalité de Jérusalem est en train de construire plus d'une douzaine de nouvelles écoles dans les quartiers arabes de la ville. Les écoles dans Ras el-Amud et Umm Lison ont ouvert en 2008 En mars 2007, le gouvernement israélien propose un plan sur 5 ans de construction de 8 000 nouvelles classes dans la ville, dont 40 % dans le secteur arabe et 28 % dans le secteur haredim. Un budget de 4,6 milliards de shekels a été accordé pour le projet. En 2008, un philanthrope britannique a fait un don de 3 millions de dollars américains pour la construction d'écoles dans la partie arabe de l'Est de Jérusalem. Les lycéens arabes passent le Bagrut (en), comme examen, la majeure partie de leur programme d'études est identique à celui des autres écoles secondaires israéliennes et comprend certains sujets portant sur la culture juive.\nLes autorités israéliennes font fermer en mai 2025 les écoles de l'ONU destinées aux enfants palestiniens dans la partie annexée de Jérusalem. Les forces israéliennes ont expulsé les enfants présents sur les lieux et placardé un ordre de fermeture indiquant que les écoles fonctionnaient illégalement en l'absence d' « autorisation.» Le commissaire général de l’UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, a qualifié cette décision de « violation du droit international », rappelant que « ces écoles sont des lieux inviolables appartenant aux Nations unies ». L’Autorité Palestinienne la qualifie de « violation du droit des enfants à l’éducation ».\n\nSanté\nListe des hôpitaux et centres médicaux de Jérusalem :\n\nCentre pédiatrique de Réinsertion Alyn\nHôpital Augusta Victoria\nHôpital Bikur Holim\nCentre médical Hadassah (Ein Kerem)\nCentre médical Hadassah (mont Scopus)\nHôpital Hansen\nHôpital Herzog\nHôpital Kfar Shaul (hôpital psychiatrique spécialisé dans le « syndrome de Jérusalem »)\nHôpital de l'université Al-Qods (Muqased)\nCentre médical Shaare Zedek\nHôpital ophtalmique St. John\nHôpital St-Joseph\nHôpital St-Louis (spécialisé aujourd'hui dans les soins gériatriques et palliatifs)\nHôpital Summit\n\nQuelques quartiers\nLa plupart des quartiers de Jérusalem-Ouest ont été construits en deuxième partie du XIXe siècle, quand la Vieille ville n'était plus en mesure de contenir sa population croissante, du fait des différents mouvements migratoires et de son propre développement.\n\nLe Moshav Ha-Germanit (« Colonie allemande ») est l'un des quartiers les plus huppés de la capitale, situé à son sud-est dans le district de Katamon. Fondé en 1873, il tient son nom des Allemands protestants du mouvement sectaire « Temple Society » en conflit avec l'Église d'État, qui avaient considéré Sion comme leur deuxième patrie pour s'y exiler. Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les descendants de ces Templiers, la plupart devenus nazis, sont expulsés. Aujourd'hui, le quartier a gardé ses agréables maisons aux volets en bois et à toit de tuiles rouges, entourées de jardins, qui sont habitées par une population d'origine plutôt européenne et aisée. L'environnement offre une réelle qualité de vie avec un Musée de la Nature, un ancien monastère arménien, une école d'art dramatique, une piscine olympique, nombre de terrasses ombragées de cafés et de restaurants à dimension humaine.\n\nMéa Shéarim (lit. « cent portes » ; sens « cent mesures ») est un quartier de Jérusalem situé au nord-ouest de la vieille ville. C'est l'un des cinq premiers quartiers juifs construit en 1874 en dehors de celle-ci. À l'origine, il était beaucoup moins étendu qu'aujourd'hui et ne comportait qu'un bloc de bâtiments qui existe toujours. Le quartier originel était composé de petites maisons de deux pièces pour une dizaine de personnes chacune qui, serrées les unes contre les autres, formaient un rempart naturel. Refermé sur lui-même, le quartier comportait des portes d'accès qui étaient fermées la nuit. Il est très connu car c'est un quartier où vivent exclusivement des Juifs ultra-orthodoxes. La majorité des hommes ne travaillent pas, consacrant leur vie à la seule étude de la Bible, ce qui fait de ce quartier l'un des plus pauvres de Jérusalem. Aux entrées de Méa Shéarim, les habitants du quartier ont installé de nombreux écriteaux destinés aux visiteurs incitant ces derniers à ne pas rentrer dans ce quartier vêtus de manière « indécente ».\n\nMamilla est un quartier d'habitation et de commerce situé à l'extérieur ouest de la porte de Jaffa. Avant la guerre des Six Jours, il figurait une sorte de zone-frontière et l'endroit était délaissé par les pouvoirs publics. Après 1967, il bénéficie d'un vaste programme de réhabilitation et rénovation urbaines achevées en 2007 sous la houlette du célèbre architecte israélien, Moshé Safdie. Ce concepteur respecte l'empreinte du XIXe siècle en intégrant à ce nouvel espace de vie un grand nombre de structures historiques restaurées à l'identique et de nouvelles dans le même esprit, en utilisant une pierre de Jérusalem vieillie. Entre autres, s'y trouvent un secteur résidentiel dit « David village », une longue allée piétonne pavée au sein d'un centre commercial à ciel ouvert, bordée des vitrines de magasins d'enseignes locales ou internationales, et de restaurants attirant nombre de visiteurs qui bénéficient à son extrémité d'une vue spectaculaire sur la vieille ville, la Tour de David à proximité et le mont Sion. Ce quartier permet aussi la visite de l'antique piscine de Mamilla au centre de l'ancien cimetière musulman sur une partie duquel le futur musée de la Tolérance ouvre ses portes et fait l'objet d'une polémique internationale. L'endroit offre en outre des parcs verdoyants, des centres culturels (comme le Musée de la musique hébraïque, le Musée Nahon d'art juif italien ou le centre événementiel de la Création juive, Beit Avi Chaï) qui côtoient l'ancien Palace Hotel ottoman Art déco devenu le luxueux Waldorf Astoria ou le fameux hôtel King David, l'hôpital gériatrique français St-Louis construit en 1881 et ayant permis une percée dans les murailles de la vieille ville, dite « Porte Neuve » à l'époque ottomane, le monastère des Sœurs du Rosaire fondé en 1880 et accueillant les pèlerins depuis 1960, ou le Consulat de France.\n\nSport\nLes deux sports les plus populaires sont le football et le basket-ball. Le Beitar Jérusalem Football Club, dans le championnat d'Israël de football, est le plus connu en Israël, ayant été vainqueur cinq fois de la coupe d'Israël de football. Jérusalem compte une autre équipe de football, le Hapoel Katamon F.C., vainqueur une seule fois de la coupe d'Israël de football, qui est en troisième division, la liga Artzit.\nEn basket-ball, le Hapoel Jérusalem joue dans la première division. Le club a gagné le championnat d'Israël de basket-ball trois fois, et la coupe ULEB en 2004. Inauguré en 1992, le stade Teddy Kollek est le plus grand stade de football de Jérusalem avec une capacité de 21 000 places.\nLe marathon de Jérusalem a été créé en 2011 malgré quelques protestations. Le huitième marathon s'est tenu en mars 2018 avec une participation de 35 000 concurrents dont 4 000 étrangers. Le parcours commençait près de la Knesset pour continuer vers le marché de Mahané Yehuda, le mont Scopus, la Vieille Ville, la tour de David. L'invité d'honneur était l'Éthiopien Haile Gebrselassie.\n\nInstitutions israéliennes\nInstitutions nationales d'Israël\nJérusalem est le siège de plusieurs institutions de l'État d'Israël, notamment la Knesset (assemblée nationale) et la Cour suprême, les bureaux du Premier ministre et différents ministères.\nLe cimetière national d'Israël, avec notamment les tombeaux de Theodor Herzl et de sa famille, se trouve sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de la ville.\nLa Bibliothèque nationale d'Israël se trouve dans les locaux de l'université hébraïque, sur le site de Guivat Ram.\n\nInstitutions universitaires\nOn y trouve aussi des institutions universitaires, dont certaines antérieures à la création d'Israël :\n\nl'université hébraïque de Jérusalem, fondée en 1918, avec quatre sites, dont trois (mont Scopus, Guivat Ram et Ein Kerem) dans la municipalité de Jérusalem ;\nle centre Yad Ben-Zvi (recherche historique et archéologique), fondé en 1947, situé dans le quartier de Réhavia\nOn peut noter la présence de l'École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, fondée en 1890 et située dans la vieille ville.\n\nAutres\nC'est à Jérusalem que se trouve le plus grand centre mondial pour la mémoire de la Shoah, Yad Vashem, situé sur le mont Herzl.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège de l'Organisation sioniste mondiale et les congrès sionistes mondiaux y ont lieu depuis 1951, alors qu'auparavant la ville la plus fréquente était Bâle, lieu du premier congrès en 1897.\n\nInstitutions palestiniennes\nTransports\nTransport aérien\nL'aéroport le plus proche est celui d'Atarot, au nord de Jérusalem (31° 51′ 53″ N, 35° 13′ 09″ E), qui a été utilisé pour les vols intérieurs israéliens jusqu'en octobre 2000 notamment pour les vols vers Eilat, et est désormais placé sous le contrôle de Tsahal en raison de sa proximité géographique avec les territoires autonomes palestiniens. Depuis lors, les vols ont été transférés vers l'aéroport Ben Gourion, proche de Tel Aviv à une quarantaine de kilomètres au nord-ouest.\n\nTransports routiers\nLa coopérative d'autobus Egged, deuxième plus grande compagnie d'autobus dans le monde, dessert la plupart des localités autour de Jérusalem et gère les services d'autocars vers le reste du pays depuis la gare routière centrale sur la rue Jaffa, près de l'entrée ouest de Jérusalem.\nLa gare routière de Jérusalem-Est se situe rue du Sultan Suleiman, proche de la porte de Damas. Elle dessert les localités palestiniennes de Cisjordanie.\n\nTransports ferroviaires\nJérusalem est relié par le chemin de fer à Tel Aviv depuis 1892 (ancienne ligne de Jaffa à Jerusalem (en)). Son service a été interrompu en 1998 en raison du mauvais état des infrastructures qui furent alors rénovées. Elle a été rouverte dans sa totalité en avril 2005, avec l'inauguration de la nouvelle gare de Jérusalem Malha, située dans le sud de la ville.\nUne seconde ligne abusivement qualifiée de liaison à grande vitesse en provenance de Tel Aviv, la ligne de chemin de fer Tel Aviv–Jérusalem, au nord de cette première ligne, est ouverte en 2018. Elle est électrifiée et utilise plusieurs longs tunnels pour permettre le passage à grande vitesse des trains de la côte à la région montagneuse de Jérusalem. Les trains font terminus dans la gare souterraine de Binyanei HaUma nommée Yitzhak Navon située sous la gare routière centrale. Le trajet de Tel Aviv à Jérusalem prend environ 28 minutes.\n\nTramway\nLa première ligne de tramway, ouverte le 19 août 2011 et prolongée le 27 février 2025 sur 22,5 km, dessert 35 stations depuis Neve Yaakov au nord-est jusqu'au Centre médical Hadassah à Ein Kerem au sud-ouest. Cette ligne est équipée de rames Citadis, construites par Alstom et de rames Urbos, construites par CAF.\nChoisie pour exploiter cette ligne dans le cadre du consortium CityPass, la société Veolia Transport s'est trouvée confrontée à des critiques et s'est retirée dès 2010. L’exploitation est assurée par le groupe israélien de transports Egged.\n\nJumelages\nNew York (États-Unis) depuis 1993\n Prague (Tchéquie)\n Ayabe (Japon) depuis le 9 février 2000\n\nJérusalem-Est\nFès (Maroc) depuis 1982 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n Rabat (Maroc) depuis 2012 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n\nBlason et drapeau israélien de Jérusalem\nLe lion en posture rampante (dressé sur ses pattes arrière), représente le Lion de Juda, l'arrière-plan représente le Mur occidental et les rameaux d'olivier représentent la paix.

      "summary": "Jérusalem (prononciation française /ʒe.ʁy.za.lɛm/), en hébreu : יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim (dénomination israélienne officielle) ; en arabe : القدس, al Quds  ou اورشليم, Ûrshalîm (dénomination israélienne officielle en arabe), est une ville du Proche-Orient ; sa vieille ville occupe une place centrale dans les religions juive et chrétienne, et une place importante dans la religion musulmane ainsi que dans le conflit en cours depuis la création d'Israël en 1948.\nEn 1947, dans son plan de partage de la Palestine mandataire, l'ONU dote Jérusalem d'un statut international, mais la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948-1949 aboutit à un partage de la ville entre occupation israélienne (Jérusalem-Ouest) et jordanienne (Jérusalem-Est). Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.",

      "content": "## Overview\nJerusalem (Hebrew: ירושלים Yerushalayim, Arabic: القدس al-Quds) is the largest city of Israel. Israel claim it is their capital and a few countries including the United States recognize that claim, but most other countries and the United Nations do not.\nThe ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years. The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center. Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel. Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.\nJerusalem of Gold, as it has come to be known in Hebrew, is a fascinatingly unique place where the first century rubs shoulders with the twenty-first century, each jostling for legitimacy and space, and where picturesque \"old\" neighborhoods nestle against glistening office towers and high-rise apartments. It is one of those places that have to be seen to be believed.\n\n## Understand\nLocated in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea, Jerusalem is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is the holiest city in Judaism and Christianity, having been the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE, and the third-holiest in Islam. It has a history of nearly 4000 years, and has been fought over and conquered countless times in that period. While the city began to have a Jewish plurality in the late 19th century, today a wide range of national, religious, and socioeconomic groups are represented here. During the Jordanian occupation 1949-1967 all Jews in East Jerusalem were expelled and entry was barred for Israeli citizens of any faith and even today there tend to be more Muslims in east Jerusalem and more Jews in West Jerusalem.\nThe walled area of Jerusalem, which until the 1860s formed the entire city, is now called the Old City, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. It consists of four ethnic and religious sections—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters. Barely one square kilometer, the Old City is home to Jerusalem's most important and contested religious sites - the Western Wall and Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christians.\nSurrounding the Old City are more modern areas of Jerusalem. The civic and cultural center of modern Israel is in western Jerusalem, while Arab neighborhoods can be found in the east. Jerusalem became Israel's capital upon its independence. The city was reunited after the 1967 War when Israel captured East Jerusalem. Nowadays there is no visible sign of the pre-1967 border, but Jewish and Arab neighborhoods are still generally separate.\n\n## History\nArchaeological findings show development within present-day Jerusalem as far back as the 4th millennium BCE, but the earliest written records of the city come in the Execration Texts (c. 19th century BCE) and the Amarna letters (c. 14th century BCE). According to Biblical accounts, the Jebusites (a Canaanite tribe) inhabited Jerusalem until c. 1000 BCE, at which point the Israelites (led by King David) conquered the city, establishing it as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. Throughout this period, Jerusalem was located in what is now known as the \"City of David\", just outside the current Old City walls to the southeast, where a large natural spring is located.\nAccording to the Bible, after David died, his son Solomon built the first of two Holy Temples. The temples were north of the City of David, on a site underneath or very close to the current Dome of the Rock. Upon Solomon's death the kingdom split in two (though many historians contend that the two Israelite kingdoms were never united to begin with). The ten northern tribes became known as the Kingdom of Israel, while Jerusalem remained the capital of the southern Kingdom of Judah, ruled by David and Solomon's descendants. After the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem was the center of the only remaining Israelite/Jewish kingdom. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah including Jerusalem, destroying the temple and exiling many of the inhabitants.\nIn 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to Judah and Jerusalem. The rebuilt (Second) Temple was completed in 516 BCE. Jerusalem regained its status as capital of Judah and center of Jewish worship for nearly six centuries. Jerusalem would remain under Persian control until the conquest by Alexander when it would come under Greek (first Ptolemaic, later Seleucid) control. In the second century BCE, the Hasmonean family led a successful rebellion against the Seleucid Greek rulers of Judea, establishing an independent Jewish state which lasted over 100 years. This era is described in the deuterocanonical book of Maccabbees and an event during the recapture of Jerusalem is the basis of the celebration of Hannukkah. In about 19 BCE, Herod the Great (a Jewish client king under Roman rule) vastly expanded the temple area by building retaining walls to support a flat rectangular platform around the temple site. One of these retaining walls survives to this day as the Western Wall, and the platform survives as the Temple Mount.\nThe Great Jewish Revolt against Roman rule broke out in 66 CE. Its failure resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. A second failed revolt (132-136 CE, led by Simon Bar Kochba) led to Jews being banned from entering Jerusalem, a policy which continued for most of the time until the Muslim conquest.\nFor the following five centuries, the city remained under Roman/Byzantine rule. Under Emperor Constantine I in the 4th century, Jerusalem became a center for Christianity, with the construction of sites such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Muslim forces conquered Jerusalem in the year 638. According to tradition, their leader Caliph Umar visited Jerusalem and established the Temple site as a place of prayer. By the end of the 7th century, a subsequent caliph, Abd al-Malik, had commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock on this spot, as well as al-Aqsa Mosque on the southern edge of the Temple Mount. Muslim traditions vary about whether Muhammad's flight to heaven was from the Dome of the Rock or from al-Aqsa.\nIn the four hundred years that followed, Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Muslim powers in the region jockeyed for control. In 1099 the First Crusade captured Jerusalem. The crusaders killed almost all Jews still living in the Holy Land as well as a large portion of the Muslims. Immigration from Europe only partially compensated for this loss in population as many crusaders left after the fighting was over. The Knights Templar were established in Jerusalem and had their official headquarters on the Temple Mount. The Muslim ruler Saladin reconquered Jerusalem in 1187, but between 1228 and 1244, it was given by Saladin's descendant al-Kamil to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Jerusalem fell again in 1244 to the Khawarizmi Turks, who in 1260 were replaced by the Egyptian Mamelukes. In 1517, Jerusalem fell to the Ottoman Turks, who then controlled the Holy Land until the First World War. The current Old City walls were built by the Ottomans shortly after 1517.\nIn the 1860s, new neighborhoods were built outside the walls for the first time. This expansion of Jerusalem was fueled both by general urbanization and by immigration, as Jews and Muslims and to a lesser extent Christians came to Jerusalem for its spiritual and cultural significance. By the late 19th century, Jerusalem had a Jewish plurality. The 19th century also saw a weakening of the Ottoman Empire, and major European powers like France and Russia tried to play the role of \"Guardian of the Holy Sites\" and protector of both the local Christians and pilgrimage. One consequence of those power struggles was the Crimean War, another a seemingly fragile \"status quo\" regarding the Christian Holy Sites that while sometimes seemingly ridiculous (one stipulation is that a certain ladder must not be moved) has nonetheless kept conflicts to a minimum and allowed pilgrimages to occur surprisingly smoothly despite all the political turmoil the region experiences.\nIn 1917, the British Army captured the city. The League of Nations, through its 1922 ratification of the Balfour Declaration, entrusted the United Kingdom to administer the Mandate of Palestine as a Jewish national home. The period of the Mandate saw the construction of new garden suburbs in the western and northern parts of the city, and the establishment of institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University.\nAs the British Mandate of Palestine was expiring, the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended \"the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a corpus separatum under the administration of the United Nations.\" However, this plan was rejected by the Arabs. At the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem found itself divided between Israel and Jordan (then known as Transjordan). The ceasefire line established through the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan cut through the center of the city. In 1949, west Jerusalem became Israel's capital. After the 1967 war, all of Jerusalem was claimed by Israel as its capital. Israel has since annexed the entirety of East Jerusalem and treats it as part of its territory and distinct from the West Bank (though few other countries accept this annexation). Arab residents of East Jerusalem can apply for Israeli citizenship, but for various reasons few have actually made use of that option.\n\n## Demographics\nJerusalem's population of around 800,000 is about 62% Jewish, 35% Muslim, 2% Christian, and 1% other. Neighborhoods tend to be overwhelmingly Jewish or Muslim; there are few really mixed neighborhoods, though many neighborhoods have a small minority of people from other religions. However, it is common for people of all religions to meet in the workplace. The Jewish population is a mix of cultures, with many immigrants from the former USSR, North Africa, Iraq, Eastern Europe, the US, and other places. Due to Jerusalem's religious significance, clergy and laypeople from many groups have moved to Jerusalem and continue to do so. A notable past example were the Temple Society, a group of German Pietists who were expelled before World War II but whose \"German colony\" still stands.\nJerusalem is generally regarded by Israelis to be a conservative and religious city, in contrast to liberal Tel Aviv. Compared especially to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem is noted for its large number of religious Jews, ranging from Conservative Jews to the Haredim ('ultra-Orthodox'). Haredim also tend to self-segregate for various reasons and you'll find most of them in a few overwhelmingly Haredi neighborhoods.\nThe demographic history of Jerusalem over the last two hundred years is interesting and somewhat contentious. Jerusalem became a plurality Jewish city in the 19th century, and was a majority Jewish city throughout the British Mandate. However, then as now many Jerusalem Jews were Haredi and rejected Zionism. The 1948 war led to the forced displacement of all Jews (Zionist or not, immigrant or rooted in the area for centuries) from East Jerusalem and the Old City, including the historic Jewish quarter. From 1948-1967 the Jordanian government prohibited Jews from living in East Jerusalem and tried to erase traces of the Jewish past. Some Jews who have settled in East Jerusalem since 1967 see their actions thus as nothing but a \"return\" after the forced absence under Jordanian control. Arabs (whether Chrisitian or Muslim) living in East Jerusalem in 1967 were given a status as permanent residents and an option to acquire Israeli citizenship should they want it. However, most have rejected Israeli citizenship for various reasons.\n\n## Climate\nLocated near the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea, Jerusalem has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Due to its relatively high elevation (600 m-800 m above sea level) Jerusalem's air is less humid and more pleasant than in most other parts of Israel.\nWinters are often wet, with nearly all of Jerusalem's annual 590 mm (23 in) of precipitation occurring between October and April. However, in between the rainy days there are numerous clear and sunny days. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 12 °C (53 °F) and an average low of 4 °C (39 °F). Sub-freezing temperatures are rare, but do happen, and the city will get occasional snowfall during the winter, though it usually only lasts a matter of hours rather than days. Once every few years, the city will experience significant accumulating snow.\nSummers are hot and dry as a bone with virtually no rainfall between the months of May and September. Temperatures will generally approach around 30 °C (88 °F) during the day and cool to around 15 °C (59 °F) at night. Being near the desert, there is often a big difference between the day and night temperatures, and even the hottest days can turn into chilly nights. Spring and fall are mild, with minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, though heat-waves are not unheard of. Most evenings and nights are quite windy and long pants and a shirt are recommended.\n\n## Talk\nThe main languages spoken in Jerusalem are Hebrew in West Jerusalem and Arabic in East Jerusalem. Remember that Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left. Some Haredi (ultra Orthodox) Jews speak Yiddish in daily life, in part because they see using Hebrew for mundane things as blasphemous.\nThere is a significant number of Jews speaking Russian or French. Smaller groups of Jews speak Dutch and Spanish. It is not uncommon to see signs in Russian or hear Russian language radio.\nMost people in the tourist areas of the city speak English that is sufficient for communication. In particular, English is widely spoken in the areas most visited by tourists, especially in the Old City. Usually, even if you don't find an English speaker on your first try, there will be one nearby. There is also a relatively large number of Jews who have immigrated to Jerusalem from English-speaking countries, and in the tourist areas of Jewish Jerusalem they make up about a quarter of the population.\n\n## By plane\nIsrael's main entry point for the international traveler, 32.00944434.8827781 Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV IATA), is next to the highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Highway 1). Travel from the airport to the center of Jerusalem takes 40–50 minutes, or more if there is traffic.\nBy train - A train line from the airport to Jerusalem opened in 2018. See \"By train\" below.\nBy bus - Route 485 (Afikim) runs between the airport terminal and Jerusalem. As of November 2022, it only runs on late Thursday nights/Friday mornings (previously it ran 24/6 excluding Shabbat), and one can expect that the 485 will be eliminated entirely once the current train construction project finishes. The 485 runs nonstop from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, then makes a few more stops in the Knesset/museums area. It departs hourly, on the hour, in both directions, and costs ₪16 (you pay the driver when boarding). After getting off in Jerusalem, you can take the local bus, light rail, or taxi to your final destination. The bus stop towards the airport is on 31.7888535.204321 220 Yafo St., just outside the central bus station, 100–150 m east of the main bus station exit.\nBy taxi - The official Jerusalem-airport taxi price is around ₪250 during the day, ₪300 late at night. You might be able to find a driver for somewhat cheaper, but chances are they will drive recklessly. If you order in advance, companies like Daka 99[dead link] may offer rates as low as ₪160. Your taxi driver may either take Highway 1 or road 443 (which goes through the West Bank).\nBy shuttle - The 'Nesher' shared taxi service (+972 2 623 1231 - Hebrew and English) is a 10-seat minibus that runs approximately hourly services to/from the airport, 24/7. Fare is around ₪70 one way per person. From the airport, the shuttle waits on the curb outside the Terminal 3 arrival hall - follow signage to the Jerusalem shuttle. The shuttle departs when full, and will take you to the address of your choice in Jerusalem. Going to the airport, you must reserve your seat in advance by phone. Be on time for the pickup — they don't wait. Nesher is known for rude customer service, and for a long nauseating ride as the other 9 passengers are dropped off at their addresses before you (you always seem to be last!). Keep in mind that it is quicker, more comfortable, and usually cheaper to take the 485 bus, and a local taxi between the bus station and your hotel.\nSome Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are seen as \"no go zones\" by Israeli Jews, and some taxi drivers, including shared taxis, may hesitate or even refuse to take you to these destinations. You should understand that it is only because they genuinely fear for their own safety. If you have a hard time finding a taxi to East Jerusalem, take a taxi from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, and there switch to a local taxi.\nTaxi drivers, including shared taxis, have been known to overcharge or shortchange, so check the price before boarding, and check your change when it is handed back to you.\nBuses and trains do not run from Friday after 4 PM to 8 PM on Saturday. Taxis and the Nesher shuttle operate, but might charge you extra due to Shabbat time.\nIf you see Atarot Airport on old maps, it is a small airport 11 kilometers (7 miles) north of the Old City, which has not been used for international flights since the Six-Day War, and has been closed since 2001 and is about to be demolished.\n\n## By train\nIn general, see rail.co.il for fares and timetables.\n31.78821935.2024392 Jerusalem-Yitzhak Navon station (next to the Central Bus Station).      (updated Feb 2025)\nSince its launch in 2018, the train has been the most convenient way to get to the city from Tel Aviv and the airport. The train journey time from Tel Aviv is 35 minutes, and 20 minutes from Tel Aviv Airport. The train to Jerusalem runs every 30 minutes Sunday to Thursday. Except for the night trains between midnight and 6AM which run every hour. (Except for the nights between Tuesday and Wednesday and between Friday and Saturday when there are no night trains) On Friday, the train runs every hour until 2PM in winter or until 4PM in summer, and on Saturday from 8PM time in winter or 10PM in summer.\n\n## By bus\nBuses are the main form of public transportation in areas not served by the light rail. Jewish and Arab bus companies run separate bus networks in Jerusalem, serving Jewish and Arab neighborhoods respectively, although there is some overlap.\nThe Arab bus network, in East Jerusalem, is run by Al-Safariat Al-Mowahadda (\"The united traveling service\"). It mainly consists of lines running radially to Arab neighborhoods from two bus stations near Damascus Gate.\nThe Jewish bus network is run by three bus companies, which are:\n\"Egged\", which serves the southern parts Jerusalem along with some lines in the northern parts of Jerusalem,\n\"Superbus\", which operates the trunk lines, and\n\"Extra\", which serves the northern parts of Jerusalem.\nIt serves everywhere in West Jerusalem, as well as the Old City and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. It is more useful for tourists, and also easier to get information about. Unlike Arab buses, its fare is integrated with the light rail (one ticket will get you unlimited rides on bus and light rail for 90 minutes after your first boarding). Also unlike Arab buses, Jewish buses do not operate on the Sabbath.\nMost routes run every 15–20 minutes or better. City buses have a fixed fare of ₪5.9, paid upon boarding. Keep your receipt as proof of payment in case of inspection.\nYou must use \"Rav Kav\" for payment. Note, you can't pay the driver.\n\n## By shared taxi\nOn the Sabbath, and very late at night, your only option other than a private taxi is a sherut (shared taxi). These depart from Tel Aviv's Central Bus Station and Ben Gurion Airport, and charge a small surcharge on top of the normal bus fare. As of mid-2012 a sherut costs ₪23 (₪28 at night, ₪33 at Shabbat) and drops you off downtown, not far from Zion Square. There are no Israeli sherut lines within Jerusalem (unlike most Israeli cities). But there are sherut lines to Tel Aviv and Beit Shemesh as well as the airport.\nShared taxis are also the best option if travelling between Jerusalem and Palestinian cities in the West Bank, especially Ramallah and Bethlehem. These leave from near the East Jerusalem bus terminals outside the Damascus Gate. There is a shared taxi direct to/from the Allenby bridge (The border crossing with Jordan), for (Feb 2019) ₪42 plus ₪5 per luggage or 10 JD for 1 seat plus 1 luggage (picking up from Al-Souq Al-Tijaree \"The commercial souq\" not far away from the main bus station). All Palestinian shared taxis are very cheap, ₪5.00 for the surrounding villages, ₪5.50 for Abu-Dis and ₪6.50 for Ramallah.\n\n## Get around\nGetting around Jerusalem used to be tricky, time-consuming, and frustrating as the terrain and age of the city left clogged roads unable to handle modern population numbers. The building of the light rail line has mitigated this but where the light rail doesn't go the going may still be slow.\n\n## By taxi\nCabs are plentiful in the city of gold. You can probably flag one down quickly by walking to the nearest busy street. Just in case this doesn't work, it is good to have the number of a cab company ready, or to install the Gett smartphone app.\nBe warned as the drivers may try to rip you off by \"taking the scenic route\" or charging a fixed price instead of on the meter. Insist that the driver turns on the meter (moneh) and you should have no problems. If the driver will not activate the meter, get out and take a different one. If you have the meter on, cabs are relatively cheap.\nNote that a private taxi is called \"moneet\" in Hebrew, and \"taxi\" by Arabs. Both differ from the shared taxi (\"sherut\" or \"servees\"), which runs fixed routes for many people like a bus. However, unlike buses sherut do not take rav-kav.\n\n## By car\nDriving a car in Jerusalem is not recommended. In the central areas (roughly between the Central Bus Station and the Old City), the main streets are mostly reserved for public transportation, and the streets cars can go on are narrow and very confusing to navigate.  Then, when you reach your destination, there will be no place to park your car.  Elsewhere in the city, it is easy to drive, but still hard to find parking. If you can't use public transportation, taxis are probably a better option than cars.\nIf you insist on visiting the Old City by car, park in the Karta garage in Mamilla, close to Jaffa Gate. Only Old City residents are allowed to drive into the Old City.\n\n## By light rail\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail line opened in 2011. It links the north-eastern neighborhoods to the south-western neighborhoods, runs along the western side of the Old City, and passes through the city center. There are plans to construct additional lines. Its opening after long delays and controversy (not least because it crosses the 1949 armistice line) was a godsend for transportation in the city and where it does go, it is easily the best option.\nThe light rail runs past many areas of interest to tourists. Listed from east to west:\nthe Old City (Damascus Gate and City Hall stations)\nthe West Jerusalem city center - King George and Ben Yehuda streets (Jaffa Center station)\nthe Mahaneh Yehuda market (Mahane Yehuda station)\nthe Central Bus Station (Central Station)\nMount Herzl and Yad Vashem (Mount Herzl station)\nThe ticket price is the same as bus fare (₪5.9) with free transfers between them. When you get on, tap your Rav-kav card against the reader and make sure a green light is displayed.\nThe light rail runs from about 05:30 to midnight. Its frequency is every 6 minutes during the day and less often at night. Like buses, it does not run on the Sabbath.\n\n## On foot\nWhile Jerusalem is built in a mountainous area, the central areas of the city are rather flat and very walkable. Due to the altitude, the humidity level of Jerusalem is much lower than most cities in Israel, making walking quite pleasant. The Old City has to be toured by foot, not only because it is more impressive this way, but also because its narrow lanes and alleyways are mostly inaccessible to cars.\n\n## By bike\nJerusalem has bike paths, but the rights of cyclists are not always respected: you will frequently find bike paths blocked, and drivers will expect cyclists to give right of way, though they will not intentionally harm you if you force the right of way.\nBike rentals are available at the Abraham Hostel (67 Hanevi'im, Davidka square), as well as at Bilu Bikes (7 Bilu), among other places.\nA bike sharing program called Jerufun, including both regular and e-bikes, exists in the city. There are various subscription options as well as one-time rental. The program has fairly good coverage in Western Jerusalem.\nBike Jerusalem. This 3-5 hour guided tour covers most of Jerusalem's historical neighborhoods, including many places that most visitors never get to see. The tour includes The Knesset, The Valley of the Cross, Rehavia and Talbia, The German Colony, Mishkanit Shananim, Jaffa Gate the Russian Compound and Nachlaot. The ride goes through side streets, short cuts and alleys. Despite the hills around Jerusalem, the ride in the city is not as hard as people tend to think, and the ride can be modified to suit families and inexperienced riders. The Jerusalem Night ride includes a ride through the empty streets of the Old City.\n\n## See\nJerusalem has an amazing array of attractions for the traveler to see. The following are some of the must-sees. For more attractions see individual district articles.\n\n## Old City\nThe Old City is the atmospheric historical core of Jerusalem, surrounded by Ottoman period walls, filled with sites of massive religious significance and a bustling approach to life. (Please note that some sites, particularly Islamic ones, may bar members of other religions from entry or praying on the grounds.)\nThe most iconic site in Jerusalem is the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary, which is holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. Jews all around the world usually face the Temple Mount when they pray. It is crowned by the magnificent gold-and-blue Dome of the Rock, which stands on the site of the ancient Jewish Temples. It also includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque (The Far Mosque), from where the Muslim prophet Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven.\nThe Western Wall (Jewish) is a retaining wall of the Temple Mount, built 2000 years ago. It is the closest place Jews can go to the site of the Temple, so for hundreds of years it has been a destination for prayer, and for placing notes with prayers in the cracks between the wall's stones.\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre (Christian). At the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of the sorrows) in the Christian quarter of the Old City. It is the holiest site in the world for Christians. The first church on the site was built by Queen Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, the Holy Sepulchre is Jerusalem's number 1 site for Christian pilgrims and is consequently horribly crowded. Expect to queue for an hour or more to enter the tiny tomb chamber.\nThe Jewish Quarter was completely re-built in 1969 after it came under Israeli control in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It still holds many ancient masterpieces such as the Hezekiah's wall (700 BCE), Burnt House (70 CE), Cardo (550 CE), and Western Wall.

The southern route starts from outside the Jaffa gate and circles the Armenian quarter and the Jewish quarter.\nWestern Wall Tunnels is a tour that is well worth your time. The guides there are well versed in the history of the wall and the explanation of the first two temples and the subsequent construction of the Dome of the Rock will create a great picture of the conflict between relevant cultures. Reservations are recommended, but individual walk-ins can sometimes be squeezed in.\nThe City of David water tunnels tour is interesting.

The water is ankle deep for most of the tour.\nMahane Yehuda is the main outdoor market of West Jerusalem. Large, loud, and labyrinthine, the market boasts a huge number of stalls, generally open Sunday to Thursday 08:00-20:00, and F 08:00-15:00, closed Shabbat. Fresh produce, pastries, spices, salads abound. Definitely the place for a bargain and a unique insight into traditional Israeli culture.

The campus offers tours of the main building, and hosts weekly concerts.\n\n## Buy\nIf shopping in the Old City's markets, where almost anything can be found, be prepared to haggle. You will find beautiful and unique gifts here including jewelry, bed covers, statues, and spices, as well as more touristy goods like T-shirts with memorably funny designs.\nFor Judaica, the Old City's Jewish Quarter, Mea Shearim (dress modestly), Ben Yehudah St, and Emek Refaim are good places to look.\nThe new city center, around the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, is a great place to buy things and just hang out.\nThe Mamilla pedestrian mall just outside Jaffa Gate is a picturesque place to walk, and has a good selection of upscale international clothing stores.\n\n## Eat\nJerusalem, being a multicultural city, has food from all countries, cultures and tastes. Besides the ubiquitous falafel stands, there is European, Ethiopian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern food. There is also a large range of prices, from the ritzy Mamilla and Emek Refaim, to falafel stands surrounding Machaneh Yehuda and the Central Bus Station. A good rule of thumb is to look for restaurants filled with Hebrew or Arabic speaking locals. For falafel, the busiest place is probably the best, because falafel balls become less tasty the longer they are waiting out of the deep fryer.\nIf you keep kosher, Jerusalem is a wonderful place to visit. In the Jewish sections of the city almost everything is kosher. However you should still check for the kashrut certificate on the wall. If you don't see it and the staff cannot show it to you, it's a good sign to move along. The certificate is stamped בשרי (\"basari\", meat) or חלבי (\"halavi\", dairy). The current Jerusalem certificates are cream colored for normal certification, light purple for stricter certification (\"mehuderet\"), and marbled brown colored for strictest supervision (\"mehadrin\"). Certificates are valid for 6 or 12 months at a time (typically until Pesach or Rosh Hashana) with the expiration date prominently marked. Note it is not unusual for it to take a few days to get the new certificate up. In Haredi areas, the municipal kashrut certificate may be missing, but a certificate from a local Haredi organization will be provided. Also note that only some branches of McDonalds in Jerusalem are kosher. Kosher branches have yellow arches on a blue background, rather than the usual red background.\nDespite its name, the \"Jerusalem artichoke\" has no connection to Jerusalem, and you won't find it used more widely here than elsewhere.\nHowever, there is an authentic Jerusalem food - the Jerusalem mixed grill (me'orav yerushalmi), which was invented in the 1960s at one of the steakhouses near the Mahaneh Yehuda market and has since spread widely across Israel. It consists of a mixture of spicy grilled meat chunks including chicken breasts, hearts, and livers, and pieces of lamb. Nowadays you can get it as fast food wrapped in pita or laffa bread, or as a main course in sit-down restaurants. One famous place is Steakiyat Hatzot, Agrippas street; check out the photos on the wall.\n\n## Drink\nMost of the nightclubs and bars are in West Jerusalem, mostly in the city center or Talpiyot district. Consult the district article for specifics.\nIf you are looking for alcohol stores, there is one right by the Jaffa gate and several on Jaffa Rd. One of the stores by the Generali building (located on the right side on Jaffa when you're facing the building) stocks a wide variety of different beers and also has great prices, lower than that of other stores.\n\n## Sleep\nThe Old City has a diverse mix of small hotels, religious hospices and cheap hostels. The cheapest accommodation is found here.\nWest Jerusalem has a blend of B&Bs, guesthouses, small hotels and large hotels up to 5-star accommodation, including the famous King David Hotel, which is worth visiting for its architecture even if you don't stay there.\n\n## Connect\nWith the rise of cell phones, public telephones hardly exist but they take prepaid phone cards which can be purchased at post offices, shops and lottery kiosks. They are available in the following denominations: 20 units (₪13), 50 units (₪29), or 120 units (₪60). Calls made on Saturdays and Friday evenings are 25% cheaper than the standard rate.\nCoin-phones (usually ₪1) are also available. Those are private \"public phones\", owned and operated by shop owners.\nIsraeli Post offices are available for service from 08:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00 (Su-Th) though hours may vary per branch.\nThe central post office for West Jerusalem is located near the head of Jaffa Road, close to the municipality offices. Open until 19:00.\nIn the Old City, post offices can be found in the Armenian Quarter near the Jaffa Gate, diagonally opposite the Tower of David Museum, as well as the Jewish Quarter on Plugat Ha-Kotel near the Broad Wall.\nA post office is in a small shopping mall on King George Street, immediately south of Jaffa street.\nIsrael uses the red British \"pillar\" post boxes in some areas of Jerusalem, a reminder of the previous British Mandate.\nAlternatively, most inexpensive cell phone plans include a few GB per month of internet data.\n\n## Stay safe\nIn the case of injury or other emergency incidents, Police services can be reached by dialing 100, Ambulance services can be reached by dialing 101, and the Fire Department can be reached by dialing 102. All emergency services employ English-speaking operators.\nDespite alarming news headlines, Jerusalem is relatively safe for tourists. Nonetheless, Palestinians have attacked Israeli police officers and Jewish civilians, primarily with knives. Jews have committed similar attacks on Arabs, and in one case even on Gay Pride Parade participants — so check on current conditions before you go.\nNon-rigorous security checks can be frequent, especially when entering hotels, cinemas/theaters and shopping areas. It is wise to carry some identification.\nLike anywhere in Israel, you may notice large numbers of soldiers carrying weapons. These are generally off-duty soldiers going to and from their bases, so they have nothing to do with the security situation. However, in and around the Old City there will probably be many on-duty armed police. Also, educational tours for soldiers are often conducted in the Old City, and the IDF's \"swearing in ceremony\" is held near the Western Wall.\nTourists are not usually targeted in terror attacks, and most have occurred well away from tourist sites. Naturally it is important to remain vigilant and alert.\nThere are a few areas in the city where it is important to be mindful of one's dress, religion, and time period visiting. Here are some guidelines:\nDress. When visiting any holy site or religious neighborhood one should dress modestly. For men this means long pants, a closed shirt with sleeves, and a head covering. For women, it means a skirt that falls below the knee, a shirt with elbow-length sleeves and no exposed cleavage or stomach. This applies to churches, mosques, and synagogues, as well as the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) and Western Wall (the plaza by the Wall is essentially an open-air synagogue, and there are mosques on the Temple Mount), and Haredi neighborhoods such as Mea Shearim.\nReligion. It is not safe for noticeably Jewish people (e.g. wearing a kippah or speaking Hebrew) to enter Muslim neighborhoods. This includes the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, though the heavy police presence there makes it safer. It is also somewhat unsafe for Arabs to enter Haredi neighborhoods, or to enter the Jewish city center very late at night when Jewish youth have been drinking.\nTime. Non-Muslims are not allowed on the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) during times of Muslim prayer. During Shabbat and Jewish holidays, one should not publicly use electronic devices or smoke in any synagogue, at the Western Wall, or in any Haredi neighborhood. (Smoking is, otherwise, rather common in Israel, so nonsmokers should also be forewarned.) Driving in Haredi neighborhoods on Shabbat and Jewish holidays is not allowed, and roads may be closed off. During Ramadan, eating, drinking or smoking in the streets of Muslim areas is culturally insensitive, although tourists are rarely interfered with.\nDue to the mixture of religions, and the mixture of cultures within religions, tensions can sometimes be high. Avoid any confrontations between locals. Although extremely rare, some locals may carry xenophobic attitudes and ask foreigners to leave the area near their home. You have the right to see all of Jerusalem, but moving along to another area will resolve the situation.\nStreet crime is nearly nonexistent, although pickpockets may work in the Old City.\nOn the whole, theft is not a large-scale problem. To minimize risk, however, normal precautions apply. Do not leave valuable objects inside a car or in full view in your hotel room. There are many ATMs throughout the city and credit cards are widely accepted, so there is no need to carry large amounts of cash.\n\n## Consulates and embassies\nDue to the disputed status of Jerusalem, most countries maintaining embassies in Israel keep them in nearby Tel Aviv, with the notable exception of the United States. However, they often maintain a consulate in Jerusalem as well. The U.S. embassy moved here in 2018, and some US allies have announced an intention to either move an existing embassy to Jerusalem or open a new one here.\nGreece (Consulate), 31 Rachel Immenu, Kattamon, ☏ +972 2 561 9583, fax: +972 2 561 0325, grgencon.jer@mfa.gr.
