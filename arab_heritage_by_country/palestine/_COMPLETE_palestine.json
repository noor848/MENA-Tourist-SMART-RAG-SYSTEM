          "content": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\n\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as Hierapolis. However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to Hierolophos.\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh. The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש). The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only—Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies—United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now closed. There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 °C (75.6 °F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\n\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine. In 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 Time magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\n\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\n\nUrban structure\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafés and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nTransportation\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\n\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (Jibal al-Quds), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division.

          "summary": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.",

          "content": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.\n\nالتسمية\nأوّل اسم ثابت لمدينة القدس هو «أورسالم» الذي يظهر في رسائل تل العمارنة المصرية، ويعني أسس سالم؛ وسالم أو شالم هو اسم الإله الكنعاني حامي المدينة، وقيل مدينة السلام. وقد ظهرت هذه التسمية مرتين في الوثائق المصرية القديمة: حوالي سنة 2000 ق.م و1330 ق.م، ثم ما لبثت تلك المدينة، وفقًا لسفر الملوك الثاني، أن أخذت اسم «يبوس» نسبة إلى اليبوسيين، المتفرعين من الكنعانيين، وقد بنوا قلعتها والتي تعني بالكنعانية مرتفع. تذكر مصادر تاريخية عن الملك اليبوسي «ملكي صادق» أنه هو أول من بنى يبوس أو القدس، وكان محبًا للسلام، حتى أُطلق عليه «ملك السلام» ومن هنا جاء اسم المدينة وقد قيل أنه هو من سماها بأورسالم أي «مدينة سالم».\nظهر الاسم «أورشليم» أوّل ما ظهر في الكتاب المقدس، وفي سفر يشوع تحديدًا، ويقول الخبراء اللغويون أنه نحت، أي دمج، لكلمتيّ أور، التي تعني «موقع مخصص لعبادة الله وخدمته»، والجذر اللغوي س ل م، الذي يعني على ما يُعتقد «سلام»، أو يشير إلى إله كنعاني قديم اسمه «شاليم»، وهو إله الغسق. أطلق العبرانيون على أقدم الأقسام المأهولة من المدينة اسميّ «مدينة داود» و«صهيون»، وقد أصبحت هذه الأسماء ألقاب ونعوت للمدينة ككل فيما بعد بحسب التقليد اليهودي. حُرّف اسم القدس من قبل الإغريق خلال العصر الهيليني، فأصبح يُلفظ «هيروسليما» (باليونانية: Ἱεροσόλυμα)، وعند سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية على حوض البحر المتوسط، أطلق الرومان على المدينة تسمية «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» (باللاتينية: Colonia Aelia Capitolina) سنة 131 للميلاد. في بعض الرسائل الإسلامية باللغة العربية من القرون الوسطى، وخصوصًا في العهدة العمرية، تذكر المدينة باسم «إيلياء» أو «إيليا» وهو على ما يبدو اختصار لاسمها اللاتيني. ذُكرت المدينة في فترة لاحقة من القرون الوسطى باسم «بيت المقدس»، وهو مأخوذ من الآرامية בית מקדשא بمعنى «الكنيس». ولا يزال هذا الاسم يُستخدم في بعض اللغات مثل اللغة الأردية، وهو مصدر لقب «مقدسي» الذي يطلق على سكان المدينة.\nأما اسم القدس الشائع اليوم في العربية وخاصة لدى المسلمين فقد يكون اختصارًا لاسم «بيت المقدس» أو لعبارة «مدينة القدس» وكثيرًا ما يُقال «القدس الشريف» لتأكيد قدسية المدينة. أما السلطات الإسرائيلية فتشير في إعلاناتها إلى المدينة باسم «أورشليم القدس».\n\nتاريخ القدس\nنظرة شاملة\nتلعب القدس دورًا أساسيًا عند الحديث عن القومية العربية عمومًا والوطنية الفلسطينية خصوصًا، وكذلك بالنسبة للقومية الإسرائيلية أو الصهيونية، لذا فإن الحديث عن تاريخها الطويل، الذي يمتد لأكثر من 5,000 سنة، غالبًا ما يأخذ منحى متحيزًا من الناحية الأيديولوجية. فعلى سبيل المثال، يُركز القوميون الإسرائيليون على الحقبة التاريخية التي استوطن فيها بنو إسرائيل أرض فلسطين ويزعمون بأن جميع يهود العالم اليوم ينحدرون من أولئك القوم إلى جانب المكابيين، مما يدعم قضيتهم الهادفة إلى توطين يهود العالم في فلسطين ويعزز من موقفهم أمام الشعوب المختلفة، حيث يُظهرون أنهم الورثة الشرعيين للمدينة والبلاد ككل. ومن ناحية أخرى، يُركز القوميون العرب والفلسطينيين على الحقبتين المسيحية والإسلامية وغيرها من الحقبات غير الإسرائيلية في تاريخ المدينة، مما يدعم قضيتهم التي تقول بأن الفلسطينيين الحاليين هم ورثة المدينة والبلاد بما أنهم ينحدرون من جميع الشعوب والأمم التي سكنت القدس وفلسطين عبر العصور وتزاوجت واختلطت. وكنتيجة لهذا التباين، يزعم كل من الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين أن الطرف الآخر يُحرّف التاريخ لتحقيق مصالحه الخاصة والقضاء على مصالح الآخر، ولتأييد ادعائه بأحقيته بالمدينة، وبطبيعة الحال فإن كل طرف وجد المؤيدين لرأيه، وأغلبهم من ذات القومية، والمعارضين، وأغلبهم من القومية الأخرى.\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nأظهرت بعض التنقيبات الأثرية وجود بعض الأواني الخزفية في مدينة داود، الواقعة ضمن حدود القدس حاليًا، والتي تعود لحوالي الألفية الرابعة قبل الميلاد، أي منذ العصر النحاسي، وأظهرت اكتشافات أخرى وجود مستعمرة بشرية قامت خلال أوائل العصر البرونزي (ما بين عاميّ 3000 و2800 ق.م تقريبًا)، ويقول بعض المؤرخين أن من أسسها هم الكنعانيون الذين سكنوا فلسطين في الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وخلال هذه الفترة قدم إليها العرب الساميون في هجرتين كبيرتين: الأولى في بداية الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، والثانية في بداية الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، بينما يقول آخرون، مثل عالمة الآثار البريطانية كاتلين كينيون، أن القدس تأسست على يد قوم ساميين شماليين غربيين حوالي سنة 2600 قبل الميلاد. ورد أول ذكر لتجمع سكاني في موقع القدس في رسائل اللعنة الفرعونية من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد، ويُذكر موقع القدس فيها باسم أشمام كأحد تجمعات العدو الذي يجب لعنه كي لا يضر بالجيوش المصرية.\nتنص التوراة على أن المدينة تأسست على يد سام بن نوح، وعابر حفيد سام، من أسلاف النبي إبراهيم (وهو أبو الأنبياء جميعا وجدهم)، وسكنها في ذلك الوقت شعب يُعرف بشعب اليبوسيين، فسُميت المدينة «يبوس» تيمنًا بسكانها. ازدهرت المدينة في عهد ملكي صادق، وهو أحد ملوك اليبوسيين خلال فترة بعثة إبراهيم، واستمر الوضع كما هو إلى حين عهد يشوع، عندما دخلت المدينة في نطاق الأراضي الخاضعة لبني بنيامين، يشوع 28/18] إلا أنها استمرت مأهولة باليبوسيين بعد أن لم يتمكن بنو بنيامين من طردهم. سيطر الملك والنبي داود على المدينة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، بعد أن احتلها من اليبوسيين، وجعل منها عاصمة لمملكته. أظهرت أعمال التنقيب مؤخرًا وجود أساسات حجرية ضخمة في وسط القدس، قال الإسرائيليون بأنها بقايا هيكل داود، وقد توقفت أعمال التنقيب بعد أن صرّح الخبراء باعتقادهم هذا، إلى حين أن يتم التصديق على هذا الأمر من قبل مفسري التوراة.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nتنص المخطوطات العبرانية على أن النبي داود دام حكمه لمملكة إسرائيل 40 عامًا، وبالتحديد حتى سنة 970 ق.م، وبعد وفاته خلفه ولده سليمان الذي حكم طيلة 33 عامًا، وفي عهده تمّ تشييد هيكل المدينة على جبل موريا، بالإضافة إلى هيكل سليمان الشهير، الذي يلعب دورًا مهمًا عند اليهود، كونه يمثل المستودع الذي حُفظ فيه تابوت العهد وفقًا للمعتقد اليهودي. أصبحت القدس تُسمى بالمدينة المقدسة في عام 975 ق.م، وشكّلت عاصمة لمملكة إسرائيل الموحدة، وبعد وفاة سليمان انقسمت المملكة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي وذلك بعد تمرد الأسباط العبرية الشمالية بسبط يهوذا الجنوبي الذي كان آل داود ينتمون إليه. سُمي القسم الجنوبي بمملكة يهوذا في الجنوب، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة لها تحت قيادة رحبعام بن سليمان. وفي سنة 587 ق.م، احتل الملك البابلي «نبوخذ نصّر الثاني» مدينة القدس بعد أن هزم آخر ملوك اليهود «صدقيا بن يوشيا»، ونقل من بقي فيها من اليهود أسرى إلى بابل بمن فيهم الملك صدقيا نفسه، وعاث في المدينة دمارًا وخرابًا وأقدم على تدمير هيكل سليمان، مما أنهى الفترة التي يُطلق عليها المؤرخون تسمية «عهد الهيكل الأول».\n\nبعد 50 سنة من السبي إلى بابل، سمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن أراد من أسرى اليهود في بابل بالعودة إلى القدس وإعادة بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود إلى القدس وشرعوا ببناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنة 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الأول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه. وحوالي سنة 445 ق.م، أصدر الملك الفارسي «أرتحشستا الأول» مرسومًا سمح فيه لسكان المدينة بإعادة بناء أسوارها، واستمرت المدينة عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا طيلة العقود التي تلت. فقدت الإمبراطورية الفارسية فلسطين بما فيها القدس لصالح القائد والملك المقدوني، الإسكندر الأكبر، عام 333 ق.م، وبعد وفاته استمر خلفاؤه المقدونيون البطالمة في حكم المدينة، واستولى عليها في العام نفسه بطليموس الأول وضمها مع فلسطين إلى مملكته في مصر عام 323 ق.م. ثم في عام 198 ق.م، خسر بطليموس الخامس القدس ومملكة يهوذا لصالح السلوقيين في سوريا، بقيادة أنطيوخوس الثالث الكبير. حاول الإغريق أن يطبعوا المدينة بطابعهم الخاص ويجعلوا منها مدينة هيلينية تقليدية، لكن هذه المحاولة باءت بالفشل سنة 168 ق.م، عندما قام المكابيين بثورة على الحاكم أنطيوخوس الرابع، تحت قيادة كبير الكهنة «متياس» وأبنائه الخمسة، ونجحوا بتأسيس المملكة الحشمونائيمية وعاصمتها القدس سنة 152 ق.م. استولى قائد الجيش الروماني «پومپيوس الكبير»، على القدس في عام 63 ق.م بعد أن استغل صراعًا على سدّة المُلك بين الملوك الحشمونائيمية، وبهذا ضُمت القدس إلى الجمهورية الرومانية.\n\nالحروب اليهودية الرومانية\nأقدم الرومان على تنصيب حيرود الأول ملكًا على اليهود ليضمنوا سيطرتهم وتحكمهم بمملكة يهوذا، فكرّس حيرود عهده لتجميل المدينة وتطوير مرافقها، فبنى عددًا من الأسوار والقصور والأبراج والقلاع، وقام بتوسيع المعبد حتى تضاعف حجم المنطقة حيث يقع. وبعد وفاة حيرود الأول في السنة السادسة قبل الميلاد، خلفه حيرود الثاني في حكم القدس من عام 4 قبل الميلاد حتى 6 بعده وعندها أخضع الرومان مملكة يهوذا للحكم الروماني المباشر نتيجة لعدم ثقة الحكومة بحيرود، فأصبحت تُعرف بمقاطعة اليهودية، على الرغم من أن خلفاء حيرود الأول، المتحدرين من أغريباس الثاني، استمروا بحكم المناطق المجاورة بوصفهم ملوك تابعين لروما حتى سنة 96 ميلادية.\nشهد الحكم الروماني المباشر للقدس حوادث كثيرة، أولها الثورة اليهودية الكبرى، التي استمرت من سنة 66 إلى سنة 70م، حيث قام اليهود في القدس بأعمال شغب وعصيان مدني قمعها الحاكم الروماني «تيطس» بالقوة فأحرق المدينة وأسر كثيراً من اليهود ودُمّر المعبد للمرة الثانية، وعادت الأمور إلى طبيعتها في ظل الاحتلال الروماني للمدينة المقدسة. ثم عاود اليهود التمرد وإعلان العصيان مرتين في عاميّ 115 و132م، والمرة الأخيرة عُرفت بثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، تيمنًا بقائد العصيان، وخلالها تمكن اليهود بالفعل من السيطرة على المدينة، وأعلنوها عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا مجددًا، إلا أن الإمبراطور الروماني «هادريان» تعامل مع الثوّار بعنف وأسفر ذلك عن تدمير القدس للمرة الثانية، وأخرج اليهود المقيمين فيها ولم يبق إلا المسيحيين، ومن شدّة نقمة الإمبراطور على اليهود، أصدر مرسومًا بجعل المدينة ذات طابع روماني فتم تغيير اسمها إلى «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» واشترط ألا يسكنها يهودي، بل أقدم على تغيير اسم مقاطعة اليهودية بكاملها وجعله «مقاطعة سوريا الفلسطينية» (باللاتينية: Syria Palaestina) تيمنًا بالفلستينيون الذين سكنوا الساحل الجنوبي الكنعانيون.\n\nخضعت المدينة لسيطرة الرومان ثم الروم البيزنطيين خلال القرون الخمسة التي تلت ثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، وبعد أن نقل الإمبراطور الروماني قسطنطين الأول عاصمة الإمبراطورية الرومانية من روما إلى بيزنطية، وأعلن المسيحية ديانة رسمية للدولة، أمر بتشييد عدد من المعالم المسيحية بالقدس، فبنيت كنيسة القيامة عام 326م، فكانت تلك نقطة تحول بالنسبة للمسيحيين في المدينة، حيث لم يعودوا مضطهدين، واستطاعوا ممارسة شعائرهم الدينية بحريّة. أصبحت القدس مركزًا لبطريركية من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، وهي إلى جانب القدس: الإسكندرية وروما والقسطنطينية وأنطاكية، بعد أن تقرر إنشائها في مجمع نيقية. استمرت القدس بالنمو والاتساع منذ أن انتهى عهد الهيكل الثاني بعد تدمير الأخير، حيث بلغت مساحتها كيلومترين مربعين (0.8 أميال مربعة.) ووصل عدد سكانها إلى حوالي 200,000 نسمة. استمر حظر دخول اليهود إلى القدس طيلة عهد قسطنطين الأول حتى القرن السابع الميلادي.\n\nحروب الروم والفرس\nانقسمت الإمبراطورية الرومانية عام 395م إلى قسمين متناحرين: الإمبراطورية الغربية وعاصمتها روما، والإمبراطورية الشرقية أو البيزنطية وعاصمتها القسطنطينية، وخضعت القدس مع باقي بلاد الشام إلى الإمبراطورية الأخيرة. شجع الانقسام الروماني الفرس على الإغارة على القدس، فأمر شاه الإمبراطورية الساسانية، كسرى الثاني، قائدا جيوشه «شهربراز» و«شاهين»، بالسير إلى سوريا واستخلاص القدس من أيدي الروم، ففعلا ما طُلب منهما ونجحا في احتلالها، خصوصًا بعد أن ساعدهم اليهود في فلسطين، الذين كانوا ناقمين على البيزنطيين.\nفتح الفرس المدينة في سنة 614م، بعد حصار استمر 21 يومًا. تنص السجلات البيزنطية أن الفرس واليهود ذبحوا آلاف المسيحيين من سكان القدس، وما زال هذا الأمر موضع جدال بين المؤرخين، حيث قال البعض بصحته ونفاه البعض الآخر. استمرت المدينة خاضعة للفرس طيلة 15 سنة، إلى أن استطاع الروم استعادتها سنة 629م تحت قيادة الإمبراطور هرقل، وظلت بأيديهم حتى الفتح الإسلامي عام 636م.\nيؤمن المسلمون أنه خلال هذه الفترة، وبالتحديد في عام 621م تقريبًا، شهدت القدس زيارة النبي محمد، حيث أسرى به الملاك جبريل ليلاً من المسجد الحرام إلى المسجد الأقصى ثم صعد إلى السماوات العلى حيث رأى الأنبياء والرسل السابقين وعاد بعد أن خاطب الله الذي علّمه عدد الصلوات المفروضة على الإنسان، وبهذا الحدث، أصبحت القدس ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي\nأصبحت القدس مدينة مقدسة بالنسبة للمسلمين بعد حادثة الإسراء والمعراج، وبعد أن فُرضت الصلاة على المسلمين، أصبحوا يتوجهون أثناء إقامتها نحو المدينة، وبعد حوالي 16 شهرًا، عاد المسلمون ليتوجهوا في صلاتهم نحو مكة بدلاً من القدس، بسبب كثرة تعيير اليهود للنبي محمد وللمسلمين بسبب استقبالهم لقبلة اليهود، ولأسباب أخرى.\n\nفي عهد عمر بن الخطاب والفتوحات الإسلامية، أُرسل عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح لفتح فلسطين عامة ونشر الدعوة الإسلامية فيها، لكن القدس عصيت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعة أسوارها، حيث اعتصم أهلها داخل الأسوار. وعندما طال حصار المسلمين لها، طلب رئيس البطاركة والأساقفة، المدعو «صفرونيوس»، طلب منهم أن لا يسلم القدس إلا للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب بشخصه. فأرسل عمرو بن العاص يخبر عمر في المدينة بما طلبه صفرونيوس رئيس الأساقفة المسيحيين في القدس فاستشار الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب أصحابه فكان أول من تكلم عثمان بن عفان فقال: «أقم ولا تسر إليهم فإذا رأوا أنك بأمرهم مستخفن ولقتالهم مستحقر فلا يلبثون إلا اليسير حتى ينزلوا على الصغار ويعطوا الجزية». وقال علي بن أبي طالب: «إني أرى أنك إن سرت إليهم فتح الله هذه المدينة على يديك وكان في مسيرك الأجر العظيم». ففرح عمر بن الخطاب بمشورة علي فقال: «لقد أحسن عثمان النظر في المكيدة للعدو وأحسن علي المشورة للمسلمين فجزاهما الله خيراً ولست آخذاً إلا بمشورة علي فما عرفناه إلا محمود المشورة ميمون الغرة».\nفقصد عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه ومعهما ناقة إلى بيت المقدس في رحلة شاقة. وما أن وصلا مشارف القدس حتى أطل عليهما صفرونيوس والبطاركة وسألوا من هذين الرجلين فقال المسلمون إنه عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه، فسأل أيهما عمر فقيل ذاك الواقف على قدميه إذ كان خادمه ممتطيا الناقة فذهلوا بهذا لأنه مذكور في كتبهم، فكان الفتح العمري لبيت المقدس. كتب عمر مع المسيحيين وثيقةً عُرفت باسم «العهدة العمرية» وهي وثيقة منحتهم الحرية الدينية مقابل الجزية، وتعهد بالحفاظ على ممتلكاتهم ومقدساتهم، وعرض صفرونيوس على عمر بن الخطاب أن يؤدي الصلاة في كنيسة القيامة بعد أن حان موعدها أثناء زيارته لها، فخرج من الكنيسة وصلى على مبعدة منها وعاد. ولمّا سأله البطريرك صفرونيوس عن السبب أجابه أنه يخاف من أن يتخذ المسلمون من فعله ذريعة فيما بعد للسيطرة على الكنيسة فيقولون من بعده «ها هنا صلّى عمر» وبالتالي يحولون الكنيسة إلى مسجد للمسلمين. سمح المسلمون لليهود بالرجوع للسكن في المدينة بعد فتحها، وطبقوا عليهم ما طبقوه على المسيحيين من حماية لمقدساتهم مقابل الجزية. أقام المسلمون مسجدًا في الموقع الذي صلّى به عمر بن الخطاب، بالقرب من مدخل كنيسة القيامة اليوم، وقال الأسقف الغالي «أركولف» الذي عاش في القدس من سنة 679 حتى سنة 688، أن مسجد عمر كان مبنًى خشبيًا مربع الشكل بُني على أنقاض بعض المباني والمنشآت، وكان يتسع لحوالي 3,000 مصل.\n\nقام عمر بن الخطاب بعد فتح المدينة بالبحث عن مكان المسجد الأقصى المذكور في القرآن والصخرة المقدسة واضعًا نصب عينيه الرواية التي سمعها من محمد ليلة الإسراء، وسأل الصحابة وكعب الأحبار، وهو من اليهود الذين أسلموا، والبطريرك صفرنيوس، وكان عمر بن الخطاب يراجع المرافقين له حين يدلونه على مكان لا يجد أوصافه تنطبق على ما لديه قائلاً: «لقد وصف لي رسول الله صلّى الله عليه وسلم المسجد بصفة ما هي عليه هذه». وقد عثر الخليفة على مكان المسجد الأقصى والصخرة المقدسة في وقت قصير، وكان المكان مطموراً بالأتربة التي تكاد تخفي معالمه. وأمر عمر بن الخطاب بإقامة مسجد موضع المسجد الأول، وإقامة ظلة من الخشب فوق الصخرة المقدسة، وعندما جاء الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة فوق الصخرة المقدسة عام 691، ثم بنى الخليفة الوليد بن عبد الملك الجامع القبلي عام 709. يقول المؤرخ من القرن العاشر، محمد بن أحمد شمس الدين المقدسي، أن عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة وجعل منها ذهبية كي تطغى على قبب الكنائس المنتشرة في القدس، ولتصبح معلمًا بارزًا يلفت نظر الزائر أوّل ما يراها. اهتم الأمويون والعباسيون بالمدينة فشهدت نهضة علمية في مختلف الميادين، لكن شهرتها سرعان ما تضعضعت بسبب عدم الاستقرار الذي شهدته الدولة العباسية وانقسامها إلى دويلات عديدة.\n\nعهد الصليبيين، الأيوبيين، والمماليك\nأدّى تفكك الدولة العباسية إلى دويلات متناحرة إلى ضعف العمل بالشريعة الإسلامية من قبل بعض الحكّام، فلقي المسيحيون كثيرًا من الاضطهاد، وهُدمت كنيسة القيامة في القدس خلال عهد الخليفة الفاطمي، أبو علي منصور الحاكم بأمر الله، وتعرّضت حياة الحجاج الأوروبيين للخطر. وعندما سقطت القدس بقبضة الأتراك السلاجقة سنة 1076، ازدادت الحالة سوءًا وكثر التعدي على الحجاج الأوروبيين بشكل خاص بسبب ما كانوا يحملونه معهم من النفائس والأموال، فكانت تلك إحدى الأسباب التي أدّت لنشوب الحروب الصليبية. انطلق الصليبيون في حملتهم الأولى سنة 1095 متوجهين إلى مدينة القدس، فوصلوها في سنة 1099 وضربوا الحصار عليها فسقطت في أيديهم بعد شهر من الحصار، وقتل الصليبيون فور دخولهم القدس قرابة 70 ألفًا من المسلمين واليهود وانتهكوا مقدساتهم، وقامت في القدس منذ ذلك التاريخ مملكة لاتينية تُحكم من قبل ملك كاثوليكي فرض الشعائر الكاثوليكية على المسيحيين الأرثوذكس مما أثار غضبهم.\n\nاستطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد القدس من الصليبيين عام 1187 بعد معركة حطين، وعامل أهلها معاملة طيبة، وأزال الصليب عن قبة الصخرة، ودعا اليهود والمسلمين ليعودوا إلى المدينة، واهتم بعمارتها وتحصينها. ولكن الصليبيين نجحوا في السيطرة على المدينة بعد وفاة صلاح الدين في عهد الإمبراطور فريدريش الأول بربروسا إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة، وكانت القدس في هذه الفترة قد ضعف شأنها وأفل نجمها وأصبحت مجرّد قرية عاديّة نظرًا لتراجع أهميتها الإستراتيجية، خصوصًا بسبب انهماك أولاد صلاح الدين بالنزاع فيما بينهم، وعدم تركيزهم على محاربة الصليبيين. ظلت القدس بأيدي الصليبيين 11 عامًا إلى أن استردها نهائياً الملك الصالح نجم الدين أيوب عام 1244.\nتعرضت المدينة لغزو التتار الخوارزميين عام 1244، الذين قضوا على القسم الأعظم من سكانها المسيحيين وطردوا اليهود منهم. هُزم التتار على يد المماليك بقيادة سيف الدين قطز والظاهر بيبرس في معركة عين جالوت عام 1259، وضمت فلسطين بما فيها القدس إلى السلطنة المملوكية التي حكمت مصر والشام بعد الدولة الأيوبية حتى عام 1517. وخلال هذه الفترة تعرّضت المدينة والمنطقة ككل لسلسلة من الزلازل وتفشّى فيها وباء الطاعون الأسود.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت جيوش العثمانيين فلسطين بقيادة السلطان سليم الأول بعد معركة مرج دابق في سنة 1517، وأصبحت القدس مدينة تابعة للدولة العثمانية طيلة 400 سنة حتى سقوطها بيد قوّات الحلفاء في الحرب العالمية الأولى سنة 1917. تمتعت القدس بعهد من الرخاء والازدهار خلال عهد السلطان سليمان الأول \"القانوني\"، خليفة سليم الأول، حيث أعاد الأخير بناء أسوار المدينة وقبة الصخرة. استمرت القدس خلال معظم العهد العثماني مجرّد مدينة محلّية عادية ولم يعلوا شأنها التجاري أو الثقافي بشكل يُذكر، لكنها بقيت من ضمن المدن العثمانية المهمة نظرًا لمكانتها الدينية. تطوّرت الحياة المقدسيّة بشكل ملحوظ خلال القرن التاسع عشر بعد أن أنشأت السلطات العثمانية عدد من المرافق الحديثة لتسهيل حياة الناس، فافتتح مركز للبريد وأنشأت خطوط سير نظامية مخصصة لمركبات الجياد العمومية، وأُنيرت الشوارع بالمصابيح الزيتيّة، وفي أواسط القرن سالف الذكر أنشأ العثمانيون أوّل طريق معبّدة بين القدس ويافا، وبحلول عام 1892، كانت المدينة موصولة بغيرها من المدن الشاميّة والحجازية بسكة حديدية.\nخلال الفترة الممتدة من عام 1831 حتى عام 1840، أصبحت فلسطين جزءًا من الدولة المصرية التي أقامها محمد علي باشا، وخلال هذا العهد أخذت الإرساليات والقنصليات الأجنبية تضع موطئ قدم لها في المدينة. وفي سنة 1836، سمح إبراهيم باشا بن محمد علي، سمح لليهود أن يعيدوا إنشاء أربعة معابد رئيسيّة، ومن ضمنها كنيس الخراب. ثار الشوام على الحكم المصري بعد أن استقر في البلاد لأسباب مختلفة منها زيادة الضرائب بمقدار لم يعهده الناس أيام العثمانيين والتجنيد الإجباري في الجيش المصري، وكان من ضمن هذه الثورات ثورة قامت في سنة 1834 بفلسطين بقيادة قاسم الأحمد، الذي قاد جيشًا من الثوّار من مدينة نابلس تعاونه عشائر بلدة أبو غوش، وهاجم القدس ودخلها بتاريخ 31 مايو 1834، لكن الجيش المصري استطاع أن يرد الثوّار على أعقابهم في الشهر التالي.\nعادت القدس إلى الحكم العثماني بعد هزيمة المصريين أمام الجيوش الحليفة العثمانية والأوروبية سنة 1840، إلا أن كثيرًا من المصريين بقي واستقر بالمدينة، وفي نفس الفترة قدمت وفود من اليهود والمسلمين المغاربة، من مدينة الجزائر وغيرها من مدن المغرب العربي، واستقرت في القدس. أخذت القوى العظمى في العالم تتدخل في الشؤون الداخلية العثمانية بشكل متزايد خلال عقد الأربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بحجة حماية الأقليات الدينية في الدولة العثمانية، وقد لعب القناصلة في القدس دورًا كبيرًا في هذه المسألة. أفاد القنصل البروسي بالقدس أن عدد سكان المدينة في سنة 1845 وصل إلى 16,410 نسمة، منهم 7,120 يهودي، 5,000 مسلم، 3,390 مسيحي، 800 جندي تركي، و100 شخص أوروبي. ارتفعت نسبة الحجاج المسيحيين في المدينة خلال العهد العثماني، الأمر الذي كان يجعل جمهرة المسيحيين بالقدس تتضاعف في حجمها خلال موسم الفصح.\n\nأخذت المنازل تظهر خارج أسوار القدس خلال عقد الستينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بعد أن ازداد عدد سكان المدينة بفعل المهاجرين، ولإقامة منشآت أكثر صحيّة مخصصة لاستضافة الحجاج المسيحيين، خصوصًا وأن كثيرًا منهم كان يشتكي من الاكتظاظ السكاني داخل المدينة ومن رداءة نظام الصرف الصحي. ومن المنشآت المهمة التي برزت خلال هذه الفترة، المجمّع الروسي سنة 1860، الذي خُصص لاستقبال وإيواء الحجاج الروس الأرثوذكس. قدّرت إحدى إحصائيات إرسالية أمريكية عدد سكان القدس سنة 1867 «بأكثر من» 15,000 نسمة، 6,000 منهم مسلمين، وما بين 4,000 إلى 5,000 منهم يهود، كذلك تبيّن أن عدد الحجاج الروس كان يتراوح بين 5,000 إلى 6,000 حاج كل عام. أنشأت الدولة العثمانية عام 1880 متصرفية القدس، وأزيل الحائط القديم للمدينة عام 1898 لتسهيل دخول القيصر الألماني ڤيلهلم الثاني وحاشيته أثناء زيارته للقدس. وظلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني حتى هزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني وحرب سنة 1948\nسقطت القدس بيد الجيش البريطاني بقيادة الفريق أول إدموند ألنبي في سنة 1917، بعد أن تقهقر الجيش العثماني مهزومًا أمامهم، وفي سنة 1922 منحت عصبة الأمم بريطانيا حق الانتداب على فلسطين وإمارة شرق الأردن والعراق، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة فلسطين تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nدخلت المدينة في عهد جديد كان من أبرز سماته زيادة أعداد المهاجرين اليهود إليها خاصة بعد وعد بلفور الذي أصدرته الحكومة البريطانية، وقد أظهرت بعض إحصائيات تلك الفترة أن عدد سكان المدينة ارتفع من 52,000 نسمة عام 1922 إلى 165,000 نسمة عام 1948 بفعل هجرة اليهود. أدّى ازدياد عدد اليهود في فلسطين عمومًا والقدس خصوصًا، وشرائهم للأراضي ومساعدة البريطانيين لهم، أدّى إلى استياء المقدسيين من مسلمين ومسيحيين، فقامت أعمال شغب في سنتيّ 1920 و1929، وعُرفت الأخيرة بثورة البراق، قُتل خلالها عدد من اليهود. عمل البريطانيون على إخماد هذه الثورات، وساهموا في جعل اليهود يستقرون في المدينة عن طريق بنائهم لأحياء سكنيّة كاملة في شمال وغرب المدينة، وإنشائهم لعدد من مؤسسات التعليم العالي، مثل الجامعة العبرية.\nأحيلت قضية القدس إلى الأمم المتحدة بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية، فأصدرت الهيئة الدولية قرارها في 29 نوفمبر سنة 1947 بتدويل القدس تحت رعايتها وإشرافها. وجاء في القرار أنه سوف يُطبّق طيلة 10 سنوات، ويشمل مدينة بيت لحم، وأنه بعد هذه الفترة سيتم إجراء استفتاء عام لتحديد نظام الحكم الذي يرغب أغلبية سكان المدينة بتطبيقه عليهم. إلا أن تطبيق هذا القرار لم يُكتب له أن يتم، فبعد أن أعلنت بريطانيا في عام 1948 إنهاء الانتداب في فلسطين وسحب قواتها، استغلت العصابات اليهودية حالة الفراغ السياسي والعسكري وأعلنت قيام الدولة الإسرائيلية، فثار العرب عمومًا والفلسطينيون خصوصًا وأعلنوا الحرب على إسرائيل، فهوجمت المدينة من قبل الجيش العربي والثوّار الفلسطينيين، وقُتل عدد من الإسرائيليين في هذا الهجوم وتم أسر البعض الآخر. كذلك هاجم القنّاصة العرب القسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nالتقسيم والضم\nكان من نتائج حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب والإسرائيليين أن قُسمت القدس إلى شطرين: الجزء الغربي الخاضع لإسرائيل، والجزء الشرقي الخاضع للأردن. وفي شهر نوفمبر من نفس السنة، أقيمت منطقة عازلة بين الجزئين، حيث قابل قائد القوّات الإسرائيلية في القدس، موشيه دايان، نظيره الأردني عبد الله التل في إحدى منازل حيّ مصرارة بالقدس، وقاما بتعليم الحدود الفاصلة بين شطريّ المدينة، حيث لوّنت حصة إسرائيل باللون الأحمر وحصة الأردن باللون الأخضر. نجم هذا اللقاء عن رسم خريطة لحدود غير رسميّة بين الطرفين المتحاربين، لكنها أخذت بعين الاعتبار عند توقيع اتفاقية الهدنة بين إسرائيل ولبنان ومصر والأردن وسوريا سنة 1949، والتي اتفقت فيها تلك الدول على وقف إطلاق النار والتزام الإسرائيليين بالبقاء ضمن هذه الحدود لحين إيجاد حل سلمي للنزاع. كذلك نصّت هذه الاتفاقية على تقسيم القدس على أن يبقى جبل المشارف في يد إسرائيل على الرغم من أنه يقع في القسم الشرقي، بوصفه جيب داخلي. بناءً على هذا، أقيمت الحواجز الاسمنتيّة والأسلاك الشائكة في وسط المدينة ومرّت بالقرب من باب الخليل في الجانب الغربي من البلدة القديمة، وأُنشأت نقطة عبور شمال الأخيرة عُرفت بمعبر ماندلباوم. استمرت بعض المناوشات العسكرية بين الأردن وإسرائيل بين الحين والآخر على الرغم من اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار، إلا أنها لم تكن ذات أهمية تُذكر غالبًا. كان داود بن گوريون، رئيس وزراء إسرائيل، قد أعلن في 3 ديسمبر 1948 أن القدس الغربية عاصمة للدولة الإسرائيلية الوليدة، وفي سنة 1950 أعلن الأردن رسميًا خضوع القدس الشرقية للسيادة الأردنية، وقد اعترفت المملكة المتحدة وباكستان بهذا الضم، فيما لم تعترف دول أخرى بهذا الأمر بحجة أن القدس الشرقية خضعت للأردن بحكم الأمر الواقع وليس بشكل رسمي، ويشكك البعض إن كانت باكستان قد اعترفت بضم الأردن للقدس الشرقية حتى.\nخضعت أغلبية المواقع المقدسة في القدس للسيادة الأردنية، بما أن أغلبها يقع في القسم الشرقي من المدينة، فأجرت الحكومة الأردنية عدد من الإصلاحات والترميمات لقبة الصخرة والمسجد الأقصى، وسمحت للمسيحيين الأجانب بزيارة المقدسات المسيحية شرط خضوعهم للرقابة، أما اليهود فلم يُسمح لهم بدخول المدينة لاعتبارات سياسية، حيث كانت الحكومة تخشى أن يعمل بعضهم في الجاسوسية لصالح إسرائيل.\n\nخاض العرب وإسرائيل حربًا أخرى في سنة 1967 انتصرت فيها الأخيرة، وقامت بالسيطرة على القدس الشرقية، وكان من نتيجة ذلك أن عاد اليهود ليدخلوا دون أي قيود إلى أماكنهم المقدسة، كذلك أزيلت القيود المفروضة على المسيحيين الغربيين، أما المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة فاستمرا خاضعين للأوقاف الإسلامية. قام الإسرائيليون بهدم حارة المغاربة بعد دخولهم المدينة، بما أنها كانت تواجه حائط البراق الذي يتعبّد اليهود عنده، ولكي يجعلوا من الموقع ساحة لرفع الصلاة اليهودية. قامت إسرائيل بتوسيع حدود المدينة بعد انتهاء الحرب وذلك عبر بناء عدد من الأحياء السكنية والمستعمرات اليهودية شرق الخط الأخضر، وقد أقدمت إسرائيل منذ سنة 1967 بمحاولات عديدة تهدف إلى تهويد المناطق التي احتلتها بعد الحرب، وذلك عبر وسائل عديدة، منها التركيز الإعلامي على أهمية المواقع الأثرية العبرانية في المدينة.\nقوبل ضم إسرائيل للقدس الشرقية بالاستنكار الدولي، وبعد أن أصدرت إسرائيل قانون أساس اعتبرت فيه القدس الموحدة عاصمة أبدية للبلاد، أصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 الذي نص على أن إسرائيل خرقت قانونًا دوليًا وطالب جميع الدول الأعضاء بسحب ما تبقى من سفاراتها من القدس. ما زالت مسألة القدس تُشكل قضية محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي، خصوصًا مع إقرار الحكومة الإسرائيلية بناء وحدات استيطانية جديدة على الدوام في حارات وأحياء في البلدة القديمة يسكنها مسلمون وتحوي مقدسات إسلامية، في سبيل رفع عدد اليهود في القدس الشرقية، إلا أن علماء الدين المسلمون وعدد من المؤرخين العرب يزعمون أن اليهود ليس لهم أي حق في المدينة لأسباب متنوعة، منها أن حائط البراق الذي بُني منذ حوالي 2,500 سنة كان جزءًا من مسجد سليمان الذي تسميه اليهود هيكل سليمان. طالب الفلسطينيون وما زالوا بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة للدولة الفلسطينية المستقبلية، لذا لطالما كانت حدود المدينة موضع نقاش وجدال في المحادثات الثنائية بين السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل. أقام بعض الأشخاص من الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين الراغبين بالسلام نصبًا تذكاريًا مصنوع من الأسلحة القديمة البالية، يواجه سور القدس القديم ونقشوا عليه عبارات بالعربية والعبرية مقتبسة من سفر أشعياء.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينة القدس في وسط فلسطين تقريبًا شرق البحر المتوسط، على رعن هضبة من هضاب جبال الخليل، التي تضم عددًا من الجبال بدورها، وهي: جبل الزيتون أو جبل الطور شرق المدينة، جبل المشارف ويقع إلى الشمال الغربي للمدينة، ويُقال له أيضًا «جبل المشهد»، وقد أقيمت فوقه في سنة 1925 الجامعة العبرية، ومستشفى هداسا الجامعي في سنة 1939، جبل صهيون ويقع إلى الجنوب الغربي وتكوّن البلدة القديمة جزءًا كبيرًا منه وتمر أسوارها من فوقه، جبل المكبر الذي سُمي بهذا الاسم عندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس وكبّر على متنه، بالإضافة إلى جبل النبي صموئيل، وجبل أبو غنيم. ترتفع القدس عن سطح البحر المتوسط نحو 750 مترًا (2,460 قدمًا)، وعن سطح البحر الميت نحو 1150 مترًا (3,770 قدمًا). بالإضافة إلى جبال القدس فإن هناك ثلاثة أودية تحيط بها وهي: وادي سلوان أو وادي جهنم واسمه القديم «وادي قدرون»، الوادي أو الواد، وادي الجوز، ونبع أم الدرج.\nكانت القدس محاطة بغابات من أشجار الجوز الزيتون الصنوبر منذ القدم، إلا أن الحروب والاستغلال البشري كان لها وقعٌ مدمّر عليها، فاختفت معظم هذه الغابات، وقد أثّر ذلك على تماسك التربة، فاضطر المزارعون إلى تشييد المدرّجات الزراعية على عدد من السفوح لمنع تآكلها وانجراف تربتها. شكّل شح المياه مشكلة للمقدسيين منذ العهود الأولى لاستيطان المدينة، فقاموا بتشييد عدد من القناطر والقنوات لجرّ مياه الأنهار، إضافة لعدد من البرك والآبار لجمع ماء الأمطار، وما زال البعض منها موجودًا بالبلدة القديمة. ومن أبرز آبار المدينة بئر أيوب، نسبة إلى النبي أيوب، وهذه البئر هي التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن بسورة ص، حيث جاء: ﴿ارْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ﴾، كذلك من أبرز بركها أو عيونها، العين المعروفة بعين سلوان، وهي إحدى العيون الجارية التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن أيضًا في سورة الرحمن: ﴿فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ﴾. قال مجير الدين الحنبلي عن القدس في نهاية القرن التاسع سنة 900 هـ: \n\nتبعد القدس نحو 60 كيلومترًا (37 ميلاً) عن البحر المتوسط، وحوالي 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) عن البحر الميت، و250 كيلومتر (155 ميلاً) عن البحر الأحمر، وتبعد عن عمّان 88 كيلومتر (55 ميلاً)، وعن بيروت 388 كيلومتر (241 ميلاً)، وعن دمشق 290 كيلومتر (180 ميلاً). أما المدن والبلدات المجاورة للقدس فتشمل: بيت لحم وبيت جالا جنوبًا، أبو ديس ومستوطنة معاليه أدوميم شرقًا، مڤاسرت صهيون غربًا، ورام الله ومستوطنة گفعات زئيف شمالاً.\n\nمناطق القدس\nتمتد أراضي بلدية القدس اليوم لتشمل مناطق شاسعة كانت في السابق قرى أو ضواحي للمدينة، فتشمل حدود البلدية كل من: بيت حنينا، كفر عقب، شعفاط، التل الفرنسي، جبل المشارف، الشيخ جراح، وادي الجوز، جبل الزيتون، البلدة القديمة، سلوان، العيسوية، رأس العمود، أبو الطور، جبل المكبر، صور باهر، أم طوبا، جبل أبو غنيم، بيت صفافا والولجة، قائمة المدن والقرى في فلسطين التاريخية.\nمن جهة أخرى، أقامت إسرائيل العديد من المستوطنات، كما قامت بضم مستوطنات قديمة أخرى خارج حدود البلدية بعد احتلالها للقدس الشرقية عام 1967 وبنائها لجدار الفصل عام 2002، والذي عزل العديد من البلدات العربية عن القدس، كالعيزرية، أبو ديس، الرام، حزما، عناتا، السواحرة الشرقية، بيت إكسا، الشيخ سعد وقلنديا - حيث مطار القدس الدولي، والتي من المفترض أن تشكل الامتداد الطبيعي لتوسع الأحياء العربية في المدينة مستقبلاً. وهذه المستوطنات هي: مستوطنة عطروت، مستوطنة نيڤيه يعقوب، مستوطنة بيسغات زئيف، مستوطنة رامات أشكول، مستوطنة غيلو، مستوطنة هماطوس ومستوطنة ناليبوت مزراح.\nالقدس الغربية\nأقدمت إسرائيل بعد قيامها عام 1948، على تدمير معظم القرى الواقعة غرب القدس، من أهمها: المالحة، دير ياسين، عين كارم، لفتا، والقسطل. وأقامت مكانها العديد من المستوطنات التي أصبحت تشكل فيما بعد مناطق القدس الغربية، وهي: گفعات شاؤول، بيت هيكرم، جبل هرتزل، كريات هيوفيل، عميق زيفائيم، يمين موشيه، ربحاميا، نحلاؤوت، محانيه يهودا، مئة سيعاريم، روميما وگفعات رام.\n\nالحياة البرية والغابات\nيقع في محيط القدس عدة غابات ومناطق برية مثل وادي الغزال، تقع هذه المنطقة بوسط القدس بالقرب من حي «گفعات مردخاي» اليهودي،\nوهي أرض مكشوفة تبلغ مساحتها 260 دونمًا. أُطلق هذا الاسم على الوادي كون ما يُقارب من 17 غزالاً جبليًا تتخذ منه موطنًا ولا تستطيع مغادرته لإحاطة المدينة به من مختلف الجوانب. كان متعهدو العقارات والمقاولون قد خططوا لتحويل المنطقة إلى منطقة سكنية، لكن محبي الطبيعة وجمعية حماية البيئة في إسرائيل استطاعت إيقاف هذا الأمر، وإرغام السلطات المختصة على النظر في مسألة حماية الموقع.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز القدس بمناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط (تصنيف كوبن للمناخ: Csa)، مع صيف حار جاف، وشتاء مُعتدل البرودة رطب. تتساقط الثلوج عادةً مرة أو مرتين خلال الشتاء، على الرغم من أن المدينة تختبر تساقطًا كثيفًا للثلوج مرة كل ثلاث إلى أربع سنوات، في المتوسط، مع تراكم قصير العمر.\nيُعتبر يناير أبرد شهور السنة، بمتوسط درجة حرارة 9.1 درجة °مئوية (48.4 درجة °فهرنهايت)؛ يُعد شهري يوليو وأغسطس الأكثر سخونة، حيث يبلغ متوسط درجة الحرارة 24.2 درجة °مئوية (75.6 درجة °فهرنهايت)، وعادة ما تكون أشهر الصيف جافة. يبلغ متوسط هطول الأمطار السنوي حوالي 537 مليمترًا (21 إنشًا)، وذلك في الفترة الممتدة بين شهريّ أكتوبر ومايو، أما الأشهر الأخرى فينعدم فيها تساقط الأمطار غالبًا. تساقط الثلوج ليس شائعًا، لكن تساقط الثلوج بغزارة يعتبر نادرًا. تلقت القدس أكثر من 30 سم (12 بوصة) من الثلج في 13 ديسمبر 2013، والتي شلت المدينة تقريبًا. مع متوسط درجات حرارة في الصيف مماثلة للسواحل، فإن التأثير البحري من البحر الأبيض المتوسط قوي، لا سيما بالنظر إلى أن القدس تقع على خط عرض مشابه للصحاري الحارة غير البعيدة إلى الشرق.\nكانت أعلى درجة حرارة مُسجلة في القدس 44.4 درجة °مئوية (111.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 28 و30 أغسطس 1881، وكانت أدنى درجة حرارة مُسجلة −6.7 درجة °مئوية (19.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 25 يناير 1907.\nيأتي معظم تلوث الهواء في القدس من حركة مرور السيارات. لم يتم بناء العديد من الشوارع الرئيسية في القدس لاستيعاب هذا الحجم الكبير من حركة المرور، مما أدى إلى ازدحام حركة المرور والمزيد من انبعاثات أول أكسيد الكربون في الهواء. تُساهم انبعاثات المصانع بنسبة ضئيلة من تلوّث الهواء بالمدينة، إلا أنه يمكن لتلك الصادرة عن المصانع الواقعة على ساحل البحر المتوسط أن تتجه شرقًا ناحية القدس وتُشكل ضبخانًا فوقها.\n\nالقرى\nقرى القدس عديدة وكثيرة فقد اختلف التحاق بعض القرى لمدينة القدس وفقًا للتغيرات التاريخية التي مرت بها المدينة. كان آخر تغيير لحدود مدينة القدس الإدارية في يونيو سنة 1967 بموجب قرار أصدرته الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد احتلال الضفة الغربية من الأردن. نص هذا القرار على ضم 70,4 كيلومترات مربعة إلى منطقة البلدية المقدسية الإسرائيلية وفرض القانون الإسرائيلي عليها. كانت 6,4 كيلومترات مربعة من المساحة المضمومة تابعة للبلدية المقدسية الأردنية قبل حرب سنة 1967، أما الباقي فكان من أراضي بعض القرى المجاورة للقدس. أقدم الإسرائيليون على هدم عدد من القرى الفلسطينية وبناء قرىً ومستوطنات جديدة على أنقاضها، وقد سمحت الحكومة في وقت لاحق لبعض المهجرين من الفلسطينيين بالعودة إلى قراهم، فأقاموا بجانب المستوطنات قرىً جديدة. حاز سكان المنطقة المضمومة على مكانة «مقيم دائم» في إسرائيل، دون أن يحصلوا على المواطنة، أما القرى التي بقيت خارج حدود القدس الإدارية وسكانها، فيخضعون لسيطرة الحكم العسكري أو لسيطرة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. وكانت الحكومة الإسرائيلية قد أصدرت قانون أملاك الغائب عام 1950، الذي منح إسرائيل صفة الوصي على على أملاك الفلسطينيين الغائبين، وأعطاها الحق في الاستيلاء عليها وإدارتها. من القرى العربية التي كانت بجوار القدس من جانبها الغربي قبل حرب سنة 1948 لم تبق إلا ثلاثًا: أبو غوش (أكبرها)، عين رافة، وعين نقوبا. تعتبر هذه القرى الثلاثة اليوم تجمعات عربية إسرائيلية وسكانها ذوي جنسية إسرائيلية. ومن قرى القدس الأخرى: إشوع، البريج، بيت أم الميس، بيت عطاب، بيت محسير، جرش، خربة العمور، خربة اللوز، دير الشيخ، وغيرها.\n\nالتركيبة السكانيّة\nأشارت الإحصاءات الإسرائيلية الرسمية الصادرة نهاية عام 2000 إلى أنّ تعداد السكان في المدينة ارتفع بنسبة 2% من إجمالي السكان البالغ 646,3 ألف نسمة، بينهم 436,7 ألف يهودي بنسبة 67,6%، في حين بلغ عدد السكان العرب 209,5 آلاف عربي بنسبة 32.4%. وقد تبيّن في إحصائية أخرى من نفس السنة أن نسبة السكان من اليهود تتراجع تدريجيًا بينما نسبة العرب في ازدياد مطّرد، ويرجع ذلك إلى نسبة الولادات الأعلى عند العرب وإلى هجرة البعض من اليهود إلى مدن وبلدان أخرى. كذلك أفادت نفس الدراسة أن حوالي 9% من جمهرة البلدة القديمة البالغة 32,488 نسمة كانوا يهودًا. بلغت نسبة الكثافة السكانيّة بالمدينة في نهاية عام 2005 حوالي 5,750.4 نسمة في الكيلومتر المربّع (14,893.5 نسمة/ميل مربّع)، وفي نهاية سنة 2006 أظهرت إحصائية أعدّتها مؤسسة إسرائيلية للدراسات حول مدينة القدس إن عدد سكان القدس بلغ 733 ألف شخص بينهم 481 ألف يهودي و252 ألف فلسطيني يعيشون خصوصًا في الأحياء الشرقية من المدينة. وفي شهر ديسمبر من سنة 2007، وصل عدد سكان القدس إلى 747,600 نسمة، 64% منهم يهود و32% مسلمين و2% مسيحيين.\n\nيخوض الفلسطينيون والإسرائيليون حربًا ديمغرافيّة في القدس، حيث يسعى كل طرف إلى زيادة عدد السكان المنتمين إلى عرقيته ليضمن هيمنته على المدينة، وتعمل الحكومة الإسرائيلية - كما تقول الدكتورة سارة هيرشكوبيتس رئيسة قسم التخطيط الإستراتيجي في بلدية القدس - على ألا تتعدى نسبة العرب بالمدينة 28%. وتحاول الحكومة الإسرائيلية زيادة عدد اليهود في المدينة بطرق عدة، منها على سبيل المثال العمل على إحلال اليهود محلّ العرب الذين هدّمت منازلهم بحجّة البناء دون تصريح. وتشير إحصائيات بيت الشرق لعام 1999 في هذا الصدد إلى هدم أكثر من ألفيْ منزل منذ عام 1967، مما خلق ظروفاً صعبة للفلسطينيين حيث يسكن معظمهم في منازل مكتظة. ومن الوسائل الأخرى التي تتّخذها إسرائيل لإجبار المقدسيّين على الهجرة من القدس، عدم منحهم تصاريح بناء إلا فيما ندر، وتسهيل بناء المنازل لليهود المهاجرين. وفي سنة 2005، قدم المدينة 2,850 مهاجر يهودي جديد من الولايات المتحدة وفرنسا ومن بعض دول الاتحاد السوڤيتي السابق، وبنهاية السنة ذاتها تبيّن أن 16,000 من السكان غادر المدينة، إلا أن جمهرة المدينة ما زالت في ازدياد بفضل ارتفاع نسبة الإنجاب بين الأهالي العرب واليهود الحريدية. يصل معدل الخصوبة الكلي في القدس إلى 4.02، وهو أعلى من ذاك الخاص بتل أبيب (1.98) والمعدل الوطني حتى، الذي يصل إلى 2.90.\n\nبلغت الزيادة الصافية للسكان في سنة 2000، بعد حساب الولادات والوفيات والمهاجرين من وإلى المدينة، 12600 نسمة، كان نصيب اليهود منها 2900 نسمة، في حين بلغت الزيادة العربية 9700. وبهذا كانت نسبة نمو السكان اليهود في القدس هي 0.7% بينما كانت عند السكان العرب 4.7%. وفي سنة 2005 ازداد عدد السكان بحوالي 13,000 نسمة، أي قرابة 1.8%، وهي نسبة مشابهة لنسبة معدّل النمو السكاني في إسرائيل في ذلك العام، إلا أن ما يميزها هو التباين في التركيبة السكانيّة والعرقيّة، فقرابة 31% من الجمهرة اليهودية تألفت من أولاد دون سن الخامسة عشر، بالمقابل فإن هذه النسبة وصلت لحوالي 42% عند السكان العرب، ويتوافق ذلك مع الدراسات التي أظهرت تراجع عدد اليهود في القدس خلال العقود الأربع الماضية، واتجاه معظمهم إلى المدن الساحلية والضواحي.\nعادت نسبة اليهود الحريدية في المدينة إلى الارتفاع بحلول عام 2009، حيث تبيّن في إحدى الإحصائيات أن 59,900 تلميذ من أصل 150,100، أو 40% منهم، يطلبون العلم في المدارس الرسميّة العلمانيّة والدينيّة على حد سواء، بينما 90,200 تلميذ أو 60% من المجموع الأصلي، يتلقون دراستهم في مدارس حريدية خاصة.\nيرى العديد من الإسرائيليين أن القدس مدينة فقيرة تمزقها النزاعات السياسية والدينية، لذا فهم يفضلون سكن مدن أخرى أكثر أمانًا وغنى، وبالمقابل تستقطب المدينة عددًا كبيرًا من الفلسطينيين من سكّان الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، كونها تقدم لهم فرص عمل وخدمات صحية أكبر من تلك المتاحة في مدنهم وقراهم. شجّع الزعماء الفلسطينيون والعرب السكان الفلسطينيين عبر السنين على البقاء في المدينة لتأكيد حقهم بالمطالبة بها، وقد فعل البعض منهم هذا.\n\nمخيم شعفاط\nتأسس مخيم شعفاط للاجئين في عام 1965، أي بعد أكثر من عقد واحد على تأسيس كافة المخيمات الرسمية الأخرى في الضفة الغربية، وذلك فوق أرض مساحتها 0,2 كيلومتر مربع شمال القدس. وقد تأسس مخيم شعفاط بعد أن تم إغلاق مخيم المعسكر في المدينة القديمة للقدس بسبب سوء الظروف الصحية فيه.\nوتعود أصول اللاجئين في مخيم المعسكر والذين رُحلوا إلى شعفاط إلى 55 قرية تابعة لمناطق القدس واللد ويافا والرملة. ومثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسس المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من الحكومة الأردنية.\nويُعد مخيم شعفاط المخيم الوحيد في الضفة الغربية الذي يقع ضمن الحدود البلدية للقدس. ولذلك، فإن اللاجئين فيه يحق لهم الحصول على هويات مدنية تابعة للقدس، الأمر الذي يضمن لهم حقوق الإقامة في القدس ويجعلهم مؤهلين للحصول على بعض الخدمات الاجتماعية الإسرائيلية، بما في ذلك الرعاية الصحية.\nوفي الوقت الذي تبين سجلات الأونروا الرسمية أن عدد اللاجئين المسجلين في المخيم يصل إلى حوالي 11,000 لاجئ، إلا أنه من المرجح أن يبلغ عدد اللاجئين فيه أكثر من 18,000. ويُقدر أن حوالي 4,000 لاجئ قد انتقلوا إلى المخيم في السنوات الأخيرة لتجنب فقدان حقوق الإقامة في القدس. ويعمل حوالي 70% من سكان المخيم في القطاع الخاص الإسرائيلي.\n\nتهويد القدس\nتتّبع إسرائيل سياسة دمج المستوطنات لاستيعاب أكبر عدد ممكن من اليهود داخل القدس، فعلى سبيل المثال دمجت الحكومة الإسرائيلية مستوطنة گفعات زئيف ومعاليه أدوميم ومناطق الخط الأخضر لاحتواء حوالي 30 ألف مستوطن جديد داخل المدينة. كما بنت 142 ألف شقة في القطاع اليهودي لزيادة حجم السكان فيها. تفيد إحدى تقارير البنك الدولي أن عدد مخالفات البناء في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1996 و2000، كان أكبر بأربع مرّات ونصف في الأحياء اليهودية، وأن عمليات الهدم في القدس الغربية كانت أقل بأربع مرّات من تلك الحاصلة في القدس الشرقية؛ كذلك أفاد التقرير أن السلطات الإسرائيلية كانت تمنح الفلسطينيين أذونًا بالبناء أقل بكثير من الأذون التي تمنحها لليهود، وأن المخالفين الفلسطينيين تُزال مخالفاتهم بنسبة أكبر من مخالفات اليهود. حصلت بعض المؤسسات اليهودية على إذن من الحكومة الإسرائيلية خلال السنوات القليلة الماضية، يسمح لها بتشييد المباني والمعالم على الأراضي المتنازع عليها، من شاكلة «حديقة الملك سليمان» المخطط إنشاؤها في قرية سلوان بمدينة داود، والتي يُشكل العرب حوالي 60% من سكانها، وفي مقبرة «مأمن الله». أطلق معارضو هذه الخطوات المُتخذة من قبل الحكومة الإسرائيلية مصطلح «تهويد القدس» على هذه الإجراءات، كونها تصب في مصلحة اليهود دون الفلسطينيين.\n\nالقدس الرسمية\nالبلديّة\nتأسس المجلس البلدي لمدينة القدس في سنة 1863 أبّان الحكم العثماني، وقد انقسم هذا المجلس إلى مجلسين عند تقسيم المدينة. تولت أمانة القدس الاهتمام بالقدس العربية بين نكبة فلسطين واحتلال القدس في حرب 1967.\nيتألّف مجلس بلديّة القدس الإسرائيلي اليوم من 31 عضوًا منتخبًا على رأسهم رئيس البلديّة، الذي يُنتخب لخمس سنوات، ويتمتع بحق تعيين ستة مفوضين بلديين لينوبوا عنه، وهؤلاء إلى جانب رئيس البلدية يتلقون رواتبهم كاملة من الحكومة الإسرائيلية، أما باقي الأعضاء فيُعتبر عملهم تطوعيًا. يعقد مجلس بلدية القدس معظم اجتماعاته بصفة سريّة، عدا جلسة واحدة في كل شهر تكون علنيّة. تُشكل الأحزاب الدينية عصبة قويّة داخل مجلس البلدية، حيث تسيطر غالبًا على معظم المقاعد. يقع دار بلدية القدس ومكتب رئيسها في ساحة الصفراء في شارع يافا. يتكوّن مجمّع البلدية، الذي افتتح في سنة 1993، من مبنيين حديثيّ البناء إلى جانب عشرة مبان قديمة مجددة، تحيط بساحة عامّة واسعة. تتبع المدينة محافظة القدس وتُشكّل عاصمتها. إضافة إلى ذلك، تقوم مؤسسة الأقصى لإعمار المقدسات بصيانة وترميم ورعاية المؤسسات والمباني الإسلامية في القدس.\nقامت بلدية القدس الغربية في سنة 1949 بإجراء مسابقة لتصميم علم للشطر الغربي من المدينة، ففاز تصميم تضمن رسمًا لخطين عريضين باللون الأزرق يرمزان إلى شال الصلاة اليهودية، على خلفية بيضاء يقع في وسطهما شعار المدينة. وجعلت إسرائيل التصميم الإسرائيلي شعارًا للمدينة بشطريها بعد حرب سنة 1967 عندما ضمت القدس الشرقية، على الرغم من أن السكان العرب والمجتمع الدولي لم يتعرف بذلك، لكن العلم والشعار بقيا بحكم الأمر الواقع. صُمم شعار القدس ما بين سنتيّ 1950 و1951، وهو يُظهر أسدًا جامحًا يُرمز به إلى أسد يهودا، شعار القبيلة اليهودية القديمة، محاطًا بأغصنة زيتون، وفي الخلفية رُسم حائط البراق. أما السلطة الفلسطينية فلم تنشئ شعار ولا علم للمدينة.\n\nرؤساء البلدية\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية القدس عدد من أعيان المدينة، كان أولهم «موسى العلمي». تولّى اليهود رئاسة البلدية لأوّل مرة في سنة 1937، وذلك عندما فاز «دانيال أستر» برئاسة البلدية بدعم من حكومة الانتداب البريطانية. وعندما انقسمت القدس إلى شطرين، أصبحت هناك بلديتين: بلدية القدس الشرقية ورئيسها عربي، وبلدية القدس الغربية ويرأسها إسرائيلي. أما أوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الشرقية فهو «أنور الخطيب»، وأوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الغربية هو الحاكم العسكري «دوڤ يوسف». وعندما ضمّت إسرائيل القدس الشرقية بعد حرب حزيران سنة 1967، أسست بلدية «أورشليم القدس» وتولّى رئاستها «ثيودور كولك». يشغل نير بركات منصب رئيس بلدية أورشليم القدس حاليًا، ويرأس زكي الغول أمانة القدس الشرقية، بما أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وأغلب دول العالم لا تعتبر ضم الأخيرة قانونياً.\n\nالوضع السياسي\nبعد أن أصدرت هيئة الأمم المتحدة قرارها القاضي بتقسيم فلسطين في سنة 1947، نصّت على وجوب تدويل القدس تحت إشرافها ورقابتها، وقد سارع القادة اليهود إلى قبول هذا الأمر نظرًا لأنه يحقق مطامحهم في إقامة دولة لهم، بينما عارضه الزعماء العرب ورفضوا أي تقسيم يُخطط إجراؤه في فلسطين. انقسمت المدينة إلى شطرين بعد حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب وإسرائيل، واحتلت الأخيرة القسم الغربي، فيما سيطر الأردن على القسم الشرقي. اعتبرت معظم الدول، وما زالت، أن وضع القدس ينبغي أن يُحدد كما ورد في قرار التقسيم، لذا فإن أغلبها لا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل.\nبعد أن أعلن دافيد بن غوريون، أوّل رئيس وزراء لإسرائيل، أن القدس الغربية عاصمة البلاد، اتخذت جميع الهيئات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، من قضائية وتشريعية وتنفيذية، من المدينة مقرًا لها، عدا وزارة الدفاع، التي لا تزال تتخذ من منطقة كرياة بوسط تل أبيب مركزًا لها. سيطرت إسرائيل على المدينة بشطريها مباشرةً بعد حرب سنة 1967، وجعلت منها جزءًا من العاصمة بحكم الأمر الواقع، على الرغم من معارضة المجتمع الدولي لهذا الأمر. لا تزال هويّة القدس كعاصمة «أبديّة» لإسرائيل تُشكّل موضع جدل كبير في المجتمع الدولي، فعلى الرغم من أن بعض الدول فتحت قنصليات لها في المدينة، فإن جميع السفارات موجودة خارجها، ومعظمها في تل أبيب. وبسبب عدم الاعتراف بالقدس كعاصمة لإسرائيل، فإن معظم الصحف العالمية والمحلية تصف إعلانات الحكومة الإسرائيلية بأنها «صادرة عن تل أبيب».\nأصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 بتاريخ 20 أغسطس سنة 1980، الذي نصّ على أن قانون الأساس الذي أصدرته إسرائيل واعتبرت فيه القدس عاصمة أبدية لها، قانونًا «فاسدًا باطلاً وينبغي إلغاؤه فورًا»، واقتُرح أن تقوم الدول الأعضاء في هذا المجلس بسحب كل هيئاتها الدبلوماسية من المدينة حتى تذعن إسرائيل للقرار الدولي، وقد استجابت معظم الدول ذات السفارات المتبقية في القدس لهذا الأمر، وقامت بنقل مراكز سفاراتها إلى تل أبيب، كما فعلت غيرها من الدول قبيل صدور القرار رقم 478، وكنتيجة لهذا الأمر، فرغت القدس من السفارات الأجنبية، لكن بعضًا منها اتخذ من إحدى ضواحيها، وهي «مڤاسرت صهيون»، مقرًا لها، كذلك استمرت 4 قنصليات موجودة بالمدينة. قرر الكونغرس الأمريكي نقل مقر السفارة الأمريكية من تل أبيب إلى القدس في سنة 1995، وذلك بعد إصدار «قانون السفارة في القدس» (بالإنگليزية: Jerusalem Embassy Act)، إلا أن بيل كلنتون، رئيس الولايات المتحدة آنذاك، استمر بتأجيل التوقيع على هذا القرار إلى أن انتهت ولايته، وعندها قال الرئيس الذي خلفه، وهو جورج بوش الابن، قال بأن قرارات الكونغرس المتعلقة بوضع القدس ليست إلزامية والهدف منها إبداء النصح والمشورة فقط، فلم يُقدم على توقيع القرار واستمرت السفارة الأمريكية موجودة في تل أبيب. قال أمين عام الأمم المتحدة، بان كي مون، في 28 أكتوبر سنة 2009، بأن القدس يجب أن تكون عاصمةً لكل من فلسطين وإسرائيل كي يتحقق السلام العادل والشامل.\n\nتقع في القدس أبرز المؤسسات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، بما فيها البرلمان أو الكنيست، والمحكمة العليا، والمقر الرسمي لرئيس الجمهورية ورئيس الوزراء. وقبيل إعلان قيام «دولة» إسرائيل، كانت القدس عاصمةً إدارية للأراضي الشاميّة الخاضعة للانتداب البريطاني، أي تلك التي تشمل اليوم أراضي السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل والأردن. كانت القدس الغربية عاصمةً لإسرائيل من سنة 1949 حتى سنة 1967، إلا أن دول العالم لم تعترف بهذا الأمر بما أن قرار الأمم المتحدة رقم 194 كان قد نصّ على تدويل المدينة. بعد أن خضعت المدينة بشطريها لإسرائيل بعد حرب سنة 1967، أعلنت حكومة ليڤي أشكول تطبيق القانون الإسرائيلي على القدس الشرقية وامتداد نطاق اختصاص القضاء الإسرائيلي إليها، لكنها وافقت على خضوع منطقة المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة لوزارة الأوقاف الأردنية. أمرت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقفال بيت الشرق، وهو مقرّ منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، في سنة 1988 لأسباب أمنيّة، وفي سنة 1992 أعيد افتتاح البيت بصفته مضافة. نصّت اتفاقية أوسلو على أن الوضع النهائي للقدس يجب أن يتحدد عن طريق مفاوضات مع السلطة الفلسطينية، التي تعتبر القدس الشرقية عاصمة لدولة فلسطينية مستقبلية، وقد قال الرئيس الفلسطيني محمود عبّاس أن أية مفاوضات لا تتضمن الاعتراف بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة لفلسطين ستكون غير مقبولة. في السادس من ديسمبر 2017 قرر الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب الاعتراف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل ونقل سفارة الولايات المتحدة إلى القدس.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nالقدس مدينة ذات أهمية دينية كبرى عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث: اليهود والمسيحيون والمسلمون. أظهرت إحدى الإحصائيات من سنة 2000 أن القدس تحوي حاليًا 1204 كنسات، 158 كنيسة، و73 مسجدًا، والبعض من دور العبادة هذه يُعتبر من بين أكثر المواقع تقديسًا عند أتباع هذه الديانة أو تلك، إن لم يكن أقدسها في بعض الأحيان، لذا فقد كان انتهاك حُرمة إحدى هذه الدور من بين الأسباب التي أدّت دومًا إلى حصول نزاعات كبيرة في المدينة والمنطقة ككل.\n\nفي الإسلام\nالقدس هي ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وكانت تمثّل قبلة الصلاة الإسلامية طيلة ما يُقارب من سنة، قبل أن تتحول القبلة إلى الكعبة في مكة. وقد أصبحت القدس مدينة ذات أهميّة دينية عند المسلمين بعد أن أسرى الملاك جبريل بالنبي محمد إليها، وفق المعتقد الإسلامي، قرابة سنة 620 حيث عرج من الصخرة المقدسة إلى السماوات العلى حيث قابل جميع الأنبياء والرسل الذين سبقوه وتلقّى من الله تعاليم الصلاة وكيفية أدائها. تنص سورة الإسراء أن محمدًا أُسري به من المسجد الحرام إلى «المسجد الأقصى»: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾؛ وقد أجمع المفسرون على أن المقصود بالمسجد الأقصى مدينة القدس ذاتها، وسُميت الأقصى لبعد المسافة بينها وبين المسجد الحرام، إذ لم يكن حين إذن فيها المسجد الأقصى الحالي. يقع اليوم معلمين إسلاميين في الموقع الذي عرج منه النبي محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم) إلى السماء، وهما قبة الصخرة التي تحوي الصخرة المقدسة، والمسجد الأقصى الذي بُني خلال العهد الأموي. ومما يجعل من القدس مدينة مهمة في الإسلام أيضًا، أن عددًا كبيرًا من الأنبياء والصالحين الذين يتشارك المسلمون وأهل الكتاب عمومًا بالإيمان بهم، مع اختلاف النظرة إليهم، حيث يعتبر المسلمون واليهود أن عدد منهم أنبياء أو رسل بينما ينظر المسيحيون إليهم بصفتهم قديسين، قطنوا المدينة عبر التاريخ أو عبروها، ومنهم داود وسليمان وزكريا ويحيى والمسيح عيسى بن مريم، وكذلك لذكر المدينة في القرآن بأنها وما حولها أراض مباركة شكّلت قبلة للأنبياء ومهبطًا للملائكة والوحي وأن الناس يُحشرون فيها يوم القيامة.\nأما عند الشيعة الإثنا عشرية فالمسجد الأقصى مكانه في السماء الرابعة وليس على الأرض فليس للمسجد الأقصى مكانة ذات أهمية لديهم، عن سلام الحناط، عن رجل، عن أبي عبد الله قال: سألته عن المساجد التي لها الفضل فقال: المسجد الحرام ومسجد الرسول، قلت: والمسجد الأقصى جعلت فداك؟ فقال: ذاك في السماء إليه أسري رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فقلت: إن الناس يقولون: إنه بيت المقدس؟ فقال: مسجد الكوفة أفضل منه.\n\nفي المسيحية\nيجلّ المسيحيون القدس لأسباب مختلفة، منها تاريخها الذي ورد ذكره في العهد القديم، إضافة إلى لعبها دورًا محوريًا في حياة يسوع المسيح. ينص العهد الجديد أن يسوع أُحضر إلى المدينة بعد ولادته بفترة قصيرة، وتذكر التقاليد المسيحية أنه قام لاحقًا بتطهير معبد حيرود من الأصنام الرومانية التي وضعها الملك حيرود داخله، وأنه قلب موائد الصيارفة وكراسي باعة الحمام ولم يدع أحدًا يجتاز الهيكل بمتاع.\nيؤمن البعض أن العليّة حيث تناول المسيح وتلاميذه العشاء الأخير، تقع على جبل صهيون في ذات المبنى حيث يقع ضريح الملك داود. ومن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة في المدينة أيضًا، التلّة المعروفة باسم «جلجثة»، وهي موقع صلب يسوع بحسب الإيمان المسيحي. يصف إنجيل يوحنا هذه التلّة بأنها تقع خارج القدس، إلا أن بعض الحفريات أظهرت مؤخرًا أنها تقع على بُعد مسافة قليلة من البلدة القديمة داخل حدود المدينة الحاليّة. أمّا أقدس الأماكن المسيحية في القدس فهي كنيسة القيامة، التي يحج إليها المسيحيون من مختلف أنحاء العالم منذ حوالي ألفيّ سنة، ويقول بعض الخبراء والمؤرخين أنها أكثر المواقع احتمالاً بأن تكون قد شُيدت على الجلجثة.\n\nفي اليهودية\nأصبحت المدينة مقدسة عند اليهود بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعلها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة في القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد. وكانت القدس تحوي الهيكل الذي بناه سليمان بن داود، الذي يسميه اليهود «هيكل سليمان»، بالإضافة إلى هيكل أو معبد حيرود الذي شُيّد في وقت لاحق بعد أن هُدم الهيكل الأوّل. ورد ذكر هذا الهيكل 632 مرّة في الكتاب المقدس، وما زال اليهود اليوم يتعبدون عند حائط البراق أو حائط المبكى، الذي يؤمنون بأنه كل ما تبقى من المعبد القديم، ويُشكل هذا الحائط ثاني أقدس الأماكن في اليهودية بعد «قدس الأقداس».\nتُبنى جميع الكنس في العالم ومحرابها يواجه القدس، أما محاريب كنس القدس فتواجه «قدس الأقداس». تنص التوراة الشفهية والشريعة اليهودية أن الصلاة يجب أن تتلى في اتجاه القدس وهيكل حيرود، والكثير من الأسر اليهودية تضع لويحة «مزراح» على إحدى جدران منزلها لتحديد قبلة الصلاة. ذُكرت القدس في التناخ 669 مرّة، وذُكر اسم «صهيون» التي يقصد بها اليهود المدينة تارة وفلسطين ككل تارة أخرى، 154 مرّة.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة بحد ذاتها إحدى المعالم التاريخية المقدسية. تبلغ مساحة القدس القديمة، ضمن الأسوار قرابة كيلومترًا مربعًا ويقع المسجد الأقصى في الناحية الشرقية من المدينة وأسوارها. وتقسم المدينة إلى حارات أو خطط، وفي هذه الأحياء أسواق محلية صغيرة استقلت عن الأسواق الرئيسة، وكانت الأحياء تضم مجموعات سكانية منسجمة في بيئتها الاجتماعية والدينية، وطرق المدينة القديمة متعرجة، غُطي بعضها بعقود، وقد تقوم منشآت أو امتدادات عالية للبيوت. ومن أهم هذه المنشآت المساجد والمآذن والمدارس، وإذا استثنيت قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، فإن أكثر المساجد والمآذن في القدس تعود إلى العصر المملوكي، مثل المئذنة الفخرية عام 1278، ومئذنة باب الغوانمة من عام 1329، ومئذنة باب الأسباط عام 1367. ومن المساجد هناك مسجد القلعة الذي بُني عام 1310، والمسجد القيمري عام 1276 وجامع الخانقاة الصلاحية، وتعود مئذنته إلى عام 1395. ومن المساجد التي بنيت في العهد العثماني مسجد النبي داود الذي أنشأه السلطان سليمان القانوني وهو مجمع معماري، ولقد حوّلته إسرائيل إلى كنيس وأزيلت الكتابات القرآنية منه واستبدلت بكتابة عبرية، وجامع المولوية المُشيّد سنة 1587 والمسجد القيمري.\nإن أكثر المباني الإسلامية في القدس هي المدارس التعليمية. حيث أن عدد المدارس والزوايا في القدس خلال القرن الحادي عشر الهجري كان 630 مدرسة، ومن أقدم المدارس المدرسة المنصورية التي أنشأها الملك المنصور قلاوون. وتمتاز عمارة المدارس بالفناء ذي البركة تشرف عليه الأواوين والغرف، أما الواجهة الجميلة التي تدخل منها إلى المدرسة من خلال دركاه، فهي من مميزات العمارة المملوكية، وإذا كانت المدارس المملوكية في القدس لم ترق إلى مستوى المدارس في القاهرة التي تميزت بالاتساع والفخامة كمدرسة السلطان حسن، فإنها مع ذلك تتمتع بالأناقة والبساطة والوحدة، ومن أهم المدارس المملوكية الباقية حتى اليوم: المدرسة السلامية (1300م)، المدرسة الجاولية (1320م)، المدرسة التنكزية (1329م)، المدرسة الأمينية (1330م)، المدرسة الملكية (1340م)، المدرسة الفارسية (1353م)، المدرسة الأرغونية (1356م)، المدرسة القشتمرية (1358م)، المدرسة المحدثية (1360م)، والمدرسة الطشتمرية (1384م). تشمل معالم القدس الحاليّة ما يلي:\n\nالثقافة\nتُعتبر القدس مدينةً تنصهر فيها دينيًا الثقافة في بوتقة واحدة، نظرًا لأهميتها الدينية ولعب الدين دورًا مهمًا في حياة سكانها من العرب والإسرائيليين، كما أن ثقافة سكان منطقة القدس شكلت جزءًا كبيرًا من هويتهم منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الحضر الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن معظم اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميّز في منطقة القدس ووسط الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى، حيث أن لمدينة القدس ثوبها الخاص، الذي يمتاز بأنه أكثر الأثواب الفلسطينية جمعًا لآثار كل العصور التي مرت على المدينة، فعلى الصدر توجد قبة ملكات الكنعانيون وعلى الجوانب تظهر طريقة التصليب منذ أيام الحكم الصليبي، كما ويظهر الهلال والآيات القرآنية كدليل على عودة القدس للحكم الإسلامي العربي. وبشكل عام فإن آثار النكبة تظهر علي الثوب الفلسطيني، إذ يظهر الحزن والحنين من خلال الألوان، من خلال اختفاء الألوان الزاهية مشيرة إلى أن ظهور تطريز الماكينة دليل على عدم اهتمام المرأة بالتطريز وعلى الوضع الاقتصادي السيئ.\nيُعتبر المتحف الإسرائيلي أحد أهم المواقع الثقافية بالمدينة، حيث يستقبل نحو مليون زائر سنويًا، يُشكل السيّاح ثلثهم. تصل مساحة مجمّع المتحف إلى 20 دونم (81,000 م2) وهو يضم عدد من المباني ذات المعارض المختلفة، حيث تُعرض أعمال فنيّة إسرائيلية وأوروبية، إضافة للعديد من المكتشفات الأثرية والمخطوطات اليهودية القديمة. وفي المتحف معلمٌ بارز هو صحن مائي يُعرف بصحن الكتاب، وهو يحوي مخطوطات البحر الميت التي اكتُشفت في أواسط القرن العشرين في كهوف خربة قمران بالقرب من البحر سالف الذكر. خُصصت إحدى أجنحة المتحف لتلقين الأطفال دروس في الرسم النحت، ويزور هذا الجناح قرابة 100,000 طفل في السنة، ولهذا المتحف حديقة خارجية مخصصة لعرض أعمال النحت، ومن أبرز المنحوتات فيها المنحوتة المصغرة لمعبد حيرود. ومن المتاحف الأخرى ذات الأهمية، متحف روكفلر في القدس الشرقية أو «متحف فلسطين للآثار» سابقا، الذي بُني أيام الانتداب البريطاني في سنة 1938، وهو يُعد أوّل متحف للآثار شُيّد في الشرق الأوسط. والذي تتخذه اليوم سلطة الآثار الإسرائيلية مقرا لها.\n\nتأوي القدس النصب التذكاري المعروف باسم نصب «ياد ڤاشيم» (بالعبرية: יד ושם)، المخصص لإحياء ذكرى اليهود الذين قضوا في المحرقة النازية، وهذا النصب مجمّع ذو أجنحة عديدة تُشكل أكبر أرشيف عالميّ لكل ما يتعلق بالمحرقة سالفة الذكر. من أبرز أجنحة المجمّع متحفًا فريدًا يعرض مواضيعًا مختلفة تتعلق بالإبادة الجماعية لليهود ويُركز على الروايات والقصص المتعلقة ببعض الأفراد والعائلات الذين قُتلوا آنذاك، كما يعرض مجموعة فنيّة من أعمال بعض الفنانين الذين قضوا نحبهم في المحرقة. يُحيي هذا النصب أيضًا ذكرى الأطفال اليهود الذين قتلهم النازيون بالإضافة إلى «الشرفاء من بين الأمم»، ويُقصد بهم الأشخاص غير اليهود الذين خاطروا بحياتهم خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية لإنقاذ أطفال اليهود من الإعدام. كذلك هناك جناحٌ يُطلق عليه تسمية «الجناح الموصول»، وهو يعرض أعمال فنيّة تمثل العيش المشترك بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، وهو يقع على الطريق الفاصلة بين القدس الشرقية والغربية.\n\nتتخذ عدّة مراق وفرق فنيّة من القدس مقرًا لها، ومن هذه الأوركسترا السمفونية المقدسيّة التي تأسست في عقد الأربعينات من القرن العشرين، بالإضافة إلى الأوركسترا الإسرائيلية التي تؤدي أعمالها الفنية في مركز المؤتمرات الدولية (بالعبرية: מרכז הקונגרסים הבינלאומי) الذي يقع بالقرب من مدخل القدس الغربيّة، وأيضًا المركز الموسيقي في القدس، الواقع حي «يمين موشيه»، وغيرها. استضافت القدس «المهرجان الإسرائيلي» طيلة 25 عامًا، وهذا المهرجان يُقام سنويًا منذ سنة 1961 وتؤدى فيه عدّة أعمال مسرحية خارجية وداخلية بالإضافة لحفلات موسيقية لمغنين محليين وعالميين. يستضيف مسرح القدس في حارة الطالبية ما يزيد عن 150 حفلاً موسيقيًا في السنة، إلى جانب عروض مسرحية وراقصة لفنانين عالميين. وهناك أيضًا «مسرح خان» الذي يقع في الكاروانسرا مقابل محطة القطارات القديمة، وهو مسرح الذخائر الوحيد بالمدينة. ومن البرامج الثقافية الخاصة بالقدس، مهرجان القدس السينمائي، الذي تُعرض فيه أعمال سينمائية إسرائيلية وعالمية.\n\nتؤوي القدس بعض معارض اللوحات مثل «بيت تيخو»، في وسط المدينة، وهو منزل قديم تحوّل إلى متحف حاليًا، تُعرض فيه لوحات الفنانة «حنّة تيخو» المعروفة برسمها لتلال القدس، والمجموعات العبرانية لزوجها الذي كان يعمل كحالاً، وافتتح أول عيادة لطب العيون في القدس سنة 1912. كذلك هناك معرض الحوش، وهو معرض فني فلسطيني تأسس في سنة 2004 تُعرض فيه عدّة أعمال فنيّة لفنانين فلسطينيين.\n\nأعلنت القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية في سنة 2009. تُشكل المدينة مقرًا للمسرح الوطني الفلسطيني، الذي يعمل على الحفاظ على الثقافة والهويّة العربية والفلسطينية للقدس، بالإضافة لإجراء عدّة نشاطات تهدف إلى إحياء اهتمام الفلسطينيين بالفن. يرعى معهد إدوارد سعيد الوطني للموسيقى الأوركسترا الشبابية الفلسطينية، التي قامت بجولة فنيّة شملت دول الخليج العربي وغيرها من دول الشرق الأوسط في سنة 2009. يقع المتحف الإسلامي في القدس على متن الحرم القدسي الشريف، وقد تأسس هذا المتحف في سنة 1923، وهو يضم كثيرًا من القطع الأثرية الإسلامية، التي تتراوح من أدوات الكحل صغيرة الحجم والمخطوطات النادرة، إلى العواميد الرخامية الضخمة. حظرت إسرائيل احتفالات إعلان القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية بحجة أنها كانت برعاية السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وأقيم احتفال في بلدة بيت عنان عوضًا عن ذلك، وعلى مدى 4 أيام، وحضره ما يزيد عن 15,000 شخص.\nهناك عدد من المؤسسات والمنظمات اللاربحيّة في القدس، التي تسعى للتقريب بين السكان من العرب والإسرائيليين، ومن شاكلة هذه المنظمات: «الصندوق الإبراهيمي» و«مركز التبادل الثقافي المقدسي»، الذان يُشجعان على القيام بمشاريع ثقافية مشتركة بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، كذلك «مركز القدس للموسيقى والرقص الشرقي» الذي يُخصص حلقات عمل للإسرائيليين والعرب على حد سواء، ويهدف إلى تعزيز لغة الحوار والتواصل بين الطرفين عن طريق تشجيعهم على القيام بأعمال فنيّة مشتركة، أيضًا هناك الأوركسترا اليهودية العربية الشبابيّة، التي تؤدي عروض موسيقية تقليدية أوروبية وشرق أوسطيّة. قام الفنان البولندي «تشيسلاو دزاڤيگاي» بصنع منحوتة تمثّل التعايش السلمي الذي يُطمح إليه بين الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين، وأطلق عليه «نصب التسامح» ونُصب في سنة 2008 على تلة فاصلة بين مستوطنة تلبيوت الشرقية وجبل المكبر، كعلامة على نضال المقدسيين في سبيل الحصول على السلام.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكان الحج إلى القدس يُشكل أبرز مواردها المالية عبر التاريخ، بما أنها مدينة داخلية تقع بعيدًا عن المرافئ الهامّة مثل يافا وغزة. لا تزال المعالم الدينية في القدس هي ما يستقطب الزوّار الأجانب بشكل رئيسي، حيث أن معظمهم يأتي ليزور حائط البراق وكنيسة القيامة والمسجد الأقصى، وغيرها من الأماكن في البلدة القديمة، إلا أنه أصبح من الجليّ خلال نصف القرن الفائت أن المدينة لا يمكنها أن تعتمد على هذه الزيارات وحدها لتؤمن مدخولاً كافيًا يفي بجميع الحاجات الحياتية للسكان.\nتُظهر عدّة إحصائيات أن اقتصاد المدينة في نمو مطّرد، إلا أنه من الملاحظ بأن القدس الشرقية لا تزال أقل نموًا من الغربية، لكن على الرغم من ذلك فإن نسبة الأسر العربية التي يعمل عدد من أفرادها أعلى من تلك الخاصة بالأسر اليهودية، حيث تصل الأولى إلى 76.1% والثانية إلى 66.8%. يصل معدّل البطالة في القدس إلى 8.3%، وهو بهذا أقل من المعدّل الوطني الإسرائيلي الذي يصل إلى 9.0%، على الرغم من أن نسبة القوّة العاملة بالمدينة أقل من تلك الخاصة بمدن أخرى مثل تل أبيب (58.0%) وحيفا (52.4%). أظهرت دراسات أخرى أن نسبة الفقر بالقدس ارتفعت بشكل ملحوظ خلال الفترة الممتدة من سنة 2001 حتى سنة 2007، حيث ازدادت نسبة السكان الذين يعيشون تحت خط الفقر بحوالي 40%. وصل معدّل المدخول الشهري للعامل في القدس خلال سنة 2006 إلى 5,940 شيكل جديد (1,410 دولار أمريكي)، أي أقل بحوالي 1,350 شيكل من العامل في تل أبيب.\n\nأصدرت السلطات البريطانية قانونًا أيام الانتداب ينص على عدم جواز تشييد المباني إلا باستخدام الحجر المقدسي، وذلك في سبيل الحفاظ على الهويّة التاريخية وجماليّة هذه المدينة الفريدة، وما زال هذا القانون ساري المفعول حتى الوقت الحالي، وهناك جهود لتكملته عن طريق عدم التشجيع على بناء المصانع داخل القدس؛ وقد خصصت السلطات الإسرائيلية 2.2% فقط من مساحة المدينة لتشييد المصانع، وبالمقابل يُلاحظ أن نسبة الأراضي المخصصة للبنى التحتية في تل أبيب تفوق تلك الخاصة بالقدس بحوالي الضعف، بينما تفوق نسبة تلك الأراضي في حيفا نسبة أراضي القدس بحوالي سبعة مرّات. يعمل ما نسبته 8.5% من إجمالي القوة العاملة الخاصة بمحافظة القدس في قطاع الصناعة، وهذا يُشكل نصف المعدل الوطني في إسرائيل (15.8%)، بالمقابل تفوق نسبة المقدسيين العاملين في قطاعات أخرى باقي المعدلات الوطنية. قامت بضعة شركات التقنية العالية بفتح فروع لها أو نقل مراكزها حتى من تل أبيب إلى القدس، وقد أدّى مثل هذا الأمر إلى توفير 12,000 فرصة عمل جديدة في سنة 2006. من المراكز الاقتصادية المهمة في القدس ما يُعرف باسم «مجمّع الصناعات العلمية الغنيّة»، وهو مجمّع يقع في شمال المدينة ويُشكل مقرًا لبعض أهم الشركات مثل: إنتل، شركة تيڤا لصناعة الأدوية، أتوترونكس عوفير، وشركة ECI للاتصالات. يُخطط بعض المسؤولين لتوسعة هذا المجمّع حتى يُغطي مساحة 530,000 متر مربّع (130 فدّان)، ويتسع لمزيد من الشركات بالإضافة لمحطة إطفاء ومدرسة.\nلعبت الحكومة الإسرائيلية دورًا كبيرًا في تنمية اقتصاد القدس منذ تأسيس «دولة» إسرائيل، فهناك عدد كبير من الوظائف الحكومية الشاغرة بالمدينة، كونها مقر للحكومة، والأخيرة تقدم دعمًا وحوافز متعددة للشركات والمؤسسات الوليدة، كي تستمر متمركزة بالقدس. أفادت مجلة «السياحة والترفيه» (بالإنجليزية: Travel + Leisure) الأمريكية أن القدس هي أفضل مدن أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط للسياحة الترفيهية في سنة 2010.\nيقول الخبراء أن اقتصاد القدس الشرقية لا يزال يُعاني من مشاكل وعوائق مختلفة لأسباب عديدة، منها جدار الفصل العازل الذي شيدته إسرائيل في عمق الضفة الغربية وفي محيط مدينة القدس، الأمر الذي يؤدي إلى إخراج مدينة القدس من ارتباطها ببقية الأراضي الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، والذي يجعلها مفتوحة فقط نحو إسرائيل، بالإضافة لإقامة الحواجز العسكرية وإعاقة دخول سكان القرى المجاورة للقدس، وباقي سكان المدن الفلسطينية مع ارتفاع تكلفة نقل البضائع نتيجة الحواجز والإغلاق. وحسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية في آخر دراسة أعدتها في شهر يوليو من سنة 2006 فإنّ مدينة القدس كانت بحاجة إلى استثمارات فورية تقارب المئة وخمسون مليون دولار كنقطة بداية كاستثمارات فورية خلال الأعوام الثلاثة القادمة، وتشمل هذه الاستثمارات مجالات الإسكان السياحة وترميم البلدة القديمة، وتطوير الصناعات الحرفية في المدينة.\n\nومن الصعوبات التي تواجه هذا الشطر من المدينة وتعيق نموّه بشكل مطّرد التشدد في فرض الضرائب وجبايتها وتطبيق باقي القوانين الاقتصادية والاجتماعية على العرب الفلسطينيين في القدس. كذلك يقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن هنالك تشدّد في منع دخول المنتجات الفلسطينية إلى أسواق القدس، خصوصاً المنتجات الغذائية كالألبان البيض وهي منتجات أقلّ سعراً من المنتجات الإسرائيلية المماثلة.\nوقد أدّت القيود والإجراءات الإسرائيلية إلى تراجع الأداء الاقتصادي للقدس الشرقية في مختلف القطاعات، فقد اضطر عدد من المصانع إلى تقليص إنتاجها أو إغلاق مصانعها بسبب انخفاض الطلب على المنتجات المحلية غير الغذائية منها إلى الثلث وضعف إمكانية المنتج المحلي على المنافسة نتيجة لارتفاع تكاليف التوزيع بسبب الإغلاق، كذلك ظهر أنه في شهر أكتوبر من سنة 2000 انقطع التدفّق السياحي إلى الشطر الشرقي، وألغيت جميع الحجوزات حتى نهاية سنة 2001، فكان من نتيجة ذلك أن أغلقت بضعة فنادق أبوابها وسرّحت موظفيها.\n\nيقول مدير الغرفة التجارية في القدس الشرقية، عزّام أبو السعود، أنّ موضوع الاستثمار، وبوجه الخصوص الاستثمار طويل المدى، أو الذي يستغرق إقامة منشآته عدة سنوات، والبحث عن مستثمرين، هو العنصر الذي يجب التركيز عليه في سبيل النهوض باقتصاد القدس الشرقية، ودعا إلى إنشاء صندوق ضمان الاستثمار، الذي يضمن للمستثمر الخائف عائدًا مناسبًا لأمواله، وضمانات أن لا يؤثّر الوضع الأمني السياسي على مشروعه، وضمان عائد مجدي لاستثماره، كذلك دعا إلى عدم إغفال موضوع التدريب واقتباس النموذج الألماني في التدريب الحرفي، كونه النموذج الذي قاد الألمان لإعادة بناء اقتصادهم الذي دمرته الحرب العالمية الثانية. وقال أنه يجب أن يتم إحياء مشروع سوق القطّانين بالبلدة القديمة، وكذلك الحمامات المملوكية أو التركية بعد ترميمها. هذا بالإضافة إلى تحويل جزء من الاستثمار إلى قطاع الإسكان والإنشاءات لتوفير المنازل الكافية لبقاء أكبر عدد من سكان القدس. والاهتمام الأكبر بترميم منازل البلدة القديمة، وأنْ يشمل المنازل القديمة خارج السور وذلك لتوفير نوعية حياة أفضل للسكان. وفي سنة 2010، أعلن المهندس مازن سنقرط رئيس مجموعة سنقرط الاستثمارية عن تأسيس شركة قابضة في القدس تحمل اسم«القدس القابضة» برأسمال 20 مليون دولار بهدف الاستثمار في عدد من القطاعات الاقتصادية والتعليمية في القدس الشرقية.\n\nالمواصلات\nيُعتبر مطار القدس الدولي أقرب المطارات إلى القدس، وقد كان يُستخدم للطيران المدني حتى أغلقته السلطات الإسرائيلية في سنة 2001، وسيطر عليه الجيش الإسرائيلي لقمع الانتفاضة التي قامت في وجه إسرائيل في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة. تحوّلت جميع الرحلات الجويّة بعد إغلاق المطار إلى مطار بن غوريون الدولي، وهو أكبر مطارات إسرائيل وأكثرها ازدحامًا، حيث يصل عدد المسافرين فيه سنويًا إلى 9 ملايين مسافر.\nتتولى شركة «إيگد» التعاونية، وهي ثاني أكبر شركة نقل بالحفلات في العالم، تقديم خدمة النقل للسكّان من وإلى القدس، وبداخلها، وهي تتمركز في محطة حافلات المدينة الواقعة في شارع يافا بالقرب من مدخل الطريق السريع الغربي للقدس. كانت الحافلات وسيارات الأجرة والسيارات الخصوصية هي وسائل النقل الأكثر استعمالاً في القدس حتى سنة 2008، عندما أُطلق مشروع سكة الحديد الخفيفة، وابتُدئ العمل فيه على قدم وساق. يقول المهندسون العاملون على المشروع، أن هذه القاطرات ستقدم خدمة النقل لحوالي 200,000 شخص يوميًا، وسيكون لها 24 محطة. انتهى العمل على هذه السكّة في 15 يونيو سنة 2010، وتمت تجربة القاطرة الأولى في 23 أغسطس من نفس العام.\n\nمن المشاريع الأخرى التي تنوي إسرائيل تنفيذها بالقدس، مشروع سكة حديدية سريعة تمتد من تل أبيب إلى القدس، يُخطط الانتهاء من العمل عليها في سنة 2011، وستكون محطتها الأخيرة محطةً تحتأرضيّة على عمق 80 مترًا (262.47 قدمًا)، تقع بالقرب من مركز المؤتمرات الدولية ومحطة الحافلات، ويهدف المسؤولون إلى وصل هذه السكة في نهاية المطاف بمحطة المالحة، وهي محطة القطارات المملوكة من قبل الدولة، والتي تقدم خدمة النقل من القدس إلى تل أبيب مرورًا بمدينة بيت شيمش.\nتُعتبر طريق مناحيم بيگن السريعة إحدى أبرز طرق القدس التي تصل شمالها بجنوبها؛ فهي تمتد على طول القسم الغربي من القدس وتتصل بطريق «معاليه بيت حورون» في الشمال لتكمل اتجاهها نحو تل أبيب. يمتد الطريق السريع رقم 60 عبر وسط المدينة بالقرب من الخط الأخضر الفاصل بين القدس الشرقية والغربية. يجري العمل حاليًا على تشييد طريق تحيط بالمدينة يبلغ طولها 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) لتصل الضواحي ببعضها البعض، لكن ردود الفعل حول هذا المشروع جاءت متناقضة حيث عارضه البعض وقبله البعض الآخر.\n\nالتعليم\nتتخذ عدّة جامعات مرموقة من القدس مقرًا لها، وتؤمّن برامج تعليمية للطلاّب باللغات العربية، العبرية، والإنگليزية، ومن هذه الجامعات الجامعة العبرية التي تأسست في سنة 1925، وتُعتبر حاليًا من بين أفضل 100 مؤسسة تعليمية في العالم. كان بعض أبرز العقول المفكرة في العالم أعضاءً في مجلس أمناء هذه الجامعة، ومنهم ألبرت أينشتاين وسيگموند فرويد، وقد تخرّج منها بعض الفائزين بجوائز نوبل مثل: أڤرام هيرشكو، داود گروس، ودانيال كاهنمان. تشتهر الجامعة العبرية بمكتبتها المعروفة بالمكتبة اليهودية، التي يُحتفظ فيها بأكثر من 5 ملايين كتاب. افتتحت هذه المكتبة في سنة 1892، أي قبل افتتاح الجامعة ذاتها بحوالي ثلاثة عقود، وهي اليوم المكتبة المركزية للجامعة ومكتبة إسرائيل الوطنية. للجامعة العبرية 3 أحرام جامعيّة في القدس: على جبل المشارف، تلة الشيخ بدر، وحرم طبيّ في مستشفى حداثة بعين كارم.\nتأسست جامعة القدس المفتوحة في سنة 1984 لتكون جامعة رائدة لسكّان القدس العرب، وتصف الجامعة نفسها على أنها «الجامعة العربية الوحيدة في القدس». تعاونت جامعة القدس المفتوحة وكليّة بارد من نيويورك على افتتاح كليّة مشتركة في ذات المبنى الذي كان يُشكل مقر المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني حيث كان يقع مكتب الرئيس الفلسطيني ياسر عرفات، وذلك في خريف سنة 2010، ومن المقرر إنشاء برنامج دراسي لمنح درجة ماجستير تدريس الآداب. يقع الحرم الرئيسي لهذه الجامعة جنوب شرقي القدس في بلدة أبو ديس، وتبلغ مساحته 190,000 متر مربّع (47 فدّان). ومن مؤسسات التعليم العالي الأخرى في المدينة: أكاديمية القدس لتعليم الموسيقى والرقص، وأكاديمية بيتسالئيل للفنون والتصميم، وكلا المبنيين يقعان في حرم الجامعة العبرية.\n\nتأسست كليّة القدس للعلوم التقنية في سنة 1969، وهي تؤمن برامج تدريب هندسية وتقنية للطلاّب، وهذه الكليّة هي إحدى المدارس التي تجمع بين البرامج العلمانية والدينيّة في القدس الغربية، وفي الشطر الأخير من المدينة عدد من المدارس الدينية اليهودية مثل «مدرسة صموئيل» و«مدرسة مير يشيڤا»، التي يُزعم أنها أكبرها. وصل عدد التلاميذ في السنة الدراسية الأخيرة في المدارس اليهودية خلال العام الدراسي 2003–2004 إلى 8,000 تلميذ، إلا أن 55% من هؤلاء فقط يتقدمون لامتحان شهادة الثانوية العامة، أما الباقون فيلتحقون بالمعاهد المهنية الحريدية. تُقدّم بلديّة القدس حوافزًا مالية في سبيل استقطاب المزيد من التلاميذ اليهود إلى الجامعات الإسرائيلية في القدس، بالإضافة إلى إعانات لأولئك الذين يستأجرون شققًا سكنية للإقامة فيها طيلة مدة دراستهم.\n\nتسعى المؤسسات الإسرائيلية المختلفة وبدعم من الحكومة من أجل تحقيق سيطرة مطلقة على قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، وذلك بعد أن تمّ التحكم بنحو 66% من قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، حيث تم فرض المناهج التعليمية على المدارس الابتدائية العربية هناك منذ عام 1968، وتبعًا لذلك تم استبدال كلمة «فلسطين» بكلمة «إسرائيل» و«القدس» بكلمة «أورشليم القدس». ويقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن الحكومة الإسرائيلية تحاول التضييق على الطلبة العرب في مدينة القدس لإجبارهم على ترك المدينة للاستئثار بخيارات التعليم، الأمر الذي يعرضهم للانتقال من مدينة القدس وفقًا لما تنص عليه القوانين الإسرائيلية. يُعاني معظم الطلاّب العرب في القدس من عوائق ومشاكل عديدة من جراء السياسات الإسرائيلية، فثمة اكتظاظ شديد في الصفوف المدرسية والدوام في غالبية المدارس على فترتين، وهناك نقص حاد وكبير في المختبرات في المدارس العربية في القدس، ناهيك عن ضعف التجهيزات الرياضية وكذلك النقص الواضح للمعلمين والخدمات، والملاحظ أيضًا أن المدارس غير مؤهلة للتدريس الجيد بسبب قدمها وعدم القيام بعملية تحديث ضرورية. ونظرًا لهذه الأسباب وصلت نسبة تسرب الطلبة العرب في القدس قبل الوصول إلى المرحلة الثانوية إلى نحو 50% خلال العقد الأول من القرن الحادي والعشرين، كما تشير إحدى الدراسات، وقد أدّى هذا إلى هجرة لطلاّب وأسر كاملة إلى مدن وقرى الضفة الغربية للبحث عن فرص تعليم مجانية. يلتحق البعض من المقدسيين العرب بالمدارس الإسرائيلية، لكن هؤلاء يتبعون في غالبيتهم إدارات وسياسات إما البلدية أو وزارة المعارف الإسرائيلية، التي تهدف إلى «تعميق المفاهيم الصهيونية، وضرب الانتماء الفلسطيني، من خلال حصص تعليمية عن الهوية اليهودية والتراث اليهودي الصهيوني، وربط الهبات والمكافآت للمدارس بنسبة التجنيد للجيش أو الخدمة المدنية والعسكرية، إلى جانب معايير أخرى».\nأطلقت ملكة الأردن رانيا العبد الله مبادرة «مدرستي فلسطين» وذلك لدعم التعليم وتحسين البيئة التعليمية في مدارس القدس العربية، «لا لأن للأردن علاقة بالقدس ودورًا تاريخيًا فقط ولكن لأن القدس مسؤولية كل عربي أولاً واخيرًا» على حد تعبيرها. من أبرز المؤسسات التعليمية في القدس الشرقية، المركز المعروف باسم «المركز التربوي لتطوير العاملين في حقل التعليم في القدس»، الذي يُعتبر المركز الوحيد التي يقدم الخدمات لمعلمي شرقي القدس. يرى المركز نفسه كمحور تربوي يُقدم الخدمات لجهاز التعليم بكل ما لديه من موارد وإمكانات.\n\nالرياضة\nتعتبر كل من كرة القدم وكرة السلة، اللعبتان الأكثر شعبية في مدينة القدس، سواء عند العرب أو اليهود. يعتبر نادي جبل المكبر (المؤسس في 1976) من أشهر الأندية المقدسية والذي يلعب بالدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز بالضفة الغربية، والذي هو عضو في الاتحاد الآسيوي لكرة القدم، ويتخذ من ملعب فيصل الحسيني مركزًا له، والذي يقع في الرام شمال القدس. من جهة أخرى، يعتبر كل من نادي بيتار القدس ونادي هابويل القدس من أكثر الأندية شهرة في إسرائيل، ويتخذان أيضًا من ملاعب القدس مركزًا لهما. من الأندية الفلسطينية الأخرى في القدس: هلال القدس، العربي بيت صفافا، الأنصار المقدسي، دي لاسال، أهلي القدس، جبل الزيتون، إسلامي سلوان، أبناء القدس، أرثوذكسي القدس، وغيرها.\nعرفت الرياضة النسوية الفلسطينية نهوضًا ملحوظًا في القدس منذ أن تولى اللواء جبريل الرجوب رئاسة اتحاد الكرة الفلسطينية واللجنة الأولمبية الفلسطينية، وقد تأسس فريق كرة القدم النسائية الأول بالمدينة حوالي سنة 2008، وواجه وما زال مشكلات كبيرة وهي النقص الحاد في الدعم المادي وحتى المعنوي، لكنه استطاع أن يصبح من الأندية المعروفة على الرغم من ذلك.\nيقام في القدس سنويًا، سباق جري سنوي نصفي، حيث يركض المتسابقون من كل أنحاء العالم متنافسين في جولة حول أشهر معالم المدينة. بالإضافة إلى هذا السباق النصفي ذو 21.1 كم، يمكن للمشاركين الركض مسافة 10 كم. كل من المسارين يبدأ وينتهي عند تلة الشيخ بدر أو «گفعات رام».\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من القدس عددٌ من المشاهير، من عرب وإسرائيليين، ومنهم:\n\nالعرب\nمحمد كامل البديري، مفوض مقاطعة رام الله خلال العهد العثماني ومؤسس جريدة الصباح.\nمبارك عوّاد، عالم نفس فلسطيني أمريكي، لجأ إلى القدس الشرقية عند قيام «دولة» إسرائيل ورفض الجنسية الإسرائيلية عند عرضها عليه.\nابتسام بركات، كاتبة وشاعرة ومربية فلسطينية أمريكية. نشرت مذكرات طفولتها تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي بعنوان «تذوّق السماء: طفولة فلسطينية»، في سنة 2007 فحازت على إعجاب الناس وفازت بعدّة جوائز.\nمصطفى البرغوثي، ناشط سلمي فلسطيني، رُشّح لرئاسة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في سنة 2005، لكنه خسر لصالح محمود عباس.\nجمال الدجاني، صحافي فلسطيني أمريكي ومنتج برامج تلفزيونية فائز بعدد من الجوائز.\nوليد خالدي، مؤرخ فلسطيني خرّيج جامعة أوكسفورد، يتحدث في أغلب مؤلفاته عن تهجير الفلسطينيين، وهو أحد مؤسسي الجمعية

          "summary": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.",

          "content": "Jérusalem (prononciation française /ʒe.ʁy.za.lɛm/), en hébreu : יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim (dénomination israélienne officielle) ; en arabe : القدس, al Quds  ou اورشليم, Ûrshalîm (dénomination israélienne officielle en arabe), est une ville du Proche-Orient ; sa vieille ville occupe une place centrale dans les religions juive et chrétienne, et une place importante dans la religion musulmane ainsi que dans le conflit en cours depuis la création d'Israël en 1948.\nEn 1947, dans son plan de partage de la Palestine mandataire, l'ONU dote Jérusalem d'un statut international, mais la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948-1949 aboutit à un partage de la ville entre occupation israélienne (Jérusalem-Ouest) et jordanienne (Jérusalem-Est). Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.\n\nMentions antiques, étymologie, autres noms\nMentions dans les textes antiques\nJérusalem est mentionnée pour la première fois dans des textes égyptiens dits « d'exécration » datant des XXe et XIXe siècles av. J.-C., période durant laquelle Canaan est vassal de l'Égypte pharaonique. La prononciation exacte de son nom ne ressort pas clairement des hiéroglyphes : on trouve Rushalimu, Urushalimu ou d'autres variantes.\nPar la suite, le nom de Jérusalem (Yeroushalayim) apparaît dans la Bible hébraïque, dans des textes grecs (dont le Nouveau Testament chrétien) et dans des textes latins, païens ou chrétiens. [réf. nécessaire]\n\nÉtymologies proposées par les spécialistes\nOn peut supposer[réf. nécessaire] que le nom de la ville évoque le culte du dieu Shalim (ou Shalimu), car il était courant alors d'appeler les cités du nom de la divinité locale. Le nom de « Jérusalem » renvoie donc probablement au culte de ce dieu cananéen, populaire dans le panthéon ouest-sémitique, divinité de la création, de l'exhaustivité[pas clair] et du soleil couchant. Le début du mot « Jérusalem » vient de uru, qui signifie « fondation » ou « ville fondée par », le sens primitif du nom est donc « ville fondée par Shalem » ou « sous la protection de Shalem ».\nUne étymologie détaillée a été donnée en 1859 par Nathaniel Philippe Sander et Isaac Léon Trenel : le nom de « Yeru-Shalem » provient selon eux de deux racines chaldéennes, YeRu (« ville », « demeure ») et ShLM, qui a donné les mots shalom en hébreu et salaam en arabe. Cette racine trilitère ShLM signifie aujourd'hui « paix », mais le sens initial était celui de la complétude, de l'achèvement, d'où dérive ultérieurement la notion de paix.\n\nChangements de nom sous l'Empire romain\nEn 130 après J.-C., l'empereur Hadrien donne à Jérusalem le nom romain d'« AElia Capitolina », Aelius étant le nom de gens d'Hadrien et Capitolinus en hommage au dieu Jupiter capitolin et procède à une refondation rituelle de la ville. Le nom couramment utilisé est Aelia.\nDevenue païenne, elle est la seule ville de l'Empire romain à être interdite aux Juifs, mesure qui reste en vigueur jusqu'à la conquête musulmane (638).\nEn 325, l'empereur Constantin lui rend son nom, mais la christianise.\n\nAprès la conquête musulmane (638)\nAprès la conquête de la région par l'armée musulmane du calife Omar en 638, elle devient en arabe Iliya (إلياء) ou Bayt al-Maqdis (« Maison du Sanctuaire »), équivalent de l'hébreu Beit ha-Mikdash (« Maison sainte »), expressions désignant le temple de Jérusalem ou la mosquée al-Aqsa (الاقصى), lieu du départ de l'ascension de Mahomet, située sur l'emplacement du temple juif détruit en 70.\n\nHistoire\nLa frise chronologique ci-dessous présente la succession des principales puissances ou dynasties qui ont administré Jérusalem.\n\nGéographie\nTopographie\nJérusalem, couvrant 126 km2, est localisée entre la mer Méditerranée (à 52 km) et la mer Morte (à 22 km), sur l'extrémité d'un plateau calcaire des monts de Judée (dont le mont Sion) à 745 m d’altitude moyenne, avec de fortes variations entre monts et vallées (de 700 à 800 m environ). Le mont Scopus culmine à 826 m au nord-est et la vallée du Cédron descend sous les 600 m.\n\nMonts\nLe point le plus élevé est le mont Herzl à l'ouest, avec 834 m.\nLes sept collines de Jérusalem sont une région vallonnée des montagnes de Judée, dont les longues extensions se poursuivent vers la plaine côtière à l'ouest et la vallée du Jourdain à l'est. En leur centre, Jérusalem est construite à quelque 700 mètres d'altitude sur cette série de collines : l'Ophel avec les monts Moriah, Herzl (הר הרצל) à l'ouest, des Oliviers (har HaZeitim) s'étendant sur plus de trois kilomètres avec les monts Sion, Scopus (הַר הַצּוֹפִים, har HaTsofim) au nord-est… Ces collines lui ont servi de défense naturelle par le passé et ont joué un rôle dans son développement au cours des siècles. Elles figurent actuellement des sortes de frontières invisibles entre les divers quartiers de Jérusalem.\n\nVallées\nLa cité est entourée de toutes parts de plusieurs vallées, parmi lesquelles celles au nord, proches du plateau, sont moins prononcées que celles situées dans les autres directions. Les deux principales se trouvent au nord-ouest de la ville actuelle.\nÀ l'est de l'ancien Temple, la vallée de Josaphat descend une partie de la ville pour devenir vallée du Cédron (nahal Kidron, נחל קדרון) ; elle sépare la Vieille ville du mont des Oliviers. La vallée Beth Zeita part du nord de la vieille ville actuelle et suit presque en parallèle la vallée du Cédron qu'elle rejoint au pied de l'extrémité nord-est de l'esplanade du Temple ; on y trouve des piscines (de Bethesda, d'Israël) alimentées par les pluies que charrie la vallée. À l'ouest, se trouve l'étroite vallée de la Géhenne (Guei Hinnom, גיא הנום) qui débute près de la porte de Jaffa où ici, elle prend parfois le nom de « vallée de Mamilla », se poursuit vers le sud puis bifurque vers l'est pour rejoindre la vallée transversale (débutant vers la porte de Jaffa et allant d'est en ouest) et celle de Kidron. Entre Kidron et Hinnom, et à l'ouest du mont Moriah, la fine vallée transversale du Tyropéon qui a été en partie comblée (et en partie par l'actuelle rue King David), commence au nord de la porte de Damas, entre dans la Vieille ville et continue sa route pour rencontrer la vallée latérale jusqu'à la Porte des Maghrébins (dite aussi « des Immondices »). Ces trois grandes vallées se rejoignent au sud de l'Ophel, notamment au niveau de l'actuelle piscine de Siloé, pour s'unir en Cédron qui s'élargit et poursuit sa course plus loin au sud-est, vers le désert de Judée et la mer Morte.\n\nClimat\nJérusalem possède un climat méditerranéen et dans une moindre mesure montagnard. Il est marqué par une forte chaleur et une forte aridité en été. Seuls quelques mois en hiver sont humides, en particulier février, où tombe plus de la moitié des précipitations totales annuelles. La neige survient une année sur trois, particulièrement en février ; certaines tempêtes ont fait beaucoup de dégâts, notamment en janvier 1992, avec 50 cm de neige, et en 1920, avec 97 cm.\n\nUrbanisme\nDémographie\nOn appelle Hiérosolymitains les habitants de Jérusalem.\nEn 1947, il y a 205 000 habitants dont 105 000 Arabes (51 %) et 100 000 Juifs (49 %) et autres dans le territoire incluant Jérusalem et les villes et villages proches dont Ein Kerem, Abu Dis, Bethléem et Shuafat. En 1967, il y a 263 307 habitants dont 195 700 Juifs (74 %) et 54 963 Arabes (21 %). En 2004, on compte 706 000 habitants dont 458 000 Juifs (65 %) (dont 200 000 à l’est) et 225 000 Arabes (32 %). En 2022, 59,4 % des habitants de Jérusalem sont juifs, 37,7 % musulmans et 1,3 % chrétiens.\nLa population chrétienne de Jérusalem est actuellement d'environ 16 000 personnes, soit moins de deux pour cent de la population de la ville, alors qu'elle représentait un quart de la population un siècle plus tôt.\nEn 2005, le taux de fécondité des populations juives et arabes de Jérusalem est identique pour la première fois avec 3,9 enfants par femme — conséquence de la baisse significative de la natalité arabe enregistrée depuis quelques années. Depuis cette date, la fécondité des populations juives (4,4 enfants par femme en 2022) a même largement dépassé celle des populations musulmanes (2,9 enfants par femme en 2022).\nUn autre aspect démographique est le déficit migratoire de la ville, puisque chaque année, les habitants quittant la ville sont de 6 000 ou 7 000 plus nombreux que ceux qui viennent s'y installer. La majorité part habiter dans la proche banlieue de Jérusalem où les coûts du logement sont nettement inférieurs.\n\nLa ville « trois fois sainte »\nLa ville de Jérusalem est considérée comme « trois fois sainte » car il s'y trouve les lieux les plus sacrés des religions juive et chrétienne et le troisième lieu saint de l'islam. Au total, on dénombre 56 lieux saints et une centaine d'autres de moindre importance, en majorité situés à Jérusalem-Est.\nLes trois lieux saints les plus célèbres sont :\n\nle mur, vestige du temple d'Hérode, appelé « mur occidental » par les juifs (HaKotel HaMa'aravi, en abrégé HaKotel) et « mur des Lamentations » par les chrétiens ;\nl'église du Saint-Sépulcre où est situé, selon la tradition chrétienne, le tombeau du Christ ;\nle mont du Temple, jadis site du temple de Jérusalem disparu et où se trouve aujourd'hui l'esplanade des Mosquées, (Haram al-Sharif[pas clair]) avec le dôme du Rocher et la mosquée al-Aqsa.\nJérusalem est donc un site exceptionnel pour les trois religions monothéistes.\n\nPour les Juifs\nJérusalem est importante pour les juifs depuis plus de 3 000 ans. Son nom est mentionné dans la Bible hébraïque 660 fois sous la forme habituelle et 158 fois sous la forme « Sion », nom d'une colline de Jérusalem employé métonymiquement pour la ville entière.\nJérusalem est en effet à la fois un lieu important dans les pérégrinations des patriarches racontées dans la Bible ; la capitale politique du royaume d'Israël de David et de Salomon, puis celle du royaume de Juda, plus tard celle du royaume hasmonéen ; le lieu de culte unique du Dieu unique, jusqu'à la destruction du temple de Jérusalem par les Romains.\nC'est à Jérusalem exclusivement que le culte officiel (notamment sous la forme de sacrifices effectués par les prêtres) avait lieu à l'époque des deux temples. Depuis la destruction de 70, il n'y a plus de sacrifices dans le judaïsme, le culte s'est totalement transformé avec l'apparition des synagogues.\nAprès la destruction du temple de Jérusalem en 587 av. J.-C. par Nabuchodonosor, durant l'exil à Babylone (en Mésopotamie) qui a suivi, le psaume 137 évoque fortement Jérusalem (« Si je t'oublie, Jérusalem, que ma main se dessèche... »). Dans ce cas, le retour a pu avoir lieu à la suite de la conquête perse et le temple a pu être reconstruit. Mais après la destruction effectuée en 70 sur ordre de l'empereur Vespasien, les juifs subissent une dispersion (« exil de Rome ») dans tout l'Empire romain. L'identité juive, constamment et intimement liée au souvenir de Jérusalem, la « fille de Sion », se maintient grâce à la transmission de l'héritage biblique et historique enseigné de génération en génération dans les communautés juives, jusqu'à l'apparition du mouvement sioniste à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nC'est à Jérusalem que, selon les textes, les Juifs devront attendre l'arrivée du Messie.\nDu temple de Jérusalem, il ne reste aujourd'hui debout qu'un mur de soutènement (kotel) couramment appelé mur des Lamentations, vestige du temple d'Hérode, devenu un lieu de prières juives, adossé au mont du Temple, devenu un haut lieu de l'islam (Esplanade des Mosquées.\nJérusalem est un lieu de pèlerinage à l'occasion des trois fêtes de pèlerinage (Pessa'h/Pâque, Chavouot, Souccot). Durant la Pâque juive, les mots « L’an prochain à Jérusalem » sont prononcés à la fin de chaque cérémonie.\nAprès chaque repas, la prière du Birkat HaMazon (bénédiction de la nourriture) mentionne Jérusalem.\n\nPartout dans le monde, la prière quotidienne du Juif pieux est toujours adressée en se tournant vers Jérusalem et bénit la construction de cette ville, tout en appelant au retour des exilés. « Puisse nos yeux voir votre retour dans la miséricorde à Sion », Amida.« Pour l’amour de Sion, je ne garderai pas le silence, pour Jérusalem je n’aurai point de repos », Is. 62:1.\n\nPour les chrétiens\nJésus à Jérusalem\nDepuis le Ier siècle, les récits de la vie de Jésus, notamment les Évangiles, font de Jérusalem le théâtre des derniers jours de Jésus lors de la Pâque juive, de sa venue au temple dont il expulse les marchands, de sa Passion, depuis son arrestation à sa crucifixion, puis de sa résurrection, point central des doctrines chrétiennes.\nDans certaines traditions, Jérusalem, précisément le mont des Oliviers, est l'endroit où a eu lieu l'ascension du Christ et c'est là que les chrétiens attendent son retour au jour du Jugement dernier.\n\nLieux saints chrétiens\nEn conséquence, on trouve à Jérusalem différents lieux de la Passion : le Cénacle (lieu du dernier repas avec les apôtres), la via Dolorosa (chemin suivi vers le lieu de la crucifixion), le jardin de Gethsémani (lieu de l'arrestation) au pied du Mont des Oliviers où se trouve l'église de l'Ascension, lieux de pèlerinage.\nOn y vénère aussi des souvenirs de la vierge Marie, de saint Étienne et de saint Jacques le Juste qui y ont été martyrisés, etc.\nSainte Hélène, mère de l'empereur Constantin (IVe siècle), puis les empereurs romains d'Orient et les empereurs byzantins y ont construit de somptueux sanctuaires sur les lieux saints, notamment sur le tombeau de Jésus.\n\nJérusalem dans l'histoire du christianisme\nTrès tôt apparait le concept de « Jérusalem céleste » (Livre de l'Apocalypse), repris notamment par Augustin d'Hippone au Ve siècle dans La Cité de Dieu.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège d'un des patriarcats historiques du christianisme, aux côtés de Rome, d'Antioche, d'Alexandrie et de Constantinople).\nElle devient très tôt un lieu de pèlerinage, le plus important du monde chrétien. L'irruption des musulmans au VIIe siècle pose un problème majeur aux chrétiens : les lieux saints sont désormais sous le contrôle de gouvernants non chrétiens, les califes de Damas, puis de Bagdad, puis d'autres dynasties régnant à partir de l'Égypte.\nLe lien très fort entre les chrétiens et Jérusalem aboutit à la fin du XIe siècle à l'épisode historique majeur des croisades en Terre sainte. En 1099 (première croisade), Jérusalem devient pour neuf décennies la capitale du royaume latin de Jérusalem. La ville est reconquise le 2 octobre 1187 par le sultan d'Égypte et de Syrie Saladin. Une troisième croisade est lancée en 1189, mais elle ne réussit pas à reprendre Jérusalem. La dernière croisade, la neuvième, a lieu en 1271-1272 : c'est un nouvel échec. Par la suite, l'idée de croisade persiste jusqu'à la fin du Moyen Âge, mais aucune expédition en Terre sainte ne peut être mise sur pied.\n\nPour les musulmans\nPour les musulmans, la sainteté de la ville provient de toutes les raisons précédemment citées et surtout à partir du XIIe siècle, du fait que selon la tradition, le prophète de l'islam Mahomet y aurait effectué son voyage nocturne (Isra) en 620 ap. J.-C.\nLe Coran ne mentionne pas explicitement le nom de la ville de Jérusalem mais les traditions l'associent à quelques passages du texte coranique. Le premier est le récit de la montée au ciel de Mahomet (al Mi'raj : l'ascension), accompagné par l'ange Gabriel, à l'emplacement de la « Mosquée la plus lointaine ». C'est en référence à ce récit que la mosquée de Jérusalem sur l'Esplanade des Mosquées (al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf, « Noble Sanctuaire ») a été appelée « al-Aqsa », ce qui veut dire « le plus éloigné », et identifiée comme telle au VIIe ou au VIIIe siècle. Absent donc du Coran, le nom de Jérusalem comme lieu du Voyage nocturne de Mahomet est, par contre, parfaitement explicite dans le récit d'Ibn Ishaq, rédigé 120 à 150 ans après l'Hégire (VIIIe siècle). Pour François Déroche, « une analyse récente fait cependant valoir que, d'après des traditions anciennes, ce voyage nocturne aurait été en direction du ciel ; c'est ultérieurement que l’exégèse classique aurait proposé de comprendre al-masjid al-Aqsâ comme le mont du Temple et fait de ce dernier le point de départ de l'ascension de Mahomet ».\nDe même, selon les traditions musulmanes, les premiers musulmans priaient en direction de Jérusalem - choix communément « interprété comme une tentative en vue de convertir les Juifs de Médine et des environs » ; la direction de la Ka'ba de La Mecque est établie par Mahomet plus tard, en 624. Si le texte coranique mentionne un changement de qibla, il ne cite pas la ville de Jérusalem. Enfin, s'appuyant sur des traditions juives et chrétiennes, l'islam reconnait dans l'expression « l'endroit proche », le lieu du Jugement dernier, à Jérusalem.\nL'islamologue Pierre Lory indique que « la sacralité de Jérusalem était déjà présente aux premiers siècles de l’Hégire, comme en témoignent les mosquées omeyyades. Mais son poids s’est accru à partir des XIe et XIIe, et s’est encore accentué à l’ère moderne ». Pour les musulmans, Jérusalem se voit reconnaître les critères du lieu saint islamique : « nombril de la terre, haut lieu, sanctuaire privilégié ». Ces trois qualités lui étaient déjà appliquées par la tradition juive, et dès le début de l'islam, des Juifs convertis à la religion musulmane, tels Ka‘b al-Ạhbār et Wahb b. Munabbih, « introduisent dans le corpus primitif, des éléments midrashiques les attribuant à cette ville ». Quant à la notion de « mémorial prophétique », elle s'inscrit dans la tradition islamique (Jérusalem est la cité des prophètes (nabî) David (داوود, Dāwūd) et Salomon (سُلَيْمان, Sulaymān), comme le Coran les décrit), et dans le fait qu'« elle a servi de point de départ pour le mi‘rāj, l'Ascension de Mahomet au ciel » ; ainsi, elle a eu un rôle fondamental dans la piété populaire et mystique.\nL'islam a déclaré Jérusalem comme étant sa troisième ville sainte, mais son statut pour l'islam « connut des hauts et des bas. ». Si les hadiths et les traditions musulmanes lui reconnaissent une place importante, elle est très fortement critiquée dès les premiers siècles de l'islam. La dimension religieuse de Jérusalem se développe principalement à partir de 1144 et de l'apparition du religieux dans le discours politique de Zengi dans sa lutte contre les royaumes francs ; les mots masjid Al-Aqsa (« la Mosquée la plus lointaine »), issus du Coran, ne figureront sur cette même mosquée qu'au XIe siècle.\nCe changement de rapport à Jérusalem s'observe par les critiques s'élevant du monde musulman contre le démantèlement des fortifications de Jérusalem en 1219 et la cession de la ville à Frédéric II en 1229, alors que la conquête de la ville par les croisés de la Première croisade, au XIe siècle, n'avait pas créé de telles réactions. « Cette faiblesse [de la sainteté de Jérusalem] aurait tenu tout d'abord au fait qu'une bonne partie des docteurs de la Loi s'opposait à la place d'honneur que les mystiques musulmans voulaient accorder à la ville ».\n\nAdministration et politique\nLa ville tient également une place importante dans les sentiments nationaux israélien et palestinien. L’État d’Israël a fait de Jérusalem-Ouest sa capitale en 1949 (la Jordanie occupant le reste de la ville) puis a fait de Jérusalem « réunifiée » sa capitale après la conquête de la ville en 1967. Bien que de manière générale, ce soit le pouvoir exécutif d'un pays qui choisisse sa propre capitale où siègent ses institutions fondamentales, la grande majorité des pays du monde ont depuis retiré leur ambassade de la ville, contestant à Israël ce choix de 1967. Pour la communauté internationale, Jérusalem-Est est considérée comme « occupée ».\n\nJérusalem a été proclamée « capitale éternelle » d'Israël en 1980 puis capitale de la Palestine en 1988, bien que l'autorité palestinienne n'y siège pas. Selon la communauté internationale, le statut de la ville doit faire l'objet de négociations entre Israéliens et Palestiniens.\n\nLimites administratives\nLa municipalité israélienne administrait 38 km2 de la ville avant la guerre des Six Jours. La municipalité jordanienne ne couvrait que les 6 km2 dont la Vieille ville. Le conseil des ministres israélien du 26 juin 1967 étend le territoire municipal à 71 km2 incluant des terres en bordure des villes d'Al-Bireh, Ramallah et Bethléem. Après la loi de Jérusalem de 1980, un amendement du 27 novembre 2000 fixe définitivement les limites de la municipalité dont la surface est en 2016 de 125 km2.\n\nQuestion du statut de Jérusalem\nLe statut de la ville, intégralement sous administration civile israélienne depuis la guerre des Six Jours, est contesté. La « ligne verte » séparait auparavant Jérusalem-Ouest (Israël) et Jérusalem-Est (territoire occupé par la Jordanie) depuis les accords d'armistice israélo-arabes de 1949. Ces accords indiquent explicitement que la ligne d'armistice ne préjuge pas des revendications territoriales ultérieures. En particulier l'accord israélo-jordanien stipule dans son article VI.9 : « Ces lignes de démarcation sont agréées par les parties sans préjudice d'accords ultérieurs ou d'accords frontaliers ultérieurs ou de revendication ultérieures des parties ». La tentative de confirmation de ces lignes d'armistice en frontières a échoué à la conférence de Lausanne de 1949 (27 avril-12 septembre). Elle avait été convoquée par la commission de conciliation des Nations unies. Finalement les accords d'armistice n'ont pas été enregistrés par les Nations unies qui ont néanmoins contribué à leur surveillance. Ils ont fait l'objet d'une garantie par les membres occidentaux du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies (États-Unis, France, Royaume-Uni). C'est la déclaration tripartite du 29 mai 1950. Entre-temps, la Chambre des députés jordanienne et la Chambre des notables a voté le 24 avril 1950 l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est et de la Cisjordanie.\nLa loi fondamentale israélienne du 30 juillet 1980 déclare que « Jérusalem unifiée [est la] capitale éternelle et indivisible d’Israël ». La résolution 476 et la résolution 478 du Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU estiment que le vote du Parlement israélien constitue « une violation du droit international » et appelle les « États qui ont établi des missions diplomatiques à Jérusalem de retirer ces missions de la Ville sainte ». Elles réaffirment que « l'acquisition de territoire par la force est inadmissible », qu'il doit être mis fin à l'occupation de Jérusalem et que « les dispositions législatives et administratives prises par Israël… n'ont aucune validité en droit et constituent une violation flagrante de la convention de Genève… ». Le Conseil de sécurité mentionne dans ses attendus la ville sainte de Jérusalem, en effet, la délimitation de la vieille ville est la seule internationalement établie.\n\nLe 31 juillet 1988, le roi Hussein déclare à la télévision que la Jordanie abandonne ses revendications de souveraineté sur la Cisjordanie et Jérusalem-Est à l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine. Pour autant, cette déclaration n'a pas de valeur en droit international. Le 26 octobre 1994 le Traité de paix israélo-jordanien est signé. Les frontières internationales entre Israël et la Jordanie sont fixées. Mais, le statut des territoires « …sous contrôle militaire israélien depuis 1967 », c'est-à-dire notamment Jérusalem-Est, est réservé. Il est néanmoins précisé que « le rôle spécial » du royaume de Jordanie sur les lieux de pèlerinage musulmans de Jérusalem est reconnu. Une priorité sera accordée à ce rôle historique lors des négociations sur le futur statut permanent de la ville, ceci conformément à la Déclaration de Washington du 25 juillet 1994. En 2000, l'Autorité palestinienne vote une loi établissant Jérusalem capitale d'un futur État, cette loi est ratifiée en 2002. Pour les parties en présence, le statut de Jérusalem reste une question clé de la résolution du conflit israélo-palestinien. En décembre 2003, l'Initiative de Genève, plan de paix alternatif établi par les anciens partenaires des négociations de Taba, prévoit, dans le cadre d'un règlement global du conflit israélo-palestinien, le partage de la souveraineté sur Jérusalem qui serait la capitale des deux États, les quartiers arabes et l'esplanade des Mosquées étant sous souveraineté palestinienne.\nLa question de la légitimité de chacune des deux parties sur Jérusalem entraîne également des débats d'ordre archéologique. Les Israéliens ont entamé depuis 1967 des recherches pour tenter d'apporter des preuves du Temple de Jérusalem. Palestiniens et Israéliens s'accusent réciproquement de mener des travaux, les uns pour détruire des preuves archéologiques de cette existence, les autres pour fragiliser les fondations des mosquées de la vieille ville. D'après les experts israéliens, les fondations des mosquées ont été fragilisées par plusieurs tremblements de terre au cours des derniers siècles. La discussion sur l'utilisation des expressions mont du Temple/esplanade des Mosquées (Haram al Sharif) est significative par rapport aux soucis des deux parties de gagner la bataille de la légitimité sur Jérusalem.\n\nPosition d'Israël\nAprès la déclaration d'indépendance de l'État d'Israël en 1948 et la guerre qui s'ensuivit, la ville se retrouve divisée entre une partie occidentale annexée par Israël et une partie orientale (comprenant toute la vieille ville) annexée par la Jordanie, séparées par un no man's land. En 1949, Jérusalem-Ouest est proclamée capitale d'Israël.\nEn 1967, lors de la guerre des Six Jours, Tsahal conquiert Jérusalem-Est et Israël déclare Jérusalem réunifiée, sa capitale éternelle et indivisible. Toutefois, en 1996, aucun État n'avait reconnu cette annexion et aucun n'y avait alors d'ambassade ; la situation a évolué depuis lors et plusieurs États (dont les États-Unis) ont déplacé leur ambassade à Jérusalem car l'ONU a jugé nulle et non avenue cette modification du statut de la ville (résolutions 476 et 478 du Conseil de Sécurité). Israël a confirmé la gestion de l'esplanade qui reste depuis lors sous la juridiction d'un organisme musulman, le Waqf.\nEn 1980, dans une des lois fondamentales d'Israël, la Knesset déclare Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible : c'est la Loi de Jérusalem. Les différents pouvoirs israéliens, législatif, exécutif, judiciaire et administratif, sont regroupés à Jérusalem.\nEn 2000 au sommet de Camp David II, Ehud Barak propose de donner la souveraineté palestinienne sur certains quartiers de Jérusalem comme Abou Dis (où se situe l'université al-Qods) ainsi qu'une gestion autonome des quartiers palestiniens. L'échec de ce sommet met fin à ces négociations. En 2005, la question du statut et de l'éventuel partage de Jérusalem reste au cœur du futur processus de paix mais aucune tentative de négociations n'a plus été entamée sur ce point depuis le sommet de Taba.\n\nPosition de l'OLP et de l'autorité palestinienne\nDès le début du Mandat britannique et tout au long de leur combat nationaliste, les Palestiniens ont revendiqué le contrôle de l'ensemble de la Palestine, avec Jérusalem pour capitale mais sans pouvoir concrétiser ses revendications.\nLors de la proclamation d'un État palestinien par l'OLP en 1988, Jérusalem est choisie comme capitale. L'OLP de Yasser Arafat s'est souvent positionnée dans le sens de ces revendications refusant d'avoir une autre capitale que Jérusalem. L'OLP possédait à Jérusalem un siège officieux, la « Maison d'Orient », dirigée par Fayçal Husseini ; en 2001, cette institution a été fermée de force en représailles à la suite d'un attentat. Jérusalem est par ailleurs la ville d'origine de réfugiés palestiniens qui souhaitent revenir y vivre. La question du statut final de la ville est ainsi intimement liée à la question des réfugiés palestiniens.\n\nPosition du Saint-Siège\nLe Saint-Siège n'accepte pas l'annexion de Jérusalem par Israël. Il préconise « un statut spécial, internationalement garanti et déclare moralement et juridiquement inacceptable toute décision et action unilatérale qui modifie son caractère spécifique et son statut ».\n\nPosition de l'ONU\nLa position de l'ONU concernant Jérusalem est liée à la Résolution 181 de l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies (le plan de partage de la Palestine) ainsi qu'aux résolutions de l'Assemblée générale et du Conseil de sécurité qui en découlent.\nLe Conseil de sécurité, dans ses résolutions 476 et 478, déclare que la loi israélienne établissant Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible est nulle et non avenue, et constitue une violation du droit international. La résolution invite les États membres à retirer leur mission diplomatique de la ville.\nDans sa dixième session extraordinaire réunie en urgence le 21 décembre 2017 après la décision du président américain Donald Trump de déplacer l'ambassade américaine à Jérusalem, l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies a demandé aux États de s'abstenir d'établir leur ambassade à Jérusalem et déclaré nulle et non avenue toute décision contraire. Malgré les pressions des États-Unis, la résolution a été largement adoptée par 128 voix pour, 9 voix contre et 35 abstentions.\n\nPremière proposition de l'ONU\nÀ l'expiration du mandat britannique, le plan de partage de la Palestine de novembre 1947 prévoyait que Jérusalem et Bethléem deviennent un corpus separatum sous contrôle international et indépendant de ce qui devait devenir un État arabe et un État juif. Cette séparation devait ainsi garantir à tous les cultes le libre accès à tous les lieux saints en sécurité. Le Comité spécial sur la Palestine avait prévu qu'après un délai de dix ans de corpus separatum, le statut définitif de Jérusalem serait fixé par la population consultée par référendum.\n\nHistorique des résolutions\nLes résolutions suivantes ont été adoptées par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies. Elles concernent Jérusalem de manière tacite (résolution 252) ou explicite pour toutes les résolutions ultérieures :\n\n1968 : résolution 252\n1969 : résolutions 267 et 271\n1971 : résolution 298\n1980 : résolutions 465, 476 et 478\n1996 : résolution 1073\n\nPositions internationales\nDans le passé, avant 1973, certains pays africains, y compris l'Éthiopie et la Côte d'Ivoire, avaient des ambassades à Jérusalem. En 1973, après la guerre du Kippour, de nombreux pays africains décident de rompre leurs relations diplomatiques avec Israël.\nAvant la résolution 478 votée en 1980, 13 pays avaient une ambassade à Jérusalem : la Bolivie, le Chili, la Colombie, le Costa Rica, la République dominicaine, l'Équateur, le Salvador, le Guatemala, Haïti, les Pays-Bas, le Panama, l'Uruguay, le Venezuela. Suivant les termes de cette résolution, les 13 ambassades ont été déplacées à Tel Aviv. Les ambassades du Costa Rica et du Salvador ont de nouveau été déplacées à Jérusalem en 1984, jusqu'en 2006 où ces deux États décident de transférer de nouveau leurs ambassades à Tel Aviv.\n\nLe Congrès des États-Unis a voté le 8 novembre 1995 le Jerusalem Embassy Act qui reconnaît Jérusalem comme capitale de l'État d'Israël, demande que la ville demeure indivise et prévoie des fonds pour y déplacer l'ambassade américaine avant le 31 mai 1999. Cependant le déménagement de l'ambassade a été reporté par la signature de dérogation tous les six mois, jusqu'au 6 décembre 2017, quand le président Donald Trump, revendiquant une nouvelle approche sur le conflit israélo-palestinien, officialise internationalement la reconnaissance par les États-Unis de Jérusalem comme capitale, et donne des instructions pour y transférer l'ambassade.\nLa décision de Donald Trump tranchait sur la politique de la Maison-Blanche de Barack Obama dont le porte-parole, par exemple, à l'occasion de l'éloge mortuaire de Shimon Peres, corrigeait l'expression « Jerusalem, Israel » en supprimant le mot « Israel ». La décision de Trump a été condamnée par des alliés de Washington et par l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies. Le roi saoudien a déclaré qu'elle risque de provoquer « la colère des Musulmans », trois jours après que son fils a proposé à Mahmoud Abbas de renoncer à Jérusalem-Est comme capitale.\nLes États-Unis inaugurent officiellement leur ambassade à Jérusalem le 14 mai 2018, suivis par le Guatemala le 16 mai et le Paraguay le 21 mai. Toutefois, le Paraguay annule cette orientation trois mois plus tard sur décision de son nouveau président, Mario Abdo.\nDans une déclaration au Figaro publiée le 30 novembre 2009, le ministre français des Affaires étrangères d'alors, Bernard Kouchner, déclare : « Pour nous, Jérusalem doit être, à la fois la capitale de l'État d'Israël et du futur État palestinien ».\nLe 8 décembre 2009, l’Union européenne appelle Israël à partager Jérusalem comme capitale conjointe de deux États hébreu et palestinien. Les Vingt-Sept assurent qu’ils « ne reconnaîtront aucun changement autre que négocié » au statut d’avant 1967.\nLe 15 décembre 2018, l'Australie décide de reconnaître Jérusalem-Ouest comme capitale d’Israël, mais sans procéder au transfert de son ambassade installée à Tel-Aviv. Le Premier ministre Scott Morrison conditionne le transfert de l’ambassade à la conclusion d’un improbable accord de paix et annonce projeter de n'ouvrir à Jérusalem qu'un bureau chargé de la défense et du commerce. Le 18 octobre 2022, la ministre des Affaires étrangères, Penny Wong, annonce le retrait de la décision du précédent gouvernement.\nEn septembre 2023, le Premier ministre de Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée James Marape fait de la Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée le cinquième pays (après les États-Unis, le Guatemala, le Honduras et le Kosovo) à établir son ambassade auprès d'Israël à Jérusalem. Cette décision intervient à la suite d'un lobbying dans ce sens de la part d'églises chrétiennes en Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée.\nEn septembre 2025, le Premier ministre fidjien Sitiveni Rabuka est présent à son tour à l'inauguration de l'ambassade fidjienne à Jérusalem, en présence du Premier ministre israélien Benyamin Netanyahou. Il répond ainsi à l'exigence du parti Sodelpa, parti de la droite chrétienne autochtone, qui est membre de son gouvernement de coalition.\n\nQuestion démographique\nStatistiques\nEn 1967, les autorités israéliennes recensent 66 000 Palestiniens résidents dans le territoire annexé par Israël, dont 44 000 de Jérusalem-Est, occupée par la Jordanie. Aucun Juif ne vivait à Jérusalem-Est, du fait de l'expulsion en 1948 par l'armée jordanienne. L'ONU a critiqué Israël dans plusieurs résolutions et considère que des mesures administratives ou législatives altérant la composition démographique de la ville n'a aucune validité.\nMiron Benvisti, politologue israélien et ancien adjoint à la mairie de Jérusalem, qui a longtemps écrit dans le journal « Haaretz », remarque qu'il n'y a pas de statistiques officielles et considère que la proportion démographique n'a pas changé. L'ancien secrétaire général du Congrès juif mondial (CJM) et analyste du Moyen-Orient, Dan Diker (en), critique le concept de judaïsation, entre autres, car Jérusalem était à majorité juive jusqu'à l'occupation jordanienne. Selon Diker, la population arabe de la ville est passée de 26,6 % en 1967 à 31,7 % en 2000 et le nombre de constructions dans les quartiers arabes est plus important que dans les quartiers juifs. Depuis le début des années 2010, le nombre d'enfants par femme devient plus élevé dans la population juive, en raison du nombre croissant de ménages ultraorthodoxes (250 000 habitants) et du départ des laïcs vers d'autres villes israéliennes. La population juive bénéficie en outre d'une espérance de vie nettement plus élevée (83,3 ans pour les Juifs et 73,3 ans pour les Arabes). En contrepartie,l'âge moyen de la première maternité est plus bas chez les femmes arabes que chez les femmes juives, rapprochant les générations.\n\nPolitique et territoires démographiques\nIl existe un débat quant à la volonté politique qu'aurait Israël de modifier l'écart démographique à l’est, peuplé essentiellement par les Palestiniens en 1967.\n\nEn 1980, Israël passe la loi de Jérusalem proclamant Jérusalem une et indivisible et avec des frontières municipales étendues. Le politologue Frédéric Encel le comprend comme une façon de « détruire l’influence palestinienne en modifiant l’équilibre géographique de la ville »[réf. nécessaire]. Il faut ajouter à cela les colonies juives relativement proches de la ville : au nord (Giv'at Ze'ev), au sud (Kedar) et à 7 km à l’est (Ma'aleh Adumim), ce qui augmente le nombre de Juifs dans la région aux alentours de Jérusalem, d'un périmètre de 440 km2[réf. nécessaire]. De nos jours, une ceinture de colonies s'est mise en place à Jérusalem-Est pour séparer les quartiers palestiniens du reste de la Cisjordanie occupée.\n\nLes limites municipales de la ville ne reposent pas totalement sur des territoires accordés par le droit international à l’État d’Israël et la construction de la barrière de séparation impose de fait des frontières non reconnues à l’est de Jérusalem. Les quartiers arabes seraient selon certains[Qui ?], victime d'une politique d'encerclement par les limites municipales de 1967. Jérusalem-Est faisait 38 km2 en 1967, sous l'occupation jordanienne. Et par l'effet de cette limite de municipalité, 108 km2 par la construction de quartiers juifs. Cet état de fait est accentué par le tracé du projet de barrière de séparation qui pourrait encercler Maale Adoumim à 11 km à l'est de Jérusalem. La barrière est destinée, selon Israël, principalement à réduire le nombre d'attentats terroristes palestiniens. Selon l'ONG palestinienne LAW (affilée à la Commission internationale de juristes) : « Israël continue à appliquer des mesures arbitraires et incompatibles avec le droit international pour chasser les Palestiniens de Jérusalem et les remplacer par des Juifs, de façon à cimenter son autorité sur la ville. Cette politique revêt des formes diverses : confiscation des cartes d'identité, retrait des permis de résidence, système fiscal injuste, refus du permis de construire. La politique de permis de construire, que le Conseil économique et social des Nations unies et Amnesty International jugent discriminatoire envers les Palestiniens, et la destruction de maisons appartenant à des Palestiniens affectent également la population arabe de Jérusalem-Est. ».\n\nÉconomie\nHistoriquement, l'économie de Jérusalem était centrée principalement sur les pèlerinages religieux et maintenant plus généralement sur le tourisme, et les entreprises publiques de l'État d'Israël. Depuis la création de l’État d’Israël, le gouvernement est demeuré un acteur majeur dans l'économie de la ville. Il ne génère pas seulement un grand nombre d'emplois mais œuvre à offrir les conditions propices à la création d'entreprises.\nBien que Tel Aviv reste le centre financier d'Israël, un nombre grandissant de sociétés high tech quittent Tel Aviv pour Jérusalem. La zone industrielle Har Hatzvin située au nord de la ville accueille plusieurs grandes sociétés comme Intel, Teva Pharmaceutical, et ECI Telecom.\nParmi les principales industries de Jérusalem, citons les fabriques de chaussures, le textile, l'industrie pharmaceutique, les produits de métaux, et les articles imprimés. Les usines sont situées surtout dans la zone industrielle d'Atarot au nord, le long de la route de Ramallah.\nJérusalem affiche, en 2023, un taux de pauvreté de 43 %. Les disparités sont importantes entre la population juive (32 % de pauvres) et arabe (61 %). Elles se retrouvent également dans le décalage entre Jérusalem-Ouest et Jérusalem-Est, en partie lié à la surdensité de l'habitat et aux sous-investissements : seuls 10 % du budget municipal reviennent à la partie orientale de la ville, qui représente 37 % de son territoire et 40 % de sa population. Le secteur Ouest concentre par ailleurs institutions et grands centres commerciaux.\n\nArt et culture\nPierre de Jérusalem\nEn application d'un décret de 1918, toutes les constructions nouvelles et les restaurations patrimoniales effectuées à Jérusalem sont réalisées essentiellement en pierre calcaire dite « pierre de Jérusalem », particulièrement la catégorie grey gold (« or gris ») issue des monts de Judée aux alentours de la capitale israélienne, utilisée déjà dans l’Antiquité — et servant encore de nos jours pour les édifices publics ou bâtiments privés.\n\nMonuments et archéologie\nOn trouve à Jérusalem un grand nombre de monuments religieux et historiques, comme le Mur occidental — aussi appelé mur des Lamentations — la mosquée al-Aqsa et le dôme du Rocher, l'église du Saint-Sépulcre. La Vieille Ville est complètement ceinturée de murailles qui datent du XVIe siècle. De nombreux sites archéologiques existent à Jérusalem, notamment les écuries de Salomon, la Cité de David.\n\nMusée national d'Israël\nFondé en 1965, le Musée national d'Israël est l'un des plus riches du Moyen-Orient avec près de 500 000 œuvres. Ce musée encyclopédique contient des collections issues de fouilles archéologiques de la préhistoire à l'époque moderne, et de dons importants provenant de tous les continents. Chacune de ses cinq ailes thématiques trouve son public : Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Judaïca (ethnologie juive), Sanctuaire du Livre (les plus anciens manuscrits bibliques au monde, dits manuscrits de la Mer morte, des grottes de Qumran), Jeunesse et médiation culturelle où certains programmes stimulent la compréhension entre jeunes juifs et arabes. Y figurent aussi la spectaculaire maquette de Jérusalem à l'époque du Second Temple (Ier siècle) avant sa destruction par les Romains, des répliques à l'identique de synagogues européennes du XVIIe siècle, et le célèbre Jardin d’art Billy Rose, conçu par le sculpteur nippo-américain Isamu Noguchi, tenu pour être l’un des plus beaux jardins d’art sculptural du XXe siècle, où se déroulent festivals, spectacles de danse ou concerts de qualité au milieu de nombreuses aires de détente. Ce vaste musée, sur un campus de plus de 80 000 mètres carrés, accueille près d'un million de visiteurs par an dont un tiers de touristes. Outre les programmes proposés sur son campus principal, le Musée d'Israël se déploie sur deux autres établissements de Jérusalem : la Maison Ticho (exposant des œuvres d'artistes de toutes disciplines) liée à l'École des beaux-arts Bezalel, institut centenaire sur le mont Scorpus, et le musée Rockefeller (archéologie de la terre d'Israël et de Palestine), édifice érigé en 1938.\n\nMusée des pays de la Bible\nLe Musée des pays de la Bible de Jérusalem est le seul musée d'histoire au monde qui explore et retrace la civilisation et la culture de tous les peuples mentionnés dans la Bible. Ses trésors archéologiques des cultures du Proche-Orient remontent de la préhistoire jusqu'à la rédaction du Talmud, au début de l'ère chrétienne. Il dispense en outre des conférences sur tous les aspects culturels de la région. Ce musée a acquis une renommée internationale en tant que centre universel pour la programmation culturelle et éducative.\n\nMusée d'art islamique\nLe musée d'art islamique fondé par la mécène britannique, Lady Vera Salomons, a ouvert ses portes en 1974 et est le seul de son genre en Israël. Il contient l'une des plus importantes collections au monde d'art islamique allant du VIIe au XIXe siècle, avec plus de 3 000 pièces rares en provenance d'Égypte, Syrie, Irak, Iran, Turquie, Afghanistan, Inde ou Espagne, qui instruisent sur les raffinements du monde artistique et culturel musulman. Une collection permanente d'œuvres est présentée face à des expositions temporaires qui lui font toujours écho. En outre, le musée expose la collection Salomons de montres et horloges remarquables. Il développe aussi des partenariats culturels, éducatifs ou événementiels en Israël et à l'étranger pour établir des ponts culturels et promouvoir le dialogue entre arabes et juifs, conformément aux vœux de sa fondatrice et de son illustre famille.\n\nParcs\nLe parc Rabinovitch également désigné sous le nom de Mifletzet (Monster) Park, contient une sculpture monumentale de Niki de Saint Phalle : Le Golem commandée à l'artiste par Teddy Kollek, maire de Jérusalem en 1971, inaugurée en 1972. Ce même parc contient aussi un stabile d'Alexander Calder, réalisé en 1976/1977 sous le titre Hommage à Jérusalem, comparable à l'Araignée Rouge du même artiste.\nLe Monstre et le stabile sont tous deux situés sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de Jérusalem.\nUn autre parc intitulé le Zoo biblique de Jérusalem, contient un grand nombre de sculptures monumentales d'animaux, réalisées par Niki de Saint Phalle en 1994 que l'artiste a réunis sous le titre L'Arche de Noé.\n\nVie sociale\nReligion\nJérusalem est une ville qui revêt une importance religieuse significative pour trois grandes religions monothéistes : le judaïsme, le christianisme et l'islam. Ces religions considèrent Jérusalem comme un lieu saint et sacré, ce qui en fait l'une des villes les plus contestées et les plus sensibles sur le plan religieux et politique.\n\nÉducation\nJérusalem accueille de nombreuses universités prestigieuses offrant des cours en hébreu, arabe et en anglais. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1925 ; elle fait depuis partie des 100 meilleures universités du monde et accueille des professeurs et étudiants de toute confession. Albert Einstein ou Sigmund Freud ont fait partie du conseil de ses gouverneurs. L'université compte parmi ses anciens élèves quelques lauréats du prix Nobel dont les universitaires Avram Hershko, David J. Gross et Daniel Kahneman.\nLe travail des étudiants et chercheurs est facilité par la bibliothèque nationale d'Israël, qui dispose de près de cinq millions de volumes. La bibliothèque a ouvert ses portes en 1892, près de trente ans avant la première université. C'est le site où figure le plus grand nombre de livres à thème hébraïque. Aujourd'hui, elle réunit la bibliothèque nationale et la bibliothèque universitaire. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem est composée de trois campus, l'un au mont Scopus, l'autre à Guivat Ram, et le campus de médecine au centre médical Hadassah.\n\nL'université al-Qods a été fondée en 1984 et son campus principal est situé à Abu Dis (plus précisément en \"zone B\", sous contrôle israélien et palestinien) au sud-est de la ville, sur près de 19 hectares. Il existe quatre autres sites de l'université al-Qods développés dans l'agglomération de Jérusalem, à Jérusalem-est (Haram) à Sheikh Jarrah, Beit Hanina ou Ramallah. L'université accueille des universitaires locaux et de pays arabes  pour enseigner à 13 000 étudiants venus des régions de Jérusalem, Bethléem, Hébron, Jénine, Jéricho, Naplouse, Ramallah, Tulkarem et Qalqilya, dans les domaines des arts, sciences et technologie, ingénierie, administration, économie, éducation, médecine, para-médecine, dentisterie, santé publique, pharmacie, droit, fondements de la religion ou études coraniques et islamiques.\nL'université al-Qods a fait l'objet de controverses quant à la pratique de la liberté d'expression.\nD'autres instituts d'études supérieures dans Jérusalem sont l’Académie de musique et de danse de Jérusalem et l’École des beaux-arts Bezalel dont les bâtiments sont situés sur le campus de l'université hébraïque de Jérusalem.\nLa faculté des Technologies de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1969 et offre un enseignement d'ingénierie et de hautes technologies industrielles de réputation mondiale. Différents cursus y sont organisés, notamment en bio-informatique, en chimie numérique ainsi que des programmes spéciaux tels que Education For Ethiopians.\n\nCritiques\nL'enseignement pour les Arabes de Jérusalem et d'Israël est critiqué pour sa qualité inférieure à celle de l'enseignement pour les Juifs. De nombreuses écoles de l'Est de Jérusalem sont remplies à leur capacité maximum, au point qu'on enregistre des plaintes contre la surpopulation. Cependant, la municipalité de Jérusalem est en train de construire plus d'une douzaine de nouvelles écoles dans les quartiers arabes de la ville. Les écoles dans Ras el-Amud et Umm Lison ont ouvert en 2008 En mars 2007, le gouvernement israélien propose un plan sur 5 ans de construction de 8 000 nouvelles classes dans la ville, dont 40 % dans le secteur arabe et 28 % dans le secteur haredim. Un budget de 4,6 milliards de shekels a été accordé pour le projet. En 2008, un philanthrope britannique a fait un don de 3 millions de dollars américains pour la construction d'écoles dans la partie arabe de l'Est de Jérusalem. Les lycéens arabes passent le Bagrut (en), comme examen, la majeure partie de leur programme d'études est identique à celui des autres écoles secondaires israéliennes et comprend certains sujets portant sur la culture juive.\nLes autorités israéliennes font fermer en mai 2025 les écoles de l'ONU destinées aux enfants palestiniens dans la partie annexée de Jérusalem. Les forces israéliennes ont expulsé les enfants présents sur les lieux et placardé un ordre de fermeture indiquant que les écoles fonctionnaient illégalement en l'absence d' « autorisation.» Le commissaire général de l’UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, a qualifié cette décision de « violation du droit international », rappelant que « ces écoles sont des lieux inviolables appartenant aux Nations unies ». L’Autorité Palestinienne la qualifie de « violation du droit des enfants à l’éducation ».\n\nSanté\nListe des hôpitaux et centres médicaux de Jérusalem :\n\nCentre pédiatrique de Réinsertion Alyn\nHôpital Augusta Victoria\nHôpital Bikur Holim\nCentre médical Hadassah (Ein Kerem)\nCentre médical Hadassah (mont Scopus)\nHôpital Hansen\nHôpital Herzog\nHôpital Kfar Shaul (hôpital psychiatrique spécialisé dans le « syndrome de Jérusalem »)\nHôpital de l'université Al-Qods (Muqased)\nCentre médical Shaare Zedek\nHôpital ophtalmique St. John\nHôpital St-Joseph\nHôpital St-Louis (spécialisé aujourd'hui dans les soins gériatriques et palliatifs)\nHôpital Summit\n\nQuelques quartiers\nLa plupart des quartiers de Jérusalem-Ouest ont été construits en deuxième partie du XIXe siècle, quand la Vieille ville n'était plus en mesure de contenir sa population croissante, du fait des différents mouvements migratoires et de son propre développement.\n\nLe Moshav Ha-Germanit (« Colonie allemande ») est l'un des quartiers les plus huppés de la capitale, situé à son sud-est dans le district de Katamon. Fondé en 1873, il tient son nom des Allemands protestants du mouvement sectaire « Temple Society » en conflit avec l'Église d'État, qui avaient considéré Sion comme leur deuxième patrie pour s'y exiler. Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les descendants de ces Templiers, la plupart devenus nazis, sont expulsés. Aujourd'hui, le quartier a gardé ses agréables maisons aux volets en bois et à toit de tuiles rouges, entourées de jardins, qui sont habitées par une population d'origine plutôt européenne et aisée. L'environnement offre une réelle qualité de vie avec un Musée de la Nature, un ancien monastère arménien, une école d'art dramatique, une piscine olympique, nombre de terrasses ombragées de cafés et de restaurants à dimension humaine.\n\nMéa Shéarim (lit. « cent portes » ; sens « cent mesures ») est un quartier de Jérusalem situé au nord-ouest de la vieille ville. C'est l'un des cinq premiers quartiers juifs construit en 1874 en dehors de celle-ci. À l'origine, il était beaucoup moins étendu qu'aujourd'hui et ne comportait qu'un bloc de bâtiments qui existe toujours. Le quartier originel était composé de petites maisons de deux pièces pour une dizaine de personnes chacune qui, serrées les unes contre les autres, formaient un rempart naturel. Refermé sur lui-même, le quartier comportait des portes d'accès qui étaient fermées la nuit. Il est très connu car c'est un quartier où vivent exclusivement des Juifs ultra-orthodoxes. La majorité des hommes ne travaillent pas, consacrant leur vie à la seule étude de la Bible, ce qui fait de ce quartier l'un des plus pauvres de Jérusalem. Aux entrées de Méa Shéarim, les habitants du quartier ont installé de nombreux écriteaux destinés aux visiteurs incitant ces derniers à ne pas rentrer dans ce quartier vêtus de manière « indécente ».\n\nMamilla est un quartier d'habitation et de commerce situé à l'extérieur ouest de la porte de Jaffa. Avant la guerre des Six Jours, il figurait une sorte de zone-frontière et l'endroit était délaissé par les pouvoirs publics. Après 1967, il bénéficie d'un vaste programme de réhabilitation et rénovation urbaines achevées en 2007 sous la houlette du célèbre architecte israélien, Moshé Safdie. Ce concepteur respecte l'empreinte du XIXe siècle en intégrant à ce nouvel espace de vie un grand nombre de structures historiques restaurées à l'identique et de nouvelles dans le même esprit, en utilisant une pierre de Jérusalem vieillie. Entre autres, s'y trouvent un secteur résidentiel dit « David village », une longue allée piétonne pavée au sein d'un centre commercial à ciel ouvert, bordée des vitrines de magasins d'enseignes locales ou internationales, et de restaurants attirant nombre de visiteurs qui bénéficient à son extrémité d'une vue spectaculaire sur la vieille ville, la Tour de David à proximité et le mont Sion. Ce quartier permet aussi la visite de l'antique piscine de Mamilla au centre de l'ancien cimetière musulman sur une partie duquel le futur musée de la Tolérance ouvre ses portes et fait l'objet d'une polémique internationale. L'endroit offre en outre des parcs verdoyants, des centres culturels (comme le Musée de la musique hébraïque, le Musée Nahon d'art juif italien ou le centre événementiel de la Création juive, Beit Avi Chaï) qui côtoient l'ancien Palace Hotel ottoman Art déco devenu le luxueux Waldorf Astoria ou le fameux hôtel King David, l'hôpital gériatrique français St-Louis construit en 1881 et ayant permis une percée dans les murailles de la vieille ville, dite « Porte Neuve » à l'époque ottomane, le monastère des Sœurs du Rosaire fondé en 1880 et accueillant les pèlerins depuis 1960, ou le Consulat de France.\n\nSport\nLes deux sports les plus populaires sont le football et le basket-ball. Le Beitar Jérusalem Football Club, dans le championnat d'Israël de football, est le plus connu en Israël, ayant été vainqueur cinq fois de la coupe d'Israël de football. Jérusalem compte une autre équipe de football, le Hapoel Katamon F.C., vainqueur une seule fois de la coupe d'Israël de football, qui est en troisième division, la liga Artzit.\nEn basket-ball, le Hapoel Jérusalem joue dans la première division. Le club a gagné le championnat d'Israël de basket-ball trois fois, et la coupe ULEB en 2004. Inauguré en 1992, le stade Teddy Kollek est le plus grand stade de football de Jérusalem avec une capacité de 21 000 places.\nLe marathon de Jérusalem a été créé en 2011 malgré quelques protestations. Le huitième marathon s'est tenu en mars 2018 avec une participation de 35 000 concurrents dont 4 000 étrangers. Le parcours commençait près de la Knesset pour continuer vers le marché de Mahané Yehuda, le mont Scopus, la Vieille Ville, la tour de David. L'invité d'honneur était l'Éthiopien Haile Gebrselassie.\n\nInstitutions israéliennes\nInstitutions nationales d'Israël\nJérusalem est le siège de plusieurs institutions de l'État d'Israël, notamment la Knesset (assemblée nationale) et la Cour suprême, les bureaux du Premier ministre et différents ministères.\nLe cimetière national d'Israël, avec notamment les tombeaux de Theodor Herzl et de sa famille, se trouve sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de la ville.\nLa Bibliothèque nationale d'Israël se trouve dans les locaux de l'université hébraïque, sur le site de Guivat Ram.\n\nInstitutions universitaires\nOn y trouve aussi des institutions universitaires, dont certaines antérieures à la création d'Israël :\n\nl'université hébraïque de Jérusalem, fondée en 1918, avec quatre sites, dont trois (mont Scopus, Guivat Ram et Ein Kerem) dans la municipalité de Jérusalem ;\nle centre Yad Ben-Zvi (recherche historique et archéologique), fondé en 1947, situé dans le quartier de Réhavia\nOn peut noter la présence de l'École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, fondée en 1890 et située dans la vieille ville.\n\nAutres\nC'est à Jérusalem que se trouve le plus grand centre mondial pour la mémoire de la Shoah, Yad Vashem, situé sur le mont Herzl.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège de l'Organisation sioniste mondiale et les congrès sionistes mondiaux y ont lieu depuis 1951, alors qu'auparavant la ville la plus fréquente était Bâle, lieu du premier congrès en 1897.\n\nInstitutions palestiniennes\nTransports\nTransport aérien\nL'aéroport le plus proche est celui d'Atarot, au nord de Jérusalem (31° 51′ 53″ N, 35° 13′ 09″ E), qui a été utilisé pour les vols intérieurs israéliens jusqu'en octobre 2000 notamment pour les vols vers Eilat, et est désormais placé sous le contrôle de Tsahal en raison de sa proximité géographique avec les territoires autonomes palestiniens. Depuis lors, les vols ont été transférés vers l'aéroport Ben Gourion, proche de Tel Aviv à une quarantaine de kilomètres au nord-ouest.\n\nTransports routiers\nLa coopérative d'autobus Egged, deuxième plus grande compagnie d'autobus dans le monde, dessert la plupart des localités autour de Jérusalem et gère les services d'autocars vers le reste du pays depuis la gare routière centrale sur la rue Jaffa, près de l'entrée ouest de Jérusalem.\nLa gare routière de Jérusalem-Est se situe rue du Sultan Suleiman, proche de la porte de Damas. Elle dessert les localités palestiniennes de Cisjordanie.\n\nTransports ferroviaires\nJérusalem est relié par le chemin de fer à Tel Aviv depuis 1892 (ancienne ligne de Jaffa à Jerusalem (en)). Son service a été interrompu en 1998 en raison du mauvais état des infrastructures qui furent alors rénovées. Elle a été rouverte dans sa totalité en avril 2005, avec l'inauguration de la nouvelle gare de Jérusalem Malha, située dans le sud de la ville.\nUne seconde ligne abusivement qualifiée de liaison à grande vitesse en provenance de Tel Aviv, la ligne de chemin de fer Tel Aviv–Jérusalem, au nord de cette première ligne, est ouverte en 2018. Elle est électrifiée et utilise plusieurs longs tunnels pour permettre le passage à grande vitesse des trains de la côte à la région montagneuse de Jérusalem. Les trains font terminus dans la gare souterraine de Binyanei HaUma nommée Yitzhak Navon située sous la gare routière centrale. Le trajet de Tel Aviv à Jérusalem prend environ 28 minutes.\n\nTramway\nLa première ligne de tramway, ouverte le 19 août 2011 et prolongée le 27 février 2025 sur 22,5 km, dessert 35 stations depuis Neve Yaakov au nord-est jusqu'au Centre médical Hadassah à Ein Kerem au sud-ouest. Cette ligne est équipée de rames Citadis, construites par Alstom et de rames Urbos, construites par CAF.\nChoisie pour exploiter cette ligne dans le cadre du consortium CityPass, la société Veolia Transport s'est trouvée confrontée à des critiques et s'est retirée dès 2010. L’exploitation est assurée par le groupe israélien de transports Egged.\n\nJumelages\nNew York (États-Unis) depuis 1993\n Prague (Tchéquie)\n Ayabe (Japon) depuis le 9 février 2000\n\nJérusalem-Est\nFès (Maroc) depuis 1982 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n Rabat (Maroc) depuis 2012 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n\nBlason et drapeau israélien de Jérusalem\nLe lion en posture rampante (dressé sur ses pattes arrière), représente le Lion de Juda, l'arrière-plan représente le Mur occidental et les rameaux d'olivier représentent la paix.

          "summary": "Jérusalem (prononciation française /ʒe.ʁy.za.lɛm/), en hébreu : יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim (dénomination israélienne officielle) ; en arabe : القدس, al Quds  ou اورشليم, Ûrshalîm (dénomination israélienne officielle en arabe), est une ville du Proche-Orient ; sa vieille ville occupe une place centrale dans les religions juive et chrétienne, et une place importante dans la religion musulmane ainsi que dans le conflit en cours depuis la création d'Israël en 1948.\nEn 1947, dans son plan de partage de la Palestine mandataire, l'ONU dote Jérusalem d'un statut international, mais la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948-1949 aboutit à un partage de la ville entre occupation israélienne (Jérusalem-Ouest) et jordanienne (Jérusalem-Est). Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.",

          "content": "## Overview\nJerusalem (Hebrew: ירושלים Yerushalayim, Arabic: القدس al-Quds) is the largest city of Israel. Israel claim it is their capital and a few countries including the United States recognize that claim, but most other countries and the United Nations do not.\nThe ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years. The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center. Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel. Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.\nJerusalem of Gold, as it has come to be known in Hebrew, is a fascinatingly unique place where the first century rubs shoulders with the twenty-first century, each jostling for legitimacy and space, and where picturesque \"old\" neighborhoods nestle against glistening office towers and high-rise apartments. It is one of those places that have to be seen to be believed.\n\n## Understand\nLocated in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea, Jerusalem is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is the holiest city in Judaism and Christianity, having been the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE, and the third-holiest in Islam. It has a history of nearly 4000 years, and has been fought over and conquered countless times in that period. While the city began to have a Jewish plurality in the late 19th century, today a wide range of national, religious, and socioeconomic groups are represented here. During the Jordanian occupation 1949-1967 all Jews in East Jerusalem were expelled and entry was barred for Israeli citizens of any faith and even today there tend to be more Muslims in east Jerusalem and more Jews in West Jerusalem.\nThe walled area of Jerusalem, which until the 1860s formed the entire city, is now called the Old City, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. It consists of four ethnic and religious sections—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters. Barely one square kilometer, the Old City is home to Jerusalem's most important and contested religious sites - the Western Wall and Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christians.\nSurrounding the Old City are more modern areas of Jerusalem. The civic and cultural center of modern Israel is in western Jerusalem, while Arab neighborhoods can be found in the east. Jerusalem became Israel's capital upon its independence. The city was reunited after the 1967 War when Israel captured East Jerusalem. Nowadays there is no visible sign of the pre-1967 border, but Jewish and Arab neighborhoods are still generally separate.\n\n## History\nArchaeological findings show development within present-day Jerusalem as far back as the 4th millennium BCE, but the earliest written records of the city come in the Execration Texts (c. 19th century BCE) and the Amarna letters (c. 14th century BCE). According to Biblical accounts, the Jebusites (a Canaanite tribe) inhabited Jerusalem until c. 1000 BCE, at which point the Israelites (led by King David) conquered the city, establishing it as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. Throughout this period, Jerusalem was located in what is now known as the \"City of David\", just outside the current Old City walls to the southeast, where a large natural spring is located.\nAccording to the Bible, after David died, his son Solomon built the first of two Holy Temples. The temples were north of the City of David, on a site underneath or very close to the current Dome of the Rock. Upon Solomon's death the kingdom split in two (though many historians contend that the two Israelite kingdoms were never united to begin with). The ten northern tribes became known as the Kingdom of Israel, while Jerusalem remained the capital of the southern Kingdom of Judah, ruled by David and Solomon's descendants. After the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem was the center of the only remaining Israelite/Jewish kingdom. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah including Jerusalem, destroying the temple and exiling many of the inhabitants.\nIn 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to Judah and Jerusalem. The rebuilt (Second) Temple was completed in 516 BCE. Jerusalem regained its status as capital of Judah and center of Jewish worship for nearly six centuries. Jerusalem would remain under Persian control until the conquest by Alexander when it would come under Greek (first Ptolemaic, later Seleucid) control. In the second century BCE, the Hasmonean family led a successful rebellion against the Seleucid Greek rulers of Judea, establishing an independent Jewish state which lasted over 100 years. This era is described in the deuterocanonical book of Maccabbees and an event during the recapture of Jerusalem is the basis of the celebration of Hannukkah. In about 19 BCE, Herod the Great (a Jewish client king under Roman rule) vastly expanded the temple area by building retaining walls to support a flat rectangular platform around the temple site. One of these retaining walls survives to this day as the Western Wall, and the platform survives as the Temple Mount.\nThe Great Jewish Revolt against Roman rule broke out in 66 CE. Its failure resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. A second failed revolt (132-136 CE, led by Simon Bar Kochba) led to Jews being banned from entering Jerusalem, a policy which continued for most of the time until the Muslim conquest.\nFor the following five centuries, the city remained under Roman/Byzantine rule. Under Emperor Constantine I in the 4th century, Jerusalem became a center for Christianity, with the construction of sites such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Muslim forces conquered Jerusalem in the year 638. According to tradition, their leader Caliph Umar visited Jerusalem and established the Temple site as a place of prayer. By the end of the 7th century, a subsequent caliph, Abd al-Malik, had commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock on this spot, as well as al-Aqsa Mosque on the southern edge of the Temple Mount. Muslim traditions vary about whether Muhammad's flight to heaven was from the Dome of the Rock or from al-Aqsa.\nIn the four hundred years that followed, Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Muslim powers in the region jockeyed for control. In 1099 the First Crusade captured Jerusalem. The crusaders killed almost all Jews still living in the Holy Land as well as a large portion of the Muslims. Immigration from Europe only partially compensated for this loss in population as many crusaders left after the fighting was over. The Knights Templar were established in Jerusalem and had their official headquarters on the Temple Mount. The Muslim ruler Saladin reconquered Jerusalem in 1187, but between 1228 and 1244, it was given by Saladin's descendant al-Kamil to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Jerusalem fell again in 1244 to the Khawarizmi Turks, who in 1260 were replaced by the Egyptian Mamelukes. In 1517, Jerusalem fell to the Ottoman Turks, who then controlled the Holy Land until the First World War. The current Old City walls were built by the Ottomans shortly after 1517.\nIn the 1860s, new neighborhoods were built outside the walls for the first time. This expansion of Jerusalem was fueled both by general urbanization and by immigration, as Jews and Muslims and to a lesser extent Christians came to Jerusalem for its spiritual and cultural significance. By the late 19th century, Jerusalem had a Jewish plurality. The 19th century also saw a weakening of the Ottoman Empire, and major European powers like France and Russia tried to play the role of \"Guardian of the Holy Sites\" and protector of both the local Christians and pilgrimage. One consequence of those power struggles was the Crimean War, another a seemingly fragile \"status quo\" regarding the Christian Holy Sites that while sometimes seemingly ridiculous (one stipulation is that a certain ladder must not be moved) has nonetheless kept conflicts to a minimum and allowed pilgrimages to occur surprisingly smoothly despite all the political turmoil the region experiences.\nIn 1917, the British Army captured the city. The League of Nations, through its 1922 ratification of the Balfour Declaration, entrusted the United Kingdom to administer the Mandate of Palestine as a Jewish national home. The period of the Mandate saw the construction of new garden suburbs in the western and northern parts of the city, and the establishment of institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University.\nAs the British Mandate of Palestine was expiring, the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended \"the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a corpus separatum under the administration of the United Nations.\" However, this plan was rejected by the Arabs. At the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem found itself divided between Israel and Jordan (then known as Transjordan). The ceasefire line established through the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan cut through the center of the city. In 1949, west Jerusalem became Israel's capital. After the 1967 war, all of Jerusalem was claimed by Israel as its capital. Israel has since annexed the entirety of East Jerusalem and treats it as part of its territory and distinct from the West Bank (though few other countries accept this annexation). Arab residents of East Jerusalem can apply for Israeli citizenship, but for various reasons few have actually made use of that option.\n\n## Demographics\nJerusalem's population of around 800,000 is about 62% Jewish, 35% Muslim, 2% Christian, and 1% other. Neighborhoods tend to be overwhelmingly Jewish or Muslim; there are few really mixed neighborhoods, though many neighborhoods have a small minority of people from other religions. However, it is common for people of all religions to meet in the workplace. The Jewish population is a mix of cultures, with many immigrants from the former USSR, North Africa, Iraq, Eastern Europe, the US, and other places. Due to Jerusalem's religious significance, clergy and laypeople from many groups have moved to Jerusalem and continue to do so. A notable past example were the Temple Society, a group of German Pietists who were expelled before World War II but whose \"German colony\" still stands.\nJerusalem is generally regarded by Israelis to be a conservative and religious city, in contrast to liberal Tel Aviv. Compared especially to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem is noted for its large number of religious Jews, ranging from Conservative Jews to the Haredim ('ultra-Orthodox'). Haredim also tend to self-segregate for various reasons and you'll find most of them in a few overwhelmingly Haredi neighborhoods.\nThe demographic history of Jerusalem over the last two hundred years is interesting and somewhat contentious. Jerusalem became a plurality Jewish city in the 19th century, and was a majority Jewish city throughout the British Mandate. However, then as now many Jerusalem Jews were Haredi and rejected Zionism. The 1948 war led to the forced displacement of all Jews (Zionist or not, immigrant or rooted in the area for centuries) from East Jerusalem and the Old City, including the historic Jewish quarter. From 1948-1967 the Jordanian government prohibited Jews from living in East Jerusalem and tried to erase traces of the Jewish past. Some Jews who have settled in East Jerusalem since 1967 see their actions thus as nothing but a \"return\" after the forced absence under Jordanian control. Arabs (whether Chrisitian or Muslim) living in East Jerusalem in 1967 were given a status as permanent residents and an option to acquire Israeli citizenship should they want it. However, most have rejected Israeli citizenship for various reasons.\n\n## Climate\nLocated near the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea, Jerusalem has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Due to its relatively high elevation (600 m-800 m above sea level) Jerusalem's air is less humid and more pleasant than in most other parts of Israel.\nWinters are often wet, with nearly all of Jerusalem's annual 590 mm (23 in) of precipitation occurring between October and April. However, in between the rainy days there are numerous clear and sunny days. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 12 °C (53 °F) and an average low of 4 °C (39 °F). Sub-freezing temperatures are rare, but do happen, and the city will get occasional snowfall during the winter, though it usually only lasts a matter of hours rather than days. Once every few years, the city will experience significant accumulating snow.\nSummers are hot and dry as a bone with virtually no rainfall between the months of May and September. Temperatures will generally approach around 30 °C (88 °F) during the day and cool to around 15 °C (59 °F) at night. Being near the desert, there is often a big difference between the day and night temperatures, and even the hottest days can turn into chilly nights. Spring and fall are mild, with minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, though heat-waves are not unheard of. Most evenings and nights are quite windy and long pants and a shirt are recommended.\n\n## Talk\nThe main languages spoken in Jerusalem are Hebrew in West Jerusalem and Arabic in East Jerusalem. Remember that Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left. Some Haredi (ultra Orthodox) Jews speak Yiddish in daily life, in part because they see using Hebrew for mundane things as blasphemous.\nThere is a significant number of Jews speaking Russian or French. Smaller groups of Jews speak Dutch and Spanish. It is not uncommon to see signs in Russian or hear Russian language radio.\nMost people in the tourist areas of the city speak English that is sufficient for communication. In particular, English is widely spoken in the areas most visited by tourists, especially in the Old City. Usually, even if you don't find an English speaker on your first try, there will be one nearby. There is also a relatively large number of Jews who have immigrated to Jerusalem from English-speaking countries, and in the tourist areas of Jewish Jerusalem they make up about a quarter of the population.\n\n## By plane\nIsrael's main entry point for the international traveler, 32.00944434.8827781 Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV IATA), is next to the highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Highway 1). Travel from the airport to the center of Jerusalem takes 40–50 minutes, or more if there is traffic.\nBy train - A train line from the airport to Jerusalem opened in 2018. See \"By train\" below.\nBy bus - Route 485 (Afikim) runs between the airport terminal and Jerusalem. As of November 2022, it only runs on late Thursday nights/Friday mornings (previously it ran 24/6 excluding Shabbat), and one can expect that the 485 will be eliminated entirely once the current train construction project finishes. The 485 runs nonstop from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, then makes a few more stops in the Knesset/museums area. It departs hourly, on the hour, in both directions, and costs ₪16 (you pay the driver when boarding). After getting off in Jerusalem, you can take the local bus, light rail, or taxi to your final destination. The bus stop towards the airport is on 31.7888535.204321 220 Yafo St., just outside the central bus station, 100–150 m east of the main bus station exit.\nBy taxi - The official Jerusalem-airport taxi price is around ₪250 during the day, ₪300 late at night. You might be able to find a driver for somewhat cheaper, but chances are they will drive recklessly. If you order in advance, companies like Daka 99[dead link] may offer rates as low as ₪160. Your taxi driver may either take Highway 1 or road 443 (which goes through the West Bank).\nBy shuttle - The 'Nesher' shared taxi service (+972 2 623 1231 - Hebrew and English) is a 10-seat minibus that runs approximately hourly services to/from the airport, 24/7. Fare is around ₪70 one way per person. From the airport, the shuttle waits on the curb outside the Terminal 3 arrival hall - follow signage to the Jerusalem shuttle. The shuttle departs when full, and will take you to the address of your choice in Jerusalem. Going to the airport, you must reserve your seat in advance by phone. Be on time for the pickup — they don't wait. Nesher is known for rude customer service, and for a long nauseating ride as the other 9 passengers are dropped off at their addresses before you (you always seem to be last!). Keep in mind that it is quicker, more comfortable, and usually cheaper to take the 485 bus, and a local taxi between the bus station and your hotel.\nSome Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are seen as \"no go zones\" by Israeli Jews, and some taxi drivers, including shared taxis, may hesitate or even refuse to take you to these destinations. You should understand that it is only because they genuinely fear for their own safety. If you have a hard time finding a taxi to East Jerusalem, take a taxi from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, and there switch to a local taxi.\nTaxi drivers, including shared taxis, have been known to overcharge or shortchange, so check the price before boarding, and check your change when it is handed back to you.\nBuses and trains do not run from Friday after 4 PM to 8 PM on Saturday. Taxis and the Nesher shuttle operate, but might charge you extra due to Shabbat time.\nIf you see Atarot Airport on old maps, it is a small airport 11 kilometers (7 miles) north of the Old City, which has not been used for international flights since the Six-Day War, and has been closed since 2001 and is about to be demolished.\n\n## By train\nIn general, see rail.co.il for fares and timetables.\n31.78821935.2024392 Jerusalem-Yitzhak Navon station (next to the Central Bus Station).      (updated Feb 2025)\nSince its launch in 2018, the train has been the most convenient way to get to the city from Tel Aviv and the airport. The train journey time from Tel Aviv is 35 minutes, and 20 minutes from Tel Aviv Airport. The train to Jerusalem runs every 30 minutes Sunday to Thursday. Except for the night trains between midnight and 6AM which run every hour. (Except for the nights between Tuesday and Wednesday and between Friday and Saturday when there are no night trains) On Friday, the train runs every hour until 2PM in winter or until 4PM in summer, and on Saturday from 8PM time in winter or 10PM in summer.\n\n## By bus\nBuses are the main form of public transportation in areas not served by the light rail. Jewish and Arab bus companies run separate bus networks in Jerusalem, serving Jewish and Arab neighborhoods respectively, although there is some overlap.\nThe Arab bus network, in East Jerusalem, is run by Al-Safariat Al-Mowahadda (\"The united traveling service\"). It mainly consists of lines running radially to Arab neighborhoods from two bus stations near Damascus Gate.\nThe Jewish bus network is run by three bus companies, which are:\n\"Egged\", which serves the southern parts Jerusalem along with some lines in the northern parts of Jerusalem,\n\"Superbus\", which operates the trunk lines, and\n\"Extra\", which serves the northern parts of Jerusalem.\nIt serves everywhere in West Jerusalem, as well as the Old City and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. It is more useful for tourists, and also easier to get information about. Unlike Arab buses, its fare is integrated with the light rail (one ticket will get you unlimited rides on bus and light rail for 90 minutes after your first boarding). Also unlike Arab buses, Jewish buses do not operate on the Sabbath.\nMost routes run every 15–20 minutes or better. City buses have a fixed fare of ₪5.9, paid upon boarding. Keep your receipt as proof of payment in case of inspection.\nYou must use \"Rav Kav\" for payment. Note, you can't pay the driver.\n\n## By shared taxi\nOn the Sabbath, and very late at night, your only option other than a private taxi is a sherut (shared taxi). These depart from Tel Aviv's Central Bus Station and Ben Gurion Airport, and charge a small surcharge on top of the normal bus fare. As of mid-2012 a sherut costs ₪23 (₪28 at night, ₪33 at Shabbat) and drops you off downtown, not far from Zion Square. There are no Israeli sherut lines within Jerusalem (unlike most Israeli cities). But there are sherut lines to Tel Aviv and Beit Shemesh as well as the airport.\nShared taxis are also the best option if travelling between Jerusalem and Palestinian cities in the West Bank, especially Ramallah and Bethlehem. These leave from near the East Jerusalem bus terminals outside the Damascus Gate. There is a shared taxi direct to/from the Allenby bridge (The border crossing with Jordan), for (Feb 2019) ₪42 plus ₪5 per luggage or 10 JD for 1 seat plus 1 luggage (picking up from Al-Souq Al-Tijaree \"The commercial souq\" not far away from the main bus station). All Palestinian shared taxis are very cheap, ₪5.00 for the surrounding villages, ₪5.50 for Abu-Dis and ₪6.50 for Ramallah.\n\n## Get around\nGetting around Jerusalem used to be tricky, time-consuming, and frustrating as the terrain and age of the city left clogged roads unable to handle modern population numbers. The building of the light rail line has mitigated this but where the light rail doesn't go the going may still be slow.\n\n## By taxi\nCabs are plentiful in the city of gold. You can probably flag one down quickly by walking to the nearest busy street. Just in case this doesn't work, it is good to have the number of a cab company ready, or to install the Gett smartphone app.\nBe warned as the drivers may try to rip you off by \"taking the scenic route\" or charging a fixed price instead of on the meter. Insist that the driver turns on the meter (moneh) and you should have no problems. If the driver will not activate the meter, get out and take a different one. If you have the meter on, cabs are relatively cheap.\nNote that a private taxi is called \"moneet\" in Hebrew, and \"taxi\" by Arabs. Both differ from the shared taxi (\"sherut\" or \"servees\"), which runs fixed routes for many people like a bus. However, unlike buses sherut do not take rav-kav.\n\n## By car\nDriving a car in Jerusalem is not recommended. In the central areas (roughly between the Central Bus Station and the Old City), the main streets are mostly reserved for public transportation, and the streets cars can go on are narrow and very confusing to navigate.  Then, when you reach your destination, there will be no place to park your car.  Elsewhere in the city, it is easy to drive, but still hard to find parking. If you can't use public transportation, taxis are probably a better option than cars.\nIf you insist on visiting the Old City by car, park in the Karta garage in Mamilla, close to Jaffa Gate. Only Old City residents are allowed to drive into the Old City.\n\n## By light rail\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail line opened in 2011. It links the north-eastern neighborhoods to the south-western neighborhoods, runs along the western side of the Old City, and passes through the city center. There are plans to construct additional lines. Its opening after long delays and controversy (not least because it crosses the 1949 armistice line) was a godsend for transportation in the city and where it does go, it is easily the best option.\nThe light rail runs past many areas of interest to tourists. Listed from east to west:\nthe Old City (Damascus Gate and City Hall stations)\nthe West Jerusalem city center - King George and Ben Yehuda streets (Jaffa Center station)\nthe Mahaneh Yehuda market (Mahane Yehuda station)\nthe Central Bus Station (Central Station)\nMount Herzl and Yad Vashem (Mount Herzl station)\nThe ticket price is the same as bus fare (₪5.9) with free transfers between them. When you get on, tap your Rav-kav card against the reader and make sure a green light is displayed.\nThe light rail runs from about 05:30 to midnight. Its frequency is every 6 minutes during the day and less often at night. Like buses, it does not run on the Sabbath.\n\n## On foot\nWhile Jerusalem is built in a mountainous area, the central areas of the city are rather flat and very walkable. Due to the altitude, the humidity level of Jerusalem is much lower than most cities in Israel, making walking quite pleasant. The Old City has to be toured by foot, not only because it is more impressive this way, but also because its narrow lanes and alleyways are mostly inaccessible to cars.\n\n## By bike\nJerusalem has bike paths, but the rights of cyclists are not always respected: you will frequently find bike paths blocked, and drivers will expect cyclists to give right of way, though they will not intentionally harm you if you force the right of way.\nBike rentals are available at the Abraham Hostel (67 Hanevi'im, Davidka square), as well as at Bilu Bikes (7 Bilu), among other places.\nA bike sharing program called Jerufun, including both regular and e-bikes, exists in the city. There are various subscription options as well as one-time rental. The program has fairly good coverage in Western Jerusalem.\nBike Jerusalem. This 3-5 hour guided tour covers most of Jerusalem's historical neighborhoods, including many places that most visitors never get to see. The tour includes The Knesset, The Valley of the Cross, Rehavia and Talbia, The German Colony, Mishkanit Shananim, Jaffa Gate the Russian Compound and Nachlaot. The ride goes through side streets, short cuts and alleys. Despite the hills around Jerusalem, the ride in the city is not as hard as people tend to think, and the ride can be modified to suit families and inexperienced riders. The Jerusalem Night ride includes a ride through the empty streets of the Old City.\n\n## See\nJerusalem has an amazing array of attractions for the traveler to see. The following are some of the must-sees. For more attractions see individual district articles.\n\n## Old City\nThe Old City is the atmospheric historical core of Jerusalem, surrounded by Ottoman period walls, filled with sites of massive religious significance and a bustling approach to life. (Please note that some sites, particularly Islamic ones, may bar members of other religions from entry or praying on the grounds.)\nThe most iconic site in Jerusalem is the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary, which is holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. Jews all around the world usually face the Temple Mount when they pray. It is crowned by the magnificent gold-and-blue Dome of the Rock, which stands on the site of the ancient Jewish Temples. It also includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque (The Far Mosque), from where the Muslim prophet Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven.\nThe Western Wall (Jewish) is a retaining wall of the Temple Mount, built 2000 years ago. It is the closest place Jews can go to the site of the Temple, so for hundreds of years it has been a destination for prayer, and for placing notes with prayers in the cracks between the wall's stones.\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre (Christian). At the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of the sorrows) in the Christian quarter of the Old City. It is the holiest site in the world for Christians. The first church on the site was built by Queen Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, the Holy Sepulchre is Jerusalem's number 1 site for Christian pilgrims and is consequently horribly crowded. Expect to queue for an hour or more to enter the tiny tomb chamber.\nThe Jewish Quarter was completely re-built in 1969 after it came under Israeli control in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It still holds many ancient masterpieces such as the Hezekiah's wall (700 BCE), Burnt House (70 CE), Cardo (550 CE), and Western Wall. At the Western Wall plaza you will find The Western Wall Tunnel and the Chain of Generations center. The nearby archaeological park Davidson Centre (the Ophel) is also interesting. Inside the quarter are The Hurba Synagogue, the largest synagogue in the old city, and The Herodian Quarter museum.\nVia Dolorosa - passing through Bethesda (crusader church and Roman excavations), Franciscan Archaeological Museum and Les Seurs de Sion Monastery with its underground Roman Street\nDamascus Gate is the most elaborate gate.

There are two different routes: the northern route starts from inside the old city by the Jaffa gate and circles the Christian quarter and the Muslim quarter. The southern route starts from outside the Jaffa gate and circles the Armenian quarter and the Jewish quarter.\nWestern Wall Tunnels is a tour that is well worth your time. The guides there are well versed in the history of the wall and the explanation of the first two temples and the subsequent construction of the Dome of the Rock will create a great picture of the conflict between relevant cultures. Reservations are recommended, but individual walk-ins can sometimes be squeezed in.\nThe City of David water tunnels tour is interesting. It is located down the road from the Dung Gate (near the Western Wall), follow the signs. The tour lasts around 2 hours and starts with a description of the City of David. It culminates in a 25 minute walk through the water channel cut to bring fresh water into Jerusalem from a nearby spring. Sandals and a torch are required! The water is ankle deep for most of the tour.\nMahane Yehuda is the main outdoor market of West Jerusalem. Large, loud, and labyrinthine, the market boasts a huge number of stalls, generally open Sunday to Thursday 08:00-20:00, and F 08:00-15:00, closed Shabbat. Fresh produce, pastries, spices, salads abound. Definitely the place for a bargain and a unique insight into traditional Israeli culture. When the shops close in the evening, the night life opens up - in the last few years the Shuk has become a destination for bars, restaurants, and music at night.\nJerusalem is an amazing city for children and children's events.

While the Old City walls always look dramatic, they look even more spectacular for one week each June, when artists from around the world come and illuminate the Old City with their creations. Every year this festival is more popular, and involves more of the Old City, than the year before.\nHutzot HaYotzer - International Arts and Crafts Festival. A large fair featuring hundreds of artists and artisans displaying and selling their works, as well as performances, concerts, and other events.

The center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). The campus offers tours of the main building, and hosts weekly concerts.\n\n## Buy\nIf shopping in the Old City's markets, where almost anything can be found, be prepared to haggle. You will find beautiful and unique gifts here including jewelry, bed covers, statues, and spices, as well as more touristy goods like T-shirts with memorably funny designs.\nFor Judaica, the Old City's Jewish Quarter, Mea Shearim (dress modestly), Ben Yehudah St, and Emek Refaim are good places to look.\nThe new city center, around the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, is a great place to buy things and just hang out.\nThe Mamilla pedestrian mall just outside Jaffa Gate is a picturesque place to walk, and has a good selection of upscale international clothing stores.\n\n## Eat\nJerusalem, being a multicultural city, has food from all countries, cultures and tastes. Besides the ubiquitous falafel stands, there is European, Ethiopian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern food. There is also a large range of prices, from the ritzy Mamilla and Emek Refaim, to falafel stands surrounding Machaneh Yehuda and the Central Bus Station. A good rule of thumb is to look for restaurants filled with Hebrew or Arabic speaking locals. For falafel, the busiest place is probably the best, because falafel balls become less tasty the longer they are waiting out of the deep fryer.\nIf you keep kosher, Jerusalem is a wonderful place to visit. In the Jewish sections of the city almost everything is kosher. However you should still check for the kashrut certificate on the wall. If you don't see it and the staff cannot show it to you, it's a good sign to move along. The certificate is stamped בשרי (\"basari\", meat) or חלבי (\"halavi\", dairy). The current Jerusalem certificates are cream colored for normal certification, light purple for stricter certification (\"mehuderet\"), and marbled brown colored for strictest supervision (\"mehadrin\"). Certificates are valid for 6 or 12 months at a time (typically until Pesach or Rosh Hashana) with the expiration date prominently marked. Note it is not unusual for it to take a few days to get the new certificate up. In Haredi areas, the municipal kashrut certificate may be missing, but a certificate from a local Haredi organization will be provided. Also note that only some branches of McDonalds in Jerusalem are kosher. Kosher branches have yellow arches on a blue background, rather than the usual red background.\nDespite its name, the \"Jerusalem artichoke\" has no connection to Jerusalem, and you won't find it used more widely here than elsewhere.\nHowever, there is an authentic Jerusalem food - the Jerusalem mixed grill (me'orav yerushalmi), which was invented in the 1960s at one of the steakhouses near the Mahaneh Yehuda market and has since spread widely across Israel. It consists of a mixture of spicy grilled meat chunks including chicken breasts, hearts, and livers, and pieces of lamb. Nowadays you can get it as fast food wrapped in pita or laffa bread, or as a main course in sit-down restaurants. One famous place is Steakiyat Hatzot, Agrippas street; check out the photos on the wall.\n\n## Drink\nMost of the nightclubs and bars are in West Jerusalem, mostly in the city center or Talpiyot district. Consult the district article for specifics.\nIf you are looking for alcohol stores, there is one right by the Jaffa gate and several on Jaffa Rd. One of the stores by the Generali building (located on the right side on Jaffa when you're facing the building) stocks a wide variety of different beers and also has great prices, lower than that of other stores.\n\n## Sleep\nThe Old City has a diverse mix of small hotels, religious hospices and cheap hostels. The cheapest accommodation is found here.\nWest Jerusalem has a blend of B&Bs, guesthouses, small hotels and large hotels up to 5-star accommodation, including the famous King David Hotel, which is worth visiting for its architecture even if you don't stay there.\n\n## Connect\nWith the rise of cell phones, public telephones hardly exist but they take prepaid phone cards which can be purchased at post offices, shops and lottery kiosks. They are available in the following denominations: 20 units (₪13), 50 units (₪29), or 120 units (₪60). Calls made on Saturdays and Friday evenings are 25% cheaper than the standard rate.\nCoin-phones (usually ₪1) are also available. Those are private \"public phones\", owned and operated by shop owners.\nIsraeli Post offices are available for service from 08:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00 (Su-Th) though hours may vary per branch.\nThe central post office for West Jerusalem is located near the head of Jaffa Road, close to the municipality offices. Open until 19:00.\nIn the Old City, post offices can be found in the Armenian Quarter near the Jaffa Gate, diagonally opposite the Tower of David Museum, as well as the Jewish Quarter on Plugat Ha-Kotel near the Broad Wall.\nA post office is in a small shopping mall on King George Street, immediately south of Jaffa street.\nIsrael uses the red British \"pillar\" post boxes in some areas of Jerusalem, a reminder of the previous British Mandate.\nAlternatively, most inexpensive cell phone plans include a few GB per month of internet data.\n\n## Stay safe\nIn the case of injury or other emergency incidents, Police services can be reached by dialing 100, Ambulance services can be reached by dialing 101, and the Fire Department can be reached by dialing 102. All emergency services employ English-speaking operators.\nDespite alarming news headlines, Jerusalem is relatively safe for tourists. Nonetheless, Palestinians have attacked Israeli police officers and Jewish civilians, primarily with knives. Jews have committed similar attacks on Arabs, and in one case even on Gay Pride Parade participants — so check on current conditions before you go.\nNon-rigorous security checks can be frequent, especially when entering hotels, cinemas/theaters and shopping areas. It is wise to carry some identification.\nLike anywhere in Israel, you may notice large numbers of soldiers carrying weapons. These are generally off-duty soldiers going to and from their bases, so they have nothing to do with the security situation. However, in and around the Old City there will probably be many on-duty armed police. Also, educational tours for soldiers are often conducted in the Old City, and the IDF's \"swearing in ceremony\" is held near the Western Wall.\nTourists are not usually targeted in terror attacks, and most have occurred well away from tourist sites. Naturally it is important to remain vigilant and alert.\nThere are a few areas in the city where it is important to be mindful of one's dress, religion, and time period visiting. Here are some guidelines:\nDress. When visiting any holy site or religious neighborhood one should dress modestly. For men this means long pants, a closed shirt with sleeves, and a head covering. For women, it means a skirt that falls below the knee, a shirt with elbow-length sleeves and no exposed cleavage or stomach. This applies to churches, mosques, and synagogues, as well as the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) and Western Wall (the plaza by the Wall is essentially an open-air synagogue, and there are mosques on the Temple Mount), and Haredi neighborhoods such as Mea Shearim.\nReligion. It is not safe for noticeably Jewish people (e.g. wearing a kippah or speaking Hebrew) to enter Muslim neighborhoods. This includes the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, though the heavy police presence there makes it safer. It is also somewhat unsafe for Arabs to enter Haredi neighborhoods, or to enter the Jewish city center very late at night when Jewish youth have been drinking.\nTime. Non-Muslims are not allowed on the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) during times of Muslim prayer. During Shabbat and Jewish holidays, one should not publicly use electronic devices or smoke in any synagogue, at the Western Wall, or in any Haredi neighborhood. (Smoking is, otherwise, rather common in Israel, so nonsmokers should also be forewarned.) Driving in Haredi neighborhoods on Shabbat and Jewish holidays is not allowed, and roads may be closed off. During Ramadan, eating, drinking or smoking in the streets of Muslim areas is culturally insensitive, although tourists are rarely interfered with.\nDue to the mixture of religions, and the mixture of cultures within religions, tensions can sometimes be high. Avoid any confrontations between locals. Although extremely rare, some locals may carry xenophobic attitudes and ask foreigners to leave the area near their home. You have the right to see all of Jerusalem, but moving along to another area will resolve the situation.\nStreet crime is nearly nonexistent, although pickpockets may work in the Old City.\nOn the whole, theft is not a large-scale problem. To minimize risk, however, normal precautions apply. Do not leave valuable objects inside a car or in full view in your hotel room. There are many ATMs throughout the city and credit cards are widely accepted, so there is no need to carry large amounts of cash.\n\n## Consulates and embassies\nDue to the disputed status of Jerusalem, most countries maintaining embassies in Israel keep them in nearby Tel Aviv, with the notable exception of the United States. However, they often maintain a consulate in Jerusalem as well. The U.S. embassy moved here in 2018, and some US allies have announced an intention to either move an existing embassy to Jerusalem or open a new one here.\nGreece (Consulate), 31 Rachel Immenu, Kattamon, ☏ +972 2 561 9583, fax: +972 2 561 0325, grgencon.jer@mfa.gr.

          "title": "Hebron",
          "content": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Hebron appears to trace back to two northwest Semitic languages, which coalesce in the form ḥbr, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite, with a basic sense of 'unite' and connoting a range of meanings from 'colleague' to 'friend'. In the proper name Hebron, the original sense may have been 'alliance'.\nEarly Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra (حبرة) or Ḥabrūn (حبرون). al-Khalīl emerged as the Arabic name for the city in the 13th century, derived from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, Khalīl al-Raḥmān ('Friend of the Merciful [ie. God]'). Thus, the epithet is a calque the original Hebrew toponym Ḥeḇrōn, understood as ḥaḇēr ('friend').\n\nHistory\nBronze and Iron Age\nArchaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24–30 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age. This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city. Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, Abdi-Ḫeba, although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nAncient Israel\nThe Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a Kenite element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city, and Heber is the name for a Kenite clan. In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centers under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (benê/yelîdê hāʿănaq). or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian. This suggests that behind the Anakim legend lies some early Hurrian population. In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the Nephilim. The Book of Genesis mentions that it was formerly called Kiryath-arba, or \"city of four\", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters, four hills, or a confederated settlement of four families.\nThe story of Abraham's purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs from the Hittites constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land in that it signified the first \"real estate\" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua. In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first covenant, an alliance with two local Amorite clans who became his ba'alei brit or masters of the covenant.\nThe Hebron of the Israelites was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual center was located at Elonei Mamre. Hebrew Bible narrative also describes the city.\n\nIt is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either Joshua, who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, \"destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded\", or the Tribe of Judah as a whole, or specifically Caleb the Judahite. The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the Levites of the clan of Kohath, while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb (Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56), who expels the three giants, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has King David called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years (2 Samuel 2:1–3). It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him king of Israel. It was in Hebron again that Absalom has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David (2 Samuel 15:7–10). It became one of the principal centers of the Tribe of Judah and was classified as one of the six traditional Cities of Refuge.\nAs is shown by the discovery at Lachish, the second most important city in the Kingdom of Judah after Jerusalem, of seals with the inscription lmlk Hebron (to the king Hebron), Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic center, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the Dead Sea to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the Shepelah and the coastal plain to the west. Lying along trading routes, it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.\nAfter the destruction of the First Temple, most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view, some researchers found traces of Edomite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became Achaemenid province, and, in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquest, Hebron was throughout the Hellenistic period under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God Qōs. Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). During the Maccabean revolt, Hebron was burnt and plundered by Judah Maccabee who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE. The city appears to have long resisted Hasmonean dominance, however, and indeed as late as the First Jewish–Roman War was still considered Idumean.\n\nRoman rule\nThe present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times. Herod the Great, king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Hebron was captured and plundered by Simon Bar Giora, a leader of the Zealots, without bloodshed. The \"little town\" was later laid to waste by Vespasian's officer Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis. Josephus wrote that he \"slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town\". After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's Terebinth slave-market.\nThe city was part of the Byzantine Empire in Palaestina Prima province at the Diocese of the East. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the Sassanid general Shahrbaraz in 614 when Khosrau II's armies besieged and took Jerusalem. Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule. The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the Sassanid army.\n\nMuslim conquest and Islamic caliphate\nHebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. When the Rashidun Caliphate established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.\nCatholic bishop Arculf, who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad period, described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Baḥr Lūṭ). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass industry in the 9th century.\nHebron was almost absent from Muslim literature before the 10th century. In 985, al-Muqaddasi described Hebron (Habra) as the village of Abraham al-Khalil, with a strong fortress and a stone dome over Abraham's sepulchre. The mosque contained the tombs of Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. Surrounding the area were villages with vineyards producing exceptional grapes and apples. Hebron had a public guest house offering lentils and olive oil to both the poor and the rich. The guest house was established through the bequest of Prophet Muhammad's companions, including Tamim-al Dari, and received generous donations. It was highly regarded as an excellent house of hospitality and charity in the realm of al-Islam. The custom, known as the 'Table of Abraham' (simāt al-khalil), was similar to the one established by the Fatimids. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described Hebron in his Safarnama as having many villages providing revenues for pious purposes. He mentioned a spring flowing from under a stone, with water channeled to a covered tank outside the town. The Sanctuary stood on the town's southern border, enclosed by four walls. Barley was the primary crop, with abundant olives. Visitors were provided with bread, olives, lentils cooked in olive oil, and raisins. Hebron had numerous mills operated by oxen and mules, along with working girls baking bread. The hospitality extended to about three-pound loaves of bread and meals for every arriving person, including up to 500 pilgrims on certain days.\nThe tradition survives to this day in the form of the Takiat Ibrahim soup kitchen, which has been active in providing food for thousands over Ramadan, which coincided with food shortages during the 2024 Gaza war. Geniza documents from this period mention  \"the graves of the patriarchs\" and attest to the presence of an organized Jewish community in Hebron. The Jews maintained a synagogue near the tomb and earned their livelihood accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, known as the \"haver of the graves of the patriarchs.\"\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it \"Castellion Saint Abraham\". It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defense was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (October 17), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\nA royal domain, Hebron was handed over to Philip of Milly in 1161 and joined with the Seigneurie of Transjordan. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram. In 1167, the episcopal see of Hebron was created along with that of Kerak and Sebastia (the tomb of John the Baptist). In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited Hebron, referred to as in its Frankish name St. Abram de Bron. He mentioned the great church called St. Abram, which was once a Jewish place of worship during the time of Muslim rule. The Gentiles had erected six tombs there, claimed to be those of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah. The custodians collected money from pilgrims by presenting these tombs as the tombs of the Patriarchs. However, if a Jew offered a special reward, they would open an iron gate leading to a series of empty caves, until reaching the third cave where the actual sepulchers of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were said to be located.\nThe Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there. The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.\nIn 1244, the Khwarazmians destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1260, after Mamluk Sultan Baibars defeated the Mongol army, the minarets were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary, and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior Ayyubid rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns. The mill at Artas was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron. Between 1318 and 1320, the Na'ib of Gaza and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of Jawli Mosque to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.\n\nHebron was visited by important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them Nachmanides (1270) and Ishtori HaParchi (1322) who noted the old Jewish cemetery there. Sunni imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) was penalized by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognize Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. The Jewish-Italian traveler, Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found not more than twenty Jewish families living in Hebron. and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews. Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg's Journal (1449), by Felix Fabri (1483) and by Mejr ed-Din It was in this period, also, that the Mamluk Sultan Qa'it Bay revived the old custom of the Hebron \"table of Abraham\", and exported it as a model for his own madrasa in Medina. This became an immense charitable establishment near the Haram, distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travelers of all faiths. The Italian rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote around 1490:I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.\n\nEarly Ottoman period\nThe expansion of the Ottoman Empire along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I coincided with the establishment of Inquisition commissions by the Catholic Monarchs in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian convivencia (coexistence). The ensuing expulsions of the Jews drove many Sephardi Jews into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with  notable Sephardi kabbalists settling in Hebron. Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.\nThe Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century. In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardic Abraham Avinu Synagogue. In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the Hesed Le'Abraham yeshiva in Hebron, which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717 to 1729, and were \"almost crushed\" from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community after a false allegation that the son of a local sheikh was murdered  and thrown into a cesspit. Emissaries from the community were frequently sent overseas to solicit funds. During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated patriarchs' tombs were restored to a semblance of  dignity. Ali Bey, in Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access.  In 1807 he reported that the sepulchres were covered with carpets of green silk embroidered in gold and those of the wives were covered in red silk.The sultans of Constantinople furnished these carpets, which were renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, on the sepulchre of Abraham. Hebron also became known  for its glass production, based on Bedouin trade networks that brought up minerals from the Dead Sea. The industry is mentioned in travel literature in 19th century written by Western travelers to Palestine. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, based on 26 kilns. In 1833, a report on the town  in the weekly paper of the London-based Religious Tract Society wrote that Hebron had numerous well-provisioned shops and  produced glass lamps which were exported to Egypt. Early 19th-century travelers also noted Hebron's flourishing agriculture. It was a major exporter of dibse, grape sugar, from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.\n\nAn Arab peasants' revolt broke out in April 1834 when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population. Hebron, headed by its nazir Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and, when its defenses fell on August 4, it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army. An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.\nWhen the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem. In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (serasker), Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumored that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman, the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of Bayt Jibrin), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.\nAccording to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov wrote from Hebron that:\"the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a brit milah (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews'.\"\n\nLate Ottoman period\nBy 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardic families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazic community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian, the Lubavitch Hasidic movement having established a community in 1823. The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha led to a decline in the local glass industry. His plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, making firewood for the kilns  scarce. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass. The rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan reduced traffic to Hebron, and the Suez Canal (1869) precipitated a drop in caravan trade. The consequence was a steady deterioration of the local economy. At the time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), inhabited by Jews; the Mamluk-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west; and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah).In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha (\"governor\") of the sanjak (\"district\") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to put down a  rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, a scene witnessed by representatives of the English, French and other Western consulates. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, brother and rival of Abd al Rachman, as nazir of the Hebron region. Relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. In 1866, Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in Hebron. According to Nadav Shragai, Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. During a  severe drought in 1869–1871,  food in Hebron sold for ten times the normal amount. From 1874, the Hebron district  was administered directly from Istanbul as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem. By 1874, when C.R. Conder visited  Hebron under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Jewish community numbered  600 in an overall population of 17,000. The Jews lived in the Quarter of the Corner Gate. In the late 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glassware, although it continued to be popular among those who could not afford luxury goods  and was sold by Jewish merchants. Glass ornaments from Hebron were exhibited at the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna.\nA report from the consul of the French Consulate in Jerusalem in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly. While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, the economy of Hebron was more diverse, including agriculture and livestock herding, along with glassware manufacturing and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits. Even so, Hebron had an image of being  unproductive and  an \"asylum for the poor and the spiritual\". While the wealthy merchants of Nablus built fine mansions, housing in Hebron consisted of semi-peasant dwellings.\nHebron was described as 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic', and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook, with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews. It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, although  the Jewish and Christian communities seem to have been an integral part of  the local economy. As income from commerce declined and tax revenues diminished significantly, the Ottoman government left Hebron to manage its own affairs for the most part, making it \"one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.\" The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914. The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazi Jews. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry. The community was largely Orthodox and anti-Zionist.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nThe British occupied Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a mandate in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (waqfs), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf. During the 1920s, Abd al-Ḥayy al-Khaṭīb was appointed Mufti of Hebron. Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists. Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron. During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 percent of the political leadership. The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections. Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.\nAt this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbors, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.\n\nJordanian occupation\nAt the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed. By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armored car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.\nIn December 1948, the Jericho Conference, held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari, voted in favor of becoming part of Jordan and to recognize Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.\nAlthough a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period, Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town. During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.\n\nIsraeli period\nAfter the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace. On May 15, 2006, a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees urged the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement, and allow the return of eight families evacuated the previous January from homes they set up in emptied shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, established in 2007 under disputed circumstances, was under court orders permitting its forced evacuation. All the Jewish settlers were expelled on December 3, 2008.\n\nImmediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel. He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders. Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929. The purpose of settlement is to return to the 'land of our forefathers', and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus. Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behavior of Hebronite settlers.\n\nSheik Farid Khader heads the Ja'bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself. Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist. A violent episode occurred May 2, 1980, when an Al Fatah squad killed five yeshiva students and one other person on their way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground.\nIn the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Jewish Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behavior in other settlements. On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others. The 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to \"ensure the security of the Jewish settlers\" and that Israeli \"soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence\".\n\nOslo Accords\nHebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. IDF soldiers see their job as being to protect Israeli settlers from Palestinian residents, not to police the Israeli settlers. IDF soldiers are instructed to leave violent Israeli settlers for the police to deal with. Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites. Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 – which includes the Old City of Hebron – remained under the military control of Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. As of 2009, a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, although the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nOver the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada, and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighborhoods. On November 15, 2002, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush. Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from which the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem. In 2007, the Palestinian population in H2 declined due to Israeli security measures such as extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian businesses and settler harassment. Palestinians are barred from using Al-Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare that is locally nicknamed \"Apartheid Street\" as a result.\n\nIsraeli organization B'Tselem states that there have been \"grave violations\" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the \"presence of the settlers within the city\". The organization cites regular incidents of \"almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city\", curfews and restrictions of movement that are \"among the harshest in the Occupied Territories\", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: \"To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\" Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation. In 2017, Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of work in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incidents reported during this period, stated that Israel violated international law in Hebron and has breached the rights of residents as established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report claimed that Israel  violated Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. Israeli settlement in Hebron was also cited as a violation.\n\nGeography\nHebron is situated on the southern West Bank. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 meters (3,050 ft) above sea level. Hebron is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem, 60.1 kilometers (37.3 mi) east of Gaza, 43 kilometers (27 mi) northeast of Beersheba and 68.4 kilometers (42.5 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, both in Israel and 89.8 kilometers (55.8 mi) northeast of Amman, Jordan. The city is surrounded by Bani Na'im and Dura to the east, Halhul to the north, Taffuh to the west and Yatta to the south. The Israeli–controlled H2 region is located in the eastern region of the city.\nIt is one of the highest cities in the area and was, until the 19th century, considered the highest city in the Middle East. With the governorate and metropolitan area, it forms about 19% of the West Bank total area. The city is surrounded by several mountains and hills, including the Hebron Hills (Jabal al–Khalil) and Mount Nabi Yunis. The Mount Nabi Yunis, situated north of the city, is the highest point in Palestine, with an altitude of 1,030 meters (3,380 ft). While the Hebron Hills is southern part of the wider Judaean Mountains, which spreads throughout Israel and Palestine and have an altitude of 1,026 m (3,366 ft). The two larger settlements whose population exceeds 7000 sit on the hills overlooking the Hebron's eastern quarters – Kirayt Arba and Givat Harsina. Wadi al–Quff near Hebron is one of the largest natural reserves in Palestine. Located towards northeast of the city, it is surrounded by nearby towns and villages of Tarqumia, Halhoul, Beit Kahel and Beit Ola. The natural reserve covers up an area of 3.73 square kilometers (920 acres). Wadi al–Quff Natural reserve is home to some of the rare species of animals and plants.\nHebron is located on fertile mountainous area, making the city agriculturally rich, thus giving it a strategic importance. This is the reason for Hebron, today being a hub for cultivation of fruits and vineyards. The alternative sources of water network is cisterns. There are ten springs and three wells in the city. The water of springs and wells are not currently used. The Hebron River (Wadi al–Khalil), known as Nahal Hebron in Hebrew located along the region of Judea and Negev, is one of the water sources for the city. Currently the river is polluted, mainly due to the generation of waste, mostly by the industrial areas, situated on the city's east and south.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in Hebron is temperate and the mean year-round temperature ranges between 15 and 16° (an average of 7° in winter and 21° in summer). Annual precipitations average around 502 mm. Hebron has a Mediterranean, hot summer climate (Classification: Csa). The city's yearly temperature is 22.74 °C (72.93 °F) and it is 0.14% higher than Palestine's averages. It typically receives about 15.72 millimeters (0.62 inches) of precipitation and has 39.47 rainy days (10.81% of the time) annually, during January and February.\n\nUrban development\nHistorically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the suq and Harat al-Masharqa adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque, the Silk Merchant Quarter (Haret Kheitun) to the south and the Sheikh Quarter (Haret al-Sheikh) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.\nIn the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared. The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the Cave of Machpelah, the Haret Kheitun (the Jewish Quarter, Haret el-Yahud), the Haret el-Sheikh and the Druze Quarter. As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighborhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial center, Bab el-Zawiye, emerged. As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west. In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it. By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: el-Sheikh and Bab el-Zawiye to the west, el-Kazzazin, el-Akkabi and el-Haram in the center, el-Musharika to the south and el-Kheitun in the east. Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945. \n\nThe large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over 3 miles (5 km) at a depth of 600 ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5 km). In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded. In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site. The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin Quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site, which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.\nToday, the area along the north–south axis to the east comprises the modern city of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, Khalil Foq). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who moved there from the crowded old city, Balde al-Qadime (also called Lower Hebron, Khalil Takht). The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two luxury hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the krum, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period. The southern part is where the working-class neighborhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University. The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the center of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads that lead to the entrance of the old city. Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial center of the city, known as the vegetable market (hesbe), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of Bab el-Zawiye.\n\nDemographics\nHebron has, historically, been an Arab city but a small Jewish community has existed since the 16th century, encouraged to settle there by the Ottoman authorities following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000, including an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, and to 41 Jewish taxpayers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the Jews having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834. Its population stood at 16,577 in 1922 of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian.\nThe Jewish community was expelled from the city following the massacre of nearly 70 Jews in 1929. However, since Israel gained control of the West Bank in 1967, Hebron and eastern Jerusalem have been the only cities in the region to receive Jewish settlement.\nHebron had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017, and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City. Roughly 20% of the city, including 35,000 Palestinians, under Israeli military administration, lives in the region of H2 Hebron. The surrounding area forms the Hebron metropolitan area, with an estimated population of around 782,227 as of 2021. It is third largest metropolitan area in Palestine, after Gaza and Jerusalem.\nHebron is also home to several ethnic minority and foreign diaspora communities. Kurds have been living in the city since Saladin's conquest of Palestine. Along with Jerusalem and Gaza, the city is also home to Palestinians of Kurdish descent. Nearly a third of the population of Hebron, is considered to be of Kurdish background. The Kurdish Quarter, known as Harat al-Akrad, still exists today. Hebron is also home to a small Samaritan community, after Nablus.\n\nEconomy\nHebron is a leading commercial and industrial center in the Levantine region. The presence of minerals and resources in surroundings have increased the city's value. It emerged as in important trade hub in the West Bank. Hebron is most productive region in the country after Jerusalem–Bethlehem–Ramallah area. The H1 Area, which is under control of Palestinian Authority have been a large contributor to the city's economy. Despite having tense relations, Israelis and Palestinians have strong trade relations in Hebron. The city is popular for its ceramics and glass industry.\n\nIt is the source of 60% of stone and marble resources in the West Bank. 33% of the Palestine's GNP is from Hebron, including 60% of the jewelry industry and jewelry production, 28% of the output in the agricultural sector and 75% of the leather and shoe industry. Most agricultural products from Palestinian controlled Hebron are sent to Israel. Trade volume between Israel and the Palestine reaches $30 billion annually and the city trades with China as well. The minimum wage is 50 NIS per day versus an average of 30 NIS per day in other Palestinian areas. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the PLO made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.\n90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper, and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports. Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.\n\nThe most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Hebron is major source of import goods to Israel. Mattresses manufactured in Hebron are exported to Israeli markets in Tel Aviv, Beersheba and Haifa. Around 17,000 factories and workshops are located throughout the Area H1. Historically, the traditional glass industry is popular in Hebron. A new industrial city has been built in Tarqumiyah, which houses more than 140 factories. Royal Industrial Trading operates a pipe manufacturing plant in Hebron, which is spread across an area of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) and employs over 650 people. In 2021, an electronic recycling factory was opened in Idhna and operates to this day. The European Union and the World Bank proposed to construct a regional water treatment plant, which will treat existing sewage stream coming from 80% of the city. The city is a hub for the jewelry industry and houses approximately 70 jewelry factories employing over 1500 workers.\nSuper Nimer company manufactures sanitary ware products and water network from its factory, whose area ranges from 30,000 square meters (7.4 acres) to 45,000 square meters (11 acres). Opened in 2004, Super Tiger operates a factory spread across an area of 7 acres (28,000 m2). During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Palestine, Hebron rapidly transformed into a medical supplies manufacturing hub, with numerous factories installing and commissioning new production lines for the product and was approved by the Ministry of National Economy.\n\nPolitical status\nUnder the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition. The aftermath of the 1948 war saw the city occupied and later unilaterally annexed by the kingdom of Jordan in a move supported by local Hebron officials. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 percent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.\nAn international unarmed observer force—the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.\nThe post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the Mercaz HaRav Kook, which consider the Land of Israel and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to Abraham, King David, and the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Settling in Hebron is seen as a right and duty, a favor to the world, and an example of being \"a light unto the nations\" (Or la-Goyim).  This viewpoint has resulted in numerous violent clashes with Palestinians, which some settlers see as contributing to the messianic process.\n\nOccupation and settlements\nIn 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of Israelis, disguised as tourists, rented the main hotel in Hebron and refused to leave. The government initially wanted to evacuate the settlers but eventually allowed them to relocate to a nearby military base, which became the settlement of Kiryat Arba. After lobbying efforts, the settlement gained support from some Israeli leaders. Over time, the settlement expanded with the outpost Givat Ha'avot. The operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel. In 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron before 1948 and are not entitled to compensation for their losses. Originally named Hesed l'Avraham, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Baghdadi Jewish families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America, which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all. In 1979, a group of 15 settler mothers and their 35 children squatted in the Dabouia building in Hebron, exploiting the government's indecision during negotiations with Egypt. Led by Miriam Levinger, they established a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement and created conflict with Arab shopkeepers. A retaliatory attack by a Palestinian group resulted in the death of six yeshiva students. Despite appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the settlers remained. The following year, the government legitimized residency in Hebron and expelled the elected mayor. This pattern of settlement followed by hostilities with Palestinians was repeated in Tel Rumeida.\nThe Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the center of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed. The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighboring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return. Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students. In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir. In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.\nIn 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation. The IDF, in accordance with settler demands, requested the removal of a Palestinian flag on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice. According to Palestinians, the IDF negotiated the removal of the flag in exchange for the release of a resident of Hebron from legal custody. In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of Plugat Hamitkanim in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s. In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighborhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.\n\nCulture\nTourism\nHebron is home to numerous mosques, synagogues, churches, parks, palaces, castles and forts. The Old City of Hebron was a declared a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO on July 7, 2017. The move caused controversies and faced opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it being called as Palestinian site, instead of Israeli. It is one of the best preserved sites of the Mamluk era.\n\nThe most famous site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The site is known for the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah respectively. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue.\nThe tombs of other biblical figures – Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse are also located in the city. It is reverred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. These sites are located in the H2 region, which is controlled by the Israeli authorities.\nThe early Ottoman-era Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city's historic Jewish Quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.\nMosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque.\nHebron is also home to several sites for Christian worship, with numerous churches located around the city. The Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925. Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas.\nOther sites:\n\nSituated on the northeast of the city, Wadi al–Quff Natural Reserve is visited by 2,000 people, mostly on weekends. It is currently under the management of the Palestinian government.\nAristobolia (Khirbet Istanbul), in south of Hebron, near Zif village, is home to Byzantine-era basilica, built during the beginning of Islamic era.\nKhirbet al–Karmil is home to Crusader pool, ruined Byzantine church and Crusader fortress.\nAs-Samu is an ancient biblical village, currently a modern town. It is home to 4th century synagogue, numerous Ottoman-era structure and an Islamic building, probably built during the time of Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.\n\nReligious traditions\nSome Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron. A tradition arose in medieval Jewish texts that the Cave of the Patriarchs itself was the very entrance to the Garden of Eden. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune. Others report that the soil was harvested for export as a precious medicinal spice in Egypt, Arabia, Ethiopia and India and that the earth refilled after every digging. Legend also tells that Noah planted his vineyard on Mount Hebron. In medieval Christian tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where Elizabeth was said to live, the legend implying that it might have been the birthplace of John the Baptist.\nOne Islamic tradition has it that Muhammad alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes. Another tradition states that Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari's domain; this was implemented during Umar's reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the waqf of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them. The simat al-Khalil or \"Table of Abraham\" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveler Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman imarets — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.\nAccording to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the diasporic thrust of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.\n\nGallery\nTwin towns / sister cities\nHebron is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nShabab Al-Khalil SC, the town's football team\nPalestinian Child Arts Center\nList of burial places of biblical figures\nList of people from Hebron\nOak of Mamre, Christian holy site, historically near Hebron but now inside the city, distinct from the Terebinth of Mamre\nAbraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, Russian Orthodox monastery at the \"Oak of Mamre\"\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nwww.hebron-city.ps\nPhotographs of Hebron\nenglish Hebron.com – English\nCollection of Palestinian articles on Hebron published by \"This Week in Palestine\"\nSephardic Studies 1839 Sephardic census of Ottoman-controlled Hebron.\nArchNet.org. \"Hebron\".

          "summary": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.",

          "content": "الخَلِيل مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة الخليل إداريًا، تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الجنوب من القدس بحوالي 35 كم. أسسها الكَنعَانِيون في العصر البرونزي المبكر، وتُعد اليوم أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية من حيث عدد السكان والمساحة، حيث بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2016 بقرابة 215 ألف نسمة، وتبلغ مساحتها 42 كم2. تمتاز المدينة بأهمية اقتصادية، حيث تُعد من أكبر المراكز الاقتصادية في الضفة الغربية. وللخليل أهمية دينية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث، حيث يتوسط المدينة المسجد الإبراهيمي الذي يحوي مقامات للأنبياء إبراهيم، وإسحق، ويعقوب، وزوجاتهم.\nتُقسم مدينة الخليل حاليّاً إلى البلدة القديمة والحديثة، وتديرها بلدية الخليل التي أُسِّسَت عام 1927، كما أنها مركز محافظة الخليل التي يضم التقسيم الإداري الحالي لها العشرات من القرى والبلدات، ويُقدر عدد سكان المحافظة بأكثر من 684 ألف نسمة (2014). تقع البلدة القديمة بمحاذاة المسجد الإبراهيمي. وهي عبارة عن أزقّة وبيوت ودكاكين قديمة، وتضم العديد من الأسواق. تقوم إسرائيل بإغلاق أجزاء كبيرة منها وتنشر قوات من الجيش الإسرائيلي فيها لوجود تجمّع حديث لليهود الأرثوذكس يسعى للسيطرة على العقارات في تلك المنطقة. تسيطر إسرائيل على حوالي 20% من مساحة المدينة بحسب إتفاق إعادة الإنتشار في الخليل في عام 1997، ولكن تتحمل السلطة الفلسطينية إدارة الشؤون المدنية للفلسطينيين فيها. يحيط بالمدينة أيضًا الكثير من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، أكبرها مستوطنة كريات أربع، والمستوطنات والتجمعات اليهودية تحتكم لجسم بلدي منفصل. وتعد المدينة من المدن المقدسة الأربع في الديانة اليهودية.\nفي السابع من تموز 2017، أدرجت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة «اليونسكو» البلدة القديمة في مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على قائمة التراث العالمي المُهدد بالخطر بوصفها منطقة تُعرف بقيمتها العالمية، وقد حصلت مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على أغلبية أصوات الدول المشاركة في التصويت الذي جرى في مدينة كراكوف البولندية.\n\nالتسمية\nسُميَّت مدينة الخليل بهذا الاسم نسبةً إلى نبي الله إبرَاهِيم الخليل، حيث يُعتقد انه سكنها في منطقة الحرم الإبراهيمي بعد هجرته من مدينة أور السومرية. كانت تسمى بقرية أربع نسبة إلى ملك كنعاني اسمه أربع، وسميت بعدها حبرون لأحد سببين، إما نسبة للملك عفرون الحثي الكنعاني الذي باع المغارة لـ إبراهيم، حسب الرواية التوراتية، بأربعمائة شواقل وكان الشاقل العملة الكنعانية، وإما لكونها كلمة مشتقة من كلمة «حافير» العبرية أو الخليل بالعربية. سمّيت فيما بعد بالخليل ويبلغ عدد سكانها 320,000 نسمة.\n\nالتاريخ\nتُعتبر مدينة الخليل من المدن العربية القليلة التي حافظت على استمرارية الاستقرار البشري. والخليل هي مدينة مقدسة لليهود والمسلمين والمسيحيين. كما أنها معروفة باعتبارها مدينة الآباء. يعتقد بعض الناس أن إبراهيم، أب الأديان الإبراهيمية، قد عاش في الخليل عام 1800 قبل الميلاد أو نحو ذلك. يعتقدون أيضا أنه قد اشترى المغارة التي بني عليها المسجد الإبراهيمي/ مغارة مكفيلا، حيث يعتقدون أن إبراهيم قد دفن هناك وزوجته سارة، وابنهما إسحاق وحفيدهما يعقوب. على مر التاريخ، كانت هنالك فترات لأغلبية مسلمة، من الذين عاشوا في مدينة الخليل إلى جانب أقليات من اليهود.\n\nوُجدت في الخليل آثار تشير إلى وجود مدني في العصر البرونزي المبكر (في حدود النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد) وكانت المدينة في الأصل مدينة كنعانية جليلة مترفة، وسيطرت عليها - كما في بقية فلسطين- العديد من القوى، من الأشوريين عام 732 ق.م والبابليين عام 586 ق.م والفرس عام 539 ق.م والإغريق عام 322 ق.م، وإنتزعها منهم الرومان عام 63 ق.م. ثم انتقلت لقبضة البيزنطيين عام 593 م إلاّ أنّ الفرس احتلوها منهم لبضع سنوات، ثمّ عاد الروم البيزنطيون فاستعادوها مرة أخرى، وأخرجوا الفرس منها، وانتقلت لسيطرة العرب المسلمين في القرن السابع الميلادي. ضمّها الصليبيون لممالكهم عام 1167م حتى هزيمتهم بعد معركة حطين سنة 1187م أمام جيش صلاح الدين الأيوبي ونقل إليها منبر عسقلان العاجي. لاحقا تطورت المدينة في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني، واشتهرت في عصر العثمانيين بصناعة القناديل والزجاج الملوّن، وبلغ من تقدمها آنذاك أن شاركت في المعرض العالمي الذي أقيم في فينا عام 1873م، حيث عرضت صناعات الخليل من أدوات الزينة المصنوعة من الزجاج الملوّن، كما ازدهرت في فترة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين، حيث أسست بلدية الخليل عام 1927م. وخلال حرب 1948، وقع نصف قضاء الخليل ضمن حدود إسرائيل دون المدينة، حيث فقد القضاء معظم قراه وبلداته وأخصب أراضيه الواقعة غربًا، وأخضعت المدينة للإدارة الأردنية عام 1950م. وفي حرب 1967 استكملت إسرائيل احتلال المحافظة بما فيها المدينة، وقامت بمصادرة جزء كبير من المدينة لإسكان المستوطنين اليهود فيها، وخاصة في البلدة القديمة.].\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nتُعد الخليل من أقدم مدن العالم، وتاريخها يعود إلى 5500 عام. بناها الكنعانيون وأطلقوا عليها اسم (قرية أربع) نسبة إلى بانيها (أربع) وهو أبو عَناق أعظم العناقيين، وكانوا يوصفون بالجبابرة، ولما جاء يوشع بن نون غير اسم قرية أربع إلى حيرون نسبة إلى أحد أولاد كالب بن يفنة، ثم سميت الخليل نسبة إلى (خليل الرحمن) إبراهيم، ففي أوائل القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد سكن إبراهيم بعض السنين تحت بلوطات «ممرًا» الواقعة شمال الخليل، وتضم الخليل رفاته ورفاة زوجته سارة، وعائلته من بعده إسحق ويعقوب ويوسف لوط ويونس، ثم صارت الخليل قاعدة لدواوود بن سليمان سبع سنين ونصفا فقط، وكذلك تضم الكثير من رفات الصحابة وفي مقدمتهم شهداء معركة أجنادين. يواصل اليهود إدعائهم فهم يدَعُون أن موسى استخرج تابوته من أعماق النيل وحمله معه وأن «يوشع بن نون» دفنه في مغارة في حبرى (الخليل) وهم بهذا الإدعاء وغيره يريدون عبر الصهيونية إلى استدرار عاطفة الناس دينيًا وخلق تاريخ وهمي من العدم.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي أيام الرومان، أقيمت كنيسة على مقبرة إبراهيم وعائلته، ولما دخل الفرس سنة 614 م هدموها، تُعد الخليل واحدة من آخر المدن في فلسطين التي دخلها الفتح الإسلامي في القرن السابع الميلادي. وقد كانت تُسمى على أيام النبي محمد بـ«حبرا». وقد شاد الأمويون سقف الحرم الحالي والقباب التي فوق مراقد إبراهيم ويعقوب وزوجتيهما. وفي العصر العباسي فتح الخليفة المهدي باب السور الحالي من جهة الشرق وبنوا له المراقي الجميلة من ناحيتي الشمال والجنوب وأمر المقتدر بالله ببناء القبة التي على ضريح يوسف.\n\nوفي العصر الفاطمي لم يكن لمشهد الخليل باب، وكان دخوله مستحيلاً، بل كان الناس يزورونه من الإيوان في الخارج. فلما جلس المهدي على عرش مصر أمر بفتح باب فيه، وزيّنه وفرشه بالسجاجيد، وأدخل على عمارته إصلاحاً كثيراً. وباب المشهد وسط الحائط الشمالي على ارتفاع أربع أذرع فوق الأرض، وعلى جانبه درجات من الحجر، فيصعد إليه من جانب ويكون النزول من الجانب الثاني. ووضع هناك باب صغير من الحديد.\nلقد وصف الاصطخري المدينة بقوله: ««ومن بيت لحم على سمته في الجنوب مدينة صغيرة، شبيهة في القدر بقرية ـ تعرف بمسجد إبراهيم، وفي المسجد الذي يجمّع فيه الجمعة قبر إبراهيم واسحق ويعقوب صفاً، وقبور نسائهم صفاً بحذاء كل قبر من قبورهم قبر امرأة صاحبه، والمدينة في وهدة بين الجبال كثيرة كثيفة الأشجار، وأشجار هذه الجبال وسائر جبال فلسطين وسهلها زيتون وتين وجميز وعنب وسائر الفواكه أقل من ذلك»».\nكما وصفها المقدسي: ««حبرى هي قرية إبراهيم الخليل، فيها حصن منيع، يزعمون أنه من بناء الجن من حجارة عظيمة منقوشة، وسطه قبّة من الحجارة إسلامية، على قبر إبراهيم وقبر اسحق، قُدَّام في المغطى، وقبر يعقوب في المؤخر. حذاء كل نبي امرأته. وقد جُعل الحبر مسجداً وبني حوله دور للزّوار. واختلطت فيه العمارة ولهم قناة ضعيفة. وهذه القرية إلى نحو نصف مرحلة من كل جانب قرى وكروم وأعناب وتفاح، تسمى جبل نصرة لا يُرى مثله، ولا أحسن من فواكهه، عامتها تحمل إلى مصر وتنشر. وفي هذه القرية ضيافة دائمة وطبّأخ وخباز وخدام، مرتبون يقدمون العدس بالزيت لكل من حضر من الفقراء. ويدفع إلى الأغنياء إذا أخذوا. ويظن أكثر الناس أنه من قرى إبراهيم وإنما هو من وقف تميم الداري وغيره. والأفضل عندي التورُّع عنه»».\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nوقد سقطت مدينة «الخليل» في أيدى الفرنجة عام 1099 م إبَّان الحروب الصليبية. وقام الأمير جودفري البويوني ببناء قلعة حصينة لحمايتها والتي سمّاها \"Castellion Saint Abraham\" - أي: «قلعة القديس أبراهام»، ثم منحها وقلعتها إلى جيرارد افسنس \"Gerard of Avesenes\" طبقا للعرف الإقطاعي، الذي صار عليه الفرنجة في توزيع معظم البلاد والأراضي التي تم الاستيلاء عليها لكبار الأمراء والقادة العسكريين. وهكذا تحولت مدينة الخليل وجزء من الزمام الزراعي المحيط بها إلى إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، يسيطر عليها أحد الأمراء بفضل جهود الأمير جودفري، الذي يرجع إليه الفضل بوضع أساس النظام الإقطاعي الفرنجي الصليبي في فلسطين، غير أن السمات البارزة لهذا النظام لم تظهر في عهده؛ بسبب قصر المدة التي حكمها.\nأصبحت الخليل إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، لكن الملك الفرنجي في بيت المقدس لم يقم بمنح جميع أراضي الخليل للسيد الإقطاعي وإنما احتفظ بجزء منها، مما يشير إلى أن المملكة الفرنجية اتبعت نهجا واضحا في سياستها العامة والمتعلقة بمنح الإقطاعات والأملاك المحددة دون اللجوء إلى منح المدن المناطق الريفية المحيطة بها للسادة الإقطاعيين. وربما كان ملوك بيت المقدس يهدفون من وراء هذه السياسة تحقيق عدة أمور منها: الاحتفاظ بمساحات شاسعة من أراضي الخليل من أجل منح جزء منها للكنائس والأديرة وصغار النبلاء والفرسان، أو ربما للحد من سلطة السيد الإقطاعي، أو ربما من أجل الإسهام في تغطية نفقات التاج من عائدات هذه الأراضي.\nلقد استطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد المدينة من أيدى الصليبيين إثر موقعة حطين عام 1187 م. وفي عام (656 هـ - 1258 م) أغار المغول على مدينة الخليل بعدما دمّروا بغداد، غير أن انتصارات «قطز» في عين جالوت عام (658 هـ - 1260 م) وضعت حدًا نهائيً لتلك الغارات.\n\nالعهد المملوكي\nاستعاد القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي مدينة الخليل في 1187. تم ذلك بمساعدة يهودية وفقا لتقليد واحد في وقت متأخر، في مقابل خطاب من الأمن السماح لهم بالعودة إلى المدينة، وبناء كنيس هناك. تم تغيير اسم المدينة مرة أخرى إلى مدينة الخليل. وقد بقي ربع الكردية موجود في البلدة خلال الفترة الأولى من الحكم العثماني. استعاد ريتشارد قلب الأسد المدينة بعد فترة وجيزة. تمكن ريتشارد من كورنوال، وجلبه من إنجلترا لتسوية العداوات الخطيرة بين فرسان المعبد والإسبتارية، التي تنافس للخطر معاهدة ضمان الاستقرار الإقليمي المنصوص عليها مع السلطان المصري والصالح أيوب، لفرض السلام في المنطقة. لكن بعد وقت قصير من مغادرته، ونتيجة للحروب المتناحرة من عام 1241، وفرسان المعبد الذين شنوا غارة مدمرة، في انتهاك للاتفاقيات.\nفي 1260، بعد غارات المغول على فلسطين، لامست واحدة منها الخليل. وقد تم بناء مآذن على هيكل مغارة المكفيلة/المسجد الإبراهيمي في ذلك الوقت. بعد ست سنوات، خلال الحج إلى مدينة الخليل، أصدر بيبرس مرسوما يمنع المسيحيين ويهود\nمن دخول الحرم، وأصبح المناخ أقل تسامحا مع اليهود والمسيحيين مما كانت عليه تحت حكم الدولة الأيوبية قبل. لم يكن مرسوم لإستبعاد المسيحيين واليهود بصرامة حتى منتصف القرن الرابع عشر وبحلول 1490 سمح لمن هم ليسو بمسلمين بالدخول في كهوف تحت الأرض. تم بناء مصنع في أرطاس عام 1307 حيث تم تخصيص الأرباح من دخلها إلى مستشفى في الخليل. ولقد كتب العديد من الزوار حول الخليل على مدى القرنين التاليين (من بينها \"Ishtori HaParchi\" عام 1322 و \"Nachmanides\" عام 1270 والحاخام ميشولام من فولتيرا عام 1481 و \"HaParchi\" عام 1322. ولم يُسجل أي ذكر لليهود في مدينة الخليل في هذه الفترة.\nلقد استمرت الهجرة إلى المدينة من قبل المجموعات العرقية والدينية المختلفة، ومن ضمنها مجموعات يهودية صغيرة وفقيرة اعتاشت على صدقات المحسنين اليهود الذين كانوا يزورون المدينة (خلال الفترة المملوكية)، وسكنت في قلب المدينة في حارة الدارية. هذا بالإضافة إلى نشوء حارة صغيرة للنصارى (استمرت بالوجود حتى مطلع الفترة العثمانية)، لتختفي بعدها. ولكن تعود كل الحارات القديمة، والتي ما زالت قائمة، في شكلها النهائي إلى الفترة المملوكية. وبالتالي من الممكن الاعتقاد بأن شكل الخليل القديمة، كما هي عليه الآن، قد تشكل في هذه الفترة، في حين كان نصيب الفترة العثمانية، مجرد تعبئة الفراغات التي تركتها الفترة المملوكية وتكثيف استعمال المساحات وزيادة طوابق المباني القديمة وتوسع ضئيل في مساحة الحارات.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nفتح العثمانيون الشام ومدينة الخليل بعد معركة مرج دابق عام 1517 م، واستمر حكمهم 4 قرون، حتى جاء الاحتلال البريطانى لفلسطين عام 1917م إلى عام 1948 م.\nلقد كانت الخليل مشهورة بعمل الزجاج. وكانت أبنيتها في هذه الفترة من الحجر الكلسي الذي يستخرج من الجبال المحيطة بها. ولهذه المدينة عدة أبواب تغلق ليلاً منعاً للمواصلة مع بقية المقاطعات ومحافظة على الأمن والسكينة. والمدينة الحاضرة مبنية على منحدرات الهضاب وفي السهل. وموقع الحرم أو الجامع يقع عند نهاية المنحدر البعيد عنها قليلاً. وضمت الخليل 22 ألف نسمة في نهاية الفترة العثمانية. بينهم 2000 يهودي لهم ثلاثة معابد. تقوم على مساحة ضيقة من واد ينحدر من الشمال الغربي. ضواحي البلدة خصبة، تكثر فيها عيون الماء. يصنع اليهود الخمر الجيد من العنب الذي يكثر في الجوار. وفضلاً عن الكرمة فان أشجار اللوز والمشمش في نمو وازدهار. والخليل أيضاً سوق تجاري.\n\nبالنسبة لأحياء المدينة في هذه الفترة، فضلاً عن الأحياء اليهودية الواقعة في شمالها الغربي وجنوبها الغربي كانت تضم سبعة أحياء:\n\nحي الشيخ علي البكا ويعلو هذا الحي على مجرى مياه «عين قشقلة» وترى بقربها مغائر وقبور صخرية. ومن هذه العين ممر يؤدي إلى رأس تلة (حبال الرياح).\nحارة باب الزاوية.\nحارة القزازين ـ نسبة إلى عمّال الزجاج.\nحارة العقّابة حيث يقيم عمّال المعاطف الشتوية المصنوعة من الجلد\nحارة الحرم\nحارة المشارقة\nحارة قيطون ـ حيث كان يقيم عمال القطن\nكانت البلدة القديمة تقوم في القرب من المدينة الحالية، على «تلة الرميدة» المغطاة بأشجار الزيتون وترى على هذه التلة بقايا جدران ضخمة وبناية حديثة تحمل اسم دير الأربعين. وفي الجنوب الغربي من حارة الحرم انشئت بركتان كبيرتان: الأولى تحمل اسم «بركة القزازين» طولها 28 ياردة وعرضها 18 ياردة وعمقها 27 قدماً ونصف القدم. والثانية وتقع في أسفل الوادي وتعرف باسم «بركة السلطان» بنيت بأحجار مصقولة، مربعة الشكل طول كل ضلع من أضلاعها نحو 44 ياردة. وبقربها تقوم «السراي» الجديدة. وكان لا يسمح لغير المسلمين دخول الحرم الشريف. ولم يدخله من غير المسلمين إلاّ أقلية ممتازة من الأوروبيين انما كان يسمح لليهود وغيرهم الصعود إلى الدرجة السابعة فقط من سلّم الحرم. وعند الدرجة الخامسة يوجد ثقب يعتقد اليهود انه يمتد إلى داخل الحرم إلى أن تصل بالقبور. وفي كل جمعة يأتون إلى الدرجة المذكورة يبكون وينوحون شأنهم في شأن نحيبهم عند حائط البراق (المبكى) في بيت المقدس. وفي الجنوب من تلة «قب الجانب» تقع محطة الكرنتينا. وتلاصق الحرم من الجنوب «القلعة» وهي نصف خربة تستعمل ثكنة للجنود.وفي الخليل أيضاً إدارة للبريد والبرق وفرع لبنك انجلو فلسطين ومستشفى للارسالية الاسكوتلندية.\n\nعهد الانتداب البريطاني\nبعد الحرب العالمية الأولى، انتقلت مدينة الخليل لتكون تحت الانتداب البريطاني. خلال سنوات العشرينات، نتيجة لازدياد الصهيونية من جهة، وتنمية الوعي القومي العربي من جهة أخرى، زادت حدة التوتر بين العرب واليهود الذين عاشوا تحت الانتداب. وقد ادعت كلتا الأيديولوجيتين ادعاءات سياسية وإقليمية متضاربة حول نفس المنطقة، مما أسفر عن انفجار في الخليل، في مذبحة عام 1929.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة \"UNSCOP\" المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة \"UNSCOP\" تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصادي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة \"UNSCOP\" الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية وواليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nلقد أفضت أحداث حرب 1948 إلى إعلان الإدارة الأردنية للضفة الغربية، حيث ضم الأردن الضفة الغربية، بما فيها مدينة الخليل، بصفة رسمية يوم 24 نيسان/ أبريل 1950، لكن الجامعة العربية وآخرون أعلنوا بطلان وعدم قانونية الضم ولم يعترف به سوى ثلاث دول هي العراق وباكستان وبريطانيا.\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى حرب 1967، بعد سقوط الضفة الغربية بيد إسرائيل. إلا أن الوضع القانوني للمدينة ومعها الضفة الغربية بأكملها قد ظل بكونها جزءًا من حدود المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى قرار فك الارتباط عام 1988، حيث تم إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطيني. وقد تخلى الأردن بموجبه عن المطالبة بالضفة الغربية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، التي كانت قد عُينت سابقًا من قبل الجامعة العربية ك«ممثل شرعي وحيد للشعب الفلسطيني».\n\nالنكسة\nرزحت الخليل تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة الخليل التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة، حيث احتلت إسرائيل مدينة الخليل في 5 يونيو 1967، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها، ويوجد داخل المدينة حاليا خمسة مواقع استيطانية يهودية وهي مستوطنة تل الرميده، والدبويا، ومدرسة أسامة بن المنقذ وسوق الخضار والاستراحة السياحية قرب المسجد الإبراهيمي الشريف، بالإضافة إلى التجمع الاستيطاني اليهودي على حدود المدينة الشرقية (كريات أربع وخارسينا).\nالخليل هي المدينة الفلسطينية الوحيدة التي اقيمت في قلبها مستوطنة. لأجل حرية حركة للمئات القلائل من المستوطنين اختارت إسرائيل سياسة رسمية مميزة ضد السكان الفلسطينيين في المدينة. مع مرور السنين أصبح مركز المدينة كمدينة اشباح.\n\nعلى مدار سنوات، تم إقامة عدد من نقاط الاستيطان الإسرائيلية في مدينة الخليل القديمة وضواحيها، وهي منطقة كانت بمثابة مركز تجاري لجنوب الضفة الغربية. وتقوم الجهات المسئولة عن القانون في إسرائيل وقوات الأمن الإسرائيلية بتكبيد ثمن حماية هذه النقاط الاستيطانية من جميع السكان الفلسطينيين. ولهذا الغرض، تنتهج إسرائيل نظامًا يستند بصورة صريحة ومكشوفة إلى «مبدأ الفصل»، الذي على ضوئه أوجدت إسرائيل عزلا (SEGREGATION) على الأرض وعزلاً قانونيًا ما بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية.\nوقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى انهيار الاقتصاد وسط مدينة الخليل ونزوح واسع للسكان الفلسطينيين. وتُظهر نتائج المسح الذي أُجري من أجل إعداد هذا التقرير، أن الفلسطينيين نزحوا عن ما لا يقل عن 1014 شقة سكنية في وسط مدينة الخليل، علمًا أن هذه الشقق تُشكل 41.9% من مجموع الشقق السكنية في هذه المنطقة. كما أن 65% من الشقق التي تم إخلاؤها، وعددها 659، نزح عنها سكانها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية. كما يتضح من نتائج المسح أن 1829 محلاً تجاريًا فلسطينيًا في المنطقة التي جرى مسحها أصبحت مهجورة اليوم، علما أن هذه المحلات التجارية المغلقة تشكل 76.6% من مجموع المحال التجارية في هذه المنطقة. 62.4% من المحال التجارية المغلقة، وعددها 1141 محلا، تم إغلاقها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية، وأن 440 محلًا منها جرى إغلاقها بأوامر عسكرية.\nإن المكونات الأساسية لـ«سياسة الفصل» الإسرائيلية تقوم على الحظر الشديد والواسع لحركة الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن فرض القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. كل هذا إلى جانب ما يلحق سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين من أذى مباشر من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة الخليل، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو. في عام 1994، عندما كان سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو في أوجه، قام المستوطن اليهودي باروخ غولدشتاين بإطلاق النار على المسلمين الذين كانوا يصلون في الحرم الإبراهيمي وقتل 29 منهم وأصاب عددًا أكبر بكثير.\nاستمر سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو وفي شباط/فبراير 1997، تم توقيع اتفاق حول الانتشار الجزئي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الخليل، وتم تقسيم المدينة إلى قسمين: منطقة H1، والتي تم تسليم السيطرة عليها للسلطة الفلسطينية، ومنطقة H2 - التي بقيت تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. وفي أبريل/ نيسان 2002، سيطر جيش الإحتلال الإسرائيلي على المدينة بأكملها، ووضعت أبراج مراقبة ثابتة في منطقة H1 في المدينة في عام 2003.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع المدينة على هضبة ترتفع 940 م عن سطح البحر. يربطها طريق رئيسي بمدينتي بيت لحم والقدس، وتقع على الطريق الذي يمر بأواسط فلسطين رابطة الشام بمصر مروراً بسيناء.\nوقد بنيت الخليل على سفحي جبلي جبل الرميدة وجبل الرأس على ارتفاع 927 م، وفي الوادي بين الجبلين الذي يختلف اسمه على طول مجراه، حيث يعرف بوادي التفاح، وهو يخترق وسط الخليل.\nوتقع الخليل على بُعد 35 كم للجنوب من مدينة القدس، و46 كم غرب نهر الأردن، و152 كم جنوب مدينة جنين، و229 كم غرب مدينة الكرك الأردنية.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى البلدة القديمة والجديدة، من أهم الأحياء الجديدة في المدينة:\n\nأما البلدة القديمة فتتميز بعراقتها وأصالتها، ويعود تاريخ مبانيها إلى العهد الأيوبي والمملوكي والعثماني، وتمتاز البلدة القديمة بنظامها المعماري الرائع وفيها العديد من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية والقناطر والأزقة والأسواق القديمة. ومن أهم الأحياء القديمة في المدينة: حي الشيخ علي البكاء، حي القزازين، حي السواكنة، حي القلعة، حي بني دار، حارة العقابة، حي المحتسبيين، حي المدرسة، حي قيطون، حي المشارقة حي الأكراد، حي المشارقة الفوقا، وحي الحوشية.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في الخليل مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتراً.\n\nالسكان\nالخليل أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية، حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها اليوم 200,000 نسمة (بحسب بلدية الخليل). ويذكر بأن عدد سكان الخليل مع مطلع القرن العشرين كان قد قدر بحوالي 8000 – 10000 نسمة فقط.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكانها عام 1922 م حوالي 16,577 نسمة منهم 430 يهودياً وعام 1945 م حوالي 24,560 نسمة وبلغ عدد سكانها عام 1967 م بعد الاحتلال حوالي 38,300 نسمة ارتفع إلى 79,100 نسمة عام 1987 م.\nأقامت سلطات الاحتلال أحزمة استيطانية حول المدينة وأنشأت أول مستوطنة هي (كريات أربع) تمهيداً لتطويق المدينة ومحاصرتها جغرافياً وسكانياً ومن أجل هذا الهدف صادرت مساحات واسعة من أراضيها وأقامت مستوطنتين عام 1981م هما مستوطنة (كرمل) وهي من نوع موشاف مساحتها 4 آلاف دونم ومستوطنة (ماعون) وأقامت سلطات الاحتلال حيا يهوديا في قلب المدينة، وبلغت مساحة الأراضي المصادرة من المدينة وما حولها حوالي 72700 دونم حتى عام 1981م وتبلغ عدد المستوطنات المقامة في المحافظة 34 مستوطنة حتى نهاية 1987م ومنها 26 مستوطنة تزيد مساحة الواحدة منها عن 25 دونم.\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان منطقة الخليل في فترات مختلفة:\n\nوأما الأصول العرقية لسكان المدينة، فبالرغم من وقوع الكثير من القصص العائلية تحت الأساطير التاريخية، إلا أن هناك جزء ليس بقليل من السكان، الذين نعرف أصولهم على وجه اليقين، منها الأصول العربية قبل الإسلامية (قبيلة لخم أجداد التميمية)، وأصول كردية (الأكراد)، وأصول عربية سورية (الجعابرة من قلعة جعبر على الضفاف السورية من نهر الفرات على بعد 35 من مدينة الرقة)، وأصول مغربية، وتركية، كما هاجر إلى الخليل عائلات من مدن فلسطينية مختلفة (القدس وعسقلان، أو من جبل الخليل مثل دورا ويطا على سبيل المثال). وانضم إلى السكان بعد النكبة عام 1948 عددا غير معروف من اللاجئين، الذين سكنوا داخل المدينة واختلطوا بأهلها.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالزراعة\nعلى الصعيد الزراعي عرفت الخليل منذ القدم بأنها مدينة تحيط بها الأراضي الزراعية من كل جانب واشتهرت في زراعة العنب والتين واللوز والمشمش والزيتون وتزرع الحبوب، والزراعة هي من أهم الحرف التي يمارسها السكان في محافظة الخليل، وهي تمثل موردًا اقتصاديًا هامًا، وقد بلغت المساحة المزروعة 338,400 دونم عام 2006-2007 ومن أهم المحاصيل الزراعية في الخليل الحبوب والخضار، والأشجار المثمرة مثل الزيتون واللوز والعنب والفواكة الأخرى، وتضم الخليل عددًا كبيرًا من الثروة الحيوانية، إذ تشكل 30.2% من جملة هذه الثروة في الضفة الغربية، ومن أهم أنواع الحيوانات الماعز والضأن.\n\nالصناعة\nمارس سكان الخليل الصناعة منذ القدم، حيث انتشرت الصناعة اليدوية، بل إن بعض حارات الخليل سميت بأسماء هذه الحرف، مثل سوق الحصرية وسوق الغزل وحارة الزجاجيين، ولمحافظة الخليل شهرة في صناعة الصابون ودباغة الجلود وصناعة الأكياس الكبيرة من شعر الحيوان ومعاطف الفرو والفخار والأحذية والنسيج والصناعات الخشبية والخزف والنسيج والهدايا، وحتى عام 1978 ضمت محافظة الخليل أكثر من ثلث الوحدات الصناعية في الضفة الغربية وهي: الصناعات الغذائية، النسيج والملابس، الجلود ومنتجاتها ماعدا الأحذية، الأحذية ما عدا المطاطية الأخشاب ما عدا الأثاث، الورق ومنتجاته، النشر والطباعة، الزجاج، صناعات غير معدنية، صناعات غير حديدية، تصنيع المواد المعدنية ومشتقاتها، صناعة الأدوات الكهربائية.\nوتشتهر المدينة أيضًا بكثير من الصناعات المحلية التي تصدر أيضا إلى الخارح بكميات كبيرة وخصوصا إلى الأسواق الأوروبية، ومن أهم الصناعات في الخليل:\n\nصناعة الزجاج - وتعود إلى تاريخ المدينة القديم وقد تم نطويرها لتواكب التطور الحاضر.\nصناعة الخزف والفخار - وهي أيضا من تاريخ المدينة القديم.\nصناعة الجلود - تستخدم في صناعة الأحذية بشكل كبير حيث يتم تصدير الأحذية إلى عدة دول أهمها: إيطاليا وإسبانيا والأردن ودول الخليج. حيث تعتبر هذه الصناعة من أهم مصادر دخل المدينة.\nصناعة الملابس بكل أنواعها - تجدر الإشارة إلى أن أكبر ثوب في العالم حيك يدويا موجود في مدينة الخليل (وسجل في موسوعة غينيس).\nصناعة الباطون.\nمناشير الحجر والرخام والبلاط - وهي أيضا من أهم مصادر الدخل الاقتصادي للمدينة، حيث تصدر إلى معظم الدول الاوربية والعربية.\nصناعنة الحديد والألمنيوم.\nصناعة الدراجات الهوائية.\nصناعة النايلون\nصناعة الموازين والقبانات القديمة والحديثة.\nصناعة الألبان والمنتجات الغذائية\nصناعة الأثاث المنزلي والسجاد والعطور.\n\nالتجارة\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بالتجارة حيث يعتبر أهلها من أمهر التجار في فلسطين، وتنتشر الأسواق في الخليل بكثرة، حتى أنها تعتبر كل المدينة سوق. ولقد حظيت محافظة الخليل بمركز تجاري، إذ يأتي إليها الفلاحون والبدو من المناطق المحيطة بها على الرغم من أنها فقدت نصف قضائها عام 1948، وزادت قوة هذا المركز بعد ارتفاع مستوى المعيشة وتطور وسائل النقل فاتسعت الأسواق المركزية وشملت معظم مساحة المدينة القديمة وبنيت أسواق متخصصة جديدة.\nولقد أغلق جنود الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مؤخرا عدد كبير من المحلات التجارية في الخليل. وتأتي عملية الإغلاق في اطار السياسة التي تتبعها السلطات الإسرائيلية بكل ما يتعلق بوسط الخليل، والقائمة على نظام فصل يهدف إلى حماية البؤر الاستيطانية المتعددة التي أقيمت في هذه المنطقة. هذا النظام يتجسد من خلال الفصل الميداني والقانوني بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية، المنع الواسع والقيود المفروضة على حركة وتنقل الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن تطبيق القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. وينضاف إلى هذا كله استهداف سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين بأيدي عناصر قوات الأمن. وقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى حدوث انهيار اقتصادي وسط الخليل ورحيل السكان الفلسطينيين بصورة واسعة.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط\nما كان شارع رئيسي في المركز التجاري لمدينة الخليل، مغلق للفلسطينيين منذ عام 2000. أغلق الجيش الإسرائيلي جميع الدكاكين وأبواب المنازل. يستعمل الشارع فقط لعبور المستوطنين. في تاريخ 25.12.06 أصدر المستشار القضائي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الضفة الغربية قرار انه: تم إغلاق الشارع بالخطأ وانه لا يوجد لذلك مبرر قانوني ويجب عدم منع حركة الفلسطينيين في الشارع. رغم قرار المستشار القضائي بأن إغلاق الشارع غير قانوني إلا أن الجيش الإسرائيلي ما زال يمنع الفلسطينيين من العبور في شارع الشهداء.\nومن الشوارع المهمة شـارع عين ساره حيث يقع فيه مبنى البلدية؛ وأهم ملعب كرة قدم في المدينة ملعب الحسين والعديد من المدارس والمباني الحكومية. كما تقع فيه أيضًا مغارة عيـن سارة وهي مغارة صغيرة وفيها نبع ماء، حيث يعتقد بان سكان المدينة كانوا يستعملوها للإستحمام فيها، بمن فيهم سارة زوجة إبراهيم، لهذا نسب الاسم لها.\nومن أهم الشوارع الأخرى: باب الزاوية (مركز المدينة)، رأس الجورة (مدخل المدينة)، عين خير الدين، الجوزات، حارة

وموقعها الإستراتيجي بالإشارة إلى منطقة تل الرميدة ونمرة والبلدة القديمة. للمباني العامة كالمدرسة القيمرية والفخرية والسلطان حسن والحمامات كحمام إبراهيم الخليل وحمام داري وحمام البركة وحمام كاتبة بدر وحمام الشيخ بدير وقنوات المياه والبرك والأسبلة كسبيل الطواشي وصحن الحرم وسيف الدين سلار وسبيل وقناة العين الحمراء والرباطات والتكية والزوايا ومسجد ابن عثمان ومسجد القزازين.\nتشكيل المباني السكنية للأحواش الصغيرة والكبيرة واتصالها معا والمباني السكنية كمسكن آل سلهب ومجمع الحرباوي ومسكن آل شاهين ومسكن قصر الدويك ومسكن آل الإمام ومواد البناء من حجارة وفخار وجير ورماد ومخلوط الرماد والشيد -القصرمل- والأخشاب وبقايا الزيوت -الزيبار- وطرق إنشاء المباني من أساسات وجدران وأسقف، والحرف التقليدية في مدينة الخليل من صناعة الزجاج والفخار والخزف ودباغة الجلود وتبييض النحاس وحرفة النجارة والحدادة والغزل والنسيج ومعاصر زيت الزيتون والسمسم والحفظ بالتجفيف والتمليح والسكر وصناعة طحن الحبوب.\nلقد جاءت فكرة تأسيس لجنة إعمار الخليل القديمة عام 1996 لمعالجة مشاكل الإسكان والمساكن والمشاكل الاجتماعية وبناء علاقات محلية ودولية وتوثيق الموروث الثقافي والإشراف والترميم وعمل مخططات الحفاظ على البلدة القديمة وإشغال المباني والخدمات الاجتماعية والمتابعات القانونية والصدامات المتكررة مع الجيش والمستوطنين والأوامر العسكرية التي تمنع الترميم.\n\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن هناك مذكرة أعدتها بلدية الخليل من أجل ترشيح البلدة القديمة على لائحة التراث العالمي لليونسكو، حمايةً للمعالم الأثرية التي قامت إسرائيل بتغيير بعضها، أو بضم البعض الآخر إلى قائمة التراث اليهودي الخاص بها.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتضم الخليل مجموعة من المعالم الدينية والتاريخية والسياحية التي تشجع السياح على زيارة المدينة، وخاصة البلدة القديمة، حيث توجد بها مجموعة من المعالم السياحية والأبنية التاريخية المهمة مثل المسجد الإبراهيمي، إلى جانب وجود مجموعة من المتاحف أهمها: متحف الخليل، وتوجد فيها مجموعة من المنتزهات والحدائق العامة أهمها: منتزه الكرمل.\nومن خلال دراسة الاكتشافات الأثرية في منطقة الخليل وقضائها، من حيث خصائصها ومميزاتها ومواصفاتها والمادة الخام المستخدمة وطبيعة الرسومات، تبين أن الكنعانيين هم أول من استوطن المنطقة أقاموا فيها الكثير من مدنهم وقراهم، وبنوا الخليل القديمة، وقد بقى من هذه المدينة القديمة بعض الآثار التي تدل على مكانها. كما تحوي اثارا رومانية وبيزنطية وأموية وصليبية ومملوكية وعثمانية.\nومن خلال البحث بمورفولوجيا البلدة القديمة بالخليل من حيث هيئة العمران وتخطيط المدينة وحاراتها، يمكن تقسيمها إلى الحارات التالية: حارة القزازين وحارة السواكنة وحارة بني دار وحارة العقابة وحارة القلعة وحارة الحوشية وحارة المحتسبية وحارة مدرسة المعارف وحارة الأكراد وحارة اليهود وحارة المشارقة بالإضافة إلى الحارات المنفصلة عن البلدة القديمة كحارة قيطون وحارة الشيخ علي بكا. أما الأسواق، فهناك: سوق البازار وسوق الخواجات وسوق الخضار وسوق السكافية وسوق اللبن وسوق المغاربة وسوق القزازين.\nبعد احتلال المدينة من قبل إسرائيل في عام 1967 م شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها حيث يوجد حاليِا خمس مواقع استيطانية يهودية، مما أثر على وضع المدينة السياحي بشكل سلبي إلى حد كبير.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة الخليل مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، حيث أن المعدل العام للأمية في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nويواجه التعليم في الخليل مجموعة من التحديات، إضافة إلى أن مؤسساتها التربوية تتميز بخاصية أيضا تختلف عن باقي المؤسسات التربوية في المناطق المجاورة.\nوقد تم مؤخرًا افتتاح مشروع تحسين جودة برامج التعليم في العلوم الاجتماعية للمرحلة الأساسية العليا للصفوف الخامس - العاشر.\n\nالتعليم المدرسي\nويوجد في المدينة العديد من المدارس لمختلف المراحل الدراسية؛ حكومية، أهلية، ووكالة. وفيها عدد من المعاهد وكليات المجتمع وفيها جامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين ومعهد العروب وفيها جامعة الخليل تأسست عام 1971. وقد بلغ عدد الأبنية المدرسية في مديرية التربية والتعليم في الخليل في عام 2011 ما يزيد عن 132 مدرسة ينتظم فيها 66 ألف طالبًا وطالبة موزعين في مدارس وسط المدينة وفي المنطقة الجنوبية، وكذلك في قرى تفوح وبيت كاحل وترقوميا، كما أن هنالك 36 مدرسة تقع في منطقة H2 والتي تخضع للسيطرة الإسرائيلية الكاملة وهي الأكثر تضرراً فيما يخص الأبنية المدرسية بسبب منع الاحتلال مديرية تربية الخليل بناء الطوابق والمدارس في تلك المنطقة، وتواجه مديرية تربية الخليل ازدياد سنوي كبير في أعداد الطلبة الملتحقين بنظام التعليم الحكومي، مما يؤدي إلى اكتظاظ في الصفوف الدراسية.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nجامعة الخليل.\nجامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين.\nكلية العروب التقنية (العروب).\nجامعة القدس المفتوحة.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءًا من هوية سكان منطقة الخليل منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني، ويظهر الاختلاف بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو للهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كما تمتاز اللهجة الخليلية بطول النغمة الموسيقية والكلمات بها. أما بالنسبة للزي التقليدي، فيتميز في منطقة الخليل وجنوب الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأحمر والأبيض المقلم. كما توجد في الخليل مجموعات شبابية متعددة تهتم بالأدب والثقافة الفلسطينية والعربية، ومن أهمها الندوة الثقافية في الخليل.\n\nالأكلات الشعبية\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بكروم العنب، والتي بدورها دخلت في كثير من طعامهم، فيصنعون منه الدبس والعنطبيخ (مربى العنب) (عنب طبيخ، ويسمونه في القضاء عنبية) والخبيصة والملبن المشهور والراووق (الراووء) والبوء سما والزبيب ومخلل الحصرم.\nكما تشتهر بمنتجات الألبان وخاصة اللبن المخيض واللبن الجميد ذائع الصيت من قرى الخليل والذي يعتبر بحق من أفضل أنواع الجميد ولذلك اشتهرت الخليل بأكلة اللبن المعقود والمنسف الفلسطيني الأصل، وكذلك الجبنة البيضاء المغلية التي تؤكل مع العنب أو البطيخ أو الخيار أو مقلية محمرة أو تنقع في الماء لإزالة ملوحتها واستعمالها في الحلويات كالكنافة والقطايف.\nومن أهم الأكلات التي تشتهر بها مدينة الخليل (القدرة الخليلية)، وهي عبارة عن الأرز مع قطع لحم الخروف البلدي أو الدجاج والسمنة البلدية تطبخ في قدر نحاسي مع بعضها البعض في الفرن الشعبي، بالإضافة إلى المنسف والمقلوبة والمجدرة.\n\nالرياضة\nيلعب في الخليل عدة أندية رياضية سواء في كرة القدم أو كرة السلة أو رياضات أخرى كالفروسية، منها: الخليل الرياضي، أهلي الخليل، خليل الرحمن، وشباب الخليل - الذي يُعد أقدمها وأقدم الأندية الفلسطينية على الإطلاق (تأسس عام 1943م). شارك بعض هذه الأندية في بطولات كرة القدم في الضفة الغربية (الدوري الأردني) قبل عام 1967، وتشارك اليوم في بطولة كأس فلسطين.\nوتحوي الخليل ملعبًا يتسع لحوالي 15 ألف متفرج، وهو ملعب الحسين بن علي، تم إعادة تدشينه في عام 2009م بعد افتتاحه لأول مرة في أربعينيات القرن الفائت. كما تحوي فيها أكبر صالة رياضيه في فلسطين، تم افتتاحها سنة 2011م من خلال مباراة بكرة السلة جمعت بين فريق فلسطيني وفريق إسباني.\n\nالصحة\nعلى الصعيد الصحي في المدينة 3 مستشفيات وهي مستشفى الأميرة عالية ويحتوي على 100 سرير، ومستشفى خليل الرحمن والمستشفى الأهلي التابع لجمعية أصدقاء المريض، بالإضافة إلى العديد من العيادات الصحية وعددها في المحافظة 37 عيادة.\n\nمستشفى الأميرة عالية الحكومي.\nمستشفى محمد علي المحتسب الحكومي.\nالمستشفى الأهلي، التابع لجمعية أصدقاء

          "content": "## Overview\nHebron (Arabic: الخليل al-Ḫalīl; Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Ḥevron, Ḥeḇrôn, or Ḥebron) is an ancient city in the southern West Bank. It is the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. This makes it a significant religious site for the Abrahamic religions. In 2017, the old town was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n## Understand\nHebron is mentioned in the Bible as the home of Abraham, and the burial place of him and several generations of his family. In King David's time, Hebron was briefly the capital of the Israelite state, before the capital moved to Jerusalem. Today, Hebron is holy to both Muslims and Jews due to its association with Abraham. (Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, but Christians haven't paid as much attention to Hebron.)\nThe Jewish population of Hebron was evacuated after Arabs killed nearly 70 of them in 1929. After the 1967 war, a few Jews resettled the Jewish quarter. Today, about 500 Jews live in part of the old city of Hebron under continual Israel Defense Force protection, and with a ratio of four Israeli soldiers for each Israeli settler.\nToday, the city of Hebron is home to about 500 Jews and 200,000 Palestinians. The Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba (population 8,000) is a separate city immediately adjacent to Hebron. Hebron is divided into two sectors: H1 is entirely Palestinian and includes about 80% of the city's residents, while H2 contains all the Jews and the remainder of the Arabs. H1 is under full Palestinian control (i.e. Area A), while H2 is under full Israel control. The Cave of the Patriarchs, the main holy site in the city, is on the border between H1 and H2.\nThis has been one of the tensest places between Jews and Palestinians, as in Hebron both sides here tend to be more extreme and violent than the average for their ethnic groups. Jews here have the 1929 massacre on their minds, while Palestinians have Baruch Goldstein's 1994 massacre of praying Muslims on theirs. This is not a good place to express your opinion on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Even Jewish residents here have an often-hostile relationship with the Israel army, because they see it as being too accommodating to Palestinians. Unfortunately, the 2017 declaration of the Old Town as a UNESCO world heritage site has done little to ease the tensions, as the Israeli government protested its classification as an \"endangered\" \"Palestinian\" site, despite its Jewish heritage.\n\n## Get in\nIf you are visibly Jewish, it is probably not safe to travel unaccompanied to the \"other\" side of Hebron. However, if you look and sound like an international tourist, you should be fine on both sides.\n\n## To the Jewish side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 381 or 383 from the CBS (₪8.10) to the Jewish side of Hebron. The third from the last stop (Me'arat Hamahpela) is in front of the Cave of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side. The final stop (Beit Romano) is a five minute walk from an H1/H2 checkpoint.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Take bus 254 (₪13.50), which terminates at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, from where you can take 381 or 383 over to the Jewish side of Hebron. This transfer might be free if you show them the bus 254 ticket.\n\n## To the Palestinian side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 21 from the Sultan Suleiman bus station just out and to the right from Damascus gate. Tell them Hebron or Al-Khalil (Arabic). They will take you to a mid way drop off point at the Bethlehem bus station. From there, go to the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station where a servees (the Palestinian version of a sherut, called a serv-eese in Arabic) will deliver you to Hebron for less than ₪10.\nAlternatively, take the bus to Abu Dis and tell the bus driver you are going to Khalil.\nFrom Bethlehem – As mentioned before, from the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station (at Manger Street) a servees will deliver you to Hebron for ₪9.\nFrom Ramallah – Direct servees to Hebron depart from one of the many bus stations in Ramallah, just ask around. It might be faster to go to Bethlehem first, though.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Make your way to the last stop in front of the Church of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side, as explained before. From there just walk further passing by at least three Israeli checkpoints, with the 31.52653135.1022061 last checkpoint being a gate which \"delivers\" you to the Palestinian side. Alternatively, you can directly enter the Palestinian side via a 31.5245335.1099742 gate to the left of the Muslim entrance of the Church of the Patriarchs, after which however you will need to go through a lengthy and little depressing souq alley.\n\n## Crossing between the sides\nThere are at least two gates that allow pedestrian traffic between the Palestinian and Jewish sides. The most convenient gate for travelers is the Bab El-Zawiya crossing, a five minute walk from the Beit Romano bus stop on David Hamelech Street. Parking for Israeli registered vehicles is possible just before the crossing.\nThere is a myth that it is impossible to access the Jewish side of Hebron on foot coming from the highway/main road. However, this was likely only true in tense times, because there were no gates and metal detectors you could be checked with, although this has since changed. Generally, Palestinian taxi drivers are not allowed to drive to the Jewish side. In that case, you will need to go by taxi or bus from an Israeli town or a Jewish settlement (like Kiryat Arba). Either way, internationals can drive into the Jewish side, if your driver is not Palestinian.\nIt is now possible to make a long (25 min) walk from Kiryat Arba to the Cave of the Patriarchs directly via a stubby sidewalk. If that is not possible directly for some reason, walk via the Palestinian side and then through one of the gates coming from Be'er Sheva.\n\n## In general\nThe 31.52723935.098661 Hebron Bus Station for servees to and from the surrounding areas, and even Bethlehem and Ramallah is on the upper floors of the Jeel-Saed shopping centre along Adel Street.\nOn the Palestinian side of Hebron, taxi rides within the city shouldn't cost more than ₪10-15. For seeing sights out-of-town, it's best to take a servees taxi at the service-taxi/bus station or negotiate a fair price with a taxi driver. Make sure to agree on a price for a taxi before getting in.\nOn the Jewish side of Hebron, a 10-minute walk will take you from one end to the other.\n\n## See\n31.5248735.110711 Cave of the Patriarchs (al Haram al Ibrahimi/Ibrahimi Mosque, Ma'arat HaMachpelah/Machpelah Cave). The main religious site in the city. The cave, where the Patriarchs and their wives are buried, is deep underground. Now, people pray in a building on top of the cave, built by King Herod about 2000 years ago. The building is divided into Muslim and Jewish sections. Visitors are welcome to visit both sides when they are not being used for scheduled prayer. The Muslim side provides cloaks for women to cover up when visiting. The Muslim side contains the only known entrance to the Cave below (it is locked by a marble door), as well as the tomb-markers of Isaac and Rebecca. The tomb-markers of Abraham and Sarah lie on the border of both the Muslim and Jewish sections, while the Jewish section contains the tomb-markers of Jacob and Leah. Most of the time, half of the building is used for Muslim and half for Jewish prayer. On a few predetermined days each year, each religion gets to use the entire building. For the Jews, in addition to the normal holidays, one of these days is \"Shabbat Chayei Sarah\" each fall, on which thousands of people from all of Israel visit Hebron to commemorate Abraham's purchase of the Cave from its previous Hittite owners. For the Muslims, it is on Fridays during Ramadan, and during the Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha holiday, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son. The Cave of the Patriarchs is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the contested recognition of it led the US's and Israel's 2017 decision to leave the UNESCO on 31 Dec 2018.\n31.52514835.1056822 Beit Romano. The building of the Yeshiva built in 1901. Since 1980, it has been used by Jews as a yeshiva once again.\n31.52508735.102223 Tel Rumeida (Tel Hebron) (next to the Jewish cemetery). In this place archaeological digging revealed the ruins of a 4,500 years old city wall and staircase. On top of which a building with apartments was erected standing on pillars. In this building, also the Hebron Observatory can be found – just walk up the stairs inside of the building and hope the upper door is not locked. According to the nearby stationed Israeli Army, this is one of the most tense places in Hebron, because Palestinian and Jewish houses are built right next to each other with no fences or walls – you will notice by the different large flags posted in front of two houses.\n31.52446335.1018154 Tomb of Yishai (Jesse) and Ruth (close to Tel Hebron, follow the signs). These biblical figures are associated with King David.

They even suggest you're Jewish if you don't tell them your nationality, and might become pushy asking for money.\nThis tout-like behavior leaves some doubts whether they really stand for what they are claiming. If you just don't want to be bothered, tell them you have been here before and not interested this time. Be firm, you have nothing to fear from these guys. Hebron definitely is a very political place, but you should decide for yourself whether to take action.\nIn general, be wary of unofficial guides, which mostly will try to take you from one place to the other where you will likely buy something, so they can make their share from the shop owner. They will even ruthlessly tell you that something is closed or might take too long (like the Church of the Patriarchs), which is not true, just to make sure you spend more time potentially spending money. Better to use a regular guide with an agreed and claimable schedule.\n\n## Security\nMany people are hesitant to come to Hebron, because they get told by hostel owners (e.g. in Bethlehem, for apparent reasons) that Hebron is unsafe. However, Hebron is no less safe than any other city in the West Bank during \"peace times\". Also, if you are non-Jewish you are not a threat or target, for that matter, to/for any Palestinian, and you are likely to be greeted with the characteristic \"welcome!\" in the city center. However, in some of the Palestinian suburbs around the Kiryat Arba settlement, tourists are not a regular occurrence and a small minority of locals may be less friendly, especially if they believe you to be associated with the settlement.\nIn addition, the special situation makes it a must if you want to understand more about the conflict.\n\n## Go next\nNearby popular sights in the West Bank, that allow for a day trip from Hebron, include Tor-Safa Cave, Taffuh Underground Church, Tomb of Prophet Lot and Birkat al-Karmil (Holy Pool).\nBethlehem – The biblical birthplace of Jesus and hometown of David.\nJerusalem – Besides the Dead Sea, a central focus for most people coming to Israel.\nJericho – One of the oldest settlements in the world and the Middle East.\nNegev & Judaean – Deserts close to the Dead Sea, featuring amazing sites and desert landscapes, including the Ramon Crater and two other craters.\nHiking in the Judaean Desert – Go out to other nearby hiking trails; particularly the Mishmar and Ze'elim streams are very close by.\nDead Sea – One of the most famous things to see or do in Israel and Jordan.\nFor bus travel to destinations in Israel, Egged runs various routes from/via inside Kiryat Alba.

          "content": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name for Bethlehem in local languages is  /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning \"house of meat\", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally \"house of bread\" or \"house of food.\" The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem. In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.\n\n\"House of the god Lahmu\"\nCanaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean \"house of\", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, lahmo being the Chaldean word for \"fertility\". Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder, was \"certainly accurate\". Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: \"'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic.\" While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.\n\n\"House of war\"\nAnother suggestion is an association with the root l-h-m \"to fight\", leading to the meaning of \"house of war\" or \"house of fighting\", but this is thought unlikely.\n\nHistory\nCanaanite period\nThe earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking Bit-Laḫmi in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: \"Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!\"\nIt is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. Laḫmu was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as Leḥem. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as Beit Lahama, \"House (Temple) of Lahmu\". By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as \"Philistia\", later corrupted to \"Palestine\".\nA burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.\n\nIsraelite and Judean period\nArchaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads \"From the town of Bethlehem to the King\". According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nBiblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the \"hill country\" of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means \"fertile\", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the \"City of David\". It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried \"by the wayside\" (Genesis 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.\nWriting in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.\n\nClassical period\nThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name בית לחם (Beit Lekhem). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.\nNonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.\nAround 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.\nIn 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the \"Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.\" In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.\nIn 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.\nIn 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.\nBethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.\n\nOttoman era\nFrom 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.\nBethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).\n\nFrom 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town's growth.\nSocin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 \"Latins\" in 256 houses, 824 \"Greeks\" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.\n\nModern era\nBethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.\nJordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy's death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.\nOn December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.\n\nToday, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.\n\nGeography\nBethlehem is located at an elevation of about 775 meters (2,543 ft) above sea level, 30 meters (98 ft) higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.\nThe city is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, 75 kilometers (47 mi) west of Amman, Jordan, 59 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and 10 kilometers (6 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.\nIn the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.\n\nClimate\nBethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of 700 millimeters (28 in) of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.\nBethlehem's average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and \"the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.\" Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of \"principally Christians, Latins and Greeks\" with no Jewish inhabitants.\nThe census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).\nThe 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem's population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 \"other\").\nIn 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.\nIn the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.\n\nChristian population\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.\nThe percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that \"due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.\" The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.\nIn 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population's proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.\nA study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.\n\nEconomy\nShopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.\nCremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.\nIn 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.\nThe Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.\n\nReligious significance and commemoration\nBirthplace of Jesus\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus' parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod's impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.\nEarly Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.\n\nChristmas celebrations\nChristmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine's Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.\n\nOther religious festivals\nBethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.\n\nCulture\nEmbroidery\nThe women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its \"strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.\" Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.\n\nBethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for \"royal\" wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.\n\nMother-of-pearl carving\nThe art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.\n\nCultural centers and museums\nBethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.\n\nThe Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.\nBethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit \"high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere\". The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.\n\nLocal government\nBethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.\nBethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars (\"heads\") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.\n\nThroughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.\nThere are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.\n\nMayors\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.\n\nBethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.\n\nTransportation\nBethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.\nThe Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBethlehem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nBethlehem of Galilee\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania\nBethlehem, Wales\nStar of Bethlehem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBethlehem Municipality\nWelcome To The City of Bethlehem\nOpen Bethlehem civil society project Archived April 19, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\nPhoto: Christmas in Bethlehem, 2008 Archived November 23, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\nBethlehem Fair Trade Artisans\nBethlehem University\nBethlehem aerial photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem",
          "summary": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.",

          "content": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانية: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانية: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينية: Bethleem) هي مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة بيت لحم. تقع في الضفة الغربية التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية على بعد 10 كم إلى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمة بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافة والسياحة في فلسطين.\nللمدينة أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسة فوق كهف أو مغارة يعتقد أنها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداباً آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينة وفقًا لعلماء الآثار على يد الكنعانيين في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والآراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينة عدد من الغزاة عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقية فلسطين للفتح الأشوري والبابلي والفارسي والإغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. وأُعيد بناؤها من قبل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الأرثوذكسية اليونانية برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد أن فتح المدينة صلاح الدين الأيوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينة وأعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطرة على المدينة من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وكان من المفترض أن تُضمّن في المنطقة الدولية في إطار خطة الأمم المتحدة لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. وأُلحقت المدينة بالأردن بعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها إسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الأيام الستة. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقية أوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنية والأمنية في المدينة إلى يد السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخياً منطقة مسيحية السكان، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من أكبر المجتمعات المسيحية الفلسطينية.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحة التي تزداد أثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون إلى كنيسة المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم أكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشة عمل للحرف اليدوية. ويسكن هذه المدينة أحد أقدم المجتمعات المسيحية في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجرة. اختيرت المدينة عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينة بيت لحم أول إصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح أول مدينة تغلق في فلسطين لمدة زادت عن 70 يوماً.\n\nالتسمية\nكان يقع ضمن موقعها مکان عبادة كنعاني يدعى بیراث أربع أو برج أربع، باسم جد الكنعانيين، فتوارث الإسرائيليون المكان والتقاليد فقدموا الذبائح لإلههم يهوه في برج أربع، ويعزو البعض تسمية المدينة بيت لحم بسبب وجود مائدة التقدمة في هذا المكان (صموئيل الأول 9 : 12، 20 : 6، 6 : 29) - ویسمی تلمود أورشلیم المغارة الكبيرة في أفراتا باسم جد الأدوميين والعرب الذين ينتمي لهم الكميتيون والكنسينيون وينتسب لهم كالب، فيُقرأ في \"مدراش أیکا رباني\" (68 : 3) \"في ببرات أربع في اليهودية يأتي المسيا للعالم\". وتشير الملاحظة التابعة أن پيرات أربع هي مكان في بيت لحم وتدعي كذلك \"بيرات ملكا\" نسبة إلى برج الملك. وتذكر \"أخبار الأيام الأولى في التوراة (11 : 16) \"وكان داود حينئذ، في الحصن بينما جنود الفلسطينيين يحاصرون بيت لحم\".\nوذكر نومكينز في مجلة مؤسسة الآثار الفلسطينية الربع سنوية  أن المكان كان مرکراً لإله الخصب الكلداني «لاحمو» وذكرته رسائل تل العمارنة باسم بیت إيلي لاحاما. وكان الكنعانيون يقيمون البيوت لآلهتهم أينما اعتقدوا بوجودها وكانت منطقة بيت لحم بسيولها الخصبة أهلا أن يسكنها إله الخصب. فبنوا له معبدا يطل على السيول دعي «بيت إيلي لاحاما» الذي بقي على مر العصور وتقلب الشعوب. وأي اسم أجدر وأقدس من اسم إله لتحافظ عليه وتحترمه وتتوارته الأقوام اللاحقة. كما ذكر المؤرخ الألماني، و.شريدر في جريدة الأداب الشرقية عدد 18 لعام 1915م عن صفائح رسائل تل العمارنة أن هذا الرأي في التسمية قد ثبت وتمكن. بينما التفسيرات العبرانية لاسم بیت لحم ببيت الخبز فهي شعبية ترکت نهائيا.\nظهر رأي يتردد في المراجع بالرغم من عدم صحته وهو أن قبيلة عربية تدعم لخم سكنت هذه المنطقة، بعد نزوحها من الجزيرة العربية خمسمئة عام قبل الميلاد عندما نزح المنائيون ولحق بهم قبیلتا لخم وجذام، فسكن اللخميون الصحراء ما بين الرملة ومصر وقسم منهم في الجولان وحوران وباسان حتى مدينة نوا، أما الجذامیون فسكنوا غور الأردن من طبريا حتى اللجون، يمون وعكا، ويكفي النظر إلى تاريخ النزوح لننفي أي علاقة باسم بيت لحم الذي ذكر قبل 1800 عام قبل الميلاد. وليس لدولة اللخميين في الحيرة في العراق كذلك أي علاقة لتسمية بيت لحم. إذ ظهرت دولة اللخميين حوالي القرن الخامس ميلادي فقط.\nودُعيت ببيت لحم بافراتا وهي كلمة كلدانية معناها الخصبة (تكوين 35 : 16، 19) (منيحا 5 : 2) (راعوت 4)، وذكر المورخ اليهودي يوسفوس فلافيوس\" آن راحيل\nدفنت في بلاد افراتا\". وجدير بالذكر أن القمح البري وجد في هذه المنطقة.\nوبني الكنعانيون بيتا آخر «لإيلي لاحاما» في شمال البلاد في الجليل إلى الشمال الغربي من مدينة الناصرة وعلى بعد أحد عشر كيلومترا منها، ذكرتها التوراة عدة مرات ولربما كانت أكثر أهمية من بيت لحم الجنوب لخصب محیطها وغنى أهلها. وكانت تابعة لسبط زبلون زمن الإسرائيليين: (يشوع 19 : 10)، (قضاة 12 : 8) \nشيد الألمان الهيكليون قريتهم ببيت لحم على آثار بیت لحم القديمة عام 1901م، وبقيت مزدهرة حتى احتلها اليهود عام 1948 لتصبح يهودية، وللتفرقة عرفت بيت لحم الجنوبية باليهودية والشمالية ببيت لحم الجليل.\nوبظهور النبي داوود في بيت لحم الصغرى بزغ اسمها من الظلمة إلى النور، إذ جاء صموئيل النبي إلى بيت لحم ليصبح ابن يسي الأصغر ملكا على اليهود (صموئيل الأول 16 : 1). وفي يوم التقدمة عند اليهود سكب صموئيل الزيت من الفرن على رأس داوود وأخذ اسم هذا يعلو على اسم شاول الملك آنذاك فامتلأ حقدا عليه. ويذكر (صموئيل الأول 20 : 29) کیف اختبأ داوود من شاول خوفا منه إذ حاول قتله. واعتذر یوناشاس ابن شاول لأبيه عن صديقه داوود لعدم حضوره وليمة الملك بأنه ذهب إلى بيت لحم بمناسبة رأس الشهر القمري ليقدم الذبيحة مع أهله: وتقديم الذبيحة على هيكل مقدس، طقس، لا بد وأن الإسرائيليون توارثوه عن الكنعانين - بنت إيلي لاحاما. ويعتقد أن هذا البيت المقدس كان يطل على السهول الخصبة والصحراء الشرقية حيث تقوم اليوم المقدسات المسيحية، حيث اشتعلت نيران التقدمة لترضي إيلي لاحاما الكنعاني وثم التهمت النيران قرابين الإسرائيليين لترضي إلاههم يهوه، ثم جاءت المسيحية فالوثنية فالمسيحية ثانية لتشيد مقدساتها على أنقاض المقدسات السالفة.\n\nودعي داود بابن يسى الأفراتي (صموئيل الأول 17 : 12)  وينسب اليمالك والد زوج راعوث إلى هذا النسب أيضا (راعوث 1 : 2) ولما تزوج بوعاز التلحمي من راعوث الأرملة تمني له مواطنوه «أن يزدهر بيتها في افراتا ويشتهر في بيت لحم» (راعوت 4 : 11)  وأنجبت راعوثم بن بوعاز ابنا هو عوبید والد يسی والد داوود. فأصبح اسم هذا النسل مربتوا باسم بيت لحم، وذكر ميخا في نبواته (5 : 2) حوالي 750 عام قبل الميلاد: «أما أت يا بيت لحم أفراته وأنت صغيرة أن تكوني بين أوف يهوذا، فمنك يخرج لي الذي يكون متسلطا على إسرائيل ومخارجة منذ القديم، منذ أيام الأزل» \nكذلك ذكر في (أخبار الأيام الأولى 2 : 19، 24، 50) أن هذا النسل الذي كان يسكن محيط بيت لحم (بيت افرات) ينسب دائما لافراتا. وكل هذا يشهد أن الاسم أفراتا أطلق على المنطقة التي مركزها بيت لحم.\n\nالتاريخ\nالعهد الكنعاني\nلقد سكن الكنعانيون المدينة سنة 2000 ق.م، ويروى أن النبي يعقوب جاء إلى هذه المدينة وهو في طريقه إلى الخليل، وماتت زوجته راحيل في مكان قريب من بيت لحم يعرف اليوم بقبة راحيل وفي بيت لحم ولد الملك داوود. وتوالت عليها الأحداث، وكانت في العصور القديمة قرية متواضعة تكتنفها الأودية العميقة من جهاتها الثلاث. وكانت خصبة الموقع تنتشر فيها حقول القمح. وفي القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد -\tظهرت في مخطوطات تل العمارنة منطقة اسمها بيت لحم وذلك عند الحديث عن أنباء الحروب التي قامت جنوب القدس. من المحتمل أن أول استيطان بشري وقع فيها عندما حطت بعض جماعات من البدو حول النبع الواقع على بعد 200 متر من كنيسة الميلاد.\nتظهرُ أول إشارة تاريخية إلى المدينة في رسائل تل العمارنة (حوالي 1400 قبل الميلاد) عندما ناشد ملك القدس سيده الأعلى، ملك مصر، للحصول على المُساعدة لاستعادة السيطرة على «بيت - لحمي» في أعقاب الاضطرابات من جانب عبيرو. ويعتقد أن تشابه هذا الاسم مع شكلها الحديث يدُل على أنها كانت مُستوطنة كنعانية، الذين يملُكون ثقافية ولغوية سامية مع الوافدين على المدينة لاحقًا.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي عام 325 بعد إعلان حرية التعبد للديانة المسيحية، طلب القديس مكاريوس بطريرك القدس من الإمبراطور أن يعيد المكان المقدس، فبنت القديسة هيلانة بازيليك الميلاد. في عام 384 مع وصول القديس هيرونيموس إلى بيت لحم قام في المدينة مركز عبادة لاتيني دام بعد وفاته سنين عديدة. في عام 614 أدّى غزو جيوش كسرى إلى خراب اليهودية ولم ينج من بيت لحم سوى بازيليك الميلاد وذلك كما يقال بفضل رسم للمجوس قائم على جدار البازيليك. والمجوس وهم ملوك الفرس الذين سجدوا ليسوع الطفل بحسب الرواية الإنجيلية.\n\nاستمدت بيت لحم شهرتها العالمية الكبرى من مولد يسوع فيها. ويروى أن يوسف النجار، ومريم العذراء ذهبا إلى بيت لحم لتسجيل اسمهما في الإحصاء العام، فولدت مريم وليدها هناك. وترى المصادر المسيحية أن الولادة كانت في مغارة قريبة من القرية، ولكن القرآن (يقول): (فاجأها المخاض إلى جذع النخلة) وفي سنة 330 م بنت هيلانة أم قسطنطين الكبير، كنيسة فوق المغارة التي قيل إن يسوع ولد فيها، وهي اليوم أقدم كنيسة في العالم. والمغارة تقع داخل كنيسة الميلاد، ومنحوته في صخر كلسي، وتحتوي على غرفتين صغيرتين، وفي الشمالية منها بلاطة رخامية، منزل منها نجمة فضية، حيث يقال أن يسوع ولد هناك. وعندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس، توجه إلى بيت لحم، وفيها أعطى سكانها أمانًا خطيًا على أرواحهم وأولادهم وممتلكاتهم وكنائسهم. ولما حان وقت الصلاة، صلى بإشارة من راهب، أمام الحنية الجنوبية للكنيسة، التي أخذ المسلمون يقيمون فيها صلواتهم، فرادى، وجعل الخليفة على النصارى إسراجها وتنظيفها. وهكذا صار المسلمون والمسيحيون يقيمون صلواتهم جنباً إلى جنب.\nتذكر بيت لحم في العهد الجديد باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع: «ولما ولد يسوع في بيت لحم اليهودية» (مت 2: 1 5، لو 2: 4 15)، ونتيجة لذلك حدثت مذبحة الأطفال الأبرياء بأمر هيرودس الملك (مت 2: 8 و16). وحيث أن هادريان قد جرب بيت لحم تماما، واقام في موضعها نصبا مقدسا للاله «ادونيس»، فلابد ان تكريم تلك المدينة باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع، يرجع إلي ما قبل عصر هادريان (132 م). وقد اقام قسطنطين الملك (حوالي 330 م) كنيسة على الطراز الروماني فوق موقع كهف المذود الذي شهد مولد يسوع. وتعتبر هذه الكنيسة حتى اليوم أهم مقصد للسياح، في المدينة. وهي لم يطرا عليها تغيير كبير، رغم أن جستنيان قد وسع فيها وزينها، ورغم ما تعرضت له من تهدم وترميم.\n\nالحكم العربي الإسلامي\nفي سنة 648 م دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الإسلامي، وزارها الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب الذي لم يصلّ داخل كنيسة المهد، خوفاً من أن تحدث نزاعات في المستقبل على الكنيسة بين المسلمين والمسيحيين حيث صلى بجانبها. وكانت المدينة قد اُلحقت بجند فلسطين التابع لولاية الشام بعد أن تم فتح جميع أراضي بلاد الشام على يد عدد من القادة منهم عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح.\nيشار إلى أنه تم بناء مسجد في بيت لحم عام 1860 وهو مسجد عمر نسبة للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب، والذي تم ترميمه حتى العام 1954 تحت الإدارة الأردنية للمدينة. وكانت الأرض التي تم بناء المسجد عليها تم التبرع بها من قبل الكنيسة الأرثوذكسية اليونانية.\nوقد عاش أبناء الديانتين المسيحية والإسلامية في هذه المدينة بروح من الإخاء والتعاون وتمارس كل فيهما شعائرها الدينية ونشاطاتها الاقتصادية الاجتماعية على الرغم من أن المدينة تعرضت لفترات من المد والجزر حسب الحكم القائم، ومن أكثر العهود ازدهارًا بالنسبة لبيت لحم هو زمن هارون الرشيد 786-809 م والدولة الفاطمية 952-1094 م، حيث راجت التجارة وتيسرت الحرية والأمن ورممت الكنائس وأماكن العبادة.\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nفي 1099 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الصليبي بعد أن دخلها الجيش الصليبي بقيادة تانكرد فدمر المدينة واحرقها ولم يتبق منها إلا كنيسة المهد. لم يكتف الصليبيون بما حازوا عليه، فقاموا بتوسيع حدود المملكة، ومع أواخر يوليو 1099 غزوا شمال فلسطين، ثم وصل جيش الفاطميين في 12 أغسطس فالتقى وجيش المملكة الوليدة في عسقلان، وأحرز الصليبيون نصرًا هامًا ضمن لهم السيطرة على الساحل الفلسطيني؛ وقد دار خلاف بين أمراء المملكة حول طبيعة الدولة بين كونها دولة دينية يحكمها أسقفها ديبامرت مبعوث البابا، أو دولة مدنية يحكمها جودفري، واتفق أخيرًا على كونها دولة مدنية وذلك بمباركة ديبامبرت مبعوث البابا إلى المملكة، رغم أن طموحه هذا عاد للظهور بعد وفاة جودفري. عام 1100 توفي جودفري بنتيجة المرض، وخلفه شقيقه بالدوين الأول المتحدر من بولونيا وقد انتخب في 11 نوفمبر وتمّ التتويج في بيت لحم يوم 25 ديسمبر 1100 وهو يوم عيد الميلاد، بعد تنافس مع تانكرد والأسقف ديامبرت حول وراثة العرش، وقد تم إرضاء تانكرد بمنحه إمارة أنطاكية بعد أسر أميرها في حلب. أما بالدوين فكان أول من خلع عليه لقب «ملك المملكة اللاتينية في القدس»، ما شكل ترسيخًا لهوية الدولة الجديدة، وقد قسمت الدولة إلى أربع مطرانيات وأبرشيات عديدة تحت سلطة بطريرك القدس.\nوقد دام الحكم الصليبي لبيت لحم حتى عام 1187 حيث عادت لأصحابها بعد انتصار المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على الصليبين في معركة حطين. وفي عام 1229 عادت مدينة بيت لحم لحكم الصليبين بموجب الاتفاقية التي وقعت بين ممثلي الخليفة الكامل فخر الدين وأمير أربيل صلاح الدين وممثلي الإمبراطور فريدريك. لكنهم فقدوها نهائيا بعد عدة سنين فقط.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nفي عام 1244 تمكن المسلمون بقيادة نجم الدين من استعادة المدينة بشكل نهائي، قام بعدها الظاهر بيبرس بدخول المدينة عام 1263 ودمرا أبراجها وهدم أسوارها، وفي عام 1517 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني، وبعد تطور وسائل النقل والمواصلات تحولت المدينة إلى مركز جذب هام للحجاج القادمين من أوروبا وانعكست أثاره على الأوضاع في المدينة وازدهرت صناعة الصوف والخزف وغيرها إلا أن سوء الأوضاع الاقتصادية دفع بالكثير من أبناء المدينة إلى الهجرة خارجها.\nفي القرن التاسع عشر - ومع بداية القرن الماضي أخذت المدينة بالنمو خاصة على أيدي المسيحيين الذين كانوا يشكلون الأكثرية العظمى. في عام 1831، عندما احتل محمد علي باشا مصر المدينة، طرد المسلمون المسيحيين وأمر الباشا بهدم حيّهم. وبعد عشرة أيام أعاد الأتراك بناءه.\nمن 1831 إلى 1841، كانت فلسطين تحت حكم أسرة محمد علي من مصر. خلال هذه الفترة، عانت المدينة من الزلازل الذي ضربها، فضلًا عن تدمير القوات المصرية لحي مسلم في عام 1834، على ما يبدو أنتقامًا لمقتل أحد الموالين لرعاية إبراهيم باشا. في عام 1841، أصبحت بيت لحم تحت سيطرة الحكم العثماني مرة أخرى وظلت كذلك حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى. في العهد العثماني، من المشاكل التي واجهتها سكان بيت لحم البطالة والخدمة العسكرية الإجبارية والضرائب الثقيلة، مما أدى إلى هجرة جماعية خاصة إلى أميركا الجنوبية.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت بيت لحم بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى المنطقة المدوّلة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قام الأردن بضمها مع سائر مناطق الضفة الغربية عام 1951. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى حرب 1967.\nارتفعت درجة بيت لحم الإدارية بعد أن كانت (ناحية) في العهد العثماني إلى (قضاء) في العهد البريطاني، يقع بين اقضية القدس والخليل وأريحا. وبقي كذلك لعام 1944 م حيث الغي هو وقضاء اريحا والحقا بقضاء القدس. فكان ذلك آخر تغيير إداري قامت به الحكومة البريطانية في فلسطين.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكان نصيب بيت لحم أن يتم الحاقها بالمنطقة المدولة مع القدس.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة.\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي بيت لحم وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة بيت لحم بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع بيت لحم مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة بيت لحم قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 21 ديسمبر 1995، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من بيت لحم، وبعد ثلاثة أيام أصبحت المدينة تحت إدارة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وسيطرتُها العسكرية الكاملة بناءً على الاتفاق الانتقالي بشأن الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة في عام 1995. وأصبحت المدينة مُنذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nخلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، في 2000-2001، تضررت بشدة البنية التحتية في بيت لحم والسياحة. وفي عام 2002، كانت المدينة منطقة القتال الرئيسية في عملية الدرع الواقي، عملية عسكرية كبرى من جانب الجيش الإسرائيلي.\nخلال العملية، قام الجيش الإسرائيلي بمُحاصرة كنيسة المهد، حيث كان حوالي 200 مسلح فلسطيني لجأوا إلى الكنيسة. واستمر الحصار لمدة 39 يومًا وقتلوا تسعة من المسلحين ورجل كنيسي. انتهى الحصار باتفاق على نفي 13 من المسلحين المطلوبين إلى دول أوروبية مختلفة وموريتانيا.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nلبيت لحم أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). في بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وذلك فوق كهف أو مغارة، والتي يعتقد أنها الإسطبل الذي ولد فيه يسوع. يعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداب آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قد قضى ثلاثين عاما من حياته فيه يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\n\nيفهم من هذا النص أن يوسف ومريم لم يجدا لهما مكانا في منزل كمهام المعروف في بيت لحم فنزلا في مغارة تأوي اليها البهائم ويروي متى الإنجيلي أنه بعد ولادة يسوع، قام بعض المجوس من الشرق بزيارة هيرودس للاستعلام عن مكان «الشخص الذي ولد ملكا لليهود»، لأنهم رأوا نجمه في الشرق. كان هيرودس، ملك اليهود، قلقًا من احتمال أن يفقد عرشه. قام هيرودس بتجميع رؤساء الكهنة وكتّاب الشعب وسألهم أين وُلد «الممسوح» (المسيح، باليونانية: Ὁ Χριστός، هو كريستوس). أجابوا: في بيت لحم، حيث تنبا ميخا قبل سبعمئة وخمسين عاما عن قدومه «وانت يا بيت لحم ارض يهوذا لست الصغرى بین روساء يهوذا لأن منك يخرج مدبر يرعی شعبي اسرائيل». أرسل هيرودس المجوس إلى بيت لحم، وأمرهم بالبحث عن الطفل، وبعد أن يعثروا عليه، «أن يخبروه عنه، حتى يذهب هو أيضاً ليعبده». وقدم المجوس إلى بيت لحم وقدّموا للمولود هدايا من ذهب ولبان ومر. وانصرفوا من طريق آخر مارین بحقل الرعاة شرقا كي لا يقابلوا هيرودس الذي ظنوا فيه شرا بعد أن تم تحذيرهم في حلم بعدم إبلاغ هيرودس. وبالمثل، تم تحذير يوسف في حلم أن هيرودس كان يعتزم قتل يسوع، لذلك فر هو وعائلته إلى مصر. عندما أدرك هيرودس أنه قد خدع، أصدر أوامر بقتل جميع الأولاد الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سنتين في بيت لحم والمناطق المجاورة لها من ابن عامين فما دون لعله يقتل الطفل المولود بينهم. بقي يوسف وعائلته في مصر حتى وفاة هيرودس، ثم انتقلوا إلى الناصرة في الجليل لتجنب العيش تحت حكم أرخيلاوس ابن هيرودس.\nتُذكر رواية الميلاد في إنجيلي متى ولوقا، وتغدوا الرواية في إنجيل لوقا أكثر تفصيلاً؛ عناصر الرواية الإنجيلية للميلاد مفادها أن مريم قد ظهر لها جبرائيل مرسلاً من قبل الله وأخبرها أنها ستحبل بقوّة الروح القدس بطفل «يكون عظيمًا وابن العلي يدعى، ولن يكون لملكه نهاية»،لوقا 1/32] وعندما اضطرب يوسف النجار خطيب مريم من روايتها ظهر له الملاك أيضًا في الحلم تصديقًا لرواية مريم وتشجيعًا له، ويتفق متى ولوقا أن الميلاد قد تمّ في بيت لحم مدينة النبي داود لا في مدينة الناصرة حيث كانا يعيشان وحيث تمت البشارة، يعود ذلك تتميمًا للنبؤات السابقة حول مكان الميلاد سيّما نبؤة النبي ميخا، أما السبب المباشر فهو طلب أغسطس قيصر إحصاء سكان الإمبراطورية الرومانية تمهيدًا لدفع الضرائب، ولذلك سافر يوسف مع مريم وكان حينها قد ضمها إلى بيته كزوجته دون أن تنشأ بينهما علاقة زوجية، وعند وصولهما إلى بيت لحم لم يجدا مكانًا للإقامة في فندق أو نزل وحان وقت وضع مريم، فبحسب إنجيل لوقا وضعت طفلها في مذود ولفته بقماط.لوقا 2/7] وإن ذكر المذود هو الدافع الأساسي للاعتقاد بوجود المغارة أو الحظيرة، لأن الحظائر عادة كانت عبارة عن كهوف أما المذود فهو مكان وضع علف الحيوانات، وكان أوريجانوس قد أثبت المغارة وقال أنه نقل القصة عن تقاليد أقدم.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيت لحم 31°43′0″N 35°12′0″E وعلى ارتفاع حوالي 775 متر (2,543 قدم) فوق مستوى سطح البحر، 30 مترا (98 قدم) أعلى من القدس. بيت لحم وتقع في الجزء الجنوبي من جبال الخليل.\nتقع المدينة على بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس، 73 كيلومترًا (45 ميل) شمال شرق قطاع غزة والبحر المتوسط، و 75 كيلومترًا (47 ميل) إلى الغرب من عمان عاصمة الأردن، و 59 كيلومترًا (37 ميل) إلى الجنوب الشرقي من تل أبيب وعلى بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس.\n\nمن المدن والبلدات القريبة تشمل بيت صفافا والقدس في الشمال، وبيت جالا إلى الشمال الغربي، حوسان إلى الغرب، الخضر وأرطاس إلى الجنوب الغربي، وبيت ساحور إلى الشرق. وتقع بيت جالا، وبيت ساحور تُشكل تجمع مع بيت لحم وتقع مخيمات اللاجئين عايدة ومخيم بيت جبرين داخل حدود المدينة.\nتقع البلدة القديمة في وسط المدينة، وتتألف من ثمانية أرباع سكنية (أحياء)، المبنية بأسلوب الفسيفساء التي تشكل المنطقة المحيطة ساحة كنيسة المهد. الأرباع تضمُ المسيحيين وربع واحد فقط يضمُ مسلمين. سُميت معظم الأحياء المسيحية حسب أسماء عشائر الغساسنة العربية التي استقرت هُناك. وشكل المغتربين العرب المسيحيين حي القواوسة الذين أتوا من تقوع في القرن الثامن عشر. هُناك أيضًا ربع السريانية يقع خارج البلدة القديمة، تعود أصول سكانها من مديات وماسارتي «وMa'asarte» في تركيا. يبلغ عدد سُكان البلدة القديمة 5,000 نسمة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nمناطق المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة في بيت لحم أهم مناطقها على الإطلاق لوجود أهم المعالم الدينية المسيحية فيها، وهي تتوسط المدينة وشوارعها. من أهم تلك الشوارع: طريق الخليل، الشارع الجديد، شارع بيت ساحور، شارع بولس السادس، شارع السينما، شارع الفرير، شارع جمال عبد الناصر.\nالمخيمات\n\nتضم منطقة بيت لحم ثلاثة مخيمات رئيسية هي مخيم عايدة، مخيم بيت جبرين، ومخيم الدهيشة. ومثلها مثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسست فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها الأونروا من الحكومة الأردنية.\n\nمخيم عايدة: تأسس عام 1950 بين مدينتي بيت لحم وبيت جالا. ويمتد فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,71 كيلومتر مربع لم تنم بشكل كاف مع نمو مجتمع اللاجئين. ولذلك، فإن المخيم يعاني من مشاكل اكتظاظ شديدة.\nمخيم بيت جبرين: تأسس عام 1950 في قلب مدينة بيت لحم. وهو يعد أصغر مخيم للاجئين في الضفة الغربية حيث تبلغ مساحته 0.02 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وغالبا ما يطلق على المخيم أيضا اسم مخيم عزة.\nمخيم الدهيشة: تأسس عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.31 كيلومتر مربع ضمن حدود بلدية بيت لحم.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في بيت لحم مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتر.\n\nالسكان\nوفقًا لسجلات الضرائب العثمانية، شكل المسيحيون نسبة 60% من السكان في القرن السادس عشر، وفي منتصف القرن 16 أصبحت أعداد المسلمين والمسيحيين متساوية. لم يكن هناك مسلمون في نهاية القرن، وبلغ عدد سكانها 287 (سجل الذكور البالغين دافعي الضرائب). وطلب آنذاك من المسيحيين وغير المسلمين دفع ضريبة الجزية في جميع أنحاء الدولة العثمانية. في عام 1867، وصف زائر أمريكي المدينة الذي بلغ عدد سكانها 3,000 إلى 4,000 منهم 100 يتبعون البروتستانتية و 300 من المسلمين و«ما تبقى ينتمون إلى الكنائس اللاتينية واليونانية مع نسبة قليلة من الأرمن»  ووفقًا لتقرير آخر من نفس العام بلغ عدد السكان المسيحيين 3000، وبالإضافة إلى 50 من المسلمين.\nفي عام 1948، شكلت المسيحية نسبة 85% من التركيبة السُكانية للمدينة معظمها من الطوائف اليونانية الأرثوذكسية والكاثوليكية، أما نسبة المسلمين بلغت 13% مسلم سني.\nوفقًا للإحصائيات الإسرائيلية عام 1967، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 14,439 نسمة منهم 7,790 نسمة مسلمين ما نسبته 53,9% بينما بلغ عدد المسيحيين 6,231 نسمة ما يعادل 46,1% من سكان بيت لحم.\nوفقًا لتعداد الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء عام 1997، فقد بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 21,670 نسمة، بما في ذلك 6,570 لاجئ وهو ما يمثل 30.3% من سكان المدينة. وفي عام 1997، أما التوزيع العمري السكاني لفترات عُمرية مختلفة كالتالي: 27,4% تحت سن عشرة سنوات و 20% 10-19 سنة و 17.3% 20-29 سنة، 17.7% 30-44 سنة و 12.1% 45-64 سنة و 5.3% فوق سن 65 عامًا. بلغ عدد الذكور 11,079 أما عدد الإناث 10,594.\nوفقا لتقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 29,930 نسمة في مُنتصف عام 2006. ومع ذلك، في تعداد 2007 كشف عن وجود 25,266 نسمة منهم 12,753 ذكورًا و 12,513 من الإناث. و 6,709 وحدة سكنية منها 5,211 كانت للأُسر. أما مُتوسط عدد أفراد الأسر 4,8.\nبحلول عام 2005، كانت نسبة السكان المسيحيين تراجعت بشكل كبير، إلى حوالي 40% من 50%. المسجد الوحيد في المدينة القديمة هو مسجد عمر، ويقع في ساحة كنيسة المهد.\n\nالدين\nيدعى الكثير من سكان بيت لحم المسيحيين أنهم ينحدرون من العشائر المسيحية العربية التي قدمت من شبه الجزيرة العربية، أكبر هذه العشائر في المدينة: الفراحية ونجاجرة. العشائر السابقة الذكر قد تنحدرُ من الغساسنة الذين هاجروا من اليمن إلى منطقة وادي موسى في الوقت الحاضر الأردن في حين أن النجاجرة تنحدر من العرب في نجران في جنوب الحجاز. عشيرة عريقة أخرى في المدينة هي عناترة وتنحدر أصولهم من شبه الجزيرة العربية.\n\nأنخفضت أعداد المسيحيين في المدينة بشكل مُطرد، ويرجع ذلك في المقام الأول إلى الهجرة. انخفاض معدل مواليد المسيحيين يمثل أيضًا سببًا للانخفاض. في عام 1947، بلغت نسبة المسيحيين حوالي 85%، ولكن بحلول عام 1998 انخفضت النسبة إلى 40%. في عام 2005، وضح رئيس بلدية بيت لحم فيكتور بطارسة أن \"نتيجة للتوتر سواء الجسدي أو النفسي والحالة الاقتصادية السيئة، كثير من الناس يهاجرون، سواء مسيحيين أو مسلمين، لكن الهجرة أكثر أنتشارًا بين المسيحيين، لأنهم بالفعل هم أقلية.\nأدت اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية إلى أنخفاض ناتج القطاع السياحي والتي أثرت على الأقلية المسيحية وعلى أصحاب الفنادق في بيت لحم الذين يقدمون خدمات المُلبية لإحتياجات السياج الأجانب. أشير تحليل إحصائي لهجرة المسيحيين من المدينة لانعدام الفرص الاقتصادية والتعليمية، خصوصًا الطبقة الوسطى والمتعلمة منهم. مُنذ اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، غادر 10% من السكان المسيحيين المدينة.\nذكرت الصحيفة الإسرائيلية جيروزليم بوست ان «تقلص أعداد الطوائف المسيحية الفلسطينية في الأراضي المقدسة وبشكل خاص في بيت لحم جاء كنتيجة مباشرة بسبب انتمائها إلى الطبقة المتوسطة والعليا». يذكر أن المسيحيين لديهم صورة عامة كنخبة متعلمة وذات امتيازات طبقية، وكذلك عدم لجوئهم إلى العنف، مما يجعلهم أكثر عرضة للتعرض لأعمال عنف. يُذكر أن بسبب الهجرة المسيحية يتواجد غالبية مسيحيين بيت لحم خارج العالم العربي بشكل خاص في أمريكا اللاتينية التي تضم نصف مليون فلسطيني في أمريكا اللاتينية والوسطى حيث أن 80 إلى 85% منهم هم من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين. وتضم التشيلي أكبر جالية فلسطينية مسيحية في العالم خارج منطقة فلسطين حيث يصل أعدادهم إلى 350,000 وتعود أصول غالبيتهم إلى بيت لحم وبيت جالا وبيت ساحور ويعتبرون من الاقليات الناجحة جدًا فغالبيتهم ينتمون إلى الطبقة العليا والوسطى ومن المتعلمون كما وقد برز عدد منهم في السياسة والاقتصاد والثقافة.\nفي عام 2006، ووفقًا للاستطلاع الذي أجراهُ المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث والحوار الثقافي في المدينة أن 90% من المسيحيين قالوا أن لديهم أصدقاء مسلمين، ووافق 73,3% منهم على أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية تُعامل التراث المسيحي في المدينة باحترام ونسب 78% منهم سبب هجرة المسيحيين إلى القيود الإسرائيلية التي تفرُضها على السفر.\nإن مدينة بيت لحم هي من أقدس المواقع المسيحية في العالم كونها المدينة التي فيها وُلِدَ يسوع المسيح، وبسبب قدسية مدينة بيت لحم لدى العالم المسيحي تتواجد في المدينة عدد كبير من الكنائس والأديرة فضلًا عن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة، بالإضافة إلى المؤسسات المسيحيّة المختلفة من مدراس وجامعة كاثوليكية ومستشفيات شتى، وكونها مدينة ميلاد يسوع تُحظى المدينة بشعبية واسعة وترتبط بعيد الميلاد. كانت كنيسة المهد هي الأولى بين الكنائس الثلاث التي بناها الإمبراطور قسطنطين في مطلع القرن الرابع الميلادي حين أصبحت المسيحية ديانة الدولة الرسمية وكان ذلك استجابة لطلب الأسقف ماكاريوس في المجمع المسكوني الأول في نيقيه عام 325 للميلاد. دخلت كنيسة المهد سنة 2012 قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، كنيسة المهد هي أول موقع فلسطيني يدرج ضمن لائحة التراث العالمي لمنظمة اليونيسكو. الجدول

طرازان معماريان مختلفان: الطراز القديم السائد في البلدة القديمة حيث القباب والجدران السميكة المبنية من الحجر الكلسي والشبابيك والأبواب على شكل أقواس، والمباني فيها ملتصقة ببعضها ومتراصة وشوارعها ضيقة ومقسمة إلى حارات لكي يسهل الدفاع عنها. أما الطراز الثاني فهو الطراز الحديث السائد في مناطق السكن الجديدة حيث البيوت الحديثة المستقلة أو العمارات المكونة من طبقات.\nويطوق المدينة الآن مجموعة من المستوطنات التي يطلق عليها مجموعة (غوش عتسيون) ووصل عدد المستوطنات حولها عام 1985 إلى 16 مستوطنة وتشكل مستوطنة افرات مركزها وأكبرها، ويخطط لإقامة 9 مستوطنات حتى عام 2010.\nكونها المدينة التي شهدت

مع معطف بلا أكمام من الصوف المنسوج محليًا التي تُلبس فوق الفساتين. تمتازُ الفساتين للمُناسبات الخاصة بأنها مصنوعة من الحرير المُقلم مع أكمام مُجنحه مع سترة قصيرة «تقصيرة» والمعروفة باسم سترة بيت لحم. التقصيرة مُصنعة من المخمل أو الجوخ، وعادة تكون مع تطريز كثيف.\nالتطريز التحريري لمنطقة بيت لحم يجمع بين الفضة والذهب وخيوط الحرير لتزيين واجهة وجوانب وأكمام ثياب الزفاف التقليدية، وحيث تملأ هذه

          "content": "## Overview\nBethlehem (Arabic: بيت لحم, Beit Lahm, Hebrew: בית לחם Beit Lechem) is a small city located some 10 km (6 miles) south of the Old City of Jerusalem within the West Bank, in an \"Area A\" zone administered by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n## History\nThe \"little town\" of Bethlehem, mentioned in Christmas carols, attracts pilgrims worldwide on account of its description in the New Testament (and particularly the Gospels) as the Biblical birthplace of Jesus, whom Christians believe to be Messiah and Son of God. The Church of the Nativity, one of the oldest churches in the world, is the focus of Christian veneration within the city. Modern textual analysis has almost universally drawn the conclusion that Nazareth, the place where Jesus spent most of his later life and the home town of Joseph and Mary was probably his actual birthplace, but that has not lessened the draw of this city for Christian pilgrims.\nBethlehem is also revered by Jews and Muslims as the birthplace and home town of David, Biblical prophet and King of Israel, as well as the traditional site of Rachel's Tomb (on the outskirts of the town).\nAlthough also home to many Muslims, Bethlehem remains home to one of the largest Arab Christian communities in the Middle East (despite significant emigration which has resulted in a growing Muslim majority) and one of the chief cultural and tourism drawcards for the Palestinian community. The Bethlehem agglomeration also includes the small towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour, the latter also having Biblical significance.\nBuilding up to the Millennium in the year 2000, Bethlehem underwent a massive largely foreign-funded project called Bethlehem 2000 in hopes of turning Bethlehem into a major tourist destination comparable to destinations such as Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in tourism infrastructure. Unfortunately, a year later, the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation occurred and the ensuing violence, including a standoff between Palestinian fighters holed up in the Church of the Nativity and Israeli troops, scuttled these tourism efforts. Although tension remains high in Israeli-Palestinian relations, violence is a thing of the past in Bethlehem and many in Bethlehem hope to continue on where Bethlehem 2000 started them off.\nThis article also covers nearby towns, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\n## Orientation\nA long snake of town, the main thoroughfare of Bethlehem is Manger Street which stretches from Rachel's Tomb (and the road to Jerusalem) all the way to Manger Square, the focal point of the city. Manger Square is flanked by the Church of the Nativity on one side and the Mosque of Omar on the other. The Old Town and the souq (market), which are best navigated on foot, stretch up the hill from Manger Square.\nThe name means \"The House of Bread\" in Hebrew, and \"The House of Meat\" in Arabic. However, it seems likely that both meanings have been retrofitted onto what was originally the House of Lachma, the Mesopotamian god of fertility. The area has been settled since 5,000 BC and there is some evidence that the town is mentioned in the Egyptian Amarna letters (1400 BC). The Old Testament Book of Ruth (c. 1150 BC) has the first certain reference to Bethlehem; it tells the story of Naomi, who left Bethlehem during a famine, and later returned with her daughter-in-law Ruth. Still, Bethlehem remained a small town in the shadow of mighty Jerusalem, and according to most estimates, it had some 300 to 1000 inhabitants at the time of the event that gave Bethlehem its fame, namely the birth of Jesus.\nSomewhat surprisingly, aside from noting that the Nativity indeed took place there, the New Testament virtually ignores Bethlehem. And things didn't change immediately afterwards: wrecked during the Bar-Kochba revolt (132-135 AD), the Romans set up a shrine to Adonis on the site of the Nativity. Only in 326 was the first Christian church constructed, when Helen, the mother of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, visited Bethlehem. Afterwards, it grew slowly but steadily, achieving its pinnacle as a strong fortified city during the Crusader era, but the Ottomans razed the fortifications and reduced Bethlehem back into the village it was 2000 years earlier.\nThe setback proved only temporary, and despite the turbulence of the 20th century the town has (as of 2000) grown to an estimated 184,000 inhabitants. On December 21, 1995, Bethlehem became one of the areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. In the city, 41% of the population is Christian, while 59% is Muslim. Christians used to be a large majority, but their numbers have declined throughout the 20th century. Although Arabic is the language of Bethlehem's inhabitants, English, French and other languages are widely spoken and understood by many people in Bethlehem.\nAlthough Bethlehem is a Palestinian town, it is also tourist-oriented. Because of Bethlehem's immense potential as a tourism magnet, the Palestinian Authority maintains a constant tourist police presence in the city. For example, if there is combat in Southern Israel and the Gaza Strip, this does not mean that trips to other Palestinian cities such as Bethlehem are unsafe. Bethlehem is a safe place for tourists to visit, and tourist numbers are increasing to this hidden gem of the Holy Land.\n\n## Local information\nBethlehem municipal\n\n## Get in\nMost travellers arrive via Jerusalem. Since Bethlehem is administered by the Palestinian Authority, there are security checks conducted by the Israeli military on access roads. When coming via the highway there are no barriers when going to Bethlehem, however on the other side there is 31.7053535.168831 highway 60 checkpoint on the road to Jerusalem. For instance, in case you're traveling by bus, soldiers will board to check the passengers' identity documents. On the local road north of Bethlehem, there's a bigger checkpoint (\"Rachel's Crossing\"/Checkpoint 300). To cross, one shows their passport to an Israeli soldier, places his/her bags into an x-ray machine and then walks through a metal detector, much like airport security. As with all areas under Palestinian Authority control, Israeli law forbids Israeli citizens to enter unless they receive approval from the Israeli Civil Administration. Tourists are free to enter and exit Bethlehem and go back to Jerusalem as many times as they would like without any restrictions. Make sure you bring your passport with your Israeli-issued tourist visa to enter and exit the Palestinian areas.\n\n## By car\nBe careful when using a hired car, as some/many rental companies in Israel make it clear that the car has to be used, and remain, on Israeli soil.\n\n## By bus\nFrom Jerusalem's HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate (\"Bab el-'Amoud\") bus 231 runs from here into Bethlehem (via Beit Jala). Even though the bus stop sign does not list it, bus 231 can also be boarded at the bus stop out of the Jaffa Gate and down the road a little – the bus comes from the tunnel. The average trip length is 30 min and costs ₪6.80. The 31.7119735.1992 last stop from Jerusalem in Bethlehem is along Hebron Road about 20 min walk from the Church of the Nativity away. Also, shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave from nearby Damascus Gate and manage the trip in 20 min.\nPalestinian bus 234 also leaves from HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate. It costs ₪4.70 and runs directly to the 31.72445535.2038233 Jerusalem-Bethlehem Checkpoint (Checkpoint 300) and back. From the checkpoint, you can either walk half an hour or take a taxi to the center of Bethlehem (₪10–25), which is about 3 km away. Egged bus 163 also goes here from the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, halting for instance at the Jaffa Gate bus stop. Travel time from Jaffa Gate is 30 min, price is ₪5.90.\nFrom Ramallah many shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave for Bethlehem. It is just a little pain to figure out the right bus station out of the (at least) four ones in Ramallah. The trip takes about an hour, goes all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nThe trip from Hebron with the final stop at the very bottom floor of the 31.70625535.2052384 Bethlehem bus station (only shared taxis (sherut)) will deliver you for less than ₪10.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxis (sherut/servees) for ₪12 to 31.76409335.2811625 Al Ezariya (Junction), a town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the driver where to get off to get to Bethlehem or take the GPS pointer as orientation. From the junction take another shared taxis to Bethlehem bus station (₪5-10).\n\n## On foot\nDevoted pilgrims often prefer to walk (and in happier times there has been a large procession at Christmas), at a brisk pace the trip is doable in 2 hr but there are plenty of ups and downs along the way and the summer heat is fearsome.\n\n## Get around\nBut Bethlehem is a small city, so taxi rides are extremely cheap; no trip within Bethlehem city should cost more than ₪20. To travel from Bethlehem to its neighboring suburbs of Beit Sahour or Beit Jala, it should be no more than ₪25-30. Just make sure, to only take service of the taxi ride and not a guided tour, which will cost you much more.\nTo travel to more distant sites (such as Herodium, any of the surrounding monasteries, or Solomon's Pools), it's advisable to negotiate a price with a taxi driver at the Bethlehem bus station. Many taxi drivers are willing to take you to a site, wait there while you tour a site and then take you back to Bethlehem for a negotiated price. Whenever negotiating a taxi price, always say the lowest price you think would be reasonable for the trip, and bargain with the driver from there. The driver will start as high as he thinks he can charge and bargain down for you. Make sure to agree on a price before going into a taxi.\n\n## See\n31.70430635.2076391 Church of the Nativity (From the last bus stop walk left through Pope Paul VI street until Manger Square. It's all straight, just make sure to take a left at the Lutheran church.). Undoubtedly the top attraction in Bethlehem, a veritable citadel built fortress-like on top of the cave where Jesus was born to Mary. It is one of the oldest churches in the world, and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The first incarnation of the building was erected on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I (the Great) in 330 CE. While the layout largely corresponds to Emperor Justinian's plans from 540 CE (the first building having been destroyed in a 536 riot), the church was first heavily fortified by the Crusaders and then degraded (mostly through neglect) under Mamluk rule. An earthquake in 1834 and a fire in 1869 didn't help. Today, the structure is mostly sound but somewhat dark and gloomy in appearance, only the adjoining Franciscan Church of St Catherine (dated 1881 and the site of the yearly December 24 midnight mass broadcast around the world) being in excellent shape. The alleged site of Jesus' birth is actually in a cave in the church (the original Manger where Jesus was born was a cave, not a shed, as popularly depicted). There is a star marking the exact location of Jesus' birth in the cave. The original Manger with the star marking Jesus' birth site is called the Grotto of the Nativity, and is accessible from inside the church. (The tomb of famed theologian and Bethlehem resident St. Jerome, who spent his life translating the Bible, is also in the cave with the Grotto.) Entrance to the entire complex is free, but in the high season (and especially on Jan 6th) be prepared for massive crowds and hour-long waits for entry into the Grotto. There are usually accredited but dodgy tour-guides waiting at the entrance or inside of the church who offer to give tours to groups/individuals, sometimes allowing you to skip the crowds. Makes sure to agree on a price before taking the tour, and if the promise was to skip the crowds and get into the crotto directly but not possible sometimes, lower the price by at least half. Otherwise do not support them, as it is unfair to the other visitors waiting.\n31.71866835.2018452 Rachel's Tomb (Separated from Bethlehem by the wall). Burial place of the matriarch Rachel, wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph and Benjamin is the second most important historical site in Bethlehem. (Genesis 35:19-20). It is a holy site in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As a result of the security situation, the Tomb's original structure has been surrounded by an Israeli fortress, barricading it off from Bethlehem. While the original tomb can still be seen in its entirety from within the fortress, access to the tomb is now only possible by vehicle, e.g. by taking the Egged bus that comes from Jerusalem or by hitchhiking the very short way.\n31.70741735.2291573 Shepherds' Fields. \"While shepherds watched their flocks by night...\" - rival locations in the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Sahour claim to be the site of the angel's visitation to the shepherds mentioned in the Gospels.    \n Orthodox Shepherds' Fields.

Three huge Herodian-era stone carved reservoirs capable of holding 160,000 m³ of water. They are located in a pine tree forest about 3 km from Bethlehem in a beautiful hiking area called the Artas Valley. In Artas, there is also the very beautiful Italian Order of the Sisters of Mary of the Garden built the Hortus Conclusus Convent and as well a Palestinian Folklore museum. Artas village also boasts an annual lettuce festival.\n31.7094435.2055567 King David's Wells (Biyar Daoud). King David's Wells in King David street, off Manger Square, are three Great Cisterns excavated in the rock in Ras Eftais, an eastern sector of Bethlehem, marking the site where David's army broke through a Philistine garrison to bring him water; \"Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem\" (2 Sam. 23:15). It is believed by some that under the adjacent Church of St. David is where the King is buried (as opposed to the traditional tomb in Jerusalem). The cisterns were discovered in 1895. The church rested on a vast Necropolis composed of 18 Arcosolia with two to six tombs each. The cemetery was Christian as proved by the inscription. The Catholic Action Club lies on the site of one of the cisterns.\n31.686535.18638 Convent and the Chapel of Hortus Conclusus (In nearby village of Artas). Monastery built in 1901. Hosts the Feast of Hortus Conclusus, which takes place on the third Sunday of August.

Right next to it, up the road, you can also find the 31.7151435.1873610 Virgin Mary Church.\nOld City. Is also good for a stroll and shopping if you haven't seen an Arab city before.\n31.703435.1612511 The Monastery of St. George (Al Khader Church) (In the Al Khader quarter, west of the centre. St. George makes for a convenient stop on the way (back) to Jerusalem. Take bus 231 (the one that came from Jerusalem originally) from Bethlehem centre, and get off at the last stop before the checkpoint towards Jerusalem, basically just before getting onto the highway after leaving Bethlehem/Beit Jala. From there it is less than 1 km west-wards to the Monastery/Church.). St. George was a very important Christian Saint for Orthodox Christians, also called \"Mar Jeriess\" in Arabic. The monastery is said to hold relics from the saint that possess healing powers-especially for mental illness. The monastery was used in the 19th century as a psychiatric facility to treat mental illness by using St George's relics. The site is also venerated in Muslim tradition as the setting for the Muslim prophet Al Khider's teachings. In mid-April or early May (it goes by the Julian calendar), the town (both Muslims and Christians) holds a festival for St. George that is worth seeing.\n31.70535.204212 St. Mary's Syriac Orthodox Church.

The Palestinian Authority doesn't charge a sales tax, so Bethlehem's shopkeepers charge much less for souvenirs. Bethlehem is a perfect place to practice those bargaining skills that you were hoping to try out!!\nIn peaceful times, Bethlehem's traders do a roaring trade in souvenirs for pilgrims to the town. In the current situation, the tour operators prefer to quickly hustle their guided groups in and out of the Nativity Church without allowing them time to look around Manger Square. Often, at the end of the tour, they will take their groups to a pre-selected souvenir shop and charge the owner of the shop a big commission for the sales made to the tour group. That means most smaller souvenir shops here are blessedly free from pilgrims, and also that the smaller shops are in desperate need of business. They remain, however, substantially less aggressive than Jerusalem's sellers. Souvenir shops in Bethlehem are much, much cheaper than in Jerusalem - with the same selection (surprisingly, many Bethlehem souvenir shops even have Jewish themed souvenirs). One must venture out of Manger square to the souvenir shops on Manger Street and also in the market place beside Manger Square past the Mosque of Omar. The smaller looking souvenir shops offer the best deals and very friendly service. Bethlehem is an awesome place to get all your Holy Land souvenirs for much, much cheaper than you would get them in Israel. If a price is listed in USD, it's a hiked price for tourists, so don't hesitate to bargain for a much lower price (you will almost always get a lower price if you ask for it).\nOn your way to the Milk Grotto Church, look for an Olive Wood factory located on the Milk Grotto Street.

Because tourists often stay in Jerusalem rather than Bethlehem, Bethlehem's hotels often offer much cheaper rates than their Israeli peers to encourage tourists to stay in the region rather than day-tripping. Bargaining for a cheaper hotel price usually works in Bethlehem.

          "content": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".\n\nEtymology\nJericho's name in Biblical Hebrew, Yəriḥo (יְרִיחוֹ) is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word rēḥ 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word Yaraḥ 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.\nJericho's Arabic name, Arīḥā, means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite rēḥ.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958.\nSubsequently, Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolò Marchetti excavated in 1997–2000. Since 2009, the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome (\"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH) under the direction of Nigro, Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.\n\nStone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring\nThe earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, tell means \"mound\"; consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.\n\nNatufian hunter-gatherers, c. 10,000 BCE\nEpipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000 BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\nJericho has evidence of settlement dating back to c. 10,000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic, c. 9500–6500 BCE\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic eras at Jericho are divided into PPNA and PPNB.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed PPNA. Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:\n\nsmall circular dwellings\nburial of the dead under the floor of buildings\nreliance on hunting of wild game\ncultivation of wild or domestic cereals\n\nAt Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\n\nThe Pre-Sultan (c. 8350 – 7370 BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft) settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over 8.5 metres (28 ft) high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered.\nThe wall and tower were built during the PPNA period around 8000 BCE. Carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that the tower was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall may have served as a defence against flood water (possibly to prevent the erosion of agricultural soil), with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, but no street planning. The identity and number of Jericho's inhabitants during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates as high as 2,000–3,000 and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses, and hunted wild animals.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nThe PPNB was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850 BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:\n\nExpanded range of domesticated plants\nPossible domestication of sheep\nApparent cult involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using plaster, and eyes set with shells in some cases\n\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of around five centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21.3 ft × 13.1 ft) and 7 m × 3 m (23.0 ft × 9.8 ft)) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\nChalcolithic\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nIn Early Bronze I, the stratigraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 village (EB IA, c. 3500 – 3200 BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 rural town (proto-urban, EB IB, c. 3200 – 3000 BCE).\nIn Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 foritifed town (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 with added towers and bastions to the fortification (EB IIB, c.2850 – 2700 BCE).\nIn the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450 BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600 BCE.\nDuring Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350 BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.\nIn Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300 – 2200 BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200 – 2000 BCE).\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nJericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system\" of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Carbon dating c. 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550.\nChronology (Nigro 2016)\n\nMiddle Bronze IA, Tell es-Sultan IVa1 (c. 2000/1950-1900 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IB, Tell es-Sultan IVa2 (c. 1900-1800 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIA, Tell es-Sultan IVb1 (c. 1800-1700 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIB, Tell es-Sultan IVb2 (c. 1700-1650 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIC/III, Tell es-Sultan IVc (c. 1650-1550 BC)\n\nLate Bronze Age\nDecades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the \"Middle Building\" which apparently served as the residence of the city's local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire. Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.\n\nHebrew Bible narrative\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\n\nPersian and Early Hellenistic periods\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.\nJericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (\"the Province of Judah\") under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it Kypros after his mother.\n\nHasmonean and Herodian periods\nAfter the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.\nThe rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100 BCE and 68 CE.\n\nHerodian period\nHerod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written ʾAlayiq). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.\nThe murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem's aristocracy.\nHerod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archelaïs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.\nFirst-century Jericho is described in Strabo's Geography as follows:\n\nJericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 stadia in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.\n\nIn the New Testament\nThe Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (Matthew 20:29), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (Luke 19:1–10). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke's Gospel, claimed that \"about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple\".\nSmith's Bible Names Dictionary suggests that \"Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.\"\n\nRoman province\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.\n\nByzantine period\nAccounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, Ericha, was built 1600 metres (1 mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.\nThe Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50 BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or \"peace unto Israel\", after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor.\nThe Na'aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in a similar condition.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nJericho, by then named \"Ariha\" in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palestine\"), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).\nBy 659, that district had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its \"miserable Canaanite\" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.\nA palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) and thus known as Hisham's Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This \"desert castle\" or qasr was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen in situ today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.\nUmayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile \"City of the Palms\". Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that \"the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor\". Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 km (6 mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin and the town slowly went into decline.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, \"it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the Ghaur land is made here.\" In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes that there are sulfur mines in Jericho, \"the only ones in Palestine\".\n\nOttoman period\n16th century\nJericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Akçe was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.\nIn 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of Riha, being in the nahiya of Al-Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Akçe. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.\n\n17th century\nThe French traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described the city in 1659 as \"now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.\"\n\n19th century\nIn the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuruş in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858–1943) also reported after his 1899–1900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called Ein al-Sultan, lit. \"Sultan's Spring\", in Arabic and Ein Elisha, lit. \"Elisha Spring\", in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.\nJ. S. Buckingham (1786–1855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or ghazzu: the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in \"robbery and plunder\", their main and most profitable activity.\nAn Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that Riha, Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.\nThe first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.\n\n20th century\nIn Jericho and the Jordan Valley, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem acquired estates that supported agricultural development and served as symbols of its renewed presence in the countryside. The Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.\nIn 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.\nIn the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).\nIn the 1945 statistics, Jericho's population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 \"other\") and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.\nDuring World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.\n\nJordanian period\nJericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed \"His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine\" and called for \"the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity\". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.\nIn 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nJericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza–Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a \"Protocol on Economic Relations\", signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho's Palestinian population's movement through the West Bank.\nThe Jericho synagogue was controlled by Israel after the Six-Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.\nIn response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.\nOn 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa'adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.\nAfter Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.\nIn 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1 million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017.\n\nGeography and environment\nJericho is located 258 m (846 ft) below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of Ein es-Sultan produces 3.8 m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some 10 square kilometres (2,500 acres) through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, 10 kilometres (6 mi) away.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 3,500 ha (8,600-acre) site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.\n\nClimate\nAnnual rainfall is 204 mm (8.0 in), mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in January and 31 °C (88 °F) in July. According to the Köppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (BWh). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.\n\nDemographics\nIn the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted  43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.\nIn a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.\n\nEconomy\nIn 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule. Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.\nThe Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.\n\nTourism\nIn 1998, a $150 million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.\nIn 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.\n\nBiblical and Christian landmarks\nChristian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.\n\nEin es-Sultan, known as the Spring of Elisha to Jews and Christians;\nQasr al-Yahud on the Jordan River, across from Bethany beyond the Jordan, traditionally identified as the location of the baptism of Jesus;\nMount of Temptation (Jebel Quruntul), traditionally identified as the location of the Temptation of Jesus;\nThe Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Temptation halfway up the mountain, beside a cave said to be the location where Jesus fasted for 40 days. It is connected to Jericho by a cable car;\n2 sycamore trees, both identified as the one mentioned in relation to Zacchaeus;\nDeir Hajla, the monastery of St. Gerasimos in the Jordan Valley near Jericho;\nSaint George Monastery in Wadi Qelt above Jericho.\n\nArchaeological landmarks\nStone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at Tell es-Sultan;\nHasmonean and Herodian winter palaces at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq;\nByzantine-period synagogues at Jericho (Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue) and Na'aran;\nUmayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as Hisham's Palace;\nCrusader sugar production facility at Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\");\nNabi Musa, the Mamluk and Ottoman shrine claimed to be the resting place of Moses (\"Prophet Musa\" to the Muslims)\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nIn 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.\n\nHealth care\nIn April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5 million in funding for this project.\n\nSports\nThe sports team Hilal Areeha plays association football in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000-spectator Jericho International Stadium.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nJericho is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nMusa Alami\n\nSee also\nAncient underground quarry, Jordan Valley, some 5 km (3 mi) north of Jericho\nal-Auja, Jericho, a Palestinian village north of Jericho\nBattle of Jericho, biblical story\nCities in the Book of Joshua\nHasmonean royal winter palaces, actually Hasmonean and Herodian, at Tulul Abu al-'Alayiq south of Jericho proper\nHistory of pottery in Palestine\nJawa, Jordan, the oldest proto-urban settlement from Jordan (late 4th millennium BC – Early Bronze Age)\nMevo'ot Yericho, Israeli settlement just north of Jericho\nTower of Jericho, the Neolithic stone tower, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\nWall of Jericho, the Neolithic stone wall, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Jericho\nJericho City (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nJericho City Profile, ARIJ\nJericho aerial photo, ARIJ\nLocality Development Priorities and Needs in Jericho City, ARIJ\nJericho Municipality Official Website Archived 6 February 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 18: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nJericho Municipality Official Website Historical site\nJericho Cable Car\nResources on Biblical Archaeology\nJericho: Tel es-Sultan Archived 13 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nThe walls of Jericho fell in 1550 BCE",
          "summary": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".",

          "content": "## Overview\nJericho (Arabic أريحا Arīḥā, Hebrew יריחו Yerikho), the \"City of Palms\", is a small city within the Palestinian Territories close to the northern end of Dead Sea and some 55 km (34 miles) from Jerusalem.\n\n## Understand\nA relatively tranquil town, Jericho's reputation for calm and lack of security incidents in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has made it a natural destination for West Bank visitors. Because Jericho is a tourist-orientated town, the Palestinian Authority goes to great lengths to make sure Jericho remains safe to visit. There is a constant tourist-police presence in the city and English is spoken by many in the town.\nThe modern town of Jericho includes the ancient mound known as Tell es-Sultan, the accumulated remains of cities that have existed on the site for some 9,000 years – the Neolithic period. Archaeology reveals that Jericho is one of the oldest human settlements in the Middle East.\nJericho, of course, is probably best known for its Biblical associations: (song) \"Joshua fought the battle of Jericho – and the walls came tumbling down!\"\nDue to its location nearly 400 meters below sea level, Jericho is extremely hot in the summer!\n\n## Get in\nFrom Jerusalem, start at the HaNeviim station outside the Old City, next to Damascus Gate. From there, one must take a bus/van to one of three Palestinian cities, and take a second bus/van to Jericho. The three cities are (in order of directness):\n(Al) Ezariya (Junction)  – Bus 36 or 63 (₪6.80) reach this town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the bus driver where to get off for the sherut van (₪10-12 depending on the mood of the driver) to Jericho or take the GPS pointer as orientation. It's advisable that you have an Arabic translator with you or specifically inquire of the bus driver as to where the sherut may be found. Alternatively, take bus 263 (₪6.80) from the Sultan Suleiman station, also close to the Damascus gate, which will stop at the junction too.\nBethlehem – The sherut from the bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station takes around an hour to get to the central square of Jericho (₪20).\nRamallah and Nablus – Authentic and well worth a visit Palestinian cities\nYou can also hitchhike from the south along the Dead Sea or from Tiberias in the north. However, the Egged bus coming from there will apparently not stop before Jerusalem to let passengers off – ask when entering.\nFrom the King Hussein \"Allenby\" Bridge border crossing, there is a direct bus which will deliver you to the 31.86063935.4782221 bus station east of the center, where you will pass through Palestinian border control. From there, it is a 2 km taxi ride or (underwhelming) walk to the city center.\n\n## Get around\nTaxi service in Jericho is easy to find. Make sure to agree on a price with the taxi driver before entering the taxi. Prices for taxi rides inside Jericho shouldn't be more than ₪10. For taxi rides to sites on the outskirts of Jericho, it's best to negotiate a fair price.\n\n## See\n31.8693735.443821 Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho). This site is the center of archaeological digs in Jericho. It was the location of the ancient Jericho of the Biblical times and is located some 2 km north-west of the modern city centre, overlooking the natural spring of Ein Sultan. If you prefer to focus on other things, then it is relatively easy to see the gist of the site from the surrounding roads. The site's car park features not one but two separate fountains both claiming to be Elisha's spring. A  UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2023. ₪10 (intl. students ₪7).\n31.8762335.453932 Shalom al Yisrael Synagogue Mosaic Floor (in between Tel es-Sultan and Hisham's Palace, there is a synagogue floor from the 6th century CE. Look for the bent, orange sign that says Synagogue or בית כנסת, look straight across the street and there is a road going diagonally towards some Palestinian flags). As of Jan 2020, the site is closed and visit is not possible. The synagogue floor is in the basement of a private house belonging to a Jerusalemite family, the Shahwans, at the end of the street. The family discovered the site and kept maintaining it until the Israelis confiscated the land and the house in 1987.\n31.88188335.4599693 Hisham's Palace (2 km north of modern Jericho). 08:00-17:00. This winter palace was built by the Umayyad Caliph Hisham Ibn Abdul Malek, before being destroyed by an earthquake soon after completion in 747 CE. The extensive site contains royal buildings, a mosque, water fountains and spectacular mosaic floors. The mosaics are closed for restoration works until mid-late 2020. ₪10, students ₪7.\n31.8588535.4574884 Russian museum and Sycamore Tree (Tree of Zacchaeus). Based on archaeological excavations of Byzantine buildings, artifacts of Roman/Byzantine/Islamic periods, ancient mosaics, and there is the Zacchaeus tree in the beautiful park. This tree is referenced in the New Testament due to its association with Jesus' visit to Jericho: \"Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.\" (Luke 19:1-4, NET Bible). ₪5, just for the garden & tree (the museum is ₪20), group (10 persons) ₪100.\n31.87443735.4305325 Quruntal (Mountain of Temptation). A Greek Orthodox monastery atop the mountain where Jesus is believed to have been tempted by the Devil. It houses two Greek Orthodox priests. One arrived from Greece in November 2010 when he was 30, and will stay there for the rest of his life. The other has been there for decades. From this precarious rocky spot, you get a great view of Jericho and the Jordan Valley towards Amman. Hike up to the top of the mountain, or else take the world's longest cable car below sea level from the base of the mountain (see Do below).\n31.83709335.5464976 Jesus' Baptismal site (Qasr al Yahoud). Located near Jericho on the Jordan River is the site where Jesus is said to have been baptised by John the Baptist in the Jordan River (this site in Jericho is rivalled by another in Northern Israel at Yardenit). It is also believed to be the spot described in the Old Testament where the Israelites crossed the river to enter the Land of Canaan.\n31.8535335.437057 Wadi Qelt Synagogue. This synagogue is thought to be the oldest synagogue in the world. It is part of the \"Jericho Royal Winter Palace\" complex that was constructed in the Second Temple Period.\n31.8518835.436238 Herod's Palace (ruins) (Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq) (take the road west from the roundabout next to the mosque at the entrance to the center). Not very impressive, but interesting if you are in to the topic. Conveniently located on the way in or out Wadi Qelt.\n31.89352835.424749 Naaran Synagogue (6-7 km northwest of the center). This beautiful ancient synagogue also contains a floor decorated with mosaics.\n31.82042635.50092910 Monastery of Gerasimus of the Jordan (Deir Hajla) (Southeast of Jericho, along road #90), ☏ +970 2 9943038, +970 50 348892. Daily 08:00-18:00. The Greek Orthodox monastery of Deir Hajla near Jericho commemorates St. Gerasimus, whose lavra was nearby. Gerasimus left his family wealth and worldly affairs to become a monk. He departed for the region Thebaid in the Egyptian desert, later again returning to his native Lycia. About the middle of 5th century Saint Gerasimus went to Palestine and settled in wilderness near the Jordan River. There he established a monastery and became known for his righteous life of asceticism and prayer. The story of Gerasimus and the lion, when the saint tamed the animal by removing a thorn from its paw and taught it obedience, became widely known in the Christian world. He is reputed to have attended to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.The history of the monastery is also linked to another Christian narrative. Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus were said to have found refuge in a cave here during their flight from Herod. An underground chapel was built on the spot where the Holy Family is believed to have spent the night. The crypt floor also contains the bones of monks who were massacred during the Persian conquest of the Holy Land.\n31.84319435.41472211 Monastery of Saint George of Choziba (دير القديس جورج). A cliff-hanging monastery complex, dating back to 420 AD. It houses the relics of Saint George of Choziba (circa 450–530 AD) and features an ancient chapel and irrigated gardens.   (updated Aug 2023)\n31.85611135.45722212 The Good Shepherd Church. Catholic church.  (updated Sep 2023)\n\n## Do\nParticipate with visiting archaeologists in the many archaeological digs taking place in the Jericho area.\nAlso, Jericho is known to the local population as an area surrounded by beautiful surroundings. There are numerous hiking trails that have beautiful views of the oases surrounding Jericho. Make sure to bring lots of water, Jericho is also known to the locals for its hot weather.\nGo for a camel ride in the desert. Ask the Bedouins walking around with decorated camels. So much fun! Make sure to agree on a price before hand.\n31.86930335.4446091 Cable Car (Right next to Tell es-Sultan).

          "content": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.\n\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nFlavia Neapolis ('new city of the emperor Flavius') was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called Mabartha ('the passage') or Mamorpha. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city's founding include Joseph's Tomb and Jacob's Well. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.\nInsofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.\n\nIn 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.\nSi'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres (360 ha) in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.\n\nConflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.\nAs tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.\nThus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nNeapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city's name was retained in its Arabicized form, Nabulus. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.\nUnder Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed \"Little Damascus.\" At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.\n\nCrusader period\nThe city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nCrusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a \"celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.\" He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.\n\nIn October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.\nThe successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.\nThe Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon, and later converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque in 1244. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.\nThe Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city \"full of trees and streams and full of olives.\" He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.\n\nOttoman era\nNablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaks ('districts'): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaks were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ('subdistricts'), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.\nAfter decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.\nThe most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama's rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of mutasallim ('tax collector, strongman') of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.\n\nEgyptian rule and Ottoman revival\nIn 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma'in nahiya—rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.\nEgyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaks under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no \"foreigners\" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct \"supervision\" of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.\n\nWorld War I and British Mandate\nBetween 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.\nThe 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous \"picturesque\" character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 partition plan for Palestine.\n\nJordanian occupation\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian occupation. Thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps are still located within the city limits today: Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian occupation, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950.\n\nIsraeli period\nThe Six-Day War ended with the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.\nBassam Shakaa was elected mayor in 1976, and four years later he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground on 2 June 1980, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. The Israeli administration removed him from office in the spring of 1982, and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.\nIn response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city on 29 July 1985 that was lifted 2 hours a day. Najah University was closed for two months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.\nThe Israeli administration ended in January 1986 with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce, al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans, he was assassinated on 2 March 1986, widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nSalah el Bah'sh was shot with a rubber bullet by an Israeli soldier on 18 June 1989 whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B'Tselem that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting \"Ta'amod\" (Halt!). Bah'sh died and the army indicated that an investigation was being carried out.\n\nPalestinian control\nJurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nablus is neighbored by Israeli settlements, and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.\nThe city was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said in 2008 that the city remains \"capital of terror\" of the West Bank.\nFrom the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (mountain of fire) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more Palestinian suicide attacks than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of \"knowhow\" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.\nThe operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.\nThe Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes in August 2016 between a militant group and Palestinian police. Two Palestinian Police officers were killed by terrorists in the city on 18 August. Shortly after, the police raid on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militants were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.\n\nGeography\nNablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at 940 meters (3,080 ft), while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is 881 meters (2,890 ft) high.\nNablus is located 42 kilometers (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv, Israel, 110 kilometers (68 mi) west of Amman, Jordan and 63 kilometers (39 mi) north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.\n\nOld City\nIn the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.\nThere are six hamaams (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.\n\nClimate\nThe relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being 29.6 °C (85.3 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 6.2 °C (43.2 °F). Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately 656 mm (25.8 in).\n\nDemographics\nIn 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 'the chief part of whom are Mohammedans', with some Jews and Christians and 'about 150 Samaritans'. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).\nThe 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 \"other\").\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents. Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate's inhabitants.\nApproximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).\n\nReligion\nIn 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.  However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.\nThe majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.\nIn 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.\nThere are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.\n\nEconomy\nBeginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of \nthe caravan (amir al-hajj), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.\n\nIn 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside  the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the  slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and mulukhiyya were grown in the fields and grain mills were  scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kg (496,040 lb) of the product by 1837.\nToday, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries\n such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.\n Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.\nThe Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus\nproduced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda  imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel.  In 2003, there were eight restaurants  and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The  soap industry has suffered  from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. \n\nThe Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.\nBefore 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.\nSince the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.\nNablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.\nNablus has been ranked as the 5th best city in the Middle East to learn Arabic. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.\n\nHealthcare\nThere are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National), and the Rafidia Surgical Hospital, which is located in the western neighborhood of Rafidiya, and is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. The Nablus Speciality Hospital was built in 2001, which is specializes in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasty.\n\nCulture and arts\nNablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. Nabulsi, meaning \"from Nablus\", is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.\n\nTraditional costume\nNablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk (\"market\"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob (\"robe\"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh (\"square chest piece\").\n\nCuisine\nNablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of \"high cuisine\", such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nKanafeh (or Kunafa) is the best known Nabulsi sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, kanafeh Nabulsi uses a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.\nOther sweets made in Nablus include baklawa, \"Tamriya\", mabrumeh and ghuraybeh, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an \"S\"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.\n\nCultural centers\nThere are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, dabke classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.\n\nSoap production\nNabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.\nMade in a cube-like shape about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of \"the page of an old book.\" The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap's sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw. Today, qilw is still used in combination with lime.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Nablus is the muhfaza (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.\nThe two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.\nYaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.\n\nMayors\nModern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.\nThe current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa \"Dweikat\", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.\n\nMunicipal services\nIn 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.\nThe majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.\n\nFire department\nNablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the \"fire brigade\" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.\n\nTransportation\nIn the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.\nThe main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.\nThe nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.\n\nSports\nThe Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city's football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nNablus is twinned, or has sister city relationships with:\n\nSee also\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority\nList of people from Nablus\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWelcome To The City of Nablus\nNablus City, Welcome to Palestine\nA site explaining the reasons for the devastated Palestinian economy\nNablus the Culture, reviving cultural life in Nablus Archived 15 April 2022 at the Wayback Machine\nNablus after Five Years of Conflict December 2005 report by OCHA (PDF).\nArchaeological Remains Found in Nablus\nPicture showing Nablus from east (Panorama)\nPicture showing east region of Nablus (Panorama) – The picture taken from Askar\nBahjat Sabri, \"Urban Aspects in the City of Nablus in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\" An-Najah University Journal for Research - Humanities, Volume 6 (1992)",
          "summary": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.",

          "content": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nإذا كانت فلسطين قلب الوطن العربي لربطها شماله بجنوبه وشرقه بغربه، فإن نابلس هي قلب فلسطين لربطها شمالها بجنوبها وشرقها بغربها. كانت المدينة مركزاً للواء نابلس في الضفة الغربية بعد عام 1948م وتحولت في منتصف الستينات مركزاً لمحافظة نابلس، تتمتع بموقع جغرافي هام فهي تتوسط إقليم المرتفعات الجبلية الفلسطينية وجبال نابلس، وتعد حلقة في سلسلة المدن الجبلية من الشمال إلى الجنوب وتقع على مفترق الطرق الرئيسية التي تمتد من الناصرة وجنين شمالاً حتى الخليل جنوباً ومن يافا غرباً حتى جسر دامية شرقًا. تبعد عن القدس 69 كم وعن عمان 114 كم وعن البحر المتوسط 42 كم، تربطها بمدنها وقراها شبكة جيدة من الطرق تصلها بطولكرم وقلقيلية ويافا غرباً وبعمان شرقاً وبجنين والناصرة شمالاً وبالقدس جنوباً. في عام 1915 ربطت نابلس مع خط سكة حديد الحجاز الممتد من دمشق إلى المدينة المنورة.\nأقيمت نابلس في أجمل بقعة جغرافية في وسط فلسطين. وصفها شيخ الربوة الدمشقي بأنها «قصر في بستان». قال عنها عمر السكندري في كتابه «تاريخ سوريا» المطبوع في بيروت عام 1882:\n\nيرتفع وسط مدينة نابلس 550 مترا فوق سطح البحر بينما يبلغ ارتفاع أطرافها حتى 800 متر ف.س.ب. تقدر مساحة المدينة العمرانية بحوالي 12700 دونم. يمتد عمران المدينة فوق جبل عيبال شمالاً وجبل جرزيم جنوباً وبينهما وادٍ يمتد نحو الغرب. ولخصوصية الموقع الجغرافي لمدينة نابلس المتمثلة بانحصارها بين جبلين تتواجد في المدينة العشرات من عيون المياه التي تزيد من جمال وبهاء المدينة ومنها عين العسل، عين الست، عين الكاس، عين حسين، عين القريون، عين ميرة، عين الخضر، عين الصلاحي، عين السكر، عين الصبيان، عين الساطور، عين العجيبة، عين بدران، عين التوباني، عين بير الدولاب، عين التوتة بالإضافة إلى سبل المياه مثل سبيل الغزاوي وسبيل الخضر وسبيل السلقية وسبيل الساطور.\n\nتضم مدينة نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية، كبرى الجامعات الفلسطينية وأقدمها وأرفعها مستوى. أسست بلدية المدينة عام 1869 وهي تشرف على تنظيم المدينة وعلى المرافق العامة.\nتذكر كتب التاريخ وصف بعض الرحالة العرب لنابلس بدمشق الصغرى للتشابه مع دمشق بمعالمها ومناخها ومياهها وينابيعها وجبالها وفاكهتها وخضارها وحتى في لهجتها وكثير من عاداتها وتقاليدها. وهي أكثر مدن فلسطين شبهاً وارتباطاً بدمشق وسورية منذ فجر التاريخ، حيث كان تجارها يصدرون الصابون والمنتجات المحلية الأخرى إلى دمشق ويعودون بالأقمشة والتوابل. إضافة إلى ذلك، يعود أصل العديد من عائلات نابلس إلى مناطق في سورية حالياً، مثل عائلة النمر التي قدمت من منطقة حمص وحماة وعائلة طوقان التي قدمت من منطقة حماة.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في نابلس مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت). يتساقط المطر بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش).\n\nقرى وبلدات نابلس\nيحيط بنابلس عدد كبير من القرى ولكنها معزولة عنها بالحواجز العسكرية الإسرائيلية، ففي الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية تم خنق المدينة بعدة حواجز عسكرية مثل حاجز حوارة من المدخل الجنوبي، وحاجز بيت إيبا من المدخل الغربي، وحاجز (17) من المدخل الشمالي وحاجز الباذان من المدخل الشرقي، وبعد انتهاء الانتفاضة الثانية أزيلت هذه الحواجز، ثم أُنشئت حواجز جديدة بعد عملية طوفان الأقصى عام 2023 مثل حاجزي حوارة وعورتا على طريق رام الله نابلس جنوباً، وحاجز المربعة قرب قرية تل من الجهة الجنوبية الغربية، وحاجز صرة على طريق قلقيلية نابلس غرباً، وحاجز الطور جنوباً، وحاجز دير شرف من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق طولكرم نابلس، وحاجز مستوطنة شافي شمرون من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق جنين نابلس، إضافة إلى بعض الحواجز العسكرية المتنقلة غير الدائمة مثل حاجزي الباذان وبيت فوريك شرقاً، وحاجز (17) شمالاً.\nمن قراها:

سكان المدينة في عام 1596 يتألفون من 806 أسر مسلمة و18 أسرة مسيحية و15 أسرة يهودية و20 أسرة سامرية، والأخيرة طائفة دينية يسمى أفرادها بالسمرة أو السامريين. عاش السامريون قبل حرب 1967 في نابلس كمواطنين أردنيين يتمتعون بكافة حريات المواطنة كحال مسلمي ومسيحيي المدينة.\n\nخلال أوائل القرن التاسع عشر، قدر قسطنطين بازيلي سكان ناحية نابلس بستة وعشرين ألف عائلة منها ما يقارب 1000 عائلةٍ مسيحية. وتفيد السجلات العثمانية أن عدد سكان نابلس بلغ 2000 نسمة عام 1849، وفي عام 1867 قال زوّار أمريكيون، أن البلدة بلغ عدد سكانها 4,000 نسمة «أكثرهم محمديون»، وبعض اليهود والمسيحيين، وحوالي 150 سامريّا. قدر عمر السكندري عام 1882 عدد سكانها بثمانية آلاف معظمهم مسلمون. وفي عام 1922 أظهر الإحصاء الرسمي البريطاني لسكان فلسطين، أن عدد سكان المدينة بلغ 15,947 نسمة، ثم ارتفع إلى 17,498 عند إحصاء عام 1931، و21900 نسمة عام 1941 ووصل عام 1945 إلى حوالي 23300 نسمة. وبعد الاحتلال الصهيوني عام 1967 بلغ قرابة 61,050 نسمة، وعاد ليرتفع إلى 106,900 عام 1987.\nبلغ عدد سكان نابلس 134,116 نسمة، في منتصف عام 2006، وفقًا للجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. وفي إحصاء الجهاز لعام 1997، ظهر أن عدد سكان المدينة وصل إلى 100,034 نسمة، بما فيهم 23,397 لاجئ يشكلون 24% من سكان المدينة. وصل عدد سكان مدينة نابلس القديمة إلى 12,000 نسمة عام 2006. تشكل المدينة المسكن لحوالي 40% من سكان المحافظة. توجد في المدينة أربعة مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين هي عين بيت الماء وبلاطة وعسكر القديم وعسكر الجديد، يسكنها ما يفوق مجموعه ال40,000 نسمة.\nيشكل الشباب قسمًا كبيرًا من سكان نابلس، فقرابة نصف السكان يبلغون أعمارًا أقل من 20 سنة. بلغت نسبة السكان الذين تقل أعمارهم عن 10 سنوات، عام 1997، 28.4%، و20.8% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 10 و19 سنة، 17.7% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 20 و29 عام، 18% بين 30 و44 سنة، 11.1% بين 45 و64 سنة، و3.7% للذين تصل أعمارهم لأكثر من 65 عام. أما التوزيع بين الجنسين فكانت نسبته 50.92% (50,945 فردا) للذكور، و49.07% (49,089 فردا للإناث).\n\nالديانة\nكانت نابلس في عام 891 الميلادي، أي خلال العهود الأولى للحكم العربي، تحوي تنوعا دينيا كبيرا، وكان أكثرية سكانها يدينون بالإسلام، المسيحية، والسامرية. يقول الجغرافي شمس الدين الأنصاري الدمشقي، أن المدينة كانت خلال العهد المملوكي، مأهولة بالمسلمين، السامريين، المسيحيين الأرثوذكس، المسيحيين الكاثوليك، واليهود. أظهر إحصاء عام 1931 أن المدينة حوت 16,483 مسلمًا، 533 مسيحيًّا، 6 يهود، و167 شخص يدينون بأديان أخرى، على الأرجح أن معظمهم سامريّون.\nإن معظم سكان نابلس اليوم يدينون بالإسلام، ولا يزال هناك أيضًا بعض المسيحيين والسامريين. يُعتقد أن كثيرًا من الفلسطينيين المسلمين في المدينة يتحدرون من سامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام عند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام، والبعض من أسماء العائلات المسلمة اليوم يتم ربطها بالسامريين ويُقال أن أجدادهم كانوا من أتباع ذلك الدين - مثل آل مسلماني وآل يعيش وغيرهم. يقول المؤرخ فياض الطيف، أن أعدادًا كبيرة من السامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام بسبب الاضطهاد الذي كانوا يتعرضون له، وبسبب الطبيعة التوحيدية للدين الجديد، الأمر الذي جعلهم يتقبلونه بصورة أسهل وأسرع.\nكان يسكن في المدينة حوالي 3,500 مسيحي عام 1967، ولكن أعدادهم انخفضت إلى 650 عام 2008. يتألف المسيحيين في نابلس حاليّا، من 70 أسرة روم أرثوذكس، حوالي 30 أسرة من الروم الملكيين الكاثوليك، و30 أسرة أنجليكانية. كان معظم المسيحيين يسكنون في ضاحية رفيديا بالقسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nتاريخ نابلس\nالتاريخ القديم\nنابلس أو شكيم بالكنعانية، مدينة من أقدم مدن العالم يعود تاريخها إلى 5600 سنة (حوالي سنة 3600 ق.م). أسست عند ملتقى أقدام جبلي جرزيم في القسم الشرقي لمدينة نابلس الحالية على يد العرب الكنعانيين فوق تل كبير يدعى الآن تل بلاطة، وقد أسماها الكنعانيون في ذلك الوقت \"شكيم\" والتي تعني المكان المرتفع، ومن ثم أصبحت من أشهر المدن الكنعانية. أقدم من سكن \"شكيم\" من العرب هم الحويون و‌الفرزيون. صارعت نابلس الكثير من الغزاة والمحتلين عبر تاريخها الطويل، بحيث غزاها كل من الفراعنة المصريين والقبائل العبرية والآشوريين والابليين والفارسيين واليونانيين والسلوقيين، إلى أن سقطت بيد الرومان سنة 63 قبل الميلاد.\nورد ذكر شكيم في نصوص إيبلا التي اكتشفها عالم الآثار الإيطالي باولو ماتييه ضمن مدن كنعانية أخرى في فلسطين، وهي إضافة إلى شكيم بيت جبرين وأريحا وأورسالم (يبوس) ومجيدو وبيسان. ورد ذكرها أيضاً في رسائل تل العمارنة (1400 ق.م) باسم شاكمي، كما ذكرت في تقارير تحتمس الثالث أيضاً.\n\nتشير النصوص المصرية القديمة بأن شكيم كانت مدينةً محصنةً إستراتيجية ذات أهمية دولية منذ سنة 1800 ق.م، كما كانت مركزاً للديانات الكنعانية والحياة السياسية، ويُفهم من النصوص المصرية القديمة أن علاقة فلسطين أصبحت وطيدة بمصر ابتداءً من بداية هذا العصر. وتتحدث رسائل تل العمارنة (سنة 1400-1350 ق.م) عن مدينة شكيم، تحت حكم أميرها الكنعاني لابعايو كمدينة تلعب دوراً هاماً في النضال ضد السيطرة المصرية على منطقة فلسطين. وحسب ما ورد في التوراة فإنها أول مدينة كنعانية نزل فيها النبي إبراهيم الخليل قادماً من مدينة أور في العراق، وكان ذلك حوالي عام 1805 ق.م  وبعده أتى النبي يعقوب من فدان آرام على نهر الفرات في العراق، ونزل شكيم، ثم سكن مدينة كنعانية تعرف باسم بيت إيل وتعني مقر الإله، وكانت مركز عبادة الإله الكنعاني إل أو إيل. ويذكر أن يعقوب عاد فيما بعد إلى شكيم.\nوفي العصر الحديدي (1200-323 قبل الميلاد) استمرت المدن الكنعانية بنفس نظام المدن المحصنة ذات القلاع خلال فترات العصر البرونزي. وتشير التوراة إلى وجود حروب بين اليهود والكنعانيين الفلسطينيين. وقد سيطر اليهود على مدينتين كنعانيتين:\n\nالأولى: مدينة يبوس (أورشاليم)، مدينة اليبوسيين الكنعانيين وقلب مملكتهم منذ عصور ما قبل التاريخ، احتلها اليهود سنة 1000 ق.م بقيادة النبي داود (100-963 ق.م)، ثم سليمان سنة 963 ق.م –923 ق.م. واستمر اليهود فيها تحت اسم مملكة يهودا حتى سقطت سنة 586 ق.م على يد نبوخذ نصر.\nالثانية: مدينة شكيم، التي بدأ نفوذهم فيها عام 923 ق.م وانتهى عام 722 ق.م على يد سرجون الثاني، وبقى فيها أهلها الكنعانيون، وتشير بعض المراجع إلى إحضار كنعانيين من الدواخل، وهم العموريون.\n\nسكنت مدينة شكيم فئة من بني إسرائيل لا تعترف من التوراة بغير الأسفار الخمسة الأولى المنسوبة إلى النبي موسى، وتعرف هذه الفئة بالسامريين نسبة إلى السامرة. وقد ناصبهم اليهود العداء منذ ظهورهم. ويعتقد السامريون بأن النبي إبراهيم همّ بالتضحية بإبنه إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. لا يزال معظم السامريين موجودين في مدينة نابلس حتى هذا اليوم ولا يتجاوز عددهم 250 نسمة، وقد خصص لهم مقعد في المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني المنتخب لأول مرة في التاريخ الفلسطيني المعاصر عام 1996.\nسقطت فلسطين سنة 332 ق.م في يد الإسكندر المقدوني وأصبحت تابعة للإمبراطورية اليونانية حتى سنة 64 ق.م، وبعد وفاة الإسكندر خضعت للبطالمة والسـلوقيين. وقد تركت الهيلينية بصماتها واضحة على بعض مظاهر الحياة أيام الحكم اليوناني وذلك بسبب إنشاء سبعين مدينة ضخمة على الطراز الإغريقي في البلاد التي احتلها الجيش اليوناني. وقد اُستخدِمت مراكزَ ثقافية نُشِرت بها الثقافة اليونانية في بلدان العالم القديم. ومن المدن الثقافية التي أنشئت في العهد اليوناني بيلاوريون (تل الأشعري)، هيبوس (قلعة الحصن)، وهما تقعان شرق طبريا، ومدينة (فيلوتير) في الطرف الجنوبي من بحيرة طبريا، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى فيلوتير شقيقة بطليموس الثاني فيلادلفوس، ومدينة جيراز (جرش). حول الإغريق الكثير من أسماء المدن الكنعانية الفلسطينية إلى أسماء إغريقية منها عكا، حيث سميت بتولما في عهد بطليموس الثاني، وبيت شان (بيسان) سميت سكيثوبوليس، وبيت جبرين أطلق عليها اليوثيروبوليس، وإيلات سميت بيرينكة، وشكيم سميت نيابوليس. أصبحت المدينة تشتمل على رقعة واسعة من الأراضي تحيط بها الأسوار، وبها بوابات ضخمة ذات جلال، وفي داخل الأسوار يقع القصر الملكي أو قصر الحاكم، وكذلك الساحة العامة والمدرج الضخم والمسرح وبرك السباحة والمعابد الضخمة المتعددة.\nوفي العصر الروماني (64 ق.م – 323 م) أقيم سور حول مدينة شكيم (السامرة) طوله حوالي 170 أكد. أما بوابة المدينة فقد بنيت في الجهة الغربية من المدينة وتضم برجين دائريين عظيمين بقطر 46 قدماً (14 متراً)، وهي مقامة على قواعد مربعة الشكل تعود للعصر الهيليني. ومبنى الباسيليكا في السامرة يعود تاريخه إلى العصر الروماني.\n\nوفي الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 67 و69 للميلاد، قرر الرومان، تحت قيادة الإمبراطور فسبازيان، هدمها للمرة الأخيرة وبناء مدينة جديدة إلى الغرب منها أسموها «نيابوليس» أي المدينة الجديدة والتي حرفت عنها لفظة نابلس الحالية، وقد أقاموها وفق التخطيط الروماني في بناء المدن من حيث وجود شارعين متقاطعين ينتج عنهما أربع حارات، حيث ما زالت بعض هذه الحارات الرومانية قائمة بتسميتها الرومانية إلى اليوم مثل حارة القيسارية. وفي عهد هادريان (117-138) أقام الرومان معبداً لجوبيتر على جبل جرزيم مكان معبد السامريين.\nوفي العصر البيزنطي (323 - 638) انتصرت المسيحية فأصبحت كل فلسطين وبضمنها نابلس تدين بالمسيحية وأصبحت نابلس مركزاً لأسقفية. وفي القرن الخامس الميلادي بنى الرومان المسيحيون على قمة جبل جرزيم كنيسة تخليداً لمريم العذراء. وفي عهد الإمبراطور جستنيان (527-565) شيدت بالقرب من كنيسة مريم قلعة مسورة لا تزال آثارها باقية، كما أعاد الرومان بناء خمس كنائس تهدمت في حروب سابقة.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nفي عام 638م فتح العرب المسلمون نابلس بقيادة عمرو بن العاص في خلافة عمر بن الخطاب، وقد تعهد المسلمون بحماية من بقي من أهلها على دينه من المسيحيين على أن يدفعوا الجزية عن رقابهم والخراج عن أراضيهم. أصبحت نابلس بعد الفتح الإسلامي مدينة من مدن جند فلسطين الذي كانت قصبته اللد ثم الرملة.\nاستولى عليها الصليبيون في سنة 1099م بقيادة تانكرد صاحب أنطاكية، وبنى بالدوين الأول (1100-1118م) ملك بيت المقدس الفرنجي فيها قلعة على رأس جبل جرزيم لحماية قواته ومراقبة تحركات المسلمين. وعقد فيها خلال الاحتلال الصليبي مجمع كنسي كبير في سنة 1120م تحت رعاية بالدوين الثاني (1118-1130م). غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى (باللاتينية: Naples).\nعادت نابلس بقراها وجبالها إلى المسلمين سنة 1187م بعد انتصار صلاح الدين الأيوبي في معركة حطين. أزال صلاح الدين ما أحدثه الصليبيون من تغييرات فيها أثناء الاحتلال. بدأت المدينة في العودة إلى ازدهارها خاصة في زمن المماليك الذين خلفوا الأيوبيين.\nضرب نابلس زلزال كبير سنة 1189 م، فتهدمت فيها مبان كثيرة، ومات تحت الأنقاض ثلاثون ألفاً من أهلها.\nكانت نابلس مركز تجمع جيش المسلمين بقيادة الملك الكامل خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة على الشام التي انطلقت في عام 1228م بقيادة فردريك الثاني إمبراطور ألمانيا وإيطاليا.\nسقطت نابلس بيد التتار سنة 1260م، ولكنهم خرجوا في نفس السنة على يد قطز المملوكي.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nفي سنة 1517 م سيطر العثمانيون على بلاد الشام وبضمنها نابلس، وأصبحت نابلس سنجقاً تابعاً لولاية دمشق، ووصلت المدينة أوج ازدهارها في عهدهم.\n\nكانت نابلس خلال القرنين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر أهم مدينة تجارية في فلسطين، متفوقة على القدس وعلى المدن الساحلية، ومن المحتمل أنها كانت الأكبر سكانيا في فلسطين في هذا الوقت. حوالي عام 1849، وصل عدد سكانها إلى عشرين ألفًا على الأقل، ما جعلها الأكبر سكانيًا في فلسطين. كانت أيضاً أكبر مركز لإنتاج القطن في الشام بكمية بلغت 225,000 كغم عام 1837. كانت المدينة مركزا لتجارة الأقمشة وكانت تصدر الصابون وزيت الزيتون والقطن إلى دمشق وبيروت ومصر وأوروبا.</\"ref name=\"BD> نتيجة لدورها التجاري المهم، تعرضت نابلس بدءاً من عام 1773 إلى حصار عسكري واقتصادي تبعه احتلال قام به ظاهر العمر وخلفه أحمد باشا الجزار لإضعاف دورها وتقوية دور عكا، ودام هذا الاحتلال حتى عام 1804. بعد دمار عكا الذي نتج عن هجوم إبراهيم باشا عام 1931-1932، عادة أهمية للازدياد مجددا. في سنة 1832 دخلت نابلس تحت الحكم المصري بقيادة القائد إبراهيم باشا، وفي عام 1834 ثار أهل نابلس على الحكم المصري بسبب الضرائب والتجنيد الإجباري ولكنهم أخفقوا. دام هذا الحكم حتى سنة 1840 حيث عادت فلسطين إلى الحكم العثماني. وفي نهاية الحكم العثماني أصبحت مدينة نابلس مركز سنجق تابع لولاية بيروت يمتد من نهر الأردن إلى البحر المتوسط ويضم مئة قرية. ضرب زلزال كبير ثان نابلس في عام 1837 وأدى إلى تدمير حي كامل وإحداث أضرار كبيرة بحي آخر.\nمع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، بدأ دور نابلس بالتراجع مع زيادة أهمية مدن أخرى مثل القدس التي اجتذبت مهاجرين يهود وحجاج مسيحيين، ويافا التي بدأت بالازدهار نتيجة زيادة تجارتها عبر الميناء.</\"ref name=\"BD> استمر التراجع في القرنين اللاحقين بفعل الاحتلال الأجنبي وانتقال مراكز الإدارة والتجارة إلى مدن أخرى. سقطت نابلس بيد البريطانيين في يوم 21 أيلول 1918 بعد معركة شهدت مقاومة شديدة من الجنود العثمانيين. أخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني عام 1922 وأصبحت نابلس مجدداً مركزاً للمقاومة. فجر البريطانيون أجزاءً كبيرةً من حارة القريون خلال ثورة 1936-1939 لقمع المقاومة.\n\nضرب زلزال قوي نابلس يوم 11 تموز من عام 1927  وأدى إلى تدمير 300 بيت ومبنى في مدينتها القديمة وبضمنها جامع النصر التاريخي  ويمكن رؤية آثاره على كثير من المباني حتى اليوم. أظهر تعداد عام 1941 أن نابلس جاءت في المرتبة السادسة في تعداد السكان في فلسطين بعد القدس وتل أبيب وحيفا ويافا وغزة على الترتيب، وكانت تضم محكمتين عدليتين على الأقل.\n\nبعد نكبة فلسطين\nبعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948 ضمت الضفة الغربية بمحافظاتها الثلاث، نابلس والقدس والخليل، إلى الأردن وأصبحت في سنة 1950 جزءاً من المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى احتلالها من قبل الإسرائيليين خلال حرب حزيران عام 1967م. منذ سقوطها حتى اليوم، شكلت نابلس إحدى أهم بؤر المقاومة وسقط منها شهداء كثر من أقدمهم وأبرزهم شادية أبو غزالة عام 1968 والفتاة لينا النابلسي عام 1976. بعد إتفاق أوسلو، انسحبت قوات الاحتلال منها في 10 كانون الأول سنة 1995م، قبل أربعة أيام من الموعد المتفق عليه مع السلطة الفلسطينية، وكانت الوحيدة من بين المدن الفلسطينية التي أخليت قبل موعدها.\n\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية، استمر دور المدينة بالتراجع بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي والعمليات العسكرية في مقابل الهدوء النسبي في مناطق أخرى (أهمها رام الله) وتركيز السلطة الفلسطينية على بناء عاصمتها الجديدة في رام الله، فانتقلت كثير من المؤسسات وإدارات المصارف والشركات والمراكز الثقافية ومراكز البحوث إلى رام الله. نتيجة لذلك، ارتفعت نسبة البطالة في نابلس وتراجعت تجارتها. كانت الإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الأردنية العاملة في الضفة الغربية أول من انتقلت من المدينة. بعد ذلك، بدأت المؤسسات الثقافية ودور الأبحاث بالانتقال للاقتراب من مراكز صنع القرار في رام الله. على سبيل المثال، انتقل المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث السياسية والمسحية (وهو من أوائل مراكز البحوث واستطلاع الرأي في فلسطين) من نابلس إلى رام الله (وكان اسمه عند التأسيس مركز البحوث والدراسات الفلسطينية). أيضا، قبل إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله، كانت هناك ثلاثة مراكز ثقافية فرنسية (تتبع للقنصلية الفرنسية في القدس) في الأراضي الفلسطينية (في القدس وغزة ونابلس)، وبعد إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله أقيم فرع رابع هناك تبعه إغلاق فرع المركز في نابلس.\n\nنابلس في أدب الرحلات\nذكر رحالة كثر نابلس في أعمالهم. من هؤلاء المقدسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي الذي وصفها في كتابه «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم» حيث قال: \n\nفي سنة 1325م زارها ابن بطوطة فوصفها بأنها مدينة عظيمة كثيرة الأشجار والماء ومن أكثر بلاد الشام زيتوناً، وبها مسجد جامع متقن وحسن في وسطه بركة ماء عذب.\nفي القرن التاسع الهجري، أفاض مجير الدين الحنبلي العليمي في ذكر نابلس ونواحيها فقال فيما قال: \n\nفي سنة 1671م زارها الرحالة العثماني أولياجلبي، حيث ذكر أنها مركز لواء تابع لولاية دمشق ويضم مائتي قرية. وذكر مساجدها وسوقها ومدارسها وحماماتها قائلاً: \n\n وأغلب الظن أنه قصد وجود الليمون والنخيل في غور نابلس وليس في جبالها.\n\nالاقتصاد والخدمات\nنابلس عاصمة فلسطين الاقتصادية، وتعتبر المركز التجاري والصناعي الرئيس في فلسطين قبل النكبة  وفي الضفة الغربية بعد ذلك. إضافةً إلى ذلك، وهبها موقعها الجغرافي المميز وأمطارها الغزيرة (التي تعتبر الأغزر في فلسطين) أهمية كمركز لإنتاج وتبادل المنتجات الزراعية. كما تشتهر المدينة بصناعة الصابون والمصنوعات اليدوية والأثاث والبلاط وتشتهر بجودة حجارتها ومهارة حجّاريها ومصانع النسيج ودباغة الجلود. كما توجد على تخوم نابلس سوق لتبادل البضائع الحيّة كالمواشي وسوق الخضار المركزية للضفة الغربية. تضم نابلس الإدارات العامة لكبريات الشركات الفلسطينية مثل شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية وشركة فلسطين للتنمية والاستثمار (PADICO)، وفيها مقر بورصة نابلس المعروفة رسمياً بسوق فلسطين للأوراق المالية. كانت نابلس مركزاً للإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية الموجودة في الضفة الغربية قبل أن يتم نقل معظمها إلى رام الله مع تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية هناك. تشتهر نابلس كذلك بعمارة أسواقها، وخاصة في حي القصبة في المدينة القديمة، كما تشتهر بحلوياتها وخاصة «الكنافة» التي تنسب أجودها للمدينة.\n\nالصناعة\nكانت المدينة تشكل ثقلاً اقتصادياً هاماً قبل 1967م وكانت مدن الضفتين تعتمد عليها في بعض الصناعات وبعد الاحتلال ونتيجة لسياسة سلطات الاحتلال الإلحقاية التي تقوم على تدمير الاقتصاد الوطني تعرضت الصناعات الكبيرة فيها إلى التراجع وهبوط مستوى إنتاجها وأهم هذه الصناعات مصانع الجلود والنسيج والكيمياويات والصناعات المعدنية، وفي المدينة غرفة تجارة أسست عام 1943م.\nتشتهر المدينة بالكثير من المنتجات الزراعية والمصنعة أهمها:\n\nالصابون النابلسي: ازدهرت صناعة الصابون في نابلس واشتهر صابونها الذي يصنع من زيت الزيتون حتى أصبحت مصابنها جزءاً من تراث المدينة. كانت صناعة الصابون أحد أعمدة الاقتصاد النابلسي ووصل عدد المصابن إلى أكثر من ثلاثين مصبنة، توقف معظمها عن العمل بفعل إغلاق الأسواق الخارجية وغياب الابتكار والتجديد.\nالحلويات النابلسية: أهم حلوياتها على الإطلاق الكنافة النابلسية الشهيرة في كل أنحاء المشرق العربي وتركيا. دخلت نابلس موسوعة غينيس للأرقام القياسية بأكبر طبق (صدر) كنافة في 18 تموز 2009. تشتهر نابلس أيضاً بالمدلوقة والحلاوة المصنوعة من السمسم والكلاج والقطايف والفطير وحلاوة الزلابية إضافة إلى الحلويات الشامية مثل البقلاوة.\nمن المُنتجات الأخرى التي تمتاز بها نابلس عن غيرها الجبن النابلسي والطحينة والحلاوة والقزحة، والأخيرة عبارة عن مائع أسود اللون يستخلص من حبة البركة، يؤكل غمساً وله استعمالات طبية مهمة.\n\nالزراعة في محافظة نابلس\nتساهم الزراعة بنسبة قليلة من الدخل، ويتركز الإنتاج الزراعي على سفوح الجبال وفي الأغوار وتعتمد على مياه الأمطار والري في الأغوار. فيها العديد من المزارع لتنمية الثروة الحيوانية.\nتعد نابلس مركز زراعة الزيتون في فلسطين، ولهذا ازدهرت فيها صناعة الصابون النابلسي المطبوخ من زيت الزيتون. إضافة إلى الزيتون، تحيط بنابلس بساتين الرمان واللوز والخوخ والمشمش والدراق. تزرع الخضراوات والحمضيات المروية في الغور حيث تقل أخطار الصقيع. كانت منطقة نابلس تشتهر أيضاً بزراعة القطن، إلا أن هذا المحصول اختفى تقريباً الآن من منطقة نابلس، ولكنه لا زال يزرع في السهل الساحلي.\nتشتهر المدينة أيضاً بمنتجات زراعية خاصة مثل الزعتر النابلسي وتعرف بمنتجاتها الجبلية مثل البابونج والميرمية. صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات واسعة من أراضي المحافظة وأقامت عليها 43 مستوطنة مما أدى إلى انحسار مساحة المراعي الطبيعية.\n\nالخدمات الصحية\nفيها مشفيان حكوميان أولهما المستشفى الوطني الذي يٌقدم خدمات في تخصص علم الأورام. بني هذا المستشفى عام 1910 ويقع في وسط المدينة. ثاني المستشفيات الحكومية مستشفى رفيديا الجراحي الذي يقع في غرب المدينة ويُعد أكبر مستشفى في المدينة. يوجد أيضاً مشفيان خاصان غير ربحيين هما المستشفى الإنجيلي العربي وهو الأقدم في المدينة حيث أنشيء عام 1900 ومستشفى جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي.. من المشافي الخاصة الربحية المستشفى العربي التخصصي ومستشفى نابلس التخصصي الذي أسس عام 2001، ويقدم خدمات اختصاصية في جراحة القلب المفتوح وقثطرة شريانية ورأب الوعاء. بعد إنشاء كلية الطب في جامعة النجاح أنشيء مستشفى النجاح الوطني الجامعي وهو أول مستشفى جامعي في فلسطين.\nإضافة إلى ما تقدم، هناك مستوصفات خيرية تقدم خدمات الطوارئ والإسعافات الأولية مثل مستوصف الرحمة ومستوصف التضامن التابع لجمعية التضامن الخيرية ومركز الرازي الطبي ومركز الأمل للتأهيل. هناك أيضاً العديد من العيادات الطبية الحكومية أو التابعة لوكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين أو الأونروا، وخاصة في مخيمات اللاجئين. في عام 2010، بلغ معدل السكان لكل مركز رعاية صحية 5,486 مواطن وهو الرقم الأصغر مُقارنة مع باقي المدن الفلسطينية. ويتمتع المواطن النابلسي بخاصية التأمين الصحي الذي يتم تأمينه من جهة الحكومة (نظام التأمين الصحي الحكومي) والتأمين الصحي الخاص والمنظمات الغير حكومية والأونروا أيضًا ويصل عدد العائلات التي تستفيد من هذا التأمين 19,051 عائلة.\n\nالخدمات البلدية\nفي عام 1997، تم ربط 18,003 منزل بالشبكة العامة للكهرباء أي ما يعادل 99,7% من المدينة. قبل بناء هذه الشبكة عام 1957 كان التزود بالكهرباء يتم عن طريق بعض المولدات الخاصة. بالإضافة أن الشبكة تمد 18 بلدة وقرية بجوار المدينة بالكهرباء عن طريق نفس الشبكة.\nوترتبط 93% من منازل المدينة بنظام الصرف الصحي و7% عن طريق الحُفر الامتصاصية. وأُنشئ نظام الصرف الصحي في أوائل الخمسينات، بالإضافة إلى ارتباط مخيم بلاطة ومخيم عسكر ومخيم عين بيت الماء. وتوفر بلدية نابلس المياه الصحية عن طريق الأنابيب لجميع المنازل في المدينة. وقد قامت السلطات البريطانية بتأسيس شبكة المياه عام 1932، وتتزود بالمياه من الآبار الأربعة المجاورة للمدينة في: دير شرف، الفارعة، وادي الباذان و‌أودلا.\n\nإطفائية البلدية\nتم تأسيس إطفائية بلدية نابلس عام 1958. حيث تألفت أول فرقة إطفاء من خمسة أفراد مع سيارة إطفاء واحدة، حتى عام 1986 كانت مسؤولة عن منطقة شمال الضفة الغربية كاملةً. ولكن اليوم تقتصر خدماتها فقط في نابلس. في عام 2007، بلغ عدد السيارات المُستعملة لإطفاء الحرائق 20 سيارة و70 فرد. خلال الفترة الواقعة ما بين 1997 و2006، قامت بإطفاء 15,346 حريق.\n\nالطرق والمواصلات\nينقسم نظام الطرق والمواصلات في نابلس كما هو الحال في باقي مناطق الضفة الغربية إلى قسمين رئيسيين، واحد لاستخدام المواطنين الفلسطينيين والآخر لاستخدام المستوطنين الإسرائيليين. تصل مساحة الطرق الرئيسية التي تربط مدينة نابلس بالقرى المُحيطة بها إلى 365.8 كم 2، بينما تصل مساحة الطرق الفرعية التي تربطها بالقرى إلى 313.2 كم 2. ومنذ توقيع اتفاقية أوسلو بين السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية والجانب الإسرائيلي في أيلول سبتمبر عام 1995 عملت إسرائيل على إنشاء نظام طرق خاص يربط مستوطنات الضفة الغربية ببعضها البعض، ويضمن مرورا آمنا لمستوطني الضفة الغربية. وقد أدى نظام الطرق هذا إلى تقسيم الأراضي الزراعية في الضفة الغربية وبعثرتها. وقد وصل طول هذه الطرق إلى 39,699 كم مربع حتى نهاية شهر مارس من العام 1996.\nتعد المركبات في نابلس أهم وسائل النقل، بل تكاد تكون الوحيدة التي يعتمد عليها سكان نابلس للتنقل برًا من وإلى المناطق المختلفة داخل الوطن والمدن المجاورة. حيث تبلغ عدد السيارات 20.397 منها 15.507 سيارة خاصة و1.490 سيارة أجرة و121 حافلة عمومية. ويعتبر متوسط سنة إنتاج السيارة منخفضًا في المدينة حيث يبلغ عدد السيارات التي تم تصنيعها (قبل عام 1997) 9.540 سيارة أي ما يقارب نصفها.\n\nالحياة الثقافية والتراث\nتعتبر نابلس من أغنى المدن الفلسطينية ثقافياً وتراثياً. من الألقاب التي عرفت بها نابلس «عش العلماء» ويعود سبب التسمية إلى كون نابلس مركزاً علمياً وأدبياً ونظراً لظهور الكثير من العلماء والأدباء والشعراء منها على مدى كثير من العصور.\n\nشعراؤها وأدباؤها\nبرز منها الكثير من أعلام الفكر والشعر والأدب. من أشهر شعرائها إبراهيم طوقان شاعر فلسطين وشقيقته فدوى طوقان وحلمي الزواتي وعبد اللطيف عقل وليلى علوش وعلي الخليلي ومحمد مهيب جبر ومن أدبائها في القرن العشرين عادل زعيتر وقدري طوقان ومحمد عزة دروزة وثريا ملحس وأكرم زعيتر.\n\nمؤسسات التعليم العالي والمراكز الثقافية\nتحتضن نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية الأكبر في الضفة الغربية والتي تضم عشرين كلية. توجد في المدينة أيضاً كلية الروضة للعلوم المهنية إضافةً إلى مراكز ثقافية مثل المنتدى التنويري الثقافي الفلسطيني والنادي الثقافي الاجتماعي ومركز حواء الثقافي وملتقى بلاطة الثقافي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي وفرع للمجلس الثقافي البريطاني. كان في المدينة ثلاث دور سينما أغلقت خلال الانتفاضات المتعاقبة منذ 1989، وقد افتتحت عام 2009 دار جديدة للسينما، أغلقت أبوابها عام 2019. وتعد مكتبة بلدية نابلس العامة أقدم وأكبر المكتبات في الضفة الغربية حيث أنشئت عام 1960.\nوفقًا ل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني، في عام 1997، بلغ عدد الطلاب 44,926 (41.2٪ في المدارس الابتدائية، 36.2٪ في المدرسة الثانوية، و22.6٪ في المدرسة الثانوية). في عام 2006، بلغ عدد المدارس 234 مدرسة و93,925 طالبًا وطالبة في محافظة نابلس؛ منها 196 تابعة لمديرية التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية و24 مدرسة خاصة و14 مدرسة تابعة ل الأونروا.\n\nالحركة النسوية\nفي عام 1921، تأسست في نابلس جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي التي كانت أول جمعية نسائية غير دينية في فلسطين (سبقتها ثلاث جمعيات أرثوذكسية في عكا ويافا والقدس)، وهي لا تزال نشطة حتى الآن وأسست الكثير من المراكز والنشاطات منها مشفى ومعهد تمريض ومراكز تعليم مهني وناد ثقافي وروضة أطفال.\n\nالمتاحف\nأنشئ في نابلس متحف القصبة في موقع غني بالآثار الرومانية داخل المدينة القديمة. هناك أيضاً متحف سامري أقيم على قمة جبل جرزيم عام 1997 لإلقاء الضوء على ديانة وتراث السامريين.\n\nالإنتاج التلفزيوني ومحطات البث التلفزيوني\nتم في نابلس عام 2005 إنتاج مسلسل تلفزيوني يعالج الكثير من القضايا الاجتماعية وكان اسم المسلسل «براويز» من إنتاج تلفزيون آسيا ـ نابلس، كذلك أنتج مسلسل تلفزيوني اجتماعي آخر عام 2008 حمل عنوان «لهون حلو». فيها سبع محطات تلفزة محلية أهمها وأولها تلفزيون نابلس وخمس محطات إذاعة محلية تبث على موجات إف إم، وهي تؤثر بشكل فاعل بطرح قضايا تخص المدينة وسكانها، من أبرز هذه الإذاعات راديو شباب أف ام، راديو طريق المحبة، إذاعة جامعة النجاح الوطنية وإذاعة القرآن الكريم.\n\nالزي الشعبي\nيشبه الزي النسائي القديم المعروف لمدينة نابلس إلى حد كبير الزي النسائي لمدينة دمشق، والذي يتكون من يشمك وغطوة وكاب أو ملاية. والحال كذلك بالنسبة للزي الرجالي الذي كان يتكون من الشروال والطربوش.\n\nالفن التشكيلي\nأقيمت في مدينة نابلس أضخم جدارية في فلسطين بمساحة 550 متر مربع عند مفترق جامع السلام غرب المدينة. كما أقيم في مدينة نابلس حديثا غالري فني يهتم بالفن التشكيلي بكافة أنواعه وهو غالري تهامة.\n\nالرياضة\nتوجد في المدينة العديد من الأندية الرياضية أهمها نادي حطين ونادي اتحاد نابلس ونادي عيبال وشباب نابلس، إضافة إلى أندية صغيرة مثل نادي أهلي بلاطة ونادي التضامن ونادي جبل النار ونادي إسكان الموظفين. إضافةً إلى ذلك، يوجد مركز للشباب في كل مخيم للاجئين (كبلاطة وعسكر وعين بيت الماء). فيها ملعب بلدي لكرة القدم هو الأقدم في فلسطين حيث أسس عام 1950. جرت توسعته وإعادة تأهيله ليتسع ل4,000 من المتفرجين.\n\nالحديقة النباتية\nأقيمت أول حديقة نباتية تعليمية وبحثية في فلسطين في قرية تل الواقعة في ضواحي نابلس. أشرف على هذا المشروع ونفذه مركز أبحاث التنوع الحيوي والبيئة «بيرك» ويقع مقره في ذات القرية. تحتوي الحديقة على أشجار الحور، عروس الغابة، الخروب، البطم، الجكرندا، الطلح الناعم، السنديان، العبهر، الصنوبر، الكينا، التين، الزيزفون السوري، الورود، بالإضافة إلى حديقة مائية وحديقة صخرية.\n\nأهميتها الدينية\nأخرج ابن أبي شيبة عن كعب الأحبار قال: \n\n هي من أهم المدن قداسة وخاصة عند اليهود والنصارى. يقال أن النبي آدم سجد فيها على جبل جرزيم. هي الموقع الكنعاني الأول الذي ذكرته التوراة وفيه بنى إبراهيم أول هيكل لدى قدومه من حلب. إضافة إلى إبراهيم، سكنها أنبياء أهمهم إسحاق ويعقوب. ويعتقد اليهود أن إبراهيم همّ بذبح إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. مر بها المسيح حيث سقته المرأة السامرية من بئر يعقوب. يوجد فيها أيضاً قبر يوسف وبظاهرها قبور أنبياء آخرين.\nهناك 17 معلما إسلاميّا في المدينة، و11 مسجدًا في المدينة القديمة. تمّ إنشاء 9 مساجد من هذه المذكورة قبل القرن الخامس عشر. تحوي نابلس، بالإضافة لدور العبادة الإسلامية، كنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس مكرسة للقديس جوستين الشهيد، المبنية عام 1898، وكنيسًا للسامريين، لا يزال يُستعمل من قبل تابعي هذه الديانة.\n\nالمساجد\nنابلس مدينة المساجد، فمنذ أن دخلها الإسلام وهي جادة في بناء المساجد التي بنى معظمها الموسرون من أهلها حيث تفيد إحصائية من عام 1997م بأن عدد المساجد في مدينة نابلس وحدها دون قراها بلغ 49 مسجدًا  منها ما هو قديم جداً مثل جامع الخضراء، الذي يمتد عمره إلى بداية العهد الإسلامي،جامع التينة، جامع البيك، الجامع الصلاحي الكبير الذي كان كاتدرائية، جامع الساطون، جامع النصر، المسجد العمري، جامع المساكين، المسجد الحنبلي، جامع الأنبياء، جامع الخضر، مسجد العامود. وهناك عدد كبير من المساجد الحديثة.\nتوجد في نابلس لجنة زكاة تعتبر الأكبر في الضفة الغربية حيث تقوم على إعالة آلاف الأسر والأيتام وطلاب العلم في نابلس وقراها وتشرف على عدة مشاريع استثمارية ضخمة متعددة الأغراض.\n\nالكنائس والأديرة\nتمتاز نابلس بتسامحها الديني، وهذا يفسر كثرة الكنائس وتنوعها وكذلك الأديرة المسيحية فيها. ومن أشهر الكنائس وأقدمها في نابلس كنيسة الأرثوذكس في المدينة القديمة، والكنيسة الأرثوذكسية المُقامة فوق بئر يعقوب. ومن أشهر أديرتها دير فنشر قرب جامع الخضر، ودير اللاتين قرب المقبرة الغربية. وهناك موقع شرقي المدينة يسمى خلة الرهبان.\n\nآثار ومعالم\nلا تزال مجموعة من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية الجميلة الممثلة لمختلف الفترات التاريخية السابقة التي مرت على نابلس قائمة حتى اليوم داخل المدينة، فبالإضافة إلى مدينة شكيم، لا يزال هناك ثلاثة عشر أثراً رومانياً من أبرزها المسرح والمدرج وميدان سباق الخيل، كما أن هناك خمسة وستين أثراً لمعالم التراث الحضاري الإسلامي موزعة على المساجد، المقامات، الزوايا، الخانات، القصور، الأسبلة، المدارس وغير ذلك. ومما يؤسف له أن هذه الآثار قد تعرضت للتدمير والهدم والتخريب الوحشي على يد الإسرائيليين أثناء هجومهم على البلدة القديمة في نابلس عام 2002.\n\nبوابات نابلس\nيروي مؤرخو المدينة أن نابلس كان لها ثماني عشرة بوابة، زال معظمها جراء التوسع العمراني الذي شهدته ابتداءً من القرن التاسع عشر. ومنها: البوابة الشرقية، البوابة الغربية، بوابة الدير، بوابة الشيخ مسلم، بوابة إدريس، بوابة سوق الحدادين، بوابة البيك وسط المدينة القديمة، بوابة الوكالة.\n\nالمعالم من العهدين الكنعاني والروماني\nتظهر الآثار الرومانية على أطراف المدينة القديمة، وبعض المعالم في البلدة القديمة ترجع إلى العهد البيزنطي والصليبي. من الآثار الكنعانية والرومانية المهمة في نابلس:\n\nسبسطية: مدينة أثرية فيها مدارج رومانية وشارع أعمدة. تقع على بعد كيلومترات قليلة شمال غرب نابلس.\nشكيم: مدينة كنعانية قديمة. بعض جدرانها لا تزال قائمةً إلى اليوم في الطرف الشرقي من مدينة نابلس.\nمعبد جوبيتر أو زيوس: ويقع في تل الرأس في جبل جرزيم (الطور). أُسس كمعبد للآلهة زيوس في القرن الثاني للميلاد وقد تم اكتشافه عام 1930.\nمدرج سباق الخيل في ساحة الشهداء (ميدان الحسين سابقاً) وسط مدينة نابلس.\nالمدرج الروماني في رأس العين: ويتسع لأكثر من ألف شخص، وهو أكبر المسارح المكتشفة في فلسطين.\nالشارع الروماني: اكتشفت أجزاء منه تحت مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية.\nمقبرة عسكر البيزنطية.\nالمقبرة الرومانية الغربية: وتقع على أطراف المدينة على الطريق المتجه غربًا نحو الساحل الفلسطيني.\nبئر يعقوب: وهو البئر الذي شرب منه يسوع على يد المرأة السامرية بحسب التقاليد المسيحية، وأقيم فوقه دير أرثوذكسي، ولا يزال عامراً بالمياه الصالحة للشرب.\nقبر يوسف: هو مقام يعتقد أن القبر الموجود فيه يحتوي رفات النبي يوسف بن يعقوب التي حملت من مصر حسب التوراة،  ولذلك استولى عليه اليهود عام 1967 وجعلوه مقاماً مقدساً لديهم ونقطةً عسكرية قبل أن يطردهم سكان نابلس بالقوة عام 2000.\n\nقناة جر المياه الرومانية: أقام الرومان هذه القناة في القرن الثاني الميلادي واكتشفت حديثاً على عمق 30 متراً تحت الأرض تحت أقسام من المدينة القديمة عند بناء مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية. يُعتقد أن هذه القناة تجر مياه الشرب من ينابيع جبل جرزيم ضمن شبكة من الخزانات والآبار،  ولا تزال المياه تتدفق في هذه القناة. تم ترميم جزء منها وفتحه للزوار من قبل بلدية المدينة قبل عدة سنوات.\nأربع كنائس بيزنطية حولت إلى مساجد.\nآثار جبل جرزيم. يوجد على قمة الجبل معبد يوناني وكنيسة بيزنطية مثمنة الأضلاع وقلعة صليبية ومقام إسلامي إضافة إلى خزانات مياه وأساسات أبنية.\nتلة صوفر.\n\nقبور الأنبياء في عورتا. فيها قبر النبي العزير في مغارة وكذلك قبر يوشع بن نون خادم النبي موسى ومفضل ابن عم النبي هارون.\n\nالمعالم من العهد الإسلامي\nتتمثل أهم الآثار الإسلامية في أحياء المدينة القديمة في نابلس، وهي الياسمينة، القريون، الحبلة، القيسارية، العقبة، الغرب، القصبة الذي يمثل شريان المدينة القديمة ومركزها التجاري.\nتحتوي نابلس على 2850 بناءً تاريخيًا من منازل وقصور عائلية، و18 معلماً إسلامياً و17 سبيلاً. يعود تاريخ إنشاء العديد من الأماكن التاريخية المهمة إلى العهد الإسلامي وبالأخص العثماني مثل:\n\nبرج الساعة في باب الساحة\nخان التجار القديم\nخان التجار الجديد\nخان الوكالة الغربية\nالمدرسة الرشادية أو المدرسة الفاطمية\nقصر النمر\nالمنارة\nمستشفى الوطني الحكومي\nالمستشفى الإنجيلي (المبنيان القديمان)\nسجن النساء التركي\nالسجن (القشلة)\nسرايا الحكم التركي\nدار المفتي\nالوكالة الفروخية\nمحطة ضخ مياه القريون\nالبرج الصليبي\nجسر القطار قرب حدائق جمال عبد الناصر ومحطة القطار\nالمدرسة الهاشمية (هدمت)\nالمحكمة الشرعية.\nإضافة إلى ذلك، تضم المدينة العديد من الآثار والمعالم القديمة، منها تسعة مساجد أثرية، أربع منها كانت كنائس بيزنطية بالأصل وحولت إلى مساجد، وخمسة مساجد بنيت في بداية العهد الإسلامي، وضريح يعود إلى الفترة الأيوبية، وكنيسة من القرن السابع عشر وعشرات المصابن.\nيقع مقام رجال العامود على سفح جبل جرزيم الشمالي، ويعود تاريخه إلى عام 1396، ويتكون من سبع غرف متلاصقة يعتقد أنها كانت مسكن عامود النور وعائلته، ويوجد في الغرف الوسطى قبور يعتقد أن أصحاب المقام قد دفنوا فيها لاحقًا، وله فناء داخلي وسور، وفي جزئه الشمالي الغربي مسجد صغير تعلوه قبة حجرية.\n\nالحمامات التركية\nما زالت الحمامات التركية في نابلس شاهدةً على قدم هذه المدينة وعراقتها. كان عدد الحمامات التركية في نابلس أكبر من أية مدينة أخرى في فلسطين، حيث كانت تضم عشرة حمامات تركية  من أصل 38 في كل فلسطين. مع التطور العمراني ووصول المياه الجارية إلى البيوت، تضاءلت أهمية الحمامات العامة فهجر بعضها أو تضرر بسبب الإهمال بينما تحولت حمامات أخرى إلى مرافق مختلفة مثل حمام الخليلي، حمام الريشة، حمام الدرجة، حمام القاضي، حمام التميمي، وحمام النساء. تم خلال السنوات العشر الماضية تجديد بعض الحمامات التركية مثل حمام السمرة وحمام الشفاء. وإضافة إلى وظيفتها الأساسية، أصبحت هذه الحمامات تشكل ملتقيات للسكان من مختلف الأعمار حيث تشهد إقامة فعاليات ثقافية وتراثية.\n\nالتخريب الإسرائيلي للمعالم الأثرية في نابلس\nتعرضت المباني والمعالم التاريخية في نابلس لأضرار كبيرة من قبل الاحتلال الإسرائيلي، حيث دمر 149 معلماً من هذه المعالم بالكامل بينما تعرض 2000 معلم، أبرزها جامع الخضراء الذي يقدر عمره بـ 400 سنة، وخان الوكالة  لأضرار متنوعة أثناء عمليات الجيش الإسرائيلي في المدينة منذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية عام 2000 وخاصة أثناء عمليتها الكبرى في نابلس في نيسان 2002. وأصاب الضرر قصورًا أثرية ومساجد ومصابن وأسواق.\n\nدور نابلس في النضال القومي العربي والوطني الفلسطيني\nكانت نابلس على الدوام مركزاً للنضال الوطني والقومي حيث لعبت دوراً كبيراً في مقاومة الغزاة. وحسب قسطنطين بازيلي فإن «جبليي نابلس هم أكثر القبائل السورية ضراوة ونزوعاً للقتال.»  لعب مثقفو نابلس وأعيانها أدورا كبيرة في الكفاح القومي. على سبيل المثال، كان عدد الإجمال للأعضاء في المنظمات والأندية القومية التي شكلت حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى 126 عضوا (مثلوا سورية والعراق)، كان منهم ثلاثة عشر عضوا من نابلس ومنطقتها، وهو أعلى تمثيل من فلسطين متبوعا بالقدس التي مثلها تسعة أعضاء. كان معظم هؤلاء ناشطين في جمعية العربية الفتاة وعلى رأسهم عوني عبد الهادي ومحمد عزة دروزة. شارك مندوبون عن نابلس في المؤتمر السوري العام الذي عقد في دمشق عام 1920 وألقى محمد عزة دروزة مقررات المؤتمر التي أعلنت استقلال سورية بحدودها الطبيعية ونادت بفيصل بن الحسين ملكا عليها.\nمن أهم الأحداث التي شهدتها نابلس المؤتمر الفلسطيني الخامس من 20 إلى 24 آب 1922 والذي أعلن الفلسطينيون خلاله رفض الانتداب وإصدار طوابع عليها شعارات فلسطينية ومقاطعة اليهود في البيع والشراء. لمتابعة المؤتمر عقد في نابلس مؤتمر آخر بتاريخ 18 أيلول 1931 سمي بمؤتمر التسليح، حيث طالب بالاستقلال والوحدة العربية ودعا إلى مقاطعة حكومة الانتداب وتسليح عرب فلسطين إن لم تستجب لذلك.\n\nنابلس في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية\nتعتبر مدينة نابلس أكثر المدن الفلسطينية تعرضًا للحصار والضربات العسكرية من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية ابتداءً من العام 2000. أدى الحصار المستمر للمدينة وصعوبة تبادل البضائع إلى تدهور مكانة المدينة كمركز اقتصادي، وأدى إلى ارتفاع نسب البطالة كثيرًا، مما أدى إلى هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى الخارج أو إلى مدن أخرى خاصة رام الله. تصف إسرائيل المدينة بأنها «مصنع للإرهابيين»، وقامت قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي بعدة عمليات عسكرية واسعة النطاق في المدينة أو عمليات شملت عدة مناطق من ضمنها مدينة نابلس من أشهرها عملية الدرع الواقي عام 2002 وذلك نتيجة عدد الاستشهاديين الذين خرجوا منها. كانت نابلس الأكثر تضرراً من بين المحافظات الفلسطينية على صعيد الخسائر الاقتصادية حيث سجلت 2630 منشأة غير عاملة من بين العدد الكلي للمنشآت (17,167) أو ما نسبته 15% من المنشآت فيها وفق نتائج تعداد 2007،  وهذه أعلى نسبة سجلت في فلسطين.\n\nأعلام نابلس\nعلى الصعيد القومي\nخرج من نابلس شعراء وكتاب ورجال سياسة واقتصاد منهم من تبوأ مناصب رفيعة على مستوى فلسطين والأردن وسوريا والوطن العربي عمومًا. من أشهر هؤلاء في القرن العشرين:\n\nأحمد طوقان، رئيس وزراء سابق  للأردن.\nالشيخ عبد الحميد السائح، رئيس سابق للمجلس الوطني الفلسطيني، وأول من شغل منصب وزير الأوقاف والشؤون

          "summary": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.",

          "content": "Naplouse (en arabe : نابلس, Nablus ; en hébreu : שְׁכֶם, Chékhem ou Sichem) est une ville située en Palestine (Cisjordanie, en partie occupée par l'armée israélienne et par des colons juifs israéliens). Chef-lieu du gouvernorat de Naplouse, elle fait partie des territoires actuellement administrés par l'Autorité palestinienne.\nLa commune de Naplouse comptait une population d'environ 150 000 habitants en 2016.\nElle abrite des lieux saints de différentes religions, juifs, samaritains, musulmans et chrétiens.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nElle se trouve en Cisjordanie, à environ 65 kilomètres au nord de Jérusalem et environ 50 au nord de Ramallah, siège de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne.\n\nCommunes limitrophes\nNaplouse est globalement tributaire de la situation particulière de la Cisjordanie depuis les accords d'Oslo, divisée en trois zones d'autonomie plus ou moins forte : la zone A dont fait partie le territoire de Naplouse relève pour l'administration civile de l'Autorité palestinienne, établie à Ramallah, mais la route 60 toute proche et le mont Garizim font partie de la zone C, où l'autorité israélienne est totale.\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nLe centre de Naplouse est situé dans une vallée d'une altitude de 550 mètres, orientée nord-ouest/sud-est, entre le mont Ébal (940 m) au nord et le mont Garizim (881 m) au sud.\n\nVoies de communication\nÀ 3 km à l'ouest de Naplouse passe la route 60 qui relie Nazareth (Israël) au nord à Beer-Sheva (Israël) au sud en passant par Jénine (Cisjordanie), Jérusalem et Hébron (Cisjordanie). En Cisjordanie, la route 60 est sous la surveillance de l'armée israélienne, mais il y règne cependant une grande insécurité.\nDe cette route partent des routes vers Haïfa, Netanya et Tel Aviv-Jaffa, trois villes d'Israël situées sur le littoral.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nLa ville, fondée en 72 par les Romains, est nommée Flavia Neapolis (« Nouvelle cité flavienne »), en l'honneur de l'empereur Vespasien, de son nom romain Titus Flavius Vespasianus, qui règne de 70 à 79.\nCelui-ci la fait construire à la place d'un village samaritain appelé Mabartha, situé à environ deux kilomètres à l'ouest de la ville de Sichem (שְׁכֶם), première capitale de l'ancien royaume d'Israël, dont le nom est utilisé pour désigner Naplouse en hébreu. Elle est initialement peuplée d'anciens légionnaires romains (vétérans) qui reçoivent des parcelles de terre à cultiver.\nL'empereur Hadrien (vers 130) y fait construire un grand théâtre pouvant accueillir sept mille spectateurs. Les archéologues ont trouvé des pièces de monnaie de cette époque avec des emblèmes militaires et les visages des dieux et déesses grecs Zeus, Artémis, Sérapis ou Asclépios. Neapolis est entièrement païenne à l'époque. Le chrétien Justin de Naplouse naît dans la cité au IIe siècle et étudie le platonisme. La cité est prospère et tire encore des bénéfices de la lutte entre Septime Sévère et Pescennius Niger en 198-199. Cependant, elle prend parti pour ce dernier, et Septime Sévère en conséquence lui ôte ses privilèges commerciaux en faveur de Sébaste.\n\nPhilippe l'Arabe transforme Flavia Neapolis en Julia Neapolis en 244 et y fait venir de nouveaux colons romains. Elle garde le statut de colonie jusqu'en 251 sous Trébonien Galle. La ville à cette époque devient majoritairement chrétienne, avec une minorité samaritaine. L'évêque de Neapolis participe au concile de Nicée en 325.Des révoltes de Samaritains interviennent au Ve siècle, notamment en 451, à cause de relèvements de taxes. La ville, comme toute la Palestine, fait partie de la Syrie sous administration de l'Empire romain d'Orient, ou Empire byzantin et elle est agitée par les querelles du monophysisme - les monophysites refusant le retour du patriarche Juvénal au siège de Jérusalem. Les tensions augmentent en 485, lorsque des Samaritains assassinent des fidèles chrétiens qui se trouvaient dans la cathédrale de la ville, sous prétexte de rumeurs indiquant que les dépouilles des fils et petits-fils d'Aaron seraient transférées ailleurs par les chrétiens. L'évêque Térébinthe, qui a été blessé dans l'affaire, se rend à Constantinople pour demander un renforcement de la garnison. L'empereur Zénon fait bâtir une église dédiée à la Théotokos (Vierge Marie) au mont Garizim - lieu saint des Samaritains - et empêche ces derniers de se rendre sur leur colline sacrée. Ils se rebellent sous le règne de son successeur, l'empereur Anastase Ier, et plus tard la révolte est matée par Procope, gouverneur romain (c'est-à-dire byzantin) d'Édesse. Une dernière révolte intervient en 529, qui débute par l'assassinat de l'évêque Ammonas, tandis que les prêtres de la cité sont écartelés, puis brûlés avec les reliques des saints. Justinien Ier envoie ses troupes qui saccagent la cité ; les Samaritains qui ne s'enfuient pas sont en grande partie massacrés.\nNeapolis connaît ensuite une grande période de prospérité qui dure un siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nPériode des califats musulmans\nAprès la conquête de la cité par les musulmans, Arabes venus de Médine et La Mecque, en 636, quatre ans seulement après la mort du prophète Mahomet, la cité est renommée Nablus, arabisation de son ancien nom. La cité continue d'être une ville commerciale d'importance, et change de population sous la pression démographique de nouveaux immigrés musulmans venus de Perse et d'Arabie, et de l'arrivée de commerçants juifs. Les chrétiens et les Samaritains demeurent toutefois une fraction importante de la population.\nLe géographe arabe Al-Maqdisi la décrit au Xe siècle, comme un « petit Damas ». Naplouse est réputée pour ses ateliers de tissage, en particulier du lin, ses oliveraies et sa grande place du marché. La ville est entourée de moulins. On y construit la première mosquée fort imposante, tandis que la population s'islamise peu à peu, les chrétiens et les Samaritains étant soumis à des impôts plus importants. De plus, l'usage de l'arabe supplante définitivement l'usage du grec vers le Xe siècle.\n\nPériode du royaume croisé de Jérusalem\nLes Croisés arrivent ici en 1099 avec Tancrède et la renomment « Naples » (le nom de la « Naples » italienne vient aussi d'une ancienne « Neapolis », tout comme « Nabeul » en Tunisie). La cité devient la ville majeure en la seigneurie de Naplouse, un fief du royaume de Jérusalem. Elle est épargnée des combats, et des croisés s'y installent même. Le concile de Naplouse s'y réunit en 1120 et jette les fondations des premières codifications et lois du royaume franc. La communauté samaritaine a le droit de construire une nouvelle synagogue vers 1130, l'ancienne étant transformée en église.\nC'est vers 1140 et le milieu du XIIe siècle que les Arabes musulmans et leurs troupes turques reprennent leurs attaques à partir de leur base arrière de Damas. Ils brûlent les églises et une partie de la ville en 1137, mais finissent par être repoussés. La reine Mélisende de Jérusalem demeure à Naplouse qui retrouve sa prospérité, entre 1150 et 1161. Les croisés restaurent et agrandissent la ville, font construire une nouvelle église dédiée à la Passion du Christ et une autre à sa Résurrection, ainsi qu'une vaste hôtellerie pour les pèlerins chrétiens.\nCependant, les musulmans commandés par la dynastie ayyoubide s'emparent de Naplouse en 1187. La majorité des chrétiens latins s'enfuit par crainte de vengeance, tandis que les chrétiens arabes grecs-orthodoxes et les Samaritains demeurent, ainsi bien sûr que les musulmans.\nLes églises croisées et la synagogue samaritaine sont transformées en mosquées.\n\nPériode des Mamelouks du Caire\nLes Mamelouks d'Égypte s'emparent de Naplouse en 1260, y font construire de nouvelles écoles et de nouvelles mosquées, des bains turcs et des canalisations d'eau. L'huile d'olive et le savon de Naplouse sont exportés et réputés, jusqu'en Syrie, Arabie, Égypte et les îles méditerranéennes, ainsi que la confiture de caroube.\n\nPériode ottomane (1517-1917)\nLa Palestine tombe sous l'autorité ottomane en 1517. Elle fait partie de la Syrie ottomane et est divisée en six districts (sandjak) dont Naplouse est l'un d'eux. Le district de Naplouse est lui-même divisé en cinq sous-districts en plus de la ville. Les subdivisions correspondent aux terres et à l'influence de puissantes familles. L'islam devient nettement majoritaire au XVIe siècle. En 1552, seules quelque douze famille juives se trouvent dans la ville, rencontrées par le voyageur Moïse Bassola (en). Des recensements municipaux effectués au XVIe siècle témoignent toutefois d'une communauté juive comptant de 30 à 70 familles. Naplouse est pacifiée à plusieurs reprises surtout en 1657 grâce à l'intervention et aux finances de familles et tribus syriennes. En remerciement pour leur participation au retour au calme, le pouvoir du sultan attribue des terres et des villages à ces familles, comme les Nimr, originaires d'Homs, les Djarrar ou les Touqan, qui dirigent l'administration de la ville.\nDaher el-Omar, gouverneur galiléen en rivalité avec le pouvoir ottoman s'allie au milieu du XVIIIe siècle avec les Mamelouks pour les faire revenir dans la région, et fait lever des troupes, mais Naplouse ne succombe pas, cependant Naplouse passe sous la juridiction de Saint-Jean-d'Acre, jusqu'en 1804.\n\nL'Égypte obtient son autonomie sous Méhémet Ali et part à la conquête de la Palestine en 1831-1832. Cependant en 1834, les clans des grandes familles de Naplouse se rebellent contre l'autorité égyptienne, à cause de l'augmentation des impôts et d'une politique de conscription répressive. Jérusalem est conquise par la rébellion le 31 mai 1834, mais les rebelles sont délogés un mois plus tard par les soldats d'Ibrahim Pacha. La forteresse de Saint-Jean-d'Acre est détruite, ce qui a pour conséquence de favoriser le développement de Naplouse. Les Ottomans reprennent le pouvoir en main et mettent le clan Abd al-Hadi à la tête des instances locales.\nNaplouse surpasse en importance Jérusalem, Acre, ou Jaffa. Son activité principale est liée à la fabrique et au commerce d'huile d'olive et de ses produits dérivés, comme le savon. C'est aussi une des régions principales de la Syrie ottomane pour le coton, dépassant Damas.\nDu fait de sa situation entourée de collines, Naplouse cultive un certain esprit et aussi un certain état d'autonomie par rapport au pouvoir central ottoman. En 1848, le voyageur historien Baptistin Poujoulat écrit dans Récits et souvenirs d'un voyage en Orient que la ville compte alors 6 000 habitants, musulmans, juifs, samaritains et chrétiens, et qu' « ils vivraient dans l'aisance s'ils n'étaient pas pressurés par l'impôt du gouvernement turc ».\n\nÀ partir de la fin du XIXe siècle, la présence juive à Naplouse décline, malgré la présence de rabbins reconnus, mais qui n'étaient entourés que de poignées de fidèles. De plusieurs dizaines de familles au début du XVIIIe siècle, la communauté n'en compte aux débuts du sionisme qu'une douzaine, en partie par l'attraction produite par les nouvelles localités juives, relativement éloignées de la Samarie. Le passage au XXe siècle voit l'effacement de la présence juive à Naplouse.\n\nXXe siècle\nPériode de l'occupation, puis du mandat britannique (1917-1948)\nNaplouse passe sous autorité britannique à partir de novembre 1917. C'est la fin du pouvoir ottoman. La Société des Nations donne mandat en 1920 aux Britanniques pour favoriser en Palestine la création d'un foyer de peuplement juif.\nUn tremblement de terre sévère détruit en 1927 la partie historique de la ville, dont trois-cents bâtiments et la mosquée de la Victoire. La ville est reconstruite, mais elle perd son caractère historique en grande partie. De plus, les Britanniques détruisent le vieux quartier de Qaryoun, foyer de rébellion, après les révoltes de 1936-1939.\n\nPériode de l'occupation jordanienne (1949-1967)\nNaplouse fait partie de la Cisjordanie, après le plan de partage de 1947. Des milliers de Palestiniens ayant quitté les territoires administrés par le nouvel État d'Israël s'installent dans des camps de réfugiés aux abords de la ville et dans la ville elle-même, annexée par la Jordanie. Les camps principaux sont Ein Beit al-Ma, Balata et Askar. Raymonda Hawa-Tawil (La « Lionne de Naplouse ») y tient dans les années 1960-1970 un salon d'intellectuels.\n\nPériode de l'occupation israélienne (1967-1995)\nLa guerre des Six Jours a pour conséquence l'administration israélienne et la fondation de localités juives autour de la ville, Berakha, Itamar et Elon Moreh étant les plus proches.\nFinalement, l'autorité palestinienne obtient l'administration de la ville à partir du 12 décembre 1995, selon les accords d'Oslo, ce qui provoque l'élimination quasi totale de la circulation de Juifs dans la ville (à titre d'exemple la ligne de bus Jérusalem-Afula de la compagnie israélienne Egged comptait auparavant Naplouse parmi ses stations principales).\n\nSeconde Intifada (2000-2002)\nLes tensions augmentent en l'an 2000 entre les forces israéliennes et les habitants des camps de réfugiés, en particulier ceux de Balata et d'Askar. Lorsque les Palestiniens déclenchent la seconde intifada, des armements sont fabriqués dans ces camps et la présence juive dans la ville est éliminée. La répression aboutit selon le bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires à 522 morts dans la ville de Naplouse et les camps environnants et à 3 104 blessés entre 2000 et 2005.\n\nL'attentat du 27 mars 2002 à l'hôtel Park de Netanya qui cause la mort de 30 civils juifs et en blesse 143, suivi du meurtre de 4 membres de la famille Gavish le lendemain à Elon Moreh et de l'attentat meurtrier à Netzarim le surlendemain, provoque l'opération Rempart de la part des autorités israéliennes du gouvernement Sharon. Naplouse est une des villes visées du fait de la présence de responsables des massacres. Quatre-vingts habitants de Naplouse sont tués et plusieurs maisons détruites. Une seconde opération démarre le 22 juin suivant et les forces armées israéliennes restent à Naplouse jusqu'en septembre, imposant un couvre-feu de vingt-quatre heures pendant soixante-dix jours. Soixante maisons d'activistes palestiniens sont détruites au bulldozer, la grande mosquée et d'autres mosquées, ainsi que l'église grecque-orthodoxe, sont endommagées par les combats.\n\nXXIe siècle\nNaplouse est actuellement cernée par de nombreuses colonies israéliennes et par deux bases militaires israéliennes perchées sur les crêtes des montagnes. Beaucoup de Palestiniens subissent les arrestations préventives et les détentions administratives sans procès ni jugement.\nLe 16 octobre 2015, des Palestiniens incendient le tombeau de Joseph, lieu de pèlerinage des Juifs orthodoxes.\nLe groupe armé La Fosse aux lions, formé de quelques dizaines de jeunes combattants, a été formé à Naplouse en 2022. Beaucoup d'entre eux ont été tués dans des raids israéliens et la ville a été soumise à un blocus en 2022.\nLe 19 février 2023, un raid israélien fait onze morts et au moins cent deux blessés par balles.\nLe 9 octobre 2024, selon le Croissant Rouge et le ministère de la Santé, quatre Palestiniens âgés de 31 à 43 ans sont tués lors d'une opération de la police israélienne ; de leur côté, les Israéliens, dans un communiqué commun de la police, de l'armée et du Shin Bet, affirment avoir abattu cinq personnes recherchées pour terrorisme. D'après le gouverneur de Naplouse, les victimes était des « citoyens ordinaires ».\nLe 25 février 2025, un habitant de la ville est tué et d'autres blessés par l'armée israélienne.\n\nDepuis le début de la guerre de Gaza en 2023 toute la région de Naplouse subit des contrôles parfois très longs. Dix-sept checkpoints militaires entourent la ville en 2025. Le 10 juin 2025, l'armée israélienne lance une vaste opération militaire contre la ville ; deux personnes sont tuées, plus d'une soixantaine blessées et d'autres arrêtées dans la répression d'un groupe de jeunes hommes et des garçons qui s'étaient réunis pour brûler des pneus et jeter des pierres sur les véhicules blindés des forces d'occupation israéliennes. Un couvre-feu est instauré et les bâtiments publics de Naplouse, notamment les écoles, sont fermés. Un adolescent est tué par l’armée israélienne le 24 octobre. Un homme de 57 ans est tué près d'un point de contrôle le 5 septembre.\n\nPolitique et administration\nLa ville est dirigée par un conseil de quatorze membres.\n\nJumelages\nLille (France)\n Naples (Italie)\n Poznań (Pologne) depuis le 22 mai 1997\n Stavanger (Norvège)\n Schaerbeek (Belgique)\n\nPatrimoine\nLe puits de Jacob\nLe puits de Jacob est situé à l'entrée[Laquelle ?] de l'actuelle Naplouse.\n\nLe tombeau de Joseph\nSichem, site du tombeau de Joseph.

          "content": "## Overview\nNablus (Arabic نابلس, Hebrew שכם, Shechem) is a large city (population approximately 300,000) within the Palestinian Territories, in the Central Highlands of the West Bank, some 63 km north of Jerusalem.\n\n## Understand\nNablus is one of the oldest cities in the world, possibly established 9,000 years ago. It was called \"Shechem\" by its Canaanite and Israelite inhabitants. Shechem was the first capital of the northern ancient Israelite kingdom. The Romans built a new city (Flavia Neapolis, in honor of Flavius Vespasian) a short distance from Shechem. The name Nablus comes from Neapolis. The old city of Nablus is on the site of Neapolis, but in modern times the city has grown to include the site of Shechem as well.\nNablus is distinguished by its location in a narrow valley between the two mountains Gerizim and Ebal. This makes for an impressive view when you are in the city.\nSchools were established in the middle of the 19th century during the short reign of Ibrahim Pasha, but maintained their existence in the following years when the Ottomans regained control of the region. On 11 July 1927 the town suffered a major earthquake. Much of the consequent damage to buildings was never repaired, and the ruinous condition of many of them may well have encouraged the inhabitants to move outside the old city to build their new houses, although some new building to the north and west of the old city had already been undertaken before 1927. The arrival of the motor car has increased emigration to the slopes of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where new roads allow vehicles the easy access denied them in the hilly and partly-stepped streets of the old city.\nDuring the British Mandate (1917–1948), Nablus became the core of Palestinian Arab Nationalism, and it was the center of resistance against the British. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Nablus came under Jordanian rule, and two refugee camps were built near the city. In 1967, Nablus was occupied by the Israeli army for years, which caused much damage to the city. Three refugee camps were added to accommodate the people who fled to the city.\nNablus was invaded and occupied in 2002 during the Second Intifada, and has been raided frequently ever since. Nablus has a particularly high concentration of open anti-Israeli sentiments for a major West Bank city; you can see many memorials to Palestinians killed during Israeli attacks in the old city, and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Palestinian militants occasionally clash in some parts of greater Nablus such as the refugee camps. There are many damaged buildings and debris-filled fields around Nablus, the result of past Israeli aerial bombing, but the residents of Nablus have been working hard on repairing their city and the visible damage lessens every day. Israeli restrictions on the city are generally looser than they used to be, and a visit to Nablus in the daytime is a safe and worthwhile trip.\n\n## Get in\nAs of July 2010 there were no checkpoints for buses and service taxis (aka servees) entering Nablus from other West Bank cities, although you will need your passport and visa stamp to enter back into Israeli territory upon your return.\n\n## By bus\nRamallah and Jerusalem: From Jerusalem, take the #18 bus to Ramallah. The bus departs from the bus station off Nablus Road north of Damascus Gate and the Old City. A #18 bus leaves every 10 minutes throughout the day, and it costs ₪7. This bus will drop passengers off at the main street in Ramallah, but stay on until the main bus station. From the Ramallah Bus Station, a bus runs to Nablus (₪10.5) but the last bus leaves early, often around 4PM. If the last bus has already left a servees taxi will take you to Nablus from Ramallah for around ₪17. There are at least four bus stations in Ramallah, so ask around if you get off/start at the wrong one.\nOther West Bank cities: Servees taxis are easily found to Nablus from all major west bank transportation centres including Jenin (₪20), Tulkarm, Jericho, and other cities.\n\n## By plane\nBen Gurion International Airport (TLV) is the main international airport serving Israel and the West Bank. From Ben Gurion it is cheapest to take a \"sherut\" (shared taxi) to the bus station on Nablus Road by Damascus Gate, and then follow the directions above to Nablus. A sherut from Ben Gurion to Jerusalem costs ₪50 and runs constantly 24 hours a day.\n\n## Get around\nMost of the urban area of Nablus is small enough to be navigated on foot. It is not recommend that you wander around too much as there are a number of neighborhoods in Nablus that may have troubles with IDF raids and public unrest. However, the tensions have eased, but you should still check for the latest situation.\nThe public transportation in Nablus is informal, and is normally done by sharing service taxis (aka servees). The black-and-yellow taxis (sometimes with a Hebrew \"Monit\" sign on top) will take you anywhere in Nablus, and it's easy to find people to share the taxi with for many locations.\n\n## See\n32.21945535.2606151 The Old City (southeast from the commercial center). This is a charming area filled with winding narrow streets and small shops selling all kinds of foods, clothing, and trinkets. Simply enter the alleyways leading into it nearby the massive parking garage in the center of town, and wander around until you recognize every street.\nThe Souq (The q is silent) is a typical colorful and loud Palestinian vegetable market located right in the center of town. Look for the tent roofs.\n32.20944735.2854312 Jacob's Well (Be'er Ya'akov). The spot where it is believed that a Samaritan woman offered a drink from the well to Jesus and he then revealed to her that he was the Messiah (John 4:5), is located here. All Western monotheistic religions also believe this to be a site where Jacob camped near Shechem during his travels, hence the name. A Greek Orthodox Church is located on the site, and it is free to tour. Its hours are unpredictable, however. Ask a taxi driver downtown to take you to \"Be'er Ya'akov\" (₪2-5). If you come for a visit, do not venture down the road away from the city center as you will find yourself inside rough neighbourhoods.\n32.203335.269733 Mount Gerizim (overlooking Nablus city). Check for the hours, as this place does not seem to be open all the time. The top of the mountain hosts the community of \"Kiryat Luza\", one of the only two Samaritan communities left in the world. The Samaritans are an ancient offshoot of Judaism who believe that Mount Gerizim, and not the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the location of the Holy of the Holies. The Samaritans of Nablus hold both Palestinian and Israeli ID cards and historically have had good relations with both the Palestinians and the Israelis (they are also represented in the Nablus Municipality). The Palestinians of Nablus revere the Samaritans alleged ability to predict the future with palm readings by using the Samaritan holy books. Kiryat Luza offers tours of their community and even has a gift shop. Genetic studies have made the hypothesis that much of Nablus' Palestinian population are descendants of Samaritans who converted to Islam throughout the centuries of Muslim rule of the Holy Land.    (updated Jun 2018)\n32.21004835.2649384 Monastery of Bir el-Hamam (next to Mount Gerizim). Seen from all over Nablus, this monastery offers a great from above Nablus. The archaeological site included a complex of household installation and spaces, such as an open courtyard, a rain-fed cistern, a stable, and a kitchen. It also included a room with a mosaic floor with fragments of religious texts. This room gave access to an exceptional space of a chapel with colourful mosaics and a dedicatory text for three deceased ‘brothers, lovers of Christ’. A nicely decorated chancel screen separated the holy eastern part, the bema, with its altar table, from the main room.\n32.2126935.2854735 Joseph's Tomb. In the eastern part of the city is a Muslim and Jewish holy site; however, it closes sporadically and it may not be possible to visit. As of March 2008 Joseph's Tomb had part of the roof destroyed and has been burnt out. Of the two Palestinian guards, one spoke English, and after radioing in advised that photos could not be taken without permission.\n32.21335.282046 Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Daily 8AM - 3PM. Tell Balata archaeological site, near Nablus, the site contains the remains of a Middle Bronze Age city with a massive fortification wall (ca. 1650-1450 BC), two impressive gates and a fortress temple. The site has been identified as ancient Shechem, known from Egyptian and biblical references. Tell Balata was an important cultural and political centre due to its strategic location at the eastern end of a pass between Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal. It was overlooking the plain of Askar and commanded all traffic through the area. It was also a centre for agriculture and trade, it has been called “the uncrowned queen of Palestine”. The archaeological evidence on the history on the site is the result of German and American excavation during the 20th century. It shows that Tell Balata was first settled in the Chalcolithic period (c.4000- 3500 BC) and developed into a city during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. The site was used again during the Iron Age and throughout the Hellenistic times until the 1st century BC. After the Hellenistic times the focus of the settlement shifted further west to the newly established Roman town of Flavia Neapolis, now known as Nablus. Tell Balata is a potential World Heritage Site as part of \"Old Town Nablus and its environs\". The site is being developed by a joined Palestinian-Dutch project, in cooperation with UNESCO, into Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Facilities for visitors will be provided, as of 2013 there will be a visitor centre.\nClose-by popular sights of the West Bank (read here) are Sebastia Archaeological Park (conveniently located if you go north towards Jenin), Awarta village, Kifl Hares and Aqabah with the twin minaret.\n\n## Do\nClimb Mount Gerizim or Mount Ebal on either side of Nablus for a beautiful view of the city. A small Samaritan community, one of only two left in the world, resides atop Mt. Gerizim, and you can get a look at their temple on the mountaintop. Mt Gerizim is the most holiest place for the Samaritan religion, believed by the Samaritans to be the first piece of land ever created by God, and the Samaritan community there offers a tour of their community to visitors. If you can come for their Passover (not necessarily the same date as the modern Jewish Passover!) you will see a colorful festival involving the consumption of lamb and goat sacrifices, comparable to Jewish practices 2,000 years ago. Check for opening hours.\nYafo Cultural Centre, ☏ +970 9-232-4553.

          "content": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ḫazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Ḫāzat. It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, עַזָּה ʻAzzā, a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root ע-ז-ז‎ ʻayin-zayin-zayin, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The ע‎ in the root ע-ז-ז‎ corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *ʻ sound (compare Hebrew עַז ʻaz with Arabic عَزَّ ʻazza, both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (غَزَّة, Ġazza), Koine Greek (Γάζα, Gáza), and Egyptian (gꜣḏꜣtw) that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *ġ (/ʁ/) sound, and thus cannot have been from the same ע-ז-ז‎ root as עַז ʻaz.\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as Ġazzat Hāšim in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\nEarly Bronze\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\n\nLate Bronze\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as Azzatu. Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\n\nIron Age\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays–Yaman war (793–796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\n\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\n\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\n\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGaza War\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Gaza is 78 kilometres (48 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, 71 kilometres (44 mi) south of Tel Aviv, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\n\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of 270 feet (82 m) above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (maqam) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\n\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\n\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres) of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds 122 trillion cubic feet (3.5 trillion cubic metres) of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\n\nCulture\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include zibdiyit gambari, literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and shatta which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in sayyadiya, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were fellahin (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. Sumaghiyyeh, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. Maftool is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (qahwa) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\n\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\n\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits 1.5 km (1 mi) northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\n\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\n\nInfrastructure\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\n\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) northeast of the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGaza genocide\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian Authority\nList of rulers of Gaza\nOutline of the State of Palestine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nMunicipality of Gaza\nSpokesperson for Gaza Municipality\nGaza at Google Maps\nThe achievements of the municipal council for a period of 5 years (2008–2013) in Arabic Archived 19 August 2014 at the Wayback Machine",
          "summary": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.",

الشمال الشرقي أراضي مدينة الخليل الغربية المحتلة منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظة غزة إداريًا وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 2,141,000 نسمة في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها أكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من أكثر المدن كثافة بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينة غزة من أهم المدن الفلسطينية؛ لأهمية موقعها الاستراتيجي والأهمية الاقتصادية والعمرانية للمدينة، بالإضافة إلى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والإنجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزاً إسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى أيضاً غزة هاشم، كما أنها مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو أحد أئمة المذاهب الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948م، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجرت عدة تحسينات على المدينة. احتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967م (عام النكسة)، وبعد اتفاقية أوسلو بين منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية وإسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزة-أريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطة المدنية إلى سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثورة المصرية في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطني غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالأنشطة الاقتصادية الرئيسية في قطاع غزة هي الصناعات الصغيرة والزراعة والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الإسرائيلي والصراعات المتكررة.\n\nالتسمية\nتُعتبر غزة أحد أقدم المدن التي عرفها التاريخ، أما سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم فهو غير مُثبَّت بدقة، لأن هذا الاسم كان قابلاً للتبديل والتحريف بتبدل الأمم التي صارعتها، فهي عند الكنعانيين (هزاتي)، وعند الفراعنة (غزاتو أو غذة) منذ القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، أما الآشوريون واليونانيون فكانوا يطلقون عليها (عزاتي) و(فازا)، وعند العبرانيين (عزة). أما العرب الجنوبيين (سبأ، ومعين) فهي عندهم باللفظ العربي (غزة)، وهي في وصفهم ميناء مهم بالقرب من قرى اليهود، وذكرت لديهم منذ القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد فصاعدًا.\nفي العصور الوسطى، سماها الصليبيون (غادرز)، والأتراك لم يغيروا من اسمها العربي (غزة)، أما الإنجليز ويطلقون عليها اسم (گازا) (بالإنجليزية: Gaza). وقد اختلف المؤرخون - كعادتهم بالنسبة لكثير من المدن القديمة – في سبب تسميتها بغزة، فهناك من يقول إنها مشتقة من المَنَعَة والقوة، وهناك من يقول إن معناها: «الثروة»، وآخرون يرون أنها تعني: «المُميزة» أو «المُختصة» بصفات هامة تميزها عن غيرها من المدن. أما ياقوت الحموي فيقول عنها في معجمه: «غَزَّ فلان بفلان واعتز به إذا اختصه من بين أصحابه».\nارتبط العرب بغزة ارتباطاً وثيقاً فقد كان تجارهم يَفِدون إليها في تجارتهم وأسفارهم باعتبارها مركزاً مهماً لعدد من الطرق التجارية، وكانت تمثل الهدف لإحدى الرحلتين الشهيرتين اللتين وردتا في القرآن الكريم في «سورة قريش»: «رحلتا الشتاء والصيف»: رحلة القرشيين شتاءً إلى اليمن، ورحلتهم صيفاً إلى غزة ومشارف الشام. وفي إحدى رحلات الصيف هذه، مات هاشم بن عبد مناف جدُّ الرسول المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم، ودُفن في غزة بالجامع المعروف حالياً بجامع السيد هاشم في حي «الدرج».\n\nالتاريخ\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد. وطيلة تاريخها، لم يكن لغزة حكم مستقل، حيث احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين وغيرهم. وكانت أول مرة تذكر فيها المدينة في مخطوطة للفرعون تحتمس الثالث (القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد)، وكذلك ورد اسمها في رسائل تل العمارنة. بعد 300 سنة من الاحتلال الفرعوني للمدينة نزلت قبيلة من الفلستينيين وسكنت المدينة والمنطقة المجاورة لها، عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزا إسلاميا مهما وخاصة أنها مشهورة بوجود قبر الجد الثاني للنبي محمد، هاشم بن عبد مناف فيها ولذلك أحيانا تسمى غزة هاشم. وتُعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي 767م الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. سيطر الأوروبيون على المدينة في فترة الحملات الصليبية، لكنها رجعت تحت حكم المسلمين بعد أن انتصر صلاح الدين الأيوبي عليهم في معركة حطين عام 1187. ازدهرت المدينة في آخر أيام الحكم العثماني، حيث تأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي عام 1893. سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزء من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجريت عدة تحسينات في المدينة.\nاحتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967 (النكسة)، ولكن في عام 1993م، نُقلت المدينة إلى السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. بعد انتخابات عام 2006، اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس. ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. لكن بعد الثورة المصرية، قامت مصر بفتح معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطنين غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.\n\nالفترة القديمة\nيعود الاستيطان البشري في منطقة قطاع غزة إلى تل السكن، وهو حصن مصري قديم، والذي بني في الأراضي الكنعانية إلى الجنوب من قطاع غزة في الوقت الحاضر. كما أن مركزًا آخر في المناطق الحضرية المعروفة باسم تل العجول بدأ ينمو على طول وادي مجرى النهر في غزة.\nخلال العصر البرونزي الأوسط، أصبحت تل السكن أقصى مدن جنوب كنعان، وكانت وظيفتها بمثابة حصن. في عام 1650 قبل الميلاد، عندما احتل الهكسوس مصر، عُمرت مدينة ثانية على أنقاض تل السكن. ومع ذلك، هجرها في القرن 14 قبل الميلاد، في نهاية العصر البرونزي.\nأصبحت غزة في وقت لاحق عاصمة مصر الإدارية في أرض كنعان. في عهد تحتمس الثالث، أصبحت المدينة محطة على طريق القوافل بين مصر وسوريا، وجاءت في رسائل تل العمارنة باسم \"Azzati\".\nبقيت المدينة تحت السيطرة المصرية لمدة 350 عاما حتى غزاها الفلستينيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، وأصبحت جزءا من البنتابوليس \"pentapolis\" الخاص بهم. ووفقا لسفر القضاة، فإن غزة كانت المكان الذي كان قد سجن فيه شمشون من قبل الفلستينيين حتى وفاته.\nبعد أن سيطر الآشوريون والمصريون على المدينة، حققت غزة الاستقلال النسبي والازدهار في ظل الامبراطورية الفارسية. ولقد حاصر الاسكندر الأكبر غزة، حيث بقت آخر مدينة تقاوم غزوه في طريقه إلى مصر، لمدة خمسة أشهر قبل احتلالها أخيرا سنة 332 قبل الميلاد، وكان سكانها إما قتلوا أو تم سبيهم. أحضر الإسكندر البدو المحليين ليسكنوا غزة، ونظم المدينة إلى بوليس (أو دولة-المدينة). وقد اكتسبت المدينة سمعة طيبة كمركز مزدهر للتعلم اليونانية والفلسفة.\nشهدت غزة حصارا آخر في 96 قبل الميلاد من قبل الحشمونيين الذين «أطاحوا تماما» في المدينة، مما أسفر عن مقتل 500 من أعضاء مجلس الشيوخ الذين كانوا قد فروا إلى معبد أبولو للسلامة.\n\nالعهد الروماني والبيزنطي\nأُعيد بناء المدينة بعد دمجها في الإمبراطورية الرومانية في 63 قبل الميلاد تحت قيادة بومبيوس الكبير، ثم أصبحت غزة بعد ذلك جزءا من أحد مقاطعات الدولة الرومانية في بلاد الشام. وكانت المدينة مستهدفة من قبل اليهود خلال تمردهم ضد الحكم الروماني في 66 وقد دمرت جزئيا. وظلت مع ذلك مدينة مهمة، خاصة بعد تدمير القدس. طوال العصر الروماني، كانت غزة مدينة مزدهرة وتلقى المنح واهتمام عدة أباطرة. كان 500 عضو في مجلس الشيوخ يحكم غزة، وكان سكان المدينة مجموعة متنوعة من مختلف الأعراق، منهم الفلستينيين والإغريق والرومان والكنعانيين والفينيقيين واليهود والفراعنة والفرس، بالإضافة إلى البدو. وكانت تصدر في غزة عملات معدنية تزين مع تماثيل الآلهة والأباطرة. وخلال زيارته للمدينة في 130م، قام الإمبراطور هادريان بافتتاح حلبة المصارعة شخصيا، في ملعب غزة الجديد، الذي أصبح معروفًا من الإسكندرية إلى دمشق. وقد زينت المدينة في العديد من المعابد الوثنية، وكان الإله الرئيسي \"مارناس\"، وهو أحد الآلهة القديمة التي انتشرت عبادتها في سوريا القديمة منذ النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وكان يطلق عليها داجون. وخُصصت المعابد الأخرى لزيوس، وهيليوس، وأفروديت، وأبولو، وأثينا، وتيشي المحلية.\nبدأت المسيحية بالانتشار في جميع أنحاء منطقة غزة في 250م، بما في ذلك في ميناء غزة.\nوتسارع اعتناق المسيحية في منطقة غزة في فترة القديس بورفيريوس (بين عامي 396م و 420م). في سنة 402م، أمر الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الثاني بتدمير جميع معابد المدينة الوثنية الثمانية، وبعد أربع سنوات كلفت الإمبراطورة ايليا ببناء كنيسة فوق أنقاض معبد Marnas.\nوبعد انقسام الإمبراطورية الرومانية في القرن 3 م، كانت غزة لا تزال تحت سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية الشرقية التي بدورها أصبحت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية. ازدهرت المدينة، وكانت مركزا هاما لبلاد الشام.\n\nالحكم الإسلامي\nفي عام 635م حاصر المسلمون غزة وسيطر عليها جيش الخلفاء الراشدين تحت قيادة عمرو بن العاص بعد معركة أجنادين بين الإمبراطورية البيزنطية والخلافة الراشدة في وسط فلسطين. وكان وصول العرب المسلمين قد جلب تغييرات جذرية على غزة، في البداية حُولت بعض الكنائس إلى مساجد، بما في ذلك المسجد الكبير الحالي في قطاع غزة (الأقدم في المدينة)، كما أن شريحة كبيرة من السكان اعتنقت الإسلام، وأصبحت اللغة العربية هي اللغة الرسمية.\nوتعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الشافعي (767) الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. والذي عاش طفولته المبكرة هناك. وكان الشافعي قد أسس فلسفة إسلامية سنية في الفقه، وسُمي المذهب الشافعي تكريما له. وعلى الرغم من حظر الكحول في الإسلام، سمح للجاليات اليهودية والمسيحية للحفاظ على إنتاج النبيذ والعنب، وهو محصول نقدي رئيسي في المدينة، وكانت أساسا للتصدير إلى مصر. لأنه تحدها الصحراء، وكانت غزة عرضة لقتال جماعات البدو.\nفي عام 796م دُمرت غزة خلال حرب أهلية بين القبائل العربية في المنطقة. ومع ذلك، تم إعادة بناء المدينة من قبل الخلافة العربية الثالثة التي يحكمها العباسيون. وقد وصف الجغرافي العربي المقدسي غزة في 977م حين كان يحكمها الفاطميون «بأنها بلدة كبيرة تقع على الطريق الرئيسي لمصر على الحدود مع الصحراء.» وقد كان في تلك الفترة اتفاق مع السلاجقة، تم بموجبه سيطرة الفاطميين على غزة والأراضي الواقعة جنوبها، بما في ذلك مصر.\n\nالصليبيون والمماليك\nاحتل الصليبيون الأوروبيون المدينة من الفاطميين في عام 1100م، وقام الملك بلدوين الثالث ببناء القلعة التي استخدمها فرسان الهيكل في غزة في عام 1149. كما تحول الجامع الكبير إلى كاتدرائية القديس يوحنا. في عام 1154، كتب الرحالة العربي الإدريسي عن غزة «المدينة اليوم كثيرة السكان، وهي في أيدي الصليبيين».\nفي عام 1187م سيطرت القوات الأيوبية، بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على غزة، ثم دُمّرت تحصيناتها لاحقًا عام 1191م. وقد أمر ريتشارد قلب الأسد بتدعيم المدينة مرة أخري في 1192، لكن تم تفكيك الجدران مرة أخرى نتيجة لمعاهدة الرملة المتفق عليها في 1193. ولقد استمرت الفترة الأيوبية حتى 1260، بعد تدمير المدينة تماما على يد المغول تحت قيادة هولاكو، حيث أصبحت غزة أبعد نقطة إلى جنوب يتقدم إليها الجيش المغولي.\nبعد تدمير غزة على يد المغول، بدأ الجنود المماليك بإدارة المنطقة في عام 1277م. وقد جعل المماليك غزة عاصمة المحافظة التي تحمل اسمها «حاكمية قطاع غزة». هذه منطقة تمتد على طول السهل الساحلي من مدينة رفح في الجنوب إلى الشمال مباشرة من قيسارية، وإلى الشرق. بقدر ما المرتفعات الغربية وتلال الخليل المدن الرئيسية الأخرى في المحافظة وشملت اللد والرملة. وقد استخدم غزة التي دخلت فترة من الهدوء خلال الفترة المملوكية بها كموقع في هجماتهم ضد الصليبيين التي انتهت في 1290.\nفي عام 1294م، ضرب زلزال غزة فدمرها، وبعد مرور خمس سنوات، عاد المغول ليُدمروا كل ما أعاد المماليك بناءه. وقد وصف الجغرافي الدمشقي (الذي توفي عام 1327) غزة باعتبارها «مدينة كثيرة الشجر، كسماط ممدود لجيش الإسلام في أبواب الرمل ولكل صادر ووارد إلى الديار المصرية والشامية.» وفي 1348م، انتشر الطاعون في المدينة، فقضى على معظم سكانها. كما عانى قطاع غزة من الفيضانات المدمرة في عام 1352، والتي كانت نادرة في ذلك الجزء القاحل من بلاد الشام الجنوبية.\nإلا أن الرحالة العربي والكاتب ابن بطوطة عندما زار المدينة في 1355، كتب عنها «انها كبيرة ومزدحمة بالسكان، وفيها العديد من المساجد». وقد ساهم المماليك في الهندسة المعمارية في غزة ببناء المساجد والمدارس الإسلامية، والمستشفيات، والحمامات العامة. كما سمحوا لليهود بالعودة إلى المدينة، وقد شهد العصر المملوكي ازدهار المجتمع اليهودي في المدينة. في عام 1481م، كتب الرحالة مشولام «إنها أرض جيدة، ذات أشجار فاكهة وثمار والتي هي من نوعية ممتازة، وهناك الخبز والخمر، والذي هو من صنع اليهود فقط، وفيها عدد كبير من السكان، هناك 70 عائلة يهودية 4 عائلات سامرية». في نهاية العصر المملوكي كانت الطائفة اليهودية في غزة ثالث أكبر جالية يهودية في فلسطين، بعد صفد والقدس.\nوقد بنى المماليك واحدا من أهم المعالم في غزة، وهو قصر الباشا، الذي كان يُستخدم لحكم المدينة وإدارتها. ويقع القصر في البلدة القديمة وهو اليوم مدرسة للبنات، بالقرب من مقبرة حرب الكومنولث، غالبًا ما يشار إليها بمقبرة الحرب البريطانية، والتي تحتوي على قبور جنود الحلفاء الذين سقطوا في الحرب العالمية الأولى وهي في حي التفاح.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت المدينة تحت حكم الخلافة العثمانية الإسلامية في القرن السادس عشر وبقيت تحت حكمهم حتى سنة 1917 عندما استولت عليها القوات البريطانية خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى بعد ثلاثة معارك ضارية راح ضحيتها الآلاف من كلا الجانبين. وكانت غزة تتبع متصرفية القدس العثمانية، والتي كانت تتبع مباشرة للباب العالي دون أن تتبع أيا من الولايات. وكانت المتصرفية تضم بالإضافة إلى قضاء غزة، كل من أقضية يافا وبئر السبع والخليل. وقد حافظت متصرفية القدس حتى أواخر العهد العثماني- باستثناء الفترة من 1906 حتى 1909 عندما ضم إليها قضاء الناصرة- على حدودها.\nيذكر أنه في الحرب العالمية الأولى عندما صمد لواء واحد من الجيش العثماني مؤلف من أقل من ثلاثة آلف جندي فلسطيني في وجه فرقتين بريطانيتين أمام غزة وكبدهم خسائر فادحة وأرغمهما على التقهقر حتى العريش عام 1917 م، أصدر أحمد جمال باشا القائد التركي الذي اشتهر بخصومته للعرب، بيانا رسميا أشاد فيه بالشجاعة الفذة التي أبداها أولئك الجنود الفلسطينيون في غزة أمام أضعاف أضعافهم من جنود الأعداء، وأنها بسالة خارقة تذكر بالشجاعة التي أبداها آباؤهم من قبل عندما حموا هذه البقاع المقدسة بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت غزة بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت غزة مركزا لقضاء غزة في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة، أصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى الدولة الفلسطينية المقترحة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قامت مصر بدخول المدينة عام 1948. في فبراير عام 1949 وقعت كل من مصر وإسرائيل هدنة تقضي باحتفاظ مصر بالمدينة ولذلك كانت مأوى لكثير من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عند خروجهم من ديارهم. وبقيت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nوكانت غزة في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء غزة، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\nحكومة عموم فلسطين\n\nهي حكومة تشكلت في غزة في 23 سبتمبر 1948  وذلك خلال حرب 1948 برئاسة أحمد حلمي عبد الباقي.\nنشأت فكرت تكوينها عندما أعلنت بريطانيا عن نيتها التخلي عن انتدابها على فلسطين وأحالت قضيتها إلى الأمم المتحدة. أدركت القيادة الفلسطينية عندئذ، ممثلة آنذاك بالهيئة العربية العليا لفلسطين بزعامة الحاج أمين الحسيني، أهمية التهيؤ لهذا الحدث واستباقه بإيجاد إطار دستوري يملأ الفراغ الذي سوف ينجم عن انتهاء الانتداب البريطاني وكان هذا الإطار هو إقامة حكومة عربية فلسطينية.\nكان قبل ذلك فولك برنادوت قد أعلن في تقرير له في 16 سبتمبر 1948 أن العرب لم يبدوا أي رغبة في تشكيل حكومة في القسم العربي من فلسطين مما قد يؤدي إلى ضمه إلى شرق الأردن. وقد قوبل إعلان هذه الحكومة بالرفض من عدة أنظمة عربية هي الأردن والعراق ومصر. وظل تمثيلها شكليا لفلسطين في الجامعة العربية لعدة سنوات قبل انهيارها.\n\nالحكم المصري\nبعد حرب 1948، أُلحقت المدينة مع كامل قطاع غزة بمصر، حيث بقت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nفي فترة العدوان الثلاثي على مصر سنة 1956 قامت إسرائيل باحتلال المدينة والسيطرة على شبه جزيرة سيناء المصرية، لكن الضغط العالمي على إسرائيل اضطرها للانسحاب منها.\nحيث حدث في ربيع 1956 عدّة اصطدامات عسكرية بين مصر وإسرائيل حدثت في قطاع غزة. إسرائيل اتّهمت مصر باستعمال المنطقة كقاعدة للغارات الفدائية على إسرائيل. في أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 1956، هاجمت إسرائيل منطقة قناة السويس في مصر بالتعاون مع فرنسا وبريطانيا، استولت القوّات الإسرائيلية على قطاع غزة وتقدّمت إلى سيناء.\nفي مارس/آذار التالي، حلّت قوات طوارئ الأمم المتحدة محل القوات الإسرائيلية، ومصر استعادت السيطرة على الإدارة المدنية للشريط. وأعيد احتلال المدينة في حرب الستة أيام (5 يونيو 1967 - 10 يونيو 1967).\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي غزة وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nكانت مساحة المستوطنات الإسرائيلية في قطاع غزة تبلغ 155 كيلومترا مربعاً تقريباً، وبالنسبة للكتلة المحيطة بمدينة غزة، وهي الكتلة الشمالية، فتتوزع المستوطنات التي تتصل بإسرائيل عبر طرق عرضية تضمن لها سهولة الاتصال، تضم:\n\nمستوطنة إيرتز: (أنشئت عام 1968م) على الحدود الشمالية لقطاع غزة مباشرة.\nمستوطنة إيلي سيناي: تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر ملاصقة تماما لحدود قطاع غزة الشمالية، وهي مستوطنة زراعية أنشئت عام 1983 لاستيعاب عددا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء في أعقاب اتفاقية السلام المصرية ـ الإسرائيلية.\nمستوطنة نيسانيت: (أنشئت عام 1982م) على بعد 5 كم شرق البحر، وهي مستوطنة زراعية، أنشئت لتستوعب أعدادا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء.\nمستوطنة نتساريم: أنشئت عام 1972 م لتقسم قطاع غزة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي، فهي تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر، وعلى بعد 1 كم إلى الغرب من الطريق الرئيس، وعلى بعد 4 كم جنوب غزة، ونظرا لاتساع مساحة هذه المستوطنة، وموقعها المتميز جنوبي مدينة غزة، والمشاكل الناجمة عن هذه المستوطنة، جعلت منها كتلة استيطانية قائمة بذاتها.\nفي ديسمبر 1987، انخرط سكان غزة مبكرًا في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى (انتفاضة الحجارة) وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع غزة مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. وأغلقت المدارس في مدينة غزة قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية قد انسحبت من قطاع غزة في 15 آب / أغسطس 2005 وذلك بقرار من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي أريئيل شارون بعد إنشاءها منذ 38 عاما، تم بعدها تفكيك 21 مستوطنة بقطاع غزة و4 مستوطنات بالضفة الغربية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nبقيت المدينة تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حتى عام 1994، حيث أنه في سبتمبر 1993، بعد مُفاوضات سرية، وقّع كل من رئيس وزراء إسرائيل إسحاق رابين ورئيس منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية ياسر عرفات اتفاقية إعلان مبادئ التي تقر انسحاب إسرائيل من قطاع غزة ومناطق أخرى، وتحويل إدارة الحكومة المحلية للفلسطينيين، وفي مايو 1994، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من المدينة ومن القطاع بشكل جزئي تاركة عدة مستوطنات لها تحت امرة الجيش الإسرائيلي في عمق القطاع، وتولت بموجب إتفاقية أوسلو السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية إدارة المدينة بعد أن كانت تتخذها قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي مقرًا لها أثناء احتلال قطاع غزة ما بين 1967 و1994، وأصبحت منطقة قطاع غزة جُزئيًا تحت حكم السلطة الفلسطينية، إلا أن قطاع غزة ظل فعليًا تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي إلى أن انسحبت إسرائيل بالكامل من أراضي قطاع غزة في 15 أغسطس 2005 بأوامر من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي وقتها أريئيل شارون وأبقت على حصارها برًا وبحرًا وجوًا.\nبعد فوز حركة حماس بعدد كبير من مقاعد البرلمان الفلسطيني في الانتخابات اندلعت العديد من المناوشات المتفرقة بين عناصر من حركتي فتح وحماس ووصل الأمر ذروته في منتصف يونيو من عام 2007 حيث قامت حركة حماس بالسيطرة على كامل قطاع غزة والمؤسسات الأمنية والحكومية فيه.\n\nوفي نهاية عام 2008 وبداية عام 2009 وتحديدا بدءا من 27 ديسمبر 2008، بدأت إسرائيل حرب عدوانية شرسة على قطاع غزة بدأت بالقصف الجوي العنيف لجميع مقرات الشرطة الفلسطينية ثم تتالى القصف لمدة أسبوع للمنازل والمساجد وحتى المستشفيات وبعد أسبوع بدأت بالزحف البري إلى الأماكن المفتوحة في حملة عسكرية عدوانية غاشمة كان هدفها حسب ما أعلن قادة الاحتلال الصهيوني هو إنهاء حكم حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، والقضاء على المقاومة الفلسطينية لا سيما إطلاق الصواريخ محلية الصنع مثل صاروخ القسام أو صواريخ روسية أو صينية مثل صاروخ غراد التي وصل مداها خلال الحرب إلى 50 كم، واستُخدمت القوات الصهيونية الأسلحة والقذائف المحرمة دوليًا مثل القنابل الفسفورية المسرطنة والقنابل آجلة التفجير وغيرها.\nحاصرت القوات الإسرائيلية قطاع غزة، وقطعت عنها الكهرباء والوقود، وحرمت المرضى من الأدوية، ومنعت الدول العربية المُجاورة من إدخال الوقود إلى القطاع، وما زال الحصار مفروضًا على القطاع حتى الآن، وقد قتل كثير من الفلسطينيين من جراء الاشتباكات والتوغلات الإسرائيلية في القطاع، لا سيما حين قصفت مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزة بالصواريخ وتوغلت فيه.\nنزح كثير من الفلسطينيين إلى معبر رفح آملين أن يدخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية ليبحثوا عن السلام، لكن الإدارة المصرية منعت النازحين من الدخول إلى الأراضي المصرية، وقد كسر النازحون معبر رفح في شهر مارس ودخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية وما زالوا يعانون من آثار الحصار إلى الآن.\nوتحاول منظمات إنسانية دولية كسر الحصار المفروض على غزة من خلال إرسال سفن بها عدد من النشطاء، محملة بالمساعدات الإنسانية، إلا أن إسرائيل تمنع وصول تلك السفن، ومن تلك المحاولات أسطول الحرية عام 2010،  وما تعرض له من هجوم عسكري إسرائيلي.\n\nفي نوفمبر 2012، أقدمت إسرائيل على الهجوم على غزة بقصف عشوائي استهدف في بادئ الأمر أحد قادة حماس، إلاّ إنه طال المدنيين بشكل رئيسي، ونتج عنه العشرات من الضحايا. وقد ردّت المقاومة الفلسطينية بشكل غير مسبوق عبر قصفها لمدن في العمق الإسرائيلي كتل أبيب، وهرتسيليا وبئر السبع بعشرات الصواريخ.\nفي صيف 2014، شنت إسرائيل حربًا أخرى على غزة، فبدءا من يوم 8 يوليو 2014 بدأ الجيش الإسرائيلي عملية الجرف الصامد وردت كتائب عز الدين القسام بمعركة العصف المأكول  وردت حركة الجهاد الإسلامي بعملية البنيان المرصوص وذلك بعد موجة عنف تفجرت مع خطف وتعذيب وحرق الطفل محمد أبو خضير من شعفاط على أيدي مجموعة مستوطنين في 2 يوليو 2014،، وإعادة اعتقال العشرات من محرري صفقة شاليط، وأعقبها احتجاجات واسعة في القدس وداخل عرب 48 وكذلك مناطق الضفة الغربية، واشتدت وتيرتها بعد أن دهس إسرائيلي اثنين من العمال العرب قرب حيفا، وتخلل التصعيد قصف متبادل بين إسرائيل والمقاومة الفلسطينية في قطاع غزة. تخلل هذه الحرب عدة عمليات عسكرية مثل عملية ناحل عوز وعملية العاشر من رمضان.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيقع وسط غزة على تلة بارتفاع 45 قدما (14 متر) فوق مستوى البحر. بُنيت جزء كبير من المدينة الحديثة على طول السهل أسفل التل، وخصوصا في الشمال والشرق، وتشكّل ضواحي غزة. يقع كل من شاطئ وميناء غزة على بعد 3 كم (1,9 ميل) عن مركز مدينة غزة. تبعد مدينة غزة 78 كيلومترًا (48 ميل) إلى الجنوب الغربي من القدس، و 71 كيلومترًا (44 ميل) جنوب تل أبيب،  وعلى بعد 30 كيلومترًا (19 ميل) شمال مدينة رفح. مواقع محيطة تشمل بيت لاهيا وبيت حانون، وجباليا إلى الشمال، وقرية أبو مدين، ومخيم البريج ومخيم النصيرات ومدينة دير البلح إلى الجنوب.\nتبلغ مساحة الأراضي التابعة للبلدية ما يُقارب 45 كم مربع (17 ميل مربع). في الانتداب البريطاني، شكلت المناطق الحضرية (المبنية) ما يقارب 7,960 كيلو متر مربع (3070 ميل مربع) أما المناطق الريفية شكلت 143,063 كيلو متر مربع (55,237 ميل مربع). بلغت مساحة الأراضي المروية 24,040 كم مربع (9,280 ميل مربع) والأراضي المزروعة بالحبوب حيث بلغت مساحتها 117,899 كم مربع (45,521 ميل مربع).\n\nيعتمد سكان غزة على المياه الجوفية كمصدر وحيد للشرب والاستخدام الزراعي والمنزلي. يعد وادي غزة أقرب جدول مائي جنوبا. والذي يحتوي على كمية قليلة من الماء في الشتاء أما صيفا فيكاد لا يحتوي على ماء. يتم تحويل معظم إمدادات المياه فيها إلى إسرائيل. المياه الجوفية على طول ساحل قطاع غزة هو الخزان الرئيسي للماء في قطاع غزة وتتكون معظمها من الحجر الرملي العصر الجليدي. مثل معظم قطاع غزة، مغطى غزة بتراب رباعي.\nالمعادن الطينية في التربة تمتص الكثير من المواد الكيميائية العضوية وغير العضوية والتي قد خففت جزئيًا مدى تلوث المياه الجوفية. تلة معروفة في جنوب شرق غزة تسمى (المنطار) وهو ذات ارتفاع 270 قدم (82 م) فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتشكل البلدة القديمة جزء رئيسي من نواة غزة. وتتكون من حي الدرج في الشمال (المعروف أيضًا باسم الحي مسلم) وحي الزيتون في الجنوب. تعود مُعظم المباني إلى العصر المملوكي أو العصر العثماني وبُنيت على بعض المباني القديمة. وتبلغ مساحة البلدة القديمة حوالي 1,6 كيلومتر مربع (0.62 ميل مربع). تتكون غزة من 11 حي، يقع حي الدرج وحي الصبرة ما بين حي الرمال والبلدة القديمة.\n\nحي الشجاعية: من أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، وينقسم إلى قسمين الشجاعية الجنوبية (التركمان) والشجاعية الشمالية (الجديدة)، بُنى خلال عهد الأيوبيين، يسكنه أكثر من 300 ألف نسمة، ويعمل معظم سكانه بصناعات خفيفة مثل الخياطة والزراعة وغيرها كما أنه يمتاز بأنه منطقة تجارية فيها كل الأشكال التجارية والورش، به مقبرتان القديمة، ومقبرة الشهداء، وبه أكبر منطقة صناعية في غزة، وبه معبر المنطار التجاري. وقد شهد هذا الحي العديد من الاجتياحات الإسرائيلية.\nحي التفاح: تعود هذه التسمية لكثرة أشجار التفاح التي كانت تنتشر في هذا الحي وهو من الأحياء القديمة بمدينة غزة.\nحي الرمال: ويعتبر من أرقى أحياء مدينة غزة وأكبرها مساحة بُني في ثلاثينيات وأربعينيات القرن 20، وينقسم إلي الرمال الشمالي والجنوبي. ويمتد الشمالي منه من بداية حي الشيخ رضوان (الشارع الأول) إلى شارع المختار والرمال الجنوبي من شارع عمر المختار إلى بداية حي تل الهوى.\nحي النصر: سُمي الحي بالنصر احترامًا للجمال عبد الناصر الذي بُني في خمسينيات القرن 20.\nحي الزيتون: سمي بذلك لكثرة أشجار الزيتون المزروعة فيه، ولكن تم اقتلاع وتجريف الكثير منها خلال انتفاضة الأقصى وبخاصة في الحرب الأخيرة من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي على قطاع غزة بتاريخ 27/12/2008 م، ويعتبر حي الزيتون أحد أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، حيث يقطنه أكثر من 100 ألف نسمة.\nحي الدرج: وكان يسمى سابقاً «حي بني عامر» نسبة لقبيلة بني عامر العربية التي سكنته مع بداية الفتح الإسلامي ثم حي«البرجلية» نسبة للمحاربين المدافعين عن أبراج المدينة في العصر المملوكي.\nحي الصبرة: من أحياء غزة القديمة نسبيًا ويقع بعد شارع الثلاثيني.\nحي الشيخ رضوان: يمتد من الشارع الأول إلى الشارع الثالث شمالاً ومن شارع النصر غرباً ومن قرية جباليا النزلة شرقاً ويقع الحي على بعد 3 كيلومتر (1.9 ميل) شمال البلدة القديمة.\nحي تل الهوى: وهو أحد الأحياء الجديدة وبرزت فيه العمارة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية إلى غزة حيث أقيمت أغلب المؤسسات الحكومية في هذا الحي، وعند قدوم حكومة حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس عن طريق الانتخابات قامت بتسميته بتل الإسلام، لكن لم تنجح في ذلك، وبقي الناس ينادوه بتل الهوى.\nحي الشيخ عجلين: هو حي يقع في جنوب مدينة غزة بالقرب من الطريق الساحلي. في 18 نوفمبر 2002، هاجمت قوات الدفاع الإسرائيلية الحي، ودمّرت مكاتب جهاز الأمن الوقائي التابع للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nحي الدرج\nالمخيمات\n\nمخيم جباليا: يقع شمال مدينة غزة ويعتبر أكبر المخيمات ولكنه يتبع لمحافظة شمال غزة وليس لمحافظة غزة.\nمخيم الشاطئ: يقع غرب المدينة مقابلاً للساحل.\nمخيم النصيرات: يقع على بعد 8 كم جنوب مدينة غزة وعلى بعد 6 كم شمال بلدة دير البلح ويقع المخيم في وسط قطاع غزة\n\nالمناخ\nتمتاز غزة بمناخ متوسطي وشتاء معتدل جاف، والصيف حار ساخن. يبدأ فصل الربيع في شهر مارس أبريل وأكثر الشهور حرارة يوليو وأغسطس. أما متوسط ارتفاع درجات الحرارة يبلغ 33 سلسيوس (91 درجة فهرنهايت). ويعد شهر يناير أبرد شهور السنة متوسط الدرجات الحرارة المنخفضة يبلغ 7 سلسيوس (45 درجة فهرنهايت). الأمطار شحيحة وتهطل بين شهري نوفمبر ومارس، ويبلغ معدل الأمطار السنوية قرابة (116 ملم). وتهب الرياح على المدينة من الناحية الجنوبية الغربية. يصل أعلى معدل لسرعة الرياح في الشتاء إلى 60 كم في الساعة (نحو 7.3 عقدة/ساعة)، وأعلى سرعة للرياح في كامل السنة هي في شهر يناير بنحو 7.6 عقدة/ساعة، وقد ترجع هذه السرعة إلى مرور المنخفضات الجوية التي عادة ما تصاحبها رياح شديدة. تبلغ سرعة الرياح أدنى معدلاتها في فصل الصيف، فيبلغ المتوسط الفصلي حوالي 5 عقدة/ساعة، وينخفض متوسط سرعة الرياح في فصل الربيع عما هو في فصل الشتاء ليبلغ 6.7 عقدة/ساعة، وتقل سرعة الرياح في الخريف عن فصل الشتاء والربيع بينما تزيد عن فصل الصيف إذ تبلغ 5.6 عقدة/ساعة.\n\nالسكان\nوفقا للإحصاءات العثمانية في عام 1557، كان عدد الذكور 2477. حسب الإحصائيات عام 1596 أظهرت أن عدد المسلمين كان كالتالي (456 أسرة، 115 عزاب، 59 شخص ديني و19 شخص من ذو الاحتياجات الخاصة). أضف إلى أعداد المسلمين، كان عدد الجنود العثمانيون 119 جندي. أما المسيحين كان عدد الأسر 294 أسرة و7 أشخاص عزاب، بينما كان عدد الأسر اليهودية ما يقارب 73 أسرة و8 أسر من السامريون. في المجموع، بلغ عدد سكان غزة 6,000 نسمة وكانت في المركز الثالث كبراً من حيث عدد السكان في فلسطين العثمانية بعد القدس وصفد.\nفي عام 1838، كان عدد المسلمين 4,000 نسمة و 100 من المسيحيين (دافعين للضرائب مقابل حمايتهم) وبالتالي بلغ عدد السكان النهائي 15,000 أو 16,000 نسمة وأصبحت أكبر من القدس من حيث عدد السكان في ذلك الوقت. العدد الكامل للأسر المسيحية بلغ 57 أسرة. قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى بلغ عدد سكان غزة حوالي 42,000 نسمة، وأدى القتال ما بين القوات العثمانية والألمانية وقوات التحالف إلى انخفاض أعداد سكان غزة.\nحسب الإحصائيات عام 1997، من قبل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني بلغ عدد سكان غزة مع مخيم الشاطئ 353,115 منهم 50,9% ذكور و49,1% إناث. تمتاز غزة بكثرة الشباب بنسبة 60,8% وتتراوح أعمارهم ما بين (0-19 سنة). 28,8% من السكان تتراوح أعمارهم (20-44 سنة)، 7,7% ما بين (45-64 سنة)، وبلغت نسبة الذين تجاوزت أعمارهم 64 عام 3,9%.\nبلغ عدد سكان غزة 590,400 نسمة. سكان مدينة غزة وفلسطين عامة ينحدرون من أصول سامية، وكجميع سكان البحر الأبيض المتوسط لهم ملامح عربية سمراء ومتنوعة لا تخلو من تأثيرات متوسطية.\nفي سنتي 2023 و2024 مارست قوت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي قصفا مباشرا على السكان المدنيين حيث قتلت ما يزيد عن 40 ألف فلسطيني جلهم نساء وأطفال من سكان غزة\n\nالدين\nينتمي معظم سكان غزة إلى الدين الإسلامي السني. عندما كانت غزة تتبع الدولة الفاطمية، كان الشيعة مسيطرين على غزة، ولكن بعدما استرجعها القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي رقي بالنهج السني بصرامة دينية وتعليمية، مما كان له دور في توحيد جنوده العربي والترك.\nتوجد أقلية صغيرة من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين حوالي 3,500 نسمة تعيش في المدينة. وغالبية من المسيحيين تعيش في غزة في حي الزيتون في المدينة القديمة، وينتمون إلى الأرثوذكسية الشرقية من القدس، والروم الكاثوليك، والطوائف المعمدانية. في عام 1906، لم يكن هناك سوى 750 مسيحي، منهم 700 شخص يتبعون الأرثوذكسية و50 يتبعون الكنيسة الرومانية الكاثوليكية.\nاستوطن اليهود غزة منذ زمن،  في أسرة يهودية تعيش في غزة  غادر معظمهم من قطاع غزة بعد الثورة الفلسطينية 1929، حينما تكون مجتمعهم من خمسين أسرة. في إحصائيات سامي هداوي للأراضي والسكان، كان عدد سكان غزة 34,250 نسمة، في عام 1945. غادر معظمهم من المدينة بعد حرب عام 1948، وذلك بسبب انعدام الثقة المتبادلة بينهم وبين الأغلبية العربية.\nتحتوي غزة على العديد من مباني العبادة القديمة من أبرزها الجامع العمري، كنيسة القديس برفيريوس ومسجد السيد هاشم حيث يرقد قبر جد الرسول محمد.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت المدينة ولا زالت مركزًا مُهمًا من حيث موقعها الإستراتيجي بين القارتين الآسيوية والإفريقية ووقوعها على شاطئ البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذي يجعل منها ميناء مهما للتجارة وأعمال الصيد، ولكن صعوبة نقل البضائع عبر المعابر مع إسرائيل وعدم سلاسة النقل مع مصر يجعل حجم التبادل التجاري ضئيلًا مع الحجم المفترض بسبب الموقع الجغرافي. نما الاقتصاد في غزة بنسبة 8% في الأشهر ال 11 الأولى من عام 2010، وبنسبة 5.4% في عام 2009، والنشاط الاقتصادي مدعوم إلى حد كبير من خلال التبرعات والمساعدات الخارجية، والذي يعتبر السبب الرئيسي وراء النمو الذي حدث مؤخرا. غزة مثلها كمثل أي مدينة فلسطينية لا تملك عملة وطنية، ويُستخدم الدينار الأردني والدولار الأمريكي والشيكل الإسرائيلي. ويبلغ معدل الناتج المحلي للفرد 1,763 دولار أمريكي (طبـقًا لإحصائية 1997).\nبعد إتفاق أوسلو، تم توظيف الآلاف من السكان في مختلف الوزارات والأجهزة الأمنية، في حين قامت وكالة الغوث والمنظمات الدولية المختلفة التي تدعم تطوير المدينة بتوظيف آخرين.\nيوجد في غزة نقص خطير في مجال الإسكان والمرافق التعليمية والمرافق الصحية والبنية التحتية وعدم كفاية نظام الصرف الصحي، وقد ساهمت كل منها بتهديد النظافة وإنشاء مشاكل في الصحة العامة. هُناك عدد من الفنادق في غزة، مثل فندق فلسطين والقصر الكبير وآدم والأمل والقدس وكليف والديرة وبيت مارنا. تقع الفنادق على طول حي الرمال باستثناء فندق فلسطين. لدى الأمم المتحدة نادي الشاطئ في الشارع نفسه. غزة ليست مقصد للسُياح، مُعظم الأجانب يقيمون في الفنادق وهم صحفيين وعمال الإغاثة والأمم المتحدة والعاملين في الصليب الأحمر. الفنادق الراقية تشمل فندق القدس والديرة.\nووفقًا لتقرير صدر مؤخرًا عن منظمة أوكسفام، تبلغ نسبة البطالة في غزة ما يقارب 40% ومن المُتوقع أن تصل إلى 50%. وقد دُمر القطاع الخاص الذي يؤمن بدوره 53% من جميع الوظائف في غزة، وقد أفلست الشركات، بالإضافة إلى أن 75,000 عامل من أصل 110,000 هم الآن من دون وظيفة. في عام 2008، تم تعليق 95% من العمليات الصناعية في غزة بسبب عدم وجود المواد الخام للإنتاج وعدم القُدرة على تصدير ما يُنتج. في يونيو 2005، بلغ عدد المصانع في غزة 3,900 مصنع التي تُوظف 35,000 شخص، ولكن بحلول ديسمبر 2007، لم يبقَ سوى 195 مصنعًا التي تُوظف 1,700 شخص. أُصيبت صناعة البناء والتشييد بالشلل مع عشرات الآلاف من العاطلين عن العمل. كما أُصيب القطاع الزراعي بأضرارًا جسيمة وقرابة 40,000 عاملًا لا يحصلون على أي دخل وكانوا يعتمدون على الزراعة كمحصول نقدي.\nفي أغسطس 2009، وعدت حماس كل عامل ب100 دولار في شهر رمضان الكريم. أدى زيادة الازدهار نوعًا ما إلى استبدال واسع للعربات التي تجرها الحمير بالتوك توك. ووفقًا لصندوق النقد الدولي، انخفض معدل البطالة ونما الاقتصاد بنسبة 16% في النصف الأول من عام 2010، تقريبًا ضعف سرعة نمو الاقتصاد في الضفة الغربية.\n الزراعة \n\nاشتهرت غزة قديماً بزراعة محاصيل القمح والشعير والقطن والزيتون. وتصديرها إلى العالم العربي والخارجي، وفي غزة الآن العديد من المزروعات وهي: البطاطا، والطماطم، والخيار، والعنب، والفراولة، والتين، والبطيخ، والشمام. وانتشرت فيها البيارات التي تزرع فيها أجود أنواع الحمضيات كالليمون والبرتقال، والتي يعتمد البعض عليها في تغذية النحل.\nويعتمد الري في مدينة غزة على مياه الآبار، ويجري حالياً دراسات لتحلية مياه البحر تقوم بها البلديات في قطاع غزة. كما يعتمد الاقتصاد في غزة بدرجة كبيرة على زراعة وتصدير الأزهار إلى مختلف دول العالم.\nويربي بعض سكان القطاع حالياً الأغنام والماشية، ويعتمدون عليها في تسيير أمور حياتهم، والتي تسهم كذلك في بعض الصناعات المحلية الخفيفة؛ فقد ساهمت بلدية غزة بإنشاء مسلخ حديث ومتطور يتبع أحدث القوانين الصحية والعملية ويعمل أوتوماتيكياً حسب أحدث النظم والأساليب في العالم، ويعتبر من أكثر المسالخ تطوراً في الشرق الأوسط.\n الصناعة \nتشتهر غزة بصناعة عصر الزيتون والصابون الذي يعتمد على الزيت كمادة أولية كما تعتبر صناعة الفخار من أقدم الصناعات الفلسطينية التي اشتهرت بها المدينة والتي تُباع في شوارع أسواق غزة، وكذلك صناعة الغزل والتطريز والبسط التراثية من صوف الماشية والنسيج والملابس القطنية والأثاث المصنوع من الخيزران وصناعة الزجاج الملون كذلك. فقد تم إنشاء قرية الفنون والحرف التي بُنِيَت من الطين على الطراز المعماري القديم، ويمارس عد من الحرفيين الصناعة التقليدية في تلك القرية. وافتُتَح مول غزة الحديث في يوليو 2010.\n\nالسياحة\nتعتمد السياحة في غزة بشكل رئيسي على البحر الذي تشتهر شواطئه برمالها الذهبية البراقة. كما وتعتمد السياحة كذلك على المواقع الأثرية التاريخية المنتشرة في غزة. وتشتهر غزة كذلك بجوها المعتدل صيفاً وشتاءً والذي يشجع الناس بدوره، على ارتياد الشواطئ والحدائق والمنتزهات وعلى قضاء أوقاتهم في المزارع والبيارات وفي المرافق السياحية.\nتضم غزة العديد من الآثار منها الرومانية والمسيحية، وتتنوع الآثار الإسلامية بين المساجد والمدارس والزوايا والأسواق والقيساريات والأسبلة والحمامات والقصور التي تجلت فيها روعة العمارة والفنون الإسلامية، علاوة على مكتبة مهمة احتوت على عديد من المخطوطات.\nإن أقدم المواقع الأثرية بغزة تل العجول بجنوب المدينة على الضفة الشمالية لوادى غزة، وكان على هذا الموقع مدينة بيت جلايم الكنعانية، ويعتقد أن موقع مدينة غزة القديمة كانت على هذا التل منذ 2000 ق.م. وتضم غزة آثاراً مسيحية مثل دير القديس هيلاريون الذي يعتبر مؤسس حياة الرهبنة في فلسطين وكنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس بحى الزيتون الذي يعود تاريخها إلى بداية القرن الخامس الميلادي وآثاراً إسلامية متنوعة منها المساجد الأثرية كمسجد السيد هاشم الذي يقع بحى الدرج بالمنطقة الشمالية الذي يعود للعصر المملوكي، وجدده السلطان عبد الحميد سنة 1850 م. وتحوى غزة زوايا كالزاوية الأحمدية بحي الدرج، علاوة على المنشآت الأثرية المدنية كالأسواق مثل سوق القيسارية بحى الدرج، وهو ملاصق للجدار الجنوبي للجامع العمرى الكبير، ويعود بناء السوق إلى العصر المملوكي، ويتكون من شارع مغطى بقبو مدبب، وعلى جانبي هذا الشارع حوانيت صغيرة مغطاة بأقبية متقاطعة يطلق عليه سوق القيسارية أو سوق الذهب نسبة إلى تجارة الذهب فيه، والقصور مثل قصر الباشا بحي الدرج المكون من طابقين، ويعود للعصر المملوكي وكان مقراً لنائب غزة في العصرين المملوكي والعثماني، والحمامات كحمام السمرة بحي الزيتون، وهو أحد النماذج الرائعة الباقية للحمامات العثمانية في فلسطين والحمام الوحيد الباقي لغاية الآن في مدينة غزة.\nوكذلك تل الرقيش الذي اكتُشف فيه مستعمرة تعود للعهد الفينيقي في هذا التل تحيطها أسوار دفاعية ضخمة ويبلغ طولها حوالي (1600م).\n\nالثقافة\nالأزياء والتطريز \nتعتبر غزة الموطن الأصلي الشاش، القماش من أجل «ثوب غزة» يتم نسجه بالقرب من المجدل (عسقلان). القطن الأسود أو الأزرق أو المقلمة باللونان الزهري والأخضر، والتي تم تصنيعها في المجدل استمرت بالانتشار في باقي مناطق قطاع غزة من قبل اللاجئين من قرى السهل الساحلي حتى التسعينيات. يتميز الثوب الغزاوي بأكمام ضيقة ومستقيمة. وكان التطريز أقل كثافة من تلك المطبقة في الخليل. ومن الزخرفيات تشمل: مقص، مشط وحجاب والتي رتبت في كثير من الأحيان في مجموعات ثلاثية أو خماسية أو سباعية. ويعتبر استخدام الأرقام الفردية في الفولكلور العربي أن يكون فعالا ضد العين الحسود.\n المطبخ \nوقد تأثر المطبخ في قطاع غزة بالأكلات المجاورة حيث تأثرت بمصر بفضل موقعها على ساحل البحر المتوسط. الغذاء الرئيسي للغالبية العظمى من سكان في المنطقة هو السمك. الصناعة الرئيسية بغزة هي صيد الأسماك إما ان تكون مشوية أو مقلية، وتتسم الأطعمة هناك بإضافة الثوم والفلفل الأحمر والكمون ويتم نقعه في مزيج من الكزبرة، الفلفل الأحمر، كمون، ثوم مفروم والليمون. التأثير المصري يظهر أيضا على جانب الاستخدام المُتكرر للفلفل الحار والثوم والشوندرة نكهة لكثير من وجبات الطعام من قطاع غزة. الطبق الوطني لمنطقة غزة هو سماكية.\nالمراكز الثقافية والمتاحف\n\nتوجد في غزة عدة مراكز ثقافية منها مركز رشاد الشوا. تم الانتهاء من بناء مركز رشاد الشوا الثقافي في عام 1988 وأطلق عليه اسم مؤسسه الأمين السابق للمدينة ويقع في حي الرمال. البناء مكون من طابقان على شكل مثلث وتؤدي المراكز الثقافية ثلاثة وظائف رئيسية: مكان للتجمعات الكبيرة خلال المهرجانات السنوية ومكان لتنظيم المعارض ومكتبة. المركز الثقافي الفرنسي هو رمز للتعاون والشراكة في قطاع غزة. تقدم المعارض الفنية والحفلات الموسيقية وعروض الأفلام وغيرها من الأنشطة. ويقدم دعوات للفنانين الفرنسيين لعرض أعمالهم الفنية كلما أمكن ذلك، ويقدم دعوات أيضًا إلى الفنانين الفلسطينيين من قطاع غزة والضفة الغربية للمشاركة في المسابقات الفنية.\nأنشئت في عام 1998 قرية الفنون والحرف وهي مركز ثقافي للأطفال التي تهدف إلى التشجيع الشامل والمنتظم للفن الإبداعي في جميع أشكاله. وتفاعل المركز مع فئة واسعة من الفنانين من جنسيات مختلفة، ونظم قرابة 100 معرض للفن الإبداعي، والسيراميك، والرسومات، والمنحوتات وغيرها. وقد استفاد ما يقرب 10,000 طفل من مختلف أنحاء قطاع غزة من قرية الفنون والحرف.\n\nالرياضة\nيقع ملعب فلسطين «الاستاد الوطني الفلسطيني»، في غزة ولديه القدرة على استيعاب 10,000 شخصًا. وهو بمثابة موطن للمنتخب الفلسطيني لكرة القدم، ولكن بعد غارة جوية إسرائيلية تضرر بشدة ميدان الملعب، وقد لعبت مبارياته في الدوحة، قطر. تملك غزة الكثير من الأندية الرياضية والتي تشارك في دوري قطاع غزة. وتشمل خدمات الشاطئ (مخيم الشاطئ)، اتحاد الشجاعية، نادي غزة الرياضي ونادي الزيتون.\n\nالتعليم\nوفقًا للإحصاء الفلسطيني في عام 1997، كان أكثر من 90% من سكان غزة الذين تزيد أعمارهم على 10 يجيدون القراءة والكتابة. من سكان المدينة، كانوا 140,848 مسجلين في المدارس (39.8% في المدارس الابتدائية، 33.8% في المدارس الثانوية، و 26.4% في المدارس الثانوية العامة). تلقى نحو 11,134 شخص شهادات البكالوريوس أو الماجستير والدكتوراه.\nفي عام 2006، كان عدد المدارس في غزة 210، وتم تشغيل وبناء 151 منها من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية، و 46 من قبل وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين في الشرق الأدنى، و 13 مدرسة خاصة. التحق ما مجموعه 154,251 طالب وكانوا 5,877 يعملون مدرسين. أثر الاقتصاد المضطهد في الوقت الحالي في قطاع غزة. في سبتمبر 2007، كشف استطلاع للأونروا في قطاع غزة، أن الفشل ينتشر بنسبة 80% من الصف الرابع إلى التاسع، وتصل نسبة الفشل في مادة الرياضيات إلى 90%. في يناير 2008، أفادت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (يونيسف) أن المدارس في غزة قامت بإلغاء الفئات التي كانت عالية في استهلاك الطاقة، مثل تكنولوجيا المعلومات، ومختبرات العلوم والأنشطة اللاصفية.\nيوجد في مدينة غزة عدة جامعات وهي: الجامعة الإسلامية-غزة، جامعة الأزهر-غزة، جامعة الأقصى-غزة (كلية التربية سابقا)، جامعة فلسطين وجامعة الأمة وجامعة القدس المفتوحة وهي تعتمد نظام التعليم المفتوح وتضم حوالي 40,000 طالباً. تأسست الجامعة الإسلامية، التي تتألف من عشرة كليات، من قبل أحمد ياسين ومجموعة من رجال الأعمال في عام 1978، مما يجعلها أول مؤسسة للتعليم العالي في قطاع غزة. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 20,021 طالب وطالبة. جامعة الأزهر في غزة والتي تأسست عام 1991، وتأسست جامعة الأقصى في عام 1991. بدأت جامعة القدس المفتوحة تعليمها في مبنى مستأجر في وسط المدينة وكان ذلك عام 1992 وكان عدد الملتحقين بها 730 طالب وطالبة. بسبب الزيادة السريعة في عدد الطلاب، تم تشيد أول مبنى جامعي في منطقة ناصر. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 3,778 طالب.\nوتقع المكتبة العامة في قطاع غزة قبالة شارع الوحدة، وتحتوي على ما يقارب 10,000 كتابًا في العربية والإنكليزية والفرنسية. ويبلغ مجموع مساحتها حوالي 1410 متر مربع (15,200 قدم مربعة)، ويتكون المبنى من دورين وسرداب. افتتحت المكتبة في عام 1999، بعد تعاون رئيس بلدية غزة عون الشوا وبلدية دونكيرك، والبنك الدولي. الأهداف الرئيسية للمكتبة تتمثل بتوفير مصادر المعلومات لتلبية احتياجات المستفيدين، وتوفير التسهيلات اللازمة من أجل الوصول إلى مصادر المعلومات المتاحة، وتنظيم برامج ثقافية متنوعة مثل النشاطات الثقافية والندوات والمحاضرات والعروض السينمائية والفيديو والفن ومعارض للكتب. وكذلك يوجد بها العديد من المراكز المهنية والتدريبية التابعة لوزارة التعليم العالي ووكالة الغوث.\n\nمشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة\nهناك العديد من المشاكل التي تواجه التعليم في قطاع غزة متمثلة في الاتي:\n- الاكتظاظ الطلابي الكبير في الفصول الدراسية نتيجة لازدياد عدد الطلاب وقلة عدد المدارس. حيث أدت الحروب المتتالية الي تدمير المدارس، وادي الحصار الخانق الي صعوبة إعادة اعمارها\n- تعتبر المعابر من المشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة. حيث استمرار اغلاق المعابر لفترات طويلة يؤدي الي صعوبة التنقل للخارج واستكمال الدراسة\n- من المشاكل الأخرى التي تؤثر سلبا على التعليم مشكلة التيار الكهربائي. حيث ادي الانقطاع المستمر للتيار الكهربائي بمعدل 8 ساعات يوميا الي صعوبة مواكبة الطلاب دراستهم وواجباتهم اليومية.\n\nالمعالم\nالبنية التحتية\nالخدمات\nإمدادات المياه والصرف الصحي\nووفقًا لتعداد المكتب المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني عام 1997، فقد كان 98,1% من سكان غزة يملُكون إمدادات المياه العامة في حين أن البقية يستخدمون النظام الخاص. تم ربط حوالي 87.6% إلى نظام الصرف الصحي العام و 11.8% يستخدمون البالوعة.\nبسبب القيود الشديدة التي فُرضت على إمدادات المياه في غزة، ونظام الصرف بها. لم تعد تعمل الآبار الستة الرئيسية لمياه الشرب، وحوالي 50% من السكان لا يحصُلون على المياه بشكل منتظم. يتسرب يوميًا حوالي 20 مليون لتر من مياه الصرف الصحي الخام و40 مليون لتر من المياه المعالجة جُزئيًا في البحر الأبيض المتوسط نظرًا لقطع الكهرباء وعدم وجود الوقود وقطع الغيار في محطات المعالجة في قطاع غزة. وتزعم البلدية أن تراكم القمامة في الشوارع والطرق وفي الآبار، وفيضانات مياه الصرف الصحي في تتسبب خطر تفشي الأمراض والأوبئة الحشرية، وكذلك الفئران وفي المناطق السكنية.\nالرعاية الصحية\n\nتوجد في المدنية عدة مشافي منها مستشفى القدس، والذي يقع في حي تل الهوى، ويديرُه جمعية الهلال الأحمر الفلسطيني، ويعد ثاني أكبر مستشفى في غزة.\nونتيجة القيود الصارمة على الوقود والكهرباء؛ تُعاني المستشفيات حاليًا من انقطاع التيار الكهربائي الدائم الذي يصل إلى 8-12 ساعة يوميًا. يُوجد حاليًا نقص 60-70 في المئة في وقود الديزل اللازم لمولدات الكهرباء التي أُبلغ عنها. ووفقًا لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، تم رفض تصاريح مغادرة 18.5% من المرضى الذين قدموا تصاريح لكي يتلقوا العلاج الطارئ في المستشفيات خارج قطاع غزة في عام 2007.\nالنقل والمواصلات\n\nيمتد شارع رشيد الساحلي والذي يمتد على طول ساحل غزة ويربطها مع بقية الساحل الشمالي في قطاع غزة ومع جنوبه. الطريق الرئيسي في قطاع غزة، هو شارع صلاح الدين (فيا ماريس الحديثة) والذي يمر عبر وسط مدينة غزة، والذي يربط بدوره دير البلح وخان يونس ورفح في جنوب القطاع وجباليا وبيت حانون في شمال قطاع غزة. المعبر الشمالي من شارع صلاح الدين في إسرائيل هو معبر بيت حانون ومعبر من مصر هو معبر رفح. وقد تم إغلاق المعابر من قبل إسرائيل ومصر منذ عام 2007، ولكن بعد الثورة المصرية قد تم إعادة فتح معبر رفح ولن دون تغيرات تذكر.\nيعتبر شارع عمر المختار الشارع الرئيسي في مدينة غزة للتنقل من الشرق إلى الغرب وبالعكس، وهو فرع من شارع صلاح الدين، والذي يمتد من ساحل الرمال في المدينة القديمة وينتهي في سوق الذهب. وقبل الحصار المفروض على قطاع غزة، كان هناك خطوط منتظمة لسيارات الأجرة نحو مدينتان رام الله، القدس والخليل في الضفة الغربية.\nمطار ياسر عرفات الدولي والذي تم افتتاحه عام 1998 بالقرب من مدينة رفح، ويقع على بعد 40 كم (25 ميل) جنوب قطاع غزة. تضررت المدارجات والمنشآت التابعة للمطار إلى حد كبير خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية على يد الجيش الإسرائيلي وهو معطل عن العمل حالياً. يقع مطار بن غوريون الدولي في إسرائيل على بعد 75 كم (47 ميل) شمال شرق المدينة.، وبطبيعة الحال لا يمكن استخدامه من قبل المواطنين الفلسطينيين.\n\nمعاناة المدينة\nالحصار\n\nتقوم السلطات الإسرائيلية بحصار قطاع غزة وبالتالي المدينة حصاراً كاملاً حيث تمنع السفر من وإلى غزة وتمنع عنها مواد البناء والمواد التموينية والأدوية والمحروقات بأنواعها، وقد دمر هذا الحصار الاقتصاد الغزاوي بشكل شبه كامل. وفي أوائل سنة 2009 بدأت إسرائيل في ضرب قطاع غزة كاملاً. وقد زعمت إسرائيل بأن حماس تهدد أمنها وسكانها.\nولكن الشعب الفلسطيني ولم يستسلم وإنما بادر بشق الأنفاق عند حدود الأراضي المصرية، وساعدت هذه الأنفاق بدخول جميع مستلزمات الحياة من مواد غذائية ومواد بناء وأسلحة وأجهزة كهربائية والسيارات. وبعد عام من شن إسرائيل الحرب على غزة قاموا بعقد عدة اتفاقيات وتهدئات ساهمت بتهدئة الوضع في قطاع غزة وفتح معبر رفح والسماح للمُسافرين بالدخول والخروج من المدينة ولكن بتنسيق من حُكومة حماس المُقالة والسلطة المصرية.\nما زال المواطن الفلسطيني يعاني من أزمة الغلاء المعيشي بالإضافة للمعونات التي تقدم للمواطنين فهي تقدم فقط لعائلات معينة وليس للجميع. ومع ذلك فإن سكان قطاع غزة يعيشون في نعيم أكثر من الضفة الغربية باستثناء تواصل انقطاع التيار الكهربائي بحجة عدم وجود الوقود.\nمجزرة غزة\n\nمجزرة غزة أو محرقة غزة هي عملية إسرائيلية جرت في قطاع غزة على مدار خمسة أيام في شهر فبراير 2008 بدعوى القضاء على عناصر حركة حماس المطلقة للصواريخ على الأراضي الإسرائيلية. وقد جاءت هذه التسمية بعد أن وصف وزير الدفاع الإسرائيلي إيهود باراك ما تفعله القوات الإسرائيلية في غزة بهولوكوست أو إبادة عرقية أو محرقة للفلسطينيين في قطاع غزة إثر مقتل جنديين إسرائيليين على يد عناصر من حركة حماس أثناء مقاوماتها للقوات الإسرائيلية؛ فتبنى التسمية عدد كبير من الكتاب والمفكرين والشخصيات السياسية والدينية العرب والمسلمين، حيث يرونها اسم مناسب للعملية، حيث راح ضحيتها 116 شخص من ضمنهم 26 طفلاً فضلاً عن غيرهم من المدنيين ما بين قتيل وجريح. وفي نفس اليوم الذي أعلنت فيه انتهاء العمليات العسكرية في غزة؛ أعلنت مصادر إسرائيلية أنها كانت مرحلة أولى، وأنه قد تكون هناك عمليات أخرى في القريب.\nالعدوان شنته قوات الاحتلال منذ يوم 27 ديسمبر 2008 على قطاع غزة. وقد ذهب ضحية لهذا العدوان حتى اليوم العشرون ما يزيد على 5,000 مدني شهيد اكثرهم من النساء والأطفال وما يقارب الـ 8,000 جريح من المدنيين، ومعظم الجرحى أصبحوا عاجزين أما أهل غزة فقد ظلوا صابرين يواجهون أكبر ترسانة عسكرية بصُدور عارية وقُلوب ثابتة في مواجهة 10,000 طن من القنابل ألقُيت عليهم ومنها قنابل محرمة دوليًا.\nوقد شهدت فترة العدوان أكبر انتفاضة عالمية ضد المجزرة التي ترتكبها إسرائيل ضد أطفال ونساء وعجائز غزة، حيث عرضت وسائل الاعلام صوراً بشعة من غزة هزت العالم فنزلت الشعوب بمئات الألوف تبكي في الشوارع وتطالب بالتحرك لوقف العدوان والجرائم والمحارق والقنابل الإسرائيلية، وأصبحت غزة مدينة عالمية ورمزاً فلسطينياً كبيراً. وقام بعض الفنانين العربيين والعالميين بإبداء دعمهم وتأييدهم لنضال الغزاويين ومواساتهم في كارثتهم. ومنهم أول مغني أمريكي يغني لغزة وهو مايكل هارت.\nوقد أعلن المسؤولون الإسرائيليون امتداد العمليات العسكرية «حسب الحاجة»، في الوقت الذي ما زالت فيه الدول العربية تتجادل فيما بينها علي ضرورة عقد قمة عربية طارئة. علمًا بأن قطر نادت بعقد قمه عربية مُنذ بداية العدوان الإسرائيلي على غزه لمُناصرة الشعب فيها.\nوجاء هذا مصاحبا لمجهودات دولية تندد بالهجمات بوصفها هجمات همجية ووحشية وغير إنسانية البتة وقد قامت مظاهرات غاضبة في بلدان العالم تندد بالمجزرة. وبعد مرور 22 يوماً توقفت الحرب وانسحبت قوات الصهاينة مهزومة لأنها لم تحقق أهدافها. وخلفت وراءها أكثر من 5000 شهيد وأكثر من 8000 جريح وأكثر من 20000 منزل مدمر.\nالجدار الفولاذي\n\nفي ديسمبر 2009، أعلنت مصر عزمها بناء الجدار الفولاذي تحت الأرض بين رفح المصرية وقطاع غزة يصل إلى عمق 30 مترًا وطول 10 كم، من أجل وقف تسلل الفلسطينيين وتهريب السلاح إلى الأراضي المصرية، ووقف تهريب البضائع المصرية بمُختلف أنواعها للأراضي المحتلة.\nحيث أن الهدف من إنشاء هذا الجدار العازل هو القضاء على الأنفاق التي تصل بين مصر وقطاع غزة، وحيث أن هذه الإنفاق هي المدخل الوحيد الآن لكل احتياجات الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزة بعد أن فرضت مصر الحصار على معبر رفح وهو المنفذ الوحيد لغزة على العالم، وضيقت الخناق على أهل غزة، وهناك قضية مرفوعة الآن في مصر ضد قانونية هذا الجدار.\n\nالحكومة\nاليوم، تُعد غزة العاصمة الإدارية لمحافظة غزة. وتحتوي على مبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لمعظم وزارات السلطة الفلسطينية.\nتم تشكيل أول مجلس بلدي في غزة عام 1893 برئاسة علي خليل الشوا. قامت السلطات العثمانية بتعيين أبنه سعيد الشوا عام 1906 عمدة للمدينة. أشرف الشوا على بناء أول مستشفى في غزة وعدة مساجد ومدارس وترميم الجامع الكبير وإدخال المحراث الحديث للمدينة.\n\nفي 24 يوليو 1994، أعلنت السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في غزة وتم تأسيس مجلس المدينة الأول في الأراضي الفلسطينية. لم تعقد الانتخابات البلدية الفلسطينية في غزة ولا في رفح أو في خان يونس. بدلاً من ذلك، اختارت حركة فتح مسؤولي الحزب في المدن الصغيرة والبلدات والقرى لإجراء الانتخابات مع افتراض أنهم سيفعلون ما هو أفضل في المناطق الأقل حضرية. مع ذلك، فازت حماس المنافسة بأغلبية المقاعد، إذ حصلت على سبعة من بين 10 بلديات تم اختيارها لأول جولة ووصلت نسبة الإقبال على التصويت إلى 80% تقريباً. شهد عام 2007 مواجهات عنيفة بين الطرفين خلّفت أكثر من 100 قتيل، مما أدى في نهاية المطاف إلى سيطرة حماس على المدينة.\nبشكل طبيعي، فإن البلديات الفلسطينية التي يزيد عدد سكانها عن 20,000 نسمة تكون بمثابة مراكز إدارية لها مجالس بلدية، ويتشكل المجلس البلدي الحالي في غزة من 11 عضواً، بينهم رئيس البلدية نزار حجازي.\n\nرؤساء البلدية\nالمدن المتوأمة\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\n\nموقع بلدية غزة\nمتحف شهداء محرقة غزة 2009",

          "content": "Gaza (en arabe : غَزَّة, Ġazza [/[ˈɣazza]]) est la principale ville de la bande de Gaza. Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe nom de Gaza découle de la racine cananéenne Ġazzā, la « forte » ou « forteresse ».\n\nHistoire\nGaza est attestée au XVe siècle av. J.-C. au temps des Cananéens. La ville fait alors partie de l'Égypte. Depuis, différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé, la ville étant régulièrement assiégée et prise.\n\nAntiquité\nLa première référence à la ville de Gaza remonte au règne du pharaon égyptien Thoutmôsis III (mort en 1425 av. J.-C.). La ville est également citée dans les lettres d'Amarna (sous la XVIIIe dynastie). Son intérêt principal réside dans sa position stratégique sur la route côtière reliant l'Égypte antique et la Syrie. C'est alors un marché important et un poste avancé égyptien faisant partie du « Chemin d'Horus » (série de forteresses réparties entre Tcharou et Gaza).\nDans les années 1190 avant J.-C., les Philistins, un des peuples de la mer (originaires de Crète selon une tradition biblique) s'installent sur la côte sud cananéenne (de Gaza à Jaffa), après avoir attaqué l'Égypte. Les Philistins laisseront leur nom bien plus tard à l'ensemble du territoire, que les Romains appelleront « Palestine ». La ville philistine d'environ quatre-vingts hectares, murée, est construite sur une colline à quarante-cinq mètres d'altitude, à 2,4 km de la mer Méditerranée. Gaza est mentionnée dans la Bible Hébraïque comme l'une des villes principales des Philistins en guerre contre Israël : c'est là que le juge Samson est capturé et qu'il meurt en faisant s'écrouler un temple philistin.\n\n \nEn 525 av. J.-C., la cité est conquise par Cambyse II, grand roi achéménide de l'Empire perse, pour servir de tête de pont à toutes ses campagnes vers l'Égypte. La ville est prise en 332 av. J.-C. par le Macédonien Alexandre le Grand à l'issue d'un siège. Les habitants sont massacrés ou réduits en esclavage.\n\nPuis, dans le contexte des guerres des Diadoques pour la succession d'Alexandre le Grand, la bataille de Gaza oppose en 312 av. J.-C. les Macédoniens Ptolémée Ier, satrape d'Égypte, à Démétrios Ier, fils du général Antigone le Borgne, maître de l'Asie. Victorieux, Ptolémée doit néanmoins rapidement abandonner ses conquêtes en Syrie et en Phénicie.\nEn 145 av. J.-C., Gaza est conquise par Jonathan Maccabée, frère de Juda Maccabée et fondateur de la dynastie judéenne des Hasmonéens.\n\nÉpoques romaine et byzantine\nEn 63 avant notre ère, Gaza devient une partie de la Judée en tant que province romaine.\nDe grandes mosaïques témoignent de la richesse artistique de cette époque. Le christianisme se répand et les premiers monastères apparaissent. Le port de Gaza exporte un vin blanc fameux local : le vinum Gazetum. \nLa synagogue de Gaza est construite en 508/509 dans le centre de la ville antique de Gaza, aujourd'hui le quartier de Rimal, où vivait la communauté juive de Gaza (du IIe siècle av. J.-C. jusqu'au milieu du XXe siècle).\nGaza est représentée sur la carte de Madaba, au VIe siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nLa ville est considérée comme le lieu où serait mort Hachim ibn Abd Manaf, l'arrière-grand-père de Mahomet au cours d'une expédition commerciale, d'où le surnom de la ville « la Gaza de Hashim », « Ghazzat Hashim ». Une mosquée en son nom s'y trouve, la Mosquée d’al-Sayyid Hashim (en), et sous les arcades serait présente sa tombe.\nLa conquête de Gaza par les Arabes intervient très tôt, sans doute en 634. Elle n'est pas évoquée par les sources arabes mais l'est par les sources byzantines : la population civile, alors non musulmane, doit payer tribut aux Arabes et la garnison, constituée de soixante soldats, est emprisonnée et mise à mort quelque temps plus tard. Sous les Omeyyades, une garnison militaire et un atelier monétaire sont implantés en ville. L'islamisation de la cité est progressive : c'est là que naît l'imam al-Chafii (fondateur de l'école de jurisprudence chafiite), mais ce n'est pas là qu'il vécut et enseigna.\nLa petite communauté juive — présente à Gaza depuis la période hellénistique et également dans la ville de Rafah — paye un impôt de protection, et les Dhimmis ne furent pas inquiétés.\n\nLa cité fait peu parler d'elle jusqu'au XIIe siècle et, au moment de la Croisade, elle a beaucoup décliné. Elle est en ruines et peut-être désertée quand les Croisés occupent le site en 1149 et y construisent un château fort dans la partie la plus élevée. Ce château est confié à la garde des Templiers. Au sud du château, se développe la ville franque avec une grande église gothique qui est aujourd'hui la grande mosquée de Gaza, al-Omari, construite pendant la période des Omeyyades au VIIIe siècle. Une autre église, Saint-Porphyre (orthodoxe), datant du XIIe siècle, plus petite, est considérée comme la plus ancienne de la ville encore active. Tenue par les Templiers, apparemment prospère si l'on en juge par la qualité de sa grande église, Gaza constitue l'avant-poste du Royaume franc de Jérusalem face à l'Égypte. Les sources franques la nomment Gazara, et en ancien français Gadres. Elle ne constitue pas un lieu de pèlerinage, et sa renommée en France ne vient que d'une chanson de geste composée vers 1170, Li Fuerre de Gadres (le sac de Gaza), évoquant la prise de la ville par Alexandre le Grand.\nÀ la fin de 1170, le sultan Saladin s'empare de la ville basse mais échoue à prendre le château. Ce n'est qu'en 1187, au lendemain de la bataille de Hattin, qu'il obtient l'évacuation de Gaza par les Templiers et la remise des forteresses de Gaza et de Darom (Deir el-Balah, au sud de Gaza). Le roi d'Angleterre Richard Cœur de Lion reprend Darom et Gaza en 1192, mais négocie ensuite avec Saladin l'abandon de ces positions jugées trop exposées, qu'il fait évacuer après en avoir détruit les fortifications.\nEn 1239, un retour offensif des Francs est brisé à Beit Hanoun, bourgade du nord de Gaza, dont la mosquée abrite les tombes des musulmans qui sont tués au cours de cette bataille. En 1244, a lieu à Hirbiyyah (en latin Furbia, en français « La Forbie ») une bataille bien plus importante opposant une coalition égypto-khowarizmienne et une coalition syro-franque : le roi Al-Salih Ismaël de Damas avait promis aux Templiers de leur restituer Gaza en cas de victoire, mais ils sont défaits. Gaza demeure au pouvoir des Ayyoubides d'Égypte, puis de Syrie, jusqu'en 1260 où la ville est occupée un temps par les Mongols avant d'être reprise par le chef mamelouk Baybars.\nDans les années 1480, des voyageurs indiquent que Gaza est la ville la plus importante de Palestine. Elle est habitée par des Éthiopiens, des Arabes, des Égyptiens, des Syriens, des Indiens, des Juifs (soixante-six familles), des Samaritains (quatre familles) et des chrétiens, plus de sept-mille hommes, au milieu de dix-mille chameaux. Seuls les Juifs y produisent le vin local.\nL'époque des Mamelouks (fin XIIIe - début XVIe siècle) fut pour Gaza une période prospère de renaissance, malgré des crises.\n\nTemps modernes\nLes Ottomans mettent fin au règne des Mamelouks en 1516 après la bataille de Khan Younès. La ville de Gaza et toute la région sont administrées pendant cinq siècles par la province ottomane d'Égypte jusqu'au début du XXe siècle.\nDans la seconde partie du XVIIe siècle, Gaza est décrite par des pèlerins et voyageurs. Elle est la capitale de la province de Palestine qu'un pacha gouverne. Elle n'est plus entourée de murs mais de monticules de pierres. Le turc, l'arabe et le grec sont les langues qui y sont parlées. Elle possède des bains somptueux et d'immenses bazars. La Grande mosquée est entourée de six mosquées et nombre d'oratoires. On y trouve également une église arménienne et une autre, grecque, ainsi qu'une synagogue et un bain rituel.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nPalestine mandataire\nAu tout début du XXe siècle, on dénombre environ quarante-mille habitants dont sept-cent-cinquante chrétiens et cent-soixante Juifs (majoritairement ashkénazes) vivant dans Gaza prospère et paisible.\n\nQuand éclate la Première Guerre mondiale, l'Empire ottoman s'engage aux côtés de son allié, l'Empire allemand. En novembre 1917, à l'issue de la troisième bataille de Gaza, les troupes britanniques, commandées par le général Allenby, s'emparent de la ville. Les Britanniques destituent le maire de Gaza, Saïd al-Shawwa, nommé par les Ottomans. La Déclaration Balfour se montre favorable à l’établissement d'un « un foyer national pour le peuple juif » en Palestine, en précisant que ce projet ne devra pas porter atteinte aux droits civils et religieux des communautés non juives présentes sur le territoire.\nEn 1922, la Société des Nations place la Palestine sous mandat britannique. C'est à partir de cette période que s'accroît l'immigration juive en provenance d’Europe de l’Est, particulièrement lors des persécutions nazies des années 1930.\n\nGuerre de 1948, Nakba et administration égyptienne\nGaza reste sous le mandat britannique jusqu'à l'évacuation des Britanniques en mai 1948, à la suite de la décision de partage de la Palestine du 29 novembre 1947. Le territoire est divisé en deux par une proposition de l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU), avec un État pour les Arabes (sur 42 % du territoire), un autre pour les Juifs (sur 56 % du territoire), et une zone neutre pour Jérusalem (2% du territoire). Cependant, quand Israël déclare son indépendance, le refus de cette solution par les Arabes entraîne une violente guerre en 1948, opposant Israël à ses voisins arabes.\n\nLors de la guerre de 1948, les Israéliens tentent d’empoisonner les puits avec le germe de la typhoïde, comme ils l’ont fait avec succès à Acre. Mais leur tentative, qui a lieu le 27 mai, est déjouée par la surveillance gazaouie et l’armée égyptienne. Gaza est aussi une des rares villes que les Israéliens bombardent durant cette guerre, « les Gazaouis ont la plus longue histoire de victimes de bombardements par Israël, de 1948 à nos jours ».\nÀ la fin du conflit, trois Arabes sur quatre au moins s’exilent ou sont expulsés (Nakba).\nDe 1948 à 1967, la bande de Gaza est administrée par l'Égypte. À la suite de la crise du canal de Suez, elle est occupée par Israël de novembre 1956 au 7 mars 1957. Outre quatre-mille prisonniers, cette occupation cause la mort de 930 à 1 200 Palestiniens arabes pour une population totale de 330 000 personnes.\n\nGuerre des Six Jours et occupation israélienne\nAprès la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967, la bande de Gaza est à nouveau occupée par Israël qui y implantent plusieurs colonies de peuplement juif.\nEntre 1976 et 1981, un mouvement issus des Frères musulmans égyptiens, le Hamas, crée à Gaza l'université islamique de Gaza et d'autres institutions islamiques (al-Mujamma al-islami, al-Jam'iyya al-islamiyya, etc.).\n\nLe 9 décembre 1987, c'est à Gaza que débute la première intifada, la « révolte des pierres », avant de s'étendre à l'ensemble des territoires occupés jusqu'en 1993, année des accords d'Oslo. « Intifada » est d'ailleurs le seul mot arabe qui intègre le vocabulaire de la politique mondiale au XXe siècle. À la suite d’un accident de circulation que les Arabes considèrent comme un acte intentionnel de la part du chauffeur israélien, des jeunes du camp de Jabalia se révoltent et lancent des pierres sur les forces d'autorité. Les artisans se rebellent aussi en ne se rendant pas au travail, et en fermant leur boutique.\nLe 4 mai 1994, l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine (OLP) obtient la gestion de Gaza et de la région de Jéricho. Le président Yasser Arafat et l'Autorité palestinienne s'installent à Gaza.\n\nRetrait israélien en 2005\nEn 2005, à la suite de la seconde intifada, le gouvernement israélien retire unilatéralement ses forces armées et ses colonies de la Bande de Gaza.Le 25 janvier 2006, le Hamas remporte les élections législatives palestiniennes de 2006. Ismaël Haniyeh est nommé Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne. La collaboration avec l'appareil politique mis en place par le Fatah est difficile.\nEn juin 2007, le Hamas prend le pouvoir à Gaza et chasse les tenants de l'Autorité palestinienne. Israël, qui avait gardé le contrôle des frontières, des eaux territoriales et de l'espace aérien, met en place un blocus de la Bande de Gaza.\n\nGuerre de 2023-2025\nEn octobre 2023, éclate la guerre à Gaza, lancée à la suite de l'incursion le 7 du même mois de commandos du Hamas en Israël depuis Gaza (opération dite « Déluge d'Al-Aqsa ») et le massacre de civils israéliens et étrangers, auxquels Israël répond pour officiellement éliminer le Hamas par des bombardements massifs notamment sur la ville de Gaza avec des milliers de civils gazaouis tués sous les bombes, le blocus intégral du territoire, un siège puis une attaque terrestre, l'ensemble entraînant une crise humanitaire alarmante. En juillet 2024, l'armée israélienne ordonne l'évacuation de toute la ville.\n\nLes écoles servant de lieux de refuge pour les déplacés sont régulièrement bombardées, accusées par Israël de cacher des centres de commandement et d'opérations militaires du Hamas, des terroristes ou des armes. Le 1er août 2024, au moins quinze personnes sont tuées lors d'une attaque israélienne contre l'école Dalal al-Mughrabi, tandis que le 3 août, seize autres personnes sont tuées lors du bombardement de l'école Hamama. Le 4 août, au moins trente personnes sont tuées dans des raids aériens israéliens sur les écoles Nassr et Hassan Salama, à l'ouest de la ville, et le 8 août, au moins dix-sept personnes sont tuées dans des attaques contre les écoles Abdul Fattah Hamouda et az-Zahra. Le 10 août, plus de cent personnes sont tuées et cent-cinquante autres blessées après que les forces israéliennes ont bombardé l'école al-Tabin, à l'est de la ville. Le 21 septembre, vingt-et-une personnes sont tuées lors d'une frappe israélienne sur l'école Al-Zaytoun abritant des déplacés, quand Israël précise que sa cible terroriste se trouvait « à l'intérieur » de l'école Al-Falah, adjacente aux bâtiments de l'école Al-Zaytoun.\n\nLa ville est en grande partie détruite par les bombardements. Selon l'International Crisis Group, la stratégie israélienne est de rendre Gaza invivable en obligeant la population à se déplacer constamment et en détruisant tout.\n\nSelon une enquête d'Amnesty International, les destructions sont injustifiées et contraires au droit international humanitaire. Un rapport de Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) dénonce la « campagne de destruction totale menée par Israël » et affirme les difficultés d'accès pour traiter les blessés.Pour certains chercheurs, les destructions planifiées et délibérées de quartiers entiers de Gaza s'apparente à un urbicide.\nLe 22 août 2025, à la suite du rapport de l'organisme indépendant IPC, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare l'état de famine dans la ville, en « raison de l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » dans l'acheminement des vivres. Responsables de l'approvisionnement alimentaire dans les zones sous occupation militaire selon le droit international, le gouvernement israélien réfute cette accusation, parlant de « préjugés antisémites » et de « mensonges ».\nAu 16 septembre 2025, la ville de Gaza est en grande partie dévastée par les bombardements israéliens avec, selon l'ONU, plus de 78 % des immeubles détruits, partiellement ou totalement, y compris les hôpitaux et les écoles.\n\nGéographie\nClimat\nGaza a un climat chaud, semi-aride ou méditerranéen (malgré de très rares précipitations) avec des hivers doux et secs, et des étés chauds. Les mois les plus chauds sont juillet et août, la température moyenne étant de 33 °C. Le mois le plus froid est janvier avec des températures généralement à 7 °C.\nLa pluie est rare et se situe généralement entre novembre et mars, avec des taux de précipitations annuelles d'environ 116 mm (4,57 pouces).\n\nÉducation\nGaza est une ville jeune : environ 60 % de la population de la ville serait constituée de personnes âgées de moins de 18 ans.\nEn 2006, il y avait 210 écoles à Gaza : 151 étaient gérées par le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne, 46 par l'Office de secours et de travaux des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés de Palestine dans le Proche-Orient (UNRWA) et 13 étaient des écoles privées. Au total, 154 251 élèves étaient inscrits, et 5 877 enseignants étaient employés.\nFin 2023, à la suite de la guerre menée par Israël dans la bande de Gaza, toutes les écoles ont dû être fermés et un grand nombre d'établissements sont devenus des lieux de refuge pour la population civile. À la rentrée 2024, plus de 45 000 enfants de classe primaire n'ont pas pu aller à l'école à cause de la situation actuelle. Ils rejoignent les 625 000 élèves déjà privés d’une année scolaire entière. Quant aux universités de la ville, elles ont été partiellement voire totalement détruites par l’armée israélienne en 2024.\n\nPatrimoine\nLe centre-ville comporte un certain nombre de monuments importants. Toutefois, un grand nombre d'entre eux ont été détruits par les bombardements israéliens depuis 2023.\n\nLa Grande mosquée de Gaza (al-Omari), ancienne église datant du XIIe siècle, a gardé son architecture gothique caractéristique. Elle a ensuite été agrandie au XIIIe siècle sous les Mamelouks, qui lui ont notamment ajouté un minaret. L'édifice a été gravement endommagé au cours de la Première Guerre mondiale, puis fut restauré sous le mandat britannique. En décembre 2023, le monument est détruit par l'armée israélienne.\n\nLe musée de la ville occupe un édifice d'époque mamelouke et ottomane, le Qasr al-Basha, magnifiquement restauré au début des années 2000. C'était au XVIIe siècle la résidence du gouverneur ottoman de Palestine et le général Napoléon Bonaparte y a installé son quartier général lors de son passage dans la ville en 1798. Fin 2023, il est en grande partie détruit par les bombardements israéliens.\n\nOn trouve enfin l'église Saint-Porphyre, qui daterait du début du XIIe siècle, centre de la communauté orthodoxe de la ville, dont l'état actuel paraît remonter à l'époque des croisades. Le 19 octobre 2023, l'église Saint-Porphyre est endommagée par une frappe israélienne lors de la guerre à Gaza.\nLe centre-ville compte encore d'anciennes maisons familiales en pierre locale, également de l'époque ottomane.\nL'église de la Sainte-Famille de Gaza est le centre de la communauté catholique de la bande de Gaza. Le 17 juillet 2025, elle est bombardée par l'armée israélienne, causant trois morts et blessant le curé Gabriel Romanelli.\nGaza compte aussi un hammam datant de l'époque ottomane, récemment restauré, puis détruit par l'armée israélienne pendant la guerre de 2023-2025.\n\nInventaire du patrimoine détruit par l'armée israélienne\nSelon l'UNESCO, au printemps 2025, les deux tiers du patrimoine de la bande de Gaza ont déjà été détruits par l'armée israélienne. Sous la conduite de l’historien Fabrice Virgili, un collectif de chercheurs et d'universitaires français recense le patrimoine architectural, et naturel, détruit par l'armée israélienne.

          "summary": "Gaza (en arabe : غَزَّة, Ġazza [/[ˈɣazza]]) est la principale ville de la bande de Gaza. Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.",

          "content": "## Overview\nThe Gaza Strip (Arabic غزة, Ghazzah, Hebrew עזה Azza) is a Palestinian territory in the Middle East. The capital and largest city is Gaza. Portions of this page may be out of date because the situation on the ground changes quickly.\n\n## Understand\nPositioned between Israel and Egypt, Gaza Strip contains several towns and cities that have grown together. The capital and largest city is Gaza, with Khan Yunis and Rafah being the second and third largest. Several smaller villages are nestled between these cities. It does have reasonably modern infrastructure and architecture despite its troubles, but a UN report as early as 1952 stated that the Strip was too small to support its population of 300,000, and now there are well over 1.7 million inhabitants. On 7 October 2023, the Israel-Hamas War broke out, and thousands of people have been killed.\nMost inhabitants are descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from their homes in Israel during or after the 1948 war and were not allowed to return to their homes and villages. As they were not Egyptian citizens they were not allowed into Egypt, either.\n\n## History\nGaza has been around for a while: the earliest known reference is an inscription in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, Egypt, dated 1500 BC, which states that the town of Gaza is 'flourishing'. And for a long time it did: a staging post on trade routes connecting Asia and Persia with Arabia, Egypt and Africa, even the name means \"treasure\" in Arabic. Alexander the Great laid siege to the town in 332 BC, executing 10,000 defenders after being held off for two months. Later, the town was held by the Romans, the Crusaders, the Mamluks, the Ottomans and briefly even by the French in 1799, when Napoleon Bonaparte set up camp on his way to defeat in Egypt. The Turks took it back, then lost it to the British in World War I. The Egyptian army grabbed it during the 1948 war that led to Israel's independence, opening camps for Palestinian refugees who fled and were expelled from their homes by Israeli forces — and the current situation began when Israel occupied the Strip in 1967.\nSpurred by the violence of the 1987–1993 Intifada (\"Uprising\"), Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a \"Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements\" in 1993, under which the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created to govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a transitional period \"not exceeding five years\" as a step towards full independence.  Parts of the territories were indeed handed over to the PA between 1994 and 1999, but the peace plans were derailed by the second intifada that broke out in September 2000, unleashing another spiral of violence.\nIsrael unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in 2005, evacuating Jewish settlements and withdrawing its troops from the territory. It did however retain control of the airspace and the coastline in addition to the fact the entire region is circled by a large armed security fence. The Islamist Hamas won elections in 2006 and violently kicked out or killed the remnants of the Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Under Hamas rule, there have been repeated incidents of missile launches from Gaza into Israel and Israeli targeted assassinations of terrorists in Gaza, bombings, and incursions or invasions of Gaza. Israel has also heavily restricted the movement of trade, aid, and people between Gaza and Israel in response to attacks on border crossing points and the Hamas government's non-recognition of Israel. Relations between Hamas and the Egyptian government have also been tense at times, with the Egyptian government sometimes blaming Hamas for attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians in the Sinai but also condemning Israeli actions against Gaza. From December 2008 to January 2009, Israel launched a massive coordinated air, naval, and land offensive against the Hamas government and allied militant organizations. Hostilities resumed in 2012, but a short-lived ceasefire was restored with the help of Egyptian mediation.\nIn 2025, Israel is at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It's very unlikely that you will be able to get into Gaza unless you are an accredited journalist, or UN or charity worker, and you will have performed in-depth risk assessments. Do not rely on a travel guide for your risk assessment. Civilian infrastructure has been hit very hard, and your presence in the strip will divert resources from the needy.\n\n## Geography\nThe Gaza Strip is a narrow, 40-km long slice of land between the Mediterranean to the west and the Negev desert to the east.  Egypt lies to the south, the north and east border Israel.  The urban sprawl of Gaza City, mostly stretching along and around the 3-km long Omar al-Mukhtar Street, covers much of the north. The other main towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah are near the southern border, with most of the rest covered with agricultural land.\nA bit of terminology disentanglement: Gaza Strip refers to the entire 40km by 6km patch of territory. The strip is slightly smaller than Barbados and slightly larger than Malta. Gaza City refers to the town itself, in the northern part of the strip, but due to huge population growth the City now sprawls into many of the surrounding villages and it's a tough task to say what is a part of the City and what isn't. Both city and strip are pretty much interchangeably referred to as Gaza and this guide will follow suit.\n\n## Climate\nTemperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers.\n\n## Terrain\nFlat to rolling, sand and dune covered coastal plain. Cultivated land.\nHighest point: Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda) 105 m (344 ft)\n\n## Get in\nGetting into Gaza is both difficult and unwise. As of around 2003, all would-be visitors were required to apply in advance for Israeli permission to enter the Strip. The application is usually submitted through your embassy in Israel and, in theory takes between 5–10 days. In practice, it can take months, and if you're not either a fully accredited journalist or an aid/human rights worker, you're unlikely to get permission to enter Gaza from Israel.\nBecause of the Israel-Hamas war, it is not possible to enter Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing.\n\n## By plane\nGaza has no functioning airport, as the former Yasser Arafat International Airport (GZA  IATA) has been shut down, and the runway was destroyed by Israeli bulldozers in 2002. The closest airports are El Arish International Airport in Egypt (which has no commercial flights) and Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv (TLV IATA). The closest non-Israeli commercial airports are Jordan's Queen Alia International Airport (AMM IATA) and King Hussein International Airport (AQJ IATA), while the closest Egyptian-controlled airport with non-charter commercial service is Cairo International Airport (CAI IATA). Taba International Airport (TCP  IATA) is closer than Cairo, but only charter flights fly there.\n\n## Entry by land\nThe main point of entry is through the Erez crossing in the north, on the border with Israel. Getting to Erez is easiest done by taxi, it's also possible to travel by Dan BaDarom[dead link] bus #20 from Ashkelon to the checkpoint.\nYou will need a permit from the Israeli Army, or a GPO (press) card. If you have a permit, you need coordination with the Israeli Army, specifying when you are planning to enter and leave Gaza. Journalists with a Government Press Office (GPO) card can come and go as they please. Only vehicles with prior coordination (such as a handful of UN cars) are allowed to drive in and only after a thorough search, which may take months. It's very helpful to travel with someone that's run the gauntlet before the first time via Erez.\nAt Erez, you have to approach the Israeli soldier in a pillbox. They may ask you to open your bags on the table, and (as at TLV) ask if you have weapons. They'll check your passports and permits for allowed entry. You then wait outside an electronic gate for your turn to be called through. You then enter the terminal, hand your passport and coordination over to another soldier to receive an Israeli exit stamp. That soldier may or may not ask you more questions, usually things like whether it's your first time in Gaza, etc.\nIf everything is satisfactory, take back your documents and follow the signs directing you to Gaza. After exiting the terminal, you end up in a long barren concrete tunnel. Don't bring anything too bulky as you'll have to go through a turnstile gate. Coming through the tunnel, you cross a no-man's-land. This is at least 1000m long. Palestinians are allowed in this area so you may be lucky and find a porter, trolley, wheelchair, or similar. Take it. If you take the tuk-tuk, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times and enjoy the ride.\nAfter the gated tunnel you will emerge near a small hut. This is a checkpoint which can be ignored on the way to Gaza (but ignored at your peril on the way back). The only people here will be a few taxi drivers.\nTake a taxi to the Palestinian checkpoint, another 800 m down the road. The going rate is ₪3 per person. You will be searched for unlawful items (make sure you are, it's the hut to the right. Also visit the hut to the left to check your Hamas credentials)\nProhibited goods include alcohol and non-halal food, banned by the Hamas government. If you fail inspection, then at best, your items will be confiscated. At worst, you will be arrested; you are unlikely to see any guns at this point. In a particularly bad situation, retreat to Israel.\nOnce you are through, you can take another taxi, or more likely be picked up by your local contact.\n\n## Exit by land\nEntry, though difficult, pales in comparison to exit. After being deposited at the Hamas checkpoint near Hamsa Hamsa, go to the white caravan to your right to get your exit clearance.\nOnce through, take the taxi (₪3/person) to the forward checkpoint (where the wire fence begins). Then, go to the hut on the right.\nA man will take your passport and call ahead to tell the Israelis you're coming. Ignore this at your own peril.\nOnce you get your passport back, take the tuk-tuk if possible, or begin the 1 km+ walk to Israel.\nWhen you reach the end of the tunnel, you'll see several doors. Once a handful of people have gathered, one of the doors will open (indicated by a green light on top of the door).\nYou will then enter a hall with a table at the centre. Open your bags at the table (there are no obvious signs to do this, but look up and there's a camera. They are checking for obvious things like large bombs)\nWhen they've ensured you have no prohibited items in your bags, go through the turnstile when the light flashes green. You will not receive a verbal \"OK\", but rest assured you will be shouted at in Hebrew if you're not ok.\nYou will see toilet facilities to your right. Use them. Follow the arrows to Israel. You will then encounter another hall with eight doorways. Wait until one of the lights go green then enter that doorway. Leave your bags with the porter at a large security scanner. You should remove all electronics not just laptops, but things like disk drives, mobile phones, etc.) and place them in the large trays. Remove your belt, watch, etc. too.\nKeep your passport and ID on you and enter a series of gates as the lights flash green. When you come to the body scanner (an MMW scanner), put your feet on the markers and place your hands over your head in an \"I surrender\" pose. Keep your passport in your hands. If you've passed initial screening, you will be allowed out to a hall where it appears as if your bags will emerge on a conveyor belt. There may even be empty trays circling it.\nWalk straight through to the departures hall, as your bag will be selected for a hand search. On your left in a row where trays with bags will gather, and you can see the guards searching your bags. Wait patiently. If you haven't passed initial screening, you'll be directed through further scanning. There is a separate section that will reveal itself to you if the guards in the gallery above find the need for a strip search.\nOnce you collect your belongings, you will finally pass through Israeli entry, and get a new stamp in your passport. You're then free and in Israel. Count yourself lucky you own a western passport.\nExit from Gaza could take from 30 minutes to several hours. The checkpoint closes at 14:00, or even earlier. If you are stuck between Hamas and Israel phone your embassy for assistance, but don't try to re-enter Gaza. If you're using Erez you're probably \"western\", and you're safer in Israeli hands.\n\n## By boat\nThe port of Gaza is non-operational, and Gazan waters, seaports, and the coastline are patrolled by the Israeli Navy. If you attempt to reach the Gaza shoreline by boat, you will be stopped by Israeli naval vessels, and turned back. Only boats with prior permission are allowed in. All boats coming from Gaza are allowed to venture six nautical miles into the sea. Any vessel crossing this line is fired on. In 2010 a six-ship flotilla attempted to reach Gaza by sea, and was intercepted by Israeli warships; ten people were killed by Israeli forces and the ships never reached Gaza. It is strongly recommended not to attempt to visit Gaza in this manner.\n\n## Get around\nThere is no public transport in Gaza, but there are numerous service (ser-VEESS) taxis.  Navigation is done by landmark, not street address. Stand on the side of the road that is in the desired direction of travel.  When a driver stops indicate the destination landmark e.g., \"Shifa\" and the number of passengers (\"wahid\" for one, \"it-nayn\" for two.)  If the driver is not headed that way, he may drive on. Travel up and down Omar al-Mukhtar St. will set you back ₪1; trips elsewhere are negotiable.  Near al-Shifa hospital is a line of taxis that travel to destinations beyond Gaza city.  The drivers yell out their destination and wait until their vehicle is pretty much full before they leave. It is advisable to watch your step if walking, since traffic is chaotic and sidewalks are largely non-existent.\n\n## Talk\nThe standard language is Arabic. Hebrew is also understood to some extent, but given the dislike towards Israelis by many Palestinians, English is a safer option.\n\n## See\nGaza is not exactly a top tourist destination and most of its attractions have taken quite a beating during the past 50 years.\n31.50122234.4713891 Grand Omari Mosque (جامع غزة الكبير, Jāmaʿ Ghazza al-Kabīr).

Located att the archaeological site Tell Umm el-'Amr, Saint Hilarion was an active monastery for four centuries, from the late Late Roman to the Umayyad period. Named after Hilarion the Great (291–371 AD), who is venerated as a saint by the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church. The tell and monastery were listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2024.

Burial site of over 3,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen who perished in the First World War, mainly in the battles for Gaza during 1917.   (updated Aug 2023)\nMore educational might be a UNRWA-arranged visit to one of the refugee camps that dot the strip. The UNRWA office is on al-Azhar St, near the Islamic University, call ahead to see if they can arrange a little tour. Your most probable destination is the optimistically named Beach Camp, a warren of concrete huts and open sewers housing 63,000 people, built next to a sandy beach - and you can walk there on your own, 15 minutes to the north from the intersection of Omar al-Mukhtar St. with the seafront road. UNRWA wisely recommends avoiding military clothing. The Jabaliya refugee camp is also a nearby option. Women visiting the camps should dress more conservatively than they need to in Gaza City - headscarves are certainly recommended.\n\n## Do\nThere's very little to do in Gaza for the average tourist. There is a beach, however the water isn't the cleanest in the area, you'd be better off on a beach further north in Israel. There are nice sunsets though over the Med, which can be seen from hotels like the Al Deira.\n\n## Buy\nDespite the intense conflict and rhetoric, Gazans use the Israeli shekel (₪). But bring some boxes of cigarettes into the Strip and everyone will be your friend. However, please note the policemen at the Hamas checkpoint into Gaza are now opening all bags and disposing of any alcohol (since early 2009). Do not bring alcohol into Gaza, it could land you into serious trouble and it is always good to respect local Islamic customs.\n31.51996134.4480561 Gaza City Centre. This elegant  mall  opened in 2010 is the place to be to escape the hubbub of Gaza's bustling Rimal district. With a fully-stocked supermarket, fast food restaurant and multiple shops, Gazans have quickly taken to this place. Enjoy the relaxing fountains if you have had enough of shopping or need a break. The Gaza Mall is comparable to most Western-style malls only in structure and comfort, but not even remotely in size. You will usually find it packed to the brim with residents of Rimal in the summer escaping the midday heat and may quickly find you want to escape elsewhere.\nPLO Flag Shop. A bit tough to find (ask around) but unmistakable once you spot it. It's the place to buy Palestinian flags, stickers, badges, and pennants. (updated May 2020)\nInteresting sculptures / lampshades fashioned from old cigarette cartons.\nFoustouk and simsimiya. The former is a sticky peanuty snack. The latter is its sesame cousin. An elderly man in Gaza City with a grey tweed jacket crops up on a different street corner when he has a fresh batch.\n\n## Eat\nUsual Arabic cheap eats are available anywhere. Head to the posh suburb of Rimal for fancier food; the restaurant in the Windmill Hotel is nice. If you wish to bring in any food, you should first check which foods are and are not acceptable under Islamic law. If you are caught with forbidden food, it may lead to trouble with the authorities or the local population. Finally, it is not unheard of to be invited over for dinner.\nAbu Hassera. Fish specialist.\nAldeira Restaurant. On the seaside terrace, this restaurant serves lovely mezes (small Mediterranean-style dishes), including the Gazan speciality Daqqa (a sometimes very spicy chili salad, very nice). They also have some tasty main courses: try the shrimps in tomato sauce, baked in the oven, and served in a clay pot. And don't miss out on the fresh strawberry juice! Enhanced with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, it is highly enjoyable.\nMatouk (behind the legislative council building). Serves an excellent chicken tawwouk.\n31.51662634.4499771 [dead link] Roots Club, Cairo St, Remal (in the heart of Gaza City), ☏ +972 8 2888666, fax: +972 8 2888999, info@rootsclub.ps. Fine dining. Offers both high end Arabian/Mediterranean cuisine and cheaper fast food at the Big Bite annex. The restaurant frequently caters for special events, including foreign dignitaries and heads of non-governmental organizations.\nSeafood Restaurant (just north of al-Deira hotel). Very good seafood restaurant.\nAl Mat'haf Resort (Soudnya beach), ☏ +970 8 2858444. On a small hill overlooking the sea in Gaza stands “Al-Mathaf” (Arabic for “The Museum”, pronounced Al-Mat-Haf), a one-of-a-kind recreation and cultural center that showcases Gaza’s rich historical past and seamlessly blends it into the context of life in modern Gaza. As its name suggests, Al-Mathaf is home to Gaza’s finest archaeological museum, which is filled with beautiful artifacts that celebrate Gaza’s rich cultural heritage. Alongside these historical treasures of ancient civilizations, today’s Gazans gathers at Al-Mathaf’s beautiful Restaurant-Café, a center of modern culture and recreation in Gaza. In a time when many in Gaza have forgotten our heritage, Al-Mathaf aims to preserve the region's rich history, provide a venue for modern cultural dialogue, and carry a message for this generation to build a brighter future.\n\n## Drink\nDue to increasingly strong Hamas influences, alcohol is no longer available. Alcohol is forbidden in their interpretation of Islam, and Hamas, as a conservative Islamic group, prohibits it. If you do manage to find some, you should not attempt to go out under the influence; you may land in a very bad situation. If you are caught with booze on your person by Hamas authorities, it will probably be confiscated, and you may be detained. Bags are given a quick search on entry to Gaza.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are several hotels in Gaza. However, it is also possible to stay with locals who might even invite you over for a night.\n31.527534.43711 Al Deira Hotel (فندق الديرة غزة فلسطين), ☏ +972 8 283 8100, fax: +972 8 283 8400, info@aldeira.ps. Massive rooms with a view of the sea, breakfast included. Most international journalists and NGOs stay at the Deira, which has a back-up generator, a business centre and WiFi. Pleasant (though by Gaza's standards not superb) restaurant (with Shisha pipes, although not allowed in the fine Oriental bedrooms). Don't be alarmed that the water tastes salty. Rooms include non-alcoholic minibar, hairdryer, towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a little plate of cookies. $100–185USD/night.      (updated Sep 2023)\nCommodore Hotel.

(updated Dec 2021)\n\n## Work\nRealistically, if you are not already an aid worker, journalist or diplomat, there is no work for you in Gaza. There are a number of NGOs offering internships, such as the Al-Dameer Association for Human Rights in Gaza, the Palestinian Center For Human Rights and others, but these must be arranged well before you get to Gaza.\n\n## Stay safe\nAs of August 2024, Gaza is at war and almost certainly the single most dangerous location to travel to. Anybody who somehow makes it in shouldn't expect any form of food, water, or medicine other than what they brought in themselves. Disease is rampant as a result of poor sanitation, and as of July 2024, there's been an outbreak of polio. Bombings can happen anywhere, including the refugee camps, at any time. If you find yourself in danger (which is likely), your government will not be able to offer any form of assistance.\nGaza's power station and its substation have been severely damaged by Israeli airstrikes and no longer function at the intended capacity. Power outages are very common. These outages are countered by large industrial and small commercial diesel generators which combine to create a cacophony that the locals have somehow become desensitised to. Some of these generators are poorly maintained and leak carbon monoxide. Visitors should be wary of this, particularly in enclosed spaces where it has proven fatal.\n\n## Stay healthy\nTap water in Gaza is not potable and is often dangerously dirty. Some hotels may use filters, but if in doubt, just buy bottles.\nIsrael has blockaded the area since 2007. However, food and medical supplies are generally allowed in after inspection. Any medical requirements should be taken care of in Israel or elsewhere. Anyone visiting Gaza is well advised to have a good grounding in first aid and bring in their own first aid kits. Beware that medical evacuations to Israel can require a long wait at the border.\nDiseases such as yellow fever, malaria and West Nile virus are fairly common in the Gaza Strip. Get vaccinated, wear protective clothing and use mosquito repellent.\n\n## Respect\nWomen should dress conservatively, especially if entering refugee camps. Conservatively within Gaza City means a top with long sleeves and absolutely nothing low cut in the front. Ideally, tops should also be long. Trousers are suitable as long as they are loose and full length, not capri pants.\n\n## Go next\nIsrael\nEgypt",

          "content": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nRamallah was founded in the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.\nSeveral Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called Ramalie. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called al-Burj, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.\n\nOttoman period\nThe area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.\nHaddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian \"of the Greek rite\". There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village \"belonged\" to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Ramallah as\n\nA large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.\n\nBritish Mandate\nDuring World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city's homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.\nThe city became a center of insurgent activity when the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine broke out. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce \"news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.\"\n\nJordanian and Israeli occupation\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized part of the territory, which they named the West Bank, which included Ramallah. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian occupation between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. However, many Palestinians were arrested and jailed for being members of \"illegal political parties\", which included the Palestine Communist Party, and other socialist and pro-independence groups. The city's population had doubled by 1953, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. About one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left by 1956, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. Because of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for the first time in 19 years, residents of Ramallah could freely visit the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel, and engage in commerce there.\nUnlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.\nAccording to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. The popular uprising known as the First Intifada erupted in December 1987, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.\nRamallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. Following the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa in December 1995 and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated \"Area A\" under the accords.\n\nPalestinian Authority control\nThe years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the \"Oslo Years\") brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah's isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine.  It hosts almost all governmental headquarters.  In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.\nOn November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.\nIn December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for a four-year term on the fifteen-seat municipal council. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.\nMunir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, \"The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries\", representing a \"collusion\" between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that \"If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.\" In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.\n\nGeography and climate\nThis area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about 615 mm (24 in) and minimum rainfall is 307 mm (12 in) and maximum rainfall is 1,591 mm (63 in).\nThe Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.\n\nEconomy\nRamallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country's numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.\nConstruction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.\nRamallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to \"exponential growth\". In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research & development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.\nBy 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and \"five-star\" hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, \"more than one hundred\" Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because \"Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.\" One local boasted to a journalist that \"Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.\" This boast was seconded by The New York Times which, in 2010, called Ramallah the \"de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of This Week in Palestine, \"Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.\" Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah's prosperity is part of an Israeli \"conspiracy\" to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.\n\nDemographics\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the Bire area, \"north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.\" In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 \"other\". The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).\nHowever, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically under Jordanian occupation, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. This left slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants Christian by 1967, and the remainder Muslim.\nRamallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in Washington, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in Michigan. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in Detroit. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.\nRamallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.\nOnly in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.\n\nHealth\nIn the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened.\n\nReligion\nThe Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city's largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city.\n\nChristian presence\nRamallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.\nThere is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph's Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.\nAs of 2022, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened \"The Girls Training Home of Ramallah\" in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional \"Tawjihi\" university exams.\nThe activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.\nIn the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.\n\nCulture\nRamallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians.\nIn 2004 the Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.\n\nPalestinian costume\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\nVillages in the Levant under Ottoman rule remained isolated due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.\n\nInternational relations\nMany foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, as of 2010, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRamallah is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nPaul Ajlouny (b. 1933), Palestinian-American publisher and businessman\nHamze Awawde (b. 1990), Palestinian peace activist\nMahmoud Eid (b. 1993), professional footballer\nAmber Fares, Lebanese Canadian filmmaker\nYasmeen Mjalli (born 1996), American and Palestinian fashion designer, photographer and anti-street harassment activist.\nJibril Rajoub (b. 1953), Palestinian political leader, former militant\nMosab Hassan Yousef (b. 1978), Palestinian ex-militant and defector\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nEconomy of the State of Palestine\nAl-Ram, Palestinian town few km southeast of Ramallah\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRamallah City Archived October 16, 2012, at the Wayback Machine\nWelcome To The City of Ramallah\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:  IAA, Wikimedia commons\nRamallah History\nMusic and Art from Ramallah Archived January 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\nQuaker Meeting in Ramallah\nWest Bank/Palestine\nRamallah\nAl Kasaba Theatre\nKhalil Sakakini Cultural Centre\nFirst Ramallah Group\nRamallah International Film Festival Archived June 17, 2013, at the Wayback Machine\nRamallahOnline.com\nRamallah Club of Metro Detroit\nJnewswire.com, Ramallah ancient synagogue\nAnne Brunswic's book Welcome to Palestine, English translation",
          "summary": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.",

          "content": "رام الله مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة رام الله والبيرة. تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الشمال من القدس بحوالي 15 كم، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 880 مترًا، وتبلغ مساحتها 16,5 كم²، بلغ عدد سكانها حوالي 38,998 نسمة، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان المحافظة حوالي 328,861 نسمة. تلاصق رام الله مدينة البيرة حتى تتداخل مبانيهما وشوارعهما لتبدوا كمدينة واحدة، ومع أن مدينة البيرة أكبر من حيث المساحة وعدد السكان، إلّا أن الأشهر بينهما هي مدينة رام الله.\n\nتحتل رام الله حاليًا مركزًا سياسيًا يجعلها من أهم المدن الفلسطينية، إذ إنها تُعتبر العاصمة الإدارية المؤقتة للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وفيها إلى جانب مدينة البيرة مقر الرئاسة الفلسطينية، ومبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، والمقرات العامة للأجهزة الأمنية الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، بالإضافة إلى معظم مكاتب ووزارات السلطة. كما تعتبر العاصمة الثقافية لوجود عدد من المراكز الثقافية الفلسطينية النشطة فيها.\nعُرفت المدينة بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار الصليبيين، ووفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن المدينة قد تأسست في القرن السادس عشر أثناء الحكم العثماني، والتي ازدهرت في آواخر أيامهم إذ تأسس أول مجلس بلدي فيها عام 1908. وقد احتفلت بلدية رام الله مؤخرا بمئويتها الأولى مطلقة مشروعًا تنمويًا بهذه المناسبة.\nتقع رام الله ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، حيث تطل على الساحل الفلسطيني للبحر المتوسط، والذي يبعد عن المدينة حوالي 45 كيلومترا إلى الغرب. أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر بين 770 مترًا. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخيًا منطقة مسيحية، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، مع وجود قوي لأقلية مسيحية.\n\nالتسمية\nتضاربت الأقوال عن تسمية رام الله إذ عرفت في التوراة باسم (رامَتايم صوفيم) وذكرها المؤرخ يوسيفوس باسم (فكولا)، وقيل (جلبات ايلوهم). وقد أثبت الأثريون عدم صحة هذه الأسماء لأن أمكنة الملوك التي نسبت إليهم مثل الملك صموئيل وشاؤول مختلفة عن المدينة الحالية.\nإلا أن هناك تفسيرات أقرب إلى الصحة إذ تعني كلمة رام المنطقة المرتفعة، وهي كلمة كنعانية منتشرة في أماكن مختلفة في فلسطين، وأضاف إليها العرب كلمة الله فأصبحت رام الله، وقد عرفها الصليبيون بهذا الاسم، ولكن الثابت تاريخيا أن قبيلة عربية جاءت في أواخر القرن السادس عشر وسكنت في قرية أو غابة حرجية اسمها رام الله.\n\nالتاريخ\nنظرا لأن رام الله والبيرة تمتدان عمرانيا بشكل متصل، إذ لا يمكن فصل تاريخ المدينتين عن بعضها الآخر، فمن الطبيعي أن يتم دراسة تاريخهما بشكل متكامل. وتشير الدراسات التاريخية والأثرية إلى أن قصة النبي يوسف قد حدثت في منطقة رام الله والبيرة، ولقد اختلف المؤرخون في تحديد البئر الذي ألقي فيه النبي يوسف، وعلى الرغم من هذا الاختلاف فإن موقع البيرة الحالي لا يبتعد كثيرا عن هذه التوقعات بسبب وقوعه على طريق القوافل المتجهة من الجنوب إلى الشمال أو بالعكس، وكان هذا الموقع الذي كانت تحط به الرحال طلباً للراحة والاستجمام وسعياً وراء الطعام والماء، وكان يوجد في البيرة نبع ماء قديم كان معروفا لتلك القوافل، ما حفز الأهالي في ذلك الوقت إلى إقامة أكثر من بناء لتزويد المسافرين بحاجاتهم من الطعام لقاء مال أو مبادلة تجارية، وقد ذكر الإنجيل أن السيد المسيح كان يمر بالبيرة في طريقه من القدس إلى الناصرة (تخلف مع فتيان البيرة الذين كانوا يلهون ويلعبون على نبع الماء وهكذا ضل عن أمه وعن يوسف النجار، مما اضطرها إلى العودة إلى القدس لكي تبحث عنه).\nعند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام في القرن السابع الميلادي دخلت البيرة في حوزة المسلمين، وبنى المسلمون في الفترة الإسلامية المبكرة مسجدين بالقرب من الخان ما زالا مستخدمين حتى اليوم، يعرف الأول منهما باسم «الجامع العمري»، وهو الجامع الملاصق لكنيسة العائلة المقدسة وسط البلدة القديمة، «وجامع العين» الواقع على عين شارع القدس- نابلس بالقرب من مبنى البلدية الحالي. وتغير مركز مدينة البيرة من عصر إلى آخر، ويبدو أن أقدم موقع استوطنه أهل البيرة هو منطقة الإرسال، ثم تل النصبة، ثم عين أم الشرايط، ثم موقع البلدة القديمة الحالي، أما الآن فقد توسعت حدود المدينة فشملت كل هذه المناطق. وفي سنة 1099 وقعت في أيدي الغزاة الفرنجة قبل احتلالهم لمدينة القدس، وأقاموا فيها فترة من الزمن وكانت مركزاً ممتازاً. في عام 1187 عبر جنود المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين البيرة ومن ثم استطاع صلاح الدين انتزاع القدس من أيدي الصليبين.\nكانت رام الله في فترة الحروب الصليبية مستعمرة زراعية إلى جوار البيرة، أطلق الصليبيون عليها اسم \"Ramallie\" أو \"Ramalie\" حيث توجد بقايا برج صليبي في البلدة القديمة لرام الله، ويقال أن رام الله وبعض البلدان الأخرى قد أوقف الملك قلاوون عُشر منتوجات أراضيها على حرم الخليل. إلا أنها لم تكن معروفة حتى القرن السادس عشر بسبب صغر مساحتها وقلة عدد سكانها بالمقارنة بالقرى المحيطة بها.\n\nالدولة العثمانية\nأسست مدينة رام الله على يد شيخ إحدى عشائر الكرك المسيحية يدعى الشيخ راشد الحدادين، قرر الجلو عن موطنه بسبب خلافات عشائرية في القرن السادس عشر. ويحكى أنه جلى من الكرك ليلا وبعد أيام دخل على أهل البيرة فرحبوا به. وأشاروا عليه بخربة اسمها رام الله لتكون موطنه. اشترى الشيخ راشد خربة رام الله من عائلات البيرة القدامى، دون أن يعلم أنه كان يؤسس لمدينة سيكون لها دور هام في تاريخ الفلسطينيين.\nوتجسد تماثيل الأسود الخمسة الواقعة في ساحة المنارة وسط مدينة رام الله تاريخ المدينة، حيث قام النحات أبو صادق غانم بنحتها لترمز لأبناء راشد الحدادين الخمسة، عواد، ويوسف، وجغب، وشقرة، وشراقة، والذين انبثقت منهم عائلات رام الله.\nوقد بدأ في رام الله مع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر تأسيس مدارس كانت من أولى المدارس النظامية في فلسطين، اسمها «الفرندز» وتعني (الأصدقاء)، وهي من المدارس التبشيرية التي بادرت إلى ايجادها جماعة الكويكرز وهي منظمة دينية مسيحية أميركية. وتضم مدرستين في رام الله والبيرة، الأولى للبنات وتعود للعام 1889 والأخرى للصبيان تعود للعام 1901. وكلتاهما تتبعان لمجلس أمناء واحد ويزيد عدد طلابهما الآن عن الألف.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت رام الله بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت رام الله مركزا لقضاء رام الله في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة. كانت المدنية قد ازدادت أهمية في هذه الفترة نتيجة ثلاثة تطورات مهمة: أولها إنشاء أعمدة الإرسال الشاهقة لـ «محطة الإذاعة الفلسطينية» من قبل حكومة الانتداب البريطانية عام 1936 على أراضي قرية البيرة التي يقع مدخلها على الشارع الرئيسي المتجه إلى قرية بيرزيت وقرى بني زيد. وهو الشارع الذي أصبح اسمه منذ ذلك الحين «شارع الإذاعة» أو «شارع الإرسال». وللشارع أهمية كبيرة في ذلك الوقت نظرا لوجود عدد من الفنادق «كفندق الحمراء» و«فندق حرب» وكان يجذب أهالي مدينة رام الله والقدس أيام الآحاد للاستمتاع بالجلوس في أحضان الطبيعة.\nأما التطور الثاني فقد جاء نتيجة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى 1936-1939، حيث أقامت حكومة الانتداب على غرار ما جرى في بقية المدن الفلسطينية، المبنى الضخم المعروف حاليا بمبنى المقاطعة (مبنى تجاري على اسم المهندس البريطاني الذي صمم هذه المباني لتستوعب الدوائر الحكومية والسجون ...الخ). وبالتالي فقد أصبحت معنية بتوسيع شبكة الطرق القريبة لتستوعب الضغط الناجم عن إنشاء هذا المبنى ومحطة الإذاعة. أما التطور الثالث فكان له علاقة بالهجرة إلى الأميركيتين من قبل سكان رام الله والبيرة وتعاظم ثروة أهل المدينتين مما أدى إلى توسع عمراني كبير على امتداد الشوارع الجديدة وخارج إطار المسطحات القديمة والمتراصة نسبيا.\nوقد أدت هذه التطورات إلى توسيع شبكة الطرق في المدينتين، وخصوصا توسيع وتعبيد طريق الإذاعة وإنجاز خريطة التنظيم الهيكلية لرام الله عام 1940. وهكذا أخذت شبكة الطرق المتفرعة عن الميدان شكلها النهائي رغم أن المنطقة المحيطة بالميدان ظلت في معظمها خالية أساسا من العمران. إذ لم تجر خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية تطورات عمرانية تذكر فظروف الحرب قد حالت دون الحصول على مواد البناء وخصوصا الاسمنت والحديد حيث احتفظت بهما حكومة الانتداب للأغراض الحربية.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكانت رام الله في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء رام الله، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\n\nالإدارة الأردنية\nوفي أوائل خمسينيات القرن العشرين خضعت رام الله للحكم الأردني بين حربي 1948 و1967، وأصبحت رام الله فيما بعد مركزا للواء رام الله التابع لمحافظة القدس. وقد كانت المدينة هادئة نسبيا خلال سنوات الحكم الأردني، وكان السكان يتمتعون بحرية الحركة بين الضفة الغربية والأردن ولبنان وسوريا وأماكن أخرى. وكان الأردن بضم الضفة الغربية، يطبق قانونه على الأرض. ومع ذلك، سجن كثير من الفلسطينيين لكونهم أعضاء في ما كانت الحكومة الأردنية تعتبره أحزاب سياسية غير مشروعة، بما في ذلك الحزب الشيوعي الفلسطيني وغيرها من الجماعات الاشتراكية والمؤيدة للاستقلال. وضع القانون الأردني قيودا على الإبداع والحرية المطلوبة من قبل العديد من الفلسطينيين في ذلك الوقت. بحلول عام 1953، تضاعف سكان رام الله، ولكنها لم تكن مجهزة للاقتصاد والبنية التحتية للتعامل مع تدفق القرويين الفقراء. غادر أهالي مدينة رام الله، في المقام الأول إلى الولايات المتحدة. ونظراً لكون مدينة رام الله مركز للواء فقد استأثرت بنصيب وافر من مراكز الخدمات الإدارية والتعليمية والصحية والاجتماعية والاقتصادية يشرف عليها المجلس البلدي والذي قام بتأسيس شركة المياه، وغرفة التجارة تأسست عام 1950م وغايتها تسهيل الأعمال التجارية.\n\nحرب 1967\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي رام الله وقراها وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات، وقد بلغ عدد المستوطنات حتى نهاية عام 1987م حوالي 30 مستوطنة، وأكبر هذه المستوطنات مستوطنة (ريمونيم) وهي قرية تعاونية أنشأت عام 1980م.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة رام الله بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع رام الله مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة رام الله قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nفي عام 1991، ضم الوفد الفلسطيني إلى مؤتمر مدريد للسلام الدولي العديد من وجهاء رام الله. كما خفت حدة الانتفاضة قدما، واستأنفت الحياة الطبيعية في رام الله. في ديسمبر 1995، وذلك تامشيا مع اتفاق أوسلو، تخلى الجيش الإسرائيلي عن المقاطعة وانسحب إلى ضواحي المدينة. تولت السلطة الفلسطينية التي أنشئت حديثا المدنية والمسؤولية الأمنية للمدينة، والتي اعتبرت «المنطقة أ» الخاضعة للاتفاقات.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 1994 تم نقل الحكم فيها للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية بموجب اتفاق أوسلو الموقع عام 1993، التي أُعلن بموجبه عن مناطق المدينة (دون القرى التابعة لها أو امتداداتها) أنها منطقة ألف (أ)؛ وهذه الأرض تخضع لسيطرة شبه كاملة من السلطة الفلسطينية. أصبحت رام الله المقر المؤقت للسلطة الفلسطينية، وبسبب رفض إسرائيل أن يكون مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في القدس الشرقية. وقد شهدت المدينة نهضة حضارية ومعمارية كبيرة في هذه الفترة.\nتعرّض كثير من تلك المقرات في رام الله إلى دمار كبير ألحقته آلة الحرب الإسرائيلية كجزء من الهجمات المستمرة على المدينة في فترة الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، مما أدّى إلى تعطيلها إلى حدِّ كبير، وعادت هذه المقرات للعمل في الفترة اللاحقة للاجتياح الإسرائيلي الكبير للمدينة في عام 2002 جاعلة رام الله العاصمة الإدارية (كأمر واقع) لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية. يشار بالذكر إلى أن حكومة نتنياهو شرعت في إعداد دراسة تهدف إلى إقناع الفلسطينيين بأهمية مدينة رام الله كعاصمة بديلة من القدس الشرقية. وتركز الدراسة على التذكير بمواقف إسحق رابين الذي ثبت مدينة القدس بقسميها الغربي والشرقي، عاصمة أبدية موحدة لدولة اليهود، ومع أنه وافق على فصل الشأن السياسي عن الشأن الديني، ووعد المسلمين والمسيحيين بممارسة شعائرهم في ظل القانون الإسرائيلي، إلا أنه أخضع وعده لضرورات الأمن القومي. لهذا السبب لم يسمح لياسر عرفات بزيارة القدس خوفاً من الجماهير التي ستستقبله.\n\nالجغرافيا\nرام الله مدينة جبلية، مبنية على جبال مطلة إلى الغرب على الساحل الفلسطيني، أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال. تبعد رام الله حوالي عشرة 15 كم إلى الشمال من القدس وتبعد المدينة عن البحر المتوسط الذي يرى من تلالها حوالي 45 كيلومترا هوائيا وكثيرا ما تشاهد منها أثناء النهار السفن الراسية، كما تبعد عن نهر الأردن قرابة 33 كم إلى الغرب. ونظرا لقرب البحر منها فإن الهواء الذي يهب عليها من الغرب يحمل معه بعض الرطوبة ولكن ارتفاع البلدة عن سطح البحر الذي يتراوح بين 830-880 مترا يلطف من هذه الرطوبة. وتبلغ مساحة مدينة رام الله 19 ألف دونم، واتخذت مجالس بلدية سابقة قرارا بتوسيع حدود المدينة إلى ألفي دونم أخرى.\nويتوسط موقع رام الله فلسطين التاريخية تقريبا، حيث تبعد عن نابلس 36 كم إلى الجنوب، وجنين 63 كم إلى الجنوب، والخليل 82 كم إلى الشمال، وغزة 82 كم إلى الشمال الشرقي، ويافا 45 كم إلى الشرق، وحيفا 105 كم إلى الجنوب الشرقي.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى 19 حيًا وهي: الريحان، الدبلوماسي، الكرينعة، الواد، النرجس، الطيرة، المصايف، الإذاعة، ردانا، عين مصباح، الجدول، قدورة، القديرة، الماصيون، عين منجد، باطن الهواء، مركز المدينة، البلدة القديمة والمنطقة الصناعية. أما بالنسبة للطرق، فتقطع رام الله عدة طرق تربط مناطقها ببعض، كما تربطها بالمدن الملتصقة بها كـالبيرة وبيتونيا، وباقي قرى ومدن فلسطين المجاورة كالقدس وبيت لحم ونابلس، والتي قامت بلدية رام الله بتسميتها على أسماء لمناطق وشخصيات فلسطينية أو عالمية، ومن أهم هذه الطرق:\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ رام الله هو مناخ متوسطي ففي الشتاء تتعرض البلدة للرياح الجنوبية الغربية القاسية الماطرة وأحيانا إلى رياح شمالية شرقية جافة باردة نسبيا. أما معدل سقوط الأمطار هو حوالي 20 إنشا أو 500 مليمتر في السنة. وعلى العموم فإن معدل درجة الحرارة في الشتاء نادرا ما يصل إلى 32 فهرنهايت أو صفر مئوي وفي الصيف قلما تزيد على 95 ف أو 35 درجة مئوية ويمكننا القول بأن معدل درجة الحرارة السنوي يتراوح بين 41-77 ف أو 5-25 م.\nوفي أوائل نيسان تأخذ الرياح الخماسينية بالهبوب وهذه رياح جافة تحمل معها كثيرا من الغبار وهي تأتينا من الجنوب وينقطع هبوب الرياح الخماسينية كلما اقترب فصل الصيف وتهب أيضا على البلدة رياح دافئة في أواخر الصيف وأوائل الخريف وتعجل بإنهاء موسمي العنب والتين. وعلى العموم فإن مناخ رام الله لطيف منعش في الصيف دافئ في الشتاء وهذا جعل الحياة فيها حياة نشاط وعمل.\n\nالسكان\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان المدينة في فترات مختلفة:\n\nيبلغ عدد سكان رام الله اليوم قرابة 30 ألف نسمة. وبالرغم من أن رام الله كانت مدينة صغيرة، إلا أن اللاجئين الفلسطينيين بعد النكبة عام 1948 شكلوا جزءا رئيسيا من التوزيع السكاني الجديد، كما أن الهجرة الداخلية وانتقال فلسطينيين للعمل في رام الله بعد قدوم سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية جراء تحولها إلى مركز إداري للسلطة زاد من عدد السكان المستقرين القادمين من مدن أخرى.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكان رام الله عام 1922م حوالي 3067 نسمة، وفي عام 1945م 5080 نسمة، وفي عام 1967م بلغ عدد سكانها حسب الإحصاء الإسرائيلي 12134 نسمة، ارتفع هذا العدد ليصل عام 1987م حوالي 24772 نسمة.\nتتمتع رام الله عن باقي المدن الفلسطينية باستمرارية وتعددية بالنشاطات الثقافية بين المهرجانات والندوات والمؤتمرات والمعارض، ويعود ذلك إلى عدة إسباب، أحدها تمركز عدد كبير من المؤسسات الناشطة في هذا المجال في مدينة رام الله إضافة إلى نشاط بلدية رام الله في هذا المجال ووجود وزارة الثقافة التابعة لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني في المدينة. وكذلك تنوع النسيج الثقافي الاجتماعي في المدينة وإتساع هامش الحرية مما جذب العديد من الشخصيات الثقافية إلى مدينة رام الله من مخرجين وكتّاب وشعراء.\nمن المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطان ومتحف محمود درويش والمركز الثقافي اليوناني والمؤسسة الفلسطينية للفن المعاصر والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي الألماني.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتعكس رام الله صورة مدينة مزدهرة تشهد حركة أعمال محمومة وفورة عقارية كست تلالها بالمباني، غير ان هذه المدينة التي تحتضن مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية تبقى استثناء في مشهد اقتصادي عام هش.\nولقد مارس سكان مدينة رام الله والبيرة العديد من الحرف منذ القدم، منها الزراعة وتربية المواشي حيث زرعوا العنب والتين والزيتون، واشتغل السكان في التجارة حيث تنقل التجار بين المدن والقرى المجاورة، كما اشتغل السكان في الصناعة مثل صناعة الأحذية والملابس والمواد الغذائية والفخار واستمر الحال حتى أوائل القرن العشرين، حيث اتجه السكان إلى الهجرة إلى أمريكا خصوصا الشباب منهم، فأخذت الأموال تتدفق على المدينة ليستثمرها السكان في شراء الأراضي وبناء العقارات لاستغلالها في السياحة، وازدادت حركة التعليم وما أن انتهت الحرب العالمية الثانية حتى وقعت حرب 1948 فكان معظم سكان المدينة قد هاجروا إلى أمريكا باستثناء 12% منهم بقوا في المدينة.\nتوجد حاليا العديد من الصناعات مثل صناعة الورق الصحي والكرتون والأثاث والمواد الغذائية وعصر الزيتون والصابون والألمنيوم والأدوية والكثير من الحرف اليدوية والتقليدية.\nأما بالنسبة للزراعة فقد اضمحلت بسبب هجرة السكان للأراضي الزراعية وتحويلها بنايات لتأخذ مكان البيوت القديمة وأصبحت المدينة تعج بمئات المحال التجارية الممتدة.\nومن الملاحظ أن تكلفة المعيشة في مدينة رام الله هي أعلى مستوى من نظيراتها في المحافظات الأخرى، ويمكن إرجاع السبب إلى عدة عوامل، أهمها وجود شريحة واسعة في رام الله يفوق مستوى دخلها معدل الدخل لباقي سكان رام الله وباقي سكان المحافظات الأخرى نظرا لعمل هذه الشريحة مع المؤسسات الأجنبية والدولية ما يجعلها قادرة على تحمّل هذه النفقات، وثانياً وجود عدد كبير من الأجانب العاملين في رام الله ذوي الدخل المرتفع جداً بالمقارنة مع المواطن العادي مما تسبب في زيادة الأسعار على كافة المستويات وبالذات العقار والمنافع الخدماتية كالمطاعم والقاعات، بالإضافة إلى وجود تحويلات شبه دائمة من المغتربين من سكان قراها الشرقية والتي معظم أفرادها مغتربون في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، وهنالك أمثلة صارخة للقرى الشرقية للمدينة التي حققت أعلى النسب في اغتراب أفرادها إلى الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. ويمكن اليوم أن يُقارن مستوى المعيشة في المدينة بنظيره في مدن عالمية أخرى. يشار إلى أنه يُقام كل عام معرضٌ للصناعات الفلسطينية في مدينة رام الله.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيمكن السفر إلى المدن المجاورة لرام الله بواسطة سيارة أجرة أو حافلات صغيرة. سيارات الأجرة متوفرة دائما في جميع أنحاء مدينة رام الله، كذلك بالنسبة للحافلات أو الحافلات الصغيرة. ويتنقل المواطنون الفلسطينيون بين رام الله والمدن والقرى المجاورة - منذ انتفاضة الأقصى - بصعوبة بالغة، حيث يعاني المواطن وفي كثيراً من الأحيان الامرّين حتى يصل إلى مبتغاه في الوقت المحدد وربما لا يصله إطلاقاً، مرد ذلك الإجراءات الإسرائيلية من حواجز واغلاقات.\nيقع جنوب رام الله في بلدة قلنديا، مطار القدس الدولي أو كما تشيع تسميته «مطار قلنديا»، يقع على أراضي محافظة القدس تحديداً في بلدة قلنديا على طريق (القدس - رام الله). يعتبر المطار أقرب إلى رام الله منه إلى مدينة القدس.\nأنشيء المطار عام 1920 تحت إدارة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين ثم في أوائل الخمسينيات وضع تحت الإدارة الأردنية بعد انضمام الضفة الغربية إلى المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، إلا أنه وقع بيد القوات الإسرائيلية في حرب 1967، والتي سرعان ما غيرت اسمه إلى «مطار عطاروت». ومنذ انتفاضة الأقصى والمطار مهمل بالرغم من أنه تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. شهد المطار حركة سياحية وتجارية نشطة في الخمسينيات والستينيات، وقد استخدمه الكثير من المسافرين وأصحاب الشخصيات الهامة مثل بابا الفاتيكان على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، وذلك لأهمية القدس الدينية والسياحية.\n\nالاتصالات\nتقع في رام الله مقرات شركات الاتصال الفلسطينية التي تزود الضفة الغربية بهذه الخدمة (جوال والوطنية موبايل). تأسست مجموعة الإتصالات الفلسطينية عام 1995 في رام الله، وكانت أول شركة اتصالات مملوكة للقطاع الخاص في العالم العربي وباشرت أعمالها في يناير عام 1997 كمشغل ومقدم لكافة أنواع خدمات الاتصالات في فلسطين. تتكون المجموعة اليوم من شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية، وشركة جوال المزود الفلسطيني الأول لخدمة الاتصال الخلوي في فلسطين وشركة «حضارة» لخدمات الاتصالات وتكنولوجيا المعلومات بالإضافة إلى شركة «حلول» لتكنولوجية المعلومات وشركة «بال ميديا» لتقديم الخدمات المرئية والإعلامية المميزة. بالإضافة إلى هذه الشركات تقوم شركة الوطنية موبايل بتزويد خدمات الاتصالات الخليوية أيضا، والتي اطلقت خدماتها تجارياً في 2009.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nتمتاز مدينة رام الله بغناها المعماري وتطورها الاجتماعي والذي انعكس عبر مبانيها وحاراتها وتجمع ساكنيها، حيث يشعر الزائر بمتابعة بصرية جميلة تعطيه الإحساس والشعور بكينونته كإنسان بمقاييسها الإنسانية والإحساس بالزمن ببعديه الماضي والمستقبلي للواجهات والأسقف والخانات والأزقة. وتعتبر المدينة أكبر تجمع من حيث عدد المباني القديمة في محافظة رام الله، بحيث تحتوي على 381 مبنى قديماً، وتشكل ما نسبته 5 % من عدد المباني الكلي في المحافظة، وتليها بذلك رنتيس، حيث تحتوي على 326 مبنى، ثم نعلين بـ 292 مبنى، ومن ثم عابود بـ 281 مبنى قديماً.\nوقد تأسس في بداية تسعينيات القرن الفائت، مركز معني بالحفاظ على الهوية المعمارية الفلسطينية القديمة في رام الله، اسمه: مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\"، والذي عمل على تحضير مخططات حماية للمباني في التجمعات، وبخاصة تلك التي ما زالت تحافظ على مراكزها ونسيجها المعماري القديم، وكذلك تلك التي تحتوي على عدد كبير من المباني القديمة، بحيث تتم حماية أكبر نسبة ممكنة من المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية بعض التجمعات، ولذلك يمكن حماية ما نسبته 35.41 % من عدد المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية التجمعات التي تحتوي على أكثر من 200 مبنى قديم.\nوقد قامت وحدة التخطيط في مركز رواق، باعداد مخطط الحفاظ على التراث الثقافي للبلدة القديمة في رام الله. حيث تم تعيين حدود وجميع فئات التراث الثقافي في المنطقة التاريخية (من مباني تاريخية، وأحواش، وأزقة...ألخ) وذلك بناءً على الدراسة الميدانية التي قام بها فريق العمل في الموقع.\nنتيجة ذلك تم تقسيم البلدة القديمة إلى منطقتين: «منطقة تاريخية أ» والتي تتميز بنسيج معماري تقليدي وعدد كبير من المباني التاريخية، و«منطقة تاريخية ب» والتي لم تعد تحتفظ بنسيج معماري تقليدي بالرغم من وجود عدد لا بأس به من المباني التاريخية. هذا وتم تعين كل المباني التاريخية المنفردة خارج هاتين المنطقتين.\nكما وتم وضع مسودة أحكام خاصة لتنظيم أعمال البناء في تللك المناطق، والتي تم نقاشها مطولاً مع لجنة أحياء البلدة القديمة المكونة من أعضاء في مجلس بلدية رام الله. هذا وتم اقرار جزء من هذه الأحكام من قبل لجنة التنظيم في البلدية.\n\nالثقافة والسياحة\nإن ما يميز مدينة رام الله هو هذا التناغم والتنوع والاختلاف في إطار الوحدة، ولكثرة من رغب بالسكن في رام الله بسبب هذا الميل العام نحو قبول الآخر، جعل منها مكان جذب للكثيرين من مختلف المناطق والبيئات والأديان ممن بحثوا عن الأمن والأمان. وقد خلق هذا الأمر أيضاً تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً فريداً، ووجد الجميع فيه ما يصبون إليه فتشكلت هذه المدينة المنوعة في ثقافتها وتوجهاتها في إطار من التواصل الغريب.\nتعتبر رام الله مركز للحياه الثقافية والأكثر انفتاحا وليبرالية في الضفة الغربية، ما دفع البعض إلى تسميتها «روح الثقافة» فهي تضم العديد من المكتبات مثل: مكتبة دار الإذاعة ومكتبة رام الله العامة بالإضافة إلى العديد من المراكز الثقافية على تنوعها، فهناك العاملة في إطار الفنون البصرية، أو السينما أو المسرح، أو الرقص الشعبي والمعاصر، أو الشعر والأدب والنشر، أو المؤسسات الموسيقية.\nوتعتبر رام الله مركزا للعديد من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية كالمركز الثقافي الألماني الفرنسي، والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، والمركز الثقافي اليوناني.\nولتطريز الأثواب في رام الله نكهة خاصة فهي لغة للتعبير وحالة نادرة ومميزة عن بقية المناطق الأخرى، بحيث يدمج بين الأشكال الهندسية والمجردة المستطيلة (كالمربعات، والنجوم) وبين الصور الرمزية، ما يعكس الحياة اليومية لأهل رام الله وسكانها. ومن أهم المهرجانات التي تقام خصيصا من أجل الحفاظ على هذا التراث، مهرجان الوفاء للتراث وارث الأجداد السنوي الذي ينظمه نادي شباب رام الله، حيث يتم تنظيم عرضاً للأزياء التراثية الفلسطينية.\nكما وتضم عددا من المراكز الرياضية، والأندية الشبابية الفاعلة، والتي يعود تأسيس بعضها إلى بدايات القرن الماضي، في حين تضم بعض هذه الأندية فرقا كشفية عريقة كان لها حضورها على مدار التاريخ الفلسطيني. من المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطّان، والتي تعمل على تفعيل الحياة الثقافية في فلسطين من خلال إنتاج أعمال مسرحية واستضافة عروض فنية في مجالات المسرح والموسيقى والرقص بالإضافة إلى عرض الأفلام السينمائية اليومية وتنظيم الأسابيع والمهرجانات السينمائية المتخصصة.\nوتضم رام الله كذلك، عددا من الجمعيات الخيرية، النسوية في مجملها، ويعود تأسيس بعضها إلى أربعينيات القرن الماضي، وتهدف هذه الجمعيات التي تضاعفت أعدادها مرارا في العقدين الأخيرين، إلى توفير الدعم للعديد من فئات المجتمع، ومن بينها المرأة، الطفل، كبار السن، ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة، الأيتام، وغيرهم.\n\nتعتبر مدينة رام الله واحدة من المدن الفلسطينية التي يؤمها السياح، وتشكل وجهة رئيسية لهم في جولاتهم السياحية، ولا بد للسائح أن يزور مواقعها الأثرية التي تقسم إلى: أنقاض بناء أثري فيه بقايا برج من حقبة الصليبيين يقع في وسط المدينة، وآثار كنيسة بيزنطية في المدينة.\nوبالرغم من أن المدينة ليست من المدن القديمة جدا إلا أنها تعد أكثر المناطق الفلسطينية جذبا للزائرين على المستوى العالمي والعربي عامة والفلسطينيين خاصة، آخذين بعين الاعتبار أن هذه المدينة مركزا اقتصاديا مهما، وخاصة بعد أن أصبحت مقرا للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية، ومركزا للمؤسسات الأجنبية، والممثليات الدبلوماسية، كما ومقرا لمؤسسات ووزارات السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية...الخ، مما ساهم بشكل فعال في تطور هذه المدينة من كافة النواحي وخاصة سياحيا، فازدحام المدينة يعني بناء المرافق السياحية الكبيرة والحديثة القادرة على تلبية احتياجات ساكنيها، وهذا من شأنه أن يزيد الدخل القومي بشكل كبير. ويوجد في المدينة مركزا معني بالسياحة هو مركز رام الله للمعلومات السياحية الذي تأسس بدعم سويدي وبالتعاون مع وزارة السياحة الفلسطينية ومركز رواق للمعمار الشعبي. وهناك الكثير من الآثار الواقعة في قرى وبلدات قضاء رام الله، فمثلا توجد قلعة حصينة لا تزال آثارها ظاهرة حتى الآن في بيرزيت، مبنى عثماني ضخم في قرية رأس كركر، وآثار كنيسة وقطع معمارية تعود إلى الفترات البيزنطية في قرية جفنا، كما يوجد في قرية عابود الكثير من الأديرة والكنائس المندثرة منذ عهد هيلانة وإبنها قسطنطين، وفيها أيضا مسجد قديم وكنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس. ويزور رام الله سنويا 300,000 سائح. يشار إلى أن السياحة في المدينة كغيرها من مدن فلسطين، تواجه العديد من المشاكل والعقبات، ولعل أول تلك العقبات هو الاحتلال الإسرائيلي الذي يؤثر سلبا بدعاياته المغرضة على السياح الأجانب، ويسعى إلى ضرب قطاع السياحة في المدينة. كذلك ينافس الإسرائيليون السياحة الفلسطينية نظرا لخبرتهم في التسويق.\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nبدأ التعليم في رام الله في مدرسة للروم الاورثوذكس أنشاتها البطريركية في القدس حوالي 1840، عندما حضر مبشر من طائفة البروتستانت اسمه صموئيل غوبات وأسس خمس مدارس إحداها في رام الله، وهي مدرسة تبشيرية، بينما كانت الأولى الأرثوذكسية مدرسة وطنية، وظلت مدرسة غوبات مفتوحة حتى قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى، وفي سنة 1857 قدم اللاتين إلى رام الله، وافتتحوا لهم مدرسة لم تعمر طويلا، أما عن مدارس الإناث، فقد أسست جماعة الفرندز في عام 1889 أول مدرسة من نوعها للإناث في رام الله. والأولى من نوعها في فلسطين، وكان افتتاح هذه المدرسة حافزاً للروم الأرثوذكس لإنشاء مدرسة للبنات، وحذا حذوهم اللاتين، وفي عام 1901 افتتح الفرندز مدرسة البنين في رام الله.\nوفي رام الله اليوم ثلاث مدارس حكومية للذكور ومدرستان للإناث، وبعد عام 1950 افتتحت بعض المعاهد مثل معهد المعلمات الحكومي والحق بالمعهد مدرسة للتطبيقات والتجارب التربوية والتعليم فيها مختلط، ولوكالة الغوث أربع مدارس للذكور ومدرستان للإناث في رام الله كما يتبع وكالة الغوث مركز لتدريب المعلمين والفتيات وهناك سبع مدارس خاصة مختلطة وثلاث مدارس خاصة للإناث وواحدة للذكور ودار لرعاية الأحداث وكلية بيرزيت التي تحولت إلى جامعة وتعتبر من أهم الجامعات الفلسطينية.\nكما أن مدينة رام الله تعتبر مركزاً للنشاط الثقافي في الضفة الغربية إذ تمتلئ بالمسارح ودور السينما والمراكز الثقافية، وفيها المعهد الوطني للموسيقى ومجموعة كبيرة من المنتديات الثقافية.\nالتعليم العالي\nتقع في محافظة رام الله واحدة من الجامعات المميزة فلسطينيا وعربيا، وهي جامعة بيرزيت. يعود تاريخ جامعة بيرزيت إلى عام 1924 عندما تأسست كمدرسة ابتدائية، وكان الهدف الرئيسي للمدرسة توفير فرص التعليم الأولية للفتيات من بيرزيت والقرى المجاورة في وقت انعدمت فيه المدارس تقريباً في تلك المنطقة.\nتطورت المدرسة لتصبح كلية عام 1942، ولما كانت الكلية عندئذ هي المؤسسة الجامعية الوحيدة في المنطقة، فقد قررت التركيز على التعليم الجامعي، وتقرر أن تصبح الكلية نتيجة لذلك «جامعة بيرزيت» في 1972.\n\nالرياضة\nتلعب في محافظة رام الله العديد من الأندية سواء على مستوى كرة القدم أو كرة السلة، منها: مؤسسة شباب البيرة، دير عمار، الجلزون، شباب الامعري، أرثوذكسي رام الله، سلواد، بدو، بيت سيرا، وبير زيت الرياضي. ويشارك بعضها في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز. ويوجد في المدينة ملعبا بلديا يتسع لعدة الآف.\nيقام في مدينة رام الله سباق ماراثون يحمل اسم «القدس عاصمة فلسطين الأبدية»، وذلك رداً على سباق مماثل أقيم في المدينة المحتلة بمشاركة آلاف العدائين الإسرائيليين والأجانب وسط موجة غضب في الشارع الفلسطيني. كما بدأت بلدية رام الله بأعمال الإنشاء لمشروع صالة رام الله الرياضية. ويأتي مشروع الصالة الرياضية كجزء من الخطة التنموية للبلدية.\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من رام الله الكثير من المشاهير الفلسطينيين منهم:\n\nكمال ناصر: سياسي وشاعر فلسطيني شارك في إصدار جريدة (البعث) كما أصدر مجلة الجيل الجديد عام 1949 في القدس. انتخب عام 1969 عضواً في اللجنة التنفيذية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، واغتيل من قبل قوة كوماندوز إسرائيلية وهناك قاعة ومسرح يحملان اسمه في جامعة بيرزيت.\nكريم حنا خلف: ترأس مجلس بلدية رام الله عام 1972 بعد فوزه بالانتخابات. كان عضوا بارزا في الجبهة الوطنية الفلسطينية وقياديا بارزا في لجنة التوجيه الوطني التي كانت تشرف بتوجيه من منظمة التحرير على النضال الوطني ضد الاحتلال.\nموسى حديد: مهندس، شغل منصب رئيس مجلس بلدي رام الله بين عامي 2012 و2022. كما يرأس الاتحاد الفلسطيني للهيئات المحلية للدورة الثانية على التوالي.\nخليل أبو ريا: مدرس وأديب ومرب معروف في رام الله إذ ترك أثرا كبيرا في عقول ونفوس وذكريات الكثيرين من أبناء هذه المدينة. وضع كتابا بعنوان «رام الله قديما وحديثا». وهو المؤسس والمالك للكلية الوطنية، أهم مدارس رام الله.\nفؤاد عيسى شطارة: طبيب فلسطيني. اهتم بالقضايا الوطنية والسياسية وشارك في تأسيس الجمعية التهذيبية السورية التي اهتمت بتعليم الطلاب العرب المتفوقين من الفقراء. وترأس جمعية النهضة الفلسطينية للدفاع عن قضية فلسطين كما ترأس عام 1936 الجامعة العربية في نيويورك.\nبولس شحادة: كاتب وصحفي، أسس جريدة مرآة الشرق في القدس 1919 وهي جريدة يومية سياسية اجتماعية تصدر باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية.\nنسيب شاهين: قام بتأليف كتاب مصور عن رام الله احتوى 445 صورة من أصل 600 صورة.\nمصطفى البرغوثي: أمين عام المبادرة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتميم البرغوثي: أحد أشهر الشعراء الشباب في فلسطين والوطن العربي. وهو ابن الشاعر مريد البرغوثي والكاتبة رضوى عاشور.\nمروان البرغوثي قيادي في حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني فتح، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nأحمد سعدات: أمين عام الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nحنان عشراوي: سياسية فلسطينية، كانت أحد أعضاء الوفد الفلسطيني المفاوض في مؤتمر مدريد عام 1991.\nسعاد العامري: أحد أشهر المعماريات الفلسطينيات. تعمل على الحفاظ على الموروث المعماري الفلسطيني من خلال مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\" والذي تديره منذ 1991.\nمحمد صالح البرغوثي أسس الجمعية العربية السرية ثم أسس حزب البعث في فلسطين وأصبح رئيساً له ثم اتجه إلى الحزب الوطني ثم إلى حزب الاستقلال، توفى عام 1970.\nخليل محمد عيسى أحد قادة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى.\n\nالمعالم\nرام الله تحت الاحتلال\nمنذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية للفلسطينيين ضد الاحتلال الإسرائيلي واجتياح جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مدن الضفة الغربية في خريف عام 2000، كانت مدينة رام الله من المدن الرئيسية في مواجهة العمليات الإسرائيلية بعد مدن جنين، نابلس، طولكرم، الخليل، هذا وقد فرضت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية حظر التجول على المدينة، وخنقت سكانها وعزلتهم عن مدينة القدس حيث يقطن الكثير من أقربائهم.\nو تعيش مدينة رام الله اليوم ظروف صعبة، بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي ومصادرة الكثير من أراضيها من قبل الاحتلال بواسطة جدار الفصل العنصري، والمستوطنين اليهود.\nومع مرور سنوات عديدة على الانتفاضة الثانية، إلا أن مدينة رام الله وأهلها نجحوا في الحفاظ على نشاط اقتصادي عالي وثقافي مميز، مما جعل المدينة أفضل المدن الفلسطينية حالا في ظل الاحتلال.\n\nالمخيمات\nيوجد في منطقة رام الله، 4 مخيمات 3 منها مُسجلة رسميا في وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) وواحد غير مسجل، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفة الغربية، فقد بُني معظمها فوق قطعة من الأرض قامت الأونروا باستئجارها من الحكومة الأردنية. والمخيمات هي:\n\nمخيم الأمعري: قام الصليب الأحمر بتأسيس مخيم الأمعري في عام 1949 ضمن حدود بلدية البيرة، حيث قام بتوفير الخيام للاجئين الذين قدموا من مدن اللد ويافا والرملة، بالإضافة إلى الذين لجئوا من قرى بيت دجن ودير طريف وأبو شوشة والنعاني وصيدون وجمزو وبيت نبالا. وقد تسلمت الأونروا مسؤولية المخيم في عام 1950 وعملت على بناء وحدات سكنية ذات أسقف اسمنتية. وبحلول عام 1957، كانت الأونروا قد أتمت استبدال كافة الخيام بالمساكن الاسمنتية؛ حيث حصلت العائلات التي لا يزيد عدد أفرادها عن خمسة أشخاص على مسكن مؤلف من غرفة واحدة فيما حصلت العائلات الأكبر على مساكن من غرفتين. واليوم، فإن المخيم يغطي مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,93 كيلومتر مربع، ويفصل بين معظم المساكن مساحة تقل عن نصف متر؛ الأمر الذي يجعل التهوية داخل المخيم ضعيفة للغاية. ويرتبط المخيم بشكل كامل بشبكتي الماء والكهرباء البلدية.\nمخيم الجلزون: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.25 كيلومتر مربع على تلة صخرية تبعد مسافة 7 كيلومترات شمال رام الله. وينحدر أصل سكان المخيم من 36 قرية تابعة لمناطق اللد والرملة. وأصبح المخيم تحت السيطرة الإسرائيلية الفلسطينية المشترك في أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو. وتتصل كافة المساكن بالبنية التحتية لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامة.\nمخيم دير عمار: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.16 كيلومتر مربع على بعد 30 كيلومتر إلى الشمال الغربي من رام الله. وقد بني المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض تعود ملكيتها لسكان قرية دير عمار غير اللاجئين. وفي المقابل، فإن منشآت الأونروا في المخيم تعمل على توفير خدماتها للقرويين من غير اللاجئين.\nوتنحدر أصول سكان المخيم من القرى المدمرة التابعة لمناطق الرملة ويافا واللد. وفي أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو، أصبح المخيم واقعا تحت السيطرة المشتركة الفلسطينية الإسرائيلية.\n\nمخيم قدورة: يقع داخل مدينة رام الله بالقرب من مستشفى رام الله الحكومي من جهة الشمال، يبلغ عدد سكانه في منتصف العام 2023 نحو 1040 لاجئ حسب تقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. معظم سكان المخيم من المدن والقرى المهجرة عام 1948 منها: دير طريف، واللد، والسافرية، وبيت نبالا، والرملة، ولفتا، وأبو غوش، والقباب، ويافا، وسلمة، وزكريا، والحديثة، وعمواس، ويالو؛ ومن نازحي عام 1967.\n\nالمستوطنات\nما ان اندلعت حرب 1967 والتي كانت نتائجها احتلال ما تبقى من ارض فلسطين - الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، حتى سارعت إسرائيل في وضع الخطط بهدف اقامة العديد من المستوطنات. وكانت رام الله جزءا من هذا المخطط، حيث بنت إسرائيل في منطقة رام الله حوالي 27 مستوطنة وهي:\nمستوطنات تتوسط مجموعة من البلدات الفلسطينية وهي: المدية، نعلين، دير قديس، حزما، عين حارث، بلعين، أم صفا وبيت سيرا:\n\nمكابيم أب\nكفار روث\nمستوطنة منورة\nشلتا نتتياهو\nحشمونائيم\nكريات سيفر\nوهناك مستوطنات تطوق مدينة رام الله وتسيطر على معظم أراضيها، وهي من الشرق:\n\nتلمون\nياد يائير\nبيت حورون\nجفعات زئيف\nبيت إيل\nبسجوت\nكوخاف يعقوب\nومن الجنوب:\n\nمستوطنة عطروت\nجفعون\nجفعات حداشا أ\nجبعات حدشاة ب\nأما التجمع الاستيطاني شمال شرق رام الله، فيضم مستوطنات: عوفرا، بيت إيل أ، بيت إيل بمعسكر (باعل حتسور)، الذي يطل على منطقة الأغوار الوسطى وأريحا والبحر الميت، على ارتفاع 800 متر عن سطح البحر، وهو ذو أهمية إستراتيجية؛ نظراً لارتفاعه وإشرافه على مساحات واسعة من مناطق وسط الضفة، ويبلغ عدد المستوطنين في ذلك التجمع نحو 5370 مستوطناً. ويشغل مساحة تبلغ أكثر من 2000 دونم.\n\nمدن متوأمة\nالمدن الشقيقة لرام الله هي:\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\n\nموقع بلدية رام الله\nغرفة تجارة وصناعة محافظة رام

          "content": "Ramallah (en arabe : رام الله) est une ville palestinienne située au centre de la Cisjordanie, territoire occupé par Israël depuis 1967. Elle est la capitale administrative de facto de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne ; la capitale officielle, Jérusalem-Est, ayant été annexée par Israël en 1982.\nLa population, initialement composée principalement de Palestiniens chrétiens, comprend, depuis 1948, de nombreux réfugiés musulmans issus de toute la Palestine. L'estimation de la population de la ville, pour 2025, est de 45 644 habitants. Ses habitants s'appellent les Ramallawi.\nYasser Arafat est inhumé dans un mausolée situé dans l'enceinte de la Mouqata'a, quartier général de l'Autorité palestinienne, situé dans la ville.\n\nHistoire\nLes premiers temps\nLa ville de Ramallah fut fondée au milieu du XVe siècle par les Haddadéens, tribu issue des Arabes chrétiens ghassanides. Les Haddadéens, menés par Rached Haddadéen, sont arrivés de l'Est du Jourdain, près de l'emplacement contemporain de la ville jordanienne de Chawbak. La migration de cette tribu est due aux nombreux combats et tensions entre les clans de cette région.\nSelon la légende locale, le frère de Rached, Sabri l'Haddadéen, accueillait l'émir Ibn Kaysoom, chef d'un puissant clan musulman, quand la femme de Sabri donna naissance à une fille. Selon la coutume, l'émir proposa qu'elle se marie à son tout jeune fils quand ils seraient tous deux adultes. Sabri crut que cette proposition n'était pas sérieuse, les mariages entre chrétiens et musulmans étant rares, et lui donna sa parole. Des années après, quand l'émir revint voir les Haddadéens pour qu'ils tiennent leur promesse, ils refusèrent. Ceci déclencha une guerre sanglante entre les deux familles. Les Haddadéens fuirent vers l'ouest et s'établirent dans les collines de Ramallah, où vivaient déjà quelques familles musulmanes.\n\nInstallation chrétienne\nTout au long des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, Ramallah s'agrandit pour devenir un village agricole, attirant ainsi davantage d'habitants (surtout chrétiens) de toute la région. Au début du XVIIIe siècle, la première église orthodoxe arabe est bâtie, puis une autre en 1807. Il y a entre huit-cents et neuf-cents habitants en 1838.\nL'église de l'Épiphanie, édifiée pour remplacer l'ancienne en 1852, est la seule église orthodoxe à Ramallah aujourd'hui. Durant cette décennie, l'Église catholique s'établit dans la ville, devenant le deuxième groupe chrétien à Ramallah. Elle établit l'école de filles Saint-Joseph, ainsi que le lycée mixte al-Ahliyyah, tenu par les religieuses du Rosaire.\nLes quakers anglais arrivent en 1869 et ouvrent une école de filles et un internat d'une quinzaine de garçons en 1901.\n\nÉglises de Ramallah\nÉglise Notre-Dame-de-l'Annonciation (melkite) 1895\nÉglise de l'Épiphanie (grecque-orthodoxe)\nÉglise de la Sainte-Famille (catholique latine)\nCathédrale copte-orthodoxe\nÉglise de l'Espérance (luthérienne-évangélique)\nMaison de prières des quakers\n\nDébut du XXe siècle\nLes autorités ottomanes construisent en 1901 une nouvelle route de Jérusalem à Naplouse passant par Ramallah et Al-Bireh. La jeunesse chrétienne de la ville commence à émigrer aux États-Unis au début du XXe siècle. La ville devient un district en 1902, englobant trente villages et bourgades des alentours.\nLa ville de Ramallah devient une municipalité en 1908 et Élias Odeh en est le premier maire. Le conseil municipal est composé de membres de chaque grande famille.\nAu début de la Première Guerre mondiale, les habitants se rebellent contre l'autorité ottomane. Trente habitants sont tués. En 1915, une invasion de criquets migrateurs détruit les récoltes et l'année suivante, une épidémie de typhoïde décime 30 % de la population.\n\nOccupation britannique et débuts de l'État d'Israël\nRamallah, comme toutes les localités palestiniennes, est sous l'autorité du mandat britannique à partir de novembre 1917 (le mandat est imposé en 1920, auparavant ce sont des forces d'occupation), jusqu'en 1948, date de la fondation de l'État d'Israël. L'électrification de la ville est totalement terminée en 1936. Des milliers de réfugiés, majoritairement musulmans, s'installent aux abords de la ville en 1948.\nRamallah fait partie des Territoires occupés après la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nSous l'influence des migrations de réfugiés palestiniens, musulmans et chrétiens, de nouvelles mosquées et églises sont construites. La mosquée Jamal-Abdel-Nasser dans la ville adjacente de Al-Bireh est l'une des plus grandes de l'agglomération. Les coptes-orthodoxes ont construit une nouvelle église sur les hauteurs de la ville. Il existe aussi une église melkite catholique, une église luthérienne-évangélique, une église épiscopalienne, une église baptiste, etc. Les chrétiens représentent aujourd'hui 25 % de la population de l'agglomération totale et les réfugiés palestiniens 60 % (surtout aux abords de la ville).\n\nRamallah après 1972\nEn 1967, à la suite de la Guerre des Six Jours, tous les territoires palestiniens sont conquis par Israël. Les premières élections municipales depuis le début de l'occupation ont lieu en 1972. Dix ans plus tard, le maire Karim Khalaf est victime d'une tentative d'assassinat par des extrémistes israéliens, tout comme le maire de Naplouse et le maire d'Al-Bireh[réf. souhaitée]. Le conseil municipal suspend son administration.\n\nLa première intifada éclate en 1987. La même année, la première opération à cœur ouvert à l'hôpital est réalisée par le docteur Shawqi Harb.\nL'armée israélienne évacue Ramallah en 1996 et l'Autorité palestinienne installe son administration, un nouveau conseil municipal est réuni.\n\nLa seconde intifada commence en 2000 et se poursuit jusqu'en 2005. En 2002, le quartier commence à être bombardé. Bien que cette solution soit considérée à la base comme provisoire, Ramallah est devenue de facto la capitale de l'Autorité palestinienne. En décembre 2001, Arafat tient des réunions à la Mouqata'a, tout en vivant avec sa femme et sa fille à Gaza. Après des attentats suicides à Haïfa, Arafat est obligé de rester dans l'enceinte du gouvernement à Ramallah.\nLa région fait face à la pression continue de la colonisation israélienne. En 2023, les habitants de la plupart des communautés du territoire situé entre Ramallah et Jéricho, d'une superficie de 150 000 dounams [15 000 hectares], ont été contraints de fuir lorsque les colons, notamment les Jeunes des collines, ont commencé à construire rapidement des avant-postes pastoraux et à commettre des violences contre les résidents avec le soutien de Tsahal et des institutions de l'État israélien.\n\nÉconomie\nCette ancienne petite ville chrétienne est l'épicentre de l'activité économique palestinienne, laquelle doit beaucoup à l'aide internationale et aux capitaux de la diaspora. La ville doit aussi beaucoup au Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne Salam Fayyad, artisan de son essor fulgurant.\nTrois cent cinquante salariés travaillent à l'usine Coca-Cola de Ramallah. La firme américaine est ainsi l'un des plus gros employeurs de la ville.\n\nDescription de la ville\nÀ Ramallah, fulgurant développement économique et fulgurant développement démographique vont de pair. La ville, qui attire les habitants d'autres cités de Cisjordanie (Naplouse, Jéricho, Hébron…) ne cesse de croître. Surtout en hauteur, car les restrictions imposées par Israël rendent presque impossible toute construction en périphérie.\nLa ville est un chantier à ciel ouvert. La frénésie immobilière ne connaît pas de répit et la spéculation fait flamber les prix : le montant du mètre carré a triplé entre 2005 et 2010. La croissance de la demande de logements est de nature exponentielle. Mais l'offre reste très limitée : les contraintes administratives imposées par Israël sont très lourdes, l'État hébreu ne délivre les permis de construire qu'au compte-gouttes, et dans des zones très restreintes.\nRamallah est devenue une capitale de facto, hébergeant les institutions politiques : résidence du président de l'Autorité palestinienne Mahmoud Abbas, QG de l'Autorité palestinienne, ministères…\nLa ville n'en reste pas moins une enclave dont on s'évade très difficilement. À chaque entrée de la ville, des barrages de Tsahal, l'armée israélienne, filtrent les allées et venues des Palestiniens. Du moins, ceux qui disposent d'un permis pour sortir. Au check point de Qalandia, principal passage vers Jérusalem, on reconnaît les véhicules autorisés à quitter la Cisjordanie à leur plaque jaune (israéliennes). Les plaques vertes (palestiniennes), elles, ne permettent aucune incursion en territoire israélien. À Qalandia, l'attente est souvent interminable, une heure trente en moyenne, pour parcourir les dix kilomètres qui séparent Ramallah de Jérusalem.\n\nCulture\nLe théâtre Al-Kasaba est un organisme culturel de cinéma, de théâtre, de musique et de danse créé en 1970.\nDepuis 2004, le centre culturel franco-allemand de Ramallah réunit deux structures en un seul lieu : l'Institut Goethe des Territoires palestiniens et une antenne de l'Institut français de Jérusalem. En plus de proposer aux Ramallawi l’apprentissage des langues de Molière et de Goethe, cet ICFA abrite un Makerspace, un studio d’enregistrement, un espace scénique et le Kultur Cafe.\n\nMusique\nDans les camps de réfugiés de Jénine, Deir Ghassaneh, Kalandia et Jalazone, en Cisjordanie mais aussi de Chatila et de Bourj el-Barajneh à Beyrouth, l'école de musique de l'association Al Kamandjâti, fondée à Angers en 2002 et installée à Ramallah en 2008 par Ramzi Aburedwan, forme des apprentis interprètes. Plus de 150 élèves s'inscrivent chaque année aux cours de théorie de la musique et d’apprentissage d'un ou plusieurs instruments. L'association fournit instruments, pupitres et partitions. Les cours sont assurés par des musiciens étrangers comme ceux de l'Orchestre arabo-andalou d'Anjou, de l'Orchestre de chambre de Paris ou comme le chef Diego Masson qui encadrent les jeunes bénévolement. Des concerts sont organisés en Cisjordanie mais parfois aussi en Israël, souvent annulés en raison des conflits.\nUn concert hautement symbolique a eu lieu en août 2005, à Ramallah : celui de l'Orchestre Divan occidental-oriental, dirigé par Daniel Barenboïm et cofondé par Edward Saïd (décédé en 2003), qui rassemble de jeunes musiciens Israéliens, Arabes et Espagnols[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGouvernement\nAujourd'hui Ramallah est la ville où se trouve le plus de sièges des missions diplomatiques auprès de l'Autorité palestinienne. C'est le cas de l'Afrique du Sud, l'Allemagne, l'Argentine, l'Australie, l'Autriche, le Brésil, le Canada, la Chine, la Corée du Sud, le Danemark, la Finlande, l'Inde, l'Irlande, le Japon, la Jordanie, le Mexique, la Norvège, les Pays-Bas, la Pologne, le Portugal, la Russie, le Sri Lanka, la Suisse et la République tchèque.\n\nPersonnalités\nYasser Arafat (1929-2004), activiste et homme d'État palestinien.

          "content": "## Overview\nRamallah or Ram Allah (Arabic رام الله Rāmallāh) is a small city in the West Bank region of the Palestinian Territories, located 15 km (10 miles) north of Jerusalem. Since the inception of the Palestinian National Authority, Ramallah has acted as the de facto capital city of the Palestinian administration. The neighboring town of Al-Bireh has over the years fused together with Ramallah and is covered in this article too.\n\n## Understand\nModern Ramallah was founded in the mid-16th century by the Haddadins, a Jordanian tribe of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christian Arabs. The Haddadins, led by Rashid Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River near the Jordanian town of Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is blamed for fighting and unrest among clans in that area. According to living descendants of the original Haddadin family members, Rahid's brother Sabra Haddadin was hosting Emir Ibn Kaysoom, head of a powerful Muslim clan in the region, when Sabra's wife gave birth to a baby girl. According to custom, the Emir proposed a betrothal to his own young son when they came of age. Sabra believed the proposal was in jest, as Muslim-Christian marriages were not customary, and gave his word. When the Emir later came to the Haddadins and demanded that they fulfill their promise, they refused. This set off bloody conflict between the two families. The Haddadins fled west and settled on the hilltops of Ramallah, where only a few Muslim families lived at the time. Today the town has a Muslim majority, but Ramallah retains its title as a historically Christian Palestinian town.\nIn 2017, the city had a population of 39,000, and the metro area 153,000.\nRamallah is known for its religiously relaxed atmosphere; alcohol flows freely and movie theaters and the cafes along its main streets are well attended. Ramallah is, without question, the cultural capital of the West Bank, with a highly educated and fashionable population. It is also the hub of Palestinian feminist activity; the city's women frequently attend university rather than marrying early, and several cafes run exclusively by women are used to fund local feminist organizations.\nWhile there, it is easy to make small talk with the locals. Unless you are firmly anti-Israeli occupation, it is advisable that you do more listening than actual talking yourself, however. For the most part, Palestinians are glad to share their problems and plight with any western visitors.\n\n## Get in\nTourists with passports outside the Middle East have no problem entering or exiting Ramallah. Make sure to have your passport and visa stamp with you. Even though you will probably not need your passport to enter, you will be required to show your passport and stamp in order to re-enter Israel. Once through the checkpoint, it is a short drive to downtown Ramallah. Bear in mind that it is illegal for Israelis to enter Ramallah, under Israeli law.\nOn the way back, if you have an Israeli visa stamp or visa paper with your passport from when you arrived in Israel, then just stay on the bus as it arrives at Kalandia. (Many passengers will get off here to go through a different security check.) A couple of border guards will come on to the bus to check passenger ID documents. They will probably speak English well and may ask some questions about where you are from.\n\n## By bus\nThere is 31.9054935.20711 one bus station on Al-Nahder St. that serves buses from Nablus, and probably other destinations north. There are at least three other bus stations in the city which also serve various destinations. Nevertheless, they are all pretty close to each other.\nFrom Jerusalem the best connection to Ramallah is bus/sherut/serves 218 (and sometimes 219). It departs from the Nablus Road station close to Damascus Gate on Nablus Rd (aka Derech Shchem) and will take you all the way to before mentioned bus station near the central square of al-Manara. The price is ₪10-20, and it takes around 45 minutes.\nFrom Bethlehem take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the Bethlehem bus station at Manger St. in the center. The trip takes 45 min all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the central roundabout with the garden in the middle. The taxis are waiting on the western side of the roundabout. To increase your \"luck\", you can also wait at the roundabout out of the city with the mosque. Even hitchhiking from there makes sense. The trip to Ramallah takes less than an hour for less than ₪15. The exact price is listed in the tourist information on the central roundabout in Jericho centre.\nFrom Nablus the trip is ₪10.5 and it takes about an hour. Ask around from which bus station in Nablus the correct (big) bus starts.\nIt is worth asking the drivers before you get on to double-check the bus is going to the right destination. You might be surprised how many of them can speak basic English. There are two main types of buses. There are small ones with about 20 seats, and biggers ones that look more like coaches and are much more comfortable. They all cost the same, and there is usually a rush of passengers pushing their way onto the buses.\n\n## By taxi\nFrom Jerusalem's Damascus Gate you can find taxis to Ramallah for approximately ₪80-100 depending on your bargaining skills. You can also take a taxi to Kalandia checkpoint and walk through, picking up another taxi on the other side. It costs about ₪30 from Kalandia to Ramallah centre.\n\n## By car\nHeading north from Jerusalem on road #60, you will arrive to Ramallah very quickly. You will have to pass one Israeli checkpoint on the way: Kalandia.\n\n## By plane\nThere is no airport with scheduled passenger flights in the West Bank, so the only nearby passenger airports are Ben Gurion Airport in Lod, then heading towards Jerusalem  or Queen Alia in Amman then heading towards Allenby Bridge aka King Hussein Bridge and passing through it - Visa on arrival for Israel is available for most common nationalities. Ovda Airport near Eilat also sees international flights, but the connection from there to Ramallah is not all that straightforward and more time-consuming.\n\n## Get around\nIt is easy to find a taxi to get around Ramallah (for ₪10 fixed charge, or the amount specified by the fare-meter). Car rentals are also available, but seldom needed. As the city center is relatively small, it is not hard to walk to most destinations downtown (including the old city.) Service shuttles (shared taxis) are also available from downtown to most suburbs and to the outskirts of the city at relatively low prices (₪2.5 inside the city and up to ₪6 to nearby towns and villages). Make sure to confirm a price before getting into a taxi.\n\n## See\nThe city is one of the most vibrant ones in the West Bank. In Ramallah, a few historic and religious sites are present. However, the downtown streets are a must see during the day, as the city is often really congested.\nHisbeh produce market, see below.\n31.9045635.197271 Old City.

If you are visiting Ramallah, it is probable that you are doing so for political, business, and/or humanitarian reasons - expect to have lots of staring, curious (but always friendly) eyes looking at you as you walk through town.\n31.891735.19091 Ramallah Cultural Palace. The main venue for performances and concerts within the city.    (updated Aug 2023)\nJoin a protest, info@hostelinramallah.com.

Hostel in Ramallah has different tours, twice per week they organize trip to one of the protests and Hebron city. Keep in mind that you would protest at your own risk.\nTurkish bath (in the twin-city of El-Bireh). A good destination for foreigners wanting to relax for the day. .\n\n## Learn\nRamallah is the home of the Friends School in the Palestinian Territories. The school has two campuses, one for grades 1-6 and is located near the old city. The other is for grades 7-12 and is located near the old police station destroyed by an Israeli air strike. The schools are famous for their international learning environment, intensive English language focus, and liberal learning atmosphere. The schools are private and have a number of notable Palestinian alumni.\nThe city also has a number of public and private schools that serve a good number of the West Bank youth population. Private schools with specific religious affiliations can also be found.\nIn the twin city of El-Bireh, there is also a school for the blind that also serves as a vocational center.\nBirzeit University, which is in the neighboring town of Birzeit, is one of the Palestinian Authority's leading educational institutions. The University offers a large number of study options and at different levels for students.

The PAS (Palestinian and Arab Studies) program is popular with internationals visiting or working in the West Bank who want to learn Arabic and take classes on the history and politics of the Palestinian Authority.\nThe city also has branches for Al-Quds Open University, which offers continuing education opportunities to many Palestinians.\nThere are a number of vocational training centers in the city, neighboring towns, and refugee camps.\n\n## Work\nRamallah is a vibrant Palestinian business hub, especially as most international agencies and governmental offices are located in the city. However, with the immigration of Palestinians from other cities in the West Bank to Ramallah, there is a highly competitive job market and many Palestinians, especially young men come to the city seeking work.\nThe most popular career portal In Ramallah and Palestine is Jobs in Palestine[dead link]. Here you can find most jobs advertised by INGOs, NGOs, and local companies.\nMajor working opportunities in Ramallah include information technology, pharmaceuticals, development cooperation, and the public sector. Restaurant and coffee shop jobs are also available, mainly during the summer. Agricultural jobs are minimal in the city, but a few can be sought in neighboring villages.\nFor foreigners, work opportunities tend to include consultancies in certain private sector markets - IT is most common. The vast majority of foreigners working in Ramallah are doing development or humanitarian work. A significant number are focused on human rights and advocacy. A number of UN agencies work directly in the West Bank and many, such as the UNDP, maintain office in Ramallah.\nVolunteering opportunities are common in small and medium-sized Palestinian NGOs as well as some international NGOs. Volunteering is an excellent way to get to understand an organisation and the field they operate in. Most local NGOs will appreciate foreign volunteers, particularly if they have good written English skills, enabling them to support fundraising work. Volunteers are often paid small sums to cover basic travel costs but this varies. If you are planning to volunteer, have enough money to support yourself as Ramallah is not a cheap place to live. you could also volunteer in some new small projects as the first youth hostel in the city (Hostel in Ramallah) and through the hostel there are some other projects as an organic farm or refuge camps http://hostelinramallah.com\n\n## Buy\nThere's not a huge amount to do in Ramallah if you are just visiting. A great way to spend your time could be to dip in and out of shops. Shop-keepers are among the most ready-to-talk and many have colourful lives. It gives you a good reason to walk around and take your time.\nYou will never find everything under one roof, but for a basket of common necessities, you will need to visit a baker, grocer, butcher, pharmacy and mini-market. Ramallah city centre, despite the development and growth of some new stores retains a small-town feel due to the protections for tenants that mean many shops have been in the same location for decades (rent agreed at the outset cannot be increased, so in many cases is only a few USD per year).\n31.9045935.206031 Hisbeh produce market (Souq) (near the main bus station and the central mosque, about 150 m away from al-Manara Square (the centre of Ramallah)).

The staple is 'kmaaj' or pitta bread. A bakery in the Old City (Ramallah Tahta) produces brown kmaaj and sliced bread.\nAlso the Arabic variety of ice cream in many places in Ramallah is worth trying - a very different and more gooey and sticky version of what is available in the west. Regular ice cream can be found everywhere also. Try Rukab's and Baladna ice cream shops on the main street.\nThere are a huge number of falafel and shawarma places on all of the main streets.

Homemade pastries, manakeesh, salads, sandwiches, desserts, cakes, fresh juices, hot and soft drinks, and shisha. (updated May 2018)\n\n## Drink\nAlthough predominately Muslim, Ramallah is still a Christian town, hence Ramallah's large restaurants usually serve alcohol. Expect a selection of imported beers (Heineken, Corona, etc.), spirits, and perhaps red or white wine. Do not display public intoxication, as at best, it is rude and inconsiderate to your Muslim hosts. At worst, it could be dangerous.\nThe city's active nightlife and its relatively liberal culture makes it a hot destination for visitors from other cities including Jerusalem during the weeknights and weekends.\nDuring the night, a good number of shops are still open, especially during the summer. A common habit of the citizens of the city is going out for a drink, dinner, or an argila (flavoured tobacco waterpipe). The city's various coffee shops, bars, and restaurants are a must see/visit.

The term Argila is often used in Ramallah to describe the waterpipes, while shishah is also used at some places. You might even see a 'hookah' or 'Hubbly Bubbly'. You can also smoke arghila in almost any restaurant, although some have special areas for them.\nYou can order normal ('aadi') or fresh ('fresh'). Fresh means the tobacco is placed in a piece of fruit like an orange (or even a watermelon). It has a smoother flavour but is more expensive. You should also choose your flavour. Common flavours are double-apple ('tufateen') and lemon and mint ('limun-w-nana').\nDepending on the location and type of restaurant of cafe, the price of smoking a nice and soothing tobacco waterpipe costs anywhere between ₪8-30.

(updated Nov 2017)\n\n## Stay safe\nGenerally speaking, Ramallah is safe for non-Israeli foreigners. The Palestinian residents are usually quite happy to have foreign nationals visit them. Theft is relatively rare, although do not interpret that statement as an OK to let your guard down.\nBear in mind that although Ramallah has been under military occupation for a long time, the city is relatively stable. However, very rarely the Israeli military enters the city to arrest wanted Palestinians. This usually only happens in the dead of night, and they disappear before anyone realizes that they were there. However, the Israeli military can enter Ramallah bluntly, and in large numbers. If this should happen while you are staying in Ramallah, do what the majority of Palestinians do, and stay inside until they leave and away from any soldiers or military vehicles. Do not assume that just because you are a foreign national that you will be safe.\nThat said, Ramallah hasn't seen any widespread violence since 2006 and it is highly unlikely to happen (unless there are escalations with Israel, which will be very apparent via international media). In the cases where the Israelis enter, it is usually to arrest a wanted Palestinian in an outskirts refugee camp in the middle of the night. They will rarely enter the city centre, so as to avoid an unnecessary confrontation with large crowds of civilians.\n\n## Diplomatic liaisons\nOffice of China, No.52 Al-Tira Street, ☏ +970 2 295 1222, fax: +970 2 295 1221, chinaemb_ps@mfa.gov.cn.

          "content": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEtymology\nJenin has been identified as the place \"Gina\" or \"Ginah\" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning \"the spring of gardens\" or \"the spring of Ganim\", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city's ancient name.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nJenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as \"Ein Ganim\", \"Beth Hagan\", \"Ginah\", and \"Ginae\", along other names.\nTell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district. The tell is also known as Tell el-Nawar, a term derived from the Arabic word for \"gypsies,\" due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.\n\nBronze Age\nJenin has been identified as the place Gina or Ginah mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\n\nIron Age\nJenin is identical to Ein-Ganim, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with Beth-Haggan, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah's flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as Gini.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nJosephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions Ginae as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, Ginae was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.\nBiblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, \"the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive\", was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke's Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.\nCeramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, \"is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance\".\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major), to distinguish it from the town of Zir'in, which they called Petit Grin. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nShortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as \"a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.\" In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.\nIn 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) \"to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of 'Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.\" As one of the stations of the Mamluk barid (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun's son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1299–1309, 1310–1341), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans' drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as \"an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water\" north of Qaqun \"on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]\". He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a nahiya (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.\nThe tax registers from 1548 to 1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed sanjak-bey (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun sanjak-bey in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.\nThe Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town's Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and sanjak-beys of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it \"does not exist anymore\". No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.\nIn the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the mallakin (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Jenin as \"The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.\"\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on \"an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage\" that caused the British administration \"grave concern\", according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya'bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\nThe village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.\n\nIsraeli occupation 1967 to 2020\nJenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.\nOn 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.\nAccording to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.\nAccording to the BBC, the city is \"Known among Palestinians\" as \"the Martyrs' capital\", but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.\nDuring the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians,  were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.\nDuring a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.\n\nIn the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.\n\nIsraeli occupation in the 2020s\nOn 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.\nOn 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.\nOn 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city's refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled \"militants\", were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said \"The operation is progressing as planned,\" and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a \"center for terrorist activity\" thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.\nOn 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nGaza war\nDuring the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.\nJenin was severely damaged during the Gaza war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.\n\nIn late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that \"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.\" The governor of Jenin said that \"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.\" The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is \"not extremely different from regular activity\". At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying \"a dead and a wounded person\", leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.\nAlso in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures\".\nIn December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called \"Protect the Homeland\". The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.\nOn January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin were ongoing as of late February 2025. Around 100 homes had been demolished, residents were being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks had been deployed.\n\nGeography\nJenin is situated at the foot of the rugged northernmost hills (Jabal Nablus) of the West Bank, and along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amer), which the city overlooks. Its highest elevation is about 250 meters above sea level and its lowest areas are 90 meters above sea level. Immediately southwest of Jenin is the Sahl Arraba plain (Dothan Valley), while further south is the Marj Sanur valley.

Six seats each were won by Hamas and the local coalition of Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Jenin was one of several Palestinian cities where Hamas showed a dramatic growth in electoral support.\n Hadem Rida was then elected as Mayor of the city, until he was arrested by the Israel Forces and spent 3 years in jail. After his release, he resigned from the position and went back to practice in his clinic in Jenin city.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jenin had a population of 49,908, the Jenin Refugee Camp of 10,417 on 373 dunams (92 acres).

According to local traditions, he was a descendant of Ali Zayn al-Abidin, the grandson of Muhammad and the sixth Sh'ia Imam. According to a local tradition, Sheikh Izz al-Din fought alongside Saladin against the Crusaders. The tomb possibly predates the cemetery, which served as a burial site for the people of Jenin and the Turabay dynasty.

          "summary": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.",

          "content": "جِنِين مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة جنين وأكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفة الغربية المحتلة التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية. تعتبر تاريخيًا، إحدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافة 75 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الأردن من ناحية الشرق، ومرج بن عامر إلى جهة الشمال.\nبالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبة مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلا اقتصاديا أكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 48,479 نسمة بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 آلاف نسمة، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا أو طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، أما المحافظة فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمة.\nتصل مساحة مدينة جنين وحدها إلى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس أكبر مدينة فلسطينية في الضفة الغربية بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحة محافظة جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا أي 9,7% من مساحة الضفة الغربية الإجمالية. يتبع المدينة مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينة عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والآشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن الكنعانيين هم من أسسها في حدود سنة 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من أقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال مأهولة بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينة بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر أخصب أراضي فلسطين التاريخية، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطية.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تارة تنهض وتارة أخرى تنتكس، إلا أن المدينة ازدهرت في أواخر الحكم العثماني وتأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياة في جنين بصورة متسارعة عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين إليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمة بين المدن الكبرى بالضفة الغربية في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينة جنين شأن عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بداية الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبة لإسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركة عدد كبير من أبناءها في العمل المسلح ضد إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضة الثانية.\n\nتسمية\nتقوم مدينة جنين على الأرض التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جنيم» وتعني بالكنعانية عين الجنائن. لذلك سُميت بهذا الاسم بسبب الجنائن التي تحيط بها.\nذًُكرت مدينة «عين جنيم» في التوراة على أنها إحدى المدن التي سكنها اللاويون المنتمين لقبيلة «إسحقكر»، والذين غيروا اسمها إلى «جنّت» بعد بضع سنوات من استقرارهم بها. وفي كتابات أخرى يُرمز إلى المدينة باسم «جيني»، ويذكر المؤرخ اليهودي «يوسيفوس فلافيوس» أن مدينة جنين كانت إحدى مدن شمال السامرة.\n\nتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nتوفرت في موقع جنين المظاهر الطبيعية اللازمة لأي استقرار بشري، ففيه توفر الماء والسهل والجبل والأودية والكهوف، وبالتالي وفر هذا الموقع الماء والغذاء والمأوى والطريق. وعليه فليس من المستغرب أن يكون الإنسان الأول قد أقام في هذا الموقع ولا سيما أنه اكتشفت بقايا الإنسان الأول في جبل الكرمل القريب من موقع جنين، وفي نفس الوقت ليس هناك ما يحول دون انتقال ذلك الإنسان من جبل الكرمل إلى جنين. وقبل الميلاد بقرون عديدة كانت مدن بيت شان (بيسان) ومجدو ودوثان، وحتى تقوم بين هذه المدن علاقات تجارية فلا بد من موقع وسطي يقوم بتقديم الخدمات للقوافل التجارية، وأنسب موقع في هذا المجال هو موقع مدينة جنين الذي بقع في وسط المثلث الذي شكله مواقع تلك المدن. ويعزز هذا الرأي ورود اسم المدينة في النصوص المصرية القديمة وفي الوثائق البابلية والآشورية. وقد ورد اسم المدينة في التوراة باسم «عين جنيم» أو \"Eun Gannim\" (بالعبرية: ג'נין) أي عين الجنات لكثرة مياهها وبساتينها، وكانت تعرف باسم «باب السامرة» (سبسطية الحالية) لأنها تقع عند بداية الوادي الذي يصل بين مرج ابن عامر وجبال السامرة. ونظراً لعدم حصانة موقع عين جانيم أنشأت في ذلك الوقت «مدينة بلعام» (بلعمة حالياً) التي تقع جنوب جنين ومشرفة على طريق السامرة. والمعروف أن جنين الحالية تقوم على المنطقة التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جانيم» العربية الكنعانية.\n\nالعهد الفينيقي والإغريقي\nعُثر على 4 مشاعل مصنوعة من الطين النضيج في جنين، وهي ذات أصل فينيقي وتعود للقرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وكان صاحب هذا الاكتشاف هو عالم الآثار «ج.أ. هاردينغ»، الذي قال بأن هذا دليل على وجود نوع من التفاعل والعلاقات التجارية بين سكان جنين وفينيقيا في ذلك الزمن.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nفي العهد الروماني كانت في مكانها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي»، وقد مر بالقرب منها المسيح أكثر من مرة وهو في طريقه من الناصرة إلى القدس. وقد اعتنق سكانها المسيحية، حيث عثر على بقايا كنيسة بالقرب من مركز جنين، في قرية برقين تحديداً، ويعود تاريخ هذه الكنيسة إلى القرن السادس الميلادي. وقد غير الرومان اسمها من «عين جنيم» إلى «جنين».\n\nالفتح الإسلامي والصليبيون\nولما جاء الفتح الإسلامي حُرّف اسمها إلى «جينين»، وقد قال عنها ياقوت الحموي في معجم البلدان بأنها «بليدة حسنة بين نابلس وبيسان من أرض الأردن، بها عيون ومياه.» وتعاقبت على حكم المنطقة الدولة الأموية ثم العباسية. وعندما انحطت هذه الأخيرة أخذ يسيطر على فلسطين فئة خارجة عن القانون، مما سهّل على الصليبيين غزوها.\nسقطت مدينة جنين تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1103م، وقد احتلها دوق أدنبرة، ودخلت ضمن إمارة بلدوين ومملكة بيت المقدس. وقد غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى «غرين الكبرى» (بالفرنسية: Grand Grin)، تمييزاً لها عن بلدة زرعين التي دعوها باسم «غرين الصغرى» (بالفرنسية: Petit Grin)، وقد أحاطها الصليبيون بقلاع وحصون منيعة.\nبقيت جنين بيد الصليبيين حتى عام 1187م، حيث هاجمها صلاح الدين الأيوبي إذ استطاع جنده ثقب قلعتها ولكن القلعة سقطت عليهم، وبالتالي غادرها صلاح الدين إلى زرعين ومن ثم إلى عين جالوت. وبعد معركة حطين سقطت جنين بيد المسلمين، وقد عقد صلاح الدين صلحاً مع أعدائه عام 588 هـ، وبالتالي تركها وغادر بعد ذلك إلى بيسان.\nفي عام 1229 عُقد صلح بين فردريك الثاني - إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة والكامل الأيوبي خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة، أعطيت المدينة بموجبه إلى الصليبيين ولكن الملك الصالح أيوب استطاع تحريرها نهائياً عام 1244م في معركة هربيا بمساعدة الخوارزمية. وفي عام 1255م تم الاتفاق بين الناصر الأيوبي وبين عز الدين أيبك، أول سلاطين المماليك، على إعطائه كل الأراضي التي تقع غرب نهر الأردن (فلسطين حالياً)، وبالتالي دخلت جنين في حوزة المماليك.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nلقد كانت جنين وزرعين إحدى إقطاعيات الظاهر بيبرس، في عام 1260 شهدت منطقة عين جالوت الواقعة بالقرب من زرعين، شمال جنين واحدة من المعارك الفاصلة في التاريخ، حيث تعد معركة عين جالوت من أهم المعارك في تاريخ العالم الإسلامي، انتصر فيها المسلمون المماليك انتصارا ساحقا على المغول وكانت هذه هي المرة الأولى التي يهزم فيها المغول في معركة حاسمة منذ عهد جنكيز خان. أدت المعركة لانحسار نفوذ المغول في بلاد الشام وخروجهم منها نهائيا وإيقاف المد المغولي المكتسح الذي أسقط الخلافة العباسية سنة 1258م. وفي عام 1280م ولّى السلطان قلاوون الأمير بدر الدين درباس ولاية جنين ومرج ابن عامر. ومن أبرز حوادث جنين في العهد المملوكي، انتشار الوباء في مصر والشام عام 748هـ، ويعود تمكن الوباء من هذه المدينة لانفتاحها على البلدان الأخرى ولكثرة الوافدين إليها حيث كانت جنين مركزاً من مراكز البريد بين غزة ودمشق. وقد حكم الأمراء الحارثيون - الذين أعلنوا الولاء للعثمانيين - هذه البلاد. وكانت مدينة جنين مركزاً لزعامتهم (من 1601م إلى 1671م) حيث خرجت الإمارة منهم بعد هذا التاريخ وتولى الإمارة أحمد باشا الترزي ثم جاء بعده شيوخ المهاميط وأشهرهم الشيخ علي من أواخر القرن السابع عشر حتى أوائل القرن الثامن عشر. وفي عام 1566م قامت فاطمة خاتون زوجة والي دمشق ببناء جامع اشتمل على حمام وتكية وسوق (وهو جامع جنين الكبير حالياً) وقد بقي آل طرباي مسيطرين على المنطقة وموالين للعثمانيين الذين ساعدوهم ضد الأمير فخر الدين المعني الثاني - حاكم لبنان - الذي فر إلى أوروبا عام 1613م، ولكنه ما لبث أن عاد ثانية إلى المنطقة، وتمكن من هزيمة الطرباي الذين حكموا المنطقة عام 1624م. وفي عام 1660م ألحقت جنين مع سنجق اللجون بولاية صيدا.\nفي عام 1799 هاجم الفرنسيون بقيادة نابليون فلسطين وعسكر قائده كليبر في مرج ابن عامر، هنا هاجمه جنود الدولة العثمانية بمساعدة أهالي جنين ونابلس، الذين كادوا يقضون على الفرنسيين في تلك المنطقة، لولا أن هبّ نابليون لنجدة كليبر، حيث قطع نابليون خط إمدادات العثمانيين. ولما انتصر الفرنسيون أمر نابليون جنده بحرق جنين ونهبها انتقاماً منهم لمساعدتهم للعثمانيين. وبعد اندحار الفرنسيين ورجوعهم إلى مصر نمت مدينة جنين ثانية وأصبحت مركزاً لمتسلمية جنين، يحكمها متسلم ينوب عن والي صيدا وكانت في الغالب لعائلتي آل جرار وآل عبد الهادي.\nوكان جبل نابلس في هذه الفترة ينقسم إلى متسلميتين: الأولى «متسلمية اللجون» والتي انتقلت فيما بعد إلى جنين والثانية «متسلمية نابلس» واللتان تقعان ضمن سنجق البلقاء (نابلس) التابع لولاية بيروت العثمانية. وكان آل جرار أمراء متسلمية اللجون منذ أوائل القرن الثامن عشر، ففي نهاية هذا القرن قامت الدولة العثمانية بتعيين الشيخ يوسف الجرار أميراً على اللجون في بلاد حارثة، والذي قام وبمساعدة سكان المنطقة والعثمانيين بنجدة أحمد باشا الجزار حاكم عكا في التصدي للغزو الفرنسي على المدينة.\nثم دخلت جنين كباقي مدن الشام تحت الحكم المصري بعد أن نجح إبراهيم باشا في طرد العثمانيين، وعين حسين عبد الهادي حاكماً لها، كما جعلها مركز لواء خاصاً به، إلا أن حكم المصريين لم يدم طويلاً حيث اضطر المصريون للخروج من بلاد الشام عام 1840م. فعادت جنين قائمقامية في متصرفية نابلس التابعة لولاية بيروت التي أنشئت بدلاً من ولاية صيدا. وفي القرن العشرين ربطت جنين بسكة حديد الحجاز التي وصلتها بالعفولة وبيسان ونابلس، وفي الحرب العالمية الأولى أقام الجيش الألماني مطاراً عسكرياً غرب جنين.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عهد الانتداب البريطاني أصبحت المدينة مركزاً لقضاء جنين، ولها سجل حافل بالنضال ضد الاستعمار البريطاني والصهيوني، حيث أعلنت أول قوة مسلحة ضد الاستعمار البريطاني عام 1935م بقيادة عز الدين القسام، والذي استشهد لاحقاً في أحراش بلدة يعبد وهي أحد البلدات التي تقع غرب مدينة جنين. وقد اشترك سكان المدينة في إضراب عام 1936، وقد تعرضت جنين إبان فترة الانتداب البريطاني إلى الكثير من أعمال العنف والتنكيل والتخريب وهدم البيوت على أيدي القوات البريطانية نتيجة لبعض الحوادث مثل قتل حاكم جنين «موفيت» في عام 1938.\n\nقيام دولة إسرائيل\nأما بعد انسحاب البريطانيين من فلسطين منتصف 1948، وفي خضم [[حرب فلسطين\n1948|الحرب العربية-الإسرائيلية الأولى]] أو النكبة، اختير القائد عبد القادر الحسيني لتولي القيادة العسكرية في جبل القدس. ولما تأخر وصول كتاب جيش الإنقاذ من الدول العربية المجاورة حتى أواخر شهر كانون الثاني سنة 1948، قرر الحسيني تعبئة القوى الشعبية في القسم العربي من التقسيم وقد كان يعتمد على متطوعي جبل نابلس لتاريخ هذا الجبل البطولي والعسكري، ولذا فقد وفد إلى مدينة جنين مطلع شهر كانون الثاني وبعد مناقشات ومحادثات مع وجهاء المنطقة، عقدت عدة اجتماعات في قرى القضاء وتطوع عدد كبير من المقاتلين واختار الجمع الشيخ فوزي الجرار قائداً لجميع فرق مقاتلي جبل نابلس. وقد أقرت الهيئة العربية العليا والقيادة العسكرية العليا لجامعة الدول العربية هذا التعيين واعتمدته وأوصت أن يتخذ جرار مراكزه في قرى صانور، صير وجبع.\nولقد خاضت جنين بمدنها وقراها معركة الدفاع عن الوجود ضد المنظمات الصهيونية المسلحة، التي استولت في أواخر مايو سنة 1948 على قرى زرعين، والمزار، ونورس، وصندلة، والجلمة، والمقيبلة، وفقوعة، وعرانة، وحاولت الاستيلاء على مدينة جنين حيث تم تطويقها في 3 يونيو 1948 وكان عدد الصهاينة 4000 مقاتل؛ فاستولوا على معظم أحياء المدينة وتحصن المجاهدون في عمارة الشرطة في المدخل الغربي لجنين. حتى وصلت نجدة للمحاصرين قوامها 500 جندي عراقي بقيادة عمر علي وحوالي 800 من المجاهدين الفلسطينيين من المدينة. وبعد معارك دامية خارج البلدة وفي شوارعها وأزقتها شارك فيها العديد من سكان المنطقة وقراها المجاورة تقدم العرب لاسترداد قراهم المحيطة بالمدينة. وقد كانت معركة جنين التي وقعت في 3 حزيران سنة 1948 مفخرة للمقاتلين من أهل البلاد الذين استشهد منهم العشرات بالإضافة للعدد الكبير من الجرحى، والتي أدت في آخر المطاف إلى انسحاب القوات الإسرائيلية من جنين في 4 حزيران سنة 1948 وتكبيدها خسائر جسيمة بلغت 1241 قتيل ومفقود من أصل 4000 جندي إسرائيلي كانوا يحاصرون المدينة. يستذكر الفلسطينيون شهداء الجيش العراقي الذين سقطوا دفاعاً عن جنين، حيث توجد مقبرة للعشرات منهم بالقرب من مثلث الشهداء جنوب المدينة.\n\nقيام السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً للواء جنين التابع لمحافظة نابلس. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة. رزحت جنين تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة جنين التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة. استمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة جنين، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nفي 3 نيسان من سنة 2002 قامت القوات الإسرائيلية باقتحام جنين ومخيمها في عملية استمرت 10 أيام متواصلة، ارتكبت فيها إسرائيل مجزرة راح ضحيتها 58 فلسطيني، فيما تكبدت هي خسائر جسيمة بأعداد القتلى حيث ناهزت العشرين قتيل من الجنود الإسرائيليين الذي اشتبكوا في حرب شوارع مع فصائل المقاومة داخل مخيم المدينة في ما أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nحرب غزة (2023)\nخلال حرب غزة، نفذت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية عمليات متعددة في جنين. وفي 22 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، نفذت القوات الإسرائيلية غارة جوية استهدفت مجمعًا تحت الأرض أسفل مسجد الأنصار في مخيم جنين للاجئين\nبالمدينة +، ما أدى لاستشهاد اثنين وأصيب آخرين بجروح متفاوتة، وقيل إنها كانت أول غارة جوية في الضفة الغربية منذ الانتفاضة الثانية. وإدعى الجيش الإسرائيلي أن الضربة استهدفت نشطاء من حماس والجهاد الإسلامي في فلسطين كانوا يخططون ل\"هجوم إرهابي\".\nوتعرضت جنين لأضرار بالغة خلال الحرب على غزة، وبحلول يونيو 2024، أدت الهجمات المتكررة بالقنابل والتوغلات بالجرافات من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية إلى تدمير كل شارع وتحويل كل ساحة عامة إلى أنقاض. وفي حادثة واحدة في 21 مايو، وفقًا للصحفي الإسرائيلي جدعون ليفي، أطلق قناص إسرائيلي النار على المارة ما أدى لاستشهادهم، بما في ذلك جراح الدكتور أسيد جبارين (50 عامًا) أثناء توجهه إلى العمل في مستشفى جنين الحكومي.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nورد اسم جنين بالمخطوطات المصرية القديمة، وكذلك البابلية والآشورية وفي التوراة والإنجيل، وهي مشتقة من الاسم القديم «عين جهانيم» أو «جنيم» وهي قريبة من الجنائن والبساتين. وتعتبر جنين خامس الأماكن المقدسة عند المسيحيين، لمرور يسوع المسيح من قرية برقين، حيث أشفى العشرة البرص المنعزلين في مغارة بطرف القرية.\nوفي المكان نفسه وفي أوائل القرن الرابع الميلادي أقام قسطنطين الكبير كنيسة برقين المعروفة بكنيسة جرجس وقد قامت الحكومة الهولندية بإجراء الإصلاحات اللازمة لها بالتنسيق مع دائرة الآثار في السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية باعتبارها من الأماكن المقدسة لدى النصارى، وأصبحت هذه الكنيسة تعتبر طريق الوصل للحجاج المسيحيين من الناصرة إلى بيت لحم. وفي الفترة المشار إليها أقيمت في جنين كنيسة من ضمن 31 مدينة و442 قرية في عموم أراضي فلسطين، وظلت الكنيسة قائمة إلى أن دمرها زلزال عام 560م. كما تضم المحافظة ديراً للاتين يقع في قرية الزبابدة ذات الأغلبية المسيحية، الواقعة جنوب شرق جنين.\nأما إسلامياً، فيقع في المدينة واحد من أقدم وأكبر المعالم الإسلامية العثمانية في فلسطين وهو جامع جنين الكبير الذي أنشأته فاطمة خاتون ابنة محمد بك بن السلطان الملك الأشرف قانصوة الغوري في القرن السادس عشر. ويُعتبر هذا المسجد من أبرز المعالم التاريخية في الحضارة الإسلامية في فلسطين، ومن أقدم التحف المعمارية العثمانية في البلاد.\n\nالجغرافية\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة جنين على دائرة عرض 32,28 شمالاً وعلى خط طول 35,18 شرق غرينتش، كما تقع على الإحداثيات 208 عرض و178 طول حسب شبكة الإحداثيات الفلسطينية.\nينقطع في الأجزاء الشمالية من فلسطين استمرار الإقليم الجبلي المحاذي للسهول الساحلية مكوناً سهلاً يشبه مثلثاً متساوي الأضلاع، تمتد قاعدته من سفوح جبل الكرمل في حيفا حتى شرق جنين، ويمتد الضلع الأول من جنوب شرق الناصرة وينتهي في جوار مدينة جنين، ويمتد الضلع الثاني بمحاذاة جبال الجليل. ويطلق على السهل اسم مرج ابن عامر. وبالتالي، يمثل موقع مدينة جنين رأس مثلث سهل مرج ابن عامر، عند التقاء المرتفعات الممتدة من جبل الكرمل ومن جنوب شرق الناصرة.\nومما يعطي موقع مدينة جنين أهمية أنها تقع في موقع وسطي بالنسبة للمدن الفلسطينية، حيث تقع جنوب مدينة الناصرة على بعد 25 كم، وإلى الجنوب الشرقي من مدينة حيفا على بعد 50 كم، وإلى الشمال من مدينة نابلس على بعد 43 كم.\nتقع المدينة على السفح الشمالي لجبال نابلس على الجانب المطل على مرج بن عامر، وتنتشر مساكن المدينة على هذا السفح من ارتفاع يناهز 125م إلى ارتفاع يقارب 225م. ويتراوح انحدار هذا السفح بين 10-15 %، مما يشير إلى تدرج السفح بشكل تدريجي. وعند قمة السفح تقوم هضبة فسيحة ترتفع تدريجياً نحو الشرق، وتطل باتجاه الشمال على مرج ابن عامر ومن الجنوب الغربي تطل على سهل عرابة الذي يرتفع قرابة 250م، وبالتالي يظهر السفح الذي تقوم عليه المدينة، عتبة بين سهل مرج ابن عامر وبين سهل عرابة.\n\nقرى جنين\nفي محافظة جنين مدينتان، مدينة جنين وقباطية، ويتبع المحافظة 14 بلدية كبيرة (هي يعبد، عرابة، برقين، صانور، سيلة الحارثية، سيلة الظهر، الزبابدة، اليامون، كفر راعي، كفر دان، ميثلون، دير أبو ضعيف، جبع، عجة، صير)، كما ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من القرى ومخيم يقع إلى الغرب من المدينة، والذي تعرض للاجتياح الإسرائيلي في شهر نيسان عام 2002. كانت جنين تضم قبل نكبة 1948 حوالي (70) قرية كبيرة وصغيرة وبعد النكبة اقتصرت على ما يقارب 30 قرية صغيرة. ومثل باقي المدن الفلسطينية، تعرضت أراضي شاسعة من جنين وقراها للمصادرة من قبل إسرائيل، حيث أقام على أرضها ما يزيد عن 10 مستوطنات.\n\nالمناخ\nيختلف مناخ منطقة جنين عن المناخ العام لفلسطين، وذلك لوضعها الطبوغرافي. فتقع المدينة على ارتفاع يتراوح بين 125 و225 متر، كما تحاط بعدد من المرتفعات، فمن الشرق تحيط بها جبال جلبون ومن الجنوب والغرب والشمال الغربي تحيط بها جبال نابلس وامتدادها في جبل الكرمل، وإن انفتاحها على مرج ابن عامر تقفله جبال الجليل على بعد لا يتجاوز 20 كم. هذا الوضع قلل من استفادة المدينة من الرياح الغربية والجنوبية الغربية الماطرة والمعدلة لدرجة الحرارة، كما عمل على إبعاد مناخ جنين عن مناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وجعلته أكثر تطرفاً. مثلاً، تتلقى منطقة جنين كمية من الأمطار أقل من كمية الأمطار التي تتلقاها منطقة يعبد المجاورة بمئة وخمسين مليمترا، وحرارتها أعلى من حرارة المنطقة المجاورة.\n\nالسكان\nإن نمو عدد السكان في جنين لم يكن بمعدل كبير في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1922 و1931، وذلك بسبب هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى مدن السهل الساحلي، إلا أن هذا النمو بدأ يرتفع فيما بعد ليتضاعف عام 1947م؛ بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها، وبفعل الركود الاقتصادي الذي أصاب المناطق الساحلية، وبحكم الحرب العالمية الثانية والأحداث الجارية في المنطقة. وفي عام 1952 سجل تعداد سكان جنين ارتفاعاً كبيراً بعد تدفق أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عقب نكبة العام 1948، وعاد لينخفض انخفاضاً حاداً عام 1967 بسبب نزوح أعداد كبيرة من سكان المدينة إلى شرق الأردن ودول الخليج في أعقاب نكسة عام 1967. وفي سنة 1980 عاد عدد السكان للارتفاع بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها وما زال يواصل ارتفاعه حتى الآن.\nوفقاً لإحصاء عام 2007، فقد بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 39,000 نسمة، من بينهم 19,238 إناث و 19,766 ذكور. كما يبلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين الذي يقع غرب المدينة 16,000 لاجئ، حسب إحصائيات وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) والتي أشارت إلى أن 42.3% من سكان المخيم هم دون سن الخمسة عشر عام، وهذا يعني أن النسبة الكبرى من سكان جنين ومخيمها من الشباب. أما بالنسبة للعدد الإجمالي لسكان محافظة جنين فقد بلغ في عام 2007 حوالي 256,000 نسمة، وهو ما يشكل نسبة 6,8% من تعداد الشعب الفلسطيني داخل الأراضي الفلسطينية. يُشكل مسلم الغالبية العظمى من السكان كباقي مناطق الأراضي الفلسطينية، وتتواجد أقلية المسيحية في إسرائيل تنتشر في بعض قرى المحافظة وفي جنين نفسها. وهذا جدول بأعداد سكان منطقة جنين في سنوات مختلفة:\n\nمخيم جنين\nأسست وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (UNRWA) مخيمَ اللاجئين عام 1953 برعاية أردنية. ويقع المخيم غرب مركز المدينة، ويمتد على مساحة ضيقة لا تتجاوز الكيلومتر المربع، ويعيش فيه كما ذُكر ما يقارب 16,000 لاجئ، مما يجعله بقعة مكتظة سكانياً، وهو أمر غير صحي وخصوصًا في ظل النقص الحاد في الخدمات الأساسية.\n\nكان مخيم جنين هدفا استراتيجيا لقوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حيث حاولت استهدافه مرات عدة، لكنها فشلت أمام مقاومة أبنائه، حيث وجدت قوات الاحتلال صموداً من سكانه الذين أصروا على البقاء داخل المخيم رغم الأضرار الكبيرة التي تعرضوا لها، وبلغت الاعتداءات الإسرائيلية على المخيم ذروتها فجر 3 نيسان سنة 2002 حين اقتحمت المخيم واشتبكت مع فصائل المقاومة بحرب شوارع أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nالمواصلات\nكان لموقع جنين أكبر الأثر في حياة المدينة قديماً وحديثاً، ويظهر ذلك في تاريخها الاقتصادي والاجتماعي، وفي أهميتها كعقدة مواصلات بين جبال فلسطين الوسطى (نابلس - القدس - الخليل) ومدنها، وبين شمال فلسطين لا سيما طريق القدس - الناصرة. كما تتفرع من المدينة طرق إلى حيفا وعكا. وقد حظيت مدينة جنين باهتمام بالغ من حيث المواصلات، حيث عُبدت الطرق إليها قبل الطرق الساحلية التي كانت تعتبر أهم الطرق بالنسبة للمستعمرين أيام الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ولم تتوقف أهمية المدينة على الطرق البرية، بل امتدت أهميتها إلى الخطوط الحديدية، حيث يمر بها خط يصل إلى العفولة ومن ثم بيسان فطبريا.\nتعدّ مدينة جنين من المدن الفلسطينية التي نشأت قديمِاً وتطورت عمرانيًا وذلك نتيجة للتزايد السكاني، ولكن لم تتطور شبكة المواصلات فيها بشكل مواز، ويعود ذلك لفترات الاحتلال المتعاقبة والتي مرت بها المدينة، والظروف الاقتصادية والاجتماعية الناجمة، مما أدى إلى ظهور العديد من المشاكل في نظاِم المواصلات سواءً على مستوى تخطيط وتنظيم الطرقات والشوارع، أو على مستوى البنية الإنشائية للطرق.\n\nتأتي أهمية مدينة جنين من حيث نوع الخدمات التي تقدمها والمؤسسات الموجودةِ فيها، والتي تتضمن مكاتب حكومية ومدارس، ومستشفيات، وبنوك، وأسواق، ومحلات تجارية ومنطقة صناعية، والتي تقدم خدمات للقرى والبلدات في المحافظة. إضافة لذلك، فان أهمية المدينة تعود إلى الطرق الإقليمية والتي تم تخطيطها من قبل وزارة التخطيط والتي تمر عبر مدينة جنين، فالطريق الأولى من وادي الأردن إلى الناصرة، والأخرى تربط الخليل بحيفا وتمر عبر مدينتي نابلس ورام الله، وتأتي أهمية المدينة أيضا بسبب قربها من الخط الأخضر الوهمي الذي يفصل مناطق عام 1948 عن المناطق المحتلة عام 1967، حيث تشكل مركزا للتسوق للفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر.\nوتزداد أهمية النقل في مدينة جنين وذلك نتيجة للتوسع المدينة ونموها المتسارع. ويستخدم سكان المدينة في تنقلهم داخل المدينة وسائل نقل مختلفة. إلا أنه تبين من المسح الميداني عام 2007، أن هناك انخفاض في استخدام السيارات الخاصة في المدينة، حيث بلغت نسبة الأسر التي تمتلك سيارة خاصة 13.8% من مجموع الأسر بالمدينة. في مقابل ذلك يلاحظ ارتفاع في استخدام سيارات الأجرة وخاصة للتنقل بين مركز المدينة ومناطقها المختلفة، حيث بلغت نسبة مستخدمي هذه الوسيلة 43.9%، وبنسبة أقل للحافلات تبلغ 25.3% من مجموع السكان.\nتتكون الشبكة الحالية للطرق في مدينة جنين من مجموعة من الممرات الرئيسية، التي يتراوح عرضها من أربع مسارب إلى مسربين، تربط أجزاء المدينة ببعضها، كما تربطها بمدن فلسطينية أخرى، بالإضافة لقرى محافظة جنين، وهذه الطرق هي:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمدينة جنين إحدى المدن الرئيسية في فلسطين، بالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها تاريخياً حتى النكبة، مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلاً اقتصادياً يفوق حجمها السكاني بشدة، وهذا يعود لتمتع المحافظة بخصائص طبيعية متنوعة وفرت لها موارد اقتصادية متنوعة لا سيما في مجال التعليم والخدمات والمهن والحرف، مما مكن أبناءها من إيجاد فرص عمل في الدول العربية المجاورة، وهذا بدوره خفض من أثر المدينة بالمساهمة الفعالة بالحجم السكاني في الضفة الغربية، ولكنه أتاح الفرصة لرفع معدلات حوالات المغتربين للمدينة والمحافظة بشكل كبير مما أثر على اقتصاد المدينة والبلاد بشكل إيجابي. تدير غرفة تجارة وصناعة وزراعة لواء جنين الأوضاع الاقتصادية في المدينة.\n\nالتجارة\nوتنتشر الأسواق في مدينة جنين: فهناك السوق الشعبي، سوق الحلال، سوق الجملة، سوق السيباط، سوق شارع الناصرة، سوق شارع أبو بكر، سوق شارع بورسعيد، سوق شارع فيصل، سوق شارع الهلال، سوق شارع فاطمة خاتون، وسوق الحسبة القديمة. وتحتوي الأسواق المذكورة على العديد من المحلات التجارية المختلفة. بالإضافة إلى سوق تجاري رئيس يقع وسط المدينة وآخر يقع شمال المدينة مخصص لاستقبال المتسوقين الفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر الذين يشكلون 85% من القوة الشرائية حسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية والصناعية في جنين.\n\nالزراعة\nتعتبر الزراعة نشاطاً رئيسياً في مدينة جنين ومحافظتها، حيث يعتمد عليها غالبية السكان سواء كان ذلك بصورة مباشرة أو غير مباشرة. وقبل هجرة بعض سكانها إلى دول الخليج في ستينات القرن العشرين، كانت الزراعة هي المورد الوحيد في المنطقة. وتعد مدينة جنين زراعية لحد كبير إذ تشكل مركز التسويق والتمويل الزراعي للمحافظة، حيث تعد أراضيها الزراعية واحدة من أكثر المناطق خصوبة في الضفة الغربية، حيث تزرع سنوياً بالمحاصيل الحقلية والخضار والأشجار المثمرة كالزيتون واللوزيات والحمضيات، بالإضافة إلى استخدام البيوت البلاستيكية على نطاق واسع. كما تشتهر المحافظة منذ عقود بزراعة فاكهة البطيخ بشكل لافت. قدرت وزارة الزراعة الفلسطينية مساحة الأرض المزروعة في المحافظة عام 1998/1997، حوالي 367,415 دونم وهو ما يعادل حوالي 20% من مساحة الأرض المزروعة في الأراضي الفلسطينية.\nتتمتع منطقة جنين وطوباس بثروة حرجية تميزها على باقي محافظات السلطة الفلسطينية، وتنتشر الغابات على مساحة تقارب 270,000 دونم، تشكل حوالي 85% من أحراش الضفة الغربية، إلا أنها تقع في الغالب في التصنيف (ج) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\n\nالصناعة\nبدأ اقتصاد المدينة يتحول تدريجياً إلى الصناعة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية في منتصف تسعينات القرن الفائت، وبالأخص الصناعات الخفيفة والمتوسطة، حيث ستنشأ منطقة صناعية دولية من أجل تفعيل الحركة الاقتصادية وتنشيطها، وإيجاد فرص عمل لعدد كبير من أهالي المنطقة، وجعل جنين همزة وصل بين عرب الداخل وباقي مناطق السلطة الفلسطينية. ويمكن إجمال هذه الصناعات بالتالي: صناعات زراعية، وتشمل معاصر الزيتون والمطاحن؛ وصناعات خاصة بالبناء وتشمل المقالع والمحاجر والكسارات وصناعة البلاط والفسيفساء؛ وصناعة الملابس والأحذية والخشب والحديد.\nفي عام 2008، افتتح مهرجان للصناعات الوطنية الفلسطينية في القرية السياحية شرق جنين، برعاية السلطة الفلسطينية وبدعم أوروبي، وكان لذلك شأن كبير في تقدم المشاريع الاقتصادية وتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي في المحافظة والأراضي الفلسطينية بصورة عامة.\n\nالعمارة\nتعتبر مدينة جنين مدينة سكنية إلى حد كبير، بالإضافة لكونها مركز تجاري وزراعي، إلا أن طابع المنازل والبنايات السكنية يغلب عليها، ويختلف حجم البناء ومساحة المساكن بالنسبة للمدينة عنه في المدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، فبلغ متوسط عدد الغرف فيها 4.5 غرفة لعام 2007، بينما المعدل العام في المدن الفلسطينية هو 3.6 غرفة، وقد يعود هذا إلى عدد من العوامل منها العادات والتقاليد، حيث أن البناء حجمه وشكله ومادته كلها تعزز القيمة الاجتماعية للأسرة. ويظهر ذلك بوضوح عند الذين تركوا الأرياف ثم انتقلوا إلى السكن في مدينة جنين، كما للدخل دور في عدد الغرف بالمسكن.\nوتتوفر في محافظة جنين مناطق متعددة يتم استخراج حجارة البناء منها ومن هذه المناطق قباطيا وعجة وغيرها، مما دفع الكثير من السكان لاستخدام الحجارة في بناء مساكنهم بنسبة عالية. ويستخدم الطوب أيضا بنسبة كبيرة - خاصة بمخيم المدينة، كما تستخدم الدكة والطين بنسب أقل. إن نسبة المساكن المبنية من الحجر بلغت 40.5% من مساكن المدينة، وهي نسبة مقاربة للنسبة العامة لمدن الضفة الغربية والتي هي 40% حسب إحصاء سنة 1997.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة جنين مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، وهي الأولى على مستوى الضفة الغربية، حيث تشاطر النسبة ذاتها تقريباً كل من سلفيت وطولكرم - وتبلغ نسبة الأمية في محافظة جنين 3,9% من الذين هم أكبر من 10 سنوات، بينما المعدل العام في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nعرفت المدينة حركة تعليمية منذ أمد بعيد، حيث كان نظام (الكتاتيب) سائداً منذ بداية القرن التاسع عشر. وقد شهدت مساجد المدينة الحلقات التدريسية والمناظرات العلمية من قبل مشاهير العلماء المسلمين، وغلب على هذه الحركة العلمية الطابع الديني حيث كانت تدرس علوم الدين المختلفة من فقه وحديث.\nوفي نهاية القرن التاسع عشر أقيمت أول مدرسة ابتدائية ضمت أربعة صفوف، ثم تبع إنشاء المدرسة الابتدائية أخرى علياً. وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى بعد الانتداب البريطاني، لأن البريطانيين لم يكونوا معنيين بتطور الخدمات العامة لا سيما الخدمات التعليمية. وفي عام 1943 ارتفعت معدلات التضخم في البلاد بشكل حاد، وهذا دفع الاستعمار البريطاني للقيام ببعض الخدمات لامتصاص الفائض النقدي في البلاد، فأنشأ في مدينة جنين مدرسة ثانوية، دفع الأهالي تكاليفها بالكامل. ومن الأمور التي ساهمت فعلاً في تطوير الحركة العلمية في المدينة تشكيل لجنة المعارف المحلية التي كانت مهمتها البحث في الموارد والمصادر المالية التي يمكن عن طريقها تطوير التعليم في المدينة.\n\nوبعد حرب سنة 1948 لم يكن في المدينة سوى مدرستين، واحدة للذكور وأخرى للإناث. وبعد تولي الحكومة الأردنية زاد عدد المدارس وتضاعف عدد الطلاب.\nوفي عام 1982 بلغ عدد المدارس في مدينة جنين إحدى عشرة مدرسة للذكور وست مدراس للإناث، وبلغ عدد الطلاب في هذه السنة 2610 طالباً و2495 طالبة ومما تجدر الإشارة إليه هو أن عدد الطلاب الذكور في هذه السنة لم يتجاوز عدد الطلاب عام 1960. هذا يشير إلى ظاهرة الهجرة من المدينة في الفترة التي تلت حرب سنة 1967، أما من حيث الطالبات فقد تضاعف عددهن تقريباً بين هاتين السنتين.\nأنشأت الحكومة الأردنية في عام 1965 مديرية التربية والتعليم في جنين لتشرف على 65 مدرسة موزعة بين الذكور والإناث في التجمعات السكانية المختلفة التابعة للواء جنين آنذاك ويعمل بها 508 معلمة ومعلم. في عام 2005 بلغ عدد المدارس التابعة للمديرية 110 مدارس، وعدد الطلبة 37,531 طالب وطالبة وعدد المعلمين 1,852 معلم ومعلمة.\nأما على صعيد التعليم العالي، فقد شهدت جنين طفرةً كبيرةً في أعداد حَمَلة شهادات البكالوريوس والماجستير في كثير من التخصصات سواء في الضفة الغربية أو في الخارج. ويتبع تنظيم محافظة جنين اليوم جامعة خاصة هي الجامعة العربية الأمريكية - جنين وفرع لجامعة القدس المفتوحة، والتي لا تقتصر خدماتها التعليمية على سكان محافظة جنين فقط، بل تمتد هذه الخدمات لتشمل القرى وبعض المدن المحيطة بها.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءً من هوية سكان منطقة جنين منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الريف الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى كاف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميز في منطقة جنين وشمال الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأبيض المقلم طولياً. كذلك يظهر التأثير الريفي في المطبخ الفلسطيني لهذا الجزء من فلسطين والذي يشتهر بطبق المسخن الشعبي، الذي يعتبر في نفس الوقت من الأكلات الوطنية في المطبخ الفلسطيني.\nتحوي جنين وقراها عدداً كبيراً من المعالم الثقافية البارزة على مستوى الضفة الغربية، لكنها في الغالب إما أن تكون قد عانت أو تضررت بسبب الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. فقد تم في عام 2009 العمل على إعادة ترميم وتأهيل سينما جنين بدعم ألماني -والتي كانت تعتبر من أكبر صالات العرض في الضفة الغربية- بعد إغلاقها مدة تزيد عن 22 عاماً، أي بعد الانتفاضة الأولى مباشرة.\nبموازاة ذلك يوجد في مخيم جنين مسرح هو مسرح الحرية. يعتبر مسرح الحرية الأول في المنطقة والوحيد، تأسس عام 1990. يعمل المسرح على عقد ورش عمل مختلفة في مجالي الدراما وموسيقى الأطفال والشباب، حيث يقوم كادر العمل المسرحي بتدريب استشاريين من الشباب للعمل مع المشاركين من مخيم جنين. يوفر المسرح أيضاً دورات في العلاج من خلال التمثيل المسرحي. وتجدر الإشارة إلى أنه يقام في محافظة جنين كل عام مهرجان ثقافي هو مهرجان مرج ابن عامر للتراث والثقافة والذي يعكس الوجه الحضاري والثقافي للمحافظة والضفة الغربية بشكل عام.\nوفي جنين أيضاً مركزاً للثقافة والإبداع أُسّس عام 2005، ومعهد جنين للموسيقى يضم أوركسترا جنين للشباب، ومتحف جنين للتراث الشعبي يحاكي تاريخ فلسطين ويعتبر الأول من نوعه في البلاد، وهو يجسد جانبا من تاريخ فلسطين منذ العهدة العمرية وحتى عودة الرئيس ياسر عرفات إلى فلسطين، ويقع في القرية السياحية جنوب شرق المدينة.\n\nالإعلام\nتوجد في جنين محطتان محليتان للبث الأرضي هما تلفزيون جنين المركزي وتلفزيون فرح، كما تبث محطتان إذاعيتان من المدينة على موجة (إف أم) هما: راديو البلد - جنين وصوت الأحلام، يغطي بثيهما معظم مناطق شمال الضفة الغربية.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nتحوي المدينة عدداً قليلاً من المنشآت الكبيرة في المجالات الخدمية والاجتماعية والصحية، فتوجد بعض المستشفيات الصغيرة والعيادات بالإضافة إلى مستشفى جنين الحكومي ومستشفى الشفاء. أما بالنسبة للجانب الرياضي، فيوجد في جنين ملعب يتبع البلدية ويتسع لثلاثة آلاف متفرج، يلعب فيه نادي جنين الرياضي الذي يلعب في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز، إضافة إلى عدة فرق تنتشر في قرى المحافظة. وتوجد في المدينة العديد من المكتبات أهمها مكتبة البلدية القديمة وسط المدينة.\n\nبلدية جنين\nتم إنشاء أول بلدية في مدينة جنين عام 1886 برئاسة الحاج عبد المجيد منصور حيث كان عدد الناخبين لا يتجاوز الثمانين ناخباً من بينهم ستة أعضاء بطريقة الاقتراع السري، بحيث يعين المتصرف الرئيسي من بين الأعضاء المنتخبين لمدة أربع سنوات. وقد بقي التشريع التركي هذا معمولاً به إلى أن صدر القانون رقم 17 لسنة 1954م. وظل الوضع كما هو إلى أن قامت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقالة آخر مجلس منتخب سنة 1982 والذي كان برئاسة أحمد شوقي موسى المحمود، وتسلمت إسرائيل إدارة البلدية حتى عام 1995 حيث تشكلت لجنة وطنية برئاسة وليد أبو مويس، وقد تسلم رئاستها بقرار رئاسي من الرئيس ياسر عرفات في تشرين الأول من سنة 1995، أي بعد تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية. وتتبع بلدية جنين اليوم 14 بلدية وحوالي 30 قرية في المحافظة.\n\nقائمة رؤساء بلدية جنين\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية جنين 18 شخصًا هم:\n\nانظر أيضًا\nمعركة جنين\nفيلم جنين\nاجتياح جنين (2023)\n\nمراجع\nقراءات أخرى\nوصلات خارجية\n\nمعلومات عن جنين من صفحة مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية

          "content": "Tulkarm or Tulkarem (Arabic: طولكرم, Ṭūlkarm) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine and the capital of the Tulkarm Governorate. Netanya is to the west in Israel, while Nablus and Jenin are to the east. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Tulkarm had a population of 64,532. Tulkarm is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nEtymology\nThe Arabic name translates as 'length of vinyard' but is a distortion of the Aramaic name Tur Karma ('mount of the vineyard'), which was used for Tulkarm by the Crusaders and by the mediaeval Samaritan inhabitants.\n\nHistory\nDuring the Ayyubid era, after the Muslim reconquest of Palestine under Sultan Saladin in 1187, the first families to settle in Tulkarm were from the Kurdish clan of Zaydan. A military group, the Zaydan were dispatched to the Wadi al-Sha'ir area, which includes Tulkarm, by Saladin to buttress the defense of the western approaches of Muslim-held Palestine from the Crusaders who dominated the coastal area.\nThe Zaydan politically dominated Tulkarm and the vicinity until the early 17th century. Around 1230, during the late Ayyubid period, a group of Arabs from southern Palestine immigrated to Tulkarm. They had originally migrated to Palestine from Arabia many generations prior and had become semi-nomadic farmers and grazers. Among the Arab families were the Fuqaha clan, who were considered ashraf (related to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) and served as the ulama (religious scholars) of the village.\nDuring the Ayyubid, and later the Mamluk era (1260–1517), the majority of Tulkarm's lands were made part of a waqf (religious trust) to support the al-Farisiyya Madrasa, an Islamic religious school in Jerusalem, located north of the Masjid Al-Aqsa compound. Two-thirds of the village's farmlands were confirmed as part of this trust in 1354 by the deputy-governor of Damascus, Faris al-Din al-Baki. During Mamluk rule another wave of Arab immigrants arrived in Tulkarm from North Africa and nearby Nablus. They largely engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, supplying hides to leather merchants in the coastal villages, retaken from the Crusaders in the second half of the 13th century.\n\nOttoman era\nTulkarm was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Afterward, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66) transferred Tulkarm's waqf to the al-Jawhariyya Madrasa (Commons), located in the Muslim Quarter, northwest of the al-Aqsa Mosque. Under this arrangement, Tulkarm's inhabitants paid a third of their harvest as a tax towards the waqf, called qasm. At the time of the waqf's reassignment, the population of the village was estimated at 522 (95 households) and the qasm consisted of eight carats of wheat and three carats of barley. The town's elite families administered the trust, which enabled them to reach higher social and economic status. The population increased through intermarriage with families fleeing violent feuds between the various clans of Jabal Nablus. By 1548, the population had grown to 189 households or roughly 1,040 persons.\nTulkarm appeared in Ottoman tax registers in 1596 as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Qaqun, which was a part of the sanjak (district) of Nablus. The largest village in the nahiya, Tulkarm had a population of 176 Muslim households (roughly 968 persons) and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats, beehives and a press for olives or grapes. During this early period of Ottoman rule, there were five neighborhoods (pl. harat) centered around the Shaykh Ali al-Jazri al-Mughrabi Mosque, today referred to simply as the \"Old Mosque\". The population was overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, and most residents were fellahin (peasants who worked the land.) The elite families during that time were the Zaydan and the Lajjun-based Tarabay, the latter belonging to the Bani Harith tribe. Because of the decentralized nature of the Ottoman state, these families and their successors in later centuries ruled the area with a high degree of autonomy. The Zaydan had particular authority over Tulkarm, being appointed as the mutassalim (tax collectors or enforcers) on behalf of the central authorities.\nIn the mid-17th-century most members of the Zaydan family, with the exception of the children and the elderly, were killed in a massacre by Tulkarm's inhabitants during Friday prayers. This was in reaction to the Zaydan having forced Tulkarm's residents to harvest and process the village's grains for taxation purposes. Consequently, political power in Tulkarm passed to the Badran clan, while the Fuqaha family took control of administering the \"waqf\" lands, firmly establishing them as the village's religious leaders. The Fuqaha had derived much of their authority from their classification as ashraf and their association with the Sufi Rifa'iyya zawiya of the village. The western neighborhood was mostly emptied of Zaydan members and would serve as the main area of settlement for newcomers.\nTulkarm appears on sheet 45 of Pierre Jacotin's map drawn up during Napoleon's invasion in 1799, named Toun Karin.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Ottoman Land Code in 1858, the musha (collective landownership) system was gradually abrogated and residents were required to register their property with the central authorities. The fellahin were wary of registering their names for fear of military conscription by the Ottoman state and instead entrusted various elite clans with the role of landlords, who were in effect absentee owners. This altered the area's social structure, with the Samara, al-Hajj Ibrahim and Hanun clans legally obtaining vast swathes of Tulkarm's lands. Leadership of the town's two main religious establishments were generally supplied by the Kur-based Jayyusi clan and the al-Barqawi clan of Shufa. The Barqawi clan controlled the area around the town in the 19th century.\nThe 1860s French explorer Victor Guérin visited Tulkarm, which he described as being of \"considerable\" size, with about 1,000 inhabitants. During this time, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat Tulkarm in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.\n\nThe Survey of Western Palestine in 1882 described Tulkarm as a \"long straggling village, on high ground\", surrounded by arable land and rock. There were several \"good-sized\" houses, mainly of stone in the village.\nTulkarm became the administrative center of a new subdistrict (qada') Bani Saʿb-Tulkarm in 1876, later becoming a municipality in 1892. Tulkarm was also appointed a governor, bringing the residents who numbered only a few thousand and who were mostly fellahin, closer to the central government. This elevated status gave Tulkarm precedence over the nearby villages, which at that time also included Qalqilya. Tulkarm's center shifted from the Old Mosque to an empty space in the northwest as the town expanded northward with the construction of government buildings, a post office, a school and a hospital in that area.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Tulkarm was one of the villages in which the Hannun family owned extensive estates. The Hannuns fostered close ties with clans in the village.\nTulkarm became a major rail junction in 1908 on the Hejaz Railway line running up from Egypt and southern Palestine to Haifa and Acre in the northwest, Jerusalem, Nablus and Ramallah to the south, Lebanon to the north, and Syria and Transjordan to the east. The Ottoman Army used Tulkarm as one of its principal bases during the Sinai and Palestine campaign in World War I. It was bombed by British planes carried by HMS Anne. It was captured by British forces in 1918.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nThe British Mandatory administration (1942–1947) in Palestine designated Tulkarm as the center of the Tulkarm Subdistrict.\nA road was constructed in 1920 to connect the town with Netanya on the coast. In order to cope with a significant increase in population and unorganized infrastructural development, a civil planning scheme was designed for Tulkarm and its satellite villages in 1945. At the time Tulkarm was divided into four main sections, with the bulk of commercial activity concentrated along the north–south and east–west roads. Meanwhile, the town continued to expand past its northern fringes, which had previously been characterized by green spaces.\nTulkarm became a haven for Palestinian Arab rebel activity during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine against British rule. General Commander of the Revolt Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad hailed from Dhinnaba, today part of Tulkarm municipality, and led many operations in the region.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Tulkarm consisted of 8,090; of whom 7,790 were Muslims, 280 Christian and 20 \"other\", with a land area of 1,672 dunams (urban) and 32,610 dunams (rural), according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 2,399 dunams were designated for citrus and bananas, 276 plantations and irrigable land, 28,256 for cereals, while 1,492 dunams were built-up areas.\n\nJordanian rule\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Tulkarm was occupied by the Iraqi Army and later annexed as part of the Jordanian-held West Bank. The 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan left roughly 30,000 dunams of Tulkarm's 32,610 dunams of land, mostly agricultural, in Israeli territory. In consequence, many residents moved to Transjordan or went abroad in search of employment. Straddling the armistice line, Tulkarm was cut off from nearby Arab towns. Its principal economic and social connection was with Nablus.\nIn 1950, the Tulkarm Camp was established by UNRWA in the city, comprising an area of 0.18 square kilometres (0.07 sq mi). Most of the refugees who resided in the camp came from Jaffa, Caesarea and Haifa. Today it is the second largest Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. A period of significant municipal expansion began in Tulkarm after a new civil development scheme was authorized in 1961. As part of this plan, in 1963, the hamlet of Jarrad in the southeast and other lands in the northeast (total of 1.8 square km) were annexed to the city, while the eastern village of Dhinnaba was incorporated into the municipality in 1964, adding another 0.75 square kilometres (0.29 sq mi) of territory. The village of Shuweika to the north and the smaller village of Irtah to the south were annexed in 1967.\n\nContemporary period\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Tulkarm has been under Israeli occupation. A military government governed Tulkarm until transfer in 1982 to the Israeli Civil Administration.\nDuring the early months of the First Intifada, 16 May 1989, Muhammad As'ad Fokhah, 50 years old, from Shuweika, died in Megiddo prison after a three-day hunger strike. Yitzhak Rabin reported to a Member of Knesset that Fokhah died of a heart attack caused by dehydration and that the military investigation found that prison staff had acted in accordance with orders.\nIn the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Tulkarm was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 10 December 1995, becoming the third Palestinian city from which Israeli forces withdrew. During the early years of the Second Intifada, Israel temporarily reoccupied Tulkarm. Israeli military administration over Tulkarm ended in 2005, when control of the city was handed back to the PNA. Upon assuming control of the city, the PNA instituted new weapons restrictions limiting militants to a single registered weapon that may not be loaded or carried in public.\n\nGaza War\nOn 19 October 2023, the IDF entered the city. In August 2024, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure,\" while acknowledging that these \"operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures.\"\n\nGeography\nThe city is situated on the western edge of northern West Bank, about 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) west of Nablus further southwest of Jenin and 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) east of the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. It is bordered by the 1948 ceasefire line, with Israel's Central and Haifa Districts to the west, and Palestine's Qalqilya and Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorates to the south. Its central location between a plain and a mountain has made it commercially and strategically significant and has had a great impact on its growth. In the past, Tulkarm was a caravan station and a trading center for products from the city's surrounding villages and farms, as well as a point from which armies crossed to Egypt and the Levant (al-Sham).\nTulkarm is at the crossroads of three historically important arteries: A road which runs north from the Latrun area along the edge of the coastal plain to Mount Carmel, Mount Tabor, Mount Gilboa, Nazareth and the Galilee and the Golan Heights, a road which winds northward along the outer tier of hills from the Ajalon valley to the Jezreel Valley, and a road that rises from the Mediterranean Sea at modern-day Netanya east to Nablus. In the past it was a junction of the coastal railroad from north of Haifa to Cairo and a branch of the narrow gauge Hejaz railway to Damascus.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tulkarm had a population of 3,350 (3,109 Muslims, 208 Christians, 23 Jews, eight Samaritans, one Baha'i, and one Druze). At the time of the 1931 census, Tulkarm had a population of 4,827 (4,540 Muslims, 255 Christians, 18 Jews, six Samaritans, and one Druze) with 541 in nearby suburbs (516 Muslims, 15 Jews, and 10 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Tulkarm's population as 5,700 with 629 in nearby suburbs (including 17 Jews). The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 8,090 (7,790 Muslims, 280 Christians, and 20 \"other\").\nThe populations of Tulkarm, Dhinnaba, Shuweika and Irtah steadily increased by an average of 2% annually between 1931 and 1961, with a drastic increase after the 1948 War as the area experienced an influx of Palestinian refugees. The Jews presumably left/fled during the war. Following the 1967 War, the population saw a temporary decrease as some residents fled to Jordan. In the 1967 census by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics the population of Tulkarm city was recorded as 10,255, Tulkarm Camp as 5,020, Dhinnaba as 1,342, Irtah as 925, Shuweika as 2,332 and Khirbet Jarrad as 128, a total of 20,002. Most of the inhabitants were Muslims, although there was a community of 103 Christians according to the census.\nIn the first census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 1997, Tulkarm had a population of 33,921 and the Tulkarm Refugee Camp had a population of 5,884. Palestinian refugees made up 31.4% of the city's residents and 94% of the camp's inhabitants. The sex ratio for the city was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. Over half (52.2%) of the city's population was under the age of 20, 44.5% were between the ages of 20 and 64 and 4.1% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 PCBS census Tulkarm's population grew to 51,300 while the camp's increased to 10,641. The sex ratio for the city was 50.3% male and 49.7% female.\n\nToday the population is almost entirely Muslim. Prior to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967, there were an estimated 1,000 Christians living in Tulkarm, but roughly half of the community emigrated in the aftermath of the war, while most of the remaining Christians gradually emigrated afterward. There are two Christian families who continue to live in Tulkarm, who are part of the same extended family. There is a Greek Orthodox church in the city dedicated to St. George, built in the early 19th century. The church is active and opens for visitors.\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Tulkarm is Mediterranean and subtropical as the area surrounding it, with rainfall limited to the winter. The average temperature in the winter ranges from 8 to 16 °C (46 to 61 °F), while the average temperature in the summer ranges from 17 to 30 °C (63 to 86 °F). Tulkarm is distinguished by the moderating effect the sea breeze has on its climate because of its location in the mountains. The average temperature does not exceed 27 °C (81 °F) in August, while February's average temperature does not fall below 13.5 °C (56 °F). Humidity is moderate in summer, about 40-70%, though it rises in winter to between 70 and 85%. Tulkarm receives in excess of 550 millimeters (22 in) of rain yearly, which is dispersed and intermittent, characteristic of the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nThe rainy season starts in October and continues through May. Between December and February, almost 70% of annual rainfall occurs, while 20% of annual rainfall occurs in October and November. Rain in June and September is rare and comes to negligible amounts. July and August have no rain at all, except for one rainfall of 1.5 millimeters (0.059 in) on July 10, 1995, in Tulkarm city (Tulkarm Agricultural Department). The mean annual rainfall in the city of Tulkarm is 642 millimeters (25.3 in) for the period from 1952 to 1995 (Tulkarm Agricultural Department).\n\nEconomy\nPrior to the 1948 War, Tulkarm had a major agricultural sector, with grain, olives and fruits, especially watermelons, being the major crops cultivated by in the town's lands.\n\nEducation\nPalestinian Technical University - Kadoorie which is the sole governmental university in Palestine, was established as an agricultural college in Tulkarem during the British Mandate by an endowment from the Iraqi-born Jewish philanthropist J.S. Kadoorie in 1930 and then became a university in 2007. Other institutions of higher learning include Al-Quds Open University and two campuses of An-Najah National University.\nThere are seven high schools in Tulkarm, three for girls (al-Adawiah, Jamal Abd al-Nasser, and Al-Khawaja) and three for boys (al-Fadilia, Ihsan Samara, and Adnan Sefareni) and a vocational school for both genders.\n\nOn September 24, 2016, the PA named a school in Tulkarem after Salah Khalaf. Tulkarem governor Issam Abu Bakr said that the school was named after “martyr Salah Khalaf in order to commemorate the memory of this great national fighter”.\n\nCulture\nThe traditional costumes of women from Tulkarm were plain, dark-colored gowns with or without embroidery, as most rural women were from the north of Palestine. Today, embroidery is the main source of income for the women of the city. The most popular embroidered images are maps of historic Palestine. The Palestinian dish musakhan is popular in the city. Tulkarm shares many of its cultural features with neighboring Haifa, Jenin, Nablus, Qalqilia, and Jaffa.\nA Tulkarm amusement park called Mega Land attracts tens of thousands of visitors on Muslim holidays.\n\nSports\nTulkarm has 2 semi-professional soccer teams; Thaqafi Tulkarm and Markez Shabab Tulkarm. Both are in the Palestinian League Division One.\n\nSister cities\nTulkarm's sister cities include:\n\n Cenon, France\n Nîmes, France\n Meknes, Morocco\n Santarém, Portugal\n\nNotable people\nSanaa Alsarghali\nAbu Salma (1909–1980)\nAkram Al-Ashqar, film maker\nEkrem Akurgal, Turkish archaeologist born in 1911 in Tulkarm\nKhaled Abu Toameh, Palestinian Israeli-Arab Muslim journalist\nMar'i al-Karmi (1580–1624)\nMahmoud Al-Karmi (1889–1939)\nHasan Karmi (1905–2007)\nAbdul-Ghani Al-Karmi (1906–1974)\nHilmi Hanoun (1913–2001), long-term mayor of Tulkarm\nZuhair Al-Karmi (1921–2009)\nAmeen Nayfeh, film maker and writer\nBassam Lotfi (1940-2022)\nAlaa Shreiteh (1979–2024)\n\nSee also\nTulkarm Brigade\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome To Tulkarm R.C.\nTulkarem City, Welcome to Palestine\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 11: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nAl-Salim, Farid.

J.-C. Les Romains y établissent un poste-frontière du nom de Berat Soreqa. Le nom actuel dérive de l'araméen Tourkarma, ce qui signifie montagne des vignes. L'endroit est un point d'arrêt des caravanes entre l'Égypte et le Levant.\nLa localité actuelle date de l'époque des mamelouks au XIIIe siècle. À l'époque ottomane en 1596, la ville dépend de Naplouse dans les registres d'imposition. Elle avait alors 176 foyers, tous musulmans. Elle acquiert le statut de ville en 1886 et s'agrandit encore lorsqu'elle se trouve en 1908 sur la ligne de chemin de fer du Hedjaz qui la relie à l'Égypte et à Haïfa, ainsi qu'à la Syrie et à la Jordanie.\nL'occupation britannique de la Palestine à partir de novembre 1917 met fin à l'autorité ottomane. Ensuite le pays passe sous mandat britannique. Le recensement de 1931 comptabilise à Tulkarem 4 540 musulmans, 255 chrétiens, 18 juifs, 12 Samaritains et 2 Druzes.\nLa ligne de démarcation de 1948 passe par l'agglomération et la coupe en deux. Le massacre de Kafr Qassim a lieu à proximité. Elle passe entièrement sous administration israélienne après la guerre des Six Jours.\nEn octobre 2023, dans le cadre de la guerre à Gaza déclenchée par l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël le 7 octobre, la ville est le théâtre d'une incursion militaire israélienne qui dura deux jours. L'incurtion tue 12 Palestiniens et un policier israélien. Des raids frappent depuis régulièrement la ville et le camp de réfugiés : les maisons sont bombardées ou démolies par l’armée israélienne, les rues sont éventrées, les systèmes d'approvisionnement en eau et d'assainissement sont détruits et l'électricité coupée. L'ONG Médecins sans frontières témoigne également « d'attaques incessantes et systématiques contre le personnel de santé ».\nHuit personnes, dont deux femmes, sont tuées le 25 décembre 2024 dans un autre raid israélien. L'armée israélienne lance une grande offensive à partir de janvier 2025 contre Tulkarem et d'autres villes palestiniennes.\n\nClimat\nElle bénéficie d'un climat subtropical avec des précipitations surtout en hiver. La température moyenne en hiver va de 8 °C à 16 °C et en été de 17 °C à 30 °C. La température est relativement clémente grâce à la brise marine et les températures d'août excèdent donc rarement 27 °C.\n\nPersonnalités\nRania de Jordanie (1970-), reine de Jordanie\nEkrem Akurgal (1911-2002), archéologue\nShakib Dallal (1920-1991), homme politique\n\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nJimmy Gladiator, D’Houilles à Tulkarem, d’un voyage en Palestine, Ab irato, 2005.\n\nArticle connexe\nCamp de Tulkarem\n\nLiens externes\n\n(ar) الموقع الإلكتروني الرسمي لبلدية طولكرم\n\nAssociation Keys of Tulkarem (Suisse-Tulkarem)\nCarte de la ville de Tulkarem et des impacts de l'occupation israélienne (Keys of Tulkarem)\n\n Portail de la Palestine",

          "content": "Qalqilya or Qalqiliya (Arabic: قلقيلية, romanized: Qalqīlyaḧ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, which serves as the administrative center of the Qalqilya Governorate. The city had a population of 51,683 in 2017. Qalqilya is surrounded by the Israeli West Bank wall, with a narrow gap in the east controlled by the Israeli military and a tunnel to the Palestinian town of Hableh. Qalqilya is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (as part of Area A), while remaining under Israeli military occupation.\n\nEtymology\nAccording to Edward Henry Palmer, the name came from \"a type of pomegranate\", or \"gurgling of water\". Qalqilya was known as Calecailes in the Roman period, and Calcelie in the Frankish sources from the early Medieval times. The word \"Qalqilya\" might be derived from a Canaanite term which means \"rounded stones or hills\".\n\nHistory\nThe vicinity of Qalqilya has been populated since prehistoric times, as attested to by the discovery of prehistoric flint tools.\n\nOttoman period\nQalqilya appeared in Ottoman tax registers (transliterated as Qalqili) in 1596, as a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Sa'b in the Liwa of Nablus. It paid a total of 3,910 akçe in taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives.\nEdward Robinson described Kulakilieh in 1838 as a village in Beni Sa'ab district, west of Nablus. An Ottoman census listed the village in the nahiya (sub-district) of Bani Sa'b, in 1288 AH (1871/1872 CE).\nQalqilya was described in 1882 as \"a large somewhat straggling village, with cisterns to the north and a pool on the south-west. The houses are badly built.\" Residents from nearby Baqat al-Hatab move to the city in 1883, and a municipal council to administer Qalqilya was established in 1909.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAn official land survey recorded 27,915 dunams of land owned in 1945. Of this, 3701 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 3,232 were plantations and irrigable land, 16,197 used for cereals, while 273 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nAccording to Sami Hadawi, the town had been \"one of the most prosperous in Palestine, owning extensive orange groves and serving as one of the main vegetable markets of the country.\"\n\n1948 War\nDuring the war, many inhabitants from  Kafr Saba, Abu Kishk, Miska, Biyar 'Adas and Shaykh Muwannis resettled in Qalqilya. Residents of Qalqilya who left during the fighting returned with the arrival of the Jordanian Arab Legion and the Iraqi expeditionary force, apart from 2,000 upper-class residents who settled in Nablus for economic reasons. Hadawi argues that the armistice lines established in 1949 \"severed all [Qalqilya's] orange groves in favour of Israel,\" leaving the town \"landless except for its rocky areas towards the east.\"\n\nJordanian occupation\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the area was occupied by Jordan in 1950. On the night of 10 October 1956, the Israeli army launched a raid against Qalqilya police station in response to a Jordanian attack on Israeli bus, among other incidents. The attack was ordered by Moshe Dayan and involved several thousand soldiers. During the fighting, a paratroop company was surrounded by Jordanian troops and escaped under close air-cover from four Israeli Air Force aircraft. Eighteen Israelis and 70 to 90 Jordanians were killed in the operation.\n\nPost 1967\nIn the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967, Qalqilya came under Israeli rule. Dozens of inhabitants were expelled to Jordan as part of the Palestinian expulsions of 1967 known as the Naksa. 850 buildings were razed. After the IDF's psychological warfare unit made a visit to the city and many of the residents had fled, the UN representative Nils-Göran Gussing  noted that 850 of the town's 2,000 houses were demolished. In his memoirs, Moshe Dayan wrote that these actions ultimately constituted \"collective punishment\" which was contrary to  government policy. The villagers were eventually allowed to return and the reconstruction of damaged houses was financed by the military authorities.\nAs part of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Qalqilya was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 17 December 1995.\nIn 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built, encircling the town and separating it from agricultural lands on the other side of the wall.\nIn November 2015, Israel arrested what it alleged to be a network of 24 Hamas militants active in the city.\nOn 20 October 2017, the municipality of Qalqilya named a street after Saddam Hussein and erected a memorial with his likeness. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by the Qalqilya District Governor Rafi Rawajba and two other Palestinian officials. It bears the slogan \"Saddam Hussein – The Master of the Martyrs in Our Age\".\nOn 19 June 2022, a 53-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli forces as he sought to cross the Israeli West Bank barrier, which encircles Qalqilya. According to the IDF, he damaged the security fence in an attempt to cross into Israeli territory. It's unclear whether he was armed.\nOn 22 June 2024, a 60-year-old Israeli citizen was shot dead in Qalqilya by local residents. The victim, from Petah Tikva, regularly bought vegetables in the city. Following the shooting, his car was set on fire, and his personal documents were taken. This incident was the third in Qalqilya within 48 hours, following another attack on Thursday, where a 70-year-old Israeli was killed, and the elimination of two Islamic Jihad operatives who planned an attack.\n\nGeography\nQalqilya is located in the northwestern West Bank, straddling the border with Israel. It is 16 kilometers southwest of the Palestinian city of Tulkarm, and the nearest localities are the Arab-Israeli city of Tira and the Palestinian hamlet of 'Arab al-Ramadin al-Shamali to the northeast, the Palestinian village of Nabi Ilyas to the east, the Palestinian hamlets 'Arab Abu Farda and 'Arab ar-Ramadin al-Janubi and the Israeli settlement of Alfei Menashe to the southwest, and the Palestinian village Habla and Arab-Israeli town of Jaljuliya to the south. It contains the point in the West Bank closest to the Mediterranean Sea, with about 14 km to the coast at Shefayim.\nThe average annual rainfall 587.4 millimeters and the average annual temperature is 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nDemographics\nIt had a population of 13 Muslim households, according to an Ottoman census in 1596.\nVictor Guérin found a population of 200 in 1870.\nThe British Mandate authorities conducted a census in 1922, which found that Qalqilya had a population of 2,803 (2,794 Muslims and 9 Christians),. The population was 3,867 (3,855 Muslims and 12 Christians), in a total of 796 houses, according to the 1931 census. The population was listed at 4,503 (including 4 Jews) in the 1938 census. The population of Qalqilya was 5,850 (5,840 Muslims and 10 Christians, according to the 1945 census.)\nThe population of Qalqilya was 11,401, according to a Jordanian census in 1961. A census in September 1967 found 8,922 persons, of whom 1,837 were originally from Israeli territory.\nThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census recorded Qalqilya's population to be 22,168 in 1997. The majority of the inhabitants (69.8%) were Palestinian refugees or their descendants. In the 2007 census, Qalqilya's population was 41,739 (50.9% male and (49.1% female)). The number of registered households was 7,866.\nIn the 2017 census, Qalqiliya's population was 51,683.\n\nGovernment\nHamas won the 2006 municipal elections in Qalqiliya and one of its members, Wajih Qawas, became mayor, although he was incarcerated by Israel for much of his term. On 12 September 2009, the PNA dismissed Qawas for allowing Qalqiliya's debt to grow unchecked, failing to attract international funding for city projects and ignoring orders by the Palestinian government. Qawas, however, viewed his dismissal as a result of the ongoing feud between Hamas, which dominates the PNA in the Gaza Strip and Fatah, which dominates the PNA in the West Bank. Human rights groups criticized Qawas's dismissal, condemning the intervention by the central Palestinian authorities in the affairs of an elected official. During the 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Othman Dawood was elected mayor.\n\nEconomy\nBetween 1967 and 1995 almost 80 percent of Qalqilya's labor force worked for Israeli companies or industries in the construction and agriculture sectors. The remaining 20% engaged in trade and commerce, marketing across the Green Line. According to a field survey taken by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), 45% of Qalqilya's working population was employed by government, 25% worked in agriculture, 15% worked in trade and commerce, 10% worked in industry and 5% worked in Israeli labor. In 2012, the unemployment rate was 22%, with those most affected formerly employed in agriculture, trade and services.\nQalqilya is particularly known for its citrus crop and of its total of 10,252 dunams of land, (of which 5,930 are arable) 1802 dunams (about 17.6% of the city's land and over 30% of its arable land) are planted with citrus trees. Other major crops are olives and vegetables. Local industries include the manufacture of foodstuffs, olive oil, dairy products, soap, glass, stone, marble and building materials, in addition to the manufacture of wood, and mineral water companies.\nThe Qalqilya Zoo, established in 1986, is currently the only zoo in the West Bank and in Palestine, and, according to its owner, is the city's single-largest employer. It serves as one of Qalqilya's main attractions. The zoo houses 170 animals and works closely with zoologists from the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo and the Ramat Gan Safari. The only factory for prosthetic limbs in the northern West Bank is in Qalqilya.\n\nSouqs\nIn Qalqilya there are many markets, including:\n\nSouq Abu Amsha (سوق أبو عمشة)\nSouq Shaheen (سوق شاهين)\nSouq Abu Jaber (سوق أبو جابر)\nSouq Beshara (سوق بشارة)\nSouq Uthman  (سوق عثمان)\nSouq Um Tareq  (سوق أم طارق)\nSouq Abu Aisha  (سوق أبو عيشة)\n\nLand usage and the barrier\nOf the city's total area of 10,252 dunams, 3,027 were built-up areas, 266 were used for industrial purposes, 2,894 were planted with permanent crops, 419 were used for greenhouses, 274 for livestock ranges, 2,343 others were classified as arable, and 283 dunams were occupied by the West Bank barrier. Nearly all of Qalqilya's urban area is under Palestinian civil jurisdiction and Israeli military control (Area B), while 64.7% of the city's municipal territory, mostly agricultural lands and open spaces, is under Israeli civil and military control (Area C).\nIsrael's construction of the barrier began in 2002 and isolates Qalqilya from the north, west, south, and half of its eastern side, leaving a corridor in the east connecting it with smaller Palestinian villages and hamlets. Israel states its construction of the wall is for security purposes, particularly to prevent infiltration by Palestinian militants into Israel as had occurred during the Second Intifada. The Palestinians state that the barrier is meant to annex Palestinian lands (since the wall often juts deep into Palestinian territory) and control the movement of Palestinians. The barrier has negatively affected Qalqilya's economy, particularly the commercial and trade sectors, because it has separated the city from nearby Palestinian localities and bordering Arab towns in Israel, which contributed about 40% of the city's income prior to the barrier's completion. The barrier has also separated 1,836 dunams of mostly agricultural lands and open spaces within Qalqilya's jurisdiction from the city proper. Social relations between Qalqilya's inhabitants and those of other Palestinian cities have also been hindered by the barrier.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the 2007 PCBS census, 95.3% of the inhabitants over the age of 10 were literate. About 75% of the illiterate population were women. The town has 21 public schools, four private schools, three schools managed by UNRWA and 13 kindergartens. All schools are overseen by the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education. As of 2012, there were 12,286 residents enrolled in school, with 660 teaching staff. In 2007, 10.5% of the population had graduated from an institution of higher education, while 15.7% had completed secondary education, 27.5% preparatory education, 27.4% elementary education and 13.8% had no formal education. There are two colleges in the city: the Ad Da'wa Islamic College established in 1978 and a campus of the Al-Quds Open University established in 1998.\n\nCulture\nThere are charities, recreational and cultural clubs, Qalqilya TV, and a radio station (Radio Nagham). In the Qalqilya governorate, the NGO Cultural Forum Society (جمعية منتدى المثقفين الخيرية) played a role in publicizing the residents' economic and political problems due to the occupation, the wall, and settlements.\n\nSister cities\nQalqilya's sister cities are:\n\n Gainesville, Florida\n Mülheim, Germany\n\nNotable people\nBahaa Al-Din Dawood Bin Ismail Al-Qalqili, a scholar of the eighth century AH who taught in Aleppo and died in the year 780 AH, according to the book Fragments of Gold in News from Gold by Ibn General Shihab al-Din al-Hanbali al-Dimashqi\nAbu Ali Iyad, Fatah field commander in Jordan and Syria\nNajm al-Din Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Qalqili, a scholar born in Qalqilya who moved to Al-Quds Al-Sharif as a child and later went Cairo to study at Al-Azhar University.

Son altitude varie de 45 m à 125 m et son climat est méditerranéen (les précipitations annuelles moyennes sont de 550 mm). Qalqilya est très proche de la mer (12 km), en bordure de la ligne verte (qui constitue la frontière entre Israël et la Cisjordanie depuis 1949) et se situe sur l'axe routier Tel-Aviv-Naplouse.\nQalqilya est presque totalement entourée par le mur de séparation israélienne.\n\nHistoire\nLa ville de Qalqilya est située sur un emplacement occupé par l'homme depuis la préhistoire. La ville est attestée à l'époque romaine sous le nom de Kalkaliya. Une étymologie proposée ferait dériver le nom de l'arabe qala'at (la forteresse) + alaat' (haute).\nUn conseil local fut établi à Qalqilya en 1909, à la fin de la période ottomane, et 1945 vit la création d'un conseil municipal.\nEn 1948, après la  guerre israélo-arabe, la ville vit affluer des milliers de réfugiés palestiniens qui s'installèrent dans un quartier de la ville (ils sont appelés « ceux de Kufre Saba et d'Arab Abu Kishek »). Qalqilya ne vit jamais la création d'un camp de réfugiés car ceux-ci furent intégrés dans la ville en échange d'un soutien de l'UNRWA. Lorsque l'État d'Israël fut créé, la municipalité de Qalqilya se vit amputée de toutes les terres qui se trouvaient de l'autre côté de la ligne d'armistice de 1949.\nEntre 1949 et 1967, la ville passe sous souveraineté jordanienne. Les agriculteurs de la ville essayaient régulièrement de passer de l'autre côté de la frontière pour travailler leurs terres annexées. Pour punir ces infiltrations, l'armée israélienne attaqua Qalqilya à plusieurs reprises et détruisit de nombreux puits artésiens.\nDepuis la guerre des Six Jours, la ville est occupée par Israël, comme le reste de la Cisjordanie.\nAprès les accords d'Oslo, la ville passe sous la juridiction de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne (zone A).\nEn dépit de ces accords, et surtout depuis le déclenchement de la seconde intifada, les forces armées israéliennes entrent régulièrement à Qalqilya, souvent sous prétexte de procéder à des arrestations.\nEn 2003, Israël commence la construction du mur de séparation qui cerne presque totalement Qalqilya. Le tracé du mur ne suit pas la frontière de 1967 (ligne verte), il rentre profondément dans le territoire palestinien, et sépare aujourd'hui le district de Qalqilya de 50 000 dunums (1 dunum = 1 000 m2) de ses terres cultivées, soit de près de 50 % du total des terres du district.\n\nÉconomie\nJusqu'en 1995, près de 80 pour cent de la population active de Qalqilya travaillait dans le secteur agricole, pour des entreprises israéliennes (e.a. dans le domaine de la construction). Les autres 20 % de la population active vivaient du commerce entre Israël et les territoires occupés.\nDepuis 2003, les activités commerciales se sont effondrées, à la suite de la construction du mur qui a rendu Qalqilya très difficile d'accès. Les conditions pour accéder aux terres agricoles situées de l'autre côté du mur sont devenues extrêmement difficiles voire impossibles pour les agriculteurs de Qalqilya. Enfin, plus personne à Qalqilya ne trouve d'emploi en Israël.\nDepuis les élections législatives de janvier 2006, l'Union européenne a stoppé son financement à l'Autorité nationale palestinienne. Beaucoup de fonctionnaires ne sont plus payés depuis.\n\nCulture locale et patrimoine\nPersonnalités liées à la ville\nBlaise Patrix (1953-), artiste peintre ayant proposé et coordonné à Qalqilya la réalisation d'une fresque (Strong together, 300 participants, 320M2) en 2014.\nFahed Attal (1985-), footballeur palestinien.\nWaleed Al-Husseini (1989-), blogueur et essayiste palestinien.\n\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nTerritoires occupés par Israël\nEnclaves palestiniennes\nApartheid israélien\nMur de séparation israélien\n\nLiens externes\n[1] Pour une série de données géophysiques à propos de Qalqilya\n[2] Une interview de l'ancien maire de Qalqilya : Marouf Zahran\n[3] Une série de cartes de Qalqilya\nQalqilya sur WikiMapia\n\nSite officiel\n\n Portail de la Palestine   Portail d’Israël",

It has been largely destroyed during the Gaza war.\nBefore the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as \"Salqah\". A vast caravanserai, today known as Barquq Castle, was constructed there by the emir Yunis al-Nawruzi in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire to protect caravans, pilgrims, and travellers.\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 205,125 in 2017. Khan Yunis, which lies only four kilometres (2+1⁄2 miles) east of the Mediterranean Sea, has a semi-arid climate with temperature of 30 °C maximum in summer and 10 °C minimum in winter, with an annual rainfall of approximately 260 mm (10.2 in).\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nHerodotus describes a city named Ienysos (Ancient Greek: Ιηνυσος) located between Lake Serbonis and Kadytis (modern Gaza city). He talks about how the Persian military marched through the location on its way to Egypt. He also describes how the coastal area between Kadytis and Ienysos was inhabited by local Arab tribes. Some sources, due to phonological resemblance of the names and due to the general matching of the geographic locations, associate this site with modern Khan Yunis.\nOther sources have suggested a further inland location of \"Khirbet Ma'in Abu Sitta\" (Palestinian village depopulated in 1949, near modern kibbutz of Nir Oz) or the Egyptian town of Arish as possible locations of Ienysos, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.\nAncient discoveries in Khan Yunis feature a lintel with a Greek inscription, discovered repurposed in the tomb of Sheikh Hamada. The inscription translates to: 'Hilarion - giving thanks to St. Georgius.' Originally housed in the Musée de Notre Dame de France in Jerusalem, the lintel is currently lost.\n\nEstablishment by Mamluks\nBefore the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as \"Salqah\". A vast caravanserai, today known as Barquq Castle, was constructed there by the emir Yunus al-Nawruzi ad-Dawadar in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire to protect caravans, pilgrims, and travellers. The growing town surrounding it was named \"Khan Yunis\" after him. Yunus was killed in battle in 1389. Yunus was the executive secretary (dawadar), one of the high-ranking officials of the Mamluk Circassian sultan Barquq. The town became an important center for trade and its weekly Thursday market drew traders from neighboring regions.\nThe khan served as resting stop for couriers of the barid, the Mamluk postal network in Palestine and Syria.\n\nOttoman period\nKhan Yunis was the site of a minor battle in late 1516, when the Egypt-based Mamluks were defeated by Ottoman forces under the leadership of Hadim Sinan Pasha. The Ottoman sultan Selim I then arrived in the area where he led the Ottoman army across the Sinai Peninsula to conquer Egypt. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Ottomans assigned an Asappes garrison associated with the Cairo Citadel to guard the fortress at Khan Yunis.\nPierre Jacotin named the village Kan Jounes on his map from 1799, while in 1838, Robinson noted Khan Yunas as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district. In 1863 French explorer Victor Guérin visited Khan Yunis. He found it had about a thousand inhabitants, and that many fruit trees, especially apricots were planted in the vicinity.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the Bedouin tribe of 'Arab al-Wahidat (عرب الوحيدات) were among the residents of Khan Yunis.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans established a municipal council to administer the affairs of Khan Yunis, which had become the second largest town in the Gaza District after Gaza itself.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Khan Yunis had a population of 3890 inhabitants (3866 Muslims, 23 Christians, and one Jew), decreasing in the 1931 census to 3811 (3767 Muslims, 41 Christians, and three Jews), in 717 houses in the urban area and 3440 (3434 Muslims and 6 Christians) in 566 houses in the suburbs.\nIn the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,379 (including three Jews) with 3,953 in nearby suburbs. In the 1945 statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 11,220 (11,180 Muslims and 40 Christians), with 2,302 (urban) and 53,820 (rural) dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 4,172 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 23,656 used for cereals, while 1,847 dunams were built-up land.\n\n1948–1967\nDuring the night of 31 August 1955, three Israeli paratroop companies attacked the British-built Tegart fort in Khan Yunis from where attacks had been carried out against Israelis. The police station, a petrol station and several buildings in the village of Abasan were destroyed, as well as railway tracks and telegraph poles. In heavy fighting, 72 Egyptian soldiers were killed. One Israeli soldier was killed and 17 were wounded. The operation led to a ceasefire on September 4, forcing President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Egyptian government to halt Palestinian fedayeen operations against Israel. One of the mechanized companies was commanded by Rafael Eitan.\nBefore the Suez War, Khan Yunis was officially administered by the All-Palestine Government, seated in Gaza and later in Cairo. After a fierce firefight, the Sherman tanks of the IDF 37th Armored Brigade broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade. It was the only site in the Gaza strip where the Egyptian army put up any resistance to the Israeli invasion of Gaza, but it surrendered on 3 November 1956.\nThere are conflicting reports of what happened. Israel said that Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces were still facing armed resistance, while the Palestinians said all resistance had ceased by then, and that many unarmed civilians were killed as the Israel troops went through the town and camp, seeking men in possession of arms.\nThe killings, dubbed the Khan Yunis massacre, were reported to the UN General Assembly on 15 December 1956 by the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, Henry Labouisse. According to the report, the exact number of dead and wounded is not known, but the director received lists of names of persons allegedly killed from a trustworthy source, including 275 people, of which 140 were refugees and 135 local residents.\nAfter 1959, the All-Palestine Government of Gaza Strip was abolished and the city was included in the United Arab Republic, which was shortly disestablished and the Gaza Strip came under the direct Egyptian military occupation rule.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nIn 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israel occupied Khan Yunis again.\nAs a result of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, Khan Yunis and most of the Gaza Strip (excluding Israeli settlements and military areas) were placed under the control of the Palestinian Authority.\nKhan Yunis was the site of Israeli helicopter attacks in August 2001 and October 2002 that left several civilians killed, hundreds wounded and civilian buildings within the vicinity destroyed.\nThe Palestinian Authority came into control of the entirety of the Strip following the 2005 Israeli disengagement. However, following the Battle of Gaza in 2007, Hamas took over the Gaza Strip and established its own government in the region.\n\nIsrael–Gaza war\nDuring the ongoing Israel–Gaza war, Israel has bombed Khan Yunis along with other cities in the Gaza Strip as part of an offensive against Hamas. The Israeli Air Force extensively bombed much of the city, including the Hamad City apartment complex. Local sources have reported numerous civilian casualties in Khan Yunis as a result of Israeli bombings, which Palestinian news agency Wafa put at \"at least 70\" as of December 3. The Al Qarara Cultural Museum was destroyed in an explosion as a result of an Israeli attack in October 2023, part of an offensive that reportedly targeted civilian homes and mosques in the vicinity. Israeli armored units began entering the outskirts of the city in December 2023. After several months of fighting, Israeli forces ended up withdrawing from Khan Yunis and most of the southern Gaza Strip. Having failed to root out Hamas from Khan Yunis, Israeli forces began a second invasion of the city in late July 2024, which also ended in an Israeli withdrawal. Israeli forces invaded Khan Yunis yet again in August 2024, and withdrew once more at the end of the month. Following the January 2025 ceasefire, Hamas forces were seen parading through Khan Yunis. Following the resumption of the war in March, Israeli forces launched a fourth invasion of the city in May.\n\nEconomy\nKhan Yunis is the second largest urban area in the Gaza Strip after Gaza City. It serves as the principal market center of the territory's southern half and hosts a weekly Bedouin souk (\"open-air market\") mostly involving local commodities. As of 2012 Khan Yunis had the highest unemployment rate in the Palestinian territories.\n\nEducation\nUniversity College of Science and Technology\nAl Quds Open University\nPalestine College of Nursing\n\nCulture and heritage\nBarquq Castle\nBarquq Castle was a Mamluk-era fortified mosque and caravanserai. It was very damaged by the Israeli army during the Gaza war.\n\nAl Qarara Cultural Museum\nLocated in Al-Qarara, on the outskirts of Khan Yunis, the cultural museum tells the story of the history of Palestine. Key objects included Byzantine mosaics, swords dating to the Crusader period, thobes, as well as jewellery worn by women prior to the Nakba. It also included military items dating to the British Mandate in Palestine.\nThe museum's structure, display cases, and collection were destroyed in October 2023 by Israeli forces.\n\nNotable people\nHiba Abu Nada (1991-2023), poet and novelist killed in an Israeli air force bombing of her home in Khan Yunis\nRouzan al-Najjar, nurse born September 11, 1996 in Khan Younes, killed by a bullet of an Israeli army sniper in June 2018\nMohammed Assaf, singer who grew up in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, winner of the second season of Arab Idol\nMohammed Shabir (1946 – 2023), doctor in microbiology and former president of The Islamic University in Gaza killed by an Israeli sniper during Gaza War\nYahya Sinwar (1962 - 2024), Palestinian militant and politician who served as chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau from August 2024, and as the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip from February 2017, until his death in October 2024\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns – sister cities\nKhan Yunis is twinned with the following cities:\n\n Hamar, Norway\n Almuñécar, Spain\n Évry, France\n Bisceglie, Italy\n Alcamo, Italy\n\nSee also\nPalestinian refugee camps\nList of cities in Palestinian National Authority areas\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKhan Younis articles from UNWRA\nWelcome To The City of Khan Yunis Archived 2024-01-24 at the Wayback Machine\nclose-up map of Gaza\nAir photo of Khan Yunis, 1946, with key to sites - Eran Laor Cartographic Collection, The National Library of Israel",

          "content": "Rafah (Arabic: رفح Rafaḥ [rafaħ]) is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Rafah Governorate. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south-west of Gaza City. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889. Due to the Gaza war, about 1.4 million people from Gaza City and Khan Yunis, about 70% of Gaza's population, were displaced to Rafah, as of February 2024. By April 2025, most of the city was destroyed by means of systematic razing by the Israeli military. The remnants of the city are currently under Israeli control.\nAfter the 1948 Palestine war, Egypt governed the area and refugee camps for displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled from what became Israel were established. During the Suez Crisis, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees in the Rafah refugee camp, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces occupied the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip after capturing them from Egypt. In the same year, IDF troops bulldozed and demolished 144 houses in the Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\nWhen Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part, dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Then, since the year 2000, the core of the city was destroyed by Israel, and since the 2010s also by Egypt, in order to create a large buffer zone.\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Gaza's only airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, when it was bombed and bulldozed by the IDF.\n\nEtymology\nOver the ages the city has been known as Rpwḥw by the ancient Egyptians, 𒊏𒉿𒄭 Rapiḫi or 𒊏𒉿𒄷 Rapiḫu by the Assyrians, רפיח Rāphiyaḥ by the ancient Israelites, Ῥαφία Rhaphíā by the Greeks, Raphia by the Romans, and Rafh by the Arab Caliphate.\nIn English, Rafah ( (US) or   (UK)), derived from the modern Arabic, is most common, but Rafiah  (from the modern Hebrew) is also used. The form Raphiah  (from the ancient Hebrew) is used as well, especially in historical contexts such as the Battle of Raphiah.\n\nHistory\nBronze Age Raphia\nRafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I, from 1303 BCE as Rph, and as the first stop on Pharaoh Shoshenq I's campaign to the Levant in 925 BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the Assyrian king Sargon II's victory over the Egyptians.\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nIn 217 BCE, the Battle of Raphia was fought between the victorious Ptolemy IV and Antiochus III. It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of elephants.\nAntiochus III, willing to make peace with Ptolemy V, had his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia.\nThe town was conquered by Alexander Yannai and held by the Hasmoneans until it was rebuilt in the time of Pompey and Gabinius; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57 BCE. Rafah is mentioned in Strabo (16, 2, 31), the Antonine Itinerary, and is depicted on the Map of Madaba.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the Byzantine period, it was a diocese, and Byzantine ceramics and coins have been found there. It was represented at the Council of Ephesus 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church but a small Greek Orthodox presence exists.\n\nEarly Muslim to Mamluk periods\nRafah was one of the towns captured by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As in 635 CE, and subsequently was an important trading city during the Early Muslim period. Under the Umayyads and Abbasids, Rafah was the southernmost border of Jund Filastin (\"District of Palestine\"). According to Arab geographer al-Ya'qubi, it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from Ramla to Egypt.\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was \"of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a mosque, and hostelries\". However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an Ayyubid postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby Deir al-Balah.\n\nOttoman and Egyptian period\nRafah appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Gaza of the Liwa of Gazza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives. In 1799, the French Army of the Orient, led by Napoleon, passed through Rafah during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of Muhammad Ali, which lasted until 1840.\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin, who visited Rafah in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called Bab el Medinet, meaning \"The Gate of the town\". In 1881, Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria wrote: \"Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria.\"\n\nBritish period\nOn 9 January 1917, British forces captured Rafah, and subsequently used it as a staging post for their first attempt to capture Gaza. The presence of British military bases in Rafah served an economic draw which led to an influx of internal migration to the city. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandatory authorities, Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all of which Muslim. Nine years later, the Mandatory authorities conducted the 1931 census of Palestine, by which time Rafah's population had increased to 1,423 residents living in 228 houses, all of which were still Muslim.\nIn the Village Statistics, 1945, a joint survey conducted by the Mandatory government's Government Office of Statistics and Department of Lands for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, Rafah had an all-Muslim population of 2,220 people with 40,579 dunams of land. Of these, 275 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 24,173 dunams were used for growing cereals, while 16,131 dunams were un-cultivable land.\n\n1948–1967\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt governed the area (see Palestinian Protectorate) and refugee camps were established. During the Suez Crisis, 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees, were killed by troops of the Israel Defence Force in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces captured Rafah as part of their invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. The population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself. On Friday, 9 June 1967, the Israeli military bulldozed & blew up 144 houses in Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\n\nAfter 1967\nIn the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General Ariel Sharon (then head of the IDF southern command), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people. Israel established the Brazil and Canada housing projects to accommodate displaced Palestinians and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living; Brazil is immediately south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because UN peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 Camp David Accords mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada on 25 April 1989 Rafah resident Khaled Musa Armilat, aged 22, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis. In a letter to a Member of Knesset, March 1990, Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin stated that the dead man's brother had been interrogated and stated that he had been killed by Border Police but four months later he blamed the army. Rabin added the matter was being investigated by the Israeli Police.\nThree and a half weeks after Armilat's killing, 19 May, five civilians including a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in Rafah by Israeli soldiers using plastic bullets. Two of the 12 other casualties later died of their wounds.\nIn May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another mass demolition of homes in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname \"the bulldozer\".\nIn September 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, that smugglers have made tunnels under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.\n\n2023–25 Gaza war\nDuring the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) war on Gaza, civilians were told to flee to Rafah and forcibly displaced from their homes. Although the Israeli government declared the southern half of Gaza a safe zone, the IDF proceeded to bomb the region extensively, with a New York Times investigation estimating that 2,000-pound bombs were dropped at least 200 times as of 21 December 2023.\n\nBy February 2024, roughly two-thirds of Gaza's population, or 1.4 million people, had been forcibly displaced from other parts of the territory into Rafah, with the IDF declaring its intent to enter the city. Critics have warned about the potential for mass civilian casualties in the event of a ground invasion, with the UN secretary general António Guterres arguing that \"Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.\" On 9 February, Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to create an evacuation plan to remove civilians before launching an offensive against Rafah which is the last major population center in the Gaza Strip still under Hamas control and the elimination of Hamas was considered to be impossible as long as the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are intact. Prior to the start of the ground invasion, Israel began to intensify its strikes on Rafah from the air. More than 44 people were killed in airstrikes on Rafah on 11 February, with many likely still under the rubble. Netanyahu continued to push for a ground invasion, claiming that \"We're going to do it....Victory is within reach\".\nOn 11 February, The Wall Street Journal reported that Egypt had warned Hamas to release hostages within two weeks or face an IDF invasion of Rafah. A joint operation in Rafah by the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israel Police recovered two hostages (Fernando Marman and Luis Har) kidnapped by Hamas from Nir Yitzhak. During this operation, heavy bombardment by the IDF occurred in the area that includes many refugee camps killing 112 people with several bodies still under the rubble.\n\n2025 razing and destruction\nIn previous operations, Israel destroyed building on the border with Egypt, arguing it as a military need to cut Hamas from possible supply roads. On 3 April, about two weeks after the Gaza War resumed, the IDF advanced into Rafah as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the city.  It soon started massive operations to raze most of Rafah itself, flattening mosques, schools, greenhouses and even greenery. By mid May 2025, The New York Times reported with satellite images and on-the-ground videos proofs that most of the city housing and buildings have been purposely razed by Israeli bulldozers or controlled destructions. Side-by-side satellite imagery of the Shaboura neighborhood show it with all its pre-war buildings, then in its early-2025 state of widespread destruction, and then on 3 May 2025 with nearly all its buildings razed to the ground. The same is visible for most of the city.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a boundary between Ottoman-ruled Palestine and British-ruled Egypt, from Taba to Rafah. After World War I, Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local Bedouin. During the mid-1930s, the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town that functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population. During World War II, it became an important British base.\nFollowing the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza–Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city was now under Israeli occupation.\nIn 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty that returned the Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza–Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.\n\nDemographics\nIn 1922, Rafah's population was 599, which increased to 1,423 in 1931, increasing again to 1,635 in 1938, and further increased to 2,220 in 1945. In 1982, the total population was approximately 10,800.\nIn the 1997 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, Rafah and its adjacent camp had a combined population of 91,181, Tall as-Sultan was listed with a further 17,141. Refugees made up 80.3% of the entire population. In the 1997 census, Rafah's (together with Rafah camp) gender distribution was 50.5% male and 49.5% female.\nIn the 2006 PCBS estimate, Rafah city had a population of 71,003, Rafah camp and Tall as-Sultan form separate localities for census purposes, having populations of 59,983 and 24,418, respectively.\n\nRafah Border Crossing\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side. On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards as per the agreement signed by Egypt and Israel in November 2005.\nFollowing the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, Israel announced on October 14, 2025, that the Rafah crossing would remain closed, with no date set for its reopening. This has restricted the entry of aid.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh).\n\nSee also\nRafah Governorate\nRafah, Egypt\nIsrael–Gaza barrier\nGaza–Egypt border\nErez Crossing\nPhiladelphi Corridor\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\nWelcome To The City of Rafah Archived 19 February 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nRafah Today, pictures by Palestinian journalist Mohammed Omer\nRafah Smuggling Tunnels\nRafah Pundits: Rafah Focused Blog\nRaising Yousuf – Blog by Laila el-Hadad who is a reporter for Aljazeera living in Gaza\nReports from Rafah\nInterview with Hip Hop Artist Michael Franti Archived 14 November 2007 at the Wayback Machine – Reporting from Rafah.\nPart A Part B Satellite photos comparing 2001 to 2004.\nRazing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip – Human Rights Watch\nThe Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project – The organization started by people in the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Olympia, WA\nThe Madison-Rafah Sister City Project – A sistering project connecting the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Madison, WI",

          "content": "Rafah (en arabe : رَفَح (rafaḥ)) est une ville palestinienne située dans le Sud de la bande de Gaza, à la frontière égyptienne. La ville fut également connue sous le nom de Robihwa dans l'Égypte antique, Rafihu en Assyrie, Raphia chez les Grecs et les Romains.\nL'histoire de Rafah remonte à plusieurs millénaires, lorsque les Pharaons la développent pour assurer le contrôle de leur domaine de Canaan.\nC'est la ville la plus importante du Sud de la bande de Gaza avec plus de 250 000 habitants en 2023, dont une partie vit dans le camp de réfugiés fondé pendant la Nakba.\nElle est entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne durant la guerre de Gaza.\n\nLocalisation\nLa ville est située au sud de la bande de Gaza, à la frontière avec l’Égypte.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nL'histoire de Rafah remonte à plusieurs millénaires. La première fois que son nom est cité se situe pendant le règne du pharaon Séthi en 1303 av. J.-C., et la première campagne en Israël remonte à Sheshonq Ier en 925 av. J.-C.\nEn 720 av. J.-C., le roi assyrien Sargon II y défait les Égyptiens (Bataille de Raphia de -720), et le 22 juin 217 av. J.-C. se déroule la première grande bataille, qui voit le roi d'Égypte Ptolémée IV Philopator vaincre le dernier grand roi séleucide Antiochos III lors de la Bataille de Raphia : environ 140 000 soldats se confrontent, et près de 180 éléphants sont utilisés.\nUne source araméenne fait également de Rafah le lieu biblique de Chatzerim.\n\nMoyen Âge\nPendant la période byzantine, Rafah est un diocèse, et une importante ville commerçante avant la période arabe. Elle vit ensuite son déclin puis son abandon jusqu'au XIIe siècle. La fondation, en 1387, de Khan Younès, sur la route de Gaza, détourne les échanges régionaux vers cette nouvelle ville. Avec les Mamelouks, elle redevint une station postale.\n\nTemps modernes\nAu XVIe siècle les Ottomans y enregistrèrent un village de moins de vingt contribuables. Rafah apparaît dans les registres fiscaux ottomans de 1596 comme comptant 15 foyers, tous musulmans. \nEn 1799, l'armée française d'Orient, dirigée par le général Bonaparte, traverse Rafah lors de la campagne française en Égypte. Rafah est à la frontière entre les provinces d'Égypte et de Syrie. En 1832, la région est occupée par l'Égypte sous Muhammad Ali, occupation qui dure jusqu'en 1840.\nL'explorateur français Victor Guérin, qui visite Rafah en mai 1863, remarque deux piliers de granit que les habitants appelaient Bab el Medinet, ce qui signifie « la porte de la ville ». En 1881, l'archiduc Louis-Salvator de Habsbourg-Toscane écrit : « Des fragments de piliers de granit gris, toujours debout, jonchent la route, les champs et le sable, et nous en avons vu un gisant à moitié enfoui dans le sol... Ces piliers sont les vestiges d'un ancien temple, Raphia, et revêtent une importance particulière aux yeux des Arabes, qui les appellent Rafah, car ils marquent la frontière entre l'Égypte et la Syrie. ».\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nEn 1917, l'armée britannique s'empare de Rafah et l'utilise comme base arrière pour attaquer les Ottomans à Gaza. La présence de cette base fait partir les habitants et en 1922, la population n'est plus que de 600 personnes pour remonter à 2 500 habitants en 1948.\nAprès la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948, la ville pasea sous contrôle égyptien et accueille deux camps de réfugiés arabes provenant du territoire d'Israël fraîchement créé.\n\nOccupation israélienne\nL’armée israélienne, lors de son occupation de quatre mois de la bande de Gaza, en 1956-1957, perpètre un massacre dans le camp de Rafah, tuant 111 personnes, selon les Nations unies, deux fois plus, selon les sources palestiniennes.\nEn 1967, après la guerre des Six Jours, la ville passe sous occupation israélienne, au cours de laquelle de nouvelles tueries sous perpétrées contre la population. La population atteignait alors 55 000 habitants, dont seulement 11 000 habitent la ville proprement dite.\n\nAu mois de janvier 1972, 20 000 personnes sont expulsées et leurs maisons détruites afin de construire une colonie israélienne. \nEn 1982, la paix entre Israël et l’Égypte divise Rafah entre sa partie égyptienne et sa partie palestinienne, formalisant une frontière qui était restée abstraite durant trois quarts de siècle. Plus de trois cents maisons sont alors détruites par l’armée israélienne afin d’instaurer un « corridor de Philadelphie » le long de la frontière égyptienne.\nEn 1994, Yasser Arafat est accueilli par une marée humaine à Rafah, pour son arrivée dans la bande de Gaza permise par les accords de paix d'Oslo. Ces derniers confient à l'Autorité palestinienne la gestion des trois quarts de la bande de Gaza et d’une partie de la Cisjordanie, mais Israël continue de contrôler étroitement la frontière avec l’Égypte et des colonies, d’où de nombreux incidents.\nDepuis septembre 2000, la ville est un des hauts lieux de la seconde intifada. Elle est en effet reliée à l'Égypte par des tunnels qui servent à acheminer vers la bande de Gaza non seulement des armes, mais aussi de la nourriture, des médicaments, et tout autre objet de la vie quotidienne. Ceci explique les fréquentes incursions de l'armée israélienne dont l'efficacité et les moyens utilisés restent contestés par la communauté internationale. Le petit aéroport de Rafah, ouvert en 1998, est détruit par l’armée israélienne en 2001. C'est à Rafah que sont tués en 2003 Rachel Corrie, une Américaine de 23 ans écrasée par un bulldozer israélien, et Thomas Hurndall, un Britannique de 22 ans tué d’une balle en pleine tête, tous deux militants pacifistes.\nEn mai 2004, l'armée israélienne lance l'opération Arc-en-ciel pour tenter de mettre fin aux attaques palestiniennes, aux bombardements des villages israéliens, et particulièrement à l'utilisation des tunnels par les trafiquants d'armes à la frontière égyptienne. Cette opération détruira plusieurs centaines de maisons et fera des dizaines de morts parmi les populations civile et armée de Rafah.\n\nBlocus israélo-égyptien de l'enclave de Gaza\nÀ la suite du retrait israélien de la bande de Gaza, achevé le 12 septembre 2005, le point de passage de Rafah est géré par l'Autorité palestinienne sous surveillance vidéo de l'Union européenne.\nÀ partir de décembre 2006, de nombreux accrochages opposent miliciens du Fatah et du Hamas jusqu'à la victoire de ce dernier en juin 2007. Les autorités égyptiennes ferment la frontière en réponse à l'avancée du Hamas. Fin 2007, la mission européenne EUBAM-Rafah est suspendue. Elle est maintenue en suspens, prête à reprendre ses opérations de surveillance dès que la situation politique le permettra.\n\nGuerre de Gaza de 2008-2009\nÀ la suite de la chute du président Moubarak, les autorités égyptiennes annoncent que le blocus sera levé fin mai 2011. Les Européens espèrent pouvoir reprendre leurs activités mais en juillet 2012, ils réduisent, à nouveau, le niveau de la mission.\n\nL'attentat du 7 juillet 2017 à Rafah est une attaque terroriste islamiste à la voiture piégée faisant 23 morts et 30 blessés. Le groupe terroriste État islamique revendique l'attaque. Deux voitures piégées ont explosé en traversant deux points de contrôle de l'armée dans la province du Sinaï à la frontière avec la bande de Gaza faisant 23 morts et 30 blessés.\n\nGuerre de 2023-2024\nLors de l'offensive israélienne de 2023-2024 sur la bande de Gaza de la guerre à Gaza, près de 1,5 million de Gazaouis trouvent refuge, sur ordre de l’armée israélienne, à Rafah. À partir de mars 2024, l’armée israélienne concentre ses attaques sur Rafah et mène des opérations militaires dans et autour de plusieurs hôpitaux, tandis que le gouvernement israélien se déclare déterminé à lancer une vaste offensive terrestre dans cette zone malgré la présence massive de réfugiés. Le responsable des territoires palestiniens au Programme alimentaire mondial de l’ONU, Matthew Hollingworth, avertit sur la situation humanitaire catastrophique : « il n’y a pas un autre endroit dans le monde où un aussi grand nombre de personnes font face à une famine imminente ».\n\nLe 7 mai 2024, après la fermeture par Israël du poste-frontière de Kerem Shalom, l'armée israélienne prend le contrôle du poste-frontière de Rafah de façon à verrouiller la bande de Gaza, Israël affirmant que le Hamas l'utilisait à des fins terroristes.\n\nLe 26 mai 2024, l'armée israélienne bombarde le camp de réfugiés de Tel al-Sultan, déclenchant un incendie et tuant une cinquantaine de personnes dont cinq enfants, et faisant des centaines de blessés. Le 28 mai, au moins 37 Palestiniens sont tués dans de nouveaux bombardements sur le quartier de Tel al-Sultan. Le 30 mai, au moins 12 Palestiniens sont tués dans un bombardement aérien sur Rafah. Le Croissant-Rouge palestinien annonce le 30 mai la mort de deux de ses secouristes, tués dans « une frappe israélienne directe » contre une ambulance dans la région de Rafah.\nLe 27 mai 2024, en réaction à l'offensive, un utilisateur du réseau social Instagram partage une image reprenant le slogan All Eyes on Rafah. Largement partagée dans le monde entier et vue par 47 millions de personnes en 48 heures, elle devient l'un des symboles du soutien à la cause palestinienne. \nÀ la fin du mois de mai, tous les hôpitaux sont hors service à cause des bombardements. L'ONU qualifie la situation à Rafah d'« enfer sur terre ».\nDébut juin, plus d'un million de personnes ont été déplacées de force de Rafah après plusieurs semaines d'offensive israélienne.\nLe 6 juin, l'armée israélienne bombarde une école de l’Unrwa, tuant 37 personnes qui y étaient réfugiées.\nLe 23 mars 2025, l'armée israélienne massacre à Rafah quinze secouristes, dans le quartier de Tal Al-Sultan, alors qu’ils venaient en aide aux victimes d’une frappe aérienne. Le 31, Tsahal ordonne à la population de quitter la ville, provoquant un exode.\nEn avril 2025 l'armée israélienne déclenche une nouvelle offensive sur Rafah, affirmant le 12 avril encercler totalement la ville.

          "content": "Beit Jala (Arabic: ) is a Palestinian Christian town in the Bethlehem Governorate of Palestine, in the West Bank. Beit Jala is located 10 km (6.2 mi)10 km south of Jerusalem, on the western side of the Hebron road, opposite Bethlehem, at 825 meters (2,707 ft) altitude. In 2017, Beit Jala had 13,484 inhabitants according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. About 80% of the population were Christians (mostly Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and about 20% Muslims.\nSaint Nicholas – the inspiration for Santa Claus – is the patron saint of Beit Jala, where the Church of Saint Nicholas was built over a crypt where it is believed he lived for a couple years during his time in Palestine.\n\nEtymology\nConder and Kitchener identified Beit Jala with Galem or Gallim (Γαλλιμ) of the Septuagint, a place in the 9th district of the inheritance of Judah; homonymous with a settlement in Benjamin NE of Jerusalem.\n\nHistory\nByzantine period\nA crypt, dating to the 5th or 6th century C.E., was located under the Church of Saint Nicholas in Beit Jala.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the Crusader era, the village was called Apezala, and the Church of Saint Nicholas was possibly rebuilt during that time.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. In this century, Beit Jala was a large village of Christian and  peasants and it had over ten elders (akabir) who functioned as leaders, with each religious group having separate sets of leaders. Rare for a single village, it and nearby Bethlehem, served as its own separate jurisdiction instead of being grouped with other villages into a nahiya. In April 1531, when an Ottoman official went to Beit Jala to register the village's grapevines for tax purposes, the residents refused to seriously answer his questions and mocked the authority of the Ottoman sultan, marking a notable episode of initial local resistance to the Ottoman taxation methods and procedures. By the end of the 16th century, Beit Jala was almost entirely inhabited by Christians. Beit Jala's size rendered it similar to that of a town, with the village being subdivided into four quarters. The village produced more wheat and barley than surrounding localities and like other villages south of Jerusalem, grape cultivation was greater than olive cultivation. Beit Jala was taxed on these agricultural products as well as figs, honeybees, and goats. It contained one of the six olive presses in the subdistrict of Jerusalem in the 16th century. Despite its large size, Beit Jala was relatively poorer than other villages in the subdistrict.\nIn the 1596 tax-records, it appeared as Bayt Jala, located in the Nahiya of Jabal Quds of the Liwa of Al-Quds. The population was 245 households; 6 Muslims and 239 Christians. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, which included  wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 30,000 akçe.\nIn 1697 Henry Maundrell passed Beit Jala, and noted that: \"no Turk can live in it above two years. By virtue of this report, whether true or false, the Christians keep the Village to themselves without molestation; no Turk being willing to stake his life experimenting the truth of it.\"\nIn the 17th century, the Christians of Beit Jala offered to become Catholic if the Franciscans paid their jizya tax.\nBeit Jala's inhabitants participated in the 1834 peasants' revolt in Palestine against Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian governor of Syria. Beit Jala's residents were believed to have taken part in the looting of Egyptian property and on 31 May, Egyptian troops assaulted the village. Ibrahim Pasha put a stop to the attack, but at least 33 men and women were killed in the attack. In addition, the village's livestock was seized. The attack on Beit Jala prompted rebels from the Ta'amira tribe, a local Bedouin tribe, to enter into Bethlehem to help bolster its defense.\nIn 1838, it was noted as a Greek Christian village, located in the Beni Hasan area, west of Jerusalem. The population was estimated to be around 2000 people.\nBy the mid-19th century, there were 10 Catholics living in Beit Jala. The Latin Patriarchate founded its first parish in Palestine in Beit Jala in 1853. The establishment of the parish faced fierce resistance by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the inhabitants of Beit Jala, leading to several skirmishes and official complaints to the Ottoman authorities by both sides. A Latin church was built in Beit Jala and inaugurated on 18 April 1858. The Jerusalem Society, a Protestant movement struggled to maintain a presence in Beit Jala in the late 19th century. When a clash between Orthodox and Protestant residents ended with the death of an Orthodox girl, the village's Protestant community was evacuated to al-Karak in Transjordan for six months until compensation was paid to the family of the slain girl. In 1866, the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire purchased land in Beit Jala and built a girls' school, the first Russian school to be built in Palestine. It had 60 pupils by 1880 and was assigned a Russian principal. In 1886, it became a teachers' training school and was under the administration of the Palestinian Orthodox Imperial Society.\nAlbert Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that Beit Jala had 234 houses and a population of 874 \"Latins\", though the population count included men, only. Martin Hartmann found that Beit Jala  had 232  houses.\nIn 1883, the  PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Jala as: \"A large and flourishing village of white well-built stone houses, on the slope of a steep hill. The water supply is artificial, with a well in the valley below. The population is said by Pere Lievin to amount to 3,000, of whom 420 are Catholics, and the rest Orthodox Greeks. There is a Greek and a Latin church in the village. There are remarkably fine groves of olives round and beneath the village, and the hill is covered with vineyards which belong to the place.\"\nIn 1896 the population of Beit Jala was estimated to be about 2,880  persons.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Beit Jala had a population of 3,101; 3,060 Christians and 41 Muslims; where the Christians consisted of 2,628 Orthodox, 358 Roman Catholics, 4 Greek Catholic (Melkites), and 1 each of the Armenian Catholic, Maronite and the Coptic Church. In the 1931 census the population had decreased to 2,731; 2,529 Christians, 198 Muslims, 3 with \"no religion\" and 1 Jew; in a total of 631 inhabited houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics  the population of Beit Jala was 3,710; 200 Muslims and 3,510 Christians, with 13,307 (rural) and 737 (urban) dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 9,860 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 1,064 for cereals, while 737 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nBy the end of the Mandate, the population of Beit Jala was apprixmately 4,000.\n\nJordanian period\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Beit Jala came under Jordanian rule.\nThe Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) began relief operations for refugees in the West Bank in 1950. They also worked with Palestinians who had retained their houses and so were not technically refugees, but who had lost their land or means of making a living because of the war. As part of this relief, the MCC founded a school in Beit Jala which was still in operation as of 1979.\nIn 1952, an Israel Defense Forces reprisal raid in Beit Jala killed seven civilians; one man, two women and three children. A complaint was lodged that Israel had violated the General Armistice agreement. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation of Israel for breaching the agreement.\nIn 1961, the population of Beit Jala was  7,966.\n\nPost 1967\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Jala has been under Israeli occupation. Control of the town was assumed by the Palestinian Authority following the 1993 Oslo Accords. According to the Beit Jala Municipality, the city's land holdings have been relegated under different areas of administration. Area A comprises approximately 3,500 dunums, or about 25% of the town's land, which is under Palestinian control. The remaining 75% (Area C) is under Israeli jurisdiction, and 7% of the total Area C is located inside the Municipality border.\nAccording to ARIJ, after the war Israel confiscated 3,147 dunums of Beit Jala land in order to expand the Jerusalem municipal boundaries, later taking further land for the two Israeli settlements of Gilo and Har Gilo, the West Bank barrier and bypass roads.\nDuring the Second Intifada, militants from the Fatah-affiliated Tanzim group used Beit Jala as a base for launching sniper and mortar attacks on the  Israeli settlement of Gilo. Gilo is located on a hilltop across from Beit Jala, partially built on the lands of Beit Jala, Beit Safafa and Sharafat. The Israeli government built a concrete barrier and installed bulletproof windows in homes and schools facing Beit Jala.\n\nMilitants were reported to have used the houses of Palestinian Christian residents to fire on Israeli targets in Gilo. Fighters were initially welcomed by residents, but after their homes were attacked by Israeli retaliatory fire and several fighters and residents were killed, they no longer tolerated the militants' presence. According to John Bunzl, the Israeli press used the incident to suggest there was a Christian-Muslim conflict in the incidents, with the former trying to prevent an attack until the Muslims forced them to surrender. Numerous statements taken from Christian residents appear to refute this. In August 2001, the Israeli Army occupied the northeastern corner of Beit Jala, declaring that it would only leave when the gunfire on Gilo stopped. Two days later, the troops withdrew. Palestinian militants subsequently increased their attacks, adding mortars and heavy machine guns. According to Time magazine, the Palestinian militants were not locals, but took up positions in Beit Jala due to its proximity to Gilo. In August 2010, after a long period of calm, the concrete barrier built to protect Gilo was removed.\nThe Israel barrier in the West Bank will separate over 50 Beit Jala families from their land; although Israel says it is a vital security measure. Palestinians believe the ultimate aim of the barrier is a land grab as it is built inside the occupied West Bank on land Palestinians want for a future independent state. Local church leaders - Latin Catholic and Greek Orthodox - have been involved in the campaign to prevent the construction of the barrier.\n\nGeography\nThe Israel bypass road known as the Tunnels Highway passes directly underneath Beit Jala.\n\nDemographics\nThis town's Christian inhabitants are made up of five Christian tribes that trace their origins as Aramaic-and Arabic speaking people who lived in that area near Bethlehem prior to the Muslim conquest in 634. At the 1931 census of Palestine the population of Beit Jala was 2,732. This included 196 Muslims, 2,532 Christians, and one Jew. In 1947, Beit Jala had a population of approximately 3,700. In 1967, according to a census conducted by the Israeli Army Command, the population was 6,041. The population in 2007 was 11,758 according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nEconomy\nCremisan Cellars, located in the Cremisan monastery, is an important local winemaker. The winery has operated since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1997. Beit Jala was once famous for its pork, olive oil, apricots and stone masonry. Other economic branches are tobacco, textiles, agriculture and pharmaceuticals. The Beit Jala Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company (formerly Jordan Chemical Laboratory) was established in 1958 to manufacture generic drug pharmaceutical products for the local market.\nThe West Bank Barrier is being extended to encircle the area, splitting the monastery, which would end up on the Israeli side, from the sister Salesian convent, and making access to this recreational area for Beit Jala residents very difficult. 57 Christian families are slated to lose their agricultural property.\n\nHealth care\nBeit Jala has a government-run 113-bed hospital, and a 77-bed privately run specialized surgery hospital operated by the Arab Society for Rehabilitation. Primary health care is provided by the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health. In addition, there are many charities, medical institutions and private health clinics. Societies for the disabled in Beit Jala include the Bethlehem Arab Society, Lifegate Rehabilitation and House Jemima, a Dutch-founded home and daycare-center for children with mental disabilities. Al-Hussein Governmental Hospital, Beit Jala is a government hospital here.\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nBeit Jala is home to educational institutions run by a variety of Christian denominations, including the Arab Orthodox Benevolent Society. A Russian Orthodox school was established in 1866. The Latin Patriarchate Seminary, which supervises religious liturgical education in the Jerusalem Patriarchate, moved to Beit Jala in 1936.\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land (ELCJHL) has a congregation in Beit Jala. The denomination also runs the Talitha Kumi School in Beit Jala, which was founded by Lutheran deaconesses in the 19th century and relocated in Beit Jala in 1961. The school has developed an environmental education program and operates the only bird-ringing station in the Palestinian sector. The school also runs a guesthouse.\n\nThe Beit Jala skyline is dominated by several churches, among them the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of St. Michael, and the Church of Saint Nicholas. According to tradition, St. Nicholas spent four years in a cave beneath the Church. These three churches belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. The Latin Church of Annunciation is the Catholic church built in 1850.\nThe Syriac Orthodox Church runs the Mar Afram school in Beit Jala. In 2007, Mar Afram started offering classes in Aramaic (more specifically, Syriac Aramaic) to its students, which were taught by elderly residents of the town who still spoke the waning language fluently.\n\nLocal government\nIn the 2005 municipal election, six seats went to the United Beit Jala list (Fatah and Palestinian People's Party), five seats went to Sons of the Land (PFLP and independents), one seat went to Independent Beit Jala Group and one candidate was elected as an independent. The most popular candidate was Raji George Jadallah Zeidan of United Jala with 2,892 votes, followed by Nadir Antoun Issa Abu Amsha of Sons of the Land with 1764 votes.\n\nSports\nThe Beit Jala Lions is a rugby club active in Beit Jala since 2007. Hailed as the first all-Palestinian rugby team in history, the team is made up almost exclusively of residents of Beit Jala.\n\nProminent people from Beit Jala\nTawfiq Canaan\nToni Qattan\nGhassan Zaqtan\n\nInternational relations\nBeit Jala is twin or sister cities with:\n\n La Calera, Chile\n Aubervilliers, France\n Bergisch Gladbach, Germany\n Jena, Germany\n Varazze, Italy\n Santa Maria del Mar District, Peru\nBeit Jala has friendship agreements with:\n\n Grenoble, France\n Reggio Emilia, Italy\n Trento, Italy\nRepresentatives from Beit Jala and Valfabbrica, Italy, signed a Declaration of Intent in 2012.\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nPalestinian diaspora\nWest Bank\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Site of Beit Jala\nWelcome To The City of Bayt Jala\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nBeit Jala City (Fact Sheet),  Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nBeit Jala City Profile, (ARIJ)\nBeit Jala City Area Photo, (ARIJ)\nThe priorities and needs for development in Beit Jala city based on the community and local authorities’ assessment, (ARIJ)\nTalitha Kumi School\nHouse Jemima\nLifegate Rehabilitation\nBethlehem Arab Society for Rehabilitation\nNativity Hotel in Beit Jala",

En 2007, Beit Jala comptait 11 758 habitants, majoritairement chrétiens avec une minorité musulmane. Près de 100 000 personnes vivant au Chili et dans les Amériques descendent d'habitants ayant émigré pour fuir les combats au cours du siècle passé.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville se trouve à 825 m d'altitude en moyenne (son point culminant est à 925 m) à l'ouest de la route d'Hébron et s'étend sur 14 km2.\nSa pluviométrie est de 700 mm. Les précipitations tombent surtout en hiver, entre fin novembre et fin février, avec rarement de la neige. La température monte parfois à 39 degrés à midi en été.\nLes températures moyennes sont de 9 à 18 °C en hiver et de 26 à 30 °C en été.\n\nHistoire\nDes traces de peuplement datent de l'âge de la pierre vers 200 000 av. J.-C. Il est certain que l'endroit était peuplé par les Cananéens en 3 000 av. J.-C. comme à Bethléem.\nLes ruines les plus anciennes attestant de l'implantation d'une communauté permanente datent de l'époque byzantine aux IIIe et IVe siècles, lorsque des moines, comme saint Nicolas se sont installés ici pour être près du lieu de naissance du Christ. C'est ainsi qu'est construit le monastère Saint-Georges sur la colline. Ses vestiges sont visibles dans la crypte de l'église Saint-Nicolas actuelle, ainsi qu'une grotte où saint Nicolas aurait vécu. Depuis cette époque le village s'est peuplé de chrétiens sans discontinuer.\nBeit Jala et Bethléem ont été ravagés par la rébellion samaritaine de 529 et la région est conquise par le calife Oumar en 637. Les croisés installent un clergé catholique en 1099 qui est expulsé en 1187 par Saladin. La Palestine est conquise par les Ottomans en 1516 et Beit Jala connaît une vie prospère. La sultane haseki Roxelane crée un imaret (soupe populaire) à Jérusalem en 1552. Cet imaret de Roxelane est financé par les impôts de plusieurs villages, affectés à un waqf (fondation pieuse) chargé d’entretenir l’imaret.\nAu XVIIe siècle, la décadence de l'Empire ottoman impose de plus en plus de taxes et de conscriptions forcées d'enfants chrétiens obligés d'abjurer leur foi pour devenir entre autres janissaires. Méhémet Ali d'Égypte occupe la région de 1831 à 1840 et il en est chassé par les Turcs revenus grâce à l'aide des Britanniques. L'émigration des chrétiens, plus éduqués que la moyenne, commence alors à la fin du XIXe siècle, notamment en Argentine et au Chili. C'est à cette époque aussi que les missionnaires orthodoxes russes, catholiques français, britanniques anglicans et allemands luthériens s'intéressent à la région et obtiennent le droit d'ouvrir des écoles et des missions.\n\nLes autorités israéliennes ont confisqué depuis 1967 10 000 dounams sur les 15 000 appartenant à la commune, pour la fondation des colonies juives de Gilo, Har Gilo et Givat Hamatos.\n\nProjet de mur israélien\nEn juillet 2015, la Cour Suprême israélienne a autorisé un mur de séparation dans la vallée de Beit Jala, un projet auquel les Palestiniens s'opposent.\n\nReligion\nLa ville comprend six églises et deux mosquées, dont:\n\nÉglise Saint-Nicolas, église grecque-orthodoxe (la plus importante) reconstruite en 1925\nÉglise Sainte-Marie, église grecque-orthodoxe (la plus ancienne)\nÉglise Saint-Georges, église grecque-orthodoxe\nÉglise catholique de l'Annonciation\nÉglise de la Réformation, église luthérienne fondée par la Jerusalemsverein\nCouvent des Salésiens de Don Bosco (1885) sur les ruines d'un monastère byzantin (VIIe siècle), comprenant un chai renommé pour la viticulture des vignes alentour\nDepuis 2014, les chrétiens de rite syriaque de Beit Jala peuvent s’enregistrer au sein de l’ethnie officielle des Araméens.\n\nÉducation\nLa ville accueille quatre écoles élémentaires et secondaires publiques qui scolarisent 45 % des élèves (1 774 élèves) et six écoles privées confessionnelles qui scolarisent 55 % des élèves (2 133 élèves) dont la célèbre école Talitha Kumi fondée ici en 1951.

          "content": "Beit Sahour or Beit Sahur (Arabic: بيت ساحور, romanized: ; Palestine grid 170/123) is a Palestinian town east of Bethlehem, in the Bethlehem Governorate of the West Bank in the State of Palestine. The city is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority. The population was of 13,281 in 2017, consisting of approximately 80% Christians (most of them Greek Orthodox) and 20% Muslims.\nChristian tradition holds Beit Sahour to be the site of the Annunciation to the Shepherds. There are two enclosures in the eastern part of Beit Sahour that are claimed by different Christian denominations to be the actual 'Shepherds Field': one belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church, and the other, the Catholic site, belonging to the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.\nThe mainly Christian Palestinian inhabitants are being pressured by encroaching Israeli settlements, with one housing development threatened with demolition.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Beit Sahour has been translated variously as \"House of the Magicians\" by Palmer (1881), and more recently on Palestinian websites as \"House of Vigilance\" or literally as \"House of the Night Watch\".\nModern Beit Sahour is also known as Beit Sahur an-Nasara (\"Beit Sahur of the Christians\"). Another, former village near Jerusalem, known as Beit Sahur al-Atiqah (\"ancient Beit Sahur\") or Beit Sahour al-Wadi (\"Beit Sahur of the Valley\"), is fully distinct from the town of Beit Sahour in the Bethlehem Governorate.\n\nHistory\nOrigins and early demographics\nAccording to local tradition, Beit Sahour was uninhabited until the 14th century when a number of Muslim and Christian families from Wadi Musa near Petra (today in Jordan) settled in caves on the site of the modern village. Another Christian family of Wadi Musa, from the remnants of the Ghassanids, arrived in the 17th century. Further immigration in the 18th century from Rashda in Upper Egypt, Shobak in Transjordan and Al-Kukaliya \"in Syria\" cemented the Christian character of the village.\nIn spite of the influx of Christian families, they remained in the minority all until 1839, when Muslims from Palestine fought in the armies led by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt in his war against the Turkish Sultan. Huge losses, due mainly to heat and dehydration rather than battle, meant that three quarters of the male Muslims of Beit Sahour perished, leaving the Christians in the majority.\n\nOttoman period\nBeit Sahour, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1525/26 (AH 932), Beit Sahur an-Nasara ('Christian Beit Sahur') had 5 Christian and 7 Muslim households, increasing in 1538/39 (AH 945) to 8 Christian and 8 Muslim households. By 1553/34 (AH 961), 13 Christian and 21 Muslim households were noted, and in 1562/63 (AH 970), 9 Christian and 17 Muslim households were counted. In 1596, Beit Sahur an-Nasara was registered as a village in the nahiyah of Quds (Jerusalem) of the Liwa of Quds, with a total population of 24 households; 15 Muslim and 9 Christian. The villages paid taxes on the same products as the villagers of Beit Sahur al-Atiqah.\nThe Franciscans ceased holding religious services at the shrine by Shepherd's Field around 1820. In 1864 a new Roman Catholic church and school were completed.\nAn Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Beit Sahour el-foka (\"upper Beit Sahour\") had a population of 37 \"Latins\" (Catholics) in 11 houses, and 187 \"Greeks\" (Eastern Orthodox) in 48 houses, bringing the total population of both villages, Beit Sahour el-foka and Beit Sahour et-tahta (\"lower Beit Sahour\"), to 190 (men only) in 76 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Sahur as:\n\nThis village is a sort of suburb of Bethlehem, situated on the same ridge, with the broad plateau east of it known as the 'Shepherd's Field' ... [with] the small Greek Church of the Grotto of the Shephard, a subterranean chapel reached by 20 steps, containing pictures and mosaic. Above the vault are ruins with a Latin altar. Bait Sahur contains a well-built modern house belonging to the Latin curé, and is surrounded with olives and vines.\nIn 1896 the population of Beit Sahour was estimated to be about 861 persons. A construction text, dating to 1897, engraved in the lintel of a door on Municipality Street has been examined, and was found to be a poem in 19th century Christian naskhi script.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bait Sahur had a population 1,519; 285 Muslims and 1,234 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 1,942; 395 Muslims and 1,547 Christians, in a total of 454 houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Beit Sahour was 2,770; 370 Muslims and 2,400 Christians, who owned 6,946 (rural) and 138 (urban) dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. 1,031 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,641 for cereals, while 100 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian annexation\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Beit Sahur was annexed by Jordan along with the rest of the West Bank.\nIn 1961, the population of Beit Sahur was 5,316.\n\nIsraeli occupation\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Sahour has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 5,380.\nAccording to ARIJ, 52.8% of the village land is classified as being in Area A, while the remaining 47.2% is in Area C. From 1997 and onwards, Israel has confiscated hundred of dunams of village land for the construction of the Israeli settlement of Har Homa. The mainly Christian Palestinian inhabitants are being pressured by encroaching Israeli settlements, with one housing development being ruled as illegal by an Israeli court in the early 2000s and, as of 2013, standing under threat of demolition.\n\nEconomy\nThe town's economy is largely based on tourism and related industries, such as the manufacture of olive-wood carvings. Agriculture and work in Israel also play a significant role. The town had a prominent role in the Palestinian national \"Bethlehem 2000\" project, as extensive renovations of tourist sites, hotels and businesses, and historic sites were carried out prior to the millennium celebrations.\nDuring the First Intifada, residents in the town had attempted to develop their own dairy industry—a move resisted by Israeli authorities. These efforts were documented in 2014 film The Wanted 18, co-directed by Palestinian filmmaker Amer Shomali and Canadian Paul Cowan.\nSocial and economic development were disrupted by the Second Intifada.\n\nPolitical activism\nBeit Sahour is a center of Palestinian political activism. The town played a key role in the First and Second Intifadas, with local activists pioneering nonviolent resistance techniques. During the First Intifada and the Second Intifada, the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples (PCR) based in Beit Sahour encouraged non-violent activism under the aegis of the International Solidarity Movement. George Rishmawi is director of PCR. During the First Intifada, the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples issued an invitation to Israelis of goodwill to come and spend a weekend (Shabbat) in Palestinian homes using the slogan \"Break Bread, Not Bones\".\nThe Alternative Information Center is also partly based in the town. Elias Rishmawi, a member of the Beit Sahour council, is co-founder, together with Ghassan Andoni, Majed Nassar, Rifat Odeh Kassis and Jamal Salameh, of the Alternative Tourism Group (ATG), a non-governmental organisation specializing in tours of the Palestinian territories, where the olive harvest is used as a backdrop for showing the effects of the Israeli occupation and land confiscation on the Palestinian population.\n\nTax resistance\nIn 1989, during the First Intifada, the Palestinian resistance (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, UNLU) and Ghassan Andoni and Kamel Danoun, urged people to stop paying taxes to Israel, which inherited and modified the previous Jordanian tax-collection regime in the West Bank. \"No taxation without representation,\" said a statement from the organizers. \"The military authorities do not represent us, and we did not invite them to come to our land. Must we pay for the bullets that kill our children or for the expenses of the occupying army?\" The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an organized citywide tax strike that included refusal to pay and file tax returns.\nIsraeli defense minister Yitzhak Rabin responded: \"We will teach them there is a price for refusing the laws of Israel.\" The Israeli military authorities placed the town under curfew for 42 days, blocked food shipments into the town, cut telephone lines to the town, tried to bar reporters from the town, imprisoned ten residents (among them Fuad Kokaly and Rifat Odeh Kassis) and seized in house-to-house raids millions of dollars in money and property belonging to 350 families. The Israeli military stopped the consuls-general of Belgium, Britain, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden when they attempted to go to Beit Sahour and investigate the conditions there during the tax strike.\nIsrael's military occupation had the authority to create and enforce taxes beyond the baseline Jordanian code enacted in 1963 in areas formerly administered by that country, including Beit Sahour. During the Intifada, they used that authority to impose taxes on Palestinians as collective punishment measures to discourage the Intifada, for instance \"the glass tax (for broken windows), the stones tax (for damage done by stones), the missile tax (for Gulf War damage), and a general intifada tax, among others.\"\nThe United Nations Security Council considered a resolution demanding that Israel return the property it confiscated during the Beit Sahour tax resistance. The United States vetoed the resolution, which was supported by the other eleven council members.\n\nDevelopment projects\n'Ush Ghurab, a hill occupied by a military base until 2006, is now the site of a development project. A restaurant, a climbing tower, a football field and a park are being built on the hillside. The municipality of Beit Sahour also has plans for a hospital and a sports center.\n\nMunicipal government\nThe municipal council of Beit Sahour was established by the British Mandate on April 16, 1926, but was formally implemented in 1929. Prior to that date, the first village council was established in 1925 at the initiative of the citizens of Beit Sahour. The village council developed into a municipal council in 1955 under the chairmanship of Nicola Abu Eita.\nIn the 2005 municipal election, two lists gained seats in the municipal council. Eight seats went to 'United Beit Sahour' and five to 'Sons of Beit Sahour'. The most popular vote was for Hani Naji Atallah Abdel Masieh of United Beit Sahour with 2,690 votes, followed by Elen Michael Saliba Qsais of Sons of Bethlehem with 2,280 votes.\n\nDemography\nAccording to the 1984 census, there were 8,900 Beit Sahouris. 67% were Greek Orthodox, 17% were Sunni Muslim, 8% were Latin Catholic, 6% were Greek Catholic and 2% were Lutheran.\n\n\"Shepherds' Field\" pilgrimage churches\nThe old core of Beit Sahour is reputed to be close to the place where, according to the New Testament, an angel announced the birth of Jesus to the shepherds—the \"Annunciation to the shepherds\". The eastern part of Beit Sahour is home to two sites alleged to be the biblical \"Shepherds' Field\".\n\nGreek Orthodox monastery\nKenisat er-Ruwat is the name of the site where, according to tradition, St. Helena built a convent, which is today known as the shepherd's cave. The Franciscans acquired a shrine there in 1347.\nThe Status Quo, a 250-year old understanding between religious communities, applies in principle to the site, although no concrete regulations could be found.\nThe new Greek Orthodox monastery, which includes on its grounds the ancient church, was established through the efforts of Archimandrite Serapheim Savvaitis as a metochion of the Lavra of St. Sabbas between 1971 and 1989.\n\nCatholic monastery\nThe Catholic site belongs to the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land and includes the Chapel of the Shepherds' Field, along with two cave chapels and the ruins of a Byzantine monastery known in Arabic as Khirbet Siyar el-Ghanem (\"Ruins of the Sheepfold\").\n\nArchaeology\nKhirbet Umm-Toba\nWithin the environs of Beit Sahour is the ruin Khirbet Umm Toba. An archaeological survey-excavation was conducted at the site in 2010, 2013 and 2016 by Zubair Adawi on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), which yielded pottery from the Byzantine era. Some had surmised that the site may have been the Caphartobas of Josephus.\n\nKhirbet Beit Bassa\nIn the southern outskirts of the village is the ruin Khirbet Beit Bassa, which is identified with Bethbassi, a fortress in the toparchy of Herodium in which Hasmonean leader Jonathan Appus was besieged by Seleucid general Bacchides.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBeit Sahour is twinned with many cities and communes across the world.\n\nNotable people\nGhassan Andoni (b. 1956), physics professor and non-violent resistance activist\nLaila al-Atrash (1948–2021),  writer and journalist\nIsraa Ghrayeb, 2019 \"honour killing\" victim\nMunther Isaac (b. 1979), pastor, author, and theologian\nRifat Odeh Kassis, human rights and community activist active since the 1990s\nFuad Kokaly (b. 1962), former mayor, politician and diplomat\nQustandi Shomali (b. 1946), professor of history\nMazin B.

It surrounded the tomb of Sheikh Ahmad al-Sahuri, a local saint to whom the local Arab tribe of al-Sawahreh Mujir al-Din mentions this place in a biography of a Muslim scholar Sha'ban bin Salim bin Sha'ban, who died in Beit Sahur al-Atiqah in 1483 at the age of 105. \nIn 1596, Beit Sahour al-Wadi appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the nahiyah of Quds of the Liwa of Quds. Beit Sahour al-Wadi had a population of 40 Muslim households. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,500 akçe. All of the revenue went to waqfs; half of which was to the madrasah Muzhiriyya in Jerusalem.\nThe place was noted by French geographer Guerin in 1863 as being 40 minutes south-east of Jerusalem, a short distance south of the Kidron Valley.\nAn Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Beit Sahour et-Tahta (\"the lower Beit Sahour\") [mislabelled?] had a population of 66 (whereby only \nmen were counted), with a total of 17 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the place as: \"Ruins of a village with wells and a mukam.\" Clermont-Ganneau found here several old tombs in the 1890s.\n\nSee also\nHerodium, nearby major archaeological site\nPalestinian Christians\nPalestinian diaspora\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBeit Sahour Municipality\nHistory of Beit Sahour residents\nBeit Sahour City\nWelcome To The City of Bayt Sahur\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nBeit Sahour City Profile, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ), 2010\np.35, also separately as \"The priorities and needs for development in Beit Sahour city based on the community and local authorities' assessment\"\nBeit Sahour, A living Heritage on YouTube",

Sa population était de 12 367 habitants en 2007 dont 80 % de chrétiens et 20 % de musulmans.\n\nGéographie\nBeit Sahour se trouve à l'est de Bethléem qu'elle jouxte, et à côté de Beit Jala. Elle fait partie du gouvernorat de Bethléem. La municipalité s'étend sur une surface de 6,9 km2 (6 945 dunams).\n\nHistoire\nLa ville est construite sur le lieu supposé du champ des bergers qui ont assisté ensuite à la naissance du Christ. Une église et un monastère y sont construits par l'impératrice Hélène. On peut y visiter la grotte des bergers.\nBeit Sahour fait partie des territoires occupés par Israël depuis 1967. La ville a joué un rôle-clé dans les dernières Intifadas, grâce à des techniques de résistance non-violente, sous l'égide de l'International Solidarity Movement, dont l'opération « No Taxation Without Cooperation ».\n\nGrève de l'impôt\nLa ville de Beit Sahour est célèbre en raison d'une grève de l'impôt menée par ses habitants en septembre 1989. Le mouvement de désobéissance fiscale est lancé dans le cadre de la première intifada. Il vise la fiscalité réclamée par Israël, pays occupant la Cisjordanie. Le conseil municipal publie une déclaration de soutien à la grève à l'intention du gouvernement israélien, déclarant que « pendant 20 ans d'occupation, vous pensiez que nous étions satisfaits, puis est venue l'Intifada pour vous dire que nous voulons notre liberté et que ne pas payer d'impôts est une forme de résistance non violente à votre occupation » et ajoutant qu'« en nous traitant comme une colonie d'Israël, vous pratiquez l'imposition sans légitimité ». Les habitants de la ville affirment avoir réussi à résister au blocus imposé en réaction par Israël, seul un petit nombre d'entre eux ayant choisi d'interrompre la grève et de payer volontairement des taxes aux autorités israéliennes, tout en affirmant que la ville était devenue un symbole international de la résistance non violente à l'occupation israélienne.\n\nReligion\nÉglise catholique du Champ des Bergers, appartenant à la custodie franciscaine de Terre Sainte (Der es-Siar), construite en 1953-1954 sur les ruines d'une basilique (octogonale) de la Nativité du Ve siècle.\nMonastère orthodoxe du Champ des Bergers (Der er'Rawat), et son église souterraine consacrée à la Mère-de-Dieu, avec la grotte des Bergers, et une église construite récemment.\nChapelle de la Fontaine de Marie (Bir as-Sydah), au-dessus de la fontaine à laquelle s'est abreuvée Marie pendant sa Fuite en Égypte, le puits a été creusé par Jacob, fils d'Isaac.\n\nÉconomie\nL'économie de la ville est largement axée sur le tourisme et les activités de pèlerinages, et le commerce qui y est lié, comme l'artisanat de sculpture sur bois d'olivier, ou la broderie. Grâce au programme gouvernemental « Bethléem 2000 », la ville a bénéficié de la réhabilitation de ses infrastructures touristiques et de la rénovation de son parc hôtelier, pour la célébration du bimillénaire de la naissance de Jésus.\nLa ville possède aussi des fabriques de textile et de produits chimiques.\n\nCulture populaire\nLe film de 2014 Les 18 Fugitives illustre les efforts de certains habitants de Beit Sahour pour créer une coopérative laitière durant la grève de l'impôt.\n\nJumelage\nAulnoye-Aymeries (France) depuis 1999\n Vaulx-en-Velin (France) depuis 2008\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nTerritoires palestiniens occupés\nChrétiens palestiniens\n\nLiens externes\n(en) « Beit Sahour: The Town of Unruly Shepherds », Hirbawi,‎ 26 octobre 2022 (lire en ligne, consulté le 21 juin 2025).\n\nSite officiel\nRessource relative à la géographie : Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire  \n\n Portail de la Palestine",

          "content": "Battir (Arabic: بتير, Hebrew: ביתר) is a Palestinian village in the Bethlehem Governorate of the State of Palestine, in the West Bank, 6.4 km west of Bethlehem, and southwest of Jerusalem. In 2017, the village had a population of 4,696.\nBattir has long history that dates back to ancient times. Within its area is an archaeological site containing the remains of Beitar, an ancient Jewish village and the last stronghold of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. The village is particularly known for its ancient terraces and an irrigation system that dates back to the Roman period. Due to this, In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the List of World Heritage Sites as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, under the name Battir – Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem.\nBattir was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.\n\nEtymology\nThe Arabic name Battīr preserves the name Betar, an ancient Jewish town destroyed in the Bar Kokhba revolt, whose ruins can be found within the present-day village. The name is first recorded in the Septuagint, in a verse missing from the Masoretic Text, as Bαιθηρ, or in some manuscripts Θεθηρ.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nBattir is built just north east of Khirbet el-Yahud (Arabic: خربة اليهود, lit. 'Ruin of the Jews'), also known as Tel Beitar, an archeological site that comprises the ruins of ancient Betar. It was continuously inhabited since the Iron Age up until the second century CE, when the Romans destroyed it during the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nSpearheads, stone balls, vessels, two cisterns, and coins from both the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt were found in Battir in 1907 when three local families who owned the land near the ruin began cleaning the stones. The Warren Cup is also said to have been found near Battir.\nAccording to one Jewish tradition, it is also the site of the tomb of the Tannaic sage Eleazar of Modi'im.\n\nByzantine period\nA mosaic from the late Byzantine or early Islamic period was found in Battir.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596, Battir appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the Nahiya of Quds in the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all Muslims, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 Akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.\nIn 1838 it was noted as Bittir, a Muslim village in the Beni Hasan district, west of Jerusalem.\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin visited the place in 1863, while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count only included men. It was further noted that it had \"a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the mosque\".\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.\nIn 1896 the population of Bettir was estimated to be about 750 persons.\n\nIn the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the railroad to Jerusalem, which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons, increasing in the 1931 census to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims, with a total of 8,028 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,805 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 2,287 for cereals, while 73 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian period\nDuring the 1948 war, most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking. The armistice line was drawn between the railroad and the main part of the village, with Battir ending up just meters from Jordan's border with Israel on the Jordanian side. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, as well as a few of its buildings, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway, thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the Six-Day War. The parts of Battir falling on the Israeli side of the Green Line are officially within the territorial jurisdiction of the Mateh Yehuda Regional Council but do not have a local committee of their own and the council's authority is not exercised there.\nBattir came under Jordanian administration following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.\n\nPost-1967\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, the status of Battir changed from Jordanian rule on to Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 1445.\nSince the signing of the Oslo II Accord in 1995, Battir has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). It is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of the village's lands were classified as Area B, while the remaining 76.3% were classified as Area C.\nIn 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967, in 2012 the population was estimated at 4,500. In 2024, Israel approved a new settlement on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which Peace Now denounced as a threat to Battir's \"ancient terraces and sophisticated irrigation systems, evidence of thousands of years of human activity\".\n\nGeography\nBattir is located 6.4 kilometres (4.0 mi) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. \"Valley of the Soldier\"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain.\nThe village's historical core is characterized by its dense structure, surrounded by agricultural terraces. A newer section of Battir extends along the main way to Bethlehem. Ein al-Balad, the village's spring, is encased in a spring house.\nThe PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge. At an elevation of around 760 metres (2,490 ft) above sea level, Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16o C.\n\nAncient irrigation system and terraces\nBattir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces (habbai'l) and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates. The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years. The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era Hejaz Railway was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir \"a week lasts eight days, not seven.\" According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of UNESCO, \"There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village.\"\n\nIn 2007, the village of Battir sued the Israeli Defense Ministry to try to force them to change the planned route of the Israeli West Bank barrier which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), which approved the fence's original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir's terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded, stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence. This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain “why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.” The Defense Ministry had to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013. A separate petition against the separation barrier was also filed by the nearby Jewish city Beitar Illit, fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement.\n\nIn 2011 UNESCO awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for \"Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes\" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system.\nIn May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in Paris to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its World Heritage List. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to \"maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage,\" making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems. the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late. In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted \"The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape.\" The area was designated a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine in 2014.\nIn January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the IDF request to build the separation barrier through the village\n\nCulture and cuisine\nBattir is renowned for its distinctive local eggplant variety, known as the Battiri eggplant or \"Bitinjan Battiri\" to Palestinians. This elongated eggplant features a light purple hue and seedless, soft white flesh, and is a key ingredient in Palestinian dishes such as Maqluba. Battir is also known for its khyar abyad, a white cucumber grown in the village and in nearby Wadi Fukin.\nEvery summer, Battir hosts the Eggplant Festival, an event dedicated to supporting local producers and farmers, and celebrating the cultivation of the renowned Battiri eggplants.\n\nDemography\nAmong the residents of Battir village are members of the Abu 'Ebeid Allah, Abu Ni'ma, Batma, Batha, Kttoush, Mashni, Mu'ammar, and 'Uweina families.\n\nArchaeology\nAn old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village.\nArchaeologist D. Ussishkin dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road. A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion, which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during Emperor Hadrian's reign.\nThere isn't any evidence of habitation in the period immediately after the Revolt.\n\nSister cities\nLuton, United Kingdom\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome To Battir\nBattir, Welcome to Palestine\nBattir Village (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nBattir Village Profile, ARIJ\nBattir Village Area Photo, ARIJ\nBattir Video",

Within its area is an archaeological site containing the remains of Beitar, an ancient Jewish village and the last stronghold of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. The village is particularly known for its ancient terraces and an irrigation system that dates back to the Roman period. Due to this, In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the List of World Heritage Sites as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, under the name Battir – Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem.\nBattir was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel.

          "content": "Battir (en arabe بتير) est un village de Cisjordanie, dans les territoires palestiniens occupés, bâti sur le site de l'ancienne Betar. Le village est situé à 5 km à l'ouest de Bethléem et au sud-ouest de Jérusalem.\nLe site est occupé depuis l'âge du fer et c'est le lieu de la dernière bataille de la révolte de Bar Kokhba en 135. Le site est habité durant les périodes byzantines et ottomanes, et à l'époque du mandat britannique les habitants en sont enregistrés comme des musulmans.\nBattir est situé à proximité de la ligne de chemin de fer de Jaffa à Jérusalem, qui a servi de ligne d'armistice entre Israël et la Jordanie de 1949 jusqu'à la guerre des Six Jours, à l'issue de laquelle il a été occupé par Israël.\nBattir possède une population d'environ 4 000 personnes et dépend désormais de l'Autorité palestinienne. Les terrasses cultivées et le réseau d'irrigation sont classés au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO depuis 2014.\n\nHistoire\nPréhistoire\nL'archéologue David Ussishkin date la naissance du village à l'âge du fer.\n\nAntiquité\nÀ l'Antiquité, le village est nommé Betar (ou Beiter). Le village actuel est bâti sur l'ancien site de Khirbet el-Yahud ( « ruines des Juifs » en arabe ). Un système d'irrigation sophistiqué avait été installé à l'intérieur de fortifications. La perte de la ville de Betar, marque la fin de la révolte juive et Bar Kokhba y trouve la mort. À l'époque, le village contient entre mille et deux mille personnes. Le village possède encore des ruines d'un bain romain.\nAprès la révolte il n'y a pas de preuve d'une occupation du site.\n\nMoyen Âge\nUne mosaïque datée de la période byzantine tardive ou du début de l'époque musulmane y a été trouvée.\n\nÉpoque moderne et contemporaine\nLe bourg est l’un des vergers de Jérusalem. Grâce du chemin de fer construit par les Ottomans à la fin du XIXe siècle, le village exporte ses produits agricoles jusqu’à Jaffa.Pendant la guerre de 1948, le village passe un accord avec Israël pour exploiter des terres de l’autre côté de la ligne de cessez-le-feu, dite « verte », tracée en 1949 entre les forces israéliennes et jordaniennes. En échange, les habitants ne doivent pas porter atteinte à la voie de communication.\n\nSous occupation israélienne depuis 1967\nEn 2007, pour essayer de forcer le ministère israélien de la Défense à changer le tracé de la barrière de séparation qui doit couper à travers le système d'irrigation, le village de Battir l'assigne en justice. La direction de la Nature et des Parcs israélienne, qui avait donné son accord sur le tracé en 2005, change son avis et publie un document de 13 pages disant que les terrasses de Battir forment un site historique israélien et doivent être préservées. Ce document affirme que les techniques agricoles millénaires de la région seront endommagées de manière irréversible par la construction de la barrière, quelle que soit la largeur de son emprise sur le terrain. C'est la première fois qu'une agence gouvernementale israélienne exprime son opposition à la construction de la barrière de séparation. En mai 2013, la haute cour de justice israélienne statue en demandant au ministère de la Défense d'expliquer pour quelles raisons le tracé de la barrière de séparation autour du village de Battir ne peut pas être annulé ou modifié, ou alors pourquoi la barrière ne peut pas être reconfigurée (« why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured »). Le ministère de la Défense doit produire un nouveau plan avant le 2 juillet 2013. La colonie israélienne de Betar Illit, voisine du village, a elle aussi fait recours contre la barrière de séparation, craignant d'être empêchée d'agrandir l'implantation.\nAfin d'empêcher toute destruction de son système d'irrigation lors de la construction de la barrière de séparation, la Palestine dépose une demande auprès de l'UNESCO pour classer Battir au patrimoine mondial . En 2014, les terrasses cultivées et le réseau de canaux d’irrigation alimenté par des sources souterraines sont classés au patrimoine mondial et inscrites sur la liste du patrimoine mondial en péril. L'année suivante, la Cour suprême israélienne gèle le tracé du mur de séparation.\nLe 7 août 2024, Bezalel Smotrich, ministre israélien des finances et figure de l’extrême-droite suprémaciste, annonce vouloir « engager les procédures d’établissement » d'une nouvelle colonie, aux portes du village antique de Battir. Ce projet, baptisé Nahal Haletz, vise à relier la ville de Jérusalem au groupes de colonies du Goush Etzion, et couvre près de la moitié de la « zone centrale » du site classé par l’UNESCO, organisation dont Israël s'est retiré en 2017.\n\nSystème d'irrigation\nBattir possède un système d'irrigation unique qui utilise des terrasses artificielles et un système destiné à détourner manuellement de l'eau. Ce réseau datant de l'époque romaine est relié à sept sources qui ont alimenté le village et les champs en eau pendant 2 000 ans.\n\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nSource\n(en) Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé « Battir » (voir la liste des auteurs).\n\nArticles connexes\nHistoire de la Palestine\nBetar Illit, colonie israélienne à proximité des ruines de Betar\nEnclaves palestiniennes\nMur de séparation\n\nLiens externes\n« L'urgence d'inscrire le village Battir, en Palestine, candidat au Patrimoine mondial de l'Humanité » , sur franceinter.fr, 15 janvier 2013 (consulté le 2 septembre 2020)\n« Battir, la civilisation romaine au cœur de la Palestine - Le Philistin », sur Le Philistin, 13 février 2013 (consulté le 2 septembre 2020)\n(en) Harriet Sherwood, « Israeli separation wall threatens Battir's ancient terraces » , sur guardian.co.uk, The Guardian, 11 décembre 2012 (consulté le 2 septembre 2020)\nEmilie Baujard, « Reportage international - Battir, un village palestinien bientôt inscrit au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité », sur rfi.fr, 14 janvier 2013 (consulté le 2 septembre 2020)\n(en) Isabel Kershner, « Palestinian Village Tries to Protect Landmark », The New York Times,‎ 25 juin 2012 (lire en ligne , consulté le 2 septembre 2020)\n\n Portail de la Palestine   Portail d’Israël   Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail de l’archéologie",

Elle est dans une zone sous administration civile de l'Autorité palestinienne.\nLa ville a la particularité d'être encore une localité entièrement chrétienne depuis les premiers temps de l'Église. Elle est considérée comme étant le lieu biblique de la tribu des Benjamin et celui d'Éphraïm dans le Nouveau Testament et aurait changé son nom en Taybeh (ce qui signifie délicieux) au XIIe siècle. Taybeh fait partie du gouvernorat de Ramallah.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nSelon l'Évangile de saint Jean, Jésus-Christ se serait retiré ici quelque temps avec ses disciples, après la résurrection de Lazare, car les Pharisiens avaient l'intention de le tuer. Le Christ ne serait plus paru en public et aurait demeuré à Éphraïm, avant de se rendre dans le désert à huit kilomètres sur une colline, afin de prier et jeûner pendant quarante jours.\n\nL'impératrice Hélène (mère de Constantin) est venue ici avec un grand campement pendant son pèlerinage en Terre sainte, ordonnant l'édification d'une église sur la colline de Saint-Gédéon[réf. nécessaire]. Une église dédiée à saint Georges est construite au Ve siècle, dont on peut encore admirer les vestiges et qui fait toujours l'objet de fouilles[réf. nécessaire].\n\nMoyen-âge\nUne autre église est construite par les croisés du royaume de Jérusalem et en 1185 Baudouin IV de Jérusalem donne le fort de Saint-Élie, qui se trouve sur une colline au-dessus du village, à Boniface de Montferrat[réf. nécessaire].\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nLe village a été victime d'un pogrom en 2005, lorsqu'une employée musulmane de 23 ans habitant le village voisin de Deir Jarir et travaillant à Taybeh dans l'atelier de couture d'un chrétien est tombée enceinte. Elle est retrouvée morte empoisonnée le 31 août 2005. Il est établi plus tard qu'elle a été empoisonnée par des membres de sa famille pour accomplir un « crime d'honneur ». En attendant les villageois de Deir Jarir accusent ceux de Taybeh et se répandent pendant deux jours à Taybeh brûlant les maisons des membres de la famille de l'employeur, sans que la police israélienne n'intervienne, tandis que la police palestinienne est retardée par le passage de plusieurs check-points, malgré la demande du consul américain aux autorités israéliennes de leur faciliter le passage. La situation s'apaise grâce à l'intervention des autorités religieuses chrétiennes locales et les conseils des anciens des deux localités[réf. nécessaire].\nFin juin 2025, les habitants du village sont harcelés par des colons israéliens, qui allument des incendies, dont un contre une église datant du Ve siècle. De même, trois civils palestiniens sont tués par l'armée israélienne.\n\nPopulation et société\nDémographie\nLe recensement de 1931 à l'époque de la Palestine mandataire donne une population de 1 038 chrétiens et 87 musulmans[réf. nécessaire].\nTaybeh avait une population avoisinant 4 000 habitants en 1967, mais depuis l'occupation par l'armée israélienne, les conditions économiques se sont dégradées et la population est tombée à 2 000 habitants, la main-d'œuvre devant s'employer ailleurs. Des colonies juives se sont installées aux abords, comme celles de Ma'ale Efraim, Ofra, Rimmounim et Ammon (depuis 2003), provoquant la confiscation de terres et l'interdiction de circuler sur certaines routes pour les Palestiniens[réf. nécessaire].\n\nEnseignement\nTaybeh possède deux écoles principales primaires et secondaires, l'une dépendant du patriarcat orthodoxe de Jérusalem, l'autre d'une congrégation catholique. Elles scolarisent en tout près de 700 élèves[réf. nécessaire].\nUn atelier-école de tailleurs-sculpteurs de pierre s'est formé à l'initiative d'une association française.\n\nÉconomie\nActivité industrielle et agricole\nL'endroit était essentiellement agricole, jusqu'à une vingtaine d'années et son économie était concentrée autour de la culture de l'olivier, du figuier et de l'abricotier, ainsi que de la vigne. On y fabrique aussi des fromages réputés[réf. nécessaire]. Taybeh est connu de même comme le seul lieu en Palestine possédant une brasserie. La bière de Taybeh est appréciée par la population locale, avec une variété sans alcool pour la clientèle musulmane. La Brasserie Taybeh (Taybeh Brewery) a été fondée fin 1993 par la famille Khoury. Une Oktoberfest se tient tous les ans à Taybeh, ce qui attire les touristes amateurs de bière[réf. nécessaire].\n\nCulture locale et patrimoine\nLieux et monuments\nÉglises de Taybeh\nÉglise Saint-Georges (melkite), 1964\nÉglise Saint-Georges el-Khader, Ve siècle\nÉglise Saint-Georges (orthodoxe), reconstruite en 1929-1932\nÉglise du Saint-Sauveur (catholique de rite latin), 1971\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nCharles de Foucauld\nCharles de Foucauld, béatifié en 2005, a visité Taybeh en janvier 1889 pendant son premier pèlerinage en Terre sainte. Il y est retourné en 1898 et cela l'a mené à écrire Huit jours à Ephrem, retraite de 1898, du lundi après le IVe dimanche de Carême au lundi après le Ve dimanche de Carême (soit du 14 au 21 mars 1898). Sa retraite à Taybeh/Ephrem, notamment auprès des ruines de l'église Saint-Georges, a inspiré quarante-cinq pages de ses Écrits spirituels[réf. nécessaire].\nLe Centre de pèlerinage Charles-de-Foucauld, hôtellerie pour pèlerins, a ouvert à Taybeh en 1986, à l'initiative des chevaliers de l'ordre équestre du Saint-Sépulcre de Jérusalem.\n\nGalerie\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nPierre Medebielle, scj, Ephrem-Taybeh et son histoire chrétienne, Jérusalem, Imprimerie du patriarcat latin, 1993\n\nArticles connexes\nCisjordanie\nTerritoires palestiniens occupés\nViolences des colons israéliens\n\nLiens externes\nSite officiel\n\nNotes et références\n\n Portail de la Palestine   Portail des chrétiens d’Orient",

Une fresque commémorant ce fait local est visible à l'entrée du bourg.\n\nGéographie\nSituation et description\nSituée dans la partie septentrionale du département de l'Isère et dans l'arrondissement de Vienne, dans la région naturelle des Terres froides, le territoire de la commune se positionne entre les agglomérations de Bourgoin-Jallieu et de l'ancienne ville nouvelle de L'Isle-d'Abeau, au nord et de Saint-Jean-de-Bournay, au sud et fit longtemps partie du canton organisé autour de cette dernière commune. Elle est depuis 2014, rattachée au canton de La Verpillière.\n\nGéologie et relief\nLa zone des collines doucement ondulées du secteur d'Artas et de Saint-Jean-de-Bournay se développe au sud de la plaine lyonnaise et elle est caractérisée par un recouvrement général de moraines dessinant des vallums morainiques et par une série de vallées mortes fluvio-glaciaire.\nLe glacier du Rhône avait envahi tout le secteur de l'actuel Bas-Dauphiné à la fin du Pléistocène jusqu'à la région saint-jeannaise à laquelle appartient Artas. La marge latérale occidentale de ce glacier coïncide avec la limite nord du plateau de Bonnevaux, façonnée par l'érosion fluvio-glaciaire des torrents qui longeaient ce gigantesque glacier et dont on retrouve les traces sous forme de terrasses alluviales et de traces d'écoulement. On retrouve sur le territoire une accumulation de roches, vestige de la période glaciaire.\n\nParticularité géologique\nLa « Pierre du diable » est un volumineux bloc erratique morainique déposé par le glacier du Rhône qui recouvrait cette partie du Dauphiné durant l'ère quaternaire (entre - 30 000 et - 14 000 ans).\n\nCommunes limitrophes\nLa commune est riveraine de huit autres communes du département de l'Isère.\n\nHydrographie\nLa commune ne possède pas de cours d'eau notable, excepté le ruisseau de Charavoux, d'une longueur de 6,2 km, lequel prend sa source dans le hameau de Révolet avant de rejoindre le territoire voisin de la commune de Charentonnay.\n\nClimat\nPlusieurs études ont été menées afin de caractériser les types climatiques auxquels est exposé le territoire national. Les zonages obtenus diffèrent selon les méthodes utilisées, la nature et le nombre des paramètres pris en compte, le maillage territorial des données et la période de référence. En 2010, le climat de la commune était ainsi de type climat des marges montargnardes, selon une étude du Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) s'appuyant sur une méthode combinant données climatiques et facteurs de milieu (topographie, occupation des sols, etc.) et des données couvrant la période 1971-2000. En 2020, le climat prédominant est classé Cfa, selon la classification de Köppen-Geiger, pour la période 1988-2017, à savoir un climat tempéré à été chaud sans saison sèche. Par ailleurs Météo-France publie en 2020 une nouvelle typologie des climats de la France métropolitaine dans laquelle la commune est exposée à un climat de montagne ou de marges de montagne et est dans la région climatique  Moyenne vallée du Rhône, caractérisée par un bon ensoleillement en été (fraction d’insolation > 60 %), une forte amplitude thermique annuelle (4 à 20 °C), un air sec en toutes saisons, orageux en été, des vents forts (mistral), une pluviométrie élevée en automne (250 à 300 mm). Elle est en outre dans la zone H1c au titre de la réglementation environnementale 2020 des constructions neuves.\nPour la période 1971-2000, la température annuelle moyenne est de 10,6 °C, avec une amplitude thermique annuelle de 17,6 °C. Le cumul annuel moyen de précipitations est de 1 008 mm, avec 9,8 jours de précipitations en janvier et 6,4 jours en juillet. Pour la période 1991-2020, la température moyenne annuelle observée sur la station météorologique de Météo-France la plus proche, sur la commune de Bourgoin-Jallieu à 11 km à vol d'oiseau, est de 12,4 °C et le cumul annuel moyen de précipitations est de 844,0 mm. \nLa température maximale relevée sur cette station est de 40 °C, atteinte le 12 août 2025 ; la température minimale est de −14,2 °C, atteinte le 5 février 2012.\n\nVoies de communication\nLe territoire communal est situé en dehors des axes de grande circulation. Le bourg est cependant traversé par deux routes secondaires qui se traversent en son centre :\n\nla RD53 qui relie la commune de Valencin (par Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche) à celle de Saint-Agnin-sur-Bion ;\nla RD126 qui relie la commune de La Verpillière à Saint-Jean-de-Bournay.\n\nTransports publics\nAutocars\nLe réseau interurbain de l'Isère, plus connu sous l'appellation Transisère, permet de relier le village d'Artas à d'autres villes de l'Isère, grâce à la ligne de proximité 2080 qui relie Valencin ↔ Artas ↔ Bourgoin-Jallieu.\n\nTrains\nLa  gare ferroviaire la plus proche de la commune est la gare de Bourgoin-Jallieu, desservie par des trains TER Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.\n\nUrbanisme\nTypologie\nAu 1er janvier 2024, Artas est catégorisée commune rurale à habitat dispersé, selon la nouvelle grille communale de densité à sept niveaux définie par l'Insee en 2022.\nElle est située hors unité urbaine. Par ailleurs la commune fait partie de l'aire d'attraction de Lyon, dont elle est une commune de la couronne. Cette aire, qui regroupe 397 communes, est catégorisée dans les aires de 700 000 habitants ou plus (hors Paris).\n\nOccupation des sols\nL'occupation des sols de la commune, telle qu'elle ressort de la base de données européenne d’occupation biophysique des sols Corine Land Cover (CLC), est marquée par l'importance des territoires agricoles (76,2 % en 2018), une proportion sensiblement équivalente à celle de 1990 (77 %). La répartition détaillée en 2018 est la suivante : \nterres arables (45,2 %), zones agricoles hétérogènes (22,2 %), forêts (13,6 %), prairies (8,8 %), zones urbanisées (7,3 %), mines, décharges et chantiers (2,9 %). L'évolution de l’occupation des sols de la commune et de ses infrastructures peut être observée sur les différentes représentations cartographiques du territoire : la carte de Cassini (XVIIIe siècle), la carte d'état-major (1820-1866) et les cartes ou photos aériennes de l'IGN pour la période actuelle (1950 à aujourd'hui).\n\nMorphologie urbaine\nHameaux lieux-dits et écarts\nVoici, ci-dessous, la liste la plus complète possible des divers hameaux, quartiers et lieux-dits résidentiels urbains comme ruraux qui composent le territoire de la commune d'Artas, présentés selon les références toponymiques fournies par le site géoportail de l'Institut géographique national.\n\nRisques naturels et technologiques\nRisques sismiques\nL'ensemble du territoire de la commune d'Artas est situé en zone de sismicité n°3 (sur une échelle de 1 à 5), comme la plupart des communes de son secteur géographique.\n\nAutres risques\nToponymie\nSelon André Planck, auteur d'un livre sur la toponymie des communes de l'Isère, le nom du village dériverait du gaulois Artos désignant également l'ours, animal reconnu pour sa force et son prestige, très apprécié avant l'implantation du christianisme.\nMercurius Artaios, une assimilation du dieu Mercure avec le dieu celte Artaios, un dieu ours vénéré autrefois à Beaucroissant, cité assez proche d'Artas est également évoquée.\nL'influence du grec ancien avec le terme artos (du grec ancien : Ἄρτος, signifiant « pain levé ») a également été suggéré par F. Crozet, dans son ouvrage édité en 1870.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nLe territoire de la commune était déjà occupé durant la période antique.\nDurant cette période, le territoire des Allobroges s'étendait sur la plus grande partie des pays qui seront nommés plus tard la Sapaudia (ce « pays des sapins » deviendra la Savoie) et au nord de l'Isère.\nLes Allobroges, comme bien d'autres peuples gaulois, sont une « confédération ». En fait, les Romains donnèrent, par commodité le nom d'Allobroges à l'ensemble des peuples gaulois vivant dans la civitate (cité) de Vienne, à l'ouest et au sud de la Sapaudia.\nAu cœur d'un secteur forestier, au lieu-dit Mollard du Puits, il existe des traces d’une voie romaine d'environ cinq mètres de large. La même voie se retrouverait  un peu plus loin au lieu-dit Cancarot et des tombes gallo-romaines auraient été exhumées au lieu-dit du Mas de la Vergne.\n\nMoyen Âge\nDurant l'époque médiévale, il existait un prieuré, rattaché à l'ordre de Cluny. La famille Vignon de Tarnésieu y possédait un château, aujourd'hui disparu.\n\nTemps Modernes\nSous le règne de Louis XIV, les chênes de la forêt d'Artas sont renommés et fournissaient en grande partie des bois nécessaires pour construire les galères du Roi à Marseille.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nArtas revendique être le berceau de la fête des mères, en France, organisée pour la première fois en 1906. Une fresque murale a été créée en contrebas de l'entrée du bourg ancien afin de témoigner de cet événement.\nOrganisée par l'« Union des pères de famille méritants », créée par le maire de la commune sous l'initiative de l'instituteur Prosper Roche, son but était de promouvoir l'accroissement de la population en « honorant » les familles nombreuses. L'homme politique et ancien ministre, François Baroin évoque cette création dans son livre dénommé « Une histoire de France par les villes et les villages ».\n\nPolitique et administration\nAdministration municipale\nLe conseil municipal d'Artas est composé de dix-neuf conseillers municipaux (neuf femmes et dix hommes) dont un maire, trois adjoints municipaux, quatre conseillers délégués et onze conseillers municipaux.\nLe maire de la commune est également le premier vice-président de la communauté de communes Bièvre Isère chargé du développement économique, de l'aménagement numérique et de l'agriculture.\n\nTendances politiques et résultats\nScrutins locaux\nScrutins nationaux\nLors de l'élection présidentielle de 2017, la candidate du Front national fut, au niveau local, placée en tête des deux tours de scrutin par les électeurs de la commune qui se sont (en moyenne) déplacés vers les urnes de façon plus importante que les autres électeurs français.\n\nListe des maires\nÉconomie\nActivités industrielle et commerciale\nL'économie de la commune est liée à des commerces et des services de proximité, mais aussi une zone artisanale. Celle-ci, dénommée « Zone d'activités de Chaplanière », appartient au domaine des zones industrielles et parcs d'activités de la région Saint-Jeannaise.\n\nActivité agricole\nSelon le site de la mairie, « Artas a conservé un caractère rural ». L'activité agricole est encore très marquée sur son territoire et la mairie dénombre encore dix-neuf exploitations dont huit ont leur siège sur la commune. La surface agricole utile (SAU) revendiquée est de 877 hectares.\n\nPopulation et société\nDémographie\nSes habitants sont nommés les Artasiens\nL'évolution du nombre d'habitants est connue à travers les recensements de la population effectués dans la commune depuis 1793. Pour les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants, une enquête de recensement portant sur toute la population est réalisée tous les cinq ans, les populations de référence des années intermédiaires étant quant à elles estimées par interpolation ou extrapolation. Pour la commune, le premier recensement exhaustif entrant dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif a été réalisé en 2008.\n\nEn 2022, la commune comptait 1 815 habitants, en évolution de +0,11 % par rapport à 2016 (Isère : +3,07 %, France hors Mayotte : +2,11 %).\n\nEnseignement\nLa commune est située dans l'académie de Grenoble. L'école élémentaire, qui compte plusieurs sections de primaire et des classes de maternelle, est située au centre du village. L'établissement présente un effectif de 221 élèves lors la rentrée scolaire de 2023.\n\nÉquipement sportifs et culturels\nAnimation culturelle\nLa « journée des fours » ou « matinée des fours », généralement organisée à la fin du mois d'avril est une fête locale.\n\nMédias\nPresse écrite\nHistoriquement, le quotidien à grand tirage Le Dauphiné libéré consacre, chaque jour, y compris le dimanche, dans son édition du Nord-Isère, un ou plusieurs articles à l'actualité du canton et quelquefois de la commune, ainsi que des informations sur les éventuelles manifestations locales, les travaux routiers, et autres événements divers à caractère local.\n\nPresse audiovisuelle\nLa station de radio publique généraliste Ici Isère est diffusée dans la commune et sur tout le territoire du département de l'Isère.\n\nCultes\nCulte catholique\nLa communauté catholique et l'église d'Artas (propriété de la commune) sont rattachées à la paroisse Saint Hugues de Bonnevaux (relais Saint-Jean) qui est, elle-même, rattachée au diocèse de Grenoble-Vienne.\n\nAutres cultes\nCulture locale et patrimoine\nLieux et monuments\nL'église Saint-Pierre à deux clochers des XIIe et XIXe siècles.\nL'ancien clocher roman de style lombard est le dernier vestige de l'église prieurale qui fut édifiée durant le Moyen Âge. En 1835, le cloître fut démoli. Une partie fut conservée pour y installer la mairie et l'école. Ce dernier bâtiment considéré comme trop vétuste fut, à son tour rasé, en 1900, afin d'y construire une école de filles.\n\nLa fresque du jardin dédiée à la Fête des Mères.\nLe village d'Artas revendique être le « berceau de la fête des Mères ». En effet, le 10 juin 1906, à l'initiative de Prosper Roche, fondateur de l'Union fraternelle des pères de famille méritants d'Artas, une cérémonie en l'honneur de mères de familles nombreuses eut lieu. Deux mères de neuf enfants reçurent, ce jour-là, un prix de « Haut mérite maternel ». Le diplôme original créé par Prosper Roche est conservé dans la bibliothèque de l'Institut de France avec les archives de l'association.\n\nLa « Pierre du Diable ».\nIl s'agit d'un bloc erratique d'origine morainique déplacé par le glacier du Rhône durant les grandes glaciations. Le rocher, dénommé ainsi en raison d'une légende locale, est situé en pleine forêt. Celle-ci a fait l'objet d'un roman de l'écrivaine Nicole Provence, dénommé La Pierre du diable, édité chez Flammarion.\n\nLe monument aux morts.\nCelui-ci est situé au centre du bourg à proximité immédiate du porche de l'église.\n\nL'ancienne mairie.\nConsidérée comme trop étroite pour accueillir l'ensemble des services municipaux, celle-ci, rénovée récemment, est toujours présente au centre du village.\n\nPatrimoine culturel\nLa Grange Chevrotière\nCette ancienne grange-étable est un lieu consacré à la fois à l'art et au patrimoine local. Le site accueille des expositions et des spectacles.\n\nPatrimoine naturel\nL'étang de Charavoux\nLa ZNIEFF de l'étang de Charavoux s'étend uniquement sur le territoire de la commune d'Artas. Sa superficie est de 17,04 hectares. Le plan d'eau est alimenté par le ruisseau de Charavoux et présente un paysage typique des milieux humides avec des bois, des prairies, des roselières.\nCe site naturel accueille ainsi diverses espèces dont certaines présentent un intérêt scientifique et naturaliste. On peut y observer des oiseaux tels que la Bouscarle de Cetti, la Rousserolle turdoïde et le Héron pourpré.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nProsper Roche :\ninstituteur du village au début du XXe siècle, initiateur d'une fête des mères locales considérée comme un des créateurs de cette célébration en France.\n\nHéraldique\nNotes et références\nNotes\nCartes\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nLa Pierre du diable (roman) de  Nicole Provence, 308 pages, ed.

          "content": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\nDefinition\nThe \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" translates into \"the Farthest Mosque\" in English.\n\nThe Arabic term \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" is the translation of both al-Masjid al-Aqṣā and Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā, which have distinct meanings in Arabic. The former (al-Masjid al-Aqṣā) refers to the Quran's Surah 17 – \"the furthest mosque\" – and thus is used for the whole compound of the Temple Mount, also known as the Haram al-Sharif, while the latter name (Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā) is used for the subject of this article – the silver-domed congregational mosque building. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th-century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif ('Noble Sanctuary') – i.e. the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written. Al-Muqaddasi referred to the southern building (the subject of this article) as Al Mughattâ (\"the covered-part\") and Nasir Khusraw referred to it with the Persian word Pushish (also the \"covered part\", exactly as \"Al Mughatta\") or the Maqsurah (a part-for-the-whole synecdoche).\nThe building is also referred to as (al-)Qibli Mosque or (al-)Qibli Chapel (Muṣallā al-Qiblī), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. \"Qibli\" is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), and the Jordanian government more widely. It is also the official name used by the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has been used by numerous international organizations such as the United States State Department the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (whose role is to act as \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\"), and UNESCO, as well as various scholars and media organizations.\n\nHistory\nPre-construction\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\nIt was once thought that Emperor Justinian's \"Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos\", lit. 'the New Church of the God-Bearer' and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in 543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.\nAnalysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as the 9th century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However, reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount's southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton's excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn't include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682. Its precise location is not known. The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock. The architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate. Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem. The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar Ibn Tahir claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram.\nThere is disagreement as to whether the present al-Aqsa Mosque was originally built by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor, his son al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. Abd al-Malik inaugurated great architectural works on the Temple Mount, including construction of the Dome of the Rock in c. 691. A common Islamic tradition holds that Abd al-Malik simultaneously commissioned the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque. As both were intentionally built on the same axis, Grabar comments that the two structures form \"part of an architecturally thought-out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building\", the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, respectively. Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.\nThe earliest source indicating al-Walid's work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papryi. These contain the letters between al-Walid's governor of Egypt in December 708–June 711 and a government official in Upper Egypt which discuss the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the \"Mosque of Jerusalem\". The referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction. Several 10th and 13th-century historians credit al-Walid for founding the mosque, though the historian Amikam Elad doubts their reliability on the matter. In 713–714, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt by al-Walid's order. He had gold from the Dome of the Rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations. He is credited by the early 15th-century historian al-Qalqashandi for covering the mosque's walls with mosaics. Grabar notes that the Umayyad-era mosque was adorned with mosaics, marble, and \"remarkable crafted and painted woodwork\". The latter are preserved partly in the Palestine Archaeological Museum and partly in the Islamic Museum.\nEstimates of the size of the Umayyad-built mosque by architectural historians range from 112 by 39 meters (367 ft × 128 ft) to 114.6 by 69.2 meters (376 ft × 227 ft). The building was rectangular. In the assessment of Grabar, the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period. Its \"unusual\" characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the qibla wall. The number of aisles is not definitively known, though fifteen is cited by a number of historians. The central aisle, double the width of the others, was probably topped by a dome.\nThe last years of Umayyad rule were turbulent for Jerusalem. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II (r. 744–750), punished Jerusalem's inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes, and tore down the city's walls. In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was ruined in an earthquake. Four years later, the Umayyads were toppled and replaced by the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\". Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque. According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration. In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction.\nA second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, except for the southern portion near the mihrab (prayer niche indicating the qibla). In 780, his successor, al-Mahdi, ordered its reconstruction, mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade. Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985, provided the following description:\n\nThis mosque is even more beautiful than that of Damascus ... the edifice [after al-Mahdi's reconstruction] rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times. The more ancient portion remained, even like a beauty spot, in the midst of the new ... the Aqsa mosque has twenty-six doors ... The centre of the Main-building is covered by a mighty roof, high pitched and gable-wise, over which rises a magnificent dome.\nAl-Muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the qibla and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the Abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates. According to Hamilton, al-Muqaddasi's description of the Abbasid-era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in 1938–1942, which showed the Abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome. The mosque described by al-Muqaddasi opened to the north, toward the Dome of the Rock, and, unusually according to Grabar, to the east.\nOther than al-Mansur and al-Mahdi, no other Abbasid caliphs visited Jerusalem or commissioned work on the al-Aqsa Mosque, though Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) ordered significant work elsewhere on the Haram. He also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque's interior, and the geographer Nasir Khusraw noted during his 1047 visit that al-Ma'mun's name was inscribed on it. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the Abbasid governor of the eastern province of Khurasan (r. 828–844), is credited by al-Muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque's front (north) side.\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids. Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form. In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque. The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094).\nThe new mosque was considerably smaller, reduced from fifteen aisles to seven, probably a reflection of the local population's significant decline by this time. Excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave, each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the qibla. The central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome. The mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor.\nA prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome, the pendentives leading to the dome, and the arch in front of the mihrab. These three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the \"triumphal arch\" by Grabar or the \"maqsura\" by Pruitt. Mosaic designs were rare in Islamic architecture in the post-Umayyad era and al-Zahir's mosaics were a revival of this Umayyad architectural practice, including Abd al-Malik's mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, but on a larger scale. The drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the Umayyad or Classical style. The four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock's eyes, eight-pointed stars, and palm fronds. On the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases.\n\nAtop the mihrab arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al-Aqsa Mosque with Muhammad's Night Journey (the isra and mi'raj) from the \"masjid al-haram\" to the \"masjid al-aqsa\". It marked the first instance of this Quranic verse being inscribed in Jerusalem, leading Grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the Fatimids to magnify the site's sacred character. The inscription credits al-Zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures, Abu al-Wasim and a sharif, al-Hasan al-Husayni, for supervising the work.\nNasir Khusraw described the mosque during his 1047 visit. He deemed it \"very large\", measuring 420 by 150 cubits on its western side. The distance between each \"sculptured\" marble column, 280 in number, was six cubits. The columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints. He noted the following features:\n\n ... the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble ... The Maksurah [or space railed off for the officials] is facing the centre of the south wall [of the Mosque and Haram Area], and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns. Above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work.\nAl-Zahir's substantial investment in the Haram, including the al-Aqsa Mosque, amid the political instability in the capital Cairo, rebellions by Bedouin tribes, especially the Jarrahids of Palestine, and plagues, indicate the caliph's \"commitment to Jerusalem\", in Pruitt's words. Although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades, the Fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque, and the Haram in general, for their own religious and political reasons. The present-day mosque largely retains al-Zahir's plan.\nFatimid investment in Jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the 11th century as their rule became further destabilized. In 1071, a Turkish mercenary, Atsiz, was invited by the city's Fatimid governor to rein in the Bedouin, but he turned on the Fatimids, besieging and capturing Jerusalem that year. A few years later, the inhabitants revolted against him, and were slaughtered by Atsiz, including those who had taken shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque. He was killed by the Turkish Seljuks in 1078, establishing Seljuk rule over the city, which lasted until the Fatimids regained control in 1098.\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.\nAfter the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187, several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense. Saladin's predecessor—the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din—had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or \"pulpit\" made of ivory and wood in 1168–69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din's minbar was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin. The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, al-Mu'azzam, built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the Mamluk sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque. They made architectural contributions elsewhere on the Haram, including building the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527) and three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538, and restoring the Pool of Raranj. These constructions were commissioned by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem, rather than the sultans, whose contributions were limited to additions to the existing minarets.\nIn 1816, the mosque was restored by Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, the Acre-based governor of Sidon, after having been in a dilapidated state.\nThe first renovation in the 20th century occurred in 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.\nSevere damage was caused by the 1837 and 1927 earthquakes. The damage from the 1927 earthquake and a small tremor in the summer of 1937 caused the roof of the mosque to collapse. Repairs were undertaken in 1938 and 1942. The upper part of the north wall of the mosque was reconstructed and the whole interior of the roofing was refaced. Other repairs included the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors, the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch, and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque. Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini donated Carrara marble columns in the late 1930s.\nOn 20 July 1951, King Abdullah I was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.\n\nThe site fell under Israeli control on 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War.\nOn 21 August 1969, a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan, an evangelical Christian who hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. In response to the incident, a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year, hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the then king of Saudi Arabia. The al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in 1972.\nFollowing the fire, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.\nIn the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque.\nOn 5 November 2014, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967, said Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib, director of the Islamic Waqf. Previous media reports of 'storming Al-Aqsa' referred to the Haram al-Sharif compound rather than the Al-Aqsa mosque itself.\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers. It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide. Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture.\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969. Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting.\nAl-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, most of which are of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.\nThe porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin's nephew al-Mu'azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924. The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period.\n\nThe mosque's interior is supported by 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.\nA great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.\nAfter its destruction by Rohan in 1969, it was replaced by a much simpler minbar. In January 2007, Adnan al-Husayni—head of the Islamic waqf in charge of al-Aqsa—stated that a new minbar would be installed; it was installed in February 2007. The design of the new minbar was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin Minbar and was finished by Badran within a period of five years. The minbar itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used \"ancient woodworking methods, joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails, but employed computer images to design the pulpit [minbar].\"\n\nCurrent situation\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government.\nThe Jerusalem Waqf is responsible for administrative matters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Religious authority on the site, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the government of the State of Palestine.\nAfter the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.\nOwnership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, other times they are over an extended period of time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.\nUntil 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Over two decades later, the Waqf still hopes negotiations between Israel and Jordan may result in allowing visitors to enter once again.\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south. The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984. According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.\nIn February 2007, the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the Mughrabi Gate, the only entrance for non-Muslims into the Temple Mount complex. This site was 60 meters (200 ft) away from the mosque. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world, and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. Ismail Haniyeh—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. Israel denied all charges against them, calling them \"ludicrous\".\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims. On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall. On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself. In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers.\nOn 15 April 2022, Israeli forces entered the Temple Mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse Palestinians who, they said, were throwing stones at policemen. Some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained by Israeli police. Over 150 people ended up injured and 400 arrested.\nOn April 5, 2023, Israeli police raided the temple, saying \"agitators\" who had thrown stones and fired fireworks at the police, had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside. Following the incident, militants fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.\nOn 22 April 2024 Israeli police arrested 13 for incitement to violence after they were caught in the act of smuggling goats onto the site for ritual sacrifice, 3 had been arrested in 2023 for trying to smuggle lambs and goats onto the site.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Israel\nList of mosques in Israel\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nIslam in the Palestinian territories\nAl-Juʽranah in Saudi Arabia, alternative location for Quranic \"al-Aqsa mosque\"\nPalestinian nationalism – Movement for self-determination and sovereignty of Palestine\nReligious significance of the Syrian region – Region east of the Mediterranean SeaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAllan, J.

          "summary": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.",

          "title": "المسجد الأقصى",
          "content": "ٱلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ أحد أكبر مساجد العالم وأحد المساجد الثلاثة التي يشد المسلمون الرحال إليها، كما قال نبي الإسلام محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ وهو أيضًا أول القبلتين في الإسلام. يقع داخل البلدة القديمة بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقة المحاطة بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الأقصى الواقع في أقصى الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية من البلدة القديمة المسورة.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابة 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تُسمى «هضبة موريا»، وتعد الصخرة أعلى نقطة فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الأقصى في القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود أيضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الأقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبة إلى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهودية التذرع بهذه الحجة لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.\n\nأصل التسمية\nللمسجد الأقصى عدة أسماء، أهمّها ثلاثة:\n\nالمسجد الأقصى: وكلمة «الأقصى» تعني الأبعد، وسُمِّيَ الأقصَى لبعد ما بينه وبين المسجد الحرام، وكان أبعد مسجد عن أهل مكة في الأرض يعظَّم بالزيارة. والذي سمّاه بهذا الاسم وفقًا للعقيدة الإسلامية الله في القرآن، وذلك في الآية: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1)، كُتبت فيه الألفُ الأخيرة ممدودةً الأقصا، وهو اسم تفضيل معناه الأبعد، ثم صار يُقصد به الوصف لا التفضيل، وفي الاسم إعلال إذ أصلها الأقصَي بالياء المنقوطة، ثم أصبحت الياء ألفاً لأن ما قبلها حرف الصاد مفتوح، وأصل ألف الأقصى واو أو ياء، إما قصِيَ يقصو، أو قصا يقصو.\nالبيت المُقَدَّس: وكلمة «المقدّس» تعني المبارك والمطهّر، وقد ذكر علماءُ المسلمين وشعراؤهم هذا الاسم كثيرًا، كما قال الإمام ابن حجر العسقلاني:\n\nبيت المَقْدِس: وهو الاسم الذي كان متعارفًا عليه قبل أن يُطلق عليه اسم «المسجد الأقصى» في القرآن الكريم، وهذا الاسم هو المستَخدَم في معظم أحاديث النبي محمد، مثل ما قاله يوم الإسراء والمعراج: «ثم دخلت أنا وجبريل عليه السلام بيت المقدس فصلى كل واحد منا ركعتين».\n\nاعتقادات خاطئة عن حدوده بسبب الاحتلال\nيعتقد الكثيرون أن المسجد الأقصى هو فقط المصلى المبني جنوبي قبة الصخرة (المصلى القبلي)، وهو الذي تقام فيه الصلوات الخمس الآن للرجال، وهذا الاعتقاد نتيجة محاولات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي الصهيوني السيطرة على أجزاء من الأقصى أو تدميره، والصحيح أن المسجد الأقصى هو اسم لجميع المسجد وهو كل ما هو داخل سور المسجد ويشمل الساحات الواسعة، والجامع القبلي وقبة الصخرة والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة والأروقة والقباب والمصاطب وأسبلة الماء والحدائق وتحت أرض المسجد وفوقه وغيرها من المعالم، وعلى أسواره المآذن، والمسجد كله غير مسقّف سوى بناء قبة الصخرة والمصلى القبلي الجامع والمصلى المرواني. وهذا ما اتفق عليه العلماء والمؤرخون، وعليه تكون مضاعفة ثواب الصلاة في أي جزء مما دار عليه السور، وتبلغ مساحته تقريباً 144000 متراً مربعاً.\n\nتاريخ المسجد الأقصى\nأول بنائه\nلا يُعرف بدقة متى بُني المسجد الأقصى لأول مرة، ولكن ورد في أحاديث النبي محمد بأن بناءه كان بعد بناء الكعبة بأربعين عامًا، فعن أبي ذر أنه قال: «قلت: يا رسول الله! أي مسجد وضع في الأرض أول؟ قال: المسجد الحرام. قلت: ثم أي؟ قال: المسجد الأقصى. قلت: كم بينهما؟ قال: أربعون سنة». وقد اختلف المؤرخون في مسألة الباني الأول للمسجد الأقصى على عدة أقوال: أنهم الملائكة، أو النبي آدم أبو البشر، أو ابنه شيث، أو سام بن نوح، أو النبي إبراهيم، ويرجع الاختلاف في ذلك إلى الاختلاف في الباني الأول للكعبة، وقد رجّح الباحث عبد الله معروف بأن آدم هو من بنى المسجد الأقصى البناء الأول، لرواية عن ابن عباس، ولترجيح أن يكون آدم هو الباني للكعبة، كما رجّحه الإمام ابن حجر العسقلاني في كتابه فتح الباري. ويُرجّح عبد الله معروف أن يكون البناء الأول للمسجد الأقصى قد اقتصر على وضع حدوده وتحديد مساحته التي تتراوح ما بين 142 و144 دونماً.\n\nعهد اليبوسيين وبني إسرائيل\nأما من بعد عهد آدم، فقد انقطعت أخبار المسجد لانعدام التأريخ في تلك الفترة، إلى أن سُجلت معلومات تاريخية عن أول مجموعة من البشر قدمت إلى مدينة القدس وسكنتها، وهم اليبوسيون (3000 - 1550 ق.م) قبيلة كنعانية، وهم الذين بنوا مدينة القدس وأسموها \"اور شليم (مدينة السلام)، حتى أن بقايا الآثار اليبوسية ما تزال باقية في سور المسجد الأقصى بحسب رأي بعض الباحثين. وفي تلك الفترة، هاجر النبي إبراهيم إلى مدينة القدس، وعمّر المسجد وصلّى فيه، وكذلك ابنه إسحق وحفيده يعقوب من بعده.\nوبعد ذلك آل أمر مدينة القدس والمسجد الأقصى إلى الفراعنة (1550 - 1000 ق.م)، ثم استولى عليها لاحقًا «القوم العمالقة»، ثم فتح المدينة النبي داود ومعه بنو إسرائيل عام 995 ق.م، فَوُسْع المدينة وعمّر المسجد الأقصى. ثم استلم الحكم ابنه سليمان، فعمّر المسجد وجدّده مرة أخرى، ويروي النبي محمد ذلك فيقول: «لِمَا فرغ سُليمانُ بنُ داودَ عليهما اَلسَّلَام من بناءِ بيتِ المقدسِ سأل اللهَ عَزَّ وَجِلَ ثلاثًا أن يُؤتيَه حُكمًا يُصادِفُ حُكمَه ومُلكًا لا ينبغي لأحدٍ من بعدِه وَأَنَّهُ لا يأتي هذا المسجدَ أحدٌ لا يُريدُ إِلَّا اَلصَّلَاة فيه إلَّا خرج من ذنوبِه كيومِ ولدَتْه أُمّه» فقال النبي محمد: «أما اثنتيْن فقد أُعْطِيهما وأرجو أن يكونَ قد أُعْطِي اَلثَّالِثَة»، وهذا البناء لسليمان هو الذي يقول اليهود بنسبته إليهم، ويطلقون عليه اسم «هيكل سليمان». وبوفاة النبي سليمان، انتهى حكم بني إسرائيل الذي دام 80 عامًا.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nبعد وفاة سليمان، انقسمت دولة بني إسرائيل إلى «مملكة إسرائيل» في الشمال، و«مملكة يهوذا» في الجنوب ومعها القدس، وما لبثت أن هاجمها البابليون وأحرقوا الهيكل، وسبوا اليهود إلى بابل فيما عُرْف بالسبي البابلي. بعد ذلك هزم الفرس البابليين، وسمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن أراد من أسرى اليهود في بابل بالعودة إلى القدس وإعادة بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود إلى القدس وشرعوا في بناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنة 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الأول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه.\n\nعهد الرومان والبيزنطيين\nاحتلّ الإغريق أراضي فلسطين، وخضعت للإسكندر المقدوني (حوالي عام 332 ق.م)، ثم لخلفائه البطالمة، ثم للسلوقيين، ولم تلبث المدينة حتى خضعت لحكم الإمبراطورية الرومانية، وكان من أوائل الحكام وأبرزهم الذين عينهم الرومان لحكم القدس الحاكم هيرودس (حوالي عام 37 ق.م)، وقد قام بتجديد بناء البيت المقدس (حوالي عام 20 ق.م)، كما أقام قلعة عظيمة بباب الخليل (يطلق عليها اليهود الآن اسم «قلعة داود»). وفي تلك الفترة تذكر المصادر الإسلامية بعثة النبي عيسى بن مريم، وزكريا وابنه يحيى بن زكريا إلى بني إسرائيل في القدس، حيث كان يحيى يعِظُهم داخل المسجد الأقصى، كما يفيد الحديث النبوي: «فجمع يحيى بن زكريا بني إسرائيل في بيت المقدس حتى امتلأ المسجد فقعد على الشرف فحمد الله وأثنى عليه ثم قال إن الله أمرني بخمس كلمات أن أعمل بهن وأمركم أن تعملوا بهن..»، كما يذكر الإنجيل الذي بين أيدي النصارى اليوم أن عيسى بن مريم أنكر على بني إسرائيل انحرافهم عن عبادة الله تعالى داخل المسجد الأقصى، وتحويلهم إياه إلى مكان للبيع والشراء.\nوبعد النبي عيسى بن مريم بحوالي 300 عام، انقسمت الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى الإمبراطورية الرومانية الغربية في الغرب، والإمبراطورية البيزنطية في الشرق، وبقيت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية هي المُسيطرة على القدس، فأصبحت القدس مدينة نصرانية، وبنوا فيها كنيسة القيامة. أما المسجد الأقصى فبقي متروكًا كما هو دون بناء. وفي عام 614 احتل الفرس مدينة القدس بمعاونة اليهود، وذلك بعد حرب طويلة ضد البيزنطيين الروم، وقد وقع ذلك في الفترة التي بُعث فيها النبي محمد في مكة، إذ يذكر القرآن قصة الحروب في سورة الروم: ﴿غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ ۝٢ فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ ۝٣﴾ [الروم:2–3].(2) وما لبث أن عاد البيزنطيون الروم إلى الحكم عام 624، وفي تلك الفترة أصبحت أرض المسجد الأقصى مكبًا للنّفايات، وذلك انتقامًا من اليهود، إذ كانت الصخرة المُشرفة قبلة لهم.\n\nعهد النبي محمد\nكانت هناك أهميّة خاصة للمسجد الأقصى في عهد النبي محمد، إذ كان القبلة الأولى للمسلمين بعد هجرة النبي محمد إلى المدينة المنورة عام 1 هـ الموافق 622م، فقد كان المسلمون يتوجّهون إلى المسجد الأقصى في صلواتهم، ومكثوا على ذلك مدة 16 شهرًا تقريبًا. فقد روى البراء بن عازب أنه قال: «لما قَدِمَ النَّبيُ صلى الله عليه وسلم المدينةَ صلّى نَحوَ بيتِ المقدسِ سِتةَ عَشرَ شهرًا أو سبعةَ عَشرَ شهرًا، وكان يُحبُ أنْ يُوَجِّهِ إلى الكَعبةِ، فأنزل اللّه  ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤﴾ [البقرة:144] (3).».\nوكان المسجد الأقصى وجهة النبي محمد في الرحلة المعجزة المعروفة باسم الإسراء والمعراج، وذلك ليلة 27 رجب بعد البعثة بعشر سنين (3 ق هـ)، إذ يؤمن المسلمون أن النبيَّ محمدًا خرج من المسجد الحرام بصحبة المَلَك جبريل راكبًا دابّة البراق، فنزل في المسجد الأقصى وربط البُراق بحلقة باب المسجد عند حائط البراق، وصلّى بجميع الأنبياء إمامًا، ثم عُرج به من الصخرة المشرّفة إلى فوق سبع سماوات مارًا بالأنبياء: آدم ويحيى بن زكريا وعيسى بن مريم ويوسف وإدريس وهارون وموسى وإبراهيم.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي\nعندما تولّى الخليفة أبو بكر الصديق خلافة المسلمين خلفاً للنبي محمد، قام بتسيير جيش أسامة بن زيد لفتح بلاد الشام عامّة ونشر الدعوة الإسلامية فيها، وقد كان النبي محمد قد جهّز جيش أسامة قبل وفاته، وما لبث أن تُوفي أبو بكر الصديق، فتولّى عمر بن الخطاب الخلافة، فكان أوّل ما فعله أن ولّى أبا عبيدة بن الجراح قيادة الجيش الفاتح لبلاد الشام بدلاً من خالد بن الوليد، فوصل أبو عبيدة بن الجراح إلى مدينة القدس (وكانت تُسمى «إيلياء»)، فاستعصت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعة أسوارها، حيث اعتصم أهلها داخل الأسوار، فحاصرهم حتى تعبوا وأرسلوا يطلبون الصلحَ وتسليم المدينة بلا قتال، واشترطوا أن يأتي خليفة المسلمين بنفسه إلى القدس ليتسلّم مفاتيحها منهم، فخرج عمر بن الخطاب من المدينة المنورة حتى وصل القدس، وذلك عام 15 هـ الموافق 636م، وأعطى أهلها الأمن وكتب لهم العهدة العمرية. وقد صحبه البطريرك «صفرونيوس» فزار كنيسة القيامة، ومن ثم أوصله إلى المسجد الأقصى، فلمّا دخله قال: «الله أكبر، هذا المسجد الذي وصفه لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم»، وكان في تلك الأيام هضبة خالية في قلبها الصخرة المشرفة، ثم أمر الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب ببناء المصلّى الرئيسي الذي سيكون مكان الصلاة الرئيسي في المسجد الأقصى، وهو موقع «الجامع القبلي» اليوم، ويقع في الجنوب في جهة القبلة، وكان المسجد في عهده خشبيًّا يتّسع لحوالي 1000 شخص، وبقي على حاله إلى زمن الخليفة الأموي معاوية بن أبي سفيان.\n\nالعهد الأموي\nبعد قيام الدولة الأموية في عام 41 هـ الموافق 661 على يد معاوية بن أبي سفيان، قام بتجديد بناء المسجد القبلي داخل المسجد الأقصى الذي بناه عمر بن الخطاب، فجعل من الحجر بدلاً من الخشب، ووسّعه ليسع 3000 مصلٍ. وقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين المسلمين في مذكراتهم مثل مجير الدين والمقدسي والسيوطي أن أوسع حركة تعمير للمسجد تمت في عهد الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان منذ عام 65 هـ الموافق 685 جنبا إلى جنب مع قبة الصخرة، وتواصلت في عهد ابنه الوليد بن عبد الملك حتى عام 96 هـ الموافق 715. حيث بدأ البناء الأموي للمسجد الأقصى ببناء قبة الصخرة وهي قبة ذهبية فوق الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب الأقصى (في منتصف المسجد أقرب إلى الغرب قليلا)، والتي تمثل أعلى نقطة في جبل البيت المقدس، ويعتقد أن معراج النبي محمد إلى السماء تم منها، لتكون قبة للمسجد كاملاً. وقبل الشروع ببنائها، أقيمت بجانبها قبة صغيرة في منتصف المسجد الأقصى تماماً، عُرفت بـ «قبة السلسلة»، لتكون مقراً للمشرفين على البناء للأقصى، وخزانة لجمع الأموال اللازمة لذلك، وقيل لتكون نموذجاً لقبة الصخرة.\n\nالزلزال وإعادة البناء\nفي عام 746م، تعرض المسجد الأقصى إلى زلزال أدى إلى تدميره، وبعد أربع سنوات أطاح السفاح بالخلافة الأموية، وأنشأ الخلافة العباسية عام 750م. وبعد أربع سنوات توفي السفاح بعد أن عهد بالخلافة لأخيه أبو جعفر المنصور، وقد أعلن المنصور نيته لإصلاح المسجد، وقال أنه لويحات الذهب والفضة التي غطت بوابات المسجد يجب إزالتها وتحولت إلى دينار ودرهم لتمويل إعادة الإعمار التي انتهت في عام 771م. وفي عام 774م، ضرب زلزال ثاني المسجد أدى إلى تدمير معظم إصلاحات المنصور، باستثناء تلك التي في الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وفي عام 780م، أعيد بناء المسجد في عهد الخليفة محمد المهدي الذي أمر ببنائه فانقص من طوله وزيد في عرضه وفي عام 985، أشار الجغرافي المقدسي أن المسجد الذي تم تجديده كان يضم «خمسة عشر رواق وخمسة عشر باب».\n\nفي عام 1033م، تعرض المسجد لأضرار بليغة بسبب وقوع زلزال آخر. وفي عهد الخليفة الفاطمي الظاهر تم إصلاح الأضرار، وتجديد المسجد بين عامي 1034 و1036م. وتم تخفيض عدد الأروقة جذريا من خمسة عشر إلى سبعة. وفي عهد الظاهر بنيت الأروقة الأربعة من القاعة المركزية والممر الذي يستخدم حاليا كأساس للمسجد. وقد كان الممر المركز ضعف عرض الممرات الأخرى، وقد وصف الجغرافي الفارسي ناصر بن خسرو المسجد الأقصى خلال زيارته له عام 1047م:\n\n.\n\nالحملة الصّليبيّة\nفي عام 1099م، سيطر الصليبيون على القدس، أثناء الحملة الصليبية الأولى. وبدلا من تدمير المسجد أطلقوا عليه اسم معبد سليمان، وقد استخدمه الصليبيون أولًا كقصر ملكي وإسطبل للخيول. وفي عام 1119م، تم تحويله إلى مقر لفرسان الهيكل. وخلال هذه الفترة، خضع المسجد إلى بعض التغييرات الهيكلية، بما في ذلك توسيع الشرفة الشمالية، وإضافة حنية (محراب الكنيسة) وجدار فاصل. وقد تم بناء دير جديد وكنيسة أيضًا في الموقع، جنبًا إلى جنب مع غيرها من الهياكل المختلفة وقد شيد فرسان المعبد أقباء ومرفقاتها في الجهة الغربية والشرقية للمبنى؛ ويستعمل القبو الغربي حاليًا كمسجد للنساء أما الشرقي فيستخدم كمتحف إسلامي.\nبعد حصار 1187م استطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي باستعادة القدس من يد الصليبيين، وأجريت العديد من الإصلاحات والتجديدات في المسجد الأقصى. من أجل إعداد المسجد لأداء صلاة الجمعة، وفي غضون أسبوع من استعادة صلاح الدين للقدس تم إزالة المراحيض ومخازن الحبوب المثبتة من قبل الصليبيين في الأقصى، وقد تم أيضا إزالة الأرضيات المغطاة بالسجاد الثمين، وباطنها المعطر بماء الورد والبخور، وقد كلف نور الدين الزنكي، ببناء منبر جديد مصنوع من العاج والخشب في 1168-1169م، ولكن تم الانتهاء منه بعد وفاته، وقد قام صلاح الدين بإضافة منبر نور الدين زنكي إلى المسجد في نوفمبر 1187م، وفي عام 1218م، تم تشييد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد مع ثلاث بوابات في عهد المعظم السلطان الأيوبي لدمشق، وفي عام 1345م، تم إضافة أضاف اثنين من البلاطات وبوابتين على الجانب الشرقي للمسجد، بأمر من السلطان المملوكي الكامل سيف الدين شعبان ابن قلاوون.\nوبعد وصول العثمانيين إلى السلطة في 1517م، لم يقوموا بأي تجديدات أو إصلاحات للمسجد نفسه، لكن قاموا ببعض الإضافات للحرم الشريف ككل. وشمل ذلك بناء نافورة قاسم باشا عام 1527م، وتم ترميم بركة الرارانج، وبناء ثلاث قباب قائمة بذاتها، وأبرزها قبة النبي التي بنيت في عام 1538م. وقد اهتم الولاة العثمانيين في القدس بالمسجد كثيرا وجعلوه في مقدمة أولياتهم.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالتجديد الأول للمسجد الأقصى في القرن العشرين حدث في عام 1922، عندما كلف المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى تحت أمين الحسيني (مفتي القدس الكبرى) المهندس المعماري التركي أحمد كيماليتين استعادة المسجد الأقصى والمعالم الآثرية في ساحاته. كما أن المجلس أيضا قام بتكليف المهندسين المعماريين البريطانيين وخبراء مصريين والمسؤولين المحليين للمساهمة والإشراف على الإصلاحات والإضافات التي نفذها كيماليتين مابين 1924–1925. وقد شملت التجديدات تعزيز الأسس الأموية القديمة للمسجد، وتصحيح الأعمدة الداخلية، لتحل محل العوارض ونصب السقالات، وشملت أيضا التجديدات ترميم الأقواس والمنطقة الداخلية للقبة الرئيسية وكيفية الحفاظ عليها، وقد تم إعادة بناء الجدار الجنوبي، واستبدال الأخشاب في الصحن المركزي بكتلة من الخرسانة. وكشفت التجديدات أيضا عن فسيفساء تعود إلى العصر الفاطمي، وأيضا أكتشف وجود نقوش على الأقواس الداخلية التي كانت مغطاة بالجبس. وقد زينت الأقواس بالذهب والجص الأخضر ملون واستبدلت الأخشاب بالنحاس. وجدد ربع نوافذ الزجاج المعشق أيضا بعناية شديدة حفاظا على تصاميمهم العباسية والفاطمية الأصلية، وقد تعرض المسجد الأقصى لأضرار شديدة بسبب وقوع زلازل ما بين 1927 و1937، وقد تم إصلاح الأضرار التي لحقت بالمسجد في عام 1938 و1942.\n\nحريق المسجد\nتعرض في صبيحة يوم الخميس الموافق 22 أغسطس 1969م لحريق على يد يهودي أسترالي متطرف اسمه مايكل دينس روهن، حيث تم حرق الجامع القبلي الذي سقط سقف قسمه الشرقي بالكامل، كما احترق منبر صلاح الدين، الذي أمر ببنائه نور الدين زنكي قبل تحرير المسجد الأقصى من الصليبيين وقام (صلاح الدين الأيوبي) بوضعه داخل المسجد بعد التحرير، وقد قال روهن تعقيبا على الحريق الذي إفتعله أنه كان يأمل من إحراق المسجد الأقصى كان من شأنه أن يعجل المجيء الثاني للمسيح، مما يجعل الطريق لاعادة بناء الهيكل اليهودي المزعوم على جبل الهيكل. وأدخل روهن إلى مصحة الأمراض العقلية، وردا على الحادث، تم عقد قمة للدول الإسلامية في الرباط في العام نفسه، الذي استضافه الملك فيصل. ويعتبر حريق الأقصى أحد العوامل المحفزة لتشكيل منظمة المؤتمر الإسلامي (والآن منظمة التعاون الإسلامي)، وفي عام 1972، تم ترميم المسجد الأقصى والمنبر معه، وتتولى الأردن ترميم وإصلاح المسجدين على نفقتها الخاصة كلما دعا الأمر لذلك.\nفي الثمانينيات من القرن الماضي، تآمر بن شوشان ويهودا اتزيون وكلاهما عضو في منظمة غوش ايمونيم السرية، لتفجير المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة. أما اتزيون فقد كان يعتقد أن تفجير اثنين من المساجد سوف يتسبب بصحوة روحية في الكيان الصهيوني، وسوف يحل جميع مشاكل اليهود. كما أعرب كل من بن شونان واتزينون عن أملهم في بناء المعبد الثالث في القدس وتحديداً في موقع المسجد الأقصى. وفي 15 يناير 1988، خلال الانتفاضة الأولى، أطلقت القوات الصهيونية الرصاص المطاطي والغاز المسيل للدموع على المتظاهرين خارج المسجد، مما أدى إلى إصابة 40 من المصلين. وفي 8 أكتوبر 1990، قتل 22 فلسطينياً وأصيب أكثر من 100 آخرين من «شرطة الحدود الصهيونية» خلال الاحتجاجات التي تم تشغيلها بواسطة الإعلان عن «جبل الهيكل»، على يد مجموعة من اليهود المتدينين، الذين كانوا في طريقهم لوضع حجر الأساس للهيكل الثالث المزعوم.\n\nالقرن 21\nفي 28 سبتمبر 2000، قام أرئيل شارون وأعضاء من حزب الليكود، جنبا إلى جنب مع 1000 حارس مسلح، بزيارة المسجد الأقصى، مما تسبب بمظاهرة كبيرة من الفلسطينيين احتجاجا على هذه الزيارة، وبدأ الفلسطينيون من الحرم القدسي برمي الحجارة على الشرطة الإسرائيلية. التي قامت بإطلاق الغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي على الحشد مما أسفر عن مقتل أربعة وإصابة حوالي 200 شخص، مما اسفر عن اصابة 24 شخصًا. وقد أثارت هذه الزيارة انتفاضة لمدة خمس سنوات على يد الفلسطينيين، ويُشار إليها باسم «انتفاضة الأقصى»، ويرى بعض المعلقين، نقلاً عن خطب لاحقة من قبل مسؤولين في السلطة الفلسطينية، وخاصة عماد الفالوجي وعرفات نفسه، أن الانتفاضة كانت مخططة مسبقا قبل أشهر من هذه الزيارة ، ربما في يوليو أو تموز عند عودة ياسر عرفات من محادثات كامب ديفيد.\nومع اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثالثة شدد الاحتلال الإسرائيلي القيود على دخول المسجد الأقصى من تحديد أعمار المصلين، فلا يسمح لمن هم دون الـ45 سنة من سكان الضفة الغربية من دخول المسجد بدون تصاريح، حتى في أهم وأقدس المناسبات الإسلامية مثل شهر رمضان المبارك، أما بالنسبة لسكان قطاع غزة فلا يسمح إلا لأعداد قليلة من كبار السن ممن تتجاوز أعمارهم 50 سنة بدخول المسجد الأقصى وبتصاريح خاصة.\n\nقرار اليونيسكو سنة 2016\nفي يوم 14 أكتوبر 2016، اتخذت لجنة البرامج والعلاقات الخارجية في المجلس التنفيذي لمنظمة اليونسكو قرارًا جاء فيه أن المنظمة تعتبر المسجد الأقصى أحد المقدسات الإسلامية، بدون ذكر وجود أي علاقة تاريخية بين اليهود والمسجد، ومستنكرة اقتحامه المتكرر من قبل بعض المتطرفين الإسرائيليين ومن قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي. وجاء هذا القرار استجابةً لمشروع تم تقديمه من قبل الجزائر ومصر ولبنان والمغرب وعمان وقطر والسودان. وقد رحبت عدة منظمات وهيئات إسلامية بالقرار وفي مقدمتها منظمة التعاون الإسلامي ومرصد الجامع الأزهر، وهيئة علماء المسلمين في العراق، إلى جانب الحكومة والفصائل الفلسطينية. بالمقابل، قالت مصادر إسرائيلية أن الحكومة تسعى إلى تليين قرار اليونيسكو سالف الذكر، وأن إسرائيل تجري اتصالات دبلوماسية حثيثة لتليين صيغة نص القرار. وقال محللين آخرين أيضًا أن هذا تأكيد دولي على أن القدس منطقة محتلة، وعلى إسرائيل التفاوض بشأنها.\n\nمنع الصلاة في المسجد سنة 2017\nفي يوم الجمعة 20 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 14 يوليو 2017م، قالت الشرطة الإسرائيلية إنها قررت منع صلاة الجمعة في المسجد الأقصى لهذا اليوم وإغلاق أبوابه حتى إشعار آخر، وذلك في أعقاب عملية إطلاق نار وقعت صباح نفس اليوم المذكور أفضت إلى استشهاد ثلاثة شبان فلسطينيين وقتل ثلاثة من أفراد الشرطة الإسرائيلية بالقرب من باب الأسباط بالقدس. ونشرت الشرطة المذكورة تصريح مكتوب قالت فيه أن قائدها العام في القدس «يهورام هاليفي» قرر إغلاق أبواب المسجد، وإعلانه منطقة عسكرية يمنع بموجبها على المصلين دخوله إضافة إلى البلدة القديمة في القدس، لتكون تلك المرة الأولى التي تقفل فيها أبواب المسجد أمام المصلين منذ سنة 1969م، وذلك في اليوم التالي لإقدام اليهودي المتطرف مايكل دينس روهن على محاولة إحراق المسجد. بِالمُقابل قال مكتب رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو إن الإغلاق هو ليوم واحد فقط. وعندما أُعلن هذا الأمر، دعا المفتي العام للقدس والديار الفلسطينية الشيخ محمد حسين إلى شد الرحال للأقصى والتواجد على الحواجز وفي الساحات لإقامة صلاة الجمعة، وقال أن «لا قوة على وجه الأرض ستمنعهم من التوجه للأقصى وإقامة صلاة الجمعة فيه». بالمقابل شرعت منظمات وأحزاب يهودية بحملة تحريض واسعة بحق المسجد الأقصى والمصلين، عقب عملية إطلاق النار سالِفة الذِكر، وقال عضو الكنيست من حزب البيت اليهودي «موتي يوغاف» إلى إغلاق المسجد الأقصى بوجه المسلمين لفترة دائمة، وقالت منظمة جبل الهيكل إلى الرد على عملية القدس عبر زيادة بناء المستوطنات اليهودية وزيادة ساعات الاقتحام للأقصى، كما قال نائب وزير الجيش الإسرائيلي، الحاخام إيلي بن دهان، إنه يجب على اليهود أن يعززوا قبضتهم على المسجد الأقصى، وضمان أن يصلي كل يهودي فيه بأمان وفي كل وقت.\n\nوفي يوم 22 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 16 يوليو 2017م، نصبت السُلطات الإسرائيلية بوَّابات تفتيش إلكترونيَّة على عدد من أبواب الأقصى في سبيل تعزيز إجراءاتها الأمنيَّة، بِالإضافة إلى كاميرات مُراقبة لِلاطلاع على ما يجري داخل باحات المسجد. ثُمَّ أعلن وزير الأمن الداخلي الإسرائيلي جلعاد أردان افتتاح بابيّ الأسباط والمجلس المُؤديان إلى المسجد، لكنَّهُ في نفس الوقت قال أنَّ «إسرائيل هي صاحبة السيادة في المسجد، وموقف الدُول الأُخرى ليس مهماً» وأنَّ «إسرائيل إذا قررت فعل شيء في القدس ستُنفذه». وقد رفض موظفو الأوقاف الإسلاميَّة الدُخول إلى المسجد ومُباشرة أعمالهم احتجاجًا على هذه الخطوة الإسرائيليَّة. أيضًا رفض عامَّة الناس الانصياع للإجراءات الإسرائيليَّة ورفضوا دخول المسجد عبر هذه البوابات، وتجمهروا أمام باب الأسباط لِأداء الصلاة، وأعلنوا الاعتصام لِلحيلولة دون تحويل وضع المسجد الأقصى إلى ما يشبه الوضع القائم في المسجد الإبراهيمي بالخليل والإبقاء على البوابات الإلكترونية بشكلٍ دائم. استمرَّ الوضع قائمًا على هذه الحال بضعة أيَّام، فتظاهر المقدسيُّون وتابعوا اعتصامهم أمام أبواب المسجد الأقصى، وتخلل ذلك بعض الاشتباكات مع الشرطة الإسرائيليَّة، وفي يوم 4 ذي القعدة 1438هـ الموافق فيه 27 يوليو 2017م أعلنت الشرطة الإسرائيلية إزالة كل الإجراءات الأمنية التي استحدثتها وعودة الوضع إلى ما كان عليه قبل وقوع الهُجوم الذي أدى إلى مقتل ثلاثة من أفراد الشرطة، فعمَّت الاحتفالات مدينة القدس ابتهاجًا بفتح أبواب المسجد الأقصى، وأقيمت الصلوات في مواعيدها المعتادة بداخل الحرم يومذاك. وبعد إعادة افتتاح المسجد ببضعة أيَّام، وتحديدًا يوم 8 ذي القعدة 1438هـ، كشف رئيس مركز القدس الدولي حسن خاطر، أن السلطات الإسرائيلية صادرت وثائق مهمة كانت محفوظة بداخله، تتعلق بأملاك وأوقاف القدس وأراضيها، وذلك أثناء فترة إغلاقه أمام المسلمين. وحذَّر من كارثة كبيرة تحوم حول الحرم القدسي نظرًا لأن إسرائيل تمهد للتلاعب بالوثائق التي استولت عليها بهدف إلحاق الضرر بالأوقاف، التي تشكل أملاكها ما نسبته 90% من البلدة القديمة، مقسمة بين عقارات وأراضٍ ووقف إسلامي. بعد هذا الاكتشاف، شكَّلت دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية بالقدس لجنة فنية لحصر حجم المفقودات من الوثائق المسروقة للتحرك ضد إسرائيل.\n\nاقتحام المسجد الأقصى 2022\nفي صباح يوم الجمعة الموافق 15 أبريل 2022 قامت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي باقتحام المسجد الأقصى، مستخدمةً قنابل الغاز المسيل للدموع والقنابل الصوتية، مما أدى إلى إصابة ما لا يقل عن 90 فلسطينياً بجروح.\n\nالعمارة\nالمسجد الأقصى هو المنطقة المحاطة بالسور المستطيل الواقعة في جنوب شرق مدينة القدس المسورة والتي تعرف بالبلدة القديمة. وتبلغ مساحة المسجد قرابة الـ 144 دونماً ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد الأقصى حسب الصورة المرفقة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلم. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تسمى هضبة موريا وتعتبر الصخرة هي أعلى نقطة في المسجد وتقع في موقع القلب بالنسبة للمسجد الأقصى الشريف.\nوتبلغ قياسات المسجد: من الجنوب 281 مترا ومن الشمال 310 أمتار ومن الشرق 462 مترا ومن الغرب 491 مترا. وتشكل هذه المساحة سدس مساحة البلدة القديمة، وهذه الحدود لم تتغير منذ وضع المسجد أول مرة كمكان للصلاة بخلاف المسجد الحرام والمسجد النبوي اللذين تم توسعيهما عدة مرات.\nوللمسجد الأقصى أربعة مآذن هي مئذنة باب المغاربة الواقعة الجنوب الغربي، مئذنة باب السلسلة الواقعة في الجهة الغربية قرب باب السلسلة، مئذنة باب الغوانمة الواقعة في الشمال الغربي، ومئذنة باب الأسباط الواقعة في الجهة الشمالية.\n\nمعالم المسجد الأقصى\nالمصليات\nيتكون المسجد الأقصى من سبع مصليات أو مساجد معمدة مع عدة قاعات صغيرة إضافية من الجهة الغربية والشرقية من الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وقد كان يوجد 121 نافذة من الزجاج الملون في المسجد من عصور الخلافة العباسية والفاطمية. تم استعادة حوالي ربعهم في عام 1924.\nوالمساجد هي:\n\n1 - الجامع القِبلي\n\nوهو الجامع المسقوف الذي تعلوه قبّة رصاصية، والواقع في جنوبيّ المسجد الأقصى في جهة القِبلة، ومن هنا جاءت تسميته بـ «القِبلي». ويُعتبر هذا الجامع المصلّى الرئيس الذي يخطب فيه الخطيب في صلاة الجمعة، كما أنّه يُعتبر المصلّى الرئيس للرجال داخل المسجد الأقصى حيث يقف الإمام، وحيث يوجد المحراب والمنبر الرئيسان. والبناء الحالي يعود للعصر الأموي، حيث بَدأ العمل على تجديد بناءه الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان، وأتمّه ابنه الخليفة الوليد بن عبد الملك بين عامي 86 هـ-96 هـ الموافق 705-714م، وكان في الأصل مكونًا من 15 رواقًا، ثم أًعيد ترميمه بعد تعرّضه لزلازل أدّت لتصدّعه، واختُصِرت أروقته في عصر الخليفة الفاطمي الظاهر لإعزاز دين الله إلى 7 أروقة، وفي وقتنا الحالي يتكوّن من رواق كبير في الوسط و3 أروقة في كل جانب. وللجامع قبّة مرتفعة داخلية مصنوعة من الخشب، تعلوها القبّة الرئيسة الخارجيّة والمُغطّاة بألواح الرصاص. وتبلغ مساحة الجامع حوالي 4 دونمات، طوله 80م وعرضه 55م، على اختلاف يسير بين طول ضلعه الشرقي والغربي، وله 11 بابًا، ويتّسع إلى حوالي 5500 مصلّ.\nوكان أوّل من بناه هو عمر بن الخطاب عند الفتح الإسلامي عام 15 هـ، وذلك بعد أن استشار كعب الأحبار في مكان بناء المسجد، فأشار عليه في مكان الصخرة، فرفض ذلك عمر وقال: «بل نجعل قبلته صدره كما جعل رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قبلة مساجدنا صدورنا»، وكان بناؤه من الخشب، وكان يتّسع حوالي 1000 مصلّ، ثمّ جدّده الخليفة معاوية بن أبي سفيان، فصار يتّسع حوالي 3000 مصلّ. وعندما سيطر الصليبيون على القدس قسّموا الجامع القبلي إلى ثلاثة أقسام: أحدها تحوّل إلى مكاتب، والآخر إلى سكن لفرسان المعبد، والثالث إلى كنيسة، وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي فرمّم المسجد عام 538 هـ الموافق 1187، ثم توالت الترميمات في عصر الدولة المملوكية والدولة العثمانية لاحقًا. وفي العصر الحديث، وبعد احتلال اليهود لفلسطين، بقي الجامع القبلي تحت تهديد اليهود، فعمدوا إلى أعمال حفر تحت أغلب الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد وتحت أساسات الجامع القبلي كلها مما هدّدت أساساته، كما تعرّض الجامع القبلي لحريق مفتعل وذلك يوم 21 أغسطس 1969 على يد مايكل دينس روهن، فاحترق منبر نور الدين زنكي، وامتد الحريق ليشمل أغلب الأروقة الثلاثة الشرقية، بالإضافة إلى سقفه الخشبي.\nوفي يناير 2007، ذكر عدنان الحسيني – رئيس دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية والمسؤول عن كتائب شهداء – أنه سيجري تركيب منبر جديد؛ وقد جرى تثبيته في فبراير 2007. كما أن تصميم المنبر الجديد هو من تصميم جمال بدران استناداً إلى نسخة طبق الأصل من منبر صلاح الدين الأيوبي، وقد عمل عليه بدران مدة خمس سنوات. المنبر نفسه جرى بناؤه في الأردن في مدة أربع سنوات، واستخدم الحرفيين أساليب النجارة القديمة لبنائه، واستعمل قطع من أوتاد بدلاً من المسامير لتثبيته.\n\n2 - المصلى المرواني\n\nويقع في أسفل الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية للمسجد الأقصى، وكان يُعرَف قديمًا «بالتسوية الشرقية»، وقد بناه الأمويون كتسوية معمارية لهضبة بيت المقدس الأصلية المنحدرة جهة الجنوب، حتى يتسنّى البناء فوق قسمها الجنوبيّ. ويتكوّن المصلّى المرواني من 16 رواقًا، وتبلغ مساحته الإجمالية أكثر من 4000 مترًا مربعًا، وهي أكبر مساحة مُغطاة للصلاة في المسجد الأقصى. عندما سيطر الصليبيون على المسجد الأقصى، قاموا بتحويل المصلّى المرواني إلى إسطبلات للخيول، وسمّوه «إسطبلات سليمان»، وهي تسميّة توراتية نسبةً إلى النبي سليمان. وبعد تحرير المسجد الأقصى في عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي، أعاد المصلى المرواني إلى استعماله السابق باعتباره تسويةً ومخزنًا. وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى عام 1996، حيث تم افتتاحه كمُصلّى وسُمي يومئذٍ بالمُصلّى المرواني نسبةً إلى عبد الملك بن مروان.\nوكان سبب افتتاحه كمُصلّى هو تسريب وثيقة سريّة لتقسيم المسجد الأقصى باعتبار ما تحت الأرض لليهود وما فوق الأرض للمسلمين وذلك في عام 1995، بعد ذلك قررت عدة هيئات إسلامية البدء بالعمل على فتح المصلّى المرواني، فبدأت بتنظيف المكان، ومدّ الكهرباء إليه وإضاءته، ثم تبليط المصلّى، وتبرعت مصر بفرش المصلّى، وتم فتح عدّة أبواب له. وكان هذا العمل الذي تم هو السبب المُعلَن للزيارة التي قام بها أرئيل شارون للمسجد يوم الخميس 28 سبتمبر 2000، والتي أدّت لانطلاق انتفاضة الأقصى والتي استمرت 5 سنوات.\n3 - مصلى الأقصى القديم\n\nويقع هذا المصلّى تحت الجامع القبلي، يدخل إليه عبر درج يقع قرب الرواق الأوسط في الجهة الشمالية للجامع القبلي، وهو عبارة عن ممر يتكون من رواقين باتجاه الجنوب بناه الأمويون ليكون مدخلاً ملكيًا إلى المسجد الأقصى من القصور الأموية التي تقع خارج حدود الأقصى من الجهة الجنوبية. ويوجد عند المدخل الشمالي منه غرفة صغيرة كانت تستخدم للحرس، كما يوجد غرفة أكبر تقع عند بقايا الباب المزدوج عند المدخل الجنوبي للمصلّى والتي كانت تستخدم للحرس أيضًا، وهي تحتوي على محراب في مدخلها، ويوجد بئر عميق ومغلق الآن. ومن العناصر المعمارية المميزة فيه وجود قبّتان أمويتان مسطحتان تقومان فوق مدخله الجنوبي، وعندهما يوجد أعمدة حجرية ضخمة تشكل الأساس الذي تقوم عليه منطقة قبة الجامع القبلي، وقد رُممت عام 1927. بتمويل من الملك فاروق من مصر، وقد كان هذا المصلّى مغلقًا لا يُفتح إلا في حالات الضروري حتى عام 1998، حيث تم تنظيفه وإعداده ليكون مكانًا ملائمًا للصلاة، وهو يتّسع لحوالي 1000 مصلّ.\n4 - مسجد قبّة الصخرة\n\nوتعتبر قبّته إحدى أهم وأبرز المعالم المعمارية الإسلامي، وأقدم بناء إسلامي بقي محافظًا على شكله وزخرفته في الأغلب. بنى هذه القبّة الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدأ في بنائها عام 66 هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72 هـ الموافق 691م، وأشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوة الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّة الصخرة عبارة عن بناء مثمن الأضلاع له أربعة أبواب، وفي داخله تثمينة أخرى تقوم على دعامات وأعمدة أسطوانية، في داخلها دائرة تتوسطها «الصخرة المشرفة» التي يعتقد المسلمون بأن النبي محمد صعد منها إلى السماء في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج، وترتفع هذه الصخرة نحو 1.5 مترًا عن أرضية البناء، وهي غير منتظمة الشكل يتراوح قطرها بين 13 و18 مترًا، وتوجد مغارة تُسمّى «مغارة الأرواح» أسفل جزء منها تعلوها فتحة، وتعلو الصخرة في الوسط قبّة دائرة بقطر حوالي 20 مترًا، مطلية من الخارج بألواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35م، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع 5م. ويعتقد بعض الباحثين أن بناتها خططوا لجعلها قبة للمسجد الأقصى كاملاً.\n5 - مسجد البراق\n\nويقع في الناحية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى، وسُمّي بذلك نسبةً إلى المكان الذي ربط فيه النبي محمد دابته البراق في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج، وفيه حلقة عثمانية يُقال أنّها وُضعت في مكان الحلقة التي رُبط عندها البراق. كما يحتوي المسجد على محراب أموي، وكان يوجد في جهته الغربية باب قديم يُسمّى «باب البراق» وقد اُغلق بعد العهد الأموي، والذي كان يصل مباشرة إلى ساحة البراق خارج المسجد الأقصى، وينزل إلى مصلّى البراق حاليًا من خلال الرواق الغربي للأقصى بدرجات حجرية، والذي يُفتح كل يوم جمعة للزيارة.\n6 - مسجد المغاربة\nويقع في الزاوية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى جنوبي حائط البراق، وله بابان، واحد مُغلق في الجهة الشمالية، وآخر مفتوح في الجهة الشرقية. ويُستعمل اليوم كقاعة عرض لأغراض المتحف الإسلامي الذي نُقل من الرباط المنصوري إلى هذا المسجد وذلك في عام 1348 هـ الموافق 1929. وقد قيل أنّ أوّل من بناه هو صلاح الدين الأيوبي سنة 590 هـ الموافق 1193، وكانت تُقام فيه الصلاة على المذهب المالكي.\n7 - جامع النساء\nويقع داخل المسجد الأقصى، ويمثّل الجزء الجنوبي الغربي منه، حيث يمتد بمحاذاة حائطه الجنوبي بدءًا من الجدار الغربي للجامع القِبلي وحتى الحائط الغربي للمسجد. وهو اليوم مُقسّم إلى ثلاثة أقسام: أولها غربي ملحق بالمتحف الإسلامي، وثانيها في الوسط وبه توجد مكتبة الأقصى الرئيسية، وثالثها شرقي ملاصق للجامع القبلي، ويُستعمل الآن كمستودع. وجامع النساء عبارة عن بناء كبير واسع مرتفع عن مستوى الجامع القبلي، ويرى باحثون بأن بناءه يعود إلى العهد الصليبي، حيث بُني ككنيسة، ليعيده صلاح الدين الأيوبي لمُصلّى خُصّص للنساء.\n8-مصلى باب الرحمة\n\nأنشأ الأميون باب الرحمة ليكون مشتركا بين سور القدس التاريخي والمسجد الأقصى، وبُني المصلى ملاصقا له، فمنذ العهد الأموي حتى العباسي بقي المصلى مفتوحا، وتعمد الفرنجة خلال احتلالهم للمدينة فتح المصلى في أيام عيد الفصح، وبعد تحرير القدس أغلق القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي الباب المشترك بين السور والمسجد لأسباب أمنية وأعاد استخدام المبنى للصلاة وظل كذلك في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني.أُهمل المكان في فترة الاحتلال البريطاني التي اتسمت بالتضييق على المصلين لكنه بقي مفتوحا أمامهم طيلة العهدين البريطاني والأردني، ومع مجيء الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 تم تهميش المصلى، لكنه عاد وانتعش عام 1992 عندما بات مقرا للجنة التراث الإسلامي التي حُظرت عام 2003 وكان ذلك الإجراء الذريعة التي اتخذها الاحتلال لإغلاق المصلى المستهدف، وفي العام 2018 وضعت نقطة حراسة لشرطة الاحتلال الإسرائيلي أعلى المصلى، وفي العام 2019 وضعت قوات الاحتلال قفل على البوابة المؤدية للمصلى وهو ما فجّر هبّة شعبية أدت لإعادة فتح المصلى، ومنذ إعادة فتح المصلى استهدفت شرطة الاحتلال الحراس والمصلين وكافة المبادرات الرامية لإعمار المصلى وتهيئته لاستقبال المصلين.\n\nواجهة المسجد والشرفة\nالواجهة\n\nتم بناء واجهة المسجد في عام 1065م، بناء على تعليمات من الخليفة الفاطمي المستنصر بالله. مع درابزين (بهو) يتكون من ممرات وأعمدة الصغيرة. وقد تضررت الواجهة خلال الحقبة الصليبية خلال حكمهم لفلسطين، ولكن تم ترميمها وتجديدها في العهد الأيوبي. بالإضافة إلى ذلك تم تغطية الواجهة بالبلاط. أما المواد المستعملة في أقواس الواجهة فهي مواد زينة منحوتة أخذت من الهياكل الصليبية في القدس. كما يوجد أربعة عشر قوس حجري على طول الواجهة معظمها من نمط العمارة الرومانسكية، أما الأقواس الخارجية التي أضيفت في العهد المملوكي فقد اتبعت نفس التصميم العام. كما يوجد قوس مركزي عند مدخل واجهة المسجد.\n\nالشرفة\nالشرفة تقع في الجزء العلوي من الواجهة. والخلجان المركزية من الشرفة فهي تعود لفترة فرسان الهيكل أثناء الحملة الصليبية الأولى، أما الشرفة نفسها فقد أمر ببنائها المعظم ابن العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب أخ صلاح الدين الأيوبي وذلك عام 1217م.\n\nالقباب\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى عدة قباب جميلة تعد من أبرز معالمه وإحدى التحف الإسلامية الخالدة، وأجملها كما أنها تضفي عليه جواً قدسياً، خاصة درتها قبة الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. والمعلوم أن المسجد الأقصى يحتوي على خمسة عشرة قبة وهي:\n\nقبة الصخرة\n\nقبة الصخرة هي المبنى المثمن ذو القبة الذهبية، وموقعها بالنسبة للمسجد الأقصى ككل كموقع القلب من جسد الإنسان أي أنها تقع في وسطه إلى اليسار قليلاً. وهذه القبة تعتبر هي قبة المسجد ككل، وهي من أقدم وأعظم المعالم الإسلامية المتميزة. ويعود تاريخ تاشييدها إلى العهد الأموي عام 72هـ (692م)، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى الصخرة التي تقع داخل المبنى والتي عرج منها النبي النبي محمد إلى السماء في ليلة الإسراء والمعراج على أرجح الأقوال لأن الصخرة هي أعلى بقعة في المسجد الأقصى. وقبة الصخرة هي حالياً مصلى النساء في المسجد الأقصى. والصخرة غير معلقة كما يعتقد عامة الناس، لكنه يوجد أسفلها مغارة صغيرة.\n\nقبة السلسلة.\n\nوتقع قبة السلسلة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك شرقي قبة الصخرة، وتم تشييدها بناء على أوامر الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان عام 72هـ (692م)، ويشير ابن عبد ربه مؤلف كتاب العقد الفريد، أن سبب تسميتها بقبة السلسلة أنه كانت توجد بها سلسلة يمسها المتقاضون وأن هذه السلسلة حليف كل صديق في القول وأنها تبتعد عن كل من يكذب وتربط هذه الروايات بين هذه السلسلة وتلك التي كان يتخذها النبي داود لحسم النزاع بين الخصوم في مجلس القضاء، وهذا لاشك من الخزعبلات غير المقبولة.\nومن المعروف أن هذه القبة قد تعرضت للانتهاك أثناء الحملات الصليبية وأعيد تجديدها عدة مرات منذ استرداد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بيت المقدس وقد أوقفت سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني عمليات الترميم التي كانت جارية بها في عام 1970م ، ثم استكملت في التسعينات من القرن الماضي.\nوقبة السلسلة هي على شكل سداسي يحملها مضلع مسدس مؤلف داخلياً من ستة أعمدة، تحمل تحمل بدورها العقود التي يرتكز عليها عامود القبة، وخارجها أحد عشر عموداً تحمل عقوداً مماثلة وقد سد فيما بعد بين اثنين من هذه الأعمدة لإنشاء المحراب الموجود بها وعلى ذلك فإن لهذه القبة سبعة عشر عموداً، وقد كسيت هذه القبة ببلاطات من القاشاني التركي عند ترميمها في عهد السلطان سليمان القانوني في القرن 16م.\n\nقبة النحوية.\n\nتقع القبة النحوية في الطرف الجنوب الغربي لساحة قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الأيوبي عام 1207 على يد الأمير حسام الدين أبي معد قمباز في عهد الملك شرف الدين أبو المنصور عيسى الأيوبي، لتكون مدرسة متخصصة لتعليم العلوم اللغوية من صرف ونحو داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، فعرفت بالقبة النحوية، وأيضا المدرسة النحوية.\nتتكون القبة من ثلاث غرف متصلة، حيث تقوم قبتها الكبرى فوق الغرفة الغربية، بينما توجد قبة أخرى أقل ارتفاعا فوق الغرفة الشرقية، ولها مدخل رّئيسي يقع في واجهتها الشّمالية.\nتحولت القبة النحوية إلى مكتبة في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وتستعمل اليوم كمقر لمحكمة الاستئناف الشرعية (وهو جزء من المحكمة الشرعية في القدس، والذي يتبع بدوره للأردن)، واسمها الدقيق الآن هو: مكتب القائم بأعمال قاضي القضاة، ومن تحتها أرشيف المحكمة.\nوقد حماها هذا الاستعمال هو من أخطار الاحتلال، حيث أنها تشرف بشكل واضح على حائط البراق من داخل الأقصى المبارك، كما تشرف على بابي المغاربة وباب السلسلة. ولذلك تعتبر نقطةً ساخنةً عند وقوع اعتداءات صهيونية على المسجد الأقصى المبارك، كما حدث في انتفاضة الأقصى عام 2000م، حيث اقتحم الصهاينة الأقصى من باب السلسلة، وسيطروا على القبة النحوية، ومن ثم سيطروا على الجهة الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وقتلوا شهيدا عند باب المغاربة، وقد استشهد 5 مصلين برصاص الاحتلال في ذلك اليوم، فضلا عن إصابة العشرات.\n\nقبة الأرواح\nوتقع قبة الأرواح داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك بالقرب من قبة المعراج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني في منتصف القرن 16م.\nوقد شيدت هذه القبة على مضلع مثمن الأضلاع يتألف من ثمانية أعمدة رخامية تحمل ثمانية عقود حجرية وهي قبة قليلة الارتفاع بعض الشيء.\n\nقبة النبي سليمان\n\nوتقع قبة النبي سليمان داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك من الجهة الشمالية ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الأموي وعلى الأرجح في عهد الخليفة سليمان بن عبد الملك.\nوتقوم هذه القبة أيضا على بناء مثمن يبدأ بأربعة من الرخام وتم تخصيص واحدة منها لباب الدخول يواجه المحراب، وفوق المثمن تم تشييد عامود أسطواني وقد فتحت به ثمانية نوافذ معقودة للإضاءة، وفوق هذا العامود خوذة القبة وهي حجرية متينة البنيان وبداخل هذه القبة توجد صخرة صغيرة.\n\nقبة الخضر\n\nوتقع قبة الخضر داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك في الزاوية الشمالية الغربية لساحة قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى الفترة العثمانية، وتقوم هذه القبة على ستة أعمدة رخامية رشيقة وتحمل هذه الأعمدة عقودا حجرية مدببة ومزخرفة.\n\nقبة المعراج\n\nوتقع قبة المعراج داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك إلى الشمال الغربي من قبة الصخرة. وشيدت عام 1200م بأمر من الأمير عز الدين الزنجلي والي القدس في عهد السلطان العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب. وتم تشييدها لتخليد ذكرى المعراج، وتذكر بعض المصادر أن هذه القبة بنيت مكان قبة أخرى قديمة تعود إلى عهد عبد الملك بن مروان، وقد أشار إلى وجودها الرحالة ناصر بن خسرو قبل استيلاء الصليبيين على المدينة وهدمهم لها.\n\nويعتبر التصميم المعماري للقبة فريد من نوعه وهو مثمن الشكل مثل قبة الصخرة المجاورة له، ونجد في كل ركن من أركان المثمن أربعة أعمدة مدمجة إلا الجهة الجنوبية التي بها عمودان ليصبح مجموع الأعمدة ثلاثين عمودا، وتحمل الأعمدة ثمانية عقود مدببة سدت فتحاتها بالرخام فيما عدا ضلع واحد يقع في الناحية الجنوبية، وقد شيد به محراب حجري تبرز حنيته من الخارج، ويقابله ضلع آخر في الناحية الشمالية فتح به باب الدخول إلى القبة، وقد شيدت خوذة القبة بعد تحويل أعلى المثمن إلى دائرة، وتتميز هذه القبة بوجود قبة أخرى صغيرة فوقها، بما يشبه التاج فوق رأسها.\nوالقبة تستخدم اليوم من قبل لجنة الإعمار في المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nقبة الميزان\n\nتقع قبة الميزان في الركن الجنوبي من صحن الصخرة المشرفة، ملاصقة للبائكة الجنوبية، والمعلوم أن بوائك الأقصى تعرف أيضا بالموازيين، ومنه جاءت تسمية القبة باسم قبة الميزان. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى الفترة المملوكية على يد قاضي القضاة برهان الدين بن جماعة الذي أنشأها عام 1388م، قبة الميزان وتعرف أيضا بمنبر برهان الدين وذلك لأنها على هيئة منبر فوقه قبة.\nوقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين أن المنبر في بداية عهده كان عبارة عن منبر خشبي جميل في شكله، وفي عام 1388م أعيد بناء المنبر بالكامل من الحجر على النمط الهندسي الذي تشتهر به المنابر المملوكية المعروفة بنقشها وجمالها.\nويتكون هذا المنبر من بناء حجري، وله مدخل يقوم في أعلاه عقد يرتكز على عمودين صغيرين من الرخام. ويُصعد منه إلى درجات قليلة تؤدي إلى دكة حجرية معدة لجلوس الخطيب، وتقوم فوقها قبة لطيفة صغيرة، وقد أقيمت على أعمدة رخامية جميلة الشكل.\nوقدد جُدّد المنبر مرتين الأولى في عهد السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد بن محمود الثاني عام 1843م، والثانية في أواخر سنة 2000م، على يد مجموعة من الطلبة الإيطاليين، وذلك عن طريق دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nقبة يوسف آغا\nتقع القبة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك على الجانب الغربي من الجامع القبلي، وتم تشييدها عام 1092هـ (1681م) بأمر من يوسف آغا الوالي العثماني على القدس، وقد كانت على ما يبدو مخصصة للعبادة على مقربة من الجامع القبلي. وهي تغطي هذه القبة مساحة مربعة شيدت بمداميك من الأحجار المشذبة وقد فتحت ثلاثة جدران بكاملها تقريباً على ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وذلك باستخدام عقود مدببة بينما شيد المحراب في الجدار الجنوبي، وهو محراب مجوف بسيط.\n\nقبة النبي موسى\n\nوتقع قبة النبي موسى داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك على بالقرب من البائكة الجنوبية الغربية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1250م في عهد الملك الصالح نجم الدين أيوب بن الملك الكامل الأيوبي، ويبدو من تصميمها أنها كانت مخصصة لتعبد أمراء الأيوبيين عند زيارتهم للقدس أو لبعض المشاهير والشيوخ بعد ذلك.\nوالقبة هي مربعة الجدران فتحت بها نوافذ للإضاءة ، ويقع المدخل في الضلع الشمالي المواجه لجدار القبة ومن ناحية الشكل فقد تم تحويل المربع إلى مثمن، وقد فتحت في أضلاع المثمن نوافذ للإضاءة ، وبعد ذلك تم تشييد خوذة القبة المثمنة.\n\nقبة النبي\nوتقع قبة النبي داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك غرب قبة الصخرة، بجوار قبة المعراج ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1538 بأمر من محمد بك والي غزة والقدس الشريف ثم أعاد تشييدها السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الأول عام 1845، أما عن سبب تسميتها فيعتقد بعض المؤرخين أنها بنيت في المكان الذي صلى فيه النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم إماما بالأنبياء والملائكة في ليلة الإسراء، حيث تشير بعض النصوص إلى أنّ المعراج كان على يمين الصخرة، ويقول الباحثون إن هذا سبب تعدد القباب على يمين قبة الصخرة.\nكما يعتبر محراب النبي هو أول ما تم تشييده في هذه القبة، وقد أمر بتشييدها محمد بك والي غزة والقدس الشريف في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني في عام 1538م، والمحراب هو على هيئة مستطيل رخامي لا يرتفع عن الأرض كثيراً، وفي نهايته شكل ثلاثي الأضلاع أكثر ارتفاعاً من بقية المستطيل.\nوفي عام 1845م، قام السلطان عبد المجيد الثاني بتشييد قبة فوق هذا المحراب ومنها جاءت تسميتها، وهي مثمنة الشكل قاعدتها من ثمانية أعمدة رخامية رشيقة تحمل ثمانية من العقود الحجرية المدببة.\n\nقبة يوسف\n\nتقع قبة يوسف داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك جنوب قبة الصخرة، ويعود تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني عام 1681 م. وسميت القبة بقبة يوسف تيمناً وتذكاراً بيوسف بن أيوب المعروف بالناصر صلاح الدين الأيوبي. وتقوم هذه القبة على بناء مربع تتألف قاعدته من عمودين رخاميين رشيقين وجدار في ناحية القِبلة، ومن ثم فهي عبارة عن ثلاثة عقود مفتوحة وجدار مسدود وبوسط هذا الجدار حنية صغيرة تشبه المحاريب المجوفة وبداخلها نص على لوح يحمل اسم صلاح الدين الأيوبي، وهذا اللوح مأخوذ من برج بناه السلطان صلاح الدين على سور المدينة عند الخندق. وخلف هذا النص من الخارج يوجد نص أخر يبين أعمال البناء التي أجريت في العهد العثماني، واسم المشرف على البناء وهو علي أغا يوسف أغا.\n\nقبة عشاق النبي\nتقع قبة عشاق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، في الركن الجنوب الشرقي من باب العتم، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1817م في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الثاني، ولهذا السبب تعرف باسم إيوان السلطان محمود الثاني. وأما اسمها الحالي فمصدره اعتياد بعض شيوخ الصوفية الاجتماع للذكر تحتها.\nوهي عبارة عن مبنـى مربع الشكل طول ضلعه 7 أمتار، قائم على أربع دعائم ركنيّة تعلوها أربعة عقود مدببة تعلوها قبـة ضحلة. والمبنى مفتوح الجوانب، وبه محراب حجري مجوف جميل أضيف في فترة لاحقة في وسط الجهة الجنوبيّة. ويصعد إلـى صحن هذه القبة من خلال ثلاث درجات من الجهتين الغربية والشرقيّة، وأرضيتها مبلّطة بالحجر، وعلى حافتها من الجهة الشمالية عمودان نائمان يبدو أنّهما وضعا في زمن متأخّر كدربزين\n\nقبة الشيخ الخليلي.\n\nتقع قبة الشيخ الخليلي في صحن الصخرة، في جزء الشمال الغربي من قبة الصخرة، وتفصل بينهما قبتا النبي والمعراج. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني عام 1700م، وعرفت باسم شيخ صوفي كان يؤمها ويتعبد فيها، وتعرف كذلك بقبة بخ بخ، ومصلى الخضر، ومسجد النبي.\nوالقبة هي عبارة عن مبنى مربّع مقام على أربعة أركان، تعلوه قبّة ضحلة على الطراز العثماني، وفي الجهات الأربع ثماني نوافذ مستطيلة الشكل. حيث يقع في واجهة المبنى الشرقيّة باب صغير يعلوه نقش يحمل اسم وتاريخ المبنى. ويوجد بداخل هذه القبة من جهة القبلة محراب من حجر كلسي ملكي فيه حنية حجريّة، وتحت مبنى قبة الخليلي يوجد مبنى سفلي يسمى مغارة الأرواح، يتوصل إليه من خلال سلم حجري مقطوع من الصخر، وهذا الكهف قليل التهوية عديم النور ولا يستعمل.\nوتستعمل القبة اليوم كمكتب للجنة إعمار المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nقبة النبي عيسى/ مهد النبي عيسى\n\nوتقع قبة النبي عيسى والمسماة أيضا مهد النبي عيسى عند الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية لسور القدس وسور المسجد الأقصى، وتم تشييده لتخليد ذكرى النبي عيسى، ورغم التجديدات التي لحقت به على مر العصور فهو يحتفظ بطابعه الأصلي والأساسي والذي ورد في أوصاف المؤرخين والرحالة الذين عاينوا هذا المكان المعروف باسم مهد النبي عيسى ومسجده. وجددت القبة في العهد العثماني على نفس طرازها القديم وهي محمولة على أربعة عقود مدببة تستند بدورها على أربعة أعمدة رخامية رشيقة، وتحت هذه القبة يوجد حوض حجري يسمى مهد النبي عيسى، وأمام هذا الحوض يوجد محراب حجري مجوف.\n\nالماَذن\nللمسجد أربع مآذن وهي:\n\nمئذنة باب المغاربة/ المئذنة الفخارية\n\nتعتبر مئذنة المغاربة وتسمى أيضا المئذنة الفخارية أول مئذنة تشيد في المسجد في عام 1278م، وتقع على الزاوية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى، وهي قريبة من باب المغاربة وتحديدا فوق الطرف الشمالي الغربي لجامع النساء الواقع داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، بناء على أوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين. وسميت بالفخارية نسبة إلى فخر الدين الخليلي، والد القاضي شرف الدين عبد الرحمن الذي أشرف على بناء المبنى. وتم بناء المئذنة على الطراز السوري التقليدي، مع وجود قاعدة مربعة الشكل وعامود، مقسوم إلى ثلاثة طوابق ويقع فوق الطابقين الأولين شرفة المؤذن. ويحيط الشرفة غرفة مربعة التي تنتهي بدورها إلى قبة حجرية مغطاة بالرصاص.\n\nمئذنة باب الغوانمة\nوتعتبر مئذنة الغوانمة المئذنة الثانية التي تشيد في المسجد، وقد بناها المهندس المعماري القاضي شرف الدين الخليلي مابين 1297–98م،  وهي أيضا بناء على الأوامر من بناء على أوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين، وتقع في الركن الشمالي الغربي من الحرم القدسي الشريف بالقرب من باب الغوانمة . وتتكون من ستة طوابق عالية ونوازل، وهي أطول مئذنة في الحرم القدسي. وبرج المئذنة كلياً هو مصنوع من الحجر تقريبا، بصرف النظر عن القبة الخشبية التي تقع على شرفة المؤذن، وبقيت مئذنة باب الغوانمة تقريبا بمنأى عن الهزات الأرضية بسبب هيكلها الراسخ. والمئذنة تنقسم إلى عدة طوابق مشكلة من الحجارة .ويعتبر الطابقين الأولين أوسع من بقية الطوابق، ويشكلا قاعدة البرج. ويعلو كلا من أربعة الطوابق الباقية عمود أسطواني وقبة بصلية الشكل (منتفخة). أما الدرج فهو يقع خارج الطابقين الأول والثاني، ولكنه يصبح على شكل لولبي داخل الطابق الثالث حتى تصل إلى شرفة المؤذن.\n\nمئذنة باب السلسلة\n\nتعتبر مئذنة السلسلة المئذنة الثالثة التي تشيد في المسجد وذلك في عام 1329 م بناء على أوامر الأمير سيف الدين تنكز الناصري الحاكم المملوكي على الشام، في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون وذلك وفق ما جاء بالنقش التذكاري الموجود في الجهة الشرقية من قاعدة المئذنة:\n\nوتقع مئذنة باب السلسلة على الحدود الغربية من المسجد الأقصى شمال باب السلسلة وتسمى أيضا بمنارة المحكمة. وربما تكون هذه المئذنة حلت محل المئذنة الأموية في وقت سابق، ومبنى البرج هو مربع الشكل ومصنوع بالكامل من الحجارة. ومنذ القرن 16، فقد كان التقليد المتبع هو اختيار أفضل مؤذن في المدينة وتم تعيينه في هذه المئذنة للنداء إلى كل من الصلوات الخمس، ويتم رفع الآذان من هذه المئذنة أولا، لإعطاء الإشارة لمؤذني المساجد الأخرى في جميع أنحاء القدس على أن تحذو حذوها.\n\nمئذنة باب الأسباط/ مئذنة الصلاحية\n\nتعتبر مئذنة الأسباط المئذنة الرابعة للمسجد وآخر مئذنة تشيده عليه وذلك في سنة 1367 كما أنها تسمى أيضا بمئذنة الصلاحية لكونها واقعة في جهة المدرسة الصلاحية الواقعة خارج المسجد الأقصى المبارك،  وتقع هذه المئذنة في الجهة الشمالية للحرم القدسي الشريف، بين باب حطة وباب الأسباط، وقد بُنِيَت بأمر من الأمير سيف الدين قطلوبغا وهو ناظر الحرمين الشريفين في عهد السلطان المملوكي الأشرف شعبان، وذلك وفقاً للنقش التذكاري الذي كان موجوداً عليها:\n\nومئذنة الأسباط هي عبارة برج حجر أسطواني (بني في وقت لاحق في العهد العثمانيين) وليست مربعة المآذن الأخرى، ويبدأ برج المئذنة صعودا من قاعدة مستطيلة تعود للعهد المملوكي. ويضيق فوق شرفة المؤذن، وتنتشر فيه نوافذ دائرية، وتنتهي بقبة بصلية الشكل (منتفخة). وقد أعيد بناء القبة بعد وقوع زلزال وادي الأردن عام 1927.\nومن الجدير للذكر أنه لا وجود للمآذن في الجزء الشرقي من المسجد الآقصى المبارك. ومع ذلك، أعلن عبد الله الثاني ملك الأردن في عام 2006 عن نيته لبناء المئذنة الخامسة لتطل على جبل الزيتون. ومن المقرر أن تحمل المئذنة اسم حسين ملك الأردن كما أنها سيكون أطول مبنى في البلدة القديمة من القدس.\n\nأبواب المسجد الأقصى\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على خمسة عشر باب منها ما هو مستعمل (مفتوح) في أيامنا هذه وعددها عشرة، والبقية مغلقة منذ زمن بعيد لأسباب عديدة،: وتقع جميع الأبواب المفتوحة في الجهة الشمالية والغربية من المسجد، وهي في الوقت نفسه تقع ضمن أسوار المسجد الأقصى.\nأبواب المسجد الأقصى تشترك جميعها في أنها أبواب خشبية مكونة من دفة أو دفتين، وتشتمل على خوخة «فتحة» لتنظيم المرور استعملت لمرور المتأخرين بعد إغلاق الأبواب عند الغروب.\nوقد برع المسلمون في الأعمال الخشبية وتفننوا في زخرفتها وإظهار تفصيلاتها والعناية بدقائقها كالمزاليج والمفاتيح والمفاصل وغيرها من الأمور التي تؤكد.\n\nالأبواب المفتوحة\nباب الأسباط/ باب الأُسود\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب الأًسود نسبة للأسدين المنحوتين على جانبي الباب ، ويقع في الزاوية الشمالية الشرقية للمسجد الأقصى، ويعود تاريخ تجديد بنائه إلى الفترة الأيوبية، كما تم تجديد الباب في الفترة المملوكية في 1367م.\nوالواجهة الجنوبية لهذا الباب هي مدخل بارتفاع 4 أمتار تقريباً وفتحة مستطيلة بعقد مدبب، وفي زاوية المدخل توجد دركاة مربعة الشكل تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وللباب دفتان من الخشب يبدو أنهما حديثتا العهد، ويوجد في أحد الدفتين خوخة (مدخل صغير) تسمح بدخول شخص واحد فقط، ويعد مدخل الدركاة أحد أقواس الرواق الشمالي الضخمة المدببة. أما الواجهة الشمالية للباب فهي فتحة مستطيلة لقوس مدبب عرضه 2 متر تقريباً وارتفاعه 4 أمتار كما أن المدخل مسقوف بقنطرة مدببة عرضها حوالي 1 متر.\n\nباب حطة\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى وتحديدا ضمن الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الشمالي. وقد تم تجديده عام 1220م في الفترة الأيوبية في عهد شرف الدين أبو المنصور عيسى الأيوبي. وتتكون واجهته الجنوبية التي تقع داخل المسجد من باب مستطيل ذي عقد حجري موتور، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في إحداها خوخة صغيرة، ويتقدمه دركاة وهي جزء من الرواق الشمالي أيضا مدخلها عبارة عن عقد حجري مدبب يعلوه صف من الكوابل الحجرية عددها تسعة كوابل، يزداد قطرها كلما ارتفعنا لأعلى الباب، وبين فتحة الباب وهذه الكوابل يوجد ثلاثة زخارف دائرية بارزة على مركز الفتحة وأطرافها.\n\nباب العتم\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب فيصل نسبة إلى الملك فيصل الأول. وقد جدد بناء هذا الباب في الفترة الأيوبية، في أيام الملك المعظم ابن الملك العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب سنة 1213، وذلك عند تجديد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى. كما أنه يعرف ولهذا الباب عدة أسماء فهو باب الدوددارية، وباب الملك فيصل، وباب شرف الأنبياء.\nوتتكون واجهة الباب الجنوبية من فتحة ارتفاعها 4 أمتار، وعليها باب خشبي من دفتين يتقدمه من الجهة الجنوبية دركاة تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وهي مغطاة بعقد صليبي ومدخل الدركاة عبارة عن قوس مدبب ضخم، وهو يقع ضمن سلسلة أقواس الرواق الشمالي\n\nباب الغوانمة/باب الوليد\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويعتبر أول باب يشيد في الجدار الغربي ابتداء من الناحية الشمالية، وقد أنشئ في العهد الأموي، وعرف آنذاك باسم باب الوليد نسبة إلى الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد جدد الباب عام 1307م وذلك عند إنشاء الرواق الغربي للمسجد في عهد قلاوون، والباب مستطيل الشكل نسبة عرضه إلى ارتفاعه لباقي أبواب المسجد تعد قليلة، وعلى المدخل باب خشبي من دفة واحدة من الخشب يوجد به خوخة صغيرة لتمييزها من الباب ويتقدم الباب من الجهة الشرقية دهليز معقود بعقد برميلي واجهته عقد حجري مدبب، يرقى للباب بواسطة ثماني درجات عن ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبلطة، وبجانب الباب عقد مدبب آخر لكنه مغلق.\n\nباب الناظر\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، يقع في الجدار الغربي لساحة المسجد الأقصى، وقد جدد بناؤه في الفترة الأيوبية سنة 1203م في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى بن أحمد، وله عدة أسماء أخرى متداولة مثل باب الحبس لقربه من الحبس أيام العثمانيين، وباب المجلس .\nويتقدم الباب من الجهة الشرقية دركاة مربعة تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق الغربي، وتغطيها قبة مرفوعة على ثلاثة صفوف من المقرنصات، أما فتحة الباب فهي عبارة عن مستطيل ضخم ارتفاعه 4,5 متر وعرضه 2 متر، ويعلو الفتحة المستطيلة قوس موتور تعلوه زخرفة على شكل رواق صغير، وتنفصل مساحة الدركاة عن بقية الرواق بأقواس مدببة. وعلى الدعامة التي تقع على عقد المدخل المدبب والعقد المجاور له من عقود الرواق يوجد نقش حجري، ويبين النقش تاريخ البناء والسلطان الذي جدد في عهده. ويتقدم الباب قنطرة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع يؤدي إلى طريق باب الناظر المؤدية إلى طريق الواد. وفي الجهة الجنوبية من القنطرة مدخل يؤدي بواسطة درج حجري، وفي الجهة الشمالية مدخل المدرسة المنجكية.\n\nباب الحديد\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية للمسجد الأقصى، وهو أحد المداخل المتفرعة عن طريق باب العمود. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى الأمير أرغون الذي يعني باللغة التركية الـحديد، وقد جدد في عهده بين سنتي 755هـــ و758هـــ/1354-1357م، والباب عبارة عن فتحة مستطيلة بعقد، ويتقدمه من الواجهة الشرقية دركاة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع، وباب الحديد على شكل قوس حذوي مدبب على جانبيه مداميك حجرية بارتفاع 60 سم تقريبا، ويعلو الباب واجهة تعود للفترة المملوكية، وتتوسط هذه الواجهة نافذة معقودة بعقد مدبب زخرف بخطوط متعرجة.\n\nباب القطانين\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الجهة الغربية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، ويعد من الأبواب الرئيسية الهامة والجميلة المؤدية للمسجد، ويؤدي هذا الباب إلى سوق القطانين ومنه جاءت تسميته، وقد جدد هذا الباب في عهد السلطان قلاوون على يد الأمير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1336م، وهذا واضح من خلال نقش يوجد في أعلى المدخل من الجهة الشرقية المطلة على ساحة الحرم القدسي، وقد أزيلت على يد المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى سنة 1922م. والواجهة الشمالية للباب مكونة من قوصرة مدخل تنخفض عن مستوى الساحة بتسع درجات تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، وهذه القوصرة واسعة حيث يبلغ عرضها 7 أمتار تقريباً وارتفاعها 13 متر، وهي مغطاة بنصف قبة من الحجر. وأما المفتاح فهو أسود اللون ونصف القبة مقامة على خمسة صفوف من المقرنصات، وفتحة الباب مستطيلة بارتفاع 4 أمتار وعرض 2,5 متر ويعلو الباب عتب حجري مستقيم وهو مكون من ثلاث قطع خارجية.\n\nباب المطهرة\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، ويؤدي إلى المتوضأ (مكان الوضوء)، ولذلك سمي بباب المطهرة، وقد جدد في العهد المملوكي سنة 1266م، على يد الأمير آدغيدي، وهناك من يرى انه جدد سنة 1267م على يد الأمير علاء الدين البصيري، وتتكون الواجهة الغربية للباب من عقد حجري مدبب، وهو يخلو من أي عنصر معماري مزخرف، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين في إحداها خوخة صغيرة والباب بارتفاع 3,5 متر تقريبا، وعرضه 2 متر، أما الجهة الشرقية من الباب فهو فتحة مستطيلة في عقد حجري موتور عليه مدماكان من الحجر، ويتقدمه دركاة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع، وهي جزء من الرواق الغربي.\n\nباب السلسلة والسكينة/باب النبي داود\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب النبي داود، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية من ساحة المسجد الأقصى ضمن الرواق الغربي، ويعد من الأبواب الرئيسية المؤدية إلى المسجد الأقصى، وهناك من يعتبرهما بابين منفصلين وليس باباً واحداً بمدخلين. أما الباب الأول والمسمى بباب السلسلة، فهو مفتوح ويؤمه الزائرون للمسجد الأقصى، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم للاعتقاد بوجود سلسلة كانت معلقة فيه أو ربما لوجود علاقة ما تربطه بقبة السلسلة، أما الآخر فهو باب السكينة، وهو يقع شمال باب السلسلة، وهو ملاصق له، والباب لا يفتح إلا في حالات الطوارئ والضرورة القصوى، وقد جدد هذان البابان في الفترة الأيوبية سنة 1203م، في عهد السلطان الملك العادل سيف الدين أبو بكر، وهناك من يرى أنه في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى، ويتكون المدخل من بابين متسعين بارتفاع 4,5 متر وعرض 2 متر والفتحة مستطيلة بقوس موتور عليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في إحداهما خوخة صغيرة لتنظيم المرور إلى المسجد الأقصى.\n\nباب المغاربة\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الزاوية الغربية الجنوبية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، وسمي بباب المغاربة لأنه يوصل إلى حارة المغاربة غرب الأقصى، ويعرف أيضا بباب البراق، وباب النبي، حيث يعتقد أن الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم دخل منه إلى المسجد الأقصى المبارك ليلة الإسراء والمعراج، كما يعتقد بعض المؤرخين أن عمر بن الخطاب دخل منه إلى الأقصى أيضا بعد الفتح، حيث أورد ابن كثير: \n\nوقد أعيد بناؤه في الفترة المملوكية في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون الذي قام بإنشاء الأروقة الغربية ما بين سنة 1305م- 1336م،  والباب من الواجهة الغربية معقود بعقد مدبب بسيط التكوين. أما الجهة الشرقية فهو عبارة عن فتحة مستطيلة ، وهو على شكل قوس موتور عليه باب خشبي بدفة واحدة، ويفضي من الجهة الشرقية إلى دركاة تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق، وهي مؤلفة من عقدين حجريين، وتقوم على ثلاث دعامات، وعلى مركز الدعامة الوسطى زخرفة حجرية بشكل مربع في وسطه دائرة، ويغطيها قبوان متقاطعان، ويجاور الباب من الجهة الشمالية مسجد صغير يسمى مسجد البراق.\n\nالأبواب المغلقة\nالباب المنفرد\nهو أحد المداخل الجنوبية المغلقة في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من سور مدينة القدس والمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وقد أغلق بطريقة متقنة للغاية حتى لا يظهر للباب أي أثر من داخل أسوار المسجد، وقد سمي بباب الوحيد المفرد والمغلق الذي يظهر للعيان، وقد اشتهر عند المؤرخين العرب باسم باب العين لأنه يؤدي إلى عين سلوان.\n\nالباب الثلاثي\n\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، وهو عبارة عن ثلاث بوابات متجاورة تقع في الجدار الجنوبي من سور المسجد الأقصى على بعد 50 متراً من البوابة المفردة، و80 متراً من البوابة المزدوجة. وهذه البوابات شامخة العلو بجوار بعضها البعض، اتساع كلٍ منها 13 قدماً، وقد اشتهرت عند المؤرخين والكتّاب العرب باسم بوابات محراب مريم أو باب محراب مريم، وهذا الباب قديم العهد يعود إلى عصر أدريانوس باني القدس سنة 135م، وهو مغلق منذ أوائل القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nالباب المزدوج\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، وهو باب بمدخلين مزدوجين مغلقين، يقع في الجهة الجنوبية من سور الجامع الأقصى خلف منبر الإمام تماماً حيث يؤدي إلى أسفل الجامع الأقصى عبر ممداخل مائلة، ويبعد عن الباب الثلاثي مسافة 80 متراً. وهو باب قديم جداً يعود تاريخه إلى البيزنطيين، ومن أسماء هذا الباب: بوابة خلدة، بوابة الأقصى القديمة، وبوابة النبي.\n\nالباب الذهبي (باب الرحمة والتوبة)\n\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، ويكاد أن يكون الباب الوحيد في الجهة الشرقية الشمالية للسور لولا وجود باب صغير يسمى باب الجنائز، وهناك من يرى ان الباب الذهبي أسس قبل الفتح الإسلامي للمدينة، إلا أنه لم يبق من ذلك البناء سوى الموقع، وربما لمسات من التصميم العام، وقد أعيد بناؤه مرات عديدة بعد ذلك، منها ما كان بعد جلاء الفرس عن القدس ودخول الإمبراطور هرقل، وأما البناء الأخير فقد تم في العصر الأموي، والباب الذهبي في حقيقة الأمر مكون من بابين الرحمة والتوبة، أما اغلاقهما فيرجح أنهما أغلقا في عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعد إخراجه الصليبيين من القدس، وذلك لأسباب أمنية، وهناك من يقول أنهما أغلقا بأمر الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب للأسباب نفسها، ومهما يكن فان الحصيلة هي أن هذه الابواب مغلقة منذ زمن ولم تفتح إلى يومنا هذا. أما اسم الباب الذهبي فقد أطلقه عليه المسيحيون لاعتقادهم أن السيد المسيح سيمر من خلاله عند رجوعه، وهم يؤمنون بأنه كان قد دخل منه فعلاً في أحد الشعانين.\n\nباب الجنائز\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، يقع في السور الشرقي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك يؤدي إلى المقبرة المجاورة بعد الصلاة عليها في المسجد الأقصى، وهو باب صغير لا يستخدم حاليا. تظهر آثاره من خلف الخزائن الحديدية التي يستعملها حراس باب الأسباط في المكان، لكن المرجح أنه كان يقع جنوبي باب الرحمة. وعلى أي حال، فيحتمل أن يكون قد وجد في التاريخ بابان بهذا الاسم، حيث يمكن أن يكون الباب قديماً كان جنوب باب الرحمة، ومن ثم تحول في فترات متأخرة (على الأصح الفترة العثمانية) إلى قرب باب الأسباط.\nكان هذا الباب يستخدم لإخراج الجنائز من المسجد الأقصى المبارك إلى مقبرة الرحمة المحاذية للسور الشرقي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وأغلق على الأرجح بأمر من السلطان صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعد تحرير القدس في 583هـ - 1187م، لحماية المسجد والمدينة من أي غزو محتمل.\n\nالمساطب\nالأروقة\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على رواقان يمتدان من جهته الشمالية والغربية وهما\n\nالرواق الغربي\nوهو ممر مسقوف يتكون من 55 عقدا، ويمتد بطول الواجهة الغربية للمسجد الأقصى، بنى على عدة مراحل في العهد المملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1307 و1336م بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافة المعالم الموجودة في المنطقة الغربية للمسجد المبارك.\n\nالرواق الشمالي\nهو ممر مسقوف بطول الواجهة الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى، وقد بني على عدة مراحل في العهدين الأيوبي والمملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1213 و1367م، بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافة المعالم الموجودة في المنطقة الشمالية للمسجد.\nواليوم يتكون الرواق من عدة مدارس، ولم يتبق أي جزء منه.\n\nالمدارس\nتتميز بيوت العبادة في الإسلام بكونها دور عبادة وعلم في آنٍ واحد، حيث نجد أن الكثير من المساجد تعتبر جامعا وجامعة في آن واحد. ولذا حرص المسلمون منذ العصور الإسلامية المبكرة على إقامة المدارس في المسجد الأقصى المبارك، ووقفها على الشيوخ والطلاب الذين يرابطون في هذا الموضع الشريف طلبا للعلم والثواب. وتنتشر مدارس المسجد الأقصى المبارك في الرواقين الشمالي والغربي للمسجد، وبعضها يمتد خارج سور المسجد المبارك ملاصقا له، وكلها تعتبر جزءا لا يتجزأ من الأقصى الشريف، ونذكر منها \n\nمدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع هذه المدارس داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين بابي حطة وفيصل. أنشئت في مطلع الثمانينات من القرن العشرين. ولها فروع عديدة بعضها خارج المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسة البكرية/الدوادارية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع على الحد الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك من الخارج إلى الشمال من مدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية، وهي مدرسة كبيرة من مدارس البلدة القديمة، وتمتد غربا حتى المدرسة العمرية، وكانت تعرف حتى أواسط القرن العشرين باسم «المدرسة الدوادارية»، نسبة لبانيها الأمير علم الدين سنجر الدوادار، سنة 695هـ -1295م.\nوقد ظلت المدرسة البكرية تستعمل كمدرسة أكاديمية ابتدائية حتى مجيء الاحتلال الصهيوني حيث حول الجزء الأكبر منها إلى مدرسة للمعاقين تخضع لإدارة دائرة المعارف التابعة لبلدية القدس المحتلة منذ عام 1967م.\nثانوية الأقصى الشرعية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، غلب عليها هذا الاسم لأنها كانت عند إنشائها في مطلع الثمانينيات من القرن العشرين ثانوية محضة، واليوم هي عبارة عن مدرسة إعدادية وثانوية لطلبة الفرع الشرعي من الذكور.\n\nالمدرسة الغادرية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عهد السلطان المملوكي برسباي عام 1432م على يد مصر خاتون زوجة الأمير ناصر الدين بن دلغادر، ومنه جاءت تسميتها.\nتم تجديدها من قبل دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية، لكن سلطات الاحتلال منعت تتمة السقف، ولا زالت بلا سقف حتى اليوم.\nوالحقيقة أن هذا هو حال معظم مدارس الأقصى اليوم، التي أهملت بسبب مزاعم الصهاينة أنها تحوي آثارا يهودية، مما أدى إلى إهمال الكثير من المدارس القديمة وإغلاقها، أو تأجيرها للسكنى.\n\nالمدرسة الباسطية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع فوق مدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية الواقعة داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك بين بابي حطة والعتم. ويعتبر شمس الدين محمد الهروي شيخ الصلاحية وناظر الحرمين في العهد المملوكي أول من بدأ بتشييدها، ولكن أدركته المنية قبل عمارتها، فعمرها القاضي زين الدين عبد الباسط بن خليل الدمشقي، سنة 835هـ -1431م، وحملت المدرسة اسمه.\nوقد كانت المدرسة الباسطية مدرسة عظيمة اشتهرت في أرجاء العالم الإسلامي، حيث تخرج منها العديد من العلماء ودرس فيها العديد من الحفاظ ورواة الحديث والأطباء وعلماء الفلك والرياضيات. وهي اليوم عبارة عن قسمين: واحد مأهول بجماعة من آل جار الله، والآخر يستعمل مقرا للمدرسة البكرية.\n\nالمدرسة الأمينية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع غربي باب العتم في السور الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى، ويحدها من الشرق الطريق الداخل إلى باب العتم، ومن الشمال طريق المجاهدين، ومن الغرب المدرسة الفارسية، ومن الجنوب ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبارك. وهي مؤلفة من أربعة طوابق. وتسمى أيضا دار الإمام، حيث درّس فيها أجداد عائلة الإمام واتخذت دارا لسكناهم.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 730هـ -1329م في العهد المملوكي على يد الوزير أمين الدين عبد الله بن غانم، الذي كان أحد المسؤولين في جيش الناصر محمد بن قلاوون ويعرف بأمين الملك، فعرفت باسمه، وقد جرى ترميمها في العهد العثماني.\nوتعتبر هذه المدرسة من أجمل المدارس المطلة على ساحات المسجد الأقصى، ومن أهمها\n\nالمدرسة الملكية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع في الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك بين المدرسة الفارسية شرقا، والمدرسة الأسعردية غربا، ومدخلها مشترك مع الأسعردية. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 741هـ - 1340م، في عهد السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، وأوقفها الحاج آل الملك الجوكندار، بعد بنائها بأربع سنوات. والمدرسة تحمل معظم العناصر المعمارية المميزة للعهد المملوكي، وخاصة تبادل ألوان الحجارة التي بنيت بها بين الأحمر والأبيض.\nوالمدرسة عبارة عن طابقين، مأهولة حاليا على سبيل السكنى من قبل عائلة الدجاني، إذ استأجروها من دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nالمدرسة الأسعردية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى، أوقفها التاجر مجد الدين الأسعردي عام 770هـ - 1368م، فعرفت باسمه.\nوهذه المدرسة واسعة تتكون من طابقين يتوسطهما صحن مكشوف مربع الشكل، ويحيط بالصحن عدد من الخلاوي الصغيرة ذات المداخل المعقودة. تتميز بوجود ثلاث قباب فوقها من جهاتها الشرقية والوسطى والغربية،\nوقد قام المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني بترميمها، ونقل إليها دار كتب المسجد الأقصى قبل أن تتحول إلى دار لسكنى آل البيطار حاليا.\n\nالمدرسة المنجكية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع فوق باب الناظر في الرواق الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، ويقع فوقها قبة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي في عام 763هـ - 1361م على يد الأمير يوسف الدين منجك. وهي عبارة عن طابقين يصعد إليهما بدرجات.\nوالمدرسة تستخدم اليوم كمقر لدائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية العامة بالقدس، التابعة لوزارة الأوقاف الأردنية، والمكلفة إدارة شئون المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسة العثمانية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع على السور الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك جنوبي باب المطهرة، أوقفتها أصفهان شاه خاتون بنت محمود العثمانية سنة 840هـ-1437م، في عهد السلطان الأشرف برسباي.\nوالمدرسة العثمانية عبارة عن طابقين جلهما خارج المسجد الأقصى، ومسجد المدرسة بمستوى ساحات المسجد الأقصى ويطل عليها، وقد استولى عليه اليهود وأغلقوا شباكه بالحجارة. أما المدرسة فتستخدم حاليا لسكنى العائلات المسلمة.\n\nالمدرسة الأشرفية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع في الجهة الغربية من المسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين المدرسة العثمانية شمالا ومئذنة باب السلسلة جنوبا. وتسمى أيضا السلطانية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 875هـ -1470م، على يد الأمير حسن الظاهري لكن البناء لم يعجب السلطان الأشرف قايتباي عندما رآه أثناء زيارته للقدس، فأمر بهدمها، وأعيد بناءها عام 885/884هـ - 1480/1479م.\n\nوالمدرسة تنقسم إلى قسمان: حيث يقع القسم الأول داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، والآخر خارجه، والذي داخله عبارة عن طابقين: الأول كان مصلى الحنابلة في المسجد الأقصى المبارك في أصله، ويستخدم جزء منه الآن كمقر لقسم المخطوطات التابع لمكتبة المسجد الأقصى المبارك ومقرها الرئيسي في جامع النساء، والجزء الأكبر منه هو مقر ثانوية الأقصى الشرعية للبنات، وفيه أيضا قبر الشيخ الخليلي، وبعض الأجزاء الصغيرة التي تستخدم دوراً للسكن.\nأما الطابق الثاني، فمتهدم السقف، وهو مسجد المدرسة. ويرجع انهدام هذا الجزء لزلزال وقع في عام 1346هـ - 1927م.\n\nومبنى المدرسة جميل البناء، حيث اشتملت عناصره على صفوف الحجارة المشهرة الملونة باللونين الأحمر والأبيض، وامتازت بغناها بالعناصر المعمارية والزخرفية. وصفها مجير الدين الحنبلي بأنها \nالمدرسة التنكزية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع بين باب السلسلة شمالا وحائط البراق المحتل جنوبا، ويقع جزء منها داخل الرواق الغربي للمسجد الأقصى.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 729هـ -1328م على يد نائب الشام الأمير سيف الدين تنكز، ونسبت إليه.\nوقد كانت مدرسة عظيمة وداراً للحديث، وفي عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، اتخذت مقراً للقضاء والحكم. وفي العهد العثماني، تحولت المدرسة إلى محكمة شرعية، ومن هنا صارت تعرف باسم المحكمة، وبقيت كذلك حتى أوائل عهد الانتداب البريطاني، فاتخذها المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى دارا للسكنى، ثم عادت بعد ذلك مدرسة لتعليم الفقه الإسلامي.\nوفي عام 1389هـ -1969م، صادرتها سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني، ثم حولتها إلى موقع عسكري لما يعرف بحرس الحدود، حيث يشرفون منها على المسجد الأقصى، ويتدخلون لملاحقة المصلين عند اندلاع المظاهرات المنددة بالاحتلال.\n\nالمدرسة العمرية (المحدثية- الصبيبية- الجاولية)\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتطل على الحد الشمالي الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وتعتبر جزءا منه. وهي مدرسة تاريخية كبيرة وواسعة تبلغ مساحتها 4 دونمات، وتتكون من ثلاثة مدارس مملوكية سابقة:\n\nالمحدثية\nالصبيبية\nالجاولية\nبالإضافة إلى عدد من الغرف والزوايا المختلفة التي كانت قائمة في عهود سابقة. وكانت المدرستان الأخيرتان قد استعملتا سكنا لنواب القدس، ومقرا للحكم العثماني، ثم مدرسة باسم روضة المعارف، ثم مقرا لشرطة الاحتلال البريطاني، ثم اتخذها المجاهدون مقراً للجهاد المقدس، ثم مقرا لقائد القدس الأردني، ثم مدرسة.\nوقد استولى عليها الصهاينة عام 1967م بعد احتلال القدس والمسجد الأقصى.\n\nالبوائك\nالبوائك وتسمى أيضا القناطر والموازين، وهي عبارة عن أعمدة تربطها عقود، وتقع أعلى الدرجات الحجرية التي تقود إلى صحن الصخرة المشرفة التي تقع في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. وقد أنشئت هذه البوائك لأغراض جمالية، فوق الدرجات التي تقود إلى صحن الصخرة والتي تسهل أيضا انتقال المصلين بين مختلف جهات المسجد الأقصى دون الحاجة إلى الالتفاف حول الصحن.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى بداية العهد الإسلامي للأقصى خاصة العهد المملوكي الذي يعتبر من أزهى العهود التي مرت بالأقصى المبارك، وجددت في العهد العثماني. وهي 8 بوائك\n\nالبائكة الشمالية\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الشمالي لصحن الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 721هـ - 1321م، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7.5 أمتار.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودين أسطوانيين في الوسط، وسلمها الحجري يقوم على مرحلة واحدة وهو من تسع درجات.\n\nالبائكة الشمالية الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع على الطرف الغربي لصحن الصخرة في جهته الشمالية، بالقرب من قبة الخضر. يعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 778هـ/1376م،\nثم جددت في العهد العثماني، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 أمتار.\nوالبائكة عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية في الوسط، سلمها الحجري تبلغ عدد درجاته ثلاثا وعشرين درجة.\n\nالبائكة الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الحد الغربي لصحن الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها المعروف حالياً إلى عام 340هـ/951م.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية في الوسط، سلمها تبلغ درجاته أربعا وعشرين درجة، توصل الصاعد إلى صحن الصخرة من ساحة المسجد الغربية.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع على المحيط الغربي لصحن قبة الصخرة في جهته الجنوبية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى 877هـ/1472م.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودين من الرخام في الوسط، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 أمتار، ويوصل إليها سلم حجري، من أربع وعشرين درجة.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الجنوبي لصحن الصخرة، يُعْتَقَدُ أنها أنشئت في العهد الأموي، ولكن من المؤكد أنها جددت في العهد العباسي، ثم الفاطمي والعثماني، ثم رممتها دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية عام 1402هـ/1982م.\nوهي عبارة عن ثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية وسطى، تحفها ركبتان عظيمتان عن يمين وعن شِمال، يبلغ ارتفاعها ستة أمتار ونصف المتر. ويصل ساحة المسجد بصحن الصخرة درج حجري من عشرين درجة.\nوفي الواجهة الجنوبية من هذه البائكة الجنوبية، توجد مزولة شمسية يستعين بها المصلون للتعرف على أوقات الصلوات، وهي من صنع مهندس المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى رشدي الإمام سنة 1907م.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع قرب الطرف الشرقي للحد الجنوبي لصحن الصخرة. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الفاطمي عام 412هـ/1021م، وتم تجديدها في العهد الأيوبي عام 608هـ/1211م.\nوالبائكة عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودي رخام أسطواني الشكل في الوسط، وعدد درجات سلمها الحجري تسع عشرة، ويتراوح ارتفاعها بين 6.5 متر و7 أمتار.\n\nالبائكة الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في الركن الشرقي لصحن الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها على الأرجح في العهد الأموي، وأعيد بناؤها في العصر العباسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي\nوتعد أكبر البوائك حول صحن الصخرة، حيث تتكون من ركبتين عظيمتين، وأربعة أعمدة أسطوانية رخامية الصناعة. ويصل ساحة المسجد الشرقية بصحن الصخرة اثنتان وعشرون درجة، وثلاث درجات أخريات، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 6.5 متر.\n\nالبائكة الشمالية الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في الجانب الشمالي من سطح قبة الصخرة من ناحية الشرق، تتصل بمحور مستقيم عبر ممر مبلط بباب حطة. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 726هـ/1325م في عهد السلطان الناصر ناصر الدين محمد بن قلاوون، وقد وثق ذلك بنقش على الواجهة الجنوبية للبائكة.\n\nالأسبلة\nحرص المسلمون حرصاً شديداً على توفير المياه للشرب والطهور في المسجد الأقصى المبارك، فحُفرت الآبار، وتم إنشاء الصهاريج والأسبلة داخله في الساحات المكشوفة، لتخزين مياه الأمطار. والسبيل عين ماء وما لحقها، وقد زودت بصنابير للمياه وثلاجات لدى تجديدها في العصر الحديث.\nويعود إنشاء هذه الأسبلة إلى العصرين الأيوبي والمملوكي، كما أن كثيرا منها استحدث أو جدد في العصر العثماني بأمر السلطان سليمان القانوني الذي تميز عهده ببناء الأسبلة. وللأقصى أسبلة كثيرة نذكر منها 14 التالية:\n\nسبيل الكأس\n\nيقع هذا السبيل المشهور أمام المصلى القبلي، قيل إنه من بناء العباسيين في الأصل، ولكن البناء الحالي تم في عهد السلطان الأيوبي العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب عام 589هـ/1193م، وقد جدده المماليك وقاموا بتوسعته في عهد الأمير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1327-1328م، لاستيعاب المزيد من المصلين. على الرغم من توفير المياه أصلا من مياه بركة سليمان بالقرب من بيت لحم، أما حاليا فيتلقى المياه من الأنابيب المرتبطة بشبكة مياه القدس. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم لشكله الشبيه بالكأس، ويسمى أيضا بسبيل البركة\nوالكأس بركة أسطوانية الشكل، وفي وسطها كاس مرتفعة، تتوسطها ماسورة مياه، تتدفق المياه منها إلى الحوض، فتصب من الكأس للبركة، بشكل جميل. ويستعمل الناس مياه الكأس للوضوء خاصة، على كراسٍ حجرية الصنع ذات ألوان جميلة، وأمام كل منها حنفية مربوطة بالبركة، وهي عشرون حنفية.\n\nسبيل شعلان\nيقع هذا السبيل شمالي درج البائكة الشمالية الغربية التي تقود إلى صحن قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 1216م في عهد السلطان الأيوبي الملك المعظم عيسى، وجدد في العهد المملوكي على يد الملك الأشرف بربساي عام 1429م، وجدد مرة أخرى سنة 1037هـ/1627م على يد بيرام باشا محافظ مصر، في عهد محافظ القدس محمد باشا في العصر العثماني، وقد كان السبيل عامرا حتى آخر عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وأما اليوم فهو معطل.\n\nصهريج المعظم عيسى الأيوبي\nوهو مبنى يقوم في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين البائكتين: البائكة الغربية والبائكة الجنوبية الغربية أسفل صحن الصخرة، أمام باب القطانين. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 607هـ/1210م في عهد السلطان الأيوبي عيسى، وسمي باسمه.\nوالبناء مؤلف من ثلاثة أروقة سفلية، فصلت بقواطع بنائية فيما بينها، لكل منها مدخل منفصل في جهتها الغربية. وهو يرتفع عن مستوى صحن الصخرة ببناء أضيف في الفترة العثمانية، وكان أحد أروقته الثلاثة قد استخدم في عهد المماليك مخزنا لحاصلات المسجد الأقصى، وآخر مصلى للحنابلة، ثم أهمل فترة من الزمن، وحُول في وقت لاحق إلى مخزن لحدائق المسجد، ويستعمل جزء منه حاليا كعيادة طبية مكملة للعيادة الطبية الواقعة شماله، والجزء الأكبر منه عبارة عن مكاتب للأوقاف.\n\nسبيل البصيري\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شمال شرق باب الناظر داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 839هـ/1436م في عهد السلطان المملوكي الأشرف برسباي، وقيل إنه أنشئ قبله وأن بناءه تجديد فقط. ويسمى أيضا سبيل الحبس، وسبيل باب الناظر، وبئر إبراهيم الرومي.\n\nسبيل قايتباي\n\nوهو سبيل مياه شهير يقع مقابل باب المطهرة، وقد بُني السبيل فوق الطرف الشماليّ الغربيّ لمصطبة واسعة تحمل نفس الاسم، ولها محراب في الجهة الجنوبية، بناهما الملك الأشرف أبوالنصر إينال عام 860هـ، ثم جدد السبيل في عهد الملك الأشرف قايتباي عام 887هـ/1482م بعد تهدمه، وعرف باسمه، وأعاد تجديده السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الثاني عام 1330هـ/1912م.\nوالسبيل عبارة عن مبنى مرتفع وجميل، دخلت فيه فنون العمارة، وجملته الحجارة الملونة الداخلة في بنائه، وله قبة جميلة مزخرفة بزخارف نباتية، قيل انه السبيل الوحيد من نوعه في فلسطين قاطبة.\n\nسبيل قاسم باشا\n\nيقوم هذا السبيل بين المدرسة الأشرفية غربا، والصحن الغربي للصخرة المشرفة شرقا، في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك.\nويسمى أيضا سبيل باب المحكمة، نسبة إلى باب السلسلة الذي يقع بالقرب منه. بني في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 933هـ/1527م، على يد والي القدس قاسم باشا، وسمي باسمه.\nوالسبيل مثمن الشكل، تنزل إليه بدرجات، من فوقه سقف خشبي يحجب أشعة الشمس عن مستعمليه، ويقلل من ضغط الرياح القارصة ليلا والأمطار النازلة شتاء.\n\nسبيل سليمان القانوني\n\nيقع في الساحات الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بناه السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 943هـ/1536م، ومنه جاءت تسميته. ويسمى أيضا بسبيل السلسلة وسبيل العتم.\n\nسبيل باب المغاربة\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شرقي باب المغاربة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وتحديدا على الطرف الجنوبي الشرقي لمصطبة مصلى البراق، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى العهد العثماني.\n\nسبيل باب حطة\nيوجد هذا السبيل البسيط على شكل تجويف داخل الجدار الشرقي لباب حطة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى العهد العثماني، وقد رممته مؤسسة الأقصى لإعمار المقدسات الإسلامية أثناء بنائها لوحدة المراحيض القريبة مؤخرا، ثم أُلْغٍي نهائيا بعد ذلك.\nوإلى الشرق من باب حطة.\n\nبركة النارنج\n\nوهي بركة تقع في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك أمام المدرسة الأشرفية، بين مصطبة سبيل قايتباي شمالا، وسبيل قاسم باشا جنوبا، وتسمى أيضاً بركة عنغج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى 887هـ/1482م في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، وقامت لجنة إعمار المقدسات بترميمها مؤخرا.\nوهي بركة مربعة الشكل، طول ضلعها سبعة أمتار، فرشت أرضها وحيطانها بالرخام، يتوسطها صحن به نافورة معطلة، ويحيط بها أربع وعشرين حنفية من ثلاث جهات.\n\nسبيل الشيخ بدير\n\nيقع سبيل الشيخ بدير إلى الجنوب الشرقي من باب الحبس، غرب البائكة الشمالية الغربية التي تقود إلى صحن قبة الصخرة، وقد بني في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الأول عام 1153هـ/1740م، بإشراف مصطفى آغا قائم مقام القدس، وبأمر من الوالي عثمان بيك. وتسمى أيضا سبيل البديري.\nوقد نُقِشَتْ عليه عدة أبيات شعرية مقروءة وجميلة، في رخامه على حائطه الشرقي. وهو اليوم معطل رغم أنه رُمٌِمَ حديثا على يد دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nسبيل منبر برهان الدين\nيقع هذا السبيل على زاوية درج البائكة الجنوبية، خلف قبة الميزان (وتسمى أيضا منبر برهان الدين)، في الساحات الجنوبية للمسجد الأقصى. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 1418هـ/1998م على يد لجنة الإعمار المنبثقة عن دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\nويبلغ تعداد صنابيرها أربعة وعشرين، ويستخدمها بعض الزائرين للوضوء.\n\nسبيل الزيتونة\nويقع السبيل غربي سبيل الكأس، أقامته لجنة التراث الإسلامي حديثا برعاية دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية. وقد سُمِّيَ بهذا الإسم نسبة إلى شجرة الزيتون التي تحيط بها حنفياته السبع.\nيعمل السبيل من خلال ثلاجة في عرق الزيتونة المعمرة ذات الثلاث شعب، والتي عرفت منذ بدايات القرن العشرين باسم زيتونة النبي، ولا يعرف سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم.\n\nسبيل الرحمة\nيقع السبيل غرب بابي الرحمة والتوبة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى 1416هـ/1995م على يد لجنة التراث الإسلامي، وهو عبارة عن اثنتي عشرة حنفية عامرة ومستعملة.\n\nمعالم أخرى\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على عدة معالم أخرى نذكر منها:\n\nحائط البراق\nقسم من الحائط الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك يمتد بين باب المغاربة جنوبا، والمدرسة التنكزية شمالا، ويبلغ طوله حوالي 50 مترا، أما ارتفاعه فيقل عن 20 مترا، وقد عرف بهذا الاسم لأن النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ربط دابته البراق فيه على الأرجح يوم إسرائه إلى المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nمنبر نور الدين الزنكي\nهو منبر تاريخي شهير يمثل روعة الفن والزخرفة الإسلامية، بناه نور الدين زنكي عام 564هـ/1168م، ليحمل إلى المسجد الأقصى بعد تحريرها من الصليبيين، لكنه مات قبل أن يحقق ذلك، فلما حرر صلاح الدين بيت المقدس، أمر بإحضاره من حلب، وذلك بعد أكثر من عشرين عاما من بنائه، ووضعه داخل المصلى القبلي وهو المصلى الرئيسي في المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\nوالمنبر مصنوع من الخشب المطعّم بالعاج والأبنوس، تعب النجّارون والصنّاع والمهندسون فيه سنين، وكان لترديد النظر فيه على الأيّام ألوفاً، له بوّابة يرتفع فوقها تاجٌ عظيم ثمّ درج يرقى إلى قوس أعلاه وشرف خشبيّة.\n\nوفي عام 1389هـ/1969م، أحرق المصلى القبلي في حريق الأقصى مما أدى أيضا إلى تدمير المنبر بالكامل، ولدى إعادة ترميم الجامع بين عامي 1389هـ/1969م و1402هـ/1982م وقد استحدث منبر حديدي بسيط الصناعة مكان منبر نور الدين، وهو منبر مؤقت بقي هناك حتى تم إنشاء منبر آخر مطابق للمنبر الأصلي وبنفس المميزات والمواد في الأردن، وتم تركيبه في بداية شهر فبراير عام 2007م.\n\nآبار الأقصى\nيحتوي الأقصى على 25 بئرا عامرة، فيها من الماء ما يكفى سكانَ البلدة القديمة بالقدس، وليس للمصلين الذين يفدون إلى الأقصى فقط. وهذه الآبار موزعة بين صحن الصخرة المشرفة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وباقي ساحات المسجد الأقصى المبارك، حيث يوجد منها ثمانية فوق صحن الصخرة، وسبعة عشر في الساحات المحيطة ومن أشهرها:\n\nبئر الجنة\nبئر رمانة\n\nمصاطب المسجد الأقصى المبارك\nتنتشر في ساحات المسجد الأقصى المبارك 26 مصطبة، خاصة الساحات الغربية، وأغلبها يعود للفترة العثمانية، وهي عبارة عن مساحات مسطحة ترتفع ببناء لمسافة أقل من متر عن سطح الأرض. وتبنى عادة من الحجر، ويتم الوصول إليها من خلال عدة درجات. وغالبا ما يكون لها محراب على شكل حنية أو تجويف في جدار صغير يحدد اتجاه القبلة. وتستخدم المصاطب للجلوس والصلاة والتدريس، خاصة في فصل الصيف. أغلبها غير مؤرخ\n\nمصاطب غير مؤرخة :\n\nقدسية المسجد الأقصى عند المسلمين\nكان الأقصى قبلة المسلمين الأولى وقبلة يهود يثرب، لكن الله أمر النبي بتحويل القبلة إلى المسجد الحرام: ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤ وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَا تَبِعُوا قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَا أَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُمْ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ ۝١٤٥﴾\n\nفضائل المسجد الأقصى\nورد لدى المسلمين في القرآن، وفي أحاديث النبي محمد العديد من فضائل المسجد الأقصى وأهميته، منها:\n\nفي القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ (1)\nعن ميمونة بنت الحارث أنها قالت: «يا رسول الله أفتِنَا في بيت المقدس، فقال: إِيتوهُ فصلُّوا فيه، وكانت البلاد إذ ذاك حربًا، فإن لم تأتوه وتصلّوا فيه فابعثوا بزيتٍ يُسرَج في قناديله».\nعن أم سلمة عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «من أهلَّ بعمرةٍ من بيتِ المقدسِ غُفر له».\nعن أبي سعيد الخدري، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «لا تُشَدُّ الرحالُ إلا إلى ثلاثةِ مساجدَ: المسجدِ الحرام، والمسجدِ الأقصَى، ومسجدي هذا».\nعن جابر بن عبد الله، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «صلاةٌ في المسجدِ الحرامِ مائةُ ألفِ صلاةٍ، وصلاةٌ في مسجدِي ألفُ صلاةٍ، وفي بيتِ المقدسِ خمسمائةِ صلاةٍ».\nعن أبي ذر الغفاري، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «صلاةً في مسجدي هذا (المسجد النبوي) أفضلُ من أَرْبَعِ صلواتٍ فيهِ (المسجد الأقصى)، ولَنِعمَ المُصَلى هُوَ، ولِيُوشِكَنَّ أَنْ لا يَكُونَ للرَّجلِ مثلُ شطنِ فرسهِ من الأرضِ حيث يَرَى مِنهُ بيتَ المقدسِ خيراً لَهُ مِنَ الدنيا جميعاً».\n\nللمسجد الأقصى قدسية كبيرة عند المسلمين ارتبطت بعقيدتهم منذ بداية الدعوة. فهو يعتبر قبلة الأنبياء جميعاً قبل النبي محمد وهو القبلة الأولى التي صلى إليها النبي قبل أن يتم تغير القبلة إلى مكة.\nوقد توثقت علاقة الإسلام بالمسجد الأقصى ليلة الإسراء والمعراج، حيث أنه أسرى بالنبي من المسجد الحرام إلى المسجد الأقصى، وفيه صلى النبي إماماً بالأنبياء ومنه عرج النبي إلى السماء. وفي السماء العليا فرضت عليه الصلاة.\nذكر القرآن واصفاً ليلة الإسراء والمعراج: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾، ووصف الله للمسجد الأقصى بـ﴿الذي باركنا حوله﴾، يدل على بركة المسجد ومكانته عند الله وعند المسلمين. فالأقصى هو منبع البركة التي عمت كل المنطقة حوله في اعتقاد المسلمين.\nوروي عن أم المؤمنين أم سلمة أنها سمعت رسول الله يقول:\n\nوللصلاة في المسجد الأقصى ثواب يعادل خمسمائة صلاة في غيره من المساجد. قال رسول الله: « الصلاة في المسجد الحرام بمائة ألف صلاة، والصلاة في مسجدي بألف صلاة، والصلاة في بيت المقدس بخمسمائة صلاة »، وفي رواية أخرى أن الصلاة في المسجد الأقصى تعدل مئتين وخمسين صلاة في غير المساجد الثلاثة.\nوهو المسجد الذي أمر النبي الصحابة بالبقاء قربه، فقد روى أحمد في مسنده عن ذِي الأصَابِعِ قَال: «قلت: يا رسول الله، إِنِ أبْتُلِينَا بعدك بالبقاء أين تأمرنا؟ قال: عليك ببيت المقدس فلعله أن ينشأ لك ذرية يعدون إلى ذلك المسجد ويروحون».\nويعتبر المسجد الأقصى ثالث المساجد التي تشد إليها الرحال، فقد ذكر النبي أن المساجد الثلاثة الوحيدة التي تشد إليها الرحال هي: المسجد الحرام، والمسجد النبوي، والمسجد الأقصى.\n\nوكلها أحاديث تدل على مكانة المسجد، وعمق علاقته بالإسلام. وهناك العديد من الأحاديث الأخرى التي ذكرت المسجد الأقصى وحثت على زيارته والصلاة فيه.\n\nحفريات المسجد الأقصى\nفي أعقاب استيلاء إسرائيل على القدس الشرقية في حرب 1967م، قامت بعدة حفريات خارج ساحات المسجد الأقصى أو كما تسميه بجبل الهيكل. وفي عام 1970م، بدأت السلطات الإسرائيلية بحفريات مكثفة خارج الأسوار بجوار المسجد على الجانبين الجنوبي والغربي. ويعتقد الفلسطينيون أن أنفاقا حفرت تحت المسجد الأقصى من أجل تقويض أساساته، وهو الأمر الذي نفته القوات الإسرائيلية، وقد زعموا أن أقرب الحفريات إلى المسجد كانت نحو 70 مترا إلى الجنوب منها. كما قام الإسرائيليون بحفر نفق بالقرب من الجزء الغربي من المسجد عام 1984م. ووفقاً لمبعوث اليونسكو الخاص بالقدس أوليغ غرابار، ذكر أن المباني والهياكل في الحرم القدسي آخذة في التدهور ويرجع ذلك أساسا إلى النزاعات بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين والحكومة الأردنية حول من هو المسؤول عن هذا الموقع.\nفي 2007م قام الإسرائيليون بحفريات جديدة للكشف عن آثار مزعومة على بعد 60 مترًا من الحرم القدسي، وقد أثارت هذه الحفريات غضب العالم الإسلامي، واتهموا الإسرائيليين بمحاولة تدمير أسس المسجد. وقد دعا إسماعيل هنية الفلسطينيين للقيام باحتجاجات ضد هذه الحفريات، بينما قالت حركة فتح إنها ستنهي اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار مع إسرائيل.\n\nأبرز

          "content": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.\n\nArchitecture\nStructure\nThe Dome of the Rock's basic plan is essentially octagonal. It is capped at its center by a dome, approximately 20 m (66 ft) in diameter, mounted on an elevated circular drum standing on 16 supports (4 piers and 12 columns). Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. The inner circular row of drum supports and the octagonal arcade create an inner ambulatory that encircles the holy rock. The outer walls are also octagonal. They each measure approximately 60 m (200 ft) wide and 36 m (118 ft) high. The inner and outer octagon create a second, outer ambulatorium surrounding the inner one. Both the circular drum and the exterior walls contain many windows.\n\nInterior decoration\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. The inner colonnade features ablaq light and dark stone voussoirs in its arches. The origins of these marble treatments are controversial, with some scholars theorizing them to be from the original construction, and some saying they were later additions (and differing then as to the dates and identity of the builders).\nIt also contains Qur'anic inscriptions. They vary from today's standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran. The dedicatory inscription in Kufic script placed around the dome contains the date believed to be the year the Dome was first completed, AH 72 (691/2 CE), while the name of the corresponding caliph and builder of the Dome, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) during whose reign renovations took place.\n\nExterior decoration\nThe decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls. 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration. This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including cuerda seca tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital. A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem. The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy.\nSurah Ya-Sin (the 'Heart of the Quran') is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. Surah 17, Al-Isra', which tells the story of the Isra or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic background\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian.\nJerusalem was ruled by the Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Emperor Julian.\nIn 638 CE, Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab, second Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Umar was advised by Ka'b al-Ahbar, a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam, that the site is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem. Among the first Muslims, Jerusalem was referred to as Madinat bayt al-Maqdis ('City of the Temple').\n\nUmayyads\nOriginal construction\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today. It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705). According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688. A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed. An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started. In this inscription, the name of \"al-Malik\" was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864. Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641).\nThe Dome of the Rock's architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. The supervisor and engineer in charge of the project were Raja ibn Haywa, Yazid ibn Salam, and the latter's son Baha. Raja was a Muslim theologian and native of Beisan, and Yazid and Baha were mawali (non-Arab, Muslim converts; clients) of Abd al-Malik from Jerusalem. Abd al-Malik was represented in the supervision of the construction by his son Sa'id al-Khayr. The Caliph employed expert works from across his domain, at the time restricted to Syria and Egypt, who were presumably Christians. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt. The historian K. A. C. Creswell noted that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is 20.20 m (66.3 ft) and its height 20.48 m (67.2 ft), while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is 20.90 m (68.6 ft) and its height 21.05 m (69.1 ft).\n\nMotivations for construction\nNarratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik's motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary. At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand. Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam's uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes\" - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others.\nThe other main explanation holds that Abd al-Malik, in the heat of the war with Ibn al-Zubayr, sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the Muslims in his realm from the Ka'aba in Mecca, where Ibn al-Zubayr would publicly condemn the Umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary. Though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti-Umayyad propaganda in the traditional Muslim sources and doubt that Abd al-Malik would attempt to alter the sacred Muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the Ka'aba, other historians concede that this cannot be conclusively dismissed.\n\nAbbasids and Fatimids\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846. The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023. The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028. The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome.\n\nCrusaders\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar. The Templars, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon. The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.\n\nAyyubids and Mamluks\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami'a Al-Aqsa.\nThe Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the Mamluk period, which lasted from 1260 until 1516.\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nDuring the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock. The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics. This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site. Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman's reign, if not later. Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III (r. 1574–1595) and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome.\nThe tiles seem to have been fabricated locally rather than at centers like Iznik (famous for its production of Iznik pottery at this time), although there does not appear to have been a sophisticated ceramic production center in the region. Robert Hillenbrand remarks that the workshops that produced the tiles must have been dedicated to this project alone, because there is no evidence that similar tilework was produced for other monuments in Jerusalem during this period. The name of one of the craftsmen is recorded in an inscription as Abdallah of Tabriz. This may indicate that the tiles were commissioned from a workshop of Iranian craftsmen from Tabriz who are thought to have produced many earlier Ottoman tiles.\nThe Dome of the Chain, a free-standing structure next to the Dome of the Rock, was also renovated as part of Suleiman's project, in 1561–2. Also nearby, the Ottomans built the Dome of the Prophet in its current form sometime in the 16th or 17th century.\nFurther restorations to the building are recorded in 1720–1721, 1742,1754, 1780, 1817–1818, and 1853. In another major restoration project undertaken in 1874–1875 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz, all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\nParts of the Dome of the Rock collapsed during the 11 July 1927 earthquake, and the walls were left badly cracked, damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.\n\nJordanian rule\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\nIsraeli rule\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to \"keep the peace\".\nIn 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of US$8.25 million by King Hussein of Jordan, who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms (180 lb) of gold required.\n\nAccessibility\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan.\nUntil the mid-20th century, non-Muslims were not permitted in the area. Since 1967, non-Muslims have been permitted limited access; however non-Muslims are not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, bring prayer books, or wear religious apparel. The Israeli police help enforce this. Israel restricted access for a short time during 2012 of Palestinian residents of the West Bank to the Temple Mount. West Bank Palestinian men had to be over 35 to be eligible for a permit. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who hold Israeli residency cards, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access.\nSome Orthodox rabbis encourage Jews to visit the site, while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of Jewish law. Even rabbis who encourage entrance to the Temple Mount prohibit entrance to the actual Dome of the Rock.\n\nReligious significance\nThe location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (\"the farthest place of prayer\") where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah. Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad's Night Journey.\nJudging though by the early Muslim sources, this does not seem to have been yet a fully formulated part of the beliefs shared by Muslims during the construction of the Dome in the 8th century, and the inscriptions inside the dome attributing the building to Caliph 'Abd al-Malik in the year 691/2 do not refer at all to the Night Journey, but contain only the Quranic view on the nature of the prophet Isa (Jesus) instead. The inscription is in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of Christ:\n\n33. \"So peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!\" 34. Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they doubt. 35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should take himself a child. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\nAccording to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula la sharika lahu ('God has no companion') is repeated five times; the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam – \"O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary.\" He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.\nAt the beginning of the 8th century, Ibn Ishaq codified the earliest Arabic source pertaining to the Jerusalem Rock, as part of his Sirat al-Nabi, a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, introducing the notion that right after his Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem (isra'), he set off immediately and specifically from the Rock in his Ascension (mi'raj) to Heaven, where God instructed him in the doctrines of the new religion.\nToday, many Muslims believe the Dome serves for the commemoration of Muhammad's Ascension, in accordance to the views shared by some Islamic scholars, that the Rock is indeed the spot from which Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.\n\nOther Islamic scholars believe that Muhammad ascended to Heaven from the Masjid Al-Aqsa, of which the Dome of the Rock is a part.\nIn traditional Jewish sources, it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began. Moreover, many Jews believe the site to be where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. The Foundation Stone and its surroundings which lie at the center of the dome, are considered the holiest site in Judaism. Jews traditionally regard the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies of the First and the Second Temple.\nThough Muslims now pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, they once faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do; Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards Jerusalem until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca.\nThe Temple Institute wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a Third Temple, a vision in line with the New Jerusalem prophecy. Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era, and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God's hand. However, some Evangelical Christians consider rebuilding of the Temple to be a prerequisite to Armageddon and the Second Coming. Jeremy Gimpel, a US-born candidate for The Jewish Home political party in the 2013 Israeli elections, caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a Fellowship Church evangelical group in Florida in 2011 to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the Dome to be destroyed and the construction of the Third Temple begun. All evangelicals would immediately rush to go to Israel, he opined.\n\nInfluence and depiction\nHomages in art and architecture\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of the Virgin.\nFor the same reason, the Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the 15th-century octagonal Church of St. Giacomo in Italy, the 19th-century octagonal Moorish Revival-style Rumbach Street Synagogue in Budapest, as well as the Mausoleum of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Istanbul and the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany.\n\nOn banknotes\nThe Dome of the Rock has been depicted on the obverse and reverse of several Middle Eastern currencies:\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nCreswell, K.A.C.

          "summary": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.",

          "content": "مصلى قبة الصخرة أحد أجزاء المسجد الأقصى «فالمسجد الأقصى هو كل ما داخل سور الأقصى»، وهو جزء من أحد أهم المساجد الإسلامية في مدينة القدس وفلسطين والعالم الإسلامي، ومن أجمل الأبنية في العالم، إذ تُعتبر قبّته من أهم وأبرز المعالم المعمارية الإسلامية، كما ويُعتبر أقدم بناء إسلامي بقي مُحافظا على شكله وزخرفته. بنى هذا المسجد والقبّة الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدأ في بنائها عام 66هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72هـ الموافق 691م، وأشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوة الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّة الصخرة عبارة عن بناء مثمن الأضلاع له أربعة أبواب، وفي داخله تثمينة أخرى تقوم على دعامات وأعمدة أسطوانية، في داخلها دائرة تتوسطها «الصخرة المُشرفة» التي عرج منها النبي محمد إلى السماء في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج،\nوترتفع هذه الصخرة نحو 1,5 متراً عن أرضية البناء، وهي غير منتظمة الشكل، ويتراوح قطرها بين 13 و 18 متراً، وتعلو الصخرة في الوسط قبّة دائرية قطرها حوالي 20 متراً، مطلية من الخارج بألواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35 متراً، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع خمسة أمتار.\nويذكر بعض العلماء أن الكنائس التي بناها فرسان الهيكل فيما بعد، تأثرت بأسلوب العمارة الإسلامية وبنمط قبة الصخرة، ويظهر ذلك جليًا في قلعة كاستل دل مونتي الإيطالية.\nتعتبر قبة الصخرة المشرفة إحدى أهم المعالم الإسلامية في العالم، فإضافة إلى مكانتها وقدسيتها الدينية، فهي أقدم نموذج في العمارة الإسلامية، ولما تحمله من روعة فنية وجمالية تطوي بين زخارفها بصمات الحضارة الإسلامية على مر فتراتها المتتابعة، حيث جلبت انتباه واهتمام الباحثين والزائرين من كل البقاع، لما امتازت به من تناسق وانسجام عناصرها المعمارية والزخرفية، حتى اعتبرت آية في الهندسة المعمارية.\nوقد اهتم المسلمون برعاية وعناية قبة الصخرة المشرفة، على مر الفترات الإسلامية المتعاقبة، خاصة بعد كل خراب له جراء التأثيرات الطبيعية، من هزات أرضية أو عواصف أو أمطار أو حرائق، فلم يتأخر أي خليفة أو سلطان في ترميمها والحفاظ عليها.\n\nتاريخ\nبنى الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان المصلى عام 72هـ لاستقطاب المسلمين إلى هذه البقعة المقدسة، بعد نقل عاصمة الخلافة من المدينة المنورة إلى دمشق وإقامة الأمويين في بلاد الشام. ويقع المصلى وسط هضبة صخرية واسعة تسمى الحرم الشريف ويقع على امتداد محوره الجامع القبلي.\nتعد قبة الصخرة من أهم معالم المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وقد شرع في إنشائه عبد الملك بن مروان الخليفة الأموي الخامس، سنة 68هـ\\688م، حول الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة على صحن مرتفع وسط ساحة الحرم الشريف، وانتهى بناؤها عام 72هـ\\691م.\nوقد أقام عبد الملك فوقها بناء مستديرًا، مكونًا من قبة خشبية مرتكزة على رقبة مستديرة الشكل، محاطة بست عشرة نافذة. وهذه الرقبة مستندة على رواق مستدير، محمولة على أربعة أركان من الرخام الأبيض المشجر، واثني عشر عمودًا موزعة، بحيث يعقب كل ركن ثلاثة أعمدة. ويتكون باقي البناء الذي في ظاهر الرواق الداخلي المستدير من مطافين يحوطان به. وهما منفصلان، أحدهما عن الآخر، برواق وسطي مثمن الشكل، محمول على ثمانية أركان، مؤزرة بالرخام المشجر والملون البديع، وستة عشر عمودًا موزعة بحيث يعقب كل ركن عمودان. ويربط الأركان والعمد التي بينها بساطل وهو رابط خشبي ملبس بالنحاس الأصفر المذهب المنقوش. وتعلو البساطلَ قناطرُ كلها مزينة بالفص المذهب البديع المزين بأنواع التشجير والتنميق. وقد نص على هذه القناطر سقف مائل من الخشب، دهن باطنه بأشكال هندسية ظريفة، وصفح من الظاهر بأنواع الرصاص. ويشغل باقي المساحة مطاق خارجي يقع بين الرواق الوسطي وجدران البناء الخارجية التي تتخذ شكلًا مثمنًا، ولكل ضلع من أضلاعه المقابلة للجهات الأربع باب. وعلى بعد بضعة أمتار خارج الباب الشرقي تقوم فيه السلسلة. وهي بناء جميل كثير الشبه بقبة الصخرة مما جعل بعض الدارسين يعتقد أنه بني كأُنْموذَجٍ لها.\nوجدير بالذكر، أن جميع الدراسات والاختبارات الأثرية الكثيرة التي أجراها علماء مختصون على البناء، خلال عمليات الصيانة والترميم على مدى الأزمان، أثبتت بما لا يدع مجالًا لأي شك، أن قبة الصخرة، بكامل أساساتها وجدرانها الخارجية، هي من إنشاء عبد الملك بن مروان، وأنها بناء متجانس الأجزاء، لا يضم بقايا أي بناء قديم كما توهم بعضهم.\n\nالتسمية\nسُميَّ مسجد قبة الصخرة بهذا الاسم نسبةً إلى الصخرة المُشرفة التي عرج منها النبي محمد في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج. إن قبة الصخرة أثر هام في تاريخ العمارة الإسلامية مرتبط بكل مسلم وبعقيدته في الإسراء والمعراج، وهي في العمارة الإسلامية أقدم أثر باق يشهد على نشأة فن العمارة الإسلامية، وعلى جمال زخرفة هذا الفن الجديد، وقبة الصخرة أثر يشهد لبانيه خليفة المسلمين الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان بجهده ويوضع لبنة أولى في صرح العمارة الإسلامية.\n\nالوصف\nهو بناء من الحجر على تخطيط مثمن طول ضلعه نحو 12,5 متراً، وداخل المثمن الخارجي مثمن آخر داخلي، وفي كل ضلع من أضلاعه ثلاثة عقود محمولة على عمود وثمانية أكتاف، وداخل المثمن الثاني دائرة من 12 عمودا وأربعة أكتاف، وفوق الدائرة قبة قطرها 20,44 متراً، وارتفاع القبة الحالي يبلغ 35,30 متراً عن مستوى التربة، مرفوعة على رقبة أسطوانة فتحت بها 161 نافذة، وهي من الخشب تغطيها من الداخل طبقة من الجبص ومن الخارج طبقة من الرصاص، وللمسجد أربعة أبواب متعامدة.\nأما القبب الخارجية والداخلية فهي منظمة على هيكل مركزي، هيكل القبة الخارجية مشبوك على إطار الأسطوانة الخارجية، هذا الإطار مصنوع من جسور خشبية موصولة مع بعضها لتشكل سلسلة دائرية مستمرة، فوق هذه الجسور توجد شبكة خشبية يوضع عليها طبقة الغطاء الخارجية.\nوتقع الصخرة المشرفة في مركز هذا المصلى، ويعتقد العامة أن هذه الصخرة معلقة بين السماء والأرض وهذا اعتقاد خاطئ. ويوجد أسفل الصخرة كهف به محراب قديم يطلق عليه مصلى الأنبياء، ويحيط بالصخرة حاجز من الخشب المعشق من تجديدات السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون عام 725هـ، وتحيط بمنطقة الصخرة أربع دعامات من الحجر المغلف ببلاطات الرخام، بينها 12 عموداً من الرخام، تحمل 16 عقداً تشكل في أعلاها رقبة أسطوانية، تقوم عليها القبة.\n\nالصخرة\nهي عبارة عن قطعة ضخمة من الصخر، تقع تحت القبة في وسط المصلى، طولها من الشمال إلى الجنوب حوالي 18 متراً، وعرضها من الشرق إلى الغرب حوالي أربعة عشر متراً، وأعلى نقطة فيها مرتفعة عن الأرضية نحو متر ونصف، وحولها حاجز من الخشب المنقوش والمدهون، وحول هذا الحاجز مصلى للنساء وله أربعة أبواب، يفصل بينه وبين مصلى الرجال حاجز من الحديد المشبك.\n\nالمغارة\nتقع تحت الصخرة مغارة يطلق عليها اسم مغارة الأرواح، وينزل إليها من الناحية الجنوبية بأحد عشر درجة. على شكل قريب من المربع، طول كل ضلع منه حوالي أربعة أمتار ونصف. ولها سقف ارتفاعه ثلاثة أمتار، به ثغرة اتساعها متر واحد وعند الباب قنطرة مقصورة بالرخام على عمودين.\n\nالزخرفة\nغطت معظم أروقة وجدران المصلى من الداخل بالفسيفساء وهي تظهر الفن الإسلامي في الزخرفة كي تشكل وحدة فنية منسجمة في التكوين ومتحدة في الأسلوب، حيث أنّ حجارة الفسيفساء كانت مصنوعة محلياً. أجمل ما في الزخرفة الآيات القرآنية في أعلى أقواس المضلع المثمن الأوسط تعتبر أقدم ما كتب من الخط العربي الجميل، أطلق عليه اسم الخط الجليل. ومجموعة الألواح البرونزية المذهبة التي تغطي بعضها أجزاء من الأبواب الأربعة أو الأفاريز الواصلة بين تيجان أعمدة أرواق هي أجزاء فريدة في العالم لأصالتها ولجمالها وغناها الزخرفي، وتسيطر عليها أوراق العنب والعناقيد المعالجة بمهارة متجددة.\nوقد جاء الاستغناء عن الصور الممثلة للإنسان والحيوان وفقًا لأحكام الديانة الإسلامية. واستعيض عنها بالأشكال الطبيعية والرسوم المركبة والتقليدية، مما أعطى المكان رونقًا يمتاز عن غيره بما يبعث في النفس من الشعور بالهدوء والطمأنينة والتأمل العميق. والزخرفة بمجموعها مكونة من أشكال متباينة مرنة التكييف، ولا شك أن الفنان الصانع لها كان أمينًا في صنعه على المبادئ الأساسية لأساليب الزخرفة التي كثيرًا ما أهملت، وهي أن تأتي الزينة والزخرفة متنافسين مع المكان الذي تجملانه. وهندسة البناء الداخلية هي التي تطلبت أن تكون الزخرفة على ما جاءت عليه.\nوصفوة القول إن قبة الصخرة في هندستها وشكلها وزخرفتها كانت ولا تزال من أجمل وأروع المباني التي أتحف بها العالم. وقلما يوجد في مباني العالم ما يفوقها، أو يضارعها بهاء وروعة وجمالًا. فزيادة على زخرفة سقوفها المذهبة وجدرانها الرخامية ونوافذها الزجاجية تفتن العين بالفسيفساء. وجمال تأليفها، وألوانها التي جاءت كلها على أحسن تناسق وانسجام، وبالأشكال المختلفة التي استعملت، والأساليب، والألوان، ودقة الصنع التي بلغت الحد الأعلى من الكمال. كل هذا جعل من قبة الصخرة أثرًا فريدًا في تاريخ الفن.\nقبة الصخرة المشرفة بين الحقائق والزيف\nالصخرة المشرفة هي صخرة طبيعية غير منتظمة الشكل تقع في أعلى نقطة من المسجد الأقصى المبارك في موقع قلب المسجد بالضبط، وهي صخرة طبيعية تتراوح أبعادها بين حوالي 13 مترًا و18 مترًا، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي المترين تقريبًا، وقد دارت حولها القصص الخيالية غير الصحيحة بشكل كبير، كمن قال إنها طائرة في الهواء، ومن قال إنها طارت خلف النبي ، ومن قال إن لها نورًا، وغير ذلك.\nوالحقيقة أنها صخرة عادية ليس فيها أي ميزة إلا أنها كانت قبلة أنبياء بني إسرائيل قبل النبي ، وقيل إن النبي عرج من فوقها للسماء ليلة الإسراء والمعراج، وفيها مغارة صغيرة تسمى مغارة الأرواح، وهي كذلك تجويف طبيعي وليس فيه أي ميزة خارقة للعادة. وقد بنيت قبة الصخرة المشرفة فوق الصخرة، وهي ظاهرة للعيان إلى اليوم.\nوحيكت عدة قصص شعبية خيالية زائفة حول الصخرة المشرفة، ذكرها كثير من العلماء، وجمعها الأستاذ عيسى القدومي في كتابه (المسجد الأقصى: الحقيقة والتاريخ)، فمما ذكر القدومي أنها أخبار مكذوبة: أن الصخرة من صخور الجنة، وأنها سيدة الصخور، وهي معلقة من كل الجهات، كما أن مياه الأرض كلها تخرج من تحت هذه الصخرة، وتتحول إلى مرجانة بيضاء.\nونشر عنها غيرها من أكاذيب مثل أن عليها موضع قدم رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، وعليها أثر أصابع الملائكة، وأن الماء الذي يخرج من أصل الصخرة نهر من أنهار الجنة، وأن المياه العذبة والرياح واللواقح من تحت صخرة ببيت المقدس.\nقيل أيضًا أنها عرش الله الأدنى، ومن تحتها بسطت الأرض، وأنها وسط الدنيا وأوسط الأرض كلها، وأخيرًا أن لها مكانة الحجر الأسود في الكعبة.\nوأكد الدكتور عبد الله معروف في دراسته لمعالم المسجد الأقصى أن العلماء أنكروا هذا التعلق بالصخرة، وبينوا أنها صخرة طبيعية وجزء من المسجد الأقصى، وليس لها أية ميزة خاصة، وأكد أن تنبيه الناس إلى حقيقة صخرة بيت المقدس، لا يقلل من فضائل المسجد الأقصى وبيت المقدس بالبركة والفضيلة، وثبت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في الكتب الصحاح والسنن، الكثير من الأحاديث التي نصت على ما حباه الله تعالى من الخير والبركة، وبينت الخصائص التي تميز بها المسجد الأقصى وأرضه لما لها من مكانة عظيمة ومنزلة رفيعة في الشرع الإسلامي. فبركة المسجد الأقصى ثابتة بالكتاب والسنة، ولنا غنى في الصحيح منها عن الموضوع والمكذوب.\nوخلاصة الأمر أن أغلب ما قيل عن الصخرة من أخبار خيالية أصله من الإسرائيليات، وليس له أصل في المصادر الإسلامية الأساسية سواء القرآن الكريم أو الصحيح من حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم. وما التركيز على هذا الأمر إلا بسبب انتشار كبير لبعض هذه الأخبار الزائفة بين المسلمين هذه الأيام، وخاصة مسألة تعليق الصخرة في الهواء!\n\nمعرض الصور\nوصلات خارجية\nفيديو لداخل قبة الصخرة على يوتيوب.\nنموذج ثلاثي الابعاد لقبة الصخرة.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nالمسجد الأقصى.\nالأوقاف في

          "content": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre,  also known as the Church of the Resurrection, is a fourth-century church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church is simultaneously the seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and the Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is the holiest site in Christianity and it has been an important pilgrimage site for Christians since the fourth century.\nAccording to traditions dating to the fourth century, the church contains both the site where Jesus was crucified at Calvary, or Golgotha, and the location of Jesus's empty tomb, where he was buried and, resurrected. Both locations are considered immensely holy sites by most Christians. The church and rotunda was built under Constantine the Great in the 4th century and destroyed by al-Hakim in 1009. Al-Hakim's son allowed Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos to reconstruct the church, which was completed in 1048. After it was captured by the crusaders in 1099, it continued to undergo modifications, resulting in a significant departure from the original structure. Several renovations and restorations were made under the Ottomans. The tomb itself is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicule.\nWithin the church proper are the last four stations of the Cross of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of the Passion of Jesus. The church has been a major Christian pilgrimage destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis ('Resurrection').\nThe Status Quo, an understanding between religious communities dating to 1757, applies to the site. Control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Directly adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.\n\nName\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre is also known as the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre or simply as the Holy Sepulchre, named for the tomb of Jesus, which is at the focal point of his resurrection according to Christians. Eastern Christians also directly call it the Church of the Resurrection or the Church of the Anastasis – anástasis (ἀνάστασις) being Greek for 'resurrection'.\n\nHistory\nBackground (1st–4th centuries)\nAfter the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 during the First Jewish–Roman War, Jerusalem had been reduced to ruins. In AD 130, the Roman emperor Hadrian began the building of a Roman colony, the new city of Aelia Capitolina, on the site. About AD 135, he ordered that a cave containing a rock-cut tomb be filled in to make a flat foundation for a temple dedicated to Jupiter or Venus. The temple remained until the early fourth century.\n\nConstantine and Macarius: context for the first sanctuary\nAfter seeing a vision of a cross in the sky in 312, Constantine the Great began to favour Christianity and signed the Edict of Milan legalizing the religion. The Bishop of Jerusalem Macarius asked Constantine for permission to dig for the tomb. With the help of Eusebius (a Bishop of Caesarea) and Macarius, three crosses were found near a tomb; one, which was said to have cured people near death, was presumed to be the True Cross, on which Jesus was crucified, leading the Romans to believe that they had found Calvary.\nAbout 326, Constantine ordered that the temple to Jupiter or Venus be replaced by a church. After the temple was torn down and its ruins removed, the soil was removed from the cave, revealing a rock-cut tomb that Macarius identified as the burial site of Jesus.\n\nFirst sanctuary (4th century)\nA shrine was built on the site of the tomb Macarius had identified as that of Jesus, enclosing the rock tomb walls within its own.\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre, planned by the architect Zenobius, was built as separate constructs over two holy sites:\n\na rotunda called the Anastasis ('Resurrection'), where Macarius believed Jesus to have been buried, and;\nthe great basilica (also known as Martyrium), across a courtyard to the east (an enclosed colonnaded atrium, known as the Triportico) with the traditional site of Calvary in one corner.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre site has been recognized since early in the fourth century as the place where Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose from the dead. The church was consecrated on 13 September 335.\nIn 327, Constantine and Helena separately commissioned the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem to commemorate the birth of Jesus.\n\nDamage and destruction (614–1009)\nThe Constantinian sanctuary in Jerusalem was destroyed by a fire in May of 614, when the Sassanid Empire, under Khosrow II, invaded Jerusalem and captured the True Cross. In 630, the Emperor Heraclius rebuilt the church after recapturing the city.\nAfter Jerusalem came under Islamic rule, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction or use as living quarters. A story reports that the caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony, but at the time of prayer, turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius of Alexandria adds that Umar wrote a decree saying that Muslims would not inhabit this location. The building suffered severe damage from an earthquake in 746.\nEarly in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by Patriarch Thomas I. In 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the Christians prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the rotunda. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out, which was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and Patriarch John VII was murdered.\nOn 18 October 1009, Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the complete destruction of the church as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt. The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining, and the roof of the rock-cut tomb damaged; the original shrine was destroyed. The tomb itself was almost completely destroyed, with only portions of the northern wall containing the burial bench and the southern wall surviving. Some partial repairs followed. Christian Europe reacted with shock: it was a spur to expulsions of Jews and, later on, used as a justification for the Crusades.\n\nReconstruction (11th century)\nIn wide-ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the Byzantine Empire in 1027–1028, an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph Ali az-Zahir (al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the church. The rebuilding was finally completed during the tenures of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos and Patriarch Nicephorus of Jerusalem in 1048. As a concession, the mosque in Constantinople was reopened and the khutba sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name. Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the renunciation of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under al-Hakim's persecutions. In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by al-Hakim and the reestablishment of a patriarch in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made. Still, \"a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins.\"\nThe rebuilt church site consisted of \"a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it.\" The chapels were east of the court of resurrection (when reconstructed, the location of the tomb was under open sky), where the western wall of the great basilica had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties of free movement among shrines in the city streets. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as \"a sort of Via Dolorosa in miniature\" since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the 11th century found much of the sacred site in ruins. Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the Seljuk Turks (loyal to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad) until the Crusaders' arrival in 1099.\n\nCrusader period (1099–1244)\nBackground\nMany historians maintain that the main concern of Pope Urban II, when calling for the First Crusade, was the threat to Constantinople from the Seljuk invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was also of concern, if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abbasids) by the knights of the First Crusade on 15 July 1099.\nThe First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. The classical theory is that Crusader leader Godfrey of Bouillon, who became the first Latin ruler of Jerusalem, decided not to use the title \"king\" during his lifetime, and declared himself Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri ('Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre').\nAccording to the German priest and pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the \"ancient Georgians\", and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given to them by the pilgrims at the south door of the church.\n\nCrusaders: reconstruction (12th century) and ownership\nBy the Crusader period, a cistern under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the Chapel of the Invention of the Cross, but there is no evidence of the site's identification before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.\nWilliam of Tyre, chronicler of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, reports on the rebuilding of the church in the mid-12th century. The Crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they transformed this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena, widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase.\n\nThe Crusaders began to refurnish the church in Romanesque style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the holy places under one roof for the first time.\nThe church became the seat of the first Latin patriarchs and the site of the kingdom's scriptorium.\n\nEight 11th- and 12th-century Crusader leaders (Godfrey, Baldwin I, Baldwin II, Fulk, Baldwin III, Amalric, Baldwin IV and Baldwin V – the first eight rulers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem) were buried in the south transept and inside the Chapel of Adam. \nThe royal tombs were looted during the Khwarizmian sack of Jerusalem in 1244 but probably remained mostly intact until 1808 when a fire damaged the church. The tombs may have been destroyed by the fire, or during renovations by the Greek Orthodox custodians of the church in 1809–1810. The remains of the kings may still be in unmarked pits under the church's pavement.\nThe church was lost to Saladin, along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while under a ban of excommunication, with the consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in the hands of Greek Orthodox patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem (c. 1231–47) during the last period of Latin control over Jerusalem. Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.\n\nOttoman period\nThere was certainly a recognisable Nestorian (Church of the East) presence at the Holy Sepulchre from the years 1348 through 1575, as contemporary Franciscan accounts indicate. The Franciscan friars renovated the church in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an antechamber. A marble shrine commissioned by Friar Boniface of Ragusa was placed to envelop the remains of Christ's tomb, probably to prevent pilgrims from touching the original rock or taking small pieces as souvenirs. A marble slab was placed over the limestone burial bed where Jesus's body is believed to have lain.\n\nAfter the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favourable firman from the \"Sublime Porte\" at a particular time, often through outright bribery. Violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. During the Holy Week of 1757, Orthodox Christians reportedly took over some of the Franciscan-controlled church. This may have been the cause of the sultan's firman (decree) later developed into the Status Quo.\nA fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the rotunda to collapse and smashing the Aedicule's exterior decoration. The rotunda and the Aedicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–10 by architect Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos of Mytilene in the contemporary Ottoman Baroque style. The interior of the antechamber, now known as the Chapel of the Angel, was partly rebuilt to a square ground plan in place of the previously semicircular western end.\nAnother decree in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and solidified the Status Quo for arrangements to \"remain in their present state\", requiring consensus to make even minor changes.\n\nThe dome was restored by Catholics, Greeks, and Turks in 1868, being made of iron ever since.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nBy the time of the British Mandate for Palestine following the end of World War I, the cladding of red limestone applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos had deteriorated badly and was detaching from the underlying structure; from 1947 until restoration work in 2016–17, it was held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the British authorities.\n\nJordanian and Israeli periods\nIn 1948, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan and where the church was located, in the Old City, were made part of Jordan. In 1967, Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem in the Six Day War, and that area has remained under Israeli control ever since. Under Israeli rule, legal arrangements relating to the churches of East Jerusalem were maintained in coordination with the Jordanian government. The dome at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was restored again in 1994–97 as part of extensive modern renovations that have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–78 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan bazaar, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white meleke limestone was struck. Blocks of Meleke limestone were extracted from the quarry and their traces can be seen on the surfaces of floors, walls and the ceiling in the Chapel of St. Vartan\n\nChapel of St. Vartan\nEast of the Chapel of Saint Helena, the excavators discovered a void containing a fourth-century drawing of a Roman pilgrim ship, two low walls supporting the platform of Hadrian's second-century temple, and a higher fourth-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica. After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the Chapel of Saint Vartan, and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the Chapel of Saint Helena.\n\nAedicule restoration\nAfter seven decades of being held together by steel girders, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) declared the visibly deteriorating Aedicule structure unsafe. A restoration of the Aedicule was agreed upon and executed from May 2016 to March 2017. Much of the $4 million project was funded by the World Monuments Fund, as well as $1.3 million from Mica Ertegün and a significant sum from King Abdullah II of Jordan. The existence of the original limestone cave walls within the Aedicule was confirmed, and a window was created to view this from the inside. The presence of moisture led to the discovery of an underground shaft resembling an escape tunnel carved into the bedrock, seeming to lead from the tomb. For the first time since at least 1555, on 26 October 2016, marble cladding that protects the supposed burial bed of Jesus was removed. Members of the National Technical University of Athens were present. Initially, only a layer of debris was visible. This was cleared in the next day, and a partially broken marble slab with a Crusader-style cross carved was revealed. By the night of 28 October, the original limestone burial bed was shown to be intact. The tomb was resealed shortly thereafter. Mortar from just above the burial bed was later dated to the mid-fourth century.\n\n2020 pandemic\nOn 25 March 2020, Israeli health officials ordered the site closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the keeper of the keys, it was the first such closure since 1349, during the Black Death. Clerics continued regular prayers inside the building, and it reopened to visitors two months later, on 24 May.\n\nCrusader altar slab discovered (2022)\nDuring church renovations in 2022, a stone slab covered in modern graffiti was moved from a wall, revealing Cosmatesque-style decoration on one face. According to an IAA archaeologist, the decoration was once inlaid with pieces of glass and fine marble; it indicates that the relic was the front of the church's high altar from the Crusader era (c. 1149), which was later used by the Greek Orthodox until being damaged in the 1808 fire.\n\nDescription\nParvis (courtyard)\nThe courtyard facing the entrance to the church is known as the parvis. Two streets open into the parvis: St Helena Road (west) and Suq ed-Dabbagha (east). Around the parvis are a few smaller structures.\nSouth of the parvis, opposite the churchBroken columns—once forming part of an arcade—stand opposite the church, at the top of a short descending staircase stretching over the entire breadth of the parvis. In the 13th century, the tops of the columns were removed and sent to Mecca by the Khwarezmids.\n\nThe Gethsemane Metochion, a small Greek Orthodox monastery (metochion).\nOn the eastern side of the parvis, south to north:\n\nThe Monastery of St Abraham (Greek Orthodox), next to the Suq ed-Dabbagha entrance to the parvis.\nThe Chapel of St John the Evangelist (Armenian Orthodox)\nThe Chapel of St Michael and the Chapel of the Four Living Creatures (both are disputed between the Copts and Ethiopians), giving access to Deir es-Sultan (also disputed), a rooftop monastery surrounding the dome of the Chapel of St Helena.\nNorth of the parvis, in front of the church façade or against it:\n\n Chapel of the Franks (Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows): a blue-domed Roman Catholic Crusader chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, which once provided exclusive access to Calvary. The chapel marks the 10th Station of the Cross (the stripping of Jesus's garments).\nOratory of St. Mary of Egypt: a Greek Orthodox oratory and chapel, directly beneath the Chapel of the Franks, dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt.\nThe tomb (including a ledgerstone) of Philip d'Aubigny (died 1236), a knight, tutor, and royal councillor to Henry III of England and signer of Magna Carta—is placed in front of, and between, the church's two original entrance doors, of which the eastern one is walled up. It is one of the few tombs of crusaders and other Europeans not removed from the Church after the Khwarizmian capture of Jerusalem in 1244. In the 1900s, during a fight between the Greeks and Latins, some monks damaged the tomb by throwing stones from the roof. A stone marker was placed on his tomb in 1925, sheltered by a wooden trapdoor that hides it from view.\nA group of three chapels borders the parvis on its west side. They originally formed the baptistery complex of the Constantinian church. The southernmost chapel was the vestibule, the middle chapel the baptistery, and the north chapel the chamber in which the patriarch chrismated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex. Now they are dedicated as (from south to north)\n\nThe Chapel of St. James the Just (Greek Orthodox),\nThe Chapel of St. John the Baptist (Greek Orthodox),\nThe Chapel of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (Greek Orthodox; at the base of the bell tower).\n\nBell tower\nThe 12th-century Crusader bell tower is just south of the Rotunda, to the left of the entrance. Its upper level was lost in a 1545 collapse. In 1719, another two storeys were lost.\n\nFaçade and entrance\nThe wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved arched doors. Today, only the left-hand entrance is currently accessible, as the right doorway has long since been bricked up. The entrance to the church leads to the south transept, through the crusader façade in the parvis of a larger courtyard. This is found past a group of streets winding through the outer Via Dolorosa by way of a souq in the Muristan. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.\nAccording to their own family lore, the Muslim Nuseibeh family has been responsible for opening the door as an impartial party to the church's denominations already since the seventh century. However, they themselves admit that the documents held by various Christian denominations only mention their role since the 12th century, in the time of Saladin, which is the date more generally accepted. After retaking Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, Saladin entrusted the Joudeh family with the key to the church, which is made of iron and 30 centimetres (12 in) long; the Nuseibehs either became or remained its doorkeepers.\nThe 'immovable ladder' stands beneath a window on the façade.\n\nCalvary (Golgotha)\nJust inside the church entrance is a stairway leading up to Calvary (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus's crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The exit is via another stairway opposite the first, leading down to the ambulatory. Golgotha and its chapels are just south of the main altar of the catholicon.\nCalvary is split into two chapels: one Greek Orthodox and one Catholic, each with its own altar. On the left (north) side, the Greek Orthodox chapel's altar is placed over the supposed rock of Calvary (the 12th Station of the Cross), which can be touched through a hole in the floor beneath the altar. The rock can be seen under protective glass on both sides of the altar. The softer surrounding stone was removed when the church was built. The Roman Catholic (Franciscan) Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (the 11th Station of the Cross) stretches to the south. \nBetween the Catholic Altar of the Nailing to the Cross and the Orthodox altar is the Catholic Altar of the Stabat Mater, which has a statue of Mary with an 18th-century bust; this middle altar marks the 13th Station of the Cross.\n\nOn the ground floor, just underneath the Golgotha chapel, is the Chapel of Adam. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill Adam's skull. Through a window at the back of the 11th-century apse, the rock of Calvary can be seen with a crack traditionally held to be caused by the earthquake that followed Jesus's death; some scholars claim it is the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.\nBehind the Chapel of Adam is the Greek Treasury (Treasury of the Greek Patriarch). Some of its relics, such as a 12th-century crystal mitre, were transferred to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate Museum (the Patriarchal Museum) on Greek Orthodox Patriarchate Street.\n\nStone of Anointing\nJust inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Anointing (also Stone of the Anointing or Stone of Unction), which tradition holds to be where Jesus's body was prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea, though this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian Dominican pilgrim Riccoldo da Monte di Croce in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.\nThe wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and taphos symbol-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre), and is decorated with lamps. The modern mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus's body, preceded on the right by the Descent from the Cross, and succeeded on the left by the Burial of Jesus.\nThe wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the catholicon, sits on top of four of the now empty and desecrated Crusader graves and is no longer structurally necessary. Opinions differ as to whether it is to be seen as the 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and located between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.\nThe lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.\nImmediately inside and to the left of the entrance is a bench (formerly a divan) that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing the staircase leading to Golgotha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.\n\nRotunda and Aedicule\nThe rotunda is the building of the larger dome located on the far west side. In the centre of the rotunda is a small chapel called the Aedicule in English, from the Latin aedicula, in reference to a small shrine. The Aedicule has two rooms: the first holds a relic called the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second, smaller room contains the tomb of Jesus. Possibly to prevent pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, by 1555, a surface of marble cladding was placed on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb. In October 2016, the top slab was pulled back to reveal an older, partially broken marble slab with a Crusader-style cross carved in it. Beneath it, the limestone burial bed was revealed to be intact.\nUnder the Status Quo, the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Apostolic Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the Divine Liturgy or Holy Mass there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the Holy Saturday ceremony of the Holy Fire led by the Greek Orthodox patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs). To its rear, in the Coptic Chapel, constructed of iron latticework, lies the altar used by the Coptic Orthodox. Historically, the Georgians also retained the key to the Aedicule.\nTo the right of the sepulchre on the northwestern edge of the rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.\nThough not within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre compound, directly adjacent to it is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.\n\nCatholicon\nIn the central nave of the Crusader-era church, just east of the larger rotunda, is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon. Its dome is 19.8 metres (65 ft) in diameter, and is set directly over the centre of the transept crossing of the choir where the compas is situated, an omphalos (\"navel\") stone once thought to be the center of the world and still venerated as such by Orthodox Christians (associated with the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection).\nSince 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix, which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Israeli professor Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the church that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.\nThe catholicon's iconostasis demarcates the Orthodox sanctuary behind it, to its east.\nThe iconostasis is flanked to the front by two episcopal thrones: the southern seat (cathedra) is the patriarchal throne of the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, and the northern seat is for an archbishop or bishop. (There is also a popular claim that both are patriarchal thrones, with the northern one being for the patriarch of Antioch – which has been described as a misstatement, however.)\n\nArmenian monastery south of the Aedicule\nSouth of the Aedicule is the \"Place of the Three Marys\", marked by a stone canopy (the Station of the Holy Women) and a large modern wall mosaic. From here one can enter the Armenian monastery, which stretches over the ground and first upper floor of the church's southeastern part.\n\nSyriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea\nWest of the Aedicule, to the rear of the Rotunda, is the Syriac Chapel with the Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, located in a Constantinian apse and containing an opening to an ancient Jewish rock-cut tomb. This chapel is where the Syriac Orthodox celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays.\nThe Syriac Orthodox Chapel of Saint Joseph of Arimathea and Saint Nicodemus. On Sundays and feast days it is furnished for the celebration of Mass. It is accessed from the Rotunda, by a door west of the Aedicule.\n\nFirst-century tomb\nOn the far side of the chapel is the low entrance to an almost complete first-century Jewish tomb, initially holding six kokh-type funeral shafts radiating from a central chamber, two of which are still exposed. Although this space was discovered relatively recently and contains no identifying marks, some believe that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were buried here. Since Jews always buried their dead outside the city, the presence of this tomb seems to prove that the Holy Sepulchre site was outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion.\n\nFranciscan area north of the Aedicule\nThe Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene – The chapel, an open area, indicates the place where Mary Magdalene met Jesus after his resurrection.\nThe Franciscan Chapel of the Apparition (Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament), directly north of the above – in memory of Jesus's meeting with his mother after the Resurrection, a non-scriptural tradition. Here stands a piece of an ancient column, allegedly part of the one Jesus was tied to during his scourging.\n\nArches of the Virgin\nThe Arches of the Virgin are seven arches (an arcade) at the northern end of the north transept, which is to the catholicon's north. \nDisputed by the Orthodox and the Latin, the area is used to store ladders. \nOver the years the Greek-Orthodox patriarchate placed several icons along the arcade. Dating mostly to the 19th century and designed in Orthodox Post-Byzantine style, they were restored in 2021.\n\nPrison of Christ\nIn the northeast side of the complex, there is the Prison of Christ, alleged to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox are showing pilgrims yet another place where Jesus was allegedly held, the similarly named Prison of Christ in their Monastery of the Praetorium, located near the Church of Ecce Homo, between the Second and Third Stations of the Via Dolorosa. The Armenians regard a recess in the Monastery of the Flagellation at the Second Station of the Via Dolorosa as the Prison of Christ. A cistern among the ruins beneath the Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu on Mount Zion is also alleged to have been the Prison of Christ. To reconcile the traditions, some allege that Jesus was held in the Mount Zion cell in connection with his trial by the Jewish high priest, at the Praetorium in connection with his trial by the Roman governor Pilate, and near the Golgotha before crucifixion.\n\nAmbulatory\nThe chapels in the ambulatory are, from north to south: the Greek Chapel of Saint Longinus (named after Longinus), the Armenian Chapel of the Division of Robes, the entrance to the Chapel of Saint Helena, and the Greek Chapel of the Derision.\n\nChapel of Saint Helena\nChapel of Saint Helena – between the Chapel of the Division of Robes and the Greek Chapel of the Derision are stairs descending to the Chapel of Saint Helena. The Armenians, who own it, call it the Chapel of St. Gregory the Illuminator, after the saint who brought Christianity to the Armenians.\n\nChapel of Saint Vartan\nChapel of St Vartan (or Vardan) Mamikonian – on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate wrought iron door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the quarry, and which leads to the Chapel of Saint Vartan. The latter chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are open only on request.\n\nChapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross\nChapel of the Invention of the Cross (named for the Invention (Finding) of the Holy Cross) – another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross, believed to be the place where the True Cross was found.\n\nStatus Quo\nOttoman decrees\nAn Ottoman decree of 1757 helped establish a status quo upholding the state of affairs for various Holy Land sites.\nThe status quo was upheld in Sultan Abdülmecid I's firman (decree) of 1852/53, which pinned down the now-permanent statutes of property and the regulations concerning the roles of the different denominations and other custodians.\nThe primary custodians are the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. The Greek Orthodox act through the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate as well as through the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. Roman Catholics act through the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land. In the 19th century, the Coptic Orthodox, the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Syriac Orthodox also acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures in and around the building.\nNone of these controls the main entrance. In 1192, Saladin assigned door-keeping responsibilities to the Muslim Nusaybah family. The wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved doors. The Joudeh al-Goudia (al-Ghodayya) family were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by Saladin in 1187. Despite occasional disagreements, religious services take place in the Church with regularity and coexistence is generally peaceful. An example of concord between the Church custodians is the full restoration of the Aedicule from 2016 to 2017.\n\nInterdenominational issues\nThe establishment of the modern Status Quo in 1853 did not halt controversy and occasional violence. \nIn 1902, 18 friars were hospitalized and some monks were jailed after the Franciscans and Greeks disagreed over who could clean the lowest step of the Chapel of the Franks. In the aftermath, the Greek patriarch, Franciscan custos, Ottoman governor and French consul general signed a convention that both denominations could sweep it.\nOn a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fight. In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.\nOn Palm Sunday, in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek monk was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers. On Sunday, 9 November 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the Feast of the Cross.\n\nIssues with Israeli authorities\nTax and land disputes\nIn February 2018, the church was closed following a tax dispute over 152 million euros of uncollected taxes on church properties. The city hall stressed that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and all other churches are exempt from the taxes, with the changes only affecting establishments like \"hotels, halls and businesses\" owned by the churches.\nThere was a lock-in protest against an Israeli legislative proposal which would expropriate church lands that had been sold to private companies since 2010, a measure which church leaders assert constitutes a serious violation of their property rights and the Status Quo. In a joint official statement the church authorities protested what they considered to be the peak of a systematic campaign in:\n\na discriminatory and racist bill that targets solely the properties of the Christian community in the Holy Land ... This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe.\nThe 2018 taxation affair does not cover any church buildings or religious related facilities (because they are exempt by law), but commercial facilities such as the Notre Dame Hotel which was not paying the municipal property tax, and any land which is owned and used as a commercial land. The church holds the rights to land where private homes have been constructed, and some of the disagreement had been raised after the Knesset had proposed a bill that will make it harder for a private company not to extend a lease for land used by homeowners. The church leaders have said that such a bill will make it harder for them to sell church-owned lands. According to The Jerusalem Post:\n\nThe stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.\n\nLand sale to Israeli settlers\nIn 2017, NPR reported that the Greek Orthodox Church owns many properties across Jerusalem, Israel and the West Bank. It owns some 30% of the land in the Old City. But, due to property sales, these properties are diminishing every year. The decision to sell is made by Greek leaders, even though most local followers of the church are Arab Palestinians. The Palestinian Christians have raised concerns about selling these properties to Israeli settler-affiliated organizations.\nIn June 2019, a number of Christian denominations in Jerusalem raised their voice against the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the sale of three properties by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to Ateret Cohanim – an organization that seeks to increase the number of Jews living in the Old City and East Jerusalem. The church leaders warned that if the organization gets to control the sites, Christians could lose access to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In June 2022, the Supreme Court upheld the sale and ended the legal battle.\n\nConnection to Roman temple\nThe site of the church had been a temple to Jupiter or Venus built by Hadrian before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had been located there because it was the junction of the main north–south road with one of the two main east–west roads and directly adjacent to the forum (now the location of the Muristan, which is smaller than the former forum). The forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north–south road with the other main east–west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east–west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the Russian Mission in Exile).\nFrom the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. Dan Bahat, the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of Aphrodite (Venus) matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.\n\nLocation\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall, as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean. Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church. In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus's time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since Herod Agrippa (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.\nA recent archeological excavation conducted by Professor Francesca Romana Stasolla, found remains of olive trees and grapevines that are approximately 2,000 years old. These plant remnants, seeds and pollen, were discovered via archaeobotanical analysis performed on soil samples that had been extracted from beneath the stone floor of the church.\nThe area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early first century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated. \nThe church is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Old City of Jerusalem.\nThe Christian Quarter and the (also Christian) Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem are both located in the northwestern and western part of the Old City, due to the fact that the Holy Sepulchre is located close to the northwestern corner of the walled city. The adjacent neighbourhood within the Christian Quarter is called the Muristan, a term derived from the Persian word for hospital – Christian pilgrim hospices have been maintained in this area near the Holy Sepulchre since at least the time of Charlemagne.\n\nInfluence\nFrom the ninth century onward, the construction of churches inspired by the Anastasis was extended across Europe. One example is Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines of Jerusalem.\nSeveral churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been wholly or partially modelled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other holy places for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the Heiliges Grab (\"Holy Tomb\") of Görlitz, constructed between 1481 and 1504, the New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow Oblast, constructed by Patriarch Nikon between 1656 and 1666, and Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery built by the Franciscans in Washington, DC in 1898.\nAuthor Andrew Holt writes that the church was the most important in all Christendom at the time of the Crusades.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nJerusalem, Israel, Petra & Sinai.

          "summary": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre,  also known as the Church of the Resurrection, is a fourth-century church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church is simultaneously the seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and the Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is the holiest site in Christianity and it has been an important pilgrimage site for Christians since the fourth century.\nAccording to traditions dating to the fourth century, the church contains both the site where Jesus was crucified at Calvary, or Golgotha, and the location of Jesus's empty tomb, where he was buried and, resurrected. Both locations are considered immensely holy sites by most Christians. The church and rotunda was built under Constantine the Great in the 4th century and destroyed by al-Hakim in 1009. Al-Hakim's son allowed Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos to reconstruct the church, which was completed in 1048. After it was captured by the crusaders in 1099, it continued to undergo modifications, resulting in a significant departure from the original structure. Several renovations and restorations were made under the Ottomans. The tomb itself is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicule.\nWithin the church proper are the last four stations of the Cross of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of the Passion of Jesus. The church has been a major Christian pilgrimage destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis ('Resurrection').\nThe Status Quo, an understanding between religious communities dating to 1757, applies to the site. Control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Directly adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.",

          "content": "The Western Wall (Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall'; ; Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: HaKosel HaMa'arovi) is an ancient retaining wall of the built-up hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem. Its most famous section, known by the same name, often shortened by Jews to the Kotel or Kosel, is known in the West as the Wailing Wall, and in Arab world and Islamic world as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق, romanized: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq; ['ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq]). In a Jewish religious context, the term Western Wall and its variations is used in the narrow sense, for the section used for Jewish prayer; in its broader sense it refers to the entire 488-metre-long (1,601 ft) retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount.\nAt the prayer section, just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad period, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\nThe Western Wall plays an important role in Judaism due to it being part of the man-made \"Temple Mount\", an artificially expanded hilltop best known as the traditional site of the Jewish Temple. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray outside the Temple Mount platform, because the presumed site of the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, presumably lies just above and behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. The earliest source possibly mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 10th century. The Western Wall, in the narrow sense, i.e. referring to the section used for Jewish prayer, is also known as the \"Wailing Wall\", in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site. During the period of  Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except on Tisha B'Av, the day of national mourning for the Temples. The term \"Wailing Wall\" has historically been used mainly by Christians, with use by Jews becoming marginal. Of the entire retaining wall, the section ritually used by Jews now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of an 8-metre (26 ft) section, the so-called \"Little Western Wall\" or \"Small Wailing Wall\". This segment of the western retaining wall derives particular importance from having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much of the original Herodian stonework. In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century.\nThe entire Western Wall constitutes the western border of al-Haram al-Sharif (\"the Noble Sanctuary\"), or the Al-Aqsa compound. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, the Burāq, on his Night Journey, which tradition connects to Jerusalem, before ascending to heaven. While the wall was considered an integral part of the Haram esh-Sharif and waqf property of the Moroccan Quarter under Muslim rule, a right of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage has long existed as part of the Status Quo regulations. This position was confirmed in a 1930 international commission during the British Mandate period. \nWith the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed, with many more people injured. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish Quarter, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall for 19 years. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.\n\nEtymology\nWestern Wall\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\", but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple. The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet Ahimaaz ben Paltiel.\n\nWailing Wall\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century. The name Mur des Lamentations was used in French and Klagemauer in German. This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the Temple and the loss of national freedom it symbolized.\n\nAl-Buraq Wall\nArab world and Islamic world have associated the name Al-Buraq with the wall at least since the 1860s.\n\nLocation, dimensions, stones\nPrayer section vs. entire wall\nThe term Western Wall commonly refers to a 187-foot (57 m) exposed section of a much longer retaining wall, built by Herod on the western flank of the Temple Mount. Only when used in this sense is it synonymous with the term Wailing Wall. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer.\nIn its entirety, the western retaining wall of the Herodian Temple Mount complex stretches for 1,600 feet (488 m), most of which is hidden behind medieval residential structures built along its length.\nThere are only two other revealed sections: the southern part of the Wall (see Robinson's Arch area), which measures approximately 80 metres (262 ft), and is separated from the prayer area by just a narrow stretch of archaeological remains; and another, much shorter section, known as the Little Western Wall, which is located close to the Iron Gate.\nThe entire western wall functions as a retaining wall, supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE. Herod's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First Temple stood, already widened in Hasmonean times during the Second Temple period, by finally transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount platform visible today.\n\nHeight, courses, building stones\nAt the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at 105 feet (32 m), with the above-ground section standing approximately 62 feet (19 m) high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground. The first seven above-ground layers are from the Herodian period. This section of wall is built from enormous meleke limestone blocks, possibly quarried at either Zedekiah's Cave situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, or at Ramat Shlomo 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northwest of the Old City. Most of them weigh between 2 and 8 short tons (1.8 and 7.3 tonnes) each, but others weigh even more, with one extraordinary stone located slightly north of Wilson's Arch measuring 13.55 metres (44.5 ft) long, 3.3 metres (11 ft) high, approximately 1.8 to 2.5 metres (5.9 to 8.2 ft) deep, and weighing between 250 and 300 tonnes (280 and 330 short tons). Each of these ashlars is framed by fine-chiseled borders. The margins themselves measure between 5 and 20 centimetres (2 and 8 in) wide, with their depth measuring 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in). In the Herodian period, the upper 10 metres (33 ft) of wall were 1 metre (39 in) thick and served as the outer wall of the double colonnade of the Temple platform. This upper section was decorated with pilasters, the remainder of which were destroyed when the Byzantines reconquered Jerusalem from the Persians in 628.\nThe next four courses, consisting of smaller plainly dressed stones, are Umayyad work (8th century, Early Muslim period). Above that are 16 to 17 courses of small stones from the Mamluk period (13th–16th centuries) and later.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and destruction (19 BCE – 70 CE)\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple was built atop what is known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod's great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.\nHerod's Temple was destroyed by the Romans, along with the rest of Jerusalem, in 70 CE, during the First Jewish–Roman War.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods (135–638)\nDuring much of the 2nd–5th centuries of the Common Era, after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself. When the empire started becoming Christian under Constantine I, they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the Tisha B'Av, to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall. The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who wrote in 333 CE, suggests that it was probably to the perforated stone or the Rock of Moriah, \"to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart\". This was because an imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390) and by Jerome in his commentary to Zephaniah written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av. In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress Aelia Eudocia seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple. Permission was granted and they were officially permitted to resettle in Jerusalem.\n\nArchaeology\nDiscovery of underground rooms that could have been used as food storage carved out of the bedrock under the 1,400-year-old mosaic floor of Byzantine structure was announced by Israel Antiquities Authority in May in 2020.\n\"At first we were very disappointed because we found we hit the bedrock, meaning that the material culture, the human activity here in Jerusalem ended. What we found here was a rock-cut system—three rooms, all hewn in the bedrock of ancient Jerusalem\" said co-director of the excavation Barak Monnickendam-Givon.\n\nEarly Muslim to Mamluk period (638–1517)\nSeveral Jewish authors of the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Samuel ben Paltiel (980–1010) gave money for oil at \"the sanctuary at the Western Wall.\" Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote \"In front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court.\" The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship, and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states \"the Western Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than any I have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands.\"\nShortly after Saladin's 1187 siege of the city, in 1193, the sultan's son and successor al-Afdal established the land adjacent to the wall as a charitable trust (waqf). The largest part of it was named after an important mystic, Abu Madyan Shu'aib. The Abu Madyan waqf was dedicated to Maghrebian pilgrims and scholars who had taken up residence there, and houses were built only metres away from the wall, from which they were thus separated by just a narrow passageway, some 4 metres (13 ft) wide.\nThe first likely mention of the Islamic tradition that Buraq was tethered at the site is from the 14th century. A manuscript by Ibrahim b. Ishaq al-Ansari (known as Ibn Furkah, d. 1328) refers to Bab al-Nabi (lit. 'Gate of the Prophet'), an old name for Barclay's Gate below the Maghrebi Gate. Charles D. Matthews however, who edited al-Firkah's work, notes that other statements of al-Firkah might seem to point to the Double Gate in the southern wall.\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nIn 1517, the Turkish Ottomans under Selim I conquered Jerusalem from the Mamluks who had held it since 1250. Selim's son, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, ordered the construction of an imposing wall to be built around the entire city, which still stands today. Various folktales relate Suleiman's quest to locate the Temple site and his order to have the area \"swept and sprinkled, and the Western Wall washed with rosewater\" upon its discovery. According to a legend cited by Moses Hagiz, Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built an oratory for them there, but, as of Purim 1625, Jews were banned from praying on the Temple Mount and only sometimes dared to pray at the Western Wall, for which purpose a special liturgy had been arranged. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, reports that Jews then had access to the wall and would pray there as often as possible.\nOver the centuries, land close to the Wall became built up. Public access to the Wall was through the Moroccan Quarter, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways. In May 1840 a firman issued by Ibrahim Pasha forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall. It also cautioned them against \"raising their voices and displaying their books there.\" They were, however, allowed \"to pay visits to it as of old.\"\nRabbi Joseph Schwarz writing in the mid-19th century records:\n\nThis wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as we have a very old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.\nOver time the increased numbers of people gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.\n\nIn the late 1830s a wealthy Jew named Shemarya Luria attempted to purchase houses near the Wall, but was unsuccessful, as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay who tried to purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s. In 1869 Rabbi Hillel Moshe Gelbstein settled in Jerusalem. He arranged that benches and tables be brought to the Wall on a daily basis for the study groups he organised and the minyan which he led there for years. He also formulated a plan whereby some of the courtyards facing the Wall would be acquired, with the intention of establishing three synagogues—one each for the Sephardim, the Hasidim and the Perushim. He also endeavoured to re-establish an ancient practice of \"guards of honour\", which according to the mishnah in Middot, were positioned around the Temple Mount. He rented a house near the Wall and paid men to stand guard there and at various other gateways around the mount. However, this set-up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment. In 1874, Mordechai Rosanes paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall.\nIn 1887 Baron Rothschild conceived a plan to purchase and demolish the Moroccan Quarter as \"a merit and honor to the Jewish People.\" The proposed purchase was considered and approved by the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Rauf Pasha, and by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini. Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed, the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there, only trees could be planted to beautify the area. Additionally the Jews would not have full control over the area. This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities, including the driving of mules, which would cause a disturbance to worshippers. Other reports place the scheme's failure on Jewish infighting as to whether the plan would foster a detrimental Arab reaction.\n\nIn 1895 Hebrew linguist and publisher Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort to purchase the Western Wall and lost all his assets. The attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I also never came to fruition. In the first two months following the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha, closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure. Probably meant was the \"Great\", rather than the \"Small\" Djemal Pasha.\n\nDecrees (firman)s issued regarding the Wall:\n\nThese firmans were cited by the Jewish contingent at the International Commission, 1930, as proof for rights at the Wall. Muslim authorities responded by arguing that historic sanctions of Jewish presence were acts of tolerance shown by Muslims, who, by doing so, did not concede any positive rights.\n\nBritish rule (1917–1948)\nIn December 1917, Allied forces under Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem from the Turks. Allenby pledged \"that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred\".\nIn 1919 Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann approached the British Military Governor of Jerusalem, Colonel Sir Ronald Storrs, and offered between £75,000 and £100,000 (approx. £5m in modern terms) to purchase the area at the foot of the Wall and rehouse the occupants. Storrs was enthusiastic about the idea because he hoped some of the money would be used to improve Muslim education. Although they appeared promising at first, negotiations broke down after strong Muslim opposition. Storrs wrote two decades later:\n\nThe acceptance of the proposals, had it been practicable, would have obviated years of wretched humiliations, including the befouling of the Wall and pavement and the unmannerly braying of the tragi-comic Arab band during Jewish prayer, and culminating in the horrible outrages of 1929.\nIn early 1920, the first Jewish-Arab dispute over the Wall occurred when the Muslim authorities were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall's upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because the Wall was an ancient relic.\nAccording to Hillel Halkin, in the 1920s, among rising tensions with the Jews regarding the wall, the Arabs ceased using the more traditional name El-Mabka, \"the Place of Weeping\", which related to Jewish practices, and replaced it with El-Burak, a name with Muslim connotations.\nIn 1926 an effort was made to lease the Maghrebi waqf, which included the wall, with the plan of eventually buying it. Negotiations were begun in secret by the Jewish judge Gad Frumkin, with financial backing from American millionaire Nathan Straus. The chairman of the Palestine Zionist Executive, Colonel F. H. Kisch, explained that the aim was \"quietly to evacuate the Moroccan occupants of those houses which it would later be necessary to demolish\" to create an open space with seats for aged worshippers to sit on. However, Straus withdrew when the price became excessive and the plan came to nothing. The Va'ad Leumi, against the advice of the Palestine Zionist Executive, demanded that the British expropriate the wall and give it to the Jews, but the British refused.\nIn 1928 the World Zionist Organization reported that John Chancellor, High Commissioner of Palestine, believed that the Western Wall should come under Jewish control and wondered \"why no great Jewish philanthropist had not bought it yet\".\n\nSeptember 1928 disturbances\nIn 1922, a Status Quo agreement issued by the mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.\n\nOn September 24, 1928, the Day of Atonement, British police resorted to removing by force a screen used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the Haredi Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the Edah HaChareidis and Agudas Yisroel, strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.\nCommissioner Edward Keith-Roach described the screen as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Masjid Al-Aqsa. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that the removal of the screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.\nA widespread Arab campaign to protest against presumed Jewish intentions and designs to take possession of the Al Aqsa Mosque swept the country and a \"Society for the Protection of the Muslim Holy Places\" was established. The Jewish National Council (Vaad Leumi) responding to these Arab fears declared in a statement that \"We herewith declare emphatically and sincerely that no Jew has ever thought of encroaching upon the rights of Moslems over their own Holy places, but our Arab brethren should also recognise the rights of Jews in regard to the places in Palestine which are holy to them.\" The committee also demanded that the British administration expropriate the wall for the Jews.\nFrom October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni organised a series of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.\n\nA British inquiry into the disturbances and investigation regarding the principal issue in the Western Wall dispute, namely the rights of the Jewish worshipers to bring appurtenances to the wall, was convened. The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims. However, repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response. They refused to do so, arguing that Jews had the right to pray at the Wall without restrictions. Subsequently, in November 1928, the Government issued a White Paper entitled \"The Western or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem: Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies\", which emphasised the maintenance of the status quo and instructed that Jews could only bring \"those accessories which had been permitted in Turkish times.\"\nA few months later, Haj Amin complained to Chancellor that \"Jews were bringing benches and tables in increased numbers to the wall and driving nails into the wall and hanging lamps on them.\"\n\n1929 Palestine riots\nIn the summer of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.\nOn August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting \"The Wall is ours.\" The next day, the Jewish fast of Tisha B'Av, 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang Hatikva at the Wall. The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town, and was followed a few days later by the Hebron massacre. One hundred and thirty-three Jews were killed and 339 injured in the Arab riots, and in the subsequent process of quelling the riots 110 Arabs were killed by British police. This was by far the deadliest attack on Jews during the period of British Rule over Palestine.\n\n1930 international commission\nIn 1930, in response to the 1929 riots, the British Government appointed a commission \"to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall\", and to determine the causes of the violence and prevent it in the future. The League of Nations approved the commission on condition that the members were not British.\nThe Commission noted that \"the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it (concluding speech of Jewish Counsel, Minutes, page 908).\"\n\nThe Commission concluded that the wall, and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter, were solely owned by the Muslim waqf. However, Jews had the right to \"free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times\", subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the shofar, which was made illegal. Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means.\nThe recommendations of the Commission were brought into law by the Palestine (Western or Wailing Wall) Order in Council, 1931, which came into effect on June 8, 1931. Persons violating the law were liable to a fine of 50 pounds or imprisonment up to 6 months, or both.\nDuring the 1930s, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution. They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months. The Shaw commission determined that the violence occurred due to \"racial animosity on the part of the Arabs, consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations and fear for their economic future.\"\n\nJordanian rule (1948–1967)\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Old City together with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for a Special Committee to make arrangements for (amongst other things) \"free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\". The committee sat multiple times during 1949, but both sides made additional demands and at the same time the Palestine Conciliation Commission was pressing for the internationalization of Jerusalem against the wishes of both parties. No agreement was ever reached, leading to recriminations in both directions. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories. An exception was made for Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which was not an option for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.\n\n\"Al Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd\" sign\nDuring the Jordanian rule of the Old City, a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached 2.1 metres (6.9 ft) up, it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English \"Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd\" below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it. The Jerusalem Post reported that on June 8, Ben-Gurion went to the wall and \"looked with distaste\" at the road sign; \"this is not right, it should come down\" and he proceeded to dismantle it. This act signaled the climax of the capture of the Old City and the ability of Jews to once again access their holiest sites. Emotional recollections of this event are related by David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres.\n\nFirst years under Israeli rule (1967–1969)\nDeclarations after the conquest\nFollowing Israel's victory during the 1967 Six-Day War, the Western Wall came under Israeli control. Brigadier Rabbi Shlomo Goren proclaimed after its capture that \"Israel would never again relinquish the Wall\", a stance supported by Israeli Minister for Defence Moshe Dayan and Chief of Staff General Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:\n\n\"There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers—under Gur's command—reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping—loudly and in pain—over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of 'Hatikvah'\".\n\nDemolition of the Moroccan Quarter\nForty-eight hours after capturing the wall, the military, without explicit government order, hastily proceeded to demolish the entire Moroccan Quarter, which stood 4 metres (13 ft) from the Wall. The Sheikh Eid Mosque, built on the site of one of Jerusalem's earliest Islamic schools (the Afdiliyyah), was pulled down to make way for the plaza. 106 Arab families consisting of 650 people were ordered to leave their homes at night. When they refused, bulldozers began to demolish the buildings with people still inside, killing one person and injuring a number of others.\nAccording to Eyal Weizman, Chaim Herzog, who later became Israel's sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:\n\nWhen we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return. ... We knew that the following Saturday [sic Wednesday], June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.\nThe narrow pavement, which could accommodate a maximum of 12,000 per day, was transformed into an enormous plaza that could hold in excess of 400,000. Several months later, the pavement close to the wall was excavated to a depth of two and half metres, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.\nA complex of buildings against the wall at the southern end of the plaza, that included Madrasa Fakhriya and the house that the Abu al-Sa'ud family had occupied since the 16th century, were spared in the 1967 destruction, but demolished in 1969. The section of the wall dedicated to prayers was thus extended southwards to double its original length, from 28 to 60 metres (92 to 197 ft), while the 4 metres (13 ft) space facing the wall grew to 40 metres (130 ft).\nThe narrow, approximately 120 square metres (1,300 sq ft) pre-1948 alley along the wall, used for Jewish prayer, was enlarged to 2,400 square metres (26,000 sq ft), with the entire Western Wall Plaza covering 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres), stretching from the wall to the Jewish Quarter.\n\nPlaza\nThe new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks the destruction of the Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.\nIn November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85 million ($23 million) plan to improve access from the Jewish Quarter and upgrade infrastructure at the Wall.\n\nOrthodox rules\nConflicts over prayer at the national monument began a little more than a year after Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, which again made the site accessible to Jews. In July 1968 the World Union for Progressive Judaism, which had planned the group's international convention in Jerusalem, appealed to the Knesset after the Ministry of Religious Affairs prohibited the organization from hosting mixed-gender services at the Wall. The Knesset committee on internal affairs backed the Ministry of Religious Affairs in disallowing the Jewish convention attendees, who had come from over 24 countries, from worshiping in their fashion. The Orthodox held that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues, while the non-Orthodox perspective was that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\"\n\nWilson's Arch area\nArchaeology\nTransformation into worship area\nIn September 1983, U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.\nIn 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its goal was to renovate and restructure the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.\nThe restoration of the men's section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer. A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall. New construction also included a women's section, overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to \"take part in the services held inside under the Arch\" for the first time.\nOn July 25, 2010, a ner tamid, an oil-burning \"eternal light,\" was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall. According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that \"an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple,\" especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.\n\nA number of special worship events have been held since the renovation. They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security.\n\nRobinson's Arch area\nArchaeology\nAt the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.\nThe so-called Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew with a partial and slightly faulty quote from (or paraphrase of) Isaiah 66:14: \"And you will see and your heart will rejoice and their bones like an herb [will flourish]\" (the correct line from Isaiah would read \"... your bones\".) This gave room to various interpretations, some speculating about it being written during a period of hope for Jews. Alternatively, it might be connected to nearby graves. The inscription has tentatively been dated to the 4th–8th century, some extending the possible timespan all the way to the 11th century.\n\nNon-Orthodox worship area\nBecause it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi of the Western Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall. The worship site was inaugurated in 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. A platform has been added in 2013 in order to expand the prayer area.\n\nIn Judaism\nHistory as place of prayer\nJews were banned from Jerusalem by the Roman authorities after the Second Jewish revolt (2nd century CE) and, although there are intermittent accounts of limited 9th of Av services on the Temple Mount, no sources from before the 7th-century Islamic conquest attest to any other Jewish services allowed near the Mount and many report that none were permitted. Sources conflict with regard to the Mount's status under Islamic rule, but Karaite commentator Salmon ben Jeroham (c. 950 CE) reports that Jews were initially granted wide access to the Mount, then restricted to gathering near \"one of its gates\", then banned entirely before his own time.\n\n10th–12th centuries\nHowever, a synagogue was apparently founded by the Western Wall (in the broader sense) shortly after the time of Salmon. The Scroll of Ahimaaz, a historical chronicle written in 1050 CE, describes:Samuel his son arose to replace [Paltiel], and this great man filled his father's place [in c. 980 CE] ... [He] dedicated 20,000 golden  drachmas to the One Who Dwells on High, to entreat the favor of the Rider of Clouds. These were alms for the poor...; oil for the synagogue in the western wall, for [the lamps on] its bema ...This account of Jewish prayer at the edge of the Mount in confirmed by Daniel ben Azariah, who writes (c. 1055 CE) that Jews were then permitted to \"pray near the Mount's gates\".\nIn 1099 CE the Crusader army  captured Jerusalem, killing almost every Jew inside, and banned Jewish pilgrims from approaching the Mount. In his Scroll of Revelation (c. 1125 CE), Abraham bar Hiyya records that:... the Romans who destroyed the Temple in the days of the evil Titus, though they despoiled its sanctuary, never claimed any ownership of the holy Mount or any need to pray there. But ever since the evil  Constantine converted to Christianity, they have begun to make these claims ... Since [1099 CE] the Christians have desecrated the Mount, made the citadel their church, brought their idols within it, and prevented Jews from praying there. Ever since those villains took over the Mount, no Jew has been allowed to enter it, and none are to be found in all Jerusalem.\n\nIn another reversal by c. 1167 CE, during the later Crusader period, the Western Wall was reopened to Jewish prayer. Benjamin of Tudela attests:. . . and the Gate of Jehoshaphat, which faced the Temple in ancient times. There is the Templi Domini, which is the site of the Temple, and on it is a large and very beautiful dome built by Umar bin al-Khataab. Although they come to pray, the gentiles do not bring any images or effigies onto the site. And in front of this place is the western wall, which was one of the walls in the Holy of Holies; this is called the Gate of Mercy and hither come all the Jews to pray before the wall in the courtyard.\n\n17th century\nIn 1625, David Finzi reported to the Jewish leadership of Carpi that:. . . from there we went up to the Temple Mount, passing mundane structures until we reached the peak of the Mount, where once the Temple stood, which was destroyed for our sins. Now a mosque is built upon it, and Jews are prohibited from entering it; only outside it, near the Western Wall, are Jews allowed to gather, and even this only in peaceful times—in difficult times, such as these, the Jewish community has decreed that no one go there.\nBut in the first week of our visit, before this decree, we went all the way in, and kissed it, and I prostrated myself before its base, and there I said the ordered prayers, and also entreated God to bless all the Jews of Carpi ... Though it is called the Western Wall, nothing of the Temple whatever survived the destruction, the looting by thieves, and the construction of the mosque. They built a citadel on the site of the Foundation Stone, surpassingly lovely ...Tensions eventually calmed again. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, records that:Only Muslims are permitted to enter the Mount and not Jews or other peoples, unless they convert to the Muslim faith. They say that not just any faith is worthy of the Mount, and they continually remind us that the Muslims have superseded the Jews in the eyes of God. When we go to pray at the Wall, we press right up against it, like the lover in Song of Songs who \"standeth behind our wall\". On the eve of the New Moon, on Tisha ba'Av, and on other fast days, we go there to pray, and the women to raise their plangent cries, but no one challenges us, and even the qadi who lives there does not object. Though the Arab youths sometimes come to prey on us, they are easily bribed to leave us alone, and if caught by their own elders they are rebuked ... Prayer by the Wall usually meets with God's favor ... . Once in olden times, or so I heard, there was a terrible drought. The Jews declared a day of fasting, and they went with a Torah scroll to the Western Wall to pray, and God answered their prayers so readily that they had to wrap the scroll in their clothes on their return to the synagogue. Every Sabbath morning, after the services at the synagogue, we immediately set off for the Western Wall ... every single one of us, Ashkenazic and Sephardic, old and young ... there we recite those Psalms that mention Jerusalem, and Pitom haQtores, and Aleinu l'Shabeach, and the Kaddish, and we bless those in the diaspora who fundraise for Eretz Yisrael ... .\n\n18th–19th centuries\nThe writings of various travellers in the Holy Land, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs continued to be a place of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, \"used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours.\"\n\n20th–21st centuries\nIn the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.\nThroughout several centuries, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the \"success of His Majesty's and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory.\" On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.\n\nRelation to the Foundation Stone\nIn Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.\n\nPart of the Temple proper\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical King Solomon from the time of the First Temple.\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.\n\nDivine custody\nA 7th-century Midrash refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\", and a 6th-century Midrash mentions how Rome was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.\n\nDivine Presence\nAn 11th-century Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\", and the Zohar (13th century) similarly writes that \"the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall\".\nEighteenth-century scholar Jonathan Eybeschutz writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\". It is told that great Jewish sages, including Isaac Luria and the Radvaz, experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.\n\nKabbalah of the word kotel\nRabbi Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word kotel when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word kotel, meaning wall, is made up of two parts: \"Ko\", which has the numerical value of God's name, and \"Tel\", meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.\n\nRitual\nStatus as a synagogue\nMany contemporary Orthodox scholars rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall to show its sanctity. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.\n\nContact with the Wall\nSome Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.\nIn the past, some visitors would write their names on the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.\n\nBarefoot approach\nThere was once an old custom of removing one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that \"upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...\". Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that \"it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite \"This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven.\" When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear.\" Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.\n\nMourning over the Temple's destruction\nAccording to Jewish Law, one is obliged to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that \"when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord\". Some scholars write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: \"Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed\".\n\nSignificance as place of prayer\nThe Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, \"it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer.\" Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger (1798–1871) writes, making reference to a medieval rabbi, \"since the Theology and ritual Israel's prayers ascend on high there... as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall.\" A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher (1928–2003).\n\nEgalitarian and non-Orthodox prayer\nWhile during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall, conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship. The progressives responded by claiming that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\"\nIn 1988, the small but vocal group called Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of non-Orthodox prayer at the Wall. Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site. After repeated attacks by haredim, in 1989 the Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions.\nA decade on, some commentators called for the closure of the Wall unless an acceptable solution to the controversy was found.\nIn 2003 Israel's Supreme Court upheld the ban on non-Orthodox worship at the Wall, disallowing any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events, given that this area does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The government responded by allocating Robinson's Arch for such purposes.\nThe Robinson's Arch worship site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.\nIn 2012, critics still complained about the restrictions at the Western Wall, saying Israel had \"turned a national monument into an ultra-Orthodox synagogue.\"\nIn April 2013 things came to a head. In response to the repeated arrest of women, including Anat Hoffman, found flouting the law, the Jewish Agency observed 'the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife.\" Jewish Agency leader Natan Sharansky spearheaded a concept that would expand and renovate the Robinson's Arch area into an area where people may \"perform worship rituals not based on the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish tradition.\" The Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there was no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer, prayer according to non-Orthodox custom should be allowed at the Wall, and a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the Wall should not be deemed as disturbing the public order.\n\nOn August 25, 2013, a new 4,480 square foot prayer platform named \"Ezrat Yisrael Plaza\" was completed as part of this plan of facilitating non-Orthodox worship, with access to the platform at all hours, even when the rest of the area's archaeological park is closed to visitors. After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area, the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government-appointed \"pluralist council\" that would include non-Orthodox representatives.\nIn January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and that would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision, although Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar of Jerusalem said creating a mixed-gender prayer section was paramount to destroying the Wall. The Chief Rabbinate said it would create an alternate plan. In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.\n\nPrayer notes\nThere is a much publicised practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of this practice describes Chaim ibn Attar (d. 1743) writing an amulet for a petitioner and instructing him to place it inside the wall. More than a million notes are placed each year and the opportunity to e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations. It has become customary for visiting dignitaries to place notes too.\n\nChabad tefillin stand\nShortly after the Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a stand of the Chabad movement offering phylacteries (tefillin) was erected with permission from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers male visitors the chance to put on tefillin, a daily Jewish prayer ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual Chabad volunteers and an estimated 100,000 male visitors put on tefillin there annually.\n\nIn Islam\nTradition of the place of tethering\nMuslim reverence for the site is derived from the belief that the Islamic prophet Muhammad tied his winged mount Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been suggested for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, which is just inside the wall at the south end of the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi Gate.\nThere are four different locations, along the southern, eastern, and western wall, with gates known successively or simultaneously as the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq.\n\nEarly Muslim vs. Mamluk-period traditions\nUS scholar Charles D. Matthews wrote in 1932 that, based on the work of Muslim authors of the 10th to 11th centuries (the later part of the Early Muslim period), the place where Prophet Muhammad had tethered Buraq and entered the haram was considered at the time to be the Double Gate of the Temple Mount's southern wall. To reach this conclusion, which he shares with Charles Wilson and Guy Le Strange, he analysed the relevant texts by Ibn al-Faqih (903), Ibn Abd Rabbih (913), and mainly by Muqaddasi (985) and Nasir-i-Khusrau (1047). One of the earliest authors who are more ambiguous, opening the possibility of identifying the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq with either the Double or Barclay's Gate, is Burhan ad-Din ibn al-Firkah of Damascus (d. 1329). Another Mamluk-period writer, Mujir ad-Din (1496), is the first one to unambiguously identify Barclay's Gate as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet. However, Mujir ad-Din's work is effectively a rework of earlier texts, with as-Suyuti (1471) being the main source—and he fails to mention that as—Suyuti stated that the Gate of the Inspector, located close to the northern end of the western wall, was also known as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet.\n\nOttoman-period identification\nTo the previously mentioned variations in identification adds yet another gate, the now walled-up Funeral Gate (bab al-jana'iz), just south of the Golden Gate, also known as 'Gate of al-Buraq' and marked as such on a 1864 Temple Mount map by Melchior de Vogüé, based on the 1833 survey by Frederick Catherwood (see Bab al-Rahmah Cemetery at MadainProject.com for a photo and short description).\nWhen a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:\n\nIt is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al-Sharif and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of Abu Madyan, may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.\nCarl Sandreczki, who was charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles Wilson's Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the Hosh (court/enclosure) of al Burâk, \"not Obrâk, nor Obrat\". In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote that \"The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.\"\nThe name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson's 1865 survey, its revised editions of 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn 1922, Hosh al Buraq was the street name specified by the official Pro-Jerusalem Council.\n\nIn Christianity\nSome scholars believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century, there was a purposeful \"transference\" of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, while the sites around the Temple Mount became a refuse dump for Christians. However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices, have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.\n\nIdeological views\nJewish\nMost Jews, religious and secular, consider the wall to be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap.\nIsraeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz referred to the attitude towards the Western Wall as \"idolatry\" and publicly decried the Israelis' triumphalism following the 1967 victory.\nDan Bahat, former district archaeologist of Jerusalem who headed the Western Wall Tunnel excavations in the years 1986–2007, decried in 2018 the transformation of this iconic historical site into a regulated place of worship: \"The Western Wall is sacrosanct. But out of a national monument, it has become a synagogue.\"\n\nIsraeli\nA poll carried out in 2007 by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies indicated that 96% of Israeli Jews were against Israel relinquishing the Western Wall. \nYitzhak Reiter writes that \"the Islamization and de-Judaization of the Western Wall are a recurrent motif in publications and public statements by the heads of the Islamic Movement in Israel.\"\n\nMuslim\nIn December 1973, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated that \"Only Muslims and Christians have holy places and rights in Jerusalem\". The Jews, he maintained, had no rights there at all. As for the Western Wall, he said, \"Another wall can be built for them. They can pray against that\".\n\nPalestinian\nThe Palestinian National Authority's State Information Service (SIS) stated as fact that the Jews did not consider the Wall as a place for worship until after the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917.\nIn 2006, Dr. Hassan Khader, founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia, told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is \"a recent one, which began in the 16th century...not ancient...like the roots of the Islamic connection\".\nThe Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri said in 2007 that \"there never was a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount\" and that \"there is not a single stone with any relation at all to the history of the Hebrews.\"\nIn November 2010, an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall. It stated that \"Al-Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al-Aksa Mosque\" and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration.\n\nAmerican\nWhile recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem, the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people, and has condemned statements that seek to \"delegitimize\" the relationship between Jews and the area in general, and the Western Wall in particular. For example, in November 2010, the Obama administration \"strongly condemned a Palestinian official's claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property.\" The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as \"factually incorrect, insensitive and highly provocative.\"\n\nAdministration\nAfter the 1967 Arab–Israeli war, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz was named the overseer of proceedings at the wall. After Rabbi Getz's death in 1995, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz was given the position. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation is the administrative body put in charge of the Wall.\n\nSee also\nList of artifacts in biblical archaeology\nMughrabi Bridge\nPro–Wailing Wall Committee\nSouthern Wall\nWalls of Jerusalem\nWestern Stone\nWestern Wall camera\nWestern Wall Tunnel\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe political role of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate in the Temple Mount question, Yoel Cohen, from the Jewish Political Studies Review, Volume 11:1–2 (Spring 1999), accessed March 2020.\nOfficial website of the Western Wall Heritage Foundation\nJewish Virtual Library: The Western Wall\nChabad.org: The Shofar and the Wall, 1930\nLiberation of the Temple Mount and Western Wall: Historic Live Broadcast on Voice of Israel Radio, June 7th, 1967 Archived February 1, 2016, at the Wayback Machine\nThe Western Wall Online Archived February 19, 2019, at the Wayback Machine – online services related to the Kotel: Prayer note, Live cam, and Information\nPhotographs\n\nWailing Wall to Western Wall (1960s)\nPhotographs of the Western Wall (Summer 2007)\nGoogle Street View\n\nThe Western Wall on Google Street View",
          "summary": "The Western Wall (Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall'; ; Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: HaKosel HaMa'arovi) is an ancient retaining wall of the built-up hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem. Its most famous section, known by the same name, often shortened by Jews to the Kotel or Kosel, is known in the West as the Wailing Wall, and in Arab world and Islamic world as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق, romanized: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq; ['ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq]). In a Jewish religious context, the term Western Wall and its variations is used in the narrow sense, for the section used for Jewish prayer; in its broader sense it refers to the entire 488-metre-long (1,601 ft) retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount.\nAt the prayer section, just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad period, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\nThe Western Wall plays an important role in Judaism due to it being part of the man-made \"Temple Mount\", an artificially expanded hilltop best known as the traditional site of the Jewish Temple. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray outside the Temple Mount platform, because the presumed site of the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, presumably lies just above and behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. The earliest source possibly mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 10th century. The Western Wall, in the narrow sense, i.e. referring to the section used for Jewish prayer, is also known as the \"Wailing Wall\", in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site. During the period of  Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except on Tisha B'Av, the day of national mourning for the Temples. The term \"Wailing Wall\" has historically been used mainly by Christians, with use by Jews becoming marginal. Of the entire retaining wall, the section ritually used by Jews now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of an 8-metre (26 ft) section, the so-called \"Little Western Wall\" or \"Small Wailing Wall\". This segment of the western retaining wall derives particular importance from having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much of the original Herodian stonework. In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century.\nThe entire Western Wall constitutes the western border of al-Haram al-Sharif (\"the Noble Sanctuary\"), or the Al-Aqsa compound. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, the Burāq, on his Night Journey, which tradition connects to Jerusalem, before ascending to heaven. While the wall was considered an integral part of the Haram esh-Sharif and waqf property of the Moroccan Quarter under Muslim rule, a right of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage has long existed as part of the Status Quo regulations. This position was confirmed in a 1930 international commission during the British Mandate period. \nWith the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed, with many more people injured. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish Quarter, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall for 19 years. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.",

جنوبًا، والمدرسة التنكزية شمالاً، طوله نحو 50م، وارتفاعه يقل عن 20م.\n\nساحة الحائط هي حارة المغاربة\nالساحة التي أمام الحائط حالياً هي مكان حارة المغاربة سابقاً والتي حوت بيوت المسلمين، عند احتلال القدس قام الاحتلال الإسرائيلي بهدم بيوتهم وطردوهم منها عنوة.\n\nالمكانة الدينية\nيعتبر من أشهر معالم مدينة القدس، ولهذا الحائط مكانة كبيرة عند أتباع الديانتين الإسلامية واليهودية. إذ يُذكر في بعض المصادر الإسلامية على أنه الحائط الذي قام الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم بربط البراق إليه في ليلة الإسراء والمعراج.\n\nمكانته عند اليهود\nيعتبر اليهود الحائط الأثر الأخير الباقي من هيكل سليمان. في رأي أغلبية الحاخامين اليهود يكون الدخول إلى الحرم القدسي محظورا على اليهود منذ خراب الهيكل، فلذلك الحائط هو أقرب نقطة من مكان الهيكل التي يمكن لليهود الصلاة فيها حسب الشريعة اليهودية العصرية. وأطلق عليه العرب المقدسيون اسم «حائط المبكى» نسبة إلى الطقوس التي كان اليهود يؤدونها قبالة الحائط حدادًا على خراب هيكل سليمان. \nعلى ما يبدو من تقارير المسافرين اليهود والقرائين، أصبح الحائط مصلى يهوديا مشهورا في بداية القرن السادس عشر، وتعاظمت أهميته في نظر اليهود في القرن التاسع عشر حتى أصبح أهم المعالم اليهودية الدينية في رأي أكثريتهم. في نظر بعض اليهود خاصة الإسرائيليين منهم يعتبر الحائط رمزًا يهوديًا وطنيًا أيضًا.\nقبل القرن السادس عشر، كان اليهود يؤدون صلواتهم وطقوس الحداد على خراب هيكل النبي سليمان في أماكن مختلفة حول الحرم القدسي. أول ذكر لذلك يرد في تقرير لحاج مسيحي من مدينة بوردو زار القدس سنة 333 م. يقول المسافر أن اليهود يحتشدون سنويا أمام حجر قريبة من السور المحد للحرم القدسي ويتفجعون. في كتاب المسافر اليهودي بنيامين من توديلا الذي زار القدس في نهاية القرن الثاني عشر يذكر مصلىً يهوديًا أمام قبة الصخرة يسمى «الحائط الغربي» أو «باب الرحمة». أما التقرير الأول الذي يشير بوضوح إلى المصلى الذي يسمى لدى اليهود الحائط الغربي فهو من 1488 م بقلم الحاخام عبديا من برتانورا.[ما هي؟]\n\nمكانته عند المسلمين\nبالنسبة للمسلمين، يرتبط حائط البراق بقصة الإسراء والمعراج في التاريخ الإسلامي، ومنها جاءت تسمية الحائط حائط البراق نسبة للدابة التي ركبها النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم عند إسرائه ليلا من مكة إلى المسجد الأقصى، حيث ربط البراق في حلقة على هذا الحائط، ودخل إلى المسجد حيث صلى بالأنبياء ثم عُرج به إلى السماوات العلا. وقد ورد في الطبقات الكبرى لابن سعد أن الرسول محمد حُمل على البراق حتى انتهى إلى بيت المقدس، فانتهى البراق إلى موقفه الذي كان يقف في مربطه. كما يعتبره المسلمون جزءا مهما من المسجد الأقصى. وتوارث أهل القدس المسلمون عامة أنه يوجد محل يسمى البراق عند باب المسجد الأقصى المدعو باب المغاربة ويجاوره مسجد البراق ملاصقاً الجدار الغربي للحرم القدسي.\nكما أن هذا الحائط هو أحد جدران المسجد الأقصى الذي يمثل أولى القبلتين وثالث أقدس المساجد عند المسلمين بعد المسجد الحرام في مكة والمسجد النبوي في المدينة المنورة.\n\nالمكانة السياسية\nمنذ الفتح الإسلامي لبيت المقدس، إبان خلافة عمر بن الخطاب، تحولت إدارة الحرم القدسي وما حوله (بما فيها حائط البراق) للمسلمين بما فيها ذلك فترات الاحتلال الصليبي.\nفي أيام الدولة العثمانية، سمحت السلطات العثمانية لليهود المقدسيين أداء بعض الطقوس الدينية قبال الحائط ولكنها حظرتهم من حط المقاعد قبال الحائط أو أية مبادرة أخرى لجعل المكان مصلى يهوديا دائما. في 1887 قام أدموند دي روتشيلد، من يهود فرنسا، بمحاولة فاشلة لشراء الحائط وجعله ملكا يهوديا. هذه المحاولة عارضها الحاخامون المقدسيون خشية من هز العلاقات بين اليهود والسلطات الإسلامية.\nفي تاريخ 12 نوفمبر 1911 قام متولي الأوقاف أبو مدين الغوث بالاحتجاج حين قام أفراد من الطائفة اليهودية، الذين جرت عادتهم بزيارة الحائط وقوفًا، بجلب كراسي للجلوس عليها أثناء الزيارة. وطلب متولي الأوقاف ايقاف هذه الحالة تجنباً لادعاء اليهود في المستقبل بملكية المكان. وبناءً على ذلك أصدر مجلس إدارة لواء القدس تعليمات تنظم زيارة اليهود للحائط، وتمنع جلب أي مقاعد أو ستائر عند الحائط. بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الأولى واعتماداً على وعد بلفور الذي يعد بإقامة وطن قومي لليهود في فلسطين، أخذ اليهود يسعون إلى اكتساب حقوق واسعة لهم في هذا المكان عن طريق تغيير الحالة الراهنة التي كان عليها الحائط قبل الحرب.\nفي يناير 1914 قام الأديب اليهودي دافيد يالين بمبادرة أخرى لشراء الحائط. في رسالة للسفير الأمريكي لدى إسطنبول قال يالين: «نأمل أن تفعل كل ما بوسعك لتحرير أقدس الأماكن من بين جميع الأماكن المقدسة في المدينة التي كانت من قبل أروع المدن». في هذه الرسالة قدر يالين ثمن الحائط بمليون فرانك فرنسي على الأقل. فشلت هذه المبادرة كما فشلت المحاولة التي سبقتها.\nوعندما وضع صك الانتداب على فلسطين الذي صودق عليه من قبل عصبة الأمم في 24 يوليو 1922 تضمنت مواده الثمانية والعشرون عددًا من المواد المتعلقة بالأماكن المقدسة كان أهمها المادة 14التي تنص على ما يلي:\n«تؤلف الدولة المنتدبة لجنة خاصة لدرس وتحقيق وتقرير الحقوق والادعاءات المتعلقة بالأماكن المقدسة والحقوق والادعاءات المتعلقة بالطوائف الدينية المختلفة في فلسطين وتعرض طريقة اختيار هذه اللجنة وقوامها ووظائفها على مجلس عصبة الأمم لإقرارها ولا تعين اللجنة ولا تقوم بوظائفها دون موافقة المجلس المذكور.»\nلكن هذه اللجنة لم تعين. وطوال السنوات 22، 23، 25، 26، 28، كان هناك محاولات يهودية لجلب مقاعد عند الحائط لكنهم في عام 1928 حاولوا استخدام خزانة ومصابيح وحصر وستائر للفصل بين الرجال والنساء، وأرسل مفتي فلسطين رسائل إلى حاكم القدس ينبهه إلى تلك المخالفات، وصدرت التعليمات من الإدارة المنتدبة في أكثر من موقف بمنع اليهود من جلب كراسي أو ستائر إلى الحائط. عينت اللجنة سابقة الذكر في عام 1930 بعد أن أوصت لجنة التحقيق في أسباب انتفاضة البراق عام 1929 بسرعة تعيينها.\n\nالكتاب الأبيض\nفي سنة 1928 صدر كتاب أبيض من الحكومة البريطانية برقم 3229 مؤيداً المحافظة على الحالة الراهنة داعياً اليهود والمسلمين إلى عقد اتفاق فيما بينهم لتحديد حقوقهم وواجباتهم في الأماكن المقدسة.\nلكن الاتفاق لم يحدث، فطلبت الحكومة من الطرفين ابراز ما لديهما من مستندات لتتمكن من الفصل في الموضوع فقدم المجلس الإسلامي ما لديه من مستندات، لكن الجهة اليهودية المسؤولة لم تقدم أية مستندات واكتفت بإرسال بحث فقهي عن الموضوع.\nوفي هذا الجو المتوتر صدرت قرارات المؤتمر الصهيوني السادس عشر الذي عقد في زيورخ من 28 يوليو إلى 11 أغسطس 1929 والتي كان من أهمها المطالبة بفتح أبواب فلسطين على مصراعيها لليهود، وبذل الجهود لحمل الحكومة البريطانية على سحب كتابها الأبيض لعام 1928 الذي اعترف بحقوق المسلمين في الأماكن المقدسة كما عقد فور انتهاء المؤتمر الصهيوني أول اجتماع للوكالة اليهودية التي جمعت الصهاينة واليهود. وتابعت لجنة الدفاع اليهودية عن المبكى نداءاتها المقلقة لإثارة يهود العالم إلى أن يعاد إليهم حائط المبكى.\n\nأسباب النزاع\nيقول اليهود أن الحائط جزء من الهيكل، قيام اليهود بالبكاء والنواح عنده في العصور المتأخرة، على خلفية ادعاءات متفرقة منها أن الحائط المذكور، هو جزء من بقايا معبدهم القديم، وهو ما تدحضه المعطيات التاريخية ونتائج التنقيبات عن الآثار، فالموسوعة اليهودية تقول إن اليهود لم يصلّوا أمام هذا الحائط إلا في العهد العثماني. يذهب عالم الآثار اليهودي فينكلشتاين -رئيس قسم الآثار في جامعة تل أبيب- هو يقول: «لا يوجد أي سند (يعني أي سند علمي) لما ورد في العهد القديم بشأن حائط المبكى)» ويذهب إلى أبعد من ذلك بتشكيكه بوجود الهيكل أصلا.\nومن جهة أخرى، إذ ليس هناك أي أثر يثبت وجود الهيكل اليهودي أو ما يمكن أن يمت إليه بصلة، وأن علماء الآثار والمنقبين اليهود أنفسهم أو الذين استقدمهم اليهود وصلوا إلى صخرة الأساس في المكان ولم يعثروا على أي دليل مادي مهما كان صغيراً يؤكد صحة الروايات اليهودية.\nبالنسبة للمسلمين والمقدسيين لا يعدو الأمر أن يكون عملية انتحال مكشوفة يقوم بها اليهود والصهاينة، تنطوي على نسبة الحائط إلى تاريخهم. فهم يرون أن العملية هي استيلاء على المكان دون أي وجه حق، لا فرق في ذلك بين انتزاع ملكية الأراضي من الفلسطينيين وتهجيرهم من بلادهم بالقوة الغاشمة، وبين اغتصاب حائط البراق الذي يعد ملكا إسلامياً ومعلماً بارزاً من معالم الحرم القدسي.\n\nالوضع الحالي\nفي 1948 دخلت قوات المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية الجزء الشرقي من مدينة القدس ومنعت اليهود الإسرائيليين من أداء الصلاة أمام الحائط. في حرب يونيو 1967 احتلت إسرائيل البلدة من الأردن فقررت الحكومة الإسرائيلية توسيع الساحة المجاورة للحائط. لهذه الغاية هدمت حي المغاربة الذي كان يوجد قبالة الحائط.\n\nالشعائر المقامة فيه\nبركات الشمس : هو عيد يهودي ترجع أصوله لكتاب التلمود حيث يوصف فيه بأنه اليوم الذي ترجع خلاله الشمس إلى المكان الذي كانت تشغله عندما قام الله بخلق الكون.\nبركات هارون\n\nمقالات ذات صلة\nقائمة الجدران\n\nهوامش\nمقالات ذات صلة\nثورة البراق\n\nعلى

          "content": "The Mount of Olives or Mount Olivet (Hebrew: הַר הַזֵּיתִים, romanized: Har ha-Zeitim; Arabic: جبل الزيتون, romanized: Jabal az-Zaytūn; both lit. 'Mount of Olives'; in Arabic also الطور, Aṭ-Ṭūr, 'the Mountain') is a mountain ridge in East Jerusalem, east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City. It is named for the olive groves that once covered its slopes. The southern part of the mount was the Silwan necropolis, attributed to the elite of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. The western slopes of the mount, those facing Jerusalem, have been used as a Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the tradition of Jewish cemeteries. Atop the hill lies the Palestinian neighbourhood of At-Tur, a former village that is now part of East Jerusalem.\nSeveral key events in the life of Jesus, as related in the Gospels, took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the Acts of the Apostles it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and Mary, the mount has been a site of Christian worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage.\n\nGeography and geology\nThe Mount of Olives is one of three peaks of a mountain ridge which runs for 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) just east of the Old City of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley, in the area called the Valley of Josaphat. The peak to its north is Mount Scopus, at 826 metres (2,710 feet), while the peak to its south is the Mount of Corruption (or the Mount of Offence), at 747 m (2,451 ft). \nThe Mount of Olives itself also consists of three distinct peaks. The middle peak has a double summit: its eastern top contains the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension and an Islamic maqam, while its western top supports the Palestinian town of At-Tur and the Chapel of the Ascension, at 818 m (2,684 ft). The southern head is topped by the Church of the Pater Noster complex. The northern head is known as \"Kurm es Saiad,\" or the Vineyard of the Hunter, and contains the Viri Galilaei Church.\nThe ridge is formed of oceanic sedimentary rock from the Late Cretaceous and contains a soft chalk and a hard flint. While the chalk areas are easily quarried, they are not a suitable strength for construction and features many man-made burial caves. The ridge acts as a watershed, and its eastern side is the beginning of the Judean Desert.\n\nHistory\nFrom Biblical times until the present, Jews have been buried on the Mount of Olives. The necropolis on the southern ridge, the location of the modern village of Silwan, was the burial place of Jerusalem's most important citizens in the period of the Biblical kings.\nThe religious ceremony marking the start of a new month was held on the Mount of Olives during the Second Temple period. During the time of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix (52–60 CE), a Jewish prophetic figure known as \"the Egyptian\" gathered his followers atop the Mount of Olives in preparation for an invasion of the city or in the belief that he would cause the walls of Jerusalem to fall, allowing them to enter (depending on the version). This group was crushed by the Romans. While \"the Egyptian\" managed to flee, many of his followers were killed or taken captive, and the remainder escaped.\nRoman soldiers from the 10th Legion camped on the mount during the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews celebrated the festival of Sukkot on the Mount of Olives. They made pilgrimages to the Mount of Olives because it was 80 meters higher than the Temple Mount and offered a panoramic view of the Temple site. It became a traditional place for lamenting the Temple's destruction, especially on Tisha B'Av. In 1481, an Italian Jewish pilgrim, Meshullam of Volterra, wrote: \"And all the community of Jews, every year, goes up to Mount Zion on the day of Tisha B'Av to fast and mourn, and from there they move down along Yoshafat Valley and up to Mount of Olives. From there they see the whole Temple (the Temple Mount) and there they weep and lament the destruction of this House.\"\nIn 1189, in the wake of the 1187 Battle of Hattin and reconquest of the land by Saladin, the sultan gave the Mount to two of his commanders.\nIn the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the mount.\nPrime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin asked to be buried on the Mount of Olives near the graves of Etzel members Meir Feinstein and Moshe Barazani, rather than Mount Herzl national cemetery.\n\nStatus since 1948\nThe armistice agreement signed by Israel and Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War called for the establishment of a Special Committee to negotiate developments including \"free access to the holy sites and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\". However, during the 19 years the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank lasted, the committee was not formed. Non-Israeli Christian pilgrims were allowed to visit the mount, but Jews of all countries and most non-Jewish Israeli citizens were barred from entering Jordan and therefore were unable to travel to the area.\nBy the end of 1949, and throughout the Jordanian rule of the site, some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks.\n\nState of Israel\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War restoration work was done and the cemetery was reopened for burials. Tombs in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery have been prone to vandalism, among them the tombs of the Gerrer Rebbe and Menachem Begin.\nIsrael's 1980 unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem was condemned as a violation of international law and ruled null and void by the UN Security Council in UNSC Resolution 478.\nOn 6 November 2010, an international watch-committee was set up by Diaspora Jews with the aim of reversing the desecration of the Jewish cemetery. According to one of the founders, the initiative was triggered by witnessing tombstones that were wrecked with \"the kind of maliciousness that defies the imagination.\"\n\nReligious significance\nHebrew Bible references\nDavid and Absalom\nThe Mount of Olives is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Absalom\n(II Samuel 15:30): \"And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up.\" The ascent was probably east of the City of David, near the village of Silwan.\n\nSite of \"the glory of the Lord\"\nThe sacred character of the mount is alluded to in the Book of Ezekiel (11:23): \"And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.\"\n\n\"Mount of Corruption\"\nThe biblical designation \"Mount of Corruption,\" \"Mount of Ruination\" or \"Mount of Offense,\" or in Hebrew Har HaMashchit (הר־המשחית), derives from the idol worship there, begun by King Solomon building altars to the gods of his Moabite and Ammonite wives on the southern peak, \"on the mountain which is before (east of) Jerusalem\" (1 Kings 11:7), just outside the limits of the holy city. This site was known for idol worship throughout the First Temple period, until King Josiah finally destroyed \"the high places that were before Jerusalem, to the right of Har HaMashchit...\"(II Kings 23:13).\n\nApocalypse, resurrection, and burials\nAn apocalyptic prophecy in the Book of Zechariah states that YHWH will stand on the Mount of Olives and the mountain will split in two, with one half shifting north and one half shifting south (Zechariah 14:4). According to the Masoretic Text, people will flee through this newly formed valley to a place called Azal (Zechariah 14:5). The Septuagint (LXX) has a different reading of Zechariah 14:5 stating that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King Uzziah's reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in Antiquities of the Jews that the valley in the area of the King's Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake. Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archeologist in Palestine, theorized that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal. This evidence accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5, which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. The valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies south of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.\nMany Jews have wanted to be buried on the Mount of Olives since antiquity, based on the Jewish tradition (from the Biblical verse Zechariah 14:4) that when the Messiah comes, the resurrection of the dead will begin there. There are an estimated 150,000 graves on the Mount. Notable rabbis buried on the mount include Chaim ibn Attar and others from the 15th century to the present day. Tradition wrongly identifies Roman-period tombs at the foot of the mount as those of Zechariah and Absalom, and a burial complex of the same period on the upper slope as the Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.\n\nNew Testament references\nThe Mount of Olives is frequently mentioned in the New Testament as part of the route from Jerusalem to Bethany and the place where Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin).\nJesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24–25), including the Olivet Discourse, returning after each day to rest (Luke 21:37, and John 8:1 in the additional section of John's Gospel known as the Pericope Adulterae), and also coming there on the night of his betrayal. At the foot of the Mount of Olives lies the Garden of Gethsemane. The New Testament tells how Jesus and his disciples sang together – \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives\" Gospel of Matthew 26:30. Jesus ascended to heaven from the Mount of Olives according to Acts 1:9–12.\n\nGnostic references\nAgain, the story of Jesus with his disciples on the Mount of Olives can be found in the Gnostic text Pistis Sophia, dated around the 3rd to 4th century CE.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks at the top of the Mount of Olives include the Augusta Victoria Hospital with the Lutheran Church of the Ascension and its massive 50-metre (160 ft) bell tower, the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension with its tall and slender bell tower, the Mosque or Chapel of the Ascension, the Church of the Pater Noster, and the Seven Arches Hotel. On the western slope are the historic Jewish cemetery, the Tomb of the Prophets, the Catholic Church of Dominus Flevit, and the Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalene. At the foot of the mount, where it meets the Kidron Valley, there is the Garden of Gethsemane with the Church of All Nations. Within the Kidron Valley itself are the Tomb of the Virgin Mary, the Grotto of Gethsemane, and the nearby tomb of the medieval historian Mujir ed-Din, and further south are the tombs of Absalom (Hebrew name: Yad Avshalom), the Hezir priestly family and of Zechariah. At the northern margin of Mount Olivet stand the Mormon University with the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden and the Jewish settlement of Beit Orot, bordering on the Tzurim Valley and the Mitzpe Hamasu'ot ('Beacons Lookout') site, where the Temple Mount Sifting Project facilities are located. What lays north of here belongs to Mount Scopus. On the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives lies the Palestinian Arab village of al-Eizariya, identified with the ancient village of Bethany mentioned in the New Testament; a short distance from the village centre, towards the top of the mount, is the traditional site of Bethphage, marked by a Franciscan church.\nThe construction of the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies, better known locally as the Mormon University, owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) near the Tzurim Valley which separates the Mount of Olives from Mount Scopus, initially sparked controversy because of concerns that the Mormons would engage in missionary activities. After the Mormons pledged not to proselytize in Israel, work on the building was allowed to proceed.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMount of Olives Jewish Cemetery\nBeit Orot, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nMa'ale ha-Zeitim, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nOlivet (disambiguation)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Mount of Olives at Wikimedia Commons\nMount of Olives website\nHar Hazeitim website\nInteractive Panoramas of the Mount of Olives – jerusalem360.com, GoJerusalem.com\n\"Olives, Mount of\" .

          "content": "## Overview\nThe Old City of Jerusalem (Hebrew: העיר העתיקה, Ha'Ir Ha'Atiqah, Arabic: البلدة القديمة, al-Balda al-Qadimah) is that part of Jerusalem surrounded by the impressive 16th-century Ottoman city walls and representing the heart of the city both historically and spiritually. In a city already divided, the Old City is further divided culturally and historically into four residential Quarters: (clockwise from the southeast) the Jewish, Armenian, Christian, and Muslim Quarters. A fifth area, the Temple Mount/Haram esh-Sharif, contains the Dome of the Rock, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and other Muslim religious sites, and was once the site of the Jewish Temple. The whole Old City is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n## Understand\nThe core of Jerusalem, the Old City, has a history that stretches back more than 3,000 years. The present street plan dates largely from Byzantine times, with the walls and ramparts dating back to the 16th century. The crossroad of three continents, Jerusalem has been one of the most fought over cities in human history. Within the walls, the Old City is divided into four vaguely defined quarters: Christian, Armenian, Jewish and Muslim.\nYou do not need to be Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, or even be overly concerned with religion, to be overwhelmed. With archaeology dating back to the time of the Bible, anyone with a sense of history, spirituality or the human species should be absorbed by the tremendous weight of human civilization that cloaks nearly every part of the city. It is an inhabited, living city - not a deserted museum or monument. Humanity's passion play has been constant revival at this location for most of the length of recorded history.\n\n## Get in\nThe Old City is surrounded by a wall built in the first half of the 16th century by the Ottoman Turk, Suleyman the Magnificent. The 4-km (2.5-mile) circuit is accessed by eight gates, of which seven remain in current use. The gates are, in clockwise order starting in the west:\n\n## By light rail\nThe Jerusalem Municipality usually recommends light rail as the best way to get to the Old City, particularly on holidays when there are many visitors. Each station is about a two-minute walk from the Old City walls.\n31.77944735.2241941 City Hall (העיריה) is the closest station to Jaffa Gate and the New Gate. It should be used for the Christian, Armenian and Jewish Quarters.\n31.78238435.2278332 Damascus Gate (שער שכם) station is the closest to the Damascus Gate. It should be used for the Muslim and Christian quarters.\n\n## By bus\n1: Central Bus Station - Sarei Yisrael - Malchei Yisrael (Geulah) - Meah Shearim - Damascus Gate - Western Wall\n2: Mamilla - Jewish Quarter Parking lot - Western Wall - Mamilla. A \"Touristic\" bus with a circular route that serves the tourist spots in the Old City and nearby it.\n3: Central Bus Station - Kiryat Mattersdorf - Sorotzkin - Kiryat Tzanz - Ezrat Torah - Shmuel HaNavi - Damascus Gate - Western Wall\n38: Jewish Quarter Parking lot - First Station - King George St - Davidka Square - Mamilla - Jewish Quarter Parking lot.\n83: Western Wall - Mount Olives neighbourhood\n218: Ramallah/Al-Bireh - Qalandia - Beit Hanina - (almost) Herod's Gate\n231: Bethlehem/Beit Jala - Talpiot - Jaffa Gate - Damascus Gate\nOther East Jerusalem - buses with blue stripes all terminate near the Damascus Gate; buses with green stripes all terminate 2 minutes walk from Herod's Gate.\n\n## By car\nIf you arrive by car, be aware of the limited parking space. The streets outside the Old City walls are usually reserved for buses and taxicabs; parking of private cars is prohibited.\n31.7766435.226353 Karta parking garage. The simplest parking option. In the Mamilla district next to Jaffa Gate. Entrance to the garage is from Yitshak Kariv street.\n31.7637535.224914 First Station parking lot. Su-Th 08:00-20:00 (on M & Th from 07:00). There is a free shuttle bus service from here to Dung Gate (closest gate to the Western Wall). Shuttle operation has been erratic since the beginning of Covid, but if it's not running you can take the 38 or 83 city bus from the nearby traffic circle to Dung Gate. ₪16.80 for the whole day.\n\n## With a private guide\nThere's no doubt that Jerusalem is overwhelming not to mention scattered. If you only have a day or two to see the city and you'd like to visit many places in a short time, hiring a local private guide that has his own van might be the right thing for you instead of dealing with a rented car & parking for those days. (Note that there is virtually no vehicular access to the Old City, which is most conveniently accessed on foot and is within walking distance of many hotels in the New City.) However, when choosing a guide, try to ask the right questions and advise him/her with a plan that will fit your interest. You'll know the person is a good private tour guide if they will tailor a tour according to your needs.\n\n## Get around\nThe Old City is fairly diminutive in size compared to modern-day Jerusalem. Despite its small size, or perhaps because of it, the Old City is amazing. Much of the Old City is accessible only by walking because of very narrow streets and steps in the road. This is not a great inconvenience because the Old City is only about 1 kilometer across. The Old City is a maze of twisty alleyways and it's difficult to keep your bearings even with a map. Then again, getting lost is half the fun—you can't get too lost due to its size. Thought should be given to footwear, as the roads and paths are uneven stone and thin-soled shoes or spike heels could become uncomfortable.\nNote: The Old City contains many small alleys and tiny streets that often do not appear in guidebooks and street maps. Major roads are almost always signed, so do not simply rely on the map and take the next left/right as it may not be the road you are looking for.\n\n## Jewish Quarter\nAsk if there is a discount or ask for the 'harova' discount. This is for people who are living or staying inside the Old City, but merchants don't know where you are staying or how long you have been here.

It is the site of the First and Second Temples from the Jewish and Christian Bible. The site's massive rectangular platform (of which the Western Wall is one wall) was built by Herod the Great. Now the site is a showcase for Islamic architecture and design from the Umayyad to Ottoman times, and is an important religious and educational center for Muslims to the present. Encompassing over 35 acres of fountains, gardens, buildings and domes, it is crowned by the magnificent Dome of the Rock, which stands on the site of the ancient Jewish Temples.\nEntering the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif) for non-Muslims is through an elevated wooden walkway leading to a gate called Mughrabi Gate (Moor's Gate), on the south-eastern corner of the Western Wall Plaza in the Jewish Quarter. The entry to the Temple Mount itself (not the mosques) is allowed to non-Muslims only at certain hours and is free of charge (see the caution note above).\nSome rabbis consider it forbidden or at the very least religiously unadvisable to enter the Temple Mount as the Holy of Holies is/was somewhere on the Mount. While the Temple stood, this area was off-limits to anybody not a priest of the Temple (and even they could only enter it at certain periods). As the protection of the Holy of Holies was – according to that view – never revoked, one could accidentally blaspheme by standing in the wrong place. However, there are also Jews who disagree with that view or who claim to know where the Holy of Holies is/was or who do not care about the religious implications. Nevertheless, it is better to know and make an informed choice.\nIt is hard to see the majestic buildings on the Temple Mount from the rest of the Old City (unless you know a local inhabitant who lets you onto their roof). An alternative is to look across from the Mount of Olives.\nThe sights of the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif) which are permitted only to Muslims:\n31.77805635.23527838 Dome of the Rock. (Arabic: Qubbat Al-Sakhra, Hebrew: Kippat HaSela), located in the middle of the sanctuary opposite of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, is probably the most dazzling and well-known landmark of Jerusalem, with its golden dome and octagonal blue walls adorned with calligraphy of Quranic verses. The Dome was built between 687-691 by the ninth Omayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, atop the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple. The Dome is probably the most spectacular building in the Old City, thanks to a renovation in which dazzling gold donated by the King of Jordan in 1993 was layered over the bronze. Despite common conceptions, the Dome is not a mosque, but a shrine which protects beneath its high ceiling a large piece of rock sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. The rock is variously believed to be the \"Foundation Stone\" from which the world was created, where Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son (Isaac or Ishmael, depending on the tradition), where Mohammad left the Earth on his Night Journey (a small indentation was reportedly left by his foot), and the site of Solomon and Herod's Temples.\n31.77638935.23555639 al-Aqsa Mosque. The point from where Mohammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. This association has made the building the third-holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina. Construction of the mosque began less than 20 years after the completion of the Dome of the Rock. Al-Aqsa has undergone many changes since its original construction. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in the 11th century, al-Aqsa became the headquarters of the Templars. The mosque's design pales in comparison to the Dome of the Rock and is permanently off-limits to non-Muslim visitors.\n31.7758435.2347840 Museum of Islamic Art (Southwest corner of the Temple Mount). Housed in the Crusader-era refectory of the Knights Templar, this filled museum contains wonderful Islamic architectural remnants. An admission is required, but it is recommended that guests interested in Islamic art visit the LA Mayer Museum in the new city.\n31.77638935.23694441 Solomon's Stables (El-Marwani Mosque) (Southeast corner of Temple Mount).\n31.77888935.23694442 Golden Gate Interior. on the east wall of the Temple Mount/Haram esh-Sharif. According to Jewish tradition the Messiah will arrive in the Temple via this gate, and according to Christian tradition Jesus entered through this gate on Palm Sunday. Closed by the Muslims in 810, reopened in 1102 by the Crusaders, it was walled up by Saladin after regaining Jerusalem in 1187. Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt it together with the city walls, but walled it up in 1541, and it stayed that way until today.\n\n## Do\n31.7766935.227661 Ramparts Walk. Visitors can walk along two sections of the Old City wall, from Jaffa Gate clockwise to St Stephen's Gate, and counter-clockwise from Jaffa Gate to the Dung Gate. The northern route starts from inside the old city by the Jaffa gate and circles the Christian quarter and the Muslim quarter. The southern route starts from outside the Jaffa gate and circles the Armenian quarter and the Jewish quarter. Access to the ramparts is only possible at Jaffa and Damascus gates, although walkers can descend at any gate. Hours are 09:00–16:00 (14:00 on Fridays) daily. Wear shoes suitable for hiking, as the ramparts are quite bumpy. ₪16 adults, ₪8 students & children.\n\n## Buy\n31.7767235.228781 David street (Starts in the square outside the Tower of David, near Jaffa Gate). The most interesting market for tourists, full of Middle Eastern goods as well as souvenirs appealing to members of various religions.\n31.7751835.230972 Cardo. The most prestigious shopping precinct in the Jewish Quarter. Built on the excavated remains of late Roman era Jerusalem (many of which can still be seen), the shops here specialise in arts and crafts, jewelry, Judaica, Dead Sea beauty products, quality souvenirs and T-shirts, among other things. But souvenirs here tend to be significantly more pricey than elsewhere in the Old City.\nSouk Khan al-Zeit and El-Wad streets are the main arteries of the Muslim Quarter. Souk Khan al-Zeit begins just east of the Muristan while El-Wad begins at the outlet of the tunnel to the Western Wall Plaza, with both leading north towards the Damascus gate. While these streets contain numerous souvenir shops and cafes catering to tourists, the majority of shops serve the local population. Butchers, Western clothing stores, hardware shops, and groceries can be found throughout the area.\nThe Suq El Attaria is the primary shopping area in the Arab quarters of the Old City. You will find shops ranging from souvenirs to greengrocers to traditional clothing.\nThe lanes and alleys in and near the Christian quarter abound in shops displaying icons and other churchy items. The quality ranges from kitsch to alright - and prices are mostly grossly inflated. Credit card scams are not unknown. Shop proprietors are seasoned masters at gentle but effective commercial manipulation - inviting bypassing tourists into their shops, involving them in innocuous conversation and directing them into 'you must buy this' situations.\nThe Old City of Jerusalem is known for its Armenian ceramics. With white and a rich blue as the base colors, and bright paintings on them, they are a distinct souvenir. The street signs throughout the old quarter are made of Armenian ceramics, and a few shops will produce custom nameplates and tile signs with a short turnaround time. Ceramics from Hebron are also popular with tourists.\nPrices for snacks, water, and other drinks are inflated in the Jewish Quarter and near the Jaffa gate and the Muristan. As you move closer to Damascus Gate you can find 1.5-liter bottles of water for ₪5, while a 0.5-liter bottle may cost you as much as ₪9 in the more touristy areas.\n\n## Eat\nThe Old City tempts the taste buds with Arabic, Jewish, Mediterranean and International fare. Visitors on the go can grab food from street vendors, while those desiring a more formal meal can find numerous restaurants scattered throughout each quarter.\nCommon appetizers and quick treats may include Kibbe, an oval-shaped croquette of cracked wheat filled with meat and onions; Hummos, a chickpea paste with olive oil; Tabuleh, finely-chopped parsley with tomato and cucumber; and Tahini, a sesame seed paste with parsley, oil and garlic.\nMain dishes usually consist of lamb or chicken meat with occasional beef, but never pork. Meats can be cooked in a variety of ways, but is most often cooked on a spit. Take-away restaurants offer favorites like falafel (deep-fried balls of mashed chickpeas) and shwarma (lamb grilled on a spit and eaten in flat bread).\nDessert options range from exotic or citrus fruits to sticky, sweet Middle Eastern confections. Baklava is a layered pastry filled with powdered pistachio and covered in honey or syrup. Kanafeh, a recipe that differs throughout the Middle East, is served in Jerusalem as pistachios in a crisp coating of pastry threads.\nAn issue that may be confusing to many travelers is the issue of Jewish dietary laws, or Kashrut. These laws state that certain meat is considered impure (anything that does not chew the cud and have a split hoof, including pork and rabbit), as well as certain types of seafood (anything without scales or fins). Animals that are permitted for consumption have been slaughtered according to Jewish religious practices and cleansed of all traces of blood before cooking, allowing the food to be declared kosher. Other complications revolve around the fact that meat and dairy products can never be eaten together in the same meal. In Jerusalem you will find that all types of restaurants can be kosher, not just Jewish ones.\n\n## Drink\nCoffee and tea are the two most common drinks among Jews and Arabs, although each has a preferred way of making it. In Jewish areas, coffee and tea are drunk in European or American-style cafés. Espresso is offered, but is weak compared to katzar, a stronger coffee. In Arab areas, coffee (qahweh) is served thick and strong and is meant to be consumed in small sips. If Western-style coffee is preferred, ask for Nescafé or filtered coffee. Tea (shay) is stronger than Western-style tea and is drunk with lots of sugar. If Western-style tea is preferred, ask for shay Libton (Lipton tea).\nFresh pomegranate (and grapefruit) juice is available all over the Old City. Prices start from around ₪10 (October 2018) for a 0.3 liter cup, any price beyond ₪15 (October 2018) for 0.3 liters (not 0.2) is a rip-off. The price in Hebron, by contrast, is ₪2.\nBottled water is inexpensive (usually, be careful where you buy) and readily available throughout the Old City. Carrying an extra bottle of water is recommended due to the dry, dusty climate.\nSome restaurants serve alcohol. The main beers are Israeli Maccabee/Goldstar and Arab Taybeh beer. Spirits are less widely available but are commonly sold in hotel bars.\n\n## Sleep\nAccommodation within the Old City itself is distinctly downmarket. Be sure to investigate people renting out private residences.\n\n## Budget\nFor those on a tight budget, youth hostels are ideal (although occasionally somewhat dodgy), and often the cheapest places to stay in Jerusalem. Religiously-based hospices and guest houses, located mainly near the holy sites, is a popular and inexpensive alternative to hotels. Hospices and guest houses tend to maintain stricter rules than hostels.\n31.77726235.2342231 Chain Gate Hostel, ☏ +972 54-436-8053. Gives a good impression of the religious tension here, because you always have to pass by the police and justify yourself.

          "content": "The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah (Biblical Hebrew: מְעָרַת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה, romanized: , lit. 'Cave of the Double') and to Muslims as the Ibrahami Mosque (Arabic: المسجد الإبراهيمي, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾibrāhīmī), or Sanctuary of Ibrahim (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي, romanized: ), is a series of caves situated in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nOver the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. \nDuring the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the \"status quo\" were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. \nIn 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a \"profanation of the Quran\". The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.\n\nEtymology of \"Makhpela\"\nAmoraic proposals\nThe etymology of the Biblical name for the site, Me'arat haMakhpela, is uncertain. The word Me'arat means \"cave of\" and haMakhpela may mean \"doubled\", \"multiplied\" or \"twofold\", so a literal translation would be \"cave of the double\". Two hypotheses are discussed by the Talmud in b. Eruvin 53a:The cave of makhpela: Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea [disputed]; one said, \"It is two chambers, one behind the other\", and one said, \"It is two chambers, one above the other.\"The position that the chambers are stacked is satisfactory—this is makhpela. However, according to the position that one is behind the other, what is makhpela? That it is doubled in [that it contains] couples:\"And Jacob came to his father Isaac, [to] Mamre, the 'City of the Four' which is Hebron ...\" (Gen. 35:27). Isaac the Smith said, \"The City of the Four Couples: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah\".According to b. Bava Batra 58a, Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea agreed that the two chambers, whatever their layout, shared identical dimensions. Genesis Rabbah 58 gives a third hypothesis:\"And Epron's field which was in the makhpela ...\" (Gen. 23:17). This teaches that it universally \"doubles\" the renown of those [within], as whoever is interred within is believed to have earned a very great reward [in Heaven].\n\nLater scholarship\nSaadia b. Joseph and Abraham ibn Ezra believed it referred to a \"cave within a cave\". Another hypothesis, supported by Samuel b. Meir, Moses b. Nachman, Obadiah Sforno, Moses Mendelssohn, Ernst Rosenmüller, and Samuel David Luzzatto, holds that makhpela isn't an adjective describing the cave but rather is a proper noun describing the tract of land on which it sits. This hypothesis is supported by the phrasing of some Bible verses, such as Genesis 49:30, \"the cave in the field of the Makhpela . . .\" The question over the right interpretation of makhpela has been discussed extensively in various Biblical commentaries.\nStrong's Concordance derives makhpela from kaphal, a verb meaning “to double”.\n\nBiblical origin\nAccording to Genesis 23:1–20, Abraham's wife Sarah dies in Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the land of Canaan at the age of 127, being the only woman in the Bible whose exact age is given, while Abraham is tending to business elsewhere. Abraham comes to mourn for her. After a while he stands up and speaks to the Biblical Hittites. He tells them that he is a foreigner in their land and requests that they give him a burial site so that he can bury his dead. The Hittites flatter Abraham, call him a Lord and mighty prince, and say that he can bury his dead in any of their tombs. Abraham doesn't take them up on their offer and instead asks them to contact Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, who lives in Mamre and owns the cave of Machpelah which he is offering to buy for \"the full price\". Ephron slyly replies that he is prepared to give Abraham the field and the cave within it, knowing that it would not result in Abraham having a permanent claim to it. Abraham politely refuses the offer and insists on paying for the field. Ephron replies that the field is worth four hundred shekels of silver and Abraham agrees to the price without any further bargaining. He then proceeded to bury his dead wife Sarah there.\nThe burial of Sarah is the first account of a burial in the Bible, and Abraham's purchase of Machpelah is the first commercial transaction mentioned.\nThe next burial in the cave is that of Abraham himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. The title deed to the cave was part of the property of Abraham that passed to his son Isaac. The third burial was that of Isaac, by his two sons Esau and Jacob, who died when he was 180 years old. There is no mention of how or when Isaac's wife Rebecca died, but she is included in the list of those that had been buried in Machpelah in Jacob's final words to the children of Israel. Jacob himself died at the age of 147 years.\nIn the final chapter of Genesis, Joseph had his physicians embalm his father Jacob, before they removed him from Egypt to be buried in the cave of the field of Machpelah. When Joseph died in the last verse, he was also embalmed. He was buried much later in Shechem after the children of Israel came into the Promised Land.\n\nExtra-biblical parallels\nIn the Ugaritic texts (13th–12th century BCE), three out of the six real estate contracts discovered were for the sum of 400 silver shekels, and the terms of sale in them parallel the Biblical description of the sale of Machpelah. Apparently 400 shekels was a common price for Canaanite real estate transactions in this period.\n\nHistory\nFirst and Second Temple period\nIn 2020, Israeli archaeologists led by David Ben-Shlomo (Ariel University) dated pottery from the caves (recovered surreptitiously by local residents in 1981) to the 8th century BCE. The different origins of the shards, from various areas around Hebron and Jerusalem, suggest the site may have been a pilgrimage site as early as this date, according to the study authors.\nThe time from which the Israelites regarded the site as sacred is unknown, though some scholars consider that the biblical story of Abraham's burial there probably dates from the 6th century BCE.\nBetween 31 and 4 BCE, Herod the Great built a large, rectangular enclosure over the cave to commemorate the site for his subjects. It is the only fully surviving Herodian structure from the period of Hellenistic Judaism. Herod's building, with 6-foot-thick (1.8 m) stone walls made from stones that were at least 3 feet (0.91 m) tall and sometimes reach a length of 24 feet (7.3 m), did not have a roof. Archaeologists are not certain where the original entrance to the enclosure was located, or even if there was one. The Herodian building stands on an earlier structure possibly built during the Hasmonean dynasty (c. 2nd century BCE).\n\nByzantine Christian period\nUntil the era of the Byzantine Empire, the interior of the enclosure remained exposed to the sky. Under Byzantine rule, a simple basilica was constructed at the southeastern end and the enclosure was roofed everywhere except at the centre.\nDuring this period, the site became an important Christian pilgrimage destination. The Pilgrim of Bordeaux, c. 333, reported \"a monument of square form built of stone of wondrous beauty, in which lie Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Rebecca, and Leah\". The Piacenza Pilgrim (c. 570) noted in his pilgrimage account that Jews and Christians shared possession of the site.\n\nArab period\nIn 614, the Sasanid Persians conquered the area and destroyed the castle, leaving only ruins; but in 637, the area came under the control of the Arab Muslims and the building was reconstructed as a roofed mosque.\nThe Muslims permitted the building of two small synagogues at the site.\nDuring the 10th century, an entrance was pierced through the north-eastern wall, some way above the external ground level, and steps from the north and from the east were built up to it (one set of steps for entering, the other for leaving). A building known as the qal'ah (قلعة i.e. castle) was also constructed near the middle of the southwestern side. Its purpose is unknown but one historic account claims that it marked the spot where Joseph was buried (see Joseph's Tomb), the area having been excavated by a Muslim caliph, under the influence of a local tradition regarding Joseph's tomb. Some archaeologists believe that the original entrance to Herod's structure was in the location of the qal'ah and that the northeastern entrance was created so that the kalah could be built by the former entrance.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1100, after the area was captured by the Crusaders, the enclosure once again became a church and Muslims were no longer permitted to enter. During this period, the area was given a new gabled roof, clerestory windows and vaulting.\nWhen the Crusaders took control of the site Jews were banned from using the synagogues.\nIn the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall. ... Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn al Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob. ... Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in the southern Levant, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.\nTowards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote, \"On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\"\nIn 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, St. Abram de Bron. He reported:\n\n\"Here that there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah, upon which the names of the three Patriarchs and their wives are inscribed in Hebrew characters. The cave is filled with barrels containing bones of people, which are taken there as to a sacred place. At the end of the field of the Machpelah stands Abraham's house with a spring in front of it\".\n\nAyyubid period\nIn 1188 Saladin conquered the area, reconverting the enclosure to a mosque but allowing Christians to continue worshipping there. Saladin also added a minaret at each corner—two of which still survive—and added an existing minbar (pulpit) from the Shrine of Husayn's Head near Ascalon to the mosque's interior. Samuel ben Samson visited the cave in 1210; he says that the visitor must descend by twenty-four steps in a passageway so narrow that the rock touches him on either hand.\n\nMamluk period\nBetween 1318 and 1320, the Mamluk governor of Gaza, a province that included Hebron, Sanjar al-Jawli ordered the construction of the Amir Jawli Mosque within the Haram enclosure to enlarge the prayer space and accommodate worshipers. In the late 14th century, under the Mamluks, two additional entrances were pierced into the western end of the south western side and the kalah was extended upwards to the level of the rest of the enclosure. A cenotaph in memory of Joseph was created in the upper level of the kalah so that visitors to the enclosure would not need to leave and travel round the outside just to pay respects. The Mamluks also built the northwestern staircase and the six cenotaphs (for Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Leah, Abraham, and Sarah, respectively), distributed evenly throughout the enclosure. The Mamluks forbade Jews from entering the site, allowing them only as close as the fifth step on a staircase at the southeast, but after some time this was increased to the seventh step.\nThe Jewish geographer Ishtori Haparchi, who visited the site in the 14th century, reported that a large square of high wall surrounded the tomb. According to a local tradition he recorded there, the stones of the wall were taken from the Temple built by King Solomon.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored, with Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reporting in 1807 that,all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.\nA contemporary traveller, M. Ermete Pierotti, in 1862 described the great jealousy with which the Muslims guarded the sanctuary and the practice of sending petitions to the patriarchs:\n\nThe true entrance to the Patriarchs' tomb is to be seen close to the western wall of the enclosure, and near the north-west comer; it is guarded by a very thick iron railing, and I was not allowed to go near it. I observed that the Mussulmans themselves did not go very near it. In the court opposite the entrance gate of the Mosque, there is an opening, through which I was allowed to go down for three steps, and I was able to ascertain by sight and touch that the rock exists there, and to conclude it to be about five feet thick. From the short observations I could make during my brief descent, as also from the consideration of the east wall of the Mosque, and the little information I extracted from the Chief Santon, who jealously guards the sanctuary, I consider that a part of the grotto exists under the Mosque, and that the other part is under the court, but at a lower level than that lying under the Mosque. This latter must be separated from the former by a vertical stratum of rock which contains an opening, as I conclude, for two reasons : first, because the east wall being entirely solid and massive, requires a good foundation; secondly, because the petitions which the Mussulmans present to the Santon to be transmitted to the Patriarchs are thrown, some through one opening, some through the other, according to the Patriarch to whom they are directed; and the Santon goes down by the way I went, whence I suppose that on that side there is a vestibule, and that the tombs may be found below it. I explained my conjectures to the Santon himself after leaving the Mosque, and he showed himself very much surprised at the time, and told the Pacha afterwards that I knew more about it than the Turks themselves. The fact is that even the Pacha who governs the province has no right to penetrate into the sacred enclosure, where (according to the Mussulman legend) the Patriarchs are living, and only condescend to receive the petitions addressed to them by mortals.\n\nBritish mandate on Palestine\nJordanian control\nAfter Jordan occupied the West Bank in 1948, no Jews were allowed in the territory and consequently no Jews could visit the tomb. In the 1960s, Jordan renovated the area surrounding the mosque, destroying several historical buildings in the process, among them, the ruins of the nearby Crusader fortress built in 1168.\n\nIsraeli control\nFollowing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, Hebron came under Jewish control for the first time in 2,000 years, though restrictions on visits by Jews were to continue.  According to the autobiography of the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Major general Rabbi Shlomo Goren, during the Six-Day War on 8 June 1967, he made his way from Gush Etzion to Hebron. In Hebron he realized that the Arabs had surrendered and quickly made his way to the Cave of the Patriarchs. He shot at the doors of the mosque with his Uzi submachine gun. But when that was ineffective in prying the doors open, he attached chains to his Jeep and the doors, proceeding to pull them down. He entered the mosque and began to pray. While praying, a messenger from the Mufti of Hebron delivered a surrender note to him, whereby the rabbi replied \"This place, Ma'arat HaMachpela, is a place of prayer and peace. Surrender elsewhere.\"\nThe first Jew to enter the burial caves was Michal Arbel, the 13-year-old daughter of Yehuda Arbel, chief of Shin Bet operations in the West Bank, because she was slender enough to be lowered into the narrow, 28 centimetres (11 in) wide hole on 9 October 1968, to gain access to the tomb site, after which she took photographs.\nIsraeli settlers reestablished a small synagogue under the mosque. The first Jewish wedding ceremony to take place in it was on 7 August 1968. The stone stairway leading to the mosque was also destroyed in order to erase the humiliating \"seventh step\".\nIn 1968, a special arrangement was made to accommodate Jewish services on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. This led to an attack on worshippers, with a hand-grenade being thrown on the stairway leading to the tomb on 9 October; 47 Israelis were injured, 8 seriously. On 4 November, a large explosion went off near the gate to the compound and 6 people, Jews and Arabs, were wounded. On Yom Kippur eve, 3 October 1976, an Arab mob destroyed several Torah scrolls and prayer books at the tomb. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded.\nIn 1981, a group of Jewish settlers from the Hebron community led by Noam Arnon broke into the caves and took photos of the burial chambers.\nTensions would later increase as the Israeli government signed the Oslo Accords in September 1993, which gave limited autonomy to the PLO in the West Bank city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The city of Hebron and the rest of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank were not included in the initial agreement. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli-American settler in February 1994, left 29 Palestinian Muslims dead and scores injured. The resulting riots resulted in a further 35 deaths.\n\nThe increased sensitivity of the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab–Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the waqf (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes the whole of the southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. As a consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One of these days is the Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.\nThe Israeli authorities do not allow Jewish religious authorities the right to maintain the site and allow only the waqf to do so. Tourists are permitted to enter the site. Security at the site has increased since the Intifada; the Israel Defense Forces surround the site with soldiers and control access to the shrines. Israeli forces also subject locals to checkpoints and bar all non-Jews from setting foot on some of the main roads to the complex and ban Palestinian vehicles from many of the roads in the area.\nOn 21 February 2010, Israel announced that it would include the site in a national heritage site protection and rehabilitation plan. The announcement sparked protests from the UN, Arab governments and the United States. A subsequent UNESCO vote in October aimed to affirm that the \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs in al-Khalil/Hebron\"\nwas \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories.\"\nIsraeli authorities have placed restrictions on calling the faithful to prayer by the muezzin of the Ibrahimi mosque. The order was enforced 61 times in October 2014, and 52 times in December of that year. This was following numerous complaints by the Jewish residents who claim that the calls violate legal decibel limits. In December 2009 Israeli authorities banned Jewish music played at the cave following similar complaints from the Arab residents.\n\nStructure\nBuilding\nThe rectangular stone enclosure lies on a northwest–southeast axis, and is divided into two sections by a wall running between the northwestern three fifths, and the southeastern two fifths. The northwestern section is roofed on three sides, the central area and north eastern side being open to the sky; the southeastern section is fully roofed, the roof being supported by four columns evenly distributed through the section.\nNearly the entire building itself was built by King Herod and it remains the only Herodian building surviving today virtually intact.\n\nIn the northwestern section are four cenotaphs, each housed in a separate octagonal room, those dedicated to Jacob and Leah being on the northwest, and those to Abraham and Sarah on the southeast. A corridor runs between the cenotaphs on the northwest, and another between those on the southeast. A third corridor runs the length of the southwestern side, through which access to the cenotaphs, and to the southeastern section, can be gained. An entrance to the enclosure exists on the southwestern side, entering this third corridor; a mosque outside this entrance must be passed through to gain access.\nAt the center of the northeastern side, there is another entrance, which enters the roofed area on the southeastern side of the northwestern section and through which access can also be gained to the southeastern (fully roofed) section. This entrance is approached on the outside by a corridor which leads from a long staircase running most of the length of the northwestern side. The southeastern section, which functions primarily as a mosque, contains two cenotaphs, symmetrically placed, near the center, dedicated to Isaac and Rebecca. Between them, in the southeastern wall, is a mihrab. The cenotaphs have a distinctive red and white horizontal striped pattern to their stonework but are usually covered by decorative cloth.\nUnder the present arrangements, Jews are restricted to entering by the southwestern side, and limited to the southwestern corridor and the corridors that run between the cenotaphs, while Muslims may enter only by the northeastern side but are allowed free rein of the remainder of the enclosure.\n\nCaves\nThe caves under the enclosure are not themselves generally accessible; the waqf have historically prevented access to the actual tombs out of respect for the dead. Only two entrances are known to exist, the most visible of which is located to the immediate southeast of Abraham's cenotaph on the inside of the southeastern section. This entrance is a narrow shaft covered by a decorative grate, which itself is covered by an elaborate dome. The other entrance is located to the southeast, near the mihrab, and is sealed by a large stone, and usually covered by prayer mats; this is very close to the location of the seventh step on the outside of the enclosure, beyond which the Mamelukes forbade Jews from approaching.\nWhen the enclosure was controlled by crusaders, access was occasionally possible. One account, by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela dating from 1163 CE, states that after passing through an iron door, and descending, the caves would be encountered. According to Benjamin of Tudela, there was a sequence of three caves, the first two of which were empty; in the third cave were six tombs, arranged to be opposite to one another.\n\nThese caves had been rediscovered only in 1119 CE by a monk named Arnoul, after an unnamed monk at prayer \"noticed a draught\" in the area near the present location of the mihrab and, with other \"brethren\", removed the flagstones and found a room lined with Herodian masonry. Arnoul, still searching for the source of the draught, hammered on the cave walls until he heard a hollow sound, pulled down the masonry in that area, and discovered a narrow passage. The narrow passage, which subsequently became known as the serdab (Arabic for passage), was similarly lined with masonry, but partly blocked up. Having unblocked the passage, Arnoul discovered a large round room with plastered walls. In the floor of the room, he found a square stone slightly different from the others and, upon removing it, found the first of the caves. The caves were filled with dust. After removing the dust, Arnoul found bones; believing the bones to be those of the biblical Patriarchs, Arnoul washed them in wine and stacked them neatly. Arnoul carved inscriptions on the cave walls describing whose bones he believed them to be.This passage to the caves was sealed at some time after Saladin had recaptured the area, though the roof of the circular room was pierced, and a decorative grate was placed over it. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, the area fell into the hands of the Israel Defense Forces, and Moshe Dayan, the Defence Minister, who was an amateur archaeologist, attempted to regain access to the tombs. Ignorant of the serdab entrance, Dayan concentrated his attention on the shaft visible below the decorative grate and had the idea of sending someone thin enough to fit through the shaft and down into the chamber below. Dayan eventually found a slim 12-year-old girl named Michal to assist and sent her into the chamber with a camera.\nMichal explored the round chamber, but failed to find the square stone in the floor that led to the caves. Michal did, however, explore the passage and find steps leading up to the surface, though the exit was blocked by a large stone (this is the entrance near the mihrab). According to the report of her findings, which Michal gave to Dayan after having been lifted back through the shaft, there are 16 steps leading down into the passage, which is 1 cubit wide, 17.37 metres (57.0 ft) and 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) high. In the round chamber, which is 12 metres (39 ft) below the entrance to the shaft, there are three stone slabs, the middle of which contains a partial inscription of Sura 2, verse 255, from the Quran, the famous Ayatul Kursi, Verse of the Throne.\nIn 1981, Seev Jevin, the former director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, entered the passage after a group of Jewish settlers from Hebron had entered the chamber via the entrance near the mihrab and discovered the square stone in the round chamber that concealed the cave entrance. The reports state that after entering the first cave, which seemed to Jevin to be empty, he found a passage leading to a second oval chamber, smaller than the first, which contained shards of pottery and a wine jug. Findings published in the Israel Exploration Journal in 2020 stated that the pottery dated from the 8th century BCE and originated from various locations in the Hebron and Jerusalem areas.\n\nReligions beliefs and traditions\nJudaism\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Abraham specifically purchased the land for use as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite, making it one of two purchases by Abraham of real estate in the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land. The book describes how the three patriarchs and their wives, the matriarchs, were buried there.\n\nAbraham and Sarah (Genesis 23:1–20; Genesis 49:31)\nIsaac and Rebekah (Genesis 35:29; Genesis 49:31)\nJacob and Leah (Genesis 49:28–33; Genesis 50:4–5; Genesis 50:12–13)\nThe only matriarch missing is Jacob's other wife, Rachel, described in Genesis as having been buried near Bethlehem. These verses are the common source for the religious beliefs surrounding the cave. While they are not part of the Quran they exist in Islam's oral tradition. The story of Abraham's burial is recounted in, for example, Ibn Kathir's 14th century Stories of the Prophets.\n\nJewish midrashic literature avows that, in addition to the patriarch couples, Adam, the first man, and his wife, Eve, were also interred in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a tradition supported by ancient Samaritan texts. The tradition is supported by the simple wording of Genesis 23:2, which refers to \"Kiryat Arba... Hevron\" (\"arba\" means 'four'). Commenting on that passage, Rashi listed the four couples chronologically, starting with Adam and Eve.\nAnother Jewish tradition tells that when Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming that he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on, Hushim, the son of Dan, and who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was transpiring, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: \"Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?\" He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave. This implies that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau's right to be buried in the cave—according to a commentary on the \"Book of Exodus\", Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, \"My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?\" Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in Sefer HaYashar.\nAn early Jewish text, the Genesis Rabbah, states that this site is one of three that enemies of Judaism cannot taunt the Jews by saying \"you have stolen them,\" as it was purchased \"for its full price\" by Abraham.\nAccording to the Midrash, the Patriarchs were buried in the cave because the cave is the threshold to the Garden of Eden. The Patriarchs are said not to be dead but \"sleeping\". They rise to beg mercy for their children throughout the generations. According to the Zohar, this tomb is the gateway through which souls enter into Gan Eden (heaven).\nThere are Hebrew prayers of supplication for marriage on the walls of the Sarah cenotaph.\n\nIslam\nMuslims believe that Muhammad visited Hebron on his nocturnal journey from Mecca to Jerusalem to stop by the tomb and pay his respects. For this reason the tomb quickly became a popular Islamic pilgrimage site. It was said that Muhammad himself encouraged the activity, saying \"He who cannot visit me, let him visit the Tomb of Abraham\" and \"He who visits the Tomb of Abraham, Allah abolishes his sins.\"\nAccording to one tradition, childless women threw petitions addressed to Sarah, known for giving birth at an advanced age, through a hole in the mosque floor to the caves below.\nAfter the conquest of the city by Umar, this holy place was \"simply taken over from the Jewish tradition\" by the new rulers; the Herodian enclosure was converted into a mosque and placed under the control of a waqf. The waqf continues to maintain most of the site, while the Israeli military controls access to the site.\nAccording to some Islamic sources the cave is also the tomb of Joseph. Though the Bible has Joseph buried in Shechem (the present-day Palestinian city of Nablus), Jewish aggadic tradition conserved the idea that he wished to be interred at Hebron, and the Islamic version may reflect this. The Jewish apocryphal book, The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, also states that this is the burial place of Jacob's twelve sons.\nAccording to some sources, the mosque is the 4th holiest in Islam; other sources rank other sites as 4th.\nA Fatimid-era minbar is kept at the mosque. According to an Arabic inscription written on the minbar, it was commissioned by Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir when he discovered the head of Husayn ibn Ali in 1092 CE (448 AH) at Ascalon and kept it at a mosque and shrine there.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Palestine\nJudaism in Palestine\nChristianity in Palestine\nList of mosques in Palestine\nList of burial places of founders of religious traditions\nList of World Heritage Sites in the State of Palestine\nThe Cave – a 1993 multimedia opera set in the cave\nTomb of the Matriarchs\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nConder, J.

          "summary": "The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah (Biblical Hebrew: מְעָרַת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה, romanized: , lit. 'Cave of the Double') and to Muslims as the Ibrahami Mosque (Arabic: المسجد الإبراهيمي, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾibrāhīmī), or Sanctuary of Ibrahim (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي, romanized: ), is a series of caves situated in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nOver the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. \nDuring the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the \"status quo\" were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. \nIn 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a \"profanation of the Quran\". The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.",

          "content": "The Church of the Nativity, or Basilica of the Nativity, is a basilica located in Bethlehem, West Bank, Palestine. The grotto holds a prominent religious significance to Christians of various denominations as the birthplace of Jesus. The grotto is the oldest site continuously used as a place of worship in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the Holy Land.\nThe church was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great a short time after his mother Helena's visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. That original basilica was likely built between 330 and 333, being already mentioned in 333, and was dedicated on 31 May 339. It was probably destroyed by fire during the Samaritan revolts of the sixth century, possibly in 529, and a new basilica was built a number of years later by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), who added a porch or narthex, and replaced the octagonal sanctuary with a cruciform transept complete with three apses, but largely preserved the original character of the building, with an atrium and a basilica consisting of a nave with four side aisles.\nThe Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinianic reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved). Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one Catholic, one Armenian Apostolic, and one Greek Orthodox, of which the first two contain bell towers built during the modern era.\nThe silver star marking the spot where Christ was born, inscribed in Latin, was stolen in October 1847 by Greek monks who wished to remove this Catholic item. Some assert that this was a contributing factor in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire. Others assert that the war grew out of the wider European situation.\nSince 2012, the Church of the Nativity is a World Heritage Site and was the first to be listed by UNESCO under 'Palestine'.\nSince 1852, the rights of the three religious communities have been governed by an understanding known as the Status Quo. Initially informal, this was made official by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, and was codified by the United Nations in the Palestine Conciliation Commission in 1949.\n\nBase in scripture\nOf the four canonical gospels, Matthew and Luke mention the birth of Jesus, both placing it in Bethlehem. Luke mentions the manger: \"and she gave birth to her son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.\"\nA variant of the narrative is contained in the Gospel of James, an apocryphal infancy gospel.\n\nHistory\nHoly site before Constantine (ca. 4 BC–AD 326)\nThe holy site known as the Nativity Grotto is thought to be the manger where Jesus was born. In 135, Emperor Hadrian had the site above the grotto converted into a worship place for Adonis, the mortal lover of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and desire. Jerome claimed in 420 that the grotto had been consecrated to the worship of Adonis, and that a sacred grove was planted there in order to completely wipe out the memory of Jesus from the world.\nAround AD 248, Greek philosopher Origen of Alexandria wrote the following about the grotto:\n\nIn Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshiped and reverenced by the Christians.\n\nConstantinian basilica (326 – 529 or 556)\nThe first basilica on this site was built by Emperor Constantine I, on the site identified by his mother, Empress Helena and Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem. The construction started in 326 under the supervision of Makarios, who followed Constantine's orders, and was dedicated on 31 May 339—however, it had already been visited in 333 by the Bordeaux Pilgrim, at which time it was already in use.\nConstruction of this early church was carried out as part of a larger project following the First Council of Nicaea during Constantine's reign, aimed to build churches on the sites assumed at the time to have witnessed the crucial events in the life of Jesus. The design of the basilica centered around three major architectural sections:\n\nAt the eastern end, an apse in a polygonal shape (broken pentagon, rather than the once proposed, but improbable full octagon), encircling a raised platform with an opening in its floor of ca. 4 metres diameter that allowed direct view of the Nativity site underneath. An ambulatory with side rooms surrounded the apse.\nA five-aisled basilica in continuation of the eastern apse, one bay shorter than the still standing Justinianic reconstruction.\nA porticoed atrium.\nThe structure was burned and destroyed in one of the Samaritan Revolts of 529 or 556, in the second of which Jews seem to have joined the Samaritans.\n\nJustinian's basilica (6th century)\nThe basilica was rebuilt in its present form in the 6th century on the initiative of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565), after the destruction of either 529 or 556. It was probably accomplished after the Emperor's death, as is indicated by the dating of the wooden elements embedded in the church walls between 545 and 665, which was provided by the dendrochronological analyses made during the recent restoration works.\nThe Persians under Khosrau II invaded Palestine and conquered nearby Jerusalem in 614, but they did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander Shahrbaraz was moved by the depiction above the church entrance of the Three Magi wearing the garb of Persian Zoroastrian priests, so he ordered that the building be spared.\n\nCrusader period (1099–1187)\nThe First Crusade captured Jerusalem in 1099. The Latin conquerors promoted the redecoration of the building in the medium of wall painting: images of saints were displayed in the central and southern colonnades of the nave, largely on the initiative of private donors, as is shown by the frequent use of dedicatory inscriptions and portraits. Remnants of a cycle of narrative scenes are preserved in the north-western pillar of the choir and the south transepts, as well as in the chapel located below the bell tower.\nFrom 1131 until the end of the Latin rule over Jerusalem, the Holy Sepulchre was the site of royal coronations and burials. The Latins undertook extensive decoration and restoration on the basilica and grounds, a process that continued until 1169, from 1165 to 1169 even through a sort of \"joint venture\" between Bishop Ralph and King Amalric and the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. As detailed in the bilingual Greek and Latin inscription in the altar space, the mosaic decoration was made by a teamwork headed by a painter named Ephraim. Another bilingual, Latin and Syriac, inscription located in the lower half of a mosaic panel displaying an angel in the northern wall of the nave bears witness to the work of a painter named Basil, who was probably a local Syrian Melkite. The two artists collaborated within the same workshop.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods (1187–1516)\nThe Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem and its area in 1187 was without consequences for the Nativity church. The Greek-Melkite clergy was granted the right to serve in the church, and similar concessions were given almost immediately also to other Christian denominations.\nIn the year 1227 the church was embellished with an elegantly carved wooden door, the remnants of which can still be seen in the narthex. As detailed in its double, Armenian and Arabic inscription, it was made by two Armenian monks, Father Abraham and Father Arakel, in the times of King Hethum I of Cilicia (1224–1269) and the Emir of Damascus, and Saladin's nephew, al-Mu'azzam Isa.\nIn 1229 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II signed an agreement with Sultan al-Kamil which led to the restitution of the Holy Places to the Crusaders. The property of the Nativity Church came back into the possession of the Latin clergy on the condition that Muslim pilgrims may be allowed to visit the holy cave.\nLatin hegemony probably lasted until the incursion of Khwarezmian Turks in April 1244. On that occasion, the church treasures, now preserved in the Terra Sancta Museum in Jerusalem, were concealed underground and rediscovered only in 1863. The church was devastated, but not destroyed, the major damage being the dilapidation of its roof.\nUnder Mamluk rule, the church was used by different Christian denominations, including Greeks, Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians, and Syrians. In 1347 the Franciscans of the newly established Custody of the Holy Land were bestowed with the ownership of the former monastery of the regular canons to the north of the basilica. The Friars managed to gain a hegemonic role in Bethlehem until the Ottoman period.\nStarting from the late 13th century, pilgrims lament the dilapidation of the church interior by order of Mamluk authorities: in particular, the marble revetments of the walls and floor were gradually removed, until they thoroughly disappeared.\nThe Duchy of Burgundy committed resources to restore the roof in August 1448, and multiple regions contributed supplies to have the church roof repaired in 1480: England supplied the lead, the Second Kingdom of Burgundy supplied the wood, and the Republic of Venice provided the labor.\n\nOttoman period, first three centuries (16th–18th)\nAfter the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Nativity church suffered from a long decay. The nave was largely abandoned and used for profane purposes. In the aim to prevent people from entering the church with horses and cattle, the main entrance was walled up and transformed into a diminutive door, known until our days as the \"Door of Humility\", since visitors are forced to bend down to go through it. An elevated chancel, provided with three doors, thoroughly separated the nave from the east end of the building, which was reserved for liturgical activities.\nThe Ottoman period was characterized by increasing tensions between the different Christian denominations. In 1637, Greeks were granted hegemony by the Sublime Porte and the Franciscans were expelled from the holy cave. In 1621 the Armenian Patriarch Grigor Paronter bought the partly ruined buildings to the south of the courtyard and established there a monastery and a hospice for pilgrims. In 1639, the Cretan painter Jeremias Palladas was commissioned by the Greek Patriarch to paint new icons to embellish the church. Further works were made in 1671 on the initiative of Patriarch Dositheos II. In 1675, Dositheos managed to gain control also of the nave, and promoted restorations of the floor and the roof, as well as the making of a new iconostasis. The Franciscans were restored in their rights in 1690, but they lose their hegemony once again in 1757, when the Greek Orthodox were granted full ownership of the upper church and the authorization to keep the keys to the grotto. Afterwards, a redecoration of the church was promoted: the nave was newly paved, the bema was provided with a solemn iconostasis and a wooden baldachin was erected over the main altar.\nBecause of uninterrupted water infiltrations from the roof, the Crusader mosaics started falling down, as is documented in many pilgrims' accounts from the 16th century onwards.\n\nNineteenth century\nEarthquakes inflicted significant damage to the Church of the Nativity between 1834 and 1837. The 1834 Jerusalem earthquake damaged the church's bell tower, the furnishings in the cave on which the church is built, and other parts of its structure. Minor damages were further inflicted by a series of strong aftershocks in 1836 and the Galilee earthquake of 1837. As part of the repairs executed by the Greek Orthodox after receiving a firman in 1842, a wall was built between the nave and aisles, used at the time as a market, and the eastern part of the church containing the choir, which allowed for worship to be continued there.\nThe religiously significant silver star marking the exact birthplace of Jesus was removed in October 1847 from the Grotto of the Nativity by the Greek Orthodox. The church was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but around Christmas 1852, Napoleon III forced the Ottomans to recognise Catholic France as the \"sovereign authority\" over Christian holy sites in the Holy Land. The Sultan of Turkey replaced the silver star at the grotto, complete with a Latin inscription, but the Christian Orthodox Russian Empire disputed the change in authority. They cited the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and then deployed armies to the Danube area. As a result, the Ottomans issued firmans essentially reversing their earlier decision, renouncing the French treaty, and restoring to the Orthodox Christians the sovereign authority over the churches of the Holy Land for the time being, thus increasing local tensions—and all this fuelled the conflict between the Russian and the Ottoman empires over the control of holy sites around the region.\n\nTwentieth century to the present\nIn 1918 British governor Colonel Ronald Storrs demolished the wall erected in 1842 by the Greek Orthodox between nave and choir.\nThe passageway which connects St. Jerome's Cave and the Cave of the Nativity was expanded in February 1964, allowing easier access for visitors. American businessman Stanley Slotkin was visiting at the time and purchased a quantity of the limestone rubble, more than a million irregular fragments about 5 mm (0.20 in) across. He sold them to the public encased in plastic crosses, and they were advertised in infomercials in 1995.\nDuring the Second Intifada in April 2002, the church was the site of a month-long siege in which approximately 50 armed Palestinians wanted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took refuge inside the church. Christians in the church gave refuge to the fighters, giving them food, water, and protection from Israeli military forces stationed outside. Israeli media claimed that the Christians inside were being held hostage, however, parishioners inside the church say they and the church were treated with respect.\nCurtains caught fire in the grotto beneath the church on 27 May 2014, which resulted in some slight damage.\nThe church's joint owners undertook a major renovation starting in September 2013, probably to be completed in 2021 (see also under Restoration (2013–2019)).\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nIn 2012, the church complex became the first Palestinian site to be listed as a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session on 29 June. It was approved by a secret vote of 13–6 in the 21-member committee, according to UNESCO spokeswoman Sue Williams, and following an emergency candidacy procedure that by-passed the 18-month process for most sites, despite the opposition of the United States and Israel. The site was approved under criteria four and six. The decision was a controversial one on both technical and political terms. It was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger from 2012 to 2019, as it was suffering from damages due to water leaks.\n\nRestoration (2013–2019)\nEndangered status\nThe basilica was placed on the 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund:\n\nThe present state of the church is worrying. Many roof timbers are rotting, and have not been replaced since the 19th century. The rainwater that seeps into the building not only accelerates the rotting of the wood and damages the structural integrity of the building, but also damages the 12th-century wall mosaics and paintings. The influx of water also means that there is an ever-present chance of an electrical fire. If another earthquake were to occur on the scale of the one of 1834, the result would most likely be catastrophic. ... It is hoped that the listing will encourage its preservation, including getting the three custodians of the church—the Greek Orthodox Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, and the Franciscan order—to work together, which has not happened for hundreds of years. The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority would also have to work together to protect it.\nA Presidential committee for the restoration of the Nativity Church was appointed in 2008. In the following year, an international consortium team of experts from different Universities, under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Alessandri (University of Ferrara, Italy), was given the task of planning and coordinating the restoration works.\n\nLogistics and organisation\nIn 2010, the Palestinian Authority announced that a multimillion-dollar restoration programme was imminent. Although a majority Muslim nation, albeit with a significant Christian minority, Palestinians consider the church a national treasure and one of their most visited tourist sites. President Mahmoud Abbas has been actively involved in the project, which is led by Ziad al-Bandak. The project is partially funded by Palestinians and conducted by a team of Palestinian and international experts.\n\nRestoration process\nThe initial phase of the restoration work was completed in early 2016. New windows have been installed, structural repairs on the roof have been completed and art works and mosaics have been cleaned and restored. The works went further with the consolidation of the narthex, the cleaning and consolidation of all wooden elements, the cleaning of wall mosaics, mural paintings, and floor mosaics. The works came to pause in 2021; however there is still restoration work to be done as of June 2024. The remaining goals of the project include: the conservation of the stone tiles of the Church of the Nativity’s front yard, the addition of a firefighting system, a climate control system, structural consolidation, further prevention of seismic activity damage, and the restoration of the central nave. The most necessary of the repairs yet to be done is restoration of the Grotto of the Nativity.\n\nDiscoveries\nItalian restoration workers uncovered a seventh surviving mosaic angel in July 2016, which was previously hidden under plaster. According to the Italian restorer Marcello Piacenti, the mosaics \"are made of gold leaf placed between two glass plates\" and solely \"faces and limbs are drawn with small pieces of stone.\"\n\nProperty and administration\nThe property rights, liturgical use and maintenance of the church are regulated by a set of documents and understandings known as the Status Quo. The church is owned by three church authorities, the Greek Orthodox (most of the building and furnishings), the Catholic and the Armenian Apostolic (each of them with lesser properties). The Coptic Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox are holding minor rights of worship at the Armenian church in the northern transept, and at the Altar of Nativity.\nThere have been repeated brawls among monk trainees over quiet respect for others' prayers, hymns and even the division of floor space for cleaning duties. The Palestinian police are often called to restore peace and order.\n\nSite architecture and layout\nThe centrepiece of the Nativity complex is the Grotto of the Nativity, a cave which enshrines the site where Jesus is said to have been born.\nThe core of the complex connected to the Grotto consists of the Church of the Nativity itself, and the adjoining Catholic Church of St. Catherine north of it.\n\nOuter courtyard\nBethlehem's main city square, Manger Square, is an extension of the large paved courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity and St Catherine's. Here crowds gather on Christmas Eve to sing Christmas carols in anticipation of the midnight services.\n\nBasilica of the Nativity\nThe main Basilica of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is designed like a typical Roman basilica, with five aisles formed by Corinthian columns, and an apse in the eastern end containing the sanctuary.\nThe basilica is entered through a very low door called the \"Door of Humility.\"\nThe church's interior walls feature medieval golden mosaics once covering the side walls, which are now in large parts lost.\nThe original Roman-style floor of the basilica has been covered over with flagstones, but there is a trap door in the floor which opens up to reveal a portion of the original mosaic pavement from the Constantinian basilica.\nThere are 44 columns separating the aisles from each other and from the nave, some of which are painted with images of saints, such as the Irish monk Catald (fl. 7th century), the patron of the Sicilian Normans, Canute IV (c. 1042–1086), king of Denmark, and Olaf II (995–1030), king of Norway.\nThe east end of the church consists of a raised chancel, closed by an apse containing the main altar and separated from the chancel by a large gilded iconostasis.\nA complex array of sanctuary lamps is placed throughout the entire building.\nThe open ceiling exposes the wooden rafters, recently restored. The previous 15th-century restoration used beams donated by King Edward IV of England, who also donated lead to cover the roof; however, this lead was taken by the Ottoman Turks, who melted it down for ammunition to use in war against Venice.\nStairways on either side of the chancel lead down to the Grotto.\n\nGrotto of the Nativity\nThe Grotto of the Nativity, the place where Jesus is said to have been born, is an underground space which forms the crypt of the Church of the Nativity. It is situated underneath its main altar, and it is normally accessed by two staircases on either side of the chancel. The grotto is part of a network of caves, which are accessed from the adjacent Church St Catherine's. The tunnel-like corridor connecting the Grotto to the other caves is normally locked.\nThe cave has an eastern niche said to be the place where Jesus was born, which contains the Altar of Nativity. The exact spot where Jesus was born is marked beneath this altar by a 14-pointed silver star with the Latin inscription Hic De Virgine Maria Jesus Christus Natus Est-1717 (\"Here Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary-1717\"). It was installed by the Catholics in 1717, removed – allegedly by the Greeks – in 1847, and replaced by the Turkish government in 1853. The star is set into the marble floor and surrounded by 15 silver lamps representing the three Christian communities: six belong to the Greek Orthodox, four to the Catholics, and five to the Armenian Apostolic. The Altar of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. The significance of the 14 points on the star is to represent the three sets of 14 generations in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. First 14 from Abraham to David, then 14 from David to the Babylonian captivity, then 14 more to Jesus Christ. In the middle of the 14 pointed star is a circular hole, through which one can reach in to touch the stone that is said to be the original stone that Mary lay on when she gave birth to Jesus. On the apse above the altar was a 12th-century mosaic depicting the Nativity; the base of the mosaic read \"Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis\" (\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will\"). The mosaic was vandalized in 1873 by Greeks who rioted against the Franciscans. Fragments of the mosaic can still be seen on the apse but are covered over by an icon during liturgical celebrations by the Greeks and Armenians.\nCatholics are in charge of a section of the grotto known as the \"Grotto of the Manger\", marking the traditional site where Mary laid the newborn baby in the manger. The Altar of the Magi is located directly opposite from the manger site. The Franciscans are also in charge of a door, at the opposite end of the Altar of the Nativity, that opens to a passageway connecting the grotto with the underground chapels of Saint Catherine Church.\n\nChurch of St. Catherine\nThe adjoining Church of St. Catherine is a Catholic church dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, built in a more modern Gothic Revival style. It has been further modernized according to the liturgical trends which followed Vatican II.\nThis is the church where the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem celebrates Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Certain customs in this Midnight Mass predate Vatican II, but must be maintained because the Status Quo was legally fixed by a Firman (decree) in 1852 under the Ottoman Empire, which is still in force today.\nThe bas-relief of the Tree of Jesse is a 3.75 by 4 metres (12 ft 4 in by 13 ft 1 in) sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj which was recently incorporated into the Church of St. Catherine as a gift of Pope Benedict XVI during his trip to the Holy Land in 2009. It represents an olive tree as the Tree of Jesse, displaying the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham through Joseph, as well as symbolism from the Old Testament. The upper portion is dominated by a crowned figure of Christ the King in an open-armed pose blessing the Earth. It is situated along the passage used by pilgrims making their way to the Grotto of the Nativity.\n\nCaves accessed from St. Catherine's\nSeveral chapels are found in the caves accessed from St. Catherine's, including the Chapel of Saint Joseph commemorating the angel's appearance to Joseph, commanding him to flee to Egypt; the Chapel of the Innocents, commemorating the children killed by Herod; and the Chapel of Saint Jerome, in the underground cell where tradition holds he lived while translating the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate).\n\nTombs\nTraditional tombs of saints\nAccording to a tradition not sustained by history, the tombs of four Catholic saints are said to be located beneath the Church of the Nativity, in the caves accessible from the Church of St. Catherine:\n\nJerome, whose remains are said to have been transferred to the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome\nPaula, a disciple and benefactor of Jerome\nEustochium, the daughter of Paula\nEusebius of Cremona, a disciple of Jerome. A different tradition holds that he is buried in Italy.\n\nAncient burials\nA number of ancient trough-shaped tombs can be seen in the Catholic-owned caves adjacent to the Nativity Grotto and St Jerome's Cave, some of them inside the Chapel of the Innocents; more tombs can be seen on the southern, Greek-Orthodox side of the Basilica of the Nativity, also presented as being those of the infants murdered by Herod.\nAccording to researcher Haytham Dieck, rock-cut tombs and bone fragments in one restricted room of the church date from the 1st century AD. In another clandestine chamber, the Cave of the Holy Innocents, skulls and other bones from as many as 2,000 people (according to Dieck) are collected, but are clearly not infantile.\n\nChristmas in Bethlehem\nThere are three different dates for the celebration of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Bethlehem:\n\n24 and 25 December for the Catholics (Latins), who use the General Roman Calendar (Gregorian);\n6 and 7 January for the Greek Orthodox, together with the Syriac Orthodox, Ethiopian and Coptic Orthodox, who use the Julian calendar;\n18 and 19 January for the Armenian Apostolic Church, which combines the celebration of the Nativity with that of the Baptism of Jesus into the Armenian Feast of Theophany on 6 January, according to the early traditions of Eastern Christianity, but follows the rules of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem in its calculations (6 January Julian style corresponds to 19 January Gregorian style).\n\nLatin and Protestant\nThe Catholic Midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve is broadcast around the world. Festivities begin hours earlier when dignitaries welcome the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem at the entrance to the city, near Rachel's Tomb. Accompanied by a parade of youth organizations, he then makes his way to Manger Square, where crowds are waiting. Finally, he enters the Catholic Church of Saint Catherine for Mass, after which he leads the way to the adjacent Church of the Nativity. The patriarch carries a figurine of the Baby Jesus and places it on the silver star in the Nativity Grotto under the basilica.\nProtestants worship either at the Lutheran church or the Church of the Nativity. However, some Protestant congregations go to Beit Sahour, a village near Bethlehem.\n\nGreek Orthodox\nOn the Orthodox Christmas Eve, 13 days later, many visitors and faithful again fill Manger Square, this time to watch processions and receptions for the religious leaders of the different Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\nArmenian\nMembers of the Armenian community are the last ones to celebrate Christmas, on 18 and 19 January, in their own section of the Nativity Church. The altars there are also used by the smaller denominations during their respective Christmas festivities.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNativity of Jesus\nNativity scene\nEarly Christian art and architecture\nList of oldest church buildings\nPalestinian Christians\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHugues Vincent and Félix-Marie Abel, Bethléem.

          "content": "Hisham's Palace (Arabic: قصر هشام Qaṣr Hishām), also known as Khirbat al-Mafjar (Arabic: خربة المفجر), is an important early Islamic archaeological site in the city of Jericho, in the West Bank in Palestine. Built by the Umayyad dynasty in the first half of the 8th century, it is one of the so-called Umayyad desert castles. It is located 3 kilometres (2 mi) north of Jericho's city center, in an area governed by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The palace was used until the 11th century, and it may have been destroyed by an earthquake in 1033.\nSpreading over 60 hectares (150 acres), the site consists of three main parts: a palace, an ornate bath complex, and an agricultural estate. The entire complex – palace, baths, and farm – was connected to nearby springs by an elaborate water system. The site is on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites and has been open to the public since 2021.\n\nLocation\nHisham's Palace was established north of Jericho's urban centre. It was separated from Jericho by the Wadi Nueima. The archaeologist Michael Jennings suggests that the separation provided protection as Jericho was at the time a mostly Christian settlement. Its position that meant accessing the main water source in the area, the Ayn al-Sultan spring, was impractical. Instead, the palace drew its water from springs at Naaran to the north-west. Aqueducts were built to transport water from the springs to the palace. The palace was immediately east of a road running north from Jericho, through the Jordan Valley, and connecting to Damascus.\n\nHistory\nIt is difficult to establish a secure historical framework for Hisham's Palace. No textual sources reference the site, and archaeological excavations are the only source of further information. An ostracon bearing the name \"Hisham\" was found during the course of Baramki's excavations. This was interpreted as evidence that the site was built during the reign of the caliph Hishām ibn ʿAbd al-Malik. Robert Hamilton subsequently argued that the palace was a residence of al-Walid ibn Yazid, a nephew of Hisham who was famous for his extravagant lifestyle. Archaeologically it is certain that the site is a product of the Umayyad dynasty in the first half of the 8th century, although the specifics of its patronage and use remain unknown.\n\nHisham's Palace belongs to the category of desert castles, a collection of monuments dating to the Umayyad dynasty and found throughout Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Palestine. Although there is great variation in the size, location, and presumed function of these different sites, they can be connected to the patronage of different figures in the Umayyad ruling family. Though it has been described as one of the Umayyad desert castles, Hisham's Palace is located in a fertile area. Consequently, it has become more common to refer to it as a qasr (plural: qusur), an Arabic word roughly translating to \"palace\". As a category of building, the Umayyad qusur had several typical characteristics. The main structure was usually two-storeys tall and consisted of ranges of buildings arranged around a courtyard. Other buildings were often found nearby, creating a complex of related structures. This could include a bath building, a mosque, outlying residential buildings, and a large walled enclosure called a hayr that extended east beyond the buildings.\nThe site is commonly thought to have been destroyed during the earthquake of 749 and then abandoned, but an analysis of Baramki's detailed reporting shows that this is incorrect. Instead the ceramic record indicates that the occupation continued through the Ayyubid-Mamluk period, with a significant phase of occupation between 900 and 1000 during the Abbasid and Fatimid periods. A 2013 geological investigation of the site suggest the palace was destroyed by the later earthquake of 1033. Evidence of faulting and damage corresponded to a more severe earthquake than that of 749.\n\nExcavation history\nThe site was discovered in 1873. The northern area of the site was noted, but not excavated, in 1894 by F. J. Bliss. Palestinian archaeologist Dimitri Baramki carried out major excavations at the palace between 1935 and 1948. In 1959 Baramki's colleague, colonial administrator for the British Mandate government Robert Hamilton, published the major work on Hisham's Palace, Khirbat al-Mafjar: An Arabian Mansion in the Jordanian Valley. Unfortunately, Baramki's archaeological research is absent from this volume, so Hamilton's analysis is exclusively art historical. Baramki's research on the archaeological aspects of the site, particularly the ceramics, was published in various preliminary reports and articles in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. When Hisham's Palace was discovered there were few similar sites known which could aid interpretation. Since then nearly 40 Umayyad qusur have been identified. Many of the finds from Baramki and Hamilton's excavations are now held in the Rockefeller Archeological Museum in East Jerusalem.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the West Bank was annexed by the Kingdom of Jordan. This meant that archaeological sites in the area came under the administration of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. Baramki was offered the position of director with authority over sites in the West Bank, but he decided to work at the Palestine Archaeological Museum instead. Awni Dajani was appointed to the role; Dajani's family owned the land where Hisham's Palace had been discovered and he began new excavations there in 1957 and continued into the 1960s. Dajani dug to the north of the bathhouse; the results were only partially published and the first plan of the excavated area was created decades after Dajani's investigations.\nAcross 1994 and 1995, control of archaeological sites in Areas A and B of the West Bank was transferred to the Department of Antiquities of the newly formed Palestinian National Authority. The department initiated international partnerships to address a skills gap resulting from Palestinians being excluded from archaeological investigations in Palestine under occupation. One such project was the conservation of Hisham's Palace. The work led by the department began at the palace in 1996 with funding from the Italian government and the involvement of UNESCO and the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum.\nIn 2006, new excavations were initiated under Hamdan Taha of the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The Jericho Mafjar Project investigating the site was a collaboration between the ministry and archaeologists from the University of Chicago.\nBetween 2009 and 2014 Mahmoud Hawari led investigations of the landscape around the palace to better understand how Hisham's Palace was connected to its hinterland. In 2015, an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to enable the 825 square metres (8,880 sq ft) mosaic in the palace, one of the largest in the world, to be uncovered and readied for display.\n\nArchitecture\nThe palace, bath complex, and external mosque are enclosed by a retaining wall. The southern gate was known from Baramki's excavations, but the 21st-century discovery of a northern gate in alignment indicates that the development of Hisham's Palace was conceived of as a complete unit to be constructed at once.\n\nPalace\nThe largest building at the site is the palace, a roughly square building with round towers at the corners. It originally had two stories. Entrance was through a gate on the center of the east side. The inner rooms were aligned around a central paved portico (riwaq), which featured an underground cellar (sirdab); for refuge from the heat. The room to the south of the portico was a mosque with a mihrab built into the outer wall.\n\nOuter pavilion and mosque\nIn the courtyard east of the palace-and-baths complex was a pavilion containing a monumental fountain. A second, larger mosque was located inside the complex, north of the palace gateway.\n\nBath complex\nThe bath complex is located just north of the palace across an open area. This free-standing structure is almost 30 meters square, more precisely 827 square metres (8,900 sq ft), and three of its sides feature semi-circular exedrae which project out from the building, three each to the south and west, and two to the east. The east face of the bath had an ornate entrance in its center, flanked by exedrae. Along much of the southern side of the main, square hall is a pool. The  interior floor surface of the bath complex was paved with mosaic decoration. A special reception room, or diwan, was entered from the northwest corner. The floor of this room is paved with the famous \"tree of life\" mosaic, depicting a lion and gazelles at the foot of a tree.\nThe actual bathing rooms were attached to the northern wall of the complex, and were heated from below the floor by hypocausts.\n\nAgricultural annex\nTo the north of the bath complex are the ruins of a large square structure which has clearly gone through many phases of reuse and reconstruction. This part of the site was initially assumed to be a khan or caravanserai, but recent excavations have indicated that the northern area had an agricultural function connected to the hayr or agricultural enclosure during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods.\n\nPhoto gallery\nDecorative elements\nThe decorative elements at Hisham's Palace are some of the finest representations of Umayyad period art and are well documented in the publications of Robert Hamilton.\n\nMosaics\nThe floor of the main bathing hall is covered with colorful geometric mosaics, at the center of which is a large kaleidoscope design. The enormous mosaic is divided into 25 square bays that are separated by pier clusters. A large variety of geometric designs cover the floor, which are rarely repeated. The colors used are primarily blue, red, green, yellow, and orange. After years of restoration funded by Japan, the mosaic covering 836 square metres (9,000 sq ft), one of the largest floor mosaics in the world, with more than five million distinctive pieces of stone from Palestine, was unveiled in October 2021. This floor mosaic is one of the largest that has survived from the ancient world.\n\nThe most famous mosaic at the site is the \"Tree of Life\" mosaic in the diwan, or the private audience room, located in the northwestern corner of the main bathing hall. The pavement mosaic depicts a fruiting tree with two unknowing gazelles on the left side and a lion attacking another gazelle on the right side. It is a popular design throughout Islamic history in places like Northern Syria and Transjordan, and has been a popular topic of conversation as there are numerous theories related to its meaning. One idea is that the mosaic represents the peace that the caliph brought with his military prowess. Another idea stems from the border of the mosaic, which resembles the tassels of a curtain or drape. During the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid periods, court accounts recall that the caliphs sat behind curtains from where they appeared at specified moments in various rituals. The tassels that border the \"Tree of Life\" mosaic may suggest that the scene of the lion and gazelles should be understood through a lens of intimacy.\nAll of the mosaics found at Hisham's Palace are of very high quality and feature a wide variety of colors and figural motifs.\n\nCarved stucco\nThe carved stucco found at the site is also of exceptional quality. Of particular note is the statue depicting a male figure with a sword, often presumed to be the caliph, which stood in a niche above the entrance to the bath hall. Additional male and female figures carved in stucco, some semi-nude, adorn the bath complex. Geometric and vegetal patterns are also quite common.\nWhile Hamilton described the carvings at Hisham's Palace as amateurish and chaotic, many subsequent art historians have noted similarities with Iranian themes. Hana Taragan has argued that the artistic themes seen at the site are Levantine examples of an Islamic visual language of power that coalesced from Sasanian influences in Iraq. Priscilla Soucek has also drawn attention to the site's representation of the Islamic myth of Solomon.\n\nPhoto gallery\nConservation\nAccording to the Global Heritage Fund (GHF), the rapid urban development of Jericho, as well as expansion of agricultural activity in the area, are limiting archaeologists' access to the site, much of which remain unexplored. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting important structures have been hindered by lack of resources. In a 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, GHF identified Hisham's Palace as one of 12 worldwide heritage sites most \"On the Verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction. Hamdan Taha of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has published reports concerning the preservation of this and other sites in the Jericho region. In 2020, it was added to the tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Palestine.\nIn 2021, the restoration of the bath complex's 835-square-meter mosaic floor was completed, at a cost of 12 million USD and with Japanese funding, with a dome-shaped shelter protecting the mosaics, which was designed and executed by a Japanese architecture office. The mosaics can be viewed from walkways suspended over the floor.\n\nMuseum\nThe Hisham's Palace Museum is located within the grounds of the Hisham's Palace archaeological site. The museum was established in 2000. It displays relics and examples of pottery from the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, discovered within the Umayyad palace complex. The museum also houses ancient artifacts from the Khirbet al-Mafjar site.\n\nTourism\nHisham's Palace is one of the most important Islamic monuments in Palestine, and is a major attraction for both visitors and Palestinians. In 2010, according to figures collected by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the site received 43,455 visitors. The site is a common field trip destination for Palestinian schoolchildren. Foreign visitors who enter Palestine through the nearby Allenby Bridge often make Hisham's Palace their first stop. The site has been visited by foreign dignitaries, and was the set for a production of Shakespeare's Richard II in 2012.\nSince 2021, the mosaic floor of the bath complex has been opened to the public after the completion of restoration and preservation work and the building of a shelter provided with walkways placed above the floor.\n\nSee also\nLevantine archaeology\nList of archaeological sites in Israel and Palestine\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nHamilton, Robert W.

          "content": "Tell es-Sultan (Arabic: تل السلطان, lit. Sultan's Hill), also known as Tel Jericho or Ancient Jericho, is an archaeological site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Palestine, in the city of Jericho, consisting of the remains of the oldest fortified city in the world.\nIt is located adjacent to the Ein es-Sultan refugee camp, two kilometres north of the centre of the Palestinian city of Jericho. The tell was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, which makes Jericho among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. The site is notable for its role in the history of Levantine archaeology.\nThe area was first identified as the site of ancient Jericho in modern times by Charles Warren in 1868, on the basis of its proximity to the large spring of Ein es-Sultan, that had been proposed as the spring of Elisha by Edward Robinson three decades earlier.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nEpipalaeolithic\nThe droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas came to an end around 9600 BCE, ushering in the Holocene epoch and the Epipaleolithic period of human history. The resulting warmer climate made it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. The first permanent settlement at Tell es-Sultan—marked by the construction of  Natufian structures—developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE, which appears to predate the invention of agriculture. Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby Ein as-Sultan spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (c. 8500–7500 BCE) saw the emergence of one of the world's first major proto-cities. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed \"Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the Sultanian era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet.\nThe PPNA-era town, a settlement of around 4 hectares (9.9 acres), contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. Circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\nThe identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had cultivated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.\nThe town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 metres (12 ft) high and 1.8 metres (6 ft) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower was the tallest structure in the world until the Pyramid of Djoser, and the second-oldest tower after the one at Tell Qaramel. The wall and tower were built around 8000 BCE. For the tower carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization and division of labour.\nThe major structures help understand Sultanian settlements in the southern Levant.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or an early example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumbprints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21 ft × 13 ft)) and a second slightly smaller room (7 m × 3 m (23 ft × 10 ft)) containing internal divisions. The remaining areas are small, and presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven human skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modeled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\n\nBronze Age\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in the Early Bronze Age, around 2600 BCE. Tell es-Sultan has been occupied, destroyed, and abandoned many times, as evidenced by its many destruction layers.\nThe site appears to have been continuously occupied from the Early Bronze Age into the early part of the Middle Bronze Age.  Radiocarbon dating suggests the city was destroyed and abandoned around 2000/1950 BCE. The city was subsequently reconstructed, reaching its greatest extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. At that time, it was a small but important city of the Canaan region which reflected the greater urbanization in the area. The city has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. It was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment;... part of a complex system\" of defenses (pp. 213–218).\nThe city was destroyed again in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. The calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer date to 1617–1530 BCE. Although this destruction is dated to 16th century by carbon dating, scholars propose that this destruction could be ascribed to either Ahmose I(1549-1524 BCE), whose royal signet was found in the necropolis in a slightly later LB I tomb, or Tuthmose III(1479-1425 BCE), whose scarab was recovered from a cemetery northwest of Jericho. Following this destruction, the town was reoccupied again during the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its surviving crest. According to Lorenzo Nigro, the top Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century materials.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the early 6th century.\n\nAbandonment of the tell\nIn response to Judah's revolts against Babylon, Jericho was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587/586 BCE. The city was rebuilt during the Persian period after the Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity. There are very few remains from this period, and the site was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.\n\nArchaeological excavation\nThe first excavations of the tells around Ain es-Sultan (Arabic: عين سلطان, lit. 'Sultan's spring') were made by Charles Warren in 1868 on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Warren excavated nine mounds in the area of the spring; during one of the excavations his workmen dug through the mud bricks of the wall without realizing what it was.\nThe spring had been identified in 1838 in Edward Robinson's Biblical Researches in Palestine as \"the scene of Elisha's miracle\", on the basis of it being the primary spring near to Jericho. On this basis Warren proposed the surrounding mounds as the site of Ancient Jericho, but he did not have the funds to carry out a full excavation. Believing that it was clearly the spring where Elisha healed, he suggested shifting the entire mound for evidence, which he thought could be done for £400.\nErnst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the biblical account of the Battle of Jericho. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle Bronze Age (1950–1550 BCE).\nThe site was again excavated by John Garstang between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the Bible, and dated to around 1400 BCE.\nExtensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by Kathleen Kenyon between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a tower and wall in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the Neolithic, and were part of an early proto-city. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by earthquakes. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep plastered escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top.\nLorenzo Nigro and Nicolo Marchetti conducted excavations in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome \"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha.\nRenewed excavations were carried out at Tell es-Sultan from 2009 to 2023 by the Italian-Palestinian Expedition directed by Lorenzo Nigro for Sapienza University of Rome and Jehad Yasine for the Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities of Palestine. These works uncovered several monuments of the Bronze Age City: the Palaces on the Spring Hill (Early Bronze II–III, 3000–2350 BCE; MB I–II, called \"Palace of the Shepherds Kings\" and the MB III palace, called \"Hyksos' Palace\"), the south-east Gate, called Jerusalem Gate, and several traits of the ancient city walls.\n\nWalls\nThe PPNA-era city wall was designed for either defensive or flood protection purposes; the mass of the wall (approximately 1.5 to 2 metres (4.9 to 6.6 ft) thick and 3.7 to 5.2 metres (12 to 17 ft) high) as well as that of the tower suggests a defensive purpose as well. It is suggested to date to approximately 8000 BCE. If interpreted as an \"urban fortification\", the Wall of Jericho is the oldest city wall discovered by archaeologists anywhere in the world. Surrounding the wall was a ditch 8.2 metres (27 ft) wide by 2.7 metres (9 ft) deep, cut through solid bedrock with a circumference around the town of as much as 600 metres (2,000 ft). Kenyon commented that the \"labour involved in excavating this ditch out of solid rock must have been tremendous.\"\n\nTower of Jericho\nThe Tower of Jericho is an 8.5-metre-tall (28 ft) stone structure, built in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period around 8000 BCE. It is among the earliest stone monuments of mankind. Conical in shape, the tower is almost 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter at the base, decreasing to 7 metres (23 ft) at the top, with walls approximately 1.5 metres (5 ft) thick. It contains an internal staircase with 22 stone steps.\n\nComparative Chronology\nReferences\nBibliography\nJacobs, Paul F. (2000). \"Jericho\".

Sultan's Hill), also known as Tel Jericho or Ancient Jericho, is an archaeological site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Palestine, in the city of Jericho, consisting of the remains of the oldest fortified city in the world.\nIt is located adjacent to the Ein es-Sultan refugee camp, two kilometres north of the centre of the Palestinian city of Jericho. The tell was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, which makes Jericho among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. The site is notable for its role in the history of Levantine archaeology.\nThe area was first identified as the site of ancient Jericho in modern times by Charles Warren in 1868, on the basis of its proximity to the large spring of Ein es-Sultan, that had been proposed as the spring of Elisha by Edward Robinson three decades earlier.",

          "content": "Mount Gerizim ( GHERR-iz-im; Samaritan Hebrew: ࠄࠟࠓࠬࠂࠟࠓࠩࠆࠝࠉࠌ, romanized: ʾĀ̊rgā̊rīzem; Hebrew: הַר גְּרִזִים, romanized: Har Gərīzīm; Arabic: جَبَل جَرِزِيم, romanized: Jabal Jarizīm, or جَبَلُ ٱلطُّورِ, Jabal at-Ṭūr) is one of two mountains near the Palestinian city of Nablus and the biblical city of Shechem, located in the north of Palestine’s West Bank. It forms the southern side of the valley in which Nablus is situated, the northern side being formed by Mount Ebal. The mountain is one of the highest peaks in the West Bank and rises to 881 m (2,890 ft) above sea level, 70 m (230 ft) lower than Mount Ebal. The mountain is particularly steep on the northern side, is sparsely covered at the top with shrubbery, and lower down there is a spring with a high yield of fresh water. The mountain is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where, upon first entering the Promised Land after the Exodus, the Israelites performed ceremonies of blessings, as they had been instructed by Moses.\nIn Samaritan tradition, it is the oldest and most central mountain in the world, towering above the Great Flood and providing the first land for Noah’s disembarkation. Samaritans believe that Mount Gerizim is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac. Jews, on the other hand, consider the location of the near-sacrifice to be Mount Moriah. Samaritans regard Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem's Temple Mount, as the location chosen by God for a holy temple. A Samaritan Temple was located on Mount Gerizim from the 5th century BCE until it was destroyed in the 2nd century BCE. Mount Gerizim continues to be the centre of Samaritan religion, and Samaritans ascend it three times a year: at Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot.\nThe Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza and an Israeli settlement, Har Brakha, are situated on the ridge of Mount Gerizim. During the First Intifada in 1987, many Samaritan families relocated from Nablus to Mount Gerizim to avoid the violence. Today, about half of the remaining Samaritans live near Gerizim, mostly in the village of Kiryat Luza.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of the mountain may mean \"mountain of the Girzites\", a tribe of Philistia that, according to the Hebrew Bible, was conquered by David. Another possible meaning is \"mountain cut in two\".\n\nHistory\nBronze Age\nThe Israelites are believed to have entered Canaan sometime in the 12th or 13th century BCE, around the time of the Late Bronze Age collapse. According to the Book of Deuteronomy, when they first entered Canaan the Israelites celebrated the event with ceremonies of blessings that took place on Mount Gerizim, and cursings on nearby Mount Ebal.\nThe Pulpit Commentary suggests that these mountains were probably selected because they are located roughly in the center of Israel. A commentary in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that \"the face of Gerizim, the mount of blessing, is the more fertile; the opposite face of Ebal, the mount of curse, much the more bare\", but the Pulpit Commentary states that both Gerizim and Ebal are \"equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation\".\nThe Masoretic Text version of Deuteronomy says that Moses had also commanded the Israelites to build an altar on Mount Ebal, constructed from natural (rather than cut) stones, to place stones there and whiten them with lime, to make sacrificial offerings on the altar, eat there, and write the Mosaic Law in stones there. The Samaritan Pentateuch version of Deuteronomy, as well as an ancient manuscript of the biblical text found in the Qumran Caves, both contain the same text as the Masoretic Text, with the only difference being the name \"Gerizim\", instead of \"Ebal\", therefore stating that Moses commanded the building of the altar on Mount Gerizim. Recent work on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which include the oldest surviving manuscripts of Deuteronomy, further supports the accuracy of the Samaritan Pentateuch's designation of Mount Gerizim, rather than Mount Ebal, as the first location in the Promised Land where Moses commanded an altar to be built.\nAll versions of Deuteronomy then have Moses specifying how the Israelites should split into two groups. The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin were to go to Gerizim to pronounce blessings, while those of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were to remain on Ebal to pronounce curses.\n\nIron Age\nThe altar on Mount Ebal is again mentioned in the Book of Joshua, when, after the Battle of Ai, the Israelites build an altar of unhewn stones and make offerings on it, and Joshua inscribes the Law of Moses on the stones. The Israelites then split into the two groups specified in the Book of Deuteronomy to pronounce blessings on Mount Gerizim and curses on Mount Ebal.\nMount Gerizim is also the setting of the first parable in the Bible. According to a narrative in the Book of Judges, Jotham ascends to the summit of Mount Gerizim and delivers the \"Parable of the Bramble King\" to the people of Shechem. The parable is a story about the trees who wanted to appoint the bramble (possibly Ziziphus spina-christi, a thorny tree with crooked branches) as their king, an allusion to the people of Shechem who wanted to make the ungodly and treacherous Abimelech their king.\n\nPersian period\nSanballat I established a Samaritan temple dedicated to Yahweh at the summit of Mount Gerizim in the mid-to-late 5th century BCE. Josephus describes the construction of the Temple on Gerizim and says it was modeled on the Temple in Jerusalem. A city of more than 10,000 inhabitants named Luzah (modern-day Kiryat Luza) was situated adjacent to the temple. By that time, the Israelites were divided as \"Samaritans\" and \"Jews\", both claiming descendance from the Biblical Israelites and preaching adherence to the Torah, but differing on the holiest place on Earth to adore God: Mount Gerizim for the Samaritans, and Jerusalem for the Jews.\n\nHellenistic period\nDuring the 3rd century BCE, the Samaritans built an ancient city adjacent to Mount Gerizim, which became the capital of the Samaritan community. In 168 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes constructed a temple for the worship of Zeus Xenios (Zeus as the patron of hospitality and guests, avenger of wrongs done to strangers) on Mount Gerizim.\n\nReligious rivalry between Samaritans and Jews led to the destruction of the Mount Gerizim Temple by the latter in 112–111 BCE, on orders of John Hyrcanus. Even after the destruction of their temple by the Jews, Mount Gerizim continued to be the holiest place for the Samaritans, as mentioned in the Gospel of John in the New Testament. Coins produced by a Roman mint situated in Nablus, dated to 138–161 CE, seemingly depict the destroyed Samaritan temple, showing a huge temple complex, statues, and a staircase leading from Nablus to the temple.\n\nRoman Empire\nIn the Gospel of John, in his discussion with the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus discusses the merits of worshipping at the Mount Gerizim Temple (as the Samaritans did) versus at the Temple in Jerusalem (as the Jews then did): Jesus said to her, \"Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\"\nIn 36 CE, unrest flared in Samaria when a Samaritan prophet (possibly Dositheos) rallied Samaritans to Mount Gerizim, promising to show them the sacred vessels buried there by Moses. Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judaea, alarmed by the growing assembly, deployed troops to block their ascent. This led to clashes, fatalities, and arrests, prompting Samaritan leaders to accuse Pilate of brutality. In response, Lucius Vitellius, the legate of Syria, deposed Pilate (replacing Pilate with Marcellus) and sent him to Rome for investigation by Emperor Tiberius, who died before Pilate's arrival.\nIn the summer of 67, during the First Jewish–Roman War, a large group of armed Samaritans gathered on Mount Gerizim. Vespasian dispatched Legio V Macedonica (commanded by Cerialis) to disarm and disperse them. While some surrendered upon the Romans' arrival, the majority chose to fight. According to Josephus, the Roman forces slaughtered 11,600 Samaritans in this conflict.\nIn the late 4th century, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, Samaritans were barred from worshiping on Mount Gerizim. In 475, a Christian church was built on its summit. In 484, during the reign of Emperor Zeno, a martyrium-type octagonal church dedicated to the Theotokos (the God-bearing Virgin Mary) was erected at the site. In 529, Justinian I made Samaritanism illegal and arranged for a protective wall to be constructed around the church. As a result, the same year, Julianus ben Sabar led a pro-Samaritan revolt and by 530 had captured most of Samaria, destroying churches and killing priests and officials. However, in 531, after Justinian enlisted the help of Ghassanids, the revolt was completely quashed, and surviving Samaritans were mostly enslaved or exiled. In 533, Justinian had a castle constructed on Mount Gerizim to protect the church from raids by the few disgruntled Samaritans left in the area.\nAccording to Abu'l-Fath, Continuation of the Samaritan Chronicle, during Sukkot in the seventh year of Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil's reign (855), the governor of Nablus forbade Samaritans from praying aloud and blowing the shofar. However, the following Thursday, they ascended the mountain and prayed loudly without interruption.\n\nArchaeology\nExcavations at the site were initiated in 1983 and continued until 2006, yielding tens of thousands of finds. Remnants found there identified that a Samaritan temple existed atop Mount Gerizim by the mid-5th century BCE and that it was destroyed and rebuilt in the early 2nd century BCE, only to be destroyed again in 111–110 BCE by Jewish forces. The archeological finds have shown that the precincts of the Samaritan temple, not including its gates, measured roughly 98 square metres (1,050 square feet). Inside the perimeter, thousands of pottery vessels and burned bones of animal sacrifices were found – sheep, goats, cattle, and doves – as well as many stones with inscriptions containing the Tetragrammaton (the name of God).\nIn 475, a Christian church was built on the summit. As a result of the fortified church and the previous Samaritan temple, extensive ruins still exist at the somewhat plateau-like top of Gerizim. The line of the wall around the church can easily be seen, as can portions of the former castle, and initial archaeological study of the site postulated that the castle built by Justinian had used stones from an earlier structure on the site, probably the Samaritan temple. In the centre of the plateau is a smooth surface, containing a hollow.\nThe excavation, initiated when the site was in the possession of Jordan and continued under Israeli rule, uncovered Corinthian columns, a large rectangular platform surrounded by walls 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick and 9 m (30 ft), and a staircase leading down from the platform to a marbled esplanade. The complex also has a series of cisterns in which ceramics dated to the late Roman period were found. These discoveries are now called \"structure A\", and have been dated to the time of Hadrian from excavated coins and external literary evidence. Underneath these remains was found a large stone structure built on top of the bedrock. This structure, now known as \"structure B\", has no internal rooms or dividing walls and consists almost entirely of uncut limestone slabs fitted together without any mortar. Structure B was surrounded by a courtyard similar to the platform above it, and from ceramics found in a cistern cut into the bedrock at its northern side, it was dated to during or just before the Hellenistic period. The excavating archaeologist considered structure B to be the altar built by the Samaritans in the 5th or 6th century.\n\nSee also\nSamaritan revolts\n\nReferences\nCited works\nBerlin, Adele (2011).

          "content": "The Herodeion (Ancient Greek: Ἡρώδειον), in Latin: Herodium, in Modern Hebrew: הרודיון Herodion, known in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (Arabic: جبل فريديس, lit. '\"Mountain of the Little Paradise\"') is a fortified desert palace built by Herod the Great, king of Judaea, in the first century BCE. The complex stands atop a hill in the Judaean Desert, approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Jerusalem and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) southeast of Bethlehem, between Beit Ta'mir, Za'atara to the east and Jannatah, Tekoa and Nokdim to the west. The site is located at an elevation of 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level.\nHerodium was originally built by Herod to commemorate his victory in 40 BCE over the Hasmonean ruler Antigonus II Mattathias during their struggle for control of Judaea. The site stands atop an artificial, cone-shaped hill that dominates the surrounding landscape and can be seen from Jerusalem. At its summit, Herod's engineers built a fortified palace with double walls, towers, a Roman-style bathhouse, banquet halls, and residential quarters. At the base, a lower palace complex was built complete with gardens, courtyards, and a large pool fed by aqueducts. According to the historian Josephus, Herod was buried at the site following his death in 4 BCE.\nHerodium remained active during the Jewish–Roman wars. Jewish rebels occupied the site during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), repurposing the dining hall into a synagogue before it was captured by the Romans in 71 CE. The fort was again used as a rebel base during the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 CE), after which it was abandoned. From 1972 onward, intermittent excavations were carried out by Prof. Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2007, he found and identified the long sought-after tomb of King Herod on the northern slope of the hill. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill; he fell to his death at the site in 2010.\nThe site is in Area C of the West Bank, formally under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Civil Administration, a body of military officers, and in practice it is administered jointly with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Israel asserts that it is entitled to work in the area under the Oslo Accords, but the Palestinian authorities say Israel has no right to undertake digs there or remove artifacts that Israel discovered in excavations there.\n\nEtymology\nHerodium is the only site that is named after King Herod the Great. It was known by the Crusaders as the \"Mountain of Franks\". Palestinian locals historically called it Jabal al-Firdous or Jabal al-Fureidis (Arabic: جبل فريديس, lit. \"Mountain of the Little Paradise\"); Edward Robinson in 1838 described it as \"Frank Mountain\", in reference to the Crusaders.\nIn 1841, Edward Robinson's identified the site in Biblical Researches in Palestine as Herodium based on the description found in Josephus. Josephus described a palace fortress and a small town, named after Herod the Great, built between 23 and 15 BCE. A sarcophagus discovered in 2007 was claimed to belong to Herod as it was more ornate than others found in the area.\nThe modern English name is a transliteration of the Greek spelling (Ancient Greek: Ἡρώδειον). This is followed by the Modern Arabic (Arabic: هيروديون) and the Modern Hebrew (Herodion Hebrew: הרודיון). The name Herodis (Hebrew: הרודיס) was found in the 1960s inscribed in one of the Bar Kokhba letters recovered from the Muraba’at Caves in the Judaean desert, and is thought to represent the original Hebrew name for the site.\n\nHistory\nConstruction\nIn 40 BCE, after the Parthian conquest of Syria, Herod fled to Masada. On the way, at the location of Herodion, Herod clashed with Jews loyal to his enemy Antigonus, and emerged victorious. According to the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, he \"built a town on that spot in commemoration of his victory, and enhanced it with wonderful palaces... and he called it Herodion after himself\".\nJosephus describes Herodium as follows:\n\nThis fortress, which is some sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem, is naturally strong and very suitable for such a structure, for reasonably nearby is a hill, raised to a (greater) height by the hand of man and rounded off in the shape of a breast. At intervals it has round towers, and it has a steep ascent formed of two hundred steps of hewn stone. Within it are costly royal apartments made for security and for ornament at the same time. At the base of the hill there are pleasure grounds built in such a way as to be worth seeing, among other things because of the way in which water, which is lacking in that place, is brought in from a distance and at great expense. The surrounding plain was built up as a city second to none, with the hill serving as an acropolis for the other dwellings.\nArchaeologists believe that the palace was designed by architects and built by slaves and paid workers (contractors).  Herod was considered one of the greatest builders of his time and was not daunted by geography—his palace was built on the edge of the desert and was situated atop an artificial hill. The largest of the four towers was built on a stone base 18 meters in diameter. This was most likely where Herod lived; he decorated his rooms with mosaic floors and elaborate frescoes. The other three towers, which consisted of living spaces and storage, were 16 meters in diameter. Outside, several cisterns were built to collect water that was channeled into the palace.\nThe city of Herodium served as a capital of a toparchy.\n\nGreat Jewish Revolt\nDuring the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), Herodium was held by Jewish rebels. At some point during the revolt, the fort's defenders transformed Herod's triclinium into a synagogue. In 68 CE, rebel leader Simon bar Giora, then operating from nearby Teqoa, attempted to seize Herodium. He sent an emissary, Eleazar, to persuade the garrison to surrender, but the defenders uncovered the plot and expelled him. Eleazar then threw himself from the fortress ramparts.\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Herodium remained one of three major fortresses (alongside Machaerus and Masada) still under rebel control, though the specific faction holding it is uncertain. By this time, the site appears to have been defended by a relatively small force, likely joined by refugees fleeing Jerusalem. Herodium was ultimately captured, likely in early 72 CE, by the Roman legate Sextus Lucilius Bassus. The fortress seems to have fallen rapidly, as Josephus provides only a brief mention of its surrender.\n\nBar Kokhba revolt\nAt the beginning of the Bar Kokhba revolt sixty years later, Simon bar Kokhba declared Herodium as his secondary headquarters. The fortress was commanded by Yeshua ben Galgula, who was likely in Bar Kokhba's second or third line of command. Archaeological evidence for the revolt was found all over the site, from the outside buildings to the water system under the mountain. Inside the water system, supporting walls built by the rebels were discovered, and another system of caves was found. Inside one of the caves, burned wood was found which was dated to the time of the revolt.\nAs in other parts of Judea during the final stages of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the rebels active in Herodium likely sought shelter in nearby refuge caves, including the cave of El Matzia.\n\nExcavation history\nUpper Herodium\nThe archaeological excavation of Herodium was begun in 1962 by Virgilio Canio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, from the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, and it continued until 1967: they discovered the upper citadel, at the top of the hill.\n\nLower Herodium\nFrom 1972, excavations were carried out by Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and they were intermittent until the archaeologist's death in 2010. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill.\n\nDescription\nHerod's hilltop palace\nHerod the Great built a palace within the fortress of Herodium. Herod himself commissioned a lavish palace to be built between 23 and 15 BCE atop Herodium for all to see. The palace itself consisted of four towers of seven stories, a bathhouse, courtyards, a Roman theatre, banquet rooms, a large walkway (\"the course\"), as well as extravagant living quarters for himself and guests. Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod's Palace.\n\nBathhouse\nThe Roman bathhouse consisted of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite thousands of years of earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, the last stop in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool.\n\nSynagogue\nDuring the First Jewish–Roman War, the defenders of Herodium repurposed an existing structure within the upper palace as a synagogue, considered one of the earliest in the Levant. The original space, formerly Herod's triclinium, underwent renovations that involved installing benches along the walls and constructing a mikveh outside the entrance. There is minimal evidence regarding any alterations made by the defenders to the existing decor or furnishings, and the space essentially functioned as a simple communal hall. The entrance faced eastward, while Jerusalem lay almost due north. The repurposed synagogue lacked specialized features commonly found in synagogues, such as a niche for housing the Torah scrolls and a reading desk.\n\nTheatre\nNetzer discovered the Roman Theatre just before his death in late 2010. The royal theatre was uncovered near the base of Herod's tomb. The theatre contained an elaborately decorated loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 450–650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered, of a kind suggesting that the painters were well travelled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.\n\nPilate ring\nIn 1968–1969, during excavations directed by archaeologist Gideon Foerster, at a section of Herod's burial tomb and palace hundreds of artifacts were found, including a copper alloy ring. The ring was overlooked but in 2018 it was given a thorough laboratory cleaning and scholarly examination. At the center of the ring is an engraved krater, or amphora similar in style to the monumental urn (handleless amphorae or acroteria) of Herodium which is encircled by \"partly deformed\" Greek letters spelling out \"of Pilates\" in Greek. Although scientists were not sure about who is the \"Pilates\" mentioned on the ring, media published that it could have possibly belonged to Pontius Pilate. Archaeologist Roi Porat said that all explanations are equally possible for the owner of the ring: \"It was important to publish a careful scientific article, but in practice we have a ring inscribed with the name Pilate and the personal connection just cries out.\"\nWhile much of the debate has focused on the Greek name inscribed on the ring, the image is of equal significance and may further support that this was the ring used by Pilate's administrative assistant for sealing documents for Pilate. The image on the ring is possibly associated with Roman religious ceremonies (i.e., suovetaurilia, bacchanalia) and the imperial cult that were characteristic of the images on the coins that Pilate had minted during his term as governor.\n\nLegal aspects\nIn February 2013 an exhibit dedicated to Herod at the Israel Museum featured finds from among some 30 tons of material transferred from the Herodium site back into Israel. The Palestinian National Authority protested, and Rula Maayah, the Palestinian tourism and antiquities minister said that according to international law Israelis have no right to excavate Herodium, which is in the occupied West Bank, or to take any antiquities from it. Palestinian officials compared the exhibition to the historical plunder of archaeological treasures by former colonial powers. Some Israeli commentators have argued that, such excavations of, and removal of material from, sites in the Palestinian territories go beyond what is permitted to an occupying power such as Israel. One Israeli archaeologist, Yonathan Mizrachi, in an article co-written with Yigal Bronner, stated that, 'Since Herodion and Herod's palaces in Jericho are located in the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, they are—according to international law, the codes of ethics for the preservation of antiquities, and even the Oslo Accords—supposedly under Palestinian control and responsibility.' The Israel Museum's director, James S. Snyder initially stated that the items from Herodium would be returned to the West Bank after the exhibition, \"in better condition than before\", but later clarified that this did not mean the artifacts would be returned to the Palestinians after the exhibition. The site is in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli control. The Israel Museum cited the Oslo Accords as giving Israel a right to perform archaeology in the territories and said they will return it to the West Bank when the exhibition has ended. In analyzing the controversy, Morag Kersel states that the site is regulated by Israeli military orders, the Jordanian Temporary Law no. 51, 1966, and the Oslo Accords. According to the provisions of the Oslo II Accord, archaeological issues of common interest would be handled by a joint Israeli–Palestinian committee. Few if any of these agreements have been implemented, and Palestinians have not been consulted or asked to collaborate in the work at the site.\n\nFilms\nHerod's Lost Tomb (2008; National Geographic Society), in addition to examining Netzer's purported find of Herod's tomb, the palace and most of Herod's other large projects are reconstructed in CGI.\n\"Finding Jesus: Faith, Fact, Forgery: Season 2, Episode 4: The tomb of Herod\" (2017; CNN), the episode unpacks the epic story of the client king of Judea.\nJesus Christ Superstar (1973), the song \"Then We Are Decided\" was filmed here.\n\nSee also\nAncient synagogues in the Palestine region - covers entire Palestine region/Land of Israel\nHerodian architecture\nJohn McRay\nMachaerus\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nDavies, Gwyn (2023). \"Stamping Out the Embers: Roman \"Mopping-Up\" Operations at the End of the First Jewish Revolt\".

          "summary": "The Herodeion (Ancient Greek: Ἡρώδειον), in Latin: Herodium, in Modern Hebrew: הרודיון Herodion, known in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (Arabic: جبل فريديس, lit. '\"Mountain of the Little Paradise\"') is a fortified desert palace built by Herod the Great, king of Judaea, in the first century BCE. The complex stands atop a hill in the Judaean Desert, approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Jerusalem and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) southeast of Bethlehem, between Beit Ta'mir, Za'atara to the east and Jannatah, Tekoa and Nokdim to the west. The site is located at an elevation of 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level.\nHerodium was originally built by Herod to commemorate his victory in 40 BCE over the Hasmonean ruler Antigonus II Mattathias during their struggle for control of Judaea. The site stands atop an artificial, cone-shaped hill that dominates the surrounding landscape and can be seen from Jerusalem. At its summit, Herod's engineers built a fortified palace with double walls, towers, a Roman-style bathhouse, banquet halls, and residential quarters. At the base, a lower palace complex was built complete with gardens, courtyards, and a large pool fed by aqueducts. According to the historian Josephus, Herod was buried at the site following his death in 4 BCE.\nHerodium remained active during the Jewish–Roman wars. Jewish rebels occupied the site during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), repurposing the dining hall into a synagogue before it was captured by the Romans in 71 CE. The fort was again used as a rebel base during the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 CE), after which it was abandoned. From 1972 onward, intermittent excavations were carried out by Prof. Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2007, he found and identified the long sought-after tomb of King Herod on the northern slope of the hill. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill; he fell to his death at the site in 2010.\nThe site is in Area C of the West Bank, formally under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Civil Administration, a body of military officers, and in practice it is administered jointly with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Israel asserts that it is entitled to work in the area under the Oslo Accords, but the Palestinian authorities say Israel has no right to undertake digs there or remove artifacts that Israel discovered in excavations there.",

Le site de l'Hérodion est classé parc national (Herodion National Park) et dépend de la Direction de la Nature et des Parcs (Israël).\n\nL'Hérodion à l'époque d'Hérode\nLa construction du palais-forteresse\nSelon Flavius Josèphe, l'Hérodion fut édifié sur le lieu même où Hérode remporta une rude bataille contre les Asmonéens et Parthes en 40 av. J.-C.. Bâti suivant un plan circulaire, ses murs, hauts de 12 mètres, étaient flanqués d'une grosse tour ronde (16 mètres de haut) située à l'est et de trois bastions semi-circulaires au nord, au sud, et à l'ouest. Un rempart de pierre et de terre renforçait la base de la forteresse. Un escalier souterrain de 200 marches conduisait à l'intérieur de l'édifice qui renfermait en son sein un palais doté d'un jardin à colonnades et de bains à la romaine. Les murs des salles étaient décorés de stuc et de fresques, les sols pavés de mosaïques. L'Hérodion dominait une ville construite au pied nord de la colline.\n\nSa destruction\nL'Hérodion, fait partie avec Massada et Machéronte, des trois dernières places fortes détenues par les combattants juifs, après la conquête de Jérusalem par les légions romaines en 70. Hérodion fut conquise et détruite par les Romains en 71.\n\nFouilles\nL'Hérodion est signalé dès 1480 par Félix Fabri, un moine dominicain qui y reconnaissait une forteresse des croisés. Un premier plan du site est dressé en 1738 par Richard Pococke. L'identification avec le bâtiment décrit par Flavius Josèphe n'est toutefois certaine qu'à partir des travaux d'Edward Robinson dans les années 1830. Les premières fouilles commencent en 1850 et sont l'œuvre de Félicien de Saulcy. Les années 1870-1880 connaissent d'autres fouilles avant qu'une longue interruption ne laisse le site dans l'ombre. Ce n'est qu'en 1962 en effet que des fouilles archéologiques reprennent. Dirigées par le père Virgilio Corbo du Studium Biblicum Franciscanum à Jérusalem, elles se concentrent sur le sommet du site. Par la suite Ehud Netzer commença ses recherches à partir de 1972. Elles ont d'abord fouillé les bâtiments à la base de la colline. Au printemps 2007, l'équipe de fouille a annoncé avoir retrouvé dans l'édifice sommital les fragments d'un grand sarcophage de grande qualité qui a été interprété comme étant celui d'Hérode. En 2007, l'équipe d'Ehud Netzer a repéré un tombeau à mi-hauteur du tertre, qu'elle considéra comme celui d'Hérode. Des blocs de pierre, restés intacts, servaient d'assise au mausolée, bâti à flanc de coteau.\n\nLa piscine de l'Hérodion\nCette piscine de très grande taille (72 × 46 m) est située au pied de la colline, au nord, est bordée d'un portique à colonnades. En son milieu, une île était surmontée d'une construction circulaire. Elle servait à la fois de réserve d'eau et de bassin d'agrément pour s'y baigner, ou même pour y faire flotter des bateaux. La profondeur du bassin était de 3 m. \nElle était alimentée par un aqueduc depuis les piscines de Salomon.\n\nRéférences\nSources antiques\nFlavius Josèphe, La guerre des Juifs, I, 21, 10.\n\nOuvrages archéologiques\nErnest-Marie Laperrousaz, Trois Hauts Lieux de Judée : L'Hérodium, Massada et Qoumrân, Paris-Méditerranée, 2001\nEhud Netzer, Greater Herodium, QEDEM, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology, Jérusalem, 1981.\n\nVoir aussi\nLiens externes\n(en) herodium.org\n(en) Jacqueline Schaalje, « Herodion », jewishmag.com, 2006.\nVue satellite sur Google Maps\nImages de Herodion\n Portail de l’archéologie   Portail de la Palestine   Portail de la Bible   Portail de l’Israël antique et des Juifs dans l’Antiquité",

          "content": "The Qumran Caves (Arabic: كهوف قمران Kuhūf Qumrān; Hebrew: מערות קומראן HaMeara Kumran) are a series of caves, both natural and artificial, found around the archaeological site of Qumran in the Judaean Desert. It is in these caves that the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.\nIsrael Nature and Parks Authority took over the site following the end of the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and seized Qumran. Israel has since invested heavily in the area to establish the Qumran caves as a site of \"uniquely Israeli Jewish heritage\". The caves are recognized in Israel as a National Heritage Site, despite the caves being in occupied Palestinian territories; as such, the designation has drawn criticism.\n\nCaves\nThe limestone cliffs above Qumran contain numerous caves that have been used over the millennia: the first traces of occupation are from the Chalcolithic period then onward to the Arab period. The artificial caves relate to the period of the settlement at Qumran and were cut into the marl bluffs of the terrace on which Qumran sits.\n\nArtificial caves\nThe artificial marl-cut caves at Qumran were hewn during the site's late Second Temple occupation. This began in the Hasmonean phase, in the late 2nd to early 1st century BCE, and continued in use through the Herodian period. The caves were contemporaneous with the Qumran settlement on the terrace, and they were functionally linked to it.\n\nIn all there are ten marl cut caves in the near vicinity of Qumran: 4Qa, 4Qb, 5Q, 7Q, 8Q, 9Q, 10Q, an oval cave west of 5Q, and two caves to the north in a separate ravine. Their location necessitates a direct connection with the Qumran settlement. The three caves at the end of the esplanade could only be accessed via the settlement. These caves are thought to have been cut for storage and habitation. The artificial caves at Qumran were cut into soft, rapidly weathering marl of the Lisan Formation, which made excavation easy but led to erosion and collapse. The marl-cut caves on the terrace where caves 7Q, 8Q and 9Q were recorded survive only as eroded, partially collapsed remains.\n4Q, which is now visible from the Qumran esplanade, is actually two caves, one adjacent to the other. De Vaux referred to them as 4a and 4b. When the Ta'amireh removed all the fragments they could before Harding's arrival, there was no way to tell which scrolls belonged to which cave, so they were later all catalogued simply as from 4Q. In excavating the caves hundreds of fragments were still to be found in 4a while only two or three fragments in 4b. 4a was 8 meters long and 3.25 meters wide with tapering walls reaching 3 meters in height.\n\nDead Sea Scrolls Discovery\nIn late 1946 or early 1947, a Bedouin boy of the Ta'amireh tribe, Muhammid Ahmed el-Hamed called edh-Dhib (the wolf), found a cave after searching for a lost animal. He stumbled onto the first cave containing old scrolls. More Ta'amireh visited the cave and scrolls were taken back to their encampment. They were shown to Mar Samuel of the Syriac Orthodox Church in April 1947 who realised their significance and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls was made known. The location of the cave was not revealed for another 18 months, but eventually a joint investigation of the cave site was led by Roland de Vaux and Gerald Lankester Harding from 15 February to 5 March 1949.\nThe interest in the scrolls with the hope of money from their sale initiated a long area-wide search by the Ta'amireh to find more such scrolls, the first result of which was the discovery of four caves in Wadi Murabba'at about 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Qumran in 1951. In the Qumran area another cave was discovered, now referred to as Cave 2Q (1Q was the first scroll-bearing cave), in February 1952. However, only a few fragments were found in the cave. Fear of the destruction of archaeological evidence with the discovery of caves by the Bedouin led to a campaign by the French and American Schools to explore all other caves to find any remaining scrolls. Although 230 natural caves, crevices and other possible hiding places were examined in an 8-kilometer area along the cliffs near Qumran, only 40 contained any artifacts and one alone, 3Q, produced texts, the most unusual being the Copper Scroll.\n\n4Q was discovered in September 1952 by the Ta'amireh. De Vaux, on being offered a vast amount of fragments, contacted Harding who drove to the Qumran site to find that the Bedouin had discovered caves very near the Qumran ruins. These were Caves 4Q, 5Q, and 6Q, the most important of which was 4Q which originally contained around three-quarters of all the scrolls found in the immediate Qumran area. The first two of these caves had been cut into the marl terrace. The third was at the entrance to the Qumran Gorge just below the aqueduct.\nIn 1955, a survey of the terrace brought to light a staircase leading down to the remains of three more artificial caves, 7Q, 8Q and 9Q at the end of the Qumran esplanade, all of which had collapsed and had been eroded, and a fourth cave, 10Q, on the outcrop which housed caves 4Q and 5Q.\nQumran Cave 11 (11Q), discovered by Ta'amireh Bedouin in early 1956, was the final Qumran cave to yield Dead Sea Scrolls. Finds include Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll (11QpaleoLev), the Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), and the Temple Scroll. The Temple Scroll entered scholarly custody in 1967, when Yigael Yadin announced Israel's acquisition following the Six-Day War. Between its discovery in Qumran Cave 11 in early 1956 and its transfer to Israeli custody in June 1967, the Temple Scroll remained outside institutional control in Bethlehem, held by the antiquities dealer Khalil Iskander Shahin (Kando), intermittently offered to authorities and intermediaries, hidden for long periods in his home, and known to scholars only through reports and a small fragment circulated in the early 1960s. After the Six-Day War, Yigael Yadin obtained the scroll from Kando for the Shrine of the Book.  Accounts based on Yadin's narrative and later syntheses specify that Kando concealed the manuscript in a shoebox beneath a floor tile in his Bethlehem shop or home until 1967, when Israeli authorities secured it and paid Kando as part of the acquisition. \nIn February 2017, the discovery of cave 12Q was announced, the contents of which included completely broken storage jars and scroll fragments, but no scrolls themselves. The cave was investigated by J. Randall Price and students of Liberty University in Virginia, along with an international team of archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Iron pickaxe heads from the 1950s were also found, which indicate looting had occurred. In addition, archaeologists discovered pottery, flint blades, arrowheads, and a carnelian seal that date to the Chalcolithic and Neolithic periods.\n\"This exciting excavation is the closest we've come to discovering new Dead Sea scrolls in 60 years. Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave,\" reported Dr. Oren Gutfeld, the head of the excavations.\nAccording to Israel Hasson, Director-General of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), the discovery of this cave showed that significant works were waiting to be done in the Judean Desert and some of important ones were waiting to be revealed.\n\nArchaeological excavations\nIn 1984–1985 Joseph Patrich and Yigael Yadin carried out a systematic survey of over 57 caves north of Qumran and two to the south. In 1985–1991 Patrich excavated five caves, including Caves 3Q and 11Q. One of Patrich's conclusions was that the caves \"did not serve as habitations for the members of the Dead Sea Sect, but rather as stores and hiding places\".\n\nIt was discovered that under the rocks in Cave 3Q there were only a few Chalcolithic sherds, showing that the ceiling had collapsed before any Qumran-era occupation. The cave was uninhabited and used only to store the scrolls left there.\nIn 1988 in the cave Patrich designated as Cave 13, just north of 3Q, a small juglet was found from the Herodian era, which was wrapped in palm fibres and contained a viscous liquid which Patrich presumed was aromatic balsam residue. In 1991 he discovered several jar stoppers and a complete jar along with date stones and dry dates suggesting occupation, but as the area in front of the cave showed no attempt to convert it into a terrace, he concluded that occupation was not of any length.\n11Q was examined and no traces of Qumran era occupation was found. A cave Patrich called Cave 24, which lay between 11Q and 3Q, was large and habitable, but showed no sign of long-term habitation. Cave FQ37 (named in the 1952 survey) located high up on the cliff face 2 kilometers south of Qumran was also an improbable site for permanent dwelling, due to its inaccessibility.\nIn late 1995 and early 1996, Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel carried out further excavations in the caves north of Qumran. They reported other caves not examined by Patrich and believed that they served as dwellings for the inhabitants of Qumran along with other artificial caves that have long ago eroded away from the edge of the marl terrace.\nBroshi and Eshel concentrated their interest in the area just north of Qumran, examining two caves they designated as C and F in a small ravine. The former had part of its ceiling caved in and was filled with silt from flash floods, but contained 280 potsherds. Cave F had completely collapsed, but when excavated yielded 110 potsherds. They concluded that the area was residential.\nTwo other archaeological sites from the same time period, Ein Feshkha, and Ain el-Ghuweir, both located south of Qumran along the shore of the Dead Sea, are also often linked with Qumran.\n\nSee also\nShrine of the Book\nRockefeller Museum\nAntiquities trade\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAllegro, J.

          "content": "Saint Hilarion Monastery, at the archaeological site of Tell Umm el-'Amr, was an ancient Christian monastery. Its excavated ruins lay close to Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe monastery was founded in ca. 340 by Hilarion, a native of the Gaza region and one possible father of Palestinian monasticism (see also Chariton the Confessor). Hilarion had converted to Christianity in Alexandria and then, inspired by St Anthony, become a hermit first in Egypt and then in his home region. He then founded a hermitage close to his home village of Thabatha and by the time Hilarion was sixty-three, the monastery was large and attracted many visitors. Though seemingly back then located in the desert, it was in reality at the crossroads between Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia and is believed to be a center of missionary work in the Gaza region.\n\nThe remains of Saint Hilarion Monastery span more than four centuries, from the Late Roman to the Umayyad period, and are characterized by five successive churches, bath and sanctuary complexes, geometric mosaics, and an expansive crypt. As the hermitage was likely consisting of small hermits' cells according to the tradition of St. Anthony build out of mud bricks and perishable material, resulting in that their remains have not been preserved. The site was abandoned after a seventh-century earthquake and rediscovered by local archaeologists in 1999. The fourteenth century pilgrim Antony of Cremona mentioned in his travel report that there was a church called St. Hilarion in Tabatha, but it is uncertain whether he was referring to a building that still existed or if he was retelling information derived from an earlier source. According to local tradition and observations from Western travelers in the 19th century, the prayer hall of the Monastery of Hilarion is currently occupied by the Mosque of al-Khidr. French explorer Victor Guérin noted that two marble columns in the mosque were possibly parts of the Byzantine-era monastery.\n\nCurrent state\nIn 2015, it was the only archaeological site accessible to the public in Gaza, making it an especially treasured and important cultural heritage. According to the Ministry of Tourism in Gaza, the Saint Hilarion Monastery in 2016 was in dire need of preservation. Current preservation efforts are plagued by war and conflict in the region, as well as a shortage of materials and equipment needed for excavation. The site was included on the 2012 World Monuments Watch and classified as \"Rescue Needed\" by Global Heritage Network.\n\nDamage during the Gaza War\nIn December 2023, UNESCO granted the monastery \"provisional enhanced protection\". In January 2024, Al Jazeera reported that the monastery is one of 195 cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed since Gaza war began. In July 2024, the monastery was included on the List of World Heritage in Danger by UNESCO. The listing was fast-tracked using emergency procedures, with UNESCO expressing \"deep concern about the impact of the ongoing conflict on cultural heritage, particularly in the Gaza Strip\" and stating \"The organization urges all involved parties to strictly adhere to international law, emphasizing that cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes, as it is considered civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nSee also\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTell Umm el-'Amr on Global Heritage Network\nWorld Monuments Fund 2012 Watch List\nSaint Hilarion Monastery.

Located in the Old City of Acre, it is one of the prominent projects constructed during the rule of Ahmed Jezzar Pasha in Galilee, under the Ottoman era.\n\nHistory\nOttoman period\nBeing one of four Khans in Acre, Khan al-Umdan was built in 1784 on the place of the Royal Customs house of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Due to its plethora of columns the khan was named Khan al-Umdan which means \"Inn of the Columns\" or \"Caravanserai of Pillars\". It incorporates forty columns made of granite that were taken from Caesarea, Atlit and the ruins of Crusader monuments in Acre itself.\n\nDue to its proximity to the port, Khan al-Umdan has throughout its history been an important trading spot. Merchants arriving at Acre used the khan as a warehouse while the second floor functioned as a hostel. Camel caravans once brought produce and grain from Galilean villages to the city's markets and port.\nThe khan later gained importance to the Baháʼí Faith (as the Khán-i-'Avámid) as it was the site where Baha'ullah used to receive guests, and later the site for a Baháʼí school.\nIn 1906 a clock tower was added adjacent to the main entrance to the khan to commemorate the silver jubilee of the rule of Ottoman sultan Abd al-Hamid II. It is similar to the Jaffa Clock Tower, a building dedicated to the same purpose, \n along with five more towers in Ottoman Palestine (in Jerusalem, Haifa, Safed, Nablus, and possibly Nazareth) and over a hundred across the entire empire.\n\nModern era\nIn 2001 Khan al-Umdan, together with the rest of Acre's old city, was designated as a World Heritage Site. In 2004 Khan al-Umdan (Hebrew: ח'אן אל עומדאן) was featured on a stamp of Israel worth 1.3 sheqels. Nowadays, the khan is a major tourist attraction open all hours of the day and used as an open-air stage during festivals in the city, such as the theater festival of Acre during the month of October.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

          "content": "The Great Mosque of Gaza, also known as the Great Omari Mosque, is a mosque in a ruinous state, located in Gaza City, in the State of Palestine. Prior to its 2023 partial destruction, it was the largest and oldest mosque in the Gaza Strip.\nBelieved to stand on the site of an ancient Philistine temple, the site was used by the Byzantines to erect a church in the 5th century. After the Rashidun conquest in the 7th century, it was transformed into a mosque. The Great Mosque's minaret was toppled in an earthquake in 1033. In 1149, the Crusaders built a large church. It was mostly destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1187, and then rebuilt as a mosque by the Mamluks in the early 13th century.\nIt was destroyed by the Mongols in 1260, then soon restored. It was destroyed by an earthquake at the end of the century. The Great Mosque was restored again by the Ottomans roughly 300 years later. Severely damaged after British bombardment during World War I, the mosque was restored in 1925 by the Supreme Muslim Council. In 2023, during the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nLocation\nThe Great Mosque is situated in the Daraj Quarter of the Old City in Downtown Gaza at the eastern end of Omar Mukhtar Street, southeast of Palestine Square. Gaza's Gold Market is located adjacent to it on the south side. To the northeast is the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque. To the east, on Wehda Street, is a girls' school.\n\nHistory\nLegendary Philistine roots\nAccording to tradition, the mosque stands on the site of the Philistine temple dedicated to Dagon—the god of fertility—which Samson toppled in the Book of Judges. Later, a temple dedicated to Marnas—god of rain and grain—was erected. Local legend today claims that Samson is buried under the present mosque.\n\nByzantine church\nA Christian basilica was built on the site in the 5th century CE, either during the reign of Eastern Roman Empress Aelia Eudocia, or Emperor Marcianus. In either event, the basilica was finished and appeared on the 6th-century Madaba Map of the Holy Land.\n\nEarly Muslim mosque\nThe Byzantine church was transformed into a mosque in the 7th century by Omar ibn al-Khattab's generals, after the conquest of Roman Palaestina by the Rashidun Caliphate. The mosque is still alternatively named \"al-Omari\", in honour of Omar ibn al-Khattab who was caliph during the Muslim conquest of Palestine. In 985, during Abbasid rule, Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi wrote that the Great Mosque was a \"beautiful mosque.\" On 5 December 1033, an earthquake caused the pinnacle of the mosque's minaret to collapse.\n\nCrusader church\nIn 1149, the Crusaders, who had conquered Gaza in 1100, built a large church atop the ruins of the earlier Byzantine church upon a decree by Baldwin III of Jerusalem. However, in William of Tyre's descriptions of grand Crusader churches, it is not mentioned. Of the Great Mosque's three aisles today, it is believed that portions of two of them had formed part of the Crusader church.\n\nBased on a Jewish bas-relief accompanied by a Hebrew and Greek inscription carved on the upper tier of one of the building's columns, it was suggested in the late 19th century that the upper pillars of the building were brought from a 3rd-century Jewish synagogue in Caesarea Maritima. The discovery of a 6th-century synagogue at  Maiumas, the ancient port of Gaza, in the 1960s make local re-use of this column much likelier. The relief on the column depicted Jewish cultic objects - a menorah, a shofar, a lulav and etrog - surrounded by a decorative wreath, and the inscription read \"Hananyah son of Jacob\" in both Hebrew and Greek. Above it was carved a menorah with a shofar on one side and an etrog on the other. During the late 19th century, the column was part of an old synagogue in Caesarea Maritima and was brought to the mosque for its perceived religious value, as the Caesarea church had appeared in the Madaba Map. The fact that this Jewish symbol was preserved throughout the decades inside the mosque was described as demonstrating \"peaceful coexistence\" by scholar Ziad Shehada.\nIn 1187, the Ayyubids, under Saladin wrested control of Gaza from the Crusaders and destroyed the church.\n\nMamluk mosque\nThe Mamluks reconstructed the mosque in the 13th century. In 1260, the Mongols destroyed it. It was rebuilt, but in 1294, an earthquake caused its collapse.  Extensive renovations centered on the iwan were undertaken by the governor Sunqur al-Ala'i during the sultanate of Husam ad-Din Lajin between 1297 and 1299. A later Mamluk governor of the city, Sanjar al-Jawli, commissioned the restoration of the Great Mosque sometime between 1311 and 1319.\nThe Mamluks rebuilt the mosque completely in 1340. In 1355, Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta noted the mosque's former existence as \"a fine Friday mosque,\" and said that al-Jawli's mosque was \"well-built.\" Inscriptions on the mosque bear the signatures of the Mamluk sultans al-Nasir Muhammad (dated 1340), Qaitbay (dated May 1498), Qansuh al-Ghawri (dated 1516), and the Abbasid caliph al-Musta'in Billah (dated 1412).\n\nOttoman period\nIn the 16th century, the mosque was restored after apparent damage in the previous century. The Ottomans commissioned its restoration and built six other mosques in the city. They had been in control of Palestine since 1517. The interior bears an inscription of the name of the Ottoman governor of Gaza, Musa Pasha, brother of deposed Husayn Pasha, dating from 1663.\n\nSome Western travelers in the late 19th century reported that the Great Mosque was the only structure in Gaza worthy of historical or architectural note. The Great Mosque was severely damaged by Allied forces while attacking the Ottoman positions in Gaza during World War I. The British claimed that Ottoman munitions were stored in the mosque which exploded in the bombardment.\n\nBritish Mandate\nUnder the supervision of former Gaza mayor Sa'id al-Shawwa, it was restored by the Supreme Muslim Council in 1926-27.\nIn 1928, the Supreme Muslim Council held a mass demonstration of Muslims and Christians at the Great Mosque in  support for boycotting elections and participation in the Legislative Assembly of the British Mandate of Palestine government. To increase the number of people in the rally, they ordered all the mosques in one of Gaza's quarters to temporarily close.\n\nPost-1948\nThe ancient inscriptions and bas-relief of Jewish religious symbols were chiseled away intentionally between 1973 and 1993. During the  Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations of Hamas and Fatah, the mosque's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati was shot dead by Fatah gunmen on 12 June 2007, in retaliation for the killing of an official of Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day.\nIn 2019–2020, 211 manuscripts in the library's collection were digitised.\nThe mosque was heavily damaged, with some sources describing it as destroyed, by Israeli bombardment during the Gaza war. Photographs show the central section of the mosque fully collapsed, with its minaret partially toppled. After the 2025 Ceasefire agreement in January, Palestinians near the area started to restore the mosque. As of 28 May 2025, UNESCO confirmed that the mosque was one of more than 100 cultural properties with preliminary damage, assessed on satellite imagery.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Great Mosque has an area of 4,100 square metres (44,000 sq ft). Most of the general structure is constructed from local marine sandstone known as kurkar. The mosque forms a large sahn (\"courtyard\") surrounded by rounded arches. The Mamluks, and later the Ottomans, had the south and southeastern sides of the building expanded.\nOver the door of the mosque is an inscription containing the name of Mamluk sultan Qalawun and there are also inscriptions containing the names of the sultans Lajin and Barquq.\n\nInterior\nWhen the building was transformed from a church into a mosque, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched western entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. One of the columns was reused from an ancient synagogue.\nInternally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the western facade's oculus. The floors are covered with glazed tiles. The columns are also made of marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.\nThe central nave is groin-vaulted, each bay being separated from one another by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles. The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face, sitting on a raised plinth. The two aisles of the mosque are also groin-vaulted. Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque had a white marble minbar (\"pulpit\"); it still exists today. There is a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663, containing the name of Musa Pasha, a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule.\n\nMinaret\nThe mosque is well known for its minaret, which is square-shaped in its lower half and octagonal in its upper half, typical of Mamluk architectural style. The minaret is constructed of stone from the base to the upper, hanging balcony, including the four-tiered upper half.  The pinnacle is mostly made of woodwork and tiles, and is frequently renewed. A simple cupola springs from the octagonal stone drum and is of light construction similar to most mosques in the Levant. The minaret stands on what was the end of the eastern bay of the Crusader church. Its three semicircular apses were transformed into the base of the minaret.\n\nSee also\nAttacks on religious sites during the Israeli invasion of Gaza\nConversion of non-Islamic places of worship into mosques\nDestruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\nIslam in Palestine\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\nList of churches in Palestine\nChurch of Saint Porphyrius, second Crusader-built church in Gaza\nList of mosques in Palestine\nSayed al-Hashim Mosque, Gaza\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nOsheroff, Eli; Halevy, Dotan (2019), \"Destruction as Layered Event: Twentieth Century Ruins in the Great Mosque of Gaza\", International Journal of Islamic Architecture, 8 (1): 45–69, doi:10.1386/ijia.8.1.45_1, ISSN 2045-5895\n\nExternal links\n\nPalestinians pray in the Great Omari Mosque in Gaza Archived 2013-10-20 at the Wayback Machine Ma'an News Agency.",

It belongs to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and is the oldest active church in the city. Located in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City of Gaza, it is named after the 5th-century bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, whose tomb is situated in the northeastern corner of the church.\nOn 19 October 2023, during the Gaza war, a building from the church compound was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing 18 Palestinian civilians, but the church building itself was not damaged.\n\nHistory\nSaint Porphyrius of Gaza\nThe  Patriarch of Jerusalem appointed Saint Porphyrius (c. 347–420), when he was aged 45, as custodian of the  Venerable Wood of the Cross of the Lord. He was described by the Roman Christian hagiographer Mark the Deacon, Porphyrius' companion from 395 until 420, as the Christianizer of the \"disobedient pagan people of Gaza.\" According to the legend, there was a terrible drought in Gaza that ended only after Saint Porphyrios and a group of 280 Christians prayed to God with \"fasting, vigil and procession.\" This led to the conversion of 25 pagans, as rain in this region was considered God's greatest gift.\n\nThe Byzantine- and Crusader-period churches\nA church was built on the site as early as AD 425, and was  converted into a mosque in the 7th century.\nThe current church was built by the Crusaders in the 1150s or 1160s; they probably dedicated it to St Porphyrius as well. Records from the 15th century however show that the church was also dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nThe church was renovated in 1856.\n\nGaza wars\nIn the 2014 Gaza War, around 2,000 Palestinians slept in the church compound during Israeli bombings.\nThe church premises were again used as refuge for hundreds of civilians during the Gaza war, which started on October 7, 2023. On 19 October 2023, it was the site of an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, which hit two halls sheltering Gazan Palestinian Muslims and Christians, causing the collapse of at least one building, and killed 18 civilians. Over 450 Palestinians had been sheltering there. A church annex was targeted again in July 2024.\n\nDescription\nThe church pavement is far below ground level (1.8 meters (5.9 ft) in its southern part, and 3 meters (9.8 ft) on the northern side), suggesting that the present building was built atop of an earlier church structure. There are some cornices and bases that date back to the  Crusader period, but much of the other portions are later additions.\n\nThe church is rectangular in shape, with a half-dome roof over the altar apse. It consists of a single aisle made up of two groin-vaulted bays, with a projecting semi-circular apse preceded by a barrel-vaulted  presbytery. Internally, the building measures 22.9 meters (75 ft) by 8.9 meters (29 ft), including the apse. It has architectural and constructional similarities with the Crusader-period former Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (currently the Great Mosque of Gaza).\nThe church has three entrances. The main entrance is at the western façade and has a portico with three marble columns supporting two pointed arches. The column bases date to the Crusader period. A second entrance passes through the former medieval window on the southern side of the west bay, enlarged to become a door opening onto a women's gallery added in the modern period, equipped with stairs for going down to the level of the pavement. The third entrance, which  offers access from the north side toward the eastern bay, seems to also be of recent date in its current form, probably dating to the 1856 restoration, but retains several medieval elements.\n\nThe thick-walled structure is supported by horizontal marble and granite columns and pilasters.\n\nSee also\nDestruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\nGaza Baptist Church,  Protestant church of Gaza City\nHoly Family Church, Gaza,  Latin Catholic church of Gaza City\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\nList of oldest church buildings\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Saint Porphyrius Church (Gaza City) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nÉglise Saint-Porphyre (in French), part of Gaza, inventaire d’un patrimoine bombardé",

          "content": "Silwan or Siloam (Arabic: سلوان, romanized: Silwan; Greek: Σιλωάμ, romanized: Siloam; Hebrew: כְּפַר הַשִּׁילוֹחַ, romanized: Kfar ha-Shiloaḥ) is a predominantly Palestinian district in East Jerusalem, on the southeastern outskirts of the current Old City of Jerusalem.\nIt is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament; in the latter it is the location of Jesus' healing the man blind from birth. Medieval Silwan began as a farming village, dating back to the 7th century according to local traditions, while the earliest mention of the village is from the year 985. From the 19th century onwards, the village was slowly being incorporated into Jerusalem until it became an urban neighborhood.\nAfter the 1948 war, the village came under Jordanian rule. Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 Six-Day War, since which it has been occupied by Israel. Silwan is administered as part of the Jerusalem Municipality.\nIn 2016,  Haaretz reported that the Israeli government and the  settler organization Ateret Cohanim were working together to evict Palestinians living on property classified as heqdesh,  especially in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.\nDepending on how the neighborhood is defined, the Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are about 500 to 2,800 Jews.\n\nGeography\nSilwan is located southwest of the Old City Walls and constitutes part of the Jerusalem's \"Holy Basin\". The neighborhood has a narrow shape on a north-to-south axis. It is bounded by  Wadi Hilweh and Abu Tor to the west and the Ras al-Amud neighborhood to east. Its southern tip touches the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood and its northern tip touches the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.\nBuilt on the southern ridge of the Mount of Olives, Silwan slopes steeply from approximately 700–600 metres (2,300–2,000 ft) above sea level, until it reaches the Kidron Valley, which bounds it in the west. The historical core lies  is in the northwestern section, considered to be the site of ancient Jerusalem. Dozens of ancient burial tombs attributed to the time of ancient Israel and Judah as well as the Byzantine rule were found there. Arab villagers used the tombs as dwellings or enclosures for livestock. Many of the burial tombs are inhabited until today. The village was built next to numerous water sources of historical importance, such as the Pool of Siloam (Ain Silwan), Gihon Spring and Ein Rogel. The rest of the village was built in the 19th century.\n\nHistory\nIron Age\nIn the ancient period, the area where the village stands was occupied by the necropolis of the Biblical kingdom. In the valley below, according to the Hebrew Bible, \"the waters of Shiloah go softly\" (from the Gihon Spring; Isaiah 8:6) and \"the Pool of Siloam\" (Nehemiah 3:15) to water what since King Solomon became known as the king's garden (Jeremiah 39:4; 52:7; 2 Kings 25:4; Nehemiah 3:15).\nThe necropolis, or ancient cemetery, is an archaeological site of major significance. It contains fifty rock-cut tombs of distinguished calibre, assumed to be the burial places of the highest-ranking officials of the Judean kingdom. Tomb inscriptions are in Hebrew. One of the ancient rock-cut tombs in Silwan is  known as the Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter. Another notable tomb, called the Tomb of the Royal Steward is now incorporated into a modern-period house. The ancient inscription states that it was the final resting place of \"\"...yahu who is over the house.\" The first part of the Hebrew name is effaced, but refers to a Judean royal steward or chamberlain. The inscription \nis now in the collection of the British Museum.\nAt their first thorough archaeological investigation, all of the tombs were long since emptied, and their contents removed. A great deal of destruction was done to the tombs over the centuries by Roman-period quarrying and later by their conversion for use as housing, both by monks in the Byzantine period, when some were used as churches, and later by Muslim villagers \"...when the Arab village was built; tombs were destroyed, incorporated in houses or turned into water cisterns and sewage dumps.\"\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Siloam was built around the \"serpent-stone\", Zoheleth, where Adonijah gave his feast in the time of Solomon.\n\nThe Siloam inscription was discovered in the water tunnel built during the reign of Hezekiah, in the early 7th century BC. The Siloam inscription is now preserved in the Archeological Museum of Istanbul, Turkey. Another important inscription found at Siloam is the lintel of Shebna-yahu's tomb (known as the Shebna Inscription), which is in the collections of the British Museum. In 2004, archaeologists excavating the site for the Israel Antiquities Authority found biblical-era coins marked with ancient Hebrew writing, pottery shards and a stone bottle cork that confirmed the identification of the site as the biblical Siloam Pool.\n\nRoman period\nThe King's Garden was used as a staging area for Jewish pilgrims who, during the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, used the spring-fed Pool of Siloam to wash and ritually purify themselves before ascending the monumental stepped street to the Temple Mount while singing hymns based on Psalms. On Sukkot water was brought from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple and poured upon the altar and the priests also drank of this water.\nIn the New Testament, the collapse of the Tower of Siloam is cited by Jesus as one of two examples where sudden, untimely death came to people who didn't necessarily deserve it more than most other sinful people.\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Jesus healed a man who had been blind from birth. Jesus spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man's eyes. He then told the man, \"Go wash yourself in the Pool of Siloam.\" So the man went and washed and came back seeing.\nJosephus described the waters of Siloam as \"sweet and abundant\". During the general outbreak of hostilities between the Jewish nation and the Roman Imperial army in ca. 66 CE, Simon bar Giora controlled all of the \"Upper City\" where he made his place of residence in the Phasael tower before abandoning it, and part of the \"Lower City\" (Acra) as far as the great wall in the Kidron Valley and the fountain of Siloam, now in Silwan.\n\nByzantine period\nA pool and church were built at Siloam by the Byzantine empress Eudocia (c. 400–460 CE) to commemorate Jesus' miraculous healing of the blind.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nLocal folklore dates Silwan to the arrival of the second Rashidun caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab from Arabia. According to one resident's version of the story, the Greeks were so impressed that the Caliph entered on foot while his servant rode on a camel that they presented him with the key to the city. The Caliph thereafter granted the wadi to \"Khan Silowna,\" an agricultural community of cave dwellers living in ancient rock-cut tombs along the face of the eastern ridge.\nIn medieval Muslim tradition, the spring of Silwan (Ayn Silwan) was among the four most sacred water sources in the world. The others were Zamzam in Mecca, Ayn Falus in Beisan and Ayn al-Baqar in Acre. Silwan is mentioned as \"Sulwan\" by the 10th-century Arab writer and traveller al-Muqaddasi. In his 985 book he noted that (as rendered in the edition by Le Strange) \"The village of Sulwan is a place on the outskirts of the city [Jerusalem]. Below the village of 'Ain Sulwan (Spring of Siloam), of fairly good water, which irrigates the large gardens which were given in bequest (Waqf) by the Khalif 'Othman ibn 'Affan for the poor of the city. Lower down than this, again, is Job's Well (Bir Ayyub). It is said that on the Night of 'Arafat the water of  the holy well Zamzam, at Makkah, comes underground to the water of the Spring (of Siloam). The people hold a festival here on that evening.\"\nMoshe Gil interprets statements by Muqaddasi (writing in 985), Nasir-i Khusraw (1047), and Yaqut (1225), as meaning that what they called the Spring of Silwan can only be a water source located at quite a distance farther south, Khusraw actually indicating a distance of c. 3 km from Jerusalem's walls. This leads to Gil identifying this \"Spring of Silwan\" with what we know today as the Spring of Bir Ayyub (biblical Ein Rogel), whose exact location in those days cannot be pinpointed anymore, but was in any case several km away from the city walls.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596, Ayn Silwan appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Quds of the Liwa of Quds, with a population of 60 households, all Muslim. They paid a total of 35,500 akçe in taxes, and all of the revenues went to a Waqf.\nIn 1834, during a large-scale peasants' rebellion against Ibrahim Pasha, thousands of rebels infiltrated Jerusalem through ancient underground sewage channels leading to the farm fields of the village of Silwan. A traveller to Palestine in 1883, T. Skinner, wrote that the olive groves near Silwan were a gathering place for Muslims on Fridays.\nIn 1838 Silwan was noted as a Muslim village, part of el-Wadiyeh district, located east of Jerusalem.\nA photograph of the village taken between 1853 and 1857 by James Graham can be found on page 35 of Picturing Jerusalem by photographers James Graham and Mendel Diness. It shows the western part of the modern village as empty of habitations, a few trees are scattered across the southern ridge with the small village confined to the ridgetop east of the valley.\nIn the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the Mount of Olives. Nineteenth-century travellers described the village as a robbers' lair. Charles Wilson wrote that \"the houses and the streets of Siloam, if such they may be called, are filthy in the extreme.\" Charles Warren depicted the population as a lawless set, credited with being \"the most unscrupulous ruffians in Palestine.\"\nAn official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Silwan had a total of 92 houses and a population of 240, though the population count included only men.\nIn 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Silwan as a \"village perched on a precipice and badly built of stone. The waters is brought from Ain Umm ed Deraj. There are numerous caves among and behind the houses, which are used as stables by the inhabitants.\"\nModern settlement of the western ridge of the modern urban neighborhood of Silwan, called Wadi Hilweh in Arabic and dubbed in 1920 \"the City of David\" by Jewish-French archaeologist de:Raymond Weill (1874–1950), began in 1873–1874, when the Meyuchas family moved out of the Old City to a new home on the ridge.\nIn books published between 1888 and 1911, travellers describe the valley floor as verdant and cultivated, with the stony village perched along the top of the eastern ridge hillside. Explorer Gustaf Dalman (1855–1941) describes the manner in which the villagers of Silwan irrigated their vegetable crop which they planted on terraces. The village of Silwan was located on the eastern slope of the Kidron Valley, above the outlet of the Gihon Spring opposite Wadi Hilweh. The villagers cultivated the arable land in the Kidron Valley, which in biblical tradition formed the king's gardens during the Davidic dynasty, to grow vegetables for market in Jerusalem.\nBetween 1885 and 1891, 45 new stone houses were built for a Yemenite Jewish community in what is now the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.  The neighbourhood included a place of worship now known as the Old Yemenite Synagogue.\nIn 1896 the population of Silwan was estimated to be about 939 persons.\n\nBritish Mandate\nAt the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, \"Selwan (Kfar Hashiloah)\" had a population of 1,901 persons; 1,699 Muslims, 153 Jews and 49 Christians, where the Christians were 16 Roman Catholics and 33 Syrian Catholics. In the same year, Baron Edmond de Rothschild bought several acres of land there and transferred it to the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association. By the time of the 1931 census, Silwan had 630 occupied houses and a population of 2968; 2,553 Muslims, 124 Jews and 91 Christians (the last including the Latin, Greek and St. Stephens convents).\nIn the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, the Yemenite community was removed from Silwan by the Welfare Bureau of the Va'ad Leumi into the Jewish Quarter as security conditions for Jews worsened, and in 1938, the remaining Yemenite Jews in Silwan were evacuated by the Jewish Community Council on the advice of the police. According to documents in the custodian office and real estate and project advancement expert Edmund Levy, the homes of the Yemenite Jews were occupied by Arab families without registering ownership.\n\nThe British Mandatory government began annexing parts of Silwan to the Jerusalem Municipality, a process completed by the final Jordanian annexation of remaining Silwan in 1952.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Silwan grew northward towards Jerusalem, expanding from a small farming village into an urban neighborhood. Modern Arab Silwan encompasses Old Silwan (generally to the south), the Yemenite village (to the north), and the once-vacant land between. Today Silwan follows the ridge of the southern peak of the Mount of Olives to the east of the Kidron Valley, from the ridge west of the Ophel up to the southern wall of the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Silwan was 3,820; 3,680 Muslims and 140 Christians, with a total of 5,421 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, Arabs used 58 dunams for plantations and irrigable land and 2,498 for cereals, while Jews used 51 for cereals. A total of 172 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian period\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Silwan came under Jordanian administration along with the rest of the West Bank, and land there owned by Jews was managed by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property. It remained under Jordanian rule until 1967, when Israel captured the Old City and surrounding region. Until then, the village had delegates in the Jerusalem City Council.\n\nDisplacement of Palestinians\nSince the 1967 Six-Day War Silwan has been under Israeli occupation, and Jewish organizations have sought to re-establish a Jewish presence there. The Ir David Foundation and the Ateret Cohanim organizations are promoting resettlement of Jews in the neighborhood in cooperation with the Committee for the Renewal of the Yemenite Village in Shiloah.\nIn 1987, the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to inform him of Israeli settlement activity; his letter noted that an Israeli company had taken over two Palestinian houses in the neighborhood of al-Bustan, after evicting their occupants, claiming the houses were its property. Wadi Hilweh, an area of Silwan close to the southern wall of the Old City, and its neighborhood of al-Bustan, has been ever since a focus of Jewish settlement.\n\nJewish settlements\nIn 1991, a movement was formed to promote Jewish settlement in Silwan. Some Silwan properties had already been declared absentee property in the 1980s, and suspicions arose that a number of claims filed by Jewish organizations had been accepted by the Custodian without any site visits or follow-up. Property in Silwan has been purchased by Jews through indirect sales, some by invoking the Absentee Property Law. In other cases, the Jewish National Fund signed protected tenant agreements that enabled construction to proceed without a tender process.\nAs of 2004, more than 50 Jewish families live in the area, some in homes acquired from Arabs who claim they did not know they were selling their homes to Jews, some in Beit Yonatan.\nIn 2003, Ateret Cohanim built a seven-storey apartment building known as Beit Yonatan (named for Jonathan Pollard) without a permit. In 2007, the courts ordered the eviction of the residents, but the building was approved retroactively. In 2008 a plan was submitted for a building complex including a synagogue, 10 apartments, a kindergarten, a library and underground parking for 100 cars in a location 200 meters from the Old City walls.\nRabbis for Human Rights-North America, which changed its name to T'ruah in 2012, accused Elad of creating a \"method of expelling citizens from their properties, appropriating public areas, enclosing these lands with fences and guards, and banning the entrance of the local residents...under the protection of a private security force.\" Approximately 1,500 supporters of RHR-NA/T'ruah wrote to Russell Robinson, CEO of JNF-US, to demand an end to the eviction of a Silwan family.\nOvernight on September 30, 2014, at 1:30 am, settlers, supported by police officers and reportedly connected to the Ir David Foundation, commonly known as Elad, entered 25 houses in 7 buildings which previously belonged to several Palestinian families in the neighborhood, in what was the largest Israeli purchase of homes in Silwan since 1986. Most were vacant, but in one house where a family was evicted a confrontation broke out. Details concerning the process whereby the properties were purchased are lacking, but Palestinian middle men appear to be involved, buying the six houses, and then selling them to a private American company, Kendall Finance. Elad stated that the houses had been bought properly and legally. Advertisements were posted on Facebook offering Jewish ex-army veterans $140 a day to sit in the properties until families move in. As those who sell land to Israelis may be sentenced to death by the PA, the son of one Palestinian family who sold his property has fled Jerusalem, in fear for his life. Some of the Palestinian families claiming ownership intended to get the settlers out by taking legal steps.\nIn response to this move, on October 2, 2014, the European Union condemned settlement expansion in Silwan. White House spokesman Josh Earnest, in a condemnation of the takeover, described the new occupants as \"individuals who are associated with an organization whose agenda, by definition, stokes tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"baffled\" by US criticism, deeming it \"un-American\" to criticize the legal purchase of homes in East Jerusalem to either Jews or Arabs.\nOn June 15, 2016, Jerusalem's City Hall approved the construction of a three-storey residential house for Jews wishing to make Silwan their home.\nA ruling handed down by the Jerusalem Magistrats Court in January 2020 gave a substantial boost to efforts by the settler organization Ateret Cohanim to evict large numbers of Palestinians in Silwan from their homes. The organization managed to take over control of an Ottoman era (19th century) Jewish trust, called the Benvenisti Trust after Rabbi Moshe Benvenisti, and claims that land in areas of Silwan, such as the Batan al-Hawa neighborhood, was 'sacred religious land' and that Palestinians residing on this trust land were illegal squatters. The decisions are thought to effectively threaten with displacement some 700 Palestinians in Silwan.\n\nThe Sumreen (or Sumarin) family\nThe house where the family lives is in the middle of an area designated by Israel as \"the City of David National Park.\" where a right-wing, pro-settler organization, Elad, runs an archaeological and biblical theme park known as City of David.\nIn December 2011, a board member of the Jewish National Fund's US fundraising arm resigned in protest after a 20-year legal process came to a head with an order for the eviction of a Palestinian family from a JNF-owned home. The home had been acquired via the Absentee Property Law. Several days before the order was carried out, JNF announced it would be delayed.\nIn 2011 the verdict was overturned. In 2017, the claim was successfully renewed. In September 2019, the Sumreen family lost an appeal and appealed to the District Court. In June 2020, the appeal was rejected. After criticism from many directions the JNF has asked for a rehearing of the proceedings. In August, the eviction process was suspended. JNF and Elad are in disagreement over the process.\nOn 9 January 2022, following receipt of an opinion stating \"there is no objection to the expulsion\" from Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, a decision by the Supreme Court is awaited.\nOn 3 April 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against eviction and that the JNF's subsidiary Heimanuta must pay compensation of 20,000 shekels ($5,560).\n\nHousing demolition and construction permits\nIn 2005, the Israeli government planned to demolish 88 Arab homes in al-Bustan neighborhood built without permits but they were not found illegal in a municipal court.\nAccording to the State Comptroller's report, there were 130 illegal structures in Silwan in 2009, a tenfold increase since 1967. When enforcement of the building code began in al-Bustan in 1995, thirty illegal structures were found, mostly old residential buildings. By 2004, the number of illegal structures rose to 80. The municipality launched legal proceedings against 43 and demolished 10, but these were soon replaced by new buildings.\nThe group Ir Amim argues that the illegal construction is due to insufficient granting of permits by the Jerusalem municipality. They say that under Israeli administration, fewer than 20 permits, mainly minor, were issued for this part of Silwan, and that as a result, most building in this part of Silwan and the whole neighborhood generally lack permits. They also say that as of 2009, the vast majority of buildings in the neighborhood were built without permits, in particular in al-Bustan. In 2010, Ir Amim's petition to halt a municipal zoning plan for the City of David area was rejected. The plan does not call for demolition of illegal construction, but rather regulates where construction may continue. The group said that the plan favored the interests of Elad and the neighborhood's Jewish residents, while Elad said that the plan allotted only 15 percent of construction to Jews versus 85 percent to Arab residents. The mukhtar of Silwan objected to Ir Amim's petition against the plan. \"We have said that there are good aspects of the plan and there are bad aspects of the plan, we're still working it all out. But to come and say that the whole plan is bad, and to ask that it be done away with, then what have you accomplished? Nothing.\"\n\nTorching of olive trees\nIn May 2010, a group of Israeli settlers torched \"an 11-Dunam olive orchard in al-Rababa valley, in Silwan, south of the Old City of Jerusalem\" which included the destruction of three olive trees that were over 300 years old. In a 2011 New York Times article, these attacks were called \"price tag\" attacks.\n\nDemography\nThe Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies put the number of residents to 19,050 in 2012. However, the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are difficult to define, in contrast to the Jewish neighborhoods, because dense construction has blurred older boundaries and Silwan is now merged with Ras al-Amud, Jabel Mukaber and Abu Tor. The Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are fewer than 700 Jews.\n\nPalestinian cultural activities\nThe Silwan Ta'azef Music School opened in October 2007. Since November 2007, an art program, language courses for women, men and children, leadership training for teenage girls, cooking classes, an embroidery club and swimming classes have opened in Silwan. In 2009, a local library was established. The Silwan theater group is led by a professional actress from Bethlehem. Many of these activities take place at the Madaa Silwan Creative Center.\n\nArchaeology\nSilwan necropolis\nA part of Silwan was built around and above the Silwan necropolis, a series of rock-cut structures originally used as Iron Age tombs, but repurposed for various uses over the millennia.\n\nWadi Hilweh\nThe ridge to the west of Silwan, part of the Wadi Hilweh Arab neighbourhood and known as the City of David in archaeological and tourism contexts, is believed to be the original Bronze Age and Iron Age site of Jerusalem.  Archaeological exploration began in the 19th century. Vacant during most of the Ottoman period, Jewish and Arab settlement began in the late 19th century.\nThe National-Religious Jewish settlers' organisation, ElAd, was accused of excavating on Palestinian property and beginning its work on the City of David tunnels before receiving a permit from the Jerusalem Municipality.\nThe general area was thought by many historical geographers to be that of Josephus' Acra, so-named after an old fortress that was once there, an area also called the \"Lower City.\"\nIn 2007, archaeologists unearthed under a parking lot a 2,000-year-old mansion that may have belonged to Queen Helene of Adiabene. The building includes storerooms, living quarters and ritual baths.\nIn 2008, Islamic-era skeletons discovered in the course of excavations have disappeared.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nAncient Silwan (Shiloah) Siloam in Israel and The City of David\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:   IAA, Wikimedia commons\nSilwan & Ath Thuri (Fact Sheet) Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, ARIJ\nAerial photo, ARIJ\nSilwan (Shiloah) in Antiquity Archaeological Survey of Israel\nEast Jerusalem: 'Every action in this area is very sensitive' – video, The Guardian\nEast Jerusalem: Witnessing the truth – video, The Guardian\nHome Demolition and Forced Displacement in Silwan, The Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem\nA City Divided: Jerusalem's Most Contested Neighborhood, Vice News\nOverview of the Yemenite Village Adjacent to the Gihon Spring, by Ateret Cohanim\nWadi Hilweh Information Center",

Medieval Silwan began as a farming village, dating back to the 7th century according to local traditions, while the earliest mention of the village is from the year 985. From the 19th century onwards, the village was slowly being incorporated into Jerusalem until it became an urban neighborhood.\nAfter the 1948 war, the village came under Jordanian rule. Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 Six-Day War, since which it has been occupied by Israel. Silwan is administered as part of the Jerusalem Municipality.\nIn 2016,  Haaretz reported that the Israeli government and the  settler organization Ateret Cohanim were working together to evict Palestinians living on property classified as heqdesh,  especially in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.\nDepending on how the neighborhood is defined, the Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are about 500 to 2,800 Jews.",

          "title": "Lifta",
          "content": "Lifta (Arabic: لفتا; Hebrew: ליפתא) was a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled by Zionist paramilitary forces during the 1948 Palestine war.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the village was recorded to have a population of 400 Arabs, all Muslim households. In 1834, a battle took place in the village during the Palestinian Peasants' Revolt. A British 1922 census registered Lifta's population at 1,451, all Muslims.\nPrior to 1948, the village had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. In the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians. In addition, a small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian Arab majority as 'excellent'.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine war, a massacre occurred on 28 December 1947, when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on a cafe in Lifa. The mukhtar's home was also incinerated by the Zionist forces and 20 buildings were blown up as the village was put under siege. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled, and the abandoned village was later repopulated by Jewish immigrants until the 1970s. In July 2017, Israel declared Lifta (called Mei Neftoach) as a national nature reserve. It has been referred to as the \"Palestinian Pompeii\".\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nA perennial spring located in the channel's upper section is believed to be the site where the village first developed. Surrounding this spring, artifacts including a burial cave and pottery shards from the Middle Bronze Age II and Iron Age II periods were uncovered.\nArchaeological remains dating as far back as Iron Age II have been found in the village.\n\nBiblical identification\nThe site is considered by some to be identical with biblical Hebrew: מי נפתוח Mei Neftoach. It was populated since ancient times; \"Nephtoah\" (Hebrew: נפתח, lit. spring of the corridor) is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the border between the Israelite tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and was the northernmost demarcation point of the territory of the Tribe of Judah. Other scholars hold the identification to be plausible but by no means certain. Kitchener and Conder found the identification with Nephtoah unsatisfactory, and preferred to identify Lifta with Eleph of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28).\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nThe Romans and Byzantines called it Nephtho, and the Crusaders referred to it as Clepsta.\n\nCrusader period\nThe remains of a court-yard home from the Crusader period remains in the centre of the village.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596, Lifta was a village in the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Jerusalem under the liwa' (district) of Jerusalem, and it had a population 72 Muslim households, an estimated  396 persons. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, fruit orchards and vineyards; a total of 4,800  akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1834, a battle took place here, during the revolt of that year. The Egyptian Ibrahim Pasha and his army fought and defeated local rebels, led by Shaykh Qasim al-Ahmad, a prominent local ruler. However, the Qasim al-Ahmad family remained powerful and ruled the region southwest of Nablus from their fortified villages of Deir Istiya and Bayt Wazan some 40 kilometers (25 mi) due north of Lifta. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted  Lifta  as a Muslim village, located in the Beni Malik area, west of Jerusalem. Robinson hired muleteers from Lifta, noting that in Lifta \"every peasant keeps his mule and usually accompanies it\".\nIn 1863 Victor Guérin described Lifta as being surrounded by gardens of lemon-trees, oranges, figs, pomegranates, alms and apricots. An Ottoman village list of about 1870 indicated 117 houses and a population of 395, though the population count included men, only.\nThe PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described it as a village on the side of a steep hill, with a spring and rock-cut tombs to the south.\nIn 1896 the population of Lifta was estimated to be about 966 persons.\nIn 1907 the German historian Gustav Rothstein was invited to Lifta by his Arabic language teacher, Elias Nasrallah Haddad. Rothstein wrote a 20-pages article describing the marriage celebrations and religious festivals in Lifta.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nIn 1917, Lifta surrendered to the British forces with white flags and, as a symbolic gesture, the keys to the village.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, Lifta had a population 1,451, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census (when Lifta was counted with \"Shneller's Quarter\"), to 1,893; 1,844 Muslims, 35 Jews and 14 Christians, in a total of 410 houses.\nDuring the 1929 Palestine riots, according to one Israeli source, some villagers from Lifta were among gangs that  participated in a number of robberies and attacks on nearby Jewish communities.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians, and the total land area was 8,743 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. 3,248 dunams were for cereals, while 324 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nPrior to 1948, the village, with a population of some 2,500 people, had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. A small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian majority as 'excellent'.\n\n1948 war and depopulation\nIn the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Lifta, Romema, and Shaykh Badr which were strategically located on the road leaving Jerusalem to Tel-Aviv, were an operational priority for Jewish forces.  Some families had already left the village after a decision had been made  somewhat earlier on 4 December, to evacuate its women and children, in order to host a military company, and on 4 December 1947 some Arab families left. By mid-December irregular Arab militia took up positions in Lifta to defend the site. Hagannah patrols engaged in firefights with the village militiamen while Irgun and Lehi were even more aggressive. On 28 December 1947, the village suffered from what survivors called the Lifta massacre when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on the café of Salah Eisa. In order to warn residents that they should evacuate, the mukhtar's home was incinerated, and 20 buildings blown up as the village was put under siege. The attack left seven dead, and more women and children left the village. The village was suffering from food shortages in the beginning of January. Subsequently, a number of the villagers returned home, with Benny Morris reporting \"some, or most\" doing so. Subsequently, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, while visiting the village, ordered the women, children and elderly to evacuate and the men to stay put. On 29 January, a Lehi raid blew up 3 houses in the village. By early February the village was abandoned by the irregular militia. Benny Morris lists the cause of the depopulation of the village as being a military assault on the settlement.\nAccording to one resident, interviewed in 2021, there were are around 40,000 descendants of the original refugee population, dispersed in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan and the Palestinian diaspora. Several families still retain their Ottoman period property deeds, attesting to their ownership of parts of Lifta.\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the expulsion of its Palestinian villagers, of Lifta's 410 homes, 60 stone houses, some three stories high, remained, together with its  mosque, an olive press, and a tiled pathway to a spring. It is listed by Unesco as a potential World Heritage Site, and in 2018, the World Heritage Fund registered the village among a list of 24 heritage sites that were endangered.\nLifta was used for Jewish refugee housing during the war, and following the war the Jewish Agency and the state of Israel settled Jewish immigrants from Yemen and Kurdistan in the village, totaling 300 families. However ownership of the houses was not registered in their name. Living conditions in Lifta were difficult, the buildings were in poor repair, poor roads and transport, and lack of electricity, water, and sanitation infrastructure. In 1969-71 most of the Jewish inhabitants of Lifta chose to leave as part of a compensation program by Amidar. Holes were drilled in the roofs of the evacuated buildings to make them less inhabitable, so that squatters wouldn't take up residence. 13 families, who lived in the portion of the village close to Highway 1 and didn't suffer from transportation issues chose to remain.\nIn the 1980s, Lifta was declared a municipal nature reserve under the auspices of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.\nIn 1984, one of the abandoned buildings in the village was occupied by the \"Lifta gang\", a Jewish group plotting the blow up the mosques on the Temple Mount, who were stopped at the gates of the site with 250 pounds of explosives, hand grenades, and other armaments.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Jewish residents, some of the buildings in the village were used for Lifta drug abuse rehabilitation center for adolescents, which was closed in 2014, and from 1971 for the Lifta high school, an open education school, which relocated to German Colony, Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nIn 2011, plans were announced to demolish the village and build a luxury development consisting of 212 luxury housing units and a hotel. Former residents brought a legal petition to preserve the village as a historic site. Lifta was the last remaining Arab village that was depopulated to have not been either completely destroyed or re-inhabited.  In 2012, the  plans to rebuild the village as an upscale neighborhood were rejected by the Jerusalem District Court.\nBy 2011, three books about the Palestinian village history had been published.\nIn June 2017 the last Jewish residents left the village following a settlement with the government who acknowledged they were not squatters but rather resettled in Lifta by the appropriate authorities.\nIn July 2017 Mei Neftoach was declared a national nature reserve. 55 out of 450 pre-1948 stone houses are still standing.\nIn 2021, the Israel Land Administration, without informing beforehand the Jerusalem Municipality authorities,  announced on Jerusalem Day that it was reported to be preparing a tender for the  construction of a luxury neighborhood on the village's ruins, projected to consist of  259 villas, a hotel, and a mall. On 11 August 2022, the plan to demolish Lifta and build luxury housing was shelved, with new Jerusalem mayor Moshe Lion seeking to preserve the village of Lifta and transform it into a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The previous Mayor of Jerusalem, Israeli businessman and politician Nir Barkat, had initially approved the plan for Lifta's demolition before changing his mind, opposing the development plans after visiting the site. Currently, Lifta is still on the list of UNESCO's tentative World Heritage Sites.\n\nArchaeology\nIn 2010, an archaeological survey was conducted at Lifta by Mordechai Heiman on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).\n\nArab traditional dress\nLifta was among the wealthiest communities in the Jerusalem area, and the women were known for their fine embroidery Thob Ghabani bridal dresses were sewn in Lifta. They were made of ghabani, a natural cotton covered with gold color silk floral embroidery produced in Aleppo, and were narrower than other dresses. The sleeves were also more tapered. The sides, sleeves and chest panel of the dress were adorned with silk insets. The dresses were ordered by brides in Bethlehem. The married women of Lifta wore a distinctive conical shaṭweh head-dress, that was also worn in Bethlehem, Ayn Karim, Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\nNotable people\nRasmea Odeh\nYahya Hammuda\n\nSee also\nAli Abunimah\nList of modern names for biblical place names\nPalestinian costumes\nZochrot\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Lifta, palestineremembered.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, Zochrot\n[1], The Ruins of Lifta (2016)\nIsrael Antiquities Authority, Jerusalem, Lifta, Survey (2010)\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nLifta in Antiquity Archaeological Survey of Israel\nF.A.S.T.-Lifta Preservation Joint project on the reconstruction of memory and the preservation of Lifta, archive.org, 14 May 2006.\nLifta photos by Dr Moslih Kanaaneh, jalili48.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, by Rami Nashashibi (1996), Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society.\nLifta, zochrot.org\nReturn to Lifta, 13 May 2006, zochrot.org\nLifta Society website, liftasociety.org\nLifta website, schulen.eduhi.at\n3D models of different houses in Lifta, sketchfab.com; accessed 2 September 2015.",
          "summary": "Lifta (Arabic: لفتا; Hebrew: ליפתא) was a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled by Zionist paramilitary forces during the 1948 Palestine war.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the village was recorded to have a population of 400 Arabs, all Muslim households. In 1834, a battle took place in the village during the Palestinian Peasants' Revolt. A British 1922 census registered Lifta's population at 1,451, all Muslims.\nPrior to 1948, the village had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. In the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians. In addition, a small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian Arab majority as 'excellent'.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine war, a massacre occurred on 28 December 1947, when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on a cafe in Lifa. The mukhtar's home was also incinerated by the Zionist forces and 20 buildings were blown up as the village was put under siege. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled, and the abandoned village was later repopulated by Jewish immigrants until the 1970s. In July 2017, Israel declared Lifta (called Mei Neftoach) as a national nature reserve. It has been referred to as the \"Palestinian Pompeii\".",

          "content": "Lifta (لفتا; ליפתא) était un village palestinien situé aux alentours de Jérusalem, existant jusqu’à la fin de la Palestine mandataire. Ses habitants ont été expulsés par des milices paramilitaires sionistes pendant la guerre de 1948 en Palestine.\nÀ l’époque ottomane, le village avait 400 habitants, tous musulmans. En 1834, une bataille a lieu durant la révolte de Palestine. Lors du recensement britannique de 1922, 1451 habitants sont enregistrés, tous musulmans. Avant 1948, le village avait des vergers, des moulins à huile, un pressoir à vin, une clinique moderne, deux cafés, deux charpentiers, des salons de coiffure, un boucher et une mosquée. Dans les statistiques villageoises de 1945, la population est de 2250, dont 20 chrétiens. Quelques Juifs y habitaient, et un ancien habitant juif décrit les relations entre sa famille et la majorité arabe comme excellentes.\nPendant la guerre de 1948, un massacre a lieu le 28 décembre 1947, quand une milice paramilitaire juive attaque un café à la mitrailleuse et à la grenade. La maison du moukhtar est incendiée par les sionistes et 20 maisons démolies détruites. Les habitants arabes sont expulsés, et le village repeuplé par des immigrants juifs. En juillet 2017, Israël déclare Lifta (Mei Neftoach) réserve naturelle nationale. Le village est surnommé le « Pompéi palestinien ».\n\nGéographie\nLe village est situé sur le versant ouest et nord-ouest d’une colline escarpée dominant l’oued Salman (Wadi Salman). Les rues du village suivaient la courbe de la colline. La route entre Jérusalem et Jaffa passait immédiatement au sud du village ; quelques chemins reliaient Lifta aux villages voisins. L’oued Shami était utilisé pour irriguer les cultures. Lifta se trouvait à seulement à 5 kilomètres à l’ouest de Jérusalem. À la fin de la période du mandat britannique, le village s’agrandit vers le sud-est, les dernières maisons de Lifta rejoignant celles du quartier ouest de Jérusalem, Rumaymah ou Romema (en), ainsi que vers le sud et le sud-ouest, le long de la route Jaffa-Jérusalem. Le territoire de Lifta se trouve au nord et au nord-ouest de Jérusalem. Le village était situé à une altitude d’environ 675 m.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nUne source permanente est vue comme le site primitif du village. Parmi les découvertes archéologiques autour de la source se trouvent une grotte utilisée comme tombeau, des fragments de poterie du bronze moyen II et de l’âge du fer II.\nD’autres restes archéologiques de l’âge du fer II ont été découverts au village.\n\nIdentification biblique\nLe site est considéré par certains comme identique à celui du village biblique de Mei Neftoach (מי נפתוח), peuplé anciennement. Nephtoah (en hébreu ancien נפתח, littéralement la source du détroit) est mentionné dans la bible hébraïque à la frontière entre les tribus israélites de Juda et de Benjamin et qu’il était le point le plus au nord de la tribu de Juda. D’autres universitaires considèrent cette identification comme plausible mais non certaine. Kitchener et Conder jugent cette identification insatisfaisante, et préfèrent identifier Lifta avec Eleph, de la tribu de Benjamin (cité dans le livre de Josué 18:28).\n\nPériodes romaine et byzantine\nLes Romains et les Byzantins l’appellent Nephtho.\n\nCroisades\nAucune information n’est disponible pour la période islamique. À l’époque des Croisades, les Européens appellent le village Clepsta. Les restes d’une cour de maison  de l’époque des Croisades ont été retrouvées au centre du village.\n\nPériode ottomane\nEn 1596, Lifta était un village de la nahié (sous-district) de Jérusalem de la liwa' de Jérusalem, et avait une population de 72 ménages musulmans, soit environ 396 habitants. Tous les revenus fiscaux allaient à une fondation religieuse, ou waqf.\nEn 1834, une bataille a lieu durant la révolte de Palestine. Ibrahim Pacha conduit son armée qui défait les rebelles, menés par le cheikh Kassim al-Ahmad (en), un notable important qui habitait le village. La famille de Kassim al-Ahmad restait puissante et dominait la région au sud-ouest de Naplouse de leurs villages fortifiés de Deir Istiya et Beit Wazan. En 1838, le bibliste Edward Robinson cite Lifta comme village musulman, situé dans la zone Beni Malik, à l’ouest de Jérusalem.\nEn 1863, Victor Guérin décrit Lifta, entouré de jardins de citronniers, orangers, figuiers, grenadiers et abricotiers. Une liste de village ottomane de 1870 indique 117 maisons et 395 hommes.\nLe rapport du fonds d’exploration de la Palestine de 1883 décrit un village sur le côté d’une colline avec, au sud, une source et des tombeaux taillés dans la pierre.\nEn 1896, la population est estimée à 966 habitants.\nEn 1907, l’historien allemand Gustav Rothstein est invité à Lifta par son professeur d’arabe, Elias Nasrallah Haddad. Il écrit un article de 20 pages décrivant les cérémonies de mariage et les fêtes religieuses à Lifta.\n\nPériode du mandat britannique\nEn 1917, Lifta se rend aux forces britanniques en agitant le drapeau blanc et symboliquement, les clés du village.\nDans le recensement de 1922, Lifta a 1451 habitants, tous musulmans augmentant à 1893 au recensement de 1931 (les habitants de Lifta étant alors comptés avec l’orphelinat Schneller (en), ou orphelinat syrien) ; parmi eux, 1844 musulmans, 35 juifs et 14 chrétiens, avec 410 maisons.\nPendant les émeutes de 1929, selon une source israélienne, quelques villageois de Lifta participaient aux bandes qui ont attaqué et pillé les communautés juives des alentours.\nDans les statistiques des villages de 1945, la population de Lifta était de 2250 habitants, dont 2230 musulmans et 20 chrétiens ; la superficie totale était de 8743 dunams, dont 3248 dunams consacrés aux céréales et 324 construits.\nAvant 1948, le village, avec environ 2500 habitants, avait des vergers, des moulins à huile, un pressoir à vin, une clinique moderne, deux cafés, deux charpentiers, des salons de coiffure, un boucher et une mosquée. Quelques Juifs habitaient dans le village, et un ancien habitant juif a décrit la relation de sa famille avec la majorité arabe comme « excellente ». La partie arabe de la population possédait 89 % des terres, les Juifs environ 8 %, le restant étant des terres publiques.\nL’économie du village dépendait fortement des liens avec Jérusalem, dont le marché absorbait les produits agricoles des paysans de Lifta, qui profitaient des services de la ville. Dans les années 1940, la prospérité du village s’est beaucoup accrue, permettant d’améliorer le réseau routier. Deux cafés et un club étaient le centre de la vie sociale à Lifta, attirant même des clients de Jérusalem. Deux écoles se trouvaient au village, une pour les filles et une pour les garçons, l’école de filles ayant été financée collectivement par plusieurs villages.\n\nGuerre de 1948 et expulsion\nDans la guerre civile de 1947-1948 Lifta, Romema et Shaykh Badr, situés stratégiquement sur la route de Jérusalem à Tel-Aviv, étaient prioritaires dans les opérations des forces juives. L’histoire officielle de la Haganah indique simplement que les habitants de Lifta ont « libéré » le village [aux Israéliens]. Selon Benny Morris, quelques familles avaient quitté le village après que la décision ait été prise, un peu avant le 4 décembre, d’évacuer les femmes et les enfants afin d’accueillir un compagnie de militaires. Selon Ilan Pappé, le premier accrochage se situe en décembre, quand le propriétaire d’une station-service de Romema, mais vivant à Lifta, est tué par la Haganah, sous le prétexte (fallacieux) qu’il incitait les Arabes à caillasser les véhicules des Juifs qui traversaient le village. En réplique à cet assassinat, les habitants de Lifta se mettent effectivement à jeter des pierres sur les véhicules des Juifs. Selon Morris, les premiers accrochages remontent à mi-décembre, quand une milice paramilitaire arabe prend des positions pour défendre Lifta. Les patrouilles de la Haganah échangeaient quelques coups de feu avec ces miliciens, alors que l’Irgoun et le Lehi étaient bien plus agressifs. Le 28 décembre 1947, le village subit un massacre. La Haganah lança une attaque à la grenade et à la mitrailleuse sur le café de Salah Eisa. Afin de faire comprendre aux habitants qu’ils devaient quitter leur  village, la maison du moukhtar est incendiée, et 20 bâtiments détruits. L’attaque fait sept morts (six selon d’autres sources) ; de nombreuses femmes et enfants quittent le village. Le même jour, les terroristes du Lehi attaque de son propre chef un bus arabe et tirent dedans, afin de « punir les villages arabes ». Après fin décembre, une grande partie des villageois prennent la fuite. Une autre opération de la Haganah a lieu le 11 janvier, afin d’accélérer la fuite des villageois et sur les villages voisins. Lifta subit ensuite des pénuries alimentaires, début janvier 1948. Un certain nombre de villageois retournèrent chez eux. En conséquence, lors de sa visite du village, Abd al-Kader al-Husseini ordonne que les femmes, les enfants et les vieillards quittent le village, les hommes devant rester. Le 29 janvier, le Lehi détruit 3 maisons du village. Début février, le village est abandonné par la milice. Selon Benny Morris, c’est un assaut qui est la cause de la dépopulation du village. Selon Palestine Remembered, les derniers habitants à quitter le village ont été transportés par camion à Jérusalem-Est. Le 7 février, lors de son voyage à Jérusalem, David Ben Gourion visite Lifta, et exprime sa satisfaction le soir même devant le conseil du Mapaï : « Quand vous arrivez à Jérusalem par Lifta-Romema, Mahane Yehuda, King Georges Street (en) et Méa Shéarim, il n’y a pas d’étrangers [d’Arabes]. 100 % de Juifs ».\nSelon un entretien mené avec un habitant en 2021, il y a environ 40 000 réfugiés palestiniens descendant de ces Arabes chassés de leurs maisons, répartis à Jérusalem-Est, la Cisjordanie, la Jordanie et la diaspora palestinienne. Plusieurs familles conservent leurs actes de propriété de l’acte ottomane, attestant de leur droits de propriété à Lifta.\n\nPériode israélienne\nLifta a été utilisé pour abriter des réfugiés juifs pendant la guerre, et après la guerre l’agence juive et Israël ont installé des immigrants juifs du Yémen et du Kurdistan, 300 familles au total. La propriété des maisons n’était pas enregistré à leur nom. Les conditions de vie étaient difficiles : mauvais état des maisons, les routes et les moyens de transports étaient défaillants, et il n’y avait ni électricité, ni eau courante, ni installations d’épuration. En 1969-71, la plupart des Juifs du village choissisent de partir dans le cadre d’un programme de compensation d’Amidar, l’agence immobilière nationale. Des trous ont été percés dans les toits des maisons abandonnées pour les rendre inhabitables, et éviter ainsi le retour des réfugiés, qualifiés de squatteurs. Treize familles, vivant dans la partie du village proche de l’autoroute 1 et n’ayant pas de problèmes de transport, ont choisi de rester. Des hippies et des sans-abris ont vécu à Lifta un certain temps.\nLes colonies juives de Mey Niftoach et Givat Shaul sont implantées sur les terres de Lifta.\nDans les années 1980, Lifta est classé réserve naturelle municipale, sous l’égide de la direction de la Nature et des Parcs.\nEn 1984, un des bâtiments abandonnés est occupé par la bande de Lifta, un groupe de Juifs complotant la destruction des mosquées de l’esplanade des Mosquées à Jérusalem, qui ont été arrêtés à l’entrée du site avec 120 kilos d’explosif, des grenades à main et d’autres armes\nAprès le départ des habitants juifs, plusieurs bâtiments du village ont été utilisés pour le centre de désintoxication pour adolescents de Lifta, fermé en 2014 et par l’école supérieure de Lifta depuis 1971, une école à éducation ouverte, réinstallée dans la colonie allemande de Jérusalem (en) en 2001.\nEn 2011, un projet de démolition du village pour le remplacer par un ensemble de 212 logements de luxe et un hôtel est présenté. Les anciens habitants ont fait une demande légale pour préserver le village comme site historique. Lifta était le dernier village arabe vidé de ses habitants à n’avoir ni été complètement détruit ni réoccupé. En 2012, ce projet est rejeté par le tribunal de district de Jérusalem.\nEn 2011, trois livres sur l'histoire du village palestinien avaient été publiés.\nEn juin 2017, les derniers habitants juifs quittent le village après un accord avec le gouvernement qui reconnait qu’ils ne sont pas des squatteurs, mais qu’ils avaient été installés là par les autorités compétentes. En juillet 2017, Mei Neftoach est déclaré réserve naturelle nationale, 55 des 450 maisons d’avant 1948 étant encore debout.\nEn 2021, l’autorité foncière d'Israël, sans en informer la municipalité de Jérusalem, announce lors de la journée de Jérusalem un appel d’offres pour un nouveau projet de quartier de luxe sur les ruines du village, avec 259 villas, un hôtel et un centre commercial. Le 11 août 2022, ce plan est abandonné, le nouveau maire de Jérusalem, Moshe Lion, cherchant à préserver le village et à le faire accéder au rang de patrimoine mondial. L’ancien maire, Nir Barkat, également homme d’affaires, avait approuvé le plan de démolition avant de changer d’avis après une visite du site.\n\nCulture\nUn sanctuaire consacré au sage cheikha Badr se trouvait au village.\n\nPatrimoine mondial\nAprès l’expulsion des villageois palestiniens, il restait 60 maison de pierre sur les 410 du village, certaines à trois étages, avec la mosquée, un moulin à huile et un sentier empierré vers la source. Le village a été placé comme potentiel élément du patrimoine mondial par l’Unesco, classement validé en 2018 comme site en danger.\n\nRobes traditionnelles\nLifta était l’une des communautés les plus prospères autour de Jérusalem, et les femmes de Lifta étaient connues pour leurs broderies[Quand ?]. Les robes de mariées Thob Ghabani étaient cousues à Lifta. Elles étaient taillées dans du ghabani, un coton naturel couvert de broderiess de soie de couleur dorée produites à Alep, et étaient plus reserrées que les autres robes. Les manches étaient aussi plus étroites. Les flancs, les manches et le bustier étaient aussi ornés d’empiècements de soie. Les robes étaient fabriquées à Bethléem. Les femmes mariées de Lifta portaient un shaṭweh, coiffe conique distinctive, également portée à Bethléem, Ein Kerem, Beit Jala et Beit Sahour[Quand ?]\n\nPersonnalités liées à Lifta\nRasmea Odeh\nYahya Hammouda\n\nActuellement\nOutre les maisons conservées du village, des figuiers et des amandiers des vergers de Lifta subsistent le long du cours d’eau issu de la source. La mosquée et le club du village sont encore debout ; le cimetière est recouvert de buissons.\n\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nBibliographie générale\nJames Turner Barclay, The city of Great King; or, Jerusalem as it was, Philadelphia, J.

          "content": "Ein Karem (Hebrew: עין כרם, romanized: ʿEin Kārem; Arabic: عين كارم, romanized: ʿAyn Kārim) also Ein Kerem or Ain Karem, is a historic mountain village southwest of Jerusalem, presently a neighborhood in the outskirts of the modern city, within the Jerusalem District in Israel. It is the site of the Hadassah Medical Center.\nEin Karem was an important Jewish village during the late Second Temple period, during which it became important to Christianity. Christian tradition holds that John the Baptist was born in Ein Karem, following the biblical verse in Luke saying John's family lived in a \"town in the hill country of Judea\". Probably because of its location between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, this location was a very comfortable one for a pilgrimage, and this led to the establishment of many churches and monasteries in the area.\nDuring the years of Ottoman and later British Mandate, Ein Karem was a Palestinian Arab village. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After the war it became once again a Jewish settlement. Today, Ein Karem is a vibrant bohemian neighborhood of Jerusalem, with a population of 2,000 (2010).\nIt has retained a very high-level of authenticity, its natural environment remains intact, and its old houses are still inhabited and preserved. It attracts three million visitors a year, one-third of them pilgrims from around the world. Alongside its religious landmarks, Ein Karem is also known for its fine art, culinary, and musical scenes.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Ein Karem or Ein Kerem can be literally translated from both Hebrew and Arabic as \"Spring of the Vineyard\". It is derived from the springs and vineyards established on the village's terraced slopes.\nAnother possible translation would be \"Spring of Carem\", if derived from an ancient Iron Age Israelite city called Carem, mentioned as a city in the dominion of the tribe of Judah in the Septuagint version of Book of Joshua. In Arabic, other than meaning \"Spring of the Vineyard\", it could be understood as well as \"the Generous Spring\".\n\nHistory\nA spring that provides water to the village of Ein Karem stimulated settlement there from an early time.\n\nBronze Age\nPottery has been found near the spring dating to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nIron Age/Israelite period\nDuring the Iron Age, or Israelite period, Ein Karem is usually identified as the location of the biblical village of Beth HaKerem (Jeremiah 6:1; Nehemiah 3:14).\n\nSecond Temple period\nA well-preserved mikveh (Jewish ritual bath) indicates there was a Jewish settlement in the Second Temple period along with some other discoveries such as handful of graves, bits of a wall, and an olive press. A reservoir here was mentioned in the Copper Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nDuring excavations in the Church of Saint John the Baptist, a marble statue of Aphrodite (or Venus) was found, broken in two. It is believed to date from the Roman era and was probably toppled in Byzantine times. Today, the statue is at the Rockefeller Museum. Excavations in front of the same church, which has at its core the cave which Christian tradition identifies as the birthplace of John the Baptist, have unearthed remains of two Byzantine chapels, one containing an inscription mentioning Christian \"martyrs\", but without any mention of John. Ceramics from the Byzantine period have also been found in Ein Karem.\nIn the Byzantine period, as part of the establishment of the “Liturgy of Jerusalem\", Ein Karem was identified with the \"Visitation\", an event mentioned in the New Testament where Mary, expecting Jesus, encountered her cousin Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist. Byzantine sources link Ein Karem with the residence of Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, a place not specified in the New Testament. In around 530 CE, the Christian pilgrim Theodosius places Elizabeth's town at a distance of five miles (8.0 km) from Jerusalem, which suits Ein Karem.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nEin Karem was recorded after the Islamic conquest. Al-Tamimi, the physician (d. 990),  refers to a church in Ein Karem that was venerated by Christians, and notes a particular plant he collected there.\n\nCrusader period\nIt is mentioned under the name St. Jehan de Bois, \"Saint John in the Mountains\", during the Crusades. The Crusaders were the first to build here a church dedicated to St John, rebuilt in the 17th century by the Franciscans and still active today, and Moshe Sharon considers it as \"almost sure\" that the Crusaders are the ones who started the tradition of identifying that particular site as St John's birthplace.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nAfter conquering Jerusalem in 1187, Saladin granted the village of Ein Karem to Abu Maydan, a renowned Sufi teacher from Seville, Andalusia. Abu Madyan had fought in the 1187 Battle of Hattin against the Crusaders before returning to the Maghreb, where he eventually died in Tlemcen, in what is today Algeria. A document, drafted in Jerusalem in 1320 (720 AH) by Abu Maydan's great-grandson, outlines the waqf's holdings, beginning with Ein Karem:\"A village known by the name of Ein Karem, one of the villages adjacent to Jerusalem. This village includes farmed and fallow lands, both cultivated and abandoned, slopes and plains, unproductive bare rock, buildings in ruins, farmhouses, buildings in good repair with their surrounding fields, a little garden, pomegranate trees and other kinds irrigated with water from springs on the property, olive trees of a “rumi” or western variety, carob trees, fig trees, sessile oaks, qiqebs (hardwoods). This village is bounded on all sides: to the south by the great Maliha (salt pan); to the north by properties belonging to Ein-Kaout, Qalunya, Harash, Sataf, and Zawiya el-Bakhtyari; to the west by Ein Esheshqqaq, and to the east by properties belonging to the Maliha and to Beit Mazmil. This village is established as a waqf, with all attendant rights, appurtenances, fields, cultivated lands, threshing floors, loamy earth, with freshwater springs on location, prairies, planted trees, disused wells, vineyards, in a word, with all rights relating thereto, both within and without. However, the mosque, house of God, the path and the cemetery intended for use by Muslims, are not included in the present waqf.\"The Waqf Abu Maydan endowment, which included the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem, has been supported by agricultural and property revenues from the village of Ein Karem until the 1948 war.\nA coin from the reign of As-Salih Hajji (1389 CE) was found here, together with pottery, glassware and other coins from the Mamluk era.\n\nOttoman period\nMost of the village – some 15,000 dunams – was waqf land set aside charitably to benefit the Moroccan Muslim community in Jerusalem, belonging to the endowment established by Abu Madyan in the 14th century.\nIn 1517, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine and in the 1596 tax-records it appeared as 'Ain Karim, located in the Nahiya of Jabal Quds of the Liwa of Al-Quds. The village had at this time 29 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, which included wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, grape syrup/molasse, goats and beehives in addition to \"occasional revenues\"; a total of 5,300 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn the course 17th century, the Franciscans manage to recover the ruins of the church raised by the Crusaders over the traditional birth cave of St. John and, in spite of local Muslim opposition, to rebuild and fortify it as the Monastery of St. John in the Mountains.\nIsraeli geographer Yehoshua Ben-Arieh described Ein Karem as \"the most important village west of Jerusalem\" in the 19th century.\nJames Silk Buckingham visited in the early 1800s, and found he was \"more pleased with this village [...] than with any other place I had yet visited in Palestine.\"\nIn 1838, Ain Karim was noted as a Muslim and Latin Christian village in the Beni Hasan district.\nIn 1863 Victor Guérin noted a thousand inhabitants \"of whom there are barely two hundred and fifty who are Catholics; the others are Muslim.\" The ancestors of the latter were held to descend from Maghrabins, that is to say, originating from the Maghreb (North Africa). Guérin describes them as rowdy and fanatical, until a few years before his visit having very often attacked the Catholic monks at the Monastery of St John in order to extort from them food and money, a habit that had subsided only lately.\nAn official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Ain Karim had 178 houses and a population of 533, though the population count included only men. The population consisted of 412 Muslims in 138 houses, 66 Latin Christians in 18 houses, and 55 Greek Christians in 12 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Ain Karim as: \"A flourishing village of about 600 inhabitants, 100 being Latin Christians. It stands on a sort of natural terrace projecting from the higher hills on the east of it, with a broad flat valley below on the west. On the south below the village is a fine spring ('Ain Sitti Miriam), with a vaulted place for prayer over it. The water issues from a spout into a trough.\"\nIn 1896 the population of 'Ain Karim was estimated to be about 1,290 persons.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, the population of 'Ain Karim was 1,735; consisting of 1,282 Muslims and 453 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,637, in 555 houses.\nDuring the 1929 riots in Palestine, Arab residents of 'Ain Karim launched raids against the nearby Jewish neighborhood of Bayit VeGan.\nIn the 1945 statistics, Ein Karim had a population of 3,180; 2,510 Muslims and 670 Christians, The total land area was 15,029 dunams, of this, a total of 7,960 dunums of land were irrigated or used for plantations, 1,199 were used for cereals; while a total of 1,704 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) areas.\nThe 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine placed 'Ayn Karim in the Jerusalem enclave intended for international control.\n\n1948 Arab–Israeli War\nWhen the 1947–1949 Palestine war started, 'Ain Karim became a major base of operations against nearby Jewish neighborhoods. In February 1948, the village's 300 guerilla fighters were reinforced by a well-armed Arab Liberation Army force of mainly Syrian fighters, and on March 10 a substantial Iraqi detachment arrived in the village. This was followed within days by some 160 Egyptian fighters. On March 19, the villagers joined their foreign guests in attacking a Jewish convoy on the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem road. Immediately after the April 1948 massacre at the nearby village of Deir Yassin (1.2 miles (2 km) to the north), most of the women and children in the village were evacuated.\nThe village was finally captured by Israeli forces during the ten-day campaign of July 1948. The remaining residents fled on July 10–11. The Arab Liberation Army forces which had camped in the village left on July 14–16 after Jewish forces captured two dominating hilltops, Khirbet Beit Mazmil and Khirbet al-Hamama, and shelled the village. During its last days, 'Ayn Karim suffered from severe food shortages.\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the war ended, Israel incorporated the village into the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem. Ein Karem was one of the few depopulated localities which survived the war with most of the buildings intact. The abandoned homes were resettled with inmigrants, many of whom Mizrahi Jews who fled from the Arab countries who fought the Arab-Israeli War during the war and after it, i.e. Jews from Iraq and Egypt but also from Yemen. Over the years, the bucolic atmosphere attracted a population of artisans and craftsmen. Today it is a vibrant bohemian neighborhood of Jerusalem, attracting many artist, young people and tourists.\nIn 1961, Hadassah built its medical center on a nearby hilltop, including the Hadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, and pharmacology.\n\nBiblical connections\nOld Testament\nOnly the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible, the base for the Christian Old Testament, names a place in the hills of Judah as \"Carem\" (Joshua 15:30).\n\nNew Testament\nAccording to the New Testament, Mary went \"into the hill country, to a city of Judah\" (Luke 1:39) when she visited her cousin Elizabeth, the wife of Zechariah.\nDuring the Byzantine period, Theodosius (530 CE) gives the distance between Jerusalem and the town of Elizabeth as five miles (8.0 km).\nThe Jerusalem Calendar (Kalendarium Hyerosolimitanum) or the Georgian Festival Calendar, dated by some before 638, the year of the Muslim conquest, mentions the village by name, \"Enqarim,\" as the place of a festival in memory of Elizabeth celebrated on the twenty-eighth of August.\nThe English writer Saewulf, on pilgrimage to Palestine in 1102–1103, wrote of a monastery in the area of Ein Karim dedicated to St. Sabas, where 300 monks had been \"slain by Saracens\", but without mentioning any tradition connected to St. John.\n\nLandmarks\nChurch of the Visitation\nThe Church of the Visitation, or Abbey Church of St John in the Woods, is located across the village to the southwest from St. John's. The ancient sanctuary there was built against a rock declivity. It is venerated as the pietra del nascondimento, the \"stone in which John was concealed,\" in reference to the Protevangelium of James. The site is also attributed to John the Baptist's parental summer house, where Mary visited them. The modern church was built in 1955, also on top of ancient church remnants. It was designed by Antonio Barluzzi, an Italian architect, who designed many other churches in the Holy Land during the 20th century.\n\nMonastery of St. John in the Mountains\nThe Monastery of St. John Ba-Harim (lit. 'in the Mountains'), is centered on a church containing the cave identified by tradition as the birthplace of Saint John the Baptist. The church is built over the remnants of a Crusader church and its porch stands over the remains of two Byzantine chapels, both containing mosaic floors. The current structure received its outlook as the result of the latest large architectural intervention, finished in 1939 under the guidance of the Italian architect, Antonio Barluzzi.\nIn 1941–1942 the Franciscans excavated the area west of the church and monastery. The southernmost of the rock-cut chambers they found can probably be dated to the first century CE. Some remnants below the southern part of the porch suggests the presence of a mikve (Jewish ritual bath) that is dated to the Second Temple Period.\nThe church is mentioned in the Book of the Demonstration, attributed to Eutychius of Alexandria (940): \"The church of Bayt Zakariya in the district of Aelia bears witness to the visit of Mary to her kinswoman Elizabeth.\"\nThe site of the Crusader church built above the traditional birth cave of St John, destroyed after the departure of the Crusaders, was purchased by Franciscan custos, Father Thomas of Novara in 1621. After a decades-long struggle with the Muslim inhabitants, the Franciscans finally managed to rebuild and fortify their church and monastery by the 1690s.\n\nConvent of the Sisters of Zion\nThe monastery of Les Sœurs de Notre-Dame de Sion (Sisters of Our Lady of Zion), built in 1860, was founded by two brothers from France, Marie-Théodore Ratisbonne and Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, who were born Jewish and converted to Christianity.\nThey established an orphanage here. Alphonse himself lived in the monastery and is buried in its garden.\n\nGorny or \"Moscobia\" Convent\nThe convent was established by the Jerusalem mission of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1871. The name \"Gorny Convent\" refers to the visit of the Virgin Mary to her cousin St. Elizabeth \"into the hill country, to a town in Judah\", gorny meaning mountainous in Russian. It was nicknamed \"Muskobiya\" (Arabic for Muscovite) by the local Arab villagers, which mutated in Hebrew to \"Moskovia\".\nApart from the structures serving the nunnery and a pilgrims hostel, it now contains three churches, enclosed within a compound wall. The Church of Our Lady of Kazan (Kazanskaya) is dedicated to the holy icon of Our Lady of Kazan and is the oldest among the three churches, being consecrated in 1873. The Cathedral of All Russian Saints, with its gilded domes, was started before the Russian Revolution and could only be completed in 2007. The cave church of St. John the Baptist was consecrated in 1987.\n\nMary's Spring\nAccording to a Christian tradition which started in the 14th century, the Virgin Mary drank water from this village spring, and here is also the place where Mary and Elizabeth met. Therefore, since the 14th century the spring is known as the Fountain of the Virgin. The spring waters are considered holy by some Catholic and Orthodox Christian pilgrims who visit the site and fill their bottles. What looks like a spring is actually the end of an ancient aqueduct.\nThe former Arab inhabitants built a mosque and school on the site, of which a maqam and minaret still remain. An inscribed panel to the courtyard of the mosque dates it to 1828–1829 CE (AH 1244). The spring was repaired and renovated by Baron Edmond de Rothschild.\n\nMonastery of St. John in the Wilderness\nThe Monastery of St. John in the Wilderness, containing a cave associated with the saint, is located close to Ein Karem and Even Sapir.\n\nSt. Vincent\nSt. Vincent-Ein Kerem is a home for physically or mentally handicapped children.

          "content": "Ein Kerem (en hébreu: עין כרם, en arabe: عين كارم - ‘Ein Kārem) est un ancien village d'artisans du district de Jérusalem en Israël, devenu zone résidentielle incluse dans les limites municipales de Jérusalem. Le toponyme Ein Kerem signifie en hébreu source de la vigne. Sa population était de deux mille habitants en 2010. Il est selon la tradition biblique le lieu de la Visitation de la Vierge Marie et celui de la naissance de Jean le Baptiste, raison pour laquelle il attire environ trois millions de visiteurs et de pèlerins par an.\n\nHistoire\nLes fouilles archéologiques y ont révélé une occupation dès l'âge du bronze, d'après les poteries que l'on y a découvertes .\nLa tradition juive fait provenir de la vallée d'Ein Kerem les pierres ayant servi à la construction de l'autel du Temple de Jérusalem (Mishna, traité Middot 3:4).\nUne statue d'Aphrodite en marbre a été découverte pendant des fouilles pratiquées à la fin du XIXe siècle, et se trouve aujourd'hui au musée Rockfeller.\nSelon la tradition chrétienne, c'est l'emplacement où a eu lieu la Visitation de Marie de Nazareth à sa cousine Élisabeth, et où saint Jean Baptiste est né. Ainsi le village est devenu un lieu de pèlerinage pour l'Église catholique romaine et pour différentes confessions chrétiennes. À l'époque byzantine, c'était une station de la liturgie de Jérusalem. Les croisés nomment l'endroit Saint-Jehan-des-Bois.\nDans les années 1950, Rachel Yannayit Ben-Zvi y fonde un village agricole destiné à former les jeunes au travail de la terre. Le village devient ensuite l'école d'agriculture d'Ein Kerem, qui est par la suite transférée dans le village de Bet Zayit, sur les pentes d'Ein Kerem.\nDans les années 1960, le centre médical Hadassah y est construit. Il comprend l'hôpital Hadassah d'Ein Kerem, la faculté de médecine de l'université hébraïque de Jérusalem et d'autres écoles de médecine.\nEn 1986, un enfant de treize d'ans tue ses deux sœurs et ses parents pour des raisons inconnues. Ce fait divers est raconté dans une mini série sur Netflix sous le nom original de The Motive, ou \"le mobile\".\n\nTradition chrétienne\nSelon le Nouveau Testament, Marie se rend dans une ville de Judée située dans les collines pour rendre visite à Zacharie et à sa cousine Élisabeth. \nEn l'an 530, l'empereur romain d'Orient Théodose indique que la distance entre Jérusalem et le lieu où vivait Élisabeth, mère de saint Jean-Baptiste, est de cinq lieues. Les lieux de station de la liturgie de Jérusalem (avant 638) mentionnent que le village célèbre tous les 28 août une fête en l'honneur d'Élisabeth. Eutychius d'Alexandrie la cite encore en 940 comme le village et l'église du lieu de la Visitation. En 1102-1103, le pèlerin anglo-saxon Saewulf note que le village possède un grand monastère dédié à saint Sabas, et que trois-cents de ses moines ont été massacrés par les Sarrasins.\nLes croisés font édifier une église qui est trouvée en ruines à l'époque ottomane. Le père franciscain Thomas de Novare parvient à racheter le terrain. En 1672, les franciscains de la custodie de Terre Sainte obtiennent enfin un firman leur donnant l'autorisation de relever les ruines et de construire une nouvelle église Saint-Jean-Baptiste. Leur couvent est encore agrandi en 1693.

          "content": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\n\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as Hierapolis. However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to Hierolophos.\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh. The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש). The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only—Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies—United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now closed. There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 °C (75.6 °F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\n\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine. In 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 Time magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\n\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\n\nUrban structure\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafés and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nTransportation\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\n\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (Jibal al-Quds), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division. The club has won Israel's championship in 2015, the State Cup four times, and the ULEB Cup in 2004.\nThe Jerusalem Marathon, established in 2011, is an international marathon race held annually in Jerusalem in the month of March. The full 42-kilometre race begins at the Knesset, passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City's Armenian Quarter, and concludes at Sacher Park. In 2012, the Jerusalem Marathon drew 15,000 runners, including 1,500 from fifty countries outside Israel.\nA popular non-competitive sports event is the Jerusalem March, held annually during the Sukkot festival.\n\nTwin towns—sister cities\nJerusalem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGreater Jerusalem\nList of people from Jerusalem\nList of places in Jerusalem\nList of songs about Jerusalem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website of the Jerusalem Municipality\nWhat makes Jerusalem so holy?

          "summary": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.",

          "content": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.\n\nالتسمية\nأوّل اسم ثابت لمدينة القدس هو «أورسالم» الذي يظهر في رسائل تل العمارنة المصرية، ويعني أسس سالم؛ وسالم أو شالم هو اسم الإله الكنعاني حامي المدينة، وقيل مدينة السلام. وقد ظهرت هذه التسمية مرتين في الوثائق المصرية القديمة: حوالي سنة 2000 ق.م و1330 ق.م، ثم ما لبثت تلك المدينة، وفقًا لسفر الملوك الثاني، أن أخذت اسم «يبوس» نسبة إلى اليبوسيين، المتفرعين من الكنعانيين، وقد بنوا قلعتها والتي تعني بالكنعانية مرتفع. تذكر مصادر تاريخية عن الملك اليبوسي «ملكي صادق» أنه هو أول من بنى يبوس أو القدس، وكان محبًا للسلام، حتى أُطلق عليه «ملك السلام» ومن هنا جاء اسم المدينة وقد قيل أنه هو من سماها بأورسالم أي «مدينة سالم».\nظهر الاسم «أورشليم» أوّل ما ظهر في الكتاب المقدس، وفي سفر يشوع تحديدًا، ويقول الخبراء اللغويون أنه نحت، أي دمج، لكلمتيّ أور، التي تعني «موقع مخصص لعبادة الله وخدمته»، والجذر اللغوي س ل م، الذي يعني على ما يُعتقد «سلام»، أو يشير إلى إله كنعاني قديم اسمه «شاليم»، وهو إله الغسق. أطلق العبرانيون على أقدم الأقسام المأهولة من المدينة اسميّ «مدينة داود» و«صهيون»، وقد أصبحت هذه الأسماء ألقاب ونعوت للمدينة ككل فيما بعد بحسب التقليد اليهودي. حُرّف اسم القدس من قبل الإغريق خلال العصر الهيليني، فأصبح يُلفظ «هيروسليما» (باليونانية: Ἱεροσόλυμα)، وعند سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية على حوض البحر المتوسط، أطلق الرومان على المدينة تسمية «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» (باللاتينية: Colonia Aelia Capitolina) سنة 131 للميلاد. في بعض الرسائل الإسلامية باللغة العربية من القرون الوسطى، وخصوصًا في العهدة العمرية، تذكر المدينة باسم «إيلياء» أو «إيليا» وهو على ما يبدو اختصار لاسمها اللاتيني. ذُكرت المدينة في فترة لاحقة من القرون الوسطى باسم «بيت المقدس»، وهو مأخوذ من الآرامية בית מקדשא بمعنى «الكنيس». ولا يزال هذا الاسم يُستخدم في بعض اللغات مثل اللغة الأردية، وهو مصدر لقب «مقدسي» الذي يطلق على سكان المدينة.\nأما اسم القدس الشائع اليوم في العربية وخاصة لدى المسلمين فقد يكون اختصارًا لاسم «بيت المقدس» أو لعبارة «مدينة القدس» وكثيرًا ما يُقال «القدس الشريف» لتأكيد قدسية المدينة. أما السلطات الإسرائيلية فتشير في إعلاناتها إلى المدينة باسم «أورشليم القدس».\n\nتاريخ القدس\nنظرة شاملة\nتلعب القدس دورًا أساسيًا عند الحديث عن القومية العربية عمومًا والوطنية الفلسطينية خصوصًا، وكذلك بالنسبة للقومية الإسرائيلية أو الصهيونية، لذا فإن الحديث عن تاريخها الطويل، الذي يمتد لأكثر من 5,000 سنة، غالبًا ما يأخذ منحى متحيزًا من الناحية الأيديولوجية. فعلى سبيل المثال، يُركز القوميون الإسرائيليون على الحقبة التاريخية التي استوطن فيها بنو إسرائيل أرض فلسطين ويزعمون بأن جميع يهود العالم اليوم ينحدرون من أولئك القوم إلى جانب المكابيين، مما يدعم قضيتهم الهادفة إلى توطين يهود العالم في فلسطين ويعزز من موقفهم أمام الشعوب المختلفة، حيث يُظهرون أنهم الورثة الشرعيين للمدينة والبلاد ككل. ومن ناحية أخرى، يُركز القوميون العرب والفلسطينيين على الحقبتين المسيحية والإسلامية وغيرها من الحقبات غير الإسرائيلية في تاريخ المدينة، مما يدعم قضيتهم التي تقول بأن الفلسطينيين الحاليين هم ورثة المدينة والبلاد بما أنهم ينحدرون من جميع الشعوب والأمم التي سكنت القدس وفلسطين عبر العصور وتزاوجت واختلطت. وكنتيجة لهذا التباين، يزعم كل من الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين أن الطرف الآخر يُحرّف التاريخ لتحقيق مصالحه الخاصة والقضاء على مصالح الآخر، ولتأييد ادعائه بأحقيته بالمدينة، وبطبيعة الحال فإن كل طرف وجد المؤيدين لرأيه، وأغلبهم من ذات القومية، والمعارضين، وأغلبهم من القومية الأخرى.\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nأظهرت بعض التنقيبات الأثرية وجود بعض الأواني الخزفية في مدينة داود، الواقعة ضمن حدود القدس حاليًا، والتي تعود لحوالي الألفية الرابعة قبل الميلاد، أي منذ العصر النحاسي، وأظهرت اكتشافات أخرى وجود مستعمرة بشرية قامت خلال أوائل العصر البرونزي (ما بين عاميّ 3000 و2800 ق.م تقريبًا)، ويقول بعض المؤرخين أن من أسسها هم الكنعانيون الذين سكنوا فلسطين في الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وخلال هذه الفترة قدم إليها العرب الساميون في هجرتين كبيرتين: الأولى في بداية الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، والثانية في بداية الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، بينما يقول آخرون، مثل عالمة الآثار البريطانية كاتلين كينيون، أن القدس تأسست على يد قوم ساميين شماليين غربيين حوالي سنة 2600 قبل الميلاد. ورد أول ذكر لتجمع سكاني في موقع القدس في رسائل اللعنة الفرعونية من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد، ويُذكر موقع القدس فيها باسم أشمام كأحد تجمعات العدو الذي يجب لعنه كي لا يضر بالجيوش المصرية.\nتنص التوراة على أن المدينة تأسست على يد سام بن نوح، وعابر حفيد سام، من أسلاف النبي إبراهيم (وهو أبو الأنبياء جميعا وجدهم)، وسكنها في ذلك الوقت شعب يُعرف بشعب اليبوسيين، فسُميت المدينة «يبوس» تيمنًا بسكانها. ازدهرت المدينة في عهد ملكي صادق، وهو أحد ملوك اليبوسيين خلال فترة بعثة إبراهيم، واستمر الوضع كما هو إلى حين عهد يشوع، عندما دخلت المدينة في نطاق الأراضي الخاضعة لبني بنيامين، يشوع 28/18] إلا أنها استمرت مأهولة باليبوسيين بعد أن لم يتمكن بنو بنيامين من طردهم. سيطر الملك والنبي داود على المدينة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، بعد أن احتلها من اليبوسيين، وجعل منها عاصمة لمملكته. أظهرت أعمال التنقيب مؤخرًا وجود أساسات حجرية ضخمة في وسط القدس، قال الإسرائيليون بأنها بقايا هيكل داود، وقد توقفت أعمال التنقيب بعد أن صرّح الخبراء باعتقادهم هذا، إلى حين أن يتم التصديق على هذا الأمر من قبل مفسري التوراة.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nتنص المخطوطات العبرانية على أن النبي داود دام حكمه لمملكة إسرائيل 40 عامًا، وبالتحديد حتى سنة 970 ق.م، وبعد وفاته خلفه ولده سليمان الذي حكم طيلة 33 عامًا، وفي عهده تمّ تشييد هيكل المدينة على جبل موريا، بالإضافة إلى هيكل سليمان الشهير، الذي يلعب دورًا مهمًا عند اليهود، كونه يمثل المستودع الذي حُفظ فيه تابوت العهد وفقًا للمعتقد اليهودي. أصبحت القدس تُسمى بالمدينة المقدسة في عام 975 ق.م، وشكّلت عاصمة لمملكة إسرائيل الموحدة، وبعد وفاة سليمان انقسمت المملكة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي وذلك بعد تمرد الأسباط العبرية الشمالية بسبط يهوذا الجنوبي الذي كان آل داود ينتمون إليه. سُمي القسم الجنوبي بمملكة يهوذا في الجنوب، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة لها تحت قيادة رحبعام بن سليمان. وفي سنة 587 ق.م، احتل الملك البابلي «نبوخذ نصّر الثاني» مدينة القدس بعد أن هزم آخر ملوك اليهود «صدقيا بن يوشيا»، ونقل من بقي فيها من اليهود أسرى إلى بابل بمن فيهم الملك صدقيا نفسه، وعاث في المدينة دمارًا وخرابًا وأقدم على تدمير هيكل سليمان، مما أنهى الفترة التي يُطلق عليها المؤرخون تسمية «عهد الهيكل الأول».\n\nبعد 50 سنة من السبي إلى بابل، سمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن أراد من أسرى اليهود في بابل بالعودة إلى القدس وإعادة بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود إلى القدس وشرعوا ببناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنة 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الأول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه. وحوالي سنة 445 ق.م، أصدر الملك الفارسي «أرتحشستا الأول» مرسومًا سمح فيه لسكان المدينة بإعادة بناء أسوارها، واستمرت المدينة عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا طيلة العقود التي تلت. فقدت الإمبراطورية الفارسية فلسطين بما فيها القدس لصالح القائد والملك المقدوني، الإسكندر الأكبر، عام 333 ق.م، وبعد وفاته استمر خلفاؤه المقدونيون البطالمة في حكم المدينة، واستولى عليها في العام نفسه بطليموس الأول وضمها مع فلسطين إلى مملكته في مصر عام 323 ق.م. ثم في عام 198 ق.م، خسر بطليموس الخامس القدس ومملكة يهوذا لصالح السلوقيين في سوريا، بقيادة أنطيوخوس الثالث الكبير. حاول الإغريق أن يطبعوا المدينة بطابعهم الخاص ويجعلوا منها مدينة هيلينية تقليدية، لكن هذه المحاولة باءت بالفشل سنة 168 ق.م، عندما قام المكابيين بثورة على الحاكم أنطيوخوس الرابع، تحت قيادة كبير الكهنة «متياس» وأبنائه الخمسة، ونجحوا بتأسيس المملكة الحشمونائيمية وعاصمتها القدس سنة 152 ق.م. استولى قائد الجيش الروماني «پومپيوس الكبير»، على القدس في عام 63 ق.م بعد أن استغل صراعًا على سدّة المُلك بين الملوك الحشمونائيمية، وبهذا ضُمت القدس إلى الجمهورية الرومانية.\n\nالحروب اليهودية الرومانية\nأقدم الرومان على تنصيب حيرود الأول ملكًا على اليهود ليضمنوا سيطرتهم وتحكمهم بمملكة يهوذا، فكرّس حيرود عهده لتجميل المدينة وتطوير مرافقها، فبنى عددًا من الأسوار والقصور والأبراج والقلاع، وقام بتوسيع المعبد حتى تضاعف حجم المنطقة حيث يقع. وبعد وفاة حيرود الأول في السنة السادسة قبل الميلاد، خلفه حيرود الثاني في حكم القدس من عام 4 قبل الميلاد حتى 6 بعده وعندها أخضع الرومان مملكة يهوذا للحكم الروماني المباشر نتيجة لعدم ثقة الحكومة بحيرود، فأصبحت تُعرف بمقاطعة اليهودية، على الرغم من أن خلفاء حيرود الأول، المتحدرين من أغريباس الثاني، استمروا بحكم المناطق المجاورة بوصفهم ملوك تابعين لروما حتى سنة 96 ميلادية.\nشهد الحكم الروماني المباشر للقدس حوادث كثيرة، أولها الثورة اليهودية الكبرى، التي استمرت من سنة 66 إلى سنة 70م، حيث قام اليهود في القدس بأعمال شغب وعصيان مدني قمعها الحاكم الروماني «تيطس» بالقوة فأحرق المدينة وأسر كثيراً من اليهود ودُمّر المعبد للمرة الثانية، وعادت الأمور إلى طبيعتها في ظل الاحتلال الروماني للمدينة المقدسة. ثم عاود اليهود التمرد وإعلان العصيان مرتين في عاميّ 115 و132م، والمرة الأخيرة عُرفت بثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، تيمنًا بقائد العصيان، وخلالها تمكن اليهود بالفعل من السيطرة على المدينة، وأعلنوها عاصمة لمملكة يهوذا مجددًا، إلا أن الإمبراطور الروماني «هادريان» تعامل مع الثوّار بعنف وأسفر ذلك عن تدمير القدس للمرة الثانية، وأخرج اليهود المقيمين فيها ولم يبق إلا المسيحيين، ومن شدّة نقمة الإمبراطور على اليهود، أصدر مرسومًا بجعل المدينة ذات طابع روماني فتم تغيير اسمها إلى «مستعمرة إيليا الكاپيتولينيّة» واشترط ألا يسكنها يهودي، بل أقدم على تغيير اسم مقاطعة اليهودية بكاملها وجعله «مقاطعة سوريا الفلسطينية» (باللاتينية: Syria Palaestina) تيمنًا بالفلستينيون الذين سكنوا الساحل الجنوبي الكنعانيون.\n\nخضعت المدينة لسيطرة الرومان ثم الروم البيزنطيين خلال القرون الخمسة التي تلت ثورة شمعون بن كوكبة، وبعد أن نقل الإمبراطور الروماني قسطنطين الأول عاصمة الإمبراطورية الرومانية من روما إلى بيزنطية، وأعلن المسيحية ديانة رسمية للدولة، أمر بتشييد عدد من المعالم المسيحية بالقدس، فبنيت كنيسة القيامة عام 326م، فكانت تلك نقطة تحول بالنسبة للمسيحيين في المدينة، حيث لم يعودوا مضطهدين، واستطاعوا ممارسة شعائرهم الدينية بحريّة. أصبحت القدس مركزًا لبطريركية من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، وهي إلى جانب القدس: الإسكندرية وروما والقسطنطينية وأنطاكية، بعد أن تقرر إنشائها في مجمع نيقية. استمرت القدس بالنمو والاتساع منذ أن انتهى عهد الهيكل الثاني بعد تدمير الأخير، حيث بلغت مساحتها كيلومترين مربعين (0.8 أميال مربعة.) ووصل عدد سكانها إلى حوالي 200,000 نسمة. استمر حظر دخول اليهود إلى القدس طيلة عهد قسطنطين الأول حتى القرن السابع الميلادي.\n\nحروب الروم والفرس\nانقسمت الإمبراطورية الرومانية عام 395م إلى قسمين متناحرين: الإمبراطورية الغربية وعاصمتها روما، والإمبراطورية الشرقية أو البيزنطية وعاصمتها القسطنطينية، وخضعت القدس مع باقي بلاد الشام إلى الإمبراطورية الأخيرة. شجع الانقسام الروماني الفرس على الإغارة على القدس، فأمر شاه الإمبراطورية الساسانية، كسرى الثاني، قائدا جيوشه «شهربراز» و«شاهين»، بالسير إلى سوريا واستخلاص القدس من أيدي الروم، ففعلا ما طُلب منهما ونجحا في احتلالها، خصوصًا بعد أن ساعدهم اليهود في فلسطين، الذين كانوا ناقمين على البيزنطيين.\nفتح الفرس المدينة في سنة 614م، بعد حصار استمر 21 يومًا. تنص السجلات البيزنطية أن الفرس واليهود ذبحوا آلاف المسيحيين من سكان القدس، وما زال هذا الأمر موضع جدال بين المؤرخين، حيث قال البعض بصحته ونفاه البعض الآخر. استمرت المدينة خاضعة للفرس طيلة 15 سنة، إلى أن استطاع الروم استعادتها سنة 629م تحت قيادة الإمبراطور هرقل، وظلت بأيديهم حتى الفتح الإسلامي عام 636م.\nيؤمن المسلمون أنه خلال هذه الفترة، وبالتحديد في عام 621م تقريبًا، شهدت القدس زيارة النبي محمد، حيث أسرى به الملاك جبريل ليلاً من المسجد الحرام إلى المسجد الأقصى ثم صعد إلى السماوات العلى حيث رأى الأنبياء والرسل السابقين وعاد بعد أن خاطب الله الذي علّمه عدد الصلوات المفروضة على الإنسان، وبهذا الحدث، أصبحت القدس ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي\nأصبحت القدس مدينة مقدسة بالنسبة للمسلمين بعد حادثة الإسراء والمعراج، وبعد أن فُرضت الصلاة على المسلمين، أصبحوا يتوجهون أثناء إقامتها نحو المدينة، وبعد حوالي 16 شهرًا، عاد المسلمون ليتوجهوا في صلاتهم نحو مكة بدلاً من القدس، بسبب كثرة تعيير اليهود للنبي محمد وللمسلمين بسبب استقبالهم لقبلة اليهود، ولأسباب أخرى.\n\nفي عهد عمر بن الخطاب والفتوحات الإسلامية، أُرسل عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح لفتح فلسطين عامة ونشر الدعوة الإسلامية فيها، لكن القدس عصيت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعة أسوارها، حيث اعتصم أهلها داخل الأسوار. وعندما طال حصار المسلمين لها، طلب رئيس البطاركة والأساقفة، المدعو «صفرونيوس»، طلب منهم أن لا يسلم القدس إلا للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب بشخصه. فأرسل عمرو بن العاص يخبر عمر في المدينة بما طلبه صفرونيوس رئيس الأساقفة المسيحيين في القدس فاستشار الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب أصحابه فكان أول من تكلم عثمان بن عفان فقال: «أقم ولا تسر إليهم فإذا رأوا أنك بأمرهم مستخفن ولقتالهم مستحقر فلا يلبثون إلا اليسير حتى ينزلوا على الصغار ويعطوا الجزية». وقال علي بن أبي طالب: «إني أرى أنك إن سرت إليهم فتح الله هذه المدينة على يديك وكان في مسيرك الأجر العظيم». ففرح عمر بن الخطاب بمشورة علي فقال: «لقد أحسن عثمان النظر في المكيدة للعدو وأحسن علي المشورة للمسلمين فجزاهما الله خيراً ولست آخذاً إلا بمشورة علي فما عرفناه إلا محمود المشورة ميمون الغرة».\nفقصد عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه ومعهما ناقة إلى بيت المقدس في رحلة شاقة. وما أن وصلا مشارف القدس حتى أطل عليهما صفرونيوس والبطاركة وسألوا من هذين الرجلين فقال المسلمون إنه عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه، فسأل أيهما عمر فقيل ذاك الواقف على قدميه إذ كان خادمه ممتطيا الناقة فذهلوا بهذا لأنه مذكور في كتبهم، فكان الفتح العمري لبيت المقدس. كتب عمر مع المسيحيين وثيقةً عُرفت باسم «العهدة العمرية» وهي وثيقة منحتهم الحرية الدينية مقابل الجزية، وتعهد بالحفاظ على ممتلكاتهم ومقدساتهم، وعرض صفرونيوس على عمر بن الخطاب أن يؤدي الصلاة في كنيسة القيامة بعد أن حان موعدها أثناء زيارته لها، فخرج من الكنيسة وصلى على مبعدة منها وعاد. ولمّا سأله البطريرك صفرونيوس عن السبب أجابه أنه يخاف من أن يتخذ المسلمون من فعله ذريعة فيما بعد للسيطرة على الكنيسة فيقولون من بعده «ها هنا صلّى عمر» وبالتالي يحولون الكنيسة إلى مسجد للمسلمين. سمح المسلمون لليهود بالرجوع للسكن في المدينة بعد فتحها، وطبقوا عليهم ما طبقوه على المسيحيين من حماية لمقدساتهم مقابل الجزية. أقام المسلمون مسجدًا في الموقع الذي صلّى به عمر بن الخطاب، بالقرب من مدخل كنيسة القيامة اليوم، وقال الأسقف الغالي «أركولف» الذي عاش في القدس من سنة 679 حتى سنة 688، أن مسجد عمر كان مبنًى خشبيًا مربع الشكل بُني على أنقاض بعض المباني والمنشآت، وكان يتسع لحوالي 3,000 مصل.\n\nقام عمر بن الخطاب بعد فتح المدينة بالبحث عن مكان المسجد الأقصى المذكور في القرآن والصخرة المقدسة واضعًا نصب عينيه الرواية التي سمعها من محمد ليلة الإسراء، وسأل الصحابة وكعب الأحبار، وهو من اليهود الذين أسلموا، والبطريرك صفرنيوس، وكان عمر بن الخطاب يراجع المرافقين له حين يدلونه على مكان لا يجد أوصافه تنطبق على ما لديه قائلاً: «لقد وصف لي رسول الله صلّى الله عليه وسلم المسجد بصفة ما هي عليه هذه». وقد عثر الخليفة على مكان المسجد الأقصى والصخرة المقدسة في وقت قصير، وكان المكان مطموراً بالأتربة التي تكاد تخفي معالمه. وأمر عمر بن الخطاب بإقامة مسجد موضع المسجد الأول، وإقامة ظلة من الخشب فوق الصخرة المقدسة، وعندما جاء الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة فوق الصخرة المقدسة عام 691، ثم بنى الخليفة الوليد بن عبد الملك الجامع القبلي عام 709. يقول المؤرخ من القرن العاشر، محمد بن أحمد شمس الدين المقدسي، أن عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبة الصخرة وجعل منها ذهبية كي تطغى على قبب الكنائس المنتشرة في القدس، ولتصبح معلمًا بارزًا يلفت نظر الزائر أوّل ما يراها. اهتم الأمويون والعباسيون بالمدينة فشهدت نهضة علمية في مختلف الميادين، لكن شهرتها سرعان ما تضعضعت بسبب عدم الاستقرار الذي شهدته الدولة العباسية وانقسامها إلى دويلات عديدة.\n\nعهد الصليبيين، الأيوبيين، والمماليك\nأدّى تفكك الدولة العباسية إلى دويلات متناحرة إلى ضعف العمل بالشريعة الإسلامية من قبل بعض الحكّام، فلقي المسيحيون كثيرًا من الاضطهاد، وهُدمت كنيسة القيامة في القدس خلال عهد الخليفة الفاطمي، أبو علي منصور الحاكم بأمر الله، وتعرّضت حياة الحجاج الأوروبيين للخطر. وعندما سقطت القدس بقبضة الأتراك السلاجقة سنة 1076، ازدادت الحالة سوءًا وكثر التعدي على الحجاج الأوروبيين بشكل خاص بسبب ما كانوا يحملونه معهم من النفائس والأموال، فكانت تلك إحدى الأسباب التي أدّت لنشوب الحروب الصليبية. انطلق الصليبيون في حملتهم الأولى سنة 1095 متوجهين إلى مدينة القدس، فوصلوها في سنة 1099 وضربوا الحصار عليها فسقطت في أيديهم بعد شهر من الحصار، وقتل الصليبيون فور دخولهم القدس قرابة 70 ألفًا من المسلمين واليهود وانتهكوا مقدساتهم، وقامت في القدس منذ ذلك التاريخ مملكة لاتينية تُحكم من قبل ملك كاثوليكي فرض الشعائر الكاثوليكية على المسيحيين الأرثوذكس مما أثار غضبهم.\n\nاستطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد القدس من الصليبيين عام 1187 بعد معركة حطين، وعامل أهلها معاملة طيبة، وأزال الصليب عن قبة الصخرة، ودعا اليهود والمسلمين ليعودوا إلى المدينة، واهتم بعمارتها وتحصينها. ولكن الصليبيين نجحوا في السيطرة على المدينة بعد وفاة صلاح الدين في عهد الإمبراطور فريدريش الأول بربروسا إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة، وكانت القدس في هذه الفترة قد ضعف شأنها وأفل نجمها وأصبحت مجرّد قرية عاديّة نظرًا لتراجع أهميتها الإستراتيجية، خصوصًا بسبب انهماك أولاد صلاح الدين بالنزاع فيما بينهم، وعدم تركيزهم على محاربة الصليبيين. ظلت القدس بأيدي الصليبيين 11 عامًا إلى أن استردها نهائياً الملك الصالح نجم الدين أيوب عام 1244.\nتعرضت المدينة لغزو التتار الخوارزميين عام 1244، الذين قضوا على القسم الأعظم من سكانها المسيحيين وطردوا اليهود منهم. هُزم التتار على يد المماليك بقيادة سيف الدين قطز والظاهر بيبرس في معركة عين جالوت عام 1259، وضمت فلسطين بما فيها القدس إلى السلطنة المملوكية التي حكمت مصر والشام بعد الدولة الأيوبية حتى عام 1517. وخلال هذه الفترة تعرّضت المدينة والمنطقة ككل لسلسلة من الزلازل وتفشّى فيها وباء الطاعون الأسود.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت جيوش العثمانيين فلسطين بقيادة السلطان سليم الأول بعد معركة مرج دابق في سنة 1517، وأصبحت القدس مدينة تابعة للدولة العثمانية طيلة 400 سنة حتى سقوطها بيد قوّات الحلفاء في الحرب العالمية الأولى سنة 1917. تمتعت القدس بعهد من الرخاء والازدهار خلال عهد السلطان سليمان الأول \"القانوني\"، خليفة سليم الأول، حيث أعاد الأخير بناء أسوار المدينة وقبة الصخرة. استمرت القدس خلال معظم العهد العثماني مجرّد مدينة محلّية عادية ولم يعلوا شأنها التجاري أو الثقافي بشكل يُذكر، لكنها بقيت من ضمن المدن العثمانية المهمة نظرًا لمكانتها الدينية. تطوّرت الحياة المقدسيّة بشكل ملحوظ خلال القرن التاسع عشر بعد أن أنشأت السلطات العثمانية عدد من المرافق الحديثة لتسهيل حياة الناس، فافتتح مركز للبريد وأنشأت خطوط سير نظامية مخصصة لمركبات الجياد العمومية، وأُنيرت الشوارع بالمصابيح الزيتيّة، وفي أواسط القرن سالف الذكر أنشأ العثمانيون أوّل طريق معبّدة بين القدس ويافا، وبحلول عام 1892، كانت المدينة موصولة بغيرها من المدن الشاميّة والحجازية بسكة حديدية.\nخلال الفترة الممتدة من عام 1831 حتى عام 1840، أصبحت فلسطين جزءًا من الدولة المصرية التي أقامها محمد علي باشا، وخلال هذا العهد أخذت الإرساليات والقنصليات الأجنبية تضع موطئ قدم لها في المدينة. وفي سنة 1836، سمح إبراهيم باشا بن محمد علي، سمح لليهود أن يعيدوا إنشاء أربعة معابد رئيسيّة، ومن ضمنها كنيس الخراب. ثار الشوام على الحكم المصري بعد أن استقر في البلاد لأسباب مختلفة منها زيادة الضرائب بمقدار لم يعهده الناس أيام العثمانيين والتجنيد الإجباري في الجيش المصري، وكان من ضمن هذه الثورات ثورة قامت في سنة 1834 بفلسطين بقيادة قاسم الأحمد، الذي قاد جيشًا من الثوّار من مدينة نابلس تعاونه عشائر بلدة أبو غوش، وهاجم القدس ودخلها بتاريخ 31 مايو 1834، لكن الجيش المصري استطاع أن يرد الثوّار على أعقابهم في الشهر التالي.\nعادت القدس إلى الحكم العثماني بعد هزيمة المصريين أمام الجيوش الحليفة العثمانية والأوروبية سنة 1840، إلا أن كثيرًا من المصريين بقي واستقر بالمدينة، وفي نفس الفترة قدمت وفود من اليهود والمسلمين المغاربة، من مدينة الجزائر وغيرها من مدن المغرب العربي، واستقرت في القدس. أخذت القوى العظمى في العالم تتدخل في الشؤون الداخلية العثمانية بشكل متزايد خلال عقد الأربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بحجة حماية الأقليات الدينية في الدولة العثمانية، وقد لعب القناصلة في القدس دورًا كبيرًا في هذه المسألة. أفاد القنصل البروسي بالقدس أن عدد سكان المدينة في سنة 1845 وصل إلى 16,410 نسمة، منهم 7,120 يهودي، 5,000 مسلم، 3,390 مسيحي، 800 جندي تركي، و100 شخص أوروبي. ارتفعت نسبة الحجاج المسيحيين في المدينة خلال العهد العثماني، الأمر الذي كان يجعل جمهرة المسيحيين بالقدس تتضاعف في حجمها خلال موسم الفصح.\n\nأخذت المنازل تظهر خارج أسوار القدس خلال عقد الستينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بعد أن ازداد عدد سكان المدينة بفعل المهاجرين، ولإقامة منشآت أكثر صحيّة مخصصة لاستضافة الحجاج المسيحيين، خصوصًا وأن كثيرًا منهم كان يشتكي من الاكتظاظ السكاني داخل المدينة ومن رداءة نظام الصرف الصحي. ومن المنشآت المهمة التي برزت خلال هذه الفترة، المجمّع الروسي سنة 1860، الذي خُصص لاستقبال وإيواء الحجاج الروس الأرثوذكس. قدّرت إحدى إحصائيات إرسالية أمريكية عدد سكان القدس سنة 1867 «بأكثر من» 15,000 نسمة، 6,000 منهم مسلمين، وما بين 4,000 إلى 5,000 منهم يهود، كذلك تبيّن أن عدد الحجاج الروس كان يتراوح بين 5,000 إلى 6,000 حاج كل عام. أنشأت الدولة العثمانية عام 1880 متصرفية القدس، وأزيل الحائط القديم للمدينة عام 1898 لتسهيل دخول القيصر الألماني ڤيلهلم الثاني وحاشيته أثناء زيارته للقدس. وظلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني حتى هزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني وحرب سنة 1948\nسقطت القدس بيد الجيش البريطاني بقيادة الفريق أول إدموند ألنبي في سنة 1917، بعد أن تقهقر الجيش العثماني مهزومًا أمامهم، وفي سنة 1922 منحت عصبة الأمم بريطانيا حق الانتداب على فلسطين وإمارة شرق الأردن والعراق، وأصبحت القدس عاصمة فلسطين تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nدخلت المدينة في عهد جديد كان من أبرز سماته زيادة أعداد المهاجرين اليهود إليها خاصة بعد وعد بلفور الذي أصدرته الحكومة البريطانية، وقد أظهرت بعض إحصائيات تلك الفترة أن عدد سكان المدينة ارتفع من 52,000 نسمة عام 1922 إلى 165,000 نسمة عام 1948 بفعل هجرة اليهود. أدّى ازدياد عدد اليهود في فلسطين عمومًا والقدس خصوصًا، وشرائهم للأراضي ومساعدة البريطانيين لهم، أدّى إلى استياء المقدسيين من مسلمين ومسيحيين، فقامت أعمال شغب في سنتيّ 1920 و1929، وعُرفت الأخيرة بثورة البراق، قُتل خلالها عدد من اليهود. عمل البريطانيون على إخماد هذه الثورات، وساهموا في جعل اليهود يستقرون في المدينة عن طريق بنائهم لأحياء سكنيّة كاملة في شمال وغرب المدينة، وإنشائهم لعدد من مؤسسات التعليم العالي، مثل الجامعة العبرية.\nأحيلت قضية القدس إلى الأمم المتحدة بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية، فأصدرت الهيئة الدولية قرارها في 29 نوفمبر سنة 1947 بتدويل القدس تحت رعايتها وإشرافها. وجاء في القرار أنه سوف يُطبّق طيلة 10 سنوات، ويشمل مدينة بيت لحم، وأنه بعد هذه الفترة سيتم إجراء استفتاء عام لتحديد نظام الحكم الذي يرغب أغلبية سكان المدينة بتطبيقه عليهم. إلا أن تطبيق هذا القرار لم يُكتب له أن يتم، فبعد أن أعلنت بريطانيا في عام 1948 إنهاء الانتداب في فلسطين وسحب قواتها، استغلت العصابات اليهودية حالة الفراغ السياسي والعسكري وأعلنت قيام الدولة الإسرائيلية، فثار العرب عمومًا والفلسطينيون خصوصًا وأعلنوا الحرب على إسرائيل، فهوجمت المدينة من قبل الجيش العربي والثوّار الفلسطينيين، وقُتل عدد من الإسرائيليين في هذا الهجوم وتم أسر البعض الآخر. كذلك هاجم القنّاصة العرب القسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nالتقسيم والضم\nكان من نتائج حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب والإسرائيليين أن قُسمت القدس إلى شطرين: الجزء الغربي الخاضع لإسرائيل، والجزء الشرقي الخاضع للأردن. وفي شهر نوفمبر من نفس السنة، أقيمت منطقة عازلة بين الجزئين، حيث قابل قائد القوّات الإسرائيلية في القدس، موشيه دايان، نظيره الأردني عبد الله التل في إحدى منازل حيّ مصرارة بالقدس، وقاما بتعليم الحدود الفاصلة بين شطريّ المدينة، حيث لوّنت حصة إسرائيل باللون الأحمر وحصة الأردن باللون الأخضر. نجم هذا اللقاء عن رسم خريطة لحدود غير رسميّة بين الطرفين المتحاربين، لكنها أخذت بعين الاعتبار عند توقيع اتفاقية الهدنة بين إسرائيل ولبنان ومصر والأردن وسوريا سنة 1949، والتي اتفقت فيها تلك الدول على وقف إطلاق النار والتزام الإسرائيليين بالبقاء ضمن هذه الحدود لحين إيجاد حل سلمي للنزاع. كذلك نصّت هذه الاتفاقية على تقسيم القدس على أن يبقى جبل المشارف في يد إسرائيل على الرغم من أنه يقع في القسم الشرقي، بوصفه جيب داخلي. بناءً على هذا، أقيمت الحواجز الاسمنتيّة والأسلاك الشائكة في وسط المدينة ومرّت بالقرب من باب الخليل في الجانب الغربي من البلدة القديمة، وأُنشأت نقطة عبور شمال الأخيرة عُرفت بمعبر ماندلباوم. استمرت بعض المناوشات العسكرية بين الأردن وإسرائيل بين الحين والآخر على الرغم من اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار، إلا أنها لم تكن ذات أهمية تُذكر غالبًا. كان داود بن گوريون، رئيس وزراء إسرائيل، قد أعلن في 3 ديسمبر 1948 أن القدس الغربية عاصمة للدولة الإسرائيلية الوليدة، وفي سنة 1950 أعلن الأردن رسميًا خضوع القدس الشرقية للسيادة الأردنية، وقد اعترفت المملكة المتحدة وباكستان بهذا الضم، فيما لم تعترف دول أخرى بهذا الأمر بحجة أن القدس الشرقية خضعت للأردن بحكم الأمر الواقع وليس بشكل رسمي، ويشكك البعض إن كانت باكستان قد اعترفت بضم الأردن للقدس الشرقية حتى.\nخضعت أغلبية المواقع المقدسة في القدس للسيادة الأردنية، بما أن أغلبها يقع في القسم الشرقي من المدينة، فأجرت الحكومة الأردنية عدد من الإصلاحات والترميمات لقبة الصخرة والمسجد الأقصى، وسمحت للمسيحيين الأجانب بزيارة المقدسات المسيحية شرط خضوعهم للرقابة، أما اليهود فلم يُسمح لهم بدخول المدينة لاعتبارات سياسية، حيث كانت الحكومة تخشى أن يعمل بعضهم في الجاسوسية لصالح إسرائيل.\n\nخاض العرب وإسرائيل حربًا أخرى في سنة 1967 انتصرت فيها الأخيرة، وقامت بالسيطرة على القدس الشرقية، وكان من نتيجة ذلك أن عاد اليهود ليدخلوا دون أي قيود إلى أماكنهم المقدسة، كذلك أزيلت القيود المفروضة على المسيحيين الغربيين، أما المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة فاستمرا خاضعين للأوقاف الإسلامية. قام الإسرائيليون بهدم حارة المغاربة بعد دخولهم المدينة، بما أنها كانت تواجه حائط البراق الذي يتعبّد اليهود عنده، ولكي يجعلوا من الموقع ساحة لرفع الصلاة اليهودية. قامت إسرائيل بتوسيع حدود المدينة بعد انتهاء الحرب وذلك عبر بناء عدد من الأحياء السكنية والمستعمرات اليهودية شرق الخط الأخضر، وقد أقدمت إسرائيل منذ سنة 1967 بمحاولات عديدة تهدف إلى تهويد المناطق التي احتلتها بعد الحرب، وذلك عبر وسائل عديدة، منها التركيز الإعلامي على أهمية المواقع الأثرية العبرانية في المدينة.\nقوبل ضم إسرائيل للقدس الشرقية بالاستنكار الدولي، وبعد أن أصدرت إسرائيل قانون أساس اعتبرت فيه القدس الموحدة عاصمة أبدية للبلاد، أصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 الذي نص على أن إسرائيل خرقت قانونًا دوليًا وطالب جميع الدول الأعضاء بسحب ما تبقى من سفاراتها من القدس. ما زالت مسألة القدس تُشكل قضية محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي، خصوصًا مع إقرار الحكومة الإسرائيلية بناء وحدات استيطانية جديدة على الدوام في حارات وأحياء في البلدة القديمة يسكنها مسلمون وتحوي مقدسات إسلامية، في سبيل رفع عدد اليهود في القدس الشرقية، إلا أن علماء الدين المسلمون وعدد من المؤرخين العرب يزعمون أن اليهود ليس لهم أي حق في المدينة لأسباب متنوعة، منها أن حائط البراق الذي بُني منذ حوالي 2,500 سنة كان جزءًا من مسجد سليمان الذي تسميه اليهود هيكل سليمان. طالب الفلسطينيون وما زالوا بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة للدولة الفلسطينية المستقبلية، لذا لطالما كانت حدود المدينة موضع نقاش وجدال في المحادثات الثنائية بين السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل. أقام بعض الأشخاص من الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين الراغبين بالسلام نصبًا تذكاريًا مصنوع من الأسلحة القديمة البالية، يواجه سور القدس القديم ونقشوا عليه عبارات بالعربية والعبرية مقتبسة من سفر أشعياء.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينة القدس في وسط فلسطين تقريبًا شرق البحر المتوسط، على رعن هضبة من هضاب جبال الخليل، التي تضم عددًا من الجبال بدورها، وهي: جبل الزيتون أو جبل الطور شرق المدينة، جبل المشارف ويقع إلى الشمال الغربي للمدينة، ويُقال له أيضًا «جبل المشهد»، وقد أقيمت فوقه في سنة 1925 الجامعة العبرية، ومستشفى هداسا الجامعي في سنة 1939، جبل صهيون ويقع إلى الجنوب الغربي وتكوّن البلدة القديمة جزءًا كبيرًا منه وتمر أسوارها من فوقه، جبل المكبر الذي سُمي بهذا الاسم عندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس وكبّر على متنه، بالإضافة إلى جبل النبي صموئيل، وجبل أبو غنيم. ترتفع القدس عن سطح البحر المتوسط نحو 750 مترًا (2,460 قدمًا)، وعن سطح البحر الميت نحو 1150 مترًا (3,770 قدمًا). بالإضافة إلى جبال القدس فإن هناك ثلاثة أودية تحيط بها وهي: وادي سلوان أو وادي جهنم واسمه القديم «وادي قدرون»، الوادي أو الواد، وادي الجوز، ونبع أم الدرج.\nكانت القدس محاطة بغابات من أشجار الجوز الزيتون الصنوبر منذ القدم، إلا أن الحروب والاستغلال البشري كان لها وقعٌ مدمّر عليها، فاختفت معظم هذه الغابات، وقد أثّر ذلك على تماسك التربة، فاضطر المزارعون إلى تشييد المدرّجات الزراعية على عدد من السفوح لمنع تآكلها وانجراف تربتها. شكّل شح المياه مشكلة للمقدسيين منذ العهود الأولى لاستيطان المدينة، فقاموا بتشييد عدد من القناطر والقنوات لجرّ مياه الأنهار، إضافة لعدد من البرك والآبار لجمع ماء الأمطار، وما زال البعض منها موجودًا بالبلدة القديمة. ومن أبرز آبار المدينة بئر أيوب، نسبة إلى النبي أيوب، وهذه البئر هي التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن بسورة ص، حيث جاء: ﴿ارْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ﴾، كذلك من أبرز بركها أو عيونها، العين المعروفة بعين سلوان، وهي إحدى العيون الجارية التي يؤمن المسلمون أنها ذُكرت في القرآن أيضًا في سورة الرحمن: ﴿فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ﴾. قال مجير الدين الحنبلي عن القدس في نهاية القرن التاسع سنة 900 هـ: \n\nتبعد القدس نحو 60 كيلومترًا (37 ميلاً) عن البحر المتوسط، وحوالي 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) عن البحر الميت، و250 كيلومتر (155 ميلاً) عن البحر الأحمر، وتبعد عن عمّان 88 كيلومتر (55 ميلاً)، وعن بيروت 388 كيلومتر (241 ميلاً)، وعن دمشق 290 كيلومتر (180 ميلاً). أما المدن والبلدات المجاورة للقدس فتشمل: بيت لحم وبيت جالا جنوبًا، أبو ديس ومستوطنة معاليه أدوميم شرقًا، مڤاسرت صهيون غربًا، ورام الله ومستوطنة گفعات زئيف شمالاً.\n\nمناطق القدس\nتمتد أراضي بلدية القدس اليوم لتشمل مناطق شاسعة كانت في السابق قرى أو ضواحي للمدينة، فتشمل حدود البلدية كل من: بيت حنينا، كفر عقب، شعفاط، التل الفرنسي، جبل المشارف، الشيخ جراح، وادي الجوز، جبل الزيتون، البلدة القديمة، سلوان، العيسوية، رأس العمود، أبو الطور، جبل المكبر، صور باهر، أم طوبا، جبل أبو غنيم، بيت صفافا والولجة، قائمة المدن والقرى في فلسطين التاريخية.\nمن جهة أخرى، أقامت إسرائيل العديد من المستوطنات، كما قامت بضم مستوطنات قديمة أخرى خارج حدود البلدية بعد احتلالها للقدس الشرقية عام 1967 وبنائها لجدار الفصل عام 2002، والذي عزل العديد من البلدات العربية عن القدس، كالعيزرية، أبو ديس، الرام، حزما، عناتا، السواحرة الشرقية، بيت إكسا، الشيخ سعد وقلنديا - حيث مطار القدس الدولي، والتي من المفترض أن تشكل الامتداد الطبيعي لتوسع الأحياء العربية في المدينة مستقبلاً. وهذه المستوطنات هي: مستوطنة عطروت، مستوطنة نيڤيه يعقوب، مستوطنة بيسغات زئيف، مستوطنة رامات أشكول، مستوطنة غيلو، مستوطنة هماطوس ومستوطنة ناليبوت مزراح.\nالقدس الغربية\nأقدمت إسرائيل بعد قيامها عام 1948، على تدمير معظم القرى الواقعة غرب القدس، من أهمها: المالحة، دير ياسين، عين كارم، لفتا، والقسطل. وأقامت مكانها العديد من المستوطنات التي أصبحت تشكل فيما بعد مناطق القدس الغربية، وهي: گفعات شاؤول، بيت هيكرم، جبل هرتزل، كريات هيوفيل، عميق زيفائيم، يمين موشيه، ربحاميا، نحلاؤوت، محانيه يهودا، مئة سيعاريم، روميما وگفعات رام.\n\nالحياة البرية والغابات\nيقع في محيط القدس عدة غابات ومناطق برية مثل وادي الغزال، تقع هذه المنطقة بوسط القدس بالقرب من حي «گفعات مردخاي» اليهودي،\nوهي أرض مكشوفة تبلغ مساحتها 260 دونمًا. أُطلق هذا الاسم على الوادي كون ما يُقارب من 17 غزالاً جبليًا تتخذ منه موطنًا ولا تستطيع مغادرته لإحاطة المدينة به من مختلف الجوانب. كان متعهدو العقارات والمقاولون قد خططوا لتحويل المنطقة إلى منطقة سكنية، لكن محبي الطبيعة وجمعية حماية البيئة في إسرائيل استطاعت إيقاف هذا الأمر، وإرغام السلطات المختصة على النظر في مسألة حماية الموقع.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز القدس بمناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط (تصنيف كوبن للمناخ: Csa)، مع صيف حار جاف، وشتاء مُعتدل البرودة رطب. تتساقط الثلوج عادةً مرة أو مرتين خلال الشتاء، على الرغم من أن المدينة تختبر تساقطًا كثيفًا للثلوج مرة كل ثلاث إلى أربع سنوات، في المتوسط، مع تراكم قصير العمر.\nيُعتبر يناير أبرد شهور السنة، بمتوسط درجة حرارة 9.1 درجة °مئوية (48.4 درجة °فهرنهايت)؛ يُعد شهري يوليو وأغسطس الأكثر سخونة، حيث يبلغ متوسط درجة الحرارة 24.2 درجة °مئوية (75.6 درجة °فهرنهايت)، وعادة ما تكون أشهر الصيف جافة. يبلغ متوسط هطول الأمطار السنوي حوالي 537 مليمترًا (21 إنشًا)، وذلك في الفترة الممتدة بين شهريّ أكتوبر ومايو، أما الأشهر الأخرى فينعدم فيها تساقط الأمطار غالبًا. تساقط الثلوج ليس شائعًا، لكن تساقط الثلوج بغزارة يعتبر نادرًا. تلقت القدس أكثر من 30 سم (12 بوصة) من الثلج في 13 ديسمبر 2013، والتي شلت المدينة تقريبًا. مع متوسط درجات حرارة في الصيف مماثلة للسواحل، فإن التأثير البحري من البحر الأبيض المتوسط قوي، لا سيما بالنظر إلى أن القدس تقع على خط عرض مشابه للصحاري الحارة غير البعيدة إلى الشرق.\nكانت أعلى درجة حرارة مُسجلة في القدس 44.4 درجة °مئوية (111.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 28 و30 أغسطس 1881، وكانت أدنى درجة حرارة مُسجلة −6.7 درجة °مئوية (19.9 درجة °فهرنهايت) في 25 يناير 1907.\nيأتي معظم تلوث الهواء في القدس من حركة مرور السيارات. لم يتم بناء العديد من الشوارع الرئيسية في القدس لاستيعاب هذا الحجم الكبير من حركة المرور، مما أدى إلى ازدحام حركة المرور والمزيد من انبعاثات أول أكسيد الكربون في الهواء. تُساهم انبعاثات المصانع بنسبة ضئيلة من تلوّث الهواء بالمدينة، إلا أنه يمكن لتلك الصادرة عن المصانع الواقعة على ساحل البحر المتوسط أن تتجه شرقًا ناحية القدس وتُشكل ضبخانًا فوقها.\n\nالقرى\nقرى القدس عديدة وكثيرة فقد اختلف التحاق بعض القرى لمدينة القدس وفقًا للتغيرات التاريخية التي مرت بها المدينة. كان آخر تغيير لحدود مدينة القدس الإدارية في يونيو سنة 1967 بموجب قرار أصدرته الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد احتلال الضفة الغربية من الأردن. نص هذا القرار على ضم 70,4 كيلومترات مربعة إلى منطقة البلدية المقدسية الإسرائيلية وفرض القانون الإسرائيلي عليها. كانت 6,4 كيلومترات مربعة من المساحة المضمومة تابعة للبلدية المقدسية الأردنية قبل حرب سنة 1967، أما الباقي فكان من أراضي بعض القرى المجاورة للقدس. أقدم الإسرائيليون على هدم عدد من القرى الفلسطينية وبناء قرىً ومستوطنات جديدة على أنقاضها، وقد سمحت الحكومة في وقت لاحق لبعض المهجرين من الفلسطينيين بالعودة إلى قراهم، فأقاموا بجانب المستوطنات قرىً جديدة. حاز سكان المنطقة المضمومة على مكانة «مقيم دائم» في إسرائيل، دون أن يحصلوا على المواطنة، أما القرى التي بقيت خارج حدود القدس الإدارية وسكانها، فيخضعون لسيطرة الحكم العسكري أو لسيطرة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. وكانت الحكومة الإسرائيلية قد أصدرت قانون أملاك الغائب عام 1950، الذي منح إسرائيل صفة الوصي على على أملاك الفلسطينيين الغائبين، وأعطاها الحق في الاستيلاء عليها وإدارتها. من القرى العربية التي كانت بجوار القدس من جانبها الغربي قبل حرب سنة 1948 لم تبق إلا ثلاثًا: أبو غوش (أكبرها)، عين رافة، وعين نقوبا. تعتبر هذه القرى الثلاثة اليوم تجمعات عربية إسرائيلية وسكانها ذوي جنسية إسرائيلية. ومن قرى القدس الأخرى: إشوع، البريج، بيت أم الميس، بيت عطاب، بيت محسير، جرش، خربة العمور، خربة اللوز، دير الشيخ، وغيرها.\n\nالتركيبة السكانيّة\nأشارت الإحصاءات الإسرائيلية الرسمية الصادرة نهاية عام 2000 إلى أنّ تعداد السكان في المدينة ارتفع بنسبة 2% من إجمالي السكان البالغ 646,3 ألف نسمة، بينهم 436,7 ألف يهودي بنسبة 67,6%، في حين بلغ عدد السكان العرب 209,5 آلاف عربي بنسبة 32.4%. وقد تبيّن في إحصائية أخرى من نفس السنة أن نسبة السكان من اليهود تتراجع تدريجيًا بينما نسبة العرب في ازدياد مطّرد، ويرجع ذلك إلى نسبة الولادات الأعلى عند العرب وإلى هجرة البعض من اليهود إلى مدن وبلدان أخرى. كذلك أفادت نفس الدراسة أن حوالي 9% من جمهرة البلدة القديمة البالغة 32,488 نسمة كانوا يهودًا. بلغت نسبة الكثافة السكانيّة بالمدينة في نهاية عام 2005 حوالي 5,750.4 نسمة في الكيلومتر المربّع (14,893.5 نسمة/ميل مربّع)، وفي نهاية سنة 2006 أظهرت إحصائية أعدّتها مؤسسة إسرائيلية للدراسات حول مدينة القدس إن عدد سكان القدس بلغ 733 ألف شخص بينهم 481 ألف يهودي و252 ألف فلسطيني يعيشون خصوصًا في الأحياء الشرقية من المدينة. وفي شهر ديسمبر من سنة 2007، وصل عدد سكان القدس إلى 747,600 نسمة، 64% منهم يهود و32% مسلمين و2% مسيحيين.\n\nيخوض الفلسطينيون والإسرائيليون حربًا ديمغرافيّة في القدس، حيث يسعى كل طرف إلى زيادة عدد السكان المنتمين إلى عرقيته ليضمن هيمنته على المدينة، وتعمل الحكومة الإسرائيلية - كما تقول الدكتورة سارة هيرشكوبيتس رئيسة قسم التخطيط الإستراتيجي في بلدية القدس - على ألا تتعدى نسبة العرب بالمدينة 28%. وتحاول الحكومة الإسرائيلية زيادة عدد اليهود في المدينة بطرق عدة، منها على سبيل المثال العمل على إحلال اليهود محلّ العرب الذين هدّمت منازلهم بحجّة البناء دون تصريح. وتشير إحصائيات بيت الشرق لعام 1999 في هذا الصدد إلى هدم أكثر من ألفيْ منزل منذ عام 1967، مما خلق ظروفاً صعبة للفلسطينيين حيث يسكن معظمهم في منازل مكتظة. ومن الوسائل الأخرى التي تتّخذها إسرائيل لإجبار المقدسيّين على الهجرة من القدس، عدم منحهم تصاريح بناء إلا فيما ندر، وتسهيل بناء المنازل لليهود المهاجرين. وفي سنة 2005، قدم المدينة 2,850 مهاجر يهودي جديد من الولايات المتحدة وفرنسا ومن بعض دول الاتحاد السوڤيتي السابق، وبنهاية السنة ذاتها تبيّن أن 16,000 من السكان غادر المدينة، إلا أن جمهرة المدينة ما زالت في ازدياد بفضل ارتفاع نسبة الإنجاب بين الأهالي العرب واليهود الحريدية. يصل معدل الخصوبة الكلي في القدس إلى 4.02، وهو أعلى من ذاك الخاص بتل أبيب (1.98) والمعدل الوطني حتى، الذي يصل إلى 2.90.\n\nبلغت الزيادة الصافية للسكان في سنة 2000، بعد حساب الولادات والوفيات والمهاجرين من وإلى المدينة، 12600 نسمة، كان نصيب اليهود منها 2900 نسمة، في حين بلغت الزيادة العربية 9700. وبهذا كانت نسبة نمو السكان اليهود في القدس هي 0.7% بينما كانت عند السكان العرب 4.7%. وفي سنة 2005 ازداد عدد السكان بحوالي 13,000 نسمة، أي قرابة 1.8%، وهي نسبة مشابهة لنسبة معدّل النمو السكاني في إسرائيل في ذلك العام، إلا أن ما يميزها هو التباين في التركيبة السكانيّة والعرقيّة، فقرابة 31% من الجمهرة اليهودية تألفت من أولاد دون سن الخامسة عشر، بالمقابل فإن هذه النسبة وصلت لحوالي 42% عند السكان العرب، ويتوافق ذلك مع الدراسات التي أظهرت تراجع عدد اليهود في القدس خلال العقود الأربع الماضية، واتجاه معظمهم إلى المدن الساحلية والضواحي.\nعادت نسبة اليهود الحريدية في المدينة إلى الارتفاع بحلول عام 2009، حيث تبيّن في إحدى الإحصائيات أن 59,900 تلميذ من أصل 150,100، أو 40% منهم، يطلبون العلم في المدارس الرسميّة العلمانيّة والدينيّة على حد سواء، بينما 90,200 تلميذ أو 60% من المجموع الأصلي، يتلقون دراستهم في مدارس حريدية خاصة.\nيرى العديد من الإسرائيليين أن القدس مدينة فقيرة تمزقها النزاعات السياسية والدينية، لذا فهم يفضلون سكن مدن أخرى أكثر أمانًا وغنى، وبالمقابل تستقطب المدينة عددًا كبيرًا من الفلسطينيين من سكّان الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، كونها تقدم لهم فرص عمل وخدمات صحية أكبر من تلك المتاحة في مدنهم وقراهم. شجّع الزعماء الفلسطينيون والعرب السكان الفلسطينيين عبر السنين على البقاء في المدينة لتأكيد حقهم بالمطالبة بها، وقد فعل البعض منهم هذا.\n\nمخيم شعفاط\nتأسس مخيم شعفاط للاجئين في عام 1965، أي بعد أكثر من عقد واحد على تأسيس كافة المخيمات الرسمية الأخرى في الضفة الغربية، وذلك فوق أرض مساحتها 0,2 كيلومتر مربع شمال القدس. وقد تأسس مخيم شعفاط بعد أن تم إغلاق مخيم المعسكر في المدينة القديمة للقدس بسبب سوء الظروف الصحية فيه.\nوتعود أصول اللاجئين في مخيم المعسكر والذين رُحلوا إلى شعفاط إلى 55 قرية تابعة لمناطق القدس واللد ويافا والرملة. ومثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسس المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من الحكومة الأردنية.\nويُعد مخيم شعفاط المخيم الوحيد في الضفة الغربية الذي يقع ضمن الحدود البلدية للقدس. ولذلك، فإن اللاجئين فيه يحق لهم الحصول على هويات مدنية تابعة للقدس، الأمر الذي يضمن لهم حقوق الإقامة في القدس ويجعلهم مؤهلين للحصول على بعض الخدمات الاجتماعية الإسرائيلية، بما في ذلك الرعاية الصحية.\nوفي الوقت الذي تبين سجلات الأونروا الرسمية أن عدد اللاجئين المسجلين في المخيم يصل إلى حوالي 11,000 لاجئ، إلا أنه من المرجح أن يبلغ عدد اللاجئين فيه أكثر من 18,000. ويُقدر أن حوالي 4,000 لاجئ قد انتقلوا إلى المخيم في السنوات الأخيرة لتجنب فقدان حقوق الإقامة في القدس. ويعمل حوالي 70% من سكان المخيم في القطاع الخاص الإسرائيلي.\n\nتهويد القدس\nتتّبع إسرائيل سياسة دمج المستوطنات لاستيعاب أكبر عدد ممكن من اليهود داخل القدس، فعلى سبيل المثال دمجت الحكومة الإسرائيلية مستوطنة گفعات زئيف ومعاليه أدوميم ومناطق الخط الأخضر لاحتواء حوالي 30 ألف مستوطن جديد داخل المدينة. كما بنت 142 ألف شقة في القطاع اليهودي لزيادة حجم السكان فيها. تفيد إحدى تقارير البنك الدولي أن عدد مخالفات البناء في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1996 و2000، كان أكبر بأربع مرّات ونصف في الأحياء اليهودية، وأن عمليات الهدم في القدس الغربية كانت أقل بأربع مرّات من تلك الحاصلة في القدس الشرقية؛ كذلك أفاد التقرير أن السلطات الإسرائيلية كانت تمنح الفلسطينيين أذونًا بالبناء أقل بكثير من الأذون التي تمنحها لليهود، وأن المخالفين الفلسطينيين تُزال مخالفاتهم بنسبة أكبر من مخالفات اليهود. حصلت بعض المؤسسات اليهودية على إذن من الحكومة الإسرائيلية خلال السنوات القليلة الماضية، يسمح لها بتشييد المباني والمعالم على الأراضي المتنازع عليها، من شاكلة «حديقة الملك سليمان» المخطط إنشاؤها في قرية سلوان بمدينة داود، والتي يُشكل العرب حوالي 60% من سكانها، وفي مقبرة «مأمن الله». أطلق معارضو هذه الخطوات المُتخذة من قبل الحكومة الإسرائيلية مصطلح «تهويد القدس» على هذه الإجراءات، كونها تصب في مصلحة اليهود دون الفلسطينيين.\n\nالقدس الرسمية\nالبلديّة\nتأسس المجلس البلدي لمدينة القدس في سنة 1863 أبّان الحكم العثماني، وقد انقسم هذا المجلس إلى مجلسين عند تقسيم المدينة. تولت أمانة القدس الاهتمام بالقدس العربية بين نكبة فلسطين واحتلال القدس في حرب 1967.\nيتألّف مجلس بلديّة القدس الإسرائيلي اليوم من 31 عضوًا منتخبًا على رأسهم رئيس البلديّة، الذي يُنتخب لخمس سنوات، ويتمتع بحق تعيين ستة مفوضين بلديين لينوبوا عنه، وهؤلاء إلى جانب رئيس البلدية يتلقون رواتبهم كاملة من الحكومة الإسرائيلية، أما باقي الأعضاء فيُعتبر عملهم تطوعيًا. يعقد مجلس بلدية القدس معظم اجتماعاته بصفة سريّة، عدا جلسة واحدة في كل شهر تكون علنيّة. تُشكل الأحزاب الدينية عصبة قويّة داخل مجلس البلدية، حيث تسيطر غالبًا على معظم المقاعد. يقع دار بلدية القدس ومكتب رئيسها في ساحة الصفراء في شارع يافا. يتكوّن مجمّع البلدية، الذي افتتح في سنة 1993، من مبنيين حديثيّ البناء إلى جانب عشرة مبان قديمة مجددة، تحيط بساحة عامّة واسعة. تتبع المدينة محافظة القدس وتُشكّل عاصمتها. إضافة إلى ذلك، تقوم مؤسسة الأقصى لإعمار المقدسات بصيانة وترميم ورعاية المؤسسات والمباني الإسلامية في القدس.\nقامت بلدية القدس الغربية في سنة 1949 بإجراء مسابقة لتصميم علم للشطر الغربي من المدينة، ففاز تصميم تضمن رسمًا لخطين عريضين باللون الأزرق يرمزان إلى شال الصلاة اليهودية، على خلفية بيضاء يقع في وسطهما شعار المدينة. وجعلت إسرائيل التصميم الإسرائيلي شعارًا للمدينة بشطريها بعد حرب سنة 1967 عندما ضمت القدس الشرقية، على الرغم من أن السكان العرب والمجتمع الدولي لم يتعرف بذلك، لكن العلم والشعار بقيا بحكم الأمر الواقع. صُمم شعار القدس ما بين سنتيّ 1950 و1951، وهو يُظهر أسدًا جامحًا يُرمز به إلى أسد يهودا، شعار القبيلة اليهودية القديمة، محاطًا بأغصنة زيتون، وفي الخلفية رُسم حائط البراق. أما السلطة الفلسطينية فلم تنشئ شعار ولا علم للمدينة.\n\nرؤساء البلدية\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية القدس عدد من أعيان المدينة، كان أولهم «موسى العلمي». تولّى اليهود رئاسة البلدية لأوّل مرة في سنة 1937، وذلك عندما فاز «دانيال أستر» برئاسة البلدية بدعم من حكومة الانتداب البريطانية. وعندما انقسمت القدس إلى شطرين، أصبحت هناك بلديتين: بلدية القدس الشرقية ورئيسها عربي، وبلدية القدس الغربية ويرأسها إسرائيلي. أما أوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الشرقية فهو «أنور الخطيب»، وأوّل رؤساء بلدية القدس الغربية هو الحاكم العسكري «دوڤ يوسف». وعندما ضمّت إسرائيل القدس الشرقية بعد حرب حزيران سنة 1967، أسست بلدية «أورشليم القدس» وتولّى رئاستها «ثيودور كولك». يشغل نير بركات منصب رئيس بلدية أورشليم القدس حاليًا، ويرأس زكي الغول أمانة القدس الشرقية، بما أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وأغلب دول العالم لا تعتبر ضم الأخيرة قانونياً.\n\nالوضع السياسي\nبعد أن أصدرت هيئة الأمم المتحدة قرارها القاضي بتقسيم فلسطين في سنة 1947، نصّت على وجوب تدويل القدس تحت إشرافها ورقابتها، وقد سارع القادة اليهود إلى قبول هذا الأمر نظرًا لأنه يحقق مطامحهم في إقامة دولة لهم، بينما عارضه الزعماء العرب ورفضوا أي تقسيم يُخطط إجراؤه في فلسطين. انقسمت المدينة إلى شطرين بعد حرب سنة 1948 بين العرب وإسرائيل، واحتلت الأخيرة القسم الغربي، فيما سيطر الأردن على القسم الشرقي. اعتبرت معظم الدول، وما زالت، أن وضع القدس ينبغي أن يُحدد كما ورد في قرار التقسيم، لذا فإن أغلبها لا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل.\nبعد أن أعلن دافيد بن غوريون، أوّل رئيس وزراء لإسرائيل، أن القدس الغربية عاصمة البلاد، اتخذت جميع الهيئات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، من قضائية وتشريعية وتنفيذية، من المدينة مقرًا لها، عدا وزارة الدفاع، التي لا تزال تتخذ من منطقة كرياة بوسط تل أبيب مركزًا لها. سيطرت إسرائيل على المدينة بشطريها مباشرةً بعد حرب سنة 1967، وجعلت منها جزءًا من العاصمة بحكم الأمر الواقع، على الرغم من معارضة المجتمع الدولي لهذا الأمر. لا تزال هويّة القدس كعاصمة «أبديّة» لإسرائيل تُشكّل موضع جدل كبير في المجتمع الدولي، فعلى الرغم من أن بعض الدول فتحت قنصليات لها في المدينة، فإن جميع السفارات موجودة خارجها، ومعظمها في تل أبيب. وبسبب عدم الاعتراف بالقدس كعاصمة لإسرائيل، فإن معظم الصحف العالمية والمحلية تصف إعلانات الحكومة الإسرائيلية بأنها «صادرة عن تل أبيب».\nأصدر مجلس أمن الأمم المتحدة القرار رقم 478 بتاريخ 20 أغسطس سنة 1980، الذي نصّ على أن قانون الأساس الذي أصدرته إسرائيل واعتبرت فيه القدس عاصمة أبدية لها، قانونًا «فاسدًا باطلاً وينبغي إلغاؤه فورًا»، واقتُرح أن تقوم الدول الأعضاء في هذا المجلس بسحب كل هيئاتها الدبلوماسية من المدينة حتى تذعن إسرائيل للقرار الدولي، وقد استجابت معظم الدول ذات السفارات المتبقية في القدس لهذا الأمر، وقامت بنقل مراكز سفاراتها إلى تل أبيب، كما فعلت غيرها من الدول قبيل صدور القرار رقم 478، وكنتيجة لهذا الأمر، فرغت القدس من السفارات الأجنبية، لكن بعضًا منها اتخذ من إحدى ضواحيها، وهي «مڤاسرت صهيون»، مقرًا لها، كذلك استمرت 4 قنصليات موجودة بالمدينة. قرر الكونغرس الأمريكي نقل مقر السفارة الأمريكية من تل أبيب إلى القدس في سنة 1995، وذلك بعد إصدار «قانون السفارة في القدس» (بالإنگليزية: Jerusalem Embassy Act)، إلا أن بيل كلنتون، رئيس الولايات المتحدة آنذاك، استمر بتأجيل التوقيع على هذا القرار إلى أن انتهت ولايته، وعندها قال الرئيس الذي خلفه، وهو جورج بوش الابن، قال بأن قرارات الكونغرس المتعلقة بوضع القدس ليست إلزامية والهدف منها إبداء النصح والمشورة فقط، فلم يُقدم على توقيع القرار واستمرت السفارة الأمريكية موجودة في تل أبيب. قال أمين عام الأمم المتحدة، بان كي مون، في 28 أكتوبر سنة 2009، بأن القدس يجب أن تكون عاصمةً لكل من فلسطين وإسرائيل كي يتحقق السلام العادل والشامل.\n\nتقع في القدس أبرز المؤسسات الحكومية الإسرائيلية، بما فيها البرلمان أو الكنيست، والمحكمة العليا، والمقر الرسمي لرئيس الجمهورية ورئيس الوزراء. وقبيل إعلان قيام «دولة» إسرائيل، كانت القدس عاصمةً إدارية للأراضي الشاميّة الخاضعة للانتداب البريطاني، أي تلك التي تشمل اليوم أراضي السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل والأردن. كانت القدس الغربية عاصمةً لإسرائيل من سنة 1949 حتى سنة 1967، إلا أن دول العالم لم تعترف بهذا الأمر بما أن قرار الأمم المتحدة رقم 194 كان قد نصّ على تدويل المدينة. بعد أن خضعت المدينة بشطريها لإسرائيل بعد حرب سنة 1967، أعلنت حكومة ليڤي أشكول تطبيق القانون الإسرائيلي على القدس الشرقية وامتداد نطاق اختصاص القضاء الإسرائيلي إليها، لكنها وافقت على خضوع منطقة المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة لوزارة الأوقاف الأردنية. أمرت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقفال بيت الشرق، وهو مقرّ منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، في سنة 1988 لأسباب أمنيّة، وفي سنة 1992 أعيد افتتاح البيت بصفته مضافة. نصّت اتفاقية أوسلو على أن الوضع النهائي للقدس يجب أن يتحدد عن طريق مفاوضات مع السلطة الفلسطينية، التي تعتبر القدس الشرقية عاصمة لدولة فلسطينية مستقبلية، وقد قال الرئيس الفلسطيني محمود عبّاس أن أية مفاوضات لا تتضمن الاعتراف بالقدس الشرقية عاصمة لفلسطين ستكون غير مقبولة. في السادس من ديسمبر 2017 قرر الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب الاعتراف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل ونقل سفارة الولايات المتحدة إلى القدس.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nالقدس مدينة ذات أهمية دينية كبرى عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث: اليهود والمسيحيون والمسلمون. أظهرت إحدى الإحصائيات من سنة 2000 أن القدس تحوي حاليًا 1204 كنسات، 158 كنيسة، و73 مسجدًا، والبعض من دور العبادة هذه يُعتبر من بين أكثر المواقع تقديسًا عند أتباع هذه الديانة أو تلك، إن لم يكن أقدسها في بعض الأحيان، لذا فقد كان انتهاك حُرمة إحدى هذه الدور من بين الأسباب التي أدّت دومًا إلى حصول نزاعات كبيرة في المدينة والمنطقة ككل.\n\nفي الإسلام\nالقدس هي ثالث أقدس الأماكن عند المسلمين بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وكانت تمثّل قبلة الصلاة الإسلامية طيلة ما يُقارب من سنة، قبل أن تتحول القبلة إلى الكعبة في مكة. وقد أصبحت القدس مدينة ذات أهميّة دينية عند المسلمين بعد أن أسرى الملاك جبريل بالنبي محمد إليها، وفق المعتقد الإسلامي، قرابة سنة 620 حيث عرج من الصخرة المقدسة إلى السماوات العلى حيث قابل جميع الأنبياء والرسل الذين سبقوه وتلقّى من الله تعاليم الصلاة وكيفية أدائها. تنص سورة الإسراء أن محمدًا أُسري به من المسجد الحرام إلى «المسجد الأقصى»: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾؛ وقد أجمع المفسرون على أن المقصود بالمسجد الأقصى مدينة القدس ذاتها، وسُميت الأقصى لبعد المسافة بينها وبين المسجد الحرام، إذ لم يكن حين إذن فيها المسجد الأقصى الحالي. يقع اليوم معلمين إسلاميين في الموقع الذي عرج منه النبي محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم) إلى السماء، وهما قبة الصخرة التي تحوي الصخرة المقدسة، والمسجد الأقصى الذي بُني خلال العهد الأموي. ومما يجعل من القدس مدينة مهمة في الإسلام أيضًا، أن عددًا كبيرًا من الأنبياء والصالحين الذين يتشارك المسلمون وأهل الكتاب عمومًا بالإيمان بهم، مع اختلاف النظرة إليهم، حيث يعتبر المسلمون واليهود أن عدد منهم أنبياء أو رسل بينما ينظر المسيحيون إليهم بصفتهم قديسين، قطنوا المدينة عبر التاريخ أو عبروها، ومنهم داود وسليمان وزكريا ويحيى والمسيح عيسى بن مريم، وكذلك لذكر المدينة في القرآن بأنها وما حولها أراض مباركة شكّلت قبلة للأنبياء ومهبطًا للملائكة والوحي وأن الناس يُحشرون فيها يوم القيامة.\nأما عند الشيعة الإثنا عشرية فالمسجد الأقصى مكانه في السماء الرابعة وليس على الأرض فليس للمسجد الأقصى مكانة ذات أهمية لديهم، عن سلام الحناط، عن رجل، عن أبي عبد الله قال: سألته عن المساجد التي لها الفضل فقال: المسجد الحرام ومسجد الرسول، قلت: والمسجد الأقصى جعلت فداك؟ فقال: ذاك في السماء إليه أسري رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فقلت: إن الناس يقولون: إنه بيت المقدس؟ فقال: مسجد الكوفة أفضل منه.\n\nفي المسيحية\nيجلّ المسيحيون القدس لأسباب مختلفة، منها تاريخها الذي ورد ذكره في العهد القديم، إضافة إلى لعبها دورًا محوريًا في حياة يسوع المسيح. ينص العهد الجديد أن يسوع أُحضر إلى المدينة بعد ولادته بفترة قصيرة، وتذكر التقاليد المسيحية أنه قام لاحقًا بتطهير معبد حيرود من الأصنام الرومانية التي وضعها الملك حيرود داخله، وأنه قلب موائد الصيارفة وكراسي باعة الحمام ولم يدع أحدًا يجتاز الهيكل بمتاع.\nيؤمن البعض أن العليّة حيث تناول المسيح وتلاميذه العشاء الأخير، تقع على جبل صهيون في ذات المبنى حيث يقع ضريح الملك داود. ومن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة في المدينة أيضًا، التلّة المعروفة باسم «جلجثة»، وهي موقع صلب يسوع بحسب الإيمان المسيحي. يصف إنجيل يوحنا هذه التلّة بأنها تقع خارج القدس، إلا أن بعض الحفريات أظهرت مؤخرًا أنها تقع على بُعد مسافة قليلة من البلدة القديمة داخل حدود المدينة الحاليّة. أمّا أقدس الأماكن المسيحية في القدس فهي كنيسة القيامة، التي يحج إليها المسيحيون من مختلف أنحاء العالم منذ حوالي ألفيّ سنة، ويقول بعض الخبراء والمؤرخين أنها أكثر المواقع احتمالاً بأن تكون قد شُيدت على الجلجثة.\n\nفي اليهودية\nأصبحت المدينة مقدسة عند اليهود بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعلها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة في القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد. وكانت القدس تحوي الهيكل الذي بناه سليمان بن داود، الذي يسميه اليهود «هيكل سليمان»، بالإضافة إلى هيكل أو معبد حيرود الذي شُيّد في وقت لاحق بعد أن هُدم الهيكل الأوّل. ورد ذكر هذا الهيكل 632 مرّة في الكتاب المقدس، وما زال اليهود اليوم يتعبدون عند حائط البراق أو حائط المبكى، الذي يؤمنون بأنه كل ما تبقى من المعبد القديم، ويُشكل هذا الحائط ثاني أقدس الأماكن في اليهودية بعد «قدس الأقداس».\nتُبنى جميع الكنس في العالم ومحرابها يواجه القدس، أما محاريب كنس القدس فتواجه «قدس الأقداس». تنص التوراة الشفهية والشريعة اليهودية أن الصلاة يجب أن تتلى في اتجاه القدس وهيكل حيرود، والكثير من الأسر اليهودية تضع لويحة «مزراح» على إحدى جدران منزلها لتحديد قبلة الصلاة. ذُكرت القدس في التناخ 669 مرّة، وذُكر اسم «صهيون» التي يقصد بها اليهود المدينة تارة وفلسطين ككل تارة أخرى، 154 مرّة.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة بحد ذاتها إحدى المعالم التاريخية المقدسية. تبلغ مساحة القدس القديمة، ضمن الأسوار قرابة كيلومترًا مربعًا ويقع المسجد الأقصى في الناحية الشرقية من المدينة وأسوارها. وتقسم المدينة إلى حارات أو خطط، وفي هذه الأحياء أسواق محلية صغيرة استقلت عن الأسواق الرئيسة، وكانت الأحياء تضم مجموعات سكانية منسجمة في بيئتها الاجتماعية والدينية، وطرق المدينة القديمة متعرجة، غُطي بعضها بعقود، وقد تقوم منشآت أو امتدادات عالية للبيوت. ومن أهم هذه المنشآت المساجد والمآذن والمدارس، وإذا استثنيت قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، فإن أكثر المساجد والمآذن في القدس تعود إلى العصر المملوكي، مثل المئذنة الفخرية عام 1278، ومئذنة باب الغوانمة من عام 1329، ومئذنة باب الأسباط عام 1367. ومن المساجد هناك مسجد القلعة الذي بُني عام 1310، والمسجد القيمري عام 1276 وجامع الخانقاة الصلاحية، وتعود مئذنته إلى عام 1395. ومن المساجد التي بنيت في العهد العثماني مسجد النبي داود الذي أنشأه السلطان سليمان القانوني وهو مجمع معماري، ولقد حوّلته إسرائيل إلى كنيس وأزيلت الكتابات القرآنية منه واستبدلت بكتابة عبرية، وجامع المولوية المُشيّد سنة 1587 والمسجد القيمري.\nإن أكثر المباني الإسلامية في القدس هي المدارس التعليمية. حيث أن عدد المدارس والزوايا في القدس خلال القرن الحادي عشر الهجري كان 630 مدرسة، ومن أقدم المدارس المدرسة المنصورية التي أنشأها الملك المنصور قلاوون. وتمتاز عمارة المدارس بالفناء ذي البركة تشرف عليه الأواوين والغرف، أما الواجهة الجميلة التي تدخل منها إلى المدرسة من خلال دركاه، فهي من مميزات العمارة المملوكية، وإذا كانت المدارس المملوكية في القدس لم ترق إلى مستوى المدارس في القاهرة التي تميزت بالاتساع والفخامة كمدرسة السلطان حسن، فإنها مع ذلك تتمتع بالأناقة والبساطة والوحدة، ومن أهم المدارس المملوكية الباقية حتى اليوم: المدرسة السلامية (1300م)، المدرسة الجاولية (1320م)، المدرسة التنكزية (1329م)، المدرسة الأمينية (1330م)، المدرسة الملكية (1340م)، المدرسة الفارسية (1353م)، المدرسة الأرغونية (1356م)، المدرسة القشتمرية (1358م)، المدرسة المحدثية (1360م)، والمدرسة الطشتمرية (1384م). تشمل معالم القدس الحاليّة ما يلي:\n\nالثقافة\nتُعتبر القدس مدينةً تنصهر فيها دينيًا الثقافة في بوتقة واحدة، نظرًا لأهميتها الدينية ولعب الدين دورًا مهمًا في حياة سكانها من العرب والإسرائيليين، كما أن ثقافة سكان منطقة القدس شكلت جزءًا كبيرًا من هويتهم منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الحضر الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن معظم اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميّز في منطقة القدس ووسط الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى، حيث أن لمدينة القدس ثوبها الخاص، الذي يمتاز بأنه أكثر الأثواب الفلسطينية جمعًا لآثار كل العصور التي مرت على المدينة، فعلى الصدر توجد قبة ملكات الكنعانيون وعلى الجوانب تظهر طريقة التصليب منذ أيام الحكم الصليبي، كما ويظهر الهلال والآيات القرآنية كدليل على عودة القدس للحكم الإسلامي العربي. وبشكل عام فإن آثار النكبة تظهر علي الثوب الفلسطيني، إذ يظهر الحزن والحنين من خلال الألوان، من خلال اختفاء الألوان الزاهية مشيرة إلى أن ظهور تطريز الماكينة دليل على عدم اهتمام المرأة بالتطريز وعلى الوضع الاقتصادي السيئ.\nيُعتبر المتحف الإسرائيلي أحد أهم المواقع الثقافية بالمدينة، حيث يستقبل نحو مليون زائر سنويًا، يُشكل السيّاح ثلثهم. تصل مساحة مجمّع المتحف إلى 20 دونم (81,000 م2) وهو يضم عدد من المباني ذات المعارض المختلفة، حيث تُعرض أعمال فنيّة إسرائيلية وأوروبية، إضافة للعديد من المكتشفات الأثرية والمخطوطات اليهودية القديمة. وفي المتحف معلمٌ بارز هو صحن مائي يُعرف بصحن الكتاب، وهو يحوي مخطوطات البحر الميت التي اكتُشفت في أواسط القرن العشرين في كهوف خربة قمران بالقرب من البحر سالف الذكر. خُصصت إحدى أجنحة المتحف لتلقين الأطفال دروس في الرسم النحت، ويزور هذا الجناح قرابة 100,000 طفل في السنة، ولهذا المتحف حديقة خارجية مخصصة لعرض أعمال النحت، ومن أبرز المنحوتات فيها المنحوتة المصغرة لمعبد حيرود. ومن المتاحف الأخرى ذات الأهمية، متحف روكفلر في القدس الشرقية أو «متحف فلسطين للآثار» سابقا، الذي بُني أيام الانتداب البريطاني في سنة 1938، وهو يُعد أوّل متحف للآثار شُيّد في الشرق الأوسط. والذي تتخذه اليوم سلطة الآثار الإسرائيلية مقرا لها.\n\nتأوي القدس النصب التذكاري المعروف باسم نصب «ياد ڤاشيم» (بالعبرية: יד ושם)، المخصص لإحياء ذكرى اليهود الذين قضوا في المحرقة النازية، وهذا النصب مجمّع ذو أجنحة عديدة تُشكل أكبر أرشيف عالميّ لكل ما يتعلق بالمحرقة سالفة الذكر. من أبرز أجنحة المجمّع متحفًا فريدًا يعرض مواضيعًا مختلفة تتعلق بالإبادة الجماعية لليهود ويُركز على الروايات والقصص المتعلقة ببعض الأفراد والعائلات الذين قُتلوا آنذاك، كما يعرض مجموعة فنيّة من أعمال بعض الفنانين الذين قضوا نحبهم في المحرقة. يُحيي هذا النصب أيضًا ذكرى الأطفال اليهود الذين قتلهم النازيون بالإضافة إلى «الشرفاء من بين الأمم»، ويُقصد بهم الأشخاص غير اليهود الذين خاطروا بحياتهم خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية لإنقاذ أطفال اليهود من الإعدام. كذلك هناك جناحٌ يُطلق عليه تسمية «الجناح الموصول»، وهو يعرض أعمال فنيّة تمثل العيش المشترك بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، وهو يقع على الطريق الفاصلة بين القدس الشرقية والغربية.\n\nتتخذ عدّة مراق وفرق فنيّة من القدس مقرًا لها، ومن هذه الأوركسترا السمفونية المقدسيّة التي تأسست في عقد الأربعينات من القرن العشرين، بالإضافة إلى الأوركسترا الإسرائيلية التي تؤدي أعمالها الفنية في مركز المؤتمرات الدولية (بالعبرية: מרכז הקונגרסים הבינלאומי) الذي يقع بالقرب من مدخل القدس الغربيّة، وأيضًا المركز الموسيقي في القدس، الواقع حي «يمين موشيه»، وغيرها. استضافت القدس «المهرجان الإسرائيلي» طيلة 25 عامًا، وهذا المهرجان يُقام سنويًا منذ سنة 1961 وتؤدى فيه عدّة أعمال مسرحية خارجية وداخلية بالإضافة لحفلات موسيقية لمغنين محليين وعالميين. يستضيف مسرح القدس في حارة الطالبية ما يزيد عن 150 حفلاً موسيقيًا في السنة، إلى جانب عروض مسرحية وراقصة لفنانين عالميين. وهناك أيضًا «مسرح خان» الذي يقع في الكاروانسرا مقابل محطة القطارات القديمة، وهو مسرح الذخائر الوحيد بالمدينة. ومن البرامج الثقافية الخاصة بالقدس، مهرجان القدس السينمائي، الذي تُعرض فيه أعمال سينمائية إسرائيلية وعالمية.\n\nتؤوي القدس بعض معارض اللوحات مثل «بيت تيخو»، في وسط المدينة، وهو منزل قديم تحوّل إلى متحف حاليًا، تُعرض فيه لوحات الفنانة «حنّة تيخو» المعروفة برسمها لتلال القدس، والمجموعات العبرانية لزوجها الذي كان يعمل كحالاً، وافتتح أول عيادة لطب العيون في القدس سنة 1912. كذلك هناك معرض الحوش، وهو معرض فني فلسطيني تأسس في سنة 2004 تُعرض فيه عدّة أعمال فنيّة لفنانين فلسطينيين.\n\nأعلنت القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية في سنة 2009. تُشكل المدينة مقرًا للمسرح الوطني الفلسطيني، الذي يعمل على الحفاظ على الثقافة والهويّة العربية والفلسطينية للقدس، بالإضافة لإجراء عدّة نشاطات تهدف إلى إحياء اهتمام الفلسطينيين بالفن. يرعى معهد إدوارد سعيد الوطني للموسيقى الأوركسترا الشبابية الفلسطينية، التي قامت بجولة فنيّة شملت دول الخليج العربي وغيرها من دول الشرق الأوسط في سنة 2009. يقع المتحف الإسلامي في القدس على متن الحرم القدسي الشريف، وقد تأسس هذا المتحف في سنة 1923، وهو يضم كثيرًا من القطع الأثرية الإسلامية، التي تتراوح من أدوات الكحل صغيرة الحجم والمخطوطات النادرة، إلى العواميد الرخامية الضخمة. حظرت إسرائيل احتفالات إعلان القدس عاصمةً للثقافة العربية بحجة أنها كانت برعاية السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وأقيم احتفال في بلدة بيت عنان عوضًا عن ذلك، وعلى مدى 4 أيام، وحضره ما يزيد عن 15,000 شخص.\nهناك عدد من المؤسسات والمنظمات اللاربحيّة في القدس، التي تسعى للتقريب بين السكان من العرب والإسرائيليين، ومن شاكلة هذه المنظمات: «الصندوق الإبراهيمي» و«مركز التبادل الثقافي المقدسي»، الذان يُشجعان على القيام بمشاريع ثقافية مشتركة بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، كذلك «مركز القدس للموسيقى والرقص الشرقي» الذي يُخصص حلقات عمل للإسرائيليين والعرب على حد سواء، ويهدف إلى تعزيز لغة الحوار والتواصل بين الطرفين عن طريق تشجيعهم على القيام بأعمال فنيّة مشتركة، أيضًا هناك الأوركسترا اليهودية العربية الشبابيّة، التي تؤدي عروض موسيقية تقليدية أوروبية وشرق أوسطيّة. قام الفنان البولندي «تشيسلاو دزاڤيگاي» بصنع منحوتة تمثّل التعايش السلمي الذي يُطمح إليه بين الفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين، وأطلق عليه «نصب التسامح» ونُصب في سنة 2008 على تلة فاصلة بين مستوطنة تلبيوت الشرقية وجبل المكبر، كعلامة على نضال المقدسيين في سبيل الحصول على السلام.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكان الحج إلى القدس يُشكل أبرز مواردها المالية عبر التاريخ، بما أنها مدينة داخلية تقع بعيدًا عن المرافئ الهامّة مثل يافا وغزة. لا تزال المعالم الدينية في القدس هي ما يستقطب الزوّار الأجانب بشكل رئيسي، حيث أن معظمهم يأتي ليزور حائط البراق وكنيسة القيامة والمسجد الأقصى، وغيرها من الأماكن في البلدة القديمة، إلا أنه أصبح من الجليّ خلال نصف القرن الفائت أن المدينة لا يمكنها أن تعتمد على هذه الزيارات وحدها لتؤمن مدخولاً كافيًا يفي بجميع الحاجات الحياتية للسكان.\nتُظهر عدّة إحصائيات أن اقتصاد المدينة في نمو مطّرد، إلا أنه من الملاحظ بأن القدس الشرقية لا تزال أقل نموًا من الغربية، لكن على الرغم من ذلك فإن نسبة الأسر العربية التي يعمل عدد من أفرادها أعلى من تلك الخاصة بالأسر اليهودية، حيث تصل الأولى إلى 76.1% والثانية إلى 66.8%. يصل معدّل البطالة في القدس إلى 8.3%، وهو بهذا أقل من المعدّل الوطني الإسرائيلي الذي يصل إلى 9.0%، على الرغم من أن نسبة القوّة العاملة بالمدينة أقل من تلك الخاصة بمدن أخرى مثل تل أبيب (58.0%) وحيفا (52.4%). أظهرت دراسات أخرى أن نسبة الفقر بالقدس ارتفعت بشكل ملحوظ خلال الفترة الممتدة من سنة 2001 حتى سنة 2007، حيث ازدادت نسبة السكان الذين يعيشون تحت خط الفقر بحوالي 40%. وصل معدّل المدخول الشهري للعامل في القدس خلال سنة 2006 إلى 5,940 شيكل جديد (1,410 دولار أمريكي)، أي أقل بحوالي 1,350 شيكل من العامل في تل أبيب.\n\nأصدرت السلطات البريطانية قانونًا أيام الانتداب ينص على عدم جواز تشييد المباني إلا باستخدام الحجر المقدسي، وذلك في سبيل الحفاظ على الهويّة التاريخية وجماليّة هذه المدينة الفريدة، وما زال هذا القانون ساري المفعول حتى الوقت الحالي، وهناك جهود لتكملته عن طريق عدم التشجيع على بناء المصانع داخل القدس؛ وقد خصصت السلطات الإسرائيلية 2.2% فقط من مساحة المدينة لتشييد المصانع، وبالمقابل يُلاحظ أن نسبة الأراضي المخصصة للبنى التحتية في تل أبيب تفوق تلك الخاصة بالقدس بحوالي الضعف، بينما تفوق نسبة تلك الأراضي في حيفا نسبة أراضي القدس بحوالي سبعة مرّات. يعمل ما نسبته 8.5% من إجمالي القوة العاملة الخاصة بمحافظة القدس في قطاع الصناعة، وهذا يُشكل نصف المعدل الوطني في إسرائيل (15.8%)، بالمقابل تفوق نسبة المقدسيين العاملين في قطاعات أخرى باقي المعدلات الوطنية. قامت بضعة شركات التقنية العالية بفتح فروع لها أو نقل مراكزها حتى من تل أبيب إلى القدس، وقد أدّى مثل هذا الأمر إلى توفير 12,000 فرصة عمل جديدة في سنة 2006. من المراكز الاقتصادية المهمة في القدس ما يُعرف باسم «مجمّع الصناعات العلمية الغنيّة»، وهو مجمّع يقع في شمال المدينة ويُشكل مقرًا لبعض أهم الشركات مثل: إنتل، شركة تيڤا لصناعة الأدوية، أتوترونكس عوفير، وشركة ECI للاتصالات. يُخطط بعض المسؤولين لتوسعة هذا المجمّع حتى يُغطي مساحة 530,000 متر مربّع (130 فدّان)، ويتسع لمزيد من الشركات بالإضافة لمحطة إطفاء ومدرسة.\nلعبت الحكومة الإسرائيلية دورًا كبيرًا في تنمية اقتصاد القدس منذ تأسيس «دولة» إسرائيل، فهناك عدد كبير من الوظائف الحكومية الشاغرة بالمدينة، كونها مقر للحكومة، والأخيرة تقدم دعمًا وحوافز متعددة للشركات والمؤسسات الوليدة، كي تستمر متمركزة بالقدس. أفادت مجلة «السياحة والترفيه» (بالإنجليزية: Travel + Leisure) الأمريكية أن القدس هي أفضل مدن أفريقيا والشرق الأوسط للسياحة الترفيهية في سنة 2010.\nيقول الخبراء أن اقتصاد القدس الشرقية لا يزال يُعاني من مشاكل وعوائق مختلفة لأسباب عديدة، منها جدار الفصل العازل الذي شيدته إسرائيل في عمق الضفة الغربية وفي محيط مدينة القدس، الأمر الذي يؤدي إلى إخراج مدينة القدس من ارتباطها ببقية الأراضي الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، والذي يجعلها مفتوحة فقط نحو إسرائيل، بالإضافة لإقامة الحواجز العسكرية وإعاقة دخول سكان القرى المجاورة للقدس، وباقي سكان المدن الفلسطينية مع ارتفاع تكلفة نقل البضائع نتيجة الحواجز والإغلاق. وحسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية في آخر دراسة أعدتها في شهر يوليو من سنة 2006 فإنّ مدينة القدس كانت بحاجة إلى استثمارات فورية تقارب المئة وخمسون مليون دولار كنقطة بداية كاستثمارات فورية خلال الأعوام الثلاثة القادمة، وتشمل هذه الاستثمارات مجالات الإسكان السياحة وترميم البلدة القديمة، وتطوير الصناعات الحرفية في المدينة.\n\nومن الصعوبات التي تواجه هذا الشطر من المدينة وتعيق نموّه بشكل مطّرد التشدد في فرض الضرائب وجبايتها وتطبيق باقي القوانين الاقتصادية والاجتماعية على العرب الفلسطينيين في القدس. كذلك يقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن هنالك تشدّد في منع دخول المنتجات الفلسطينية إلى أسواق القدس، خصوصاً المنتجات الغذائية كالألبان البيض وهي منتجات أقلّ سعراً من المنتجات الإسرائيلية المماثلة.\nوقد أدّت القيود والإجراءات الإسرائيلية إلى تراجع الأداء الاقتصادي للقدس الشرقية في مختلف القطاعات، فقد اضطر عدد من المصانع إلى تقليص إنتاجها أو إغلاق مصانعها بسبب انخفاض الطلب على المنتجات المحلية غير الغذائية منها إلى الثلث وضعف إمكانية المنتج المحلي على المنافسة نتيجة لارتفاع تكاليف التوزيع بسبب الإغلاق، كذلك ظهر أنه في شهر أكتوبر من سنة 2000 انقطع التدفّق السياحي إلى الشطر الشرقي، وألغيت جميع الحجوزات حتى نهاية سنة 2001، فكان من نتيجة ذلك أن أغلقت بضعة فنادق أبوابها وسرّحت موظفيها.\n\nيقول مدير الغرفة التجارية في القدس الشرقية، عزّام أبو السعود، أنّ موضوع الاستثمار، وبوجه الخصوص الاستثمار طويل المدى، أو الذي يستغرق إقامة منشآته عدة سنوات، والبحث عن مستثمرين، هو العنصر الذي يجب التركيز عليه في سبيل النهوض باقتصاد القدس الشرقية، ودعا إلى إنشاء صندوق ضمان الاستثمار، الذي يضمن للمستثمر الخائف عائدًا مناسبًا لأمواله، وضمانات أن لا يؤثّر الوضع الأمني السياسي على مشروعه، وضمان عائد مجدي لاستثماره، كذلك دعا إلى عدم إغفال موضوع التدريب واقتباس النموذج الألماني في التدريب الحرفي، كونه النموذج الذي قاد الألمان لإعادة بناء اقتصادهم الذي دمرته الحرب العالمية الثانية. وقال أنه يجب أن يتم إحياء مشروع سوق القطّانين بالبلدة القديمة، وكذلك الحمامات المملوكية أو التركية بعد ترميمها. هذا بالإضافة إلى تحويل جزء من الاستثمار إلى قطاع الإسكان والإنشاءات لتوفير المنازل الكافية لبقاء أكبر عدد من سكان القدس. والاهتمام الأكبر بترميم منازل البلدة القديمة، وأنْ يشمل المنازل القديمة خارج السور وذلك لتوفير نوعية حياة أفضل للسكان. وفي سنة 2010، أعلن المهندس مازن سنقرط رئيس مجموعة سنقرط الاستثمارية عن تأسيس شركة قابضة في القدس تحمل اسم«القدس القابضة» برأسمال 20 مليون دولار بهدف الاستثمار في عدد من القطاعات الاقتصادية والتعليمية في القدس الشرقية.\n\nالمواصلات\nيُعتبر مطار القدس الدولي أقرب المطارات إلى القدس، وقد كان يُستخدم للطيران المدني حتى أغلقته السلطات الإسرائيلية في سنة 2001، وسيطر عليه الجيش الإسرائيلي لقمع الانتفاضة التي قامت في وجه إسرائيل في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة. تحوّلت جميع الرحلات الجويّة بعد إغلاق المطار إلى مطار بن غوريون الدولي، وهو أكبر مطارات إسرائيل وأكثرها ازدحامًا، حيث يصل عدد المسافرين فيه سنويًا إلى 9 ملايين مسافر.\nتتولى شركة «إيگد» التعاونية، وهي ثاني أكبر شركة نقل بالحفلات في العالم، تقديم خدمة النقل للسكّان من وإلى القدس، وبداخلها، وهي تتمركز في محطة حافلات المدينة الواقعة في شارع يافا بالقرب من مدخل الطريق السريع الغربي للقدس. كانت الحافلات وسيارات الأجرة والسيارات الخصوصية هي وسائل النقل الأكثر استعمالاً في القدس حتى سنة 2008، عندما أُطلق مشروع سكة الحديد الخفيفة، وابتُدئ العمل فيه على قدم وساق. يقول المهندسون العاملون على المشروع، أن هذه القاطرات ستقدم خدمة النقل لحوالي 200,000 شخص يوميًا، وسيكون لها 24 محطة. انتهى العمل على هذه السكّة في 15 يونيو سنة 2010، وتمت تجربة القاطرة الأولى في 23 أغسطس من نفس العام.\n\nمن المشاريع الأخرى التي تنوي إسرائيل تنفيذها بالقدس، مشروع سكة حديدية سريعة تمتد من تل أبيب إلى القدس، يُخطط الانتهاء من العمل عليها في سنة 2011، وستكون محطتها الأخيرة محطةً تحتأرضيّة على عمق 80 مترًا (262.47 قدمًا)، تقع بالقرب من مركز المؤتمرات الدولية ومحطة الحافلات، ويهدف المسؤولون إلى وصل هذه السكة في نهاية المطاف بمحطة المالحة، وهي محطة القطارات المملوكة من قبل الدولة، والتي تقدم خدمة النقل من القدس إلى تل أبيب مرورًا بمدينة بيت شيمش.\nتُعتبر طريق مناحيم بيگن السريعة إحدى أبرز طرق القدس التي تصل شمالها بجنوبها؛ فهي تمتد على طول القسم الغربي من القدس وتتصل بطريق «معاليه بيت حورون» في الشمال لتكمل اتجاهها نحو تل أبيب. يمتد الطريق السريع رقم 60 عبر وسط المدينة بالقرب من الخط الأخضر الفاصل بين القدس الشرقية والغربية. يجري العمل حاليًا على تشييد طريق تحيط بالمدينة يبلغ طولها 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) لتصل الضواحي ببعضها البعض، لكن ردود الفعل حول هذا المشروع جاءت متناقضة حيث عارضه البعض وقبله البعض الآخر.\n\nالتعليم\nتتخذ عدّة جامعات مرموقة من القدس مقرًا لها، وتؤمّن برامج تعليمية للطلاّب باللغات العربية، العبرية، والإنگليزية، ومن هذه الجامعات الجامعة العبرية التي تأسست في سنة 1925، وتُعتبر حاليًا من بين أفضل 100 مؤسسة تعليمية في العالم. كان بعض أبرز العقول المفكرة في العالم أعضاءً في مجلس أمناء هذه الجامعة، ومنهم ألبرت أينشتاين وسيگموند فرويد، وقد تخرّج منها بعض الفائزين بجوائز نوبل مثل: أڤرام هيرشكو، داود گروس، ودانيال كاهنمان. تشتهر الجامعة العبرية بمكتبتها المعروفة بالمكتبة اليهودية، التي يُحتفظ فيها بأكثر من 5 ملايين كتاب. افتتحت هذه المكتبة في سنة 1892، أي قبل افتتاح الجامعة ذاتها بحوالي ثلاثة عقود، وهي اليوم المكتبة المركزية للجامعة ومكتبة إسرائيل الوطنية. للجامعة العبرية 3 أحرام جامعيّة في القدس: على جبل المشارف، تلة الشيخ بدر، وحرم طبيّ في مستشفى حداثة بعين كارم.\nتأسست جامعة القدس المفتوحة في سنة 1984 لتكون جامعة رائدة لسكّان القدس العرب، وتصف الجامعة نفسها على أنها «الجامعة العربية الوحيدة في القدس». تعاونت جامعة القدس المفتوحة وكليّة بارد من نيويورك على افتتاح كليّة مشتركة في ذات المبنى الذي كان يُشكل مقر المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني حيث كان يقع مكتب الرئيس الفلسطيني ياسر عرفات، وذلك في خريف سنة 2010، ومن المقرر إنشاء برنامج دراسي لمنح درجة ماجستير تدريس الآداب. يقع الحرم الرئيسي لهذه الجامعة جنوب شرقي القدس في بلدة أبو ديس، وتبلغ مساحته 190,000 متر مربّع (47 فدّان). ومن مؤسسات التعليم العالي الأخرى في المدينة: أكاديمية القدس لتعليم الموسيقى والرقص، وأكاديمية بيتسالئيل للفنون والتصميم، وكلا المبنيين يقعان في حرم الجامعة العبرية.\n\nتأسست كليّة القدس للعلوم التقنية في سنة 1969، وهي تؤمن برامج تدريب هندسية وتقنية للطلاّب، وهذه الكليّة هي إحدى المدارس التي تجمع بين البرامج العلمانية والدينيّة في القدس الغربية، وفي الشطر الأخير من المدينة عدد من المدارس الدينية اليهودية مثل «مدرسة صموئيل» و«مدرسة مير يشيڤا»، التي يُزعم أنها أكبرها. وصل عدد التلاميذ في السنة الدراسية الأخيرة في المدارس اليهودية خلال العام الدراسي 2003–2004 إلى 8,000 تلميذ، إلا أن 55% من هؤلاء فقط يتقدمون لامتحان شهادة الثانوية العامة، أما الباقون فيلتحقون بالمعاهد المهنية الحريدية. تُقدّم بلديّة القدس حوافزًا مالية في سبيل استقطاب المزيد من التلاميذ اليهود إلى الجامعات الإسرائيلية في القدس، بالإضافة إلى إعانات لأولئك الذين يستأجرون شققًا سكنية للإقامة فيها طيلة مدة دراستهم.\n\nتسعى المؤسسات الإسرائيلية المختلفة وبدعم من الحكومة من أجل تحقيق سيطرة مطلقة على قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، وذلك بعد أن تمّ التحكم بنحو 66% من قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينة القدس، حيث تم فرض المناهج التعليمية على المدارس الابتدائية العربية هناك منذ عام 1968، وتبعًا لذلك تم استبدال كلمة «فلسطين» بكلمة «إسرائيل» و«القدس» بكلمة «أورشليم القدس». ويقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون أن الحكومة الإسرائيلية تحاول التضييق على الطلبة العرب في مدينة القدس لإجبارهم على ترك المدينة للاستئثار بخيارات التعليم، الأمر الذي يعرضهم للانتقال من مدينة القدس وفقًا لما تنص عليه القوانين الإسرائيلية. يُعاني معظم الطلاّب العرب في القدس من عوائق ومشاكل عديدة من جراء السياسات الإسرائيلية، فثمة اكتظاظ شديد في الصفوف المدرسية والدوام في غالبية المدارس على فترتين، وهناك نقص حاد وكبير في المختبرات في المدارس العربية في القدس، ناهيك عن ضعف التجهيزات الرياضية وكذلك النقص الواضح للمعلمين والخدمات، والملاحظ أيضًا أن المدارس غير مؤهلة للتدريس الجيد بسبب قدمها وعدم القيام بعملية تحديث ضرورية. ونظرًا لهذه الأسباب وصلت نسبة تسرب الطلبة العرب في القدس قبل الوصول إلى المرحلة الثانوية إلى نحو 50% خلال العقد الأول من القرن الحادي والعشرين، كما تشير إحدى الدراسات، وقد أدّى هذا إلى هجرة لطلاّب وأسر كاملة إلى مدن وقرى الضفة الغربية للبحث عن فرص تعليم مجانية. يلتحق البعض من المقدسيين العرب بالمدارس الإسرائيلية، لكن هؤلاء يتبعون في غالبيتهم إدارات وسياسات إما البلدية أو وزارة المعارف الإسرائيلية، التي تهدف إلى «تعميق المفاهيم الصهيونية، وضرب الانتماء الفلسطيني، من خلال حصص تعليمية عن الهوية اليهودية والتراث اليهودي الصهيوني، وربط الهبات والمكافآت للمدارس بنسبة التجنيد للجيش أو الخدمة المدنية والعسكرية، إلى جانب معايير أخرى».\nأطلقت ملكة الأردن رانيا العبد الله مبادرة «مدرستي فلسطين» وذلك لدعم التعليم وتحسين البيئة التعليمية في مدارس القدس العربية، «لا لأن للأردن علاقة بالقدس ودورًا تاريخيًا فقط ولكن لأن القدس مسؤولية كل عربي أولاً واخيرًا» على حد تعبيرها. من أبرز المؤسسات التعليمية في القدس الشرقية، المركز المعروف باسم «المركز التربوي لتطوير العاملين في حقل التعليم في القدس»، الذي يُعتبر المركز الوحيد التي يقدم الخدمات لمعلمي شرقي القدس. يرى المركز نفسه كمحور تربوي يُقدم الخدمات لجهاز التعليم بكل ما لديه من موارد وإمكانات.\n\nالرياضة\nتعتبر كل من كرة القدم وكرة السلة، اللعبتان الأكثر شعبية في مدينة القدس، سواء عند العرب أو اليهود. يعتبر نادي جبل المكبر (المؤسس في 1976) من أشهر الأندية المقدسية والذي يلعب بالدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز بالضفة الغربية، والذي هو عضو في الاتحاد الآسيوي لكرة القدم، ويتخذ من ملعب فيصل الحسيني مركزًا له، والذي يقع في الرام شمال القدس. من جهة أخرى، يعتبر كل من نادي بيتار القدس ونادي هابويل القدس من أكثر الأندية شهرة في إسرائيل، ويتخذان أيضًا من ملاعب القدس مركزًا لهما. من الأندية الفلسطينية الأخرى في القدس: هلال القدس، العربي بيت صفافا، الأنصار المقدسي، دي لاسال، أهلي القدس، جبل الزيتون، إسلامي سلوان، أبناء القدس، أرثوذكسي القدس، وغيرها.\nعرفت الرياضة النسوية الفلسطينية نهوضًا ملحوظًا في القدس منذ أن تولى اللواء جبريل الرجوب رئاسة اتحاد الكرة الفلسطينية واللجنة الأولمبية الفلسطينية، وقد تأسس فريق كرة القدم النسائية الأول بالمدينة حوالي سنة 2008، وواجه وما زال مشكلات كبيرة وهي النقص الحاد في الدعم المادي وحتى المعنوي، لكنه استطاع أن يصبح من الأندية المعروفة على الرغم من ذلك.\nيقام في القدس سنويًا، سباق جري سنوي نصفي، حيث يركض المتسابقون من كل أنحاء العالم متنافسين في جولة حول أشهر معالم المدينة. بالإضافة إلى هذا السباق النصفي ذو 21.1 كم، يمكن للمشاركين الركض مسافة 10 كم. كل من المسارين يبدأ وينتهي عند تلة الشيخ بدر أو «گفعات رام».\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من القدس عددٌ من المشاهير، من عرب وإسرائيليين، ومنهم:\n\nالعرب\nمحمد كامل البديري، مفوض مقاطعة رام الله خلال العهد العثماني ومؤسس جريدة الصباح.\nمبارك عوّاد، عالم نفس فلسطيني أمريكي، لجأ إلى القدس الشرقية عند قيام «دولة» إسرائيل ورفض الجنسية الإسرائيلية عند عرضها عليه.\nابتسام بركات، كاتبة وشاعرة ومربية فلسطينية أمريكية. نشرت مذكرات طفولتها تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي بعنوان «تذوّق السماء: طفولة فلسطينية»، في سنة 2007 فحازت على إعجاب الناس وفازت بعدّة جوائز.\nمصطفى البرغوثي، ناشط سلمي فلسطيني، رُشّح لرئاسة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في سنة 2005، لكنه خسر لصالح محمود عباس.\nجمال الدجاني، صحافي فلسطيني أمريكي ومنتج برامج تلفزيونية فائز بعدد من الجوائز.\nوليد خالدي، مؤرخ فلسطيني خرّيج جامعة أوكسفورد، يتحدث في أغلب مؤلفاته عن تهجير الفلسطينيين، وهو أحد مؤسسي الجمعية

          "summary": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.",

Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.\n\nMentions antiques, étymologie, autres noms\nMentions dans les textes antiques\nJérusalem est mentionnée pour la première fois dans des textes égyptiens dits « d'exécration » datant des XXe et XIXe siècles av. J.-C., période durant laquelle Canaan est vassal de l'Égypte pharaonique. La prononciation exacte de son nom ne ressort pas clairement des hiéroglyphes : on trouve Rushalimu, Urushalimu ou d'autres variantes.\nPar la suite, le nom de Jérusalem (Yeroushalayim) apparaît dans la Bible hébraïque, dans des textes grecs (dont le Nouveau Testament chrétien) et dans des textes latins, païens ou chrétiens. [réf. nécessaire]\n\nÉtymologies proposées par les spécialistes\nOn peut supposer[réf. nécessaire] que le nom de la ville évoque le culte du dieu Shalim (ou Shalimu), car il était courant alors d'appeler les cités du nom de la divinité locale. Le nom de « Jérusalem » renvoie donc probablement au culte de ce dieu cananéen, populaire dans le panthéon ouest-sémitique, divinité de la création, de l'exhaustivité[pas clair] et du soleil couchant. Le début du mot « Jérusalem » vient de uru, qui signifie « fondation » ou « ville fondée par », le sens primitif du nom est donc « ville fondée par Shalem » ou « sous la protection de Shalem ».\nUne étymologie détaillée a été donnée en 1859 par Nathaniel Philippe Sander et Isaac Léon Trenel : le nom de « Yeru-Shalem » provient selon eux de deux racines chaldéennes, YeRu (« ville », « demeure ») et ShLM, qui a donné les mots shalom en hébreu et salaam en arabe. Cette racine trilitère ShLM signifie aujourd'hui « paix », mais le sens initial était celui de la complétude, de l'achèvement, d'où dérive ultérieurement la notion de paix.\n\nChangements de nom sous l'Empire romain\nEn 130 après J.-C., l'empereur Hadrien donne à Jérusalem le nom romain d'« AElia Capitolina », Aelius étant le nom de gens d'Hadrien et Capitolinus en hommage au dieu Jupiter capitolin et procède à une refondation rituelle de la ville. Le nom couramment utilisé est Aelia.\nDevenue païenne, elle est la seule ville de l'Empire romain à être interdite aux Juifs, mesure qui reste en vigueur jusqu'à la conquête musulmane (638).\nEn 325, l'empereur Constantin lui rend son nom, mais la christianise.\n\nAprès la conquête musulmane (638)\nAprès la conquête de la région par l'armée musulmane du calife Omar en 638, elle devient en arabe Iliya (إلياء) ou Bayt al-Maqdis (« Maison du Sanctuaire »), équivalent de l'hébreu Beit ha-Mikdash (« Maison sainte »), expressions désignant le temple de Jérusalem ou la mosquée al-Aqsa (الاقصى), lieu du départ de l'ascension de Mahomet, située sur l'emplacement du temple juif détruit en 70.\n\nHistoire\nLa frise chronologique ci-dessous présente la succession des principales puissances ou dynasties qui ont administré Jérusalem.\n\nGéographie\nTopographie\nJérusalem, couvrant 126 km2, est localisée entre la mer Méditerranée (à 52 km) et la mer Morte (à 22 km), sur l'extrémité d'un plateau calcaire des monts de Judée (dont le mont Sion) à 745 m d’altitude moyenne, avec de fortes variations entre monts et vallées (de 700 à 800 m environ). Le mont Scopus culmine à 826 m au nord-est et la vallée du Cédron descend sous les 600 m.\n\nMonts\nLe point le plus élevé est le mont Herzl à l'ouest, avec 834 m.\nLes sept collines de Jérusalem sont une région vallonnée des montagnes de Judée, dont les longues extensions se poursuivent vers la plaine côtière à l'ouest et la vallée du Jourdain à l'est. En leur centre, Jérusalem est construite à quelque 700 mètres d'altitude sur cette série de collines : l'Ophel avec les monts Moriah, Herzl (הר הרצל) à l'ouest, des Oliviers (har HaZeitim) s'étendant sur plus de trois kilomètres avec les monts Sion, Scopus (הַר הַצּוֹפִים, har HaTsofim) au nord-est… Ces collines lui ont servi de défense naturelle par le passé et ont joué un rôle dans son développement au cours des siècles. Elles figurent actuellement des sortes de frontières invisibles entre les divers quartiers de Jérusalem.\n\nVallées\nLa cité est entourée de toutes parts de plusieurs vallées, parmi lesquelles celles au nord, proches du plateau, sont moins prononcées que celles situées dans les autres directions. Les deux principales se trouvent au nord-ouest de la ville actuelle.\nÀ l'est de l'ancien Temple, la vallée de Josaphat descend une partie de la ville pour devenir vallée du Cédron (nahal Kidron, נחל קדרון) ; elle sépare la Vieille ville du mont des Oliviers. La vallée Beth Zeita part du nord de la vieille ville actuelle et suit presque en parallèle la vallée du Cédron qu'elle rejoint au pied de l'extrémité nord-est de l'esplanade du Temple ; on y trouve des piscines (de Bethesda, d'Israël) alimentées par les pluies que charrie la vallée. À l'ouest, se trouve l'étroite vallée de la Géhenne (Guei Hinnom, גיא הנום) qui débute près de la porte de Jaffa où ici, elle prend parfois le nom de « vallée de Mamilla », se poursuit vers le sud puis bifurque vers l'est pour rejoindre la vallée transversale (débutant vers la porte de Jaffa et allant d'est en ouest) et celle de Kidron. Entre Kidron et Hinnom, et à l'ouest du mont Moriah, la fine vallée transversale du Tyropéon qui a été en partie comblée (et en partie par l'actuelle rue King David), commence au nord de la porte de Damas, entre dans la Vieille ville et continue sa route pour rencontrer la vallée latérale jusqu'à la Porte des Maghrébins (dite aussi « des Immondices »). Ces trois grandes vallées se rejoignent au sud de l'Ophel, notamment au niveau de l'actuelle piscine de Siloé, pour s'unir en Cédron qui s'élargit et poursuit sa course plus loin au sud-est, vers le désert de Judée et la mer Morte.\n\nClimat\nJérusalem possède un climat méditerranéen et dans une moindre mesure montagnard. Il est marqué par une forte chaleur et une forte aridité en été. Seuls quelques mois en hiver sont humides, en particulier février, où tombe plus de la moitié des précipitations totales annuelles. La neige survient une année sur trois, particulièrement en février ; certaines tempêtes ont fait beaucoup de dégâts, notamment en janvier 1992, avec 50 cm de neige, et en 1920, avec 97 cm.\n\nUrbanisme\nDémographie\nOn appelle Hiérosolymitains les habitants de Jérusalem.\nEn 1947, il y a 205 000 habitants dont 105 000 Arabes (51 %) et 100 000 Juifs (49 %) et autres dans le territoire incluant Jérusalem et les villes et villages proches dont Ein Kerem, Abu Dis, Bethléem et Shuafat. En 1967, il y a 263 307 habitants dont 195 700 Juifs (74 %) et 54 963 Arabes (21 %). En 2004, on compte 706 000 habitants dont 458 000 Juifs (65 %) (dont 200 000 à l’est) et 225 000 Arabes (32 %). En 2022, 59,4 % des habitants de Jérusalem sont juifs, 37,7 % musulmans et 1,3 % chrétiens.\nLa population chrétienne de Jérusalem est actuellement d'environ 16 000 personnes, soit moins de deux pour cent de la population de la ville, alors qu'elle représentait un quart de la population un siècle plus tôt.\nEn 2005, le taux de fécondité des populations juives et arabes de Jérusalem est identique pour la première fois avec 3,9 enfants par femme — conséquence de la baisse significative de la natalité arabe enregistrée depuis quelques années. Depuis cette date, la fécondité des populations juives (4,4 enfants par femme en 2022) a même largement dépassé celle des populations musulmanes (2,9 enfants par femme en 2022).\nUn autre aspect démographique est le déficit migratoire de la ville, puisque chaque année, les habitants quittant la ville sont de 6 000 ou 7 000 plus nombreux que ceux qui viennent s'y installer. La majorité part habiter dans la proche banlieue de Jérusalem où les coûts du logement sont nettement inférieurs.\n\nLa ville « trois fois sainte »\nLa ville de Jérusalem est considérée comme « trois fois sainte » car il s'y trouve les lieux les plus sacrés des religions juive et chrétienne et le troisième lieu saint de l'islam. Au total, on dénombre 56 lieux saints et une centaine d'autres de moindre importance, en majorité situés à Jérusalem-Est.\nLes trois lieux saints les plus célèbres sont :\n\nle mur, vestige du temple d'Hérode, appelé « mur occidental » par les juifs (HaKotel HaMa'aravi, en abrégé HaKotel) et « mur des Lamentations » par les chrétiens ;\nl'église du Saint-Sépulcre où est situé, selon la tradition chrétienne, le tombeau du Christ ;\nle mont du Temple, jadis site du temple de Jérusalem disparu et où se trouve aujourd'hui l'esplanade des Mosquées, (Haram al-Sharif[pas clair]) avec le dôme du Rocher et la mosquée al-Aqsa.\nJérusalem est donc un site exceptionnel pour les trois religions monothéistes.\n\nPour les Juifs\nJérusalem est importante pour les juifs depuis plus de 3 000 ans. Son nom est mentionné dans la Bible hébraïque 660 fois sous la forme habituelle et 158 fois sous la forme « Sion », nom d'une colline de Jérusalem employé métonymiquement pour la ville entière.\nJérusalem est en effet à la fois un lieu important dans les pérégrinations des patriarches racontées dans la Bible ; la capitale politique du royaume d'Israël de David et de Salomon, puis celle du royaume de Juda, plus tard celle du royaume hasmonéen ; le lieu de culte unique du Dieu unique, jusqu'à la destruction du temple de Jérusalem par les Romains.\nC'est à Jérusalem exclusivement que le culte officiel (notamment sous la forme de sacrifices effectués par les prêtres) avait lieu à l'époque des deux temples. Depuis la destruction de 70, il n'y a plus de sacrifices dans le judaïsme, le culte s'est totalement transformé avec l'apparition des synagogues.\nAprès la destruction du temple de Jérusalem en 587 av. J.-C. par Nabuchodonosor, durant l'exil à Babylone (en Mésopotamie) qui a suivi, le psaume 137 évoque fortement Jérusalem (« Si je t'oublie, Jérusalem, que ma main se dessèche... »). Dans ce cas, le retour a pu avoir lieu à la suite de la conquête perse et le temple a pu être reconstruit. Mais après la destruction effectuée en 70 sur ordre de l'empereur Vespasien, les juifs subissent une dispersion (« exil de Rome ») dans tout l'Empire romain. L'identité juive, constamment et intimement liée au souvenir de Jérusalem, la « fille de Sion », se maintient grâce à la transmission de l'héritage biblique et historique enseigné de génération en génération dans les communautés juives, jusqu'à l'apparition du mouvement sioniste à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nC'est à Jérusalem que, selon les textes, les Juifs devront attendre l'arrivée du Messie.\nDu temple de Jérusalem, il ne reste aujourd'hui debout qu'un mur de soutènement (kotel) couramment appelé mur des Lamentations, vestige du temple d'Hérode, devenu un lieu de prières juives, adossé au mont du Temple, devenu un haut lieu de l'islam (Esplanade des Mosquées.\nJérusalem est un lieu de pèlerinage à l'occasion des trois fêtes de pèlerinage (Pessa'h/Pâque, Chavouot, Souccot). Durant la Pâque juive, les mots « L’an prochain à Jérusalem » sont prononcés à la fin de chaque cérémonie.\nAprès chaque repas, la prière du Birkat HaMazon (bénédiction de la nourriture) mentionne Jérusalem.\n\nPartout dans le monde, la prière quotidienne du Juif pieux est toujours adressée en se tournant vers Jérusalem et bénit la construction de cette ville, tout en appelant au retour des exilés. « Puisse nos yeux voir votre retour dans la miséricorde à Sion », Amida.« Pour l’amour de Sion, je ne garderai pas le silence, pour Jérusalem je n’aurai point de repos », Is. 62:1.\n\nPour les chrétiens\nJésus à Jérusalem\nDepuis le Ier siècle, les récits de la vie de Jésus, notamment les Évangiles, font de Jérusalem le théâtre des derniers jours de Jésus lors de la Pâque juive, de sa venue au temple dont il expulse les marchands, de sa Passion, depuis son arrestation à sa crucifixion, puis de sa résurrection, point central des doctrines chrétiennes.\nDans certaines traditions, Jérusalem, précisément le mont des Oliviers, est l'endroit où a eu lieu l'ascension du Christ et c'est là que les chrétiens attendent son retour au jour du Jugement dernier.\n\nLieux saints chrétiens\nEn conséquence, on trouve à Jérusalem différents lieux de la Passion : le Cénacle (lieu du dernier repas avec les apôtres), la via Dolorosa (chemin suivi vers le lieu de la crucifixion), le jardin de Gethsémani (lieu de l'arrestation) au pied du Mont des Oliviers où se trouve l'église de l'Ascension, lieux de pèlerinage.\nOn y vénère aussi des souvenirs de la vierge Marie, de saint Étienne et de saint Jacques le Juste qui y ont été martyrisés, etc.\nSainte Hélène, mère de l'empereur Constantin (IVe siècle), puis les empereurs romains d'Orient et les empereurs byzantins y ont construit de somptueux sanctuaires sur les lieux saints, notamment sur le tombeau de Jésus.\n\nJérusalem dans l'histoire du christianisme\nTrès tôt apparait le concept de « Jérusalem céleste » (Livre de l'Apocalypse), repris notamment par Augustin d'Hippone au Ve siècle dans La Cité de Dieu.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège d'un des patriarcats historiques du christianisme, aux côtés de Rome, d'Antioche, d'Alexandrie et de Constantinople).\nElle devient très tôt un lieu de pèlerinage, le plus important du monde chrétien. L'irruption des musulmans au VIIe siècle pose un problème majeur aux chrétiens : les lieux saints sont désormais sous le contrôle de gouvernants non chrétiens, les califes de Damas, puis de Bagdad, puis d'autres dynasties régnant à partir de l'Égypte.\nLe lien très fort entre les chrétiens et Jérusalem aboutit à la fin du XIe siècle à l'épisode historique majeur des croisades en Terre sainte. En 1099 (première croisade), Jérusalem devient pour neuf décennies la capitale du royaume latin de Jérusalem. La ville est reconquise le 2 octobre 1187 par le sultan d'Égypte et de Syrie Saladin. Une troisième croisade est lancée en 1189, mais elle ne réussit pas à reprendre Jérusalem. La dernière croisade, la neuvième, a lieu en 1271-1272 : c'est un nouvel échec. Par la suite, l'idée de croisade persiste jusqu'à la fin du Moyen Âge, mais aucune expédition en Terre sainte ne peut être mise sur pied.\n\nPour les musulmans\nPour les musulmans, la sainteté de la ville provient de toutes les raisons précédemment citées et surtout à partir du XIIe siècle, du fait que selon la tradition, le prophète de l'islam Mahomet y aurait effectué son voyage nocturne (Isra) en 620 ap. J.-C.\nLe Coran ne mentionne pas explicitement le nom de la ville de Jérusalem mais les traditions l'associent à quelques passages du texte coranique. Le premier est le récit de la montée au ciel de Mahomet (al Mi'raj : l'ascension), accompagné par l'ange Gabriel, à l'emplacement de la « Mosquée la plus lointaine ». C'est en référence à ce récit que la mosquée de Jérusalem sur l'Esplanade des Mosquées (al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf, « Noble Sanctuaire ») a été appelée « al-Aqsa », ce qui veut dire « le plus éloigné », et identifiée comme telle au VIIe ou au VIIIe siècle. Absent donc du Coran, le nom de Jérusalem comme lieu du Voyage nocturne de Mahomet est, par contre, parfaitement explicite dans le récit d'Ibn Ishaq, rédigé 120 à 150 ans après l'Hégire (VIIIe siècle). Pour François Déroche, « une analyse récente fait cependant valoir que, d'après des traditions anciennes, ce voyage nocturne aurait été en direction du ciel ; c'est ultérieurement que l’exégèse classique aurait proposé de comprendre al-masjid al-Aqsâ comme le mont du Temple et fait de ce dernier le point de départ de l'ascension de Mahomet ».\nDe même, selon les traditions musulmanes, les premiers musulmans priaient en direction de Jérusalem - choix communément « interprété comme une tentative en vue de convertir les Juifs de Médine et des environs » ; la direction de la Ka'ba de La Mecque est établie par Mahomet plus tard, en 624. Si le texte coranique mentionne un changement de qibla, il ne cite pas la ville de Jérusalem. Enfin, s'appuyant sur des traditions juives et chrétiennes, l'islam reconnait dans l'expression « l'endroit proche », le lieu du Jugement dernier, à Jérusalem.\nL'islamologue Pierre Lory indique que « la sacralité de Jérusalem était déjà présente aux premiers siècles de l’Hégire, comme en témoignent les mosquées omeyyades. Mais son poids s’est accru à partir des XIe et XIIe, et s’est encore accentué à l’ère moderne ». Pour les musulmans, Jérusalem se voit reconnaître les critères du lieu saint islamique : « nombril de la terre, haut lieu, sanctuaire privilégié ». Ces trois qualités lui étaient déjà appliquées par la tradition juive, et dès le début de l'islam, des Juifs convertis à la religion musulmane, tels Ka‘b al-Ạhbār et Wahb b. Munabbih, « introduisent dans le corpus primitif, des éléments midrashiques les attribuant à cette ville ». Quant à la notion de « mémorial prophétique », elle s'inscrit dans la tradition islamique (Jérusalem est la cité des prophètes (nabî) David (داوود, Dāwūd) et Salomon (سُلَيْمان, Sulaymān), comme le Coran les décrit), et dans le fait qu'« elle a servi de point de départ pour le mi‘rāj, l'Ascension de Mahomet au ciel » ; ainsi, elle a eu un rôle fondamental dans la piété populaire et mystique.\nL'islam a déclaré Jérusalem comme étant sa troisième ville sainte, mais son statut pour l'islam « connut des hauts et des bas. ». Si les hadiths et les traditions musulmanes lui reconnaissent une place importante, elle est très fortement critiquée dès les premiers siècles de l'islam. La dimension religieuse de Jérusalem se développe principalement à partir de 1144 et de l'apparition du religieux dans le discours politique de Zengi dans sa lutte contre les royaumes francs ; les mots masjid Al-Aqsa (« la Mosquée la plus lointaine »), issus du Coran, ne figureront sur cette même mosquée qu'au XIe siècle.\nCe changement de rapport à Jérusalem s'observe par les critiques s'élevant du monde musulman contre le démantèlement des fortifications de Jérusalem en 1219 et la cession de la ville à Frédéric II en 1229, alors que la conquête de la ville par les croisés de la Première croisade, au XIe siècle, n'avait pas créé de telles réactions. « Cette faiblesse [de la sainteté de Jérusalem] aurait tenu tout d'abord au fait qu'une bonne partie des docteurs de la Loi s'opposait à la place d'honneur que les mystiques musulmans voulaient accorder à la ville ».\n\nAdministration et politique\nLa ville tient également une place importante dans les sentiments nationaux israélien et palestinien. L’État d’Israël a fait de Jérusalem-Ouest sa capitale en 1949 (la Jordanie occupant le reste de la ville) puis a fait de Jérusalem « réunifiée » sa capitale après la conquête de la ville en 1967. Bien que de manière générale, ce soit le pouvoir exécutif d'un pays qui choisisse sa propre capitale où siègent ses institutions fondamentales, la grande majorité des pays du monde ont depuis retiré leur ambassade de la ville, contestant à Israël ce choix de 1967. Pour la communauté internationale, Jérusalem-Est est considérée comme « occupée ».\n\nJérusalem a été proclamée « capitale éternelle » d'Israël en 1980 puis capitale de la Palestine en 1988, bien que l'autorité palestinienne n'y siège pas. Selon la communauté internationale, le statut de la ville doit faire l'objet de négociations entre Israéliens et Palestiniens.\n\nLimites administratives\nLa municipalité israélienne administrait 38 km2 de la ville avant la guerre des Six Jours. La municipalité jordanienne ne couvrait que les 6 km2 dont la Vieille ville. Le conseil des ministres israélien du 26 juin 1967 étend le territoire municipal à 71 km2 incluant des terres en bordure des villes d'Al-Bireh, Ramallah et Bethléem. Après la loi de Jérusalem de 1980, un amendement du 27 novembre 2000 fixe définitivement les limites de la municipalité dont la surface est en 2016 de 125 km2.\n\nQuestion du statut de Jérusalem\nLe statut de la ville, intégralement sous administration civile israélienne depuis la guerre des Six Jours, est contesté. La « ligne verte » séparait auparavant Jérusalem-Ouest (Israël) et Jérusalem-Est (territoire occupé par la Jordanie) depuis les accords d'armistice israélo-arabes de 1949. Ces accords indiquent explicitement que la ligne d'armistice ne préjuge pas des revendications territoriales ultérieures. En particulier l'accord israélo-jordanien stipule dans son article VI.9 : « Ces lignes de démarcation sont agréées par les parties sans préjudice d'accords ultérieurs ou d'accords frontaliers ultérieurs ou de revendication ultérieures des parties ». La tentative de confirmation de ces lignes d'armistice en frontières a échoué à la conférence de Lausanne de 1949 (27 avril-12 septembre). Elle avait été convoquée par la commission de conciliation des Nations unies. Finalement les accords d'armistice n'ont pas été enregistrés par les Nations unies qui ont néanmoins contribué à leur surveillance. Ils ont fait l'objet d'une garantie par les membres occidentaux du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies (États-Unis, France, Royaume-Uni). C'est la déclaration tripartite du 29 mai 1950. Entre-temps, la Chambre des députés jordanienne et la Chambre des notables a voté le 24 avril 1950 l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est et de la Cisjordanie.\nLa loi fondamentale israélienne du 30 juillet 1980 déclare que « Jérusalem unifiée [est la] capitale éternelle et indivisible d’Israël ». La résolution 476 et la résolution 478 du Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU estiment que le vote du Parlement israélien constitue « une violation du droit international » et appelle les « États qui ont établi des missions diplomatiques à Jérusalem de retirer ces missions de la Ville sainte ». Elles réaffirment que « l'acquisition de territoire par la force est inadmissible », qu'il doit être mis fin à l'occupation de Jérusalem et que « les dispositions législatives et administratives prises par Israël… n'ont aucune validité en droit et constituent une violation flagrante de la convention de Genève… ». Le Conseil de sécurité mentionne dans ses attendus la ville sainte de Jérusalem, en effet, la délimitation de la vieille ville est la seule internationalement établie.\n\nLe 31 juillet 1988, le roi Hussein déclare à la télévision que la Jordanie abandonne ses revendications de souveraineté sur la Cisjordanie et Jérusalem-Est à l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine. Pour autant, cette déclaration n'a pas de valeur en droit international. Le 26 octobre 1994 le Traité de paix israélo-jordanien est signé. Les frontières internationales entre Israël et la Jordanie sont fixées. Mais, le statut des territoires « …sous contrôle militaire israélien depuis 1967 », c'est-à-dire notamment Jérusalem-Est, est réservé. Il est néanmoins précisé que « le rôle spécial » du royaume de Jordanie sur les lieux de pèlerinage musulmans de Jérusalem est reconnu. Une priorité sera accordée à ce rôle historique lors des négociations sur le futur statut permanent de la ville, ceci conformément à la Déclaration de Washington du 25 juillet 1994. En 2000, l'Autorité palestinienne vote une loi établissant Jérusalem capitale d'un futur État, cette loi est ratifiée en 2002. Pour les parties en présence, le statut de Jérusalem reste une question clé de la résolution du conflit israélo-palestinien. En décembre 2003, l'Initiative de Genève, plan de paix alternatif établi par les anciens partenaires des négociations de Taba, prévoit, dans le cadre d'un règlement global du conflit israélo-palestinien, le partage de la souveraineté sur Jérusalem qui serait la capitale des deux États, les quartiers arabes et l'esplanade des Mosquées étant sous souveraineté palestinienne.\nLa question de la légitimité de chacune des deux parties sur Jérusalem entraîne également des débats d'ordre archéologique. Les Israéliens ont entamé depuis 1967 des recherches pour tenter d'apporter des preuves du Temple de Jérusalem. Palestiniens et Israéliens s'accusent réciproquement de mener des travaux, les uns pour détruire des preuves archéologiques de cette existence, les autres pour fragiliser les fondations des mosquées de la vieille ville. D'après les experts israéliens, les fondations des mosquées ont été fragilisées par plusieurs tremblements de terre au cours des derniers siècles. La discussion sur l'utilisation des expressions mont du Temple/esplanade des Mosquées (Haram al Sharif) est significative par rapport aux soucis des deux parties de gagner la bataille de la légitimité sur Jérusalem.\n\nPosition d'Israël\nAprès la déclaration d'indépendance de l'État d'Israël en 1948 et la guerre qui s'ensuivit, la ville se retrouve divisée entre une partie occidentale annexée par Israël et une partie orientale (comprenant toute la vieille ville) annexée par la Jordanie, séparées par un no man's land. En 1949, Jérusalem-Ouest est proclamée capitale d'Israël.\nEn 1967, lors de la guerre des Six Jours, Tsahal conquiert Jérusalem-Est et Israël déclare Jérusalem réunifiée, sa capitale éternelle et indivisible. Toutefois, en 1996, aucun État n'avait reconnu cette annexion et aucun n'y avait alors d'ambassade ; la situation a évolué depuis lors et plusieurs États (dont les États-Unis) ont déplacé leur ambassade à Jérusalem car l'ONU a jugé nulle et non avenue cette modification du statut de la ville (résolutions 476 et 478 du Conseil de Sécurité). Israël a confirmé la gestion de l'esplanade qui reste depuis lors sous la juridiction d'un organisme musulman, le Waqf.\nEn 1980, dans une des lois fondamentales d'Israël, la Knesset déclare Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible : c'est la Loi de Jérusalem. Les différents pouvoirs israéliens, législatif, exécutif, judiciaire et administratif, sont regroupés à Jérusalem.\nEn 2000 au sommet de Camp David II, Ehud Barak propose de donner la souveraineté palestinienne sur certains quartiers de Jérusalem comme Abou Dis (où se situe l'université al-Qods) ainsi qu'une gestion autonome des quartiers palestiniens. L'échec de ce sommet met fin à ces négociations. En 2005, la question du statut et de l'éventuel partage de Jérusalem reste au cœur du futur processus de paix mais aucune tentative de négociations n'a plus été entamée sur ce point depuis le sommet de Taba.\n\nPosition de l'OLP et de l'autorité palestinienne\nDès le début du Mandat britannique et tout au long de leur combat nationaliste, les Palestiniens ont revendiqué le contrôle de l'ensemble de la Palestine, avec Jérusalem pour capitale mais sans pouvoir concrétiser ses revendications.\nLors de la proclamation d'un État palestinien par l'OLP en 1988, Jérusalem est choisie comme capitale. L'OLP de Yasser Arafat s'est souvent positionnée dans le sens de ces revendications refusant d'avoir une autre capitale que Jérusalem. L'OLP possédait à Jérusalem un siège officieux, la « Maison d'Orient », dirigée par Fayçal Husseini ; en 2001, cette institution a été fermée de force en représailles à la suite d'un attentat. Jérusalem est par ailleurs la ville d'origine de réfugiés palestiniens qui souhaitent revenir y vivre. La question du statut final de la ville est ainsi intimement liée à la question des réfugiés palestiniens.\n\nPosition du Saint-Siège\nLe Saint-Siège n'accepte pas l'annexion de Jérusalem par Israël. Il préconise « un statut spécial, internationalement garanti et déclare moralement et juridiquement inacceptable toute décision et action unilatérale qui modifie son caractère spécifique et son statut ».\n\nPosition de l'ONU\nLa position de l'ONU concernant Jérusalem est liée à la Résolution 181 de l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies (le plan de partage de la Palestine) ainsi qu'aux résolutions de l'Assemblée générale et du Conseil de sécurité qui en découlent.\nLe Conseil de sécurité, dans ses résolutions 476 et 478, déclare que la loi israélienne établissant Jérusalem capitale éternelle et indivisible est nulle et non avenue, et constitue une violation du droit international. La résolution invite les États membres à retirer leur mission diplomatique de la ville.\nDans sa dixième session extraordinaire réunie en urgence le 21 décembre 2017 après la décision du président américain Donald Trump de déplacer l'ambassade américaine à Jérusalem, l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies a demandé aux États de s'abstenir d'établir leur ambassade à Jérusalem et déclaré nulle et non avenue toute décision contraire. Malgré les pressions des États-Unis, la résolution a été largement adoptée par 128 voix pour, 9 voix contre et 35 abstentions.\n\nPremière proposition de l'ONU\nÀ l'expiration du mandat britannique, le plan de partage de la Palestine de novembre 1947 prévoyait que Jérusalem et Bethléem deviennent un corpus separatum sous contrôle international et indépendant de ce qui devait devenir un État arabe et un État juif. Cette séparation devait ainsi garantir à tous les cultes le libre accès à tous les lieux saints en sécurité. Le Comité spécial sur la Palestine avait prévu qu'après un délai de dix ans de corpus separatum, le statut définitif de Jérusalem serait fixé par la population consultée par référendum.\n\nHistorique des résolutions\nLes résolutions suivantes ont été adoptées par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies. Elles concernent Jérusalem de manière tacite (résolution 252) ou explicite pour toutes les résolutions ultérieures :\n\n1968 : résolution 252\n1969 : résolutions 267 et 271\n1971 : résolution 298\n1980 : résolutions 465, 476 et 478\n1996 : résolution 1073\n\nPositions internationales\nDans le passé, avant 1973, certains pays africains, y compris l'Éthiopie et la Côte d'Ivoire, avaient des ambassades à Jérusalem. En 1973, après la guerre du Kippour, de nombreux pays africains décident de rompre leurs relations diplomatiques avec Israël.\nAvant la résolution 478 votée en 1980, 13 pays avaient une ambassade à Jérusalem : la Bolivie, le Chili, la Colombie, le Costa Rica, la République dominicaine, l'Équateur, le Salvador, le Guatemala, Haïti, les Pays-Bas, le Panama, l'Uruguay, le Venezuela. Suivant les termes de cette résolution, les 13 ambassades ont été déplacées à Tel Aviv. Les ambassades du Costa Rica et du Salvador ont de nouveau été déplacées à Jérusalem en 1984, jusqu'en 2006 où ces deux États décident de transférer de nouveau leurs ambassades à Tel Aviv.\n\nLe Congrès des États-Unis a voté le 8 novembre 1995 le Jerusalem Embassy Act qui reconnaît Jérusalem comme capitale de l'État d'Israël, demande que la ville demeure indivise et prévoie des fonds pour y déplacer l'ambassade américaine avant le 31 mai 1999. Cependant le déménagement de l'ambassade a été reporté par la signature de dérogation tous les six mois, jusqu'au 6 décembre 2017, quand le président Donald Trump, revendiquant une nouvelle approche sur le conflit israélo-palestinien, officialise internationalement la reconnaissance par les États-Unis de Jérusalem comme capitale, et donne des instructions pour y transférer l'ambassade.\nLa décision de Donald Trump tranchait sur la politique de la Maison-Blanche de Barack Obama dont le porte-parole, par exemple, à l'occasion de l'éloge mortuaire de Shimon Peres, corrigeait l'expression « Jerusalem, Israel » en supprimant le mot « Israel ». La décision de Trump a été condamnée par des alliés de Washington et par l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies. Le roi saoudien a déclaré qu'elle risque de provoquer « la colère des Musulmans », trois jours après que son fils a proposé à Mahmoud Abbas de renoncer à Jérusalem-Est comme capitale.\nLes États-Unis inaugurent officiellement leur ambassade à Jérusalem le 14 mai 2018, suivis par le Guatemala le 16 mai et le Paraguay le 21 mai. Toutefois, le Paraguay annule cette orientation trois mois plus tard sur décision de son nouveau président, Mario Abdo.\nDans une déclaration au Figaro publiée le 30 novembre 2009, le ministre français des Affaires étrangères d'alors, Bernard Kouchner, déclare : « Pour nous, Jérusalem doit être, à la fois la capitale de l'État d'Israël et du futur État palestinien ».\nLe 8 décembre 2009, l’Union européenne appelle Israël à partager Jérusalem comme capitale conjointe de deux États hébreu et palestinien. Les Vingt-Sept assurent qu’ils « ne reconnaîtront aucun changement autre que négocié » au statut d’avant 1967.\nLe 15 décembre 2018, l'Australie décide de reconnaître Jérusalem-Ouest comme capitale d’Israël, mais sans procéder au transfert de son ambassade installée à Tel-Aviv. Le Premier ministre Scott Morrison conditionne le transfert de l’ambassade à la conclusion d’un improbable accord de paix et annonce projeter de n'ouvrir à Jérusalem qu'un bureau chargé de la défense et du commerce. Le 18 octobre 2022, la ministre des Affaires étrangères, Penny Wong, annonce le retrait de la décision du précédent gouvernement.\nEn septembre 2023, le Premier ministre de Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée James Marape fait de la Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée le cinquième pays (après les États-Unis, le Guatemala, le Honduras et le Kosovo) à établir son ambassade auprès d'Israël à Jérusalem. Cette décision intervient à la suite d'un lobbying dans ce sens de la part d'églises chrétiennes en Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée.\nEn septembre 2025, le Premier ministre fidjien Sitiveni Rabuka est présent à son tour à l'inauguration de l'ambassade fidjienne à Jérusalem, en présence du Premier ministre israélien Benyamin Netanyahou. Il répond ainsi à l'exigence du parti Sodelpa, parti de la droite chrétienne autochtone, qui est membre de son gouvernement de coalition.\n\nQuestion démographique\nStatistiques\nEn 1967, les autorités israéliennes recensent 66 000 Palestiniens résidents dans le territoire annexé par Israël, dont 44 000 de Jérusalem-Est, occupée par la Jordanie. Aucun Juif ne vivait à Jérusalem-Est, du fait de l'expulsion en 1948 par l'armée jordanienne. L'ONU a critiqué Israël dans plusieurs résolutions et considère que des mesures administratives ou législatives altérant la composition démographique de la ville n'a aucune validité.\nMiron Benvisti, politologue israélien et ancien adjoint à la mairie de Jérusalem, qui a longtemps écrit dans le journal « Haaretz », remarque qu'il n'y a pas de statistiques officielles et considère que la proportion démographique n'a pas changé. L'ancien secrétaire général du Congrès juif mondial (CJM) et analyste du Moyen-Orient, Dan Diker (en), critique le concept de judaïsation, entre autres, car Jérusalem était à majorité juive jusqu'à l'occupation jordanienne. Selon Diker, la population arabe de la ville est passée de 26,6 % en 1967 à 31,7 % en 2000 et le nombre de constructions dans les quartiers arabes est plus important que dans les quartiers juifs. Depuis le début des années 2010, le nombre d'enfants par femme devient plus élevé dans la population juive, en raison du nombre croissant de ménages ultraorthodoxes (250 000 habitants) et du départ des laïcs vers d'autres villes israéliennes. La population juive bénéficie en outre d'une espérance de vie nettement plus élevée (83,3 ans pour les Juifs et 73,3 ans pour les Arabes). En contrepartie,l'âge moyen de la première maternité est plus bas chez les femmes arabes que chez les femmes juives, rapprochant les générations.\n\nPolitique et territoires démographiques\nIl existe un débat quant à la volonté politique qu'aurait Israël de modifier l'écart démographique à l’est, peuplé essentiellement par les Palestiniens en 1967.\n\nEn 1980, Israël passe la loi de Jérusalem proclamant Jérusalem une et indivisible et avec des frontières municipales étendues. Le politologue Frédéric Encel le comprend comme une façon de « détruire l’influence palestinienne en modifiant l’équilibre géographique de la ville »[réf. nécessaire]. Il faut ajouter à cela les colonies juives relativement proches de la ville : au nord (Giv'at Ze'ev), au sud (Kedar) et à 7 km à l’est (Ma'aleh Adumim), ce qui augmente le nombre de Juifs dans la région aux alentours de Jérusalem, d'un périmètre de 440 km2[réf. nécessaire]. De nos jours, une ceinture de colonies s'est mise en place à Jérusalem-Est pour séparer les quartiers palestiniens du reste de la Cisjordanie occupée.\n\nLes limites municipales de la ville ne reposent pas totalement sur des territoires accordés par le droit international à l’État d’Israël et la construction de la barrière de séparation impose de fait des frontières non reconnues à l’est de Jérusalem. Les quartiers arabes seraient selon certains[Qui ?], victime d'une politique d'encerclement par les limites municipales de 1967. Jérusalem-Est faisait 38 km2 en 1967, sous l'occupation jordanienne. Et par l'effet de cette limite de municipalité, 108 km2 par la construction de quartiers juifs. Cet état de fait est accentué par le tracé du projet de barrière de séparation qui pourrait encercler Maale Adoumim à 11 km à l'est de Jérusalem. La barrière est destinée, selon Israël, principalement à réduire le nombre d'attentats terroristes palestiniens. Selon l'ONG palestinienne LAW (affilée à la Commission internationale de juristes) : « Israël continue à appliquer des mesures arbitraires et incompatibles avec le droit international pour chasser les Palestiniens de Jérusalem et les remplacer par des Juifs, de façon à cimenter son autorité sur la ville. Cette politique revêt des formes diverses : confiscation des cartes d'identité, retrait des permis de résidence, système fiscal injuste, refus du permis de construire. La politique de permis de construire, que le Conseil économique et social des Nations unies et Amnesty International jugent discriminatoire envers les Palestiniens, et la destruction de maisons appartenant à des Palestiniens affectent également la population arabe de Jérusalem-Est. ».\n\nÉconomie\nHistoriquement, l'économie de Jérusalem était centrée principalement sur les pèlerinages religieux et maintenant plus généralement sur le tourisme, et les entreprises publiques de l'État d'Israël. Depuis la création de l’État d’Israël, le gouvernement est demeuré un acteur majeur dans l'économie de la ville. Il ne génère pas seulement un grand nombre d'emplois mais œuvre à offrir les conditions propices à la création d'entreprises.\nBien que Tel Aviv reste le centre financier d'Israël, un nombre grandissant de sociétés high tech quittent Tel Aviv pour Jérusalem. La zone industrielle Har Hatzvin située au nord de la ville accueille plusieurs grandes sociétés comme Intel, Teva Pharmaceutical, et ECI Telecom.\nParmi les principales industries de Jérusalem, citons les fabriques de chaussures, le textile, l'industrie pharmaceutique, les produits de métaux, et les articles imprimés. Les usines sont situées surtout dans la zone industrielle d'Atarot au nord, le long de la route de Ramallah.\nJérusalem affiche, en 2023, un taux de pauvreté de 43 %. Les disparités sont importantes entre la population juive (32 % de pauvres) et arabe (61 %). Elles se retrouvent également dans le décalage entre Jérusalem-Ouest et Jérusalem-Est, en partie lié à la surdensité de l'habitat et aux sous-investissements : seuls 10 % du budget municipal reviennent à la partie orientale de la ville, qui représente 37 % de son territoire et 40 % de sa population. Le secteur Ouest concentre par ailleurs institutions et grands centres commerciaux.\n\nArt et culture\nPierre de Jérusalem\nEn application d'un décret de 1918, toutes les constructions nouvelles et les restaurations patrimoniales effectuées à Jérusalem sont réalisées essentiellement en pierre calcaire dite « pierre de Jérusalem », particulièrement la catégorie grey gold (« or gris ») issue des monts de Judée aux alentours de la capitale israélienne, utilisée déjà dans l’Antiquité — et servant encore de nos jours pour les édifices publics ou bâtiments privés.\n\nMonuments et archéologie\nOn trouve à Jérusalem un grand nombre de monuments religieux et historiques, comme le Mur occidental — aussi appelé mur des Lamentations — la mosquée al-Aqsa et le dôme du Rocher, l'église du Saint-Sépulcre. La Vieille Ville est complètement ceinturée de murailles qui datent du XVIe siècle. De nombreux sites archéologiques existent à Jérusalem, notamment les écuries de Salomon, la Cité de David.\n\nMusée national d'Israël\nFondé en 1965, le Musée national d'Israël est l'un des plus riches du Moyen-Orient avec près de 500 000 œuvres. Ce musée encyclopédique contient des collections issues de fouilles archéologiques de la préhistoire à l'époque moderne, et de dons importants provenant de tous les continents. Chacune de ses cinq ailes thématiques trouve son public : Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Judaïca (ethnologie juive), Sanctuaire du Livre (les plus anciens manuscrits bibliques au monde, dits manuscrits de la Mer morte, des grottes de Qumran), Jeunesse et médiation culturelle où certains programmes stimulent la compréhension entre jeunes juifs et arabes. Y figurent aussi la spectaculaire maquette de Jérusalem à l'époque du Second Temple (Ier siècle) avant sa destruction par les Romains, des répliques à l'identique de synagogues européennes du XVIIe siècle, et le célèbre Jardin d’art Billy Rose, conçu par le sculpteur nippo-américain Isamu Noguchi, tenu pour être l’un des plus beaux jardins d’art sculptural du XXe siècle, où se déroulent festivals, spectacles de danse ou concerts de qualité au milieu de nombreuses aires de détente. Ce vaste musée, sur un campus de plus de 80 000 mètres carrés, accueille près d'un million de visiteurs par an dont un tiers de touristes. Outre les programmes proposés sur son campus principal, le Musée d'Israël se déploie sur deux autres établissements de Jérusalem : la Maison Ticho (exposant des œuvres d'artistes de toutes disciplines) liée à l'École des beaux-arts Bezalel, institut centenaire sur le mont Scorpus, et le musée Rockefeller (archéologie de la terre d'Israël et de Palestine), édifice érigé en 1938.\n\nMusée des pays de la Bible\nLe Musée des pays de la Bible de Jérusalem est le seul musée d'histoire au monde qui explore et retrace la civilisation et la culture de tous les peuples mentionnés dans la Bible. Ses trésors archéologiques des cultures du Proche-Orient remontent de la préhistoire jusqu'à la rédaction du Talmud, au début de l'ère chrétienne. Il dispense en outre des conférences sur tous les aspects culturels de la région. Ce musée a acquis une renommée internationale en tant que centre universel pour la programmation culturelle et éducative.\n\nMusée d'art islamique\nLe musée d'art islamique fondé par la mécène britannique, Lady Vera Salomons, a ouvert ses portes en 1974 et est le seul de son genre en Israël. Il contient l'une des plus importantes collections au monde d'art islamique allant du VIIe au XIXe siècle, avec plus de 3 000 pièces rares en provenance d'Égypte, Syrie, Irak, Iran, Turquie, Afghanistan, Inde ou Espagne, qui instruisent sur les raffinements du monde artistique et culturel musulman. Une collection permanente d'œuvres est présentée face à des expositions temporaires qui lui font toujours écho. En outre, le musée expose la collection Salomons de montres et horloges remarquables. Il développe aussi des partenariats culturels, éducatifs ou événementiels en Israël et à l'étranger pour établir des ponts culturels et promouvoir le dialogue entre arabes et juifs, conformément aux vœux de sa fondatrice et de son illustre famille.\n\nParcs\nLe parc Rabinovitch également désigné sous le nom de Mifletzet (Monster) Park, contient une sculpture monumentale de Niki de Saint Phalle : Le Golem commandée à l'artiste par Teddy Kollek, maire de Jérusalem en 1971, inaugurée en 1972. Ce même parc contient aussi un stabile d'Alexander Calder, réalisé en 1976/1977 sous le titre Hommage à Jérusalem, comparable à l'Araignée Rouge du même artiste.\nLe Monstre et le stabile sont tous deux situés sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de Jérusalem.\nUn autre parc intitulé le Zoo biblique de Jérusalem, contient un grand nombre de sculptures monumentales d'animaux, réalisées par Niki de Saint Phalle en 1994 que l'artiste a réunis sous le titre L'Arche de Noé.\n\nVie sociale\nReligion\nJérusalem est une ville qui revêt une importance religieuse significative pour trois grandes religions monothéistes : le judaïsme, le christianisme et l'islam. Ces religions considèrent Jérusalem comme un lieu saint et sacré, ce qui en fait l'une des villes les plus contestées et les plus sensibles sur le plan religieux et politique.\n\nÉducation\nJérusalem accueille de nombreuses universités prestigieuses offrant des cours en hébreu, arabe et en anglais. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1925 ; elle fait depuis partie des 100 meilleures universités du monde et accueille des professeurs et étudiants de toute confession. Albert Einstein ou Sigmund Freud ont fait partie du conseil de ses gouverneurs. L'université compte parmi ses anciens élèves quelques lauréats du prix Nobel dont les universitaires Avram Hershko, David J. Gross et Daniel Kahneman.\nLe travail des étudiants et chercheurs est facilité par la bibliothèque nationale d'Israël, qui dispose de près de cinq millions de volumes. La bibliothèque a ouvert ses portes en 1892, près de trente ans avant la première université. C'est le site où figure le plus grand nombre de livres à thème hébraïque. Aujourd'hui, elle réunit la bibliothèque nationale et la bibliothèque universitaire. L'université hébraïque de Jérusalem est composée de trois campus, l'un au mont Scopus, l'autre à Guivat Ram, et le campus de médecine au centre médical Hadassah.\n\nL'université al-Qods a été fondée en 1984 et son campus principal est situé à Abu Dis (plus précisément en \"zone B\", sous contrôle israélien et palestinien) au sud-est de la ville, sur près de 19 hectares. Il existe quatre autres sites de l'université al-Qods développés dans l'agglomération de Jérusalem, à Jérusalem-est (Haram) à Sheikh Jarrah, Beit Hanina ou Ramallah. L'université accueille des universitaires locaux et de pays arabes  pour enseigner à 13 000 étudiants venus des régions de Jérusalem, Bethléem, Hébron, Jénine, Jéricho, Naplouse, Ramallah, Tulkarem et Qalqilya, dans les domaines des arts, sciences et technologie, ingénierie, administration, économie, éducation, médecine, para-médecine, dentisterie, santé publique, pharmacie, droit, fondements de la religion ou études coraniques et islamiques.\nL'université al-Qods a fait l'objet de controverses quant à la pratique de la liberté d'expression.\nD'autres instituts d'études supérieures dans Jérusalem sont l’Académie de musique et de danse de Jérusalem et l’École des beaux-arts Bezalel dont les bâtiments sont situés sur le campus de l'université hébraïque de Jérusalem.\nLa faculté des Technologies de Jérusalem a été fondée en 1969 et offre un enseignement d'ingénierie et de hautes technologies industrielles de réputation mondiale. Différents cursus y sont organisés, notamment en bio-informatique, en chimie numérique ainsi que des programmes spéciaux tels que Education For Ethiopians.\n\nCritiques\nL'enseignement pour les Arabes de Jérusalem et d'Israël est critiqué pour sa qualité inférieure à celle de l'enseignement pour les Juifs. De nombreuses écoles de l'Est de Jérusalem sont remplies à leur capacité maximum, au point qu'on enregistre des plaintes contre la surpopulation. Cependant, la municipalité de Jérusalem est en train de construire plus d'une douzaine de nouvelles écoles dans les quartiers arabes de la ville. Les écoles dans Ras el-Amud et Umm Lison ont ouvert en 2008 En mars 2007, le gouvernement israélien propose un plan sur 5 ans de construction de 8 000 nouvelles classes dans la ville, dont 40 % dans le secteur arabe et 28 % dans le secteur haredim. Un budget de 4,6 milliards de shekels a été accordé pour le projet. En 2008, un philanthrope britannique a fait un don de 3 millions de dollars américains pour la construction d'écoles dans la partie arabe de l'Est de Jérusalem. Les lycéens arabes passent le Bagrut (en), comme examen, la majeure partie de leur programme d'études est identique à celui des autres écoles secondaires israéliennes et comprend certains sujets portant sur la culture juive.\nLes autorités israéliennes font fermer en mai 2025 les écoles de l'ONU destinées aux enfants palestiniens dans la partie annexée de Jérusalem. Les forces israéliennes ont expulsé les enfants présents sur les lieux et placardé un ordre de fermeture indiquant que les écoles fonctionnaient illégalement en l'absence d' « autorisation.» Le commissaire général de l’UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, a qualifié cette décision de « violation du droit international », rappelant que « ces écoles sont des lieux inviolables appartenant aux Nations unies ». L’Autorité Palestinienne la qualifie de « violation du droit des enfants à l’éducation ».\n\nSanté\nListe des hôpitaux et centres médicaux de Jérusalem :\n\nCentre pédiatrique de Réinsertion Alyn\nHôpital Augusta Victoria\nHôpital Bikur Holim\nCentre médical Hadassah (Ein Kerem)\nCentre médical Hadassah (mont Scopus)\nHôpital Hansen\nHôpital Herzog\nHôpital Kfar Shaul (hôpital psychiatrique spécialisé dans le « syndrome de Jérusalem »)\nHôpital de l'université Al-Qods (Muqased)\nCentre médical Shaare Zedek\nHôpital ophtalmique St. John\nHôpital St-Joseph\nHôpital St-Louis (spécialisé aujourd'hui dans les soins gériatriques et palliatifs)\nHôpital Summit\n\nQuelques quartiers\nLa plupart des quartiers de Jérusalem-Ouest ont été construits en deuxième partie du XIXe siècle, quand la Vieille ville n'était plus en mesure de contenir sa population croissante, du fait des différents mouvements migratoires et de son propre développement.\n\nLe Moshav Ha-Germanit (« Colonie allemande ») est l'un des quartiers les plus huppés de la capitale, situé à son sud-est dans le district de Katamon. Fondé en 1873, il tient son nom des Allemands protestants du mouvement sectaire « Temple Society » en conflit avec l'Église d'État, qui avaient considéré Sion comme leur deuxième patrie pour s'y exiler. Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les descendants de ces Templiers, la plupart devenus nazis, sont expulsés. Aujourd'hui, le quartier a gardé ses agréables maisons aux volets en bois et à toit de tuiles rouges, entourées de jardins, qui sont habitées par une population d'origine plutôt européenne et aisée. L'environnement offre une réelle qualité de vie avec un Musée de la Nature, un ancien monastère arménien, une école d'art dramatique, une piscine olympique, nombre de terrasses ombragées de cafés et de restaurants à dimension humaine.\n\nMéa Shéarim (lit. « cent portes » ; sens « cent mesures ») est un quartier de Jérusalem situé au nord-ouest de la vieille ville. C'est l'un des cinq premiers quartiers juifs construit en 1874 en dehors de celle-ci. À l'origine, il était beaucoup moins étendu qu'aujourd'hui et ne comportait qu'un bloc de bâtiments qui existe toujours. Le quartier originel était composé de petites maisons de deux pièces pour une dizaine de personnes chacune qui, serrées les unes contre les autres, formaient un rempart naturel. Refermé sur lui-même, le quartier comportait des portes d'accès qui étaient fermées la nuit. Il est très connu car c'est un quartier où vivent exclusivement des Juifs ultra-orthodoxes. La majorité des hommes ne travaillent pas, consacrant leur vie à la seule étude de la Bible, ce qui fait de ce quartier l'un des plus pauvres de Jérusalem. Aux entrées de Méa Shéarim, les habitants du quartier ont installé de nombreux écriteaux destinés aux visiteurs incitant ces derniers à ne pas rentrer dans ce quartier vêtus de manière « indécente ».\n\nMamilla est un quartier d'habitation et de commerce situé à l'extérieur ouest de la porte de Jaffa. Avant la guerre des Six Jours, il figurait une sorte de zone-frontière et l'endroit était délaissé par les pouvoirs publics. Après 1967, il bénéficie d'un vaste programme de réhabilitation et rénovation urbaines achevées en 2007 sous la houlette du célèbre architecte israélien, Moshé Safdie. Ce concepteur respecte l'empreinte du XIXe siècle en intégrant à ce nouvel espace de vie un grand nombre de structures historiques restaurées à l'identique et de nouvelles dans le même esprit, en utilisant une pierre de Jérusalem vieillie. Entre autres, s'y trouvent un secteur résidentiel dit « David village », une longue allée piétonne pavée au sein d'un centre commercial à ciel ouvert, bordée des vitrines de magasins d'enseignes locales ou internationales, et de restaurants attirant nombre de visiteurs qui bénéficient à son extrémité d'une vue spectaculaire sur la vieille ville, la Tour de David à proximité et le mont Sion. Ce quartier permet aussi la visite de l'antique piscine de Mamilla au centre de l'ancien cimetière musulman sur une partie duquel le futur musée de la Tolérance ouvre ses portes et fait l'objet d'une polémique internationale. L'endroit offre en outre des parcs verdoyants, des centres culturels (comme le Musée de la musique hébraïque, le Musée Nahon d'art juif italien ou le centre événementiel de la Création juive, Beit Avi Chaï) qui côtoient l'ancien Palace Hotel ottoman Art déco devenu le luxueux Waldorf Astoria ou le fameux hôtel King David, l'hôpital gériatrique français St-Louis construit en 1881 et ayant permis une percée dans les murailles de la vieille ville, dite « Porte Neuve » à l'époque ottomane, le monastère des Sœurs du Rosaire fondé en 1880 et accueillant les pèlerins depuis 1960, ou le Consulat de France.\n\nSport\nLes deux sports les plus populaires sont le football et le basket-ball. Le Beitar Jérusalem Football Club, dans le championnat d'Israël de football, est le plus connu en Israël, ayant été vainqueur cinq fois de la coupe d'Israël de football. Jérusalem compte une autre équipe de football, le Hapoel Katamon F.C., vainqueur une seule fois de la coupe d'Israël de football, qui est en troisième division, la liga Artzit.\nEn basket-ball, le Hapoel Jérusalem joue dans la première division. Le club a gagné le championnat d'Israël de basket-ball trois fois, et la coupe ULEB en 2004. Inauguré en 1992, le stade Teddy Kollek est le plus grand stade de football de Jérusalem avec une capacité de 21 000 places.\nLe marathon de Jérusalem a été créé en 2011 malgré quelques protestations. Le huitième marathon s'est tenu en mars 2018 avec une participation de 35 000 concurrents dont 4 000 étrangers. Le parcours commençait près de la Knesset pour continuer vers le marché de Mahané Yehuda, le mont Scopus, la Vieille Ville, la tour de David. L'invité d'honneur était l'Éthiopien Haile Gebrselassie.\n\nInstitutions israéliennes\nInstitutions nationales d'Israël\nJérusalem est le siège de plusieurs institutions de l'État d'Israël, notamment la Knesset (assemblée nationale) et la Cour suprême, les bureaux du Premier ministre et différents ministères.\nLe cimetière national d'Israël, avec notamment les tombeaux de Theodor Herzl et de sa famille, se trouve sur le mont Herzl, à l'ouest de la ville.\nLa Bibliothèque nationale d'Israël se trouve dans les locaux de l'université hébraïque, sur le site de Guivat Ram.\n\nInstitutions universitaires\nOn y trouve aussi des institutions universitaires, dont certaines antérieures à la création d'Israël :\n\nl'université hébraïque de Jérusalem, fondée en 1918, avec quatre sites, dont trois (mont Scopus, Guivat Ram et Ein Kerem) dans la municipalité de Jérusalem ;\nle centre Yad Ben-Zvi (recherche historique et archéologique), fondé en 1947, situé dans le quartier de Réhavia\nOn peut noter la présence de l'École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, fondée en 1890 et située dans la vieille ville.\n\nAutres\nC'est à Jérusalem que se trouve le plus grand centre mondial pour la mémoire de la Shoah, Yad Vashem, situé sur le mont Herzl.\nJérusalem est aussi le siège de l'Organisation sioniste mondiale et les congrès sionistes mondiaux y ont lieu depuis 1951, alors qu'auparavant la ville la plus fréquente était Bâle, lieu du premier congrès en 1897.\n\nInstitutions palestiniennes\nTransports\nTransport aérien\nL'aéroport le plus proche est celui d'Atarot, au nord de Jérusalem (31° 51′ 53″ N, 35° 13′ 09″ E), qui a été utilisé pour les vols intérieurs israéliens jusqu'en octobre 2000 notamment pour les vols vers Eilat, et est désormais placé sous le contrôle de Tsahal en raison de sa proximité géographique avec les territoires autonomes palestiniens. Depuis lors, les vols ont été transférés vers l'aéroport Ben Gourion, proche de Tel Aviv à une quarantaine de kilomètres au nord-ouest.\n\nTransports routiers\nLa coopérative d'autobus Egged, deuxième plus grande compagnie d'autobus dans le monde, dessert la plupart des localités autour de Jérusalem et gère les services d'autocars vers le reste du pays depuis la gare routière centrale sur la rue Jaffa, près de l'entrée ouest de Jérusalem.\nLa gare routière de Jérusalem-Est se situe rue du Sultan Suleiman, proche de la porte de Damas. Elle dessert les localités palestiniennes de Cisjordanie.\n\nTransports ferroviaires\nJérusalem est relié par le chemin de fer à Tel Aviv depuis 1892 (ancienne ligne de Jaffa à Jerusalem (en)). Son service a été interrompu en 1998 en raison du mauvais état des infrastructures qui furent alors rénovées. Elle a été rouverte dans sa totalité en avril 2005, avec l'inauguration de la nouvelle gare de Jérusalem Malha, située dans le sud de la ville.\nUne seconde ligne abusivement qualifiée de liaison à grande vitesse en provenance de Tel Aviv, la ligne de chemin de fer Tel Aviv–Jérusalem, au nord de cette première ligne, est ouverte en 2018. Elle est électrifiée et utilise plusieurs longs tunnels pour permettre le passage à grande vitesse des trains de la côte à la région montagneuse de Jérusalem. Les trains font terminus dans la gare souterraine de Binyanei HaUma nommée Yitzhak Navon située sous la gare routière centrale. Le trajet de Tel Aviv à Jérusalem prend environ 28 minutes.\n\nTramway\nLa première ligne de tramway, ouverte le 19 août 2011 et prolongée le 27 février 2025 sur 22,5 km, dessert 35 stations depuis Neve Yaakov au nord-est jusqu'au Centre médical Hadassah à Ein Kerem au sud-ouest. Cette ligne est équipée de rames Citadis, construites par Alstom et de rames Urbos, construites par CAF.\nChoisie pour exploiter cette ligne dans le cadre du consortium CityPass, la société Veolia Transport s'est trouvée confrontée à des critiques et s'est retirée dès 2010. L’exploitation est assurée par le groupe israélien de transports Egged.\n\nJumelages\nNew York (États-Unis) depuis 1993\n Prague (Tchéquie)\n Ayabe (Japon) depuis le 9 février 2000\n\nJérusalem-Est\nFès (Maroc) depuis 1982 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n Rabat (Maroc) depuis 2012 (avec l'Autorité palestinienne)\n\nBlason et drapeau israélien de Jérusalem\nLe lion en posture rampante (dressé sur ses pattes arrière), représente le Lion de Juda, l'arrière-plan représente le Mur occidental et les rameaux d'olivier représentent la paix.

          "summary": "Jérusalem (prononciation française /ʒe.ʁy.za.lɛm/), en hébreu : יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim (dénomination israélienne officielle) ; en arabe : القدس, al Quds  ou اورشليم, Ûrshalîm (dénomination israélienne officielle en arabe), est une ville du Proche-Orient ; sa vieille ville occupe une place centrale dans les religions juive et chrétienne, et une place importante dans la religion musulmane ainsi que dans le conflit en cours depuis la création d'Israël en 1948.\nEn 1947, dans son plan de partage de la Palestine mandataire, l'ONU dote Jérusalem d'un statut international, mais la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948-1949 aboutit à un partage de la ville entre occupation israélienne (Jérusalem-Ouest) et jordanienne (Jérusalem-Est). Le 31 janvier 1950, le gouvernement israélien proclame Jérusalem capitale de l'État d'Israël et y transfère les organes de l'État (le gouvernement en 1949 puis dans les années 1950 la Knesset et la Cour suprême), mais la plupart des pays maintiennent leur ambassade à Tel Aviv-Jaffa, internationalement reconnue comme capitale.\nAprès la guerre des Six Jours (1967), Israël occupe la totalité de la ville (ainsi que la Cisjordanie et la bande de Gaza) et prononce unilatéralement l'annexion de Jérusalem-Est en 1980, mesure non reconnue internationalement.\nChef-lieu du district de Jérusalem, la ville est donc aujourd'hui aussi de facto la capitale d'Israël, tandis que sa partie Est est la capitale proclamée et revendiquée par l'État de Palestine. La ville abrite également les territoires enclavés du domaine national français en Terre sainte.\nLa municipalité de Jérusalem s’étend sur 125,1 km2 pour une population de 966 346 habitants en janvier 2022. Cette population est très variée, avec des religions, des origines et des conditions socio-économiques diverses. La vieille ville, d'une superficie de moins de 1 km2, est historiquement composée de quatre quartiers : un quartier musulman, un quartier arménien, un quartier chrétien et un quartier juif. Ces quartiers sont entourés de remparts dont la partie visible aujourd'hui a été construite entre 1535 et 1538. Cependant, les recherches menées par Vincent Lemire montrent le caractère exogène (apportée par les pèlerins et les visiteurs) de cette cartographie tardive (XIXe siècle) qui met de côté la complexité des dynamiques de peuplements des différentes parties de la vieille ville.\nSituée à environ 800 m d'altitude, Jérusalem est éloignée de 33 km de la mer Morte, dont l'altitude est de 400 m au-dessous du niveau de la mer.",

          "content": "## Overview\nJerusalem (Hebrew: ירושלים Yerushalayim, Arabic: القدس al-Quds) is the largest city of Israel. Israel claim it is their capital and a few countries including the United States recognize that claim, but most other countries and the United Nations do not.\nThe ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years. The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center. Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel. Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.\nJerusalem of Gold, as it has come to be known in Hebrew, is a fascinatingly unique place where the first century rubs shoulders with the twenty-first century, each jostling for legitimacy and space, and where picturesque \"old\" neighborhoods nestle against glistening office towers and high-rise apartments. It is one of those places that have to be seen to be believed.\n\n## Understand\nLocated in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea, Jerusalem is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is the holiest city in Judaism and Christianity, having been the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE, and the third-holiest in Islam. It has a history of nearly 4000 years, and has been fought over and conquered countless times in that period. While the city began to have a Jewish plurality in the late 19th century, today a wide range of national, religious, and socioeconomic groups are represented here. During the Jordanian occupation 1949-1967 all Jews in East Jerusalem were expelled and entry was barred for Israeli citizens of any faith and even today there tend to be more Muslims in east Jerusalem and more Jews in West Jerusalem.\nThe walled area of Jerusalem, which until the 1860s formed the entire city, is now called the Old City, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. It consists of four ethnic and religious sections—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Quarters. Barely one square kilometer, the Old City is home to Jerusalem's most important and contested religious sites - the Western Wall and Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christians.\nSurrounding the Old City are more modern areas of Jerusalem. The civic and cultural center of modern Israel is in western Jerusalem, while Arab neighborhoods can be found in the east. Jerusalem became Israel's capital upon its independence. The city was reunited after the 1967 War when Israel captured East Jerusalem. Nowadays there is no visible sign of the pre-1967 border, but Jewish and Arab neighborhoods are still generally separate.\n\n## History\nArchaeological findings show development within present-day Jerusalem as far back as the 4th millennium BCE, but the earliest written records of the city come in the Execration Texts (c. 19th century BCE) and the Amarna letters (c. 14th century BCE). According to Biblical accounts, the Jebusites (a Canaanite tribe) inhabited Jerusalem until c. 1000 BCE, at which point the Israelites (led by King David) conquered the city, establishing it as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. Throughout this period, Jerusalem was located in what is now known as the \"City of David\", just outside the current Old City walls to the southeast, where a large natural spring is located.\nAccording to the Bible, after David died, his son Solomon built the first of two Holy Temples. The temples were north of the City of David, on a site underneath or very close to the current Dome of the Rock. Upon Solomon's death the kingdom split in two (though many historians contend that the two Israelite kingdoms were never united to begin with). The ten northern tribes became known as the Kingdom of Israel, while Jerusalem remained the capital of the southern Kingdom of Judah, ruled by David and Solomon's descendants. After the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem was the center of the only remaining Israelite/Jewish kingdom. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah including Jerusalem, destroying the temple and exiling many of the inhabitants.\nIn 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to Judah and Jerusalem. The rebuilt (Second) Temple was completed in 516 BCE. Jerusalem regained its status as capital of Judah and center of Jewish worship for nearly six centuries. Jerusalem would remain under Persian control until the conquest by Alexander when it would come under Greek (first Ptolemaic, later Seleucid) control. In the second century BCE, the Hasmonean family led a successful rebellion against the Seleucid Greek rulers of Judea, establishing an independent Jewish state which lasted over 100 years. This era is described in the deuterocanonical book of Maccabbees and an event during the recapture of Jerusalem is the basis of the celebration of Hannukkah. In about 19 BCE, Herod the Great (a Jewish client king under Roman rule) vastly expanded the temple area by building retaining walls to support a flat rectangular platform around the temple site. One of these retaining walls survives to this day as the Western Wall, and the platform survives as the Temple Mount.\nThe Great Jewish Revolt against Roman rule broke out in 66 CE. Its failure resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. A second failed revolt (132-136 CE, led by Simon Bar Kochba) led to Jews being banned from entering Jerusalem, a policy which continued for most of the time until the Muslim conquest.\nFor the following five centuries, the city remained under Roman/Byzantine rule. Under Emperor Constantine I in the 4th century, Jerusalem became a center for Christianity, with the construction of sites such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Muslim forces conquered Jerusalem in the year 638. According to tradition, their leader Caliph Umar visited Jerusalem and established the Temple site as a place of prayer. By the end of the 7th century, a subsequent caliph, Abd al-Malik, had commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock on this spot, as well as al-Aqsa Mosque on the southern edge of the Temple Mount. Muslim traditions vary about whether Muhammad's flight to heaven was from the Dome of the Rock or from al-Aqsa.\nIn the four hundred years that followed, Jerusalem's prominence diminished as Muslim powers in the region jockeyed for control. In 1099 the First Crusade captured Jerusalem. The crusaders killed almost all Jews still living in the Holy Land as well as a large portion of the Muslims. Immigration from Europe only partially compensated for this loss in population as many crusaders left after the fighting was over. The Knights Templar were established in Jerusalem and had their official headquarters on the Temple Mount. The Muslim ruler Saladin reconquered Jerusalem in 1187, but between 1228 and 1244, it was given by Saladin's descendant al-Kamil to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Jerusalem fell again in 1244 to the Khawarizmi Turks, who in 1260 were replaced by the Egyptian Mamelukes. In 1517, Jerusalem fell to the Ottoman Turks, who then controlled the Holy Land until the First World War. The current Old City walls were built by the Ottomans shortly after 1517.\nIn the 1860s, new neighborhoods were built outside the walls for the first time. This expansion of Jerusalem was fueled both by general urbanization and by immigration, as Jews and Muslims and to a lesser extent Christians came to Jerusalem for its spiritual and cultural significance. By the late 19th century, Jerusalem had a Jewish plurality. The 19th century also saw a weakening of the Ottoman Empire, and major European powers like France and Russia tried to play the role of \"Guardian of the Holy Sites\" and protector of both the local Christians and pilgrimage. One consequence of those power struggles was the Crimean War, another a seemingly fragile \"status quo\" regarding the Christian Holy Sites that while sometimes seemingly ridiculous (one stipulation is that a certain ladder must not be moved) has nonetheless kept conflicts to a minimum and allowed pilgrimages to occur surprisingly smoothly despite all the political turmoil the region experiences.\nIn 1917, the British Army captured the city. The League of Nations, through its 1922 ratification of the Balfour Declaration, entrusted the United Kingdom to administer the Mandate of Palestine as a Jewish national home. The period of the Mandate saw the construction of new garden suburbs in the western and northern parts of the city, and the establishment of institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University.\nAs the British Mandate of Palestine was expiring, the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended \"the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a corpus separatum under the administration of the United Nations.\" However, this plan was rejected by the Arabs. At the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem found itself divided between Israel and Jordan (then known as Transjordan). The ceasefire line established through the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan cut through the center of the city. In 1949, west Jerusalem became Israel's capital. After the 1967 war, all of Jerusalem was claimed by Israel as its capital. Israel has since annexed the entirety of East Jerusalem and treats it as part of its territory and distinct from the West Bank (though few other countries accept this annexation). Arab residents of East Jerusalem can apply for Israeli citizenship, but for various reasons few have actually made use of that option.\n\n## Demographics\nJerusalem's population of around 800,000 is about 62% Jewish, 35% Muslim, 2% Christian, and 1% other. Neighborhoods tend to be overwhelmingly Jewish or Muslim; there are few really mixed neighborhoods, though many neighborhoods have a small minority of people from other religions. However, it is common for people of all religions to meet in the workplace. The Jewish population is a mix of cultures, with many immigrants from the former USSR, North Africa, Iraq, Eastern Europe, the US, and other places. Due to Jerusalem's religious significance, clergy and laypeople from many groups have moved to Jerusalem and continue to do so. A notable past example were the Temple Society, a group of German Pietists who were expelled before World War II but whose \"German colony\" still stands.\nJerusalem is generally regarded by Israelis to be a conservative and religious city, in contrast to liberal Tel Aviv. Compared especially to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem is noted for its large number of religious Jews, ranging from Conservative Jews to the Haredim ('ultra-Orthodox'). Haredim also tend to self-segregate for various reasons and you'll find most of them in a few overwhelmingly Haredi neighborhoods.\nThe demographic history of Jerusalem over the last two hundred years is interesting and somewhat contentious. Jerusalem became a plurality Jewish city in the 19th century, and was a majority Jewish city throughout the British Mandate. However, then as now many Jerusalem Jews were Haredi and rejected Zionism. The 1948 war led to the forced displacement of all Jews (Zionist or not, immigrant or rooted in the area for centuries) from East Jerusalem and the Old City, including the historic Jewish quarter. From 1948-1967 the Jordanian government prohibited Jews from living in East Jerusalem and tried to erase traces of the Jewish past. Some Jews who have settled in East Jerusalem since 1967 see their actions thus as nothing but a \"return\" after the forced absence under Jordanian control. Arabs (whether Chrisitian or Muslim) living in East Jerusalem in 1967 were given a status as permanent residents and an option to acquire Israeli citizenship should they want it. However, most have rejected Israeli citizenship for various reasons.\n\n## Climate\nLocated near the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea, Jerusalem has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Due to its relatively high elevation (600 m-800 m above sea level) Jerusalem's air is less humid and more pleasant than in most other parts of Israel.\nWinters are often wet, with nearly all of Jerusalem's annual 590 mm (23 in) of precipitation occurring between October and April. However, in between the rainy days there are numerous clear and sunny days. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 12 °C (53 °F) and an average low of 4 °C (39 °F). Sub-freezing temperatures are rare, but do happen, and the city will get occasional snowfall during the winter, though it usually only lasts a matter of hours rather than days. Once every few years, the city will experience significant accumulating snow.\nSummers are hot and dry as a bone with virtually no rainfall between the months of May and September. Temperatures will generally approach around 30 °C (88 °F) during the day and cool to around 15 °C (59 °F) at night. Being near the desert, there is often a big difference between the day and night temperatures, and even the hottest days can turn into chilly nights. Spring and fall are mild, with minimal rainfall and pleasant temperatures, though heat-waves are not unheard of. Most evenings and nights are quite windy and long pants and a shirt are recommended.\n\n## Talk\nThe main languages spoken in Jerusalem are Hebrew in West Jerusalem and Arabic in East Jerusalem. Remember that Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left. Some Haredi (ultra Orthodox) Jews speak Yiddish in daily life, in part because they see using Hebrew for mundane things as blasphemous.\nThere is a significant number of Jews speaking Russian or French. Smaller groups of Jews speak Dutch and Spanish. It is not uncommon to see signs in Russian or hear Russian language radio.\nMost people in the tourist areas of the city speak English that is sufficient for communication. In particular, English is widely spoken in the areas most visited by tourists, especially in the Old City. Usually, even if you don't find an English speaker on your first try, there will be one nearby. There is also a relatively large number of Jews who have immigrated to Jerusalem from English-speaking countries, and in the tourist areas of Jewish Jerusalem they make up about a quarter of the population.\n\n## By plane\nIsrael's main entry point for the international traveler, 32.00944434.8827781 Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV IATA), is next to the highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Highway 1). Travel from the airport to the center of Jerusalem takes 40–50 minutes, or more if there is traffic.\nBy train - A train line from the airport to Jerusalem opened in 2018. See \"By train\" below.\nBy bus - Route 485 (Afikim) runs between the airport terminal and Jerusalem. As of November 2022, it only runs on late Thursday nights/Friday mornings (previously it ran 24/6 excluding Shabbat), and one can expect that the 485 will be eliminated entirely once the current train construction project finishes. The 485 runs nonstop from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, then makes a few more stops in the Knesset/museums area. It departs hourly, on the hour, in both directions, and costs ₪16 (you pay the driver when boarding). After getting off in Jerusalem, you can take the local bus, light rail, or taxi to your final destination. The bus stop towards the airport is on 31.7888535.204321 220 Yafo St., just outside the central bus station, 100–150 m east of the main bus station exit.\nBy taxi - The official Jerusalem-airport taxi price is around ₪250 during the day, ₪300 late at night. You might be able to find a driver for somewhat cheaper, but chances are they will drive recklessly. If you order in advance, companies like Daka 99[dead link] may offer rates as low as ₪160. Your taxi driver may either take Highway 1 or road 443 (which goes through the West Bank).\nBy shuttle - The 'Nesher' shared taxi service (+972 2 623 1231 - Hebrew and English) is a 10-seat minibus that runs approximately hourly services to/from the airport, 24/7. Fare is around ₪70 one way per person. From the airport, the shuttle waits on the curb outside the Terminal 3 arrival hall - follow signage to the Jerusalem shuttle. The shuttle departs when full, and will take you to the address of your choice in Jerusalem. Going to the airport, you must reserve your seat in advance by phone. Be on time for the pickup — they don't wait. Nesher is known for rude customer service, and for a long nauseating ride as the other 9 passengers are dropped off at their addresses before you (you always seem to be last!). Keep in mind that it is quicker, more comfortable, and usually cheaper to take the 485 bus, and a local taxi between the bus station and your hotel.\nSome Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are seen as \"no go zones\" by Israeli Jews, and some taxi drivers, including shared taxis, may hesitate or even refuse to take you to these destinations. You should understand that it is only because they genuinely fear for their own safety. If you have a hard time finding a taxi to East Jerusalem, take a taxi from the airport to the Jerusalem central bus station, and there switch to a local taxi.\nTaxi drivers, including shared taxis, have been known to overcharge or shortchange, so check the price before boarding, and check your change when it is handed back to you.\nBuses and trains do not run from Friday after 4 PM to 8 PM on Saturday. Taxis and the Nesher shuttle operate, but might charge you extra due to Shabbat time.\nIf you see Atarot Airport on old maps, it is a small airport 11 kilometers (7 miles) north of the Old City, which has not been used for international flights since the Six-Day War, and has been closed since 2001 and is about to be demolished.\n\n## By train\nIn general, see rail.co.il for fares and timetables.\n31.78821935.2024392 Jerusalem-Yitzhak Navon station (next to the Central Bus Station).      (updated Feb 2025)\nSince its launch in 2018, the train has been the most convenient way to get to the city from Tel Aviv and the airport. The train journey time from Tel Aviv is 35 minutes, and 20 minutes from Tel Aviv Airport. The train to Jerusalem runs every 30 minutes Sunday to Thursday. Except for the night trains between midnight and 6AM which run every hour. (Except for the nights between Tuesday and Wednesday and between Friday and Saturday when there are no night trains) On Friday, the train runs every hour until 2PM in winter or until 4PM in summer, and on Saturday from 8PM time in winter or 10PM in summer.\n\n## By bus\nBuses are the main form of public transportation in areas not served by the light rail. Jewish and Arab bus companies run separate bus networks in Jerusalem, serving Jewish and Arab neighborhoods respectively, although there is some overlap.\nThe Arab bus network, in East Jerusalem, is run by Al-Safariat Al-Mowahadda (\"The united traveling service\"). It mainly consists of lines running radially to Arab neighborhoods from two bus stations near Damascus Gate.\nThe Jewish bus network is run by three bus companies, which are:\n\"Egged\", which serves the southern parts Jerusalem along with some lines in the northern parts of Jerusalem,\n\"Superbus\", which operates the trunk lines, and\n\"Extra\", which serves the northern parts of Jerusalem.\nIt serves everywhere in West Jerusalem, as well as the Old City and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. It is more useful for tourists, and also easier to get information about. Unlike Arab buses, its fare is integrated with the light rail (one ticket will get you unlimited rides on bus and light rail for 90 minutes after your first boarding). Also unlike Arab buses, Jewish buses do not operate on the Sabbath.\nMost routes run every 15–20 minutes or better. City buses have a fixed fare of ₪5.9, paid upon boarding. Keep your receipt as proof of payment in case of inspection.\nYou must use \"Rav Kav\" for payment. Note, you can't pay the driver.\n\n## By shared taxi\nOn the Sabbath, and very late at night, your only option other than a private taxi is a sherut (shared taxi). These depart from Tel Aviv's Central Bus Station and Ben Gurion Airport, and charge a small surcharge on top of the normal bus fare. As of mid-2012 a sherut costs ₪23 (₪28 at night, ₪33 at Shabbat) and drops you off downtown, not far from Zion Square. There are no Israeli sherut lines within Jerusalem (unlike most Israeli cities). But there are sherut lines to Tel Aviv and Beit Shemesh as well as the airport.\nShared taxis are also the best option if travelling between Jerusalem and Palestinian cities in the West Bank, especially Ramallah and Bethlehem. These leave from near the East Jerusalem bus terminals outside the Damascus Gate. There is a shared taxi direct to/from the Allenby bridge (The border crossing with Jordan), for (Feb 2019) ₪42 plus ₪5 per luggage or 10 JD for 1 seat plus 1 luggage (picking up from Al-Souq Al-Tijaree \"The commercial souq\" not far away from the main bus station). All Palestinian shared taxis are very cheap, ₪5.00 for the surrounding villages, ₪5.50 for Abu-Dis and ₪6.50 for Ramallah.\n\n## Get around\nGetting around Jerusalem used to be tricky, time-consuming, and frustrating as the terrain and age of the city left clogged roads unable to handle modern population numbers. The building of the light rail line has mitigated this but where the light rail doesn't go the going may still be slow.\n\n## By taxi\nCabs are plentiful in the city of gold. You can probably flag one down quickly by walking to the nearest busy street. Just in case this doesn't work, it is good to have the number of a cab company ready, or to install the Gett smartphone app.\nBe warned as the drivers may try to rip you off by \"taking the scenic route\" or charging a fixed price instead of on the meter. Insist that the driver turns on the meter (moneh) and you should have no problems. If the driver will not activate the meter, get out and take a different one. If you have the meter on, cabs are relatively cheap.\nNote that a private taxi is called \"moneet\" in Hebrew, and \"taxi\" by Arabs. Both differ from the shared taxi (\"sherut\" or \"servees\"), which runs fixed routes for many people like a bus. However, unlike buses sherut do not take rav-kav.\n\n## By car\nDriving a car in Jerusalem is not recommended. In the central areas (roughly between the Central Bus Station and the Old City), the main streets are mostly reserved for public transportation, and the streets cars can go on are narrow and very confusing to navigate.  Then, when you reach your destination, there will be no place to park your car.  Elsewhere in the city, it is easy to drive, but still hard to find parking. If you can't use public transportation, taxis are probably a better option than cars.\nIf you insist on visiting the Old City by car, park in the Karta garage in Mamilla, close to Jaffa Gate. Only Old City residents are allowed to drive into the Old City.\n\n## By light rail\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail line opened in 2011. It links the north-eastern neighborhoods to the south-western neighborhoods, runs along the western side of the Old City, and passes through the city center. There are plans to construct additional lines. Its opening after long delays and controversy (not least because it crosses the 1949 armistice line) was a godsend for transportation in the city and where it does go, it is easily the best option.\nThe light rail runs past many areas of interest to tourists. Listed from east to west:\nthe Old City (Damascus Gate and City Hall stations)\nthe West Jerusalem city center - King George and Ben Yehuda streets (Jaffa Center station)\nthe Mahaneh Yehuda market (Mahane Yehuda station)\nthe Central Bus Station (Central Station)\nMount Herzl and Yad Vashem (Mount Herzl station)\nThe ticket price is the same as bus fare (₪5.9) with free transfers between them. When you get on, tap your Rav-kav card against the reader and make sure a green light is displayed.\nThe light rail runs from about 05:30 to midnight. Its frequency is every 6 minutes during the day and less often at night. Like buses, it does not run on the Sabbath.\n\n## On foot\nWhile Jerusalem is built in a mountainous area, the central areas of the city are rather flat and very walkable. Due to the altitude, the humidity level of Jerusalem is much lower than most cities in Israel, making walking quite pleasant. The Old City has to be toured by foot, not only because it is more impressive this way, but also because its narrow lanes and alleyways are mostly inaccessible to cars.\n\n## By bike\nJerusalem has bike paths, but the rights of cyclists are not always respected: you will frequently find bike paths blocked, and drivers will expect cyclists to give right of way, though they will not intentionally harm you if you force the right of way.\nBike rentals are available at the Abraham Hostel (67 Hanevi'im, Davidka square), as well as at Bilu Bikes (7 Bilu), among other places.\nA bike sharing program called Jerufun, including both regular and e-bikes, exists in the city. There are various subscription options as well as one-time rental. The program has fairly good coverage in Western Jerusalem.\nBike Jerusalem. This 3-5 hour guided tour covers most of Jerusalem's historical neighborhoods, including many places that most visitors never get to see. The tour includes The Knesset, The Valley of the Cross, Rehavia and Talbia, The German Colony, Mishkanit Shananim, Jaffa Gate the Russian Compound and Nachlaot. The ride goes through side streets, short cuts and alleys. Despite the hills around Jerusalem, the ride in the city is not as hard as people tend to think, and the ride can be modified to suit families and inexperienced riders. The Jerusalem Night ride includes a ride through the empty streets of the Old City.\n\n## See\nJerusalem has an amazing array of attractions for the traveler to see. The following are some of the must-sees. For more attractions see individual district articles.\n\n## Old City\nThe Old City is the atmospheric historical core of Jerusalem, surrounded by Ottoman period walls, filled with sites of massive religious significance and a bustling approach to life. (Please note that some sites, particularly Islamic ones, may bar members of other religions from entry or praying on the grounds.)\nThe most iconic site in Jerusalem is the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary, which is holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. Jews all around the world usually face the Temple Mount when they pray. It is crowned by the magnificent gold-and-blue Dome of the Rock, which stands on the site of the ancient Jewish Temples. It also includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque (The Far Mosque), from where the Muslim prophet Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven.\nThe Western Wall (Jewish) is a retaining wall of the Temple Mount, built 2000 years ago. It is the closest place Jews can go to the site of the Temple, so for hundreds of years it has been a destination for prayer, and for placing notes with prayers in the cracks between the wall's stones.\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre (Christian). At the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of the sorrows) in the Christian quarter of the Old City. It is the holiest site in the world for Christians. The first church on the site was built by Queen Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, the Holy Sepulchre is Jerusalem's number 1 site for Christian pilgrims and is consequently horribly crowded. Expect to queue for an hour or more to enter the tiny tomb chamber.\nThe Jewish Quarter was completely re-built in 1969 after it came under Israeli control in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It still holds many ancient masterpieces such as the Hezekiah's wall (700 BCE), Burnt House (70 CE), Cardo (550 CE), and Western Wall. At the Western Wall plaza you will find The Western Wall Tunnel and the Chain of Generations center. The nearby archaeological park Davidson Centre (the Ophel) is also interesting. Inside the quarter are The Hurba Synagogue, the largest synagogue in the old city, and The Herodian Quarter museum.\nVia Dolorosa - passing through Bethesda (crusader church and Roman excavations), Franciscan Archaeological Museum and Les Seurs de Sion Monastery with its underground Roman Street\nDamascus Gate is the most elaborate gate.

There are two different routes: the northern route starts from inside the old city by the Jaffa gate and circles the Christian quarter and the Muslim quarter. The southern route starts from outside the Jaffa gate and circles the Armenian quarter and the Jewish quarter.\nWestern Wall Tunnels is a tour that is well worth your time. The guides there are well versed in the history of the wall and the explanation of the first two temples and the subsequent construction of the Dome of the Rock will create a great picture of the conflict between relevant cultures. Reservations are recommended, but individual walk-ins can sometimes be squeezed in.\nThe City of David water tunnels tour is interesting. It is located down the road from the Dung Gate (near the Western Wall), follow the signs. The tour lasts around 2 hours and starts with a description of the City of David. It culminates in a 25 minute walk through the water channel cut to bring fresh water into Jerusalem from a nearby spring. Sandals and a torch are required! The water is ankle deep for most of the tour.\nMahane Yehuda is the main outdoor market of West Jerusalem. Large, loud, and labyrinthine, the market boasts a huge number of stalls, generally open Sunday to Thursday 08:00-20:00, and F 08:00-15:00, closed Shabbat. Fresh produce, pastries, spices, salads abound. Definitely the place for a bargain and a unique insight into traditional Israeli culture. When the shops close in the evening, the night life opens up - in the last few years the Shuk has become a destination for bars, restaurants, and music at night.\nJerusalem is an amazing city for children and children's events.

While the Old City walls always look dramatic, they look even more spectacular for one week each June, when artists from around the world come and illuminate the Old City with their creations. Every year this festival is more popular, and involves more of the Old City, than the year before.\nHutzot HaYotzer - International Arts and Crafts Festival. A large fair featuring hundreds of artists and artisans displaying and selling their works, as well as performances, concerts, and other events.

The center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). The campus offers tours of the main building, and hosts weekly concerts.\n\n## Buy\nIf shopping in the Old City's markets, where almost anything can be found, be prepared to haggle. You will find beautiful and unique gifts here including jewelry, bed covers, statues, and spices, as well as more touristy goods like T-shirts with memorably funny designs.\nFor Judaica, the Old City's Jewish Quarter, Mea Shearim (dress modestly), Ben Yehudah St, and Emek Refaim are good places to look.\nThe new city center, around the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, is a great place to buy things and just hang out.\nThe Mamilla pedestrian mall just outside Jaffa Gate is a picturesque place to walk, and has a good selection of upscale international clothing stores.\n\n## Eat\nJerusalem, being a multicultural city, has food from all countries, cultures and tastes. Besides the ubiquitous falafel stands, there is European, Ethiopian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern food. There is also a large range of prices, from the ritzy Mamilla and Emek Refaim, to falafel stands surrounding Machaneh Yehuda and the Central Bus Station. A good rule of thumb is to look for restaurants filled with Hebrew or Arabic speaking locals. For falafel, the busiest place is probably the best, because falafel balls become less tasty the longer they are waiting out of the deep fryer.\nIf you keep kosher, Jerusalem is a wonderful place to visit. In the Jewish sections of the city almost everything is kosher. However you should still check for the kashrut certificate on the wall. If you don't see it and the staff cannot show it to you, it's a good sign to move along. The certificate is stamped בשרי (\"basari\", meat) or חלבי (\"halavi\", dairy). The current Jerusalem certificates are cream colored for normal certification, light purple for stricter certification (\"mehuderet\"), and marbled brown colored for strictest supervision (\"mehadrin\"). Certificates are valid for 6 or 12 months at a time (typically until Pesach or Rosh Hashana) with the expiration date prominently marked. Note it is not unusual for it to take a few days to get the new certificate up. In Haredi areas, the municipal kashrut certificate may be missing, but a certificate from a local Haredi organization will be provided. Also note that only some branches of McDonalds in Jerusalem are kosher. Kosher branches have yellow arches on a blue background, rather than the usual red background.\nDespite its name, the \"Jerusalem artichoke\" has no connection to Jerusalem, and you won't find it used more widely here than elsewhere.\nHowever, there is an authentic Jerusalem food - the Jerusalem mixed grill (me'orav yerushalmi), which was invented in the 1960s at one of the steakhouses near the Mahaneh Yehuda market and has since spread widely across Israel. It consists of a mixture of spicy grilled meat chunks including chicken breasts, hearts, and livers, and pieces of lamb. Nowadays you can get it as fast food wrapped in pita or laffa bread, or as a main course in sit-down restaurants. One famous place is Steakiyat Hatzot, Agrippas street; check out the photos on the wall.\n\n## Drink\nMost of the nightclubs and bars are in West Jerusalem, mostly in the city center or Talpiyot district. Consult the district article for specifics.\nIf you are looking for alcohol stores, there is one right by the Jaffa gate and several on Jaffa Rd. One of the stores by the Generali building (located on the right side on Jaffa when you're facing the building) stocks a wide variety of different beers and also has great prices, lower than that of other stores.\n\n## Sleep\nThe Old City has a diverse mix of small hotels, religious hospices and cheap hostels. The cheapest accommodation is found here.\nWest Jerusalem has a blend of B&Bs, guesthouses, small hotels and large hotels up to 5-star accommodation, including the famous King David Hotel, which is worth visiting for its architecture even if you don't stay there.\n\n## Connect\nWith the rise of cell phones, public telephones hardly exist but they take prepaid phone cards which can be purchased at post offices, shops and lottery kiosks. They are available in the following denominations: 20 units (₪13), 50 units (₪29), or 120 units (₪60). Calls made on Saturdays and Friday evenings are 25% cheaper than the standard rate.\nCoin-phones (usually ₪1) are also available. Those are private \"public phones\", owned and operated by shop owners.\nIsraeli Post offices are available for service from 08:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00 (Su-Th) though hours may vary per branch.\nThe central post office for West Jerusalem is located near the head of Jaffa Road, close to the municipality offices. Open until 19:00.\nIn the Old City, post offices can be found in the Armenian Quarter near the Jaffa Gate, diagonally opposite the Tower of David Museum, as well as the Jewish Quarter on Plugat Ha-Kotel near the Broad Wall.\nA post office is in a small shopping mall on King George Street, immediately south of Jaffa street.\nIsrael uses the red British \"pillar\" post boxes in some areas of Jerusalem, a reminder of the previous British Mandate.\nAlternatively, most inexpensive cell phone plans include a few GB per month of internet data.\n\n## Stay safe\nIn the case of injury or other emergency incidents, Police services can be reached by dialing 100, Ambulance services can be reached by dialing 101, and the Fire Department can be reached by dialing 102. All emergency services employ English-speaking operators.\nDespite alarming news headlines, Jerusalem is relatively safe for tourists. Nonetheless, Palestinians have attacked Israeli police officers and Jewish civilians, primarily with knives. Jews have committed similar attacks on Arabs, and in one case even on Gay Pride Parade participants — so check on current conditions before you go.\nNon-rigorous security checks can be frequent, especially when entering hotels, cinemas/theaters and shopping areas. It is wise to carry some identification.\nLike anywhere in Israel, you may notice large numbers of soldiers carrying weapons. These are generally off-duty soldiers going to and from their bases, so they have nothing to do with the security situation. However, in and around the Old City there will probably be many on-duty armed police. Also, educational tours for soldiers are often conducted in the Old City, and the IDF's \"swearing in ceremony\" is held near the Western Wall.\nTourists are not usually targeted in terror attacks, and most have occurred well away from tourist sites. Naturally it is important to remain vigilant and alert.\nThere are a few areas in the city where it is important to be mindful of one's dress, religion, and time period visiting. Here are some guidelines:\nDress. When visiting any holy site or religious neighborhood one should dress modestly. For men this means long pants, a closed shirt with sleeves, and a head covering. For women, it means a skirt that falls below the knee, a shirt with elbow-length sleeves and no exposed cleavage or stomach. This applies to churches, mosques, and synagogues, as well as the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) and Western Wall (the plaza by the Wall is essentially an open-air synagogue, and there are mosques on the Temple Mount), and Haredi neighborhoods such as Mea Shearim.\nReligion. It is not safe for noticeably Jewish people (e.g. wearing a kippah or speaking Hebrew) to enter Muslim neighborhoods. This includes the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, though the heavy police presence there makes it safer. It is also somewhat unsafe for Arabs to enter Haredi neighborhoods, or to enter the Jewish city center very late at night when Jewish youth have been drinking.\nTime. Non-Muslims are not allowed on the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary) during times of Muslim prayer. During Shabbat and Jewish holidays, one should not publicly use electronic devices or smoke in any synagogue, at the Western Wall, or in any Haredi neighborhood. (Smoking is, otherwise, rather common in Israel, so nonsmokers should also be forewarned.) Driving in Haredi neighborhoods on Shabbat and Jewish holidays is not allowed, and roads may be closed off. During Ramadan, eating, drinking or smoking in the streets of Muslim areas is culturally insensitive, although tourists are rarely interfered with.\nDue to the mixture of religions, and the mixture of cultures within religions, tensions can sometimes be high. Avoid any confrontations between locals. Although extremely rare, some locals may carry xenophobic attitudes and ask foreigners to leave the area near their home. You have the right to see all of Jerusalem, but moving along to another area will resolve the situation.\nStreet crime is nearly nonexistent, although pickpockets may work in the Old City.\nOn the whole, theft is not a large-scale problem. To minimize risk, however, normal precautions apply. Do not leave valuable objects inside a car or in full view in your hotel room. There are many ATMs throughout the city and credit cards are widely accepted, so there is no need to carry large amounts of cash.\n\n## Consulates and embassies\nDue to the disputed status of Jerusalem, most countries maintaining embassies in Israel keep them in nearby Tel Aviv, with the notable exception of the United States. However, they often maintain a consulate in Jerusalem as well. The U.S. embassy moved here in 2018, and some US allies have announced an intention to either move an existing embassy to Jerusalem or open a new one here.\nGreece (Consulate), 31 Rachel Immenu, Kattamon, ☏ +972 2 561 9583, fax: +972 2 561 0325, grgencon.jer@mfa.gr.

          "title": "Hebron",
          "content": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Hebron appears to trace back to two northwest Semitic languages, which coalesce in the form ḥbr, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite, with a basic sense of 'unite' and connoting a range of meanings from 'colleague' to 'friend'. In the proper name Hebron, the original sense may have been 'alliance'.\nEarly Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra (حبرة) or Ḥabrūn (حبرون). al-Khalīl emerged as the Arabic name for the city in the 13th century, derived from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, Khalīl al-Raḥmān ('Friend of the Merciful [ie. God]'). Thus, the epithet is a calque the original Hebrew toponym Ḥeḇrōn, understood as ḥaḇēr ('friend').\n\nHistory\nBronze and Iron Age\nArchaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24–30 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age. This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city. Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, Abdi-Ḫeba, although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nAncient Israel\nThe Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a Kenite element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city, and Heber is the name for a Kenite clan. In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centers under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (benê/yelîdê hāʿănaq). or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian. This suggests that behind the Anakim legend lies some early Hurrian population. In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the Nephilim. The Book of Genesis mentions that it was formerly called Kiryath-arba, or \"city of four\", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters, four hills, or a confederated settlement of four families.\nThe story of Abraham's purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs from the Hittites constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land in that it signified the first \"real estate\" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua. In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first covenant, an alliance with two local Amorite clans who became his ba'alei brit or masters of the covenant.\nThe Hebron of the Israelites was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual center was located at Elonei Mamre. Hebrew Bible narrative also describes the city.\n\nIt is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either Joshua, who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, \"destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded\", or the Tribe of Judah as a whole, or specifically Caleb the Judahite. The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the Levites of the clan of Kohath, while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb (Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56), who expels the three giants, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has King David called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years (2 Samuel 2:1–3). It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him king of Israel. It was in Hebron again that Absalom has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David (2 Samuel 15:7–10). It became one of the principal centers of the Tribe of Judah and was classified as one of the six traditional Cities of Refuge.\nAs is shown by the discovery at Lachish, the second most important city in the Kingdom of Judah after Jerusalem, of seals with the inscription lmlk Hebron (to the king Hebron), Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic center, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the Dead Sea to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the Shepelah and the coastal plain to the west. Lying along trading routes, it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.\nAfter the destruction of the First Temple, most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view, some researchers found traces of Edomite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became Achaemenid province, and, in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquest, Hebron was throughout the Hellenistic period under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God Qōs. Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). During the Maccabean revolt, Hebron was burnt and plundered by Judah Maccabee who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE. The city appears to have long resisted Hasmonean dominance, however, and indeed as late as the First Jewish–Roman War was still considered Idumean.\n\nRoman rule\nThe present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times. Herod the Great, king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Hebron was captured and plundered by Simon Bar Giora, a leader of the Zealots, without bloodshed. The \"little town\" was later laid to waste by Vespasian's officer Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis. Josephus wrote that he \"slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town\". After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's Terebinth slave-market.\nThe city was part of the Byzantine Empire in Palaestina Prima province at the Diocese of the East. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the Sassanid general Shahrbaraz in 614 when Khosrau II's armies besieged and took Jerusalem. Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule. The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the Sassanid army.\n\nMuslim conquest and Islamic caliphate\nHebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. When the Rashidun Caliphate established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.\nCatholic bishop Arculf, who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad period, described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Baḥr Lūṭ). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass industry in the 9th century.\nHebron was almost absent from Muslim literature before the 10th century. In 985, al-Muqaddasi described Hebron (Habra) as the village of Abraham al-Khalil, with a strong fortress and a stone dome over Abraham's sepulchre. The mosque contained the tombs of Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. Surrounding the area were villages with vineyards producing exceptional grapes and apples. Hebron had a public guest house offering lentils and olive oil to both the poor and the rich. The guest house was established through the bequest of Prophet Muhammad's companions, including Tamim-al Dari, and received generous donations. It was highly regarded as an excellent house of hospitality and charity in the realm of al-Islam. The custom, known as the 'Table of Abraham' (simāt al-khalil), was similar to the one established by the Fatimids. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described Hebron in his Safarnama as having many villages providing revenues for pious purposes. He mentioned a spring flowing from under a stone, with water channeled to a covered tank outside the town. The Sanctuary stood on the town's southern border, enclosed by four walls. Barley was the primary crop, with abundant olives. Visitors were provided with bread, olives, lentils cooked in olive oil, and raisins. Hebron had numerous mills operated by oxen and mules, along with working girls baking bread. The hospitality extended to about three-pound loaves of bread and meals for every arriving person, including up to 500 pilgrims on certain days.\nThe tradition survives to this day in the form of the Takiat Ibrahim soup kitchen, which has been active in providing food for thousands over Ramadan, which coincided with food shortages during the 2024 Gaza war. Geniza documents from this period mention  \"the graves of the patriarchs\" and attest to the presence of an organized Jewish community in Hebron. The Jews maintained a synagogue near the tomb and earned their livelihood accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, known as the \"haver of the graves of the patriarchs.\"\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it \"Castellion Saint Abraham\". It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defense was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (October 17), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\nA royal domain, Hebron was handed over to Philip of Milly in 1161 and joined with the Seigneurie of Transjordan. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram. In 1167, the episcopal see of Hebron was created along with that of Kerak and Sebastia (the tomb of John the Baptist). In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited Hebron, referred to as in its Frankish name St. Abram de Bron. He mentioned the great church called St. Abram, which was once a Jewish place of worship during the time of Muslim rule. The Gentiles had erected six tombs there, claimed to be those of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah. The custodians collected money from pilgrims by presenting these tombs as the tombs of the Patriarchs. However, if a Jew offered a special reward, they would open an iron gate leading to a series of empty caves, until reaching the third cave where the actual sepulchers of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were said to be located.\nThe Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there. The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.\nIn 1244, the Khwarazmians destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1260, after Mamluk Sultan Baibars defeated the Mongol army, the minarets were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary, and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior Ayyubid rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns. The mill at Artas was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron. Between 1318 and 1320, the Na'ib of Gaza and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of Jawli Mosque to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.\n\nHebron was visited by important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them Nachmanides (1270) and Ishtori HaParchi (1322) who noted the old Jewish cemetery there. Sunni imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) was penalized by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognize Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. The Jewish-Italian traveler, Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found not more than twenty Jewish families living in Hebron. and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews. Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg's Journal (1449), by Felix Fabri (1483) and by Mejr ed-Din It was in this period, also, that the Mamluk Sultan Qa'it Bay revived the old custom of the Hebron \"table of Abraham\", and exported it as a model for his own madrasa in Medina. This became an immense charitable establishment near the Haram, distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travelers of all faiths. The Italian rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote around 1490:I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.\n\nEarly Ottoman period\nThe expansion of the Ottoman Empire along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I coincided with the establishment of Inquisition commissions by the Catholic Monarchs in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian convivencia (coexistence). The ensuing expulsions of the Jews drove many Sephardi Jews into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with  notable Sephardi kabbalists settling in Hebron. Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.\nThe Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century. In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardic Abraham Avinu Synagogue. In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the Hesed Le'Abraham yeshiva in Hebron, which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717 to 1729, and were \"almost crushed\" from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community after a false allegation that the son of a local sheikh was murdered  and thrown into a cesspit. Emissaries from the community were frequently sent overseas to solicit funds. During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated patriarchs' tombs were restored to a semblance of  dignity. Ali Bey, in Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access.  In 1807 he reported that the sepulchres were covered with carpets of green silk embroidered in gold and those of the wives were covered in red silk.The sultans of Constantinople furnished these carpets, which were renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, on the sepulchre of Abraham. Hebron also became known  for its glass production, based on Bedouin trade networks that brought up minerals from the Dead Sea. The industry is mentioned in travel literature in 19th century written by Western travelers to Palestine. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, based on 26 kilns. In 1833, a report on the town  in the weekly paper of the London-based Religious Tract Society wrote that Hebron had numerous well-provisioned shops and  produced glass lamps which were exported to Egypt. Early 19th-century travelers also noted Hebron's flourishing agriculture. It was a major exporter of dibse, grape sugar, from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.\n\nAn Arab peasants' revolt broke out in April 1834 when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population. Hebron, headed by its nazir Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and, when its defenses fell on August 4, it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army. An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.\nWhen the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem. In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (serasker), Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumored that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman, the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of Bayt Jibrin), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.\nAccording to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov wrote from Hebron that:\"the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a brit milah (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews'.\"\n\nLate Ottoman period\nBy 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardic families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazic community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian, the Lubavitch Hasidic movement having established a community in 1823. The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha led to a decline in the local glass industry. His plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, making firewood for the kilns  scarce. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass. The rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan reduced traffic to Hebron, and the Suez Canal (1869) precipitated a drop in caravan trade. The consequence was a steady deterioration of the local economy. At the time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), inhabited by Jews; the Mamluk-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west; and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah).In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha (\"governor\") of the sanjak (\"district\") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to put down a  rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, a scene witnessed by representatives of the English, French and other Western consulates. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, brother and rival of Abd al Rachman, as nazir of the Hebron region. Relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. In 1866, Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in Hebron. According to Nadav Shragai, Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. During a  severe drought in 1869–1871,  food in Hebron sold for ten times the normal amount. From 1874, the Hebron district  was administered directly from Istanbul as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem. By 1874, when C.R. Conder visited  Hebron under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Jewish community numbered  600 in an overall population of 17,000. The Jews lived in the Quarter of the Corner Gate. In the late 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glassware, although it continued to be popular among those who could not afford luxury goods  and was sold by Jewish merchants. Glass ornaments from Hebron were exhibited at the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna.\nA report from the consul of the French Consulate in Jerusalem in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly. While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, the economy of Hebron was more diverse, including agriculture and livestock herding, along with glassware manufacturing and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits. Even so, Hebron had an image of being  unproductive and  an \"asylum for the poor and the spiritual\". While the wealthy merchants of Nablus built fine mansions, housing in Hebron consisted of semi-peasant dwellings.\nHebron was described as 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic', and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook, with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews. It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, although  the Jewish and Christian communities seem to have been an integral part of  the local economy. As income from commerce declined and tax revenues diminished significantly, the Ottoman government left Hebron to manage its own affairs for the most part, making it \"one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.\" The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914. The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazi Jews. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry. The community was largely Orthodox and anti-Zionist.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nThe British occupied Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a mandate in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (waqfs), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf. During the 1920s, Abd al-Ḥayy al-Khaṭīb was appointed Mufti of Hebron. Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists. Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron. During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 percent of the political leadership. The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections. Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.\nAt this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbors, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.\n\nJordanian occupation\nAt the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed. By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armored car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.\nIn December 1948, the Jericho Conference, held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari, voted in favor of becoming part of Jordan and to recognize Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.\nAlthough a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period, Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town. During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.\n\nIsraeli period\nAfter the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace. On May 15, 2006, a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees urged the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement, and allow the return of eight families evacuated the previous January from homes they set up in emptied shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, established in 2007 under disputed circumstances, was under court orders permitting its forced evacuation. All the Jewish settlers were expelled on December 3, 2008.\n\nImmediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel. He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders. Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929. The purpose of settlement is to return to the 'land of our forefathers', and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus. Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behavior of Hebronite settlers.\n\nSheik Farid Khader heads the Ja'bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself. Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist. A violent episode occurred May 2, 1980, when an Al Fatah squad killed five yeshiva students and one other person on their way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground.\nIn the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Jewish Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behavior in other settlements. On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others. The 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to \"ensure the security of the Jewish settlers\" and that Israeli \"soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence\".\n\nOslo Accords\nHebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. IDF soldiers see their job as being to protect Israeli settlers from Palestinian residents, not to police the Israeli settlers. IDF soldiers are instructed to leave violent Israeli settlers for the police to deal with. Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites. Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 – which includes the Old City of Hebron – remained under the military control of Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. As of 2009, a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, although the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nOver the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada, and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighborhoods. On November 15, 2002, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush. Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from which the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem. In 2007, the Palestinian population in H2 declined due to Israeli security measures such as extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian businesses and settler harassment. Palestinians are barred from using Al-Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare that is locally nicknamed \"Apartheid Street\" as a result.\n\nIsraeli organization B'Tselem states that there have been \"grave violations\" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the \"presence of the settlers within the city\". The organization cites regular incidents of \"almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city\", curfews and restrictions of movement that are \"among the harshest in the Occupied Territories\", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: \"To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\" Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation. In 2017, Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of work in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incidents reported during this period, stated that Israel violated international law in Hebron and has breached the rights of residents as established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report claimed that Israel  violated Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. Israeli settlement in Hebron was also cited as a violation.\n\nGeography\nHebron is situated on the southern West Bank. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 meters (3,050 ft) above sea level. Hebron is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem, 60.1 kilometers (37.3 mi) east of Gaza, 43 kilometers (27 mi) northeast of Beersheba and 68.4 kilometers (42.5 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, both in Israel and 89.8 kilometers (55.8 mi) northeast of Amman, Jordan. The city is surrounded by Bani Na'im and Dura to the east, Halhul to the north, Taffuh to the west and Yatta to the south. The Israeli–controlled H2 region is located in the eastern region of the city.\nIt is one of the highest cities in the area and was, until the 19th century, considered the highest city in the Middle East. With the governorate and metropolitan area, it forms about 19% of the West Bank total area. The city is surrounded by several mountains and hills, including the Hebron Hills (Jabal al–Khalil) and Mount Nabi Yunis. The Mount Nabi Yunis, situated north of the city, is the highest point in Palestine, with an altitude of 1,030 meters (3,380 ft). While the Hebron Hills is southern part of the wider Judaean Mountains, which spreads throughout Israel and Palestine and have an altitude of 1,026 m (3,366 ft). The two larger settlements whose population exceeds 7000 sit on the hills overlooking the Hebron's eastern quarters – Kirayt Arba and Givat Harsina. Wadi al–Quff near Hebron is one of the largest natural reserves in Palestine. Located towards northeast of the city, it is surrounded by nearby towns and villages of Tarqumia, Halhoul, Beit Kahel and Beit Ola. The natural reserve covers up an area of 3.73 square kilometers (920 acres). Wadi al–Quff Natural reserve is home to some of the rare species of animals and plants.\nHebron is located on fertile mountainous area, making the city agriculturally rich, thus giving it a strategic importance. This is the reason for Hebron, today being a hub for cultivation of fruits and vineyards. The alternative sources of water network is cisterns. There are ten springs and three wells in the city. The water of springs and wells are not currently used. The Hebron River (Wadi al–Khalil), known as Nahal Hebron in Hebrew located along the region of Judea and Negev, is one of the water sources for the city. Currently the river is polluted, mainly due to the generation of waste, mostly by the industrial areas, situated on the city's east and south.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in Hebron is temperate and the mean year-round temperature ranges between 15 and 16° (an average of 7° in winter and 21° in summer). Annual precipitations average around 502 mm. Hebron has a Mediterranean, hot summer climate (Classification: Csa). The city's yearly temperature is 22.74 °C (72.93 °F) and it is 0.14% higher than Palestine's averages. It typically receives about 15.72 millimeters (0.62 inches) of precipitation and has 39.47 rainy days (10.81% of the time) annually, during January and February.\n\nUrban development\nHistorically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the suq and Harat al-Masharqa adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque, the Silk Merchant Quarter (Haret Kheitun) to the south and the Sheikh Quarter (Haret al-Sheikh) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.\nIn the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared. The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the Cave of Machpelah, the Haret Kheitun (the Jewish Quarter, Haret el-Yahud), the Haret el-Sheikh and the Druze Quarter. As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighborhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial center, Bab el-Zawiye, emerged. As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west. In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it. By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: el-Sheikh and Bab el-Zawiye to the west, el-Kazzazin, el-Akkabi and el-Haram in the center, el-Musharika to the south and el-Kheitun in the east. Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945. \n\nThe large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over 3 miles (5 km) at a depth of 600 ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5 km). In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded. In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site. The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin Quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site, which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.\nToday, the area along the north–south axis to the east comprises the modern city of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, Khalil Foq). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who moved there from the crowded old city, Balde al-Qadime (also called Lower Hebron, Khalil Takht). The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two luxury hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the krum, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period. The southern part is where the working-class neighborhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University. The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the center of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads that lead to the entrance of the old city. Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial center of the city, known as the vegetable market (hesbe), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of Bab el-Zawiye.\n\nDemographics\nHebron has, historically, been an Arab city but a small Jewish community has existed since the 16th century, encouraged to settle there by the Ottoman authorities following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000, including an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, and to 41 Jewish taxpayers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the Jews having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834. Its population stood at 16,577 in 1922 of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian.\nThe Jewish community was expelled from the city following the massacre of nearly 70 Jews in 1929. However, since Israel gained control of the West Bank in 1967, Hebron and eastern Jerusalem have been the only cities in the region to receive Jewish settlement.\nHebron had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017, and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City. Roughly 20% of the city, including 35,000 Palestinians, under Israeli military administration, lives in the region of H2 Hebron. The surrounding area forms the Hebron metropolitan area, with an estimated population of around 782,227 as of 2021. It is third largest metropolitan area in Palestine, after Gaza and Jerusalem.\nHebron is also home to several ethnic minority and foreign diaspora communities. Kurds have been living in the city since Saladin's conquest of Palestine. Along with Jerusalem and Gaza, the city is also home to Palestinians of Kurdish descent. Nearly a third of the population of Hebron, is considered to be of Kurdish background. The Kurdish Quarter, known as Harat al-Akrad, still exists today. Hebron is also home to a small Samaritan community, after Nablus.\n\nEconomy\nHebron is a leading commercial and industrial center in the Levantine region. The presence of minerals and resources in surroundings have increased the city's value. It emerged as in important trade hub in the West Bank. Hebron is most productive region in the country after Jerusalem–Bethlehem–Ramallah area. The H1 Area, which is under control of Palestinian Authority have been a large contributor to the city's economy. Despite having tense relations, Israelis and Palestinians have strong trade relations in Hebron. The city is popular for its ceramics and glass industry.\n\nIt is the source of 60% of stone and marble resources in the West Bank. 33% of the Palestine's GNP is from Hebron, including 60% of the jewelry industry and jewelry production, 28% of the output in the agricultural sector and 75% of the leather and shoe industry. Most agricultural products from Palestinian controlled Hebron are sent to Israel. Trade volume between Israel and the Palestine reaches $30 billion annually and the city trades with China as well. The minimum wage is 50 NIS per day versus an average of 30 NIS per day in other Palestinian areas. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the PLO made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.\n90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper, and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports. Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.\n\nThe most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Hebron is major source of import goods to Israel. Mattresses manufactured in Hebron are exported to Israeli markets in Tel Aviv, Beersheba and Haifa. Around 17,000 factories and workshops are located throughout the Area H1. Historically, the traditional glass industry is popular in Hebron. A new industrial city has been built in Tarqumiyah, which houses more than 140 factories. Royal Industrial Trading operates a pipe manufacturing plant in Hebron, which is spread across an area of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) and employs over 650 people. In 2021, an electronic recycling factory was opened in Idhna and operates to this day. The European Union and the World Bank proposed to construct a regional water treatment plant, which will treat existing sewage stream coming from 80% of the city. The city is a hub for the jewelry industry and houses approximately 70 jewelry factories employing over 1500 workers.\nSuper Nimer company manufactures sanitary ware products and water network from its factory, whose area ranges from 30,000 square meters (7.4 acres) to 45,000 square meters (11 acres). Opened in 2004, Super Tiger operates a factory spread across an area of 7 acres (28,000 m2). During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Palestine, Hebron rapidly transformed into a medical supplies manufacturing hub, with numerous factories installing and commissioning new production lines for the product and was approved by the Ministry of National Economy.\n\nPolitical status\nUnder the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition. The aftermath of the 1948 war saw the city occupied and later unilaterally annexed by the kingdom of Jordan in a move supported by local Hebron officials. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 percent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.\nAn international unarmed observer force—the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.\nThe post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the Mercaz HaRav Kook, which consider the Land of Israel and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to Abraham, King David, and the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Settling in Hebron is seen as a right and duty, a favor to the world, and an example of being \"a light unto the nations\" (Or la-Goyim).  This viewpoint has resulted in numerous violent clashes with Palestinians, which some settlers see as contributing to the messianic process.\n\nOccupation and settlements\nIn 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of Israelis, disguised as tourists, rented the main hotel in Hebron and refused to leave. The government initially wanted to evacuate the settlers but eventually allowed them to relocate to a nearby military base, which became the settlement of Kiryat Arba. After lobbying efforts, the settlement gained support from some Israeli leaders. Over time, the settlement expanded with the outpost Givat Ha'avot. The operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel. In 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron before 1948 and are not entitled to compensation for their losses. Originally named Hesed l'Avraham, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Baghdadi Jewish families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America, which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all. In 1979, a group of 15 settler mothers and their 35 children squatted in the Dabouia building in Hebron, exploiting the government's indecision during negotiations with Egypt. Led by Miriam Levinger, they established a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement and created conflict with Arab shopkeepers. A retaliatory attack by a Palestinian group resulted in the death of six yeshiva students. Despite appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the settlers remained. The following year, the government legitimized residency in Hebron and expelled the elected mayor. This pattern of settlement followed by hostilities with Palestinians was repeated in Tel Rumeida.\nThe Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the center of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed. The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighboring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return. Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students. In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir. In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.\nIn 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation. The IDF, in accordance with settler demands, requested the removal of a Palestinian flag on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice. According to Palestinians, the IDF negotiated the removal of the flag in exchange for the release of a resident of Hebron from legal custody. In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of Plugat Hamitkanim in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s. In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighborhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.\n\nCulture\nTourism\nHebron is home to numerous mosques, synagogues, churches, parks, palaces, castles and forts. The Old City of Hebron was a declared a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO on July 7, 2017. The move caused controversies and faced opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it being called as Palestinian site, instead of Israeli. It is one of the best preserved sites of the Mamluk era.\n\nThe most famous site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The site is known for the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah respectively. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue.\nThe tombs of other biblical figures – Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse are also located in the city. It is reverred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. These sites are located in the H2 region, which is controlled by the Israeli authorities.\nThe early Ottoman-era Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city's historic Jewish Quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.\nMosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque.\nHebron is also home to several sites for Christian worship, with numerous churches located around the city. The Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925. Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas.\nOther sites:\n\nSituated on the northeast of the city, Wadi al–Quff Natural Reserve is visited by 2,000 people, mostly on weekends. It is currently under the management of the Palestinian government.\nAristobolia (Khirbet Istanbul), in south of Hebron, near Zif village, is home to Byzantine-era basilica, built during the beginning of Islamic era.\nKhirbet al–Karmil is home to Crusader pool, ruined Byzantine church and Crusader fortress.\nAs-Samu is an ancient biblical village, currently a modern town. It is home to 4th century synagogue, numerous Ottoman-era structure and an Islamic building, probably built during the time of Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.\n\nReligious traditions\nSome Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron. A tradition arose in medieval Jewish texts that the Cave of the Patriarchs itself was the very entrance to the Garden of Eden. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune. Others report that the soil was harvested for export as a precious medicinal spice in Egypt, Arabia, Ethiopia and India and that the earth refilled after every digging. Legend also tells that Noah planted his vineyard on Mount Hebron. In medieval Christian tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where Elizabeth was said to live, the legend implying that it might have been the birthplace of John the Baptist.\nOne Islamic tradition has it that Muhammad alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes. Another tradition states that Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari's domain; this was implemented during Umar's reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the waqf of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them. The simat al-Khalil or \"Table of Abraham\" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveler Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman imarets — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.\nAccording to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the diasporic thrust of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.\n\nGallery\nTwin towns / sister cities\nHebron is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nShabab Al-Khalil SC, the town's football team\nPalestinian Child Arts Center\nList of burial places of biblical figures\nList of people from Hebron\nOak of Mamre, Christian holy site, historically near Hebron but now inside the city, distinct from the Terebinth of Mamre\nAbraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, Russian Orthodox monastery at the \"Oak of Mamre\"\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nwww.hebron-city.ps\nPhotographs of Hebron\nenglish Hebron.com – English\nCollection of Palestinian articles on Hebron published by \"This Week in Palestine\"\nSephardic Studies 1839 Sephardic census of Ottoman-controlled Hebron.\nArchNet.org. \"Hebron\".

          "summary": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.",

          "content": "الخَلِيل مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة الخليل إداريًا، تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الجنوب من القدس بحوالي 35 كم. أسسها الكَنعَانِيون في العصر البرونزي المبكر، وتُعد اليوم أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية من حيث عدد السكان والمساحة، حيث بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2016 بقرابة 215 ألف نسمة، وتبلغ مساحتها 42 كم2. تمتاز المدينة بأهمية اقتصادية، حيث تُعد من أكبر المراكز الاقتصادية في الضفة الغربية. وللخليل أهمية دينية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث، حيث يتوسط المدينة المسجد الإبراهيمي الذي يحوي مقامات للأنبياء إبراهيم، وإسحق، ويعقوب، وزوجاتهم.\nتُقسم مدينة الخليل حاليّاً إلى البلدة القديمة والحديثة، وتديرها بلدية الخليل التي أُسِّسَت عام 1927، كما أنها مركز محافظة الخليل التي يضم التقسيم الإداري الحالي لها العشرات من القرى والبلدات، ويُقدر عدد سكان المحافظة بأكثر من 684 ألف نسمة (2014). تقع البلدة القديمة بمحاذاة المسجد الإبراهيمي. وهي عبارة عن أزقّة وبيوت ودكاكين قديمة، وتضم العديد من الأسواق. تقوم إسرائيل بإغلاق أجزاء كبيرة منها وتنشر قوات من الجيش الإسرائيلي فيها لوجود تجمّع حديث لليهود الأرثوذكس يسعى للسيطرة على العقارات في تلك المنطقة. تسيطر إسرائيل على حوالي 20% من مساحة المدينة بحسب إتفاق إعادة الإنتشار في الخليل في عام 1997، ولكن تتحمل السلطة الفلسطينية إدارة الشؤون المدنية للفلسطينيين فيها. يحيط بالمدينة أيضًا الكثير من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، أكبرها مستوطنة كريات أربع، والمستوطنات والتجمعات اليهودية تحتكم لجسم بلدي منفصل. وتعد المدينة من المدن المقدسة الأربع في الديانة اليهودية.\nفي السابع من تموز 2017، أدرجت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة «اليونسكو» البلدة القديمة في مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على قائمة التراث العالمي المُهدد بالخطر بوصفها منطقة تُعرف بقيمتها العالمية، وقد حصلت مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على أغلبية أصوات الدول المشاركة في التصويت الذي جرى في مدينة كراكوف البولندية.\n\nالتسمية\nسُميَّت مدينة الخليل بهذا الاسم نسبةً إلى نبي الله إبرَاهِيم الخليل، حيث يُعتقد انه سكنها في منطقة الحرم الإبراهيمي بعد هجرته من مدينة أور السومرية. كانت تسمى بقرية أربع نسبة إلى ملك كنعاني اسمه أربع، وسميت بعدها حبرون لأحد سببين، إما نسبة للملك عفرون الحثي الكنعاني الذي باع المغارة لـ إبراهيم، حسب الرواية التوراتية، بأربعمائة شواقل وكان الشاقل العملة الكنعانية، وإما لكونها كلمة مشتقة من كلمة «حافير» العبرية أو الخليل بالعربية. سمّيت فيما بعد بالخليل ويبلغ عدد سكانها 320,000 نسمة.\n\nالتاريخ\nتُعتبر مدينة الخليل من المدن العربية القليلة التي حافظت على استمرارية الاستقرار البشري. والخليل هي مدينة مقدسة لليهود والمسلمين والمسيحيين. كما أنها معروفة باعتبارها مدينة الآباء. يعتقد بعض الناس أن إبراهيم، أب الأديان الإبراهيمية، قد عاش في الخليل عام 1800 قبل الميلاد أو نحو ذلك. يعتقدون أيضا أنه قد اشترى المغارة التي بني عليها المسجد الإبراهيمي/ مغارة مكفيلا، حيث يعتقدون أن إبراهيم قد دفن هناك وزوجته سارة، وابنهما إسحاق وحفيدهما يعقوب. على مر التاريخ، كانت هنالك فترات لأغلبية مسلمة، من الذين عاشوا في مدينة الخليل إلى جانب أقليات من اليهود.\n\nوُجدت في الخليل آثار تشير إلى وجود مدني في العصر البرونزي المبكر (في حدود النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد) وكانت المدينة في الأصل مدينة كنعانية جليلة مترفة، وسيطرت عليها - كما في بقية فلسطين- العديد من القوى، من الأشوريين عام 732 ق.م والبابليين عام 586 ق.م والفرس عام 539 ق.م والإغريق عام 322 ق.م، وإنتزعها منهم الرومان عام 63 ق.م. ثم انتقلت لقبضة البيزنطيين عام 593 م إلاّ أنّ الفرس احتلوها منهم لبضع سنوات، ثمّ عاد الروم البيزنطيون فاستعادوها مرة أخرى، وأخرجوا الفرس منها، وانتقلت لسيطرة العرب المسلمين في القرن السابع الميلادي. ضمّها الصليبيون لممالكهم عام 1167م حتى هزيمتهم بعد معركة حطين سنة 1187م أمام جيش صلاح الدين الأيوبي ونقل إليها منبر عسقلان العاجي. لاحقا تطورت المدينة في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني، واشتهرت في عصر العثمانيين بصناعة القناديل والزجاج الملوّن، وبلغ من تقدمها آنذاك أن شاركت في المعرض العالمي الذي أقيم في فينا عام 1873م، حيث عرضت صناعات الخليل من أدوات الزينة المصنوعة من الزجاج الملوّن، كما ازدهرت في فترة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين، حيث أسست بلدية الخليل عام 1927م. وخلال حرب 1948، وقع نصف قضاء الخليل ضمن حدود إسرائيل دون المدينة، حيث فقد القضاء معظم قراه وبلداته وأخصب أراضيه الواقعة غربًا، وأخضعت المدينة للإدارة الأردنية عام 1950م. وفي حرب 1967 استكملت إسرائيل احتلال المحافظة بما فيها المدينة، وقامت بمصادرة جزء كبير من المدينة لإسكان المستوطنين اليهود فيها، وخاصة في البلدة القديمة.].\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nتُعد الخليل من أقدم مدن العالم، وتاريخها يعود إلى 5500 عام. بناها الكنعانيون وأطلقوا عليها اسم (قرية أربع) نسبة إلى بانيها (أربع) وهو أبو عَناق أعظم العناقيين، وكانوا يوصفون بالجبابرة، ولما جاء يوشع بن نون غير اسم قرية أربع إلى حيرون نسبة إلى أحد أولاد كالب بن يفنة، ثم سميت الخليل نسبة إلى (خليل الرحمن) إبراهيم، ففي أوائل القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد سكن إبراهيم بعض السنين تحت بلوطات «ممرًا» الواقعة شمال الخليل، وتضم الخليل رفاته ورفاة زوجته سارة، وعائلته من بعده إسحق ويعقوب ويوسف لوط ويونس، ثم صارت الخليل قاعدة لدواوود بن سليمان سبع سنين ونصفا فقط، وكذلك تضم الكثير من رفات الصحابة وفي مقدمتهم شهداء معركة أجنادين. يواصل اليهود إدعائهم فهم يدَعُون أن موسى استخرج تابوته من أعماق النيل وحمله معه وأن «يوشع بن نون» دفنه في مغارة في حبرى (الخليل) وهم بهذا الإدعاء وغيره يريدون عبر الصهيونية إلى استدرار عاطفة الناس دينيًا وخلق تاريخ وهمي من العدم.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي أيام الرومان، أقيمت كنيسة على مقبرة إبراهيم وعائلته، ولما دخل الفرس سنة 614 م هدموها، تُعد الخليل واحدة من آخر المدن في فلسطين التي دخلها الفتح الإسلامي في القرن السابع الميلادي. وقد كانت تُسمى على أيام النبي محمد بـ«حبرا». وقد شاد الأمويون سقف الحرم الحالي والقباب التي فوق مراقد إبراهيم ويعقوب وزوجتيهما. وفي العصر العباسي فتح الخليفة المهدي باب السور الحالي من جهة الشرق وبنوا له المراقي الجميلة من ناحيتي الشمال والجنوب وأمر المقتدر بالله ببناء القبة التي على ضريح يوسف.\n\nوفي العصر الفاطمي لم يكن لمشهد الخليل باب، وكان دخوله مستحيلاً، بل كان الناس يزورونه من الإيوان في الخارج. فلما جلس المهدي على عرش مصر أمر بفتح باب فيه، وزيّنه وفرشه بالسجاجيد، وأدخل على عمارته إصلاحاً كثيراً. وباب المشهد وسط الحائط الشمالي على ارتفاع أربع أذرع فوق الأرض، وعلى جانبه درجات من الحجر، فيصعد إليه من جانب ويكون النزول من الجانب الثاني. ووضع هناك باب صغير من الحديد.\nلقد وصف الاصطخري المدينة بقوله: ««ومن بيت لحم على سمته في الجنوب مدينة صغيرة، شبيهة في القدر بقرية ـ تعرف بمسجد إبراهيم، وفي المسجد الذي يجمّع فيه الجمعة قبر إبراهيم واسحق ويعقوب صفاً، وقبور نسائهم صفاً بحذاء كل قبر من قبورهم قبر امرأة صاحبه، والمدينة في وهدة بين الجبال كثيرة كثيفة الأشجار، وأشجار هذه الجبال وسائر جبال فلسطين وسهلها زيتون وتين وجميز وعنب وسائر الفواكه أقل من ذلك»».\nكما وصفها المقدسي: ««حبرى هي قرية إبراهيم الخليل، فيها حصن منيع، يزعمون أنه من بناء الجن من حجارة عظيمة منقوشة، وسطه قبّة من الحجارة إسلامية، على قبر إبراهيم وقبر اسحق، قُدَّام في المغطى، وقبر يعقوب في المؤخر. حذاء كل نبي امرأته. وقد جُعل الحبر مسجداً وبني حوله دور للزّوار. واختلطت فيه العمارة ولهم قناة ضعيفة. وهذه القرية إلى نحو نصف مرحلة من كل جانب قرى وكروم وأعناب وتفاح، تسمى جبل نصرة لا يُرى مثله، ولا أحسن من فواكهه، عامتها تحمل إلى مصر وتنشر. وفي هذه القرية ضيافة دائمة وطبّأخ وخباز وخدام، مرتبون يقدمون العدس بالزيت لكل من حضر من الفقراء. ويدفع إلى الأغنياء إذا أخذوا. ويظن أكثر الناس أنه من قرى إبراهيم وإنما هو من وقف تميم الداري وغيره. والأفضل عندي التورُّع عنه»».\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nوقد سقطت مدينة «الخليل» في أيدى الفرنجة عام 1099 م إبَّان الحروب الصليبية. وقام الأمير جودفري البويوني ببناء قلعة حصينة لحمايتها والتي سمّاها \"Castellion Saint Abraham\" - أي: «قلعة القديس أبراهام»، ثم منحها وقلعتها إلى جيرارد افسنس \"Gerard of Avesenes\" طبقا للعرف الإقطاعي، الذي صار عليه الفرنجة في توزيع معظم البلاد والأراضي التي تم الاستيلاء عليها لكبار الأمراء والقادة العسكريين. وهكذا تحولت مدينة الخليل وجزء من الزمام الزراعي المحيط بها إلى إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، يسيطر عليها أحد الأمراء بفضل جهود الأمير جودفري، الذي يرجع إليه الفضل بوضع أساس النظام الإقطاعي الفرنجي الصليبي في فلسطين، غير أن السمات البارزة لهذا النظام لم تظهر في عهده؛ بسبب قصر المدة التي حكمها.\nأصبحت الخليل إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، لكن الملك الفرنجي في بيت المقدس لم يقم بمنح جميع أراضي الخليل للسيد الإقطاعي وإنما احتفظ بجزء منها، مما يشير إلى أن المملكة الفرنجية اتبعت نهجا واضحا في سياستها العامة والمتعلقة بمنح الإقطاعات والأملاك المحددة دون اللجوء إلى منح المدن المناطق الريفية المحيطة بها للسادة الإقطاعيين. وربما كان ملوك بيت المقدس يهدفون من وراء هذه السياسة تحقيق عدة أمور منها: الاحتفاظ بمساحات شاسعة من أراضي الخليل من أجل منح جزء منها للكنائس والأديرة وصغار النبلاء والفرسان، أو ربما للحد من سلطة السيد الإقطاعي، أو ربما من أجل الإسهام في تغطية نفقات التاج من عائدات هذه الأراضي.\nلقد استطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد المدينة من أيدى الصليبيين إثر موقعة حطين عام 1187 م. وفي عام (656 هـ - 1258 م) أغار المغول على مدينة الخليل بعدما دمّروا بغداد، غير أن انتصارات «قطز» في عين جالوت عام (658 هـ - 1260 م) وضعت حدًا نهائيً لتلك الغارات.\n\nالعهد المملوكي\nاستعاد القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي مدينة الخليل في 1187. تم ذلك بمساعدة يهودية وفقا لتقليد واحد في وقت متأخر، في مقابل خطاب من الأمن السماح لهم بالعودة إلى المدينة، وبناء كنيس هناك. تم تغيير اسم المدينة مرة أخرى إلى مدينة الخليل. وقد بقي ربع الكردية موجود في البلدة خلال الفترة الأولى من الحكم العثماني. استعاد ريتشارد قلب الأسد المدينة بعد فترة وجيزة. تمكن ريتشارد من كورنوال، وجلبه من إنجلترا لتسوية العداوات الخطيرة بين فرسان المعبد والإسبتارية، التي تنافس للخطر معاهدة ضمان الاستقرار الإقليمي المنصوص عليها مع السلطان المصري والصالح أيوب، لفرض السلام في المنطقة. لكن بعد وقت قصير من مغادرته، ونتيجة للحروب المتناحرة من عام 1241، وفرسان المعبد الذين شنوا غارة مدمرة، في انتهاك للاتفاقيات.\nفي 1260، بعد غارات المغول على فلسطين، لامست واحدة منها الخليل. وقد تم بناء مآذن على هيكل مغارة المكفيلة/المسجد الإبراهيمي في ذلك الوقت. بعد ست سنوات، خلال الحج إلى مدينة الخليل، أصدر بيبرس مرسوما يمنع المسيحيين ويهود\nمن دخول الحرم، وأصبح المناخ أقل تسامحا مع اليهود والمسيحيين مما كانت عليه تحت حكم الدولة الأيوبية قبل. لم يكن مرسوم لإستبعاد المسيحيين واليهود بصرامة حتى منتصف القرن الرابع عشر وبحلول 1490 سمح لمن هم ليسو بمسلمين بالدخول في كهوف تحت الأرض. تم بناء مصنع في أرطاس عام 1307 حيث تم تخصيص الأرباح من دخلها إلى مستشفى في الخليل. ولقد كتب العديد من الزوار حول الخليل على مدى القرنين التاليين (من بينها \"Ishtori HaParchi\" عام 1322 و \"Nachmanides\" عام 1270 والحاخام ميشولام من فولتيرا عام 1481 و \"HaParchi\" عام 1322. ولم يُسجل أي ذكر لليهود في مدينة الخليل في هذه الفترة.\nلقد استمرت الهجرة إلى المدينة من قبل المجموعات العرقية والدينية المختلفة، ومن ضمنها مجموعات يهودية صغيرة وفقيرة اعتاشت على صدقات المحسنين اليهود الذين كانوا يزورون المدينة (خلال الفترة المملوكية)، وسكنت في قلب المدينة في حارة الدارية. هذا بالإضافة إلى نشوء حارة صغيرة للنصارى (استمرت بالوجود حتى مطلع الفترة العثمانية)، لتختفي بعدها. ولكن تعود كل الحارات القديمة، والتي ما زالت قائمة، في شكلها النهائي إلى الفترة المملوكية. وبالتالي من الممكن الاعتقاد بأن شكل الخليل القديمة، كما هي عليه الآن، قد تشكل في هذه الفترة، في حين كان نصيب الفترة العثمانية، مجرد تعبئة الفراغات التي تركتها الفترة المملوكية وتكثيف استعمال المساحات وزيادة طوابق المباني القديمة وتوسع ضئيل في مساحة الحارات.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nفتح العثمانيون الشام ومدينة الخليل بعد معركة مرج دابق عام 1517 م، واستمر حكمهم 4 قرون، حتى جاء الاحتلال البريطانى لفلسطين عام 1917م إلى عام 1948 م.\nلقد كانت الخليل مشهورة بعمل الزجاج. وكانت أبنيتها في هذه الفترة من الحجر الكلسي الذي يستخرج من الجبال المحيطة بها. ولهذه المدينة عدة أبواب تغلق ليلاً منعاً للمواصلة مع بقية المقاطعات ومحافظة على الأمن والسكينة. والمدينة الحاضرة مبنية على منحدرات الهضاب وفي السهل. وموقع الحرم أو الجامع يقع عند نهاية المنحدر البعيد عنها قليلاً. وضمت الخليل 22 ألف نسمة في نهاية الفترة العثمانية. بينهم 2000 يهودي لهم ثلاثة معابد. تقوم على مساحة ضيقة من واد ينحدر من الشمال الغربي. ضواحي البلدة خصبة، تكثر فيها عيون الماء. يصنع اليهود الخمر الجيد من العنب الذي يكثر في الجوار. وفضلاً عن الكرمة فان أشجار اللوز والمشمش في نمو وازدهار. والخليل أيضاً سوق تجاري.\n\nبالنسبة لأحياء المدينة في هذه الفترة، فضلاً عن الأحياء اليهودية الواقعة في شمالها الغربي وجنوبها الغربي كانت تضم سبعة أحياء:\n\nحي الشيخ علي البكا ويعلو هذا الحي على مجرى مياه «عين قشقلة» وترى بقربها مغائر وقبور صخرية. ومن هذه العين ممر يؤدي إلى رأس تلة (حبال الرياح).\nحارة باب الزاوية.\nحارة القزازين ـ نسبة إلى عمّال الزجاج.\nحارة العقّابة حيث يقيم عمّال المعاطف الشتوية المصنوعة من الجلد\nحارة الحرم\nحارة المشارقة\nحارة قيطون ـ حيث كان يقيم عمال القطن\nكانت البلدة القديمة تقوم في القرب من المدينة الحالية، على «تلة الرميدة» المغطاة بأشجار الزيتون وترى على هذه التلة بقايا جدران ضخمة وبناية حديثة تحمل اسم دير الأربعين. وفي الجنوب الغربي من حارة الحرم انشئت بركتان كبيرتان: الأولى تحمل اسم «بركة القزازين» طولها 28 ياردة وعرضها 18 ياردة وعمقها 27 قدماً ونصف القدم. والثانية وتقع في أسفل الوادي وتعرف باسم «بركة السلطان» بنيت بأحجار مصقولة، مربعة الشكل طول كل ضلع من أضلاعها نحو 44 ياردة. وبقربها تقوم «السراي» الجديدة. وكان لا يسمح لغير المسلمين دخول الحرم الشريف. ولم يدخله من غير المسلمين إلاّ أقلية ممتازة من الأوروبيين انما كان يسمح لليهود وغيرهم الصعود إلى الدرجة السابعة فقط من سلّم الحرم. وعند الدرجة الخامسة يوجد ثقب يعتقد اليهود انه يمتد إلى داخل الحرم إلى أن تصل بالقبور. وفي كل جمعة يأتون إلى الدرجة المذكورة يبكون وينوحون شأنهم في شأن نحيبهم عند حائط البراق (المبكى) في بيت المقدس. وفي الجنوب من تلة «قب الجانب» تقع محطة الكرنتينا. وتلاصق الحرم من الجنوب «القلعة» وهي نصف خربة تستعمل ثكنة للجنود.وفي الخليل أيضاً إدارة للبريد والبرق وفرع لبنك انجلو فلسطين ومستشفى للارسالية الاسكوتلندية.\n\nعهد الانتداب البريطاني\nبعد الحرب العالمية الأولى، انتقلت مدينة الخليل لتكون تحت الانتداب البريطاني. خلال سنوات العشرينات، نتيجة لازدياد الصهيونية من جهة، وتنمية الوعي القومي العربي من جهة أخرى، زادت حدة التوتر بين العرب واليهود الذين عاشوا تحت الانتداب. وقد ادعت كلتا الأيديولوجيتين ادعاءات سياسية وإقليمية متضاربة حول نفس المنطقة، مما أسفر عن انفجار في الخليل، في مذبحة عام 1929.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة \"UNSCOP\" المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة \"UNSCOP\" تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصادي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة \"UNSCOP\" الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية وواليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nلقد أفضت أحداث حرب 1948 إلى إعلان الإدارة الأردنية للضفة الغربية، حيث ضم الأردن الضفة الغربية، بما فيها مدينة الخليل، بصفة رسمية يوم 24 نيسان/ أبريل 1950، لكن الجامعة العربية وآخرون أعلنوا بطلان وعدم قانونية الضم ولم يعترف به سوى ثلاث دول هي العراق وباكستان وبريطانيا.\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى حرب 1967، بعد سقوط الضفة الغربية بيد إسرائيل. إلا أن الوضع القانوني للمدينة ومعها الضفة الغربية بأكملها قد ظل بكونها جزءًا من حدود المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى قرار فك الارتباط عام 1988، حيث تم إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطيني. وقد تخلى الأردن بموجبه عن المطالبة بالضفة الغربية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، التي كانت قد عُينت سابقًا من قبل الجامعة العربية ك«ممثل شرعي وحيد للشعب الفلسطيني».\n\nالنكسة\nرزحت الخليل تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة الخليل التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة، حيث احتلت إسرائيل مدينة الخليل في 5 يونيو 1967، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها، ويوجد داخل المدينة حاليا خمسة مواقع استيطانية يهودية وهي مستوطنة تل الرميده، والدبويا، ومدرسة أسامة بن المنقذ وسوق الخضار والاستراحة السياحية قرب المسجد الإبراهيمي الشريف، بالإضافة إلى التجمع الاستيطاني اليهودي على حدود المدينة الشرقية (كريات أربع وخارسينا).\nالخليل هي المدينة الفلسطينية الوحيدة التي اقيمت في قلبها مستوطنة. لأجل حرية حركة للمئات القلائل من المستوطنين اختارت إسرائيل سياسة رسمية مميزة ضد السكان الفلسطينيين في المدينة. مع مرور السنين أصبح مركز المدينة كمدينة اشباح.\n\nعلى مدار سنوات، تم إقامة عدد من نقاط الاستيطان الإسرائيلية في مدينة الخليل القديمة وضواحيها، وهي منطقة كانت بمثابة مركز تجاري لجنوب الضفة الغربية. وتقوم الجهات المسئولة عن القانون في إسرائيل وقوات الأمن الإسرائيلية بتكبيد ثمن حماية هذه النقاط الاستيطانية من جميع السكان الفلسطينيين. ولهذا الغرض، تنتهج إسرائيل نظامًا يستند بصورة صريحة ومكشوفة إلى «مبدأ الفصل»، الذي على ضوئه أوجدت إسرائيل عزلا (SEGREGATION) على الأرض وعزلاً قانونيًا ما بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية.\nوقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى انهيار الاقتصاد وسط مدينة الخليل ونزوح واسع للسكان الفلسطينيين. وتُظهر نتائج المسح الذي أُجري من أجل إعداد هذا التقرير، أن الفلسطينيين نزحوا عن ما لا يقل عن 1014 شقة سكنية في وسط مدينة الخليل، علمًا أن هذه الشقق تُشكل 41.9% من مجموع الشقق السكنية في هذه المنطقة. كما أن 65% من الشقق التي تم إخلاؤها، وعددها 659، نزح عنها سكانها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية. كما يتضح من نتائج المسح أن 1829 محلاً تجاريًا فلسطينيًا في المنطقة التي جرى مسحها أصبحت مهجورة اليوم، علما أن هذه المحلات التجارية المغلقة تشكل 76.6% من مجموع المحال التجارية في هذه المنطقة. 62.4% من المحال التجارية المغلقة، وعددها 1141 محلا، تم إغلاقها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية، وأن 440 محلًا منها جرى إغلاقها بأوامر عسكرية.\nإن المكونات الأساسية لـ«سياسة الفصل» الإسرائيلية تقوم على الحظر الشديد والواسع لحركة الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن فرض القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. كل هذا إلى جانب ما يلحق سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين من أذى مباشر من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة الخليل، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو. في عام 1994، عندما كان سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو في أوجه، قام المستوطن اليهودي باروخ غولدشتاين بإطلاق النار على المسلمين الذين كانوا يصلون في الحرم الإبراهيمي وقتل 29 منهم وأصاب عددًا أكبر بكثير.\nاستمر سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو وفي شباط/فبراير 1997، تم توقيع اتفاق حول الانتشار الجزئي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الخليل، وتم تقسيم المدينة إلى قسمين: منطقة H1، والتي تم تسليم السيطرة عليها للسلطة الفلسطينية، ومنطقة H2 - التي بقيت تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. وفي أبريل/ نيسان 2002، سيطر جيش الإحتلال الإسرائيلي على المدينة بأكملها، ووضعت أبراج مراقبة ثابتة في منطقة H1 في المدينة في عام 2003.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع المدينة على هضبة ترتفع 940 م عن سطح البحر. يربطها طريق رئيسي بمدينتي بيت لحم والقدس، وتقع على الطريق الذي يمر بأواسط فلسطين رابطة الشام بمصر مروراً بسيناء.\nوقد بنيت الخليل على سفحي جبلي جبل الرميدة وجبل الرأس على ارتفاع 927 م، وفي الوادي بين الجبلين الذي يختلف اسمه على طول مجراه، حيث يعرف بوادي التفاح، وهو يخترق وسط الخليل.\nوتقع الخليل على بُعد 35 كم للجنوب من مدينة القدس، و46 كم غرب نهر الأردن، و152 كم جنوب مدينة جنين، و229 كم غرب مدينة الكرك الأردنية.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى البلدة القديمة والجديدة، من أهم الأحياء الجديدة في المدينة:\n\nأما البلدة القديمة فتتميز بعراقتها وأصالتها، ويعود تاريخ مبانيها إلى العهد الأيوبي والمملوكي والعثماني، وتمتاز البلدة القديمة بنظامها المعماري الرائع وفيها العديد من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية والقناطر والأزقة والأسواق القديمة. ومن أهم الأحياء القديمة في المدينة: حي الشيخ علي البكاء، حي القزازين، حي السواكنة، حي القلعة، حي بني دار، حارة العقابة، حي المحتسبيين، حي المدرسة، حي قيطون، حي المشارقة حي الأكراد، حي المشارقة الفوقا، وحي الحوشية.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في الخليل مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتراً.\n\nالسكان\nالخليل أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية، حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها اليوم 200,000 نسمة (بحسب بلدية الخليل). ويذكر بأن عدد سكان الخليل مع مطلع القرن العشرين كان قد قدر بحوالي 8000 – 10000 نسمة فقط.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكانها عام 1922 م حوالي 16,577 نسمة منهم 430 يهودياً وعام 1945 م حوالي 24,560 نسمة وبلغ عدد سكانها عام 1967 م بعد الاحتلال حوالي 38,300 نسمة ارتفع إلى 79,100 نسمة عام 1987 م.\nأقامت سلطات الاحتلال أحزمة استيطانية حول المدينة وأنشأت أول مستوطنة هي (كريات أربع) تمهيداً لتطويق المدينة ومحاصرتها جغرافياً وسكانياً ومن أجل هذا الهدف صادرت مساحات واسعة من أراضيها وأقامت مستوطنتين عام 1981م هما مستوطنة (كرمل) وهي من نوع موشاف مساحتها 4 آلاف دونم ومستوطنة (ماعون) وأقامت سلطات الاحتلال حيا يهوديا في قلب المدينة، وبلغت مساحة الأراضي المصادرة من المدينة وما حولها حوالي 72700 دونم حتى عام 1981م وتبلغ عدد المستوطنات المقامة في المحافظة 34 مستوطنة حتى نهاية 1987م ومنها 26 مستوطنة تزيد مساحة الواحدة منها عن 25 دونم.\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان منطقة الخليل في فترات مختلفة:\n\nوأما الأصول العرقية لسكان المدينة، فبالرغم من وقوع الكثير من القصص العائلية تحت الأساطير التاريخية، إلا أن هناك جزء ليس بقليل من السكان، الذين نعرف أصولهم على وجه اليقين، منها الأصول العربية قبل الإسلامية (قبيلة لخم أجداد التميمية)، وأصول كردية (الأكراد)، وأصول عربية سورية (الجعابرة من قلعة جعبر على الضفاف السورية من نهر الفرات على بعد 35 من مدينة الرقة)، وأصول مغربية، وتركية، كما هاجر إلى الخليل عائلات من مدن فلسطينية مختلفة (القدس وعسقلان، أو من جبل الخليل مثل دورا ويطا على سبيل المثال). وانضم إلى السكان بعد النكبة عام 1948 عددا غير معروف من اللاجئين، الذين سكنوا داخل المدينة واختلطوا بأهلها.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالزراعة\nعلى الصعيد الزراعي عرفت الخليل منذ القدم بأنها مدينة تحيط بها الأراضي الزراعية من كل جانب واشتهرت في زراعة العنب والتين واللوز والمشمش والزيتون وتزرع الحبوب، والزراعة هي من أهم الحرف التي يمارسها السكان في محافظة الخليل، وهي تمثل موردًا اقتصاديًا هامًا، وقد بلغت المساحة المزروعة 338,400 دونم عام 2006-2007 ومن أهم المحاصيل الزراعية في الخليل الحبوب والخضار، والأشجار المثمرة مثل الزيتون واللوز والعنب والفواكة الأخرى، وتضم الخليل عددًا كبيرًا من الثروة الحيوانية، إذ تشكل 30.2% من جملة هذه الثروة في الضفة الغربية، ومن أهم أنواع الحيوانات الماعز والضأن.\n\nالصناعة\nمارس سكان الخليل الصناعة منذ القدم، حيث انتشرت الصناعة اليدوية، بل إن بعض حارات الخليل سميت بأسماء هذه الحرف، مثل سوق الحصرية وسوق الغزل وحارة الزجاجيين، ولمحافظة الخليل شهرة في صناعة الصابون ودباغة الجلود وصناعة الأكياس الكبيرة من شعر الحيوان ومعاطف الفرو والفخار والأحذية والنسيج والصناعات الخشبية والخزف والنسيج والهدايا، وحتى عام 1978 ضمت محافظة الخليل أكثر من ثلث الوحدات الصناعية في الضفة الغربية وهي: الصناعات الغذائية، النسيج والملابس، الجلود ومنتجاتها ماعدا الأحذية، الأحذية ما عدا المطاطية الأخشاب ما عدا الأثاث، الورق ومنتجاته، النشر والطباعة، الزجاج، صناعات غير معدنية، صناعات غير حديدية، تصنيع المواد المعدنية ومشتقاتها، صناعة الأدوات الكهربائية.\nوتشتهر المدينة أيضًا بكثير من الصناعات المحلية التي تصدر أيضا إلى الخارح بكميات كبيرة وخصوصا إلى الأسواق الأوروبية، ومن أهم الصناعات في الخليل:\n\nصناعة الزجاج - وتعود إلى تاريخ المدينة القديم وقد تم نطويرها لتواكب التطور الحاضر.\nصناعة الخزف والفخار - وهي أيضا من تاريخ المدينة القديم.\nصناعة الجلود - تستخدم في صناعة الأحذية بشكل كبير حيث يتم تصدير الأحذية إلى عدة دول أهمها: إيطاليا وإسبانيا والأردن ودول الخليج. حيث تعتبر هذه الصناعة من أهم مصادر دخل المدينة.\nصناعة الملابس بكل أنواعها - تجدر الإشارة إلى أن أكبر ثوب في العالم حيك يدويا موجود في مدينة الخليل (وسجل في موسوعة غينيس).\nصناعة الباطون.\nمناشير الحجر والرخام والبلاط - وهي أيضا من أهم مصادر الدخل الاقتصادي للمدينة، حيث تصدر إلى معظم الدول الاوربية والعربية.\nصناعنة الحديد والألمنيوم.\nصناعة الدراجات الهوائية.\nصناعة النايلون\nصناعة الموازين والقبانات القديمة والحديثة.\nصناعة الألبان والمنتجات الغذائية\nصناعة الأثاث المنزلي والسجاد والعطور.\n\nالتجارة\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بالتجارة حيث يعتبر أهلها من أمهر التجار في فلسطين، وتنتشر الأسواق في الخليل بكثرة، حتى أنها تعتبر كل المدينة سوق. ولقد حظيت محافظة الخليل بمركز تجاري، إذ يأتي إليها الفلاحون والبدو من المناطق المحيطة بها على الرغم من أنها فقدت نصف قضائها عام 1948، وزادت قوة هذا المركز بعد ارتفاع مستوى المعيشة وتطور وسائل النقل فاتسعت الأسواق المركزية وشملت معظم مساحة المدينة القديمة وبنيت أسواق متخصصة جديدة.\nولقد أغلق جنود الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مؤخرا عدد كبير من المحلات التجارية في الخليل. وتأتي عملية الإغلاق في اطار السياسة التي تتبعها السلطات الإسرائيلية بكل ما يتعلق بوسط الخليل، والقائمة على نظام فصل يهدف إلى حماية البؤر الاستيطانية المتعددة التي أقيمت في هذه المنطقة. هذا النظام يتجسد من خلال الفصل الميداني والقانوني بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية، المنع الواسع والقيود المفروضة على حركة وتنقل الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن تطبيق القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. وينضاف إلى هذا كله استهداف سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين بأيدي عناصر قوات الأمن. وقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى حدوث انهيار اقتصادي وسط الخليل ورحيل السكان الفلسطينيين بصورة واسعة.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط\nما كان شارع رئيسي في المركز التجاري لمدينة الخليل، مغلق للفلسطينيين منذ عام 2000. أغلق الجيش الإسرائيلي جميع الدكاكين وأبواب المنازل. يستعمل الشارع فقط لعبور المستوطنين. في تاريخ 25.12.06 أصدر المستشار القضائي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الضفة الغربية قرار انه: تم إغلاق الشارع بالخطأ وانه لا يوجد لذلك مبرر قانوني ويجب عدم منع حركة الفلسطينيين في الشارع. رغم قرار المستشار القضائي بأن إغلاق الشارع غير قانوني إلا أن الجيش الإسرائيلي ما زال يمنع الفلسطينيين من العبور في شارع الشهداء.\nومن الشوارع المهمة شـارع عين ساره حيث يقع فيه مبنى البلدية؛ وأهم ملعب كرة قدم في المدينة ملعب الحسين والعديد من المدارس والمباني الحكومية. كما تقع فيه أيضًا مغارة عيـن سارة وهي مغارة صغيرة وفيها نبع ماء، حيث يعتقد بان سكان المدينة كانوا يستعملوها للإستحمام فيها، بمن فيهم سارة زوجة إبراهيم، لهذا نسب الاسم لها.\nومن أهم الشوارع الأخرى: باب الزاوية (مركز المدينة)، رأس الجورة (مدخل المدينة)، عين خير الدين، الجوزات، حارة

وموقعها الإستراتيجي بالإشارة إلى منطقة تل الرميدة ونمرة والبلدة القديمة. للمباني العامة كالمدرسة القيمرية والفخرية والسلطان حسن والحمامات كحمام إبراهيم الخليل وحمام داري وحمام البركة وحمام كاتبة بدر وحمام الشيخ بدير وقنوات المياه والبرك والأسبلة كسبيل الطواشي وصحن الحرم وسيف الدين سلار وسبيل وقناة العين الحمراء والرباطات والتكية والزوايا ومسجد ابن عثمان ومسجد القزازين.\nتشكيل المباني السكنية للأحواش الصغيرة والكبيرة واتصالها معا والمباني السكنية كمسكن آل سلهب ومجمع الحرباوي ومسكن آل شاهين ومسكن قصر الدويك ومسكن آل الإمام ومواد البناء من حجارة وفخار وجير ورماد ومخلوط الرماد والشيد -القصرمل- والأخشاب وبقايا الزيوت -الزيبار- وطرق إنشاء المباني من أساسات وجدران وأسقف، والحرف التقليدية في مدينة الخليل من صناعة الزجاج والفخار والخزف ودباغة الجلود وتبييض النحاس وحرفة النجارة والحدادة والغزل والنسيج ومعاصر زيت الزيتون والسمسم والحفظ بالتجفيف والتمليح والسكر وصناعة طحن الحبوب.\nلقد جاءت فكرة تأسيس لجنة إعمار الخليل القديمة عام 1996 لمعالجة مشاكل الإسكان والمساكن والمشاكل الاجتماعية وبناء علاقات محلية ودولية وتوثيق الموروث الثقافي والإشراف والترميم وعمل مخططات الحفاظ على البلدة القديمة وإشغال المباني والخدمات الاجتماعية والمتابعات القانونية والصدامات المتكررة مع الجيش والمستوطنين والأوامر العسكرية التي تمنع الترميم.\n\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن هناك مذكرة أعدتها بلدية الخليل من أجل ترشيح البلدة القديمة على لائحة التراث العالمي لليونسكو، حمايةً للمعالم الأثرية التي قامت إسرائيل بتغيير بعضها، أو بضم البعض الآخر إلى قائمة التراث اليهودي الخاص بها.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتضم الخليل مجموعة من المعالم الدينية والتاريخية والسياحية التي تشجع السياح على زيارة المدينة، وخاصة البلدة القديمة، حيث توجد بها مجموعة من المعالم السياحية والأبنية التاريخية المهمة مثل المسجد الإبراهيمي، إلى جانب وجود مجموعة من المتاحف أهمها: متحف الخليل، وتوجد فيها مجموعة من المنتزهات والحدائق العامة أهمها: منتزه الكرمل.\nومن خلال دراسة الاكتشافات الأثرية في منطقة الخليل وقضائها، من حيث خصائصها ومميزاتها ومواصفاتها والمادة الخام المستخدمة وطبيعة الرسومات، تبين أن الكنعانيين هم أول من استوطن المنطقة أقاموا فيها الكثير من مدنهم وقراهم، وبنوا الخليل القديمة، وقد بقى من هذه المدينة القديمة بعض الآثار التي تدل على مكانها. كما تحوي اثارا رومانية وبيزنطية وأموية وصليبية ومملوكية وعثمانية.\nومن خلال البحث بمورفولوجيا البلدة القديمة بالخليل من حيث هيئة العمران وتخطيط المدينة وحاراتها، يمكن تقسيمها إلى الحارات التالية: حارة القزازين وحارة السواكنة وحارة بني دار وحارة العقابة وحارة القلعة وحارة الحوشية وحارة المحتسبية وحارة مدرسة المعارف وحارة الأكراد وحارة اليهود وحارة المشارقة بالإضافة إلى الحارات المنفصلة عن البلدة القديمة كحارة قيطون وحارة الشيخ علي بكا. أما الأسواق، فهناك: سوق البازار وسوق الخواجات وسوق الخضار وسوق السكافية وسوق اللبن وسوق المغاربة وسوق القزازين.\nبعد احتلال المدينة من قبل إسرائيل في عام 1967 م شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها حيث يوجد حاليِا خمس مواقع استيطانية يهودية، مما أثر على وضع المدينة السياحي بشكل سلبي إلى حد كبير.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة الخليل مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، حيث أن المعدل العام للأمية في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nويواجه التعليم في الخليل مجموعة من التحديات، إضافة إلى أن مؤسساتها التربوية تتميز بخاصية أيضا تختلف عن باقي المؤسسات التربوية في المناطق المجاورة.\nوقد تم مؤخرًا افتتاح مشروع تحسين جودة برامج التعليم في العلوم الاجتماعية للمرحلة الأساسية العليا للصفوف الخامس - العاشر.\n\nالتعليم المدرسي\nويوجد في المدينة العديد من المدارس لمختلف المراحل الدراسية؛ حكومية، أهلية، ووكالة. وفيها عدد من المعاهد وكليات المجتمع وفيها جامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين ومعهد العروب وفيها جامعة الخليل تأسست عام 1971. وقد بلغ عدد الأبنية المدرسية في مديرية التربية والتعليم في الخليل في عام 2011 ما يزيد عن 132 مدرسة ينتظم فيها 66 ألف طالبًا وطالبة موزعين في مدارس وسط المدينة وفي المنطقة الجنوبية، وكذلك في قرى تفوح وبيت كاحل وترقوميا، كما أن هنالك 36 مدرسة تقع في منطقة H2 والتي تخضع للسيطرة الإسرائيلية الكاملة وهي الأكثر تضرراً فيما يخص الأبنية المدرسية بسبب منع الاحتلال مديرية تربية الخليل بناء الطوابق والمدارس في تلك المنطقة، وتواجه مديرية تربية الخليل ازدياد سنوي كبير في أعداد الطلبة الملتحقين بنظام التعليم الحكومي، مما يؤدي إلى اكتظاظ في الصفوف الدراسية.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nجامعة الخليل.\nجامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين.\nكلية العروب التقنية (العروب).\nجامعة القدس المفتوحة.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءًا من هوية سكان منطقة الخليل منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني، ويظهر الاختلاف بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو للهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كما تمتاز اللهجة الخليلية بطول النغمة الموسيقية والكلمات بها. أما بالنسبة للزي التقليدي، فيتميز في منطقة الخليل وجنوب الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأحمر والأبيض المقلم. كما توجد في الخليل مجموعات شبابية متعددة تهتم بالأدب والثقافة الفلسطينية والعربية، ومن أهمها الندوة الثقافية في الخليل.\n\nالأكلات الشعبية\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بكروم العنب، والتي بدورها دخلت في كثير من طعامهم، فيصنعون منه الدبس والعنطبيخ (مربى العنب) (عنب طبيخ، ويسمونه في القضاء عنبية) والخبيصة والملبن المشهور والراووق (الراووء) والبوء سما والزبيب ومخلل الحصرم.\nكما تشتهر بمنتجات الألبان وخاصة اللبن المخيض واللبن الجميد ذائع الصيت من قرى الخليل والذي يعتبر بحق من أفضل أنواع الجميد ولذلك اشتهرت الخليل بأكلة اللبن المعقود والمنسف الفلسطيني الأصل، وكذلك الجبنة البيضاء المغلية التي تؤكل مع العنب أو البطيخ أو الخيار أو مقلية محمرة أو تنقع في الماء لإزالة ملوحتها واستعمالها في الحلويات كالكنافة والقطايف.\nومن أهم الأكلات التي تشتهر بها مدينة الخليل (القدرة الخليلية)، وهي عبارة عن الأرز مع قطع لحم الخروف البلدي أو الدجاج والسمنة البلدية تطبخ في قدر نحاسي مع بعضها البعض في الفرن الشعبي، بالإضافة إلى المنسف والمقلوبة والمجدرة.\n\nالرياضة\nيلعب في الخليل عدة أندية رياضية سواء في كرة القدم أو كرة السلة أو رياضات أخرى كالفروسية، منها: الخليل الرياضي، أهلي الخليل، خليل الرحمن، وشباب الخليل - الذي يُعد أقدمها وأقدم الأندية الفلسطينية على الإطلاق (تأسس عام 1943م). شارك بعض هذه الأندية في بطولات كرة القدم في الضفة الغربية (الدوري الأردني) قبل عام 1967، وتشارك اليوم في بطولة كأس فلسطين.\nوتحوي الخليل ملعبًا يتسع لحوالي 15 ألف متفرج، وهو ملعب الحسين بن علي، تم إعادة تدشينه في عام 2009م بعد افتتاحه لأول مرة في أربعينيات القرن الفائت. كما تحوي فيها أكبر صالة رياضيه في فلسطين، تم افتتاحها سنة 2011م من خلال مباراة بكرة السلة جمعت بين فريق فلسطيني وفريق إسباني.\n\nالصحة\nعلى الصعيد الصحي في المدينة 3 مستشفيات وهي مستشفى الأميرة عالية ويحتوي على 100 سرير، ومستشفى خليل الرحمن والمستشفى الأهلي التابع لجمعية أصدقاء المريض، بالإضافة إلى العديد من العيادات الصحية وعددها في المحافظة 37 عيادة.\n\nمستشفى الأميرة عالية الحكومي.\nمستشفى محمد علي المحتسب الحكومي.\nالمستشفى الأهلي، التابع لجمعية أصدقاء

          "content": "## Overview\nHebron (Arabic: الخليل al-Ḫalīl; Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Ḥevron, Ḥeḇrôn, or Ḥebron) is an ancient city in the southern West Bank. It is the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. This makes it a significant religious site for the Abrahamic religions. In 2017, the old town was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n## Understand\nHebron is mentioned in the Bible as the home of Abraham, and the burial place of him and several generations of his family. In King David's time, Hebron was briefly the capital of the Israelite state, before the capital moved to Jerusalem. Today, Hebron is holy to both Muslims and Jews due to its association with Abraham. (Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, but Christians haven't paid as much attention to Hebron.)\nThe Jewish population of Hebron was evacuated after Arabs killed nearly 70 of them in 1929. After the 1967 war, a few Jews resettled the Jewish quarter. Today, about 500 Jews live in part of the old city of Hebron under continual Israel Defense Force protection, and with a ratio of four Israeli soldiers for each Israeli settler.\nToday, the city of Hebron is home to about 500 Jews and 200,000 Palestinians. The Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba (population 8,000) is a separate city immediately adjacent to Hebron. Hebron is divided into two sectors: H1 is entirely Palestinian and includes about 80% of the city's residents, while H2 contains all the Jews and the remainder of the Arabs. H1 is under full Palestinian control (i.e. Area A), while H2 is under full Israel control. The Cave of the Patriarchs, the main holy site in the city, is on the border between H1 and H2.\nThis has been one of the tensest places between Jews and Palestinians, as in Hebron both sides here tend to be more extreme and violent than the average for their ethnic groups. Jews here have the 1929 massacre on their minds, while Palestinians have Baruch Goldstein's 1994 massacre of praying Muslims on theirs. This is not a good place to express your opinion on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Even Jewish residents here have an often-hostile relationship with the Israel army, because they see it as being too accommodating to Palestinians. Unfortunately, the 2017 declaration of the Old Town as a UNESCO world heritage site has done little to ease the tensions, as the Israeli government protested its classification as an \"endangered\" \"Palestinian\" site, despite its Jewish heritage.\n\n## Get in\nIf you are visibly Jewish, it is probably not safe to travel unaccompanied to the \"other\" side of Hebron. However, if you look and sound like an international tourist, you should be fine on both sides.\n\n## To the Jewish side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 381 or 383 from the CBS (₪8.10) to the Jewish side of Hebron. The third from the last stop (Me'arat Hamahpela) is in front of the Cave of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side. The final stop (Beit Romano) is a five minute walk from an H1/H2 checkpoint.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Take bus 254 (₪13.50), which terminates at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, from where you can take 381 or 383 over to the Jewish side of Hebron. This transfer might be free if you show them the bus 254 ticket.\n\n## To the Palestinian side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 21 from the Sultan Suleiman bus station just out and to the right from Damascus gate. Tell them Hebron or Al-Khalil (Arabic). They will take you to a mid way drop off point at the Bethlehem bus station. From there, go to the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station where a servees (the Palestinian version of a sherut, called a serv-eese in Arabic) will deliver you to Hebron for less than ₪10.\nAlternatively, take the bus to Abu Dis and tell the bus driver you are going to Khalil.\nFrom Bethlehem – As mentioned before, from the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station (at Manger Street) a servees will deliver you to Hebron for ₪9.\nFrom Ramallah – Direct servees to Hebron depart from one of the many bus stations in Ramallah, just ask around. It might be faster to go to Bethlehem first, though.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Make your way to the last stop in front of the Church of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side, as explained before. From there just walk further passing by at least three Israeli checkpoints, with the 31.52653135.1022061 last checkpoint being a gate which \"delivers\" you to the Palestinian side. Alternatively, you can directly enter the Palestinian side via a 31.5245335.1099742 gate to the left of the Muslim entrance of the Church of the Patriarchs, after which however you will need to go through a lengthy and little depressing souq alley.\n\n## Crossing between the sides\nThere are at least two gates that allow pedestrian traffic between the Palestinian and Jewish sides. The most convenient gate for travelers is the Bab El-Zawiya crossing, a five minute walk from the Beit Romano bus stop on David Hamelech Street. Parking for Israeli registered vehicles is possible just before the crossing.\nThere is a myth that it is impossible to access the Jewish side of Hebron on foot coming from the highway/main road. However, this was likely only true in tense times, because there were no gates and metal detectors you could be checked with, although this has since changed. Generally, Palestinian taxi drivers are not allowed to drive to the Jewish side. In that case, you will need to go by taxi or bus from an Israeli town or a Jewish settlement (like Kiryat Arba). Either way, internationals can drive into the Jewish side, if your driver is not Palestinian.\nIt is now possible to make a long (25 min) walk from Kiryat Arba to the Cave of the Patriarchs directly via a stubby sidewalk. If that is not possible directly for some reason, walk via the Palestinian side and then through one of the gates coming from Be'er Sheva.\n\n## In general\nThe 31.52723935.098661 Hebron Bus Station for servees to and from the surrounding areas, and even Bethlehem and Ramallah is on the upper floors of the Jeel-Saed shopping centre along Adel Street.\nOn the Palestinian side of Hebron, taxi rides within the city shouldn't cost more than ₪10-15. For seeing sights out-of-town, it's best to take a servees taxi at the service-taxi/bus station or negotiate a fair price with a taxi driver. Make sure to agree on a price for a taxi before getting in.\nOn the Jewish side of Hebron, a 10-minute walk will take you from one end to the other.\n\n## See\n31.5248735.110711 Cave of the Patriarchs (al Haram al Ibrahimi/Ibrahimi Mosque, Ma'arat HaMachpelah/Machpelah Cave). The main religious site in the city. The cave, where the Patriarchs and their wives are buried, is deep underground. Now, people pray in a building on top of the cave, built by King Herod about 2000 years ago. The building is divided into Muslim and Jewish sections. Visitors are welcome to visit both sides when they are not being used for scheduled prayer. The Muslim side provides cloaks for women to cover up when visiting. The Muslim side contains the only known entrance to the Cave below (it is locked by a marble door), as well as the tomb-markers of Isaac and Rebecca. The tomb-markers of Abraham and Sarah lie on the border of both the Muslim and Jewish sections, while the Jewish section contains the tomb-markers of Jacob and Leah. Most of the time, half of the building is used for Muslim and half for Jewish prayer. On a few predetermined days each year, each religion gets to use the entire building. For the Jews, in addition to the normal holidays, one of these days is \"Shabbat Chayei Sarah\" each fall, on which thousands of people from all of Israel visit Hebron to commemorate Abraham's purchase of the Cave from its previous Hittite owners. For the Muslims, it is on Fridays during Ramadan, and during the Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha holiday, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son. The Cave of the Patriarchs is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the contested recognition of it led the US's and Israel's 2017 decision to leave the UNESCO on 31 Dec 2018.\n31.52514835.1056822 Beit Romano. The building of the Yeshiva built in 1901. Since 1980, it has been used by Jews as a yeshiva once again.\n31.52508735.102223 Tel Rumeida (Tel Hebron) (next to the Jewish cemetery). In this place archaeological digging revealed the ruins of a 4,500 years old city wall and staircase. On top of which a building with apartments was erected standing on pillars. In this building, also the Hebron Observatory can be found – just walk up the stairs inside of the building and hope the upper door is not locked. According to the nearby stationed Israeli Army, this is one of the most tense places in Hebron, because Palestinian and Jewish houses are built right next to each other with no fences or walls – you will notice by the different large flags posted in front of two houses.\n31.52446335.1018154 Tomb of Yishai (Jesse) and Ruth (close to Tel Hebron, follow the signs). These biblical figures are associated with King David.

They even suggest you're Jewish if you don't tell them your nationality, and might become pushy asking for money.\nThis tout-like behavior leaves some doubts whether they really stand for what they are claiming. If you just don't want to be bothered, tell them you have been here before and not interested this time. Be firm, you have nothing to fear from these guys. Hebron definitely is a very political place, but you should decide for yourself whether to take action.\nIn general, be wary of unofficial guides, which mostly will try to take you from one place to the other where you will likely buy something, so they can make their share from the shop owner. They will even ruthlessly tell you that something is closed or might take too long (like the Church of the Patriarchs), which is not true, just to make sure you spend more time potentially spending money. Better to use a regular guide with an agreed and claimable schedule.\n\n## Security\nMany people are hesitant to come to Hebron, because they get told by hostel owners (e.g. in Bethlehem, for apparent reasons) that Hebron is unsafe. However, Hebron is no less safe than any other city in the West Bank during \"peace times\". Also, if you are non-Jewish you are not a threat or target, for that matter, to/for any Palestinian, and you are likely to be greeted with the characteristic \"welcome!\" in the city center. However, in some of the Palestinian suburbs around the Kiryat Arba settlement, tourists are not a regular occurrence and a small minority of locals may be less friendly, especially if they believe you to be associated with the settlement.\nIn addition, the special situation makes it a must if you want to understand more about the conflict.\n\n## Go next\nNearby popular sights in the West Bank, that allow for a day trip from Hebron, include Tor-Safa Cave, Taffuh Underground Church, Tomb of Prophet Lot and Birkat al-Karmil (Holy Pool).\nBethlehem – The biblical birthplace of Jesus and hometown of David.\nJerusalem – Besides the Dead Sea, a central focus for most people coming to Israel.\nJericho – One of the oldest settlements in the world and the Middle East.\nNegev & Judaean – Deserts close to the Dead Sea, featuring amazing sites and desert landscapes, including the Ramon Crater and two other craters.\nHiking in the Judaean Desert – Go out to other nearby hiking trails; particularly the Mishmar and Ze'elim streams are very close by.\nDead Sea – One of the most famous things to see or do in Israel and Jordan.\nFor bus travel to destinations in Israel, Egged runs various routes from/via inside Kiryat Alba.

          "content": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name for Bethlehem in local languages is  /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning \"house of meat\", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally \"house of bread\" or \"house of food.\" The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem. In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.\n\n\"House of the god Lahmu\"\nCanaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean \"house of\", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, lahmo being the Chaldean word for \"fertility\". Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder, was \"certainly accurate\". Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: \"'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic.\" While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.\n\n\"House of war\"\nAnother suggestion is an association with the root l-h-m \"to fight\", leading to the meaning of \"house of war\" or \"house of fighting\", but this is thought unlikely.\n\nHistory\nCanaanite period\nThe earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking Bit-Laḫmi in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: \"Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!\"\nIt is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. Laḫmu was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as Leḥem. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as Beit Lahama, \"House (Temple) of Lahmu\". By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as \"Philistia\", later corrupted to \"Palestine\".\nA burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.\n\nIsraelite and Judean period\nArchaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads \"From the town of Bethlehem to the King\". According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nBiblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the \"hill country\" of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means \"fertile\", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the \"City of David\". It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried \"by the wayside\" (Genesis 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.\nWriting in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.\n\nClassical period\nThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name בית לחם (Beit Lekhem). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.\nNonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.\nAround 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.\nIn 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the \"Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.\" In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.\nIn 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.\nIn 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.\nBethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.\n\nOttoman era\nFrom 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.\nBethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).\n\nFrom 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town's growth.\nSocin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 \"Latins\" in 256 houses, 824 \"Greeks\" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.\n\nModern era\nBethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.\nJordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy's death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.\nOn December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.\n\nToday, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.\n\nGeography\nBethlehem is located at an elevation of about 775 meters (2,543 ft) above sea level, 30 meters (98 ft) higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.\nThe city is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, 75 kilometers (47 mi) west of Amman, Jordan, 59 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and 10 kilometers (6 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.\nIn the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.\n\nClimate\nBethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of 700 millimeters (28 in) of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.\nBethlehem's average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and \"the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.\" Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of \"principally Christians, Latins and Greeks\" with no Jewish inhabitants.\nThe census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).\nThe 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem's population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 \"other\").\nIn 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.\nIn the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.\n\nChristian population\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.\nThe percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that \"due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.\" The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.\nIn 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population's proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.\nA study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.\n\nEconomy\nShopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.\nCremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.\nIn 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.\nThe Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.\n\nReligious significance and commemoration\nBirthplace of Jesus\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus' parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod's impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.\nEarly Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.\n\nChristmas celebrations\nChristmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine's Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.\n\nOther religious festivals\nBethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.\n\nCulture\nEmbroidery\nThe women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its \"strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.\" Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.\n\nBethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for \"royal\" wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.\n\nMother-of-pearl carving\nThe art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.\n\nCultural centers and museums\nBethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.\n\nThe Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.\nBethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit \"high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere\". The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.\n\nLocal government\nBethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.\nBethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars (\"heads\") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.\n\nThroughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.\nThere are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.\n\nMayors\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.\n\nBethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.\n\nTransportation\nBethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.\nThe Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBethlehem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nBethlehem of Galilee\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania\nBethlehem, Wales\nStar of Bethlehem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBethlehem Municipality\nWelcome To The City of Bethlehem\nOpen Bethlehem civil society project Archived April 19, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\nPhoto: Christmas in Bethlehem, 2008 Archived November 23, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\nBethlehem Fair Trade Artisans\nBethlehem University\nBethlehem aerial photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem",
          "summary": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.",

          "content": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانية: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانية: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينية: Bethleem) هي مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة بيت لحم. تقع في الضفة الغربية التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية على بعد 10 كم إلى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمة بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافة والسياحة في فلسطين.\nللمدينة أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسة فوق كهف أو مغارة يعتقد أنها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداباً آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينة وفقًا لعلماء الآثار على يد الكنعانيين في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والآراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينة عدد من الغزاة عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقية فلسطين للفتح الأشوري والبابلي والفارسي والإغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. وأُعيد بناؤها من قبل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الأرثوذكسية اليونانية برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد أن فتح المدينة صلاح الدين الأيوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينة وأعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطرة على المدينة من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وكان من المفترض أن تُضمّن في المنطقة الدولية في إطار خطة الأمم المتحدة لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. وأُلحقت المدينة بالأردن بعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها إسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الأيام الستة. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقية أوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنية والأمنية في المدينة إلى يد السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخياً منطقة مسيحية السكان، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من أكبر المجتمعات المسيحية الفلسطينية.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحة التي تزداد أثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون إلى كنيسة المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم أكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشة عمل للحرف اليدوية. ويسكن هذه المدينة أحد أقدم المجتمعات المسيحية في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجرة. اختيرت المدينة عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينة بيت لحم أول إصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح أول مدينة تغلق في فلسطين لمدة زادت عن 70 يوماً.\n\nالتسمية\nكان يقع ضمن موقعها مکان عبادة كنعاني يدعى بیراث أربع أو برج أربع، باسم جد الكنعانيين، فتوارث الإسرائيليون المكان والتقاليد فقدموا الذبائح لإلههم يهوه في برج أربع، ويعزو البعض تسمية المدينة بيت لحم بسبب وجود مائدة التقدمة في هذا المكان (صموئيل الأول 9 : 12، 20 : 6، 6 : 29) - ویسمی تلمود أورشلیم المغارة الكبيرة في أفراتا باسم جد الأدوميين والعرب الذين ينتمي لهم الكميتيون والكنسينيون وينتسب لهم كالب، فيُقرأ في \"مدراش أیکا رباني\" (68 : 3) \"في ببرات أربع في اليهودية يأتي المسيا للعالم\". وتشير الملاحظة التابعة أن پيرات أربع هي مكان في بيت لحم وتدعي كذلك \"بيرات ملكا\" نسبة إلى برج الملك. وتذكر \"أخبار الأيام الأولى في التوراة (11 : 16) \"وكان داود حينئذ، في الحصن بينما جنود الفلسطينيين يحاصرون بيت لحم\".\nوذكر نومكينز في مجلة مؤسسة الآثار الفلسطينية الربع سنوية  أن المكان كان مرکراً لإله الخصب الكلداني «لاحمو» وذكرته رسائل تل العمارنة باسم بیت إيلي لاحاما. وكان الكنعانيون يقيمون البيوت لآلهتهم أينما اعتقدوا بوجودها وكانت منطقة بيت لحم بسيولها الخصبة أهلا أن يسكنها إله الخصب. فبنوا له معبدا يطل على السيول دعي «بيت إيلي لاحاما» الذي بقي على مر العصور وتقلب الشعوب. وأي اسم أجدر وأقدس من اسم إله لتحافظ عليه وتحترمه وتتوارته الأقوام اللاحقة. كما ذكر المؤرخ الألماني، و.شريدر في جريدة الأداب الشرقية عدد 18 لعام 1915م عن صفائح رسائل تل العمارنة أن هذا الرأي في التسمية قد ثبت وتمكن. بينما التفسيرات العبرانية لاسم بیت لحم ببيت الخبز فهي شعبية ترکت نهائيا.\nظهر رأي يتردد في المراجع بالرغم من عدم صحته وهو أن قبيلة عربية تدعم لخم سكنت هذه المنطقة، بعد نزوحها من الجزيرة العربية خمسمئة عام قبل الميلاد عندما نزح المنائيون ولحق بهم قبیلتا لخم وجذام، فسكن اللخميون الصحراء ما بين الرملة ومصر وقسم منهم في الجولان وحوران وباسان حتى مدينة نوا، أما الجذامیون فسكنوا غور الأردن من طبريا حتى اللجون، يمون وعكا، ويكفي النظر إلى تاريخ النزوح لننفي أي علاقة باسم بيت لحم الذي ذكر قبل 1800 عام قبل الميلاد. وليس لدولة اللخميين في الحيرة في العراق كذلك أي علاقة لتسمية بيت لحم. إذ ظهرت دولة اللخميين حوالي القرن الخامس ميلادي فقط.\nودُعيت ببيت لحم بافراتا وهي كلمة كلدانية معناها الخصبة (تكوين 35 : 16، 19) (منيحا 5 : 2) (راعوت 4)، وذكر المورخ اليهودي يوسفوس فلافيوس\" آن راحيل\nدفنت في بلاد افراتا\". وجدير بالذكر أن القمح البري وجد في هذه المنطقة.\nوبني الكنعانيون بيتا آخر «لإيلي لاحاما» في شمال البلاد في الجليل إلى الشمال الغربي من مدينة الناصرة وعلى بعد أحد عشر كيلومترا منها، ذكرتها التوراة عدة مرات ولربما كانت أكثر أهمية من بيت لحم الجنوب لخصب محیطها وغنى أهلها. وكانت تابعة لسبط زبلون زمن الإسرائيليين: (يشوع 19 : 10)، (قضاة 12 : 8) \nشيد الألمان الهيكليون قريتهم ببيت لحم على آثار بیت لحم القديمة عام 1901م، وبقيت مزدهرة حتى احتلها اليهود عام 1948 لتصبح يهودية، وللتفرقة عرفت بيت لحم الجنوبية باليهودية والشمالية ببيت لحم الجليل.\nوبظهور النبي داوود في بيت لحم الصغرى بزغ اسمها من الظلمة إلى النور، إذ جاء صموئيل النبي إلى بيت لحم ليصبح ابن يسي الأصغر ملكا على اليهود (صموئيل الأول 16 : 1). وفي يوم التقدمة عند اليهود سكب صموئيل الزيت من الفرن على رأس داوود وأخذ اسم هذا يعلو على اسم شاول الملك آنذاك فامتلأ حقدا عليه. ويذكر (صموئيل الأول 20 : 29) کیف اختبأ داوود من شاول خوفا منه إذ حاول قتله. واعتذر یوناشاس ابن شاول لأبيه عن صديقه داوود لعدم حضوره وليمة الملك بأنه ذهب إلى بيت لحم بمناسبة رأس الشهر القمري ليقدم الذبيحة مع أهله: وتقديم الذبيحة على هيكل مقدس، طقس، لا بد وأن الإسرائيليون توارثوه عن الكنعانين - بنت إيلي لاحاما. ويعتقد أن هذا البيت المقدس كان يطل على السهول الخصبة والصحراء الشرقية حيث تقوم اليوم المقدسات المسيحية، حيث اشتعلت نيران التقدمة لترضي إيلي لاحاما الكنعاني وثم التهمت النيران قرابين الإسرائيليين لترضي إلاههم يهوه، ثم جاءت المسيحية فالوثنية فالمسيحية ثانية لتشيد مقدساتها على أنقاض المقدسات السالفة.\n\nودعي داود بابن يسى الأفراتي (صموئيل الأول 17 : 12)  وينسب اليمالك والد زوج راعوث إلى هذا النسب أيضا (راعوث 1 : 2) ولما تزوج بوعاز التلحمي من راعوث الأرملة تمني له مواطنوه «أن يزدهر بيتها في افراتا ويشتهر في بيت لحم» (راعوت 4 : 11)  وأنجبت راعوثم بن بوعاز ابنا هو عوبید والد يسی والد داوود. فأصبح اسم هذا النسل مربتوا باسم بيت لحم، وذكر ميخا في نبواته (5 : 2) حوالي 750 عام قبل الميلاد: «أما أت يا بيت لحم أفراته وأنت صغيرة أن تكوني بين أوف يهوذا، فمنك يخرج لي الذي يكون متسلطا على إسرائيل ومخارجة منذ القديم، منذ أيام الأزل» \nكذلك ذكر في (أخبار الأيام الأولى 2 : 19، 24، 50) أن هذا النسل الذي كان يسكن محيط بيت لحم (بيت افرات) ينسب دائما لافراتا. وكل هذا يشهد أن الاسم أفراتا أطلق على المنطقة التي مركزها بيت لحم.\n\nالتاريخ\nالعهد الكنعاني\nلقد سكن الكنعانيون المدينة سنة 2000 ق.م، ويروى أن النبي يعقوب جاء إلى هذه المدينة وهو في طريقه إلى الخليل، وماتت زوجته راحيل في مكان قريب من بيت لحم يعرف اليوم بقبة راحيل وفي بيت لحم ولد الملك داوود. وتوالت عليها الأحداث، وكانت في العصور القديمة قرية متواضعة تكتنفها الأودية العميقة من جهاتها الثلاث. وكانت خصبة الموقع تنتشر فيها حقول القمح. وفي القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد -\tظهرت في مخطوطات تل العمارنة منطقة اسمها بيت لحم وذلك عند الحديث عن أنباء الحروب التي قامت جنوب القدس. من المحتمل أن أول استيطان بشري وقع فيها عندما حطت بعض جماعات من البدو حول النبع الواقع على بعد 200 متر من كنيسة الميلاد.\nتظهرُ أول إشارة تاريخية إلى المدينة في رسائل تل العمارنة (حوالي 1400 قبل الميلاد) عندما ناشد ملك القدس سيده الأعلى، ملك مصر، للحصول على المُساعدة لاستعادة السيطرة على «بيت - لحمي» في أعقاب الاضطرابات من جانب عبيرو. ويعتقد أن تشابه هذا الاسم مع شكلها الحديث يدُل على أنها كانت مُستوطنة كنعانية، الذين يملُكون ثقافية ولغوية سامية مع الوافدين على المدينة لاحقًا.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي عام 325 بعد إعلان حرية التعبد للديانة المسيحية، طلب القديس مكاريوس بطريرك القدس من الإمبراطور أن يعيد المكان المقدس، فبنت القديسة هيلانة بازيليك الميلاد. في عام 384 مع وصول القديس هيرونيموس إلى بيت لحم قام في المدينة مركز عبادة لاتيني دام بعد وفاته سنين عديدة. في عام 614 أدّى غزو جيوش كسرى إلى خراب اليهودية ولم ينج من بيت لحم سوى بازيليك الميلاد وذلك كما يقال بفضل رسم للمجوس قائم على جدار البازيليك. والمجوس وهم ملوك الفرس الذين سجدوا ليسوع الطفل بحسب الرواية الإنجيلية.\n\nاستمدت بيت لحم شهرتها العالمية الكبرى من مولد يسوع فيها. ويروى أن يوسف النجار، ومريم العذراء ذهبا إلى بيت لحم لتسجيل اسمهما في الإحصاء العام، فولدت مريم وليدها هناك. وترى المصادر المسيحية أن الولادة كانت في مغارة قريبة من القرية، ولكن القرآن (يقول): (فاجأها المخاض إلى جذع النخلة) وفي سنة 330 م بنت هيلانة أم قسطنطين الكبير، كنيسة فوق المغارة التي قيل إن يسوع ولد فيها، وهي اليوم أقدم كنيسة في العالم. والمغارة تقع داخل كنيسة الميلاد، ومنحوته في صخر كلسي، وتحتوي على غرفتين صغيرتين، وفي الشمالية منها بلاطة رخامية، منزل منها نجمة فضية، حيث يقال أن يسوع ولد هناك. وعندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس، توجه إلى بيت لحم، وفيها أعطى سكانها أمانًا خطيًا على أرواحهم وأولادهم وممتلكاتهم وكنائسهم. ولما حان وقت الصلاة، صلى بإشارة من راهب، أمام الحنية الجنوبية للكنيسة، التي أخذ المسلمون يقيمون فيها صلواتهم، فرادى، وجعل الخليفة على النصارى إسراجها وتنظيفها. وهكذا صار المسلمون والمسيحيون يقيمون صلواتهم جنباً إلى جنب.\nتذكر بيت لحم في العهد الجديد باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع: «ولما ولد يسوع في بيت لحم اليهودية» (مت 2: 1 5، لو 2: 4 15)، ونتيجة لذلك حدثت مذبحة الأطفال الأبرياء بأمر هيرودس الملك (مت 2: 8 و16). وحيث أن هادريان قد جرب بيت لحم تماما، واقام في موضعها نصبا مقدسا للاله «ادونيس»، فلابد ان تكريم تلك المدينة باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع، يرجع إلي ما قبل عصر هادريان (132 م). وقد اقام قسطنطين الملك (حوالي 330 م) كنيسة على الطراز الروماني فوق موقع كهف المذود الذي شهد مولد يسوع. وتعتبر هذه الكنيسة حتى اليوم أهم مقصد للسياح، في المدينة. وهي لم يطرا عليها تغيير كبير، رغم أن جستنيان قد وسع فيها وزينها، ورغم ما تعرضت له من تهدم وترميم.\n\nالحكم العربي الإسلامي\nفي سنة 648 م دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الإسلامي، وزارها الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب الذي لم يصلّ داخل كنيسة المهد، خوفاً من أن تحدث نزاعات في المستقبل على الكنيسة بين المسلمين والمسيحيين حيث صلى بجانبها. وكانت المدينة قد اُلحقت بجند فلسطين التابع لولاية الشام بعد أن تم فتح جميع أراضي بلاد الشام على يد عدد من القادة منهم عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح.\nيشار إلى أنه تم بناء مسجد في بيت لحم عام 1860 وهو مسجد عمر نسبة للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب، والذي تم ترميمه حتى العام 1954 تحت الإدارة الأردنية للمدينة. وكانت الأرض التي تم بناء المسجد عليها تم التبرع بها من قبل الكنيسة الأرثوذكسية اليونانية.\nوقد عاش أبناء الديانتين المسيحية والإسلامية في هذه المدينة بروح من الإخاء والتعاون وتمارس كل فيهما شعائرها الدينية ونشاطاتها الاقتصادية الاجتماعية على الرغم من أن المدينة تعرضت لفترات من المد والجزر حسب الحكم القائم، ومن أكثر العهود ازدهارًا بالنسبة لبيت لحم هو زمن هارون الرشيد 786-809 م والدولة الفاطمية 952-1094 م، حيث راجت التجارة وتيسرت الحرية والأمن ورممت الكنائس وأماكن العبادة.\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nفي 1099 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الصليبي بعد أن دخلها الجيش الصليبي بقيادة تانكرد فدمر المدينة واحرقها ولم يتبق منها إلا كنيسة المهد. لم يكتف الصليبيون بما حازوا عليه، فقاموا بتوسيع حدود المملكة، ومع أواخر يوليو 1099 غزوا شمال فلسطين، ثم وصل جيش الفاطميين في 12 أغسطس فالتقى وجيش المملكة الوليدة في عسقلان، وأحرز الصليبيون نصرًا هامًا ضمن لهم السيطرة على الساحل الفلسطيني؛ وقد دار خلاف بين أمراء المملكة حول طبيعة الدولة بين كونها دولة دينية يحكمها أسقفها ديبامرت مبعوث البابا، أو دولة مدنية يحكمها جودفري، واتفق أخيرًا على كونها دولة مدنية وذلك بمباركة ديبامبرت مبعوث البابا إلى المملكة، رغم أن طموحه هذا عاد للظهور بعد وفاة جودفري. عام 1100 توفي جودفري بنتيجة المرض، وخلفه شقيقه بالدوين الأول المتحدر من بولونيا وقد انتخب في 11 نوفمبر وتمّ التتويج في بيت لحم يوم 25 ديسمبر 1100 وهو يوم عيد الميلاد، بعد تنافس مع تانكرد والأسقف ديامبرت حول وراثة العرش، وقد تم إرضاء تانكرد بمنحه إمارة أنطاكية بعد أسر أميرها في حلب. أما بالدوين فكان أول من خلع عليه لقب «ملك المملكة اللاتينية في القدس»، ما شكل ترسيخًا لهوية الدولة الجديدة، وقد قسمت الدولة إلى أربع مطرانيات وأبرشيات عديدة تحت سلطة بطريرك القدس.\nوقد دام الحكم الصليبي لبيت لحم حتى عام 1187 حيث عادت لأصحابها بعد انتصار المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على الصليبين في معركة حطين. وفي عام 1229 عادت مدينة بيت لحم لحكم الصليبين بموجب الاتفاقية التي وقعت بين ممثلي الخليفة الكامل فخر الدين وأمير أربيل صلاح الدين وممثلي الإمبراطور فريدريك. لكنهم فقدوها نهائيا بعد عدة سنين فقط.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nفي عام 1244 تمكن المسلمون بقيادة نجم الدين من استعادة المدينة بشكل نهائي، قام بعدها الظاهر بيبرس بدخول المدينة عام 1263 ودمرا أبراجها وهدم أسوارها، وفي عام 1517 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني، وبعد تطور وسائل النقل والمواصلات تحولت المدينة إلى مركز جذب هام للحجاج القادمين من أوروبا وانعكست أثاره على الأوضاع في المدينة وازدهرت صناعة الصوف والخزف وغيرها إلا أن سوء الأوضاع الاقتصادية دفع بالكثير من أبناء المدينة إلى الهجرة خارجها.\nفي القرن التاسع عشر - ومع بداية القرن الماضي أخذت المدينة بالنمو خاصة على أيدي المسيحيين الذين كانوا يشكلون الأكثرية العظمى. في عام 1831، عندما احتل محمد علي باشا مصر المدينة، طرد المسلمون المسيحيين وأمر الباشا بهدم حيّهم. وبعد عشرة أيام أعاد الأتراك بناءه.\nمن 1831 إلى 1841، كانت فلسطين تحت حكم أسرة محمد علي من مصر. خلال هذه الفترة، عانت المدينة من الزلازل الذي ضربها، فضلًا عن تدمير القوات المصرية لحي مسلم في عام 1834، على ما يبدو أنتقامًا لمقتل أحد الموالين لرعاية إبراهيم باشا. في عام 1841، أصبحت بيت لحم تحت سيطرة الحكم العثماني مرة أخرى وظلت كذلك حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى. في العهد العثماني، من المشاكل التي واجهتها سكان بيت لحم البطالة والخدمة العسكرية الإجبارية والضرائب الثقيلة، مما أدى إلى هجرة جماعية خاصة إلى أميركا الجنوبية.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت بيت لحم بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى المنطقة المدوّلة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قام الأردن بضمها مع سائر مناطق الضفة الغربية عام 1951. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى حرب 1967.\nارتفعت درجة بيت لحم الإدارية بعد أن كانت (ناحية) في العهد العثماني إلى (قضاء) في العهد البريطاني، يقع بين اقضية القدس والخليل وأريحا. وبقي كذلك لعام 1944 م حيث الغي هو وقضاء اريحا والحقا بقضاء القدس. فكان ذلك آخر تغيير إداري قامت به الحكومة البريطانية في فلسطين.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكان نصيب بيت لحم أن يتم الحاقها بالمنطقة المدولة مع القدس.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة.\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي بيت لحم وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة بيت لحم بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع بيت لحم مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة بيت لحم قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 21 ديسمبر 1995، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من بيت لحم، وبعد ثلاثة أيام أصبحت المدينة تحت إدارة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وسيطرتُها العسكرية الكاملة بناءً على الاتفاق الانتقالي بشأن الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة في عام 1995. وأصبحت المدينة مُنذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nخلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، في 2000-2001، تضررت بشدة البنية التحتية في بيت لحم والسياحة. وفي عام 2002، كانت المدينة منطقة القتال الرئيسية في عملية الدرع الواقي، عملية عسكرية كبرى من جانب الجيش الإسرائيلي.\nخلال العملية، قام الجيش الإسرائيلي بمُحاصرة كنيسة المهد، حيث كان حوالي 200 مسلح فلسطيني لجأوا إلى الكنيسة. واستمر الحصار لمدة 39 يومًا وقتلوا تسعة من المسلحين ورجل كنيسي. انتهى الحصار باتفاق على نفي 13 من المسلحين المطلوبين إلى دول أوروبية مختلفة وموريتانيا.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nلبيت لحم أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). في بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وذلك فوق كهف أو مغارة، والتي يعتقد أنها الإسطبل الذي ولد فيه يسوع. يعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداب آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قد قضى ثلاثين عاما من حياته فيه يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\n\nيفهم من هذا النص أن يوسف ومريم لم يجدا لهما مكانا في منزل كمهام المعروف في بيت لحم فنزلا في مغارة تأوي اليها البهائم ويروي متى الإنجيلي أنه بعد ولادة يسوع، قام بعض المجوس من الشرق بزيارة هيرودس للاستعلام عن مكان «الشخص الذي ولد ملكا لليهود»، لأنهم رأوا نجمه في الشرق. كان هيرودس، ملك اليهود، قلقًا من احتمال أن يفقد عرشه. قام هيرودس بتجميع رؤساء الكهنة وكتّاب الشعب وسألهم أين وُلد «الممسوح» (المسيح، باليونانية: Ὁ Χριστός، هو كريستوس). أجابوا: في بيت لحم، حيث تنبا ميخا قبل سبعمئة وخمسين عاما عن قدومه «وانت يا بيت لحم ارض يهوذا لست الصغرى بین روساء يهوذا لأن منك يخرج مدبر يرعی شعبي اسرائيل». أرسل هيرودس المجوس إلى بيت لحم، وأمرهم بالبحث عن الطفل، وبعد أن يعثروا عليه، «أن يخبروه عنه، حتى يذهب هو أيضاً ليعبده». وقدم المجوس إلى بيت لحم وقدّموا للمولود هدايا من ذهب ولبان ومر. وانصرفوا من طريق آخر مارین بحقل الرعاة شرقا كي لا يقابلوا هيرودس الذي ظنوا فيه شرا بعد أن تم تحذيرهم في حلم بعدم إبلاغ هيرودس. وبالمثل، تم تحذير يوسف في حلم أن هيرودس كان يعتزم قتل يسوع، لذلك فر هو وعائلته إلى مصر. عندما أدرك هيرودس أنه قد خدع، أصدر أوامر بقتل جميع الأولاد الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سنتين في بيت لحم والمناطق المجاورة لها من ابن عامين فما دون لعله يقتل الطفل المولود بينهم. بقي يوسف وعائلته في مصر حتى وفاة هيرودس، ثم انتقلوا إلى الناصرة في الجليل لتجنب العيش تحت حكم أرخيلاوس ابن هيرودس.\nتُذكر رواية الميلاد في إنجيلي متى ولوقا، وتغدوا الرواية في إنجيل لوقا أكثر تفصيلاً؛ عناصر الرواية الإنجيلية للميلاد مفادها أن مريم قد ظهر لها جبرائيل مرسلاً من قبل الله وأخبرها أنها ستحبل بقوّة الروح القدس بطفل «يكون عظيمًا وابن العلي يدعى، ولن يكون لملكه نهاية»،لوقا 1/32] وعندما اضطرب يوسف النجار خطيب مريم من روايتها ظهر له الملاك أيضًا في الحلم تصديقًا لرواية مريم وتشجيعًا له، ويتفق متى ولوقا أن الميلاد قد تمّ في بيت لحم مدينة النبي داود لا في مدينة الناصرة حيث كانا يعيشان وحيث تمت البشارة، يعود ذلك تتميمًا للنبؤات السابقة حول مكان الميلاد سيّما نبؤة النبي ميخا، أما السبب المباشر فهو طلب أغسطس قيصر إحصاء سكان الإمبراطورية الرومانية تمهيدًا لدفع الضرائب، ولذلك سافر يوسف مع مريم وكان حينها قد ضمها إلى بيته كزوجته دون أن تنشأ بينهما علاقة زوجية، وعند وصولهما إلى بيت لحم لم يجدا مكانًا للإقامة في فندق أو نزل وحان وقت وضع مريم، فبحسب إنجيل لوقا وضعت طفلها في مذود ولفته بقماط.لوقا 2/7] وإن ذكر المذود هو الدافع الأساسي للاعتقاد بوجود المغارة أو الحظيرة، لأن الحظائر عادة كانت عبارة عن كهوف أما المذود فهو مكان وضع علف الحيوانات، وكان أوريجانوس قد أثبت المغارة وقال أنه نقل القصة عن تقاليد أقدم.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيت لحم 31°43′0″N 35°12′0″E وعلى ارتفاع حوالي 775 متر (2,543 قدم) فوق مستوى سطح البحر، 30 مترا (98 قدم) أعلى من القدس. بيت لحم وتقع في الجزء الجنوبي من جبال الخليل.\nتقع المدينة على بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس، 73 كيلومترًا (45 ميل) شمال شرق قطاع غزة والبحر المتوسط، و 75 كيلومترًا (47 ميل) إلى الغرب من عمان عاصمة الأردن، و 59 كيلومترًا (37 ميل) إلى الجنوب الشرقي من تل أبيب وعلى بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس.\n\nمن المدن والبلدات القريبة تشمل بيت صفافا والقدس في الشمال، وبيت جالا إلى الشمال الغربي، حوسان إلى الغرب، الخضر وأرطاس إلى الجنوب الغربي، وبيت ساحور إلى الشرق. وتقع بيت جالا، وبيت ساحور تُشكل تجمع مع بيت لحم وتقع مخيمات اللاجئين عايدة ومخيم بيت جبرين داخل حدود المدينة.\nتقع البلدة القديمة في وسط المدينة، وتتألف من ثمانية أرباع سكنية (أحياء)، المبنية بأسلوب الفسيفساء التي تشكل المنطقة المحيطة ساحة كنيسة المهد. الأرباع تضمُ المسيحيين وربع واحد فقط يضمُ مسلمين. سُميت معظم الأحياء المسيحية حسب أسماء عشائر الغساسنة العربية التي استقرت هُناك. وشكل المغتربين العرب المسيحيين حي القواوسة الذين أتوا من تقوع في القرن الثامن عشر. هُناك أيضًا ربع السريانية يقع خارج البلدة القديمة، تعود أصول سكانها من مديات وماسارتي «وMa'asarte» في تركيا. يبلغ عدد سُكان البلدة القديمة 5,000 نسمة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nمناطق المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة في بيت لحم أهم مناطقها على الإطلاق لوجود أهم المعالم الدينية المسيحية فيها، وهي تتوسط المدينة وشوارعها. من أهم تلك الشوارع: طريق الخليل، الشارع الجديد، شارع بيت ساحور، شارع بولس السادس، شارع السينما، شارع الفرير، شارع جمال عبد الناصر.\nالمخيمات\n\nتضم منطقة بيت لحم ثلاثة مخيمات رئيسية هي مخيم عايدة، مخيم بيت جبرين، ومخيم الدهيشة. ومثلها مثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسست فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها الأونروا من الحكومة الأردنية.\n\nمخيم عايدة: تأسس عام 1950 بين مدينتي بيت لحم وبيت جالا. ويمتد فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,71 كيلومتر مربع لم تنم بشكل كاف مع نمو مجتمع اللاجئين. ولذلك، فإن المخيم يعاني من مشاكل اكتظاظ شديدة.\nمخيم بيت جبرين: تأسس عام 1950 في قلب مدينة بيت لحم. وهو يعد أصغر مخيم للاجئين في الضفة الغربية حيث تبلغ مساحته 0.02 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وغالبا ما يطلق على المخيم أيضا اسم مخيم عزة.\nمخيم الدهيشة: تأسس عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.31 كيلومتر مربع ضمن حدود بلدية بيت لحم.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في بيت لحم مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتر.\n\nالسكان\nوفقًا لسجلات الضرائب العثمانية، شكل المسيحيون نسبة 60% من السكان في القرن السادس عشر، وفي منتصف القرن 16 أصبحت أعداد المسلمين والمسيحيين متساوية. لم يكن هناك مسلمون في نهاية القرن، وبلغ عدد سكانها 287 (سجل الذكور البالغين دافعي الضرائب). وطلب آنذاك من المسيحيين وغير المسلمين دفع ضريبة الجزية في جميع أنحاء الدولة العثمانية. في عام 1867، وصف زائر أمريكي المدينة الذي بلغ عدد سكانها 3,000 إلى 4,000 منهم 100 يتبعون البروتستانتية و 300 من المسلمين و«ما تبقى ينتمون إلى الكنائس اللاتينية واليونانية مع نسبة قليلة من الأرمن»  ووفقًا لتقرير آخر من نفس العام بلغ عدد السكان المسيحيين 3000، وبالإضافة إلى 50 من المسلمين.\nفي عام 1948، شكلت المسيحية نسبة 85% من التركيبة السُكانية للمدينة معظمها من الطوائف اليونانية الأرثوذكسية والكاثوليكية، أما نسبة المسلمين بلغت 13% مسلم سني.\nوفقًا للإحصائيات الإسرائيلية عام 1967، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 14,439 نسمة منهم 7,790 نسمة مسلمين ما نسبته 53,9% بينما بلغ عدد المسيحيين 6,231 نسمة ما يعادل 46,1% من سكان بيت لحم.\nوفقًا لتعداد الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء عام 1997، فقد بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 21,670 نسمة، بما في ذلك 6,570 لاجئ وهو ما يمثل 30.3% من سكان المدينة. وفي عام 1997، أما التوزيع العمري السكاني لفترات عُمرية مختلفة كالتالي: 27,4% تحت سن عشرة سنوات و 20% 10-19 سنة و 17.3% 20-29 سنة، 17.7% 30-44 سنة و 12.1% 45-64 سنة و 5.3% فوق سن 65 عامًا. بلغ عدد الذكور 11,079 أما عدد الإناث 10,594.\nوفقا لتقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 29,930 نسمة في مُنتصف عام 2006. ومع ذلك، في تعداد 2007 كشف عن وجود 25,266 نسمة منهم 12,753 ذكورًا و 12,513 من الإناث. و 6,709 وحدة سكنية منها 5,211 كانت للأُسر. أما مُتوسط عدد أفراد الأسر 4,8.\nبحلول عام 2005، كانت نسبة السكان المسيحيين تراجعت بشكل كبير، إلى حوالي 40% من 50%. المسجد الوحيد في المدينة القديمة هو مسجد عمر، ويقع في ساحة كنيسة المهد.\n\nالدين\nيدعى الكثير من سكان بيت لحم المسيحيين أنهم ينحدرون من العشائر المسيحية العربية التي قدمت من شبه الجزيرة العربية، أكبر هذه العشائر في المدينة: الفراحية ونجاجرة. العشائر السابقة الذكر قد تنحدرُ من الغساسنة الذين هاجروا من اليمن إلى منطقة وادي موسى في الوقت الحاضر الأردن في حين أن النجاجرة تنحدر من العرب في نجران في جنوب الحجاز. عشيرة عريقة أخرى في المدينة هي عناترة وتنحدر أصولهم من شبه الجزيرة العربية.\n\nأنخفضت أعداد المسيحيين في المدينة بشكل مُطرد، ويرجع ذلك في المقام الأول إلى الهجرة. انخفاض معدل مواليد المسيحيين يمثل أيضًا سببًا للانخفاض. في عام 1947، بلغت نسبة المسيحيين حوالي 85%، ولكن بحلول عام 1998 انخفضت النسبة إلى 40%. في عام 2005، وضح رئيس بلدية بيت لحم فيكتور بطارسة أن \"نتيجة للتوتر سواء الجسدي أو النفسي والحالة الاقتصادية السيئة، كثير من الناس يهاجرون، سواء مسيحيين أو مسلمين، لكن الهجرة أكثر أنتشارًا بين المسيحيين، لأنهم بالفعل هم أقلية.\nأدت اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية إلى أنخفاض ناتج القطاع السياحي والتي أثرت على الأقلية المسيحية وعلى أصحاب الفنادق في بيت لحم الذين يقدمون خدمات المُلبية لإحتياجات السياج الأجانب. أشير تحليل إحصائي لهجرة المسيحيين من المدينة لانعدام الفرص الاقتصادية والتعليمية، خصوصًا الطبقة الوسطى والمتعلمة منهم. مُنذ اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، غادر 10% من السكان المسيحيين المدينة.\nذكرت الصحيفة الإسرائيلية جيروزليم بوست ان «تقلص أعداد الطوائف المسيحية الفلسطينية في الأراضي المقدسة وبشكل خاص في بيت لحم جاء كنتيجة مباشرة بسبب انتمائها إلى الطبقة المتوسطة والعليا». يذكر أن المسيحيين لديهم صورة عامة كنخبة متعلمة وذات امتيازات طبقية، وكذلك عدم لجوئهم إلى العنف، مما يجعلهم أكثر عرضة للتعرض لأعمال عنف. يُذكر أن بسبب الهجرة المسيحية يتواجد غالبية مسيحيين بيت لحم خارج العالم العربي بشكل خاص في أمريكا اللاتينية التي تضم نصف مليون فلسطيني في أمريكا اللاتينية والوسطى حيث أن 80 إلى 85% منهم هم من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين. وتضم التشيلي أكبر جالية فلسطينية مسيحية في العالم خارج منطقة فلسطين حيث يصل أعدادهم إلى 350,000 وتعود أصول غالبيتهم إلى بيت لحم وبيت جالا وبيت ساحور ويعتبرون من الاقليات الناجحة جدًا فغالبيتهم ينتمون إلى الطبقة العليا والوسطى ومن المتعلمون كما وقد برز عدد منهم في السياسة والاقتصاد والثقافة.\nفي عام 2006، ووفقًا للاستطلاع الذي أجراهُ المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث والحوار الثقافي في المدينة أن 90% من المسيحيين قالوا أن لديهم أصدقاء مسلمين، ووافق 73,3% منهم على أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية تُعامل التراث المسيحي في المدينة باحترام ونسب 78% منهم سبب هجرة المسيحيين إلى القيود الإسرائيلية التي تفرُضها على السفر.\nإن مدينة بيت لحم هي من أقدس المواقع المسيحية في العالم كونها المدينة التي فيها وُلِدَ يسوع المسيح، وبسبب قدسية مدينة بيت لحم لدى العالم المسيحي تتواجد في المدينة عدد كبير من الكنائس والأديرة فضلًا عن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة، بالإضافة إلى المؤسسات المسيحيّة المختلفة من مدراس وجامعة كاثوليكية ومستشفيات شتى، وكونها مدينة ميلاد يسوع تُحظى المدينة بشعبية واسعة وترتبط بعيد الميلاد. كانت كنيسة المهد هي الأولى بين الكنائس الثلاث التي بناها الإمبراطور قسطنطين في مطلع القرن الرابع الميلادي حين أصبحت المسيحية ديانة الدولة الرسمية وكان ذلك استجابة لطلب الأسقف ماكاريوس في المجمع المسكوني الأول في نيقيه عام 325 للميلاد. دخلت كنيسة المهد سنة 2012 قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، كنيسة المهد هي أول موقع فلسطيني يدرج ضمن لائحة التراث العالمي لمنظمة اليونيسكو. الجدول

طرازان معماريان مختلفان: الطراز القديم السائد في البلدة القديمة حيث القباب والجدران السميكة المبنية من الحجر الكلسي والشبابيك والأبواب على شكل أقواس، والمباني فيها ملتصقة ببعضها ومتراصة وشوارعها ضيقة ومقسمة إلى حارات لكي يسهل الدفاع عنها. أما الطراز الثاني فهو الطراز الحديث السائد في مناطق السكن الجديدة حيث البيوت الحديثة المستقلة أو العمارات المكونة من طبقات.\nويطوق المدينة الآن مجموعة من المستوطنات التي يطلق عليها مجموعة (غوش عتسيون) ووصل عدد المستوطنات حولها عام 1985 إلى 16 مستوطنة وتشكل مستوطنة افرات مركزها وأكبرها، ويخطط لإقامة 9 مستوطنات حتى عام 2010.\nكونها المدينة التي شهدت

مع معطف بلا أكمام من الصوف المنسوج محليًا التي تُلبس فوق الفساتين. تمتازُ الفساتين للمُناسبات الخاصة بأنها مصنوعة من الحرير المُقلم مع أكمام مُجنحه مع سترة قصيرة «تقصيرة» والمعروفة باسم سترة بيت لحم. التقصيرة مُصنعة من المخمل أو الجوخ، وعادة تكون مع تطريز كثيف.\nالتطريز التحريري لمنطقة بيت لحم يجمع بين الفضة والذهب وخيوط الحرير لتزيين واجهة وجوانب وأكمام ثياب الزفاف التقليدية، وحيث تملأ هذه

          "content": "## Overview\nBethlehem (Arabic: بيت لحم, Beit Lahm, Hebrew: בית לחם Beit Lechem) is a small city located some 10 km (6 miles) south of the Old City of Jerusalem within the West Bank, in an \"Area A\" zone administered by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n## History\nThe \"little town\" of Bethlehem, mentioned in Christmas carols, attracts pilgrims worldwide on account of its description in the New Testament (and particularly the Gospels) as the Biblical birthplace of Jesus, whom Christians believe to be Messiah and Son of God. The Church of the Nativity, one of the oldest churches in the world, is the focus of Christian veneration within the city. Modern textual analysis has almost universally drawn the conclusion that Nazareth, the place where Jesus spent most of his later life and the home town of Joseph and Mary was probably his actual birthplace, but that has not lessened the draw of this city for Christian pilgrims.\nBethlehem is also revered by Jews and Muslims as the birthplace and home town of David, Biblical prophet and King of Israel, as well as the traditional site of Rachel's Tomb (on the outskirts of the town).\nAlthough also home to many Muslims, Bethlehem remains home to one of the largest Arab Christian communities in the Middle East (despite significant emigration which has resulted in a growing Muslim majority) and one of the chief cultural and tourism drawcards for the Palestinian community. The Bethlehem agglomeration also includes the small towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour, the latter also having Biblical significance.\nBuilding up to the Millennium in the year 2000, Bethlehem underwent a massive largely foreign-funded project called Bethlehem 2000 in hopes of turning Bethlehem into a major tourist destination comparable to destinations such as Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in tourism infrastructure. Unfortunately, a year later, the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation occurred and the ensuing violence, including a standoff between Palestinian fighters holed up in the Church of the Nativity and Israeli troops, scuttled these tourism efforts. Although tension remains high in Israeli-Palestinian relations, violence is a thing of the past in Bethlehem and many in Bethlehem hope to continue on where Bethlehem 2000 started them off.\nThis article also covers nearby towns, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\n## Orientation\nA long snake of town, the main thoroughfare of Bethlehem is Manger Street which stretches from Rachel's Tomb (and the road to Jerusalem) all the way to Manger Square, the focal point of the city. Manger Square is flanked by the Church of the Nativity on one side and the Mosque of Omar on the other. The Old Town and the souq (market), which are best navigated on foot, stretch up the hill from Manger Square.\nThe name means \"The House of Bread\" in Hebrew, and \"The House of Meat\" in Arabic. However, it seems likely that both meanings have been retrofitted onto what was originally the House of Lachma, the Mesopotamian god of fertility. The area has been settled since 5,000 BC and there is some evidence that the town is mentioned in the Egyptian Amarna letters (1400 BC). The Old Testament Book of Ruth (c. 1150 BC) has the first certain reference to Bethlehem; it tells the story of Naomi, who left Bethlehem during a famine, and later returned with her daughter-in-law Ruth. Still, Bethlehem remained a small town in the shadow of mighty Jerusalem, and according to most estimates, it had some 300 to 1000 inhabitants at the time of the event that gave Bethlehem its fame, namely the birth of Jesus.\nSomewhat surprisingly, aside from noting that the Nativity indeed took place there, the New Testament virtually ignores Bethlehem. And things didn't change immediately afterwards: wrecked during the Bar-Kochba revolt (132-135 AD), the Romans set up a shrine to Adonis on the site of the Nativity. Only in 326 was the first Christian church constructed, when Helen, the mother of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, visited Bethlehem. Afterwards, it grew slowly but steadily, achieving its pinnacle as a strong fortified city during the Crusader era, but the Ottomans razed the fortifications and reduced Bethlehem back into the village it was 2000 years earlier.\nThe setback proved only temporary, and despite the turbulence of the 20th century the town has (as of 2000) grown to an estimated 184,000 inhabitants. On December 21, 1995, Bethlehem became one of the areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. In the city, 41% of the population is Christian, while 59% is Muslim. Christians used to be a large majority, but their numbers have declined throughout the 20th century. Although Arabic is the language of Bethlehem's inhabitants, English, French and other languages are widely spoken and understood by many people in Bethlehem.\nAlthough Bethlehem is a Palestinian town, it is also tourist-oriented. Because of Bethlehem's immense potential as a tourism magnet, the Palestinian Authority maintains a constant tourist police presence in the city. For example, if there is combat in Southern Israel and the Gaza Strip, this does not mean that trips to other Palestinian cities such as Bethlehem are unsafe. Bethlehem is a safe place for tourists to visit, and tourist numbers are increasing to this hidden gem of the Holy Land.\n\n## Local information\nBethlehem municipal\n\n## Get in\nMost travellers arrive via Jerusalem. Since Bethlehem is administered by the Palestinian Authority, there are security checks conducted by the Israeli military on access roads. When coming via the highway there are no barriers when going to Bethlehem, however on the other side there is 31.7053535.168831 highway 60 checkpoint on the road to Jerusalem. For instance, in case you're traveling by bus, soldiers will board to check the passengers' identity documents. On the local road north of Bethlehem, there's a bigger checkpoint (\"Rachel's Crossing\"/Checkpoint 300). To cross, one shows their passport to an Israeli soldier, places his/her bags into an x-ray machine and then walks through a metal detector, much like airport security. As with all areas under Palestinian Authority control, Israeli law forbids Israeli citizens to enter unless they receive approval from the Israeli Civil Administration. Tourists are free to enter and exit Bethlehem and go back to Jerusalem as many times as they would like without any restrictions. Make sure you bring your passport with your Israeli-issued tourist visa to enter and exit the Palestinian areas.\n\n## By car\nBe careful when using a hired car, as some/many rental companies in Israel make it clear that the car has to be used, and remain, on Israeli soil.\n\n## By bus\nFrom Jerusalem's HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate (\"Bab el-'Amoud\") bus 231 runs from here into Bethlehem (via Beit Jala). Even though the bus stop sign does not list it, bus 231 can also be boarded at the bus stop out of the Jaffa Gate and down the road a little – the bus comes from the tunnel. The average trip length is 30 min and costs ₪6.80. The 31.7119735.1992 last stop from Jerusalem in Bethlehem is along Hebron Road about 20 min walk from the Church of the Nativity away. Also, shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave from nearby Damascus Gate and manage the trip in 20 min.\nPalestinian bus 234 also leaves from HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate. It costs ₪4.70 and runs directly to the 31.72445535.2038233 Jerusalem-Bethlehem Checkpoint (Checkpoint 300) and back. From the checkpoint, you can either walk half an hour or take a taxi to the center of Bethlehem (₪10–25), which is about 3 km away. Egged bus 163 also goes here from the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, halting for instance at the Jaffa Gate bus stop. Travel time from Jaffa Gate is 30 min, price is ₪5.90.\nFrom Ramallah many shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave for Bethlehem. It is just a little pain to figure out the right bus station out of the (at least) four ones in Ramallah. The trip takes about an hour, goes all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nThe trip from Hebron with the final stop at the very bottom floor of the 31.70625535.2052384 Bethlehem bus station (only shared taxis (sherut)) will deliver you for less than ₪10.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxis (sherut/servees) for ₪12 to 31.76409335.2811625 Al Ezariya (Junction), a town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the driver where to get off to get to Bethlehem or take the GPS pointer as orientation. From the junction take another shared taxis to Bethlehem bus station (₪5-10).\n\n## On foot\nDevoted pilgrims often prefer to walk (and in happier times there has been a large procession at Christmas), at a brisk pace the trip is doable in 2 hr but there are plenty of ups and downs along the way and the summer heat is fearsome.\n\n## Get around\nBut Bethlehem is a small city, so taxi rides are extremely cheap; no trip within Bethlehem city should cost more than ₪20. To travel from Bethlehem to its neighboring suburbs of Beit Sahour or Beit Jala, it should be no more than ₪25-30. Just make sure, to only take service of the taxi ride and not a guided tour, which will cost you much more.\nTo travel to more distant sites (such as Herodium, any of the surrounding monasteries, or Solomon's Pools), it's advisable to negotiate a price with a taxi driver at the Bethlehem bus station. Many taxi drivers are willing to take you to a site, wait there while you tour a site and then take you back to Bethlehem for a negotiated price. Whenever negotiating a taxi price, always say the lowest price you think would be reasonable for the trip, and bargain with the driver from there. The driver will start as high as he thinks he can charge and bargain down for you. Make sure to agree on a price before going into a taxi.\n\n## See\n31.70430635.2076391 Church of the Nativity (From the last bus stop walk left through Pope Paul VI street until Manger Square. It's all straight, just make sure to take a left at the Lutheran church.). Undoubtedly the top attraction in Bethlehem, a veritable citadel built fortress-like on top of the cave where Jesus was born to Mary. It is one of the oldest churches in the world, and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The first incarnation of the building was erected on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I (the Great) in 330 CE. While the layout largely corresponds to Emperor Justinian's plans from 540 CE (the first building having been destroyed in a 536 riot), the church was first heavily fortified by the Crusaders and then degraded (mostly through neglect) under Mamluk rule. An earthquake in 1834 and a fire in 1869 didn't help. Today, the structure is mostly sound but somewhat dark and gloomy in appearance, only the adjoining Franciscan Church of St Catherine (dated 1881 and the site of the yearly December 24 midnight mass broadcast around the world) being in excellent shape. The alleged site of Jesus' birth is actually in a cave in the church (the original Manger where Jesus was born was a cave, not a shed, as popularly depicted). There is a star marking the exact location of Jesus' birth in the cave. The original Manger with the star marking Jesus' birth site is called the Grotto of the Nativity, and is accessible from inside the church. (The tomb of famed theologian and Bethlehem resident St. Jerome, who spent his life translating the Bible, is also in the cave with the Grotto.) Entrance to the entire complex is free, but in the high season (and especially on Jan 6th) be prepared for massive crowds and hour-long waits for entry into the Grotto. There are usually accredited but dodgy tour-guides waiting at the entrance or inside of the church who offer to give tours to groups/individuals, sometimes allowing you to skip the crowds. Makes sure to agree on a price before taking the tour, and if the promise was to skip the crowds and get into the crotto directly but not possible sometimes, lower the price by at least half. Otherwise do not support them, as it is unfair to the other visitors waiting.\n31.71866835.2018452 Rachel's Tomb (Separated from Bethlehem by the wall). Burial place of the matriarch Rachel, wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph and Benjamin is the second most important historical site in Bethlehem. (Genesis 35:19-20). It is a holy site in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As a result of the security situation, the Tomb's original structure has been surrounded by an Israeli fortress, barricading it off from Bethlehem. While the original tomb can still be seen in its entirety from within the fortress, access to the tomb is now only possible by vehicle, e.g. by taking the Egged bus that comes from Jerusalem or by hitchhiking the very short way.\n31.70741735.2291573 Shepherds' Fields. \"While shepherds watched their flocks by night...\" - rival locations in the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Sahour claim to be the site of the angel's visitation to the shepherds mentioned in the Gospels.    \n Orthodox Shepherds' Fields.

Three huge Herodian-era stone carved reservoirs capable of holding 160,000 m³ of water. They are located in a pine tree forest about 3 km from Bethlehem in a beautiful hiking area called the Artas Valley. In Artas, there is also the very beautiful Italian Order of the Sisters of Mary of the Garden built the Hortus Conclusus Convent and as well a Palestinian Folklore museum. Artas village also boasts an annual lettuce festival.\n31.7094435.2055567 King David's Wells (Biyar Daoud). King David's Wells in King David street, off Manger Square, are three Great Cisterns excavated in the rock in Ras Eftais, an eastern sector of Bethlehem, marking the site where David's army broke through a Philistine garrison to bring him water; \"Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem\" (2 Sam. 23:15). It is believed by some that under the adjacent Church of St. David is where the King is buried (as opposed to the traditional tomb in Jerusalem). The cisterns were discovered in 1895. The church rested on a vast Necropolis composed of 18 Arcosolia with two to six tombs each. The cemetery was Christian as proved by the inscription. The Catholic Action Club lies on the site of one of the cisterns.\n31.686535.18638 Convent and the Chapel of Hortus Conclusus (In nearby village of Artas). Monastery built in 1901. Hosts the Feast of Hortus Conclusus, which takes place on the third Sunday of August.

Right next to it, up the road, you can also find the 31.7151435.1873610 Virgin Mary Church.\nOld City. Is also good for a stroll and shopping if you haven't seen an Arab city before.\n31.703435.1612511 The Monastery of St. George (Al Khader Church) (In the Al Khader quarter, west of the centre. St. George makes for a convenient stop on the way (back) to Jerusalem. Take bus 231 (the one that came from Jerusalem originally) from Bethlehem centre, and get off at the last stop before the checkpoint towards Jerusalem, basically just before getting onto the highway after leaving Bethlehem/Beit Jala. From there it is less than 1 km west-wards to the Monastery/Church.). St. George was a very important Christian Saint for Orthodox Christians, also called \"Mar Jeriess\" in Arabic. The monastery is said to hold relics from the saint that possess healing powers-especially for mental illness. The monastery was used in the 19th century as a psychiatric facility to treat mental illness by using St George's relics. The site is also venerated in Muslim tradition as the setting for the Muslim prophet Al Khider's teachings. In mid-April or early May (it goes by the Julian calendar), the town (both Muslims and Christians) holds a festival for St. George that is worth seeing.\n31.70535.204212 St. Mary's Syriac Orthodox Church.

The Palestinian Authority doesn't charge a sales tax, so Bethlehem's shopkeepers charge much less for souvenirs. Bethlehem is a perfect place to practice those bargaining skills that you were hoping to try out!!\nIn peaceful times, Bethlehem's traders do a roaring trade in souvenirs for pilgrims to the town. In the current situation, the tour operators prefer to quickly hustle their guided groups in and out of the Nativity Church without allowing them time to look around Manger Square. Often, at the end of the tour, they will take their groups to a pre-selected souvenir shop and charge the owner of the shop a big commission for the sales made to the tour group. That means most smaller souvenir shops here are blessedly free from pilgrims, and also that the smaller shops are in desperate need of business. They remain, however, substantially less aggressive than Jerusalem's sellers. Souvenir shops in Bethlehem are much, much cheaper than in Jerusalem - with the same selection (surprisingly, many Bethlehem souvenir shops even have Jewish themed souvenirs). One must venture out of Manger square to the souvenir shops on Manger Street and also in the market place beside Manger Square past the Mosque of Omar. The smaller looking souvenir shops offer the best deals and very friendly service. Bethlehem is an awesome place to get all your Holy Land souvenirs for much, much cheaper than you would get them in Israel. If a price is listed in USD, it's a hiked price for tourists, so don't hesitate to bargain for a much lower price (you will almost always get a lower price if you ask for it).\nOn your way to the Milk Grotto Church, look for an Olive Wood factory located on the Milk Grotto Street.

Because tourists often stay in Jerusalem rather than Bethlehem, Bethlehem's hotels often offer much cheaper rates than their Israeli peers to encourage tourists to stay in the region rather than day-tripping. Bargaining for a cheaper hotel price usually works in Bethlehem.

          "content": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".\n\nEtymology\nJericho's name in Biblical Hebrew, Yəriḥo (יְרִיחוֹ) is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word rēḥ 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word Yaraḥ 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.\nJericho's Arabic name, Arīḥā, means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite rēḥ.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958.\nSubsequently, Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolò Marchetti excavated in 1997–2000. Since 2009, the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome (\"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH) under the direction of Nigro, Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.\n\nStone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring\nThe earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, tell means \"mound\"; consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.\n\nNatufian hunter-gatherers, c. 10,000 BCE\nEpipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000 BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\nJericho has evidence of settlement dating back to c. 10,000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic, c. 9500–6500 BCE\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic eras at Jericho are divided into PPNA and PPNB.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed PPNA. Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:\n\nsmall circular dwellings\nburial of the dead under the floor of buildings\nreliance on hunting of wild game\ncultivation of wild or domestic cereals\n\nAt Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\n\nThe Pre-Sultan (c. 8350 – 7370 BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft) settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over 8.5 metres (28 ft) high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered.\nThe wall and tower were built during the PPNA period around 8000 BCE. Carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that the tower was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall may have served as a defence against flood water (possibly to prevent the erosion of agricultural soil), with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, but no street planning. The identity and number of Jericho's inhabitants during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates as high as 2,000–3,000 and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses, and hunted wild animals.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nThe PPNB was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850 BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:\n\nExpanded range of domesticated plants\nPossible domestication of sheep\nApparent cult involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using plaster, and eyes set with shells in some cases\n\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of around five centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21.3 ft × 13.1 ft) and 7 m × 3 m (23.0 ft × 9.8 ft)) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\nChalcolithic\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nIn Early Bronze I, the stratigraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 village (EB IA, c. 3500 – 3200 BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 rural town (proto-urban, EB IB, c. 3200 – 3000 BCE).\nIn Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 foritifed town (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 with added towers and bastions to the fortification (EB IIB, c.2850 – 2700 BCE).\nIn the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450 BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600 BCE.\nDuring Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350 BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.\nIn Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300 – 2200 BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200 – 2000 BCE).\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nJericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system\" of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Carbon dating c. 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550.\nChronology (Nigro 2016)\n\nMiddle Bronze IA, Tell es-Sultan IVa1 (c. 2000/1950-1900 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IB, Tell es-Sultan IVa2 (c. 1900-1800 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIA, Tell es-Sultan IVb1 (c. 1800-1700 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIB, Tell es-Sultan IVb2 (c. 1700-1650 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIC/III, Tell es-Sultan IVc (c. 1650-1550 BC)\n\nLate Bronze Age\nDecades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the \"Middle Building\" which apparently served as the residence of the city's local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire. Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.\n\nHebrew Bible narrative\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\n\nPersian and Early Hellenistic periods\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.\nJericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (\"the Province of Judah\") under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it Kypros after his mother.\n\nHasmonean and Herodian periods\nAfter the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.\nThe rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100 BCE and 68 CE.\n\nHerodian period\nHerod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written ʾAlayiq). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.\nThe murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem's aristocracy.\nHerod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archelaïs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.\nFirst-century Jericho is described in Strabo's Geography as follows:\n\nJericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 stadia in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.\n\nIn the New Testament\nThe Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (Matthew 20:29), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (Luke 19:1–10). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke's Gospel, claimed that \"about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple\".\nSmith's Bible Names Dictionary suggests that \"Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.\"\n\nRoman province\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.\n\nByzantine period\nAccounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, Ericha, was built 1600 metres (1 mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.\nThe Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50 BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or \"peace unto Israel\", after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor.\nThe Na'aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in a similar condition.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nJericho, by then named \"Ariha\" in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palestine\"), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).\nBy 659, that district had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its \"miserable Canaanite\" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.\nA palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) and thus known as Hisham's Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This \"desert castle\" or qasr was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen in situ today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.\nUmayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile \"City of the Palms\". Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that \"the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor\". Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 km (6 mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin and the town slowly went into decline.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, \"it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the Ghaur land is made here.\" In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes that there are sulfur mines in Jericho, \"the only ones in Palestine\".\n\nOttoman period\n16th century\nJericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Akçe was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.\nIn 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of Riha, being in the nahiya of Al-Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Akçe. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.\n\n17th century\nThe French traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described the city in 1659 as \"now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.\"\n\n19th century\nIn the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuruş in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858–1943) also reported after his 1899–1900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called Ein al-Sultan, lit. \"Sultan's Spring\", in Arabic and Ein Elisha, lit. \"Elisha Spring\", in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.\nJ. S. Buckingham (1786–1855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or ghazzu: the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in \"robbery and plunder\", their main and most profitable activity.\nAn Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that Riha, Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.\nThe first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.\n\n20th century\nIn Jericho and the Jordan Valley, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem acquired estates that supported agricultural development and served as symbols of its renewed presence in the countryside. The Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.\nIn 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.\nIn the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).\nIn the 1945 statistics, Jericho's population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 \"other\") and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.\nDuring World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.\n\nJordanian period\nJericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed \"His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine\" and called for \"the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity\". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.\nIn 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nJericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza–Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a \"Protocol on Economic Relations\", signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho's Palestinian population's movement through the West Bank.\nThe Jericho synagogue was controlled by Israel after the Six-Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.\nIn response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.\nOn 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa'adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.\nAfter Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.\nIn 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1 million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017.\n\nGeography and environment\nJericho is located 258 m (846 ft) below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of Ein es-Sultan produces 3.8 m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some 10 square kilometres (2,500 acres) through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, 10 kilometres (6 mi) away.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 3,500 ha (8,600-acre) site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.\n\nClimate\nAnnual rainfall is 204 mm (8.0 in), mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in January and 31 °C (88 °F) in July. According to the Köppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (BWh). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.\n\nDemographics\nIn the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted  43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.\nIn a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.\n\nEconomy\nIn 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule. Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.\nThe Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.\n\nTourism\nIn 1998, a $150 million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.\nIn 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.\n\nBiblical and Christian landmarks\nChristian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.\n\nEin es-Sultan, known as the Spring of Elisha to Jews and Christians;\nQasr al-Yahud on the Jordan River, across from Bethany beyond the Jordan, traditionally identified as the location of the baptism of Jesus;\nMount of Temptation (Jebel Quruntul), traditionally identified as the location of the Temptation of Jesus;\nThe Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Temptation halfway up the mountain, beside a cave said to be the location where Jesus fasted for 40 days. It is connected to Jericho by a cable car;\n2 sycamore trees, both identified as the one mentioned in relation to Zacchaeus;\nDeir Hajla, the monastery of St. Gerasimos in the Jordan Valley near Jericho;\nSaint George Monastery in Wadi Qelt above Jericho.\n\nArchaeological landmarks\nStone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at Tell es-Sultan;\nHasmonean and Herodian winter palaces at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq;\nByzantine-period synagogues at Jericho (Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue) and Na'aran;\nUmayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as Hisham's Palace;\nCrusader sugar production facility at Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\");\nNabi Musa, the Mamluk and Ottoman shrine claimed to be the resting place of Moses (\"Prophet Musa\" to the Muslims)\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nIn 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.\n\nHealth care\nIn April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5 million in funding for this project.\n\nSports\nThe sports team Hilal Areeha plays association football in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000-spectator Jericho International Stadium.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nJericho is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nMusa Alami\n\nSee also\nAncient underground quarry, Jordan Valley, some 5 km (3 mi) north of Jericho\nal-Auja, Jericho, a Palestinian village north of Jericho\nBattle of Jericho, biblical story\nCities in the Book of Joshua\nHasmonean royal winter palaces, actually Hasmonean and Herodian, at Tulul Abu al-'Alayiq south of Jericho proper\nHistory of pottery in Palestine\nJawa, Jordan, the oldest proto-urban settlement from Jordan (late 4th millennium BC – Early Bronze Age)\nMevo'ot Yericho, Israeli settlement just north of Jericho\nTower of Jericho, the Neolithic stone tower, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\nWall of Jericho, the Neolithic stone wall, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Jericho\nJericho City (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nJericho City Profile, ARIJ\nJericho aerial photo, ARIJ\nLocality Development Priorities and Needs in Jericho City, ARIJ\nJericho Municipality Official Website Archived 6 February 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 18: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nJericho Municipality Official Website Historical site\nJericho Cable Car\nResources on Biblical Archaeology\nJericho: Tel es-Sultan Archived 13 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nThe walls of Jericho fell in 1550 BCE",
          "summary": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".",

          "content": "## Overview\nJericho (Arabic أريحا Arīḥā, Hebrew יריחו Yerikho), the \"City of Palms\", is a small city within the Palestinian Territories close to the northern end of Dead Sea and some 55 km (34 miles) from Jerusalem.\n\n## Understand\nA relatively tranquil town, Jericho's reputation for calm and lack of security incidents in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has made it a natural destination for West Bank visitors. Because Jericho is a tourist-orientated town, the Palestinian Authority goes to great lengths to make sure Jericho remains safe to visit. There is a constant tourist-police presence in the city and English is spoken by many in the town.\nThe modern town of Jericho includes the ancient mound known as Tell es-Sultan, the accumulated remains of cities that have existed on the site for some 9,000 years – the Neolithic period. Archaeology reveals that Jericho is one of the oldest human settlements in the Middle East.\nJericho, of course, is probably best known for its Biblical associations: (song) \"Joshua fought the battle of Jericho – and the walls came tumbling down!\"\nDue to its location nearly 400 meters below sea level, Jericho is extremely hot in the summer!\n\n## Get in\nFrom Jerusalem, start at the HaNeviim station outside the Old City, next to Damascus Gate. From there, one must take a bus/van to one of three Palestinian cities, and take a second bus/van to Jericho. The three cities are (in order of directness):\n(Al) Ezariya (Junction)  – Bus 36 or 63 (₪6.80) reach this town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the bus driver where to get off for the sherut van (₪10-12 depending on the mood of the driver) to Jericho or take the GPS pointer as orientation. It's advisable that you have an Arabic translator with you or specifically inquire of the bus driver as to where the sherut may be found. Alternatively, take bus 263 (₪6.80) from the Sultan Suleiman station, also close to the Damascus gate, which will stop at the junction too.\nBethlehem – The sherut from the bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station takes around an hour to get to the central square of Jericho (₪20).\nRamallah and Nablus – Authentic and well worth a visit Palestinian cities\nYou can also hitchhike from the south along the Dead Sea or from Tiberias in the north. However, the Egged bus coming from there will apparently not stop before Jerusalem to let passengers off – ask when entering.\nFrom the King Hussein \"Allenby\" Bridge border crossing, there is a direct bus which will deliver you to the 31.86063935.4782221 bus station east of the center, where you will pass through Palestinian border control. From there, it is a 2 km taxi ride or (underwhelming) walk to the city center.\n\n## Get around\nTaxi service in Jericho is easy to find. Make sure to agree on a price with the taxi driver before entering the taxi. Prices for taxi rides inside Jericho shouldn't be more than ₪10. For taxi rides to sites on the outskirts of Jericho, it's best to negotiate a fair price.\n\n## See\n31.8693735.443821 Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho). This site is the center of archaeological digs in Jericho. It was the location of the ancient Jericho of the Biblical times and is located some 2 km north-west of the modern city centre, overlooking the natural spring of Ein Sultan. If you prefer to focus on other things, then it is relatively easy to see the gist of the site from the surrounding roads. The site's car park features not one but two separate fountains both claiming to be Elisha's spring. A  UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2023. ₪10 (intl. students ₪7).\n31.8762335.453932 Shalom al Yisrael Synagogue Mosaic Floor (in between Tel es-Sultan and Hisham's Palace, there is a synagogue floor from the 6th century CE. Look for the bent, orange sign that says Synagogue or בית כנסת, look straight across the street and there is a road going diagonally towards some Palestinian flags). As of Jan 2020, the site is closed and visit is not possible. The synagogue floor is in the basement of a private house belonging to a Jerusalemite family, the Shahwans, at the end of the street. The family discovered the site and kept maintaining it until the Israelis confiscated the land and the house in 1987.\n31.88188335.4599693 Hisham's Palace (2 km north of modern Jericho). 08:00-17:00. This winter palace was built by the Umayyad Caliph Hisham Ibn Abdul Malek, before being destroyed by an earthquake soon after completion in 747 CE. The extensive site contains royal buildings, a mosque, water fountains and spectacular mosaic floors. The mosaics are closed for restoration works until mid-late 2020. ₪10, students ₪7.\n31.8588535.4574884 Russian museum and Sycamore Tree (Tree of Zacchaeus). Based on archaeological excavations of Byzantine buildings, artifacts of Roman/Byzantine/Islamic periods, ancient mosaics, and there is the Zacchaeus tree in the beautiful park. This tree is referenced in the New Testament due to its association with Jesus' visit to Jericho: \"Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.\" (Luke 19:1-4, NET Bible). ₪5, just for the garden & tree (the museum is ₪20), group (10 persons) ₪100.\n31.87443735.4305325 Quruntal (Mountain of Temptation). A Greek Orthodox monastery atop the mountain where Jesus is believed to have been tempted by the Devil. It houses two Greek Orthodox priests. One arrived from Greece in November 2010 when he was 30, and will stay there for the rest of his life. The other has been there for decades. From this precarious rocky spot, you get a great view of Jericho and the Jordan Valley towards Amman. Hike up to the top of the mountain, or else take the world's longest cable car below sea level from the base of the mountain (see Do below).\n31.83709335.5464976 Jesus' Baptismal site (Qasr al Yahoud). Located near Jericho on the Jordan River is the site where Jesus is said to have been baptised by John the Baptist in the Jordan River (this site in Jericho is rivalled by another in Northern Israel at Yardenit). It is also believed to be the spot described in the Old Testament where the Israelites crossed the river to enter the Land of Canaan.\n31.8535335.437057 Wadi Qelt Synagogue. This synagogue is thought to be the oldest synagogue in the world. It is part of the \"Jericho Royal Winter Palace\" complex that was constructed in the Second Temple Period.\n31.8518835.436238 Herod's Palace (ruins) (Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq) (take the road west from the roundabout next to the mosque at the entrance to the center). Not very impressive, but interesting if you are in to the topic. Conveniently located on the way in or out Wadi Qelt.\n31.89352835.424749 Naaran Synagogue (6-7 km northwest of the center). This beautiful ancient synagogue also contains a floor decorated with mosaics.\n31.82042635.50092910 Monastery of Gerasimus of the Jordan (Deir Hajla) (Southeast of Jericho, along road #90), ☏ +970 2 9943038, +970 50 348892. Daily 08:00-18:00. The Greek Orthodox monastery of Deir Hajla near Jericho commemorates St. Gerasimus, whose lavra was nearby. Gerasimus left his family wealth and worldly affairs to become a monk. He departed for the region Thebaid in the Egyptian desert, later again returning to his native Lycia. About the middle of 5th century Saint Gerasimus went to Palestine and settled in wilderness near the Jordan River. There he established a monastery and became known for his righteous life of asceticism and prayer. The story of Gerasimus and the lion, when the saint tamed the animal by removing a thorn from its paw and taught it obedience, became widely known in the Christian world. He is reputed to have attended to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.The history of the monastery is also linked to another Christian narrative. Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus were said to have found refuge in a cave here during their flight from Herod. An underground chapel was built on the spot where the Holy Family is believed to have spent the night. The crypt floor also contains the bones of monks who were massacred during the Persian conquest of the Holy Land.\n31.84319435.41472211 Monastery of Saint George of Choziba (دير القديس جورج). A cliff-hanging monastery complex, dating back to 420 AD. It houses the relics of Saint George of Choziba (circa 450–530 AD) and features an ancient chapel and irrigated gardens.   (updated Aug 2023)\n31.85611135.45722212 The Good Shepherd Church. Catholic church.  (updated Sep 2023)\n\n## Do\nParticipate with visiting archaeologists in the many archaeological digs taking place in the Jericho area.\nAlso, Jericho is known to the local population as an area surrounded by beautiful surroundings. There are numerous hiking trails that have beautiful views of the oases surrounding Jericho. Make sure to bring lots of water, Jericho is also known to the locals for its hot weather.\nGo for a camel ride in the desert. Ask the Bedouins walking around with decorated camels. So much fun! Make sure to agree on a price before hand.\n31.86930335.4446091 Cable Car (Right next to Tell es-Sultan).

          "content": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.\n\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nFlavia Neapolis ('new city of the emperor Flavius') was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called Mabartha ('the passage') or Mamorpha. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city's founding include Joseph's Tomb and Jacob's Well. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.\nInsofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.\n\nIn 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.\nSi'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres (360 ha) in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.\n\nConflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.\nAs tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.\nThus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nNeapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city's name was retained in its Arabicized form, Nabulus. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.\nUnder Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed \"Little Damascus.\" At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.\n\nCrusader period\nThe city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nCrusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a \"celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.\" He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.\n\nIn October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.\nThe successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.\nThe Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon, and later converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque in 1244. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.\nThe Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city \"full of trees and streams and full of olives.\" He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.\n\nOttoman era\nNablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaks ('districts'): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaks were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ('subdistricts'), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.\nAfter decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.\nThe most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama's rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of mutasallim ('tax collector, strongman') of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.\n\nEgyptian rule and Ottoman revival\nIn 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma'in nahiya—rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.\nEgyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaks under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no \"foreigners\" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct \"supervision\" of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.\n\nWorld War I and British Mandate\nBetween 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.\nThe 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous \"picturesque\" character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 partition plan for Palestine.\n\nJordanian occupation\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian occupation. Thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps are still located within the city limits today: Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian occupation, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950.\n\nIsraeli period\nThe Six-Day War ended with the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.\nBassam Shakaa was elected mayor in 1976, and four years later he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground on 2 June 1980, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. The Israeli administration removed him from office in the spring of 1982, and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.\nIn response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city on 29 July 1985 that was lifted 2 hours a day. Najah University was closed for two months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.\nThe Israeli administration ended in January 1986 with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce, al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans, he was assassinated on 2 March 1986, widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nSalah el Bah'sh was shot with a rubber bullet by an Israeli soldier on 18 June 1989 whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B'Tselem that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting \"Ta'amod\" (Halt!). Bah'sh died and the army indicated that an investigation was being carried out.\n\nPalestinian control\nJurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nablus is neighbored by Israeli settlements, and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.\nThe city was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said in 2008 that the city remains \"capital of terror\" of the West Bank.\nFrom the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (mountain of fire) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more Palestinian suicide attacks than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of \"knowhow\" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.\nThe operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.\nThe Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes in August 2016 between a militant group and Palestinian police. Two Palestinian Police officers were killed by terrorists in the city on 18 August. Shortly after, the police raid on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militants were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.\n\nGeography\nNablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at 940 meters (3,080 ft), while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is 881 meters (2,890 ft) high.\nNablus is located 42 kilometers (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv, Israel, 110 kilometers (68 mi) west of Amman, Jordan and 63 kilometers (39 mi) north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.\n\nOld City\nIn the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.\nThere are six hamaams (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.\n\nClimate\nThe relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being 29.6 °C (85.3 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 6.2 °C (43.2 °F). Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately 656 mm (25.8 in).\n\nDemographics\nIn 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 'the chief part of whom are Mohammedans', with some Jews and Christians and 'about 150 Samaritans'. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).\nThe 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 \"other\").\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents. Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate's inhabitants.\nApproximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).\n\nReligion\nIn 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.  However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.\nThe majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.\nIn 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.\nThere are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.\n\nEconomy\nBeginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of \nthe caravan (amir al-hajj), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.\n\nIn 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside  the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the  slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and mulukhiyya were grown in the fields and grain mills were  scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kg (496,040 lb) of the product by 1837.\nToday, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries\n such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.\n Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.\nThe Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus\nproduced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda  imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel.  In 2003, there were eight restaurants  and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The  soap industry has suffered  from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. \n\nThe Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.\nBefore 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.\nSince the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.\nNablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.\nNablus has been ranked as the 5th best city in the Middle East to learn Arabic. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.\n\nHealthcare\nThere are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National), and the Rafidia Surgical Hospital, which is located in the western neighborhood of Rafidiya, and is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. The Nablus Speciality Hospital was built in 2001, which is specializes in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasty.\n\nCulture and arts\nNablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. Nabulsi, meaning \"from Nablus\", is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.\n\nTraditional costume\nNablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk (\"market\"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob (\"robe\"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh (\"square chest piece\").\n\nCuisine\nNablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of \"high cuisine\", such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nKanafeh (or Kunafa) is the best known Nabulsi sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, kanafeh Nabulsi uses a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.\nOther sweets made in Nablus include baklawa, \"Tamriya\", mabrumeh and ghuraybeh, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an \"S\"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.\n\nCultural centers\nThere are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, dabke classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.\n\nSoap production\nNabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.\nMade in a cube-like shape about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of \"the page of an old book.\" The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap's sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw. Today, qilw is still used in combination with lime.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Nablus is the muhfaza (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.\nThe two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.\nYaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.\n\nMayors\nModern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.\nThe current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa \"Dweikat\", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.\n\nMunicipal services\nIn 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.\nThe majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.\n\nFire department\nNablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the \"fire brigade\" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.\n\nTransportation\nIn the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.\nThe main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.\nThe nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.\n\nSports\nThe Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city's football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nNablus is twinned, or has sister city relationships with:\n\nSee also\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority\nList of people from Nablus\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWelcome To The City of Nablus\nNablus City, Welcome to Palestine\nA site explaining the reasons for the devastated Palestinian economy\nNablus the Culture, reviving cultural life in Nablus Archived 15 April 2022 at the Wayback Machine\nNablus after Five Years of Conflict December 2005 report by OCHA (PDF).\nArchaeological Remains Found in Nablus\nPicture showing Nablus from east (Panorama)\nPicture showing east region of Nablus (Panorama) – The picture taken from Askar\nBahjat Sabri, \"Urban Aspects in the City of Nablus in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\" An-Najah University Journal for Research - Humanities, Volume 6 (1992)",
          "summary": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.",

          "content": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nإذا كانت فلسطين قلب الوطن العربي لربطها شماله بجنوبه وشرقه بغربه، فإن نابلس هي قلب فلسطين لربطها شمالها بجنوبها وشرقها بغربها. كانت المدينة مركزاً للواء نابلس في الضفة الغربية بعد عام 1948م وتحولت في منتصف الستينات مركزاً لمحافظة نابلس، تتمتع بموقع جغرافي هام فهي تتوسط إقليم المرتفعات الجبلية الفلسطينية وجبال نابلس، وتعد حلقة في سلسلة المدن الجبلية من الشمال إلى الجنوب وتقع على مفترق الطرق الرئيسية التي تمتد من الناصرة وجنين شمالاً حتى الخليل جنوباً ومن يافا غرباً حتى جسر دامية شرقًا. تبعد عن القدس 69 كم وعن عمان 114 كم وعن البحر المتوسط 42 كم، تربطها بمدنها وقراها شبكة جيدة من الطرق تصلها بطولكرم وقلقيلية ويافا غرباً وبعمان شرقاً وبجنين والناصرة شمالاً وبالقدس جنوباً. في عام 1915 ربطت نابلس مع خط سكة حديد الحجاز الممتد من دمشق إلى المدينة المنورة.\nأقيمت نابلس في أجمل بقعة جغرافية في وسط فلسطين. وصفها شيخ الربوة الدمشقي بأنها «قصر في بستان». قال عنها عمر السكندري في كتابه «تاريخ سوريا» المطبوع في بيروت عام 1882:\n\nيرتفع وسط مدينة نابلس 550 مترا فوق سطح البحر بينما يبلغ ارتفاع أطرافها حتى 800 متر ف.س.ب. تقدر مساحة المدينة العمرانية بحوالي 12700 دونم. يمتد عمران المدينة فوق جبل عيبال شمالاً وجبل جرزيم جنوباً وبينهما وادٍ يمتد نحو الغرب. ولخصوصية الموقع الجغرافي لمدينة نابلس المتمثلة بانحصارها بين جبلين تتواجد في المدينة العشرات من عيون المياه التي تزيد من جمال وبهاء المدينة ومنها عين العسل، عين الست، عين الكاس، عين حسين، عين القريون، عين ميرة، عين الخضر، عين الصلاحي، عين السكر، عين الصبيان، عين الساطور، عين العجيبة، عين بدران، عين التوباني، عين بير الدولاب، عين التوتة بالإضافة إلى سبل المياه مثل سبيل الغزاوي وسبيل الخضر وسبيل السلقية وسبيل الساطور.\n\nتضم مدينة نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية، كبرى الجامعات الفلسطينية وأقدمها وأرفعها مستوى. أسست بلدية المدينة عام 1869 وهي تشرف على تنظيم المدينة وعلى المرافق العامة.\nتذكر كتب التاريخ وصف بعض الرحالة العرب لنابلس بدمشق الصغرى للتشابه مع دمشق بمعالمها ومناخها ومياهها وينابيعها وجبالها وفاكهتها وخضارها وحتى في لهجتها وكثير من عاداتها وتقاليدها. وهي أكثر مدن فلسطين شبهاً وارتباطاً بدمشق وسورية منذ فجر التاريخ، حيث كان تجارها يصدرون الصابون والمنتجات المحلية الأخرى إلى دمشق ويعودون بالأقمشة والتوابل. إضافة إلى ذلك، يعود أصل العديد من عائلات نابلس إلى مناطق في سورية حالياً، مثل عائلة النمر التي قدمت من منطقة حمص وحماة وعائلة طوقان التي قدمت من منطقة حماة.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في نابلس مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت). يتساقط المطر بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش).\n\nقرى وبلدات نابلس\nيحيط بنابلس عدد كبير من القرى ولكنها معزولة عنها بالحواجز العسكرية الإسرائيلية، ففي الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية تم خنق المدينة بعدة حواجز عسكرية مثل حاجز حوارة من المدخل الجنوبي، وحاجز بيت إيبا من المدخل الغربي، وحاجز (17) من المدخل الشمالي وحاجز الباذان من المدخل الشرقي، وبعد انتهاء الانتفاضة الثانية أزيلت هذه الحواجز، ثم أُنشئت حواجز جديدة بعد عملية طوفان الأقصى عام 2023 مثل حاجزي حوارة وعورتا على طريق رام الله نابلس جنوباً، وحاجز المربعة قرب قرية تل من الجهة الجنوبية الغربية، وحاجز صرة على طريق قلقيلية نابلس غرباً، وحاجز الطور جنوباً، وحاجز دير شرف من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق طولكرم نابلس، وحاجز مستوطنة شافي شمرون من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق جنين نابلس، إضافة إلى بعض الحواجز العسكرية المتنقلة غير الدائمة مثل حاجزي الباذان وبيت فوريك شرقاً، وحاجز (17) شمالاً.\nمن قراها:

سكان المدينة في عام 1596 يتألفون من 806 أسر مسلمة و18 أسرة مسيحية و15 أسرة يهودية و20 أسرة سامرية، والأخيرة طائفة دينية يسمى أفرادها بالسمرة أو السامريين. عاش السامريون قبل حرب 1967 في نابلس كمواطنين أردنيين يتمتعون بكافة حريات المواطنة كحال مسلمي ومسيحيي المدينة.\n\nخلال أوائل القرن التاسع عشر، قدر قسطنطين بازيلي سكان ناحية نابلس بستة وعشرين ألف عائلة منها ما يقارب 1000 عائلةٍ مسيحية. وتفيد السجلات العثمانية أن عدد سكان نابلس بلغ 2000 نسمة عام 1849، وفي عام 1867 قال زوّار أمريكيون، أن البلدة بلغ عدد سكانها 4,000 نسمة «أكثرهم محمديون»، وبعض اليهود والمسيحيين، وحوالي 150 سامريّا. قدر عمر السكندري عام 1882 عدد سكانها بثمانية آلاف معظمهم مسلمون. وفي عام 1922 أظهر الإحصاء الرسمي البريطاني لسكان فلسطين، أن عدد سكان المدينة بلغ 15,947 نسمة، ثم ارتفع إلى 17,498 عند إحصاء عام 1931، و21900 نسمة عام 1941 ووصل عام 1945 إلى حوالي 23300 نسمة. وبعد الاحتلال الصهيوني عام 1967 بلغ قرابة 61,050 نسمة، وعاد ليرتفع إلى 106,900 عام 1987.\nبلغ عدد سكان نابلس 134,116 نسمة، في منتصف عام 2006، وفقًا للجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. وفي إحصاء الجهاز لعام 1997، ظهر أن عدد سكان المدينة وصل إلى 100,034 نسمة، بما فيهم 23,397 لاجئ يشكلون 24% من سكان المدينة. وصل عدد سكان مدينة نابلس القديمة إلى 12,000 نسمة عام 2006. تشكل المدينة المسكن لحوالي 40% من سكان المحافظة. توجد في المدينة أربعة مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين هي عين بيت الماء وبلاطة وعسكر القديم وعسكر الجديد، يسكنها ما يفوق مجموعه ال40,000 نسمة.\nيشكل الشباب قسمًا كبيرًا من سكان نابلس، فقرابة نصف السكان يبلغون أعمارًا أقل من 20 سنة. بلغت نسبة السكان الذين تقل أعمارهم عن 10 سنوات، عام 1997، 28.4%، و20.8% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 10 و19 سنة، 17.7% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 20 و29 عام، 18% بين 30 و44 سنة، 11.1% بين 45 و64 سنة، و3.7% للذين تصل أعمارهم لأكثر من 65 عام. أما التوزيع بين الجنسين فكانت نسبته 50.92% (50,945 فردا) للذكور، و49.07% (49,089 فردا للإناث).\n\nالديانة\nكانت نابلس في عام 891 الميلادي، أي خلال العهود الأولى للحكم العربي، تحوي تنوعا دينيا كبيرا، وكان أكثرية سكانها يدينون بالإسلام، المسيحية، والسامرية. يقول الجغرافي شمس الدين الأنصاري الدمشقي، أن المدينة كانت خلال العهد المملوكي، مأهولة بالمسلمين، السامريين، المسيحيين الأرثوذكس، المسيحيين الكاثوليك، واليهود. أظهر إحصاء عام 1931 أن المدينة حوت 16,483 مسلمًا، 533 مسيحيًّا، 6 يهود، و167 شخص يدينون بأديان أخرى، على الأرجح أن معظمهم سامريّون.\nإن معظم سكان نابلس اليوم يدينون بالإسلام، ولا يزال هناك أيضًا بعض المسيحيين والسامريين. يُعتقد أن كثيرًا من الفلسطينيين المسلمين في المدينة يتحدرون من سامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام عند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام، والبعض من أسماء العائلات المسلمة اليوم يتم ربطها بالسامريين ويُقال أن أجدادهم كانوا من أتباع ذلك الدين - مثل آل مسلماني وآل يعيش وغيرهم. يقول المؤرخ فياض الطيف، أن أعدادًا كبيرة من السامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام بسبب الاضطهاد الذي كانوا يتعرضون له، وبسبب الطبيعة التوحيدية للدين الجديد، الأمر الذي جعلهم يتقبلونه بصورة أسهل وأسرع.\nكان يسكن في المدينة حوالي 3,500 مسيحي عام 1967، ولكن أعدادهم انخفضت إلى 650 عام 2008. يتألف المسيحيين في نابلس حاليّا، من 70 أسرة روم أرثوذكس، حوالي 30 أسرة من الروم الملكيين الكاثوليك، و30 أسرة أنجليكانية. كان معظم المسيحيين يسكنون في ضاحية رفيديا بالقسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nتاريخ نابلس\nالتاريخ القديم\nنابلس أو شكيم بالكنعانية، مدينة من أقدم مدن العالم يعود تاريخها إلى 5600 سنة (حوالي سنة 3600 ق.م). أسست عند ملتقى أقدام جبلي جرزيم في القسم الشرقي لمدينة نابلس الحالية على يد العرب الكنعانيين فوق تل كبير يدعى الآن تل بلاطة، وقد أسماها الكنعانيون في ذلك الوقت \"شكيم\" والتي تعني المكان المرتفع، ومن ثم أصبحت من أشهر المدن الكنعانية. أقدم من سكن \"شكيم\" من العرب هم الحويون و‌الفرزيون. صارعت نابلس الكثير من الغزاة والمحتلين عبر تاريخها الطويل، بحيث غزاها كل من الفراعنة المصريين والقبائل العبرية والآشوريين والابليين والفارسيين واليونانيين والسلوقيين، إلى أن سقطت بيد الرومان سنة 63 قبل الميلاد.\nورد ذكر شكيم في نصوص إيبلا التي اكتشفها عالم الآثار الإيطالي باولو ماتييه ضمن مدن كنعانية أخرى في فلسطين، وهي إضافة إلى شكيم بيت جبرين وأريحا وأورسالم (يبوس) ومجيدو وبيسان. ورد ذكرها أيضاً في رسائل تل العمارنة (1400 ق.م) باسم شاكمي، كما ذكرت في تقارير تحتمس الثالث أيضاً.\n\nتشير النصوص المصرية القديمة بأن شكيم كانت مدينةً محصنةً إستراتيجية ذات أهمية دولية منذ سنة 1800 ق.م، كما كانت مركزاً للديانات الكنعانية والحياة السياسية، ويُفهم من النصوص المصرية القديمة أن علاقة فلسطين أصبحت وطيدة بمصر ابتداءً من بداية هذا العصر. وتتحدث رسائل تل العمارنة (سنة 1400-1350 ق.م) عن مدينة شكيم، تحت حكم أميرها الكنعاني لابعايو كمدينة تلعب دوراً هاماً في النضال ضد السيطرة المصرية على منطقة فلسطين. وحسب ما ورد في التوراة فإنها أول مدينة كنعانية نزل فيها النبي إبراهيم الخليل قادماً من مدينة أور في العراق، وكان ذلك حوالي عام 1805 ق.م  وبعده أتى النبي يعقوب من فدان آرام على نهر الفرات في العراق، ونزل شكيم، ثم سكن مدينة كنعانية تعرف باسم بيت إيل وتعني مقر الإله، وكانت مركز عبادة الإله الكنعاني إل أو إيل. ويذكر أن يعقوب عاد فيما بعد إلى شكيم.\nوفي العصر الحديدي (1200-323 قبل الميلاد) استمرت المدن الكنعانية بنفس نظام المدن المحصنة ذات القلاع خلال فترات العصر البرونزي. وتشير التوراة إلى وجود حروب بين اليهود والكنعانيين الفلسطينيين. وقد سيطر اليهود على مدينتين كنعانيتين:\n\nالأولى: مدينة يبوس (أورشاليم)، مدينة اليبوسيين الكنعانيين وقلب مملكتهم منذ عصور ما قبل التاريخ، احتلها اليهود سنة 1000 ق.م بقيادة النبي داود (100-963 ق.م)، ثم سليمان سنة 963 ق.م –923 ق.م. واستمر اليهود فيها تحت اسم مملكة يهودا حتى سقطت سنة 586 ق.م على يد نبوخذ نصر.\nالثانية: مدينة شكيم، التي بدأ نفوذهم فيها عام 923 ق.م وانتهى عام 722 ق.م على يد سرجون الثاني، وبقى فيها أهلها الكنعانيون، وتشير بعض المراجع إلى إحضار كنعانيين من الدواخل، وهم العموريون.\n\nسكنت مدينة شكيم فئة من بني إسرائيل لا تعترف من التوراة بغير الأسفار الخمسة الأولى المنسوبة إلى النبي موسى، وتعرف هذه الفئة بالسامريين نسبة إلى السامرة. وقد ناصبهم اليهود العداء منذ ظهورهم. ويعتقد السامريون بأن النبي إبراهيم همّ بالتضحية بإبنه إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. لا يزال معظم السامريين موجودين في مدينة نابلس حتى هذا اليوم ولا يتجاوز عددهم 250 نسمة، وقد خصص لهم مقعد في المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني المنتخب لأول مرة في التاريخ الفلسطيني المعاصر عام 1996.\nسقطت فلسطين سنة 332 ق.م في يد الإسكندر المقدوني وأصبحت تابعة للإمبراطورية اليونانية حتى سنة 64 ق.م، وبعد وفاة الإسكندر خضعت للبطالمة والسـلوقيين. وقد تركت الهيلينية بصماتها واضحة على بعض مظاهر الحياة أيام الحكم اليوناني وذلك بسبب إنشاء سبعين مدينة ضخمة على الطراز الإغريقي في البلاد التي احتلها الجيش اليوناني. وقد اُستخدِمت مراكزَ ثقافية نُشِرت بها الثقافة اليونانية في بلدان العالم القديم. ومن المدن الثقافية التي أنشئت في العهد اليوناني بيلاوريون (تل الأشعري)، هيبوس (قلعة الحصن)، وهما تقعان شرق طبريا، ومدينة (فيلوتير) في الطرف الجنوبي من بحيرة طبريا، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى فيلوتير شقيقة بطليموس الثاني فيلادلفوس، ومدينة جيراز (جرش). حول الإغريق الكثير من أسماء المدن الكنعانية الفلسطينية إلى أسماء إغريقية منها عكا، حيث سميت بتولما في عهد بطليموس الثاني، وبيت شان (بيسان) سميت سكيثوبوليس، وبيت جبرين أطلق عليها اليوثيروبوليس، وإيلات سميت بيرينكة، وشكيم سميت نيابوليس. أصبحت المدينة تشتمل على رقعة واسعة من الأراضي تحيط بها الأسوار، وبها بوابات ضخمة ذات جلال، وفي داخل الأسوار يقع القصر الملكي أو قصر الحاكم، وكذلك الساحة العامة والمدرج الضخم والمسرح وبرك السباحة والمعابد الضخمة المتعددة.\nوفي العصر الروماني (64 ق.م – 323 م) أقيم سور حول مدينة شكيم (السامرة) طوله حوالي 170 أكد. أما بوابة المدينة فقد بنيت في الجهة الغربية من المدينة وتضم برجين دائريين عظيمين بقطر 46 قدماً (14 متراً)، وهي مقامة على قواعد مربعة الشكل تعود للعصر الهيليني. ومبنى الباسيليكا في السامرة يعود تاريخه إلى العصر الروماني.\n\nوفي الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 67 و69 للميلاد، قرر الرومان، تحت قيادة الإمبراطور فسبازيان، هدمها للمرة الأخيرة وبناء مدينة جديدة إلى الغرب منها أسموها «نيابوليس» أي المدينة الجديدة والتي حرفت عنها لفظة نابلس الحالية، وقد أقاموها وفق التخطيط الروماني في بناء المدن من حيث وجود شارعين متقاطعين ينتج عنهما أربع حارات، حيث ما زالت بعض هذه الحارات الرومانية قائمة بتسميتها الرومانية إلى اليوم مثل حارة القيسارية. وفي عهد هادريان (117-138) أقام الرومان معبداً لجوبيتر على جبل جرزيم مكان معبد السامريين.\nوفي العصر البيزنطي (323 - 638) انتصرت المسيحية فأصبحت كل فلسطين وبضمنها نابلس تدين بالمسيحية وأصبحت نابلس مركزاً لأسقفية. وفي القرن الخامس الميلادي بنى الرومان المسيحيون على قمة جبل جرزيم كنيسة تخليداً لمريم العذراء. وفي عهد الإمبراطور جستنيان (527-565) شيدت بالقرب من كنيسة مريم قلعة مسورة لا تزال آثارها باقية، كما أعاد الرومان بناء خمس كنائس تهدمت في حروب سابقة.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nفي عام 638م فتح العرب المسلمون نابلس بقيادة عمرو بن العاص في خلافة عمر بن الخطاب، وقد تعهد المسلمون بحماية من بقي من أهلها على دينه من المسيحيين على أن يدفعوا الجزية عن رقابهم والخراج عن أراضيهم. أصبحت نابلس بعد الفتح الإسلامي مدينة من مدن جند فلسطين الذي كانت قصبته اللد ثم الرملة.\nاستولى عليها الصليبيون في سنة 1099م بقيادة تانكرد صاحب أنطاكية، وبنى بالدوين الأول (1100-1118م) ملك بيت المقدس الفرنجي فيها قلعة على رأس جبل جرزيم لحماية قواته ومراقبة تحركات المسلمين. وعقد فيها خلال الاحتلال الصليبي مجمع كنسي كبير في سنة 1120م تحت رعاية بالدوين الثاني (1118-1130م). غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى (باللاتينية: Naples).\nعادت نابلس بقراها وجبالها إلى المسلمين سنة 1187م بعد انتصار صلاح الدين الأيوبي في معركة حطين. أزال صلاح الدين ما أحدثه الصليبيون من تغييرات فيها أثناء الاحتلال. بدأت المدينة في العودة إلى ازدهارها خاصة في زمن المماليك الذين خلفوا الأيوبيين.\nضرب نابلس زلزال كبير سنة 1189 م، فتهدمت فيها مبان كثيرة، ومات تحت الأنقاض ثلاثون ألفاً من أهلها.\nكانت نابلس مركز تجمع جيش المسلمين بقيادة الملك الكامل خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة على الشام التي انطلقت في عام 1228م بقيادة فردريك الثاني إمبراطور ألمانيا وإيطاليا.\nسقطت نابلس بيد التتار سنة 1260م، ولكنهم خرجوا في نفس السنة على يد قطز المملوكي.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nفي سنة 1517 م سيطر العثمانيون على بلاد الشام وبضمنها نابلس، وأصبحت نابلس سنجقاً تابعاً لولاية دمشق، ووصلت المدينة أوج ازدهارها في عهدهم.\n\nكانت نابلس خلال القرنين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر أهم مدينة تجارية في فلسطين، متفوقة على القدس وعلى المدن الساحلية، ومن المحتمل أنها كانت الأكبر سكانيا في فلسطين في هذا الوقت. حوالي عام 1849، وصل عدد سكانها إلى عشرين ألفًا على الأقل، ما جعلها الأكبر سكانيًا في فلسطين. كانت أيضاً أكبر مركز لإنتاج القطن في الشام بكمية بلغت 225,000 كغم عام 1837. كانت المدينة مركزا لتجارة الأقمشة وكانت تصدر الصابون وزيت الزيتون والقطن إلى دمشق وبيروت ومصر وأوروبا.</\"ref name=\"BD> نتيجة لدورها التجاري المهم، تعرضت نابلس بدءاً من عام 1773 إلى حصار عسكري واقتصادي تبعه احتلال قام به ظاهر العمر وخلفه أحمد باشا الجزار لإضعاف دورها وتقوية دور عكا، ودام هذا الاحتلال حتى عام 1804. بعد دمار عكا الذي نتج عن هجوم إبراهيم باشا عام 1931-1932، عادة أهمية للازدياد مجددا. في سنة 1832 دخلت نابلس تحت الحكم المصري بقيادة القائد إبراهيم باشا، وفي عام 1834 ثار أهل نابلس على الحكم المصري بسبب الضرائب والتجنيد الإجباري ولكنهم أخفقوا. دام هذا الحكم حتى سنة 1840 حيث عادت فلسطين إلى الحكم العثماني. وفي نهاية الحكم العثماني أصبحت مدينة نابلس مركز سنجق تابع لولاية بيروت يمتد من نهر الأردن إلى البحر المتوسط ويضم مئة قرية. ضرب زلزال كبير ثان نابلس في عام 1837 وأدى إلى تدمير حي كامل وإحداث أضرار كبيرة بحي آخر.\nمع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، بدأ دور نابلس بالتراجع مع زيادة أهمية مدن أخرى مثل القدس التي اجتذبت مهاجرين يهود وحجاج مسيحيين، ويافا التي بدأت بالازدهار نتيجة زيادة تجارتها عبر الميناء.</\"ref name=\"BD> استمر التراجع في القرنين اللاحقين بفعل الاحتلال الأجنبي وانتقال مراكز الإدارة والتجارة إلى مدن أخرى. سقطت نابلس بيد البريطانيين في يوم 21 أيلول 1918 بعد معركة شهدت مقاومة شديدة من الجنود العثمانيين. أخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني عام 1922 وأصبحت نابلس مجدداً مركزاً للمقاومة. فجر البريطانيون أجزاءً كبيرةً من حارة القريون خلال ثورة 1936-1939 لقمع المقاومة.\n\nضرب زلزال قوي نابلس يوم 11 تموز من عام 1927  وأدى إلى تدمير 300 بيت ومبنى في مدينتها القديمة وبضمنها جامع النصر التاريخي  ويمكن رؤية آثاره على كثير من المباني حتى اليوم. أظهر تعداد عام 1941 أن نابلس جاءت في المرتبة السادسة في تعداد السكان في فلسطين بعد القدس وتل أبيب وحيفا ويافا وغزة على الترتيب، وكانت تضم محكمتين عدليتين على الأقل.\n\nبعد نكبة فلسطين\nبعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948 ضمت الضفة الغربية بمحافظاتها الثلاث، نابلس والقدس والخليل، إلى الأردن وأصبحت في سنة 1950 جزءاً من المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى احتلالها من قبل الإسرائيليين خلال حرب حزيران عام 1967م. منذ سقوطها حتى اليوم، شكلت نابلس إحدى أهم بؤر المقاومة وسقط منها شهداء كثر من أقدمهم وأبرزهم شادية أبو غزالة عام 1968 والفتاة لينا النابلسي عام 1976. بعد إتفاق أوسلو، انسحبت قوات الاحتلال منها في 10 كانون الأول سنة 1995م، قبل أربعة أيام من الموعد المتفق عليه مع السلطة الفلسطينية، وكانت الوحيدة من بين المدن الفلسطينية التي أخليت قبل موعدها.\n\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية، استمر دور المدينة بالتراجع بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي والعمليات العسكرية في مقابل الهدوء النسبي في مناطق أخرى (أهمها رام الله) وتركيز السلطة الفلسطينية على بناء عاصمتها الجديدة في رام الله، فانتقلت كثير من المؤسسات وإدارات المصارف والشركات والمراكز الثقافية ومراكز البحوث إلى رام الله. نتيجة لذلك، ارتفعت نسبة البطالة في نابلس وتراجعت تجارتها. كانت الإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الأردنية العاملة في الضفة الغربية أول من انتقلت من المدينة. بعد ذلك، بدأت المؤسسات الثقافية ودور الأبحاث بالانتقال للاقتراب من مراكز صنع القرار في رام الله. على سبيل المثال، انتقل المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث السياسية والمسحية (وهو من أوائل مراكز البحوث واستطلاع الرأي في فلسطين) من نابلس إلى رام الله (وكان اسمه عند التأسيس مركز البحوث والدراسات الفلسطينية). أيضا، قبل إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله، كانت هناك ثلاثة مراكز ثقافية فرنسية (تتبع للقنصلية الفرنسية في القدس) في الأراضي الفلسطينية (في القدس وغزة ونابلس)، وبعد إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله أقيم فرع رابع هناك تبعه إغلاق فرع المركز في نابلس.\n\nنابلس في أدب الرحلات\nذكر رحالة كثر نابلس في أعمالهم. من هؤلاء المقدسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي الذي وصفها في كتابه «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم» حيث قال: \n\nفي سنة 1325م زارها ابن بطوطة فوصفها بأنها مدينة عظيمة كثيرة الأشجار والماء ومن أكثر بلاد الشام زيتوناً، وبها مسجد جامع متقن وحسن في وسطه بركة ماء عذب.\nفي القرن التاسع الهجري، أفاض مجير الدين الحنبلي العليمي في ذكر نابلس ونواحيها فقال فيما قال: \n\nفي سنة 1671م زارها الرحالة العثماني أولياجلبي، حيث ذكر أنها مركز لواء تابع لولاية دمشق ويضم مائتي قرية. وذكر مساجدها وسوقها ومدارسها وحماماتها قائلاً: \n\n وأغلب الظن أنه قصد وجود الليمون والنخيل في غور نابلس وليس في جبالها.\n\nالاقتصاد والخدمات\nنابلس عاصمة فلسطين الاقتصادية، وتعتبر المركز التجاري والصناعي الرئيس في فلسطين قبل النكبة  وفي الضفة الغربية بعد ذلك. إضافةً إلى ذلك، وهبها موقعها الجغرافي المميز وأمطارها الغزيرة (التي تعتبر الأغزر في فلسطين) أهمية كمركز لإنتاج وتبادل المنتجات الزراعية. كما تشتهر المدينة بصناعة الصابون والمصنوعات اليدوية والأثاث والبلاط وتشتهر بجودة حجارتها ومهارة حجّاريها ومصانع النسيج ودباغة الجلود. كما توجد على تخوم نابلس سوق لتبادل البضائع الحيّة كالمواشي وسوق الخضار المركزية للضفة الغربية. تضم نابلس الإدارات العامة لكبريات الشركات الفلسطينية مثل شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية وشركة فلسطين للتنمية والاستثمار (PADICO)، وفيها مقر بورصة نابلس المعروفة رسمياً بسوق فلسطين للأوراق المالية. كانت نابلس مركزاً للإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية الموجودة في الضفة الغربية قبل أن يتم نقل معظمها إلى رام الله مع تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية هناك. تشتهر نابلس كذلك بعمارة أسواقها، وخاصة في حي القصبة في المدينة القديمة، كما تشتهر بحلوياتها وخاصة «الكنافة» التي تنسب أجودها للمدينة.\n\nالصناعة\nكانت المدينة تشكل ثقلاً اقتصادياً هاماً قبل 1967م وكانت مدن الضفتين تعتمد عليها في بعض الصناعات وبعد الاحتلال ونتيجة لسياسة سلطات الاحتلال الإلحقاية التي تقوم على تدمير الاقتصاد الوطني تعرضت الصناعات الكبيرة فيها إلى التراجع وهبوط مستوى إنتاجها وأهم هذه الصناعات مصانع الجلود والنسيج والكيمياويات والصناعات المعدنية، وفي المدينة غرفة تجارة أسست عام 1943م.\nتشتهر المدينة بالكثير من المنتجات الزراعية والمصنعة أهمها:\n\nالصابون النابلسي: ازدهرت صناعة الصابون في نابلس واشتهر صابونها الذي يصنع من زيت الزيتون حتى أصبحت مصابنها جزءاً من تراث المدينة. كانت صناعة الصابون أحد أعمدة الاقتصاد النابلسي ووصل عدد المصابن إلى أكثر من ثلاثين مصبنة، توقف معظمها عن العمل بفعل إغلاق الأسواق الخارجية وغياب الابتكار والتجديد.\nالحلويات النابلسية: أهم حلوياتها على الإطلاق الكنافة النابلسية الشهيرة في كل أنحاء المشرق العربي وتركيا. دخلت نابلس موسوعة غينيس للأرقام القياسية بأكبر طبق (صدر) كنافة في 18 تموز 2009. تشتهر نابلس أيضاً بالمدلوقة والحلاوة المصنوعة من السمسم والكلاج والقطايف والفطير وحلاوة الزلابية إضافة إلى الحلويات الشامية مثل البقلاوة.\nمن المُنتجات الأخرى التي تمتاز بها نابلس عن غيرها الجبن النابلسي والطحينة والحلاوة والقزحة، والأخيرة عبارة عن مائع أسود اللون يستخلص من حبة البركة، يؤكل غمساً وله استعمالات طبية مهمة.\n\nالزراعة في محافظة نابلس\nتساهم الزراعة بنسبة قليلة من الدخل، ويتركز الإنتاج الزراعي على سفوح الجبال وفي الأغوار وتعتمد على مياه الأمطار والري في الأغوار. فيها العديد من المزارع لتنمية الثروة الحيوانية.\nتعد نابلس مركز زراعة الزيتون في فلسطين، ولهذا ازدهرت فيها صناعة الصابون النابلسي المطبوخ من زيت الزيتون. إضافة إلى الزيتون، تحيط بنابلس بساتين الرمان واللوز والخوخ والمشمش والدراق. تزرع الخضراوات والحمضيات المروية في الغور حيث تقل أخطار الصقيع. كانت منطقة نابلس تشتهر أيضاً بزراعة القطن، إلا أن هذا المحصول اختفى تقريباً الآن من منطقة نابلس، ولكنه لا زال يزرع في السهل الساحلي.\nتشتهر المدينة أيضاً بمنتجات زراعية خاصة مثل الزعتر النابلسي وتعرف بمنتجاتها الجبلية مثل البابونج والميرمية. صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات واسعة من أراضي المحافظة وأقامت عليها 43 مستوطنة مما أدى إلى انحسار مساحة المراعي الطبيعية.\n\nالخدمات الصحية\nفيها مشفيان حكوميان أولهما المستشفى الوطني الذي يٌقدم خدمات في تخصص علم الأورام. بني هذا المستشفى عام 1910 ويقع في وسط المدينة. ثاني المستشفيات الحكومية مستشفى رفيديا الجراحي الذي يقع في غرب المدينة ويُعد أكبر مستشفى في المدينة. يوجد أيضاً مشفيان خاصان غير ربحيين هما المستشفى الإنجيلي العربي وهو الأقدم في المدينة حيث أنشيء عام 1900 ومستشفى جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي.. من المشافي الخاصة الربحية المستشفى العربي التخصصي ومستشفى نابلس التخصصي الذي أسس عام 2001، ويقدم خدمات اختصاصية في جراحة القلب المفتوح وقثطرة شريانية ورأب الوعاء. بعد إنشاء كلية الطب في جامعة النجاح أنشيء مستشفى النجاح الوطني الجامعي وهو أول مستشفى جامعي في فلسطين.\nإضافة إلى ما تقدم، هناك مستوصفات خيرية تقدم خدمات الطوارئ والإسعافات الأولية مثل مستوصف الرحمة ومستوصف التضامن التابع لجمعية التضامن الخيرية ومركز الرازي الطبي ومركز الأمل للتأهيل. هناك أيضاً العديد من العيادات الطبية الحكومية أو التابعة لوكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين أو الأونروا، وخاصة في مخيمات اللاجئين. في عام 2010، بلغ معدل السكان لكل مركز رعاية صحية 5,486 مواطن وهو الرقم الأصغر مُقارنة مع باقي المدن الفلسطينية. ويتمتع المواطن النابلسي بخاصية التأمين الصحي الذي يتم تأمينه من جهة الحكومة (نظام التأمين الصحي الحكومي) والتأمين الصحي الخاص والمنظمات الغير حكومية والأونروا أيضًا ويصل عدد العائلات التي تستفيد من هذا التأمين 19,051 عائلة.\n\nالخدمات البلدية\nفي عام 1997، تم ربط 18,003 منزل بالشبكة العامة للكهرباء أي ما يعادل 99,7% من المدينة. قبل بناء هذه الشبكة عام 1957 كان التزود بالكهرباء يتم عن طريق بعض المولدات الخاصة. بالإضافة أن الشبكة تمد 18 بلدة وقرية بجوار المدينة بالكهرباء عن طريق نفس الشبكة.\nوترتبط 93% من منازل المدينة بنظام الصرف الصحي و7% عن طريق الحُفر الامتصاصية. وأُنشئ نظام الصرف الصحي في أوائل الخمسينات، بالإضافة إلى ارتباط مخيم بلاطة ومخيم عسكر ومخيم عين بيت الماء. وتوفر بلدية نابلس المياه الصحية عن طريق الأنابيب لجميع المنازل في المدينة. وقد قامت السلطات البريطانية بتأسيس شبكة المياه عام 1932، وتتزود بالمياه من الآبار الأربعة المجاورة للمدينة في: دير شرف، الفارعة، وادي الباذان و‌أودلا.\n\nإطفائية البلدية\nتم تأسيس إطفائية بلدية نابلس عام 1958. حيث تألفت أول فرقة إطفاء من خمسة أفراد مع سيارة إطفاء واحدة، حتى عام 1986 كانت مسؤولة عن منطقة شمال الضفة الغربية كاملةً. ولكن اليوم تقتصر خدماتها فقط في نابلس. في عام 2007، بلغ عدد السيارات المُستعملة لإطفاء الحرائق 20 سيارة و70 فرد. خلال الفترة الواقعة ما بين 1997 و2006، قامت بإطفاء 15,346 حريق.\n\nالطرق والمواصلات\nينقسم نظام الطرق والمواصلات في نابلس كما هو الحال في باقي مناطق الضفة الغربية إلى قسمين رئيسيين، واحد لاستخدام المواطنين الفلسطينيين والآخر لاستخدام المستوطنين الإسرائيليين. تصل مساحة الطرق الرئيسية التي تربط مدينة نابلس بالقرى المُحيطة بها إلى 365.8 كم 2، بينما تصل مساحة الطرق الفرعية التي تربطها بالقرى إلى 313.2 كم 2. ومنذ توقيع اتفاقية أوسلو بين السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية والجانب الإسرائيلي في أيلول سبتمبر عام 1995 عملت إسرائيل على إنشاء نظام طرق خاص يربط مستوطنات الضفة الغربية ببعضها البعض، ويضمن مرورا آمنا لمستوطني الضفة الغربية. وقد أدى نظام الطرق هذا إلى تقسيم الأراضي الزراعية في الضفة الغربية وبعثرتها. وقد وصل طول هذه الطرق إلى 39,699 كم مربع حتى نهاية شهر مارس من العام 1996.\nتعد المركبات في نابلس أهم وسائل النقل، بل تكاد تكون الوحيدة التي يعتمد عليها سكان نابلس للتنقل برًا من وإلى المناطق المختلفة داخل الوطن والمدن المجاورة. حيث تبلغ عدد السيارات 20.397 منها 15.507 سيارة خاصة و1.490 سيارة أجرة و121 حافلة عمومية. ويعتبر متوسط سنة إنتاج السيارة منخفضًا في المدينة حيث يبلغ عدد السيارات التي تم تصنيعها (قبل عام 1997) 9.540 سيارة أي ما يقارب نصفها.\n\nالحياة الثقافية والتراث\nتعتبر نابلس من أغنى المدن الفلسطينية ثقافياً وتراثياً. من الألقاب التي عرفت بها نابلس «عش العلماء» ويعود سبب التسمية إلى كون نابلس مركزاً علمياً وأدبياً ونظراً لظهور الكثير من العلماء والأدباء والشعراء منها على مدى كثير من العصور.\n\nشعراؤها وأدباؤها\nبرز منها الكثير من أعلام الفكر والشعر والأدب. من أشهر شعرائها إبراهيم طوقان شاعر فلسطين وشقيقته فدوى طوقان وحلمي الزواتي وعبد اللطيف عقل وليلى علوش وعلي الخليلي ومحمد مهيب جبر ومن أدبائها في القرن العشرين عادل زعيتر وقدري طوقان ومحمد عزة دروزة وثريا ملحس وأكرم زعيتر.\n\nمؤسسات التعليم العالي والمراكز الثقافية\nتحتضن نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية الأكبر في الضفة الغربية والتي تضم عشرين كلية. توجد في المدينة أيضاً كلية الروضة للعلوم المهنية إضافةً إلى مراكز ثقافية مثل المنتدى التنويري الثقافي الفلسطيني والنادي الثقافي الاجتماعي ومركز حواء الثقافي وملتقى بلاطة الثقافي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي وفرع للمجلس الثقافي البريطاني. كان في المدينة ثلاث دور سينما أغلقت خلال الانتفاضات المتعاقبة منذ 1989، وقد افتتحت عام 2009 دار جديدة للسينما، أغلقت أبوابها عام 2019. وتعد مكتبة بلدية نابلس العامة أقدم وأكبر المكتبات في الضفة الغربية حيث أنشئت عام 1960.\nوفقًا ل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني، في عام 1997، بلغ عدد الطلاب 44,926 (41.2٪ في المدارس الابتدائية، 36.2٪ في المدرسة الثانوية، و22.6٪ في المدرسة الثانوية). في عام 2006، بلغ عدد المدارس 234 مدرسة و93,925 طالبًا وطالبة في محافظة نابلس؛ منها 196 تابعة لمديرية التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية و24 مدرسة خاصة و14 مدرسة تابعة ل الأونروا.\n\nالحركة النسوية\nفي عام 1921، تأسست في نابلس جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي التي كانت أول جمعية نسائية غير دينية في فلسطين (سبقتها ثلاث جمعيات أرثوذكسية في عكا ويافا والقدس)، وهي لا تزال نشطة حتى الآن وأسست الكثير من المراكز والنشاطات منها مشفى ومعهد تمريض ومراكز تعليم مهني وناد ثقافي وروضة أطفال.\n\nالمتاحف\nأنشئ في نابلس متحف القصبة في موقع غني بالآثار الرومانية داخل المدينة القديمة. هناك أيضاً متحف سامري أقيم على قمة جبل جرزيم عام 1997 لإلقاء الضوء على ديانة وتراث السامريين.\n\nالإنتاج التلفزيوني ومحطات البث التلفزيوني\nتم في نابلس عام 2005 إنتاج مسلسل تلفزيوني يعالج الكثير من القضايا الاجتماعية وكان اسم المسلسل «براويز» من إنتاج تلفزيون آسيا ـ نابلس، كذلك أنتج مسلسل تلفزيوني اجتماعي آخر عام 2008 حمل عنوان «لهون حلو». فيها سبع محطات تلفزة محلية أهمها وأولها تلفزيون نابلس وخمس محطات إذاعة محلية تبث على موجات إف إم، وهي تؤثر بشكل فاعل بطرح قضايا تخص المدينة وسكانها، من أبرز هذه الإذاعات راديو شباب أف ام، راديو طريق المحبة، إذاعة جامعة النجاح الوطنية وإذاعة القرآن الكريم.\n\nالزي الشعبي\nيشبه الزي النسائي القديم المعروف لمدينة نابلس إلى حد كبير الزي النسائي لمدينة دمشق، والذي يتكون من يشمك وغطوة وكاب أو ملاية. والحال كذلك بالنسبة للزي الرجالي الذي كان يتكون من الشروال والطربوش.\n\nالفن التشكيلي\nأقيمت في مدينة نابلس أضخم جدارية في فلسطين بمساحة 550 متر مربع عند مفترق جامع السلام غرب المدينة. كما أقيم في مدينة نابلس حديثا غالري فني يهتم بالفن التشكيلي بكافة أنواعه وهو غالري تهامة.\n\nالرياضة\nتوجد في المدينة العديد من الأندية الرياضية أهمها نادي حطين ونادي اتحاد نابلس ونادي عيبال وشباب نابلس، إضافة إلى أندية صغيرة مثل نادي أهلي بلاطة ونادي التضامن ونادي جبل النار ونادي إسكان الموظفين. إضافةً إلى ذلك، يوجد مركز للشباب في كل مخيم للاجئين (كبلاطة وعسكر وعين بيت الماء). فيها ملعب بلدي لكرة القدم هو الأقدم في فلسطين حيث أسس عام 1950. جرت توسعته وإعادة تأهيله ليتسع ل4,000 من المتفرجين.\n\nالحديقة النباتية\nأقيمت أول حديقة نباتية تعليمية وبحثية في فلسطين في قرية تل الواقعة في ضواحي نابلس. أشرف على هذا المشروع ونفذه مركز أبحاث التنوع الحيوي والبيئة «بيرك» ويقع مقره في ذات القرية. تحتوي الحديقة على أشجار الحور، عروس الغابة، الخروب، البطم، الجكرندا، الطلح الناعم، السنديان، العبهر، الصنوبر، الكينا، التين، الزيزفون السوري، الورود، بالإضافة إلى حديقة مائية وحديقة صخرية.\n\nأهميتها الدينية\nأخرج ابن أبي شيبة عن كعب الأحبار قال: \n\n هي من أهم المدن قداسة وخاصة عند اليهود والنصارى. يقال أن النبي آدم سجد فيها على جبل جرزيم. هي الموقع الكنعاني الأول الذي ذكرته التوراة وفيه بنى إبراهيم أول هيكل لدى قدومه من حلب. إضافة إلى إبراهيم، سكنها أنبياء أهمهم إسحاق ويعقوب. ويعتقد اليهود أن إبراهيم همّ بذبح إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. مر بها المسيح حيث سقته المرأة السامرية من بئر يعقوب. يوجد فيها أيضاً قبر يوسف وبظاهرها قبور أنبياء آخرين.\nهناك 17 معلما إسلاميّا في المدينة، و11 مسجدًا في المدينة القديمة. تمّ إنشاء 9 مساجد من هذه المذكورة قبل القرن الخامس عشر. تحوي نابلس، بالإضافة لدور العبادة الإسلامية، كنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس مكرسة للقديس جوستين الشهيد، المبنية عام 1898، وكنيسًا للسامريين، لا يزال يُستعمل من قبل تابعي هذه الديانة.\n\nالمساجد\nنابلس مدينة المساجد، فمنذ أن دخلها الإسلام وهي جادة في بناء المساجد التي بنى معظمها الموسرون من أهلها حيث تفيد إحصائية من عام 1997م بأن عدد المساجد في مدينة نابلس وحدها دون قراها بلغ 49 مسجدًا  منها ما هو قديم جداً مثل جامع الخضراء، الذي يمتد عمره إلى بداية العهد الإسلامي،جامع التينة، جامع البيك، الجامع الصلاحي الكبير الذي كان كاتدرائية، جامع الساطون، جامع النصر، المسجد العمري، جامع المساكين، المسجد الحنبلي، جامع الأنبياء، جامع الخضر، مسجد العامود. وهناك عدد كبير من المساجد الحديثة.\nتوجد في نابلس لجنة زكاة تعتبر الأكبر في الضفة الغربية حيث تقوم على إعالة آلاف الأسر والأيتام وطلاب العلم في نابلس وقراها وتشرف على عدة مشاريع استثمارية ضخمة متعددة الأغراض.\n\nالكنائس والأديرة\nتمتاز نابلس بتسامحها الديني، وهذا يفسر كثرة الكنائس وتنوعها وكذلك الأديرة المسيحية فيها. ومن أشهر الكنائس وأقدمها في نابلس كنيسة الأرثوذكس في المدينة القديمة، والكنيسة الأرثوذكسية المُقامة فوق بئر يعقوب. ومن أشهر أديرتها دير فنشر قرب جامع الخضر، ودير اللاتين قرب المقبرة الغربية. وهناك موقع شرقي المدينة يسمى خلة الرهبان.\n\nآثار ومعالم\nلا تزال مجموعة من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية الجميلة الممثلة لمختلف الفترات التاريخية السابقة التي مرت على نابلس قائمة حتى اليوم داخل المدينة، فبالإضافة إلى مدينة شكيم، لا يزال هناك ثلاثة عشر أثراً رومانياً من أبرزها المسرح والمدرج وميدان سباق الخيل، كما أن هناك خمسة وستين أثراً لمعالم التراث الحضاري الإسلامي موزعة على المساجد، المقامات، الزوايا، الخانات، القصور، الأسبلة، المدارس وغير ذلك. ومما يؤسف له أن هذه الآثار قد تعرضت للتدمير والهدم والتخريب الوحشي على يد الإسرائيليين أثناء هجومهم على البلدة القديمة في نابلس عام 2002.\n\nبوابات نابلس\nيروي مؤرخو المدينة أن نابلس كان لها ثماني عشرة بوابة، زال معظمها جراء التوسع العمراني الذي شهدته ابتداءً من القرن التاسع عشر. ومنها: البوابة الشرقية، البوابة الغربية، بوابة الدير، بوابة الشيخ مسلم، بوابة إدريس، بوابة سوق الحدادين، بوابة البيك وسط المدينة القديمة، بوابة الوكالة.\n\nالمعالم من العهدين الكنعاني والروماني\nتظهر الآثار الرومانية على أطراف المدينة القديمة، وبعض المعالم في البلدة القديمة ترجع إلى العهد البيزنطي والصليبي. من الآثار الكنعانية والرومانية المهمة في نابلس:\n\nسبسطية: مدينة أثرية فيها مدارج رومانية وشارع أعمدة. تقع على بعد كيلومترات قليلة شمال غرب نابلس.\nشكيم: مدينة كنعانية قديمة. بعض جدرانها لا تزال قائمةً إلى اليوم في الطرف الشرقي من مدينة نابلس.\nمعبد جوبيتر أو زيوس: ويقع في تل الرأس في جبل جرزيم (الطور). أُسس كمعبد للآلهة زيوس في القرن الثاني للميلاد وقد تم اكتشافه عام 1930.\nمدرج سباق الخيل في ساحة الشهداء (ميدان الحسين سابقاً) وسط مدينة نابلس.\nالمدرج الروماني في رأس العين: ويتسع لأكثر من ألف شخص، وهو أكبر المسارح المكتشفة في فلسطين.\nالشارع الروماني: اكتشفت أجزاء منه تحت مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية.\nمقبرة عسكر البيزنطية.\nالمقبرة الرومانية الغربية: وتقع على أطراف المدينة على الطريق المتجه غربًا نحو الساحل الفلسطيني.\nبئر يعقوب: وهو البئر الذي شرب منه يسوع على يد المرأة السامرية بحسب التقاليد المسيحية، وأقيم فوقه دير أرثوذكسي، ولا يزال عامراً بالمياه الصالحة للشرب.\nقبر يوسف: هو مقام يعتقد أن القبر الموجود فيه يحتوي رفات النبي يوسف بن يعقوب التي حملت من مصر حسب التوراة،  ولذلك استولى عليه اليهود عام 1967 وجعلوه مقاماً مقدساً لديهم ونقطةً عسكرية قبل أن يطردهم سكان نابلس بالقوة عام 2000.\n\nقناة جر المياه الرومانية: أقام الرومان هذه القناة في القرن الثاني الميلادي واكتشفت حديثاً على عمق 30 متراً تحت الأرض تحت أقسام من المدينة القديمة عند بناء مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية. يُعتقد أن هذه القناة تجر مياه الشرب من ينابيع جبل جرزيم ضمن شبكة من الخزانات والآبار،  ولا تزال المياه تتدفق في هذه القناة. تم ترميم جزء منها وفتحه للزوار من قبل بلدية المدينة قبل عدة سنوات.\nأربع كنائس بيزنطية حولت إلى مساجد.\nآثار جبل جرزيم. يوجد على قمة الجبل معبد يوناني وكنيسة بيزنطية مثمنة الأضلاع وقلعة صليبية ومقام إسلامي إضافة إلى خزانات مياه وأساسات أبنية.\nتلة صوفر.\n\nقبور الأنبياء في عورتا. فيها قبر النبي العزير في مغارة وكذلك قبر يوشع بن نون خادم النبي موسى ومفضل ابن عم النبي هارون.\n\nالمعالم من العهد الإسلامي\nتتمثل أهم الآثار الإسلامية في أحياء المدينة القديمة في نابلس، وهي الياسمينة، القريون، الحبلة، القيسارية، العقبة، الغرب، القصبة الذي يمثل شريان المدينة القديمة ومركزها التجاري.\nتحتوي نابلس على 2850 بناءً تاريخيًا من منازل وقصور عائلية، و18 معلماً إسلامياً و17 سبيلاً. يعود تاريخ إنشاء العديد من الأماكن التاريخية المهمة إلى العهد الإسلامي وبالأخص العثماني مثل:\n\nبرج الساعة في باب الساحة\nخان التجار القديم\nخان التجار الجديد\nخان الوكالة الغربية\nالمدرسة الرشادية أو المدرسة الفاطمية\nقصر النمر\nالمنارة\nمستشفى الوطني الحكومي\nالمستشفى الإنجيلي (المبنيان القديمان)\nسجن النساء التركي\nالسجن (القشلة)\nسرايا الحكم التركي\nدار المفتي\nالوكالة الفروخية\nمحطة ضخ مياه القريون\nالبرج الصليبي\nجسر القطار قرب حدائق جمال عبد الناصر ومحطة القطار\nالمدرسة الهاشمية (هدمت)\nالمحكمة الشرعية.\nإضافة إلى ذلك، تضم المدينة العديد من الآثار والمعالم القديمة، منها تسعة مساجد أثرية، أربع منها كانت كنائس بيزنطية بالأصل وحولت إلى مساجد، وخمسة مساجد بنيت في بداية العهد الإسلامي، وضريح يعود إلى الفترة الأيوبية، وكنيسة من القرن السابع عشر وعشرات المصابن.\nيقع مقام رجال العامود على سفح جبل جرزيم الشمالي، ويعود تاريخه إلى عام 1396، ويتكون من سبع غرف متلاصقة يعتقد أنها كانت مسكن عامود النور وعائلته، ويوجد في الغرف الوسطى قبور يعتقد أن أصحاب المقام قد دفنوا فيها لاحقًا، وله فناء داخلي وسور، وفي جزئه الشمالي الغربي مسجد صغير تعلوه قبة حجرية.\n\nالحمامات التركية\nما زالت الحمامات التركية في نابلس شاهدةً على قدم هذه المدينة وعراقتها. كان عدد الحمامات التركية في نابلس أكبر من أية مدينة أخرى في فلسطين، حيث كانت تضم عشرة حمامات تركية  من أصل 38 في كل فلسطين. مع التطور العمراني ووصول المياه الجارية إلى البيوت، تضاءلت أهمية الحمامات العامة فهجر بعضها أو تضرر بسبب الإهمال بينما تحولت حمامات أخرى إلى مرافق مختلفة مثل حمام الخليلي، حمام الريشة، حمام الدرجة، حمام القاضي، حمام التميمي، وحمام النساء. تم خلال السنوات العشر الماضية تجديد بعض الحمامات التركية مثل حمام السمرة وحمام الشفاء. وإضافة إلى وظيفتها الأساسية، أصبحت هذه الحمامات تشكل ملتقيات للسكان من مختلف الأعمار حيث تشهد إقامة فعاليات ثقافية وتراثية.\n\nالتخريب الإسرائيلي للمعالم الأثرية في نابلس\nتعرضت المباني والمعالم التاريخية في نابلس لأضرار كبيرة من قبل الاحتلال الإسرائيلي، حيث دمر 149 معلماً من هذه المعالم بالكامل بينما تعرض 2000 معلم، أبرزها جامع الخضراء الذي يقدر عمره بـ 400 سنة، وخان الوكالة  لأضرار متنوعة أثناء عمليات الجيش الإسرائيلي في المدينة منذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية عام 2000 وخاصة أثناء عمليتها الكبرى في نابلس في نيسان 2002. وأصاب الضرر قصورًا أثرية ومساجد ومصابن وأسواق.\n\nدور نابلس في النضال القومي العربي والوطني الفلسطيني\nكانت نابلس على الدوام مركزاً للنضال الوطني والقومي حيث لعبت دوراً كبيراً في مقاومة الغزاة. وحسب قسطنطين بازيلي فإن «جبليي نابلس هم أكثر القبائل السورية ضراوة ونزوعاً للقتال.»  لعب مثقفو نابلس وأعيانها أدورا كبيرة في الكفاح القومي. على سبيل المثال، كان عدد الإجمال للأعضاء في المنظمات والأندية القومية التي شكلت حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى 126 عضوا (مثلوا سورية والعراق)، كان منهم ثلاثة عشر عضوا من نابلس ومنطقتها، وهو أعلى تمثيل من فلسطين متبوعا بالقدس التي مثلها تسعة أعضاء. كان معظم هؤلاء ناشطين في جمعية العربية الفتاة وعلى رأسهم عوني عبد الهادي ومحمد عزة دروزة. شارك مندوبون عن نابلس في المؤتمر السوري العام الذي عقد في دمشق عام 1920 وألقى محمد عزة دروزة مقررات المؤتمر التي أعلنت استقلال سورية بحدودها الطبيعية ونادت بفيصل بن الحسين ملكا عليها.\nمن أهم الأحداث التي شهدتها نابلس المؤتمر الفلسطيني الخامس من 20 إلى 24 آب 1922 والذي أعلن الفلسطينيون خلاله رفض الانتداب وإصدار طوابع عليها شعارات فلسطينية ومقاطعة اليهود في البيع والشراء. لمتابعة المؤتمر عقد في نابلس مؤتمر آخر بتاريخ 18 أيلول 1931 سمي بمؤتمر التسليح، حيث طالب بالاستقلال والوحدة العربية ودعا إلى مقاطعة حكومة الانتداب وتسليح عرب فلسطين إن لم تستجب لذلك.\n\nنابلس في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية\nتعتبر مدينة نابلس أكثر المدن الفلسطينية تعرضًا للحصار والضربات العسكرية من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية ابتداءً من العام 2000. أدى الحصار المستمر للمدينة وصعوبة تبادل البضائع إلى تدهور مكانة المدينة كمركز اقتصادي، وأدى إلى ارتفاع نسب البطالة كثيرًا، مما أدى إلى هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى الخارج أو إلى مدن أخرى خاصة رام الله. تصف إسرائيل المدينة بأنها «مصنع للإرهابيين»، وقامت قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي بعدة عمليات عسكرية واسعة النطاق في المدينة أو عمليات شملت عدة مناطق من ضمنها مدينة نابلس من أشهرها عملية الدرع الواقي عام 2002 وذلك نتيجة عدد الاستشهاديين الذين خرجوا منها. كانت نابلس الأكثر تضرراً من بين المحافظات الفلسطينية على صعيد الخسائر الاقتصادية حيث سجلت 2630 منشأة غير عاملة من بين العدد الكلي للمنشآت (17,167) أو ما نسبته 15% من المنشآت فيها وفق نتائج تعداد 2007،  وهذه أعلى نسبة سجلت في فلسطين.\n\nأعلام نابلس\nعلى الصعيد القومي\nخرج من نابلس شعراء وكتاب ورجال سياسة واقتصاد منهم من تبوأ مناصب رفيعة على مستوى فلسطين والأردن وسوريا والوطن العربي عمومًا. من أشهر هؤلاء في القرن العشرين:\n\nأحمد طوقان، رئيس وزراء سابق  للأردن.\nالشيخ عبد الحميد السائح، رئيس سابق للمجلس الوطني الفلسطيني، وأول من شغل منصب وزير الأوقاف والشؤون

          "summary": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.",

          "content": "Naplouse (en arabe : نابلس, Nablus ; en hébreu : שְׁכֶם, Chékhem ou Sichem) est une ville située en Palestine (Cisjordanie, en partie occupée par l'armée israélienne et par des colons juifs israéliens). Chef-lieu du gouvernorat de Naplouse, elle fait partie des territoires actuellement administrés par l'Autorité palestinienne.\nLa commune de Naplouse comptait une population d'environ 150 000 habitants en 2016.\nElle abrite des lieux saints de différentes religions, juifs, samaritains, musulmans et chrétiens.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nElle se trouve en Cisjordanie, à environ 65 kilomètres au nord de Jérusalem et environ 50 au nord de Ramallah, siège de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne.\n\nCommunes limitrophes\nNaplouse est globalement tributaire de la situation particulière de la Cisjordanie depuis les accords d'Oslo, divisée en trois zones d'autonomie plus ou moins forte : la zone A dont fait partie le territoire de Naplouse relève pour l'administration civile de l'Autorité palestinienne, établie à Ramallah, mais la route 60 toute proche et le mont Garizim font partie de la zone C, où l'autorité israélienne est totale.\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nLe centre de Naplouse est situé dans une vallée d'une altitude de 550 mètres, orientée nord-ouest/sud-est, entre le mont Ébal (940 m) au nord et le mont Garizim (881 m) au sud.\n\nVoies de communication\nÀ 3 km à l'ouest de Naplouse passe la route 60 qui relie Nazareth (Israël) au nord à Beer-Sheva (Israël) au sud en passant par Jénine (Cisjordanie), Jérusalem et Hébron (Cisjordanie). En Cisjordanie, la route 60 est sous la surveillance de l'armée israélienne, mais il y règne cependant une grande insécurité.\nDe cette route partent des routes vers Haïfa, Netanya et Tel Aviv-Jaffa, trois villes d'Israël situées sur le littoral.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nLa ville, fondée en 72 par les Romains, est nommée Flavia Neapolis (« Nouvelle cité flavienne »), en l'honneur de l'empereur Vespasien, de son nom romain Titus Flavius Vespasianus, qui règne de 70 à 79.\nCelui-ci la fait construire à la place d'un village samaritain appelé Mabartha, situé à environ deux kilomètres à l'ouest de la ville de Sichem (שְׁכֶם), première capitale de l'ancien royaume d'Israël, dont le nom est utilisé pour désigner Naplouse en hébreu. Elle est initialement peuplée d'anciens légionnaires romains (vétérans) qui reçoivent des parcelles de terre à cultiver.\nL'empereur Hadrien (vers 130) y fait construire un grand théâtre pouvant accueillir sept mille spectateurs. Les archéologues ont trouvé des pièces de monnaie de cette époque avec des emblèmes militaires et les visages des dieux et déesses grecs Zeus, Artémis, Sérapis ou Asclépios. Neapolis est entièrement païenne à l'époque. Le chrétien Justin de Naplouse naît dans la cité au IIe siècle et étudie le platonisme. La cité est prospère et tire encore des bénéfices de la lutte entre Septime Sévère et Pescennius Niger en 198-199. Cependant, elle prend parti pour ce dernier, et Septime Sévère en conséquence lui ôte ses privilèges commerciaux en faveur de Sébaste.\n\nPhilippe l'Arabe transforme Flavia Neapolis en Julia Neapolis en 244 et y fait venir de nouveaux colons romains. Elle garde le statut de colonie jusqu'en 251 sous Trébonien Galle. La ville à cette époque devient majoritairement chrétienne, avec une minorité samaritaine. L'évêque de Neapolis participe au concile de Nicée en 325.Des révoltes de Samaritains interviennent au Ve siècle, notamment en 451, à cause de relèvements de taxes. La ville, comme toute la Palestine, fait partie de la Syrie sous administration de l'Empire romain d'Orient, ou Empire byzantin et elle est agitée par les querelles du monophysisme - les monophysites refusant le retour du patriarche Juvénal au siège de Jérusalem. Les tensions augmentent en 485, lorsque des Samaritains assassinent des fidèles chrétiens qui se trouvaient dans la cathédrale de la ville, sous prétexte de rumeurs indiquant que les dépouilles des fils et petits-fils d'Aaron seraient transférées ailleurs par les chrétiens. L'évêque Térébinthe, qui a été blessé dans l'affaire, se rend à Constantinople pour demander un renforcement de la garnison. L'empereur Zénon fait bâtir une église dédiée à la Théotokos (Vierge Marie) au mont Garizim - lieu saint des Samaritains - et empêche ces derniers de se rendre sur leur colline sacrée. Ils se rebellent sous le règne de son successeur, l'empereur Anastase Ier, et plus tard la révolte est matée par Procope, gouverneur romain (c'est-à-dire byzantin) d'Édesse. Une dernière révolte intervient en 529, qui débute par l'assassinat de l'évêque Ammonas, tandis que les prêtres de la cité sont écartelés, puis brûlés avec les reliques des saints. Justinien Ier envoie ses troupes qui saccagent la cité ; les Samaritains qui ne s'enfuient pas sont en grande partie massacrés.\nNeapolis connaît ensuite une grande période de prospérité qui dure un siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nPériode des califats musulmans\nAprès la conquête de la cité par les musulmans, Arabes venus de Médine et La Mecque, en 636, quatre ans seulement après la mort du prophète Mahomet, la cité est renommée Nablus, arabisation de son ancien nom. La cité continue d'être une ville commerciale d'importance, et change de population sous la pression démographique de nouveaux immigrés musulmans venus de Perse et d'Arabie, et de l'arrivée de commerçants juifs. Les chrétiens et les Samaritains demeurent toutefois une fraction importante de la population.\nLe géographe arabe Al-Maqdisi la décrit au Xe siècle, comme un « petit Damas ». Naplouse est réputée pour ses ateliers de tissage, en particulier du lin, ses oliveraies et sa grande place du marché. La ville est entourée de moulins. On y construit la première mosquée fort imposante, tandis que la population s'islamise peu à peu, les chrétiens et les Samaritains étant soumis à des impôts plus importants. De plus, l'usage de l'arabe supplante définitivement l'usage du grec vers le Xe siècle.\n\nPériode du royaume croisé de Jérusalem\nLes Croisés arrivent ici en 1099 avec Tancrède et la renomment « Naples » (le nom de la « Naples » italienne vient aussi d'une ancienne « Neapolis », tout comme « Nabeul » en Tunisie). La cité devient la ville majeure en la seigneurie de Naplouse, un fief du royaume de Jérusalem. Elle est épargnée des combats, et des croisés s'y installent même. Le concile de Naplouse s'y réunit en 1120 et jette les fondations des premières codifications et lois du royaume franc. La communauté samaritaine a le droit de construire une nouvelle synagogue vers 1130, l'ancienne étant transformée en église.\nC'est vers 1140 et le milieu du XIIe siècle que les Arabes musulmans et leurs troupes turques reprennent leurs attaques à partir de leur base arrière de Damas. Ils brûlent les églises et une partie de la ville en 1137, mais finissent par être repoussés. La reine Mélisende de Jérusalem demeure à Naplouse qui retrouve sa prospérité, entre 1150 et 1161. Les croisés restaurent et agrandissent la ville, font construire une nouvelle église dédiée à la Passion du Christ et une autre à sa Résurrection, ainsi qu'une vaste hôtellerie pour les pèlerins chrétiens.\nCependant, les musulmans commandés par la dynastie ayyoubide s'emparent de Naplouse en 1187. La majorité des chrétiens latins s'enfuit par crainte de vengeance, tandis que les chrétiens arabes grecs-orthodoxes et les Samaritains demeurent, ainsi bien sûr que les musulmans.\nLes églises croisées et la synagogue samaritaine sont transformées en mosquées.\n\nPériode des Mamelouks du Caire\nLes Mamelouks d'Égypte s'emparent de Naplouse en 1260, y font construire de nouvelles écoles et de nouvelles mosquées, des bains turcs et des canalisations d'eau. L'huile d'olive et le savon de Naplouse sont exportés et réputés, jusqu'en Syrie, Arabie, Égypte et les îles méditerranéennes, ainsi que la confiture de caroube.\n\nPériode ottomane (1517-1917)\nLa Palestine tombe sous l'autorité ottomane en 1517. Elle fait partie de la Syrie ottomane et est divisée en six districts (sandjak) dont Naplouse est l'un d'eux. Le district de Naplouse est lui-même divisé en cinq sous-districts en plus de la ville. Les subdivisions correspondent aux terres et à l'influence de puissantes familles. L'islam devient nettement majoritaire au XVIe siècle. En 1552, seules quelque douze famille juives se trouvent dans la ville, rencontrées par le voyageur Moïse Bassola (en). Des recensements municipaux effectués au XVIe siècle témoignent toutefois d'une communauté juive comptant de 30 à 70 familles. Naplouse est pacifiée à plusieurs reprises surtout en 1657 grâce à l'intervention et aux finances de familles et tribus syriennes. En remerciement pour leur participation au retour au calme, le pouvoir du sultan attribue des terres et des villages à ces familles, comme les Nimr, originaires d'Homs, les Djarrar ou les Touqan, qui dirigent l'administration de la ville.\nDaher el-Omar, gouverneur galiléen en rivalité avec le pouvoir ottoman s'allie au milieu du XVIIIe siècle avec les Mamelouks pour les faire revenir dans la région, et fait lever des troupes, mais Naplouse ne succombe pas, cependant Naplouse passe sous la juridiction de Saint-Jean-d'Acre, jusqu'en 1804.\n\nL'Égypte obtient son autonomie sous Méhémet Ali et part à la conquête de la Palestine en 1831-1832. Cependant en 1834, les clans des grandes familles de Naplouse se rebellent contre l'autorité égyptienne, à cause de l'augmentation des impôts et d'une politique de conscription répressive. Jérusalem est conquise par la rébellion le 31 mai 1834, mais les rebelles sont délogés un mois plus tard par les soldats d'Ibrahim Pacha. La forteresse de Saint-Jean-d'Acre est détruite, ce qui a pour conséquence de favoriser le développement de Naplouse. Les Ottomans reprennent le pouvoir en main et mettent le clan Abd al-Hadi à la tête des instances locales.\nNaplouse surpasse en importance Jérusalem, Acre, ou Jaffa. Son activité principale est liée à la fabrique et au commerce d'huile d'olive et de ses produits dérivés, comme le savon. C'est aussi une des régions principales de la Syrie ottomane pour le coton, dépassant Damas.\nDu fait de sa situation entourée de collines, Naplouse cultive un certain esprit et aussi un certain état d'autonomie par rapport au pouvoir central ottoman. En 1848, le voyageur historien Baptistin Poujoulat écrit dans Récits et souvenirs d'un voyage en Orient que la ville compte alors 6 000 habitants, musulmans, juifs, samaritains et chrétiens, et qu' « ils vivraient dans l'aisance s'ils n'étaient pas pressurés par l'impôt du gouvernement turc ».\n\nÀ partir de la fin du XIXe siècle, la présence juive à Naplouse décline, malgré la présence de rabbins reconnus, mais qui n'étaient entourés que de poignées de fidèles. De plusieurs dizaines de familles au début du XVIIIe siècle, la communauté n'en compte aux débuts du sionisme qu'une douzaine, en partie par l'attraction produite par les nouvelles localités juives, relativement éloignées de la Samarie. Le passage au XXe siècle voit l'effacement de la présence juive à Naplouse.\n\nXXe siècle\nPériode de l'occupation, puis du mandat britannique (1917-1948)\nNaplouse passe sous autorité britannique à partir de novembre 1917. C'est la fin du pouvoir ottoman. La Société des Nations donne mandat en 1920 aux Britanniques pour favoriser en Palestine la création d'un foyer de peuplement juif.\nUn tremblement de terre sévère détruit en 1927 la partie historique de la ville, dont trois-cents bâtiments et la mosquée de la Victoire. La ville est reconstruite, mais elle perd son caractère historique en grande partie. De plus, les Britanniques détruisent le vieux quartier de Qaryoun, foyer de rébellion, après les révoltes de 1936-1939.\n\nPériode de l'occupation jordanienne (1949-1967)\nNaplouse fait partie de la Cisjordanie, après le plan de partage de 1947. Des milliers de Palestiniens ayant quitté les territoires administrés par le nouvel État d'Israël s'installent dans des camps de réfugiés aux abords de la ville et dans la ville elle-même, annexée par la Jordanie. Les camps principaux sont Ein Beit al-Ma, Balata et Askar. Raymonda Hawa-Tawil (La « Lionne de Naplouse ») y tient dans les années 1960-1970 un salon d'intellectuels.\n\nPériode de l'occupation israélienne (1967-1995)\nLa guerre des Six Jours a pour conséquence l'administration israélienne et la fondation de localités juives autour de la ville, Berakha, Itamar et Elon Moreh étant les plus proches.\nFinalement, l'autorité palestinienne obtient l'administration de la ville à partir du 12 décembre 1995, selon les accords d'Oslo, ce qui provoque l'élimination quasi totale de la circulation de Juifs dans la ville (à titre d'exemple la ligne de bus Jérusalem-Afula de la compagnie israélienne Egged comptait auparavant Naplouse parmi ses stations principales).\n\nSeconde Intifada (2000-2002)\nLes tensions augmentent en l'an 2000 entre les forces israéliennes et les habitants des camps de réfugiés, en particulier ceux de Balata et d'Askar. Lorsque les Palestiniens déclenchent la seconde intifada, des armements sont fabriqués dans ces camps et la présence juive dans la ville est éliminée. La répression aboutit selon le bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires à 522 morts dans la ville de Naplouse et les camps environnants et à 3 104 blessés entre 2000 et 2005.\n\nL'attentat du 27 mars 2002 à l'hôtel Park de Netanya qui cause la mort de 30 civils juifs et en blesse 143, suivi du meurtre de 4 membres de la famille Gavish le lendemain à Elon Moreh et de l'attentat meurtrier à Netzarim le surlendemain, provoque l'opération Rempart de la part des autorités israéliennes du gouvernement Sharon. Naplouse est une des villes visées du fait de la présence de responsables des massacres. Quatre-vingts habitants de Naplouse sont tués et plusieurs maisons détruites. Une seconde opération démarre le 22 juin suivant et les forces armées israéliennes restent à Naplouse jusqu'en septembre, imposant un couvre-feu de vingt-quatre heures pendant soixante-dix jours. Soixante maisons d'activistes palestiniens sont détruites au bulldozer, la grande mosquée et d'autres mosquées, ainsi que l'église grecque-orthodoxe, sont endommagées par les combats.\n\nXXIe siècle\nNaplouse est actuellement cernée par de nombreuses colonies israéliennes et par deux bases militaires israéliennes perchées sur les crêtes des montagnes. Beaucoup de Palestiniens subissent les arrestations préventives et les détentions administratives sans procès ni jugement.\nLe 16 octobre 2015, des Palestiniens incendient le tombeau de Joseph, lieu de pèlerinage des Juifs orthodoxes.\nLe groupe armé La Fosse aux lions, formé de quelques dizaines de jeunes combattants, a été formé à Naplouse en 2022. Beaucoup d'entre eux ont été tués dans des raids israéliens et la ville a été soumise à un blocus en 2022.\nLe 19 février 2023, un raid israélien fait onze morts et au moins cent deux blessés par balles.\nLe 9 octobre 2024, selon le Croissant Rouge et le ministère de la Santé, quatre Palestiniens âgés de 31 à 43 ans sont tués lors d'une opération de la police israélienne ; de leur côté, les Israéliens, dans un communiqué commun de la police, de l'armée et du Shin Bet, affirment avoir abattu cinq personnes recherchées pour terrorisme. D'après le gouverneur de Naplouse, les victimes était des « citoyens ordinaires ».\nLe 25 février 2025, un habitant de la ville est tué et d'autres blessés par l'armée israélienne.\n\nDepuis le début de la guerre de Gaza en 2023 toute la région de Naplouse subit des contrôles parfois très longs. Dix-sept checkpoints militaires entourent la ville en 2025. Le 10 juin 2025, l'armée israélienne lance une vaste opération militaire contre la ville ; deux personnes sont tuées, plus d'une soixantaine blessées et d'autres arrêtées dans la répression d'un groupe de jeunes hommes et des garçons qui s'étaient réunis pour brûler des pneus et jeter des pierres sur les véhicules blindés des forces d'occupation israéliennes. Un couvre-feu est instauré et les bâtiments publics de Naplouse, notamment les écoles, sont fermés. Un adolescent est tué par l’armée israélienne le 24 octobre. Un homme de 57 ans est tué près d'un point de contrôle le 5 septembre.\n\nPolitique et administration\nLa ville est dirigée par un conseil de quatorze membres.\n\nJumelages\nLille (France)\n Naples (Italie)\n Poznań (Pologne) depuis le 22 mai 1997\n Stavanger (Norvège)\n Schaerbeek (Belgique)\n\nPatrimoine\nLe puits de Jacob\nLe puits de Jacob est situé à l'entrée[Laquelle ?] de l'actuelle Naplouse.\n\nLe tombeau de Joseph\nSichem, site du tombeau de Joseph.

          "content": "## Overview\nNablus (Arabic نابلس, Hebrew שכם, Shechem) is a large city (population approximately 300,000) within the Palestinian Territories, in the Central Highlands of the West Bank, some 63 km north of Jerusalem.\n\n## Understand\nNablus is one of the oldest cities in the world, possibly established 9,000 years ago. It was called \"Shechem\" by its Canaanite and Israelite inhabitants. Shechem was the first capital of the northern ancient Israelite kingdom. The Romans built a new city (Flavia Neapolis, in honor of Flavius Vespasian) a short distance from Shechem. The name Nablus comes from Neapolis. The old city of Nablus is on the site of Neapolis, but in modern times the city has grown to include the site of Shechem as well.\nNablus is distinguished by its location in a narrow valley between the two mountains Gerizim and Ebal. This makes for an impressive view when you are in the city.\nSchools were established in the middle of the 19th century during the short reign of Ibrahim Pasha, but maintained their existence in the following years when the Ottomans regained control of the region. On 11 July 1927 the town suffered a major earthquake. Much of the consequent damage to buildings was never repaired, and the ruinous condition of many of them may well have encouraged the inhabitants to move outside the old city to build their new houses, although some new building to the north and west of the old city had already been undertaken before 1927. The arrival of the motor car has increased emigration to the slopes of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where new roads allow vehicles the easy access denied them in the hilly and partly-stepped streets of the old city.\nDuring the British Mandate (1917–1948), Nablus became the core of Palestinian Arab Nationalism, and it was the center of resistance against the British. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Nablus came under Jordanian rule, and two refugee camps were built near the city. In 1967, Nablus was occupied by the Israeli army for years, which caused much damage to the city. Three refugee camps were added to accommodate the people who fled to the city.\nNablus was invaded and occupied in 2002 during the Second Intifada, and has been raided frequently ever since. Nablus has a particularly high concentration of open anti-Israeli sentiments for a major West Bank city; you can see many memorials to Palestinians killed during Israeli attacks in the old city, and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Palestinian militants occasionally clash in some parts of greater Nablus such as the refugee camps. There are many damaged buildings and debris-filled fields around Nablus, the result of past Israeli aerial bombing, but the residents of Nablus have been working hard on repairing their city and the visible damage lessens every day. Israeli restrictions on the city are generally looser than they used to be, and a visit to Nablus in the daytime is a safe and worthwhile trip.\n\n## Get in\nAs of July 2010 there were no checkpoints for buses and service taxis (aka servees) entering Nablus from other West Bank cities, although you will need your passport and visa stamp to enter back into Israeli territory upon your return.\n\n## By bus\nRamallah and Jerusalem: From Jerusalem, take the #18 bus to Ramallah. The bus departs from the bus station off Nablus Road north of Damascus Gate and the Old City. A #18 bus leaves every 10 minutes throughout the day, and it costs ₪7. This bus will drop passengers off at the main street in Ramallah, but stay on until the main bus station. From the Ramallah Bus Station, a bus runs to Nablus (₪10.5) but the last bus leaves early, often around 4PM. If the last bus has already left a servees taxi will take you to Nablus from Ramallah for around ₪17. There are at least four bus stations in Ramallah, so ask around if you get off/start at the wrong one.\nOther West Bank cities: Servees taxis are easily found to Nablus from all major west bank transportation centres including Jenin (₪20), Tulkarm, Jericho, and other cities.\n\n## By plane\nBen Gurion International Airport (TLV) is the main international airport serving Israel and the West Bank. From Ben Gurion it is cheapest to take a \"sherut\" (shared taxi) to the bus station on Nablus Road by Damascus Gate, and then follow the directions above to Nablus. A sherut from Ben Gurion to Jerusalem costs ₪50 and runs constantly 24 hours a day.\n\n## Get around\nMost of the urban area of Nablus is small enough to be navigated on foot. It is not recommend that you wander around too much as there are a number of neighborhoods in Nablus that may have troubles with IDF raids and public unrest. However, the tensions have eased, but you should still check for the latest situation.\nThe public transportation in Nablus is informal, and is normally done by sharing service taxis (aka servees). The black-and-yellow taxis (sometimes with a Hebrew \"Monit\" sign on top) will take you anywhere in Nablus, and it's easy to find people to share the taxi with for many locations.\n\n## See\n32.21945535.2606151 The Old City (southeast from the commercial center). This is a charming area filled with winding narrow streets and small shops selling all kinds of foods, clothing, and trinkets. Simply enter the alleyways leading into it nearby the massive parking garage in the center of town, and wander around until you recognize every street.\nThe Souq (The q is silent) is a typical colorful and loud Palestinian vegetable market located right in the center of town. Look for the tent roofs.\n32.20944735.2854312 Jacob's Well (Be'er Ya'akov). The spot where it is believed that a Samaritan woman offered a drink from the well to Jesus and he then revealed to her that he was the Messiah (John 4:5), is located here. All Western monotheistic religions also believe this to be a site where Jacob camped near Shechem during his travels, hence the name. A Greek Orthodox Church is located on the site, and it is free to tour. Its hours are unpredictable, however. Ask a taxi driver downtown to take you to \"Be'er Ya'akov\" (₪2-5). If you come for a visit, do not venture down the road away from the city center as you will find yourself inside rough neighbourhoods.\n32.203335.269733 Mount Gerizim (overlooking Nablus city). Check for the hours, as this place does not seem to be open all the time. The top of the mountain hosts the community of \"Kiryat Luza\", one of the only two Samaritan communities left in the world. The Samaritans are an ancient offshoot of Judaism who believe that Mount Gerizim, and not the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the location of the Holy of the Holies. The Samaritans of Nablus hold both Palestinian and Israeli ID cards and historically have had good relations with both the Palestinians and the Israelis (they are also represented in the Nablus Municipality). The Palestinians of Nablus revere the Samaritans alleged ability to predict the future with palm readings by using the Samaritan holy books. Kiryat Luza offers tours of their community and even has a gift shop. Genetic studies have made the hypothesis that much of Nablus' Palestinian population are descendants of Samaritans who converted to Islam throughout the centuries of Muslim rule of the Holy Land.    (updated Jun 2018)\n32.21004835.2649384 Monastery of Bir el-Hamam (next to Mount Gerizim). Seen from all over Nablus, this monastery offers a great from above Nablus. The archaeological site included a complex of household installation and spaces, such as an open courtyard, a rain-fed cistern, a stable, and a kitchen. It also included a room with a mosaic floor with fragments of religious texts. This room gave access to an exceptional space of a chapel with colourful mosaics and a dedicatory text for three deceased ‘brothers, lovers of Christ’. A nicely decorated chancel screen separated the holy eastern part, the bema, with its altar table, from the main room.\n32.2126935.2854735 Joseph's Tomb. In the eastern part of the city is a Muslim and Jewish holy site; however, it closes sporadically and it may not be possible to visit. As of March 2008 Joseph's Tomb had part of the roof destroyed and has been burnt out. Of the two Palestinian guards, one spoke English, and after radioing in advised that photos could not be taken without permission.\n32.21335.282046 Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Daily 8AM - 3PM. Tell Balata archaeological site, near Nablus, the site contains the remains of a Middle Bronze Age city with a massive fortification wall (ca. 1650-1450 BC), two impressive gates and a fortress temple. The site has been identified as ancient Shechem, known from Egyptian and biblical references. Tell Balata was an important cultural and political centre due to its strategic location at the eastern end of a pass between Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal. It was overlooking the plain of Askar and commanded all traffic through the area. It was also a centre for agriculture and trade, it has been called “the uncrowned queen of Palestine”. The archaeological evidence on the history on the site is the result of German and American excavation during the 20th century. It shows that Tell Balata was first settled in the Chalcolithic period (c.4000- 3500 BC) and developed into a city during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. The site was used again during the Iron Age and throughout the Hellenistic times until the 1st century BC. After the Hellenistic times the focus of the settlement shifted further west to the newly established Roman town of Flavia Neapolis, now known as Nablus. Tell Balata is a potential World Heritage Site as part of \"Old Town Nablus and its environs\". The site is being developed by a joined Palestinian-Dutch project, in cooperation with UNESCO, into Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Facilities for visitors will be provided, as of 2013 there will be a visitor centre.\nClose-by popular sights of the West Bank (read here) are Sebastia Archaeological Park (conveniently located if you go north towards Jenin), Awarta village, Kifl Hares and Aqabah with the twin minaret.\n\n## Do\nClimb Mount Gerizim or Mount Ebal on either side of Nablus for a beautiful view of the city. A small Samaritan community, one of only two left in the world, resides atop Mt. Gerizim, and you can get a look at their temple on the mountaintop. Mt Gerizim is the most holiest place for the Samaritan religion, believed by the Samaritans to be the first piece of land ever created by God, and the Samaritan community there offers a tour of their community to visitors. If you can come for their Passover (not necessarily the same date as the modern Jewish Passover!) you will see a colorful festival involving the consumption of lamb and goat sacrifices, comparable to Jewish practices 2,000 years ago. Check for opening hours.\nYafo Cultural Centre, ☏ +970 9-232-4553.

          "content": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ḫazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Ḫāzat. It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, עַזָּה ʻAzzā, a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root ע-ז-ז‎ ʻayin-zayin-zayin, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The ע‎ in the root ע-ז-ז‎ corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *ʻ sound (compare Hebrew עַז ʻaz with Arabic عَزَّ ʻazza, both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (غَزَّة, Ġazza), Koine Greek (Γάζα, Gáza), and Egyptian (gꜣḏꜣtw) that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *ġ (/ʁ/) sound, and thus cannot have been from the same ע-ז-ז‎ root as עַז ʻaz.\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as Ġazzat Hāšim in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\nEarly Bronze\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\n\nLate Bronze\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as Azzatu. Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\n\nIron Age\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays–Yaman war (793–796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\n\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\n\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\n\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGaza War\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Gaza is 78 kilometres (48 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, 71 kilometres (44 mi) south of Tel Aviv, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\n\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of 270 feet (82 m) above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (maqam) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\n\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\n\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres) of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds 122 trillion cubic feet (3.5 trillion cubic metres) of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\n\nCulture\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include zibdiyit gambari, literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and shatta which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in sayyadiya, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were fellahin (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. Sumaghiyyeh, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. Maftool is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (qahwa) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\n\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\n\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits 1.5 km (1 mi) northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\n\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\n\nInfrastructure\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\n\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) northeast of the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGaza genocide\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian Authority\nList of rulers of Gaza\nOutline of the State of Palestine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nMunicipality of Gaza\nSpokesperson for Gaza Municipality\nGaza at Google Maps\nThe achievements of the municipal council for a period of 5 years (2008–2013) in Arabic Archived 19 August 2014 at the Wayback Machine",
          "summary": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.",

الشمال الشرقي أراضي مدينة الخليل الغربية المحتلة منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظة غزة إداريًا وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 2,141,000 نسمة في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها أكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من أكثر المدن كثافة بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينة غزة من أهم المدن الفلسطينية؛ لأهمية موقعها الاستراتيجي والأهمية الاقتصادية والعمرانية للمدينة، بالإضافة إلى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والإنجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزاً إسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى أيضاً غزة هاشم، كما أنها مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو أحد أئمة المذاهب الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948م، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجرت عدة تحسينات على المدينة. احتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967م (عام النكسة)، وبعد اتفاقية أوسلو بين منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية وإسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزة-أريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطة المدنية إلى سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثورة المصرية في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطني غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالأنشطة الاقتصادية الرئيسية في قطاع غزة هي الصناعات الصغيرة والزراعة والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الإسرائيلي والصراعات المتكررة.\n\nالتسمية\nتُعتبر غزة أحد أقدم المدن التي عرفها التاريخ، أما سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم فهو غير مُثبَّت بدقة، لأن هذا الاسم كان قابلاً للتبديل والتحريف بتبدل الأمم التي صارعتها، فهي عند الكنعانيين (هزاتي)، وعند الفراعنة (غزاتو أو غذة) منذ القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، أما الآشوريون واليونانيون فكانوا يطلقون عليها (عزاتي) و(فازا)، وعند العبرانيين (عزة). أما العرب الجنوبيين (سبأ، ومعين) فهي عندهم باللفظ العربي (غزة)، وهي في وصفهم ميناء مهم بالقرب من قرى اليهود، وذكرت لديهم منذ القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد فصاعدًا.\nفي العصور الوسطى، سماها الصليبيون (غادرز)، والأتراك لم يغيروا من اسمها العربي (غزة)، أما الإنجليز ويطلقون عليها اسم (گازا) (بالإنجليزية: Gaza). وقد اختلف المؤرخون - كعادتهم بالنسبة لكثير من المدن القديمة – في سبب تسميتها بغزة، فهناك من يقول إنها مشتقة من المَنَعَة والقوة، وهناك من يقول إن معناها: «الثروة»، وآخرون يرون أنها تعني: «المُميزة» أو «المُختصة» بصفات هامة تميزها عن غيرها من المدن. أما ياقوت الحموي فيقول عنها في معجمه: «غَزَّ فلان بفلان واعتز به إذا اختصه من بين أصحابه».\nارتبط العرب بغزة ارتباطاً وثيقاً فقد كان تجارهم يَفِدون إليها في تجارتهم وأسفارهم باعتبارها مركزاً مهماً لعدد من الطرق التجارية، وكانت تمثل الهدف لإحدى الرحلتين الشهيرتين اللتين وردتا في القرآن الكريم في «سورة قريش»: «رحلتا الشتاء والصيف»: رحلة القرشيين شتاءً إلى اليمن، ورحلتهم صيفاً إلى غزة ومشارف الشام. وفي إحدى رحلات الصيف هذه، مات هاشم بن عبد مناف جدُّ الرسول المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم، ودُفن في غزة بالجامع المعروف حالياً بجامع السيد هاشم في حي «الدرج».\n\nالتاريخ\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد. وطيلة تاريخها، لم يكن لغزة حكم مستقل، حيث احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين وغيرهم. وكانت أول مرة تذكر فيها المدينة في مخطوطة للفرعون تحتمس الثالث (القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد)، وكذلك ورد اسمها في رسائل تل العمارنة. بعد 300 سنة من الاحتلال الفرعوني للمدينة نزلت قبيلة من الفلستينيين وسكنت المدينة والمنطقة المجاورة لها، عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزا إسلاميا مهما وخاصة أنها مشهورة بوجود قبر الجد الثاني للنبي محمد، هاشم بن عبد مناف فيها ولذلك أحيانا تسمى غزة هاشم. وتُعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي 767م الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. سيطر الأوروبيون على المدينة في فترة الحملات الصليبية، لكنها رجعت تحت حكم المسلمين بعد أن انتصر صلاح الدين الأيوبي عليهم في معركة حطين عام 1187. ازدهرت المدينة في آخر أيام الحكم العثماني، حيث تأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي عام 1893. سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزء من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجريت عدة تحسينات في المدينة.\nاحتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967 (النكسة)، ولكن في عام 1993م، نُقلت المدينة إلى السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية. بعد انتخابات عام 2006، اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس. ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. لكن بعد الثورة المصرية، قامت مصر بفتح معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطنين غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.\n\nالفترة القديمة\nيعود الاستيطان البشري في منطقة قطاع غزة إلى تل السكن، وهو حصن مصري قديم، والذي بني في الأراضي الكنعانية إلى الجنوب من قطاع غزة في الوقت الحاضر. كما أن مركزًا آخر في المناطق الحضرية المعروفة باسم تل العجول بدأ ينمو على طول وادي مجرى النهر في غزة.\nخلال العصر البرونزي الأوسط، أصبحت تل السكن أقصى مدن جنوب كنعان، وكانت وظيفتها بمثابة حصن. في عام 1650 قبل الميلاد، عندما احتل الهكسوس مصر، عُمرت مدينة ثانية على أنقاض تل السكن. ومع ذلك، هجرها في القرن 14 قبل الميلاد، في نهاية العصر البرونزي.\nأصبحت غزة في وقت لاحق عاصمة مصر الإدارية في أرض كنعان. في عهد تحتمس الثالث، أصبحت المدينة محطة على طريق القوافل بين مصر وسوريا، وجاءت في رسائل تل العمارنة باسم \"Azzati\".\nبقيت المدينة تحت السيطرة المصرية لمدة 350 عاما حتى غزاها الفلستينيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، وأصبحت جزءا من البنتابوليس \"pentapolis\" الخاص بهم. ووفقا لسفر القضاة، فإن غزة كانت المكان الذي كان قد سجن فيه شمشون من قبل الفلستينيين حتى وفاته.\nبعد أن سيطر الآشوريون والمصريون على المدينة، حققت غزة الاستقلال النسبي والازدهار في ظل الامبراطورية الفارسية. ولقد حاصر الاسكندر الأكبر غزة، حيث بقت آخر مدينة تقاوم غزوه في طريقه إلى مصر، لمدة خمسة أشهر قبل احتلالها أخيرا سنة 332 قبل الميلاد، وكان سكانها إما قتلوا أو تم سبيهم. أحضر الإسكندر البدو المحليين ليسكنوا غزة، ونظم المدينة إلى بوليس (أو دولة-المدينة). وقد اكتسبت المدينة سمعة طيبة كمركز مزدهر للتعلم اليونانية والفلسفة.\nشهدت غزة حصارا آخر في 96 قبل الميلاد من قبل الحشمونيين الذين «أطاحوا تماما» في المدينة، مما أسفر عن مقتل 500 من أعضاء مجلس الشيوخ الذين كانوا قد فروا إلى معبد أبولو للسلامة.\n\nالعهد الروماني والبيزنطي\nأُعيد بناء المدينة بعد دمجها في الإمبراطورية الرومانية في 63 قبل الميلاد تحت قيادة بومبيوس الكبير، ثم أصبحت غزة بعد ذلك جزءا من أحد مقاطعات الدولة الرومانية في بلاد الشام. وكانت المدينة مستهدفة من قبل اليهود خلال تمردهم ضد الحكم الروماني في 66 وقد دمرت جزئيا. وظلت مع ذلك مدينة مهمة، خاصة بعد تدمير القدس. طوال العصر الروماني، كانت غزة مدينة مزدهرة وتلقى المنح واهتمام عدة أباطرة. كان 500 عضو في مجلس الشيوخ يحكم غزة، وكان سكان المدينة مجموعة متنوعة من مختلف الأعراق، منهم الفلستينيين والإغريق والرومان والكنعانيين والفينيقيين واليهود والفراعنة والفرس، بالإضافة إلى البدو. وكانت تصدر في غزة عملات معدنية تزين مع تماثيل الآلهة والأباطرة. وخلال زيارته للمدينة في 130م، قام الإمبراطور هادريان بافتتاح حلبة المصارعة شخصيا، في ملعب غزة الجديد، الذي أصبح معروفًا من الإسكندرية إلى دمشق. وقد زينت المدينة في العديد من المعابد الوثنية، وكان الإله الرئيسي \"مارناس\"، وهو أحد الآلهة القديمة التي انتشرت عبادتها في سوريا القديمة منذ النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وكان يطلق عليها داجون. وخُصصت المعابد الأخرى لزيوس، وهيليوس، وأفروديت، وأبولو، وأثينا، وتيشي المحلية.\nبدأت المسيحية بالانتشار في جميع أنحاء منطقة غزة في 250م، بما في ذلك في ميناء غزة.\nوتسارع اعتناق المسيحية في منطقة غزة في فترة القديس بورفيريوس (بين عامي 396م و 420م). في سنة 402م، أمر الإمبراطور ثيودوسيوس الثاني بتدمير جميع معابد المدينة الوثنية الثمانية، وبعد أربع سنوات كلفت الإمبراطورة ايليا ببناء كنيسة فوق أنقاض معبد Marnas.\nوبعد انقسام الإمبراطورية الرومانية في القرن 3 م، كانت غزة لا تزال تحت سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية الشرقية التي بدورها أصبحت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية. ازدهرت المدينة، وكانت مركزا هاما لبلاد الشام.\n\nالحكم الإسلامي\nفي عام 635م حاصر المسلمون غزة وسيطر عليها جيش الخلفاء الراشدين تحت قيادة عمرو بن العاص بعد معركة أجنادين بين الإمبراطورية البيزنطية والخلافة الراشدة في وسط فلسطين. وكان وصول العرب المسلمين قد جلب تغييرات جذرية على غزة، في البداية حُولت بعض الكنائس إلى مساجد، بما في ذلك المسجد الكبير الحالي في قطاع غزة (الأقدم في المدينة)، كما أن شريحة كبيرة من السكان اعتنقت الإسلام، وأصبحت اللغة العربية هي اللغة الرسمية.\nوتعتبر المدينة مسقط رأس الشافعي (767) الذي هو أحد الأئمة الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة. والذي عاش طفولته المبكرة هناك. وكان الشافعي قد أسس فلسفة إسلامية سنية في الفقه، وسُمي المذهب الشافعي تكريما له. وعلى الرغم من حظر الكحول في الإسلام، سمح للجاليات اليهودية والمسيحية للحفاظ على إنتاج النبيذ والعنب، وهو محصول نقدي رئيسي في المدينة، وكانت أساسا للتصدير إلى مصر. لأنه تحدها الصحراء، وكانت غزة عرضة لقتال جماعات البدو.\nفي عام 796م دُمرت غزة خلال حرب أهلية بين القبائل العربية في المنطقة. ومع ذلك، تم إعادة بناء المدينة من قبل الخلافة العربية الثالثة التي يحكمها العباسيون. وقد وصف الجغرافي العربي المقدسي غزة في 977م حين كان يحكمها الفاطميون «بأنها بلدة كبيرة تقع على الطريق الرئيسي لمصر على الحدود مع الصحراء.» وقد كان في تلك الفترة اتفاق مع السلاجقة، تم بموجبه سيطرة الفاطميين على غزة والأراضي الواقعة جنوبها، بما في ذلك مصر.\n\nالصليبيون والمماليك\nاحتل الصليبيون الأوروبيون المدينة من الفاطميين في عام 1100م، وقام الملك بلدوين الثالث ببناء القلعة التي استخدمها فرسان الهيكل في غزة في عام 1149. كما تحول الجامع الكبير إلى كاتدرائية القديس يوحنا. في عام 1154، كتب الرحالة العربي الإدريسي عن غزة «المدينة اليوم كثيرة السكان، وهي في أيدي الصليبيين».\nفي عام 1187م سيطرت القوات الأيوبية، بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على غزة، ثم دُمّرت تحصيناتها لاحقًا عام 1191م. وقد أمر ريتشارد قلب الأسد بتدعيم المدينة مرة أخري في 1192، لكن تم تفكيك الجدران مرة أخرى نتيجة لمعاهدة الرملة المتفق عليها في 1193. ولقد استمرت الفترة الأيوبية حتى 1260، بعد تدمير المدينة تماما على يد المغول تحت قيادة هولاكو، حيث أصبحت غزة أبعد نقطة إلى جنوب يتقدم إليها الجيش المغولي.\nبعد تدمير غزة على يد المغول، بدأ الجنود المماليك بإدارة المنطقة في عام 1277م. وقد جعل المماليك غزة عاصمة المحافظة التي تحمل اسمها «حاكمية قطاع غزة». هذه منطقة تمتد على طول السهل الساحلي من مدينة رفح في الجنوب إلى الشمال مباشرة من قيسارية، وإلى الشرق. بقدر ما المرتفعات الغربية وتلال الخليل المدن الرئيسية الأخرى في المحافظة وشملت اللد والرملة. وقد استخدم غزة التي دخلت فترة من الهدوء خلال الفترة المملوكية بها كموقع في هجماتهم ضد الصليبيين التي انتهت في 1290.\nفي عام 1294م، ضرب زلزال غزة فدمرها، وبعد مرور خمس سنوات، عاد المغول ليُدمروا كل ما أعاد المماليك بناءه. وقد وصف الجغرافي الدمشقي (الذي توفي عام 1327) غزة باعتبارها «مدينة كثيرة الشجر، كسماط ممدود لجيش الإسلام في أبواب الرمل ولكل صادر ووارد إلى الديار المصرية والشامية.» وفي 1348م، انتشر الطاعون في المدينة، فقضى على معظم سكانها. كما عانى قطاع غزة من الفيضانات المدمرة في عام 1352، والتي كانت نادرة في ذلك الجزء القاحل من بلاد الشام الجنوبية.\nإلا أن الرحالة العربي والكاتب ابن بطوطة عندما زار المدينة في 1355، كتب عنها «انها كبيرة ومزدحمة بالسكان، وفيها العديد من المساجد». وقد ساهم المماليك في الهندسة المعمارية في غزة ببناء المساجد والمدارس الإسلامية، والمستشفيات، والحمامات العامة. كما سمحوا لليهود بالعودة إلى المدينة، وقد شهد العصر المملوكي ازدهار المجتمع اليهودي في المدينة. في عام 1481م، كتب الرحالة مشولام «إنها أرض جيدة، ذات أشجار فاكهة وثمار والتي هي من نوعية ممتازة، وهناك الخبز والخمر، والذي هو من صنع اليهود فقط، وفيها عدد كبير من السكان، هناك 70 عائلة يهودية 4 عائلات سامرية». في نهاية العصر المملوكي كانت الطائفة اليهودية في غزة ثالث أكبر جالية يهودية في فلسطين، بعد صفد والقدس.\nوقد بنى المماليك واحدا من أهم المعالم في غزة، وهو قصر الباشا، الذي كان يُستخدم لحكم المدينة وإدارتها. ويقع القصر في البلدة القديمة وهو اليوم مدرسة للبنات، بالقرب من مقبرة حرب الكومنولث، غالبًا ما يشار إليها بمقبرة الحرب البريطانية، والتي تحتوي على قبور جنود الحلفاء الذين سقطوا في الحرب العالمية الأولى وهي في حي التفاح.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت المدينة تحت حكم الخلافة العثمانية الإسلامية في القرن السادس عشر وبقيت تحت حكمهم حتى سنة 1917 عندما استولت عليها القوات البريطانية خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى بعد ثلاثة معارك ضارية راح ضحيتها الآلاف من كلا الجانبين. وكانت غزة تتبع متصرفية القدس العثمانية، والتي كانت تتبع مباشرة للباب العالي دون أن تتبع أيا من الولايات. وكانت المتصرفية تضم بالإضافة إلى قضاء غزة، كل من أقضية يافا وبئر السبع والخليل. وقد حافظت متصرفية القدس حتى أواخر العهد العثماني- باستثناء الفترة من 1906 حتى 1909 عندما ضم إليها قضاء الناصرة- على حدودها.\nيذكر أنه في الحرب العالمية الأولى عندما صمد لواء واحد من الجيش العثماني مؤلف من أقل من ثلاثة آلف جندي فلسطيني في وجه فرقتين بريطانيتين أمام غزة وكبدهم خسائر فادحة وأرغمهما على التقهقر حتى العريش عام 1917 م، أصدر أحمد جمال باشا القائد التركي الذي اشتهر بخصومته للعرب، بيانا رسميا أشاد فيه بالشجاعة الفذة التي أبداها أولئك الجنود الفلسطينيون في غزة أمام أضعاف أضعافهم من جنود الأعداء، وأنها بسالة خارقة تذكر بالشجاعة التي أبداها آباؤهم من قبل عندما حموا هذه البقاع المقدسة بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت غزة بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت غزة مركزا لقضاء غزة في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة، أصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى الدولة الفلسطينية المقترحة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قامت مصر بدخول المدينة عام 1948. في فبراير عام 1949 وقعت كل من مصر وإسرائيل هدنة تقضي باحتفاظ مصر بالمدينة ولذلك كانت مأوى لكثير من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عند خروجهم من ديارهم. وبقيت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nوكانت غزة في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء غزة، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\nحكومة عموم فلسطين\n\nهي حكومة تشكلت في غزة في 23 سبتمبر 1948  وذلك خلال حرب 1948 برئاسة أحمد حلمي عبد الباقي.\nنشأت فكرت تكوينها عندما أعلنت بريطانيا عن نيتها التخلي عن انتدابها على فلسطين وأحالت قضيتها إلى الأمم المتحدة. أدركت القيادة الفلسطينية عندئذ، ممثلة آنذاك بالهيئة العربية العليا لفلسطين بزعامة الحاج أمين الحسيني، أهمية التهيؤ لهذا الحدث واستباقه بإيجاد إطار دستوري يملأ الفراغ الذي سوف ينجم عن انتهاء الانتداب البريطاني وكان هذا الإطار هو إقامة حكومة عربية فلسطينية.\nكان قبل ذلك فولك برنادوت قد أعلن في تقرير له في 16 سبتمبر 1948 أن العرب لم يبدوا أي رغبة في تشكيل حكومة في القسم العربي من فلسطين مما قد يؤدي إلى ضمه إلى شرق الأردن. وقد قوبل إعلان هذه الحكومة بالرفض من عدة أنظمة عربية هي الأردن والعراق ومصر. وظل تمثيلها شكليا لفلسطين في الجامعة العربية لعدة سنوات قبل انهيارها.\n\nالحكم المصري\nبعد حرب 1948، أُلحقت المدينة مع كامل قطاع غزة بمصر، حيث بقت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nفي فترة العدوان الثلاثي على مصر سنة 1956 قامت إسرائيل باحتلال المدينة والسيطرة على شبه جزيرة سيناء المصرية، لكن الضغط العالمي على إسرائيل اضطرها للانسحاب منها.\nحيث حدث في ربيع 1956 عدّة اصطدامات عسكرية بين مصر وإسرائيل حدثت في قطاع غزة. إسرائيل اتّهمت مصر باستعمال المنطقة كقاعدة للغارات الفدائية على إسرائيل. في أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 1956، هاجمت إسرائيل منطقة قناة السويس في مصر بالتعاون مع فرنسا وبريطانيا، استولت القوّات الإسرائيلية على قطاع غزة وتقدّمت إلى سيناء.\nفي مارس/آذار التالي، حلّت قوات طوارئ الأمم المتحدة محل القوات الإسرائيلية، ومصر استعادت السيطرة على الإدارة المدنية للشريط. وأعيد احتلال المدينة في حرب الستة أيام (5 يونيو 1967 - 10 يونيو 1967).\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي غزة وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nكانت مساحة المستوطنات الإسرائيلية في قطاع غزة تبلغ 155 كيلومترا مربعاً تقريباً، وبالنسبة للكتلة المحيطة بمدينة غزة، وهي الكتلة الشمالية، فتتوزع المستوطنات التي تتصل بإسرائيل عبر طرق عرضية تضمن لها سهولة الاتصال، تضم:\n\nمستوطنة إيرتز: (أنشئت عام 1968م) على الحدود الشمالية لقطاع غزة مباشرة.\nمستوطنة إيلي سيناي: تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر ملاصقة تماما لحدود قطاع غزة الشمالية، وهي مستوطنة زراعية أنشئت عام 1983 لاستيعاب عددا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء في أعقاب اتفاقية السلام المصرية ـ الإسرائيلية.\nمستوطنة نيسانيت: (أنشئت عام 1982م) على بعد 5 كم شرق البحر، وهي مستوطنة زراعية، أنشئت لتستوعب أعدادا من المستوطنين الذين تم إجلاؤهم من سيناء.\nمستوطنة نتساريم: أنشئت عام 1972 م لتقسم قطاع غزة إلى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي، فهي تقع على بعد 1 كم إلى الشرق من شاطئ البحر، وعلى بعد 1 كم إلى الغرب من الطريق الرئيس، وعلى بعد 4 كم جنوب غزة، ونظرا لاتساع مساحة هذه المستوطنة، وموقعها المتميز جنوبي مدينة غزة، والمشاكل الناجمة عن هذه المستوطنة، جعلت منها كتلة استيطانية قائمة بذاتها.\nفي ديسمبر 1987، انخرط سكان غزة مبكرًا في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى (انتفاضة الحجارة) وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع غزة مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. وأغلقت المدارس في مدينة غزة قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية قد انسحبت من قطاع غزة في 15 آب / أغسطس 2005 وذلك بقرار من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي أريئيل شارون بعد إنشاءها منذ 38 عاما، تم بعدها تفكيك 21 مستوطنة بقطاع غزة و4 مستوطنات بالضفة الغربية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nبقيت المدينة تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حتى عام 1994، حيث أنه في سبتمبر 1993، بعد مُفاوضات سرية، وقّع كل من رئيس وزراء إسرائيل إسحاق رابين ورئيس منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية ياسر عرفات اتفاقية إعلان مبادئ التي تقر انسحاب إسرائيل من قطاع غزة ومناطق أخرى، وتحويل إدارة الحكومة المحلية للفلسطينيين، وفي مايو 1994، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من المدينة ومن القطاع بشكل جزئي تاركة عدة مستوطنات لها تحت امرة الجيش الإسرائيلي في عمق القطاع، وتولت بموجب إتفاقية أوسلو السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية إدارة المدينة بعد أن كانت تتخذها قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي مقرًا لها أثناء احتلال قطاع غزة ما بين 1967 و1994، وأصبحت منطقة قطاع غزة جُزئيًا تحت حكم السلطة الفلسطينية، إلا أن قطاع غزة ظل فعليًا تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي إلى أن انسحبت إسرائيل بالكامل من أراضي قطاع غزة في 15 أغسطس 2005 بأوامر من رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي وقتها أريئيل شارون وأبقت على حصارها برًا وبحرًا وجوًا.\nبعد فوز حركة حماس بعدد كبير من مقاعد البرلمان الفلسطيني في الانتخابات اندلعت العديد من المناوشات المتفرقة بين عناصر من حركتي فتح وحماس ووصل الأمر ذروته في منتصف يونيو من عام 2007 حيث قامت حركة حماس بالسيطرة على كامل قطاع غزة والمؤسسات الأمنية والحكومية فيه.\n\nوفي نهاية عام 2008 وبداية عام 2009 وتحديدا بدءا من 27 ديسمبر 2008، بدأت إسرائيل حرب عدوانية شرسة على قطاع غزة بدأت بالقصف الجوي العنيف لجميع مقرات الشرطة الفلسطينية ثم تتالى القصف لمدة أسبوع للمنازل والمساجد وحتى المستشفيات وبعد أسبوع بدأت بالزحف البري إلى الأماكن المفتوحة في حملة عسكرية عدوانية غاشمة كان هدفها حسب ما أعلن قادة الاحتلال الصهيوني هو إنهاء حكم حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، والقضاء على المقاومة الفلسطينية لا سيما إطلاق الصواريخ محلية الصنع مثل صاروخ القسام أو صواريخ روسية أو صينية مثل صاروخ غراد التي وصل مداها خلال الحرب إلى 50 كم، واستُخدمت القوات الصهيونية الأسلحة والقذائف المحرمة دوليًا مثل القنابل الفسفورية المسرطنة والقنابل آجلة التفجير وغيرها.\nحاصرت القوات الإسرائيلية قطاع غزة، وقطعت عنها الكهرباء والوقود، وحرمت المرضى من الأدوية، ومنعت الدول العربية المُجاورة من إدخال الوقود إلى القطاع، وما زال الحصار مفروضًا على القطاع حتى الآن، وقد قتل كثير من الفلسطينيين من جراء الاشتباكات والتوغلات الإسرائيلية في القطاع، لا سيما حين قصفت مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزة بالصواريخ وتوغلت فيه.\nنزح كثير من الفلسطينيين إلى معبر رفح آملين أن يدخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية ليبحثوا عن السلام، لكن الإدارة المصرية منعت النازحين من الدخول إلى الأراضي المصرية، وقد كسر النازحون معبر رفح في شهر مارس ودخلوا إلى الأراضي المصرية وما زالوا يعانون من آثار الحصار إلى الآن.\nوتحاول منظمات إنسانية دولية كسر الحصار المفروض على غزة من خلال إرسال سفن بها عدد من النشطاء، محملة بالمساعدات الإنسانية، إلا أن إسرائيل تمنع وصول تلك السفن، ومن تلك المحاولات أسطول الحرية عام 2010،  وما تعرض له من هجوم عسكري إسرائيلي.\n\nفي نوفمبر 2012، أقدمت إسرائيل على الهجوم على غزة بقصف عشوائي استهدف في بادئ الأمر أحد قادة حماس، إلاّ إنه طال المدنيين بشكل رئيسي، ونتج عنه العشرات من الضحايا. وقد ردّت المقاومة الفلسطينية بشكل غير مسبوق عبر قصفها لمدن في العمق الإسرائيلي كتل أبيب، وهرتسيليا وبئر السبع بعشرات الصواريخ.\nفي صيف 2014، شنت إسرائيل حربًا أخرى على غزة، فبدءا من يوم 8 يوليو 2014 بدأ الجيش الإسرائيلي عملية الجرف الصامد وردت كتائب عز الدين القسام بمعركة العصف المأكول  وردت حركة الجهاد الإسلامي بعملية البنيان المرصوص وذلك بعد موجة عنف تفجرت مع خطف وتعذيب وحرق الطفل محمد أبو خضير من شعفاط على أيدي مجموعة مستوطنين في 2 يوليو 2014،، وإعادة اعتقال العشرات من محرري صفقة شاليط، وأعقبها احتجاجات واسعة في القدس وداخل عرب 48 وكذلك مناطق الضفة الغربية، واشتدت وتيرتها بعد أن دهس إسرائيلي اثنين من العمال العرب قرب حيفا، وتخلل التصعيد قصف متبادل بين إسرائيل والمقاومة الفلسطينية في قطاع غزة. تخلل هذه الحرب عدة عمليات عسكرية مثل عملية ناحل عوز وعملية العاشر من رمضان.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيقع وسط غزة على تلة بارتفاع 45 قدما (14 متر) فوق مستوى البحر. بُنيت جزء كبير من المدينة الحديثة على طول السهل أسفل التل، وخصوصا في الشمال والشرق، وتشكّل ضواحي غزة. يقع كل من شاطئ وميناء غزة على بعد 3 كم (1,9 ميل) عن مركز مدينة غزة. تبعد مدينة غزة 78 كيلومترًا (48 ميل) إلى الجنوب الغربي من القدس، و 71 كيلومترًا (44 ميل) جنوب تل أبيب،  وعلى بعد 30 كيلومترًا (19 ميل) شمال مدينة رفح. مواقع محيطة تشمل بيت لاهيا وبيت حانون، وجباليا إلى الشمال، وقرية أبو مدين، ومخيم البريج ومخيم النصيرات ومدينة دير البلح إلى الجنوب.\nتبلغ مساحة الأراضي التابعة للبلدية ما يُقارب 45 كم مربع (17 ميل مربع). في الانتداب البريطاني، شكلت المناطق الحضرية (المبنية) ما يقارب 7,960 كيلو متر مربع (3070 ميل مربع) أما المناطق الريفية شكلت 143,063 كيلو متر مربع (55,237 ميل مربع). بلغت مساحة الأراضي المروية 24,040 كم مربع (9,280 ميل مربع) والأراضي المزروعة بالحبوب حيث بلغت مساحتها 117,899 كم مربع (45,521 ميل مربع).\n\nيعتمد سكان غزة على المياه الجوفية كمصدر وحيد للشرب والاستخدام الزراعي والمنزلي. يعد وادي غزة أقرب جدول مائي جنوبا. والذي يحتوي على كمية قليلة من الماء في الشتاء أما صيفا فيكاد لا يحتوي على ماء. يتم تحويل معظم إمدادات المياه فيها إلى إسرائيل. المياه الجوفية على طول ساحل قطاع غزة هو الخزان الرئيسي للماء في قطاع غزة وتتكون معظمها من الحجر الرملي العصر الجليدي. مثل معظم قطاع غزة، مغطى غزة بتراب رباعي.\nالمعادن الطينية في التربة تمتص الكثير من المواد الكيميائية العضوية وغير العضوية والتي قد خففت جزئيًا مدى تلوث المياه الجوفية. تلة معروفة في جنوب شرق غزة تسمى (المنطار) وهو ذات ارتفاع 270 قدم (82 م) فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتشكل البلدة القديمة جزء رئيسي من نواة غزة. وتتكون من حي الدرج في الشمال (المعروف أيضًا باسم الحي مسلم) وحي الزيتون في الجنوب. تعود مُعظم المباني إلى العصر المملوكي أو العصر العثماني وبُنيت على بعض المباني القديمة. وتبلغ مساحة البلدة القديمة حوالي 1,6 كيلومتر مربع (0.62 ميل مربع). تتكون غزة من 11 حي، يقع حي الدرج وحي الصبرة ما بين حي الرمال والبلدة القديمة.\n\nحي الشجاعية: من أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، وينقسم إلى قسمين الشجاعية الجنوبية (التركمان) والشجاعية الشمالية (الجديدة)، بُنى خلال عهد الأيوبيين، يسكنه أكثر من 300 ألف نسمة، ويعمل معظم سكانه بصناعات خفيفة مثل الخياطة والزراعة وغيرها كما أنه يمتاز بأنه منطقة تجارية فيها كل الأشكال التجارية والورش، به مقبرتان القديمة، ومقبرة الشهداء، وبه أكبر منطقة صناعية في غزة، وبه معبر المنطار التجاري. وقد شهد هذا الحي العديد من الاجتياحات الإسرائيلية.\nحي التفاح: تعود هذه التسمية لكثرة أشجار التفاح التي كانت تنتشر في هذا الحي وهو من الأحياء القديمة بمدينة غزة.\nحي الرمال: ويعتبر من أرقى أحياء مدينة غزة وأكبرها مساحة بُني في ثلاثينيات وأربعينيات القرن 20، وينقسم إلي الرمال الشمالي والجنوبي. ويمتد الشمالي منه من بداية حي الشيخ رضوان (الشارع الأول) إلى شارع المختار والرمال الجنوبي من شارع عمر المختار إلى بداية حي تل الهوى.\nحي النصر: سُمي الحي بالنصر احترامًا للجمال عبد الناصر الذي بُني في خمسينيات القرن 20.\nحي الزيتون: سمي بذلك لكثرة أشجار الزيتون المزروعة فيه، ولكن تم اقتلاع وتجريف الكثير منها خلال انتفاضة الأقصى وبخاصة في الحرب الأخيرة من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي على قطاع غزة بتاريخ 27/12/2008 م، ويعتبر حي الزيتون أحد أكبر أحياء مدينة غزة، حيث يقطنه أكثر من 100 ألف نسمة.\nحي الدرج: وكان يسمى سابقاً «حي بني عامر» نسبة لقبيلة بني عامر العربية التي سكنته مع بداية الفتح الإسلامي ثم حي«البرجلية» نسبة للمحاربين المدافعين عن أبراج المدينة في العصر المملوكي.\nحي الصبرة: من أحياء غزة القديمة نسبيًا ويقع بعد شارع الثلاثيني.\nحي الشيخ رضوان: يمتد من الشارع الأول إلى الشارع الثالث شمالاً ومن شارع النصر غرباً ومن قرية جباليا النزلة شرقاً ويقع الحي على بعد 3 كيلومتر (1.9 ميل) شمال البلدة القديمة.\nحي تل الهوى: وهو أحد الأحياء الجديدة وبرزت فيه العمارة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية إلى غزة حيث أقيمت أغلب المؤسسات الحكومية في هذا الحي، وعند قدوم حكومة حركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس عن طريق الانتخابات قامت بتسميته بتل الإسلام، لكن لم تنجح في ذلك، وبقي الناس ينادوه بتل الهوى.\nحي الشيخ عجلين: هو حي يقع في جنوب مدينة غزة بالقرب من الطريق الساحلي. في 18 نوفمبر 2002، هاجمت قوات الدفاع الإسرائيلية الحي، ودمّرت مكاتب جهاز الأمن الوقائي التابع للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nحي الدرج\nالمخيمات\n\nمخيم جباليا: يقع شمال مدينة غزة ويعتبر أكبر المخيمات ولكنه يتبع لمحافظة شمال غزة وليس لمحافظة غزة.\nمخيم الشاطئ: يقع غرب المدينة مقابلاً للساحل.\nمخيم النصيرات: يقع على بعد 8 كم جنوب مدينة غزة وعلى بعد 6 كم شمال بلدة دير البلح ويقع المخيم في وسط قطاع غزة\n\nالمناخ\nتمتاز غزة بمناخ متوسطي وشتاء معتدل جاف، والصيف حار ساخن. يبدأ فصل الربيع في شهر مارس أبريل وأكثر الشهور حرارة يوليو وأغسطس. أما متوسط ارتفاع درجات الحرارة يبلغ 33 سلسيوس (91 درجة فهرنهايت). ويعد شهر يناير أبرد شهور السنة متوسط الدرجات الحرارة المنخفضة يبلغ 7 سلسيوس (45 درجة فهرنهايت). الأمطار شحيحة وتهطل بين شهري نوفمبر ومارس، ويبلغ معدل الأمطار السنوية قرابة (116 ملم). وتهب الرياح على المدينة من الناحية الجنوبية الغربية. يصل أعلى معدل لسرعة الرياح في الشتاء إلى 60 كم في الساعة (نحو 7.3 عقدة/ساعة)، وأعلى سرعة للرياح في كامل السنة هي في شهر يناير بنحو 7.6 عقدة/ساعة، وقد ترجع هذه السرعة إلى مرور المنخفضات الجوية التي عادة ما تصاحبها رياح شديدة. تبلغ سرعة الرياح أدنى معدلاتها في فصل الصيف، فيبلغ المتوسط الفصلي حوالي 5 عقدة/ساعة، وينخفض متوسط سرعة الرياح في فصل الربيع عما هو في فصل الشتاء ليبلغ 6.7 عقدة/ساعة، وتقل سرعة الرياح في الخريف عن فصل الشتاء والربيع بينما تزيد عن فصل الصيف إذ تبلغ 5.6 عقدة/ساعة.\n\nالسكان\nوفقا للإحصاءات العثمانية في عام 1557، كان عدد الذكور 2477. حسب الإحصائيات عام 1596 أظهرت أن عدد المسلمين كان كالتالي (456 أسرة، 115 عزاب، 59 شخص ديني و19 شخص من ذو الاحتياجات الخاصة). أضف إلى أعداد المسلمين، كان عدد الجنود العثمانيون 119 جندي. أما المسيحين كان عدد الأسر 294 أسرة و7 أشخاص عزاب، بينما كان عدد الأسر اليهودية ما يقارب 73 أسرة و8 أسر من السامريون. في المجموع، بلغ عدد سكان غزة 6,000 نسمة وكانت في المركز الثالث كبراً من حيث عدد السكان في فلسطين العثمانية بعد القدس وصفد.\nفي عام 1838، كان عدد المسلمين 4,000 نسمة و 100 من المسيحيين (دافعين للضرائب مقابل حمايتهم) وبالتالي بلغ عدد السكان النهائي 15,000 أو 16,000 نسمة وأصبحت أكبر من القدس من حيث عدد السكان في ذلك الوقت. العدد الكامل للأسر المسيحية بلغ 57 أسرة. قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى بلغ عدد سكان غزة حوالي 42,000 نسمة، وأدى القتال ما بين القوات العثمانية والألمانية وقوات التحالف إلى انخفاض أعداد سكان غزة.\nحسب الإحصائيات عام 1997، من قبل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني بلغ عدد سكان غزة مع مخيم الشاطئ 353,115 منهم 50,9% ذكور و49,1% إناث. تمتاز غزة بكثرة الشباب بنسبة 60,8% وتتراوح أعمارهم ما بين (0-19 سنة). 28,8% من السكان تتراوح أعمارهم (20-44 سنة)، 7,7% ما بين (45-64 سنة)، وبلغت نسبة الذين تجاوزت أعمارهم 64 عام 3,9%.\nبلغ عدد سكان غزة 590,400 نسمة. سكان مدينة غزة وفلسطين عامة ينحدرون من أصول سامية، وكجميع سكان البحر الأبيض المتوسط لهم ملامح عربية سمراء ومتنوعة لا تخلو من تأثيرات متوسطية.\nفي سنتي 2023 و2024 مارست قوت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي قصفا مباشرا على السكان المدنيين حيث قتلت ما يزيد عن 40 ألف فلسطيني جلهم نساء وأطفال من سكان غزة\n\nالدين\nينتمي معظم سكان غزة إلى الدين الإسلامي السني. عندما كانت غزة تتبع الدولة الفاطمية، كان الشيعة مسيطرين على غزة، ولكن بعدما استرجعها القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي رقي بالنهج السني بصرامة دينية وتعليمية، مما كان له دور في توحيد جنوده العربي والترك.\nتوجد أقلية صغيرة من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين حوالي 3,500 نسمة تعيش في المدينة. وغالبية من المسيحيين تعيش في غزة في حي الزيتون في المدينة القديمة، وينتمون إلى الأرثوذكسية الشرقية من القدس، والروم الكاثوليك، والطوائف المعمدانية. في عام 1906، لم يكن هناك سوى 750 مسيحي، منهم 700 شخص يتبعون الأرثوذكسية و50 يتبعون الكنيسة الرومانية الكاثوليكية.\nاستوطن اليهود غزة منذ زمن،  في أسرة يهودية تعيش في غزة  غادر معظمهم من قطاع غزة بعد الثورة الفلسطينية 1929، حينما تكون مجتمعهم من خمسين أسرة. في إحصائيات سامي هداوي للأراضي والسكان، كان عدد سكان غزة 34,250 نسمة، في عام 1945. غادر معظمهم من المدينة بعد حرب عام 1948، وذلك بسبب انعدام الثقة المتبادلة بينهم وبين الأغلبية العربية.\nتحتوي غزة على العديد من مباني العبادة القديمة من أبرزها الجامع العمري، كنيسة القديس برفيريوس ومسجد السيد هاشم حيث يرقد قبر جد الرسول محمد.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت المدينة ولا زالت مركزًا مُهمًا من حيث موقعها الإستراتيجي بين القارتين الآسيوية والإفريقية ووقوعها على شاطئ البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذي يجعل منها ميناء مهما للتجارة وأعمال الصيد، ولكن صعوبة نقل البضائع عبر المعابر مع إسرائيل وعدم سلاسة النقل مع مصر يجعل حجم التبادل التجاري ضئيلًا مع الحجم المفترض بسبب الموقع الجغرافي. نما الاقتصاد في غزة بنسبة 8% في الأشهر ال 11 الأولى من عام 2010، وبنسبة 5.4% في عام 2009، والنشاط الاقتصادي مدعوم إلى حد كبير من خلال التبرعات والمساعدات الخارجية، والذي يعتبر السبب الرئيسي وراء النمو الذي حدث مؤخرا. غزة مثلها كمثل أي مدينة فلسطينية لا تملك عملة وطنية، ويُستخدم الدينار الأردني والدولار الأمريكي والشيكل الإسرائيلي. ويبلغ معدل الناتج المحلي للفرد 1,763 دولار أمريكي (طبـقًا لإحصائية 1997).\nبعد إتفاق أوسلو، تم توظيف الآلاف من السكان في مختلف الوزارات والأجهزة الأمنية، في حين قامت وكالة الغوث والمنظمات الدولية المختلفة التي تدعم تطوير المدينة بتوظيف آخرين.\nيوجد في غزة نقص خطير في مجال الإسكان والمرافق التعليمية والمرافق الصحية والبنية التحتية وعدم كفاية نظام الصرف الصحي، وقد ساهمت كل منها بتهديد النظافة وإنشاء مشاكل في الصحة العامة. هُناك عدد من الفنادق في غزة، مثل فندق فلسطين والقصر الكبير وآدم والأمل والقدس وكليف والديرة وبيت مارنا. تقع الفنادق على طول حي الرمال باستثناء فندق فلسطين. لدى الأمم المتحدة نادي الشاطئ في الشارع نفسه. غزة ليست مقصد للسُياح، مُعظم الأجانب يقيمون في الفنادق وهم صحفيين وعمال الإغاثة والأمم المتحدة والعاملين في الصليب الأحمر. الفنادق الراقية تشمل فندق القدس والديرة.\nووفقًا لتقرير صدر مؤخرًا عن منظمة أوكسفام، تبلغ نسبة البطالة في غزة ما يقارب 40% ومن المُتوقع أن تصل إلى 50%. وقد دُمر القطاع الخاص الذي يؤمن بدوره 53% من جميع الوظائف في غزة، وقد أفلست الشركات، بالإضافة إلى أن 75,000 عامل من أصل 110,000 هم الآن من دون وظيفة. في عام 2008، تم تعليق 95% من العمليات الصناعية في غزة بسبب عدم وجود المواد الخام للإنتاج وعدم القُدرة على تصدير ما يُنتج. في يونيو 2005، بلغ عدد المصانع في غزة 3,900 مصنع التي تُوظف 35,000 شخص، ولكن بحلول ديسمبر 2007، لم يبقَ سوى 195 مصنعًا التي تُوظف 1,700 شخص. أُصيبت صناعة البناء والتشييد بالشلل مع عشرات الآلاف من العاطلين عن العمل. كما أُصيب القطاع الزراعي بأضرارًا جسيمة وقرابة 40,000 عاملًا لا يحصلون على أي دخل وكانوا يعتمدون على الزراعة كمحصول نقدي.\nفي أغسطس 2009، وعدت حماس كل عامل ب100 دولار في شهر رمضان الكريم. أدى زيادة الازدهار نوعًا ما إلى استبدال واسع للعربات التي تجرها الحمير بالتوك توك. ووفقًا لصندوق النقد الدولي، انخفض معدل البطالة ونما الاقتصاد بنسبة 16% في النصف الأول من عام 2010، تقريبًا ضعف سرعة نمو الاقتصاد في الضفة الغربية.\n الزراعة \n\nاشتهرت غزة قديماً بزراعة محاصيل القمح والشعير والقطن والزيتون. وتصديرها إلى العالم العربي والخارجي، وفي غزة الآن العديد من المزروعات وهي: البطاطا، والطماطم، والخيار، والعنب، والفراولة، والتين، والبطيخ، والشمام. وانتشرت فيها البيارات التي تزرع فيها أجود أنواع الحمضيات كالليمون والبرتقال، والتي يعتمد البعض عليها في تغذية النحل.\nويعتمد الري في مدينة غزة على مياه الآبار، ويجري حالياً دراسات لتحلية مياه البحر تقوم بها البلديات في قطاع غزة. كما يعتمد الاقتصاد في غزة بدرجة كبيرة على زراعة وتصدير الأزهار إلى مختلف دول العالم.\nويربي بعض سكان القطاع حالياً الأغنام والماشية، ويعتمدون عليها في تسيير أمور حياتهم، والتي تسهم كذلك في بعض الصناعات المحلية الخفيفة؛ فقد ساهمت بلدية غزة بإنشاء مسلخ حديث ومتطور يتبع أحدث القوانين الصحية والعملية ويعمل أوتوماتيكياً حسب أحدث النظم والأساليب في العالم، ويعتبر من أكثر المسالخ تطوراً في الشرق الأوسط.\n الصناعة \nتشتهر غزة بصناعة عصر الزيتون والصابون الذي يعتمد على الزيت كمادة أولية كما تعتبر صناعة الفخار من أقدم الصناعات الفلسطينية التي اشتهرت بها المدينة والتي تُباع في شوارع أسواق غزة، وكذلك صناعة الغزل والتطريز والبسط التراثية من صوف الماشية والنسيج والملابس القطنية والأثاث المصنوع من الخيزران وصناعة الزجاج الملون كذلك. فقد تم إنشاء قرية الفنون والحرف التي بُنِيَت من الطين على الطراز المعماري القديم، ويمارس عد من الحرفيين الصناعة التقليدية في تلك القرية. وافتُتَح مول غزة الحديث في يوليو 2010.\n\nالسياحة\nتعتمد السياحة في غزة بشكل رئيسي على البحر الذي تشتهر شواطئه برمالها الذهبية البراقة. كما وتعتمد السياحة كذلك على المواقع الأثرية التاريخية المنتشرة في غزة. وتشتهر غزة كذلك بجوها المعتدل صيفاً وشتاءً والذي يشجع الناس بدوره، على ارتياد الشواطئ والحدائق والمنتزهات وعلى قضاء أوقاتهم في المزارع والبيارات وفي المرافق السياحية.\nتضم غزة العديد من الآثار منها الرومانية والمسيحية، وتتنوع الآثار الإسلامية بين المساجد والمدارس والزوايا والأسواق والقيساريات والأسبلة والحمامات والقصور التي تجلت فيها روعة العمارة والفنون الإسلامية، علاوة على مكتبة مهمة احتوت على عديد من المخطوطات.\nإن أقدم المواقع الأثرية بغزة تل العجول بجنوب المدينة على الضفة الشمالية لوادى غزة، وكان على هذا الموقع مدينة بيت جلايم الكنعانية، ويعتقد أن موقع مدينة غزة القديمة كانت على هذا التل منذ 2000 ق.م. وتضم غزة آثاراً مسيحية مثل دير القديس هيلاريون الذي يعتبر مؤسس حياة الرهبنة في فلسطين وكنيسة الروم الأرثوذكس بحى الزيتون الذي يعود تاريخها إلى بداية القرن الخامس الميلادي وآثاراً إسلامية متنوعة منها المساجد الأثرية كمسجد السيد هاشم الذي يقع بحى الدرج بالمنطقة الشمالية الذي يعود للعصر المملوكي، وجدده السلطان عبد الحميد سنة 1850 م. وتحوى غزة زوايا كالزاوية الأحمدية بحي الدرج، علاوة على المنشآت الأثرية المدنية كالأسواق مثل سوق القيسارية بحى الدرج، وهو ملاصق للجدار الجنوبي للجامع العمرى الكبير، ويعود بناء السوق إلى العصر المملوكي، ويتكون من شارع مغطى بقبو مدبب، وعلى جانبي هذا الشارع حوانيت صغيرة مغطاة بأقبية متقاطعة يطلق عليه سوق القيسارية أو سوق الذهب نسبة إلى تجارة الذهب فيه، والقصور مثل قصر الباشا بحي الدرج المكون من طابقين، ويعود للعصر المملوكي وكان مقراً لنائب غزة في العصرين المملوكي والعثماني، والحمامات كحمام السمرة بحي الزيتون، وهو أحد النماذج الرائعة الباقية للحمامات العثمانية في فلسطين والحمام الوحيد الباقي لغاية الآن في مدينة غزة.\nوكذلك تل الرقيش الذي اكتُشف فيه مستعمرة تعود للعهد الفينيقي في هذا التل تحيطها أسوار دفاعية ضخمة ويبلغ طولها حوالي (1600م).\n\nالثقافة\nالأزياء والتطريز \nتعتبر غزة الموطن الأصلي الشاش، القماش من أجل «ثوب غزة» يتم نسجه بالقرب من المجدل (عسقلان). القطن الأسود أو الأزرق أو المقلمة باللونان الزهري والأخضر، والتي تم تصنيعها في المجدل استمرت بالانتشار في باقي مناطق قطاع غزة من قبل اللاجئين من قرى السهل الساحلي حتى التسعينيات. يتميز الثوب الغزاوي بأكمام ضيقة ومستقيمة. وكان التطريز أقل كثافة من تلك المطبقة في الخليل. ومن الزخرفيات تشمل: مقص، مشط وحجاب والتي رتبت في كثير من الأحيان في مجموعات ثلاثية أو خماسية أو سباعية. ويعتبر استخدام الأرقام الفردية في الفولكلور العربي أن يكون فعالا ضد العين الحسود.\n المطبخ \nوقد تأثر المطبخ في قطاع غزة بالأكلات المجاورة حيث تأثرت بمصر بفضل موقعها على ساحل البحر المتوسط. الغذاء الرئيسي للغالبية العظمى من سكان في المنطقة هو السمك. الصناعة الرئيسية بغزة هي صيد الأسماك إما ان تكون مشوية أو مقلية، وتتسم الأطعمة هناك بإضافة الثوم والفلفل الأحمر والكمون ويتم نقعه في مزيج من الكزبرة، الفلفل الأحمر، كمون، ثوم مفروم والليمون. التأثير المصري يظهر أيضا على جانب الاستخدام المُتكرر للفلفل الحار والثوم والشوندرة نكهة لكثير من وجبات الطعام من قطاع غزة. الطبق الوطني لمنطقة غزة هو سماكية.\nالمراكز الثقافية والمتاحف\n\nتوجد في غزة عدة مراكز ثقافية منها مركز رشاد الشوا. تم الانتهاء من بناء مركز رشاد الشوا الثقافي في عام 1988 وأطلق عليه اسم مؤسسه الأمين السابق للمدينة ويقع في حي الرمال. البناء مكون من طابقان على شكل مثلث وتؤدي المراكز الثقافية ثلاثة وظائف رئيسية: مكان للتجمعات الكبيرة خلال المهرجانات السنوية ومكان لتنظيم المعارض ومكتبة. المركز الثقافي الفرنسي هو رمز للتعاون والشراكة في قطاع غزة. تقدم المعارض الفنية والحفلات الموسيقية وعروض الأفلام وغيرها من الأنشطة. ويقدم دعوات للفنانين الفرنسيين لعرض أعمالهم الفنية كلما أمكن ذلك، ويقدم دعوات أيضًا إلى الفنانين الفلسطينيين من قطاع غزة والضفة الغربية للمشاركة في المسابقات الفنية.\nأنشئت في عام 1998 قرية الفنون والحرف وهي مركز ثقافي للأطفال التي تهدف إلى التشجيع الشامل والمنتظم للفن الإبداعي في جميع أشكاله. وتفاعل المركز مع فئة واسعة من الفنانين من جنسيات مختلفة، ونظم قرابة 100 معرض للفن الإبداعي، والسيراميك، والرسومات، والمنحوتات وغيرها. وقد استفاد ما يقرب 10,000 طفل من مختلف أنحاء قطاع غزة من قرية الفنون والحرف.\n\nالرياضة\nيقع ملعب فلسطين «الاستاد الوطني الفلسطيني»، في غزة ولديه القدرة على استيعاب 10,000 شخصًا. وهو بمثابة موطن للمنتخب الفلسطيني لكرة القدم، ولكن بعد غارة جوية إسرائيلية تضرر بشدة ميدان الملعب، وقد لعبت مبارياته في الدوحة، قطر. تملك غزة الكثير من الأندية الرياضية والتي تشارك في دوري قطاع غزة. وتشمل خدمات الشاطئ (مخيم الشاطئ)، اتحاد الشجاعية، نادي غزة الرياضي ونادي الزيتون.\n\nالتعليم\nوفقًا للإحصاء الفلسطيني في عام 1997، كان أكثر من 90% من سكان غزة الذين تزيد أعمارهم على 10 يجيدون القراءة والكتابة. من سكان المدينة، كانوا 140,848 مسجلين في المدارس (39.8% في المدارس الابتدائية، 33.8% في المدارس الثانوية، و 26.4% في المدارس الثانوية العامة). تلقى نحو 11,134 شخص شهادات البكالوريوس أو الماجستير والدكتوراه.\nفي عام 2006، كان عدد المدارس في غزة 210، وتم تشغيل وبناء 151 منها من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية، و 46 من قبل وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين في الشرق الأدنى، و 13 مدرسة خاصة. التحق ما مجموعه 154,251 طالب وكانوا 5,877 يعملون مدرسين. أثر الاقتصاد المضطهد في الوقت الحالي في قطاع غزة. في سبتمبر 2007، كشف استطلاع للأونروا في قطاع غزة، أن الفشل ينتشر بنسبة 80% من الصف الرابع إلى التاسع، وتصل نسبة الفشل في مادة الرياضيات إلى 90%. في يناير 2008، أفادت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (يونيسف) أن المدارس في غزة قامت بإلغاء الفئات التي كانت عالية في استهلاك الطاقة، مثل تكنولوجيا المعلومات، ومختبرات العلوم والأنشطة اللاصفية.\nيوجد في مدينة غزة عدة جامعات وهي: الجامعة الإسلامية-غزة، جامعة الأزهر-غزة، جامعة الأقصى-غزة (كلية التربية سابقا)، جامعة فلسطين وجامعة الأمة وجامعة القدس المفتوحة وهي تعتمد نظام التعليم المفتوح وتضم حوالي 40,000 طالباً. تأسست الجامعة الإسلامية، التي تتألف من عشرة كليات، من قبل أحمد ياسين ومجموعة من رجال الأعمال في عام 1978، مما يجعلها أول مؤسسة للتعليم العالي في قطاع غزة. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 20,021 طالب وطالبة. جامعة الأزهر في غزة والتي تأسست عام 1991، وتأسست جامعة الأقصى في عام 1991. بدأت جامعة القدس المفتوحة تعليمها في مبنى مستأجر في وسط المدينة وكان ذلك عام 1992 وكان عدد الملتحقين بها 730 طالب وطالبة. بسبب الزيادة السريعة في عدد الطلاب، تم تشيد أول مبنى جامعي في منطقة ناصر. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 3,778 طالب.\nوتقع المكتبة العامة في قطاع غزة قبالة شارع الوحدة، وتحتوي على ما يقارب 10,000 كتابًا في العربية والإنكليزية والفرنسية. ويبلغ مجموع مساحتها حوالي 1410 متر مربع (15,200 قدم مربعة)، ويتكون المبنى من دورين وسرداب. افتتحت المكتبة في عام 1999، بعد تعاون رئيس بلدية غزة عون الشوا وبلدية دونكيرك، والبنك الدولي. الأهداف الرئيسية للمكتبة تتمثل بتوفير مصادر المعلومات لتلبية احتياجات المستفيدين، وتوفير التسهيلات اللازمة من أجل الوصول إلى مصادر المعلومات المتاحة، وتنظيم برامج ثقافية متنوعة مثل النشاطات الثقافية والندوات والمحاضرات والعروض السينمائية والفيديو والفن ومعارض للكتب. وكذلك يوجد بها العديد من المراكز المهنية والتدريبية التابعة لوزارة التعليم العالي ووكالة الغوث.\n\nمشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة\nهناك العديد من المشاكل التي تواجه التعليم في قطاع غزة متمثلة في الاتي:\n- الاكتظاظ الطلابي الكبير في الفصول الدراسية نتيجة لازدياد عدد الطلاب وقلة عدد المدارس. حيث أدت الحروب المتتالية الي تدمير المدارس، وادي الحصار الخانق الي صعوبة إعادة اعمارها\n- تعتبر المعابر من المشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزة. حيث استمرار اغلاق المعابر لفترات طويلة يؤدي الي صعوبة التنقل للخارج واستكمال الدراسة\n- من المشاكل الأخرى التي تؤثر سلبا على التعليم مشكلة التيار الكهربائي. حيث ادي الانقطاع المستمر للتيار الكهربائي بمعدل 8 ساعات يوميا الي صعوبة مواكبة الطلاب دراستهم وواجباتهم اليومية.\n\nالمعالم\nالبنية التحتية\nالخدمات\nإمدادات المياه والصرف الصحي\nووفقًا لتعداد المكتب المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني عام 1997، فقد كان 98,1% من سكان غزة يملُكون إمدادات المياه العامة في حين أن البقية يستخدمون النظام الخاص. تم ربط حوالي 87.6% إلى نظام الصرف الصحي العام و 11.8% يستخدمون البالوعة.\nبسبب القيود الشديدة التي فُرضت على إمدادات المياه في غزة، ونظام الصرف بها. لم تعد تعمل الآبار الستة الرئيسية لمياه الشرب، وحوالي 50% من السكان لا يحصُلون على المياه بشكل منتظم. يتسرب يوميًا حوالي 20 مليون لتر من مياه الصرف الصحي الخام و40 مليون لتر من المياه المعالجة جُزئيًا في البحر الأبيض المتوسط نظرًا لقطع الكهرباء وعدم وجود الوقود وقطع الغيار في محطات المعالجة في قطاع غزة. وتزعم البلدية أن تراكم القمامة في الشوارع والطرق وفي الآبار، وفيضانات مياه الصرف الصحي في تتسبب خطر تفشي الأمراض والأوبئة الحشرية، وكذلك الفئران وفي المناطق السكنية.\nالرعاية الصحية\n\nتوجد في المدنية عدة مشافي منها مستشفى القدس، والذي يقع في حي تل الهوى، ويديرُه جمعية الهلال الأحمر الفلسطيني، ويعد ثاني أكبر مستشفى في غزة.\nونتيجة القيود الصارمة على الوقود والكهرباء؛ تُعاني المستشفيات حاليًا من انقطاع التيار الكهربائي الدائم الذي يصل إلى 8-12 ساعة يوميًا. يُوجد حاليًا نقص 60-70 في المئة في وقود الديزل اللازم لمولدات الكهرباء التي أُبلغ عنها. ووفقًا لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، تم رفض تصاريح مغادرة 18.5% من المرضى الذين قدموا تصاريح لكي يتلقوا العلاج الطارئ في المستشفيات خارج قطاع غزة في عام 2007.\nالنقل والمواصلات\n\nيمتد شارع رشيد الساحلي والذي يمتد على طول ساحل غزة ويربطها مع بقية الساحل الشمالي في قطاع غزة ومع جنوبه. الطريق الرئيسي في قطاع غزة، هو شارع صلاح الدين (فيا ماريس الحديثة) والذي يمر عبر وسط مدينة غزة، والذي يربط بدوره دير البلح وخان يونس ورفح في جنوب القطاع وجباليا وبيت حانون في شمال قطاع غزة. المعبر الشمالي من شارع صلاح الدين في إسرائيل هو معبر بيت حانون ومعبر من مصر هو معبر رفح. وقد تم إغلاق المعابر من قبل إسرائيل ومصر منذ عام 2007، ولكن بعد الثورة المصرية قد تم إعادة فتح معبر رفح ولن دون تغيرات تذكر.\nيعتبر شارع عمر المختار الشارع الرئيسي في مدينة غزة للتنقل من الشرق إلى الغرب وبالعكس، وهو فرع من شارع صلاح الدين، والذي يمتد من ساحل الرمال في المدينة القديمة وينتهي في سوق الذهب. وقبل الحصار المفروض على قطاع غزة، كان هناك خطوط منتظمة لسيارات الأجرة نحو مدينتان رام الله، القدس والخليل في الضفة الغربية.\nمطار ياسر عرفات الدولي والذي تم افتتاحه عام 1998 بالقرب من مدينة رفح، ويقع على بعد 40 كم (25 ميل) جنوب قطاع غزة. تضررت المدارجات والمنشآت التابعة للمطار إلى حد كبير خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية على يد الجيش الإسرائيلي وهو معطل عن العمل حالياً. يقع مطار بن غوريون الدولي في إسرائيل على بعد 75 كم (47 ميل) شمال شرق المدينة.، وبطبيعة الحال لا يمكن استخدامه من قبل المواطنين الفلسطينيين.\n\nمعاناة المدينة\nالحصار\n\nتقوم السلطات الإسرائيلية بحصار قطاع غزة وبالتالي المدينة حصاراً كاملاً حيث تمنع السفر من وإلى غزة وتمنع عنها مواد البناء والمواد التموينية والأدوية والمحروقات بأنواعها، وقد دمر هذا الحصار الاقتصاد الغزاوي بشكل شبه كامل. وفي أوائل سنة 2009 بدأت إسرائيل في ضرب قطاع غزة كاملاً. وقد زعمت إسرائيل بأن حماس تهدد أمنها وسكانها.\nولكن الشعب الفلسطيني ولم يستسلم وإنما بادر بشق الأنفاق عند حدود الأراضي المصرية، وساعدت هذه الأنفاق بدخول جميع مستلزمات الحياة من مواد غذائية ومواد بناء وأسلحة وأجهزة كهربائية والسيارات. وبعد عام من شن إسرائيل الحرب على غزة قاموا بعقد عدة اتفاقيات وتهدئات ساهمت بتهدئة الوضع في قطاع غزة وفتح معبر رفح والسماح للمُسافرين بالدخول والخروج من المدينة ولكن بتنسيق من حُكومة حماس المُقالة والسلطة المصرية.\nما زال المواطن الفلسطيني يعاني من أزمة الغلاء المعيشي بالإضافة للمعونات التي تقدم للمواطنين فهي تقدم فقط لعائلات معينة وليس للجميع. ومع ذلك فإن سكان قطاع غزة يعيشون في نعيم أكثر من الضفة الغربية باستثناء تواصل انقطاع التيار الكهربائي بحجة عدم وجود الوقود.\nمجزرة غزة\n\nمجزرة غزة أو محرقة غزة هي عملية إسرائيلية جرت في قطاع غزة على مدار خمسة أيام في شهر فبراير 2008 بدعوى القضاء على عناصر حركة حماس المطلقة للصواريخ على الأراضي الإسرائيلية. وقد جاءت هذه التسمية بعد أن وصف وزير الدفاع الإسرائيلي إيهود باراك ما تفعله القوات الإسرائيلية في غزة بهولوكوست أو إبادة عرقية أو محرقة للفلسطينيين في قطاع غزة إثر مقتل جنديين إسرائيليين على يد عناصر من حركة حماس أثناء مقاوماتها للقوات الإسرائيلية؛ فتبنى التسمية عدد كبير من الكتاب والمفكرين والشخصيات السياسية والدينية العرب والمسلمين، حيث يرونها اسم مناسب للعملية، حيث راح ضحيتها 116 شخص من ضمنهم 26 طفلاً فضلاً عن غيرهم من المدنيين ما بين قتيل وجريح. وفي نفس اليوم الذي أعلنت فيه انتهاء العمليات العسكرية في غزة؛ أعلنت مصادر إسرائيلية أنها كانت مرحلة أولى، وأنه قد تكون هناك عمليات أخرى في القريب.\nالعدوان شنته قوات الاحتلال منذ يوم 27 ديسمبر 2008 على قطاع غزة. وقد ذهب ضحية لهذا العدوان حتى اليوم العشرون ما يزيد على 5,000 مدني شهيد اكثرهم من النساء والأطفال وما يقارب الـ 8,000 جريح من المدنيين، ومعظم الجرحى أصبحوا عاجزين أما أهل غزة فقد ظلوا صابرين يواجهون أكبر ترسانة عسكرية بصُدور عارية وقُلوب ثابتة في مواجهة 10,000 طن من القنابل ألقُيت عليهم ومنها قنابل محرمة دوليًا.\nوقد شهدت فترة العدوان أكبر انتفاضة عالمية ضد المجزرة التي ترتكبها إسرائيل ضد أطفال ونساء وعجائز غزة، حيث عرضت وسائل الاعلام صوراً بشعة من غزة هزت العالم فنزلت الشعوب بمئات الألوف تبكي في الشوارع وتطالب بالتحرك لوقف العدوان والجرائم والمحارق والقنابل الإسرائيلية، وأصبحت غزة مدينة عالمية ورمزاً فلسطينياً كبيراً. وقام بعض الفنانين العربيين والعالميين بإبداء دعمهم وتأييدهم لنضال الغزاويين ومواساتهم في كارثتهم. ومنهم أول مغني أمريكي يغني لغزة وهو مايكل هارت.\nوقد أعلن المسؤولون الإسرائيليون امتداد العمليات العسكرية «حسب الحاجة»، في الوقت الذي ما زالت فيه الدول العربية تتجادل فيما بينها علي ضرورة عقد قمة عربية طارئة. علمًا بأن قطر نادت بعقد قمه عربية مُنذ بداية العدوان الإسرائيلي على غزه لمُناصرة الشعب فيها.\nوجاء هذا مصاحبا لمجهودات دولية تندد بالهجمات بوصفها هجمات همجية ووحشية وغير إنسانية البتة وقد قامت مظاهرات غاضبة في بلدان العالم تندد بالمجزرة. وبعد مرور 22 يوماً توقفت الحرب وانسحبت قوات الصهاينة مهزومة لأنها لم تحقق أهدافها. وخلفت وراءها أكثر من 5000 شهيد وأكثر من 8000 جريح وأكثر من 20000 منزل مدمر.\nالجدار الفولاذي\n\nفي ديسمبر 2009، أعلنت مصر عزمها بناء الجدار الفولاذي تحت الأرض بين رفح المصرية وقطاع غزة يصل إلى عمق 30 مترًا وطول 10 كم، من أجل وقف تسلل الفلسطينيين وتهريب السلاح إلى الأراضي المصرية، ووقف تهريب البضائع المصرية بمُختلف أنواعها للأراضي المحتلة.\nحيث أن الهدف من إنشاء هذا الجدار العازل هو القضاء على الأنفاق التي تصل بين مصر وقطاع غزة، وحيث أن هذه الإنفاق هي المدخل الوحيد الآن لكل احتياجات الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزة بعد أن فرضت مصر الحصار على معبر رفح وهو المنفذ الوحيد لغزة على العالم، وضيقت الخناق على أهل غزة، وهناك قضية مرفوعة الآن في مصر ضد قانونية هذا الجدار.\n\nالحكومة\nاليوم، تُعد غزة العاصمة الإدارية لمحافظة غزة. وتحتوي على مبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لمعظم وزارات السلطة الفلسطينية.\nتم تشكيل أول مجلس بلدي في غزة عام 1893 برئاسة علي خليل الشوا. قامت السلطات العثمانية بتعيين أبنه سعيد الشوا عام 1906 عمدة للمدينة. أشرف الشوا على بناء أول مستشفى في غزة وعدة مساجد ومدارس وترميم الجامع الكبير وإدخال المحراث الحديث للمدينة.\n\nفي 24 يوليو 1994، أعلنت السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في غزة وتم تأسيس مجلس المدينة الأول في الأراضي الفلسطينية. لم تعقد الانتخابات البلدية الفلسطينية في غزة ولا في رفح أو في خان يونس. بدلاً من ذلك، اختارت حركة فتح مسؤولي الحزب في المدن الصغيرة والبلدات والقرى لإجراء الانتخابات مع افتراض أنهم سيفعلون ما هو أفضل في المناطق الأقل حضرية. مع ذلك، فازت حماس المنافسة بأغلبية المقاعد، إذ حصلت على سبعة من بين 10 بلديات تم اختيارها لأول جولة ووصلت نسبة الإقبال على التصويت إلى 80% تقريباً. شهد عام 2007 مواجهات عنيفة بين الطرفين خلّفت أكثر من 100 قتيل، مما أدى في نهاية المطاف إلى سيطرة حماس على المدينة.\nبشكل طبيعي، فإن البلديات الفلسطينية التي يزيد عدد سكانها عن 20,000 نسمة تكون بمثابة مراكز إدارية لها مجالس بلدية، ويتشكل المجلس البلدي الحالي في غزة من 11 عضواً، بينهم رئيس البلدية نزار حجازي.\n\nرؤساء البلدية\nالمدن المتوأمة\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\n\nموقع بلدية غزة\nمتحف شهداء محرقة غزة 2009",

          "content": "Gaza (en arabe : غَزَّة, Ġazza [/[ˈɣazza]]) est la principale ville de la bande de Gaza. Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe nom de Gaza découle de la racine cananéenne Ġazzā, la « forte » ou « forteresse ».\n\nHistoire\nGaza est attestée au XVe siècle av. J.-C. au temps des Cananéens. La ville fait alors partie de l'Égypte. Depuis, différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé, la ville étant régulièrement assiégée et prise.\n\nAntiquité\nLa première référence à la ville de Gaza remonte au règne du pharaon égyptien Thoutmôsis III (mort en 1425 av. J.-C.). La ville est également citée dans les lettres d'Amarna (sous la XVIIIe dynastie). Son intérêt principal réside dans sa position stratégique sur la route côtière reliant l'Égypte antique et la Syrie. C'est alors un marché important et un poste avancé égyptien faisant partie du « Chemin d'Horus » (série de forteresses réparties entre Tcharou et Gaza).\nDans les années 1190 avant J.-C., les Philistins, un des peuples de la mer (originaires de Crète selon une tradition biblique) s'installent sur la côte sud cananéenne (de Gaza à Jaffa), après avoir attaqué l'Égypte. Les Philistins laisseront leur nom bien plus tard à l'ensemble du territoire, que les Romains appelleront « Palestine ». La ville philistine d'environ quatre-vingts hectares, murée, est construite sur une colline à quarante-cinq mètres d'altitude, à 2,4 km de la mer Méditerranée. Gaza est mentionnée dans la Bible Hébraïque comme l'une des villes principales des Philistins en guerre contre Israël : c'est là que le juge Samson est capturé et qu'il meurt en faisant s'écrouler un temple philistin.\n\n \nEn 525 av. J.-C., la cité est conquise par Cambyse II, grand roi achéménide de l'Empire perse, pour servir de tête de pont à toutes ses campagnes vers l'Égypte. La ville est prise en 332 av. J.-C. par le Macédonien Alexandre le Grand à l'issue d'un siège. Les habitants sont massacrés ou réduits en esclavage.\n\nPuis, dans le contexte des guerres des Diadoques pour la succession d'Alexandre le Grand, la bataille de Gaza oppose en 312 av. J.-C. les Macédoniens Ptolémée Ier, satrape d'Égypte, à Démétrios Ier, fils du général Antigone le Borgne, maître de l'Asie. Victorieux, Ptolémée doit néanmoins rapidement abandonner ses conquêtes en Syrie et en Phénicie.\nEn 145 av. J.-C., Gaza est conquise par Jonathan Maccabée, frère de Juda Maccabée et fondateur de la dynastie judéenne des Hasmonéens.\n\nÉpoques romaine et byzantine\nEn 63 avant notre ère, Gaza devient une partie de la Judée en tant que province romaine.\nDe grandes mosaïques témoignent de la richesse artistique de cette époque. Le christianisme se répand et les premiers monastères apparaissent. Le port de Gaza exporte un vin blanc fameux local : le vinum Gazetum. \nLa synagogue de Gaza est construite en 508/509 dans le centre de la ville antique de Gaza, aujourd'hui le quartier de Rimal, où vivait la communauté juive de Gaza (du IIe siècle av. J.-C. jusqu'au milieu du XXe siècle).\nGaza est représentée sur la carte de Madaba, au VIe siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nLa ville est considérée comme le lieu où serait mort Hachim ibn Abd Manaf, l'arrière-grand-père de Mahomet au cours d'une expédition commerciale, d'où le surnom de la ville « la Gaza de Hashim », « Ghazzat Hashim ». Une mosquée en son nom s'y trouve, la Mosquée d’al-Sayyid Hashim (en), et sous les arcades serait présente sa tombe.\nLa conquête de Gaza par les Arabes intervient très tôt, sans doute en 634. Elle n'est pas évoquée par les sources arabes mais l'est par les sources byzantines : la population civile, alors non musulmane, doit payer tribut aux Arabes et la garnison, constituée de soixante soldats, est emprisonnée et mise à mort quelque temps plus tard. Sous les Omeyyades, une garnison militaire et un atelier monétaire sont implantés en ville. L'islamisation de la cité est progressive : c'est là que naît l'imam al-Chafii (fondateur de l'école de jurisprudence chafiite), mais ce n'est pas là qu'il vécut et enseigna.\nLa petite communauté juive — présente à Gaza depuis la période hellénistique et également dans la ville de Rafah — paye un impôt de protection, et les Dhimmis ne furent pas inquiétés.\n\nLa cité fait peu parler d'elle jusqu'au XIIe siècle et, au moment de la Croisade, elle a beaucoup décliné. Elle est en ruines et peut-être désertée quand les Croisés occupent le site en 1149 et y construisent un château fort dans la partie la plus élevée. Ce château est confié à la garde des Templiers. Au sud du château, se développe la ville franque avec une grande église gothique qui est aujourd'hui la grande mosquée de Gaza, al-Omari, construite pendant la période des Omeyyades au VIIIe siècle. Une autre église, Saint-Porphyre (orthodoxe), datant du XIIe siècle, plus petite, est considérée comme la plus ancienne de la ville encore active. Tenue par les Templiers, apparemment prospère si l'on en juge par la qualité de sa grande église, Gaza constitue l'avant-poste du Royaume franc de Jérusalem face à l'Égypte. Les sources franques la nomment Gazara, et en ancien français Gadres. Elle ne constitue pas un lieu de pèlerinage, et sa renommée en France ne vient que d'une chanson de geste composée vers 1170, Li Fuerre de Gadres (le sac de Gaza), évoquant la prise de la ville par Alexandre le Grand.\nÀ la fin de 1170, le sultan Saladin s'empare de la ville basse mais échoue à prendre le château. Ce n'est qu'en 1187, au lendemain de la bataille de Hattin, qu'il obtient l'évacuation de Gaza par les Templiers et la remise des forteresses de Gaza et de Darom (Deir el-Balah, au sud de Gaza). Le roi d'Angleterre Richard Cœur de Lion reprend Darom et Gaza en 1192, mais négocie ensuite avec Saladin l'abandon de ces positions jugées trop exposées, qu'il fait évacuer après en avoir détruit les fortifications.\nEn 1239, un retour offensif des Francs est brisé à Beit Hanoun, bourgade du nord de Gaza, dont la mosquée abrite les tombes des musulmans qui sont tués au cours de cette bataille. En 1244, a lieu à Hirbiyyah (en latin Furbia, en français « La Forbie ») une bataille bien plus importante opposant une coalition égypto-khowarizmienne et une coalition syro-franque : le roi Al-Salih Ismaël de Damas avait promis aux Templiers de leur restituer Gaza en cas de victoire, mais ils sont défaits. Gaza demeure au pouvoir des Ayyoubides d'Égypte, puis de Syrie, jusqu'en 1260 où la ville est occupée un temps par les Mongols avant d'être reprise par le chef mamelouk Baybars.\nDans les années 1480, des voyageurs indiquent que Gaza est la ville la plus importante de Palestine. Elle est habitée par des Éthiopiens, des Arabes, des Égyptiens, des Syriens, des Indiens, des Juifs (soixante-six familles), des Samaritains (quatre familles) et des chrétiens, plus de sept-mille hommes, au milieu de dix-mille chameaux. Seuls les Juifs y produisent le vin local.\nL'époque des Mamelouks (fin XIIIe - début XVIe siècle) fut pour Gaza une période prospère de renaissance, malgré des crises.\n\nTemps modernes\nLes Ottomans mettent fin au règne des Mamelouks en 1516 après la bataille de Khan Younès. La ville de Gaza et toute la région sont administrées pendant cinq siècles par la province ottomane d'Égypte jusqu'au début du XXe siècle.\nDans la seconde partie du XVIIe siècle, Gaza est décrite par des pèlerins et voyageurs. Elle est la capitale de la province de Palestine qu'un pacha gouverne. Elle n'est plus entourée de murs mais de monticules de pierres. Le turc, l'arabe et le grec sont les langues qui y sont parlées. Elle possède des bains somptueux et d'immenses bazars. La Grande mosquée est entourée de six mosquées et nombre d'oratoires. On y trouve également une église arménienne et une autre, grecque, ainsi qu'une synagogue et un bain rituel.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nPalestine mandataire\nAu tout début du XXe siècle, on dénombre environ quarante-mille habitants dont sept-cent-cinquante chrétiens et cent-soixante Juifs (majoritairement ashkénazes) vivant dans Gaza prospère et paisible.\n\nQuand éclate la Première Guerre mondiale, l'Empire ottoman s'engage aux côtés de son allié, l'Empire allemand. En novembre 1917, à l'issue de la troisième bataille de Gaza, les troupes britanniques, commandées par le général Allenby, s'emparent de la ville. Les Britanniques destituent le maire de Gaza, Saïd al-Shawwa, nommé par les Ottomans. La Déclaration Balfour se montre favorable à l’établissement d'un « un foyer national pour le peuple juif » en Palestine, en précisant que ce projet ne devra pas porter atteinte aux droits civils et religieux des communautés non juives présentes sur le territoire.\nEn 1922, la Société des Nations place la Palestine sous mandat britannique. C'est à partir de cette période que s'accroît l'immigration juive en provenance d’Europe de l’Est, particulièrement lors des persécutions nazies des années 1930.\n\nGuerre de 1948, Nakba et administration égyptienne\nGaza reste sous le mandat britannique jusqu'à l'évacuation des Britanniques en mai 1948, à la suite de la décision de partage de la Palestine du 29 novembre 1947. Le territoire est divisé en deux par une proposition de l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU), avec un État pour les Arabes (sur 42 % du territoire), un autre pour les Juifs (sur 56 % du territoire), et une zone neutre pour Jérusalem (2% du territoire). Cependant, quand Israël déclare son indépendance, le refus de cette solution par les Arabes entraîne une violente guerre en 1948, opposant Israël à ses voisins arabes.\n\nLors de la guerre de 1948, les Israéliens tentent d’empoisonner les puits avec le germe de la typhoïde, comme ils l’ont fait avec succès à Acre. Mais leur tentative, qui a lieu le 27 mai, est déjouée par la surveillance gazaouie et l’armée égyptienne. Gaza est aussi une des rares villes que les Israéliens bombardent durant cette guerre, « les Gazaouis ont la plus longue histoire de victimes de bombardements par Israël, de 1948 à nos jours ».\nÀ la fin du conflit, trois Arabes sur quatre au moins s’exilent ou sont expulsés (Nakba).\nDe 1948 à 1967, la bande de Gaza est administrée par l'Égypte. À la suite de la crise du canal de Suez, elle est occupée par Israël de novembre 1956 au 7 mars 1957. Outre quatre-mille prisonniers, cette occupation cause la mort de 930 à 1 200 Palestiniens arabes pour une population totale de 330 000 personnes.\n\nGuerre des Six Jours et occupation israélienne\nAprès la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967, la bande de Gaza est à nouveau occupée par Israël qui y implantent plusieurs colonies de peuplement juif.\nEntre 1976 et 1981, un mouvement issus des Frères musulmans égyptiens, le Hamas, crée à Gaza l'université islamique de Gaza et d'autres institutions islamiques (al-Mujamma al-islami, al-Jam'iyya al-islamiyya, etc.).\n\nLe 9 décembre 1987, c'est à Gaza que débute la première intifada, la « révolte des pierres », avant de s'étendre à l'ensemble des territoires occupés jusqu'en 1993, année des accords d'Oslo. « Intifada » est d'ailleurs le seul mot arabe qui intègre le vocabulaire de la politique mondiale au XXe siècle. À la suite d’un accident de circulation que les Arabes considèrent comme un acte intentionnel de la part du chauffeur israélien, des jeunes du camp de Jabalia se révoltent et lancent des pierres sur les forces d'autorité. Les artisans se rebellent aussi en ne se rendant pas au travail, et en fermant leur boutique.\nLe 4 mai 1994, l'Organisation de libération de la Palestine (OLP) obtient la gestion de Gaza et de la région de Jéricho. Le président Yasser Arafat et l'Autorité palestinienne s'installent à Gaza.\n\nRetrait israélien en 2005\nEn 2005, à la suite de la seconde intifada, le gouvernement israélien retire unilatéralement ses forces armées et ses colonies de la Bande de Gaza.Le 25 janvier 2006, le Hamas remporte les élections législatives palestiniennes de 2006. Ismaël Haniyeh est nommé Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne. La collaboration avec l'appareil politique mis en place par le Fatah est difficile.\nEn juin 2007, le Hamas prend le pouvoir à Gaza et chasse les tenants de l'Autorité palestinienne. Israël, qui avait gardé le contrôle des frontières, des eaux territoriales et de l'espace aérien, met en place un blocus de la Bande de Gaza.\n\nGuerre de 2023-2025\nEn octobre 2023, éclate la guerre à Gaza, lancée à la suite de l'incursion le 7 du même mois de commandos du Hamas en Israël depuis Gaza (opération dite « Déluge d'Al-Aqsa ») et le massacre de civils israéliens et étrangers, auxquels Israël répond pour officiellement éliminer le Hamas par des bombardements massifs notamment sur la ville de Gaza avec des milliers de civils gazaouis tués sous les bombes, le blocus intégral du territoire, un siège puis une attaque terrestre, l'ensemble entraînant une crise humanitaire alarmante. En juillet 2024, l'armée israélienne ordonne l'évacuation de toute la ville.\n\nLes écoles servant de lieux de refuge pour les déplacés sont régulièrement bombardées, accusées par Israël de cacher des centres de commandement et d'opérations militaires du Hamas, des terroristes ou des armes. Le 1er août 2024, au moins quinze personnes sont tuées lors d'une attaque israélienne contre l'école Dalal al-Mughrabi, tandis que le 3 août, seize autres personnes sont tuées lors du bombardement de l'école Hamama. Le 4 août, au moins trente personnes sont tuées dans des raids aériens israéliens sur les écoles Nassr et Hassan Salama, à l'ouest de la ville, et le 8 août, au moins dix-sept personnes sont tuées dans des attaques contre les écoles Abdul Fattah Hamouda et az-Zahra. Le 10 août, plus de cent personnes sont tuées et cent-cinquante autres blessées après que les forces israéliennes ont bombardé l'école al-Tabin, à l'est de la ville. Le 21 septembre, vingt-et-une personnes sont tuées lors d'une frappe israélienne sur l'école Al-Zaytoun abritant des déplacés, quand Israël précise que sa cible terroriste se trouvait « à l'intérieur » de l'école Al-Falah, adjacente aux bâtiments de l'école Al-Zaytoun.\n\nLa ville est en grande partie détruite par les bombardements. Selon l'International Crisis Group, la stratégie israélienne est de rendre Gaza invivable en obligeant la population à se déplacer constamment et en détruisant tout.\n\nSelon une enquête d'Amnesty International, les destructions sont injustifiées et contraires au droit international humanitaire. Un rapport de Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) dénonce la « campagne de destruction totale menée par Israël » et affirme les difficultés d'accès pour traiter les blessés.Pour certains chercheurs, les destructions planifiées et délibérées de quartiers entiers de Gaza s'apparente à un urbicide.\nLe 22 août 2025, à la suite du rapport de l'organisme indépendant IPC, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare l'état de famine dans la ville, en « raison de l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » dans l'acheminement des vivres. Responsables de l'approvisionnement alimentaire dans les zones sous occupation militaire selon le droit international, le gouvernement israélien réfute cette accusation, parlant de « préjugés antisémites » et de « mensonges ».\nAu 16 septembre 2025, la ville de Gaza est en grande partie dévastée par les bombardements israéliens avec, selon l'ONU, plus de 78 % des immeubles détruits, partiellement ou totalement, y compris les hôpitaux et les écoles.\n\nGéographie\nClimat\nGaza a un climat chaud, semi-aride ou méditerranéen (malgré de très rares précipitations) avec des hivers doux et secs, et des étés chauds. Les mois les plus chauds sont juillet et août, la température moyenne étant de 33 °C. Le mois le plus froid est janvier avec des températures généralement à 7 °C.\nLa pluie est rare et se situe généralement entre novembre et mars, avec des taux de précipitations annuelles d'environ 116 mm (4,57 pouces).\n\nÉducation\nGaza est une ville jeune : environ 60 % de la population de la ville serait constituée de personnes âgées de moins de 18 ans.\nEn 2006, il y avait 210 écoles à Gaza : 151 étaient gérées par le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne, 46 par l'Office de secours et de travaux des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés de Palestine dans le Proche-Orient (UNRWA) et 13 étaient des écoles privées. Au total, 154 251 élèves étaient inscrits, et 5 877 enseignants étaient employés.\nFin 2023, à la suite de la guerre menée par Israël dans la bande de Gaza, toutes les écoles ont dû être fermés et un grand nombre d'établissements sont devenus des lieux de refuge pour la population civile. À la rentrée 2024, plus de 45 000 enfants de classe primaire n'ont pas pu aller à l'école à cause de la situation actuelle. Ils rejoignent les 625 000 élèves déjà privés d’une année scolaire entière. Quant aux universités de la ville, elles ont été partiellement voire totalement détruites par l’armée israélienne en 2024.\n\nPatrimoine\nLe centre-ville comporte un certain nombre de monuments importants. Toutefois, un grand nombre d'entre eux ont été détruits par les bombardements israéliens depuis 2023.\n\nLa Grande mosquée de Gaza (al-Omari), ancienne église datant du XIIe siècle, a gardé son architecture gothique caractéristique. Elle a ensuite été agrandie au XIIIe siècle sous les Mamelouks, qui lui ont notamment ajouté un minaret. L'édifice a été gravement endommagé au cours de la Première Guerre mondiale, puis fut restauré sous le mandat britannique. En décembre 2023, le monument est détruit par l'armée israélienne.\n\nLe musée de la ville occupe un édifice d'époque mamelouke et ottomane, le Qasr al-Basha, magnifiquement restauré au début des années 2000. C'était au XVIIe siècle la résidence du gouverneur ottoman de Palestine et le général Napoléon Bonaparte y a installé son quartier général lors de son passage dans la ville en 1798. Fin 2023, il est en grande partie détruit par les bombardements israéliens.\n\nOn trouve enfin l'église Saint-Porphyre, qui daterait du début du XIIe siècle, centre de la communauté orthodoxe de la ville, dont l'état actuel paraît remonter à l'époque des croisades. Le 19 octobre 2023, l'église Saint-Porphyre est endommagée par une frappe israélienne lors de la guerre à Gaza.\nLe centre-ville compte encore d'anciennes maisons familiales en pierre locale, également de l'époque ottomane.\nL'église de la Sainte-Famille de Gaza est le centre de la communauté catholique de la bande de Gaza. Le 17 juillet 2025, elle est bombardée par l'armée israélienne, causant trois morts et blessant le curé Gabriel Romanelli.\nGaza compte aussi un hammam datant de l'époque ottomane, récemment restauré, puis détruit par l'armée israélienne pendant la guerre de 2023-2025.\n\nInventaire du patrimoine détruit par l'armée israélienne\nSelon l'UNESCO, au printemps 2025, les deux tiers du patrimoine de la bande de Gaza ont déjà été détruits par l'armée israélienne. Sous la conduite de l’historien Fabrice Virgili, un collectif de chercheurs et d'universitaires français recense le patrimoine architectural, et naturel, détruit par l'armée israélienne.

          "summary": "Gaza (en arabe : غَزَّة, Ġazza [/[ˈɣazza]]) est la principale ville de la bande de Gaza. Elle est parfois appelée « ville de Gaza » ou « Gaza-ville » pour la distinguer du territoire auquel elle donne son nom.\nHabitée depuis l'Antiquité, Gaza connaît un essor au temps des Cananéens au XVe siècle av. J.-C., puis différentes ethnies s'y sont succédé. Après avoir été placée sous l'autorité civile et militaire de l'Autorité palestinienne dès l'application des accords de Jéricho et Gaza de 1994 avec Israël, elle est depuis juin 2007 la ville la plus importante sous l'autorité du Hamas.\nLa ville est presque entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne lors de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza, commencée en octobre 2023 avec l'attaque du Hamas contre Israël. S'ensuivent un siège de l'enclave, des bombardements massifs et d'une invasion terrestre.\nAvant la guerre, la ville de Gaza comptait près de 700 000 habitants tandis que la population totale de la bande de Gaza dépasse 2 100 000 personnes, dont environ un tiers vivaient dans des camps de réfugiés palestiniens, un autre tiers étant constitué des réfugiés vivant en dehors des camps. Ses habitants sont les Gazaouis.\nLe 22 août 2025, l'Organisation des Nations unies déclare officiellement l'état de famine à Gaza, en raison de « l'obstruction systématique d'Israël » sur l'entrée de l'aide humanitaire.",

          "content": "## Overview\nThe Gaza Strip (Arabic غزة, Ghazzah, Hebrew עזה Azza) is a Palestinian territory in the Middle East. The capital and largest city is Gaza. Portions of this page may be out of date because the situation on the ground changes quickly.\n\n## Understand\nPositioned between Israel and Egypt, Gaza Strip contains several towns and cities that have grown together. The capital and largest city is Gaza, with Khan Yunis and Rafah being the second and third largest. Several smaller villages are nestled between these cities. It does have reasonably modern infrastructure and architecture despite its troubles, but a UN report as early as 1952 stated that the Strip was too small to support its population of 300,000, and now there are well over 1.7 million inhabitants. On 7 October 2023, the Israel-Hamas War broke out, and thousands of people have been killed.\nMost inhabitants are descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from their homes in Israel during or after the 1948 war and were not allowed to return to their homes and villages. As they were not Egyptian citizens they were not allowed into Egypt, either.\n\n## History\nGaza has been around for a while: the earliest known reference is an inscription in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, Egypt, dated 1500 BC, which states that the town of Gaza is 'flourishing'. And for a long time it did: a staging post on trade routes connecting Asia and Persia with Arabia, Egypt and Africa, even the name means \"treasure\" in Arabic. Alexander the Great laid siege to the town in 332 BC, executing 10,000 defenders after being held off for two months. Later, the town was held by the Romans, the Crusaders, the Mamluks, the Ottomans and briefly even by the French in 1799, when Napoleon Bonaparte set up camp on his way to defeat in Egypt. The Turks took it back, then lost it to the British in World War I. The Egyptian army grabbed it during the 1948 war that led to Israel's independence, opening camps for Palestinian refugees who fled and were expelled from their homes by Israeli forces — and the current situation began when Israel occupied the Strip in 1967.\nSpurred by the violence of the 1987–1993 Intifada (\"Uprising\"), Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a \"Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements\" in 1993, under which the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created to govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a transitional period \"not exceeding five years\" as a step towards full independence.  Parts of the territories were indeed handed over to the PA between 1994 and 1999, but the peace plans were derailed by the second intifada that broke out in September 2000, unleashing another spiral of violence.\nIsrael unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in 2005, evacuating Jewish settlements and withdrawing its troops from the territory. It did however retain control of the airspace and the coastline in addition to the fact the entire region is circled by a large armed security fence. The Islamist Hamas won elections in 2006 and violently kicked out or killed the remnants of the Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Under Hamas rule, there have been repeated incidents of missile launches from Gaza into Israel and Israeli targeted assassinations of terrorists in Gaza, bombings, and incursions or invasions of Gaza. Israel has also heavily restricted the movement of trade, aid, and people between Gaza and Israel in response to attacks on border crossing points and the Hamas government's non-recognition of Israel. Relations between Hamas and the Egyptian government have also been tense at times, with the Egyptian government sometimes blaming Hamas for attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians in the Sinai but also condemning Israeli actions against Gaza. From December 2008 to January 2009, Israel launched a massive coordinated air, naval, and land offensive against the Hamas government and allied militant organizations. Hostilities resumed in 2012, but a short-lived ceasefire was restored with the help of Egyptian mediation.\nIn 2025, Israel is at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It's very unlikely that you will be able to get into Gaza unless you are an accredited journalist, or UN or charity worker, and you will have performed in-depth risk assessments. Do not rely on a travel guide for your risk assessment. Civilian infrastructure has been hit very hard, and your presence in the strip will divert resources from the needy.\n\n## Geography\nThe Gaza Strip is a narrow, 40-km long slice of land between the Mediterranean to the west and the Negev desert to the east.  Egypt lies to the south, the north and east border Israel.  The urban sprawl of Gaza City, mostly stretching along and around the 3-km long Omar al-Mukhtar Street, covers much of the north. The other main towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah are near the southern border, with most of the rest covered with agricultural land.\nA bit of terminology disentanglement: Gaza Strip refers to the entire 40km by 6km patch of territory. The strip is slightly smaller than Barbados and slightly larger than Malta. Gaza City refers to the town itself, in the northern part of the strip, but due to huge population growth the City now sprawls into many of the surrounding villages and it's a tough task to say what is a part of the City and what isn't. Both city and strip are pretty much interchangeably referred to as Gaza and this guide will follow suit.\n\n## Climate\nTemperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers.\n\n## Terrain\nFlat to rolling, sand and dune covered coastal plain. Cultivated land.\nHighest point: Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda) 105 m (344 ft)\n\n## Get in\nGetting into Gaza is both difficult and unwise. As of around 2003, all would-be visitors were required to apply in advance for Israeli permission to enter the Strip. The application is usually submitted through your embassy in Israel and, in theory takes between 5–10 days. In practice, it can take months, and if you're not either a fully accredited journalist or an aid/human rights worker, you're unlikely to get permission to enter Gaza from Israel.\nBecause of the Israel-Hamas war, it is not possible to enter Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing.\n\n## By plane\nGaza has no functioning airport, as the former Yasser Arafat International Airport (GZA  IATA) has been shut down, and the runway was destroyed by Israeli bulldozers in 2002. The closest airports are El Arish International Airport in Egypt (which has no commercial flights) and Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv (TLV IATA). The closest non-Israeli commercial airports are Jordan's Queen Alia International Airport (AMM IATA) and King Hussein International Airport (AQJ IATA), while the closest Egyptian-controlled airport with non-charter commercial service is Cairo International Airport (CAI IATA). Taba International Airport (TCP  IATA) is closer than Cairo, but only charter flights fly there.\n\n## Entry by land\nThe main point of entry is through the Erez crossing in the north, on the border with Israel. Getting to Erez is easiest done by taxi, it's also possible to travel by Dan BaDarom[dead link] bus #20 from Ashkelon to the checkpoint.\nYou will need a permit from the Israeli Army, or a GPO (press) card. If you have a permit, you need coordination with the Israeli Army, specifying when you are planning to enter and leave Gaza. Journalists with a Government Press Office (GPO) card can come and go as they please. Only vehicles with prior coordination (such as a handful of UN cars) are allowed to drive in and only after a thorough search, which may take months. It's very helpful to travel with someone that's run the gauntlet before the first time via Erez.\nAt Erez, you have to approach the Israeli soldier in a pillbox. They may ask you to open your bags on the table, and (as at TLV) ask if you have weapons. They'll check your passports and permits for allowed entry. You then wait outside an electronic gate for your turn to be called through. You then enter the terminal, hand your passport and coordination over to another soldier to receive an Israeli exit stamp. That soldier may or may not ask you more questions, usually things like whether it's your first time in Gaza, etc.\nIf everything is satisfactory, take back your documents and follow the signs directing you to Gaza. After exiting the terminal, you end up in a long barren concrete tunnel. Don't bring anything too bulky as you'll have to go through a turnstile gate. Coming through the tunnel, you cross a no-man's-land. This is at least 1000m long. Palestinians are allowed in this area so you may be lucky and find a porter, trolley, wheelchair, or similar. Take it. If you take the tuk-tuk, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times and enjoy the ride.\nAfter the gated tunnel you will emerge near a small hut. This is a checkpoint which can be ignored on the way to Gaza (but ignored at your peril on the way back). The only people here will be a few taxi drivers.\nTake a taxi to the Palestinian checkpoint, another 800 m down the road. The going rate is ₪3 per person. You will be searched for unlawful items (make sure you are, it's the hut to the right. Also visit the hut to the left to check your Hamas credentials)\nProhibited goods include alcohol and non-halal food, banned by the Hamas government. If you fail inspection, then at best, your items will be confiscated. At worst, you will be arrested; you are unlikely to see any guns at this point. In a particularly bad situation, retreat to Israel.\nOnce you are through, you can take another taxi, or more likely be picked up by your local contact.\n\n## Exit by land\nEntry, though difficult, pales in comparison to exit. After being deposited at the Hamas checkpoint near Hamsa Hamsa, go to the white caravan to your right to get your exit clearance.\nOnce through, take the taxi (₪3/person) to the forward checkpoint (where the wire fence begins). Then, go to the hut on the right.\nA man will take your passport and call ahead to tell the Israelis you're coming. Ignore this at your own peril.\nOnce you get your passport back, take the tuk-tuk if possible, or begin the 1 km+ walk to Israel.\nWhen you reach the end of the tunnel, you'll see several doors. Once a handful of people have gathered, one of the doors will open (indicated by a green light on top of the door).\nYou will then enter a hall with a table at the centre. Open your bags at the table (there are no obvious signs to do this, but look up and there's a camera. They are checking for obvious things like large bombs)\nWhen they've ensured you have no prohibited items in your bags, go through the turnstile when the light flashes green. You will not receive a verbal \"OK\", but rest assured you will be shouted at in Hebrew if you're not ok.\nYou will see toilet facilities to your right. Use them. Follow the arrows to Israel. You will then encounter another hall with eight doorways. Wait until one of the lights go green then enter that doorway. Leave your bags with the porter at a large security scanner. You should remove all electronics not just laptops, but things like disk drives, mobile phones, etc.) and place them in the large trays. Remove your belt, watch, etc. too.\nKeep your passport and ID on you and enter a series of gates as the lights flash green. When you come to the body scanner (an MMW scanner), put your feet on the markers and place your hands over your head in an \"I surrender\" pose. Keep your passport in your hands. If you've passed initial screening, you will be allowed out to a hall where it appears as if your bags will emerge on a conveyor belt. There may even be empty trays circling it.\nWalk straight through to the departures hall, as your bag will be selected for a hand search. On your left in a row where trays with bags will gather, and you can see the guards searching your bags. Wait patiently. If you haven't passed initial screening, you'll be directed through further scanning. There is a separate section that will reveal itself to you if the guards in the gallery above find the need for a strip search.\nOnce you collect your belongings, you will finally pass through Israeli entry, and get a new stamp in your passport. You're then free and in Israel. Count yourself lucky you own a western passport.\nExit from Gaza could take from 30 minutes to several hours. The checkpoint closes at 14:00, or even earlier. If you are stuck between Hamas and Israel phone your embassy for assistance, but don't try to re-enter Gaza. If you're using Erez you're probably \"western\", and you're safer in Israeli hands.\n\n## By boat\nThe port of Gaza is non-operational, and Gazan waters, seaports, and the coastline are patrolled by the Israeli Navy. If you attempt to reach the Gaza shoreline by boat, you will be stopped by Israeli naval vessels, and turned back. Only boats with prior permission are allowed in. All boats coming from Gaza are allowed to venture six nautical miles into the sea. Any vessel crossing this line is fired on. In 2010 a six-ship flotilla attempted to reach Gaza by sea, and was intercepted by Israeli warships; ten people were killed by Israeli forces and the ships never reached Gaza. It is strongly recommended not to attempt to visit Gaza in this manner.\n\n## Get around\nThere is no public transport in Gaza, but there are numerous service (ser-VEESS) taxis.  Navigation is done by landmark, not street address. Stand on the side of the road that is in the desired direction of travel.  When a driver stops indicate the destination landmark e.g., \"Shifa\" and the number of passengers (\"wahid\" for one, \"it-nayn\" for two.)  If the driver is not headed that way, he may drive on. Travel up and down Omar al-Mukhtar St. will set you back ₪1; trips elsewhere are negotiable.  Near al-Shifa hospital is a line of taxis that travel to destinations beyond Gaza city.  The drivers yell out their destination and wait until their vehicle is pretty much full before they leave. It is advisable to watch your step if walking, since traffic is chaotic and sidewalks are largely non-existent.\n\n## Talk\nThe standard language is Arabic. Hebrew is also understood to some extent, but given the dislike towards Israelis by many Palestinians, English is a safer option.\n\n## See\nGaza is not exactly a top tourist destination and most of its attractions have taken quite a beating during the past 50 years.\n31.50122234.4713891 Grand Omari Mosque (جامع غزة الكبير, Jāmaʿ Ghazza al-Kabīr).

Located att the archaeological site Tell Umm el-'Amr, Saint Hilarion was an active monastery for four centuries, from the late Late Roman to the Umayyad period. Named after Hilarion the Great (291–371 AD), who is venerated as a saint by the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church. The tell and monastery were listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2024.

Burial site of over 3,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen who perished in the First World War, mainly in the battles for Gaza during 1917.   (updated Aug 2023)\nMore educational might be a UNRWA-arranged visit to one of the refugee camps that dot the strip. The UNRWA office is on al-Azhar St, near the Islamic University, call ahead to see if they can arrange a little tour. Your most probable destination is the optimistically named Beach Camp, a warren of concrete huts and open sewers housing 63,000 people, built next to a sandy beach - and you can walk there on your own, 15 minutes to the north from the intersection of Omar al-Mukhtar St. with the seafront road. UNRWA wisely recommends avoiding military clothing. The Jabaliya refugee camp is also a nearby option. Women visiting the camps should dress more conservatively than they need to in Gaza City - headscarves are certainly recommended.\n\n## Do\nThere's very little to do in Gaza for the average tourist. There is a beach, however the water isn't the cleanest in the area, you'd be better off on a beach further north in Israel. There are nice sunsets though over the Med, which can be seen from hotels like the Al Deira.\n\n## Buy\nDespite the intense conflict and rhetoric, Gazans use the Israeli shekel (₪). But bring some boxes of cigarettes into the Strip and everyone will be your friend. However, please note the policemen at the Hamas checkpoint into Gaza are now opening all bags and disposing of any alcohol (since early 2009). Do not bring alcohol into Gaza, it could land you into serious trouble and it is always good to respect local Islamic customs.\n31.51996134.4480561 Gaza City Centre. This elegant  mall  opened in 2010 is the place to be to escape the hubbub of Gaza's bustling Rimal district. With a fully-stocked supermarket, fast food restaurant and multiple shops, Gazans have quickly taken to this place. Enjoy the relaxing fountains if you have had enough of shopping or need a break. The Gaza Mall is comparable to most Western-style malls only in structure and comfort, but not even remotely in size. You will usually find it packed to the brim with residents of Rimal in the summer escaping the midday heat and may quickly find you want to escape elsewhere.\nPLO Flag Shop. A bit tough to find (ask around) but unmistakable once you spot it. It's the place to buy Palestinian flags, stickers, badges, and pennants. (updated May 2020)\nInteresting sculptures / lampshades fashioned from old cigarette cartons.\nFoustouk and simsimiya. The former is a sticky peanuty snack. The latter is its sesame cousin. An elderly man in Gaza City with a grey tweed jacket crops up on a different street corner when he has a fresh batch.\n\n## Eat\nUsual Arabic cheap eats are available anywhere. Head to the posh suburb of Rimal for fancier food; the restaurant in the Windmill Hotel is nice. If you wish to bring in any food, you should first check which foods are and are not acceptable under Islamic law. If you are caught with forbidden food, it may lead to trouble with the authorities or the local population. Finally, it is not unheard of to be invited over for dinner.\nAbu Hassera. Fish specialist.\nAldeira Restaurant. On the seaside terrace, this restaurant serves lovely mezes (small Mediterranean-style dishes), including the Gazan speciality Daqqa (a sometimes very spicy chili salad, very nice). They also have some tasty main courses: try the shrimps in tomato sauce, baked in the oven, and served in a clay pot. And don't miss out on the fresh strawberry juice! Enhanced with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, it is highly enjoyable.\nMatouk (behind the legislative council building). Serves an excellent chicken tawwouk.\n31.51662634.4499771 [dead link] Roots Club, Cairo St, Remal (in the heart of Gaza City), ☏ +972 8 2888666, fax: +972 8 2888999, info@rootsclub.ps. Fine dining. Offers both high end Arabian/Mediterranean cuisine and cheaper fast food at the Big Bite annex. The restaurant frequently caters for special events, including foreign dignitaries and heads of non-governmental organizations.\nSeafood Restaurant (just north of al-Deira hotel). Very good seafood restaurant.\nAl Mat'haf Resort (Soudnya beach), ☏ +970 8 2858444. On a small hill overlooking the sea in Gaza stands “Al-Mathaf” (Arabic for “The Museum”, pronounced Al-Mat-Haf), a one-of-a-kind recreation and cultural center that showcases Gaza’s rich historical past and seamlessly blends it into the context of life in modern Gaza. As its name suggests, Al-Mathaf is home to Gaza’s finest archaeological museum, which is filled with beautiful artifacts that celebrate Gaza’s rich cultural heritage. Alongside these historical treasures of ancient civilizations, today’s Gazans gathers at Al-Mathaf’s beautiful Restaurant-Café, a center of modern culture and recreation in Gaza. In a time when many in Gaza have forgotten our heritage, Al-Mathaf aims to preserve the region's rich history, provide a venue for modern cultural dialogue, and carry a message for this generation to build a brighter future.\n\n## Drink\nDue to increasingly strong Hamas influences, alcohol is no longer available. Alcohol is forbidden in their interpretation of Islam, and Hamas, as a conservative Islamic group, prohibits it. If you do manage to find some, you should not attempt to go out under the influence; you may land in a very bad situation. If you are caught with booze on your person by Hamas authorities, it will probably be confiscated, and you may be detained. Bags are given a quick search on entry to Gaza.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are several hotels in Gaza. However, it is also possible to stay with locals who might even invite you over for a night.\n31.527534.43711 Al Deira Hotel (فندق الديرة غزة فلسطين), ☏ +972 8 283 8100, fax: +972 8 283 8400, info@aldeira.ps. Massive rooms with a view of the sea, breakfast included. Most international journalists and NGOs stay at the Deira, which has a back-up generator, a business centre and WiFi. Pleasant (though by Gaza's standards not superb) restaurant (with Shisha pipes, although not allowed in the fine Oriental bedrooms). Don't be alarmed that the water tastes salty. Rooms include non-alcoholic minibar, hairdryer, towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a little plate of cookies. $100–185USD/night.      (updated Sep 2023)\nCommodore Hotel.

(updated Dec 2021)\n\n## Work\nRealistically, if you are not already an aid worker, journalist or diplomat, there is no work for you in Gaza. There are a number of NGOs offering internships, such as the Al-Dameer Association for Human Rights in Gaza, the Palestinian Center For Human Rights and others, but these must be arranged well before you get to Gaza.\n\n## Stay safe\nAs of August 2024, Gaza is at war and almost certainly the single most dangerous location to travel to. Anybody who somehow makes it in shouldn't expect any form of food, water, or medicine other than what they brought in themselves. Disease is rampant as a result of poor sanitation, and as of July 2024, there's been an outbreak of polio. Bombings can happen anywhere, including the refugee camps, at any time. If you find yourself in danger (which is likely), your government will not be able to offer any form of assistance.\nGaza's power station and its substation have been severely damaged by Israeli airstrikes and no longer function at the intended capacity. Power outages are very common. These outages are countered by large industrial and small commercial diesel generators which combine to create a cacophony that the locals have somehow become desensitised to. Some of these generators are poorly maintained and leak carbon monoxide. Visitors should be wary of this, particularly in enclosed spaces where it has proven fatal.\n\n## Stay healthy\nTap water in Gaza is not potable and is often dangerously dirty. Some hotels may use filters, but if in doubt, just buy bottles.\nIsrael has blockaded the area since 2007. However, food and medical supplies are generally allowed in after inspection. Any medical requirements should be taken care of in Israel or elsewhere. Anyone visiting Gaza is well advised to have a good grounding in first aid and bring in their own first aid kits. Beware that medical evacuations to Israel can require a long wait at the border.\nDiseases such as yellow fever, malaria and West Nile virus are fairly common in the Gaza Strip. Get vaccinated, wear protective clothing and use mosquito repellent.\n\n## Respect\nWomen should dress conservatively, especially if entering refugee camps. Conservatively within Gaza City means a top with long sleeves and absolutely nothing low cut in the front. Ideally, tops should also be long. Trousers are suitable as long as they are loose and full length, not capri pants.\n\n## Go next\nIsrael\nEgypt",

          "content": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nRamallah was founded in the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.\nSeveral Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called Ramalie. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called al-Burj, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.\n\nOttoman period\nThe area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.\nHaddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian \"of the Greek rite\". There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village \"belonged\" to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Ramallah as\n\nA large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.\n\nBritish Mandate\nDuring World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city's homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.\nThe city became a center of insurgent activity when the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine broke out. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce \"news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.\"\n\nJordanian and Israeli occupation\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized part of the territory, which they named the West Bank, which included Ramallah. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian occupation between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. However, many Palestinians were arrested and jailed for being members of \"illegal political parties\", which included the Palestine Communist Party, and other socialist and pro-independence groups. The city's population had doubled by 1953, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. About one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left by 1956, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. Because of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for the first time in 19 years, residents of Ramallah could freely visit the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel, and engage in commerce there.\nUnlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.\nAccording to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. The popular uprising known as the First Intifada erupted in December 1987, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.\nRamallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. Following the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa in December 1995 and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated \"Area A\" under the accords.\n\nPalestinian Authority control\nThe years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the \"Oslo Years\") brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah's isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine.  It hosts almost all governmental headquarters.  In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.\nOn November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.\nIn December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for a four-year term on the fifteen-seat municipal council. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.\nMunir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, \"The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries\", representing a \"collusion\" between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that \"If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.\" In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.\n\nGeography and climate\nThis area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about 615 mm (24 in) and minimum rainfall is 307 mm (12 in) and maximum rainfall is 1,591 mm (63 in).\nThe Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.\n\nEconomy\nRamallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country's numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.\nConstruction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.\nRamallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to \"exponential growth\". In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research & development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.\nBy 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and \"five-star\" hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, \"more than one hundred\" Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because \"Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.\" One local boasted to a journalist that \"Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.\" This boast was seconded by The New York Times which, in 2010, called Ramallah the \"de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of This Week in Palestine, \"Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.\" Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah's prosperity is part of an Israeli \"conspiracy\" to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.\n\nDemographics\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the Bire area, \"north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.\" In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 \"other\". The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).\nHowever, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically under Jordanian occupation, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. This left slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants Christian by 1967, and the remainder Muslim.\nRamallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in Washington, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in Michigan. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in Detroit. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.\nRamallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.\nOnly in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.\n\nHealth\nIn the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened.\n\nReligion\nThe Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city's largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city.\n\nChristian presence\nRamallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.\nThere is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph's Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.\nAs of 2022, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened \"The Girls Training Home of Ramallah\" in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional \"Tawjihi\" university exams.\nThe activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.\nIn the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.\n\nCulture\nRamallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians.\nIn 2004 the Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.\n\nPalestinian costume\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\nVillages in the Levant under Ottoman rule remained isolated due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.\n\nInternational relations\nMany foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, as of 2010, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRamallah is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nPaul Ajlouny (b. 1933), Palestinian-American publisher and businessman\nHamze Awawde (b. 1990), Palestinian peace activist\nMahmoud Eid (b. 1993), professional footballer\nAmber Fares, Lebanese Canadian filmmaker\nYasmeen Mjalli (born 1996), American and Palestinian fashion designer, photographer and anti-street harassment activist.\nJibril Rajoub (b. 1953), Palestinian political leader, former militant\nMosab Hassan Yousef (b. 1978), Palestinian ex-militant and defector\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nEconomy of the State of Palestine\nAl-Ram, Palestinian town few km southeast of Ramallah\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRamallah City Archived October 16, 2012, at the Wayback Machine\nWelcome To The City of Ramallah\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:  IAA, Wikimedia commons\nRamallah History\nMusic and Art from Ramallah Archived January 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\nQuaker Meeting in Ramallah\nWest Bank/Palestine\nRamallah\nAl Kasaba Theatre\nKhalil Sakakini Cultural Centre\nFirst Ramallah Group\nRamallah International Film Festival Archived June 17, 2013, at the Wayback Machine\nRamallahOnline.com\nRamallah Club of Metro Detroit\nJnewswire.com, Ramallah ancient synagogue\nAnne Brunswic's book Welcome to Palestine, English translation",
          "summary": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.",

          "content": "رام الله مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة رام الله والبيرة. تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الشمال من القدس بحوالي 15 كم، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 880 مترًا، وتبلغ مساحتها 16,5 كم²، بلغ عدد سكانها حوالي 38,998 نسمة، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان المحافظة حوالي 328,861 نسمة. تلاصق رام الله مدينة البيرة حتى تتداخل مبانيهما وشوارعهما لتبدوا كمدينة واحدة، ومع أن مدينة البيرة أكبر من حيث المساحة وعدد السكان، إلّا أن الأشهر بينهما هي مدينة رام الله.\n\nتحتل رام الله حاليًا مركزًا سياسيًا يجعلها من أهم المدن الفلسطينية، إذ إنها تُعتبر العاصمة الإدارية المؤقتة للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، وفيها إلى جانب مدينة البيرة مقر الرئاسة الفلسطينية، ومبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، والمقرات العامة للأجهزة الأمنية الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية، بالإضافة إلى معظم مكاتب ووزارات السلطة. كما تعتبر العاصمة الثقافية لوجود عدد من المراكز الثقافية الفلسطينية النشطة فيها.\nعُرفت المدينة بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار الصليبيين، ووفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن المدينة قد تأسست في القرن السادس عشر أثناء الحكم العثماني، والتي ازدهرت في آواخر أيامهم إذ تأسس أول مجلس بلدي فيها عام 1908. وقد احتفلت بلدية رام الله مؤخرا بمئويتها الأولى مطلقة مشروعًا تنمويًا بهذه المناسبة.\nتقع رام الله ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، حيث تطل على الساحل الفلسطيني للبحر المتوسط، والذي يبعد عن المدينة حوالي 45 كيلومترا إلى الغرب. أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر بين 770 مترًا. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخيًا منطقة مسيحية، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، مع وجود قوي لأقلية مسيحية.\n\nالتسمية\nتضاربت الأقوال عن تسمية رام الله إذ عرفت في التوراة باسم (رامَتايم صوفيم) وذكرها المؤرخ يوسيفوس باسم (فكولا)، وقيل (جلبات ايلوهم). وقد أثبت الأثريون عدم صحة هذه الأسماء لأن أمكنة الملوك التي نسبت إليهم مثل الملك صموئيل وشاؤول مختلفة عن المدينة الحالية.\nإلا أن هناك تفسيرات أقرب إلى الصحة إذ تعني كلمة رام المنطقة المرتفعة، وهي كلمة كنعانية منتشرة في أماكن مختلفة في فلسطين، وأضاف إليها العرب كلمة الله فأصبحت رام الله، وقد عرفها الصليبيون بهذا الاسم، ولكن الثابت تاريخيا أن قبيلة عربية جاءت في أواخر القرن السادس عشر وسكنت في قرية أو غابة حرجية اسمها رام الله.\n\nالتاريخ\nنظرا لأن رام الله والبيرة تمتدان عمرانيا بشكل متصل، إذ لا يمكن فصل تاريخ المدينتين عن بعضها الآخر، فمن الطبيعي أن يتم دراسة تاريخهما بشكل متكامل. وتشير الدراسات التاريخية والأثرية إلى أن قصة النبي يوسف قد حدثت في منطقة رام الله والبيرة، ولقد اختلف المؤرخون في تحديد البئر الذي ألقي فيه النبي يوسف، وعلى الرغم من هذا الاختلاف فإن موقع البيرة الحالي لا يبتعد كثيرا عن هذه التوقعات بسبب وقوعه على طريق القوافل المتجهة من الجنوب إلى الشمال أو بالعكس، وكان هذا الموقع الذي كانت تحط به الرحال طلباً للراحة والاستجمام وسعياً وراء الطعام والماء، وكان يوجد في البيرة نبع ماء قديم كان معروفا لتلك القوافل، ما حفز الأهالي في ذلك الوقت إلى إقامة أكثر من بناء لتزويد المسافرين بحاجاتهم من الطعام لقاء مال أو مبادلة تجارية، وقد ذكر الإنجيل أن السيد المسيح كان يمر بالبيرة في طريقه من القدس إلى الناصرة (تخلف مع فتيان البيرة الذين كانوا يلهون ويلعبون على نبع الماء وهكذا ضل عن أمه وعن يوسف النجار، مما اضطرها إلى العودة إلى القدس لكي تبحث عنه).\nعند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام في القرن السابع الميلادي دخلت البيرة في حوزة المسلمين، وبنى المسلمون في الفترة الإسلامية المبكرة مسجدين بالقرب من الخان ما زالا مستخدمين حتى اليوم، يعرف الأول منهما باسم «الجامع العمري»، وهو الجامع الملاصق لكنيسة العائلة المقدسة وسط البلدة القديمة، «وجامع العين» الواقع على عين شارع القدس- نابلس بالقرب من مبنى البلدية الحالي. وتغير مركز مدينة البيرة من عصر إلى آخر، ويبدو أن أقدم موقع استوطنه أهل البيرة هو منطقة الإرسال، ثم تل النصبة، ثم عين أم الشرايط، ثم موقع البلدة القديمة الحالي، أما الآن فقد توسعت حدود المدينة فشملت كل هذه المناطق. وفي سنة 1099 وقعت في أيدي الغزاة الفرنجة قبل احتلالهم لمدينة القدس، وأقاموا فيها فترة من الزمن وكانت مركزاً ممتازاً. في عام 1187 عبر جنود المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين البيرة ومن ثم استطاع صلاح الدين انتزاع القدس من أيدي الصليبين.\nكانت رام الله في فترة الحروب الصليبية مستعمرة زراعية إلى جوار البيرة، أطلق الصليبيون عليها اسم \"Ramallie\" أو \"Ramalie\" حيث توجد بقايا برج صليبي في البلدة القديمة لرام الله، ويقال أن رام الله وبعض البلدان الأخرى قد أوقف الملك قلاوون عُشر منتوجات أراضيها على حرم الخليل. إلا أنها لم تكن معروفة حتى القرن السادس عشر بسبب صغر مساحتها وقلة عدد سكانها بالمقارنة بالقرى المحيطة بها.\n\nالدولة العثمانية\nأسست مدينة رام الله على يد شيخ إحدى عشائر الكرك المسيحية يدعى الشيخ راشد الحدادين، قرر الجلو عن موطنه بسبب خلافات عشائرية في القرن السادس عشر. ويحكى أنه جلى من الكرك ليلا وبعد أيام دخل على أهل البيرة فرحبوا به. وأشاروا عليه بخربة اسمها رام الله لتكون موطنه. اشترى الشيخ راشد خربة رام الله من عائلات البيرة القدامى، دون أن يعلم أنه كان يؤسس لمدينة سيكون لها دور هام في تاريخ الفلسطينيين.\nوتجسد تماثيل الأسود الخمسة الواقعة في ساحة المنارة وسط مدينة رام الله تاريخ المدينة، حيث قام النحات أبو صادق غانم بنحتها لترمز لأبناء راشد الحدادين الخمسة، عواد، ويوسف، وجغب، وشقرة، وشراقة، والذين انبثقت منهم عائلات رام الله.\nوقد بدأ في رام الله مع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر تأسيس مدارس كانت من أولى المدارس النظامية في فلسطين، اسمها «الفرندز» وتعني (الأصدقاء)، وهي من المدارس التبشيرية التي بادرت إلى ايجادها جماعة الكويكرز وهي منظمة دينية مسيحية أميركية. وتضم مدرستين في رام الله والبيرة، الأولى للبنات وتعود للعام 1889 والأخرى للصبيان تعود للعام 1901. وكلتاهما تتبعان لمجلس أمناء واحد ويزيد عدد طلابهما الآن عن الألف.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت رام الله بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت رام الله مركزا لقضاء رام الله في تلك الفترة حتى وقوع النكبة. كانت المدنية قد ازدادت أهمية في هذه الفترة نتيجة ثلاثة تطورات مهمة: أولها إنشاء أعمدة الإرسال الشاهقة لـ «محطة الإذاعة الفلسطينية» من قبل حكومة الانتداب البريطانية عام 1936 على أراضي قرية البيرة التي يقع مدخلها على الشارع الرئيسي المتجه إلى قرية بيرزيت وقرى بني زيد. وهو الشارع الذي أصبح اسمه منذ ذلك الحين «شارع الإذاعة» أو «شارع الإرسال». وللشارع أهمية كبيرة في ذلك الوقت نظرا لوجود عدد من الفنادق «كفندق الحمراء» و«فندق حرب» وكان يجذب أهالي مدينة رام الله والقدس أيام الآحاد للاستمتاع بالجلوس في أحضان الطبيعة.\nأما التطور الثاني فقد جاء نتيجة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى 1936-1939، حيث أقامت حكومة الانتداب على غرار ما جرى في بقية المدن الفلسطينية، المبنى الضخم المعروف حاليا بمبنى المقاطعة (مبنى تجاري على اسم المهندس البريطاني الذي صمم هذه المباني لتستوعب الدوائر الحكومية والسجون ...الخ). وبالتالي فقد أصبحت معنية بتوسيع شبكة الطرق القريبة لتستوعب الضغط الناجم عن إنشاء هذا المبنى ومحطة الإذاعة. أما التطور الثالث فكان له علاقة بالهجرة إلى الأميركيتين من قبل سكان رام الله والبيرة وتعاظم ثروة أهل المدينتين مما أدى إلى توسع عمراني كبير على امتداد الشوارع الجديدة وخارج إطار المسطحات القديمة والمتراصة نسبيا.\nوقد أدت هذه التطورات إلى توسيع شبكة الطرق في المدينتين، وخصوصا توسيع وتعبيد طريق الإذاعة وإنجاز خريطة التنظيم الهيكلية لرام الله عام 1940. وهكذا أخذت شبكة الطرق المتفرعة عن الميدان شكلها النهائي رغم أن المنطقة المحيطة بالميدان ظلت في معظمها خالية أساسا من العمران. إذ لم تجر خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية تطورات عمرانية تذكر فظروف الحرب قد حالت دون الحصول على مواد البناء وخصوصا الاسمنت والحديد حيث احتفظت بهما حكومة الانتداب للأغراض الحربية.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكانت رام الله في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء رام الله، التي تم الحاقها بالدولة العربية المُقترحة.\n\nالإدارة الأردنية\nوفي أوائل خمسينيات القرن العشرين خضعت رام الله للحكم الأردني بين حربي 1948 و1967، وأصبحت رام الله فيما بعد مركزا للواء رام الله التابع لمحافظة القدس. وقد كانت المدينة هادئة نسبيا خلال سنوات الحكم الأردني، وكان السكان يتمتعون بحرية الحركة بين الضفة الغربية والأردن ولبنان وسوريا وأماكن أخرى. وكان الأردن بضم الضفة الغربية، يطبق قانونه على الأرض. ومع ذلك، سجن كثير من الفلسطينيين لكونهم أعضاء في ما كانت الحكومة الأردنية تعتبره أحزاب سياسية غير مشروعة، بما في ذلك الحزب الشيوعي الفلسطيني وغيرها من الجماعات الاشتراكية والمؤيدة للاستقلال. وضع القانون الأردني قيودا على الإبداع والحرية المطلوبة من قبل العديد من الفلسطينيين في ذلك الوقت. بحلول عام 1953، تضاعف سكان رام الله، ولكنها لم تكن مجهزة للاقتصاد والبنية التحتية للتعامل مع تدفق القرويين الفقراء. غادر أهالي مدينة رام الله، في المقام الأول إلى الولايات المتحدة. ونظراً لكون مدينة رام الله مركز للواء فقد استأثرت بنصيب وافر من مراكز الخدمات الإدارية والتعليمية والصحية والاجتماعية والاقتصادية يشرف عليها المجلس البلدي والذي قام بتأسيس شركة المياه، وغرفة التجارة تأسست عام 1950م وغايتها تسهيل الأعمال التجارية.\n\nحرب 1967\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي رام الله وقراها وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات، وقد بلغ عدد المستوطنات حتى نهاية عام 1987م حوالي 30 مستوطنة، وأكبر هذه المستوطنات مستوطنة (ريمونيم) وهي قرية تعاونية أنشأت عام 1980م.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة رام الله بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع رام الله مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة رام الله قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\nفي عام 1991، ضم الوفد الفلسطيني إلى مؤتمر مدريد للسلام الدولي العديد من وجهاء رام الله. كما خفت حدة الانتفاضة قدما، واستأنفت الحياة الطبيعية في رام الله. في ديسمبر 1995، وذلك تامشيا مع اتفاق أوسلو، تخلى الجيش الإسرائيلي عن المقاطعة وانسحب إلى ضواحي المدينة. تولت السلطة الفلسطينية التي أنشئت حديثا المدنية والمسؤولية الأمنية للمدينة، والتي اعتبرت «المنطقة أ» الخاضعة للاتفاقات.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 1994 تم نقل الحكم فيها للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية بموجب اتفاق أوسلو الموقع عام 1993، التي أُعلن بموجبه عن مناطق المدينة (دون القرى التابعة لها أو امتداداتها) أنها منطقة ألف (أ)؛ وهذه الأرض تخضع لسيطرة شبه كاملة من السلطة الفلسطينية. أصبحت رام الله المقر المؤقت للسلطة الفلسطينية، وبسبب رفض إسرائيل أن يكون مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في القدس الشرقية. وقد شهدت المدينة نهضة حضارية ومعمارية كبيرة في هذه الفترة.\nتعرّض كثير من تلك المقرات في رام الله إلى دمار كبير ألحقته آلة الحرب الإسرائيلية كجزء من الهجمات المستمرة على المدينة في فترة الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، مما أدّى إلى تعطيلها إلى حدِّ كبير، وعادت هذه المقرات للعمل في الفترة اللاحقة للاجتياح الإسرائيلي الكبير للمدينة في عام 2002 جاعلة رام الله العاصمة الإدارية (كأمر واقع) لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية. يشار بالذكر إلى أن حكومة نتنياهو شرعت في إعداد دراسة تهدف إلى إقناع الفلسطينيين بأهمية مدينة رام الله كعاصمة بديلة من القدس الشرقية. وتركز الدراسة على التذكير بمواقف إسحق رابين الذي ثبت مدينة القدس بقسميها الغربي والشرقي، عاصمة أبدية موحدة لدولة اليهود، ومع أنه وافق على فصل الشأن السياسي عن الشأن الديني، ووعد المسلمين والمسيحيين بممارسة شعائرهم في ظل القانون الإسرائيلي، إلا أنه أخضع وعده لضرورات الأمن القومي. لهذا السبب لم يسمح لياسر عرفات بزيارة القدس خوفاً من الجماهير التي ستستقبله.\n\nالجغرافيا\nرام الله مدينة جبلية، مبنية على جبال مطلة إلى الغرب على الساحل الفلسطيني، أما من جهة الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطة بالجبال. تبعد رام الله حوالي عشرة 15 كم إلى الشمال من القدس وتبعد المدينة عن البحر المتوسط الذي يرى من تلالها حوالي 45 كيلومترا هوائيا وكثيرا ما تشاهد منها أثناء النهار السفن الراسية، كما تبعد عن نهر الأردن قرابة 33 كم إلى الغرب. ونظرا لقرب البحر منها فإن الهواء الذي يهب عليها من الغرب يحمل معه بعض الرطوبة ولكن ارتفاع البلدة عن سطح البحر الذي يتراوح بين 830-880 مترا يلطف من هذه الرطوبة. وتبلغ مساحة مدينة رام الله 19 ألف دونم، واتخذت مجالس بلدية سابقة قرارا بتوسيع حدود المدينة إلى ألفي دونم أخرى.\nويتوسط موقع رام الله فلسطين التاريخية تقريبا، حيث تبعد عن نابلس 36 كم إلى الجنوب، وجنين 63 كم إلى الجنوب، والخليل 82 كم إلى الشمال، وغزة 82 كم إلى الشمال الشرقي، ويافا 45 كم إلى الشرق، وحيفا 105 كم إلى الجنوب الشرقي.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى 19 حيًا وهي: الريحان، الدبلوماسي، الكرينعة، الواد، النرجس، الطيرة، المصايف، الإذاعة، ردانا، عين مصباح، الجدول، قدورة، القديرة، الماصيون، عين منجد، باطن الهواء، مركز المدينة، البلدة القديمة والمنطقة الصناعية. أما بالنسبة للطرق، فتقطع رام الله عدة طرق تربط مناطقها ببعض، كما تربطها بالمدن الملتصقة بها كـالبيرة وبيتونيا، وباقي قرى ومدن فلسطين المجاورة كالقدس وبيت لحم ونابلس، والتي قامت بلدية رام الله بتسميتها على أسماء لمناطق وشخصيات فلسطينية أو عالمية، ومن أهم هذه الطرق:\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ رام الله هو مناخ متوسطي ففي الشتاء تتعرض البلدة للرياح الجنوبية الغربية القاسية الماطرة وأحيانا إلى رياح شمالية شرقية جافة باردة نسبيا. أما معدل سقوط الأمطار هو حوالي 20 إنشا أو 500 مليمتر في السنة. وعلى العموم فإن معدل درجة الحرارة في الشتاء نادرا ما يصل إلى 32 فهرنهايت أو صفر مئوي وفي الصيف قلما تزيد على 95 ف أو 35 درجة مئوية ويمكننا القول بأن معدل درجة الحرارة السنوي يتراوح بين 41-77 ف أو 5-25 م.\nوفي أوائل نيسان تأخذ الرياح الخماسينية بالهبوب وهذه رياح جافة تحمل معها كثيرا من الغبار وهي تأتينا من الجنوب وينقطع هبوب الرياح الخماسينية كلما اقترب فصل الصيف وتهب أيضا على البلدة رياح دافئة في أواخر الصيف وأوائل الخريف وتعجل بإنهاء موسمي العنب والتين. وعلى العموم فإن مناخ رام الله لطيف منعش في الصيف دافئ في الشتاء وهذا جعل الحياة فيها حياة نشاط وعمل.\n\nالسكان\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان المدينة في فترات مختلفة:\n\nيبلغ عدد سكان رام الله اليوم قرابة 30 ألف نسمة. وبالرغم من أن رام الله كانت مدينة صغيرة، إلا أن اللاجئين الفلسطينيين بعد النكبة عام 1948 شكلوا جزءا رئيسيا من التوزيع السكاني الجديد، كما أن الهجرة الداخلية وانتقال فلسطينيين للعمل في رام الله بعد قدوم سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينية جراء تحولها إلى مركز إداري للسلطة زاد من عدد السكان المستقرين القادمين من مدن أخرى.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكان رام الله عام 1922م حوالي 3067 نسمة، وفي عام 1945م 5080 نسمة، وفي عام 1967م بلغ عدد سكانها حسب الإحصاء الإسرائيلي 12134 نسمة، ارتفع هذا العدد ليصل عام 1987م حوالي 24772 نسمة.\nتتمتع رام الله عن باقي المدن الفلسطينية باستمرارية وتعددية بالنشاطات الثقافية بين المهرجانات والندوات والمؤتمرات والمعارض، ويعود ذلك إلى عدة إسباب، أحدها تمركز عدد كبير من المؤسسات الناشطة في هذا المجال في مدينة رام الله إضافة إلى نشاط بلدية رام الله في هذا المجال ووجود وزارة الثقافة التابعة لسلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني في المدينة. وكذلك تنوع النسيج الثقافي الاجتماعي في المدينة وإتساع هامش الحرية مما جذب العديد من الشخصيات الثقافية إلى مدينة رام الله من مخرجين وكتّاب وشعراء.\nمن المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطان ومتحف محمود درويش والمركز الثقافي اليوناني والمؤسسة الفلسطينية للفن المعاصر والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي الألماني.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتعكس رام الله صورة مدينة مزدهرة تشهد حركة أعمال محمومة وفورة عقارية كست تلالها بالمباني، غير ان هذه المدينة التي تحتضن مقر السلطة الفلسطينية في الضفة الغربية تبقى استثناء في مشهد اقتصادي عام هش.\nولقد مارس سكان مدينة رام الله والبيرة العديد من الحرف منذ القدم، منها الزراعة وتربية المواشي حيث زرعوا العنب والتين والزيتون، واشتغل السكان في التجارة حيث تنقل التجار بين المدن والقرى المجاورة، كما اشتغل السكان في الصناعة مثل صناعة الأحذية والملابس والمواد الغذائية والفخار واستمر الحال حتى أوائل القرن العشرين، حيث اتجه السكان إلى الهجرة إلى أمريكا خصوصا الشباب منهم، فأخذت الأموال تتدفق على المدينة ليستثمرها السكان في شراء الأراضي وبناء العقارات لاستغلالها في السياحة، وازدادت حركة التعليم وما أن انتهت الحرب العالمية الثانية حتى وقعت حرب 1948 فكان معظم سكان المدينة قد هاجروا إلى أمريكا باستثناء 12% منهم بقوا في المدينة.\nتوجد حاليا العديد من الصناعات مثل صناعة الورق الصحي والكرتون والأثاث والمواد الغذائية وعصر الزيتون والصابون والألمنيوم والأدوية والكثير من الحرف اليدوية والتقليدية.\nأما بالنسبة للزراعة فقد اضمحلت بسبب هجرة السكان للأراضي الزراعية وتحويلها بنايات لتأخذ مكان البيوت القديمة وأصبحت المدينة تعج بمئات المحال التجارية الممتدة.\nومن الملاحظ أن تكلفة المعيشة في مدينة رام الله هي أعلى مستوى من نظيراتها في المحافظات الأخرى، ويمكن إرجاع السبب إلى عدة عوامل، أهمها وجود شريحة واسعة في رام الله يفوق مستوى دخلها معدل الدخل لباقي سكان رام الله وباقي سكان المحافظات الأخرى نظرا لعمل هذه الشريحة مع المؤسسات الأجنبية والدولية ما يجعلها قادرة على تحمّل هذه النفقات، وثانياً وجود عدد كبير من الأجانب العاملين في رام الله ذوي الدخل المرتفع جداً بالمقارنة مع المواطن العادي مما تسبب في زيادة الأسعار على كافة المستويات وبالذات العقار والمنافع الخدماتية كالمطاعم والقاعات، بالإضافة إلى وجود تحويلات شبه دائمة من المغتربين من سكان قراها الشرقية والتي معظم أفرادها مغتربون في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، وهنالك أمثلة صارخة للقرى الشرقية للمدينة التي حققت أعلى النسب في اغتراب أفرادها إلى الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. ويمكن اليوم أن يُقارن مستوى المعيشة في المدينة بنظيره في مدن عالمية أخرى. يشار إلى أنه يُقام كل عام معرضٌ للصناعات الفلسطينية في مدينة رام الله.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيمكن السفر إلى المدن المجاورة لرام الله بواسطة سيارة أجرة أو حافلات صغيرة. سيارات الأجرة متوفرة دائما في جميع أنحاء مدينة رام الله، كذلك بالنسبة للحافلات أو الحافلات الصغيرة. ويتنقل المواطنون الفلسطينيون بين رام الله والمدن والقرى المجاورة - منذ انتفاضة الأقصى - بصعوبة بالغة، حيث يعاني المواطن وفي كثيراً من الأحيان الامرّين حتى يصل إلى مبتغاه في الوقت المحدد وربما لا يصله إطلاقاً، مرد ذلك الإجراءات الإسرائيلية من حواجز واغلاقات.\nيقع جنوب رام الله في بلدة قلنديا، مطار القدس الدولي أو كما تشيع تسميته «مطار قلنديا»، يقع على أراضي محافظة القدس تحديداً في بلدة قلنديا على طريق (القدس - رام الله). يعتبر المطار أقرب إلى رام الله منه إلى مدينة القدس.\nأنشيء المطار عام 1920 تحت إدارة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين ثم في أوائل الخمسينيات وضع تحت الإدارة الأردنية بعد انضمام الضفة الغربية إلى المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، إلا أنه وقع بيد القوات الإسرائيلية في حرب 1967، والتي سرعان ما غيرت اسمه إلى «مطار عطاروت». ومنذ انتفاضة الأقصى والمطار مهمل بالرغم من أنه تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. شهد المطار حركة سياحية وتجارية نشطة في الخمسينيات والستينيات، وقد استخدمه الكثير من المسافرين وأصحاب الشخصيات الهامة مثل بابا الفاتيكان على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، وذلك لأهمية القدس الدينية والسياحية.\n\nالاتصالات\nتقع في رام الله مقرات شركات الاتصال الفلسطينية التي تزود الضفة الغربية بهذه الخدمة (جوال والوطنية موبايل). تأسست مجموعة الإتصالات الفلسطينية عام 1995 في رام الله، وكانت أول شركة اتصالات مملوكة للقطاع الخاص في العالم العربي وباشرت أعمالها في يناير عام 1997 كمشغل ومقدم لكافة أنواع خدمات الاتصالات في فلسطين. تتكون المجموعة اليوم من شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية، وشركة جوال المزود الفلسطيني الأول لخدمة الاتصال الخلوي في فلسطين وشركة «حضارة» لخدمات الاتصالات وتكنولوجيا المعلومات بالإضافة إلى شركة «حلول» لتكنولوجية المعلومات وشركة «بال ميديا» لتقديم الخدمات المرئية والإعلامية المميزة. بالإضافة إلى هذه الشركات تقوم شركة الوطنية موبايل بتزويد خدمات الاتصالات الخليوية أيضا، والتي اطلقت خدماتها تجارياً في 2009.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nتمتاز مدينة رام الله بغناها المعماري وتطورها الاجتماعي والذي انعكس عبر مبانيها وحاراتها وتجمع ساكنيها، حيث يشعر الزائر بمتابعة بصرية جميلة تعطيه الإحساس والشعور بكينونته كإنسان بمقاييسها الإنسانية والإحساس بالزمن ببعديه الماضي والمستقبلي للواجهات والأسقف والخانات والأزقة. وتعتبر المدينة أكبر تجمع من حيث عدد المباني القديمة في محافظة رام الله، بحيث تحتوي على 381 مبنى قديماً، وتشكل ما نسبته 5 % من عدد المباني الكلي في المحافظة، وتليها بذلك رنتيس، حيث تحتوي على 326 مبنى، ثم نعلين بـ 292 مبنى، ومن ثم عابود بـ 281 مبنى قديماً.\nوقد تأسس في بداية تسعينيات القرن الفائت، مركز معني بالحفاظ على الهوية المعمارية الفلسطينية القديمة في رام الله، اسمه: مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\"، والذي عمل على تحضير مخططات حماية للمباني في التجمعات، وبخاصة تلك التي ما زالت تحافظ على مراكزها ونسيجها المعماري القديم، وكذلك تلك التي تحتوي على عدد كبير من المباني القديمة، بحيث تتم حماية أكبر نسبة ممكنة من المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية بعض التجمعات، ولذلك يمكن حماية ما نسبته 35.41 % من عدد المباني القديمة بمجرد حماية التجمعات التي تحتوي على أكثر من 200 مبنى قديم.\nوقد قامت وحدة التخطيط في مركز رواق، باعداد مخطط الحفاظ على التراث الثقافي للبلدة القديمة في رام الله. حيث تم تعيين حدود وجميع فئات التراث الثقافي في المنطقة التاريخية (من مباني تاريخية، وأحواش، وأزقة...ألخ) وذلك بناءً على الدراسة الميدانية التي قام بها فريق العمل في الموقع.\nنتيجة ذلك تم تقسيم البلدة القديمة إلى منطقتين: «منطقة تاريخية أ» والتي تتميز بنسيج معماري تقليدي وعدد كبير من المباني التاريخية، و«منطقة تاريخية ب» والتي لم تعد تحتفظ بنسيج معماري تقليدي بالرغم من وجود عدد لا بأس به من المباني التاريخية. هذا وتم تعين كل المباني التاريخية المنفردة خارج هاتين المنطقتين.\nكما وتم وضع مسودة أحكام خاصة لتنظيم أعمال البناء في تللك المناطق، والتي تم نقاشها مطولاً مع لجنة أحياء البلدة القديمة المكونة من أعضاء في مجلس بلدية رام الله. هذا وتم اقرار جزء من هذه الأحكام من قبل لجنة التنظيم في البلدية.\n\nالثقافة والسياحة\nإن ما يميز مدينة رام الله هو هذا التناغم والتنوع والاختلاف في إطار الوحدة، ولكثرة من رغب بالسكن في رام الله بسبب هذا الميل العام نحو قبول الآخر، جعل منها مكان جذب للكثيرين من مختلف المناطق والبيئات والأديان ممن بحثوا عن الأمن والأمان. وقد خلق هذا الأمر أيضاً تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً فريداً، ووجد الجميع فيه ما يصبون إليه فتشكلت هذه المدينة المنوعة في ثقافتها وتوجهاتها في إطار من التواصل الغريب.\nتعتبر رام الله مركز للحياه الثقافية والأكثر انفتاحا وليبرالية في الضفة الغربية، ما دفع البعض إلى تسميتها «روح الثقافة» فهي تضم العديد من المكتبات مثل: مكتبة دار الإذاعة ومكتبة رام الله العامة بالإضافة إلى العديد من المراكز الثقافية على تنوعها، فهناك العاملة في إطار الفنون البصرية، أو السينما أو المسرح، أو الرقص الشعبي والمعاصر، أو الشعر والأدب والنشر، أو المؤسسات الموسيقية.\nوتعتبر رام الله مركزا للعديد من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية كالمركز الثقافي الألماني الفرنسي، والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، والمركز الثقافي اليوناني.\nولتطريز الأثواب في رام الله نكهة خاصة فهي لغة للتعبير وحالة نادرة ومميزة عن بقية المناطق الأخرى، بحيث يدمج بين الأشكال الهندسية والمجردة المستطيلة (كالمربعات، والنجوم) وبين الصور الرمزية، ما يعكس الحياة اليومية لأهل رام الله وسكانها. ومن أهم المهرجانات التي تقام خصيصا من أجل الحفاظ على هذا التراث، مهرجان الوفاء للتراث وارث الأجداد السنوي الذي ينظمه نادي شباب رام الله، حيث يتم تنظيم عرضاً للأزياء التراثية الفلسطينية.\nكما وتضم عددا من المراكز الرياضية، والأندية الشبابية الفاعلة، والتي يعود تأسيس بعضها إلى بدايات القرن الماضي، في حين تضم بعض هذه الأندية فرقا كشفية عريقة كان لها حضورها على مدار التاريخ الفلسطيني. من المؤسسات العاملة في مجال الثقافة في المدينة مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد إدوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبة ومؤسسة سرية رام الله الأولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلدية المدينة ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسة الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطة ومؤسسة تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسة عبد المحسن القطّان، والتي تعمل على تفعيل الحياة الثقافية في فلسطين من خلال إنتاج أعمال مسرحية واستضافة عروض فنية في مجالات المسرح والموسيقى والرقص بالإضافة إلى عرض الأفلام السينمائية اليومية وتنظيم الأسابيع والمهرجانات السينمائية المتخصصة.\nوتضم رام الله كذلك، عددا من الجمعيات الخيرية، النسوية في مجملها، ويعود تأسيس بعضها إلى أربعينيات القرن الماضي، وتهدف هذه الجمعيات التي تضاعفت أعدادها مرارا في العقدين الأخيرين، إلى توفير الدعم للعديد من فئات المجتمع، ومن بينها المرأة، الطفل، كبار السن، ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة، الأيتام، وغيرهم.\n\nتعتبر مدينة رام الله واحدة من المدن الفلسطينية التي يؤمها السياح، وتشكل وجهة رئيسية لهم في جولاتهم السياحية، ولا بد للسائح أن يزور مواقعها الأثرية التي تقسم إلى: أنقاض بناء أثري فيه بقايا برج من حقبة الصليبيين يقع في وسط المدينة، وآثار كنيسة بيزنطية في المدينة.\nوبالرغم من أن المدينة ليست من المدن القديمة جدا إلا أنها تعد أكثر المناطق الفلسطينية جذبا للزائرين على المستوى العالمي والعربي عامة والفلسطينيين خاصة، آخذين بعين الاعتبار أن هذه المدينة مركزا اقتصاديا مهما، وخاصة بعد أن أصبحت مقرا للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية، ومركزا للمؤسسات الأجنبية، والممثليات الدبلوماسية، كما ومقرا لمؤسسات ووزارات السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية...الخ، مما ساهم بشكل فعال في تطور هذه المدينة من كافة النواحي وخاصة سياحيا، فازدحام المدينة يعني بناء المرافق السياحية الكبيرة والحديثة القادرة على تلبية احتياجات ساكنيها، وهذا من شأنه أن يزيد الدخل القومي بشكل كبير. ويوجد في المدينة مركزا معني بالسياحة هو مركز رام الله للمعلومات السياحية الذي تأسس بدعم سويدي وبالتعاون مع وزارة السياحة الفلسطينية ومركز رواق للمعمار الشعبي. وهناك الكثير من الآثار الواقعة في قرى وبلدات قضاء رام الله، فمثلا توجد قلعة حصينة لا تزال آثارها ظاهرة حتى الآن في بيرزيت، مبنى عثماني ضخم في قرية رأس كركر، وآثار كنيسة وقطع معمارية تعود إلى الفترات البيزنطية في قرية جفنا، كما يوجد في قرية عابود الكثير من الأديرة والكنائس المندثرة منذ عهد هيلانة وإبنها قسطنطين، وفيها أيضا مسجد قديم وكنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس. ويزور رام الله سنويا 300,000 سائح. يشار إلى أن السياحة في المدينة كغيرها من مدن فلسطين، تواجه العديد من المشاكل والعقبات، ولعل أول تلك العقبات هو الاحتلال الإسرائيلي الذي يؤثر سلبا بدعاياته المغرضة على السياح الأجانب، ويسعى إلى ضرب قطاع السياحة في المدينة. كذلك ينافس الإسرائيليون السياحة الفلسطينية نظرا لخبرتهم في التسويق.\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nبدأ التعليم في رام الله في مدرسة للروم الاورثوذكس أنشاتها البطريركية في القدس حوالي 1840، عندما حضر مبشر من طائفة البروتستانت اسمه صموئيل غوبات وأسس خمس مدارس إحداها في رام الله، وهي مدرسة تبشيرية، بينما كانت الأولى الأرثوذكسية مدرسة وطنية، وظلت مدرسة غوبات مفتوحة حتى قبل الحرب العالمية الأولى، وفي سنة 1857 قدم اللاتين إلى رام الله، وافتتحوا لهم مدرسة لم تعمر طويلا، أما عن مدارس الإناث، فقد أسست جماعة الفرندز في عام 1889 أول مدرسة من نوعها للإناث في رام الله. والأولى من نوعها في فلسطين، وكان افتتاح هذه المدرسة حافزاً للروم الأرثوذكس لإنشاء مدرسة للبنات، وحذا حذوهم اللاتين، وفي عام 1901 افتتح الفرندز مدرسة البنين في رام الله.\nوفي رام الله اليوم ثلاث مدارس حكومية للذكور ومدرستان للإناث، وبعد عام 1950 افتتحت بعض المعاهد مثل معهد المعلمات الحكومي والحق بالمعهد مدرسة للتطبيقات والتجارب التربوية والتعليم فيها مختلط، ولوكالة الغوث أربع مدارس للذكور ومدرستان للإناث في رام الله كما يتبع وكالة الغوث مركز لتدريب المعلمين والفتيات وهناك سبع مدارس خاصة مختلطة وثلاث مدارس خاصة للإناث وواحدة للذكور ودار لرعاية الأحداث وكلية بيرزيت التي تحولت إلى جامعة وتعتبر من أهم الجامعات الفلسطينية.\nكما أن مدينة رام الله تعتبر مركزاً للنشاط الثقافي في الضفة الغربية إذ تمتلئ بالمسارح ودور السينما والمراكز الثقافية، وفيها المعهد الوطني للموسيقى ومجموعة كبيرة من المنتديات الثقافية.\nالتعليم العالي\nتقع في محافظة رام الله واحدة من الجامعات المميزة فلسطينيا وعربيا، وهي جامعة بيرزيت. يعود تاريخ جامعة بيرزيت إلى عام 1924 عندما تأسست كمدرسة ابتدائية، وكان الهدف الرئيسي للمدرسة توفير فرص التعليم الأولية للفتيات من بيرزيت والقرى المجاورة في وقت انعدمت فيه المدارس تقريباً في تلك المنطقة.\nتطورت المدرسة لتصبح كلية عام 1942، ولما كانت الكلية عندئذ هي المؤسسة الجامعية الوحيدة في المنطقة، فقد قررت التركيز على التعليم الجامعي، وتقرر أن تصبح الكلية نتيجة لذلك «جامعة بيرزيت» في 1972.\n\nالرياضة\nتلعب في محافظة رام الله العديد من الأندية سواء على مستوى كرة القدم أو كرة السلة، منها: مؤسسة شباب البيرة، دير عمار، الجلزون، شباب الامعري، أرثوذكسي رام الله، سلواد، بدو، بيت سيرا، وبير زيت الرياضي. ويشارك بعضها في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز. ويوجد في المدينة ملعبا بلديا يتسع لعدة الآف.\nيقام في مدينة رام الله سباق ماراثون يحمل اسم «القدس عاصمة فلسطين الأبدية»، وذلك رداً على سباق مماثل أقيم في المدينة المحتلة بمشاركة آلاف العدائين الإسرائيليين والأجانب وسط موجة غضب في الشارع الفلسطيني. كما بدأت بلدية رام الله بأعمال الإنشاء لمشروع صالة رام الله الرياضية. ويأتي مشروع الصالة الرياضية كجزء من الخطة التنموية للبلدية.\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من رام الله الكثير من المشاهير الفلسطينيين منهم:\n\nكمال ناصر: سياسي وشاعر فلسطيني شارك في إصدار جريدة (البعث) كما أصدر مجلة الجيل الجديد عام 1949 في القدس. انتخب عام 1969 عضواً في اللجنة التنفيذية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، واغتيل من قبل قوة كوماندوز إسرائيلية وهناك قاعة ومسرح يحملان اسمه في جامعة بيرزيت.\nكريم حنا خلف: ترأس مجلس بلدية رام الله عام 1972 بعد فوزه بالانتخابات. كان عضوا بارزا في الجبهة الوطنية الفلسطينية وقياديا بارزا في لجنة التوجيه الوطني التي كانت تشرف بتوجيه من منظمة التحرير على النضال الوطني ضد الاحتلال.\nموسى حديد: مهندس، شغل منصب رئيس مجلس بلدي رام الله بين عامي 2012 و2022. كما يرأس الاتحاد الفلسطيني للهيئات المحلية للدورة الثانية على التوالي.\nخليل أبو ريا: مدرس وأديب ومرب معروف في رام الله إذ ترك أثرا كبيرا في عقول ونفوس وذكريات الكثيرين من أبناء هذه المدينة. وضع كتابا بعنوان «رام الله قديما وحديثا». وهو المؤسس والمالك للكلية الوطنية، أهم مدارس رام الله.\nفؤاد عيسى شطارة: طبيب فلسطيني. اهتم بالقضايا الوطنية والسياسية وشارك في تأسيس الجمعية التهذيبية السورية التي اهتمت بتعليم الطلاب العرب المتفوقين من الفقراء. وترأس جمعية النهضة الفلسطينية للدفاع عن قضية فلسطين كما ترأس عام 1936 الجامعة العربية في نيويورك.\nبولس شحادة: كاتب وصحفي، أسس جريدة مرآة الشرق في القدس 1919 وهي جريدة يومية سياسية اجتماعية تصدر باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية.\nنسيب شاهين: قام بتأليف كتاب مصور عن رام الله احتوى 445 صورة من أصل 600 صورة.\nمصطفى البرغوثي: أمين عام المبادرة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتميم البرغوثي: أحد أشهر الشعراء الشباب في فلسطين والوطن العربي. وهو ابن الشاعر مريد البرغوثي والكاتبة رضوى عاشور.\nمروان البرغوثي قيادي في حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني فتح، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nأحمد سعدات: أمين عام الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين، معتقل في سجون إسرائيل منذ سنوات.\nحنان عشراوي: سياسية فلسطينية، كانت أحد أعضاء الوفد الفلسطيني المفاوض في مؤتمر مدريد عام 1991.\nسعاد العامري: أحد أشهر المعماريات الفلسطينيات. تعمل على الحفاظ على الموروث المعماري الفلسطيني من خلال مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\" والذي تديره منذ 1991.\nمحمد صالح البرغوثي أسس الجمعية العربية السرية ثم أسس حزب البعث في فلسطين وأصبح رئيساً له ثم اتجه إلى الحزب الوطني ثم إلى حزب الاستقلال، توفى عام 1970.\nخليل محمد عيسى أحد قادة الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى.\n\nالمعالم\nرام الله تحت الاحتلال\nمنذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية للفلسطينيين ضد الاحتلال الإسرائيلي واجتياح جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مدن الضفة الغربية في خريف عام 2000، كانت مدينة رام الله من المدن الرئيسية في مواجهة العمليات الإسرائيلية بعد مدن جنين، نابلس، طولكرم، الخليل، هذا وقد فرضت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية حظر التجول على المدينة، وخنقت سكانها وعزلتهم عن مدينة القدس حيث يقطن الكثير من أقربائهم.\nو تعيش مدينة رام الله اليوم ظروف صعبة، بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي ومصادرة الكثير من أراضيها من قبل الاحتلال بواسطة جدار الفصل العنصري، والمستوطنين اليهود.\nومع مرور سنوات عديدة على الانتفاضة الثانية، إلا أن مدينة رام الله وأهلها نجحوا في الحفاظ على نشاط اقتصادي عالي وثقافي مميز، مما جعل المدينة أفضل المدن الفلسطينية حالا في ظل الاحتلال.\n\nالمخيمات\nيوجد في منطقة رام الله، 4 مخيمات 3 منها مُسجلة رسميا في وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) وواحد غير مسجل، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفة الغربية، فقد بُني معظمها فوق قطعة من الأرض قامت الأونروا باستئجارها من الحكومة الأردنية. والمخيمات هي:\n\nمخيم الأمعري: قام الصليب الأحمر بتأسيس مخيم الأمعري في عام 1949 ضمن حدود بلدية البيرة، حيث قام بتوفير الخيام للاجئين الذين قدموا من مدن اللد ويافا والرملة، بالإضافة إلى الذين لجئوا من قرى بيت دجن ودير طريف وأبو شوشة والنعاني وصيدون وجمزو وبيت نبالا. وقد تسلمت الأونروا مسؤولية المخيم في عام 1950 وعملت على بناء وحدات سكنية ذات أسقف اسمنتية. وبحلول عام 1957، كانت الأونروا قد أتمت استبدال كافة الخيام بالمساكن الاسمنتية؛ حيث حصلت العائلات التي لا يزيد عدد أفرادها عن خمسة أشخاص على مسكن مؤلف من غرفة واحدة فيما حصلت العائلات الأكبر على مساكن من غرفتين. واليوم، فإن المخيم يغطي مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,93 كيلومتر مربع، ويفصل بين معظم المساكن مساحة تقل عن نصف متر؛ الأمر الذي يجعل التهوية داخل المخيم ضعيفة للغاية. ويرتبط المخيم بشكل كامل بشبكتي الماء والكهرباء البلدية.\nمخيم الجلزون: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.25 كيلومتر مربع على تلة صخرية تبعد مسافة 7 كيلومترات شمال رام الله. وينحدر أصل سكان المخيم من 36 قرية تابعة لمناطق اللد والرملة. وأصبح المخيم تحت السيطرة الإسرائيلية الفلسطينية المشترك في أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو. وتتصل كافة المساكن بالبنية التحتية لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامة.\nمخيم دير عمار: تأسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.16 كيلومتر مربع على بعد 30 كيلومتر إلى الشمال الغربي من رام الله. وقد بني المخيم فوق قطعة من الأرض تعود ملكيتها لسكان قرية دير عمار غير اللاجئين. وفي المقابل، فإن منشآت الأونروا في المخيم تعمل على توفير خدماتها للقرويين من غير اللاجئين.\nوتنحدر أصول سكان المخيم من القرى المدمرة التابعة لمناطق الرملة ويافا واللد. وفي أعقاب اتفاقيات أوسلو، أصبح المخيم واقعا تحت السيطرة المشتركة الفلسطينية الإسرائيلية.\n\nمخيم قدورة: يقع داخل مدينة رام الله بالقرب من مستشفى رام الله الحكومي من جهة الشمال، يبلغ عدد سكانه في منتصف العام 2023 نحو 1040 لاجئ حسب تقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. معظم سكان المخيم من المدن والقرى المهجرة عام 1948 منها: دير طريف، واللد، والسافرية، وبيت نبالا، والرملة، ولفتا، وأبو غوش، والقباب، ويافا، وسلمة، وزكريا، والحديثة، وعمواس، ويالو؛ ومن نازحي عام 1967.\n\nالمستوطنات\nما ان اندلعت حرب 1967 والتي كانت نتائجها احتلال ما تبقى من ارض فلسطين - الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة، حتى سارعت إسرائيل في وضع الخطط بهدف اقامة العديد من المستوطنات. وكانت رام الله جزءا من هذا المخطط، حيث بنت إسرائيل في منطقة رام الله حوالي 27 مستوطنة وهي:\nمستوطنات تتوسط مجموعة من البلدات الفلسطينية وهي: المدية، نعلين، دير قديس، حزما، عين حارث، بلعين، أم صفا وبيت سيرا:\n\nمكابيم أب\nكفار روث\nمستوطنة منورة\nشلتا نتتياهو\nحشمونائيم\nكريات سيفر\nوهناك مستوطنات تطوق مدينة رام الله وتسيطر على معظم أراضيها، وهي من الشرق:\n\nتلمون\nياد يائير\nبيت حورون\nجفعات زئيف\nبيت إيل\nبسجوت\nكوخاف يعقوب\nومن الجنوب:\n\nمستوطنة عطروت\nجفعون\nجفعات حداشا أ\nجبعات حدشاة ب\nأما التجمع الاستيطاني شمال شرق رام الله، فيضم مستوطنات: عوفرا، بيت إيل أ، بيت إيل بمعسكر (باعل حتسور)، الذي يطل على منطقة الأغوار الوسطى وأريحا والبحر الميت، على ارتفاع 800 متر عن سطح البحر، وهو ذو أهمية إستراتيجية؛ نظراً لارتفاعه وإشرافه على مساحات واسعة من مناطق وسط الضفة، ويبلغ عدد المستوطنين في ذلك التجمع نحو 5370 مستوطناً. ويشغل مساحة تبلغ أكثر من 2000 دونم.\n\nمدن متوأمة\nالمدن الشقيقة لرام الله هي:\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\n\nموقع بلدية رام الله\nغرفة تجارة وصناعة محافظة رام

          "content": "Ramallah (en arabe : رام الله) est une ville palestinienne située au centre de la Cisjordanie, territoire occupé par Israël depuis 1967. Elle est la capitale administrative de facto de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne ; la capitale officielle, Jérusalem-Est, ayant été annexée par Israël en 1982.\nLa population, initialement composée principalement de Palestiniens chrétiens, comprend, depuis 1948, de nombreux réfugiés musulmans issus de toute la Palestine. L'estimation de la population de la ville, pour 2025, est de 45 644 habitants. Ses habitants s'appellent les Ramallawi.\nYasser Arafat est inhumé dans un mausolée situé dans l'enceinte de la Mouqata'a, quartier général de l'Autorité palestinienne, situé dans la ville.\n\nHistoire\nLes premiers temps\nLa ville de Ramallah fut fondée au milieu du XVe siècle par les Haddadéens, tribu issue des Arabes chrétiens ghassanides. Les Haddadéens, menés par Rached Haddadéen, sont arrivés de l'Est du Jourdain, près de l'emplacement contemporain de la ville jordanienne de Chawbak. La migration de cette tribu est due aux nombreux combats et tensions entre les clans de cette région.\nSelon la légende locale, le frère de Rached, Sabri l'Haddadéen, accueillait l'émir Ibn Kaysoom, chef d'un puissant clan musulman, quand la femme de Sabri donna naissance à une fille. Selon la coutume, l'émir proposa qu'elle se marie à son tout jeune fils quand ils seraient tous deux adultes. Sabri crut que cette proposition n'était pas sérieuse, les mariages entre chrétiens et musulmans étant rares, et lui donna sa parole. Des années après, quand l'émir revint voir les Haddadéens pour qu'ils tiennent leur promesse, ils refusèrent. Ceci déclencha une guerre sanglante entre les deux familles. Les Haddadéens fuirent vers l'ouest et s'établirent dans les collines de Ramallah, où vivaient déjà quelques familles musulmanes.\n\nInstallation chrétienne\nTout au long des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, Ramallah s'agrandit pour devenir un village agricole, attirant ainsi davantage d'habitants (surtout chrétiens) de toute la région. Au début du XVIIIe siècle, la première église orthodoxe arabe est bâtie, puis une autre en 1807. Il y a entre huit-cents et neuf-cents habitants en 1838.\nL'église de l'Épiphanie, édifiée pour remplacer l'ancienne en 1852, est la seule église orthodoxe à Ramallah aujourd'hui. Durant cette décennie, l'Église catholique s'établit dans la ville, devenant le deuxième groupe chrétien à Ramallah. Elle établit l'école de filles Saint-Joseph, ainsi que le lycée mixte al-Ahliyyah, tenu par les religieuses du Rosaire.\nLes quakers anglais arrivent en 1869 et ouvrent une école de filles et un internat d'une quinzaine de garçons en 1901.\n\nÉglises de Ramallah\nÉglise Notre-Dame-de-l'Annonciation (melkite) 1895\nÉglise de l'Épiphanie (grecque-orthodoxe)\nÉglise de la Sainte-Famille (catholique latine)\nCathédrale copte-orthodoxe\nÉglise de l'Espérance (luthérienne-évangélique)\nMaison de prières des quakers\n\nDébut du XXe siècle\nLes autorités ottomanes construisent en 1901 une nouvelle route de Jérusalem à Naplouse passant par Ramallah et Al-Bireh. La jeunesse chrétienne de la ville commence à émigrer aux États-Unis au début du XXe siècle. La ville devient un district en 1902, englobant trente villages et bourgades des alentours.\nLa ville de Ramallah devient une municipalité en 1908 et Élias Odeh en est le premier maire. Le conseil municipal est composé de membres de chaque grande famille.\nAu début de la Première Guerre mondiale, les habitants se rebellent contre l'autorité ottomane. Trente habitants sont tués. En 1915, une invasion de criquets migrateurs détruit les récoltes et l'année suivante, une épidémie de typhoïde décime 30 % de la population.\n\nOccupation britannique et débuts de l'État d'Israël\nRamallah, comme toutes les localités palestiniennes, est sous l'autorité du mandat britannique à partir de novembre 1917 (le mandat est imposé en 1920, auparavant ce sont des forces d'occupation), jusqu'en 1948, date de la fondation de l'État d'Israël. L'électrification de la ville est totalement terminée en 1936. Des milliers de réfugiés, majoritairement musulmans, s'installent aux abords de la ville en 1948.\nRamallah fait partie des Territoires occupés après la Guerre des Six Jours de 1967.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nSous l'influence des migrations de réfugiés palestiniens, musulmans et chrétiens, de nouvelles mosquées et églises sont construites. La mosquée Jamal-Abdel-Nasser dans la ville adjacente de Al-Bireh est l'une des plus grandes de l'agglomération. Les coptes-orthodoxes ont construit une nouvelle église sur les hauteurs de la ville. Il existe aussi une église melkite catholique, une église luthérienne-évangélique, une église épiscopalienne, une église baptiste, etc. Les chrétiens représentent aujourd'hui 25 % de la population de l'agglomération totale et les réfugiés palestiniens 60 % (surtout aux abords de la ville).\n\nRamallah après 1972\nEn 1967, à la suite de la Guerre des Six Jours, tous les territoires palestiniens sont conquis par Israël. Les premières élections municipales depuis le début de l'occupation ont lieu en 1972. Dix ans plus tard, le maire Karim Khalaf est victime d'une tentative d'assassinat par des extrémistes israéliens, tout comme le maire de Naplouse et le maire d'Al-Bireh[réf. souhaitée]. Le conseil municipal suspend son administration.\n\nLa première intifada éclate en 1987. La même année, la première opération à cœur ouvert à l'hôpital est réalisée par le docteur Shawqi Harb.\nL'armée israélienne évacue Ramallah en 1996 et l'Autorité palestinienne installe son administration, un nouveau conseil municipal est réuni.\n\nLa seconde intifada commence en 2000 et se poursuit jusqu'en 2005. En 2002, le quartier commence à être bombardé. Bien que cette solution soit considérée à la base comme provisoire, Ramallah est devenue de facto la capitale de l'Autorité palestinienne. En décembre 2001, Arafat tient des réunions à la Mouqata'a, tout en vivant avec sa femme et sa fille à Gaza. Après des attentats suicides à Haïfa, Arafat est obligé de rester dans l'enceinte du gouvernement à Ramallah.\nLa région fait face à la pression continue de la colonisation israélienne. En 2023, les habitants de la plupart des communautés du territoire situé entre Ramallah et Jéricho, d'une superficie de 150 000 dounams [15 000 hectares], ont été contraints de fuir lorsque les colons, notamment les Jeunes des collines, ont commencé à construire rapidement des avant-postes pastoraux et à commettre des violences contre les résidents avec le soutien de Tsahal et des institutions de l'État israélien.\n\nÉconomie\nCette ancienne petite ville chrétienne est l'épicentre de l'activité économique palestinienne, laquelle doit beaucoup à l'aide internationale et aux capitaux de la diaspora. La ville doit aussi beaucoup au Premier ministre de l'Autorité palestinienne Salam Fayyad, artisan de son essor fulgurant.\nTrois cent cinquante salariés travaillent à l'usine Coca-Cola de Ramallah. La firme américaine est ainsi l'un des plus gros employeurs de la ville.\n\nDescription de la ville\nÀ Ramallah, fulgurant développement économique et fulgurant développement démographique vont de pair. La ville, qui attire les habitants d'autres cités de Cisjordanie (Naplouse, Jéricho, Hébron…) ne cesse de croître. Surtout en hauteur, car les restrictions imposées par Israël rendent presque impossible toute construction en périphérie.\nLa ville est un chantier à ciel ouvert. La frénésie immobilière ne connaît pas de répit et la spéculation fait flamber les prix : le montant du mètre carré a triplé entre 2005 et 2010. La croissance de la demande de logements est de nature exponentielle. Mais l'offre reste très limitée : les contraintes administratives imposées par Israël sont très lourdes, l'État hébreu ne délivre les permis de construire qu'au compte-gouttes, et dans des zones très restreintes.\nRamallah est devenue une capitale de facto, hébergeant les institutions politiques : résidence du président de l'Autorité palestinienne Mahmoud Abbas, QG de l'Autorité palestinienne, ministères…\nLa ville n'en reste pas moins une enclave dont on s'évade très difficilement. À chaque entrée de la ville, des barrages de Tsahal, l'armée israélienne, filtrent les allées et venues des Palestiniens. Du moins, ceux qui disposent d'un permis pour sortir. Au check point de Qalandia, principal passage vers Jérusalem, on reconnaît les véhicules autorisés à quitter la Cisjordanie à leur plaque jaune (israéliennes). Les plaques vertes (palestiniennes), elles, ne permettent aucune incursion en territoire israélien. À Qalandia, l'attente est souvent interminable, une heure trente en moyenne, pour parcourir les dix kilomètres qui séparent Ramallah de Jérusalem.\n\nCulture\nLe théâtre Al-Kasaba est un organisme culturel de cinéma, de théâtre, de musique et de danse créé en 1970.\nDepuis 2004, le centre culturel franco-allemand de Ramallah réunit deux structures en un seul lieu : l'Institut Goethe des Territoires palestiniens et une antenne de l'Institut français de Jérusalem. En plus de proposer aux Ramallawi l’apprentissage des langues de Molière et de Goethe, cet ICFA abrite un Makerspace, un studio d’enregistrement, un espace scénique et le Kultur Cafe.\n\nMusique\nDans les camps de réfugiés de Jénine, Deir Ghassaneh, Kalandia et Jalazone, en Cisjordanie mais aussi de Chatila et de Bourj el-Barajneh à Beyrouth, l'école de musique de l'association Al Kamandjâti, fondée à Angers en 2002 et installée à Ramallah en 2008 par Ramzi Aburedwan, forme des apprentis interprètes. Plus de 150 élèves s'inscrivent chaque année aux cours de théorie de la musique et d’apprentissage d'un ou plusieurs instruments. L'association fournit instruments, pupitres et partitions. Les cours sont assurés par des musiciens étrangers comme ceux de l'Orchestre arabo-andalou d'Anjou, de l'Orchestre de chambre de Paris ou comme le chef Diego Masson qui encadrent les jeunes bénévolement. Des concerts sont organisés en Cisjordanie mais parfois aussi en Israël, souvent annulés en raison des conflits.\nUn concert hautement symbolique a eu lieu en août 2005, à Ramallah : celui de l'Orchestre Divan occidental-oriental, dirigé par Daniel Barenboïm et cofondé par Edward Saïd (décédé en 2003), qui rassemble de jeunes musiciens Israéliens, Arabes et Espagnols[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGouvernement\nAujourd'hui Ramallah est la ville où se trouve le plus de sièges des missions diplomatiques auprès de l'Autorité palestinienne. C'est le cas de l'Afrique du Sud, l'Allemagne, l'Argentine, l'Australie, l'Autriche, le Brésil, le Canada, la Chine, la Corée du Sud, le Danemark, la Finlande, l'Inde, l'Irlande, le Japon, la Jordanie, le Mexique, la Norvège, les Pays-Bas, la Pologne, le Portugal, la Russie, le Sri Lanka, la Suisse et la République tchèque.\n\nPersonnalités\nYasser Arafat (1929-2004), activiste et homme d'État palestinien.

          "content": "## Overview\nRamallah or Ram Allah (Arabic رام الله Rāmallāh) is a small city in the West Bank region of the Palestinian Territories, located 15 km (10 miles) north of Jerusalem. Since the inception of the Palestinian National Authority, Ramallah has acted as the de facto capital city of the Palestinian administration. The neighboring town of Al-Bireh has over the years fused together with Ramallah and is covered in this article too.\n\n## Understand\nModern Ramallah was founded in the mid-16th century by the Haddadins, a Jordanian tribe of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christian Arabs. The Haddadins, led by Rashid Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River near the Jordanian town of Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is blamed for fighting and unrest among clans in that area. According to living descendants of the original Haddadin family members, Rahid's brother Sabra Haddadin was hosting Emir Ibn Kaysoom, head of a powerful Muslim clan in the region, when Sabra's wife gave birth to a baby girl. According to custom, the Emir proposed a betrothal to his own young son when they came of age. Sabra believed the proposal was in jest, as Muslim-Christian marriages were not customary, and gave his word. When the Emir later came to the Haddadins and demanded that they fulfill their promise, they refused. This set off bloody conflict between the two families. The Haddadins fled west and settled on the hilltops of Ramallah, where only a few Muslim families lived at the time. Today the town has a Muslim majority, but Ramallah retains its title as a historically Christian Palestinian town.\nIn 2017, the city had a population of 39,000, and the metro area 153,000.\nRamallah is known for its religiously relaxed atmosphere; alcohol flows freely and movie theaters and the cafes along its main streets are well attended. Ramallah is, without question, the cultural capital of the West Bank, with a highly educated and fashionable population. It is also the hub of Palestinian feminist activity; the city's women frequently attend university rather than marrying early, and several cafes run exclusively by women are used to fund local feminist organizations.\nWhile there, it is easy to make small talk with the locals. Unless you are firmly anti-Israeli occupation, it is advisable that you do more listening than actual talking yourself, however. For the most part, Palestinians are glad to share their problems and plight with any western visitors.\n\n## Get in\nTourists with passports outside the Middle East have no problem entering or exiting Ramallah. Make sure to have your passport and visa stamp with you. Even though you will probably not need your passport to enter, you will be required to show your passport and stamp in order to re-enter Israel. Once through the checkpoint, it is a short drive to downtown Ramallah. Bear in mind that it is illegal for Israelis to enter Ramallah, under Israeli law.\nOn the way back, if you have an Israeli visa stamp or visa paper with your passport from when you arrived in Israel, then just stay on the bus as it arrives at Kalandia. (Many passengers will get off here to go through a different security check.) A couple of border guards will come on to the bus to check passenger ID documents. They will probably speak English well and may ask some questions about where you are from.\n\n## By bus\nThere is 31.9054935.20711 one bus station on Al-Nahder St. that serves buses from Nablus, and probably other destinations north. There are at least three other bus stations in the city which also serve various destinations. Nevertheless, they are all pretty close to each other.\nFrom Jerusalem the best connection to Ramallah is bus/sherut/serves 218 (and sometimes 219). It departs from the Nablus Road station close to Damascus Gate on Nablus Rd (aka Derech Shchem) and will take you all the way to before mentioned bus station near the central square of al-Manara. The price is ₪10-20, and it takes around 45 minutes.\nFrom Bethlehem take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the Bethlehem bus station at Manger St. in the center. The trip takes 45 min all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxi (Sherut/serviis) from the central roundabout with the garden in the middle. The taxis are waiting on the western side of the roundabout. To increase your \"luck\", you can also wait at the roundabout out of the city with the mosque. Even hitchhiking from there makes sense. The trip to Ramallah takes less than an hour for less than ₪15. The exact price is listed in the tourist information on the central roundabout in Jericho centre.\nFrom Nablus the trip is ₪10.5 and it takes about an hour. Ask around from which bus station in Nablus the correct (big) bus starts.\nIt is worth asking the drivers before you get on to double-check the bus is going to the right destination. You might be surprised how many of them can speak basic English. There are two main types of buses. There are small ones with about 20 seats, and biggers ones that look more like coaches and are much more comfortable. They all cost the same, and there is usually a rush of passengers pushing their way onto the buses.\n\n## By taxi\nFrom Jerusalem's Damascus Gate you can find taxis to Ramallah for approximately ₪80-100 depending on your bargaining skills. You can also take a taxi to Kalandia checkpoint and walk through, picking up another taxi on the other side. It costs about ₪30 from Kalandia to Ramallah centre.\n\n## By car\nHeading north from Jerusalem on road #60, you will arrive to Ramallah very quickly. You will have to pass one Israeli checkpoint on the way: Kalandia.\n\n## By plane\nThere is no airport with scheduled passenger flights in the West Bank, so the only nearby passenger airports are Ben Gurion Airport in Lod, then heading towards Jerusalem  or Queen Alia in Amman then heading towards Allenby Bridge aka King Hussein Bridge and passing through it - Visa on arrival for Israel is available for most common nationalities. Ovda Airport near Eilat also sees international flights, but the connection from there to Ramallah is not all that straightforward and more time-consuming.\n\n## Get around\nIt is easy to find a taxi to get around Ramallah (for ₪10 fixed charge, or the amount specified by the fare-meter). Car rentals are also available, but seldom needed. As the city center is relatively small, it is not hard to walk to most destinations downtown (including the old city.) Service shuttles (shared taxis) are also available from downtown to most suburbs and to the outskirts of the city at relatively low prices (₪2.5 inside the city and up to ₪6 to nearby towns and villages). Make sure to confirm a price before getting into a taxi.\n\n## See\nThe city is one of the most vibrant ones in the West Bank. In Ramallah, a few historic and religious sites are present. However, the downtown streets are a must see during the day, as the city is often really congested.\nHisbeh produce market, see below.\n31.9045635.197271 Old City.

If you are visiting Ramallah, it is probable that you are doing so for political, business, and/or humanitarian reasons - expect to have lots of staring, curious (but always friendly) eyes looking at you as you walk through town.\n31.891735.19091 Ramallah Cultural Palace. The main venue for performances and concerts within the city.    (updated Aug 2023)\nJoin a protest, info@hostelinramallah.com.

Hostel in Ramallah has different tours, twice per week they organize trip to one of the protests and Hebron city. Keep in mind that you would protest at your own risk.\nTurkish bath (in the twin-city of El-Bireh). A good destination for foreigners wanting to relax for the day. .\n\n## Learn\nRamallah is the home of the Friends School in the Palestinian Territories. The school has two campuses, one for grades 1-6 and is located near the old city. The other is for grades 7-12 and is located near the old police station destroyed by an Israeli air strike. The schools are famous for their international learning environment, intensive English language focus, and liberal learning atmosphere. The schools are private and have a number of notable Palestinian alumni.\nThe city also has a number of public and private schools that serve a good number of the West Bank youth population. Private schools with specific religious affiliations can also be found.\nIn the twin city of El-Bireh, there is also a school for the blind that also serves as a vocational center.\nBirzeit University, which is in the neighboring town of Birzeit, is one of the Palestinian Authority's leading educational institutions. The University offers a large number of study options and at different levels for students.

The PAS (Palestinian and Arab Studies) program is popular with internationals visiting or working in the West Bank who want to learn Arabic and take classes on the history and politics of the Palestinian Authority.\nThe city also has branches for Al-Quds Open University, which offers continuing education opportunities to many Palestinians.\nThere are a number of vocational training centers in the city, neighboring towns, and refugee camps.\n\n## Work\nRamallah is a vibrant Palestinian business hub, especially as most international agencies and governmental offices are located in the city. However, with the immigration of Palestinians from other cities in the West Bank to Ramallah, there is a highly competitive job market and many Palestinians, especially young men come to the city seeking work.\nThe most popular career portal In Ramallah and Palestine is Jobs in Palestine[dead link]. Here you can find most jobs advertised by INGOs, NGOs, and local companies.\nMajor working opportunities in Ramallah include information technology, pharmaceuticals, development cooperation, and the public sector. Restaurant and coffee shop jobs are also available, mainly during the summer. Agricultural jobs are minimal in the city, but a few can be sought in neighboring villages.\nFor foreigners, work opportunities tend to include consultancies in certain private sector markets - IT is most common. The vast majority of foreigners working in Ramallah are doing development or humanitarian work. A significant number are focused on human rights and advocacy. A number of UN agencies work directly in the West Bank and many, such as the UNDP, maintain office in Ramallah.\nVolunteering opportunities are common in small and medium-sized Palestinian NGOs as well as some international NGOs. Volunteering is an excellent way to get to understand an organisation and the field they operate in. Most local NGOs will appreciate foreign volunteers, particularly if they have good written English skills, enabling them to support fundraising work. Volunteers are often paid small sums to cover basic travel costs but this varies. If you are planning to volunteer, have enough money to support yourself as Ramallah is not a cheap place to live. you could also volunteer in some new small projects as the first youth hostel in the city (Hostel in Ramallah) and through the hostel there are some other projects as an organic farm or refuge camps http://hostelinramallah.com\n\n## Buy\nThere's not a huge amount to do in Ramallah if you are just visiting. A great way to spend your time could be to dip in and out of shops. Shop-keepers are among the most ready-to-talk and many have colourful lives. It gives you a good reason to walk around and take your time.\nYou will never find everything under one roof, but for a basket of common necessities, you will need to visit a baker, grocer, butcher, pharmacy and mini-market. Ramallah city centre, despite the development and growth of some new stores retains a small-town feel due to the protections for tenants that mean many shops have been in the same location for decades (rent agreed at the outset cannot be increased, so in many cases is only a few USD per year).\n31.9045935.206031 Hisbeh produce market (Souq) (near the main bus station and the central mosque, about 150 m away from al-Manara Square (the centre of Ramallah)).

The staple is 'kmaaj' or pitta bread. A bakery in the Old City (Ramallah Tahta) produces brown kmaaj and sliced bread.\nAlso the Arabic variety of ice cream in many places in Ramallah is worth trying - a very different and more gooey and sticky version of what is available in the west. Regular ice cream can be found everywhere also. Try Rukab's and Baladna ice cream shops on the main street.\nThere are a huge number of falafel and shawarma places on all of the main streets.

Homemade pastries, manakeesh, salads, sandwiches, desserts, cakes, fresh juices, hot and soft drinks, and shisha. (updated May 2018)\n\n## Drink\nAlthough predominately Muslim, Ramallah is still a Christian town, hence Ramallah's large restaurants usually serve alcohol. Expect a selection of imported beers (Heineken, Corona, etc.), spirits, and perhaps red or white wine. Do not display public intoxication, as at best, it is rude and inconsiderate to your Muslim hosts. At worst, it could be dangerous.\nThe city's active nightlife and its relatively liberal culture makes it a hot destination for visitors from other cities including Jerusalem during the weeknights and weekends.\nDuring the night, a good number of shops are still open, especially during the summer. A common habit of the citizens of the city is going out for a drink, dinner, or an argila (flavoured tobacco waterpipe). The city's various coffee shops, bars, and restaurants are a must see/visit.

The term Argila is often used in Ramallah to describe the waterpipes, while shishah is also used at some places. You might even see a 'hookah' or 'Hubbly Bubbly'. You can also smoke arghila in almost any restaurant, although some have special areas for them.\nYou can order normal ('aadi') or fresh ('fresh'). Fresh means the tobacco is placed in a piece of fruit like an orange (or even a watermelon). It has a smoother flavour but is more expensive. You should also choose your flavour. Common flavours are double-apple ('tufateen') and lemon and mint ('limun-w-nana').\nDepending on the location and type of restaurant of cafe, the price of smoking a nice and soothing tobacco waterpipe costs anywhere between ₪8-30.

(updated Nov 2017)\n\n## Stay safe\nGenerally speaking, Ramallah is safe for non-Israeli foreigners. The Palestinian residents are usually quite happy to have foreign nationals visit them. Theft is relatively rare, although do not interpret that statement as an OK to let your guard down.\nBear in mind that although Ramallah has been under military occupation for a long time, the city is relatively stable. However, very rarely the Israeli military enters the city to arrest wanted Palestinians. This usually only happens in the dead of night, and they disappear before anyone realizes that they were there. However, the Israeli military can enter Ramallah bluntly, and in large numbers. If this should happen while you are staying in Ramallah, do what the majority of Palestinians do, and stay inside until they leave and away from any soldiers or military vehicles. Do not assume that just because you are a foreign national that you will be safe.\nThat said, Ramallah hasn't seen any widespread violence since 2006 and it is highly unlikely to happen (unless there are escalations with Israel, which will be very apparent via international media). In the cases where the Israelis enter, it is usually to arrest a wanted Palestinian in an outskirts refugee camp in the middle of the night. They will rarely enter the city centre, so as to avoid an unnecessary confrontation with large crowds of civilians.\n\n## Diplomatic liaisons\nOffice of China, No.52 Al-Tira Street, ☏ +970 2 295 1222, fax: +970 2 295 1221, chinaemb_ps@mfa.gov.cn.

          "content": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEtymology\nJenin has been identified as the place \"Gina\" or \"Ginah\" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning \"the spring of gardens\" or \"the spring of Ganim\", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city's ancient name.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nJenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as \"Ein Ganim\", \"Beth Hagan\", \"Ginah\", and \"Ginae\", along other names.\nTell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district. The tell is also known as Tell el-Nawar, a term derived from the Arabic word for \"gypsies,\" due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.\n\nBronze Age\nJenin has been identified as the place Gina or Ginah mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\n\nIron Age\nJenin is identical to Ein-Ganim, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with Beth-Haggan, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah's flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as Gini.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nJosephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions Ginae as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, Ginae was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.\nBiblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, \"the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive\", was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke's Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.\nCeramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, \"is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance\".\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major), to distinguish it from the town of Zir'in, which they called Petit Grin. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nShortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as \"a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.\" In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.\nIn 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) \"to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of 'Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.\" As one of the stations of the Mamluk barid (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun's son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1299–1309, 1310–1341), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans' drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as \"an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water\" north of Qaqun \"on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]\". He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a nahiya (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.\nThe tax registers from 1548 to 1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed sanjak-bey (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun sanjak-bey in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.\nThe Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town's Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and sanjak-beys of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it \"does not exist anymore\". No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.\nIn the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the mallakin (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Jenin as \"The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.\"\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on \"an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage\" that caused the British administration \"grave concern\", according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya'bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\nThe village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.\n\nIsraeli occupation 1967 to 2020\nJenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.\nOn 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.\nAccording to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.\nAccording to the BBC, the city is \"Known among Palestinians\" as \"the Martyrs' capital\", but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.\nDuring the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians,  were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.\nDuring a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.\n\nIn the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.\n\nIsraeli occupation in the 2020s\nOn 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.\nOn 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.\nOn 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city's refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled \"militants\", were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said \"The operation is progressing as planned,\" and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a \"center for terrorist activity\" thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.\nOn 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nGaza war\nDuring the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.\nJenin was severely damaged during the Gaza war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.\n\nIn late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that \"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.\" The governor of Jenin said that \"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.\" The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is \"not extremely different from regular activity\". At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying \"a dead and a wounded person\", leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.\nAlso in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures\".\nIn December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called \"Protect the Homeland\". The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.\nOn January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin were ongoing as of late February 2025. Around 100 homes had been demolished, residents were being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks had been deployed.\n\nGeography\nJenin is situated at the foot of the rugged northernmost hills (Jabal Nablus) of the West Bank, and along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amer), which the city overlooks. Its highest elevation is about 250 meters above sea level and its lowest areas are 90 meters above sea level. Immediately southwest of Jenin is the Sahl Arraba plain (Dothan Valley), while further south is the Marj Sanur valley.

Six seats each were won by Hamas and the local coalition of Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Jenin was one of several Palestinian cities where Hamas showed a dramatic growth in electoral support.\n Hadem Rida was then elected as Mayor of the city, until he was arrested by the Israel Forces and spent 3 years in jail. After his release, he resigned from the position and went back to practice in his clinic in Jenin city.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jenin had a population of 49,908, the Jenin Refugee Camp of 10,417 on 373 dunams (92 acres).

According to local traditions, he was a descendant of Ali Zayn al-Abidin, the grandson of Muhammad and the sixth Sh'ia Imam. According to a local tradition, Sheikh Izz al-Din fought alongside Saladin against the Crusaders. The tomb possibly predates the cemetery, which served as a burial site for the people of Jenin and the Turabay dynasty.

          "summary": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.",

          "content": "جِنِين مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة جنين وأكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفة الغربية المحتلة التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية. تعتبر تاريخيًا، إحدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافة 75 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الأردن من ناحية الشرق، ومرج بن عامر إلى جهة الشمال.\nبالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبة مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلا اقتصاديا أكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 48,479 نسمة بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 آلاف نسمة، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا أو طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، أما المحافظة فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمة.\nتصل مساحة مدينة جنين وحدها إلى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس أكبر مدينة فلسطينية في الضفة الغربية بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحة محافظة جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا أي 9,7% من مساحة الضفة الغربية الإجمالية. يتبع المدينة مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينة عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والآشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن الكنعانيين هم من أسسها في حدود سنة 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من أقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال مأهولة بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينة بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر أخصب أراضي فلسطين التاريخية، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطية.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تارة تنهض وتارة أخرى تنتكس، إلا أن المدينة ازدهرت في أواخر الحكم العثماني وتأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياة في جنين بصورة متسارعة عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين إليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمة بين المدن الكبرى بالضفة الغربية في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينة جنين شأن عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بداية الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبة لإسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركة عدد كبير من أبناءها في العمل المسلح ضد إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضة الثانية.\n\nتسمية\nتقوم مدينة جنين على الأرض التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جنيم» وتعني بالكنعانية عين الجنائن. لذلك سُميت بهذا الاسم بسبب الجنائن التي تحيط بها.\nذًُكرت مدينة «عين جنيم» في التوراة على أنها إحدى المدن التي سكنها اللاويون المنتمين لقبيلة «إسحقكر»، والذين غيروا اسمها إلى «جنّت» بعد بضع سنوات من استقرارهم بها. وفي كتابات أخرى يُرمز إلى المدينة باسم «جيني»، ويذكر المؤرخ اليهودي «يوسيفوس فلافيوس» أن مدينة جنين كانت إحدى مدن شمال السامرة.\n\nتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nتوفرت في موقع جنين المظاهر الطبيعية اللازمة لأي استقرار بشري، ففيه توفر الماء والسهل والجبل والأودية والكهوف، وبالتالي وفر هذا الموقع الماء والغذاء والمأوى والطريق. وعليه فليس من المستغرب أن يكون الإنسان الأول قد أقام في هذا الموقع ولا سيما أنه اكتشفت بقايا الإنسان الأول في جبل الكرمل القريب من موقع جنين، وفي نفس الوقت ليس هناك ما يحول دون انتقال ذلك الإنسان من جبل الكرمل إلى جنين. وقبل الميلاد بقرون عديدة كانت مدن بيت شان (بيسان) ومجدو ودوثان، وحتى تقوم بين هذه المدن علاقات تجارية فلا بد من موقع وسطي يقوم بتقديم الخدمات للقوافل التجارية، وأنسب موقع في هذا المجال هو موقع مدينة جنين الذي بقع في وسط المثلث الذي شكله مواقع تلك المدن. ويعزز هذا الرأي ورود اسم المدينة في النصوص المصرية القديمة وفي الوثائق البابلية والآشورية. وقد ورد اسم المدينة في التوراة باسم «عين جنيم» أو \"Eun Gannim\" (بالعبرية: ג'נין) أي عين الجنات لكثرة مياهها وبساتينها، وكانت تعرف باسم «باب السامرة» (سبسطية الحالية) لأنها تقع عند بداية الوادي الذي يصل بين مرج ابن عامر وجبال السامرة. ونظراً لعدم حصانة موقع عين جانيم أنشأت في ذلك الوقت «مدينة بلعام» (بلعمة حالياً) التي تقع جنوب جنين ومشرفة على طريق السامرة. والمعروف أن جنين الحالية تقوم على المنطقة التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينة «عين جانيم» العربية الكنعانية.\n\nالعهد الفينيقي والإغريقي\nعُثر على 4 مشاعل مصنوعة من الطين النضيج في جنين، وهي ذات أصل فينيقي وتعود للقرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وكان صاحب هذا الاكتشاف هو عالم الآثار «ج.أ. هاردينغ»، الذي قال بأن هذا دليل على وجود نوع من التفاعل والعلاقات التجارية بين سكان جنين وفينيقيا في ذلك الزمن.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nفي العهد الروماني كانت في مكانها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي»، وقد مر بالقرب منها المسيح أكثر من مرة وهو في طريقه من الناصرة إلى القدس. وقد اعتنق سكانها المسيحية، حيث عثر على بقايا كنيسة بالقرب من مركز جنين، في قرية برقين تحديداً، ويعود تاريخ هذه الكنيسة إلى القرن السادس الميلادي. وقد غير الرومان اسمها من «عين جنيم» إلى «جنين».\n\nالفتح الإسلامي والصليبيون\nولما جاء الفتح الإسلامي حُرّف اسمها إلى «جينين»، وقد قال عنها ياقوت الحموي في معجم البلدان بأنها «بليدة حسنة بين نابلس وبيسان من أرض الأردن، بها عيون ومياه.» وتعاقبت على حكم المنطقة الدولة الأموية ثم العباسية. وعندما انحطت هذه الأخيرة أخذ يسيطر على فلسطين فئة خارجة عن القانون، مما سهّل على الصليبيين غزوها.\nسقطت مدينة جنين تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1103م، وقد احتلها دوق أدنبرة، ودخلت ضمن إمارة بلدوين ومملكة بيت المقدس. وقد غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى «غرين الكبرى» (بالفرنسية: Grand Grin)، تمييزاً لها عن بلدة زرعين التي دعوها باسم «غرين الصغرى» (بالفرنسية: Petit Grin)، وقد أحاطها الصليبيون بقلاع وحصون منيعة.\nبقيت جنين بيد الصليبيين حتى عام 1187م، حيث هاجمها صلاح الدين الأيوبي إذ استطاع جنده ثقب قلعتها ولكن القلعة سقطت عليهم، وبالتالي غادرها صلاح الدين إلى زرعين ومن ثم إلى عين جالوت. وبعد معركة حطين سقطت جنين بيد المسلمين، وقد عقد صلاح الدين صلحاً مع أعدائه عام 588 هـ، وبالتالي تركها وغادر بعد ذلك إلى بيسان.\nفي عام 1229 عُقد صلح بين فردريك الثاني - إمبراطور الإمبراطورية الرومانية المقدسة والكامل الأيوبي خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة، أعطيت المدينة بموجبه إلى الصليبيين ولكن الملك الصالح أيوب استطاع تحريرها نهائياً عام 1244م في معركة هربيا بمساعدة الخوارزمية. وفي عام 1255م تم الاتفاق بين الناصر الأيوبي وبين عز الدين أيبك، أول سلاطين المماليك، على إعطائه كل الأراضي التي تقع غرب نهر الأردن (فلسطين حالياً)، وبالتالي دخلت جنين في حوزة المماليك.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nلقد كانت جنين وزرعين إحدى إقطاعيات الظاهر بيبرس، في عام 1260 شهدت منطقة عين جالوت الواقعة بالقرب من زرعين، شمال جنين واحدة من المعارك الفاصلة في التاريخ، حيث تعد معركة عين جالوت من أهم المعارك في تاريخ العالم الإسلامي، انتصر فيها المسلمون المماليك انتصارا ساحقا على المغول وكانت هذه هي المرة الأولى التي يهزم فيها المغول في معركة حاسمة منذ عهد جنكيز خان. أدت المعركة لانحسار نفوذ المغول في بلاد الشام وخروجهم منها نهائيا وإيقاف المد المغولي المكتسح الذي أسقط الخلافة العباسية سنة 1258م. وفي عام 1280م ولّى السلطان قلاوون الأمير بدر الدين درباس ولاية جنين ومرج ابن عامر. ومن أبرز حوادث جنين في العهد المملوكي، انتشار الوباء في مصر والشام عام 748هـ، ويعود تمكن الوباء من هذه المدينة لانفتاحها على البلدان الأخرى ولكثرة الوافدين إليها حيث كانت جنين مركزاً من مراكز البريد بين غزة ودمشق. وقد حكم الأمراء الحارثيون - الذين أعلنوا الولاء للعثمانيين - هذه البلاد. وكانت مدينة جنين مركزاً لزعامتهم (من 1601م إلى 1671م) حيث خرجت الإمارة منهم بعد هذا التاريخ وتولى الإمارة أحمد باشا الترزي ثم جاء بعده شيوخ المهاميط وأشهرهم الشيخ علي من أواخر القرن السابع عشر حتى أوائل القرن الثامن عشر. وفي عام 1566م قامت فاطمة خاتون زوجة والي دمشق ببناء جامع اشتمل على حمام وتكية وسوق (وهو جامع جنين الكبير حالياً) وقد بقي آل طرباي مسيطرين على المنطقة وموالين للعثمانيين الذين ساعدوهم ضد الأمير فخر الدين المعني الثاني - حاكم لبنان - الذي فر إلى أوروبا عام 1613م، ولكنه ما لبث أن عاد ثانية إلى المنطقة، وتمكن من هزيمة الطرباي الذين حكموا المنطقة عام 1624م. وفي عام 1660م ألحقت جنين مع سنجق اللجون بولاية صيدا.\nفي عام 1799 هاجم الفرنسيون بقيادة نابليون فلسطين وعسكر قائده كليبر في مرج ابن عامر، هنا هاجمه جنود الدولة العثمانية بمساعدة أهالي جنين ونابلس، الذين كادوا يقضون على الفرنسيين في تلك المنطقة، لولا أن هبّ نابليون لنجدة كليبر، حيث قطع نابليون خط إمدادات العثمانيين. ولما انتصر الفرنسيون أمر نابليون جنده بحرق جنين ونهبها انتقاماً منهم لمساعدتهم للعثمانيين. وبعد اندحار الفرنسيين ورجوعهم إلى مصر نمت مدينة جنين ثانية وأصبحت مركزاً لمتسلمية جنين، يحكمها متسلم ينوب عن والي صيدا وكانت في الغالب لعائلتي آل جرار وآل عبد الهادي.\nوكان جبل نابلس في هذه الفترة ينقسم إلى متسلميتين: الأولى «متسلمية اللجون» والتي انتقلت فيما بعد إلى جنين والثانية «متسلمية نابلس» واللتان تقعان ضمن سنجق البلقاء (نابلس) التابع لولاية بيروت العثمانية. وكان آل جرار أمراء متسلمية اللجون منذ أوائل القرن الثامن عشر، ففي نهاية هذا القرن قامت الدولة العثمانية بتعيين الشيخ يوسف الجرار أميراً على اللجون في بلاد حارثة، والذي قام وبمساعدة سكان المنطقة والعثمانيين بنجدة أحمد باشا الجزار حاكم عكا في التصدي للغزو الفرنسي على المدينة.\nثم دخلت جنين كباقي مدن الشام تحت الحكم المصري بعد أن نجح إبراهيم باشا في طرد العثمانيين، وعين حسين عبد الهادي حاكماً لها، كما جعلها مركز لواء خاصاً به، إلا أن حكم المصريين لم يدم طويلاً حيث اضطر المصريون للخروج من بلاد الشام عام 1840م. فعادت جنين قائمقامية في متصرفية نابلس التابعة لولاية بيروت التي أنشئت بدلاً من ولاية صيدا. وفي القرن العشرين ربطت جنين بسكة حديد الحجاز التي وصلتها بالعفولة وبيسان ونابلس، وفي الحرب العالمية الأولى أقام الجيش الألماني مطاراً عسكرياً غرب جنين.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عهد الانتداب البريطاني أصبحت المدينة مركزاً لقضاء جنين، ولها سجل حافل بالنضال ضد الاستعمار البريطاني والصهيوني، حيث أعلنت أول قوة مسلحة ضد الاستعمار البريطاني عام 1935م بقيادة عز الدين القسام، والذي استشهد لاحقاً في أحراش بلدة يعبد وهي أحد البلدات التي تقع غرب مدينة جنين. وقد اشترك سكان المدينة في إضراب عام 1936، وقد تعرضت جنين إبان فترة الانتداب البريطاني إلى الكثير من أعمال العنف والتنكيل والتخريب وهدم البيوت على أيدي القوات البريطانية نتيجة لبعض الحوادث مثل قتل حاكم جنين «موفيت» في عام 1938.\n\nقيام دولة إسرائيل\nأما بعد انسحاب البريطانيين من فلسطين منتصف 1948، وفي خضم [[حرب فلسطين\n1948|الحرب العربية-الإسرائيلية الأولى]] أو النكبة، اختير القائد عبد القادر الحسيني لتولي القيادة العسكرية في جبل القدس. ولما تأخر وصول كتاب جيش الإنقاذ من الدول العربية المجاورة حتى أواخر شهر كانون الثاني سنة 1948، قرر الحسيني تعبئة القوى الشعبية في القسم العربي من التقسيم وقد كان يعتمد على متطوعي جبل نابلس لتاريخ هذا الجبل البطولي والعسكري، ولذا فقد وفد إلى مدينة جنين مطلع شهر كانون الثاني وبعد مناقشات ومحادثات مع وجهاء المنطقة، عقدت عدة اجتماعات في قرى القضاء وتطوع عدد كبير من المقاتلين واختار الجمع الشيخ فوزي الجرار قائداً لجميع فرق مقاتلي جبل نابلس. وقد أقرت الهيئة العربية العليا والقيادة العسكرية العليا لجامعة الدول العربية هذا التعيين واعتمدته وأوصت أن يتخذ جرار مراكزه في قرى صانور، صير وجبع.\nولقد خاضت جنين بمدنها وقراها معركة الدفاع عن الوجود ضد المنظمات الصهيونية المسلحة، التي استولت في أواخر مايو سنة 1948 على قرى زرعين، والمزار، ونورس، وصندلة، والجلمة، والمقيبلة، وفقوعة، وعرانة، وحاولت الاستيلاء على مدينة جنين حيث تم تطويقها في 3 يونيو 1948 وكان عدد الصهاينة 4000 مقاتل؛ فاستولوا على معظم أحياء المدينة وتحصن المجاهدون في عمارة الشرطة في المدخل الغربي لجنين. حتى وصلت نجدة للمحاصرين قوامها 500 جندي عراقي بقيادة عمر علي وحوالي 800 من المجاهدين الفلسطينيين من المدينة. وبعد معارك دامية خارج البلدة وفي شوارعها وأزقتها شارك فيها العديد من سكان المنطقة وقراها المجاورة تقدم العرب لاسترداد قراهم المحيطة بالمدينة. وقد كانت معركة جنين التي وقعت في 3 حزيران سنة 1948 مفخرة للمقاتلين من أهل البلاد الذين استشهد منهم العشرات بالإضافة للعدد الكبير من الجرحى، والتي أدت في آخر المطاف إلى انسحاب القوات الإسرائيلية من جنين في 4 حزيران سنة 1948 وتكبيدها خسائر جسيمة بلغت 1241 قتيل ومفقود من أصل 4000 جندي إسرائيلي كانوا يحاصرون المدينة. يستذكر الفلسطينيون شهداء الجيش العراقي الذين سقطوا دفاعاً عن جنين، حيث توجد مقبرة للعشرات منهم بالقرب من مثلث الشهداء جنوب المدينة.\n\nقيام السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً للواء جنين التابع لمحافظة نابلس. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة. رزحت جنين تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة جنين التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة. استمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة جنين، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nفي 3 نيسان من سنة 2002 قامت القوات الإسرائيلية باقتحام جنين ومخيمها في عملية استمرت 10 أيام متواصلة، ارتكبت فيها إسرائيل مجزرة راح ضحيتها 58 فلسطيني، فيما تكبدت هي خسائر جسيمة بأعداد القتلى حيث ناهزت العشرين قتيل من الجنود الإسرائيليين الذي اشتبكوا في حرب شوارع مع فصائل المقاومة داخل مخيم المدينة في ما أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nحرب غزة (2023)\nخلال حرب غزة، نفذت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلية عمليات متعددة في جنين. وفي 22 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، نفذت القوات الإسرائيلية غارة جوية استهدفت مجمعًا تحت الأرض أسفل مسجد الأنصار في مخيم جنين للاجئين\nبالمدينة +، ما أدى لاستشهاد اثنين وأصيب آخرين بجروح متفاوتة، وقيل إنها كانت أول غارة جوية في الضفة الغربية منذ الانتفاضة الثانية. وإدعى الجيش الإسرائيلي أن الضربة استهدفت نشطاء من حماس والجهاد الإسلامي في فلسطين كانوا يخططون ل\"هجوم إرهابي\".\nوتعرضت جنين لأضرار بالغة خلال الحرب على غزة، وبحلول يونيو 2024، أدت الهجمات المتكررة بالقنابل والتوغلات بالجرافات من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية إلى تدمير كل شارع وتحويل كل ساحة عامة إلى أنقاض. وفي حادثة واحدة في 21 مايو، وفقًا للصحفي الإسرائيلي جدعون ليفي، أطلق قناص إسرائيلي النار على المارة ما أدى لاستشهادهم، بما في ذلك جراح الدكتور أسيد جبارين (50 عامًا) أثناء توجهه إلى العمل في مستشفى جنين الحكومي.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nورد اسم جنين بالمخطوطات المصرية القديمة، وكذلك البابلية والآشورية وفي التوراة والإنجيل، وهي مشتقة من الاسم القديم «عين جهانيم» أو «جنيم» وهي قريبة من الجنائن والبساتين. وتعتبر جنين خامس الأماكن المقدسة عند المسيحيين، لمرور يسوع المسيح من قرية برقين، حيث أشفى العشرة البرص المنعزلين في مغارة بطرف القرية.\nوفي المكان نفسه وفي أوائل القرن الرابع الميلادي أقام قسطنطين الكبير كنيسة برقين المعروفة بكنيسة جرجس وقد قامت الحكومة الهولندية بإجراء الإصلاحات اللازمة لها بالتنسيق مع دائرة الآثار في السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية باعتبارها من الأماكن المقدسة لدى النصارى، وأصبحت هذه الكنيسة تعتبر طريق الوصل للحجاج المسيحيين من الناصرة إلى بيت لحم. وفي الفترة المشار إليها أقيمت في جنين كنيسة من ضمن 31 مدينة و442 قرية في عموم أراضي فلسطين، وظلت الكنيسة قائمة إلى أن دمرها زلزال عام 560م. كما تضم المحافظة ديراً للاتين يقع في قرية الزبابدة ذات الأغلبية المسيحية، الواقعة جنوب شرق جنين.\nأما إسلامياً، فيقع في المدينة واحد من أقدم وأكبر المعالم الإسلامية العثمانية في فلسطين وهو جامع جنين الكبير الذي أنشأته فاطمة خاتون ابنة محمد بك بن السلطان الملك الأشرف قانصوة الغوري في القرن السادس عشر. ويُعتبر هذا المسجد من أبرز المعالم التاريخية في الحضارة الإسلامية في فلسطين، ومن أقدم التحف المعمارية العثمانية في البلاد.\n\nالجغرافية\nالموقع\nتقع مدينة جنين على دائرة عرض 32,28 شمالاً وعلى خط طول 35,18 شرق غرينتش، كما تقع على الإحداثيات 208 عرض و178 طول حسب شبكة الإحداثيات الفلسطينية.\nينقطع في الأجزاء الشمالية من فلسطين استمرار الإقليم الجبلي المحاذي للسهول الساحلية مكوناً سهلاً يشبه مثلثاً متساوي الأضلاع، تمتد قاعدته من سفوح جبل الكرمل في حيفا حتى شرق جنين، ويمتد الضلع الأول من جنوب شرق الناصرة وينتهي في جوار مدينة جنين، ويمتد الضلع الثاني بمحاذاة جبال الجليل. ويطلق على السهل اسم مرج ابن عامر. وبالتالي، يمثل موقع مدينة جنين رأس مثلث سهل مرج ابن عامر، عند التقاء المرتفعات الممتدة من جبل الكرمل ومن جنوب شرق الناصرة.\nومما يعطي موقع مدينة جنين أهمية أنها تقع في موقع وسطي بالنسبة للمدن الفلسطينية، حيث تقع جنوب مدينة الناصرة على بعد 25 كم، وإلى الجنوب الشرقي من مدينة حيفا على بعد 50 كم، وإلى الشمال من مدينة نابلس على بعد 43 كم.\nتقع المدينة على السفح الشمالي لجبال نابلس على الجانب المطل على مرج بن عامر، وتنتشر مساكن المدينة على هذا السفح من ارتفاع يناهز 125م إلى ارتفاع يقارب 225م. ويتراوح انحدار هذا السفح بين 10-15 %، مما يشير إلى تدرج السفح بشكل تدريجي. وعند قمة السفح تقوم هضبة فسيحة ترتفع تدريجياً نحو الشرق، وتطل باتجاه الشمال على مرج ابن عامر ومن الجنوب الغربي تطل على سهل عرابة الذي يرتفع قرابة 250م، وبالتالي يظهر السفح الذي تقوم عليه المدينة، عتبة بين سهل مرج ابن عامر وبين سهل عرابة.\n\nقرى جنين\nفي محافظة جنين مدينتان، مدينة جنين وقباطية، ويتبع المحافظة 14 بلدية كبيرة (هي يعبد، عرابة، برقين، صانور، سيلة الحارثية، سيلة الظهر، الزبابدة، اليامون، كفر راعي، كفر دان، ميثلون، دير أبو ضعيف، جبع، عجة، صير)، كما ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من القرى ومخيم يقع إلى الغرب من المدينة، والذي تعرض للاجتياح الإسرائيلي في شهر نيسان عام 2002. كانت جنين تضم قبل نكبة 1948 حوالي (70) قرية كبيرة وصغيرة وبعد النكبة اقتصرت على ما يقارب 30 قرية صغيرة. ومثل باقي المدن الفلسطينية، تعرضت أراضي شاسعة من جنين وقراها للمصادرة من قبل إسرائيل، حيث أقام على أرضها ما يزيد عن 10 مستوطنات.\n\nالمناخ\nيختلف مناخ منطقة جنين عن المناخ العام لفلسطين، وذلك لوضعها الطبوغرافي. فتقع المدينة على ارتفاع يتراوح بين 125 و225 متر، كما تحاط بعدد من المرتفعات، فمن الشرق تحيط بها جبال جلبون ومن الجنوب والغرب والشمال الغربي تحيط بها جبال نابلس وامتدادها في جبل الكرمل، وإن انفتاحها على مرج ابن عامر تقفله جبال الجليل على بعد لا يتجاوز 20 كم. هذا الوضع قلل من استفادة المدينة من الرياح الغربية والجنوبية الغربية الماطرة والمعدلة لدرجة الحرارة، كما عمل على إبعاد مناخ جنين عن مناخ البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وجعلته أكثر تطرفاً. مثلاً، تتلقى منطقة جنين كمية من الأمطار أقل من كمية الأمطار التي تتلقاها منطقة يعبد المجاورة بمئة وخمسين مليمترا، وحرارتها أعلى من حرارة المنطقة المجاورة.\n\nالسكان\nإن نمو عدد السكان في جنين لم يكن بمعدل كبير في الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 1922 و1931، وذلك بسبب هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى مدن السهل الساحلي، إلا أن هذا النمو بدأ يرتفع فيما بعد ليتضاعف عام 1947م؛ بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها، وبفعل الركود الاقتصادي الذي أصاب المناطق الساحلية، وبحكم الحرب العالمية الثانية والأحداث الجارية في المنطقة. وفي عام 1952 سجل تعداد سكان جنين ارتفاعاً كبيراً بعد تدفق أعداد كبيرة من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عقب نكبة العام 1948، وعاد لينخفض انخفاضاً حاداً عام 1967 بسبب نزوح أعداد كبيرة من سكان المدينة إلى شرق الأردن ودول الخليج في أعقاب نكسة عام 1967. وفي سنة 1980 عاد عدد السكان للارتفاع بسبب عودة سكان المدينة إليها وما زال يواصل ارتفاعه حتى الآن.\nوفقاً لإحصاء عام 2007، فقد بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 39,000 نسمة، من بينهم 19,238 إناث و 19,766 ذكور. كما يبلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين الذي يقع غرب المدينة 16,000 لاجئ، حسب إحصائيات وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) والتي أشارت إلى أن 42.3% من سكان المخيم هم دون سن الخمسة عشر عام، وهذا يعني أن النسبة الكبرى من سكان جنين ومخيمها من الشباب. أما بالنسبة للعدد الإجمالي لسكان محافظة جنين فقد بلغ في عام 2007 حوالي 256,000 نسمة، وهو ما يشكل نسبة 6,8% من تعداد الشعب الفلسطيني داخل الأراضي الفلسطينية. يُشكل مسلم الغالبية العظمى من السكان كباقي مناطق الأراضي الفلسطينية، وتتواجد أقلية المسيحية في إسرائيل تنتشر في بعض قرى المحافظة وفي جنين نفسها. وهذا جدول بأعداد سكان منطقة جنين في سنوات مختلفة:\n\nمخيم جنين\nأسست وكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (UNRWA) مخيمَ اللاجئين عام 1953 برعاية أردنية. ويقع المخيم غرب مركز المدينة، ويمتد على مساحة ضيقة لا تتجاوز الكيلومتر المربع، ويعيش فيه كما ذُكر ما يقارب 16,000 لاجئ، مما يجعله بقعة مكتظة سكانياً، وهو أمر غير صحي وخصوصًا في ظل النقص الحاد في الخدمات الأساسية.\n\nكان مخيم جنين هدفا استراتيجيا لقوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي حيث حاولت استهدافه مرات عدة، لكنها فشلت أمام مقاومة أبنائه، حيث وجدت قوات الاحتلال صموداً من سكانه الذين أصروا على البقاء داخل المخيم رغم الأضرار الكبيرة التي تعرضوا لها، وبلغت الاعتداءات الإسرائيلية على المخيم ذروتها فجر 3 نيسان سنة 2002 حين اقتحمت المخيم واشتبكت مع فصائل المقاومة بحرب شوارع أطلق عليها لاحقاً معركة جنين.\n\nالمواصلات\nكان لموقع جنين أكبر الأثر في حياة المدينة قديماً وحديثاً، ويظهر ذلك في تاريخها الاقتصادي والاجتماعي، وفي أهميتها كعقدة مواصلات بين جبال فلسطين الوسطى (نابلس - القدس - الخليل) ومدنها، وبين شمال فلسطين لا سيما طريق القدس - الناصرة. كما تتفرع من المدينة طرق إلى حيفا وعكا. وقد حظيت مدينة جنين باهتمام بالغ من حيث المواصلات، حيث عُبدت الطرق إليها قبل الطرق الساحلية التي كانت تعتبر أهم الطرق بالنسبة للمستعمرين أيام الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ولم تتوقف أهمية المدينة على الطرق البرية، بل امتدت أهميتها إلى الخطوط الحديدية، حيث يمر بها خط يصل إلى العفولة ومن ثم بيسان فطبريا.\nتعدّ مدينة جنين من المدن الفلسطينية التي نشأت قديمِاً وتطورت عمرانيًا وذلك نتيجة للتزايد السكاني، ولكن لم تتطور شبكة المواصلات فيها بشكل مواز، ويعود ذلك لفترات الاحتلال المتعاقبة والتي مرت بها المدينة، والظروف الاقتصادية والاجتماعية الناجمة، مما أدى إلى ظهور العديد من المشاكل في نظاِم المواصلات سواءً على مستوى تخطيط وتنظيم الطرقات والشوارع، أو على مستوى البنية الإنشائية للطرق.\n\nتأتي أهمية مدينة جنين من حيث نوع الخدمات التي تقدمها والمؤسسات الموجودةِ فيها، والتي تتضمن مكاتب حكومية ومدارس، ومستشفيات، وبنوك، وأسواق، ومحلات تجارية ومنطقة صناعية، والتي تقدم خدمات للقرى والبلدات في المحافظة. إضافة لذلك، فان أهمية المدينة تعود إلى الطرق الإقليمية والتي تم تخطيطها من قبل وزارة التخطيط والتي تمر عبر مدينة جنين، فالطريق الأولى من وادي الأردن إلى الناصرة، والأخرى تربط الخليل بحيفا وتمر عبر مدينتي نابلس ورام الله، وتأتي أهمية المدينة أيضا بسبب قربها من الخط الأخضر الوهمي الذي يفصل مناطق عام 1948 عن المناطق المحتلة عام 1967، حيث تشكل مركزا للتسوق للفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر.\nوتزداد أهمية النقل في مدينة جنين وذلك نتيجة للتوسع المدينة ونموها المتسارع. ويستخدم سكان المدينة في تنقلهم داخل المدينة وسائل نقل مختلفة. إلا أنه تبين من المسح الميداني عام 2007، أن هناك انخفاض في استخدام السيارات الخاصة في المدينة، حيث بلغت نسبة الأسر التي تمتلك سيارة خاصة 13.8% من مجموع الأسر بالمدينة. في مقابل ذلك يلاحظ ارتفاع في استخدام سيارات الأجرة وخاصة للتنقل بين مركز المدينة ومناطقها المختلفة، حيث بلغت نسبة مستخدمي هذه الوسيلة 43.9%، وبنسبة أقل للحافلات تبلغ 25.3% من مجموع السكان.\nتتكون الشبكة الحالية للطرق في مدينة جنين من مجموعة من الممرات الرئيسية، التي يتراوح عرضها من أربع مسارب إلى مسربين، تربط أجزاء المدينة ببعضها، كما تربطها بمدن فلسطينية أخرى، بالإضافة لقرى محافظة جنين، وهذه الطرق هي:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمدينة جنين إحدى المدن الرئيسية في فلسطين، بالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها تاريخياً حتى النكبة، مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلاً اقتصادياً يفوق حجمها السكاني بشدة، وهذا يعود لتمتع المحافظة بخصائص طبيعية متنوعة وفرت لها موارد اقتصادية متنوعة لا سيما في مجال التعليم والخدمات والمهن والحرف، مما مكن أبناءها من إيجاد فرص عمل في الدول العربية المجاورة، وهذا بدوره خفض من أثر المدينة بالمساهمة الفعالة بالحجم السكاني في الضفة الغربية، ولكنه أتاح الفرصة لرفع معدلات حوالات المغتربين للمدينة والمحافظة بشكل كبير مما أثر على اقتصاد المدينة والبلاد بشكل إيجابي. تدير غرفة تجارة وصناعة وزراعة لواء جنين الأوضاع الاقتصادية في المدينة.\n\nالتجارة\nوتنتشر الأسواق في مدينة جنين: فهناك السوق الشعبي، سوق الحلال، سوق الجملة، سوق السيباط، سوق شارع الناصرة، سوق شارع أبو بكر، سوق شارع بورسعيد، سوق شارع فيصل، سوق شارع الهلال، سوق شارع فاطمة خاتون، وسوق الحسبة القديمة. وتحتوي الأسواق المذكورة على العديد من المحلات التجارية المختلفة. بالإضافة إلى سوق تجاري رئيس يقع وسط المدينة وآخر يقع شمال المدينة مخصص لاستقبال المتسوقين الفلسطينيين داخل الخط الأخضر الذين يشكلون 85% من القوة الشرائية حسب تقديرات الغرفة التجارية والصناعية في جنين.\n\nالزراعة\nتعتبر الزراعة نشاطاً رئيسياً في مدينة جنين ومحافظتها، حيث يعتمد عليها غالبية السكان سواء كان ذلك بصورة مباشرة أو غير مباشرة. وقبل هجرة بعض سكانها إلى دول الخليج في ستينات القرن العشرين، كانت الزراعة هي المورد الوحيد في المنطقة. وتعد مدينة جنين زراعية لحد كبير إذ تشكل مركز التسويق والتمويل الزراعي للمحافظة، حيث تعد أراضيها الزراعية واحدة من أكثر المناطق خصوبة في الضفة الغربية، حيث تزرع سنوياً بالمحاصيل الحقلية والخضار والأشجار المثمرة كالزيتون واللوزيات والحمضيات، بالإضافة إلى استخدام البيوت البلاستيكية على نطاق واسع. كما تشتهر المحافظة منذ عقود بزراعة فاكهة البطيخ بشكل لافت. قدرت وزارة الزراعة الفلسطينية مساحة الأرض المزروعة في المحافظة عام 1998/1997، حوالي 367,415 دونم وهو ما يعادل حوالي 20% من مساحة الأرض المزروعة في الأراضي الفلسطينية.\nتتمتع منطقة جنين وطوباس بثروة حرجية تميزها على باقي محافظات السلطة الفلسطينية، وتنتشر الغابات على مساحة تقارب 270,000 دونم، تشكل حوالي 85% من أحراش الضفة الغربية، إلا أنها تقع في الغالب في التصنيف (ج) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\n\nالصناعة\nبدأ اقتصاد المدينة يتحول تدريجياً إلى الصناعة بعد قدوم السلطة الفلسطينية في منتصف تسعينات القرن الفائت، وبالأخص الصناعات الخفيفة والمتوسطة، حيث ستنشأ منطقة صناعية دولية من أجل تفعيل الحركة الاقتصادية وتنشيطها، وإيجاد فرص عمل لعدد كبير من أهالي المنطقة، وجعل جنين همزة وصل بين عرب الداخل وباقي مناطق السلطة الفلسطينية. ويمكن إجمال هذه الصناعات بالتالي: صناعات زراعية، وتشمل معاصر الزيتون والمطاحن؛ وصناعات خاصة بالبناء وتشمل المقالع والمحاجر والكسارات وصناعة البلاط والفسيفساء؛ وصناعة الملابس والأحذية والخشب والحديد.\nفي عام 2008، افتتح مهرجان للصناعات الوطنية الفلسطينية في القرية السياحية شرق جنين، برعاية السلطة الفلسطينية وبدعم أوروبي، وكان لذلك شأن كبير في تقدم المشاريع الاقتصادية وتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي في المحافظة والأراضي الفلسطينية بصورة عامة.\n\nالعمارة\nتعتبر مدينة جنين مدينة سكنية إلى حد كبير، بالإضافة لكونها مركز تجاري وزراعي، إلا أن طابع المنازل والبنايات السكنية يغلب عليها، ويختلف حجم البناء ومساحة المساكن بالنسبة للمدينة عنه في المدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، فبلغ متوسط عدد الغرف فيها 4.5 غرفة لعام 2007، بينما المعدل العام في المدن الفلسطينية هو 3.6 غرفة، وقد يعود هذا إلى عدد من العوامل منها العادات والتقاليد، حيث أن البناء حجمه وشكله ومادته كلها تعزز القيمة الاجتماعية للأسرة. ويظهر ذلك بوضوح عند الذين تركوا الأرياف ثم انتقلوا إلى السكن في مدينة جنين، كما للدخل دور في عدد الغرف بالمسكن.\nوتتوفر في محافظة جنين مناطق متعددة يتم استخراج حجارة البناء منها ومن هذه المناطق قباطيا وعجة وغيرها، مما دفع الكثير من السكان لاستخدام الحجارة في بناء مساكنهم بنسبة عالية. ويستخدم الطوب أيضا بنسبة كبيرة - خاصة بمخيم المدينة، كما تستخدم الدكة والطين بنسب أقل. إن نسبة المساكن المبنية من الحجر بلغت 40.5% من مساكن المدينة، وهي نسبة مقاربة للنسبة العامة لمدن الضفة الغربية والتي هي 40% حسب إحصاء سنة 1997.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة جنين مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، وهي الأولى على مستوى الضفة الغربية، حيث تشاطر النسبة ذاتها تقريباً كل من سلفيت وطولكرم - وتبلغ نسبة الأمية في محافظة جنين 3,9% من الذين هم أكبر من 10 سنوات، بينما المعدل العام في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nعرفت المدينة حركة تعليمية منذ أمد بعيد، حيث كان نظام (الكتاتيب) سائداً منذ بداية القرن التاسع عشر. وقد شهدت مساجد المدينة الحلقات التدريسية والمناظرات العلمية من قبل مشاهير العلماء المسلمين، وغلب على هذه الحركة العلمية الطابع الديني حيث كانت تدرس علوم الدين المختلفة من فقه وحديث.\nوفي نهاية القرن التاسع عشر أقيمت أول مدرسة ابتدائية ضمت أربعة صفوف، ثم تبع إنشاء المدرسة الابتدائية أخرى علياً. وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى بعد الانتداب البريطاني، لأن البريطانيين لم يكونوا معنيين بتطور الخدمات العامة لا سيما الخدمات التعليمية. وفي عام 1943 ارتفعت معدلات التضخم في البلاد بشكل حاد، وهذا دفع الاستعمار البريطاني للقيام ببعض الخدمات لامتصاص الفائض النقدي في البلاد، فأنشأ في مدينة جنين مدرسة ثانوية، دفع الأهالي تكاليفها بالكامل. ومن الأمور التي ساهمت فعلاً في تطوير الحركة العلمية في المدينة تشكيل لجنة المعارف المحلية التي كانت مهمتها البحث في الموارد والمصادر المالية التي يمكن عن طريقها تطوير التعليم في المدينة.\n\nوبعد حرب سنة 1948 لم يكن في المدينة سوى مدرستين، واحدة للذكور وأخرى للإناث. وبعد تولي الحكومة الأردنية زاد عدد المدارس وتضاعف عدد الطلاب.\nوفي عام 1982 بلغ عدد المدارس في مدينة جنين إحدى عشرة مدرسة للذكور وست مدراس للإناث، وبلغ عدد الطلاب في هذه السنة 2610 طالباً و2495 طالبة ومما تجدر الإشارة إليه هو أن عدد الطلاب الذكور في هذه السنة لم يتجاوز عدد الطلاب عام 1960. هذا يشير إلى ظاهرة الهجرة من المدينة في الفترة التي تلت حرب سنة 1967، أما من حيث الطالبات فقد تضاعف عددهن تقريباً بين هاتين السنتين.\nأنشأت الحكومة الأردنية في عام 1965 مديرية التربية والتعليم في جنين لتشرف على 65 مدرسة موزعة بين الذكور والإناث في التجمعات السكانية المختلفة التابعة للواء جنين آنذاك ويعمل بها 508 معلمة ومعلم. في عام 2005 بلغ عدد المدارس التابعة للمديرية 110 مدارس، وعدد الطلبة 37,531 طالب وطالبة وعدد المعلمين 1,852 معلم ومعلمة.\nأما على صعيد التعليم العالي، فقد شهدت جنين طفرةً كبيرةً في أعداد حَمَلة شهادات البكالوريوس والماجستير في كثير من التخصصات سواء في الضفة الغربية أو في الخارج. ويتبع تنظيم محافظة جنين اليوم جامعة خاصة هي الجامعة العربية الأمريكية - جنين وفرع لجامعة القدس المفتوحة، والتي لا تقتصر خدماتها التعليمية على سكان محافظة جنين فقط، بل تمتد هذه الخدمات لتشمل القرى وبعض المدن المحيطة بها.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءً من هوية سكان منطقة جنين منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الريف الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو اللهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى كاف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبة للزي التقليدي الذي تميز في منطقة جنين وشمال الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأبيض المقلم طولياً. كذلك يظهر التأثير الريفي في المطبخ الفلسطيني لهذا الجزء من فلسطين والذي يشتهر بطبق المسخن الشعبي، الذي يعتبر في نفس الوقت من الأكلات الوطنية في المطبخ الفلسطيني.\nتحوي جنين وقراها عدداً كبيراً من المعالم الثقافية البارزة على مستوى الضفة الغربية، لكنها في الغالب إما أن تكون قد عانت أو تضررت بسبب الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. فقد تم في عام 2009 العمل على إعادة ترميم وتأهيل سينما جنين بدعم ألماني -والتي كانت تعتبر من أكبر صالات العرض في الضفة الغربية- بعد إغلاقها مدة تزيد عن 22 عاماً، أي بعد الانتفاضة الأولى مباشرة.\nبموازاة ذلك يوجد في مخيم جنين مسرح هو مسرح الحرية. يعتبر مسرح الحرية الأول في المنطقة والوحيد، تأسس عام 1990. يعمل المسرح على عقد ورش عمل مختلفة في مجالي الدراما وموسيقى الأطفال والشباب، حيث يقوم كادر العمل المسرحي بتدريب استشاريين من الشباب للعمل مع المشاركين من مخيم جنين. يوفر المسرح أيضاً دورات في العلاج من خلال التمثيل المسرحي. وتجدر الإشارة إلى أنه يقام في محافظة جنين كل عام مهرجان ثقافي هو مهرجان مرج ابن عامر للتراث والثقافة والذي يعكس الوجه الحضاري والثقافي للمحافظة والضفة الغربية بشكل عام.\nوفي جنين أيضاً مركزاً للثقافة والإبداع أُسّس عام 2005، ومعهد جنين للموسيقى يضم أوركسترا جنين للشباب، ومتحف جنين للتراث الشعبي يحاكي تاريخ فلسطين ويعتبر الأول من نوعه في البلاد، وهو يجسد جانبا من تاريخ فلسطين منذ العهدة العمرية وحتى عودة الرئيس ياسر عرفات إلى فلسطين، ويقع في القرية السياحية جنوب شرق المدينة.\n\nالإعلام\nتوجد في جنين محطتان محليتان للبث الأرضي هما تلفزيون جنين المركزي وتلفزيون فرح، كما تبث محطتان إذاعيتان من المدينة على موجة (إف أم) هما: راديو البلد - جنين وصوت الأحلام، يغطي بثيهما معظم مناطق شمال الضفة الغربية.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nتحوي المدينة عدداً قليلاً من المنشآت الكبيرة في المجالات الخدمية والاجتماعية والصحية، فتوجد بعض المستشفيات الصغيرة والعيادات بالإضافة إلى مستشفى جنين الحكومي ومستشفى الشفاء. أما بالنسبة للجانب الرياضي، فيوجد في جنين ملعب يتبع البلدية ويتسع لثلاثة آلاف متفرج، يلعب فيه نادي جنين الرياضي الذي يلعب في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز، إضافة إلى عدة فرق تنتشر في قرى المحافظة. وتوجد في المدينة العديد من المكتبات أهمها مكتبة البلدية القديمة وسط المدينة.\n\nبلدية جنين\nتم إنشاء أول بلدية في مدينة جنين عام 1886 برئاسة الحاج عبد المجيد منصور حيث كان عدد الناخبين لا يتجاوز الثمانين ناخباً من بينهم ستة أعضاء بطريقة الاقتراع السري، بحيث يعين المتصرف الرئيسي من بين الأعضاء المنتخبين لمدة أربع سنوات. وقد بقي التشريع التركي هذا معمولاً به إلى أن صدر القانون رقم 17 لسنة 1954م. وظل الوضع كما هو إلى أن قامت السلطات الإسرائيلية بإقالة آخر مجلس منتخب سنة 1982 والذي كان برئاسة أحمد شوقي موسى المحمود، وتسلمت إسرائيل إدارة البلدية حتى عام 1995 حيث تشكلت لجنة وطنية برئاسة وليد أبو مويس، وقد تسلم رئاستها بقرار رئاسي من الرئيس ياسر عرفات في تشرين الأول من سنة 1995، أي بعد تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية. وتتبع بلدية جنين اليوم 14 بلدية وحوالي 30 قرية في المحافظة.\n\nقائمة رؤساء بلدية جنين\nتوالى على رئاسة بلدية جنين 18 شخصًا هم:\n\nانظر أيضًا\nمعركة جنين\nفيلم جنين\nاجتياح جنين (2023)\n\nمراجع\nقراءات أخرى\nوصلات خارجية\n\nمعلومات عن جنين من صفحة مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الإنسانية
