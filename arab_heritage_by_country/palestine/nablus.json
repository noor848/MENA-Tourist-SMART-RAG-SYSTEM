      "content": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.\n\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nFlavia Neapolis ('new city of the emperor Flavius') was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called Mabartha ('the passage') or Mamorpha. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city's founding include Joseph's Tomb and Jacob's Well. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.\nInsofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.\n\nIn 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.\nSi'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres (360 ha) in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.\n\nConflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.\nAs tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.\nThus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nNeapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city's name was retained in its Arabicized form, Nabulus. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.\nUnder Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed \"Little Damascus.\" At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.\n\nCrusader period\nThe city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nCrusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a \"celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.\" He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.\n\nIn October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.\nThe successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.\nThe Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon, and later converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque in 1244. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.\nThe Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city \"full of trees and streams and full of olives.\" He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.\n\nOttoman era\nNablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaks ('districts'): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaks were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ('subdistricts'), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.\nAfter decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.\nThe most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama's rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of mutasallim ('tax collector, strongman') of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.\n\nEgyptian rule and Ottoman revival\nIn 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma'in nahiya—rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.\nEgyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaks under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no \"foreigners\" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct \"supervision\" of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.\n\nWorld War I and British Mandate\nBetween 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.\nThe 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous \"picturesque\" character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 partition plan for Palestine.\n\nJordanian occupation\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian occupation. Thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps are still located within the city limits today: Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian occupation, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950.\n\nIsraeli period\nThe Six-Day War ended with the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.\nBassam Shakaa was elected mayor in 1976, and four years later he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground on 2 June 1980, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. The Israeli administration removed him from office in the spring of 1982, and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.\nIn response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city on 29 July 1985 that was lifted 2 hours a day. Najah University was closed for two months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.\nThe Israeli administration ended in January 1986 with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce, al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans, he was assassinated on 2 March 1986, widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nSalah el Bah'sh was shot with a rubber bullet by an Israeli soldier on 18 June 1989 whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B'Tselem that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting \"Ta'amod\" (Halt!). Bah'sh died and the army indicated that an investigation was being carried out.\n\nPalestinian control\nJurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nablus is neighbored by Israeli settlements, and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.\nThe city was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said in 2008 that the city remains \"capital of terror\" of the West Bank.\nFrom the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (mountain of fire) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more Palestinian suicide attacks than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of \"knowhow\" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.\nThe operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.\nThe Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes in August 2016 between a militant group and Palestinian police. Two Palestinian Police officers were killed by terrorists in the city on 18 August. Shortly after, the police raid on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militants were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.\n\nGeography\nNablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at 940 meters (3,080 ft), while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is 881 meters (2,890 ft) high.\nNablus is located 42 kilometers (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv, Israel, 110 kilometers (68 mi) west of Amman, Jordan and 63 kilometers (39 mi) north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.\n\nOld City\nIn the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.\nThere are six hamaams (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.\n\nClimate\nThe relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being 29.6 °C (85.3 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 6.2 °C (43.2 °F). Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately 656 mm (25.8 in).\n\nDemographics\nIn 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 'the chief part of whom are Mohammedans', with some Jews and Christians and 'about 150 Samaritans'. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).\nThe 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 \"other\").\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents. Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate's inhabitants.\nApproximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).\n\nReligion\nIn 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.  However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.\nThe majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.\nIn 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.\nThere are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.\n\nEconomy\nBeginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of \nthe caravan (amir al-hajj), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.\n\nIn 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside  the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the  slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and mulukhiyya were grown in the fields and grain mills were  scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kg (496,040 lb) of the product by 1837.\nToday, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries\n such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.\n Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.\nThe Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus\nproduced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda  imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel.  In 2003, there were eight restaurants  and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The  soap industry has suffered  from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. \n\nThe Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.\nBefore 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.\nSince the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.\nNablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.\nNablus has been ranked as the 5th best city in the Middle East to learn Arabic. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.\n\nHealthcare\nThere are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National), and the Rafidia Surgical Hospital, which is located in the western neighborhood of Rafidiya, and is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. The Nablus Speciality Hospital was built in 2001, which is specializes in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasty.\n\nCulture and arts\nNablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. Nabulsi, meaning \"from Nablus\", is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.\n\nTraditional costume\nNablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk (\"market\"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob (\"robe\"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh (\"square chest piece\").\n\nCuisine\nNablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of \"high cuisine\", such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nKanafeh (or Kunafa) is the best known Nabulsi sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, kanafeh Nabulsi uses a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.\nOther sweets made in Nablus include baklawa, \"Tamriya\", mabrumeh and ghuraybeh, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an \"S\"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.\n\nCultural centers\nThere are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, dabke classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.\n\nSoap production\nNabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.\nMade in a cube-like shape about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of \"the page of an old book.\" The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap's sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw. Today, qilw is still used in combination with lime.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Nablus is the muhfaza (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.\nThe two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.\nYaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.\n\nMayors\nModern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.\nThe current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa \"Dweikat\", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.\n\nMunicipal services\nIn 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.\nThe majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.\n\nFire department\nNablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the \"fire brigade\" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.\n\nTransportation\nIn the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.\nThe main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.\nThe nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.\n\nSports\nThe Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city's football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nNablus is twinned, or has sister city relationships with:\n\nSee also\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority\nList of people from Nablus\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWelcome To The City of Nablus\nNablus City, Welcome to Palestine\nA site explaining the reasons for the devastated Palestinian economy\nNablus the Culture, reviving cultural life in Nablus Archived 15 April 2022 at the Wayback Machine\nNablus after Five Years of Conflict December 2005 report by OCHA (PDF).\nArchaeological Remains Found in Nablus\nPicture showing Nablus from east (Panorama)\nPicture showing east region of Nablus (Panorama) – The picture taken from Askar\nBahjat Sabri, \"Urban Aspects in the City of Nablus in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\" An-Najah University Journal for Research - Humanities, Volume 6 (1992)",
      "summary": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.",

      "content": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nإذا كانت فلسطين قلب الوطن العربي لربطها شماله بجنوبه وشرقه بغربه، فإن نابلس هي قلب فلسطين لربطها شمالها بجنوبها وشرقها بغربها. كانت المدينة مركزاً للواء نابلس في الضفة الغربية بعد عام 1948م وتحولت في منتصف الستينات مركزاً لمحافظة نابلس، تتمتع بموقع جغرافي هام فهي تتوسط إقليم المرتفعات الجبلية الفلسطينية وجبال نابلس، وتعد حلقة في سلسلة المدن الجبلية من الشمال إلى الجنوب وتقع على مفترق الطرق الرئيسية التي تمتد من الناصرة وجنين شمالاً حتى الخليل جنوباً ومن يافا غرباً حتى جسر دامية شرقًا. تبعد عن القدس 69 كم وعن عمان 114 كم وعن البحر المتوسط 42 كم، تربطها بمدنها وقراها شبكة جيدة من الطرق تصلها بطولكرم وقلقيلية ويافا غرباً وبعمان شرقاً وبجنين والناصرة شمالاً وبالقدس جنوباً. في عام 1915 ربطت نابلس مع خط سكة حديد الحجاز الممتد من دمشق إلى المدينة المنورة.\nأقيمت نابلس في أجمل بقعة جغرافية في وسط فلسطين. وصفها شيخ الربوة الدمشقي بأنها «قصر في بستان». قال عنها عمر السكندري في كتابه «تاريخ سوريا» المطبوع في بيروت عام 1882:\n\nيرتفع وسط مدينة نابلس 550 مترا فوق سطح البحر بينما يبلغ ارتفاع أطرافها حتى 800 متر ف.س.ب. تقدر مساحة المدينة العمرانية بحوالي 12700 دونم. يمتد عمران المدينة فوق جبل عيبال شمالاً وجبل جرزيم جنوباً وبينهما وادٍ يمتد نحو الغرب. ولخصوصية الموقع الجغرافي لمدينة نابلس المتمثلة بانحصارها بين جبلين تتواجد في المدينة العشرات من عيون المياه التي تزيد من جمال وبهاء المدينة ومنها عين العسل، عين الست، عين الكاس، عين حسين، عين القريون، عين ميرة، عين الخضر، عين الصلاحي، عين السكر، عين الصبيان، عين الساطور، عين العجيبة، عين بدران، عين التوباني، عين بير الدولاب، عين التوتة بالإضافة إلى سبل المياه مثل سبيل الغزاوي وسبيل الخضر وسبيل السلقية وسبيل الساطور.\n\nتضم مدينة نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية، كبرى الجامعات الفلسطينية وأقدمها وأرفعها مستوى. أسست بلدية المدينة عام 1869 وهي تشرف على تنظيم المدينة وعلى المرافق العامة.\nتذكر كتب التاريخ وصف بعض الرحالة العرب لنابلس بدمشق الصغرى للتشابه مع دمشق بمعالمها ومناخها ومياهها وينابيعها وجبالها وفاكهتها وخضارها وحتى في لهجتها وكثير من عاداتها وتقاليدها. وهي أكثر مدن فلسطين شبهاً وارتباطاً بدمشق وسورية منذ فجر التاريخ، حيث كان تجارها يصدرون الصابون والمنتجات المحلية الأخرى إلى دمشق ويعودون بالأقمشة والتوابل. إضافة إلى ذلك، يعود أصل العديد من عائلات نابلس إلى مناطق في سورية حالياً، مثل عائلة النمر التي قدمت من منطقة حمص وحماة وعائلة طوقان التي قدمت من منطقة حماة.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في نابلس مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت). يتساقط المطر بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش).\n\nقرى وبلدات نابلس\nيحيط بنابلس عدد كبير من القرى ولكنها معزولة عنها بالحواجز العسكرية الإسرائيلية، ففي الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية تم خنق المدينة بعدة حواجز عسكرية مثل حاجز حوارة من المدخل الجنوبي، وحاجز بيت إيبا من المدخل الغربي، وحاجز (17) من المدخل الشمالي وحاجز الباذان من المدخل الشرقي، وبعد انتهاء الانتفاضة الثانية أزيلت هذه الحواجز، ثم أُنشئت حواجز جديدة بعد عملية طوفان الأقصى عام 2023 مثل حاجزي حوارة وعورتا على طريق رام الله نابلس جنوباً، وحاجز المربعة قرب قرية تل من الجهة الجنوبية الغربية، وحاجز صرة على طريق قلقيلية نابلس غرباً، وحاجز الطور جنوباً، وحاجز دير شرف من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق طولكرم نابلس، وحاجز مستوطنة شافي شمرون من الجهة الغربية الشمالية على طريق جنين نابلس، إضافة إلى بعض الحواجز العسكرية المتنقلة غير الدائمة مثل حاجزي الباذان وبيت فوريك شرقاً، وحاجز (17) شمالاً.\nمن قراها:

سكان المدينة في عام 1596 يتألفون من 806 أسر مسلمة و18 أسرة مسيحية و15 أسرة يهودية و20 أسرة سامرية، والأخيرة طائفة دينية يسمى أفرادها بالسمرة أو السامريين. عاش السامريون قبل حرب 1967 في نابلس كمواطنين أردنيين يتمتعون بكافة حريات المواطنة كحال مسلمي ومسيحيي المدينة.\n\nخلال أوائل القرن التاسع عشر، قدر قسطنطين بازيلي سكان ناحية نابلس بستة وعشرين ألف عائلة منها ما يقارب 1000 عائلةٍ مسيحية. وتفيد السجلات العثمانية أن عدد سكان نابلس بلغ 2000 نسمة عام 1849، وفي عام 1867 قال زوّار أمريكيون، أن البلدة بلغ عدد سكانها 4,000 نسمة «أكثرهم محمديون»، وبعض اليهود والمسيحيين، وحوالي 150 سامريّا. قدر عمر السكندري عام 1882 عدد سكانها بثمانية آلاف معظمهم مسلمون. وفي عام 1922 أظهر الإحصاء الرسمي البريطاني لسكان فلسطين، أن عدد سكان المدينة بلغ 15,947 نسمة، ثم ارتفع إلى 17,498 عند إحصاء عام 1931، و21900 نسمة عام 1941 ووصل عام 1945 إلى حوالي 23300 نسمة. وبعد الاحتلال الصهيوني عام 1967 بلغ قرابة 61,050 نسمة، وعاد ليرتفع إلى 106,900 عام 1987.\nبلغ عدد سكان نابلس 134,116 نسمة، في منتصف عام 2006، وفقًا للجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني. وفي إحصاء الجهاز لعام 1997، ظهر أن عدد سكان المدينة وصل إلى 100,034 نسمة، بما فيهم 23,397 لاجئ يشكلون 24% من سكان المدينة. وصل عدد سكان مدينة نابلس القديمة إلى 12,000 نسمة عام 2006. تشكل المدينة المسكن لحوالي 40% من سكان المحافظة. توجد في المدينة أربعة مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين هي عين بيت الماء وبلاطة وعسكر القديم وعسكر الجديد، يسكنها ما يفوق مجموعه ال40,000 نسمة.\nيشكل الشباب قسمًا كبيرًا من سكان نابلس، فقرابة نصف السكان يبلغون أعمارًا أقل من 20 سنة. بلغت نسبة السكان الذين تقل أعمارهم عن 10 سنوات، عام 1997، 28.4%، و20.8% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 10 و19 سنة، 17.7% للذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 20 و29 عام، 18% بين 30 و44 سنة، 11.1% بين 45 و64 سنة، و3.7% للذين تصل أعمارهم لأكثر من 65 عام. أما التوزيع بين الجنسين فكانت نسبته 50.92% (50,945 فردا) للذكور، و49.07% (49,089 فردا للإناث).\n\nالديانة\nكانت نابلس في عام 891 الميلادي، أي خلال العهود الأولى للحكم العربي، تحوي تنوعا دينيا كبيرا، وكان أكثرية سكانها يدينون بالإسلام، المسيحية، والسامرية. يقول الجغرافي شمس الدين الأنصاري الدمشقي، أن المدينة كانت خلال العهد المملوكي، مأهولة بالمسلمين، السامريين، المسيحيين الأرثوذكس، المسيحيين الكاثوليك، واليهود. أظهر إحصاء عام 1931 أن المدينة حوت 16,483 مسلمًا، 533 مسيحيًّا، 6 يهود، و167 شخص يدينون بأديان أخرى، على الأرجح أن معظمهم سامريّون.\nإن معظم سكان نابلس اليوم يدينون بالإسلام، ولا يزال هناك أيضًا بعض المسيحيين والسامريين. يُعتقد أن كثيرًا من الفلسطينيين المسلمين في المدينة يتحدرون من سامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام عند الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام، والبعض من أسماء العائلات المسلمة اليوم يتم ربطها بالسامريين ويُقال أن أجدادهم كانوا من أتباع ذلك الدين - مثل آل مسلماني وآل يعيش وغيرهم. يقول المؤرخ فياض الطيف، أن أعدادًا كبيرة من السامريين اعتنقوا الإسلام بسبب الاضطهاد الذي كانوا يتعرضون له، وبسبب الطبيعة التوحيدية للدين الجديد، الأمر الذي جعلهم يتقبلونه بصورة أسهل وأسرع.\nكان يسكن في المدينة حوالي 3,500 مسيحي عام 1967، ولكن أعدادهم انخفضت إلى 650 عام 2008. يتألف المسيحيين في نابلس حاليّا، من 70 أسرة روم أرثوذكس، حوالي 30 أسرة من الروم الملكيين الكاثوليك، و30 أسرة أنجليكانية. كان معظم المسيحيين يسكنون في ضاحية رفيديا بالقسم الغربي من المدينة.\n\nتاريخ نابلس\nالتاريخ القديم\nنابلس أو شكيم بالكنعانية، مدينة من أقدم مدن العالم يعود تاريخها إلى 5600 سنة (حوالي سنة 3600 ق.م). أسست عند ملتقى أقدام جبلي جرزيم في القسم الشرقي لمدينة نابلس الحالية على يد العرب الكنعانيين فوق تل كبير يدعى الآن تل بلاطة، وقد أسماها الكنعانيون في ذلك الوقت \"شكيم\" والتي تعني المكان المرتفع، ومن ثم أصبحت من أشهر المدن الكنعانية. أقدم من سكن \"شكيم\" من العرب هم الحويون و‌الفرزيون. صارعت نابلس الكثير من الغزاة والمحتلين عبر تاريخها الطويل، بحيث غزاها كل من الفراعنة المصريين والقبائل العبرية والآشوريين والابليين والفارسيين واليونانيين والسلوقيين، إلى أن سقطت بيد الرومان سنة 63 قبل الميلاد.\nورد ذكر شكيم في نصوص إيبلا التي اكتشفها عالم الآثار الإيطالي باولو ماتييه ضمن مدن كنعانية أخرى في فلسطين، وهي إضافة إلى شكيم بيت جبرين وأريحا وأورسالم (يبوس) ومجيدو وبيسان. ورد ذكرها أيضاً في رسائل تل العمارنة (1400 ق.م) باسم شاكمي، كما ذكرت في تقارير تحتمس الثالث أيضاً.\n\nتشير النصوص المصرية القديمة بأن شكيم كانت مدينةً محصنةً إستراتيجية ذات أهمية دولية منذ سنة 1800 ق.م، كما كانت مركزاً للديانات الكنعانية والحياة السياسية، ويُفهم من النصوص المصرية القديمة أن علاقة فلسطين أصبحت وطيدة بمصر ابتداءً من بداية هذا العصر. وتتحدث رسائل تل العمارنة (سنة 1400-1350 ق.م) عن مدينة شكيم، تحت حكم أميرها الكنعاني لابعايو كمدينة تلعب دوراً هاماً في النضال ضد السيطرة المصرية على منطقة فلسطين. وحسب ما ورد في التوراة فإنها أول مدينة كنعانية نزل فيها النبي إبراهيم الخليل قادماً من مدينة أور في العراق، وكان ذلك حوالي عام 1805 ق.م  وبعده أتى النبي يعقوب من فدان آرام على نهر الفرات في العراق، ونزل شكيم، ثم سكن مدينة كنعانية تعرف باسم بيت إيل وتعني مقر الإله، وكانت مركز عبادة الإله الكنعاني إل أو إيل. ويذكر أن يعقوب عاد فيما بعد إلى شكيم.\nوفي العصر الحديدي (1200-323 قبل الميلاد) استمرت المدن الكنعانية بنفس نظام المدن المحصنة ذات القلاع خلال فترات العصر البرونزي. وتشير التوراة إلى وجود حروب بين اليهود والكنعانيين الفلسطينيين. وقد سيطر اليهود على مدينتين كنعانيتين:\n\nالأولى: مدينة يبوس (أورشاليم)، مدينة اليبوسيين الكنعانيين وقلب مملكتهم منذ عصور ما قبل التاريخ، احتلها اليهود سنة 1000 ق.م بقيادة النبي داود (100-963 ق.م)، ثم سليمان سنة 963 ق.م –923 ق.م. واستمر اليهود فيها تحت اسم مملكة يهودا حتى سقطت سنة 586 ق.م على يد نبوخذ نصر.\nالثانية: مدينة شكيم، التي بدأ نفوذهم فيها عام 923 ق.م وانتهى عام 722 ق.م على يد سرجون الثاني، وبقى فيها أهلها الكنعانيون، وتشير بعض المراجع إلى إحضار كنعانيين من الدواخل، وهم العموريون.\n\nسكنت مدينة شكيم فئة من بني إسرائيل لا تعترف من التوراة بغير الأسفار الخمسة الأولى المنسوبة إلى النبي موسى، وتعرف هذه الفئة بالسامريين نسبة إلى السامرة. وقد ناصبهم اليهود العداء منذ ظهورهم. ويعتقد السامريون بأن النبي إبراهيم همّ بالتضحية بإبنه إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. لا يزال معظم السامريين موجودين في مدينة نابلس حتى هذا اليوم ولا يتجاوز عددهم 250 نسمة، وقد خصص لهم مقعد في المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني المنتخب لأول مرة في التاريخ الفلسطيني المعاصر عام 1996.\nسقطت فلسطين سنة 332 ق.م في يد الإسكندر المقدوني وأصبحت تابعة للإمبراطورية اليونانية حتى سنة 64 ق.م، وبعد وفاة الإسكندر خضعت للبطالمة والسـلوقيين. وقد تركت الهيلينية بصماتها واضحة على بعض مظاهر الحياة أيام الحكم اليوناني وذلك بسبب إنشاء سبعين مدينة ضخمة على الطراز الإغريقي في البلاد التي احتلها الجيش اليوناني. وقد اُستخدِمت مراكزَ ثقافية نُشِرت بها الثقافة اليونانية في بلدان العالم القديم. ومن المدن الثقافية التي أنشئت في العهد اليوناني بيلاوريون (تل الأشعري)، هيبوس (قلعة الحصن)، وهما تقعان شرق طبريا، ومدينة (فيلوتير) في الطرف الجنوبي من بحيرة طبريا، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى فيلوتير شقيقة بطليموس الثاني فيلادلفوس، ومدينة جيراز (جرش). حول الإغريق الكثير من أسماء المدن الكنعانية الفلسطينية إلى أسماء إغريقية منها عكا، حيث سميت بتولما في عهد بطليموس الثاني، وبيت شان (بيسان) سميت سكيثوبوليس، وبيت جبرين أطلق عليها اليوثيروبوليس، وإيلات سميت بيرينكة، وشكيم سميت نيابوليس. أصبحت المدينة تشتمل على رقعة واسعة من الأراضي تحيط بها الأسوار، وبها بوابات ضخمة ذات جلال، وفي داخل الأسوار يقع القصر الملكي أو قصر الحاكم، وكذلك الساحة العامة والمدرج الضخم والمسرح وبرك السباحة والمعابد الضخمة المتعددة.\nوفي العصر الروماني (64 ق.م – 323 م) أقيم سور حول مدينة شكيم (السامرة) طوله حوالي 170 أكد. أما بوابة المدينة فقد بنيت في الجهة الغربية من المدينة وتضم برجين دائريين عظيمين بقطر 46 قدماً (14 متراً)، وهي مقامة على قواعد مربعة الشكل تعود للعصر الهيليني. ومبنى الباسيليكا في السامرة يعود تاريخه إلى العصر الروماني.\n\nوفي الفترة الممتدة بين عاميّ 67 و69 للميلاد، قرر الرومان، تحت قيادة الإمبراطور فسبازيان، هدمها للمرة الأخيرة وبناء مدينة جديدة إلى الغرب منها أسموها «نيابوليس» أي المدينة الجديدة والتي حرفت عنها لفظة نابلس الحالية، وقد أقاموها وفق التخطيط الروماني في بناء المدن من حيث وجود شارعين متقاطعين ينتج عنهما أربع حارات، حيث ما زالت بعض هذه الحارات الرومانية قائمة بتسميتها الرومانية إلى اليوم مثل حارة القيسارية. وفي عهد هادريان (117-138) أقام الرومان معبداً لجوبيتر على جبل جرزيم مكان معبد السامريين.\nوفي العصر البيزنطي (323 - 638) انتصرت المسيحية فأصبحت كل فلسطين وبضمنها نابلس تدين بالمسيحية وأصبحت نابلس مركزاً لأسقفية. وفي القرن الخامس الميلادي بنى الرومان المسيحيون على قمة جبل جرزيم كنيسة تخليداً لمريم العذراء. وفي عهد الإمبراطور جستنيان (527-565) شيدت بالقرب من كنيسة مريم قلعة مسورة لا تزال آثارها باقية، كما أعاد الرومان بناء خمس كنائس تهدمت في حروب سابقة.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nفي عام 638م فتح العرب المسلمون نابلس بقيادة عمرو بن العاص في خلافة عمر بن الخطاب، وقد تعهد المسلمون بحماية من بقي من أهلها على دينه من المسيحيين على أن يدفعوا الجزية عن رقابهم والخراج عن أراضيهم. أصبحت نابلس بعد الفتح الإسلامي مدينة من مدن جند فلسطين الذي كانت قصبته اللد ثم الرملة.\nاستولى عليها الصليبيون في سنة 1099م بقيادة تانكرد صاحب أنطاكية، وبنى بالدوين الأول (1100-1118م) ملك بيت المقدس الفرنجي فيها قلعة على رأس جبل جرزيم لحماية قواته ومراقبة تحركات المسلمين. وعقد فيها خلال الاحتلال الصليبي مجمع كنسي كبير في سنة 1120م تحت رعاية بالدوين الثاني (1118-1130م). غير الصليبيون اسمها إلى (باللاتينية: Naples).\nعادت نابلس بقراها وجبالها إلى المسلمين سنة 1187م بعد انتصار صلاح الدين الأيوبي في معركة حطين. أزال صلاح الدين ما أحدثه الصليبيون من تغييرات فيها أثناء الاحتلال. بدأت المدينة في العودة إلى ازدهارها خاصة في زمن المماليك الذين خلفوا الأيوبيين.\nضرب نابلس زلزال كبير سنة 1189 م، فتهدمت فيها مبان كثيرة، ومات تحت الأنقاض ثلاثون ألفاً من أهلها.\nكانت نابلس مركز تجمع جيش المسلمين بقيادة الملك الكامل خلال الحملة الصليبية السادسة على الشام التي انطلقت في عام 1228م بقيادة فردريك الثاني إمبراطور ألمانيا وإيطاليا.\nسقطت نابلس بيد التتار سنة 1260م، ولكنهم خرجوا في نفس السنة على يد قطز المملوكي.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nفي سنة 1517 م سيطر العثمانيون على بلاد الشام وبضمنها نابلس، وأصبحت نابلس سنجقاً تابعاً لولاية دمشق، ووصلت المدينة أوج ازدهارها في عهدهم.\n\nكانت نابلس خلال القرنين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر أهم مدينة تجارية في فلسطين، متفوقة على القدس وعلى المدن الساحلية، ومن المحتمل أنها كانت الأكبر سكانيا في فلسطين في هذا الوقت. حوالي عام 1849، وصل عدد سكانها إلى عشرين ألفًا على الأقل، ما جعلها الأكبر سكانيًا في فلسطين. كانت أيضاً أكبر مركز لإنتاج القطن في الشام بكمية بلغت 225,000 كغم عام 1837. كانت المدينة مركزا لتجارة الأقمشة وكانت تصدر الصابون وزيت الزيتون والقطن إلى دمشق وبيروت ومصر وأوروبا.</\"ref name=\"BD> نتيجة لدورها التجاري المهم، تعرضت نابلس بدءاً من عام 1773 إلى حصار عسكري واقتصادي تبعه احتلال قام به ظاهر العمر وخلفه أحمد باشا الجزار لإضعاف دورها وتقوية دور عكا، ودام هذا الاحتلال حتى عام 1804. بعد دمار عكا الذي نتج عن هجوم إبراهيم باشا عام 1931-1932، عادة أهمية للازدياد مجددا. في سنة 1832 دخلت نابلس تحت الحكم المصري بقيادة القائد إبراهيم باشا، وفي عام 1834 ثار أهل نابلس على الحكم المصري بسبب الضرائب والتجنيد الإجباري ولكنهم أخفقوا. دام هذا الحكم حتى سنة 1840 حيث عادت فلسطين إلى الحكم العثماني. وفي نهاية الحكم العثماني أصبحت مدينة نابلس مركز سنجق تابع لولاية بيروت يمتد من نهر الأردن إلى البحر المتوسط ويضم مئة قرية. ضرب زلزال كبير ثان نابلس في عام 1837 وأدى إلى تدمير حي كامل وإحداث أضرار كبيرة بحي آخر.\nمع نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، بدأ دور نابلس بالتراجع مع زيادة أهمية مدن أخرى مثل القدس التي اجتذبت مهاجرين يهود وحجاج مسيحيين، ويافا التي بدأت بالازدهار نتيجة زيادة تجارتها عبر الميناء.</\"ref name=\"BD> استمر التراجع في القرنين اللاحقين بفعل الاحتلال الأجنبي وانتقال مراكز الإدارة والتجارة إلى مدن أخرى. سقطت نابلس بيد البريطانيين في يوم 21 أيلول 1918 بعد معركة شهدت مقاومة شديدة من الجنود العثمانيين. أخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني عام 1922 وأصبحت نابلس مجدداً مركزاً للمقاومة. فجر البريطانيون أجزاءً كبيرةً من حارة القريون خلال ثورة 1936-1939 لقمع المقاومة.\n\nضرب زلزال قوي نابلس يوم 11 تموز من عام 1927  وأدى إلى تدمير 300 بيت ومبنى في مدينتها القديمة وبضمنها جامع النصر التاريخي  ويمكن رؤية آثاره على كثير من المباني حتى اليوم. أظهر تعداد عام 1941 أن نابلس جاءت في المرتبة السادسة في تعداد السكان في فلسطين بعد القدس وتل أبيب وحيفا ويافا وغزة على الترتيب، وكانت تضم محكمتين عدليتين على الأقل.\n\nبعد نكبة فلسطين\nبعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948 ضمت الضفة الغربية بمحافظاتها الثلاث، نابلس والقدس والخليل، إلى الأردن وأصبحت في سنة 1950 جزءاً من المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى احتلالها من قبل الإسرائيليين خلال حرب حزيران عام 1967م. منذ سقوطها حتى اليوم، شكلت نابلس إحدى أهم بؤر المقاومة وسقط منها شهداء كثر من أقدمهم وأبرزهم شادية أبو غزالة عام 1968 والفتاة لينا النابلسي عام 1976. بعد إتفاق أوسلو، انسحبت قوات الاحتلال منها في 10 كانون الأول سنة 1995م، قبل أربعة أيام من الموعد المتفق عليه مع السلطة الفلسطينية، وكانت الوحيدة من بين المدن الفلسطينية التي أخليت قبل موعدها.\n\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية\nفي ظل السلطة الفلسطينية، استمر دور المدينة بالتراجع بسبب الحصار الإسرائيلي والعمليات العسكرية في مقابل الهدوء النسبي في مناطق أخرى (أهمها رام الله) وتركيز السلطة الفلسطينية على بناء عاصمتها الجديدة في رام الله، فانتقلت كثير من المؤسسات وإدارات المصارف والشركات والمراكز الثقافية ومراكز البحوث إلى رام الله. نتيجة لذلك، ارتفعت نسبة البطالة في نابلس وتراجعت تجارتها. كانت الإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الأردنية العاملة في الضفة الغربية أول من انتقلت من المدينة. بعد ذلك، بدأت المؤسسات الثقافية ودور الأبحاث بالانتقال للاقتراب من مراكز صنع القرار في رام الله. على سبيل المثال، انتقل المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث السياسية والمسحية (وهو من أوائل مراكز البحوث واستطلاع الرأي في فلسطين) من نابلس إلى رام الله (وكان اسمه عند التأسيس مركز البحوث والدراسات الفلسطينية). أيضا، قبل إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله، كانت هناك ثلاثة مراكز ثقافية فرنسية (تتبع للقنصلية الفرنسية في القدس) في الأراضي الفلسطينية (في القدس وغزة ونابلس)، وبعد إقامة السلطة الفلسطينية في رام الله أقيم فرع رابع هناك تبعه إغلاق فرع المركز في نابلس.\n\nنابلس في أدب الرحلات\nذكر رحالة كثر نابلس في أعمالهم. من هؤلاء المقدسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي الذي وصفها في كتابه «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم» حيث قال: \n\nفي سنة 1325م زارها ابن بطوطة فوصفها بأنها مدينة عظيمة كثيرة الأشجار والماء ومن أكثر بلاد الشام زيتوناً، وبها مسجد جامع متقن وحسن في وسطه بركة ماء عذب.\nفي القرن التاسع الهجري، أفاض مجير الدين الحنبلي العليمي في ذكر نابلس ونواحيها فقال فيما قال: \n\nفي سنة 1671م زارها الرحالة العثماني أولياجلبي، حيث ذكر أنها مركز لواء تابع لولاية دمشق ويضم مائتي قرية. وذكر مساجدها وسوقها ومدارسها وحماماتها قائلاً: \n\n وأغلب الظن أنه قصد وجود الليمون والنخيل في غور نابلس وليس في جبالها.\n\nالاقتصاد والخدمات\nنابلس عاصمة فلسطين الاقتصادية، وتعتبر المركز التجاري والصناعي الرئيس في فلسطين قبل النكبة  وفي الضفة الغربية بعد ذلك. إضافةً إلى ذلك، وهبها موقعها الجغرافي المميز وأمطارها الغزيرة (التي تعتبر الأغزر في فلسطين) أهمية كمركز لإنتاج وتبادل المنتجات الزراعية. كما تشتهر المدينة بصناعة الصابون والمصنوعات اليدوية والأثاث والبلاط وتشتهر بجودة حجارتها ومهارة حجّاريها ومصانع النسيج ودباغة الجلود. كما توجد على تخوم نابلس سوق لتبادل البضائع الحيّة كالمواشي وسوق الخضار المركزية للضفة الغربية. تضم نابلس الإدارات العامة لكبريات الشركات الفلسطينية مثل شركة الإتصالات الفلسطينية وشركة فلسطين للتنمية والاستثمار (PADICO)، وفيها مقر بورصة نابلس المعروفة رسمياً بسوق فلسطين للأوراق المالية. كانت نابلس مركزاً للإدارات الإقليمية للمصارف الفلسطينية والعربية الموجودة في الضفة الغربية قبل أن يتم نقل معظمها إلى رام الله مع تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية هناك. تشتهر نابلس كذلك بعمارة أسواقها، وخاصة في حي القصبة في المدينة القديمة، كما تشتهر بحلوياتها وخاصة «الكنافة» التي تنسب أجودها للمدينة.\n\nالصناعة\nكانت المدينة تشكل ثقلاً اقتصادياً هاماً قبل 1967م وكانت مدن الضفتين تعتمد عليها في بعض الصناعات وبعد الاحتلال ونتيجة لسياسة سلطات الاحتلال الإلحقاية التي تقوم على تدمير الاقتصاد الوطني تعرضت الصناعات الكبيرة فيها إلى التراجع وهبوط مستوى إنتاجها وأهم هذه الصناعات مصانع الجلود والنسيج والكيمياويات والصناعات المعدنية، وفي المدينة غرفة تجارة أسست عام 1943م.\nتشتهر المدينة بالكثير من المنتجات الزراعية والمصنعة أهمها:\n\nالصابون النابلسي: ازدهرت صناعة الصابون في نابلس واشتهر صابونها الذي يصنع من زيت الزيتون حتى أصبحت مصابنها جزءاً من تراث المدينة. كانت صناعة الصابون أحد أعمدة الاقتصاد النابلسي ووصل عدد المصابن إلى أكثر من ثلاثين مصبنة، توقف معظمها عن العمل بفعل إغلاق الأسواق الخارجية وغياب الابتكار والتجديد.\nالحلويات النابلسية: أهم حلوياتها على الإطلاق الكنافة النابلسية الشهيرة في كل أنحاء المشرق العربي وتركيا. دخلت نابلس موسوعة غينيس للأرقام القياسية بأكبر طبق (صدر) كنافة في 18 تموز 2009. تشتهر نابلس أيضاً بالمدلوقة والحلاوة المصنوعة من السمسم والكلاج والقطايف والفطير وحلاوة الزلابية إضافة إلى الحلويات الشامية مثل البقلاوة.\nمن المُنتجات الأخرى التي تمتاز بها نابلس عن غيرها الجبن النابلسي والطحينة والحلاوة والقزحة، والأخيرة عبارة عن مائع أسود اللون يستخلص من حبة البركة، يؤكل غمساً وله استعمالات طبية مهمة.\n\nالزراعة في محافظة نابلس\nتساهم الزراعة بنسبة قليلة من الدخل، ويتركز الإنتاج الزراعي على سفوح الجبال وفي الأغوار وتعتمد على مياه الأمطار والري في الأغوار. فيها العديد من المزارع لتنمية الثروة الحيوانية.\nتعد نابلس مركز زراعة الزيتون في فلسطين، ولهذا ازدهرت فيها صناعة الصابون النابلسي المطبوخ من زيت الزيتون. إضافة إلى الزيتون، تحيط بنابلس بساتين الرمان واللوز والخوخ والمشمش والدراق. تزرع الخضراوات والحمضيات المروية في الغور حيث تقل أخطار الصقيع. كانت منطقة نابلس تشتهر أيضاً بزراعة القطن، إلا أن هذا المحصول اختفى تقريباً الآن من منطقة نابلس، ولكنه لا زال يزرع في السهل الساحلي.\nتشتهر المدينة أيضاً بمنتجات زراعية خاصة مثل الزعتر النابلسي وتعرف بمنتجاتها الجبلية مثل البابونج والميرمية. صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات واسعة من أراضي المحافظة وأقامت عليها 43 مستوطنة مما أدى إلى انحسار مساحة المراعي الطبيعية.\n\nالخدمات الصحية\nفيها مشفيان حكوميان أولهما المستشفى الوطني الذي يٌقدم خدمات في تخصص علم الأورام. بني هذا المستشفى عام 1910 ويقع في وسط المدينة. ثاني المستشفيات الحكومية مستشفى رفيديا الجراحي الذي يقع في غرب المدينة ويُعد أكبر مستشفى في المدينة. يوجد أيضاً مشفيان خاصان غير ربحيين هما المستشفى الإنجيلي العربي وهو الأقدم في المدينة حيث أنشيء عام 1900 ومستشفى جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي.. من المشافي الخاصة الربحية المستشفى العربي التخصصي ومستشفى نابلس التخصصي الذي أسس عام 2001، ويقدم خدمات اختصاصية في جراحة القلب المفتوح وقثطرة شريانية ورأب الوعاء. بعد إنشاء كلية الطب في جامعة النجاح أنشيء مستشفى النجاح الوطني الجامعي وهو أول مستشفى جامعي في فلسطين.\nإضافة إلى ما تقدم، هناك مستوصفات خيرية تقدم خدمات الطوارئ والإسعافات الأولية مثل مستوصف الرحمة ومستوصف التضامن التابع لجمعية التضامن الخيرية ومركز الرازي الطبي ومركز الأمل للتأهيل. هناك أيضاً العديد من العيادات الطبية الحكومية أو التابعة لوكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين أو الأونروا، وخاصة في مخيمات اللاجئين. في عام 2010، بلغ معدل السكان لكل مركز رعاية صحية 5,486 مواطن وهو الرقم الأصغر مُقارنة مع باقي المدن الفلسطينية. ويتمتع المواطن النابلسي بخاصية التأمين الصحي الذي يتم تأمينه من جهة الحكومة (نظام التأمين الصحي الحكومي) والتأمين الصحي الخاص والمنظمات الغير حكومية والأونروا أيضًا ويصل عدد العائلات التي تستفيد من هذا التأمين 19,051 عائلة.\n\nالخدمات البلدية\nفي عام 1997، تم ربط 18,003 منزل بالشبكة العامة للكهرباء أي ما يعادل 99,7% من المدينة. قبل بناء هذه الشبكة عام 1957 كان التزود بالكهرباء يتم عن طريق بعض المولدات الخاصة. بالإضافة أن الشبكة تمد 18 بلدة وقرية بجوار المدينة بالكهرباء عن طريق نفس الشبكة.\nوترتبط 93% من منازل المدينة بنظام الصرف الصحي و7% عن طريق الحُفر الامتصاصية. وأُنشئ نظام الصرف الصحي في أوائل الخمسينات، بالإضافة إلى ارتباط مخيم بلاطة ومخيم عسكر ومخيم عين بيت الماء. وتوفر بلدية نابلس المياه الصحية عن طريق الأنابيب لجميع المنازل في المدينة. وقد قامت السلطات البريطانية بتأسيس شبكة المياه عام 1932، وتتزود بالمياه من الآبار الأربعة المجاورة للمدينة في: دير شرف، الفارعة، وادي الباذان و‌أودلا.\n\nإطفائية البلدية\nتم تأسيس إطفائية بلدية نابلس عام 1958. حيث تألفت أول فرقة إطفاء من خمسة أفراد مع سيارة إطفاء واحدة، حتى عام 1986 كانت مسؤولة عن منطقة شمال الضفة الغربية كاملةً. ولكن اليوم تقتصر خدماتها فقط في نابلس. في عام 2007، بلغ عدد السيارات المُستعملة لإطفاء الحرائق 20 سيارة و70 فرد. خلال الفترة الواقعة ما بين 1997 و2006، قامت بإطفاء 15,346 حريق.\n\nالطرق والمواصلات\nينقسم نظام الطرق والمواصلات في نابلس كما هو الحال في باقي مناطق الضفة الغربية إلى قسمين رئيسيين، واحد لاستخدام المواطنين الفلسطينيين والآخر لاستخدام المستوطنين الإسرائيليين. تصل مساحة الطرق الرئيسية التي تربط مدينة نابلس بالقرى المُحيطة بها إلى 365.8 كم 2، بينما تصل مساحة الطرق الفرعية التي تربطها بالقرى إلى 313.2 كم 2. ومنذ توقيع اتفاقية أوسلو بين السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية والجانب الإسرائيلي في أيلول سبتمبر عام 1995 عملت إسرائيل على إنشاء نظام طرق خاص يربط مستوطنات الضفة الغربية ببعضها البعض، ويضمن مرورا آمنا لمستوطني الضفة الغربية. وقد أدى نظام الطرق هذا إلى تقسيم الأراضي الزراعية في الضفة الغربية وبعثرتها. وقد وصل طول هذه الطرق إلى 39,699 كم مربع حتى نهاية شهر مارس من العام 1996.\nتعد المركبات في نابلس أهم وسائل النقل، بل تكاد تكون الوحيدة التي يعتمد عليها سكان نابلس للتنقل برًا من وإلى المناطق المختلفة داخل الوطن والمدن المجاورة. حيث تبلغ عدد السيارات 20.397 منها 15.507 سيارة خاصة و1.490 سيارة أجرة و121 حافلة عمومية. ويعتبر متوسط سنة إنتاج السيارة منخفضًا في المدينة حيث يبلغ عدد السيارات التي تم تصنيعها (قبل عام 1997) 9.540 سيارة أي ما يقارب نصفها.\n\nالحياة الثقافية والتراث\nتعتبر نابلس من أغنى المدن الفلسطينية ثقافياً وتراثياً. من الألقاب التي عرفت بها نابلس «عش العلماء» ويعود سبب التسمية إلى كون نابلس مركزاً علمياً وأدبياً ونظراً لظهور الكثير من العلماء والأدباء والشعراء منها على مدى كثير من العصور.\n\nشعراؤها وأدباؤها\nبرز منها الكثير من أعلام الفكر والشعر والأدب. من أشهر شعرائها إبراهيم طوقان شاعر فلسطين وشقيقته فدوى طوقان وحلمي الزواتي وعبد اللطيف عقل وليلى علوش وعلي الخليلي ومحمد مهيب جبر ومن أدبائها في القرن العشرين عادل زعيتر وقدري طوقان ومحمد عزة دروزة وثريا ملحس وأكرم زعيتر.\n\nمؤسسات التعليم العالي والمراكز الثقافية\nتحتضن نابلس جامعة النجاح الوطنية الأكبر في الضفة الغربية والتي تضم عشرين كلية. توجد في المدينة أيضاً كلية الروضة للعلوم المهنية إضافةً إلى مراكز ثقافية مثل المنتدى التنويري الثقافي الفلسطيني والنادي الثقافي الاجتماعي ومركز حواء الثقافي وملتقى بلاطة الثقافي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي وفرع للمجلس الثقافي البريطاني. كان في المدينة ثلاث دور سينما أغلقت خلال الانتفاضات المتعاقبة منذ 1989، وقد افتتحت عام 2009 دار جديدة للسينما، أغلقت أبوابها عام 2019. وتعد مكتبة بلدية نابلس العامة أقدم وأكبر المكتبات في الضفة الغربية حيث أنشئت عام 1960.\nوفقًا ل الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني، في عام 1997، بلغ عدد الطلاب 44,926 (41.2٪ في المدارس الابتدائية، 36.2٪ في المدرسة الثانوية، و22.6٪ في المدرسة الثانوية). في عام 2006، بلغ عدد المدارس 234 مدرسة و93,925 طالبًا وطالبة في محافظة نابلس؛ منها 196 تابعة لمديرية التربية والتعليم الفلسطينية و24 مدرسة خاصة و14 مدرسة تابعة ل الأونروا.\n\nالحركة النسوية\nفي عام 1921، تأسست في نابلس جمعية الاتحاد النسائي العربي التي كانت أول جمعية نسائية غير دينية في فلسطين (سبقتها ثلاث جمعيات أرثوذكسية في عكا ويافا والقدس)، وهي لا تزال نشطة حتى الآن وأسست الكثير من المراكز والنشاطات منها مشفى ومعهد تمريض ومراكز تعليم مهني وناد ثقافي وروضة أطفال.\n\nالمتاحف\nأنشئ في نابلس متحف القصبة في موقع غني بالآثار الرومانية داخل المدينة القديمة. هناك أيضاً متحف سامري أقيم على قمة جبل جرزيم عام 1997 لإلقاء الضوء على ديانة وتراث السامريين.\n\nالإنتاج التلفزيوني ومحطات البث التلفزيوني\nتم في نابلس عام 2005 إنتاج مسلسل تلفزيوني يعالج الكثير من القضايا الاجتماعية وكان اسم المسلسل «براويز» من إنتاج تلفزيون آسيا ـ نابلس، كذلك أنتج مسلسل تلفزيوني اجتماعي آخر عام 2008 حمل عنوان «لهون حلو». فيها سبع محطات تلفزة محلية أهمها وأولها تلفزيون نابلس وخمس محطات إذاعة محلية تبث على موجات إف إم، وهي تؤثر بشكل فاعل بطرح قضايا تخص المدينة وسكانها، من أبرز هذه الإذاعات راديو شباب أف ام، راديو طريق المحبة، إذاعة جامعة النجاح الوطنية وإذاعة القرآن الكريم.\n\nالزي الشعبي\nيشبه الزي النسائي القديم المعروف لمدينة نابلس إلى حد كبير الزي النسائي لمدينة دمشق، والذي يتكون من يشمك وغطوة وكاب أو ملاية. والحال كذلك بالنسبة للزي الرجالي الذي كان يتكون من الشروال والطربوش.\n\nالفن التشكيلي\nأقيمت في مدينة نابلس أضخم جدارية في فلسطين بمساحة 550 متر مربع عند مفترق جامع السلام غرب المدينة. كما أقيم في مدينة نابلس حديثا غالري فني يهتم بالفن التشكيلي بكافة أنواعه وهو غالري تهامة.\n\nالرياضة\nتوجد في المدينة العديد من الأندية الرياضية أهمها نادي حطين ونادي اتحاد نابلس ونادي عيبال وشباب نابلس، إضافة إلى أندية صغيرة مثل نادي أهلي بلاطة ونادي التضامن ونادي جبل النار ونادي إسكان الموظفين. إضافةً إلى ذلك، يوجد مركز للشباب في كل مخيم للاجئين (كبلاطة وعسكر وعين بيت الماء). فيها ملعب بلدي لكرة القدم هو الأقدم في فلسطين حيث أسس عام 1950. جرت توسعته وإعادة تأهيله ليتسع ل4,000 من المتفرجين.\n\nالحديقة النباتية\nأقيمت أول حديقة نباتية تعليمية وبحثية في فلسطين في قرية تل الواقعة في ضواحي نابلس. أشرف على هذا المشروع ونفذه مركز أبحاث التنوع الحيوي والبيئة «بيرك» ويقع مقره في ذات القرية. تحتوي الحديقة على أشجار الحور، عروس الغابة، الخروب، البطم، الجكرندا، الطلح الناعم، السنديان، العبهر، الصنوبر، الكينا، التين، الزيزفون السوري، الورود، بالإضافة إلى حديقة مائية وحديقة صخرية.\n\nأهميتها الدينية\nأخرج ابن أبي شيبة عن كعب الأحبار قال: \n\n هي من أهم المدن قداسة وخاصة عند اليهود والنصارى. يقال أن النبي آدم سجد فيها على جبل جرزيم. هي الموقع الكنعاني الأول الذي ذكرته التوراة وفيه بنى إبراهيم أول هيكل لدى قدومه من حلب. إضافة إلى إبراهيم، سكنها أنبياء أهمهم إسحاق ويعقوب. ويعتقد اليهود أن إبراهيم همّ بذبح إسحاق على جبل جرزيم. مر بها المسيح حيث سقته المرأة السامرية من بئر يعقوب. يوجد فيها أيضاً قبر يوسف وبظاهرها قبور أنبياء آخرين.\nهناك 17 معلما إسلاميّا في المدينة، و11 مسجدًا في المدينة القديمة. تمّ إنشاء 9 مساجد من هذه المذكورة قبل القرن الخامس عشر. تحوي نابلس، بالإضافة لدور العبادة الإسلامية، كنيسة للروم الأرثوذكس مكرسة للقديس جوستين الشهيد، المبنية عام 1898، وكنيسًا للسامريين، لا يزال يُستعمل من قبل تابعي هذه الديانة.\n\nالمساجد\nنابلس مدينة المساجد، فمنذ أن دخلها الإسلام وهي جادة في بناء المساجد التي بنى معظمها الموسرون من أهلها حيث تفيد إحصائية من عام 1997م بأن عدد المساجد في مدينة نابلس وحدها دون قراها بلغ 49 مسجدًا  منها ما هو قديم جداً مثل جامع الخضراء، الذي يمتد عمره إلى بداية العهد الإسلامي،جامع التينة، جامع البيك، الجامع الصلاحي الكبير الذي كان كاتدرائية، جامع الساطون، جامع النصر، المسجد العمري، جامع المساكين، المسجد الحنبلي، جامع الأنبياء، جامع الخضر، مسجد العامود. وهناك عدد كبير من المساجد الحديثة.\nتوجد في نابلس لجنة زكاة تعتبر الأكبر في الضفة الغربية حيث تقوم على إعالة آلاف الأسر والأيتام وطلاب العلم في نابلس وقراها وتشرف على عدة مشاريع استثمارية ضخمة متعددة الأغراض.\n\nالكنائس والأديرة\nتمتاز نابلس بتسامحها الديني، وهذا يفسر كثرة الكنائس وتنوعها وكذلك الأديرة المسيحية فيها. ومن أشهر الكنائس وأقدمها في نابلس كنيسة الأرثوذكس في المدينة القديمة، والكنيسة الأرثوذكسية المُقامة فوق بئر يعقوب. ومن أشهر أديرتها دير فنشر قرب جامع الخضر، ودير اللاتين قرب المقبرة الغربية. وهناك موقع شرقي المدينة يسمى خلة الرهبان.\n\nآثار ومعالم\nلا تزال مجموعة من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية الجميلة الممثلة لمختلف الفترات التاريخية السابقة التي مرت على نابلس قائمة حتى اليوم داخل المدينة، فبالإضافة إلى مدينة شكيم، لا يزال هناك ثلاثة عشر أثراً رومانياً من أبرزها المسرح والمدرج وميدان سباق الخيل، كما أن هناك خمسة وستين أثراً لمعالم التراث الحضاري الإسلامي موزعة على المساجد، المقامات، الزوايا، الخانات، القصور، الأسبلة، المدارس وغير ذلك. ومما يؤسف له أن هذه الآثار قد تعرضت للتدمير والهدم والتخريب الوحشي على يد الإسرائيليين أثناء هجومهم على البلدة القديمة في نابلس عام 2002.\n\nبوابات نابلس\nيروي مؤرخو المدينة أن نابلس كان لها ثماني عشرة بوابة، زال معظمها جراء التوسع العمراني الذي شهدته ابتداءً من القرن التاسع عشر. ومنها: البوابة الشرقية، البوابة الغربية، بوابة الدير، بوابة الشيخ مسلم، بوابة إدريس، بوابة سوق الحدادين، بوابة البيك وسط المدينة القديمة، بوابة الوكالة.\n\nالمعالم من العهدين الكنعاني والروماني\nتظهر الآثار الرومانية على أطراف المدينة القديمة، وبعض المعالم في البلدة القديمة ترجع إلى العهد البيزنطي والصليبي. من الآثار الكنعانية والرومانية المهمة في نابلس:\n\nسبسطية: مدينة أثرية فيها مدارج رومانية وشارع أعمدة. تقع على بعد كيلومترات قليلة شمال غرب نابلس.\nشكيم: مدينة كنعانية قديمة. بعض جدرانها لا تزال قائمةً إلى اليوم في الطرف الشرقي من مدينة نابلس.\nمعبد جوبيتر أو زيوس: ويقع في تل الرأس في جبل جرزيم (الطور). أُسس كمعبد للآلهة زيوس في القرن الثاني للميلاد وقد تم اكتشافه عام 1930.\nمدرج سباق الخيل في ساحة الشهداء (ميدان الحسين سابقاً) وسط مدينة نابلس.\nالمدرج الروماني في رأس العين: ويتسع لأكثر من ألف شخص، وهو أكبر المسارح المكتشفة في فلسطين.\nالشارع الروماني: اكتشفت أجزاء منه تحت مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية.\nمقبرة عسكر البيزنطية.\nالمقبرة الرومانية الغربية: وتقع على أطراف المدينة على الطريق المتجه غربًا نحو الساحل الفلسطيني.\nبئر يعقوب: وهو البئر الذي شرب منه يسوع على يد المرأة السامرية بحسب التقاليد المسيحية، وأقيم فوقه دير أرثوذكسي، ولا يزال عامراً بالمياه الصالحة للشرب.\nقبر يوسف: هو مقام يعتقد أن القبر الموجود فيه يحتوي رفات النبي يوسف بن يعقوب التي حملت من مصر حسب التوراة،  ولذلك استولى عليه اليهود عام 1967 وجعلوه مقاماً مقدساً لديهم ونقطةً عسكرية قبل أن يطردهم سكان نابلس بالقوة عام 2000.\n\nقناة جر المياه الرومانية: أقام الرومان هذه القناة في القرن الثاني الميلادي واكتشفت حديثاً على عمق 30 متراً تحت الأرض تحت أقسام من المدينة القديمة عند بناء مدرسة ظافر المصري في حارة القيسارية. يُعتقد أن هذه القناة تجر مياه الشرب من ينابيع جبل جرزيم ضمن شبكة من الخزانات والآبار،  ولا تزال المياه تتدفق في هذه القناة. تم ترميم جزء منها وفتحه للزوار من قبل بلدية المدينة قبل عدة سنوات.\nأربع كنائس بيزنطية حولت إلى مساجد.\nآثار جبل جرزيم. يوجد على قمة الجبل معبد يوناني وكنيسة بيزنطية مثمنة الأضلاع وقلعة صليبية ومقام إسلامي إضافة إلى خزانات مياه وأساسات أبنية.\nتلة صوفر.\n\nقبور الأنبياء في عورتا. فيها قبر النبي العزير في مغارة وكذلك قبر يوشع بن نون خادم النبي موسى ومفضل ابن عم النبي هارون.\n\nالمعالم من العهد الإسلامي\nتتمثل أهم الآثار الإسلامية في أحياء المدينة القديمة في نابلس، وهي الياسمينة، القريون، الحبلة، القيسارية، العقبة، الغرب، القصبة الذي يمثل شريان المدينة القديمة ومركزها التجاري.\nتحتوي نابلس على 2850 بناءً تاريخيًا من منازل وقصور عائلية، و18 معلماً إسلامياً و17 سبيلاً. يعود تاريخ إنشاء العديد من الأماكن التاريخية المهمة إلى العهد الإسلامي وبالأخص العثماني مثل:\n\nبرج الساعة في باب الساحة\nخان التجار القديم\nخان التجار الجديد\nخان الوكالة الغربية\nالمدرسة الرشادية أو المدرسة الفاطمية\nقصر النمر\nالمنارة\nمستشفى الوطني الحكومي\nالمستشفى الإنجيلي (المبنيان القديمان)\nسجن النساء التركي\nالسجن (القشلة)\nسرايا الحكم التركي\nدار المفتي\nالوكالة الفروخية\nمحطة ضخ مياه القريون\nالبرج الصليبي\nجسر القطار قرب حدائق جمال عبد الناصر ومحطة القطار\nالمدرسة الهاشمية (هدمت)\nالمحكمة الشرعية.\nإضافة إلى ذلك، تضم المدينة العديد من الآثار والمعالم القديمة، منها تسعة مساجد أثرية، أربع منها كانت كنائس بيزنطية بالأصل وحولت إلى مساجد، وخمسة مساجد بنيت في بداية العهد الإسلامي، وضريح يعود إلى الفترة الأيوبية، وكنيسة من القرن السابع عشر وعشرات المصابن.\nيقع مقام رجال العامود على سفح جبل جرزيم الشمالي، ويعود تاريخه إلى عام 1396، ويتكون من سبع غرف متلاصقة يعتقد أنها كانت مسكن عامود النور وعائلته، ويوجد في الغرف الوسطى قبور يعتقد أن أصحاب المقام قد دفنوا فيها لاحقًا، وله فناء داخلي وسور، وفي جزئه الشمالي الغربي مسجد صغير تعلوه قبة حجرية.\n\nالحمامات التركية\nما زالت الحمامات التركية في نابلس شاهدةً على قدم هذه المدينة وعراقتها. كان عدد الحمامات التركية في نابلس أكبر من أية مدينة أخرى في فلسطين، حيث كانت تضم عشرة حمامات تركية  من أصل 38 في كل فلسطين. مع التطور العمراني ووصول المياه الجارية إلى البيوت، تضاءلت أهمية الحمامات العامة فهجر بعضها أو تضرر بسبب الإهمال بينما تحولت حمامات أخرى إلى مرافق مختلفة مثل حمام الخليلي، حمام الريشة، حمام الدرجة، حمام القاضي، حمام التميمي، وحمام النساء. تم خلال السنوات العشر الماضية تجديد بعض الحمامات التركية مثل حمام السمرة وحمام الشفاء. وإضافة إلى وظيفتها الأساسية، أصبحت هذه الحمامات تشكل ملتقيات للسكان من مختلف الأعمار حيث تشهد إقامة فعاليات ثقافية وتراثية.\n\nالتخريب الإسرائيلي للمعالم الأثرية في نابلس\nتعرضت المباني والمعالم التاريخية في نابلس لأضرار كبيرة من قبل الاحتلال الإسرائيلي، حيث دمر 149 معلماً من هذه المعالم بالكامل بينما تعرض 2000 معلم، أبرزها جامع الخضراء الذي يقدر عمره بـ 400 سنة، وخان الوكالة  لأضرار متنوعة أثناء عمليات الجيش الإسرائيلي في المدينة منذ بداية الانتفاضة الثانية عام 2000 وخاصة أثناء عمليتها الكبرى في نابلس في نيسان 2002. وأصاب الضرر قصورًا أثرية ومساجد ومصابن وأسواق.\n\nدور نابلس في النضال القومي العربي والوطني الفلسطيني\nكانت نابلس على الدوام مركزاً للنضال الوطني والقومي حيث لعبت دوراً كبيراً في مقاومة الغزاة. وحسب قسطنطين بازيلي فإن «جبليي نابلس هم أكثر القبائل السورية ضراوة ونزوعاً للقتال.»  لعب مثقفو نابلس وأعيانها أدورا كبيرة في الكفاح القومي. على سبيل المثال، كان عدد الإجمال للأعضاء في المنظمات والأندية القومية التي شكلت حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى 126 عضوا (مثلوا سورية والعراق)، كان منهم ثلاثة عشر عضوا من نابلس ومنطقتها، وهو أعلى تمثيل من فلسطين متبوعا بالقدس التي مثلها تسعة أعضاء. كان معظم هؤلاء ناشطين في جمعية العربية الفتاة وعلى رأسهم عوني عبد الهادي ومحمد عزة دروزة. شارك مندوبون عن نابلس في المؤتمر السوري العام الذي عقد في دمشق عام 1920 وألقى محمد عزة دروزة مقررات المؤتمر التي أعلنت استقلال سورية بحدودها الطبيعية ونادت بفيصل بن الحسين ملكا عليها.\nمن أهم الأحداث التي شهدتها نابلس المؤتمر الفلسطيني الخامس من 20 إلى 24 آب 1922 والذي أعلن الفلسطينيون خلاله رفض الانتداب وإصدار طوابع عليها شعارات فلسطينية ومقاطعة اليهود في البيع والشراء. لمتابعة المؤتمر عقد في نابلس مؤتمر آخر بتاريخ 18 أيلول 1931 سمي بمؤتمر التسليح، حيث طالب بالاستقلال والوحدة العربية ودعا إلى مقاطعة حكومة الانتداب وتسليح عرب فلسطين إن لم تستجب لذلك.\n\nنابلس في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية\nتعتبر مدينة نابلس أكثر المدن الفلسطينية تعرضًا للحصار والضربات العسكرية من قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي خلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية ابتداءً من العام 2000. أدى الحصار المستمر للمدينة وصعوبة تبادل البضائع إلى تدهور مكانة المدينة كمركز اقتصادي، وأدى إلى ارتفاع نسب البطالة كثيرًا، مما أدى إلى هجرة العديد من سكانها إلى الخارج أو إلى مدن أخرى خاصة رام الله. تصف إسرائيل المدينة بأنها «مصنع للإرهابيين»، وقامت قوات الجيش الإسرائيلي بعدة عمليات عسكرية واسعة النطاق في المدينة أو عمليات شملت عدة مناطق من ضمنها مدينة نابلس من أشهرها عملية الدرع الواقي عام 2002 وذلك نتيجة عدد الاستشهاديين الذين خرجوا منها. كانت نابلس الأكثر تضرراً من بين المحافظات الفلسطينية على صعيد الخسائر الاقتصادية حيث سجلت 2630 منشأة غير عاملة من بين العدد الكلي للمنشآت (17,167) أو ما نسبته 15% من المنشآت فيها وفق نتائج تعداد 2007،  وهذه أعلى نسبة سجلت في فلسطين.\n\nأعلام نابلس\nعلى الصعيد القومي\nخرج من نابلس شعراء وكتاب ورجال سياسة واقتصاد منهم من تبوأ مناصب رفيعة على مستوى فلسطين والأردن وسوريا والوطن العربي عمومًا. من أشهر هؤلاء في القرن العشرين:\n\nأحمد طوقان، رئيس وزراء سابق  للأردن.\nالشيخ عبد الحميد السائح، رئيس سابق للمجلس الوطني الفلسطيني، وأول من شغل منصب وزير الأوقاف والشؤون

      "summary": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.",

      "content": "Naplouse (en arabe : نابلس, Nablus ; en hébreu : שְׁכֶם, Chékhem ou Sichem) est une ville située en Palestine (Cisjordanie, en partie occupée par l'armée israélienne et par des colons juifs israéliens). Chef-lieu du gouvernorat de Naplouse, elle fait partie des territoires actuellement administrés par l'Autorité palestinienne.\nLa commune de Naplouse comptait une population d'environ 150 000 habitants en 2016.\nElle abrite des lieux saints de différentes religions, juifs, samaritains, musulmans et chrétiens.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nElle se trouve en Cisjordanie, à environ 65 kilomètres au nord de Jérusalem et environ 50 au nord de Ramallah, siège de l'Autorité nationale palestinienne.\n\nCommunes limitrophes\nNaplouse est globalement tributaire de la situation particulière de la Cisjordanie depuis les accords d'Oslo, divisée en trois zones d'autonomie plus ou moins forte : la zone A dont fait partie le territoire de Naplouse relève pour l'administration civile de l'Autorité palestinienne, établie à Ramallah, mais la route 60 toute proche et le mont Garizim font partie de la zone C, où l'autorité israélienne est totale.\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nLe centre de Naplouse est situé dans une vallée d'une altitude de 550 mètres, orientée nord-ouest/sud-est, entre le mont Ébal (940 m) au nord et le mont Garizim (881 m) au sud.\n\nVoies de communication\nÀ 3 km à l'ouest de Naplouse passe la route 60 qui relie Nazareth (Israël) au nord à Beer-Sheva (Israël) au sud en passant par Jénine (Cisjordanie), Jérusalem et Hébron (Cisjordanie). En Cisjordanie, la route 60 est sous la surveillance de l'armée israélienne, mais il y règne cependant une grande insécurité.\nDe cette route partent des routes vers Haïfa, Netanya et Tel Aviv-Jaffa, trois villes d'Israël situées sur le littoral.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nLa ville, fondée en 72 par les Romains, est nommée Flavia Neapolis (« Nouvelle cité flavienne »), en l'honneur de l'empereur Vespasien, de son nom romain Titus Flavius Vespasianus, qui règne de 70 à 79.\nCelui-ci la fait construire à la place d'un village samaritain appelé Mabartha, situé à environ deux kilomètres à l'ouest de la ville de Sichem (שְׁכֶם), première capitale de l'ancien royaume d'Israël, dont le nom est utilisé pour désigner Naplouse en hébreu. Elle est initialement peuplée d'anciens légionnaires romains (vétérans) qui reçoivent des parcelles de terre à cultiver.\nL'empereur Hadrien (vers 130) y fait construire un grand théâtre pouvant accueillir sept mille spectateurs. Les archéologues ont trouvé des pièces de monnaie de cette époque avec des emblèmes militaires et les visages des dieux et déesses grecs Zeus, Artémis, Sérapis ou Asclépios. Neapolis est entièrement païenne à l'époque. Le chrétien Justin de Naplouse naît dans la cité au IIe siècle et étudie le platonisme. La cité est prospère et tire encore des bénéfices de la lutte entre Septime Sévère et Pescennius Niger en 198-199. Cependant, elle prend parti pour ce dernier, et Septime Sévère en conséquence lui ôte ses privilèges commerciaux en faveur de Sébaste.\n\nPhilippe l'Arabe transforme Flavia Neapolis en Julia Neapolis en 244 et y fait venir de nouveaux colons romains. Elle garde le statut de colonie jusqu'en 251 sous Trébonien Galle. La ville à cette époque devient majoritairement chrétienne, avec une minorité samaritaine. L'évêque de Neapolis participe au concile de Nicée en 325.Des révoltes de Samaritains interviennent au Ve siècle, notamment en 451, à cause de relèvements de taxes. La ville, comme toute la Palestine, fait partie de la Syrie sous administration de l'Empire romain d'Orient, ou Empire byzantin et elle est agitée par les querelles du monophysisme - les monophysites refusant le retour du patriarche Juvénal au siège de Jérusalem. Les tensions augmentent en 485, lorsque des Samaritains assassinent des fidèles chrétiens qui se trouvaient dans la cathédrale de la ville, sous prétexte de rumeurs indiquant que les dépouilles des fils et petits-fils d'Aaron seraient transférées ailleurs par les chrétiens. L'évêque Térébinthe, qui a été blessé dans l'affaire, se rend à Constantinople pour demander un renforcement de la garnison. L'empereur Zénon fait bâtir une église dédiée à la Théotokos (Vierge Marie) au mont Garizim - lieu saint des Samaritains - et empêche ces derniers de se rendre sur leur colline sacrée. Ils se rebellent sous le règne de son successeur, l'empereur Anastase Ier, et plus tard la révolte est matée par Procope, gouverneur romain (c'est-à-dire byzantin) d'Édesse. Une dernière révolte intervient en 529, qui débute par l'assassinat de l'évêque Ammonas, tandis que les prêtres de la cité sont écartelés, puis brûlés avec les reliques des saints. Justinien Ier envoie ses troupes qui saccagent la cité ; les Samaritains qui ne s'enfuient pas sont en grande partie massacrés.\nNeapolis connaît ensuite une grande période de prospérité qui dure un siècle.\n\nMoyen Âge\nPériode des califats musulmans\nAprès la conquête de la cité par les musulmans, Arabes venus de Médine et La Mecque, en 636, quatre ans seulement après la mort du prophète Mahomet, la cité est renommée Nablus, arabisation de son ancien nom. La cité continue d'être une ville commerciale d'importance, et change de population sous la pression démographique de nouveaux immigrés musulmans venus de Perse et d'Arabie, et de l'arrivée de commerçants juifs. Les chrétiens et les Samaritains demeurent toutefois une fraction importante de la population.\nLe géographe arabe Al-Maqdisi la décrit au Xe siècle, comme un « petit Damas ». Naplouse est réputée pour ses ateliers de tissage, en particulier du lin, ses oliveraies et sa grande place du marché. La ville est entourée de moulins. On y construit la première mosquée fort imposante, tandis que la population s'islamise peu à peu, les chrétiens et les Samaritains étant soumis à des impôts plus importants. De plus, l'usage de l'arabe supplante définitivement l'usage du grec vers le Xe siècle.\n\nPériode du royaume croisé de Jérusalem\nLes Croisés arrivent ici en 1099 avec Tancrède et la renomment « Naples » (le nom de la « Naples » italienne vient aussi d'une ancienne « Neapolis », tout comme « Nabeul » en Tunisie). La cité devient la ville majeure en la seigneurie de Naplouse, un fief du royaume de Jérusalem. Elle est épargnée des combats, et des croisés s'y installent même. Le concile de Naplouse s'y réunit en 1120 et jette les fondations des premières codifications et lois du royaume franc. La communauté samaritaine a le droit de construire une nouvelle synagogue vers 1130, l'ancienne étant transformée en église.\nC'est vers 1140 et le milieu du XIIe siècle que les Arabes musulmans et leurs troupes turques reprennent leurs attaques à partir de leur base arrière de Damas. Ils brûlent les églises et une partie de la ville en 1137, mais finissent par être repoussés. La reine Mélisende de Jérusalem demeure à Naplouse qui retrouve sa prospérité, entre 1150 et 1161. Les croisés restaurent et agrandissent la ville, font construire une nouvelle église dédiée à la Passion du Christ et une autre à sa Résurrection, ainsi qu'une vaste hôtellerie pour les pèlerins chrétiens.\nCependant, les musulmans commandés par la dynastie ayyoubide s'emparent de Naplouse en 1187. La majorité des chrétiens latins s'enfuit par crainte de vengeance, tandis que les chrétiens arabes grecs-orthodoxes et les Samaritains demeurent, ainsi bien sûr que les musulmans.\nLes églises croisées et la synagogue samaritaine sont transformées en mosquées.\n\nPériode des Mamelouks du Caire\nLes Mamelouks d'Égypte s'emparent de Naplouse en 1260, y font construire de nouvelles écoles et de nouvelles mosquées, des bains turcs et des canalisations d'eau. L'huile d'olive et le savon de Naplouse sont exportés et réputés, jusqu'en Syrie, Arabie, Égypte et les îles méditerranéennes, ainsi que la confiture de caroube.\n\nPériode ottomane (1517-1917)\nLa Palestine tombe sous l'autorité ottomane en 1517. Elle fait partie de la Syrie ottomane et est divisée en six districts (sandjak) dont Naplouse est l'un d'eux. Le district de Naplouse est lui-même divisé en cinq sous-districts en plus de la ville. Les subdivisions correspondent aux terres et à l'influence de puissantes familles. L'islam devient nettement majoritaire au XVIe siècle. En 1552, seules quelque douze famille juives se trouvent dans la ville, rencontrées par le voyageur Moïse Bassola (en). Des recensements municipaux effectués au XVIe siècle témoignent toutefois d'une communauté juive comptant de 30 à 70 familles. Naplouse est pacifiée à plusieurs reprises surtout en 1657 grâce à l'intervention et aux finances de familles et tribus syriennes. En remerciement pour leur participation au retour au calme, le pouvoir du sultan attribue des terres et des villages à ces familles, comme les Nimr, originaires d'Homs, les Djarrar ou les Touqan, qui dirigent l'administration de la ville.\nDaher el-Omar, gouverneur galiléen en rivalité avec le pouvoir ottoman s'allie au milieu du XVIIIe siècle avec les Mamelouks pour les faire revenir dans la région, et fait lever des troupes, mais Naplouse ne succombe pas, cependant Naplouse passe sous la juridiction de Saint-Jean-d'Acre, jusqu'en 1804.\n\nL'Égypte obtient son autonomie sous Méhémet Ali et part à la conquête de la Palestine en 1831-1832. Cependant en 1834, les clans des grandes familles de Naplouse se rebellent contre l'autorité égyptienne, à cause de l'augmentation des impôts et d'une politique de conscription répressive. Jérusalem est conquise par la rébellion le 31 mai 1834, mais les rebelles sont délogés un mois plus tard par les soldats d'Ibrahim Pacha. La forteresse de Saint-Jean-d'Acre est détruite, ce qui a pour conséquence de favoriser le développement de Naplouse. Les Ottomans reprennent le pouvoir en main et mettent le clan Abd al-Hadi à la tête des instances locales.\nNaplouse surpasse en importance Jérusalem, Acre, ou Jaffa. Son activité principale est liée à la fabrique et au commerce d'huile d'olive et de ses produits dérivés, comme le savon. C'est aussi une des régions principales de la Syrie ottomane pour le coton, dépassant Damas.\nDu fait de sa situation entourée de collines, Naplouse cultive un certain esprit et aussi un certain état d'autonomie par rapport au pouvoir central ottoman. En 1848, le voyageur historien Baptistin Poujoulat écrit dans Récits et souvenirs d'un voyage en Orient que la ville compte alors 6 000 habitants, musulmans, juifs, samaritains et chrétiens, et qu' « ils vivraient dans l'aisance s'ils n'étaient pas pressurés par l'impôt du gouvernement turc ».\n\nÀ partir de la fin du XIXe siècle, la présence juive à Naplouse décline, malgré la présence de rabbins reconnus, mais qui n'étaient entourés que de poignées de fidèles. De plusieurs dizaines de familles au début du XVIIIe siècle, la communauté n'en compte aux débuts du sionisme qu'une douzaine, en partie par l'attraction produite par les nouvelles localités juives, relativement éloignées de la Samarie. Le passage au XXe siècle voit l'effacement de la présence juive à Naplouse.\n\nXXe siècle\nPériode de l'occupation, puis du mandat britannique (1917-1948)\nNaplouse passe sous autorité britannique à partir de novembre 1917. C'est la fin du pouvoir ottoman. La Société des Nations donne mandat en 1920 aux Britanniques pour favoriser en Palestine la création d'un foyer de peuplement juif.\nUn tremblement de terre sévère détruit en 1927 la partie historique de la ville, dont trois-cents bâtiments et la mosquée de la Victoire. La ville est reconstruite, mais elle perd son caractère historique en grande partie. De plus, les Britanniques détruisent le vieux quartier de Qaryoun, foyer de rébellion, après les révoltes de 1936-1939.\n\nPériode de l'occupation jordanienne (1949-1967)\nNaplouse fait partie de la Cisjordanie, après le plan de partage de 1947. Des milliers de Palestiniens ayant quitté les territoires administrés par le nouvel État d'Israël s'installent dans des camps de réfugiés aux abords de la ville et dans la ville elle-même, annexée par la Jordanie. Les camps principaux sont Ein Beit al-Ma, Balata et Askar. Raymonda Hawa-Tawil (La « Lionne de Naplouse ») y tient dans les années 1960-1970 un salon d'intellectuels.\n\nPériode de l'occupation israélienne (1967-1995)\nLa guerre des Six Jours a pour conséquence l'administration israélienne et la fondation de localités juives autour de la ville, Berakha, Itamar et Elon Moreh étant les plus proches.\nFinalement, l'autorité palestinienne obtient l'administration de la ville à partir du 12 décembre 1995, selon les accords d'Oslo, ce qui provoque l'élimination quasi totale de la circulation de Juifs dans la ville (à titre d'exemple la ligne de bus Jérusalem-Afula de la compagnie israélienne Egged comptait auparavant Naplouse parmi ses stations principales).\n\nSeconde Intifada (2000-2002)\nLes tensions augmentent en l'an 2000 entre les forces israéliennes et les habitants des camps de réfugiés, en particulier ceux de Balata et d'Askar. Lorsque les Palestiniens déclenchent la seconde intifada, des armements sont fabriqués dans ces camps et la présence juive dans la ville est éliminée. La répression aboutit selon le bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires à 522 morts dans la ville de Naplouse et les camps environnants et à 3 104 blessés entre 2000 et 2005.\n\nL'attentat du 27 mars 2002 à l'hôtel Park de Netanya qui cause la mort de 30 civils juifs et en blesse 143, suivi du meurtre de 4 membres de la famille Gavish le lendemain à Elon Moreh et de l'attentat meurtrier à Netzarim le surlendemain, provoque l'opération Rempart de la part des autorités israéliennes du gouvernement Sharon. Naplouse est une des villes visées du fait de la présence de responsables des massacres. Quatre-vingts habitants de Naplouse sont tués et plusieurs maisons détruites. Une seconde opération démarre le 22 juin suivant et les forces armées israéliennes restent à Naplouse jusqu'en septembre, imposant un couvre-feu de vingt-quatre heures pendant soixante-dix jours. Soixante maisons d'activistes palestiniens sont détruites au bulldozer, la grande mosquée et d'autres mosquées, ainsi que l'église grecque-orthodoxe, sont endommagées par les combats.\n\nXXIe siècle\nNaplouse est actuellement cernée par de nombreuses colonies israéliennes et par deux bases militaires israéliennes perchées sur les crêtes des montagnes. Beaucoup de Palestiniens subissent les arrestations préventives et les détentions administratives sans procès ni jugement.\nLe 16 octobre 2015, des Palestiniens incendient le tombeau de Joseph, lieu de pèlerinage des Juifs orthodoxes.\nLe groupe armé La Fosse aux lions, formé de quelques dizaines de jeunes combattants, a été formé à Naplouse en 2022. Beaucoup d'entre eux ont été tués dans des raids israéliens et la ville a été soumise à un blocus en 2022.\nLe 19 février 2023, un raid israélien fait onze morts et au moins cent deux blessés par balles.\nLe 9 octobre 2024, selon le Croissant Rouge et le ministère de la Santé, quatre Palestiniens âgés de 31 à 43 ans sont tués lors d'une opération de la police israélienne ; de leur côté, les Israéliens, dans un communiqué commun de la police, de l'armée et du Shin Bet, affirment avoir abattu cinq personnes recherchées pour terrorisme. D'après le gouverneur de Naplouse, les victimes était des « citoyens ordinaires ».\nLe 25 février 2025, un habitant de la ville est tué et d'autres blessés par l'armée israélienne.\n\nDepuis le début de la guerre de Gaza en 2023 toute la région de Naplouse subit des contrôles parfois très longs. Dix-sept checkpoints militaires entourent la ville en 2025. Le 10 juin 2025, l'armée israélienne lance une vaste opération militaire contre la ville ; deux personnes sont tuées, plus d'une soixantaine blessées et d'autres arrêtées dans la répression d'un groupe de jeunes hommes et des garçons qui s'étaient réunis pour brûler des pneus et jeter des pierres sur les véhicules blindés des forces d'occupation israéliennes. Un couvre-feu est instauré et les bâtiments publics de Naplouse, notamment les écoles, sont fermés. Un adolescent est tué par l’armée israélienne le 24 octobre. Un homme de 57 ans est tué près d'un point de contrôle le 5 septembre.\n\nPolitique et administration\nLa ville est dirigée par un conseil de quatorze membres.\n\nJumelages\nLille (France)\n Naples (Italie)\n Poznań (Pologne) depuis le 22 mai 1997\n Stavanger (Norvège)\n Schaerbeek (Belgique)\n\nPatrimoine\nLe puits de Jacob\nLe puits de Jacob est situé à l'entrée[Laquelle ?] de l'actuelle Naplouse.\n\nLe tombeau de Joseph\nSichem, site du tombeau de Joseph.

      "content": "## Overview\nNablus (Arabic نابلس, Hebrew שכם, Shechem) is a large city (population approximately 300,000) within the Palestinian Territories, in the Central Highlands of the West Bank, some 63 km north of Jerusalem.\n\n## Understand\nNablus is one of the oldest cities in the world, possibly established 9,000 years ago. It was called \"Shechem\" by its Canaanite and Israelite inhabitants. Shechem was the first capital of the northern ancient Israelite kingdom. The Romans built a new city (Flavia Neapolis, in honor of Flavius Vespasian) a short distance from Shechem. The name Nablus comes from Neapolis. The old city of Nablus is on the site of Neapolis, but in modern times the city has grown to include the site of Shechem as well.\nNablus is distinguished by its location in a narrow valley between the two mountains Gerizim and Ebal. This makes for an impressive view when you are in the city.\nSchools were established in the middle of the 19th century during the short reign of Ibrahim Pasha, but maintained their existence in the following years when the Ottomans regained control of the region. On 11 July 1927 the town suffered a major earthquake. Much of the consequent damage to buildings was never repaired, and the ruinous condition of many of them may well have encouraged the inhabitants to move outside the old city to build their new houses, although some new building to the north and west of the old city had already been undertaken before 1927. The arrival of the motor car has increased emigration to the slopes of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where new roads allow vehicles the easy access denied them in the hilly and partly-stepped streets of the old city.\nDuring the British Mandate (1917–1948), Nablus became the core of Palestinian Arab Nationalism, and it was the center of resistance against the British. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Nablus came under Jordanian rule, and two refugee camps were built near the city. In 1967, Nablus was occupied by the Israeli army for years, which caused much damage to the city. Three refugee camps were added to accommodate the people who fled to the city.\nNablus was invaded and occupied in 2002 during the Second Intifada, and has been raided frequently ever since. Nablus has a particularly high concentration of open anti-Israeli sentiments for a major West Bank city; you can see many memorials to Palestinians killed during Israeli attacks in the old city, and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Palestinian militants occasionally clash in some parts of greater Nablus such as the refugee camps. There are many damaged buildings and debris-filled fields around Nablus, the result of past Israeli aerial bombing, but the residents of Nablus have been working hard on repairing their city and the visible damage lessens every day. Israeli restrictions on the city are generally looser than they used to be, and a visit to Nablus in the daytime is a safe and worthwhile trip.\n\n## Get in\nAs of July 2010 there were no checkpoints for buses and service taxis (aka servees) entering Nablus from other West Bank cities, although you will need your passport and visa stamp to enter back into Israeli territory upon your return.\n\n## By bus\nRamallah and Jerusalem: From Jerusalem, take the #18 bus to Ramallah. The bus departs from the bus station off Nablus Road north of Damascus Gate and the Old City. A #18 bus leaves every 10 minutes throughout the day, and it costs ₪7. This bus will drop passengers off at the main street in Ramallah, but stay on until the main bus station. From the Ramallah Bus Station, a bus runs to Nablus (₪10.5) but the last bus leaves early, often around 4PM. If the last bus has already left a servees taxi will take you to Nablus from Ramallah for around ₪17. There are at least four bus stations in Ramallah, so ask around if you get off/start at the wrong one.\nOther West Bank cities: Servees taxis are easily found to Nablus from all major west bank transportation centres including Jenin (₪20), Tulkarm, Jericho, and other cities.\n\n## By plane\nBen Gurion International Airport (TLV) is the main international airport serving Israel and the West Bank. From Ben Gurion it is cheapest to take a \"sherut\" (shared taxi) to the bus station on Nablus Road by Damascus Gate, and then follow the directions above to Nablus. A sherut from Ben Gurion to Jerusalem costs ₪50 and runs constantly 24 hours a day.\n\n## Get around\nMost of the urban area of Nablus is small enough to be navigated on foot. It is not recommend that you wander around too much as there are a number of neighborhoods in Nablus that may have troubles with IDF raids and public unrest. However, the tensions have eased, but you should still check for the latest situation.\nThe public transportation in Nablus is informal, and is normally done by sharing service taxis (aka servees). The black-and-yellow taxis (sometimes with a Hebrew \"Monit\" sign on top) will take you anywhere in Nablus, and it's easy to find people to share the taxi with for many locations.\n\n## See\n32.21945535.2606151 The Old City (southeast from the commercial center). This is a charming area filled with winding narrow streets and small shops selling all kinds of foods, clothing, and trinkets. Simply enter the alleyways leading into it nearby the massive parking garage in the center of town, and wander around until you recognize every street.\nThe Souq (The q is silent) is a typical colorful and loud Palestinian vegetable market located right in the center of town. Look for the tent roofs.\n32.20944735.2854312 Jacob's Well (Be'er Ya'akov). The spot where it is believed that a Samaritan woman offered a drink from the well to Jesus and he then revealed to her that he was the Messiah (John 4:5), is located here. All Western monotheistic religions also believe this to be a site where Jacob camped near Shechem during his travels, hence the name. A Greek Orthodox Church is located on the site, and it is free to tour. Its hours are unpredictable, however. Ask a taxi driver downtown to take you to \"Be'er Ya'akov\" (₪2-5). If you come for a visit, do not venture down the road away from the city center as you will find yourself inside rough neighbourhoods.\n32.203335.269733 Mount Gerizim (overlooking Nablus city). Check for the hours, as this place does not seem to be open all the time. The top of the mountain hosts the community of \"Kiryat Luza\", one of the only two Samaritan communities left in the world. The Samaritans are an ancient offshoot of Judaism who believe that Mount Gerizim, and not the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the location of the Holy of the Holies. The Samaritans of Nablus hold both Palestinian and Israeli ID cards and historically have had good relations with both the Palestinians and the Israelis (they are also represented in the Nablus Municipality). The Palestinians of Nablus revere the Samaritans alleged ability to predict the future with palm readings by using the Samaritan holy books. Kiryat Luza offers tours of their community and even has a gift shop. Genetic studies have made the hypothesis that much of Nablus' Palestinian population are descendants of Samaritans who converted to Islam throughout the centuries of Muslim rule of the Holy Land.    (updated Jun 2018)\n32.21004835.2649384 Monastery of Bir el-Hamam (next to Mount Gerizim). Seen from all over Nablus, this monastery offers a great from above Nablus. The archaeological site included a complex of household installation and spaces, such as an open courtyard, a rain-fed cistern, a stable, and a kitchen. It also included a room with a mosaic floor with fragments of religious texts. This room gave access to an exceptional space of a chapel with colourful mosaics and a dedicatory text for three deceased ‘brothers, lovers of Christ’. A nicely decorated chancel screen separated the holy eastern part, the bema, with its altar table, from the main room.\n32.2126935.2854735 Joseph's Tomb. In the eastern part of the city is a Muslim and Jewish holy site; however, it closes sporadically and it may not be possible to visit. As of March 2008 Joseph's Tomb had part of the roof destroyed and has been burnt out. Of the two Palestinian guards, one spoke English, and after radioing in advised that photos could not be taken without permission.\n32.21335.282046 Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Daily 8AM - 3PM. Tell Balata archaeological site, near Nablus, the site contains the remains of a Middle Bronze Age city with a massive fortification wall (ca. 1650-1450 BC), two impressive gates and a fortress temple. The site has been identified as ancient Shechem, known from Egyptian and biblical references. Tell Balata was an important cultural and political centre due to its strategic location at the eastern end of a pass between Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal. It was overlooking the plain of Askar and commanded all traffic through the area. It was also a centre for agriculture and trade, it has been called “the uncrowned queen of Palestine”. The archaeological evidence on the history on the site is the result of German and American excavation during the 20th century. It shows that Tell Balata was first settled in the Chalcolithic period (c.4000- 3500 BC) and developed into a city during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. The site was used again during the Iron Age and throughout the Hellenistic times until the 1st century BC. After the Hellenistic times the focus of the settlement shifted further west to the newly established Roman town of Flavia Neapolis, now known as Nablus. Tell Balata is a potential World Heritage Site as part of \"Old Town Nablus and its environs\". The site is being developed by a joined Palestinian-Dutch project, in cooperation with UNESCO, into Tell Balata Archaeological Park. Facilities for visitors will be provided, as of 2013 there will be a visitor centre.\nClose-by popular sights of the West Bank (read here) are Sebastia Archaeological Park (conveniently located if you go north towards Jenin), Awarta village, Kifl Hares and Aqabah with the twin minaret.\n\n## Do\nClimb Mount Gerizim or Mount Ebal on either side of Nablus for a beautiful view of the city. A small Samaritan community, one of only two left in the world, resides atop Mt. Gerizim, and you can get a look at their temple on the mountaintop. Mt Gerizim is the most holiest place for the Samaritan religion, believed by the Samaritans to be the first piece of land ever created by God, and the Samaritan community there offers a tour of their community to visitors. If you can come for their Passover (not necessarily the same date as the modern Jewish Passover!) you will see a colorful festival involving the consumption of lamb and goat sacrifices, comparable to Jewish practices 2,000 years ago.
