      "content": "Rafah (Arabic: رفح Rafaḥ [rafaħ]) is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Rafah Governorate. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south-west of Gaza City. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889. Due to the Gaza war, about 1.4 million people from Gaza City and Khan Yunis, about 70% of Gaza's population, were displaced to Rafah, as of February 2024. By April 2025, most of the city was destroyed by means of systematic razing by the Israeli military. The remnants of the city are currently under Israeli control.\nAfter the 1948 Palestine war, Egypt governed the area and refugee camps for displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled from what became Israel were established. During the Suez Crisis, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees in the Rafah refugee camp, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces occupied the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip after capturing them from Egypt. In the same year, IDF troops bulldozed and demolished 144 houses in the Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\nWhen Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part, dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Then, since the year 2000, the core of the city was destroyed by Israel, and since the 2010s also by Egypt, in order to create a large buffer zone.\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Gaza's only airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, when it was bombed and bulldozed by the IDF.\n\nEtymology\nOver the ages the city has been known as Rpwḥw by the ancient Egyptians, 𒊏𒉿𒄭 Rapiḫi or 𒊏𒉿𒄷 Rapiḫu by the Assyrians, רפיח Rāphiyaḥ by the ancient Israelites, Ῥαφία Rhaphíā by the Greeks, Raphia by the Romans, and Rafh by the Arab Caliphate.\nIn English, Rafah ( (US) or   (UK)), derived from the modern Arabic, is most common, but Rafiah  (from the modern Hebrew) is also used. The form Raphiah  (from the ancient Hebrew) is used as well, especially in historical contexts such as the Battle of Raphiah.\n\nHistory\nBronze Age Raphia\nRafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I, from 1303 BCE as Rph, and as the first stop on Pharaoh Shoshenq I's campaign to the Levant in 925 BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the Assyrian king Sargon II's victory over the Egyptians.\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nIn 217 BCE, the Battle of Raphia was fought between the victorious Ptolemy IV and Antiochus III. It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of elephants.\nAntiochus III, willing to make peace with Ptolemy V, had his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia.\nThe town was conquered by Alexander Yannai and held by the Hasmoneans until it was rebuilt in the time of Pompey and Gabinius; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57 BCE. Rafah is mentioned in Strabo (16, 2, 31), the Antonine Itinerary, and is depicted on the Map of Madaba.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the Byzantine period, it was a diocese, and Byzantine ceramics and coins have been found there. It was represented at the Council of Ephesus 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church but a small Greek Orthodox presence exists.\n\nEarly Muslim to Mamluk periods\nRafah was one of the towns captured by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As in 635 CE, and subsequently was an important trading city during the Early Muslim period. Under the Umayyads and Abbasids, Rafah was the southernmost border of Jund Filastin (\"District of Palestine\"). According to Arab geographer al-Ya'qubi, it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from Ramla to Egypt.\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was \"of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a mosque, and hostelries\". However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an Ayyubid postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby Deir al-Balah.\n\nOttoman and Egyptian period\nRafah appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Gaza of the Liwa of Gazza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives. In 1799, the French Army of the Orient, led by Napoleon, passed through Rafah during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of Muhammad Ali, which lasted until 1840.\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin, who visited Rafah in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called Bab el Medinet, meaning \"The Gate of the town\". In 1881, Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria wrote: \"Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria.\"\n\nBritish period\nOn 9 January 1917, British forces captured Rafah, and subsequently used it as a staging post for their first attempt to capture Gaza. The presence of British military bases in Rafah served an economic draw which led to an influx of internal migration to the city. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandatory authorities, Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all of which Muslim. Nine years later, the Mandatory authorities conducted the 1931 census of Palestine, by which time Rafah's population had increased to 1,423 residents living in 228 houses, all of which were still Muslim.\nIn the Village Statistics, 1945, a joint survey conducted by the Mandatory government's Government Office of Statistics and Department of Lands for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, Rafah had an all-Muslim population of 2,220 people with 40,579 dunams of land. Of these, 275 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 24,173 dunams were used for growing cereals, while 16,131 dunams were un-cultivable land.\n\n1948–1967\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt governed the area (see Palestinian Protectorate) and refugee camps were established. During the Suez Crisis, 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees, were killed by troops of the Israel Defence Force in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces captured Rafah as part of their invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. The population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself. On Friday, 9 June 1967, the Israeli military bulldozed & blew up 144 houses in Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\n\nAfter 1967\nIn the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General Ariel Sharon (then head of the IDF southern command), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people. Israel established the Brazil and Canada housing projects to accommodate displaced Palestinians and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living; Brazil is immediately south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because UN peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 Camp David Accords mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada on 25 April 1989 Rafah resident Khaled Musa Armilat, aged 22, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis. In a letter to a Member of Knesset, March 1990, Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin stated that the dead man's brother had been interrogated and stated that he had been killed by Border Police but four months later he blamed the army. Rabin added the matter was being investigated by the Israeli Police.\nThree and a half weeks after Armilat's killing, 19 May, five civilians including a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in Rafah by Israeli soldiers using plastic bullets. Two of the 12 other casualties later died of their wounds.\nIn May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another mass demolition of homes in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname \"the bulldozer\".\nIn September 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, that smugglers have made tunnels under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.\n\n2023–25 Gaza war\nDuring the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) war on Gaza, civilians were told to flee to Rafah and forcibly displaced from their homes. Although the Israeli government declared the southern half of Gaza a safe zone, the IDF proceeded to bomb the region extensively, with a New York Times investigation estimating that 2,000-pound bombs were dropped at least 200 times as of 21 December 2023.\n\nBy February 2024, roughly two-thirds of Gaza's population, or 1.4 million people, had been forcibly displaced from other parts of the territory into Rafah, with the IDF declaring its intent to enter the city. Critics have warned about the potential for mass civilian casualties in the event of a ground invasion, with the UN secretary general António Guterres arguing that \"Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.\" On 9 February, Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to create an evacuation plan to remove civilians before launching an offensive against Rafah which is the last major population center in the Gaza Strip still under Hamas control and the elimination of Hamas was considered to be impossible as long as the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are intact. Prior to the start of the ground invasion, Israel began to intensify its strikes on Rafah from the air. More than 44 people were killed in airstrikes on Rafah on 11 February, with many likely still under the rubble. Netanyahu continued to push for a ground invasion, claiming that \"We're going to do it....Victory is within reach\".\nOn 11 February, The Wall Street Journal reported that Egypt had warned Hamas to release hostages within two weeks or face an IDF invasion of Rafah. A joint operation in Rafah by the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israel Police recovered two hostages (Fernando Marman and Luis Har) kidnapped by Hamas from Nir Yitzhak. During this operation, heavy bombardment by the IDF occurred in the area that includes many refugee camps killing 112 people with several bodies still under the rubble.\n\n2025 razing and destruction\nIn previous operations, Israel destroyed building on the border with Egypt, arguing it as a military need to cut Hamas from possible supply roads. On 3 April, about two weeks after the Gaza War resumed, the IDF advanced into Rafah as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the city.  It soon started massive operations to raze most of Rafah itself, flattening mosques, schools, greenhouses and even greenery. By mid May 2025, The New York Times reported with satellite images and on-the-ground videos proofs that most of the city housing and buildings have been purposely razed by Israeli bulldozers or controlled destructions. Side-by-side satellite imagery of the Shaboura neighborhood show it with all its pre-war buildings, then in its early-2025 state of widespread destruction, and then on 3 May 2025 with nearly all its buildings razed to the ground. The same is visible for most of the city.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a boundary between Ottoman-ruled Palestine and British-ruled Egypt, from Taba to Rafah. After World War I, Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local Bedouin. During the mid-1930s, the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town that functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population. During World War II, it became an important British base.\nFollowing the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza–Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city was now under Israeli occupation.\nIn 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty that returned the Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza–Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.\n\nDemographics\nIn 1922, Rafah's population was 599, which increased to 1,423 in 1931, increasing again to 1,635 in 1938, and further increased to 2,220 in 1945. In 1982, the total population was approximately 10,800.\nIn the 1997 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, Rafah and its adjacent camp had a combined population of 91,181, Tall as-Sultan was listed with a further 17,141. Refugees made up 80.3% of the entire population. In the 1997 census, Rafah's (together with Rafah camp) gender distribution was 50.5% male and 49.5% female.\nIn the 2006 PCBS estimate, Rafah city had a population of 71,003, Rafah camp and Tall as-Sultan form separate localities for census purposes, having populations of 59,983 and 24,418, respectively.\n\nRafah Border Crossing\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side. On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards as per the agreement signed by Egypt and Israel in November 2005.\nFollowing the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, Israel announced on October 14, 2025, that the Rafah crossing would remain closed, with no date set for its reopening. This has restricted the entry of aid.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh).\n\nSee also\nRafah Governorate\nRafah, Egypt\nIsrael–Gaza barrier\nGaza–Egypt border\nErez Crossing\nPhiladelphi Corridor\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\nWelcome To The City of Rafah Archived 19 February 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nRafah Today, pictures by Palestinian journalist Mohammed Omer\nRafah Smuggling Tunnels\nRafah Pundits: Rafah Focused Blog\nRaising Yousuf – Blog by Laila el-Hadad who is a reporter for Aljazeera living in Gaza\nReports from Rafah\nInterview with Hip Hop Artist Michael Franti Archived 14 November 2007 at the Wayback Machine – Reporting from Rafah.\nPart A Part B Satellite photos comparing 2001 to 2004.\nRazing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip – Human Rights Watch\nThe Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project – The organization started by people in the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Olympia, WA\nThe Madison-Rafah Sister City Project – A sistering project connecting the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Madison, WI",

      "content": "Rafah (en arabe : رَفَح (rafaḥ)) est une ville palestinienne située dans le Sud de la bande de Gaza, à la frontière égyptienne. La ville fut également connue sous le nom de Robihwa dans l'Égypte antique, Rafihu en Assyrie, Raphia chez les Grecs et les Romains.\nL'histoire de Rafah remonte à plusieurs millénaires, lorsque les Pharaons la développent pour assurer le contrôle de leur domaine de Canaan.\nC'est la ville la plus importante du Sud de la bande de Gaza avec plus de 250 000 habitants en 2023, dont une partie vit dans le camp de réfugiés fondé pendant la Nakba.\nElle est entièrement détruite par l'armée israélienne durant la guerre de Gaza.\n\nLocalisation\nLa ville est située au sud de la bande de Gaza, à la frontière avec l’Égypte.\n\nHistoire\nAntiquité\nL'histoire de Rafah remonte à plusieurs millénaires. La première fois que son nom est cité se situe pendant le règne du pharaon Séthi en 1303 av. J.-C., et la première campagne en Israël remonte à Sheshonq Ier en 925 av. J.-C.\nEn 720 av. J.-C., le roi assyrien Sargon II y défait les Égyptiens (Bataille de Raphia de -720), et le 22 juin 217 av. J.-C. se déroule la première grande bataille, qui voit le roi d'Égypte Ptolémée IV Philopator vaincre le dernier grand roi séleucide Antiochos III lors de la Bataille de Raphia : environ 140 000 soldats se confrontent, et près de 180 éléphants sont utilisés.\nUne source araméenne fait également de Rafah le lieu biblique de Chatzerim.\n\nMoyen Âge\nPendant la période byzantine, Rafah est un diocèse, et une importante ville commerçante avant la période arabe. Elle vit ensuite son déclin puis son abandon jusqu'au XIIe siècle. La fondation, en 1387, de Khan Younès, sur la route de Gaza, détourne les échanges régionaux vers cette nouvelle ville. Avec les Mamelouks, elle redevint une station postale.\n\nTemps modernes\nAu XVIe siècle les Ottomans y enregistrèrent un village de moins de vingt contribuables. Rafah apparaît dans les registres fiscaux ottomans de 1596 comme comptant 15 foyers, tous musulmans. \nEn 1799, l'armée française d'Orient, dirigée par le général Bonaparte, traverse Rafah lors de la campagne française en Égypte. Rafah est à la frontière entre les provinces d'Égypte et de Syrie. En 1832, la région est occupée par l'Égypte sous Muhammad Ali, occupation qui dure jusqu'en 1840.\nL'explorateur français Victor Guérin, qui visite Rafah en mai 1863, remarque deux piliers de granit que les habitants appelaient Bab el Medinet, ce qui signifie « la porte de la ville ». En 1881, l'archiduc Louis-Salvator de Habsbourg-Toscane écrit : « Des fragments de piliers de granit gris, toujours debout, jonchent la route, les champs et le sable, et nous en avons vu un gisant à moitié enfoui dans le sol... Ces piliers sont les vestiges d'un ancien temple, Raphia, et revêtent une importance particulière aux yeux des Arabes, qui les appellent Rafah, car ils marquent la frontière entre l'Égypte et la Syrie. ».\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nEn 1917, l'armée britannique s'empare de Rafah et l'utilise comme base arrière pour attaquer les Ottomans à Gaza. La présence de cette base fait partir les habitants et en 1922, la population n'est plus que de 600 personnes pour remonter à 2 500 habitants en 1948.\nAprès la guerre israélo-arabe de 1948, la ville pasea sous contrôle égyptien et accueille deux camps de réfugiés arabes provenant du territoire d'Israël fraîchement créé.\n\nOccupation israélienne\nL’armée israélienne, lors de son occupation de quatre mois de la bande de Gaza, en 1956-1957, perpètre un massacre dans le camp de Rafah, tuant 111 personnes, selon les Nations unies, deux fois plus, selon les sources palestiniennes.\nEn 1967, après la guerre des Six Jours, la ville passe sous occupation israélienne, au cours de laquelle de nouvelles tueries sous perpétrées contre la population. La population atteignait alors 55 000 habitants, dont seulement 11 000 habitent la ville proprement dite.\n\nAu mois de janvier 1972, 20 000 personnes sont expulsées et leurs maisons détruites afin de construire une colonie israélienne. \nEn 1982, la paix entre Israël et l’Égypte divise Rafah entre sa partie égyptienne et sa partie palestinienne, formalisant une frontière qui était restée abstraite durant trois quarts de siècle. Plus de trois cents maisons sont alors détruites par l’armée israélienne afin d’instaurer un « corridor de Philadelphie » le long de la frontière égyptienne.\nEn 1994, Yasser Arafat est accueilli par une marée humaine à Rafah, pour son arrivée dans la bande de Gaza permise par les accords de paix d'Oslo. Ces derniers confient à l'Autorité palestinienne la gestion des trois quarts de la bande de Gaza et d’une partie de la Cisjordanie, mais Israël continue de contrôler étroitement la frontière avec l’Égypte et des colonies, d’où de nombreux incidents.\nDepuis septembre 2000, la ville est un des hauts lieux de la seconde intifada. Elle est en effet reliée à l'Égypte par des tunnels qui servent à acheminer vers la bande de Gaza non seulement des armes, mais aussi de la nourriture, des médicaments, et tout autre objet de la vie quotidienne. Ceci explique les fréquentes incursions de l'armée israélienne dont l'efficacité et les moyens utilisés restent contestés par la communauté internationale. Le petit aéroport de Rafah, ouvert en 1998, est détruit par l’armée israélienne en 2001. C'est à Rafah que sont tués en 2003 Rachel Corrie, une Américaine de 23 ans écrasée par un bulldozer israélien, et Thomas Hurndall, un Britannique de 22 ans tué d’une balle en pleine tête, tous deux militants pacifistes.\nEn mai 2004, l'armée israélienne lance l'opération Arc-en-ciel pour tenter de mettre fin aux attaques palestiniennes, aux bombardements des villages israéliens, et particulièrement à l'utilisation des tunnels par les trafiquants d'armes à la frontière égyptienne. Cette opération détruira plusieurs centaines de maisons et fera des dizaines de morts parmi les populations civile et armée de Rafah.\n\nBlocus israélo-égyptien de l'enclave de Gaza\nÀ la suite du retrait israélien de la bande de Gaza, achevé le 12 septembre 2005, le point de passage de Rafah est géré par l'Autorité palestinienne sous surveillance vidéo de l'Union européenne.\nÀ partir de décembre 2006, de nombreux accrochages opposent miliciens du Fatah et du Hamas jusqu'à la victoire de ce dernier en juin 2007. Les autorités égyptiennes ferment la frontière en réponse à l'avancée du Hamas. Fin 2007, la mission européenne EUBAM-Rafah est suspendue. Elle est maintenue en suspens, prête à reprendre ses opérations de surveillance dès que la situation politique le permettra.\n\nGuerre de Gaza de 2008-2009\nÀ la suite de la chute du président Moubarak, les autorités égyptiennes annoncent que le blocus sera levé fin mai 2011. Les Européens espèrent pouvoir reprendre leurs activités mais en juillet 2012, ils réduisent, à nouveau, le niveau de la mission.\n\nL'attentat du 7 juillet 2017 à Rafah est une attaque terroriste islamiste à la voiture piégée faisant 23 morts et 30 blessés. Le groupe terroriste État islamique revendique l'attaque. Deux voitures piégées ont explosé en traversant deux points de contrôle de l'armée dans la province du Sinaï à la frontière avec la bande de Gaza faisant 23 morts et 30 blessés.\n\nGuerre de 2023-2024\nLors de l'offensive israélienne de 2023-2024 sur la bande de Gaza de la guerre à Gaza, près de 1,5 million de Gazaouis trouvent refuge, sur ordre de l’armée israélienne, à Rafah. À partir de mars 2024, l’armée israélienne concentre ses attaques sur Rafah et mène des opérations militaires dans et autour de plusieurs hôpitaux, tandis que le gouvernement israélien se déclare déterminé à lancer une vaste offensive terrestre dans cette zone malgré la présence massive de réfugiés. Le responsable des territoires palestiniens au Programme alimentaire mondial de l’ONU, Matthew Hollingworth, avertit sur la situation humanitaire catastrophique : « il n’y a pas un autre endroit dans le monde où un aussi grand nombre de personnes font face à une famine imminente ».\n\nLe 7 mai 2024, après la fermeture par Israël du poste-frontière de Kerem Shalom, l'armée israélienne prend le contrôle du poste-frontière de Rafah de façon à verrouiller la bande de Gaza, Israël affirmant que le Hamas l'utilisait à des fins terroristes.\n\nLe 26 mai 2024, l'armée israélienne bombarde le camp de réfugiés de Tel al-Sultan, déclenchant un incendie et tuant une cinquantaine de personnes dont cinq enfants, et faisant des centaines de blessés. Le 28 mai, au moins 37 Palestiniens sont tués dans de nouveaux bombardements sur le quartier de Tel al-Sultan. Le 30 mai, au moins 12 Palestiniens sont tués dans un bombardement aérien sur Rafah. Le Croissant-Rouge palestinien annonce le 30 mai la mort de deux de ses secouristes, tués dans « une frappe israélienne directe » contre une ambulance dans la région de Rafah.\nLe 27 mai 2024, en réaction à l'offensive, un utilisateur du réseau social Instagram partage une image reprenant le slogan All Eyes on Rafah. Largement partagée dans le monde entier et vue par 47 millions de personnes en 48 heures, elle devient l'un des symboles du soutien à la cause palestinienne. \nÀ la fin du mois de mai, tous les hôpitaux sont hors service à cause des bombardements. L'ONU qualifie la situation à Rafah d'« enfer sur terre ».\nDébut juin, plus d'un million de personnes ont été déplacées de force de Rafah après plusieurs semaines d'offensive israélienne.\nLe 6 juin, l'armée israélienne bombarde une école de l’Unrwa, tuant 37 personnes qui y étaient réfugiées.\nLe 23 mars 2025, l'armée israélienne massacre à Rafah quinze secouristes, dans le quartier de Tal Al-Sultan, alors qu’ils venaient en aide aux victimes d’une frappe aérienne. Le 31, Tsahal ordonne à la population de quitter la ville, provoquant un exode.\nEn avril 2025 l'armée israélienne déclenche une nouvelle offensive sur Rafah, affirmant le 12 avril encercler totalement la ville.  Selon l'agence Reuters Tsahal rase les ruines de la ville après l'avoir incorporé à sa « zone de sécurité » au sein de laquelle toute présence palestinienne est interdite, ce que confirme Le Monde.\n\nPersonnalités liées à Rafah\nYasser Abu Shabab, chef de la milice Forces populaires.*\n\nGalerie\nNotes et références\nArticles connexes\nListe des ports antiques du Levant\nRafah (camp)\nPoste-frontière de Rafah\nOpération militaire israélienne à Rafah de 2004\nRelations entre l'Égypte et Israël\nAttentat du 7 juillet 2017 à Rafah\nGaza 1956.
