      "content": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name for Bethlehem in local languages is  /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning \"house of meat\", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally \"house of bread\" or \"house of food.\" The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem. In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.\n\n\"House of the god Lahmu\"\nCanaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean \"house of\", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, lahmo being the Chaldean word for \"fertility\". Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder, was \"certainly accurate\". Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: \"'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic.\" While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.\n\n\"House of war\"\nAnother suggestion is an association with the root l-h-m \"to fight\", leading to the meaning of \"house of war\" or \"house of fighting\", but this is thought unlikely.\n\nHistory\nCanaanite period\nThe earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking Bit-Laḫmi in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: \"Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!\"\nIt is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. Laḫmu was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as Leḥem. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as Beit Lahama, \"House (Temple) of Lahmu\". By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as \"Philistia\", later corrupted to \"Palestine\".\nA burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.\n\nIsraelite and Judean period\nArchaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads \"From the town of Bethlehem to the King\". According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nBiblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the \"hill country\" of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means \"fertile\", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the \"City of David\". It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried \"by the wayside\" (Genesis 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.\nWriting in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.\n\nClassical period\nThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name בית לחם (Beit Lekhem). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.\nNonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.\nAround 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.\nIn 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the \"Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.\" In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.\nIn 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.\nIn 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.\nBethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.\n\nOttoman era\nFrom 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.\nBethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).\n\nFrom 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town's growth.\nSocin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 \"Latins\" in 256 houses, 824 \"Greeks\" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.\n\nModern era\nBethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.\nJordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy's death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.\nOn December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.\n\nToday, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.\n\nGeography\nBethlehem is located at an elevation of about 775 meters (2,543 ft) above sea level, 30 meters (98 ft) higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.\nThe city is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, 75 kilometers (47 mi) west of Amman, Jordan, 59 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and 10 kilometers (6 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.\nIn the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.\n\nClimate\nBethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of 700 millimeters (28 in) of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.\nBethlehem's average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and \"the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.\" Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of \"principally Christians, Latins and Greeks\" with no Jewish inhabitants.\nThe census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).\nThe 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem's population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 \"other\").\nIn 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.\nIn the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.\n\nChristian population\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.\nThe percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that \"due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.\" The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.\nIn 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population's proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.\nA study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.\n\nEconomy\nShopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.\nCremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.\nIn 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.\nThe Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.\n\nReligious significance and commemoration\nBirthplace of Jesus\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus' parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod's impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.\nEarly Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.\n\nChristmas celebrations\nChristmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine's Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.\n\nOther religious festivals\nBethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.\n\nCulture\nEmbroidery\nThe women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its \"strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.\" Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.\n\nBethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for \"royal\" wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.\n\nMother-of-pearl carving\nThe art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.\n\nCultural centers and museums\nBethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.\n\nThe Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.\nBethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit \"high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere\". The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.\n\nLocal government\nBethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.\nBethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars (\"heads\") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.\n\nThroughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.\nThere are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.\n\nMayors\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.\n\nBethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.\n\nTransportation\nBethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.\nThe Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBethlehem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nBethlehem of Galilee\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania\nBethlehem, Wales\nStar of Bethlehem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBethlehem Municipality\nWelcome To The City of Bethlehem\nOpen Bethlehem civil society project Archived April 19, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\nPhoto: Christmas in Bethlehem, 2008 Archived November 23, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\nBethlehem Fair Trade Artisans\nBethlehem University\nBethlehem aerial photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem",
      "summary": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.",

      "content": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانية: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانية: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينية: Bethleem) هي مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة بيت لحم. تقع في الضفة الغربية التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية على بعد 10 كم إلى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمة بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافة والسياحة في فلسطين.\nللمدينة أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسة فوق كهف أو مغارة يعتقد أنها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداباً آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينة وفقًا لعلماء الآثار على يد الكنعانيين في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والآراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينة عدد من الغزاة عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقية فلسطين للفتح الأشوري والبابلي والفارسي والإغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. وأُعيد بناؤها من قبل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الأرثوذكسية اليونانية برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد أن فتح المدينة صلاح الدين الأيوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينة وأعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطرة على المدينة من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وكان من المفترض أن تُضمّن في المنطقة الدولية في إطار خطة الأمم المتحدة لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. وأُلحقت المدينة بالأردن بعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها إسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الأيام الستة. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقية أوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنية والأمنية في المدينة إلى يد السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخياً منطقة مسيحية السكان، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من أكبر المجتمعات المسيحية الفلسطينية.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحة التي تزداد أثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون إلى كنيسة المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم أكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشة عمل للحرف اليدوية. ويسكن هذه المدينة أحد أقدم المجتمعات المسيحية في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجرة. اختيرت المدينة عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينة بيت لحم أول إصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح أول مدينة تغلق في فلسطين لمدة زادت عن 70 يوماً.\n\nالتسمية\nكان يقع ضمن موقعها مکان عبادة كنعاني يدعى بیراث أربع أو برج أربع، باسم جد الكنعانيين، فتوارث الإسرائيليون المكان والتقاليد فقدموا الذبائح لإلههم يهوه في برج أربع، ويعزو البعض تسمية المدينة بيت لحم بسبب وجود مائدة التقدمة في هذا المكان (صموئيل الأول 9 : 12، 20 : 6، 6 : 29) - ویسمی تلمود أورشلیم المغارة الكبيرة في أفراتا باسم جد الأدوميين والعرب الذين ينتمي لهم الكميتيون والكنسينيون وينتسب لهم كالب، فيُقرأ في \"مدراش أیکا رباني\" (68 : 3) \"في ببرات أربع في اليهودية يأتي المسيا للعالم\". وتشير الملاحظة التابعة أن پيرات أربع هي مكان في بيت لحم وتدعي كذلك \"بيرات ملكا\" نسبة إلى برج الملك. وتذكر \"أخبار الأيام الأولى في التوراة (11 : 16) \"وكان داود حينئذ، في الحصن بينما جنود الفلسطينيين يحاصرون بيت لحم\".\nوذكر نومكينز في مجلة مؤسسة الآثار الفلسطينية الربع سنوية  أن المكان كان مرکراً لإله الخصب الكلداني «لاحمو» وذكرته رسائل تل العمارنة باسم بیت إيلي لاحاما. وكان الكنعانيون يقيمون البيوت لآلهتهم أينما اعتقدوا بوجودها وكانت منطقة بيت لحم بسيولها الخصبة أهلا أن يسكنها إله الخصب. فبنوا له معبدا يطل على السيول دعي «بيت إيلي لاحاما» الذي بقي على مر العصور وتقلب الشعوب. وأي اسم أجدر وأقدس من اسم إله لتحافظ عليه وتحترمه وتتوارته الأقوام اللاحقة. كما ذكر المؤرخ الألماني، و.شريدر في جريدة الأداب الشرقية عدد 18 لعام 1915م عن صفائح رسائل تل العمارنة أن هذا الرأي في التسمية قد ثبت وتمكن. بينما التفسيرات العبرانية لاسم بیت لحم ببيت الخبز فهي شعبية ترکت نهائيا.\nظهر رأي يتردد في المراجع بالرغم من عدم صحته وهو أن قبيلة عربية تدعم لخم سكنت هذه المنطقة، بعد نزوحها من الجزيرة العربية خمسمئة عام قبل الميلاد عندما نزح المنائيون ولحق بهم قبیلتا لخم وجذام، فسكن اللخميون الصحراء ما بين الرملة ومصر وقسم منهم في الجولان وحوران وباسان حتى مدينة نوا، أما الجذامیون فسكنوا غور الأردن من طبريا حتى اللجون، يمون وعكا، ويكفي النظر إلى تاريخ النزوح لننفي أي علاقة باسم بيت لحم الذي ذكر قبل 1800 عام قبل الميلاد. وليس لدولة اللخميين في الحيرة في العراق كذلك أي علاقة لتسمية بيت لحم. إذ ظهرت دولة اللخميين حوالي القرن الخامس ميلادي فقط.\nودُعيت ببيت لحم بافراتا وهي كلمة كلدانية معناها الخصبة (تكوين 35 : 16، 19) (منيحا 5 : 2) (راعوت 4)، وذكر المورخ اليهودي يوسفوس فلافيوس\" آن راحيل\nدفنت في بلاد افراتا\". وجدير بالذكر أن القمح البري وجد في هذه المنطقة.\nوبني الكنعانيون بيتا آخر «لإيلي لاحاما» في شمال البلاد في الجليل إلى الشمال الغربي من مدينة الناصرة وعلى بعد أحد عشر كيلومترا منها، ذكرتها التوراة عدة مرات ولربما كانت أكثر أهمية من بيت لحم الجنوب لخصب محیطها وغنى أهلها. وكانت تابعة لسبط زبلون زمن الإسرائيليين: (يشوع 19 : 10)، (قضاة 12 : 8) \nشيد الألمان الهيكليون قريتهم ببيت لحم على آثار بیت لحم القديمة عام 1901م، وبقيت مزدهرة حتى احتلها اليهود عام 1948 لتصبح يهودية، وللتفرقة عرفت بيت لحم الجنوبية باليهودية والشمالية ببيت لحم الجليل.\nوبظهور النبي داوود في بيت لحم الصغرى بزغ اسمها من الظلمة إلى النور، إذ جاء صموئيل النبي إلى بيت لحم ليصبح ابن يسي الأصغر ملكا على اليهود (صموئيل الأول 16 : 1). وفي يوم التقدمة عند اليهود سكب صموئيل الزيت من الفرن على رأس داوود وأخذ اسم هذا يعلو على اسم شاول الملك آنذاك فامتلأ حقدا عليه. ويذكر (صموئيل الأول 20 : 29) کیف اختبأ داوود من شاول خوفا منه إذ حاول قتله. واعتذر یوناشاس ابن شاول لأبيه عن صديقه داوود لعدم حضوره وليمة الملك بأنه ذهب إلى بيت لحم بمناسبة رأس الشهر القمري ليقدم الذبيحة مع أهله: وتقديم الذبيحة على هيكل مقدس، طقس، لا بد وأن الإسرائيليون توارثوه عن الكنعانين - بنت إيلي لاحاما. ويعتقد أن هذا البيت المقدس كان يطل على السهول الخصبة والصحراء الشرقية حيث تقوم اليوم المقدسات المسيحية، حيث اشتعلت نيران التقدمة لترضي إيلي لاحاما الكنعاني وثم التهمت النيران قرابين الإسرائيليين لترضي إلاههم يهوه، ثم جاءت المسيحية فالوثنية فالمسيحية ثانية لتشيد مقدساتها على أنقاض المقدسات السالفة.\n\nودعي داود بابن يسى الأفراتي (صموئيل الأول 17 : 12)  وينسب اليمالك والد زوج راعوث إلى هذا النسب أيضا (راعوث 1 : 2) ولما تزوج بوعاز التلحمي من راعوث الأرملة تمني له مواطنوه «أن يزدهر بيتها في افراتا ويشتهر في بيت لحم» (راعوت 4 : 11)  وأنجبت راعوثم بن بوعاز ابنا هو عوبید والد يسی والد داوود. فأصبح اسم هذا النسل مربتوا باسم بيت لحم، وذكر ميخا في نبواته (5 : 2) حوالي 750 عام قبل الميلاد: «أما أت يا بيت لحم أفراته وأنت صغيرة أن تكوني بين أوف يهوذا، فمنك يخرج لي الذي يكون متسلطا على إسرائيل ومخارجة منذ القديم، منذ أيام الأزل» \nكذلك ذكر في (أخبار الأيام الأولى 2 : 19، 24، 50) أن هذا النسل الذي كان يسكن محيط بيت لحم (بيت افرات) ينسب دائما لافراتا. وكل هذا يشهد أن الاسم أفراتا أطلق على المنطقة التي مركزها بيت لحم.\n\nالتاريخ\nالعهد الكنعاني\nلقد سكن الكنعانيون المدينة سنة 2000 ق.م، ويروى أن النبي يعقوب جاء إلى هذه المدينة وهو في طريقه إلى الخليل، وماتت زوجته راحيل في مكان قريب من بيت لحم يعرف اليوم بقبة راحيل وفي بيت لحم ولد الملك داوود. وتوالت عليها الأحداث، وكانت في العصور القديمة قرية متواضعة تكتنفها الأودية العميقة من جهاتها الثلاث. وكانت خصبة الموقع تنتشر فيها حقول القمح. وفي القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد -\tظهرت في مخطوطات تل العمارنة منطقة اسمها بيت لحم وذلك عند الحديث عن أنباء الحروب التي قامت جنوب القدس. من المحتمل أن أول استيطان بشري وقع فيها عندما حطت بعض جماعات من البدو حول النبع الواقع على بعد 200 متر من كنيسة الميلاد.\nتظهرُ أول إشارة تاريخية إلى المدينة في رسائل تل العمارنة (حوالي 1400 قبل الميلاد) عندما ناشد ملك القدس سيده الأعلى، ملك مصر، للحصول على المُساعدة لاستعادة السيطرة على «بيت - لحمي» في أعقاب الاضطرابات من جانب عبيرو. ويعتقد أن تشابه هذا الاسم مع شكلها الحديث يدُل على أنها كانت مُستوطنة كنعانية، الذين يملُكون ثقافية ولغوية سامية مع الوافدين على المدينة لاحقًا.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي عام 325 بعد إعلان حرية التعبد للديانة المسيحية، طلب القديس مكاريوس بطريرك القدس من الإمبراطور أن يعيد المكان المقدس، فبنت القديسة هيلانة بازيليك الميلاد. في عام 384 مع وصول القديس هيرونيموس إلى بيت لحم قام في المدينة مركز عبادة لاتيني دام بعد وفاته سنين عديدة. في عام 614 أدّى غزو جيوش كسرى إلى خراب اليهودية ولم ينج من بيت لحم سوى بازيليك الميلاد وذلك كما يقال بفضل رسم للمجوس قائم على جدار البازيليك. والمجوس وهم ملوك الفرس الذين سجدوا ليسوع الطفل بحسب الرواية الإنجيلية.\n\nاستمدت بيت لحم شهرتها العالمية الكبرى من مولد يسوع فيها. ويروى أن يوسف النجار، ومريم العذراء ذهبا إلى بيت لحم لتسجيل اسمهما في الإحصاء العام، فولدت مريم وليدها هناك. وترى المصادر المسيحية أن الولادة كانت في مغارة قريبة من القرية، ولكن القرآن (يقول): (فاجأها المخاض إلى جذع النخلة) وفي سنة 330 م بنت هيلانة أم قسطنطين الكبير، كنيسة فوق المغارة التي قيل إن يسوع ولد فيها، وهي اليوم أقدم كنيسة في العالم. والمغارة تقع داخل كنيسة الميلاد، ومنحوته في صخر كلسي، وتحتوي على غرفتين صغيرتين، وفي الشمالية منها بلاطة رخامية، منزل منها نجمة فضية، حيث يقال أن يسوع ولد هناك. وعندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس، توجه إلى بيت لحم، وفيها أعطى سكانها أمانًا خطيًا على أرواحهم وأولادهم وممتلكاتهم وكنائسهم. ولما حان وقت الصلاة، صلى بإشارة من راهب، أمام الحنية الجنوبية للكنيسة، التي أخذ المسلمون يقيمون فيها صلواتهم، فرادى، وجعل الخليفة على النصارى إسراجها وتنظيفها. وهكذا صار المسلمون والمسيحيون يقيمون صلواتهم جنباً إلى جنب.\nتذكر بيت لحم في العهد الجديد باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع: «ولما ولد يسوع في بيت لحم اليهودية» (مت 2: 1 5، لو 2: 4 15)، ونتيجة لذلك حدثت مذبحة الأطفال الأبرياء بأمر هيرودس الملك (مت 2: 8 و16). وحيث أن هادريان قد جرب بيت لحم تماما، واقام في موضعها نصبا مقدسا للاله «ادونيس»، فلابد ان تكريم تلك المدينة باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع، يرجع إلي ما قبل عصر هادريان (132 م). وقد اقام قسطنطين الملك (حوالي 330 م) كنيسة على الطراز الروماني فوق موقع كهف المذود الذي شهد مولد يسوع. وتعتبر هذه الكنيسة حتى اليوم أهم مقصد للسياح، في المدينة. وهي لم يطرا عليها تغيير كبير، رغم أن جستنيان قد وسع فيها وزينها، ورغم ما تعرضت له من تهدم وترميم.\n\nالحكم العربي الإسلامي\nفي سنة 648 م دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الإسلامي، وزارها الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب الذي لم يصلّ داخل كنيسة المهد، خوفاً من أن تحدث نزاعات في المستقبل على الكنيسة بين المسلمين والمسيحيين حيث صلى بجانبها. وكانت المدينة قد اُلحقت بجند فلسطين التابع لولاية الشام بعد أن تم فتح جميع أراضي بلاد الشام على يد عدد من القادة منهم عمرو بن العاص وأبو عبيدة بن الجراح.\nيشار إلى أنه تم بناء مسجد في بيت لحم عام 1860 وهو مسجد عمر نسبة للخليفة عمر بن الخطاب، والذي تم ترميمه حتى العام 1954 تحت الإدارة الأردنية للمدينة. وكانت الأرض التي تم بناء المسجد عليها تم التبرع بها من قبل الكنيسة الأرثوذكسية اليونانية.\nوقد عاش أبناء الديانتين المسيحية والإسلامية في هذه المدينة بروح من الإخاء والتعاون وتمارس كل فيهما شعائرها الدينية ونشاطاتها الاقتصادية الاجتماعية على الرغم من أن المدينة تعرضت لفترات من المد والجزر حسب الحكم القائم، ومن أكثر العهود ازدهارًا بالنسبة لبيت لحم هو زمن هارون الرشيد 786-809 م والدولة الفاطمية 952-1094 م، حيث راجت التجارة وتيسرت الحرية والأمن ورممت الكنائس وأماكن العبادة.\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nفي 1099 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم الصليبي بعد أن دخلها الجيش الصليبي بقيادة تانكرد فدمر المدينة واحرقها ولم يتبق منها إلا كنيسة المهد. لم يكتف الصليبيون بما حازوا عليه، فقاموا بتوسيع حدود المملكة، ومع أواخر يوليو 1099 غزوا شمال فلسطين، ثم وصل جيش الفاطميين في 12 أغسطس فالتقى وجيش المملكة الوليدة في عسقلان، وأحرز الصليبيون نصرًا هامًا ضمن لهم السيطرة على الساحل الفلسطيني؛ وقد دار خلاف بين أمراء المملكة حول طبيعة الدولة بين كونها دولة دينية يحكمها أسقفها ديبامرت مبعوث البابا، أو دولة مدنية يحكمها جودفري، واتفق أخيرًا على كونها دولة مدنية وذلك بمباركة ديبامبرت مبعوث البابا إلى المملكة، رغم أن طموحه هذا عاد للظهور بعد وفاة جودفري. عام 1100 توفي جودفري بنتيجة المرض، وخلفه شقيقه بالدوين الأول المتحدر من بولونيا وقد انتخب في 11 نوفمبر وتمّ التتويج في بيت لحم يوم 25 ديسمبر 1100 وهو يوم عيد الميلاد، بعد تنافس مع تانكرد والأسقف ديامبرت حول وراثة العرش، وقد تم إرضاء تانكرد بمنحه إمارة أنطاكية بعد أسر أميرها في حلب. أما بالدوين فكان أول من خلع عليه لقب «ملك المملكة اللاتينية في القدس»، ما شكل ترسيخًا لهوية الدولة الجديدة، وقد قسمت الدولة إلى أربع مطرانيات وأبرشيات عديدة تحت سلطة بطريرك القدس.\nوقد دام الحكم الصليبي لبيت لحم حتى عام 1187 حيث عادت لأصحابها بعد انتصار المسلمين بقيادة صلاح الدين الأيوبي على الصليبين في معركة حطين. وفي عام 1229 عادت مدينة بيت لحم لحكم الصليبين بموجب الاتفاقية التي وقعت بين ممثلي الخليفة الكامل فخر الدين وأمير أربيل صلاح الدين وممثلي الإمبراطور فريدريك. لكنهم فقدوها نهائيا بعد عدة سنين فقط.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nفي عام 1244 تمكن المسلمون بقيادة نجم الدين من استعادة المدينة بشكل نهائي، قام بعدها الظاهر بيبرس بدخول المدينة عام 1263 ودمرا أبراجها وهدم أسوارها، وفي عام 1517 دخلت المدينة تحت الحكم العثماني، وبعد تطور وسائل النقل والمواصلات تحولت المدينة إلى مركز جذب هام للحجاج القادمين من أوروبا وانعكست أثاره على الأوضاع في المدينة وازدهرت صناعة الصوف والخزف وغيرها إلا أن سوء الأوضاع الاقتصادية دفع بالكثير من أبناء المدينة إلى الهجرة خارجها.\nفي القرن التاسع عشر - ومع بداية القرن الماضي أخذت المدينة بالنمو خاصة على أيدي المسيحيين الذين كانوا يشكلون الأكثرية العظمى. في عام 1831، عندما احتل محمد علي باشا مصر المدينة، طرد المسلمون المسيحيين وأمر الباشا بهدم حيّهم. وبعد عشرة أيام أعاد الأتراك بناءه.\nمن 1831 إلى 1841، كانت فلسطين تحت حكم أسرة محمد علي من مصر. خلال هذه الفترة، عانت المدينة من الزلازل الذي ضربها، فضلًا عن تدمير القوات المصرية لحي مسلم في عام 1834، على ما يبدو أنتقامًا لمقتل أحد الموالين لرعاية إبراهيم باشا. في عام 1841، أصبحت بيت لحم تحت سيطرة الحكم العثماني مرة أخرى وظلت كذلك حتى نهاية الحرب العالمية الأولى. في العهد العثماني، من المشاكل التي واجهتها سكان بيت لحم البطالة والخدمة العسكرية الإجبارية والضرائب الثقيلة، مما أدى إلى هجرة جماعية خاصة إلى أميركا الجنوبية.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت بيت لحم بيد الجيش الإنجليزي، ودخلت المدينة مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظلة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، وأصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فترة الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها إلى المنطقة المدوّلة عندما أصدرت الأمم المتحدة قرار تقسيم فلسطين إلى دولتين عربية ويهودية عام 1947، ولكن قام الأردن بضمها مع سائر مناطق الضفة الغربية عام 1951. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى حرب 1967.\nارتفعت درجة بيت لحم الإدارية بعد أن كانت (ناحية) في العهد العثماني إلى (قضاء) في العهد البريطاني، يقع بين اقضية القدس والخليل وأريحا. وبقي كذلك لعام 1944 م حيث الغي هو وقضاء اريحا والحقا بقضاء القدس. فكان ذلك آخر تغيير إداري قامت به الحكومة البريطانية في فلسطين.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة UNSCOP المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية واليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية. وكان نصيب بيت لحم أن يتم الحاقها بالمنطقة المدولة مع القدس.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nومع باقي الضفة الغربية دخلت المدينة في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية، وأصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم. وبقيت تحت الحكم الأردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 أو النكسة.\n\nالنكسة\nسقطت المدينة في يد إسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمدة 27 سنة وتعاني من الإهمال الإسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربية الفلسطينية المحتلة. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعة من أراضي بيت لحم وأقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينة بيت لحم بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الأولى. وكانت القيادة الوطنية الموحدة للانتفاضة، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الأسبوعية في شوارع بيت لحم مع جدول زمني للإضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليومية ضد الدوريات الإسرائيلية في المدينة. وفي المظاهرات، تم أحراق الإطارات في الشوارع، كما ألقى الحشود الحجارة والزجاجات الحارقة على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الإسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينة بيت لحم قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بأنه عقاب جماعي. ردا على إغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعدة الطلاب على استدراك المادة الفائتة، وهذا أصبح واحدا من الرموز القليلة من العصيان المدني.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nفي 21 ديسمبر 1995، انسحبت القوات الإسرائيلية من بيت لحم، وبعد ثلاثة أيام أصبحت المدينة تحت إدارة السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية وسيطرتُها العسكرية الكاملة بناءً على الاتفاق الانتقالي بشأن الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة في عام 1995. وأصبحت المدينة مُنذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة بيت لحم، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو.\nخلال الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، في 2000-2001، تضررت بشدة البنية التحتية في بيت لحم والسياحة. وفي عام 2002، كانت المدينة منطقة القتال الرئيسية في عملية الدرع الواقي، عملية عسكرية كبرى من جانب الجيش الإسرائيلي.\nخلال العملية، قام الجيش الإسرائيلي بمُحاصرة كنيسة المهد، حيث كان حوالي 200 مسلح فلسطيني لجأوا إلى الكنيسة. واستمر الحصار لمدة 39 يومًا وقتلوا تسعة من المسلحين ورجل كنيسي. انتهى الحصار باتفاق على نفي 13 من المسلحين المطلوبين إلى دول أوروبية مختلفة وموريتانيا.\n\nالأهمية الدينية\nلبيت لحم أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). في بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وذلك فوق كهف أو مغارة، والتي يعتقد أنها الإسطبل الذي ولد فيه يسوع. يعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداب آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قد قضى ثلاثين عاما من حياته فيه يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\n\nيفهم من هذا النص أن يوسف ومريم لم يجدا لهما مكانا في منزل كمهام المعروف في بيت لحم فنزلا في مغارة تأوي اليها البهائم ويروي متى الإنجيلي أنه بعد ولادة يسوع، قام بعض المجوس من الشرق بزيارة هيرودس للاستعلام عن مكان «الشخص الذي ولد ملكا لليهود»، لأنهم رأوا نجمه في الشرق. كان هيرودس، ملك اليهود، قلقًا من احتمال أن يفقد عرشه. قام هيرودس بتجميع رؤساء الكهنة وكتّاب الشعب وسألهم أين وُلد «الممسوح» (المسيح، باليونانية: Ὁ Χριστός، هو كريستوس). أجابوا: في بيت لحم، حيث تنبا ميخا قبل سبعمئة وخمسين عاما عن قدومه «وانت يا بيت لحم ارض يهوذا لست الصغرى بین روساء يهوذا لأن منك يخرج مدبر يرعی شعبي اسرائيل». أرسل هيرودس المجوس إلى بيت لحم، وأمرهم بالبحث عن الطفل، وبعد أن يعثروا عليه، «أن يخبروه عنه، حتى يذهب هو أيضاً ليعبده». وقدم المجوس إلى بيت لحم وقدّموا للمولود هدايا من ذهب ولبان ومر. وانصرفوا من طريق آخر مارین بحقل الرعاة شرقا كي لا يقابلوا هيرودس الذي ظنوا فيه شرا بعد أن تم تحذيرهم في حلم بعدم إبلاغ هيرودس. وبالمثل، تم تحذير يوسف في حلم أن هيرودس كان يعتزم قتل يسوع، لذلك فر هو وعائلته إلى مصر. عندما أدرك هيرودس أنه قد خدع، أصدر أوامر بقتل جميع الأولاد الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سنتين في بيت لحم والمناطق المجاورة لها من ابن عامين فما دون لعله يقتل الطفل المولود بينهم. بقي يوسف وعائلته في مصر حتى وفاة هيرودس، ثم انتقلوا إلى الناصرة في الجليل لتجنب العيش تحت حكم أرخيلاوس ابن هيرودس.\nتُذكر رواية الميلاد في إنجيلي متى ولوقا، وتغدوا الرواية في إنجيل لوقا أكثر تفصيلاً؛ عناصر الرواية الإنجيلية للميلاد مفادها أن مريم قد ظهر لها جبرائيل مرسلاً من قبل الله وأخبرها أنها ستحبل بقوّة الروح القدس بطفل «يكون عظيمًا وابن العلي يدعى، ولن يكون لملكه نهاية»،لوقا 1/32] وعندما اضطرب يوسف النجار خطيب مريم من روايتها ظهر له الملاك أيضًا في الحلم تصديقًا لرواية مريم وتشجيعًا له، ويتفق متى ولوقا أن الميلاد قد تمّ في بيت لحم مدينة النبي داود لا في مدينة الناصرة حيث كانا يعيشان وحيث تمت البشارة، يعود ذلك تتميمًا للنبؤات السابقة حول مكان الميلاد سيّما نبؤة النبي ميخا، أما السبب المباشر فهو طلب أغسطس قيصر إحصاء سكان الإمبراطورية الرومانية تمهيدًا لدفع الضرائب، ولذلك سافر يوسف مع مريم وكان حينها قد ضمها إلى بيته كزوجته دون أن تنشأ بينهما علاقة زوجية، وعند وصولهما إلى بيت لحم لم يجدا مكانًا للإقامة في فندق أو نزل وحان وقت وضع مريم، فبحسب إنجيل لوقا وضعت طفلها في مذود ولفته بقماط.لوقا 2/7] وإن ذكر المذود هو الدافع الأساسي للاعتقاد بوجود المغارة أو الحظيرة، لأن الحظائر عادة كانت عبارة عن كهوف أما المذود فهو مكان وضع علف الحيوانات، وكان أوريجانوس قد أثبت المغارة وقال أنه نقل القصة عن تقاليد أقدم.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيت لحم 31°43′0″N 35°12′0″E وعلى ارتفاع حوالي 775 متر (2,543 قدم) فوق مستوى سطح البحر، 30 مترا (98 قدم) أعلى من القدس. بيت لحم وتقع في الجزء الجنوبي من جبال الخليل.\nتقع المدينة على بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس، 73 كيلومترًا (45 ميل) شمال شرق قطاع غزة والبحر المتوسط، و 75 كيلومترًا (47 ميل) إلى الغرب من عمان عاصمة الأردن، و 59 كيلومترًا (37 ميل) إلى الجنوب الشرقي من تل أبيب وعلى بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) إلى الجنوب من القدس.\n\nمن المدن والبلدات القريبة تشمل بيت صفافا والقدس في الشمال، وبيت جالا إلى الشمال الغربي، حوسان إلى الغرب، الخضر وأرطاس إلى الجنوب الغربي، وبيت ساحور إلى الشرق. وتقع بيت جالا، وبيت ساحور تُشكل تجمع مع بيت لحم وتقع مخيمات اللاجئين عايدة ومخيم بيت جبرين داخل حدود المدينة.\nتقع البلدة القديمة في وسط المدينة، وتتألف من ثمانية أرباع سكنية (أحياء)، المبنية بأسلوب الفسيفساء التي تشكل المنطقة المحيطة ساحة كنيسة المهد. الأرباع تضمُ المسيحيين وربع واحد فقط يضمُ مسلمين. سُميت معظم الأحياء المسيحية حسب أسماء عشائر الغساسنة العربية التي استقرت هُناك. وشكل المغتربين العرب المسيحيين حي القواوسة الذين أتوا من تقوع في القرن الثامن عشر. هُناك أيضًا ربع السريانية يقع خارج البلدة القديمة، تعود أصول سكانها من مديات وماسارتي «وMa'asarte» في تركيا. يبلغ عدد سُكان البلدة القديمة 5,000 نسمة.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nمناطق المدينة\nتعتبر البلدة القديمة في بيت لحم أهم مناطقها على الإطلاق لوجود أهم المعالم الدينية المسيحية فيها، وهي تتوسط المدينة وشوارعها. من أهم تلك الشوارع: طريق الخليل، الشارع الجديد، شارع بيت ساحور، شارع بولس السادس، شارع السينما، شارع الفرير، شارع جمال عبد الناصر.\nالمخيمات\n\nتضم منطقة بيت لحم ثلاثة مخيمات رئيسية هي مخيم عايدة، مخيم بيت جبرين، ومخيم الدهيشة. ومثلها مثل باقي مخيمات الضفة الغربية، فقد تأسست فوق قطعة من الأرض استأجرتها الأونروا من الحكومة الأردنية.\n\nمخيم عايدة: تأسس عام 1950 بين مدينتي بيت لحم وبيت جالا. ويمتد فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0,71 كيلومتر مربع لم تنم بشكل كاف مع نمو مجتمع اللاجئين. ولذلك، فإن المخيم يعاني من مشاكل اكتظاظ شديدة.\nمخيم بيت جبرين: تأسس عام 1950 في قلب مدينة بيت لحم. وهو يعد أصغر مخيم للاجئين في الضفة الغربية حيث تبلغ مساحته 0.02 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وغالبا ما يطلق على المخيم أيضا اسم مخيم عزة.\nمخيم الدهيشة: تأسس عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.31 كيلومتر مربع ضمن حدود بلدية بيت لحم.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في بيت لحم مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتر.\n\nالسكان\nوفقًا لسجلات الضرائب العثمانية، شكل المسيحيون نسبة 60% من السكان في القرن السادس عشر، وفي منتصف القرن 16 أصبحت أعداد المسلمين والمسيحيين متساوية. لم يكن هناك مسلمون في نهاية القرن، وبلغ عدد سكانها 287 (سجل الذكور البالغين دافعي الضرائب). وطلب آنذاك من المسيحيين وغير المسلمين دفع ضريبة الجزية في جميع أنحاء الدولة العثمانية. في عام 1867، وصف زائر أمريكي المدينة الذي بلغ عدد سكانها 3,000 إلى 4,000 منهم 100 يتبعون البروتستانتية و 300 من المسلمين و«ما تبقى ينتمون إلى الكنائس اللاتينية واليونانية مع نسبة قليلة من الأرمن»  ووفقًا لتقرير آخر من نفس العام بلغ عدد السكان المسيحيين 3000، وبالإضافة إلى 50 من المسلمين.\nفي عام 1948، شكلت المسيحية نسبة 85% من التركيبة السُكانية للمدينة معظمها من الطوائف اليونانية الأرثوذكسية والكاثوليكية، أما نسبة المسلمين بلغت 13% مسلم سني.\nوفقًا للإحصائيات الإسرائيلية عام 1967، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 14,439 نسمة منهم 7,790 نسمة مسلمين ما نسبته 53,9% بينما بلغ عدد المسيحيين 6,231 نسمة ما يعادل 46,1% من سكان بيت لحم.\nوفقًا لتعداد الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء عام 1997، فقد بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 21,670 نسمة، بما في ذلك 6,570 لاجئ وهو ما يمثل 30.3% من سكان المدينة. وفي عام 1997، أما التوزيع العمري السكاني لفترات عُمرية مختلفة كالتالي: 27,4% تحت سن عشرة سنوات و 20% 10-19 سنة و 17.3% 20-29 سنة، 17.7% 30-44 سنة و 12.1% 45-64 سنة و 5.3% فوق سن 65 عامًا. بلغ عدد الذكور 11,079 أما عدد الإناث 10,594.\nوفقا لتقديرات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 29,930 نسمة في مُنتصف عام 2006. ومع ذلك، في تعداد 2007 كشف عن وجود 25,266 نسمة منهم 12,753 ذكورًا و 12,513 من الإناث. و 6,709 وحدة سكنية منها 5,211 كانت للأُسر. أما مُتوسط عدد أفراد الأسر 4,8.\nبحلول عام 2005، كانت نسبة السكان المسيحيين تراجعت بشكل كبير، إلى حوالي 40% من 50%. المسجد الوحيد في المدينة القديمة هو مسجد عمر، ويقع في ساحة كنيسة المهد.\n\nالدين\nيدعى الكثير من سكان بيت لحم المسيحيين أنهم ينحدرون من العشائر المسيحية العربية التي قدمت من شبه الجزيرة العربية، أكبر هذه العشائر في المدينة: الفراحية ونجاجرة. العشائر السابقة الذكر قد تنحدرُ من الغساسنة الذين هاجروا من اليمن إلى منطقة وادي موسى في الوقت الحاضر الأردن في حين أن النجاجرة تنحدر من العرب في نجران في جنوب الحجاز. عشيرة عريقة أخرى في المدينة هي عناترة وتنحدر أصولهم من شبه الجزيرة العربية.\n\nأنخفضت أعداد المسيحيين في المدينة بشكل مُطرد، ويرجع ذلك في المقام الأول إلى الهجرة. انخفاض معدل مواليد المسيحيين يمثل أيضًا سببًا للانخفاض. في عام 1947، بلغت نسبة المسيحيين حوالي 85%، ولكن بحلول عام 1998 انخفضت النسبة إلى 40%. في عام 2005، وضح رئيس بلدية بيت لحم فيكتور بطارسة أن \"نتيجة للتوتر سواء الجسدي أو النفسي والحالة الاقتصادية السيئة، كثير من الناس يهاجرون، سواء مسيحيين أو مسلمين، لكن الهجرة أكثر أنتشارًا بين المسيحيين، لأنهم بالفعل هم أقلية.\nأدت اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية إلى أنخفاض ناتج القطاع السياحي والتي أثرت على الأقلية المسيحية وعلى أصحاب الفنادق في بيت لحم الذين يقدمون خدمات المُلبية لإحتياجات السياج الأجانب. أشير تحليل إحصائي لهجرة المسيحيين من المدينة لانعدام الفرص الاقتصادية والتعليمية، خصوصًا الطبقة الوسطى والمتعلمة منهم. مُنذ اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثانية، غادر 10% من السكان المسيحيين المدينة.\nذكرت الصحيفة الإسرائيلية جيروزليم بوست ان «تقلص أعداد الطوائف المسيحية الفلسطينية في الأراضي المقدسة وبشكل خاص في بيت لحم جاء كنتيجة مباشرة بسبب انتمائها إلى الطبقة المتوسطة والعليا». يذكر أن المسيحيين لديهم صورة عامة كنخبة متعلمة وذات امتيازات طبقية، وكذلك عدم لجوئهم إلى العنف، مما يجعلهم أكثر عرضة للتعرض لأعمال عنف. يُذكر أن بسبب الهجرة المسيحية يتواجد غالبية مسيحيين بيت لحم خارج العالم العربي بشكل خاص في أمريكا اللاتينية التي تضم نصف مليون فلسطيني في أمريكا اللاتينية والوسطى حيث أن 80 إلى 85% منهم هم من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين. وتضم التشيلي أكبر جالية فلسطينية مسيحية في العالم خارج منطقة فلسطين حيث يصل أعدادهم إلى 350,000 وتعود أصول غالبيتهم إلى بيت لحم وبيت جالا وبيت ساحور ويعتبرون من الاقليات الناجحة جدًا فغالبيتهم ينتمون إلى الطبقة العليا والوسطى ومن المتعلمون كما وقد برز عدد منهم في السياسة والاقتصاد والثقافة.\nفي عام 2006، ووفقًا للاستطلاع الذي أجراهُ المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث والحوار الثقافي في المدينة أن 90% من المسيحيين قالوا أن لديهم أصدقاء مسلمين، ووافق 73,3% منهم على أن السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية تُعامل التراث المسيحي في المدينة باحترام ونسب 78% منهم سبب هجرة المسيحيين إلى القيود الإسرائيلية التي تفرُضها على السفر.\nإن مدينة بيت لحم هي من أقدس المواقع المسيحية في العالم كونها المدينة التي فيها وُلِدَ يسوع المسيح، وبسبب قدسية مدينة بيت لحم لدى العالم المسيحي تتواجد في المدينة عدد كبير من الكنائس والأديرة فضلًا عن المواقع المسيحية المقدسة، بالإضافة إلى المؤسسات المسيحيّة المختلفة من مدراس وجامعة كاثوليكية ومستشفيات شتى، وكونها مدينة ميلاد يسوع تُحظى المدينة بشعبية واسعة وترتبط بعيد الميلاد. كانت كنيسة المهد هي الأولى بين الكنائس الثلاث التي بناها الإمبراطور قسطنطين في مطلع القرن الرابع الميلادي حين أصبحت المسيحية ديانة الدولة الرسمية وكان ذلك استجابة لطلب الأسقف ماكاريوس في المجمع المسكوني الأول في نيقيه عام 325 للميلاد. دخلت كنيسة المهد سنة 2012 قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، كنيسة المهد هي أول موقع فلسطيني يدرج ضمن لائحة التراث العالمي لمنظمة اليونيسكو. الجدول الآتي بأهم كنائس المدينة:\n\nمن أهم كنائس المدينة\n\nالاقتصاد\nتمتازُ المدينة بنشاطها في الصناعة وخاصةً الصناعة السياحية مثل صناعة الصدف والمسابح والصلبان. يُعتبر التسوق مصدر جذب رئيسي للسياح، وخصوصًا خلال موسم عيد الميلاد. مع كثرة المحلات في الشوارع الرئيسية للمدينة والأسواق القديمة التي تبيع المشغولات اليدوية الفلسطينية والتوابل والمجوهرات والحلويات الشرقية مثل البقلاوة. ويشترون السياح تحف خشب الزيتون  وهو أكثر عثنصر مُباع للسياح الذين يزورون بيت لحم. والحرف الدينية وتشمل الحلي المصنوعة يدويًا مثل عرق اللؤلؤ والصناديق والصلبان. الصناعات الأخرى هي الحجر والرخام والمنسوجات والأثاث والمفروشات. ويوجد أيضًا في المدينة مصانع لإنتاج مواد الدهان والبلاستيك والمطاط الصناعي والمستحضرات الصيدلانية ومواد البناء والمنتجات الغذائية والمعجنات والحلويات بشكل رئيسي.\nأُنشئت أول غرفة تجارية صناعية زراعية في مدينة بيت لحم في أوائل الخمسينات حيث أُنتخب أول مجلس إدارة لها بتاريخ 16 أبريل 1952. في 30 أغسطس 1965، تم انتخاب مجلس إدارة جديد. ومع قرب البدء باحتفالات الألفية الثانية ودخول المحافظة في مرحلة جديدة من البناء والأعمار، اصدر معالي وزير الاقتصاد والتجارة قرارًا بتعيين مجلس الإدارة الحالي الذي يضمُ نُخبة من رجال الأعمال والاقتصاديين لإدارة شؤون الغرفة. وتندرج غرفة تجارة وصناعة محافظة بيت لحم تحت مظلة اتحاد الغرف التجارية والصناعية والزراعية الفلسطينية ومقره القدس، ويضم خمسة عشرة غرفة في فلسطين.\nفي عام 2008، استضافات مدينة بيت لحم أكبر مؤتمر اقتصادي على الإطلاق في الأراضي الفلسطينية. وقد بادر به رئيس الوزراء الفلسطيني ووزير المالية السابق سلام فياض في إقناع أكثر من 1,000 من رجال الأعمال والمصرفيين والمسؤولين الحكوميين من جميع أنحاء الشرق الأوسط للاستثمار أموالهم في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة. تم تأمين ما مجموعه 1,4 مليار دولار أمريكي من أجل الاستثمارات التجارية في الأراضي الفلسطينية.\nنبيذ كريمزان، الذي تُؤسس في عام 1885، هو مصنع يختص بإنتاج الخمرة ويديره الرهبان في دير كريمزان. وتزرع العنب بشكل رئيسي في منطقة الخضر. في عام 2007، كان إنتاج الدير من النبيذ حوالي 700,000 لترًا سنويًا.\n\nالعمارة والسياحة\nيُعد المعمار مرقص نصار أول مهندس معماري بشكل رسمي في بيت لحم. ويسود المدينة طرازان معماريان مختلفان: الطراز القديم السائد في البلدة القديمة حيث القباب والجدران السميكة المبنية من الحجر الكلسي والشبابيك والأبواب على شكل أقواس، والمباني فيها ملتصقة ببعضها ومتراصة وشوارعها ضيقة ومقسمة إلى حارات لكي يسهل الدفاع عنها. أما الطراز الثاني فهو الطراز الحديث السائد في مناطق السكن الجديدة حيث البيوت الحديثة المستقلة أو العمارات المكونة من طبقات.\nويطوق المدينة الآن مجموعة من المستوطنات التي يطلق عليها مجموعة (غوش عتسيون) ووصل عدد المستوطنات حولها عام 1985 إلى 16 مستوطنة وتشكل مستوطنة افرات مركزها وأكبرها، ويخطط لإقامة 9 مستوطنات حتى عام 2010.\nكونها المدينة التي شهدت ميلاد يسوع، تحمل مدينة بيت لحم معنى خاصاً في قلوب المسيحيين من كافة أرجاء العالم، وعلى الرغم من صغرها النسبي مساحةً وسكانًا، لدى بيت لحم وجوارها العديد من المواقع التي تجلب كافة أنواع الزوار والسواح. في قلب المدينة تقع كنيسة المهد، وداخل الكنيسة توجد مغارة المهد حيث ولد يسوع. منذ قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية في العام 1994 شهدت مدينة بيت لحم تطورًا غير مسبوق، حيث انتشرت أعمال الإعمار والترميم في كافة مواقع المدينة، وحيث شيدت العديد من المرافق السياحية مثل الفنادق والمطاعم ومحلات بيع التحف والمنتجات الحرفية، وكافة هذه المرافق على أتم الاستعداد لتوفير كافة متطلبات الزوار والسياح.\nلقد رممت بلدة بيت لحم القديمة بالكامل وبشكل جميل، مما جعل من السير في كافة أرجائها ممتعًا ومفيدًا على الصعيد المعرفي كذلك. كما من السهل ملاحظة الوتيرة العالية التي تسيير فيها المراكز الثقافية في بيت لحم وما حولها فعالياتها الثقافية على مدار العام، لذا ننصحكم بزيارة مركز الدار الثقافي الموجود في مركز بيت لحم الدولي (دار الندوة)، ومركز بيت لحم للسلام والذي يطل على ساحة المهد حيث يحتوي المركز على مركز للسياح،

تقليدية فضلًا عن مطاعم تقدم وجبات من المطبخ الفرنسي والإيطالي والصيني. وبالقرب من بيت لحم تقع بلدتي بيت ساحور وبيت جالا، وكلاهما لديها مواقع تراثية ومقدسة مسيحية.\n\nالثقافة\nلقد رُممت بلدة بيت لحم القديمة بالكامل وبشكل جميل، مما جعل من السير في كافة أرجائها مُمتعًا ومفيدًا على الصعيد المعرفي كذلك. كما من السهل ملاحظة الوتيرة العالية التي تسيير فيها المراكز الثقافية في بيت لحم وما حولها

مُنتظمة.\n تطريز \nعُرف تطريز نساء بيت لحم بفضل ملابس الزفاف الخاصة بهم. التطريز في بيت لحم كان مشهورًا بفضل «التأثير الكلي والقوي للألوان والتألق اللامع». أما فساتين الأقلُ رسميةً فصُنعت من قماش نيلي مع معطف بلا أكمام من الصوف المنسوج محليًا التي تُلبس فوق الفساتين. تمتازُ الفساتين للمُناسبات الخاصة بأنها مصنوعة من الحرير المُقلم مع أكمام مُجنحه مع سترة قصيرة «تقصيرة» والمعروفة باسم سترة بيت لحم. التقصيرة مُصنعة من المخمل أو الجوخ، وعادة تكون مع تطريز كثيف.\nالتطريز التحريري لمنطقة بيت لحم يجمع بين الفضة والذهب وخيوط الحرير لتزيين واجهة وجوانب وأكمام ثياب الزفاف التقليدية، وحيث تملأ هذه التصماميم المُميزة بقطب وأشكال فنية باستخدام الخيطان الحريرية بهية الألوان، حيث حاول البعض المقاربة بين هذه التصاميم وتصاميم الزخارف والأزياء الكنسية، والزينة الرسمية والأوسمة للملابس العسكرية العثمانية والبريطانية القديمة.\n نحت عرق اللؤلؤ\nيعود فن نحت عرق اللؤلؤ في بيت لحم إلى القرن الخامس عشر عندما أُدخل من قبل رهبان فرنسيسكان من إيطاليا. وأزداد الطلب على هذه الأصناف بسبب زيادة أعداد الحجاج المسيحيين، ووفرت وظائف للنساء. وقد لاحظ ريتشارد بوكوك هذه الصناعة، الذي زار بيت لحم في عام 1727.\n المراكز الثقافية والمتاحف \n\nبيت لحم هي موطن لمركز التراث الفلسطيني، الذي أُنشئ في عام 1991.

مخيم عايدة للاجئين من جهة، وبلدية القدس من جهة أخرى. مُعظم المداخل والمخارج من التجمعات السكنية في بيت لحم إلى بقية الضفة الغربية تخضع حاليًا لنقاط التفتيش الإسرائيلية وحواجز الطرق. يختلفُ مُستوى الوصول بناءً توجيهات الأمن الإسرائيلية. وينظمُ السفر لسكان بيت لحم الفلسطينيين من الضفة الغربية إلى القدس عن طريق نظام تصريح. ويحظر على المواطنين الإسرائيليين من دخول بيت لحم والاقتراب من بركة السلطان سليمان القانوني.\n\nالملاعب الرياضية\nيوجد في محافظة بيت لحم عدة أندية رياضية سواء على مستوى كرة القدم أو كرة السلة، أو رياضات أخرى مثل الركبي. من أهم هذه الاندية: نادي الخضر، نادي ترجي وادي النيص، نادي جورة الشمعة، النادي الأرثوذكسي الثقافي العربي بيت ساحور، نادي وادي فوكين، نادي مراح معلا، نادي دلاسال بيت لحم، نادي زعترة، نادي بيت فجار، نادي التعامرة. ويوجد في المحافظة عدة ملاعب بلدية صغيرة، كملعب بيت جالا، وملعب بيت ساحور، وملعب مخيم الدهيشة.\n\nالحكومة المحلية\nأول انتخابات بلدية عُقدت في بيت لحم كانت عام 1876، قاموا المخاتير من أرباع مدينة بيت لحم القديمة (باستثناء الربع السريانية) باتخاذ قرار لانتخاب المجالس المحلية من سبعة أعضاء وذلك لتمثيل كل عشيرة في المدينة. وأنشئ قانون أساسي بحيث إذا حصل شخصًا كاثوليكي على منصب رئيس البلدية يُشرط بأن يكون ونائبه تابع للأرثوذكسية اليونانية.\nحُكم البريطانيين والأردنيون بيت لحم، وسُمح للربع السريانية في المشاركة في الانتخابات وكذلك البدو واللاجئين الفلسطينيين، ومن ثم التصديق على كمية أعضاء البلدية في المجلس إلى 11. في عام 1976، أقر تعديلًا الذي يسمح للنساء بالمشاركة في عمل التصويت وأن يصبحوا أعضاء في المجلس وفيما بعد تم رفع سن الانتخاب من 21 إلى 25.\nاليوم، يتكون مجلس بلدية بيت لحم من 15 عضوًا منتخبًا، بما في ذلك رئيس البلدية ونائب رئيس البلدية. وسيوضع نظام خاص يتطلب أن يكون رئيس البلدية وغالبية المجلس البلدي مسيحيًا، بينما باقي المقاعد تعتبر مفتوحة لأي شخص ولا تقتصر على أي دين.\nهُناك عدة فروع للأحزاب السياسية في المجلس، بما في ذلك حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني فتح، الإسلاميين، الشيوعيين، تُسيطر حركة فتح تحديدا والفصائل اليسارية في منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مثل الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين وحزب الشعب الفلسطيني عادة على المقاعد المحجوزة. بينما اكتسبت فتح على أغلبية المقاعد المفتوحة في انتخابات البلدية الفلسطينية 2012.\n\nرؤساء البلديات\nمن المُجبر أن يكون رئيس البلدية ونائبه مسيحيين.\n\nالمحافل الدولية والمحلية\nتعتبر مدينة بيت لحم من أهم المدن الفلسطينية لإقامة المؤتمرات والمحافل الدولية، وقد شهدت العديد من الاحتفالات والمناسبات منها استقبال الرئيس الأمريكي السابق جورج دبليو بوش أثناء زيارته لكنيسة المهد، إضافة إلى استضافتها للمؤتمر الاقتصادي العربي واستضافتها لمؤتمر حركة التحرير الوطني الفلسطيني (فتح) السادس مؤخراً، فهي تحتوي على قصر المؤتمرات.\nأحتفالات عيد الميلاد\nتقام طقوس عيد الميلاد في بيت لحم على ثلاثة تواريخ مختلفة: تحتفل الطوائف الكاثوليكية والبروتستانتية بتاريخ 25 ديسمبر، وأما الكنيسة اليونانية والسريانية والمسيحيين الأقباط فيحتفلون بتاريخ 6 يناير والمسيحيين الأرمن الأرثوذكس في 19 يناير. تمرُ معظم مواكب عيد الميلاد عبر ساحة كنيسة المهد، في ساحة الخارجية لكنيسة المهد.\n\tمهرجان أرطاس للخس\nمنذ إطلاقه في العام 1994، مهرجان الخس السنوي والذي ينظم في قرية أرطاس الجميلة، جنوب مدينة بيت لحم وبالقرب من برك سليمان، يجمع السكان المحليين مع الزائرين الأجانب في مهرجان مليء بالمرح احتفاءً وتقديرًا للفلاح الفلسطيني. المهرجان الذي ينظمه مركز إرطاس للفلكلور يمثل تجربة مميزة تمكن الزائر من التفاعل مع السكان الأصليين للمنطقة والتمتع بحس ضيافة الفلسطينيين وميراثهم الثقافي.\nمهرجان زيت الزيتون\nفي تشرين الثاني من كل عام تزهو مدينة بيت لحم بأصواتها وأطعامها ورائحتها التقليدية، حيث يجتمع السكان المحليون والزائزون ليحتفلوا بموسم الزيتون، تعدد الفعاليات من العروض الموسيقية التي تقدمها الفرق المحلية إلى عرض الرقص التقليدي التي تقدمها فرقة إرطاس للرقص الشعبي، تمتلئ أرجاء المهرجان

      "content": "## Overview\nBethlehem (Arabic: بيت لحم, Beit Lahm, Hebrew: בית לחם Beit Lechem) is a small city located some 10 km (6 miles) south of the Old City of Jerusalem within the West Bank, in an \"Area A\" zone administered by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n## History\nThe \"little town\" of Bethlehem, mentioned in Christmas carols, attracts pilgrims worldwide on account of its description in the New Testament (and particularly the Gospels) as the Biblical birthplace of Jesus, whom Christians believe to be Messiah and Son of God. The Church of the Nativity, one of the oldest churches in the world, is the focus of Christian veneration within the city. Modern textual analysis has almost universally drawn the conclusion that Nazareth, the place where Jesus spent most of his later life and the home town of Joseph and Mary was probably his actual birthplace, but that has not lessened the draw of this city for Christian pilgrims.\nBethlehem is also revered by Jews and Muslims as the birthplace and home town of David, Biblical prophet and King of Israel, as well as the traditional site of Rachel's Tomb (on the outskirts of the town).\nAlthough also home to many Muslims, Bethlehem remains home to one of the largest Arab Christian communities in the Middle East (despite significant emigration which has resulted in a growing Muslim majority) and one of the chief cultural and tourism drawcards for the Palestinian community. The Bethlehem agglomeration also includes the small towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour, the latter also having Biblical significance.\nBuilding up to the Millennium in the year 2000, Bethlehem underwent a massive largely foreign-funded project called Bethlehem 2000 in hopes of turning Bethlehem into a major tourist destination comparable to destinations such as Jerusalem or Tel Aviv in tourism infrastructure. Unfortunately, a year later, the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation occurred and the ensuing violence, including a standoff between Palestinian fighters holed up in the Church of the Nativity and Israeli troops, scuttled these tourism efforts. Although tension remains high in Israeli-Palestinian relations, violence is a thing of the past in Bethlehem and many in Bethlehem hope to continue on where Bethlehem 2000 started them off.\nThis article also covers nearby towns, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\n## Orientation\nA long snake of town, the main thoroughfare of Bethlehem is Manger Street which stretches from Rachel's Tomb (and the road to Jerusalem) all the way to Manger Square, the focal point of the city. Manger Square is flanked by the Church of the Nativity on one side and the Mosque of Omar on the other. The Old Town and the souq (market), which are best navigated on foot, stretch up the hill from Manger Square.\nThe name means \"The House of Bread\" in Hebrew, and \"The House of Meat\" in Arabic. However, it seems likely that both meanings have been retrofitted onto what was originally the House of Lachma, the Mesopotamian god of fertility. The area has been settled since 5,000 BC and there is some evidence that the town is mentioned in the Egyptian Amarna letters (1400 BC). The Old Testament Book of Ruth (c. 1150 BC) has the first certain reference to Bethlehem; it tells the story of Naomi, who left Bethlehem during a famine, and later returned with her daughter-in-law Ruth. Still, Bethlehem remained a small town in the shadow of mighty Jerusalem, and according to most estimates, it had some 300 to 1000 inhabitants at the time of the event that gave Bethlehem its fame, namely the birth of Jesus.\nSomewhat surprisingly, aside from noting that the Nativity indeed took place there, the New Testament virtually ignores Bethlehem. And things didn't change immediately afterwards: wrecked during the Bar-Kochba revolt (132-135 AD), the Romans set up a shrine to Adonis on the site of the Nativity. Only in 326 was the first Christian church constructed, when Helen, the mother of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, visited Bethlehem. Afterwards, it grew slowly but steadily, achieving its pinnacle as a strong fortified city during the Crusader era, but the Ottomans razed the fortifications and reduced Bethlehem back into the village it was 2000 years earlier.\nThe setback proved only temporary, and despite the turbulence of the 20th century the town has (as of 2000) grown to an estimated 184,000 inhabitants. On December 21, 1995, Bethlehem became one of the areas under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. In the city, 41% of the population is Christian, while 59% is Muslim. Christians used to be a large majority, but their numbers have declined throughout the 20th century. Although Arabic is the language of Bethlehem's inhabitants, English, French and other languages are widely spoken and understood by many people in Bethlehem.\nAlthough Bethlehem is a Palestinian town, it is also tourist-oriented. Because of Bethlehem's immense potential as a tourism magnet, the Palestinian Authority maintains a constant tourist police presence in the city. For example, if there is combat in Southern Israel and the Gaza Strip, this does not mean that trips to other Palestinian cities such as Bethlehem are unsafe. Bethlehem is a safe place for tourists to visit, and tourist numbers are increasing to this hidden gem of the Holy Land.\n\n## Local information\nBethlehem municipal\n\n## Get in\nMost travellers arrive via Jerusalem. Since Bethlehem is administered by the Palestinian Authority, there are security checks conducted by the Israeli military on access roads. When coming via the highway there are no barriers when going to Bethlehem, however on the other side there is 31.7053535.168831 highway 60 checkpoint on the road to Jerusalem. For instance, in case you're traveling by bus, soldiers will board to check the passengers' identity documents. On the local road north of Bethlehem, there's a bigger checkpoint (\"Rachel's Crossing\"/Checkpoint 300). To cross, one shows their passport to an Israeli soldier, places his/her bags into an x-ray machine and then walks through a metal detector, much like airport security. As with all areas under Palestinian Authority control, Israeli law forbids Israeli citizens to enter unless they receive approval from the Israeli Civil Administration. Tourists are free to enter and exit Bethlehem and go back to Jerusalem as many times as they would like without any restrictions. Make sure you bring your passport with your Israeli-issued tourist visa to enter and exit the Palestinian areas.\n\n## By car\nBe careful when using a hired car, as some/many rental companies in Israel make it clear that the car has to be used, and remain, on Israeli soil.\n\n## By bus\nFrom Jerusalem's HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate (\"Bab el-'Amoud\") bus 231 runs from here into Bethlehem (via Beit Jala). Even though the bus stop sign does not list it, bus 231 can also be boarded at the bus stop out of the Jaffa Gate and down the road a little – the bus comes from the tunnel. The average trip length is 30 min and costs ₪6.80. The 31.7119735.1992 last stop from Jerusalem in Bethlehem is along Hebron Road about 20 min walk from the Church of the Nativity away. Also, shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave from nearby Damascus Gate and manage the trip in 20 min.\nPalestinian bus 234 also leaves from HaNeviim bus station near Damascus Gate. It costs ₪4.70 and runs directly to the 31.72445535.2038233 Jerusalem-Bethlehem Checkpoint (Checkpoint 300) and back. From the checkpoint, you can either walk half an hour or take a taxi to the center of Bethlehem (₪10–25), which is about 3 km away. Egged bus 163 also goes here from the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, halting for instance at the Jaffa Gate bus stop. Travel time from Jaffa Gate is 30 min, price is ₪5.90.\nFrom Ramallah many shared taxis (sherut/servees) leave for Bethlehem. It is just a little pain to figure out the right bus station out of the (at least) four ones in Ramallah. The trip takes about an hour, goes all the way around Jerusalem and costs ₪20.\nThe trip from Hebron with the final stop at the very bottom floor of the 31.70625535.2052384 Bethlehem bus station (only shared taxis (sherut)) will deliver you for less than ₪10.\nFrom Jericho take a shared taxis (sherut/servees) for ₪12 to 31.76409335.2811625 Al Ezariya (Junction), a town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the driver where to get off to get to Bethlehem or take the GPS pointer as orientation. From the junction take another shared taxis to Bethlehem bus station (₪5-10).\n\n## On foot\nDevoted pilgrims often prefer to walk (and in happier times there has been a large procession at Christmas), at a brisk pace the trip is doable in 2 hr but there are plenty of ups and downs along the way and the summer heat is fearsome.\n\n## Get around\nBut Bethlehem is a small city, so taxi rides are extremely cheap; no trip within Bethlehem city should cost more than ₪20. To travel from Bethlehem to its neighboring suburbs of Beit Sahour or Beit Jala, it should be no more than ₪25-30. Just make sure, to only take service of the taxi ride and not a guided tour, which will cost you much more.\nTo travel to more distant sites (such as Herodium, any of the surrounding monasteries, or Solomon's Pools), it's advisable to negotiate a price with a taxi driver at the Bethlehem bus station. Many taxi drivers are willing to take you to a site, wait there while you tour a site and then take you back to Bethlehem for a negotiated price. Whenever negotiating a taxi price, always say the lowest price you think would be reasonable for the trip, and bargain with the driver from there. The driver will start as high as he thinks he can charge and bargain down for you. Make sure to agree on a price before going into a taxi.\n\n## See\n31.70430635.2076391 Church of the Nativity (From the last bus stop walk left through Pope Paul VI street until Manger Square. It's all straight, just make sure to take a left at the Lutheran church.). Undoubtedly the top attraction in Bethlehem, a veritable citadel built fortress-like on top of the cave where Jesus was born to Mary. It is one of the oldest churches in the world, and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The first incarnation of the building was erected on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I (the Great) in 330 CE. While the layout largely corresponds to Emperor Justinian's plans from 540 CE (the first building having been destroyed in a 536 riot), the church was first heavily fortified by the Crusaders and then degraded (mostly through neglect) under Mamluk rule. An earthquake in 1834 and a fire in 1869 didn't help. Today, the structure is mostly sound but somewhat dark and gloomy in appearance, only the adjoining Franciscan Church of St Catherine (dated 1881 and the site of the yearly December 24 midnight mass broadcast around the world) being in excellent shape. The alleged site of Jesus' birth is actually in a cave in the church (the original Manger where Jesus was born was a cave, not a shed, as popularly depicted). There is a star marking the exact location of Jesus' birth in the cave. The original Manger with the star marking Jesus' birth site is called the Grotto of the Nativity, and is accessible from inside the church. (The tomb of famed theologian and Bethlehem resident St. Jerome, who spent his life translating the Bible, is also in the cave with the Grotto.) Entrance to the entire complex is free, but in the high season (and especially on Jan 6th) be prepared for massive crowds and hour-long waits for entry into the Grotto. There are usually accredited but dodgy tour-guides waiting at the entrance or inside of the church who offer to give tours to groups/individuals, sometimes allowing you to skip the crowds. Makes sure to agree on a price before taking the tour, and if the promise was to skip the crowds and get into the crotto directly but not possible sometimes, lower the price by at least half. Otherwise do not support them, as it is unfair to the other visitors waiting.\n31.71866835.2018452 Rachel's Tomb (Separated from Bethlehem by the wall). Burial place of the matriarch Rachel, wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph and Benjamin is the second most important historical site in Bethlehem. (Genesis 35:19-20). It is a holy site in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. As a result of the security situation, the Tomb's original structure has been surrounded by an Israeli fortress, barricading it off from Bethlehem. While the original tomb can still be seen in its entirety from within the fortress, access to the tomb is now only possible by vehicle, e.g. by taking the Egged bus that comes from Jerusalem or by hitchhiking the very short way.\n31.70741735.2291573 Shepherds' Fields. \"While shepherds watched their flocks by night...\" - rival locations in the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Sahour claim to be the site of the angel's visitation to the shepherds mentioned in the Gospels.    \n Orthodox Shepherds' Fields.

Three huge Herodian-era stone carved reservoirs capable of holding 160,000 m³ of water. They are located in a pine tree forest about 3 km from Bethlehem in a beautiful hiking area called the Artas Valley. In Artas, there is also the very beautiful Italian Order of the Sisters of Mary of the Garden built the Hortus Conclusus Convent and as well a Palestinian Folklore museum. Artas village also boasts an annual lettuce festival.\n31.7094435.2055567 King David's Wells (Biyar Daoud). King David's Wells in King David street, off Manger Square, are three Great Cisterns excavated in the rock in Ras Eftais, an eastern sector of Bethlehem, marking the site where David's army broke through a Philistine garrison to bring him water; \"Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem\" (2 Sam. 23:15). It is believed by some that under the adjacent Church of St. David is where the King is buried (as opposed to the traditional tomb in Jerusalem). The cisterns were discovered in 1895. The church rested on a vast Necropolis composed of 18 Arcosolia with two to six tombs each. The cemetery was Christian as proved by the inscription. The Catholic Action Club lies on the site of one of the cisterns.\n31.686535.18638 Convent and the Chapel of Hortus Conclusus (In nearby village of Artas). Monastery built in 1901.

Is also good for a stroll and shopping if you haven't seen an Arab city before.\n31.703435.1612511 The Monastery of St. George (Al Khader Church) (In the Al Khader quarter, west of the centre. St. George makes for a convenient stop on the way (back) to Jerusalem. Take bus 231 (the one that came from Jerusalem originally) from Bethlehem centre, and get off at the last stop before the checkpoint towards Jerusalem, basically just before getting onto the highway after leaving Bethlehem/Beit Jala. From there it is less than 1 km west-wards to the Monastery/Church.). St. George was a very important Christian Saint for Orthodox Christians, also called \"Mar Jeriess\" in Arabic. The monastery is said to hold relics from the saint that possess healing powers-especially for mental illness. The monastery was used in the 19th century as a psychiatric facility to treat mental illness by using St George's relics. The site is also venerated in Muslim tradition as the setting for the Muslim prophet Al Khider's teachings. In mid-April or early May (it goes by the Julian calendar), the town (both Muslims and Christians) holds a festival for St. George that is worth seeing.\n31.70535.204212 St. Mary's Syriac Orthodox Church.

The graffiti by famed yet mysterious artist Banksy have drawn worldwide media attention and is definitely worth a look. There are many other artists' works, drawn on the barrier wall dividing Bethlehem from Jerusalem, as well, including a Palestinian version of Guernica, portraits of Leila Khaled, Ahed Tamimi, Razan al-Najjar and many more. To see this, it is possible to hire a taxi where the driver may also guide or to go by foot.

Bethlehem is a perfect place to practice those bargaining skills that you were hoping to try out!!\nIn peaceful times, Bethlehem's traders do a roaring trade in souvenirs for pilgrims to the town. In the current situation, the tour operators prefer to quickly hustle their guided groups in and out of the Nativity Church without allowing them time to look around Manger Square. Often, at the end of the tour, they will take their groups to a pre-selected souvenir shop and charge the owner of the shop a big commission for the sales made to the tour group. That means most smaller souvenir shops here are blessedly free from pilgrims, and also that the smaller shops are in desperate need of business. They remain, however, substantially less aggressive than Jerusalem's sellers. Souvenir shops in Bethlehem are much, much cheaper than in Jerusalem - with the same selection (surprisingly, many Bethlehem souvenir shops even have Jewish themed souvenirs). One must venture out of Manger square to the souvenir shops on Manger Street and also in the market place beside Manger Square past the Mosque of Omar.

Bethlehem is an awesome place to get all your Holy Land souvenirs for much, much cheaper than you would get them in Israel.
