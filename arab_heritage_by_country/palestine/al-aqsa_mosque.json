      "content": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\nDefinition\nThe \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" translates into \"the Farthest Mosque\" in English.\n\nThe Arabic term \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" is the translation of both al-Masjid al-Aqṣā and Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā, which have distinct meanings in Arabic. The former (al-Masjid al-Aqṣā) refers to the Quran's Surah 17 – \"the furthest mosque\" – and thus is used for the whole compound of the Temple Mount, also known as the Haram al-Sharif, while the latter name (Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā) is used for the subject of this article – the silver-domed congregational mosque building. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th-century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif ('Noble Sanctuary') – i.e. the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written. Al-Muqaddasi referred to the southern building (the subject of this article) as Al Mughattâ (\"the covered-part\") and Nasir Khusraw referred to it with the Persian word Pushish (also the \"covered part\", exactly as \"Al Mughatta\") or the Maqsurah (a part-for-the-whole synecdoche).\nThe building is also referred to as (al-)Qibli Mosque or (al-)Qibli Chapel (Muṣallā al-Qiblī), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. \"Qibli\" is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), and the Jordanian government more widely. It is also the official name used by the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has been used by numerous international organizations such as the United States State Department the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (whose role is to act as \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\"), and UNESCO, as well as various scholars and media organizations.\n\nHistory\nPre-construction\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\nIt was once thought that Emperor Justinian's \"Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos\", lit. 'the New Church of the God-Bearer' and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in 543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.\nAnalysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as the 9th century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However, reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount's southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton's excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn't include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682. Its precise location is not known. The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock. The architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate. Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem. The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar Ibn Tahir claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram.\nThere is disagreement as to whether the present al-Aqsa Mosque was originally built by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor, his son al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. Abd al-Malik inaugurated great architectural works on the Temple Mount, including construction of the Dome of the Rock in c. 691. A common Islamic tradition holds that Abd al-Malik simultaneously commissioned the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque. As both were intentionally built on the same axis, Grabar comments that the two structures form \"part of an architecturally thought-out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building\", the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, respectively. Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.\nThe earliest source indicating al-Walid's work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papryi. These contain the letters between al-Walid's governor of Egypt in December 708–June 711 and a government official in Upper Egypt which discuss the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the \"Mosque of Jerusalem\". The referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction. Several 10th and 13th-century historians credit al-Walid for founding the mosque, though the historian Amikam Elad doubts their reliability on the matter. In 713–714, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt by al-Walid's order. He had gold from the Dome of the Rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations. He is credited by the early 15th-century historian al-Qalqashandi for covering the mosque's walls with mosaics. Grabar notes that the Umayyad-era mosque was adorned with mosaics, marble, and \"remarkable crafted and painted woodwork\". The latter are preserved partly in the Palestine Archaeological Museum and partly in the Islamic Museum.\nEstimates of the size of the Umayyad-built mosque by architectural historians range from 112 by 39 meters (367 ft × 128 ft) to 114.6 by 69.2 meters (376 ft × 227 ft). The building was rectangular. In the assessment of Grabar, the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period. Its \"unusual\" characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the qibla wall. The number of aisles is not definitively known, though fifteen is cited by a number of historians. The central aisle, double the width of the others, was probably topped by a dome.\nThe last years of Umayyad rule were turbulent for Jerusalem. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II (r. 744–750), punished Jerusalem's inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes, and tore down the city's walls. In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was ruined in an earthquake. Four years later, the Umayyads were toppled and replaced by the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\". Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque. According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration. In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction.\nA second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, except for the southern portion near the mihrab (prayer niche indicating the qibla). In 780, his successor, al-Mahdi, ordered its reconstruction, mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade. Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985, provided the following description:\n\nThis mosque is even more beautiful than that of Damascus ... the edifice [after al-Mahdi's reconstruction] rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times. The more ancient portion remained, even like a beauty spot, in the midst of the new ... the Aqsa mosque has twenty-six doors ... The centre of the Main-building is covered by a mighty roof, high pitched and gable-wise, over which rises a magnificent dome.\nAl-Muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the qibla and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the Abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates. According to Hamilton, al-Muqaddasi's description of the Abbasid-era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in 1938–1942, which showed the Abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome. The mosque described by al-Muqaddasi opened to the north, toward the Dome of the Rock, and, unusually according to Grabar, to the east.\nOther than al-Mansur and al-Mahdi, no other Abbasid caliphs visited Jerusalem or commissioned work on the al-Aqsa Mosque, though Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) ordered significant work elsewhere on the Haram. He also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque's interior, and the geographer Nasir Khusraw noted during his 1047 visit that al-Ma'mun's name was inscribed on it. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the Abbasid governor of the eastern province of Khurasan (r. 828–844), is credited by al-Muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque's front (north) side.\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids. Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form. In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque. The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094).\nThe new mosque was considerably smaller, reduced from fifteen aisles to seven, probably a reflection of the local population's significant decline by this time. Excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave, each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the qibla. The central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome. The mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor.\nA prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome, the pendentives leading to the dome, and the arch in front of the mihrab. These three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the \"triumphal arch\" by Grabar or the \"maqsura\" by Pruitt. Mosaic designs were rare in Islamic architecture in the post-Umayyad era and al-Zahir's mosaics were a revival of this Umayyad architectural practice, including Abd al-Malik's mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, but on a larger scale. The drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the Umayyad or Classical style. The four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock's eyes, eight-pointed stars, and palm fronds. On the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases.\n\nAtop the mihrab arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al-Aqsa Mosque with Muhammad's Night Journey (the isra and mi'raj) from the \"masjid al-haram\" to the \"masjid al-aqsa\". It marked the first instance of this Quranic verse being inscribed in Jerusalem, leading Grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the Fatimids to magnify the site's sacred character. The inscription credits al-Zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures, Abu al-Wasim and a sharif, al-Hasan al-Husayni, for supervising the work.\nNasir Khusraw described the mosque during his 1047 visit. He deemed it \"very large\", measuring 420 by 150 cubits on its western side. The distance between each \"sculptured\" marble column, 280 in number, was six cubits. The columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints. He noted the following features:\n\n ... the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble ... The Maksurah [or space railed off for the officials] is facing the centre of the south wall [of the Mosque and Haram Area], and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns. Above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work.\nAl-Zahir's substantial investment in the Haram, including the al-Aqsa Mosque, amid the political instability in the capital Cairo, rebellions by Bedouin tribes, especially the Jarrahids of Palestine, and plagues, indicate the caliph's \"commitment to Jerusalem\", in Pruitt's words. Although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades, the Fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque, and the Haram in general, for their own religious and political reasons. The present-day mosque largely retains al-Zahir's plan.\nFatimid investment in Jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the 11th century as their rule became further destabilized. In 1071, a Turkish mercenary, Atsiz, was invited by the city's Fatimid governor to rein in the Bedouin, but he turned on the Fatimids, besieging and capturing Jerusalem that year. A few years later, the inhabitants revolted against him, and were slaughtered by Atsiz, including those who had taken shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque. He was killed by the Turkish Seljuks in 1078, establishing Seljuk rule over the city, which lasted until the Fatimids regained control in 1098.\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.\nAfter the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187, several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense. Saladin's predecessor—the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din—had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or \"pulpit\" made of ivory and wood in 1168–69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din's minbar was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin. The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, al-Mu'azzam, built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the Mamluk sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque. They made architectural contributions elsewhere on the Haram, including building the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527) and three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538, and restoring the Pool of Raranj. These constructions were commissioned by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem, rather than the sultans, whose contributions were limited to additions to the existing minarets.\nIn 1816, the mosque was restored by Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, the Acre-based governor of Sidon, after having been in a dilapidated state.\nThe first renovation in the 20th century occurred in 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.\nSevere damage was caused by the 1837 and 1927 earthquakes. The damage from the 1927 earthquake and a small tremor in the summer of 1937 caused the roof of the mosque to collapse. Repairs were undertaken in 1938 and 1942. The upper part of the north wall of the mosque was reconstructed and the whole interior of the roofing was refaced. Other repairs included the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors, the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch, and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque. Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini donated Carrara marble columns in the late 1930s.\nOn 20 July 1951, King Abdullah I was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.\n\nThe site fell under Israeli control on 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War.\nOn 21 August 1969, a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan, an evangelical Christian who hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. In response to the incident, a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year, hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the then king of Saudi Arabia. The al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in 1972.\nFollowing the fire, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.\nIn the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque.\nOn 5 November 2014, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967, said Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib, director of the Islamic Waqf. Previous media reports of 'storming Al-Aqsa' referred to the Haram al-Sharif compound rather than the Al-Aqsa mosque itself.\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers. It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide. Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture.\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969. Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting.\nAl-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, most of which are of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.\nThe porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin's nephew al-Mu'azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924. The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period.\n\nThe mosque's interior is supported by 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.\nA great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.\nAfter its destruction by Rohan in 1969, it was replaced by a much simpler minbar. In January 2007, Adnan al-Husayni—head of the Islamic waqf in charge of al-Aqsa—stated that a new minbar would be installed; it was installed in February 2007. The design of the new minbar was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin Minbar and was finished by Badran within a period of five years. The minbar itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used \"ancient woodworking methods, joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails, but employed computer images to design the pulpit [minbar].\"\n\nCurrent situation\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government.\nThe Jerusalem Waqf is responsible for administrative matters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Religious authority on the site, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the government of the State of Palestine.\nAfter the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.\nOwnership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, other times they are over an extended period of time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.\nUntil 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Over two decades later, the Waqf still hopes negotiations between Israel and Jordan may result in allowing visitors to enter once again.\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south. The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984. According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.\nIn February 2007, the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the Mughrabi Gate, the only entrance for non-Muslims into the Temple Mount complex. This site was 60 meters (200 ft) away from the mosque. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world, and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. Ismail Haniyeh—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. Israel denied all charges against them, calling them \"ludicrous\".\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims. On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall. On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself. In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers.\nOn 15 April 2022, Israeli forces entered the Temple Mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse Palestinians who, they said, were throwing stones at policemen. Some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained by Israeli police. Over 150 people ended up injured and 400 arrested.\nOn April 5, 2023, Israeli police raided the temple, saying \"agitators\" who had thrown stones and fired fireworks at the police, had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside. Following the incident, militants fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.\nOn 22 April 2024 Israeli police arrested 13 for incitement to violence after they were caught in the act of smuggling goats onto the site for ritual sacrifice, 3 had been arrested in 2023 for trying to smuggle lambs and goats onto the site.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Israel\nList of mosques in Israel\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nIslam in the Palestinian territories\nAl-Juʽranah in Saudi Arabia, alternative location for Quranic \"al-Aqsa mosque\"\nPalestinian nationalism – Movement for self-determination and sovereignty of Palestine\nReligious significance of the Syrian region – Region east of the Mediterranean SeaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAllan, J.

      "summary": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.",

      "title": "المسجد الأقصى",
      "content": "ٱلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ أحد أكبر مساجد العالم وأحد المساجد الثلاثة التي يشد المسلمون الرحال إليها، كما قال نبي الإسلام محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ وهو أيضًا أول القبلتين في الإسلام. يقع داخل البلدة القديمة بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقة المحاطة بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الأقصى الواقع في أقصى الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية من البلدة القديمة المسورة.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابة 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تُسمى «هضبة موريا»، وتعد الصخرة أعلى نقطة فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الأقصى في القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود أيضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الأقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبة إلى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهودية التذرع بهذه الحجة لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.\n\nأصل التسمية\nللمسجد الأقصى عدة أسماء، أهمّها ثلاثة:\n\nالمسجد الأقصى: وكلمة «الأقصى» تعني الأبعد، وسُمِّيَ الأقصَى لبعد ما بينه وبين المسجد الحرام، وكان أبعد مسجد عن أهل مكة في الأرض يعظَّم بالزيارة. والذي سمّاه بهذا الاسم وفقًا للعقيدة الإسلامية الله في القرآن، وذلك في الآية: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1)، كُتبت فيه الألفُ الأخيرة ممدودةً الأقصا، وهو اسم تفضيل معناه الأبعد، ثم صار يُقصد به الوصف لا التفضيل، وفي الاسم إعلال إذ أصلها الأقصَي بالياء المنقوطة، ثم أصبحت الياء ألفاً لأن ما قبلها حرف الصاد مفتوح، وأصل ألف الأقصى واو أو ياء، إما قصِيَ يقصو، أو قصا يقصو.\nالبيت المُقَدَّس: وكلمة «المقدّس» تعني المبارك والمطهّر، وقد ذكر علماءُ المسلمين وشعراؤهم هذا الاسم كثيرًا، كما قال الإمام ابن حجر العسقلاني:\n\nبيت المَقْدِس: وهو الاسم الذي كان متعارفًا عليه قبل أن يُطلق عليه اسم «المسجد الأقصى» في القرآن الكريم، وهذا الاسم هو المستَخدَم في معظم أحاديث النبي محمد، مثل ما قاله يوم الإسراء والمعراج: «ثم دخلت أنا وجبريل عليه السلام بيت المقدس فصلى كل واحد منا ركعتين».\n\nاعتقادات خاطئة عن حدوده بسبب الاحتلال\nيعتقد الكثيرون أن المسجد الأقصى هو فقط المصلى المبني جنوبي قبة الصخرة (المصلى القبلي)، وهو الذي تقام فيه الصلوات الخمس الآن للرجال، وهذا الاعتقاد نتيجة محاولات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي الصهيوني السيطرة على أجزاء من الأقصى أو تدميره، والصحيح أن المسجد الأقصى هو اسم لجميع المسجد وهو كل ما هو داخل سور المسجد ويشمل الساحات الواسعة، والجامع القبلي وقبة الصخرة والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة والأروقة والقباب والمصاطب وأسبلة الماء والحدائق وتحت أرض المسجد وفوقه وغيرها من المعالم، وعلى أسواره المآذن، والمسجد كله غير مسقّف سوى بناء قبة الصخرة والمصلى القبلي الجامع والمصلى المرواني. وهذا ما اتفق عليه العلماء والمؤرخون، وعليه تكون مضاعفة ثواب الصلاة في أي جزء مما دار عليه السور، وتبلغ مساحته تقريباً 144000 متراً مربعاً.\n\nتاريخ المسجد الأقصى\nأول بنائه\nلا يُعرف بدقة متى بُني المسجد الأقصى لأول مرة، ولكن ورد في أحاديث النبي محمد بأن بناءه كان بعد بناء الكعبة بأربعين عامًا، فعن أبي ذر أنه قال: «قلت: يا رسول الله! أي مسجد وضع في الأرض أول؟ قال: المسجد الحرام. قلت: ثم أي؟ قال: المسجد الأقصى. قلت: كم بينهما؟ قال: أربعون سنة». وقد اختلف المؤرخون في مسألة الباني الأول للمسجد الأقصى على عدة أقوال: أنهم الملائكة، أو النبي آدم أبو البشر، أو ابنه شيث، أو سام بن نوح، أو النبي إبراهيم، ويرجع الاختلاف في ذلك إلى الاختلاف في الباني الأول للكعبة، وقد رجّح الباحث عبد الله معروف بأن آدم هو من بنى المسجد الأقصى البناء الأول، لرواية عن ابن عباس، ولترجيح أن يكون آدم هو الباني للكعبة، كما رجّحه الإمام ابن حجر العسقلاني في كتابه فتح الباري. ويُرجّح عبد الله معروف أن يكون البناء الأول للمسجد الأقصى قد اقتصر على وضع حدوده وتحديد مساحته التي تتراوح ما بين 142 و144 دونماً.\n\nعهد اليبوسيين وبني إسرائيل\nأما من بعد عهد آدم، فقد انقطعت أخبار المسجد لانعدام التأريخ في تلك الفترة، إلى أن سُجلت معلومات تاريخية عن أول مجموعة من البشر قدمت إلى مدينة القدس وسكنتها، وهم اليبوسيون (3000 - 1550 ق.م) قبيلة كنعانية، وهم الذين بنوا مدينة القدس وأسموها \"اور شليم (مدينة السلام)، حتى أن بقايا الآثار اليبوسية ما تزال باقية في سور المسجد الأقصى بحسب رأي بعض الباحثين. وفي تلك الفترة، هاجر النبي إبراهيم إلى مدينة القدس، وعمّر المسجد وصلّى فيه، وكذلك ابنه إسحق وحفيده يعقوب من بعده.\nوبعد ذلك آل أمر مدينة القدس والمسجد الأقصى إلى الفراعنة (1550 - 1000 ق.م)، ثم استولى عليها لاحقًا «القوم العمالقة»، ثم فتح المدينة النبي داود ومعه بنو إسرائيل عام 995 ق.م، فَوُسْع المدينة وعمّر المسجد الأقصى. ثم استلم الحكم ابنه سليمان، فعمّر المسجد وجدّده مرة أخرى، ويروي النبي محمد ذلك فيقول: «لِمَا فرغ سُليمانُ بنُ داودَ عليهما اَلسَّلَام من بناءِ بيتِ المقدسِ سأل اللهَ عَزَّ وَجِلَ ثلاثًا أن يُؤتيَه حُكمًا يُصادِفُ حُكمَه ومُلكًا لا ينبغي لأحدٍ من بعدِه وَأَنَّهُ لا يأتي هذا المسجدَ أحدٌ لا يُريدُ إِلَّا اَلصَّلَاة فيه إلَّا خرج من ذنوبِه كيومِ ولدَتْه أُمّه» فقال النبي محمد: «أما اثنتيْن فقد أُعْطِيهما وأرجو أن يكونَ قد أُعْطِي اَلثَّالِثَة»، وهذا البناء لسليمان هو الذي يقول اليهود بنسبته إليهم، ويطلقون عليه اسم «هيكل سليمان». وبوفاة النبي سليمان، انتهى حكم بني إسرائيل الذي دام 80 عامًا.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nبعد وفاة سليمان، انقسمت دولة بني إسرائيل إلى «مملكة إسرائيل» في الشمال، و«مملكة يهوذا» في الجنوب ومعها القدس، وما لبثت أن هاجمها البابليون وأحرقوا الهيكل، وسبوا اليهود إلى بابل فيما عُرْف بالسبي البابلي. بعد ذلك هزم الفرس البابليين، وسمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن أراد من أسرى اليهود في بابل بالعودة إلى القدس وإعادة بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود إلى القدس وشرعوا في بناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنة 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الأول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه.\n\nعهد الرومان والبيزنطيين\nاحتلّ الإغريق أراضي فلسطين، وخضعت للإسكندر المقدوني (حوالي عام 332 ق.م)، ثم لخلفائه البطالمة، ثم للسلوقيين، ولم تلبث المدينة حتى خضعت لحكم الإمبراطورية الرومانية، وكان من أوائل الحكام وأبرزهم الذين عينهم الرومان لحكم القدس الحاكم هيرودس (حوالي عام 37 ق.م)، وقد قام بتجديد بناء البيت المقدس (حوالي عام 20 ق.م)، كما أقام قلعة عظيمة بباب الخليل (يطلق عليها اليهود الآن اسم «قلعة داود»). وفي تلك الفترة تذكر المصادر الإسلامية بعثة النبي عيسى بن مريم، وزكريا وابنه يحيى بن زكريا إلى بني إسرائيل في القدس، حيث كان يحيى يعِظُهم داخل المسجد الأقصى، كما يفيد الحديث النبوي: «فجمع يحيى بن زكريا بني إسرائيل في بيت المقدس حتى امتلأ المسجد فقعد على الشرف فحمد الله وأثنى عليه ثم قال إن الله أمرني بخمس كلمات أن أعمل بهن وأمركم أن تعملوا بهن..»، كما يذكر الإنجيل الذي بين أيدي النصارى اليوم أن عيسى بن مريم أنكر على بني إسرائيل انحرافهم عن عبادة الله تعالى داخل المسجد الأقصى، وتحويلهم إياه إلى مكان للبيع والشراء.\nوبعد النبي عيسى بن مريم بحوالي 300 عام، انقسمت الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى الإمبراطورية الرومانية الغربية في الغرب، والإمبراطورية البيزنطية في الشرق، وبقيت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية هي المُسيطرة على القدس، فأصبحت القدس مدينة نصرانية، وبنوا فيها كنيسة القيامة. أما المسجد الأقصى فبقي متروكًا كما هو دون بناء. وفي عام 614 احتل الفرس مدينة القدس بمعاونة اليهود، وذلك بعد حرب طويلة ضد البيزنطيين الروم، وقد وقع ذلك في الفترة التي بُعث فيها النبي محمد في مكة، إذ يذكر القرآن قصة الحروب في سورة الروم: ﴿غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ ۝٢ فِي أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ ۝٣﴾ [الروم:2–3].(2) وما لبث أن عاد البيزنطيون الروم إلى الحكم عام 624، وفي تلك الفترة أصبحت أرض المسجد الأقصى مكبًا للنّفايات، وذلك انتقامًا من اليهود، إذ كانت الصخرة المُشرفة قبلة لهم.\n\nعهد النبي محمد\nكانت هناك أهميّة خاصة للمسجد الأقصى في عهد النبي محمد، إذ كان القبلة الأولى للمسلمين بعد هجرة النبي محمد إلى المدينة المنورة عام 1 هـ الموافق 622م، فقد كان المسلمون يتوجّهون إلى المسجد الأقصى في صلواتهم، ومكثوا على ذلك مدة 16 شهرًا تقريبًا. فقد روى البراء بن عازب أنه قال: «لما قَدِمَ النَّبيُ صلى الله عليه وسلم المدينةَ صلّى نَحوَ بيتِ المقدسِ سِتةَ عَشرَ شهرًا أو سبعةَ عَشرَ شهرًا، وكان يُحبُ أنْ يُوَجِّهِ إلى الكَعبةِ، فأنزل اللّه  ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤﴾ [البقرة:144] (3).».\nوكان المسجد الأقصى وجهة النبي محمد في الرحلة المعجزة المعروفة باسم الإسراء والمعراج، وذلك ليلة 27 رجب بعد البعثة بعشر سنين (3 ق هـ)، إذ يؤمن المسلمون أن النبيَّ محمدًا خرج من المسجد الحرام بصحبة المَلَك جبريل راكبًا دابّة البراق، فنزل في المسجد الأقصى وربط البُراق بحلقة باب المسجد عند حائط البراق، وصلّى بجميع الأنبياء إمامًا، ثم عُرج به من الصخرة المشرّفة إلى فوق سبع سماوات مارًا بالأنبياء: آدم ويحيى بن زكريا وعيسى بن مريم ويوسف وإدريس وهارون وموسى وإبراهيم.\n\nالفتح الإسلامي\nعندما تولّى الخليفة أبو بكر الصديق خلافة المسلمين خلفاً للنبي محمد، قام بتسيير جيش أسامة بن زيد لفتح بلاد الشام عامّة ونشر الدعوة الإسلامية فيها، وقد كان النبي محمد قد جهّز جيش أسامة قبل وفاته، وما لبث أن تُوفي أبو بكر الصديق، فتولّى عمر بن الخطاب الخلافة، فكان أوّل ما فعله أن ولّى أبا عبيدة بن الجراح قيادة الجيش الفاتح لبلاد الشام بدلاً من خالد بن الوليد، فوصل أبو عبيدة بن الجراح إلى مدينة القدس (وكانت تُسمى «إيلياء»)، فاستعصت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعة أسوارها، حيث اعتصم أهلها داخل الأسوار، فحاصرهم حتى تعبوا وأرسلوا يطلبون الصلحَ وتسليم المدينة بلا قتال، واشترطوا أن يأتي خليفة المسلمين بنفسه إلى القدس ليتسلّم مفاتيحها منهم، فخرج عمر بن الخطاب من المدينة المنورة حتى وصل القدس، وذلك عام 15 هـ الموافق 636م، وأعطى أهلها الأمن وكتب لهم العهدة العمرية. وقد صحبه البطريرك «صفرونيوس» فزار كنيسة القيامة، ومن ثم أوصله إلى المسجد الأقصى، فلمّا دخله قال: «الله أكبر، هذا المسجد الذي وصفه لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم»، وكان في تلك الأيام هضبة خالية في قلبها الصخرة المشرفة، ثم أمر الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب ببناء المصلّى الرئيسي الذي سيكون مكان الصلاة الرئيسي في المسجد الأقصى، وهو موقع «الجامع القبلي» اليوم، ويقع في الجنوب في جهة القبلة، وكان المسجد في عهده خشبيًّا يتّسع لحوالي 1000 شخص، وبقي على حاله إلى زمن الخليفة الأموي معاوية بن أبي سفيان.\n\nالعهد الأموي\nبعد قيام الدولة الأموية في عام 41 هـ الموافق 661 على يد معاوية بن أبي سفيان، قام بتجديد بناء المسجد القبلي داخل المسجد الأقصى الذي بناه عمر بن الخطاب، فجعل من الحجر بدلاً من الخشب، ووسّعه ليسع 3000 مصلٍ. وقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين المسلمين في مذكراتهم مثل مجير الدين والمقدسي والسيوطي أن أوسع حركة تعمير للمسجد تمت في عهد الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان منذ عام 65 هـ الموافق 685 جنبا إلى جنب مع قبة الصخرة، وتواصلت في عهد ابنه الوليد بن عبد الملك حتى عام 96 هـ الموافق 715. حيث بدأ البناء الأموي للمسجد الأقصى ببناء قبة الصخرة وهي قبة ذهبية فوق الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب الأقصى (في منتصف المسجد أقرب إلى الغرب قليلا)، والتي تمثل أعلى نقطة في جبل البيت المقدس، ويعتقد أن معراج النبي محمد إلى السماء تم منها، لتكون قبة للمسجد كاملاً. وقبل الشروع ببنائها، أقيمت بجانبها قبة صغيرة في منتصف المسجد الأقصى تماماً، عُرفت بـ «قبة السلسلة»، لتكون مقراً للمشرفين على البناء للأقصى، وخزانة لجمع الأموال اللازمة لذلك، وقيل لتكون نموذجاً لقبة الصخرة.\n\nالزلزال وإعادة البناء\nفي عام 746م، تعرض المسجد الأقصى إلى زلزال أدى إلى تدميره، وبعد أربع سنوات أطاح السفاح بالخلافة الأموية، وأنشأ الخلافة العباسية عام 750م. وبعد أربع سنوات توفي السفاح بعد أن عهد بالخلافة لأخيه أبو جعفر المنصور، وقد أعلن المنصور نيته لإصلاح المسجد، وقال أنه لويحات الذهب والفضة التي غطت بوابات المسجد يجب إزالتها وتحولت إلى دينار ودرهم لتمويل إعادة الإعمار التي انتهت في عام 771م. وفي عام 774م، ضرب زلزال ثاني المسجد أدى إلى تدمير معظم إصلاحات المنصور، باستثناء تلك التي في الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وفي عام 780م، أعيد بناء المسجد في عهد الخليفة محمد المهدي الذي أمر ببنائه فانقص من طوله وزيد في عرضه وفي عام 985، أشار الجغرافي المقدسي أن المسجد الذي تم تجديده كان يضم «خمسة عشر رواق وخمسة عشر باب».\n\nفي عام 1033م، تعرض المسجد لأضرار بليغة بسبب وقوع زلزال آخر. وفي عهد الخليفة الفاطمي الظاهر تم إصلاح الأضرار، وتجديد المسجد بين عامي 1034 و1036م. وتم تخفيض عدد الأروقة جذريا من خمسة عشر إلى سبعة. وفي عهد الظاهر بنيت الأروقة الأربعة من القاعة المركزية والممر الذي يستخدم حاليا كأساس للمسجد. وقد كان الممر المركز ضعف عرض الممرات الأخرى، وقد وصف الجغرافي الفارسي ناصر بن خسرو المسجد الأقصى خلال زيارته له عام 1047م:\n\n.\n\nالحملة الصّليبيّة\nفي عام 1099م، سيطر الصليبيون على القدس، أثناء الحملة الصليبية الأولى. وبدلا من تدمير المسجد أطلقوا عليه اسم معبد سليمان، وقد استخدمه الصليبيون أولًا كقصر ملكي وإسطبل للخيول. وفي عام 1119م، تم تحويله إلى مقر لفرسان الهيكل. وخلال هذه الفترة، خضع المسجد إلى بعض التغييرات الهيكلية، بما في ذلك توسيع الشرفة الشمالية، وإضافة حنية (محراب الكنيسة) وجدار فاصل. وقد تم بناء دير جديد وكنيسة أيضًا في الموقع، جنبًا إلى جنب مع غيرها من الهياكل المختلفة وقد شيد فرسان المعبد أقباء ومرفقاتها في الجهة الغربية والشرقية للمبنى؛ ويستعمل القبو الغربي حاليًا كمسجد للنساء أما الشرقي فيستخدم كمتحف إسلامي.\nبعد حصار 1187م استطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي باستعادة القدس من يد الصليبيين، وأجريت العديد من الإصلاحات والتجديدات في المسجد الأقصى. من أجل إعداد المسجد لأداء صلاة الجمعة، وفي غضون أسبوع من استعادة صلاح الدين للقدس تم إزالة المراحيض ومخازن الحبوب المثبتة من قبل الصليبيين في الأقصى، وقد تم أيضا إزالة الأرضيات المغطاة بالسجاد الثمين، وباطنها المعطر بماء الورد والبخور، وقد كلف نور الدين الزنكي، ببناء منبر جديد مصنوع من العاج والخشب في 1168-1169م، ولكن تم الانتهاء منه بعد وفاته، وقد قام صلاح الدين بإضافة منبر نور الدين زنكي إلى المسجد في نوفمبر 1187م، وفي عام 1218م، تم تشييد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد مع ثلاث بوابات في عهد المعظم السلطان الأيوبي لدمشق، وفي عام 1345م، تم إضافة أضاف اثنين من البلاطات وبوابتين على الجانب الشرقي للمسجد، بأمر من السلطان المملوكي الكامل سيف الدين شعبان ابن قلاوون.\nوبعد وصول العثمانيين إلى السلطة في 1517م، لم يقوموا بأي تجديدات أو إصلاحات للمسجد نفسه، لكن قاموا ببعض الإضافات للحرم الشريف ككل. وشمل ذلك بناء نافورة قاسم باشا عام 1527م، وتم ترميم بركة الرارانج، وبناء ثلاث قباب قائمة بذاتها، وأبرزها قبة النبي التي بنيت في عام 1538م. وقد اهتم الولاة العثمانيين في القدس بالمسجد كثيرا وجعلوه في مقدمة أولياتهم.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالتجديد الأول للمسجد الأقصى في القرن العشرين حدث في عام 1922، عندما كلف المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى تحت أمين الحسيني (مفتي القدس الكبرى) المهندس المعماري التركي أحمد كيماليتين استعادة المسجد الأقصى والمعالم الآثرية في ساحاته. كما أن المجلس أيضا قام بتكليف المهندسين المعماريين البريطانيين وخبراء مصريين والمسؤولين المحليين للمساهمة والإشراف على الإصلاحات والإضافات التي نفذها كيماليتين مابين 1924–1925. وقد شملت التجديدات تعزيز الأسس الأموية القديمة للمسجد، وتصحيح الأعمدة الداخلية، لتحل محل العوارض ونصب السقالات، وشملت أيضا التجديدات ترميم الأقواس والمنطقة الداخلية للقبة الرئيسية وكيفية الحفاظ عليها، وقد تم إعادة بناء الجدار الجنوبي، واستبدال الأخشاب في الصحن المركزي بكتلة من الخرسانة. وكشفت التجديدات أيضا عن فسيفساء تعود إلى العصر الفاطمي، وأيضا أكتشف وجود نقوش على الأقواس الداخلية التي كانت مغطاة بالجبس. وقد زينت الأقواس بالذهب والجص الأخضر ملون واستبدلت الأخشاب بالنحاس. وجدد ربع نوافذ الزجاج المعشق أيضا بعناية شديدة حفاظا على تصاميمهم العباسية والفاطمية الأصلية، وقد تعرض المسجد الأقصى لأضرار شديدة بسبب وقوع زلازل ما بين 1927 و1937، وقد تم إصلاح الأضرار التي لحقت بالمسجد في عام 1938 و1942.\n\nحريق المسجد\nتعرض في صبيحة يوم الخميس الموافق 22 أغسطس 1969م لحريق على يد يهودي أسترالي متطرف اسمه مايكل دينس روهن، حيث تم حرق الجامع القبلي الذي سقط سقف قسمه الشرقي بالكامل، كما احترق منبر صلاح الدين، الذي أمر ببنائه نور الدين زنكي قبل تحرير المسجد الأقصى من الصليبيين وقام (صلاح الدين الأيوبي) بوضعه داخل المسجد بعد التحرير، وقد قال روهن تعقيبا على الحريق الذي إفتعله أنه كان يأمل من إحراق المسجد الأقصى كان من شأنه أن يعجل المجيء الثاني للمسيح، مما يجعل الطريق لاعادة بناء الهيكل اليهودي المزعوم على جبل الهيكل. وأدخل روهن إلى مصحة الأمراض العقلية، وردا على الحادث، تم عقد قمة للدول الإسلامية في الرباط في العام نفسه، الذي استضافه الملك فيصل. ويعتبر حريق الأقصى أحد العوامل المحفزة لتشكيل منظمة المؤتمر الإسلامي (والآن منظمة التعاون الإسلامي)، وفي عام 1972، تم ترميم المسجد الأقصى والمنبر معه، وتتولى الأردن ترميم وإصلاح المسجدين على نفقتها الخاصة كلما دعا الأمر لذلك.\nفي الثمانينيات من القرن الماضي، تآمر بن شوشان ويهودا اتزيون وكلاهما عضو في منظمة غوش ايمونيم السرية، لتفجير المسجد الأقصى وقبة الصخرة. أما اتزيون فقد كان يعتقد أن تفجير اثنين من المساجد سوف يتسبب بصحوة روحية في الكيان الصهيوني، وسوف يحل جميع مشاكل اليهود. كما أعرب كل من بن شونان واتزينون عن أملهم في بناء المعبد الثالث في القدس وتحديداً في موقع المسجد الأقصى. وفي 15 يناير 1988، خلال الانتفاضة الأولى، أطلقت القوات الصهيونية الرصاص المطاطي والغاز المسيل للدموع على المتظاهرين خارج المسجد، مما أدى إلى إصابة 40 من المصلين. وفي 8 أكتوبر 1990، قتل 22 فلسطينياً وأصيب أكثر من 100 آخرين من «شرطة الحدود الصهيونية» خلال الاحتجاجات التي تم تشغيلها بواسطة الإعلان عن «جبل الهيكل»، على يد مجموعة من اليهود المتدينين، الذين كانوا في طريقهم لوضع حجر الأساس للهيكل الثالث المزعوم.\n\nالقرن 21\nفي 28 سبتمبر 2000، قام أرئيل شارون وأعضاء من حزب الليكود، جنبا إلى جنب مع 1000 حارس مسلح، بزيارة المسجد الأقصى، مما تسبب بمظاهرة كبيرة من الفلسطينيين احتجاجا على هذه الزيارة، وبدأ الفلسطينيون من الحرم القدسي برمي الحجارة على الشرطة الإسرائيلية. التي قامت بإطلاق الغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي على الحشد مما أسفر عن مقتل أربعة وإصابة حوالي 200 شخص، مما اسفر عن اصابة 24 شخصًا. وقد أثارت هذه الزيارة انتفاضة لمدة خمس سنوات على يد الفلسطينيين، ويُشار إليها باسم «انتفاضة الأقصى»، ويرى بعض المعلقين، نقلاً عن خطب لاحقة من قبل مسؤولين في السلطة الفلسطينية، وخاصة عماد الفالوجي وعرفات نفسه، أن الانتفاضة كانت مخططة مسبقا قبل أشهر من هذه الزيارة ، ربما في يوليو أو تموز عند عودة ياسر عرفات من محادثات كامب ديفيد.\nومع اندلاع الانتفاضة الفلسطينية الثالثة شدد الاحتلال الإسرائيلي القيود على دخول المسجد الأقصى من تحديد أعمار المصلين، فلا يسمح لمن هم دون الـ45 سنة من سكان الضفة الغربية من دخول المسجد بدون تصاريح، حتى في أهم وأقدس المناسبات الإسلامية مثل شهر رمضان المبارك، أما بالنسبة لسكان قطاع غزة فلا يسمح إلا لأعداد قليلة من كبار السن ممن تتجاوز أعمارهم 50 سنة بدخول المسجد الأقصى وبتصاريح خاصة.\n\nقرار اليونيسكو سنة 2016\nفي يوم 14 أكتوبر 2016، اتخذت لجنة البرامج والعلاقات الخارجية في المجلس التنفيذي لمنظمة اليونسكو قرارًا جاء فيه أن المنظمة تعتبر المسجد الأقصى أحد المقدسات الإسلامية، بدون ذكر وجود أي علاقة تاريخية بين اليهود والمسجد، ومستنكرة اقتحامه المتكرر من قبل بعض المتطرفين الإسرائيليين ومن قبل الجيش الإسرائيلي. وجاء هذا القرار استجابةً لمشروع تم تقديمه من قبل الجزائر ومصر ولبنان والمغرب وعمان وقطر والسودان. وقد رحبت عدة منظمات وهيئات إسلامية بالقرار وفي مقدمتها منظمة التعاون الإسلامي ومرصد الجامع الأزهر، وهيئة علماء المسلمين في العراق، إلى جانب الحكومة والفصائل الفلسطينية. بالمقابل، قالت مصادر إسرائيلية أن الحكومة تسعى إلى تليين قرار اليونيسكو سالف الذكر، وأن إسرائيل تجري اتصالات دبلوماسية حثيثة لتليين صيغة نص القرار. وقال محللين آخرين أيضًا أن هذا تأكيد دولي على أن القدس منطقة محتلة، وعلى إسرائيل التفاوض بشأنها.\n\nمنع الصلاة في المسجد سنة 2017\nفي يوم الجمعة 20 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 14 يوليو 2017م، قالت الشرطة الإسرائيلية إنها قررت منع صلاة الجمعة في المسجد الأقصى لهذا اليوم وإغلاق أبوابه حتى إشعار آخر، وذلك في أعقاب عملية إطلاق نار وقعت صباح نفس اليوم المذكور أفضت إلى استشهاد ثلاثة شبان فلسطينيين وقتل ثلاثة من أفراد الشرطة الإسرائيلية بالقرب من باب الأسباط بالقدس. ونشرت الشرطة المذكورة تصريح مكتوب قالت فيه أن قائدها العام في القدس «يهورام هاليفي» قرر إغلاق أبواب المسجد، وإعلانه منطقة عسكرية يمنع بموجبها على المصلين دخوله إضافة إلى البلدة القديمة في القدس، لتكون تلك المرة الأولى التي تقفل فيها أبواب المسجد أمام المصلين منذ سنة 1969م، وذلك في اليوم التالي لإقدام اليهودي المتطرف مايكل دينس روهن على محاولة إحراق المسجد. بِالمُقابل قال مكتب رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو إن الإغلاق هو ليوم واحد فقط. وعندما أُعلن هذا الأمر، دعا المفتي العام للقدس والديار الفلسطينية الشيخ محمد حسين إلى شد الرحال للأقصى والتواجد على الحواجز وفي الساحات لإقامة صلاة الجمعة، وقال أن «لا قوة على وجه الأرض ستمنعهم من التوجه للأقصى وإقامة صلاة الجمعة فيه». بالمقابل شرعت منظمات وأحزاب يهودية بحملة تحريض واسعة بحق المسجد الأقصى والمصلين، عقب عملية إطلاق النار سالِفة الذِكر، وقال عضو الكنيست من حزب البيت اليهودي «موتي يوغاف» إلى إغلاق المسجد الأقصى بوجه المسلمين لفترة دائمة، وقالت منظمة جبل الهيكل إلى الرد على عملية القدس عبر زيادة بناء المستوطنات اليهودية وزيادة ساعات الاقتحام للأقصى، كما قال نائب وزير الجيش الإسرائيلي، الحاخام إيلي بن دهان، إنه يجب على اليهود أن يعززوا قبضتهم على المسجد الأقصى، وضمان أن يصلي كل يهودي فيه بأمان وفي كل وقت.\n\nوفي يوم 22 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 16 يوليو 2017م، نصبت السُلطات الإسرائيلية بوَّابات تفتيش إلكترونيَّة على عدد من أبواب الأقصى في سبيل تعزيز إجراءاتها الأمنيَّة، بِالإضافة إلى كاميرات مُراقبة لِلاطلاع على ما يجري داخل باحات المسجد. ثُمَّ أعلن وزير الأمن الداخلي الإسرائيلي جلعاد أردان افتتاح بابيّ الأسباط والمجلس المُؤديان إلى المسجد، لكنَّهُ في نفس الوقت قال أنَّ «إسرائيل هي صاحبة السيادة في المسجد، وموقف الدُول الأُخرى ليس مهماً» وأنَّ «إسرائيل إذا قررت فعل شيء في القدس ستُنفذه». وقد رفض موظفو الأوقاف الإسلاميَّة الدُخول إلى المسجد ومُباشرة أعمالهم احتجاجًا على هذه الخطوة الإسرائيليَّة. أيضًا رفض عامَّة الناس الانصياع للإجراءات الإسرائيليَّة ورفضوا دخول المسجد عبر هذه البوابات، وتجمهروا أمام باب الأسباط لِأداء الصلاة، وأعلنوا الاعتصام لِلحيلولة دون تحويل وضع المسجد الأقصى إلى ما يشبه الوضع القائم في المسجد الإبراهيمي بالخليل والإبقاء على البوابات الإلكترونية بشكلٍ دائم. استمرَّ الوضع قائمًا على هذه الحال بضعة أيَّام، فتظاهر المقدسيُّون وتابعوا اعتصامهم أمام أبواب المسجد الأقصى، وتخلل ذلك بعض الاشتباكات مع الشرطة الإسرائيليَّة، وفي يوم 4 ذي القعدة 1438هـ الموافق فيه 27 يوليو 2017م أعلنت الشرطة الإسرائيلية إزالة كل الإجراءات الأمنية التي استحدثتها وعودة الوضع إلى ما كان عليه قبل وقوع الهُجوم الذي أدى إلى مقتل ثلاثة من أفراد الشرطة، فعمَّت الاحتفالات مدينة القدس ابتهاجًا بفتح أبواب المسجد الأقصى، وأقيمت الصلوات في مواعيدها المعتادة بداخل الحرم يومذاك. وبعد إعادة افتتاح المسجد ببضعة أيَّام، وتحديدًا يوم 8 ذي القعدة 1438هـ، كشف رئيس مركز القدس الدولي حسن خاطر، أن السلطات الإسرائيلية صادرت وثائق مهمة كانت محفوظة بداخله، تتعلق بأملاك وأوقاف القدس وأراضيها، وذلك أثناء فترة إغلاقه أمام المسلمين. وحذَّر من كارثة كبيرة تحوم حول الحرم القدسي نظرًا لأن إسرائيل تمهد للتلاعب بالوثائق التي استولت عليها بهدف إلحاق الضرر بالأوقاف، التي تشكل أملاكها ما نسبته 90% من البلدة القديمة، مقسمة بين عقارات وأراضٍ ووقف إسلامي. بعد هذا الاكتشاف، شكَّلت دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية بالقدس لجنة فنية لحصر حجم المفقودات من الوثائق المسروقة للتحرك ضد إسرائيل.\n\nاقتحام المسجد الأقصى 2022\nفي صباح يوم الجمعة الموافق 15 أبريل 2022 قامت قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي باقتحام المسجد الأقصى، مستخدمةً قنابل الغاز المسيل للدموع والقنابل الصوتية، مما أدى إلى إصابة ما لا يقل عن 90 فلسطينياً بجروح.\n\nالعمارة\nالمسجد الأقصى هو المنطقة المحاطة بالسور المستطيل الواقعة في جنوب شرق مدينة القدس المسورة والتي تعرف بالبلدة القديمة. وتبلغ مساحة المسجد قرابة الـ 144 دونماً ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد الأقصى حسب الصورة المرفقة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلم. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تسمى هضبة موريا وتعتبر الصخرة هي أعلى نقطة في المسجد وتقع في موقع القلب بالنسبة للمسجد الأقصى الشريف.\nوتبلغ قياسات المسجد: من الجنوب 281 مترا ومن الشمال 310 أمتار ومن الشرق 462 مترا ومن الغرب 491 مترا. وتشكل هذه المساحة سدس مساحة البلدة القديمة، وهذه الحدود لم تتغير منذ وضع المسجد أول مرة كمكان للصلاة بخلاف المسجد الحرام والمسجد النبوي اللذين تم توسعيهما عدة مرات.\nوللمسجد الأقصى أربعة مآذن هي مئذنة باب المغاربة الواقعة الجنوب الغربي، مئذنة باب السلسلة الواقعة في الجهة الغربية قرب باب السلسلة، مئذنة باب الغوانمة الواقعة في الشمال الغربي، ومئذنة باب الأسباط الواقعة في الجهة الشمالية.\n\nمعالم المسجد الأقصى\nالمصليات\nيتكون المسجد الأقصى من سبع مصليات أو مساجد معمدة مع عدة قاعات صغيرة إضافية من الجهة الغربية والشرقية من الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وقد كان يوجد 121 نافذة من الزجاج الملون في المسجد من عصور الخلافة العباسية والفاطمية. تم استعادة حوالي ربعهم في عام 1924.\nوالمساجد هي:\n\n1 - الجامع القِبلي\n\nوهو الجامع المسقوف الذي تعلوه قبّة رصاصية، والواقع في جنوبيّ المسجد الأقصى في جهة القِبلة، ومن هنا جاءت تسميته بـ «القِبلي». ويُعتبر هذا الجامع المصلّى الرئيس الذي يخطب فيه الخطيب في صلاة الجمعة، كما أنّه يُعتبر المصلّى الرئيس للرجال داخل المسجد الأقصى حيث يقف الإمام، وحيث يوجد المحراب والمنبر الرئيسان. والبناء الحالي يعود للعصر الأموي، حيث بَدأ العمل على تجديد بناءه الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان، وأتمّه ابنه الخليفة الوليد بن عبد الملك بين عامي 86 هـ-96 هـ الموافق 705-714م، وكان في الأصل مكونًا من 15 رواقًا، ثم أًعيد ترميمه بعد تعرّضه لزلازل أدّت لتصدّعه، واختُصِرت أروقته في عصر الخليفة الفاطمي الظاهر لإعزاز دين الله إلى 7 أروقة، وفي وقتنا الحالي يتكوّن من رواق كبير في الوسط و3 أروقة في كل جانب. وللجامع قبّة مرتفعة داخلية مصنوعة من الخشب، تعلوها القبّة الرئيسة الخارجيّة والمُغطّاة بألواح الرصاص. وتبلغ مساحة الجامع حوالي 4 دونمات، طوله 80م وعرضه 55م، على اختلاف يسير بين طول ضلعه الشرقي والغربي، وله 11 بابًا، ويتّسع إلى حوالي 5500 مصلّ.\nوكان أوّل من بناه هو عمر بن الخطاب عند الفتح الإسلامي عام 15 هـ، وذلك بعد أن استشار كعب الأحبار في مكان بناء المسجد، فأشار عليه في مكان الصخرة، فرفض ذلك عمر وقال: «بل نجعل قبلته صدره كما جعل رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قبلة مساجدنا صدورنا»، وكان بناؤه من الخشب، وكان يتّسع حوالي 1000 مصلّ، ثمّ جدّده الخليفة معاوية بن أبي سفيان، فصار يتّسع حوالي 3000 مصلّ. وعندما سيطر الصليبيون على القدس قسّموا الجامع القبلي إلى ثلاثة أقسام: أحدها تحوّل إلى مكاتب، والآخر إلى سكن لفرسان المعبد، والثالث إلى كنيسة، وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي فرمّم المسجد عام 538 هـ الموافق 1187، ثم توالت الترميمات في عصر الدولة المملوكية والدولة العثمانية لاحقًا. وفي العصر الحديث، وبعد احتلال اليهود لفلسطين، بقي الجامع القبلي تحت تهديد اليهود، فعمدوا إلى أعمال حفر تحت أغلب الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد وتحت أساسات الجامع القبلي كلها مما هدّدت أساساته، كما تعرّض الجامع القبلي لحريق مفتعل وذلك يوم 21 أغسطس 1969 على يد مايكل دينس روهن، فاحترق منبر نور الدين زنكي، وامتد الحريق ليشمل أغلب الأروقة الثلاثة الشرقية، بالإضافة إلى سقفه الخشبي.\nوفي يناير 2007، ذكر عدنان الحسيني – رئيس دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية والمسؤول عن كتائب شهداء – أنه سيجري تركيب منبر جديد؛ وقد جرى تثبيته في فبراير 2007. كما أن تصميم المنبر الجديد هو من تصميم جمال بدران استناداً إلى نسخة طبق الأصل من منبر صلاح الدين الأيوبي، وقد عمل عليه بدران مدة خمس سنوات. المنبر نفسه جرى بناؤه في الأردن في مدة أربع سنوات، واستخدم الحرفيين أساليب النجارة القديمة لبنائه، واستعمل قطع من أوتاد بدلاً من المسامير لتثبيته.\n\n2 - المصلى المرواني\n\nويقع في أسفل الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية للمسجد الأقصى، وكان يُعرَف قديمًا «بالتسوية الشرقية»، وقد بناه الأمويون كتسوية معمارية لهضبة بيت المقدس الأصلية المنحدرة جهة الجنوب، حتى يتسنّى البناء فوق قسمها الجنوبيّ. ويتكوّن المصلّى المرواني من 16 رواقًا، وتبلغ مساحته الإجمالية أكثر من 4000 مترًا مربعًا، وهي أكبر مساحة مُغطاة للصلاة في المسجد الأقصى. عندما سيطر الصليبيون على المسجد الأقصى، قاموا بتحويل المصلّى المرواني إلى إسطبلات للخيول، وسمّوه «إسطبلات سليمان»، وهي تسميّة توراتية نسبةً إلى النبي سليمان. وبعد تحرير المسجد الأقصى في عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي، أعاد المصلى المرواني إلى استعماله السابق باعتباره تسويةً ومخزنًا. وبقي الأمر كذلك حتى عام 1996، حيث تم افتتاحه كمُصلّى وسُمي يومئذٍ بالمُصلّى المرواني نسبةً إلى عبد الملك بن مروان.\nوكان سبب افتتاحه كمُصلّى هو تسريب وثيقة سريّة لتقسيم المسجد الأقصى باعتبار ما تحت الأرض لليهود وما فوق الأرض للمسلمين وذلك في عام 1995، بعد ذلك قررت عدة هيئات إسلامية البدء بالعمل على فتح المصلّى المرواني، فبدأت بتنظيف المكان، ومدّ الكهرباء إليه وإضاءته، ثم تبليط المصلّى، وتبرعت مصر بفرش المصلّى، وتم فتح عدّة أبواب له. وكان هذا العمل الذي تم هو السبب المُعلَن للزيارة التي قام بها أرئيل شارون للمسجد يوم الخميس 28 سبتمبر 2000، والتي أدّت لانطلاق انتفاضة الأقصى والتي استمرت 5 سنوات.\n3 - مصلى الأقصى القديم\n\nويقع هذا المصلّى تحت الجامع القبلي، يدخل إليه عبر درج يقع قرب الرواق الأوسط في الجهة الشمالية للجامع القبلي، وهو عبارة عن ممر يتكون من رواقين باتجاه الجنوب بناه الأمويون ليكون مدخلاً ملكيًا إلى المسجد الأقصى من القصور الأموية التي تقع خارج حدود الأقصى من الجهة الجنوبية. ويوجد عند المدخل الشمالي منه غرفة صغيرة كانت تستخدم للحرس، كما يوجد غرفة أكبر تقع عند بقايا الباب المزدوج عند المدخل الجنوبي للمصلّى والتي كانت تستخدم للحرس أيضًا، وهي تحتوي على محراب في مدخلها، ويوجد بئر عميق ومغلق الآن. ومن العناصر المعمارية المميزة فيه وجود قبّتان أمويتان مسطحتان تقومان فوق مدخله الجنوبي، وعندهما يوجد أعمدة حجرية ضخمة تشكل الأساس الذي تقوم عليه منطقة قبة الجامع القبلي، وقد رُممت عام 1927. بتمويل من الملك فاروق من مصر، وقد كان هذا المصلّى مغلقًا لا يُفتح إلا في حالات الضروري حتى عام 1998، حيث تم تنظيفه وإعداده ليكون مكانًا ملائمًا للصلاة، وهو يتّسع لحوالي 1000 مصلّ.\n4 - مسجد قبّة الصخرة\n\nوتعتبر قبّته إحدى أهم وأبرز المعالم المعمارية الإسلامي، وأقدم بناء إسلامي بقي محافظًا على شكله وزخرفته في الأغلب. بنى هذه القبّة الخليفة عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدأ في بنائها عام 66 هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72 هـ الموافق 691م، وأشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوة الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّة الصخرة عبارة عن بناء مثمن الأضلاع له أربعة أبواب، وفي داخله تثمينة أخرى تقوم على دعامات وأعمدة أسطوانية، في داخلها دائرة تتوسطها «الصخرة المشرفة» التي يعتقد المسلمون بأن النبي محمد صعد منها إلى السماء في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج، وترتفع هذه الصخرة نحو 1.5 مترًا عن أرضية البناء، وهي غير منتظمة الشكل يتراوح قطرها بين 13 و18 مترًا، وتوجد مغارة تُسمّى «مغارة الأرواح» أسفل جزء منها تعلوها فتحة، وتعلو الصخرة في الوسط قبّة دائرة بقطر حوالي 20 مترًا، مطلية من الخارج بألواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35م، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع 5م. ويعتقد بعض الباحثين أن بناتها خططوا لجعلها قبة للمسجد الأقصى كاملاً.\n5 - مسجد البراق\n\nويقع في الناحية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى، وسُمّي بذلك نسبةً إلى المكان الذي ربط فيه النبي محمد دابته البراق في رحلة الإسراء والمعراج، وفيه حلقة عثمانية يُقال أنّها وُضعت في مكان الحلقة التي رُبط عندها البراق. كما يحتوي المسجد على محراب أموي، وكان يوجد في جهته الغربية باب قديم يُسمّى «باب البراق» وقد اُغلق بعد العهد الأموي، والذي كان يصل مباشرة إلى ساحة البراق خارج المسجد الأقصى، وينزل إلى مصلّى البراق حاليًا من خلال الرواق الغربي للأقصى بدرجات حجرية، والذي يُفتح كل يوم جمعة للزيارة.\n6 - مسجد المغاربة\nويقع في الزاوية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى جنوبي حائط البراق، وله بابان، واحد مُغلق في الجهة الشمالية، وآخر مفتوح في الجهة الشرقية. ويُستعمل اليوم كقاعة عرض لأغراض المتحف الإسلامي الذي نُقل من الرباط المنصوري إلى هذا المسجد وذلك في عام 1348 هـ الموافق 1929. وقد قيل أنّ أوّل من بناه هو صلاح الدين الأيوبي سنة 590 هـ الموافق 1193، وكانت تُقام فيه الصلاة على المذهب المالكي.\n7 - جامع النساء\nويقع داخل المسجد الأقصى، ويمثّل الجزء الجنوبي الغربي منه، حيث يمتد بمحاذاة حائطه الجنوبي بدءًا من الجدار الغربي للجامع القِبلي وحتى الحائط الغربي للمسجد. وهو اليوم مُقسّم إلى ثلاثة أقسام: أولها غربي ملحق بالمتحف الإسلامي، وثانيها في الوسط وبه توجد مكتبة الأقصى الرئيسية، وثالثها شرقي ملاصق للجامع القبلي، ويُستعمل الآن كمستودع. وجامع النساء عبارة عن بناء كبير واسع مرتفع عن مستوى الجامع القبلي، ويرى باحثون بأن بناءه يعود إلى العهد الصليبي، حيث بُني ككنيسة، ليعيده صلاح الدين الأيوبي لمُصلّى خُصّص للنساء.\n8-مصلى باب الرحمة\n\nأنشأ الأميون باب الرحمة ليكون مشتركا بين سور القدس التاريخي والمسجد الأقصى، وبُني المصلى ملاصقا له، فمنذ العهد الأموي حتى العباسي بقي المصلى مفتوحا، وتعمد الفرنجة خلال احتلالهم للمدينة فتح المصلى في أيام عيد الفصح، وبعد تحرير القدس أغلق القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي الباب المشترك بين السور والمسجد لأسباب أمنية وأعاد استخدام المبنى للصلاة وظل كذلك في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني.أُهمل المكان في فترة الاحتلال البريطاني التي اتسمت بالتضييق على المصلين لكنه بقي مفتوحا أمامهم طيلة العهدين البريطاني والأردني، ومع مجيء الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 تم تهميش المصلى، لكنه عاد وانتعش عام 1992 عندما بات مقرا للجنة التراث الإسلامي التي حُظرت عام 2003 وكان ذلك الإجراء الذريعة التي اتخذها الاحتلال لإغلاق المصلى المستهدف، وفي العام 2018 وضعت نقطة حراسة لشرطة الاحتلال الإسرائيلي أعلى المصلى، وفي العام 2019 وضعت قوات الاحتلال قفل على البوابة المؤدية للمصلى وهو ما فجّر هبّة شعبية أدت لإعادة فتح المصلى، ومنذ إعادة فتح المصلى استهدفت شرطة الاحتلال الحراس والمصلين وكافة المبادرات الرامية لإعمار المصلى وتهيئته لاستقبال المصلين.\n\nواجهة المسجد والشرفة\nالواجهة\n\nتم بناء واجهة المسجد في عام 1065م، بناء على تعليمات من الخليفة الفاطمي المستنصر بالله. مع درابزين (بهو) يتكون من ممرات وأعمدة الصغيرة. وقد تضررت الواجهة خلال الحقبة الصليبية خلال حكمهم لفلسطين، ولكن تم ترميمها وتجديدها في العهد الأيوبي. بالإضافة إلى ذلك تم تغطية الواجهة بالبلاط. أما المواد المستعملة في أقواس الواجهة فهي مواد زينة منحوتة أخذت من الهياكل الصليبية في القدس. كما يوجد أربعة عشر قوس حجري على طول الواجهة معظمها من نمط العمارة الرومانسكية، أما الأقواس الخارجية التي أضيفت في العهد المملوكي فقد اتبعت نفس التصميم العام. كما يوجد قوس مركزي عند مدخل واجهة المسجد.\n\nالشرفة\nالشرفة تقع في الجزء العلوي من الواجهة. والخلجان المركزية من الشرفة فهي تعود لفترة فرسان الهيكل أثناء الحملة الصليبية الأولى، أما الشرفة نفسها فقد أمر ببنائها المعظم ابن العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب أخ صلاح الدين الأيوبي وذلك عام 1217م.\n\nالقباب\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى عدة قباب جميلة تعد من أبرز معالمه وإحدى التحف الإسلامية الخالدة، وأجملها كما أنها تضفي عليه جواً قدسياً، خاصة درتها قبة الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. والمعلوم أن المسجد الأقصى يحتوي على خمسة عشرة قبة وهي:\n\nقبة الصخرة\n\nقبة الصخرة هي المبنى المثمن ذو القبة الذهبية، وموقعها بالنسبة للمسجد الأقصى ككل كموقع القلب من جسد الإنسان أي أنها تقع في وسطه إلى اليسار قليلاً. وهذه القبة تعتبر هي قبة المسجد ككل، وهي من أقدم وأعظم المعالم الإسلامية المتميزة. ويعود تاريخ تاشييدها إلى العهد الأموي عام 72هـ (692م)، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى الصخرة التي تقع داخل المبنى والتي عرج منها النبي النبي محمد إلى السماء في ليلة الإسراء والمعراج على أرجح الأقوال لأن الصخرة هي أعلى بقعة في المسجد الأقصى. وقبة الصخرة هي حالياً مصلى النساء في المسجد الأقصى. والصخرة غير معلقة كما يعتقد عامة الناس، لكنه يوجد أسفلها مغارة صغيرة.\n\nقبة السلسلة.\n\nوتقع قبة السلسلة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك شرقي قبة الصخرة، وتم تشييدها بناء على أوامر الخليفة الأموي عبد الملك بن مروان عام 72هـ (692م)، ويشير ابن عبد ربه مؤلف كتاب العقد الفريد، أن سبب تسميتها بقبة السلسلة أنه كانت توجد بها سلسلة يمسها المتقاضون وأن هذه السلسلة حليف كل صديق في القول وأنها تبتعد عن كل من يكذب وتربط هذه الروايات بين هذه السلسلة وتلك التي كان يتخذها النبي داود لحسم النزاع بين الخصوم في مجلس القضاء، وهذا لاشك من الخزعبلات غير المقبولة.\nومن المعروف أن هذه القبة قد تعرضت للانتهاك أثناء الحملات الصليبية وأعيد تجديدها عدة مرات منذ استرداد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بيت المقدس وقد أوقفت سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني عمليات الترميم التي كانت جارية بها في عام 1970م ، ثم استكملت في التسعينات من القرن الماضي.\nوقبة السلسلة هي على شكل سداسي يحملها مضلع مسدس مؤلف داخلياً من ستة أعمدة، تحمل تحمل بدورها العقود التي يرتكز عليها عامود القبة، وخارجها أحد عشر عموداً تحمل عقوداً مماثلة وقد سد فيما بعد بين اثنين من هذه الأعمدة لإنشاء المحراب الموجود بها وعلى ذلك فإن لهذه القبة سبعة عشر عموداً، وقد كسيت هذه القبة ببلاطات من القاشاني التركي عند ترميمها في عهد السلطان سليمان القانوني في القرن 16م.\n\nقبة النحوية.\n\nتقع القبة النحوية في الطرف الجنوب الغربي لساحة قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الأيوبي عام 1207 على يد الأمير حسام الدين أبي معد قمباز في عهد الملك شرف الدين أبو المنصور عيسى الأيوبي، لتكون مدرسة متخصصة لتعليم العلوم اللغوية من صرف ونحو داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، فعرفت بالقبة النحوية، وأيضا المدرسة النحوية.\nتتكون القبة من ثلاث غرف متصلة، حيث تقوم قبتها الكبرى فوق الغرفة الغربية، بينما توجد قبة أخرى أقل ارتفاعا فوق الغرفة الشرقية، ولها مدخل رّئيسي يقع في واجهتها الشّمالية.\nتحولت القبة النحوية إلى مكتبة في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وتستعمل اليوم كمقر لمحكمة الاستئناف الشرعية (وهو جزء من المحكمة الشرعية في القدس، والذي يتبع بدوره للأردن)، واسمها الدقيق الآن هو: مكتب القائم بأعمال قاضي القضاة، ومن تحتها أرشيف المحكمة.\nوقد حماها هذا الاستعمال هو من أخطار الاحتلال، حيث أنها تشرف بشكل واضح على حائط البراق من داخل الأقصى المبارك، كما تشرف على بابي المغاربة وباب السلسلة. ولذلك تعتبر نقطةً ساخنةً عند وقوع اعتداءات صهيونية على المسجد الأقصى المبارك، كما حدث في انتفاضة الأقصى عام 2000م، حيث اقتحم الصهاينة الأقصى من باب السلسلة، وسيطروا على القبة النحوية، ومن ثم سيطروا على الجهة الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وقتلوا شهيدا عند باب المغاربة، وقد استشهد 5 مصلين برصاص الاحتلال في ذلك اليوم، فضلا عن إصابة العشرات.\n\nقبة الأرواح\nوتقع قبة الأرواح داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك بالقرب من قبة المعراج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني في منتصف القرن 16م.\nوقد شيدت هذه القبة على مضلع مثمن الأضلاع يتألف من ثمانية أعمدة رخامية تحمل ثمانية عقود حجرية وهي قبة قليلة الارتفاع بعض الشيء.\n\nقبة النبي سليمان\n\nوتقع قبة النبي سليمان داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك من الجهة الشمالية ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الأموي وعلى الأرجح في عهد الخليفة سليمان بن عبد الملك.\nوتقوم هذه القبة أيضا على بناء مثمن يبدأ بأربعة من الرخام وتم تخصيص واحدة منها لباب الدخول يواجه المحراب، وفوق المثمن تم تشييد عامود أسطواني وقد فتحت به ثمانية نوافذ معقودة للإضاءة، وفوق هذا العامود خوذة القبة وهي حجرية متينة البنيان وبداخل هذه القبة توجد صخرة صغيرة.\n\nقبة الخضر\n\nوتقع قبة الخضر داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك في الزاوية الشمالية الغربية لساحة قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى الفترة العثمانية، وتقوم هذه القبة على ستة أعمدة رخامية رشيقة وتحمل هذه الأعمدة عقودا حجرية مدببة ومزخرفة.\n\nقبة المعراج\n\nوتقع قبة المعراج داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك إلى الشمال الغربي من قبة الصخرة. وشيدت عام 1200م بأمر من الأمير عز الدين الزنجلي والي القدس في عهد السلطان العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب. وتم تشييدها لتخليد ذكرى المعراج، وتذكر بعض المصادر أن هذه القبة بنيت مكان قبة أخرى قديمة تعود إلى عهد عبد الملك بن مروان، وقد أشار إلى وجودها الرحالة ناصر بن خسرو قبل استيلاء الصليبيين على المدينة وهدمهم لها.\n\nويعتبر التصميم المعماري للقبة فريد من نوعه وهو مثمن الشكل مثل قبة الصخرة المجاورة له، ونجد في كل ركن من أركان المثمن أربعة أعمدة مدمجة إلا الجهة الجنوبية التي بها عمودان ليصبح مجموع الأعمدة ثلاثين عمودا، وتحمل الأعمدة ثمانية عقود مدببة سدت فتحاتها بالرخام فيما عدا ضلع واحد يقع في الناحية الجنوبية، وقد شيد به محراب حجري تبرز حنيته من الخارج، ويقابله ضلع آخر في الناحية الشمالية فتح به باب الدخول إلى القبة، وقد شيدت خوذة القبة بعد تحويل أعلى المثمن إلى دائرة، وتتميز هذه القبة بوجود قبة أخرى صغيرة فوقها، بما يشبه التاج فوق رأسها.\nوالقبة تستخدم اليوم من قبل لجنة الإعمار في المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nقبة الميزان\n\nتقع قبة الميزان في الركن الجنوبي من صحن الصخرة المشرفة، ملاصقة للبائكة الجنوبية، والمعلوم أن بوائك الأقصى تعرف أيضا بالموازيين، ومنه جاءت تسمية القبة باسم قبة الميزان. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى الفترة المملوكية على يد قاضي القضاة برهان الدين بن جماعة الذي أنشأها عام 1388م، قبة الميزان وتعرف أيضا بمنبر برهان الدين وذلك لأنها على هيئة منبر فوقه قبة.\nوقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين أن المنبر في بداية عهده كان عبارة عن منبر خشبي جميل في شكله، وفي عام 1388م أعيد بناء المنبر بالكامل من الحجر على النمط الهندسي الذي تشتهر به المنابر المملوكية المعروفة بنقشها وجمالها.\nويتكون هذا المنبر من بناء حجري، وله مدخل يقوم في أعلاه عقد يرتكز على عمودين صغيرين من الرخام. ويُصعد منه إلى درجات قليلة تؤدي إلى دكة حجرية معدة لجلوس الخطيب، وتقوم فوقها قبة لطيفة صغيرة، وقد أقيمت على أعمدة رخامية جميلة الشكل.\nوقدد جُدّد المنبر مرتين الأولى في عهد السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد بن محمود الثاني عام 1843م، والثانية في أواخر سنة 2000م، على يد مجموعة من الطلبة الإيطاليين، وذلك عن طريق دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nقبة يوسف آغا\nتقع القبة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك على الجانب الغربي من الجامع القبلي، وتم تشييدها عام 1092هـ (1681م) بأمر من يوسف آغا الوالي العثماني على القدس، وقد كانت على ما يبدو مخصصة للعبادة على مقربة من الجامع القبلي. وهي تغطي هذه القبة مساحة مربعة شيدت بمداميك من الأحجار المشذبة وقد فتحت ثلاثة جدران بكاملها تقريباً على ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وذلك باستخدام عقود مدببة بينما شيد المحراب في الجدار الجنوبي، وهو محراب مجوف بسيط.\n\nقبة النبي موسى\n\nوتقع قبة النبي موسى داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك على بالقرب من البائكة الجنوبية الغربية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1250م في عهد الملك الصالح نجم الدين أيوب بن الملك الكامل الأيوبي، ويبدو من تصميمها أنها كانت مخصصة لتعبد أمراء الأيوبيين عند زيارتهم للقدس أو لبعض المشاهير والشيوخ بعد ذلك.\nوالقبة هي مربعة الجدران فتحت بها نوافذ للإضاءة ، ويقع المدخل في الضلع الشمالي المواجه لجدار القبة ومن ناحية الشكل فقد تم تحويل المربع إلى مثمن، وقد فتحت في أضلاع المثمن نوافذ للإضاءة ، وبعد ذلك تم تشييد خوذة القبة المثمنة.\n\nقبة النبي\nوتقع قبة النبي داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك غرب قبة الصخرة، بجوار قبة المعراج ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1538 بأمر من محمد بك والي غزة والقدس الشريف ثم أعاد تشييدها السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الأول عام 1845، أما عن سبب تسميتها فيعتقد بعض المؤرخين أنها بنيت في المكان الذي صلى فيه النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم إماما بالأنبياء والملائكة في ليلة الإسراء، حيث تشير بعض النصوص إلى أنّ المعراج كان على يمين الصخرة، ويقول الباحثون إن هذا سبب تعدد القباب على يمين قبة الصخرة.\nكما يعتبر محراب النبي هو أول ما تم تشييده في هذه القبة، وقد أمر بتشييدها محمد بك والي غزة والقدس الشريف في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني في عام 1538م، والمحراب هو على هيئة مستطيل رخامي لا يرتفع عن الأرض كثيراً، وفي نهايته شكل ثلاثي الأضلاع أكثر ارتفاعاً من بقية المستطيل.\nوفي عام 1845م، قام السلطان عبد المجيد الثاني بتشييد قبة فوق هذا المحراب ومنها جاءت تسميتها، وهي مثمنة الشكل قاعدتها من ثمانية أعمدة رخامية رشيقة تحمل ثمانية من العقود الحجرية المدببة.\n\nقبة يوسف\n\nتقع قبة يوسف داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك جنوب قبة الصخرة، ويعود تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني عام 1681 م. وسميت القبة بقبة يوسف تيمناً وتذكاراً بيوسف بن أيوب المعروف بالناصر صلاح الدين الأيوبي. وتقوم هذه القبة على بناء مربع تتألف قاعدته من عمودين رخاميين رشيقين وجدار في ناحية القِبلة، ومن ثم فهي عبارة عن ثلاثة عقود مفتوحة وجدار مسدود وبوسط هذا الجدار حنية صغيرة تشبه المحاريب المجوفة وبداخلها نص على لوح يحمل اسم صلاح الدين الأيوبي، وهذا اللوح مأخوذ من برج بناه السلطان صلاح الدين على سور المدينة عند الخندق. وخلف هذا النص من الخارج يوجد نص أخر يبين أعمال البناء التي أجريت في العهد العثماني، واسم المشرف على البناء وهو علي أغا يوسف أغا.\n\nقبة عشاق النبي\nتقع قبة عشاق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، في الركن الجنوب الشرقي من باب العتم، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 1817م في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الثاني، ولهذا السبب تعرف باسم إيوان السلطان محمود الثاني. وأما اسمها الحالي فمصدره اعتياد بعض شيوخ الصوفية الاجتماع للذكر تحتها.\nوهي عبارة عن مبنـى مربع الشكل طول ضلعه 7 أمتار، قائم على أربع دعائم ركنيّة تعلوها أربعة عقود مدببة تعلوها قبـة ضحلة. والمبنى مفتوح الجوانب، وبه محراب حجري مجوف جميل أضيف في فترة لاحقة في وسط الجهة الجنوبيّة. ويصعد إلـى صحن هذه القبة من خلال ثلاث درجات من الجهتين الغربية والشرقيّة، وأرضيتها مبلّطة بالحجر، وعلى حافتها من الجهة الشمالية عمودان نائمان يبدو أنّهما وضعا في زمن متأخّر كدربزين\n\nقبة الشيخ الخليلي.\n\nتقع قبة الشيخ الخليلي في صحن الصخرة، في جزء الشمال الغربي من قبة الصخرة، وتفصل بينهما قبتا النبي والمعراج. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد العثماني عام 1700م، وعرفت باسم شيخ صوفي كان يؤمها ويتعبد فيها، وتعرف كذلك بقبة بخ بخ، ومصلى الخضر، ومسجد النبي.\nوالقبة هي عبارة عن مبنى مربّع مقام على أربعة أركان، تعلوه قبّة ضحلة على الطراز العثماني، وفي الجهات الأربع ثماني نوافذ مستطيلة الشكل. حيث يقع في واجهة المبنى الشرقيّة باب صغير يعلوه نقش يحمل اسم وتاريخ المبنى. ويوجد بداخل هذه القبة من جهة القبلة محراب من حجر كلسي ملكي فيه حنية حجريّة، وتحت مبنى قبة الخليلي يوجد مبنى سفلي يسمى مغارة الأرواح، يتوصل إليه من خلال سلم حجري مقطوع من الصخر، وهذا الكهف قليل التهوية عديم النور ولا يستعمل.\nوتستعمل القبة اليوم كمكتب للجنة إعمار المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nقبة النبي عيسى/ مهد النبي عيسى\n\nوتقع قبة النبي عيسى والمسماة أيضا مهد النبي عيسى عند الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية لسور القدس وسور المسجد الأقصى، وتم تشييده لتخليد ذكرى النبي عيسى، ورغم التجديدات التي لحقت به على مر العصور فهو يحتفظ بطابعه الأصلي والأساسي والذي ورد في أوصاف المؤرخين والرحالة الذين عاينوا هذا المكان المعروف باسم مهد النبي عيسى ومسجده. وجددت القبة في العهد العثماني على نفس طرازها القديم وهي محمولة على أربعة عقود مدببة تستند بدورها على أربعة أعمدة رخامية رشيقة، وتحت هذه القبة يوجد حوض حجري يسمى مهد النبي عيسى، وأمام هذا الحوض يوجد محراب حجري مجوف.\n\nالماَذن\nللمسجد أربع مآذن وهي:\n\nمئذنة باب المغاربة/ المئذنة الفخارية\n\nتعتبر مئذنة المغاربة وتسمى أيضا المئذنة الفخارية أول مئذنة تشيد في المسجد في عام 1278م، وتقع على الزاوية الجنوبية الغربية من المسجد الأقصى، وهي قريبة من باب المغاربة وتحديدا فوق الطرف الشمالي الغربي لجامع النساء الواقع داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، بناء على أوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين. وسميت بالفخارية نسبة إلى فخر الدين الخليلي، والد القاضي شرف الدين عبد الرحمن الذي أشرف على بناء المبنى. وتم بناء المئذنة على الطراز السوري التقليدي، مع وجود قاعدة مربعة الشكل وعامود، مقسوم إلى ثلاثة طوابق ويقع فوق الطابقين الأولين شرفة المؤذن. ويحيط الشرفة غرفة مربعة التي تنتهي بدورها إلى قبة حجرية مغطاة بالرصاص.\n\nمئذنة باب الغوانمة\nوتعتبر مئذنة الغوانمة المئذنة الثانية التي تشيد في المسجد، وقد بناها المهندس المعماري القاضي شرف الدين الخليلي مابين 1297–98م،  وهي أيضا بناء على الأوامر من بناء على أوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين، وتقع في الركن الشمالي الغربي من الحرم القدسي الشريف بالقرب من باب الغوانمة . وتتكون من ستة طوابق عالية ونوازل، وهي أطول مئذنة في الحرم القدسي. وبرج المئذنة كلياً هو مصنوع من الحجر تقريبا، بصرف النظر عن القبة الخشبية التي تقع على شرفة المؤذن، وبقيت مئذنة باب الغوانمة تقريبا بمنأى عن الهزات الأرضية بسبب هيكلها الراسخ. والمئذنة تنقسم إلى عدة طوابق مشكلة من الحجارة .ويعتبر الطابقين الأولين أوسع من بقية الطوابق، ويشكلا قاعدة البرج. ويعلو كلا من أربعة الطوابق الباقية عمود أسطواني وقبة بصلية الشكل (منتفخة). أما الدرج فهو يقع خارج الطابقين الأول والثاني، ولكنه يصبح على شكل لولبي داخل الطابق الثالث حتى تصل إلى شرفة المؤذن.\n\nمئذنة باب السلسلة\n\nتعتبر مئذنة السلسلة المئذنة الثالثة التي تشيد في المسجد وذلك في عام 1329 م بناء على أوامر الأمير سيف الدين تنكز الناصري الحاكم المملوكي على الشام، في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون وذلك وفق ما جاء بالنقش التذكاري الموجود في الجهة الشرقية من قاعدة المئذنة:\n\nوتقع مئذنة باب السلسلة على الحدود الغربية من المسجد الأقصى شمال باب السلسلة وتسمى أيضا بمنارة المحكمة. وربما تكون هذه المئذنة حلت محل المئذنة الأموية في وقت سابق، ومبنى البرج هو مربع الشكل ومصنوع بالكامل من الحجارة. ومنذ القرن 16، فقد كان التقليد المتبع هو اختيار أفضل مؤذن في المدينة وتم تعيينه في هذه المئذنة للنداء إلى كل من الصلوات الخمس، ويتم رفع الآذان من هذه المئذنة أولا، لإعطاء الإشارة لمؤذني المساجد الأخرى في جميع أنحاء القدس على أن تحذو حذوها.\n\nمئذنة باب الأسباط/ مئذنة الصلاحية\n\nتعتبر مئذنة الأسباط المئذنة الرابعة للمسجد وآخر مئذنة تشيده عليه وذلك في سنة 1367 كما أنها تسمى أيضا بمئذنة الصلاحية لكونها واقعة في جهة المدرسة الصلاحية الواقعة خارج المسجد الأقصى المبارك،  وتقع هذه المئذنة في الجهة الشمالية للحرم القدسي الشريف، بين باب حطة وباب الأسباط، وقد بُنِيَت بأمر من الأمير سيف الدين قطلوبغا وهو ناظر الحرمين الشريفين في عهد السلطان المملوكي الأشرف شعبان، وذلك وفقاً للنقش التذكاري الذي كان موجوداً عليها:\n\nومئذنة الأسباط هي عبارة برج حجر أسطواني (بني في وقت لاحق في العهد العثمانيين) وليست مربعة المآذن الأخرى، ويبدأ برج المئذنة صعودا من قاعدة مستطيلة تعود للعهد المملوكي. ويضيق فوق شرفة المؤذن، وتنتشر فيه نوافذ دائرية، وتنتهي بقبة بصلية الشكل (منتفخة). وقد أعيد بناء القبة بعد وقوع زلزال وادي الأردن عام 1927.\nومن الجدير للذكر أنه لا وجود للمآذن في الجزء الشرقي من المسجد الآقصى المبارك. ومع ذلك، أعلن عبد الله الثاني ملك الأردن في عام 2006 عن نيته لبناء المئذنة الخامسة لتطل على جبل الزيتون. ومن المقرر أن تحمل المئذنة اسم حسين ملك الأردن كما أنها سيكون أطول مبنى في البلدة القديمة من القدس.\n\nأبواب المسجد الأقصى\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على خمسة عشر باب منها ما هو مستعمل (مفتوح) في أيامنا هذه وعددها عشرة، والبقية مغلقة منذ زمن بعيد لأسباب عديدة،: وتقع جميع الأبواب المفتوحة في الجهة الشمالية والغربية من المسجد، وهي في الوقت نفسه تقع ضمن أسوار المسجد الأقصى.\nأبواب المسجد الأقصى تشترك جميعها في أنها أبواب خشبية مكونة من دفة أو دفتين، وتشتمل على خوخة «فتحة» لتنظيم المرور استعملت لمرور المتأخرين بعد إغلاق الأبواب عند الغروب.\nوقد برع المسلمون في الأعمال الخشبية وتفننوا في زخرفتها وإظهار تفصيلاتها والعناية بدقائقها كالمزاليج والمفاتيح والمفاصل وغيرها من الأمور التي تؤكد.\n\nالأبواب المفتوحة\nباب الأسباط/ باب الأُسود\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب الأًسود نسبة للأسدين المنحوتين على جانبي الباب ، ويقع في الزاوية الشمالية الشرقية للمسجد الأقصى، ويعود تاريخ تجديد بنائه إلى الفترة الأيوبية، كما تم تجديد الباب في الفترة المملوكية في 1367م.\nوالواجهة الجنوبية لهذا الباب هي مدخل بارتفاع 4 أمتار تقريباً وفتحة مستطيلة بعقد مدبب، وفي زاوية المدخل توجد دركاة مربعة الشكل تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وللباب دفتان من الخشب يبدو أنهما حديثتا العهد، ويوجد في أحد الدفتين خوخة (مدخل صغير) تسمح بدخول شخص واحد فقط، ويعد مدخل الدركاة أحد أقواس الرواق الشمالي الضخمة المدببة. أما الواجهة الشمالية للباب فهي فتحة مستطيلة لقوس مدبب عرضه 2 متر تقريباً وارتفاعه 4 أمتار كما أن المدخل مسقوف بقنطرة مدببة عرضها حوالي 1 متر.\n\nباب حطة\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى وتحديدا ضمن الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الشمالي. وقد تم تجديده عام 1220م في الفترة الأيوبية في عهد شرف الدين أبو المنصور عيسى الأيوبي. وتتكون واجهته الجنوبية التي تقع داخل المسجد من باب مستطيل ذي عقد حجري موتور، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في إحداها خوخة صغيرة، ويتقدمه دركاة وهي جزء من الرواق الشمالي أيضا مدخلها عبارة عن عقد حجري مدبب يعلوه صف من الكوابل الحجرية عددها تسعة كوابل، يزداد قطرها كلما ارتفعنا لأعلى الباب، وبين فتحة الباب وهذه الكوابل يوجد ثلاثة زخارف دائرية بارزة على مركز الفتحة وأطرافها.\n\nباب العتم\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب فيصل نسبة إلى الملك فيصل الأول. وقد جدد بناء هذا الباب في الفترة الأيوبية، في أيام الملك المعظم ابن الملك العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب سنة 1213، وذلك عند تجديد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى. كما أنه يعرف ولهذا الباب عدة أسماء فهو باب الدوددارية، وباب الملك فيصل، وباب شرف الأنبياء.\nوتتكون واجهة الباب الجنوبية من فتحة ارتفاعها 4 أمتار، وعليها باب خشبي من دفتين يتقدمه من الجهة الجنوبية دركاة تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وهي مغطاة بعقد صليبي ومدخل الدركاة عبارة عن قوس مدبب ضخم، وهو يقع ضمن سلسلة أقواس الرواق الشمالي\n\nباب الغوانمة/باب الوليد\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويعتبر أول باب يشيد في الجدار الغربي ابتداء من الناحية الشمالية، وقد أنشئ في العهد الأموي، وعرف آنذاك باسم باب الوليد نسبة إلى الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد جدد الباب عام 1307م وذلك عند إنشاء الرواق الغربي للمسجد في عهد قلاوون، والباب مستطيل الشكل نسبة عرضه إلى ارتفاعه لباقي أبواب المسجد تعد قليلة، وعلى المدخل باب خشبي من دفة واحدة من الخشب يوجد به خوخة صغيرة لتمييزها من الباب ويتقدم الباب من الجهة الشرقية دهليز معقود بعقد برميلي واجهته عقد حجري مدبب، يرقى للباب بواسطة ثماني درجات عن ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبلطة، وبجانب الباب عقد مدبب آخر لكنه مغلق.\n\nباب الناظر\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، يقع في الجدار الغربي لساحة المسجد الأقصى، وقد جدد بناؤه في الفترة الأيوبية سنة 1203م في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى بن أحمد، وله عدة أسماء أخرى متداولة مثل باب الحبس لقربه من الحبس أيام العثمانيين، وباب المجلس .\nويتقدم الباب من الجهة الشرقية دركاة مربعة تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق الغربي، وتغطيها قبة مرفوعة على ثلاثة صفوف من المقرنصات، أما فتحة الباب فهي عبارة عن مستطيل ضخم ارتفاعه 4,5 متر وعرضه 2 متر، ويعلو الفتحة المستطيلة قوس موتور تعلوه زخرفة على شكل رواق صغير، وتنفصل مساحة الدركاة عن بقية الرواق بأقواس مدببة. وعلى الدعامة التي تقع على عقد المدخل المدبب والعقد المجاور له من عقود الرواق يوجد نقش حجري، ويبين النقش تاريخ البناء والسلطان الذي جدد في عهده. ويتقدم الباب قنطرة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع يؤدي إلى طريق باب الناظر المؤدية إلى طريق الواد. وفي الجهة الجنوبية من القنطرة مدخل يؤدي بواسطة درج حجري، وفي الجهة الشمالية مدخل المدرسة المنجكية.\n\nباب الحديد\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية للمسجد الأقصى، وهو أحد المداخل المتفرعة عن طريق باب العمود. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى الأمير أرغون الذي يعني باللغة التركية الـحديد، وقد جدد في عهده بين سنتي 755هـــ و758هـــ/1354-1357م، والباب عبارة عن فتحة مستطيلة بعقد، ويتقدمه من الواجهة الشرقية دركاة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع، وباب الحديد على شكل قوس حذوي مدبب على جانبيه مداميك حجرية بارتفاع 60 سم تقريبا، ويعلو الباب واجهة تعود للفترة المملوكية، وتتوسط هذه الواجهة نافذة معقودة بعقد مدبب زخرف بخطوط متعرجة.\n\nباب القطانين\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الجهة الغربية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، ويعد من الأبواب الرئيسية الهامة والجميلة المؤدية للمسجد، ويؤدي هذا الباب إلى سوق القطانين ومنه جاءت تسميته، وقد جدد هذا الباب في عهد السلطان قلاوون على يد الأمير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1336م، وهذا واضح من خلال نقش يوجد في أعلى المدخل من الجهة الشرقية المطلة على ساحة الحرم القدسي، وقد أزيلت على يد المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى سنة 1922م. والواجهة الشمالية للباب مكونة من قوصرة مدخل تنخفض عن مستوى الساحة بتسع درجات تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، وهذه القوصرة واسعة حيث يبلغ عرضها 7 أمتار تقريباً وارتفاعها 13 متر، وهي مغطاة بنصف قبة من الحجر. وأما المفتاح فهو أسود اللون ونصف القبة مقامة على خمسة صفوف من المقرنصات، وفتحة الباب مستطيلة بارتفاع 4 أمتار وعرض 2,5 متر ويعلو الباب عتب حجري مستقيم وهو مكون من ثلاث قطع خارجية.\n\nباب المطهرة\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، ويؤدي إلى المتوضأ (مكان الوضوء)، ولذلك سمي بباب المطهرة، وقد جدد في العهد المملوكي سنة 1266م، على يد الأمير آدغيدي، وهناك من يرى انه جدد سنة 1267م على يد الأمير علاء الدين البصيري، وتتكون الواجهة الغربية للباب من عقد حجري مدبب، وهو يخلو من أي عنصر معماري مزخرف، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين في إحداها خوخة صغيرة والباب بارتفاع 3,5 متر تقريبا، وعرضه 2 متر، أما الجهة الشرقية من الباب فهو فتحة مستطيلة في عقد حجري موتور عليه مدماكان من الحجر، ويتقدمه دركاة مغطاة بقبو متقاطع، وهي جزء من الرواق الغربي.\n\nباب السلسلة والسكينة/باب النبي داود\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة ويسمى أيضا باب النبي داود، ويقع في الواجهة الغربية من ساحة المسجد الأقصى ضمن الرواق الغربي، ويعد من الأبواب الرئيسية المؤدية إلى المسجد الأقصى، وهناك من يعتبرهما بابين منفصلين وليس باباً واحداً بمدخلين. أما الباب الأول والمسمى بباب السلسلة، فهو مفتوح ويؤمه الزائرون للمسجد الأقصى، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم للاعتقاد بوجود سلسلة كانت معلقة فيه أو ربما لوجود علاقة ما تربطه بقبة السلسلة، أما الآخر فهو باب السكينة، وهو يقع شمال باب السلسلة، وهو ملاصق له، والباب لا يفتح إلا في حالات الطوارئ والضرورة القصوى، وقد جدد هذان البابان في الفترة الأيوبية سنة 1203م، في عهد السلطان الملك العادل سيف الدين أبو بكر، وهناك من يرى أنه في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى، ويتكون المدخل من بابين متسعين بارتفاع 4,5 متر وعرض 2 متر والفتحة مستطيلة بقوس موتور عليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في إحداهما خوخة صغيرة لتنظيم المرور إلى المسجد الأقصى.\n\nباب المغاربة\n\nهو إحدى أبواب المسجد الأقصى المفتوحة، ويقع في الزاوية الغربية الجنوبية لساحة المسجد الأقصى، وسمي بباب المغاربة لأنه يوصل إلى حارة المغاربة غرب الأقصى، ويعرف أيضا بباب البراق، وباب النبي، حيث يعتقد أن الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم دخل منه إلى المسجد الأقصى المبارك ليلة الإسراء والمعراج، كما يعتقد بعض المؤرخين أن عمر بن الخطاب دخل منه إلى الأقصى أيضا بعد الفتح، حيث أورد ابن كثير: \n\nوقد أعيد بناؤه في الفترة المملوكية في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون الذي قام بإنشاء الأروقة الغربية ما بين سنة 1305م- 1336م،  والباب من الواجهة الغربية معقود بعقد مدبب بسيط التكوين. أما الجهة الشرقية فهو عبارة عن فتحة مستطيلة ، وهو على شكل قوس موتور عليه باب خشبي بدفة واحدة، ويفضي من الجهة الشرقية إلى دركاة تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق، وهي مؤلفة من عقدين حجريين، وتقوم على ثلاث دعامات، وعلى مركز الدعامة الوسطى زخرفة حجرية بشكل مربع في وسطه دائرة، ويغطيها قبوان متقاطعان، ويجاور الباب من الجهة الشمالية مسجد صغير يسمى مسجد البراق.\n\nالأبواب المغلقة\nالباب المنفرد\nهو أحد المداخل الجنوبية المغلقة في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من سور مدينة القدس والمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وقد أغلق بطريقة متقنة للغاية حتى لا يظهر للباب أي أثر من داخل أسوار المسجد، وقد سمي بباب الوحيد المفرد والمغلق الذي يظهر للعيان، وقد اشتهر عند المؤرخين العرب باسم باب العين لأنه يؤدي إلى عين سلوان.\n\nالباب الثلاثي\n\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، وهو عبارة عن ثلاث بوابات متجاورة تقع في الجدار الجنوبي من سور المسجد الأقصى على بعد 50 متراً من البوابة المفردة، و80 متراً من البوابة المزدوجة. وهذه البوابات شامخة العلو بجوار بعضها البعض، اتساع كلٍ منها 13 قدماً، وقد اشتهرت عند المؤرخين والكتّاب العرب باسم بوابات محراب مريم أو باب محراب مريم، وهذا الباب قديم العهد يعود إلى عصر أدريانوس باني القدس سنة 135م، وهو مغلق منذ أوائل القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nالباب المزدوج\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، وهو باب بمدخلين مزدوجين مغلقين، يقع في الجهة الجنوبية من سور الجامع الأقصى خلف منبر الإمام تماماً حيث يؤدي إلى أسفل الجامع الأقصى عبر ممداخل مائلة، ويبعد عن الباب الثلاثي مسافة 80 متراً. وهو باب قديم جداً يعود تاريخه إلى البيزنطيين، ومن أسماء هذا الباب: بوابة خلدة، بوابة الأقصى القديمة، وبوابة النبي.\n\nالباب الذهبي (باب الرحمة والتوبة)\n\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، ويكاد أن يكون الباب الوحيد في الجهة الشرقية الشمالية للسور لولا وجود باب صغير يسمى باب الجنائز، وهناك من يرى ان الباب الذهبي أسس قبل الفتح الإسلامي للمدينة، إلا أنه لم يبق من ذلك البناء سوى الموقع، وربما لمسات من التصميم العام، وقد أعيد بناؤه مرات عديدة بعد ذلك، منها ما كان بعد جلاء الفرس عن القدس ودخول الإمبراطور هرقل، وأما البناء الأخير فقد تم في العصر الأموي، والباب الذهبي في حقيقة الأمر مكون من بابين الرحمة والتوبة، أما اغلاقهما فيرجح أنهما أغلقا في عهد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعد إخراجه الصليبيين من القدس، وذلك لأسباب أمنية، وهناك من يقول أنهما أغلقا بأمر الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب للأسباب نفسها، ومهما يكن فان الحصيلة هي أن هذه الابواب مغلقة منذ زمن ولم تفتح إلى يومنا هذا. أما اسم الباب الذهبي فقد أطلقه عليه المسيحيون لاعتقادهم أن السيد المسيح سيمر من خلاله عند رجوعه، وهم يؤمنون بأنه كان قد دخل منه فعلاً في أحد الشعانين.\n\nباب الجنائز\nوهو إحدى أبواب المسجد المغلقة، يقع في السور الشرقي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك يؤدي إلى المقبرة المجاورة بعد الصلاة عليها في المسجد الأقصى، وهو باب صغير لا يستخدم حاليا. تظهر آثاره من خلف الخزائن الحديدية التي يستعملها حراس باب الأسباط في المكان، لكن المرجح أنه كان يقع جنوبي باب الرحمة. وعلى أي حال، فيحتمل أن يكون قد وجد في التاريخ بابان بهذا الاسم، حيث يمكن أن يكون الباب قديماً كان جنوب باب الرحمة، ومن ثم تحول في فترات متأخرة (على الأصح الفترة العثمانية) إلى قرب باب الأسباط.\nكان هذا الباب يستخدم لإخراج الجنائز من المسجد الأقصى المبارك إلى مقبرة الرحمة المحاذية للسور الشرقي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وأغلق على الأرجح بأمر من السلطان صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعد تحرير القدس في 583هـ - 1187م، لحماية المسجد والمدينة من أي غزو محتمل.\n\nالمساطب\nالأروقة\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على رواقان يمتدان من جهته الشمالية والغربية وهما\n\nالرواق الغربي\nوهو ممر مسقوف يتكون من 55 عقدا، ويمتد بطول الواجهة الغربية للمسجد الأقصى، بنى على عدة مراحل في العهد المملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1307 و1336م بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافة المعالم الموجودة في المنطقة الغربية للمسجد المبارك.\n\nالرواق الشمالي\nهو ممر مسقوف بطول الواجهة الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى، وقد بني على عدة مراحل في العهدين الأيوبي والمملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1213 و1367م، بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافة المعالم الموجودة في المنطقة الشمالية للمسجد.\nواليوم يتكون الرواق من عدة مدارس، ولم يتبق أي جزء منه.\n\nالمدارس\nتتميز بيوت العبادة في الإسلام بكونها دور عبادة وعلم في آنٍ واحد، حيث نجد أن الكثير من المساجد تعتبر جامعا وجامعة في آن واحد. ولذا حرص المسلمون منذ العصور الإسلامية المبكرة على إقامة المدارس في المسجد الأقصى المبارك، ووقفها على الشيوخ والطلاب الذين يرابطون في هذا الموضع الشريف طلبا للعلم والثواب. وتنتشر مدارس المسجد الأقصى المبارك في الرواقين الشمالي والغربي للمسجد، وبعضها يمتد خارج سور المسجد المبارك ملاصقا له، وكلها تعتبر جزءا لا يتجزأ من الأقصى الشريف، ونذكر منها \n\nمدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع هذه المدارس داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين بابي حطة وفيصل. أنشئت في مطلع الثمانينات من القرن العشرين. ولها فروع عديدة بعضها خارج المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسة البكرية/الدوادارية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع على الحد الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك من الخارج إلى الشمال من مدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية، وهي مدرسة كبيرة من مدارس البلدة القديمة، وتمتد غربا حتى المدرسة العمرية، وكانت تعرف حتى أواسط القرن العشرين باسم «المدرسة الدوادارية»، نسبة لبانيها الأمير علم الدين سنجر الدوادار، سنة 695هـ -1295م.\nوقد ظلت المدرسة البكرية تستعمل كمدرسة أكاديمية ابتدائية حتى مجيء الاحتلال الصهيوني حيث حول الجزء الأكبر منها إلى مدرسة للمعاقين تخضع لإدارة دائرة المعارف التابعة لبلدية القدس المحتلة منذ عام 1967م.\nثانوية الأقصى الشرعية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، غلب عليها هذا الاسم لأنها كانت عند إنشائها في مطلع الثمانينيات من القرن العشرين ثانوية محضة، واليوم هي عبارة عن مدرسة إعدادية وثانوية لطلبة الفرع الشرعي من الذكور.\n\nالمدرسة الغادرية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عهد السلطان المملوكي برسباي عام 1432م على يد مصر خاتون زوجة الأمير ناصر الدين بن دلغادر، ومنه جاءت تسميتها.\nتم تجديدها من قبل دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية، لكن سلطات الاحتلال منعت تتمة السقف، ولا زالت بلا سقف حتى اليوم.\nوالحقيقة أن هذا هو حال معظم مدارس الأقصى اليوم، التي أهملت بسبب مزاعم الصهاينة أنها تحوي آثارا يهودية، مما أدى إلى إهمال الكثير من المدارس القديمة وإغلاقها، أو تأجيرها للسكنى.\n\nالمدرسة الباسطية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع فوق مدارس ورياض الأقصى الإسلامية الواقعة داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك بين بابي حطة والعتم. ويعتبر شمس الدين محمد الهروي شيخ الصلاحية وناظر الحرمين في العهد المملوكي أول من بدأ بتشييدها، ولكن أدركته المنية قبل عمارتها، فعمرها القاضي زين الدين عبد الباسط بن خليل الدمشقي، سنة 835هـ -1431م، وحملت المدرسة اسمه.\nوقد كانت المدرسة الباسطية مدرسة عظيمة اشتهرت في أرجاء العالم الإسلامي، حيث تخرج منها العديد من العلماء ودرس فيها العديد من الحفاظ ورواة الحديث والأطباء وعلماء الفلك والرياضيات. وهي اليوم عبارة عن قسمين: واحد مأهول بجماعة من آل جار الله، والآخر يستعمل مقرا للمدرسة البكرية.\n\nالمدرسة الأمينية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع غربي باب العتم في السور الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى، ويحدها من الشرق الطريق الداخل إلى باب العتم، ومن الشمال طريق المجاهدين، ومن الغرب المدرسة الفارسية، ومن الجنوب ساحة المسجد الأقصى المبارك. وهي مؤلفة من أربعة طوابق. وتسمى أيضا دار الإمام، حيث درّس فيها أجداد عائلة الإمام واتخذت دارا لسكناهم.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 730هـ -1329م في العهد المملوكي على يد الوزير أمين الدين عبد الله بن غانم، الذي كان أحد المسؤولين في جيش الناصر محمد بن قلاوون ويعرف بأمين الملك، فعرفت باسمه، وقد جرى ترميمها في العهد العثماني.\nوتعتبر هذه المدرسة من أجمل المدارس المطلة على ساحات المسجد الأقصى، ومن أهمها\n\nالمدرسة الملكية\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع في الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك بين المدرسة الفارسية شرقا، والمدرسة الأسعردية غربا، ومدخلها مشترك مع الأسعردية. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى عام 741هـ - 1340م، في عهد السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، وأوقفها الحاج آل الملك الجوكندار، بعد بنائها بأربع سنوات. والمدرسة تحمل معظم العناصر المعمارية المميزة للعهد المملوكي، وخاصة تبادل ألوان الحجارة التي بنيت بها بين الأحمر والأبيض.\nوالمدرسة عبارة عن طابقين، مأهولة حاليا على سبيل السكنى من قبل عائلة الدجاني، إذ استأجروها من دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nالمدرسة الأسعردية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الأقصى، أوقفها التاجر مجد الدين الأسعردي عام 770هـ - 1368م، فعرفت باسمه.\nوهذه المدرسة واسعة تتكون من طابقين يتوسطهما صحن مكشوف مربع الشكل، ويحيط بالصحن عدد من الخلاوي الصغيرة ذات المداخل المعقودة. تتميز بوجود ثلاث قباب فوقها من جهاتها الشرقية والوسطى والغربية،\nوقد قام المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني بترميمها، ونقل إليها دار كتب المسجد الأقصى قبل أن تتحول إلى دار لسكنى آل البيطار حاليا.\n\nالمدرسة المنجكية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع فوق باب الناظر في الرواق الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، ويقع فوقها قبة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي في عام 763هـ - 1361م على يد الأمير يوسف الدين منجك. وهي عبارة عن طابقين يصعد إليهما بدرجات.\nوالمدرسة تستخدم اليوم كمقر لدائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية العامة بالقدس، التابعة لوزارة الأوقاف الأردنية، والمكلفة إدارة شئون المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسة العثمانية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع على السور الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك جنوبي باب المطهرة، أوقفتها أصفهان شاه خاتون بنت محمود العثمانية سنة 840هـ-1437م، في عهد السلطان الأشرف برسباي.\nوالمدرسة العثمانية عبارة عن طابقين جلهما خارج المسجد الأقصى، ومسجد المدرسة بمستوى ساحات المسجد الأقصى ويطل عليها، وقد استولى عليه اليهود وأغلقوا شباكه بالحجارة. أما المدرسة فتستخدم حاليا لسكنى العائلات المسلمة.\n\nالمدرسة الأشرفية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع في الجهة الغربية من المسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين المدرسة العثمانية شمالا ومئذنة باب السلسلة جنوبا. وتسمى أيضا السلطانية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 875هـ -1470م، على يد الأمير حسن الظاهري لكن البناء لم يعجب السلطان الأشرف قايتباي عندما رآه أثناء زيارته للقدس، فأمر بهدمها، وأعيد بناءها عام 885/884هـ - 1480/1479م.\n\nوالمدرسة تنقسم إلى قسمان: حيث يقع القسم الأول داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، والآخر خارجه، والذي داخله عبارة عن طابقين: الأول كان مصلى الحنابلة في المسجد الأقصى المبارك في أصله، ويستخدم جزء منه الآن كمقر لقسم المخطوطات التابع لمكتبة المسجد الأقصى المبارك ومقرها الرئيسي في جامع النساء، والجزء الأكبر منه هو مقر ثانوية الأقصى الشرعية للبنات، وفيه أيضا قبر الشيخ الخليلي، وبعض الأجزاء الصغيرة التي تستخدم دوراً للسكن.\nأما الطابق الثاني، فمتهدم السقف، وهو مسجد المدرسة. ويرجع انهدام هذا الجزء لزلزال وقع في عام 1346هـ - 1927م.\n\nومبنى المدرسة جميل البناء، حيث اشتملت عناصره على صفوف الحجارة المشهرة الملونة باللونين الأحمر والأبيض، وامتازت بغناها بالعناصر المعمارية والزخرفية. وصفها مجير الدين الحنبلي بأنها \nالمدرسة التنكزية\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتقع بين باب السلسلة شمالا وحائط البراق المحتل جنوبا، ويقع جزء منها داخل الرواق الغربي للمسجد الأقصى.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 729هـ -1328م على يد نائب الشام الأمير سيف الدين تنكز، ونسبت إليه.\nوقد كانت مدرسة عظيمة وداراً للحديث، وفي عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، اتخذت مقراً للقضاء والحكم. وفي العهد العثماني، تحولت المدرسة إلى محكمة شرعية، ومن هنا صارت تعرف باسم المحكمة، وبقيت كذلك حتى أوائل عهد الانتداب البريطاني، فاتخذها المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى دارا للسكنى، ثم عادت بعد ذلك مدرسة لتعليم الفقه الإسلامي.\nوفي عام 1389هـ -1969م، صادرتها سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني، ثم حولتها إلى موقع عسكري لما يعرف بحرس الحدود، حيث يشرفون منها على المسجد الأقصى، ويتدخلون لملاحقة المصلين عند اندلاع المظاهرات المنددة بالاحتلال.\n\nالمدرسة العمرية (المحدثية- الصبيبية- الجاولية)\n\nهي إحدى مدارس المسجد الأقصى، وتطل على الحد الشمالي الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، وتعتبر جزءا منه. وهي مدرسة تاريخية كبيرة وواسعة تبلغ مساحتها 4 دونمات، وتتكون من ثلاثة مدارس مملوكية سابقة:\n\nالمحدثية\nالصبيبية\nالجاولية\nبالإضافة إلى عدد من الغرف والزوايا المختلفة التي كانت قائمة في عهود سابقة. وكانت المدرستان الأخيرتان قد استعملتا سكنا لنواب القدس، ومقرا للحكم العثماني، ثم مدرسة باسم روضة المعارف، ثم مقرا لشرطة الاحتلال البريطاني، ثم اتخذها المجاهدون مقراً للجهاد المقدس، ثم مقرا لقائد القدس الأردني، ثم مدرسة.\nوقد استولى عليها الصهاينة عام 1967م بعد احتلال القدس والمسجد الأقصى.\n\nالبوائك\nالبوائك وتسمى أيضا القناطر والموازين، وهي عبارة عن أعمدة تربطها عقود، وتقع أعلى الدرجات الحجرية التي تقود إلى صحن الصخرة المشرفة التي تقع في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. وقد أنشئت هذه البوائك لأغراض جمالية، فوق الدرجات التي تقود إلى صحن الصخرة والتي تسهل أيضا انتقال المصلين بين مختلف جهات المسجد الأقصى دون الحاجة إلى الالتفاف حول الصحن.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى بداية العهد الإسلامي للأقصى خاصة العهد المملوكي الذي يعتبر من أزهى العهود التي مرت بالأقصى المبارك، وجددت في العهد العثماني. وهي 8 بوائك\n\nالبائكة الشمالية\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الشمالي لصحن الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 721هـ - 1321م، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7.5 أمتار.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودين أسطوانيين في الوسط، وسلمها الحجري يقوم على مرحلة واحدة وهو من تسع درجات.\n\nالبائكة الشمالية الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع على الطرف الغربي لصحن الصخرة في جهته الشمالية، بالقرب من قبة الخضر. يعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 778هـ/1376م،\nثم جددت في العهد العثماني، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 أمتار.\nوالبائكة عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية في الوسط، سلمها الحجري تبلغ عدد درجاته ثلاثا وعشرين درجة.\n\nالبائكة الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الحد الغربي لصحن الصخرة المشرفة الواقعة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها المعروف حالياً إلى عام 340هـ/951م.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية في الوسط، سلمها تبلغ درجاته أربعا وعشرين درجة، توصل الصاعد إلى صحن الصخرة من ساحة المسجد الغربية.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية الغربية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع على المحيط الغربي لصحن قبة الصخرة في جهته الجنوبية، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى 877هـ/1472م.\nوهي عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودين من الرخام في الوسط، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 أمتار، ويوصل إليها سلم حجري، من أربع وعشرين درجة.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الجنوبي لصحن الصخرة، يُعْتَقَدُ أنها أنشئت في العهد الأموي، ولكن من المؤكد أنها جددت في العهد العباسي، ثم الفاطمي والعثماني، ثم رممتها دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية عام 1402هـ/1982م.\nوهي عبارة عن ثلاثة أعمدة أسطوانية وسطى، تحفها ركبتان عظيمتان عن يمين وعن شِمال، يبلغ ارتفاعها ستة أمتار ونصف المتر. ويصل ساحة المسجد بصحن الصخرة درج حجري من عشرين درجة.\nوفي الواجهة الجنوبية من هذه البائكة الجنوبية، توجد مزولة شمسية يستعين بها المصلون للتعرف على أوقات الصلوات، وهي من صنع مهندس المجلس الإسلامي الأعلى رشدي الإمام سنة 1907م.\n\nالبائكة الجنوبية الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع قرب الطرف الشرقي للحد الجنوبي لصحن الصخرة. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد الفاطمي عام 412هـ/1021م، وتم تجديدها في العهد الأيوبي عام 608هـ/1211م.\nوالبائكة عبارة عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الأطراف، وعمودي رخام أسطواني الشكل في الوسط، وعدد درجات سلمها الحجري تسع عشرة، ويتراوح ارتفاعها بين 6.5 متر و7 أمتار.\n\nالبائكة الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في الركن الشرقي لصحن الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها على الأرجح في العهد الأموي، وأعيد بناؤها في العصر العباسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي\nوتعد أكبر البوائك حول صحن الصخرة، حيث تتكون من ركبتين عظيمتين، وأربعة أعمدة أسطوانية رخامية الصناعة. ويصل ساحة المسجد الشرقية بصحن الصخرة اثنتان وعشرون درجة، وثلاث درجات أخريات، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 6.5 متر.\n\nالبائكة الشمالية الشرقية\n\nهي إحدى بوائك الأقصى، وتقع في الجانب الشمالي من سطح قبة الصخرة من ناحية الشرق، تتصل بمحور مستقيم عبر ممر مبلط بباب حطة. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى العهد المملوكي عام 726هـ/1325م في عهد السلطان الناصر ناصر الدين محمد بن قلاوون، وقد وثق ذلك بنقش على الواجهة الجنوبية للبائكة.\n\nالأسبلة\nحرص المسلمون حرصاً شديداً على توفير المياه للشرب والطهور في المسجد الأقصى المبارك، فحُفرت الآبار، وتم إنشاء الصهاريج والأسبلة داخله في الساحات المكشوفة، لتخزين مياه الأمطار. والسبيل عين ماء وما لحقها، وقد زودت بصنابير للمياه وثلاجات لدى تجديدها في العصر الحديث.\nويعود إنشاء هذه الأسبلة إلى العصرين الأيوبي والمملوكي، كما أن كثيرا منها استحدث أو جدد في العصر العثماني بأمر السلطان سليمان القانوني الذي تميز عهده ببناء الأسبلة. وللأقصى أسبلة كثيرة نذكر منها 14 التالية:\n\nسبيل الكأس\n\nيقع هذا السبيل المشهور أمام المصلى القبلي، قيل إنه من بناء العباسيين في الأصل، ولكن البناء الحالي تم في عهد السلطان الأيوبي العادل أبو بكر بن أيوب عام 589هـ/1193م، وقد جدده المماليك وقاموا بتوسعته في عهد الأمير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1327-1328م، لاستيعاب المزيد من المصلين. على الرغم من توفير المياه أصلا من مياه بركة سليمان بالقرب من بيت لحم، أما حاليا فيتلقى المياه من الأنابيب المرتبطة بشبكة مياه القدس. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم لشكله الشبيه بالكأس، ويسمى أيضا بسبيل البركة\nوالكأس بركة أسطوانية الشكل، وفي وسطها كاس مرتفعة، تتوسطها ماسورة مياه، تتدفق المياه منها إلى الحوض، فتصب من الكأس للبركة، بشكل جميل. ويستعمل الناس مياه الكأس للوضوء خاصة، على كراسٍ حجرية الصنع ذات ألوان جميلة، وأمام كل منها حنفية مربوطة بالبركة، وهي عشرون حنفية.\n\nسبيل شعلان\nيقع هذا السبيل شمالي درج البائكة الشمالية الغربية التي تقود إلى صحن قبة الصخرة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 1216م في عهد السلطان الأيوبي الملك المعظم عيسى، وجدد في العهد المملوكي على يد الملك الأشرف بربساي عام 1429م، وجدد مرة أخرى سنة 1037هـ/1627م على يد بيرام باشا محافظ مصر، في عهد محافظ القدس محمد باشا في العصر العثماني، وقد كان السبيل عامرا حتى آخر عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وأما اليوم فهو معطل.\n\nصهريج المعظم عيسى الأيوبي\nوهو مبنى يقوم في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بين البائكتين: البائكة الغربية والبائكة الجنوبية الغربية أسفل صحن الصخرة، أمام باب القطانين. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 607هـ/1210م في عهد السلطان الأيوبي عيسى، وسمي باسمه.\nوالبناء مؤلف من ثلاثة أروقة سفلية، فصلت بقواطع بنائية فيما بينها، لكل منها مدخل منفصل في جهتها الغربية. وهو يرتفع عن مستوى صحن الصخرة ببناء أضيف في الفترة العثمانية، وكان أحد أروقته الثلاثة قد استخدم في عهد المماليك مخزنا لحاصلات المسجد الأقصى، وآخر مصلى للحنابلة، ثم أهمل فترة من الزمن، وحُول في وقت لاحق إلى مخزن لحدائق المسجد، ويستعمل جزء منه حاليا كعيادة طبية مكملة للعيادة الطبية الواقعة شماله، والجزء الأكبر منه عبارة عن مكاتب للأوقاف.\n\nسبيل البصيري\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شمال شرق باب الناظر داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 839هـ/1436م في عهد السلطان المملوكي الأشرف برسباي، وقيل إنه أنشئ قبله وأن بناءه تجديد فقط. ويسمى أيضا سبيل الحبس، وسبيل باب الناظر، وبئر إبراهيم الرومي.\n\nسبيل قايتباي\n\nوهو سبيل مياه شهير يقع مقابل باب المطهرة، وقد بُني السبيل فوق الطرف الشماليّ الغربيّ لمصطبة واسعة تحمل نفس الاسم، ولها محراب في الجهة الجنوبية، بناهما الملك الأشرف أبوالنصر إينال عام 860هـ، ثم جدد السبيل في عهد الملك الأشرف قايتباي عام 887هـ/1482م بعد تهدمه، وعرف باسمه، وأعاد تجديده السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الثاني عام 1330هـ/1912م.\nوالسبيل عبارة عن مبنى مرتفع وجميل، دخلت فيه فنون العمارة، وجملته الحجارة الملونة الداخلة في بنائه، وله قبة جميلة مزخرفة بزخارف نباتية، قيل انه السبيل الوحيد من نوعه في فلسطين قاطبة.\n\nسبيل قاسم باشا\n\nيقوم هذا السبيل بين المدرسة الأشرفية غربا، والصحن الغربي للصخرة المشرفة شرقا، في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك.\nويسمى أيضا سبيل باب المحكمة، نسبة إلى باب السلسلة الذي يقع بالقرب منه. بني في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 933هـ/1527م، على يد والي القدس قاسم باشا، وسمي باسمه.\nوالسبيل مثمن الشكل، تنزل إليه بدرجات، من فوقه سقف خشبي يحجب أشعة الشمس عن مستعمليه، ويقلل من ضغط الرياح القارصة ليلا والأمطار النازلة شتاء.\n\nسبيل سليمان القانوني\n\nيقع في الساحات الشمالية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك، بناه السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 943هـ/1536م، ومنه جاءت تسميته. ويسمى أيضا بسبيل السلسلة وسبيل العتم.\n\nسبيل باب المغاربة\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شرقي باب المغاربة داخل المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وتحديدا على الطرف الجنوبي الشرقي لمصطبة مصلى البراق، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى العهد العثماني.\n\nسبيل باب حطة\nيوجد هذا السبيل البسيط على شكل تجويف داخل الجدار الشرقي لباب حطة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى العهد العثماني، وقد رممته مؤسسة الأقصى لإعمار المقدسات الإسلامية أثناء بنائها لوحدة المراحيض القريبة مؤخرا، ثم أُلْغٍي نهائيا بعد ذلك.\nوإلى الشرق من باب حطة.\n\nبركة النارنج\n\nوهي بركة تقع في الساحات الغربية للمسجد الأقصى المبارك أمام المدرسة الأشرفية، بين مصطبة سبيل قايتباي شمالا، وسبيل قاسم باشا جنوبا، وتسمى أيضاً بركة عنغج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها إلى 887هـ/1482م في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، وقامت لجنة إعمار المقدسات بترميمها مؤخرا.\nوهي بركة مربعة الشكل، طول ضلعها سبعة أمتار، فرشت أرضها وحيطانها بالرخام، يتوسطها صحن به نافورة معطلة، ويحيط بها أربع وعشرين حنفية من ثلاث جهات.\n\nسبيل الشيخ بدير\n\nيقع سبيل الشيخ بدير إلى الجنوب الشرقي من باب الحبس، غرب البائكة الشمالية الغربية التي تقود إلى صحن قبة الصخرة، وقد بني في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الأول عام 1153هـ/1740م، بإشراف مصطفى آغا قائم مقام القدس، وبأمر من الوالي عثمان بيك. وتسمى أيضا سبيل البديري.\nوقد نُقِشَتْ عليه عدة أبيات شعرية مقروءة وجميلة، في رخامه على حائطه الشرقي. وهو اليوم معطل رغم أنه رُمٌِمَ حديثا على يد دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\n\nسبيل منبر برهان الدين\nيقع هذا السبيل على زاوية درج البائكة الجنوبية، خلف قبة الميزان (وتسمى أيضا منبر برهان الدين)، في الساحات الجنوبية للمسجد الأقصى. ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى عام 1418هـ/1998م على يد لجنة الإعمار المنبثقة عن دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية.\nويبلغ تعداد صنابيرها أربعة وعشرين، ويستخدمها بعض الزائرين للوضوء.\n\nسبيل الزيتونة\nويقع السبيل غربي سبيل الكأس، أقامته لجنة التراث الإسلامي حديثا برعاية دائرة الأوقاف الإسلامية. وقد سُمِّيَ بهذا الإسم نسبة إلى شجرة الزيتون التي تحيط بها حنفياته السبع.\nيعمل السبيل من خلال ثلاجة في عرق الزيتونة المعمرة ذات الثلاث شعب، والتي عرفت منذ بدايات القرن العشرين باسم زيتونة النبي، ولا يعرف سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم.\n\nسبيل الرحمة\nيقع السبيل غرب بابي الرحمة والتوبة، ويعود تاريخ تشييده إلى 1416هـ/1995م على يد لجنة التراث الإسلامي، وهو عبارة عن اثنتي عشرة حنفية عامرة ومستعملة.\n\nمعالم أخرى\nيحتوي المسجد الأقصى على عدة معالم أخرى نذكر منها:\n\nحائط البراق\nقسم من الحائط الغربي للمسجد الأقصى المبارك يمتد بين باب المغاربة جنوبا، والمدرسة التنكزية شمالا، ويبلغ طوله حوالي 50 مترا، أما ارتفاعه فيقل عن 20 مترا، وقد عرف بهذا الاسم لأن النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ربط دابته البراق فيه على الأرجح يوم إسرائه إلى المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\n\nمنبر نور الدين الزنكي\nهو منبر تاريخي شهير يمثل روعة الفن والزخرفة الإسلامية، بناه نور الدين زنكي عام 564هـ/1168م، ليحمل إلى المسجد الأقصى بعد تحريرها من الصليبيين، لكنه مات قبل أن يحقق ذلك، فلما حرر صلاح الدين بيت المقدس، أمر بإحضاره من حلب، وذلك بعد أكثر من عشرين عاما من بنائه، ووضعه داخل المصلى القبلي وهو المصلى الرئيسي في المسجد الأقصى المبارك.\nوالمنبر مصنوع من الخشب المطعّم بالعاج والأبنوس، تعب النجّارون والصنّاع والمهندسون فيه سنين، وكان لترديد النظر فيه على الأيّام ألوفاً، له بوّابة يرتفع فوقها تاجٌ عظيم ثمّ درج يرقى إلى قوس أعلاه وشرف خشبيّة.\n\nوفي عام 1389هـ/1969م، أحرق المصلى القبلي في حريق الأقصى مما أدى أيضا إلى تدمير المنبر بالكامل، ولدى إعادة ترميم الجامع بين عامي 1389هـ/1969م و1402هـ/1982م وقد استحدث منبر حديدي بسيط الصناعة مكان منبر نور الدين، وهو منبر مؤقت بقي هناك حتى تم إنشاء منبر آخر مطابق للمنبر الأصلي وبنفس المميزات والمواد في الأردن، وتم تركيبه في بداية شهر فبراير عام 2007م.\n\nآبار الأقصى\nيحتوي الأقصى على 25 بئرا عامرة، فيها من الماء ما يكفى سكانَ البلدة القديمة بالقدس، وليس للمصلين الذين يفدون إلى الأقصى فقط. وهذه الآبار موزعة بين صحن الصخرة المشرفة في قلب المسجد الأقصى المبارك، وباقي ساحات المسجد الأقصى المبارك، حيث يوجد منها ثمانية فوق صحن الصخرة، وسبعة عشر في الساحات المحيطة ومن أشهرها:\n\nبئر الجنة\nبئر رمانة\n\nمصاطب المسجد الأقصى المبارك\nتنتشر في ساحات المسجد الأقصى المبارك 26 مصطبة، خاصة الساحات الغربية، وأغلبها يعود للفترة العثمانية، وهي عبارة عن مساحات مسطحة ترتفع ببناء لمسافة أقل من متر عن سطح الأرض. وتبنى عادة من الحجر، ويتم الوصول إليها من خلال عدة درجات. وغالبا ما يكون لها محراب على شكل حنية أو تجويف في جدار صغير يحدد اتجاه القبلة. وتستخدم المصاطب للجلوس والصلاة والتدريس، خاصة في فصل الصيف. أغلبها غير مؤرخ\n\nمصاطب غير مؤرخة :\n\nقدسية المسجد الأقصى عند المسلمين\nكان الأقصى قبلة المسلمين الأولى وقبلة يهود يثرب، لكن الله أمر النبي بتحويل القبلة إلى المسجد الحرام: ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤ وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَا تَبِعُوا قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَا أَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُمْ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ ۝١٤٥﴾\n\nفضائل المسجد الأقصى\nورد لدى المسلمين في القرآن، وفي أحاديث النبي محمد العديد من فضائل المسجد الأقصى وأهميته، منها:\n\nفي القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ (1)\nعن ميمونة بنت الحارث أنها قالت: «يا رسول الله أفتِنَا في بيت المقدس، فقال: إِيتوهُ فصلُّوا فيه، وكانت البلاد إذ ذاك حربًا، فإن لم تأتوه وتصلّوا فيه فابعثوا بزيتٍ يُسرَج في قناديله».\nعن أم سلمة عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «من أهلَّ بعمرةٍ من بيتِ المقدسِ غُفر له».\nعن أبي سعيد الخدري، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «لا تُشَدُّ الرحالُ إلا إلى ثلاثةِ مساجدَ: المسجدِ الحرام، والمسجدِ الأقصَى، ومسجدي هذا».\nعن جابر بن عبد الله، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «صلاةٌ في المسجدِ الحرامِ مائةُ ألفِ صلاةٍ، وصلاةٌ في مسجدِي ألفُ صلاةٍ، وفي بيتِ المقدسِ خمسمائةِ صلاةٍ».\nعن أبي ذر الغفاري، عن النبي محمد أنه قال: «صلاةً في مسجدي هذا (المسجد النبوي) أفضلُ من أَرْبَعِ صلواتٍ فيهِ (المسجد الأقصى)، ولَنِعمَ المُصَلى هُوَ، ولِيُوشِكَنَّ أَنْ لا يَكُونَ للرَّجلِ مثلُ شطنِ فرسهِ من الأرضِ حيث يَرَى مِنهُ بيتَ المقدسِ خيراً لَهُ مِنَ الدنيا جميعاً».\n\nللمسجد الأقصى قدسية كبيرة عند المسلمين ارتبطت بعقيدتهم منذ بداية الدعوة. فهو يعتبر قبلة الأنبياء جميعاً قبل النبي محمد وهو القبلة الأولى التي صلى إليها النبي قبل أن يتم تغير القبلة إلى مكة.\nوقد توثقت علاقة الإسلام بالمسجد الأقصى ليلة الإسراء والمعراج، حيث أنه أسرى بالنبي من المسجد الحرام إلى المسجد الأقصى، وفيه صلى النبي إماماً بالأنبياء ومنه عرج النبي إلى السماء. وفي السماء العليا فرضت عليه الصلاة.\nذكر القرآن واصفاً ليلة الإسراء والمعراج: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾، ووصف الله للمسجد الأقصى بـ﴿الذي باركنا حوله﴾، يدل على بركة المسجد ومكانته عند الله وعند المسلمين. فالأقصى هو منبع البركة التي عمت كل المنطقة حوله في اعتقاد المسلمين.\nوروي عن أم المؤمنين أم سلمة أنها سمعت رسول الله يقول:\n\nوللصلاة في المسجد الأقصى ثواب يعادل خمسمائة صلاة في غيره من المساجد. قال رسول الله: « الصلاة في المسجد الحرام بمائة ألف صلاة، والصلاة في مسجدي بألف صلاة، والصلاة في بيت المقدس بخمسمائة صلاة »، وفي رواية أخرى أن الصلاة في المسجد الأقصى تعدل مئتين وخمسين صلاة في غير المساجد الثلاثة.\nوهو المسجد الذي أمر النبي الصحابة بالبقاء قربه، فقد روى أحمد في مسنده عن ذِي الأصَابِعِ قَال: «قلت: يا رسول الله، إِنِ أبْتُلِينَا بعدك بالبقاء أين تأمرنا؟ قال: عليك ببيت المقدس فلعله أن ينشأ لك ذرية يعدون إلى ذلك المسجد ويروحون».\nويعتبر المسجد الأقصى ثالث المساجد التي تشد إليها الرحال، فقد ذكر النبي أن المساجد الثلاثة الوحيدة التي تشد إليها الرحال هي: المسجد الحرام، والمسجد النبوي، والمسجد الأقصى.\n\nوكلها أحاديث تدل على مكانة المسجد، وعمق علاقته بالإسلام. وهناك العديد من الأحاديث الأخرى التي ذكرت المسجد الأقصى وحثت على زيارته والصلاة فيه.\n\nحفريات المسجد الأقصى\nفي أعقاب استيلاء إسرائيل على القدس الشرقية في حرب 1967م، قامت بعدة حفريات خارج ساحات المسجد الأقصى أو كما تسميه بجبل الهيكل. وفي عام 1970م، بدأت السلطات الإسرائيلية بحفريات مكثفة خارج الأسوار بجوار المسجد على الجانبين الجنوبي والغربي. ويعتقد الفلسطينيون أن أنفاقا حفرت تحت المسجد الأقصى من أجل تقويض أساساته، وهو الأمر الذي نفته القوات الإسرائيلية، وقد زعموا أن أقرب الحفريات إلى المسجد كانت نحو 70 مترا إلى الجنوب منها. كما قام الإسرائيليون بحفر نفق بالقرب من الجزء الغربي من المسجد عام 1984م. ووفقاً لمبعوث اليونسكو الخاص بالقدس أوليغ غرابار، ذكر أن المباني والهياكل في الحرم القدسي آخذة في التدهور ويرجع ذلك أساسا إلى النزاعات بين الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين والحكومة الأردنية حول من هو المسؤول عن هذا الموقع.\nفي 2007م قام الإسرائيليون بحفريات جديدة للكشف عن آثار مزعومة على بعد 60 مترًا من الحرم القدسي، وقد أثارت هذه الحفريات غضب العالم الإسلامي، واتهموا الإسرائيليين بمحاولة تدمير أسس المسجد. وقد دعا إسماعيل هنية الفلسطينيين للقيام باحتجاجات ضد هذه الحفريات، بينما قالت حركة فتح إنها ستنهي اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار مع إسرائيل.\n\nأبرز

      "summary": "ٱلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ أحد أكبر مساجد العالم وأحد المساجد الثلاثة التي يشد المسلمون الرحال إليها، كما قال نبي الإسلام محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ وهو أيضًا أول القبلتين في الإسلام. يقع داخل البلدة القديمة بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقة المحاطة بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الأقصى الواقع في أقصى الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية من البلدة القديمة المسورة.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابة 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تُسمى «هضبة موريا»، وتعد الصخرة أعلى نقطة فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الأقصى في القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود أيضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الأقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبة إلى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهودية التذرع بهذه الحجة لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.",
