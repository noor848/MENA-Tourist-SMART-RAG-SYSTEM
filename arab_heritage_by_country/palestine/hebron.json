      "content": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Hebron appears to trace back to two northwest Semitic languages, which coalesce in the form ḥbr, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite, with a basic sense of 'unite' and connoting a range of meanings from 'colleague' to 'friend'. In the proper name Hebron, the original sense may have been 'alliance'.\nEarly Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra (حبرة) or Ḥabrūn (حبرون). al-Khalīl emerged as the Arabic name for the city in the 13th century, derived from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, Khalīl al-Raḥmān ('Friend of the Merciful [ie. God]'). Thus, the epithet is a calque the original Hebrew toponym Ḥeḇrōn, understood as ḥaḇēr ('friend').\n\nHistory\nBronze and Iron Age\nArchaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24–30 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age. This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city. Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, Abdi-Ḫeba, although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nAncient Israel\nThe Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a Kenite element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city, and Heber is the name for a Kenite clan. In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centers under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (benê/yelîdê hāʿănaq). or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian. This suggests that behind the Anakim legend lies some early Hurrian population. In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the Nephilim. The Book of Genesis mentions that it was formerly called Kiryath-arba, or \"city of four\", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters, four hills, or a confederated settlement of four families.\nThe story of Abraham's purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs from the Hittites constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land in that it signified the first \"real estate\" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua. In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first covenant, an alliance with two local Amorite clans who became his ba'alei brit or masters of the covenant.\nThe Hebron of the Israelites was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual center was located at Elonei Mamre. Hebrew Bible narrative also describes the city.\n\nIt is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either Joshua, who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, \"destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded\", or the Tribe of Judah as a whole, or specifically Caleb the Judahite. The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the Levites of the clan of Kohath, while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb (Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56), who expels the three giants, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has King David called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years (2 Samuel 2:1–3). It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him king of Israel. It was in Hebron again that Absalom has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David (2 Samuel 15:7–10). It became one of the principal centers of the Tribe of Judah and was classified as one of the six traditional Cities of Refuge.\nAs is shown by the discovery at Lachish, the second most important city in the Kingdom of Judah after Jerusalem, of seals with the inscription lmlk Hebron (to the king Hebron), Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic center, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the Dead Sea to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the Shepelah and the coastal plain to the west. Lying along trading routes, it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.\nAfter the destruction of the First Temple, most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view, some researchers found traces of Edomite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became Achaemenid province, and, in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquest, Hebron was throughout the Hellenistic period under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God Qōs. Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). During the Maccabean revolt, Hebron was burnt and plundered by Judah Maccabee who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE. The city appears to have long resisted Hasmonean dominance, however, and indeed as late as the First Jewish–Roman War was still considered Idumean.\n\nRoman rule\nThe present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times. Herod the Great, king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Hebron was captured and plundered by Simon Bar Giora, a leader of the Zealots, without bloodshed. The \"little town\" was later laid to waste by Vespasian's officer Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis. Josephus wrote that he \"slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town\". After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's Terebinth slave-market.\nThe city was part of the Byzantine Empire in Palaestina Prima province at the Diocese of the East. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the Sassanid general Shahrbaraz in 614 when Khosrau II's armies besieged and took Jerusalem. Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule. The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the Sassanid army.\n\nMuslim conquest and Islamic caliphate\nHebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. When the Rashidun Caliphate established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.\nCatholic bishop Arculf, who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad period, described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Baḥr Lūṭ). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass industry in the 9th century.\nHebron was almost absent from Muslim literature before the 10th century. In 985, al-Muqaddasi described Hebron (Habra) as the village of Abraham al-Khalil, with a strong fortress and a stone dome over Abraham's sepulchre. The mosque contained the tombs of Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. Surrounding the area were villages with vineyards producing exceptional grapes and apples. Hebron had a public guest house offering lentils and olive oil to both the poor and the rich. The guest house was established through the bequest of Prophet Muhammad's companions, including Tamim-al Dari, and received generous donations. It was highly regarded as an excellent house of hospitality and charity in the realm of al-Islam. The custom, known as the 'Table of Abraham' (simāt al-khalil), was similar to the one established by the Fatimids. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described Hebron in his Safarnama as having many villages providing revenues for pious purposes. He mentioned a spring flowing from under a stone, with water channeled to a covered tank outside the town. The Sanctuary stood on the town's southern border, enclosed by four walls. Barley was the primary crop, with abundant olives. Visitors were provided with bread, olives, lentils cooked in olive oil, and raisins. Hebron had numerous mills operated by oxen and mules, along with working girls baking bread. The hospitality extended to about three-pound loaves of bread and meals for every arriving person, including up to 500 pilgrims on certain days.\nThe tradition survives to this day in the form of the Takiat Ibrahim soup kitchen, which has been active in providing food for thousands over Ramadan, which coincided with food shortages during the 2024 Gaza war. Geniza documents from this period mention  \"the graves of the patriarchs\" and attest to the presence of an organized Jewish community in Hebron. The Jews maintained a synagogue near the tomb and earned their livelihood accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, known as the \"haver of the graves of the patriarchs.\"\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it \"Castellion Saint Abraham\". It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defense was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (October 17), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\nA royal domain, Hebron was handed over to Philip of Milly in 1161 and joined with the Seigneurie of Transjordan. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram. In 1167, the episcopal see of Hebron was created along with that of Kerak and Sebastia (the tomb of John the Baptist). In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited Hebron, referred to as in its Frankish name St. Abram de Bron. He mentioned the great church called St. Abram, which was once a Jewish place of worship during the time of Muslim rule. The Gentiles had erected six tombs there, claimed to be those of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah. The custodians collected money from pilgrims by presenting these tombs as the tombs of the Patriarchs. However, if a Jew offered a special reward, they would open an iron gate leading to a series of empty caves, until reaching the third cave where the actual sepulchers of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were said to be located.\nThe Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there. The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.\nIn 1244, the Khwarazmians destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1260, after Mamluk Sultan Baibars defeated the Mongol army, the minarets were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary, and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior Ayyubid rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns. The mill at Artas was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron. Between 1318 and 1320, the Na'ib of Gaza and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of Jawli Mosque to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.\n\nHebron was visited by important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them Nachmanides (1270) and Ishtori HaParchi (1322) who noted the old Jewish cemetery there. Sunni imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) was penalized by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognize Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. The Jewish-Italian traveler, Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found not more than twenty Jewish families living in Hebron. and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews. Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg's Journal (1449), by Felix Fabri (1483) and by Mejr ed-Din It was in this period, also, that the Mamluk Sultan Qa'it Bay revived the old custom of the Hebron \"table of Abraham\", and exported it as a model for his own madrasa in Medina. This became an immense charitable establishment near the Haram, distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travelers of all faiths. The Italian rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote around 1490:I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.\n\nEarly Ottoman period\nThe expansion of the Ottoman Empire along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I coincided with the establishment of Inquisition commissions by the Catholic Monarchs in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian convivencia (coexistence). The ensuing expulsions of the Jews drove many Sephardi Jews into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with  notable Sephardi kabbalists settling in Hebron. Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.\nThe Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century. In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardic Abraham Avinu Synagogue. In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the Hesed Le'Abraham yeshiva in Hebron, which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717 to 1729, and were \"almost crushed\" from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community after a false allegation that the son of a local sheikh was murdered  and thrown into a cesspit. Emissaries from the community were frequently sent overseas to solicit funds. During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated patriarchs' tombs were restored to a semblance of  dignity. Ali Bey, in Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access.  In 1807 he reported that the sepulchres were covered with carpets of green silk embroidered in gold and those of the wives were covered in red silk.The sultans of Constantinople furnished these carpets, which were renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, on the sepulchre of Abraham. Hebron also became known  for its glass production, based on Bedouin trade networks that brought up minerals from the Dead Sea. The industry is mentioned in travel literature in 19th century written by Western travelers to Palestine. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, based on 26 kilns. In 1833, a report on the town  in the weekly paper of the London-based Religious Tract Society wrote that Hebron had numerous well-provisioned shops and  produced glass lamps which were exported to Egypt. Early 19th-century travelers also noted Hebron's flourishing agriculture. It was a major exporter of dibse, grape sugar, from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.\n\nAn Arab peasants' revolt broke out in April 1834 when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population. Hebron, headed by its nazir Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and, when its defenses fell on August 4, it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army. An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.\nWhen the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem. In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (serasker), Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumored that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman, the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of Bayt Jibrin), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.\nAccording to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov wrote from Hebron that:\"the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a brit milah (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews'.\"\n\nLate Ottoman period\nBy 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardic families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazic community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian, the Lubavitch Hasidic movement having established a community in 1823. The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha led to a decline in the local glass industry. His plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, making firewood for the kilns  scarce. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass. The rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan reduced traffic to Hebron, and the Suez Canal (1869) precipitated a drop in caravan trade. The consequence was a steady deterioration of the local economy. At the time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), inhabited by Jews; the Mamluk-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west; and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah).In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha (\"governor\") of the sanjak (\"district\") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to put down a  rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, a scene witnessed by representatives of the English, French and other Western consulates. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, brother and rival of Abd al Rachman, as nazir of the Hebron region. Relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. In 1866, Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in Hebron. According to Nadav Shragai, Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. During a  severe drought in 1869–1871,  food in Hebron sold for ten times the normal amount. From 1874, the Hebron district  was administered directly from Istanbul as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem. By 1874, when C.R. Conder visited  Hebron under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Jewish community numbered  600 in an overall population of 17,000. The Jews lived in the Quarter of the Corner Gate. In the late 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glassware, although it continued to be popular among those who could not afford luxury goods  and was sold by Jewish merchants. Glass ornaments from Hebron were exhibited at the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna.\nA report from the consul of the French Consulate in Jerusalem in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly. While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, the economy of Hebron was more diverse, including agriculture and livestock herding, along with glassware manufacturing and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits. Even so, Hebron had an image of being  unproductive and  an \"asylum for the poor and the spiritual\". While the wealthy merchants of Nablus built fine mansions, housing in Hebron consisted of semi-peasant dwellings.\nHebron was described as 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic', and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook, with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews. It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, although  the Jewish and Christian communities seem to have been an integral part of  the local economy. As income from commerce declined and tax revenues diminished significantly, the Ottoman government left Hebron to manage its own affairs for the most part, making it \"one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.\" The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914. The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazi Jews. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry. The community was largely Orthodox and anti-Zionist.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nThe British occupied Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a mandate in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (waqfs), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf. During the 1920s, Abd al-Ḥayy al-Khaṭīb was appointed Mufti of Hebron. Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists. Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron. During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 percent of the political leadership. The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections. Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.\nAt this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbors, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.\n\nJordanian occupation\nAt the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed. By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armored car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.\nIn December 1948, the Jericho Conference, held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari, voted in favor of becoming part of Jordan and to recognize Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.\nAlthough a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period, Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town. During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.\n\nIsraeli period\nAfter the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace. On May 15, 2006, a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees urged the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement, and allow the return of eight families evacuated the previous January from homes they set up in emptied shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, established in 2007 under disputed circumstances, was under court orders permitting its forced evacuation. All the Jewish settlers were expelled on December 3, 2008.\n\nImmediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel. He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders. Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929. The purpose of settlement is to return to the 'land of our forefathers', and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus. Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behavior of Hebronite settlers.\n\nSheik Farid Khader heads the Ja'bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself. Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist. A violent episode occurred May 2, 1980, when an Al Fatah squad killed five yeshiva students and one other person on their way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground.\nIn the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Jewish Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behavior in other settlements. On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others. The 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to \"ensure the security of the Jewish settlers\" and that Israeli \"soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence\".\n\nOslo Accords\nHebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. IDF soldiers see their job as being to protect Israeli settlers from Palestinian residents, not to police the Israeli settlers. IDF soldiers are instructed to leave violent Israeli settlers for the police to deal with. Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites. Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 – which includes the Old City of Hebron – remained under the military control of Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. As of 2009, a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, although the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nOver the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada, and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighborhoods. On November 15, 2002, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush. Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from which the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem. In 2007, the Palestinian population in H2 declined due to Israeli security measures such as extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian businesses and settler harassment. Palestinians are barred from using Al-Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare that is locally nicknamed \"Apartheid Street\" as a result.\n\nIsraeli organization B'Tselem states that there have been \"grave violations\" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the \"presence of the settlers within the city\". The organization cites regular incidents of \"almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city\", curfews and restrictions of movement that are \"among the harshest in the Occupied Territories\", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: \"To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\" Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation. In 2017, Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of work in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incidents reported during this period, stated that Israel violated international law in Hebron and has breached the rights of residents as established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report claimed that Israel  violated Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. Israeli settlement in Hebron was also cited as a violation.\n\nGeography\nHebron is situated on the southern West Bank. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 meters (3,050 ft) above sea level. Hebron is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem, 60.1 kilometers (37.3 mi) east of Gaza, 43 kilometers (27 mi) northeast of Beersheba and 68.4 kilometers (42.5 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, both in Israel and 89.8 kilometers (55.8 mi) northeast of Amman, Jordan. The city is surrounded by Bani Na'im and Dura to the east, Halhul to the north, Taffuh to the west and Yatta to the south. The Israeli–controlled H2 region is located in the eastern region of the city.\nIt is one of the highest cities in the area and was, until the 19th century, considered the highest city in the Middle East. With the governorate and metropolitan area, it forms about 19% of the West Bank total area. The city is surrounded by several mountains and hills, including the Hebron Hills (Jabal al–Khalil) and Mount Nabi Yunis. The Mount Nabi Yunis, situated north of the city, is the highest point in Palestine, with an altitude of 1,030 meters (3,380 ft). While the Hebron Hills is southern part of the wider Judaean Mountains, which spreads throughout Israel and Palestine and have an altitude of 1,026 m (3,366 ft). The two larger settlements whose population exceeds 7000 sit on the hills overlooking the Hebron's eastern quarters – Kirayt Arba and Givat Harsina. Wadi al–Quff near Hebron is one of the largest natural reserves in Palestine. Located towards northeast of the city, it is surrounded by nearby towns and villages of Tarqumia, Halhoul, Beit Kahel and Beit Ola. The natural reserve covers up an area of 3.73 square kilometers (920 acres). Wadi al–Quff Natural reserve is home to some of the rare species of animals and plants.\nHebron is located on fertile mountainous area, making the city agriculturally rich, thus giving it a strategic importance. This is the reason for Hebron, today being a hub for cultivation of fruits and vineyards. The alternative sources of water network is cisterns. There are ten springs and three wells in the city. The water of springs and wells are not currently used. The Hebron River (Wadi al–Khalil), known as Nahal Hebron in Hebrew located along the region of Judea and Negev, is one of the water sources for the city. Currently the river is polluted, mainly due to the generation of waste, mostly by the industrial areas, situated on the city's east and south.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in Hebron is temperate and the mean year-round temperature ranges between 15 and 16° (an average of 7° in winter and 21° in summer). Annual precipitations average around 502 mm. Hebron has a Mediterranean, hot summer climate (Classification: Csa). The city's yearly temperature is 22.74 °C (72.93 °F) and it is 0.14% higher than Palestine's averages. It typically receives about 15.72 millimeters (0.62 inches) of precipitation and has 39.47 rainy days (10.81% of the time) annually, during January and February.\n\nUrban development\nHistorically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the suq and Harat al-Masharqa adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque, the Silk Merchant Quarter (Haret Kheitun) to the south and the Sheikh Quarter (Haret al-Sheikh) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.\nIn the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared. The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the Cave of Machpelah, the Haret Kheitun (the Jewish Quarter, Haret el-Yahud), the Haret el-Sheikh and the Druze Quarter. As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighborhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial center, Bab el-Zawiye, emerged. As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west. In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it. By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: el-Sheikh and Bab el-Zawiye to the west, el-Kazzazin, el-Akkabi and el-Haram in the center, el-Musharika to the south and el-Kheitun in the east. Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945. \n\nThe large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over 3 miles (5 km) at a depth of 600 ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5 km). In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded. In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site. The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin Quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site, which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.\nToday, the area along the north–south axis to the east comprises the modern city of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, Khalil Foq). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who moved there from the crowded old city, Balde al-Qadime (also called Lower Hebron, Khalil Takht). The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two luxury hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the krum, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period. The southern part is where the working-class neighborhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University. The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the center of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads that lead to the entrance of the old city. Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial center of the city, known as the vegetable market (hesbe), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of Bab el-Zawiye.\n\nDemographics\nHebron has, historically, been an Arab city but a small Jewish community has existed since the 16th century, encouraged to settle there by the Ottoman authorities following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000, including an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, and to 41 Jewish taxpayers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the Jews having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834. Its population stood at 16,577 in 1922 of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian.\nThe Jewish community was expelled from the city following the massacre of nearly 70 Jews in 1929. However, since Israel gained control of the West Bank in 1967, Hebron and eastern Jerusalem have been the only cities in the region to receive Jewish settlement.\nHebron had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017, and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City. Roughly 20% of the city, including 35,000 Palestinians, under Israeli military administration, lives in the region of H2 Hebron. The surrounding area forms the Hebron metropolitan area, with an estimated population of around 782,227 as of 2021. It is third largest metropolitan area in Palestine, after Gaza and Jerusalem.\nHebron is also home to several ethnic minority and foreign diaspora communities. Kurds have been living in the city since Saladin's conquest of Palestine. Along with Jerusalem and Gaza, the city is also home to Palestinians of Kurdish descent. Nearly a third of the population of Hebron, is considered to be of Kurdish background. The Kurdish Quarter, known as Harat al-Akrad, still exists today. Hebron is also home to a small Samaritan community, after Nablus.\n\nEconomy\nHebron is a leading commercial and industrial center in the Levantine region. The presence of minerals and resources in surroundings have increased the city's value. It emerged as in important trade hub in the West Bank. Hebron is most productive region in the country after Jerusalem–Bethlehem–Ramallah area. The H1 Area, which is under control of Palestinian Authority have been a large contributor to the city's economy. Despite having tense relations, Israelis and Palestinians have strong trade relations in Hebron. The city is popular for its ceramics and glass industry.\n\nIt is the source of 60% of stone and marble resources in the West Bank. 33% of the Palestine's GNP is from Hebron, including 60% of the jewelry industry and jewelry production, 28% of the output in the agricultural sector and 75% of the leather and shoe industry. Most agricultural products from Palestinian controlled Hebron are sent to Israel. Trade volume between Israel and the Palestine reaches $30 billion annually and the city trades with China as well. The minimum wage is 50 NIS per day versus an average of 30 NIS per day in other Palestinian areas. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the PLO made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.\n90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper, and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports. Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.\n\nThe most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Hebron is major source of import goods to Israel. Mattresses manufactured in Hebron are exported to Israeli markets in Tel Aviv, Beersheba and Haifa. Around 17,000 factories and workshops are located throughout the Area H1. Historically, the traditional glass industry is popular in Hebron. A new industrial city has been built in Tarqumiyah, which houses more than 140 factories. Royal Industrial Trading operates a pipe manufacturing plant in Hebron, which is spread across an area of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) and employs over 650 people. In 2021, an electronic recycling factory was opened in Idhna and operates to this day. The European Union and the World Bank proposed to construct a regional water treatment plant, which will treat existing sewage stream coming from 80% of the city. The city is a hub for the jewelry industry and houses approximately 70 jewelry factories employing over 1500 workers.\nSuper Nimer company manufactures sanitary ware products and water network from its factory, whose area ranges from 30,000 square meters (7.4 acres) to 45,000 square meters (11 acres). Opened in 2004, Super Tiger operates a factory spread across an area of 7 acres (28,000 m2). During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Palestine, Hebron rapidly transformed into a medical supplies manufacturing hub, with numerous factories installing and commissioning new production lines for the product and was approved by the Ministry of National Economy.\n\nPolitical status\nUnder the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition. The aftermath of the 1948 war saw the city occupied and later unilaterally annexed by the kingdom of Jordan in a move supported by local Hebron officials. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 percent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.\nAn international unarmed observer force—the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.\nThe post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the Mercaz HaRav Kook, which consider the Land of Israel and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to Abraham, King David, and the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Settling in Hebron is seen as a right and duty, a favor to the world, and an example of being \"a light unto the nations\" (Or la-Goyim).  This viewpoint has resulted in numerous violent clashes with Palestinians, which some settlers see as contributing to the messianic process.\n\nOccupation and settlements\nIn 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of Israelis, disguised as tourists, rented the main hotel in Hebron and refused to leave. The government initially wanted to evacuate the settlers but eventually allowed them to relocate to a nearby military base, which became the settlement of Kiryat Arba. After lobbying efforts, the settlement gained support from some Israeli leaders. Over time, the settlement expanded with the outpost Givat Ha'avot. The operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel. In 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron before 1948 and are not entitled to compensation for their losses. Originally named Hesed l'Avraham, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Baghdadi Jewish families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America, which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all. In 1979, a group of 15 settler mothers and their 35 children squatted in the Dabouia building in Hebron, exploiting the government's indecision during negotiations with Egypt. Led by Miriam Levinger, they established a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement and created conflict with Arab shopkeepers. A retaliatory attack by a Palestinian group resulted in the death of six yeshiva students. Despite appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the settlers remained. The following year, the government legitimized residency in Hebron and expelled the elected mayor. This pattern of settlement followed by hostilities with Palestinians was repeated in Tel Rumeida.\nThe Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the center of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed. The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighboring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return. Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students. In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir. In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.\nIn 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation. The IDF, in accordance with settler demands, requested the removal of a Palestinian flag on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice. According to Palestinians, the IDF negotiated the removal of the flag in exchange for the release of a resident of Hebron from legal custody. In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of Plugat Hamitkanim in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s. In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighborhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.\n\nCulture\nTourism\nHebron is home to numerous mosques, synagogues, churches, parks, palaces, castles and forts. The Old City of Hebron was a declared a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO on July 7, 2017. The move caused controversies and faced opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it being called as Palestinian site, instead of Israeli. It is one of the best preserved sites of the Mamluk era.\n\nThe most famous site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The site is known for the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah respectively. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue.\nThe tombs of other biblical figures – Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse are also located in the city. It is reverred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. These sites are located in the H2 region, which is controlled by the Israeli authorities.\nThe early Ottoman-era Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city's historic Jewish Quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.\nMosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque.\nHebron is also home to several sites for Christian worship, with numerous churches located around the city. The Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925. Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas.\nOther sites:\n\nSituated on the northeast of the city, Wadi al–Quff Natural Reserve is visited by 2,000 people, mostly on weekends. It is currently under the management of the Palestinian government.\nAristobolia (Khirbet Istanbul), in south of Hebron, near Zif village, is home to Byzantine-era basilica, built during the beginning of Islamic era.\nKhirbet al–Karmil is home to Crusader pool, ruined Byzantine church and Crusader fortress.\nAs-Samu is an ancient biblical village, currently a modern town. It is home to 4th century synagogue, numerous Ottoman-era structure and an Islamic building, probably built during the time of Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.\n\nReligious traditions\nSome Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron. A tradition arose in medieval Jewish texts that the Cave of the Patriarchs itself was the very entrance to the Garden of Eden. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune. Others report that the soil was harvested for export as a precious medicinal spice in Egypt, Arabia, Ethiopia and India and that the earth refilled after every digging. Legend also tells that Noah planted his vineyard on Mount Hebron. In medieval Christian tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where Elizabeth was said to live, the legend implying that it might have been the birthplace of John the Baptist.\nOne Islamic tradition has it that Muhammad alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes. Another tradition states that Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari's domain; this was implemented during Umar's reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the waqf of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them. The simat al-Khalil or \"Table of Abraham\" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveler Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman imarets — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.\nAccording to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the diasporic thrust of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.\n\nGallery\nTwin towns / sister cities\nHebron is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nShabab Al-Khalil SC, the town's football team\nPalestinian Child Arts Center\nList of burial places of biblical figures\nList of people from Hebron\nOak of Mamre, Christian holy site, historically near Hebron but now inside the city, distinct from the Terebinth of Mamre\nAbraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, Russian Orthodox monastery at the \"Oak of Mamre\"\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nwww.hebron-city.ps\nPhotographs of Hebron\nenglish Hebron.com – English\nCollection of Palestinian articles on Hebron published by \"This Week in Palestine\"\nSephardic Studies 1839 Sephardic census of Ottoman-controlled Hebron.\nArchNet.org. \"Hebron\".

      "summary": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.",

      "content": "الخَلِيل مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة الخليل إداريًا، تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الجنوب من القدس بحوالي 35 كم. أسسها الكَنعَانِيون في العصر البرونزي المبكر، وتُعد اليوم أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية من حيث عدد السكان والمساحة، حيث بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2016 بقرابة 215 ألف نسمة، وتبلغ مساحتها 42 كم2. تمتاز المدينة بأهمية اقتصادية، حيث تُعد من أكبر المراكز الاقتصادية في الضفة الغربية. وللخليل أهمية دينية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث، حيث يتوسط المدينة المسجد الإبراهيمي الذي يحوي مقامات للأنبياء إبراهيم، وإسحق، ويعقوب، وزوجاتهم.\nتُقسم مدينة الخليل حاليّاً إلى البلدة القديمة والحديثة، وتديرها بلدية الخليل التي أُسِّسَت عام 1927، كما أنها مركز محافظة الخليل التي يضم التقسيم الإداري الحالي لها العشرات من القرى والبلدات، ويُقدر عدد سكان المحافظة بأكثر من 684 ألف نسمة (2014). تقع البلدة القديمة بمحاذاة المسجد الإبراهيمي. وهي عبارة عن أزقّة وبيوت ودكاكين قديمة، وتضم العديد من الأسواق. تقوم إسرائيل بإغلاق أجزاء كبيرة منها وتنشر قوات من الجيش الإسرائيلي فيها لوجود تجمّع حديث لليهود الأرثوذكس يسعى للسيطرة على العقارات في تلك المنطقة. تسيطر إسرائيل على حوالي 20% من مساحة المدينة بحسب إتفاق إعادة الإنتشار في الخليل في عام 1997، ولكن تتحمل السلطة الفلسطينية إدارة الشؤون المدنية للفلسطينيين فيها. يحيط بالمدينة أيضًا الكثير من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، أكبرها مستوطنة كريات أربع، والمستوطنات والتجمعات اليهودية تحتكم لجسم بلدي منفصل. وتعد المدينة من المدن المقدسة الأربع في الديانة اليهودية.\nفي السابع من تموز 2017، أدرجت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة «اليونسكو» البلدة القديمة في مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على قائمة التراث العالمي المُهدد بالخطر بوصفها منطقة تُعرف بقيمتها العالمية، وقد حصلت مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على أغلبية أصوات الدول المشاركة في التصويت الذي جرى في مدينة كراكوف البولندية.\n\nالتسمية\nسُميَّت مدينة الخليل بهذا الاسم نسبةً إلى نبي الله إبرَاهِيم الخليل، حيث يُعتقد انه سكنها في منطقة الحرم الإبراهيمي بعد هجرته من مدينة أور السومرية. كانت تسمى بقرية أربع نسبة إلى ملك كنعاني اسمه أربع، وسميت بعدها حبرون لأحد سببين، إما نسبة للملك عفرون الحثي الكنعاني الذي باع المغارة لـ إبراهيم، حسب الرواية التوراتية، بأربعمائة شواقل وكان الشاقل العملة الكنعانية، وإما لكونها كلمة مشتقة من كلمة «حافير» العبرية أو الخليل بالعربية. سمّيت فيما بعد بالخليل ويبلغ عدد سكانها 320,000 نسمة.\n\nالتاريخ\nتُعتبر مدينة الخليل من المدن العربية القليلة التي حافظت على استمرارية الاستقرار البشري. والخليل هي مدينة مقدسة لليهود والمسلمين والمسيحيين. كما أنها معروفة باعتبارها مدينة الآباء. يعتقد بعض الناس أن إبراهيم، أب الأديان الإبراهيمية، قد عاش في الخليل عام 1800 قبل الميلاد أو نحو ذلك. يعتقدون أيضا أنه قد اشترى المغارة التي بني عليها المسجد الإبراهيمي/ مغارة مكفيلا، حيث يعتقدون أن إبراهيم قد دفن هناك وزوجته سارة، وابنهما إسحاق وحفيدهما يعقوب. على مر التاريخ، كانت هنالك فترات لأغلبية مسلمة، من الذين عاشوا في مدينة الخليل إلى جانب أقليات من اليهود.\n\nوُجدت في الخليل آثار تشير إلى وجود مدني في العصر البرونزي المبكر (في حدود النصف الثاني من الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد) وكانت المدينة في الأصل مدينة كنعانية جليلة مترفة، وسيطرت عليها - كما في بقية فلسطين- العديد من القوى، من الأشوريين عام 732 ق.م والبابليين عام 586 ق.م والفرس عام 539 ق.م والإغريق عام 322 ق.م، وإنتزعها منهم الرومان عام 63 ق.م. ثم انتقلت لقبضة البيزنطيين عام 593 م إلاّ أنّ الفرس احتلوها منهم لبضع سنوات، ثمّ عاد الروم البيزنطيون فاستعادوها مرة أخرى، وأخرجوا الفرس منها، وانتقلت لسيطرة العرب المسلمين في القرن السابع الميلادي. ضمّها الصليبيون لممالكهم عام 1167م حتى هزيمتهم بعد معركة حطين سنة 1187م أمام جيش صلاح الدين الأيوبي ونقل إليها منبر عسقلان العاجي. لاحقا تطورت المدينة في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني، واشتهرت في عصر العثمانيين بصناعة القناديل والزجاج الملوّن، وبلغ من تقدمها آنذاك أن شاركت في المعرض العالمي الذي أقيم في فينا عام 1873م، حيث عرضت صناعات الخليل من أدوات الزينة المصنوعة من الزجاج الملوّن، كما ازدهرت في فترة الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين، حيث أسست بلدية الخليل عام 1927م. وخلال حرب 1948، وقع نصف قضاء الخليل ضمن حدود إسرائيل دون المدينة، حيث فقد القضاء معظم قراه وبلداته وأخصب أراضيه الواقعة غربًا، وأخضعت المدينة للإدارة الأردنية عام 1950م. وفي حرب 1967 استكملت إسرائيل احتلال المحافظة بما فيها المدينة، وقامت بمصادرة جزء كبير من المدينة لإسكان المستوطنين اليهود فيها، وخاصة في البلدة القديمة.].\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nتُعد الخليل من أقدم مدن العالم، وتاريخها يعود إلى 5500 عام. بناها الكنعانيون وأطلقوا عليها اسم (قرية أربع) نسبة إلى بانيها (أربع) وهو أبو عَناق أعظم العناقيين، وكانوا يوصفون بالجبابرة، ولما جاء يوشع بن نون غير اسم قرية أربع إلى حيرون نسبة إلى أحد أولاد كالب بن يفنة، ثم سميت الخليل نسبة إلى (خليل الرحمن) إبراهيم، ففي أوائل القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد سكن إبراهيم بعض السنين تحت بلوطات «ممرًا» الواقعة شمال الخليل، وتضم الخليل رفاته ورفاة زوجته سارة، وعائلته من بعده إسحق ويعقوب ويوسف لوط ويونس، ثم صارت الخليل قاعدة لدواوود بن سليمان سبع سنين ونصفا فقط، وكذلك تضم الكثير من رفات الصحابة وفي مقدمتهم شهداء معركة أجنادين. يواصل اليهود إدعائهم فهم يدَعُون أن موسى استخرج تابوته من أعماق النيل وحمله معه وأن «يوشع بن نون» دفنه في مغارة في حبرى (الخليل) وهم بهذا الإدعاء وغيره يريدون عبر الصهيونية إلى استدرار عاطفة الناس دينيًا وخلق تاريخ وهمي من العدم.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي أيام الرومان، أقيمت كنيسة على مقبرة إبراهيم وعائلته، ولما دخل الفرس سنة 614 م هدموها، تُعد الخليل واحدة من آخر المدن في فلسطين التي دخلها الفتح الإسلامي في القرن السابع الميلادي. وقد كانت تُسمى على أيام النبي محمد بـ«حبرا». وقد شاد الأمويون سقف الحرم الحالي والقباب التي فوق مراقد إبراهيم ويعقوب وزوجتيهما. وفي العصر العباسي فتح الخليفة المهدي باب السور الحالي من جهة الشرق وبنوا له المراقي الجميلة من ناحيتي الشمال والجنوب وأمر المقتدر بالله ببناء القبة التي على ضريح يوسف.\n\nوفي العصر الفاطمي لم يكن لمشهد الخليل باب، وكان دخوله مستحيلاً، بل كان الناس يزورونه من الإيوان في الخارج. فلما جلس المهدي على عرش مصر أمر بفتح باب فيه، وزيّنه وفرشه بالسجاجيد، وأدخل على عمارته إصلاحاً كثيراً. وباب المشهد وسط الحائط الشمالي على ارتفاع أربع أذرع فوق الأرض، وعلى جانبه درجات من الحجر، فيصعد إليه من جانب ويكون النزول من الجانب الثاني. ووضع هناك باب صغير من الحديد.\nلقد وصف الاصطخري المدينة بقوله: ««ومن بيت لحم على سمته في الجنوب مدينة صغيرة، شبيهة في القدر بقرية ـ تعرف بمسجد إبراهيم، وفي المسجد الذي يجمّع فيه الجمعة قبر إبراهيم واسحق ويعقوب صفاً، وقبور نسائهم صفاً بحذاء كل قبر من قبورهم قبر امرأة صاحبه، والمدينة في وهدة بين الجبال كثيرة كثيفة الأشجار، وأشجار هذه الجبال وسائر جبال فلسطين وسهلها زيتون وتين وجميز وعنب وسائر الفواكه أقل من ذلك»».\nكما وصفها المقدسي: ««حبرى هي قرية إبراهيم الخليل، فيها حصن منيع، يزعمون أنه من بناء الجن من حجارة عظيمة منقوشة، وسطه قبّة من الحجارة إسلامية، على قبر إبراهيم وقبر اسحق، قُدَّام في المغطى، وقبر يعقوب في المؤخر. حذاء كل نبي امرأته. وقد جُعل الحبر مسجداً وبني حوله دور للزّوار. واختلطت فيه العمارة ولهم قناة ضعيفة. وهذه القرية إلى نحو نصف مرحلة من كل جانب قرى وكروم وأعناب وتفاح، تسمى جبل نصرة لا يُرى مثله، ولا أحسن من فواكهه، عامتها تحمل إلى مصر وتنشر. وفي هذه القرية ضيافة دائمة وطبّأخ وخباز وخدام، مرتبون يقدمون العدس بالزيت لكل من حضر من الفقراء. ويدفع إلى الأغنياء إذا أخذوا. ويظن أكثر الناس أنه من قرى إبراهيم وإنما هو من وقف تميم الداري وغيره. والأفضل عندي التورُّع عنه»».\n\nالحروب الصليبية\nوقد سقطت مدينة «الخليل» في أيدى الفرنجة عام 1099 م إبَّان الحروب الصليبية. وقام الأمير جودفري البويوني ببناء قلعة حصينة لحمايتها والتي سمّاها \"Castellion Saint Abraham\" - أي: «قلعة القديس أبراهام»، ثم منحها وقلعتها إلى جيرارد افسنس \"Gerard of Avesenes\" طبقا للعرف الإقطاعي، الذي صار عليه الفرنجة في توزيع معظم البلاد والأراضي التي تم الاستيلاء عليها لكبار الأمراء والقادة العسكريين. وهكذا تحولت مدينة الخليل وجزء من الزمام الزراعي المحيط بها إلى إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، يسيطر عليها أحد الأمراء بفضل جهود الأمير جودفري، الذي يرجع إليه الفضل بوضع أساس النظام الإقطاعي الفرنجي الصليبي في فلسطين، غير أن السمات البارزة لهذا النظام لم تظهر في عهده؛ بسبب قصر المدة التي حكمها.\nأصبحت الخليل إقطاعية فرنجية صليبية، لكن الملك الفرنجي في بيت المقدس لم يقم بمنح جميع أراضي الخليل للسيد الإقطاعي وإنما احتفظ بجزء منها، مما يشير إلى أن المملكة الفرنجية اتبعت نهجا واضحا في سياستها العامة والمتعلقة بمنح الإقطاعات والأملاك المحددة دون اللجوء إلى منح المدن المناطق الريفية المحيطة بها للسادة الإقطاعيين. وربما كان ملوك بيت المقدس يهدفون من وراء هذه السياسة تحقيق عدة أمور منها: الاحتفاظ بمساحات شاسعة من أراضي الخليل من أجل منح جزء منها للكنائس والأديرة وصغار النبلاء والفرسان، أو ربما للحد من سلطة السيد الإقطاعي، أو ربما من أجل الإسهام في تغطية نفقات التاج من عائدات هذه الأراضي.\nلقد استطاع صلاح الدين الأيوبي استرداد المدينة من أيدى الصليبيين إثر موقعة حطين عام 1187 م. وفي عام (656 هـ - 1258 م) أغار المغول على مدينة الخليل بعدما دمّروا بغداد، غير أن انتصارات «قطز» في عين جالوت عام (658 هـ - 1260 م) وضعت حدًا نهائيً لتلك الغارات.\n\nالعهد المملوكي\nاستعاد القائد صلاح الدين الأيوبي مدينة الخليل في 1187. تم ذلك بمساعدة يهودية وفقا لتقليد واحد في وقت متأخر، في مقابل خطاب من الأمن السماح لهم بالعودة إلى المدينة، وبناء كنيس هناك. تم تغيير اسم المدينة مرة أخرى إلى مدينة الخليل. وقد بقي ربع الكردية موجود في البلدة خلال الفترة الأولى من الحكم العثماني. استعاد ريتشارد قلب الأسد المدينة بعد فترة وجيزة. تمكن ريتشارد من كورنوال، وجلبه من إنجلترا لتسوية العداوات الخطيرة بين فرسان المعبد والإسبتارية، التي تنافس للخطر معاهدة ضمان الاستقرار الإقليمي المنصوص عليها مع السلطان المصري والصالح أيوب، لفرض السلام في المنطقة. لكن بعد وقت قصير من مغادرته، ونتيجة للحروب المتناحرة من عام 1241، وفرسان المعبد الذين شنوا غارة مدمرة، في انتهاك للاتفاقيات.\nفي 1260، بعد غارات المغول على فلسطين، لامست واحدة منها الخليل. وقد تم بناء مآذن على هيكل مغارة المكفيلة/المسجد الإبراهيمي في ذلك الوقت. بعد ست سنوات، خلال الحج إلى مدينة الخليل، أصدر بيبرس مرسوما يمنع المسيحيين ويهود\nمن دخول الحرم، وأصبح المناخ أقل تسامحا مع اليهود والمسيحيين مما كانت عليه تحت حكم الدولة الأيوبية قبل. لم يكن مرسوم لإستبعاد المسيحيين واليهود بصرامة حتى منتصف القرن الرابع عشر وبحلول 1490 سمح لمن هم ليسو بمسلمين بالدخول في كهوف تحت الأرض. تم بناء مصنع في أرطاس عام 1307 حيث تم تخصيص الأرباح من دخلها إلى مستشفى في الخليل. ولقد كتب العديد من الزوار حول الخليل على مدى القرنين التاليين (من بينها \"Ishtori HaParchi\" عام 1322 و \"Nachmanides\" عام 1270 والحاخام ميشولام من فولتيرا عام 1481 و \"HaParchi\" عام 1322. ولم يُسجل أي ذكر لليهود في مدينة الخليل في هذه الفترة.\nلقد استمرت الهجرة إلى المدينة من قبل المجموعات العرقية والدينية المختلفة، ومن ضمنها مجموعات يهودية صغيرة وفقيرة اعتاشت على صدقات المحسنين اليهود الذين كانوا يزورون المدينة (خلال الفترة المملوكية)، وسكنت في قلب المدينة في حارة الدارية. هذا بالإضافة إلى نشوء حارة صغيرة للنصارى (استمرت بالوجود حتى مطلع الفترة العثمانية)، لتختفي بعدها. ولكن تعود كل الحارات القديمة، والتي ما زالت قائمة، في شكلها النهائي إلى الفترة المملوكية. وبالتالي من الممكن الاعتقاد بأن شكل الخليل القديمة، كما هي عليه الآن، قد تشكل في هذه الفترة، في حين كان نصيب الفترة العثمانية، مجرد تعبئة الفراغات التي تركتها الفترة المملوكية وتكثيف استعمال المساحات وزيادة طوابق المباني القديمة وتوسع ضئيل في مساحة الحارات.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nفتح العثمانيون الشام ومدينة الخليل بعد معركة مرج دابق عام 1517 م، واستمر حكمهم 4 قرون، حتى جاء الاحتلال البريطانى لفلسطين عام 1917م إلى عام 1948 م.\nلقد كانت الخليل مشهورة بعمل الزجاج. وكانت أبنيتها في هذه الفترة من الحجر الكلسي الذي يستخرج من الجبال المحيطة بها. ولهذه المدينة عدة أبواب تغلق ليلاً منعاً للمواصلة مع بقية المقاطعات ومحافظة على الأمن والسكينة. والمدينة الحاضرة مبنية على منحدرات الهضاب وفي السهل. وموقع الحرم أو الجامع يقع عند نهاية المنحدر البعيد عنها قليلاً. وضمت الخليل 22 ألف نسمة في نهاية الفترة العثمانية. بينهم 2000 يهودي لهم ثلاثة معابد. تقوم على مساحة ضيقة من واد ينحدر من الشمال الغربي. ضواحي البلدة خصبة، تكثر فيها عيون الماء. يصنع اليهود الخمر الجيد من العنب الذي يكثر في الجوار. وفضلاً عن الكرمة فان أشجار اللوز والمشمش في نمو وازدهار. والخليل أيضاً سوق تجاري.\n\nبالنسبة لأحياء المدينة في هذه الفترة، فضلاً عن الأحياء اليهودية الواقعة في شمالها الغربي وجنوبها الغربي كانت تضم سبعة أحياء:\n\nحي الشيخ علي البكا ويعلو هذا الحي على مجرى مياه «عين قشقلة» وترى بقربها مغائر وقبور صخرية. ومن هذه العين ممر يؤدي إلى رأس تلة (حبال الرياح).\nحارة باب الزاوية.\nحارة القزازين ـ نسبة إلى عمّال الزجاج.\nحارة العقّابة حيث يقيم عمّال المعاطف الشتوية المصنوعة من الجلد\nحارة الحرم\nحارة المشارقة\nحارة قيطون ـ حيث كان يقيم عمال القطن\nكانت البلدة القديمة تقوم في القرب من المدينة الحالية، على «تلة الرميدة» المغطاة بأشجار الزيتون وترى على هذه التلة بقايا جدران ضخمة وبناية حديثة تحمل اسم دير الأربعين. وفي الجنوب الغربي من حارة الحرم انشئت بركتان كبيرتان: الأولى تحمل اسم «بركة القزازين» طولها 28 ياردة وعرضها 18 ياردة وعمقها 27 قدماً ونصف القدم. والثانية وتقع في أسفل الوادي وتعرف باسم «بركة السلطان» بنيت بأحجار مصقولة، مربعة الشكل طول كل ضلع من أضلاعها نحو 44 ياردة. وبقربها تقوم «السراي» الجديدة. وكان لا يسمح لغير المسلمين دخول الحرم الشريف. ولم يدخله من غير المسلمين إلاّ أقلية ممتازة من الأوروبيين انما كان يسمح لليهود وغيرهم الصعود إلى الدرجة السابعة فقط من سلّم الحرم. وعند الدرجة الخامسة يوجد ثقب يعتقد اليهود انه يمتد إلى داخل الحرم إلى أن تصل بالقبور. وفي كل جمعة يأتون إلى الدرجة المذكورة يبكون وينوحون شأنهم في شأن نحيبهم عند حائط البراق (المبكى) في بيت المقدس. وفي الجنوب من تلة «قب الجانب» تقع محطة الكرنتينا. وتلاصق الحرم من الجنوب «القلعة» وهي نصف خربة تستعمل ثكنة للجنود.وفي الخليل أيضاً إدارة للبريد والبرق وفرع لبنك انجلو فلسطين ومستشفى للارسالية الاسكوتلندية.\n\nعهد الانتداب البريطاني\nبعد الحرب العالمية الأولى، انتقلت مدينة الخليل لتكون تحت الانتداب البريطاني. خلال سنوات العشرينات، نتيجة لازدياد الصهيونية من جهة، وتنمية الوعي القومي العربي من جهة أخرى، زادت حدة التوتر بين العرب واليهود الذين عاشوا تحت الانتداب. وقد ادعت كلتا الأيديولوجيتين ادعاءات سياسية وإقليمية متضاربة حول نفس المنطقة، مما أسفر عن انفجار في الخليل، في مذبحة عام 1929.\n\nالحكم الأردني\nقامت هيئة الأمم المتحدة عام 1947 بمحاولة لإيجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئة الأمم بتشكيل لجنة \"UNSCOP\" المتألّفة من دول متعدّدة باستثناء الدّول دائمة العضوية لضمان الحياد في عملية إيجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنة بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الأول بإقامة دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينة القدس من قِبل إدارة دولية. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تأسيس فيدرالية تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهودية والعربية. ومال معظم أفراد لجنة \"UNSCOP\" تجاه المشروع الأول والرامي لتأسيس دولتين مستقلّتين بإطار اقتصادي موحد. وقامت هيئة الأمم بقبول مشروع لجنة \"UNSCOP\" الدّاعي للتقسيم مع إجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركة بين الدولتين، العربية وواليهودية، على أن يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nأعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من أرض فلسطين للدولة اليهودية، وشملت حصّة اليهود من أرض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من إسدود إلى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينة يافا) وأغلبية مساحة صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينة بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصرية). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحة للزراعة ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الأرض الفلسطينية على أماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهودية بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدولة اليهودية.\nلقد أفضت أحداث حرب 1948 إلى إعلان الإدارة الأردنية للضفة الغربية، حيث ضم الأردن الضفة الغربية، بما فيها مدينة الخليل، بصفة رسمية يوم 24 نيسان/ أبريل 1950، لكن الجامعة العربية وآخرون أعلنوا بطلان وعدم قانونية الضم ولم يعترف به سوى ثلاث دول هي العراق وباكستان وبريطانيا.\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى حرب 1967، بعد سقوط الضفة الغربية بيد إسرائيل. إلا أن الوضع القانوني للمدينة ومعها الضفة الغربية بأكملها قد ظل بكونها جزءًا من حدود المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية حتى قرار فك الارتباط عام 1988، حيث تم إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطيني. وقد تخلى الأردن بموجبه عن المطالبة بالضفة الغربية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية، التي كانت قد عُينت سابقًا من قبل الجامعة العربية ك«ممثل شرعي وحيد للشعب الفلسطيني».\n\nالنكسة\nرزحت الخليل تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي وأصبحت مركزاً لمنطقة الخليل التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري إسرائيلي مباشرة، حيث احتلت إسرائيل مدينة الخليل في 5 يونيو 1967، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها، ويوجد داخل المدينة حاليا خمسة مواقع استيطانية يهودية وهي مستوطنة تل الرميده، والدبويا، ومدرسة أسامة بن المنقذ وسوق الخضار والاستراحة السياحية قرب المسجد الإبراهيمي الشريف، بالإضافة إلى التجمع الاستيطاني اليهودي على حدود المدينة الشرقية (كريات أربع وخارسينا).\nالخليل هي المدينة الفلسطينية الوحيدة التي اقيمت في قلبها مستوطنة. لأجل حرية حركة للمئات القلائل من المستوطنين اختارت إسرائيل سياسة رسمية مميزة ضد السكان الفلسطينيين في المدينة. مع مرور السنين أصبح مركز المدينة كمدينة اشباح.\n\nعلى مدار سنوات، تم إقامة عدد من نقاط الاستيطان الإسرائيلية في مدينة الخليل القديمة وضواحيها، وهي منطقة كانت بمثابة مركز تجاري لجنوب الضفة الغربية. وتقوم الجهات المسئولة عن القانون في إسرائيل وقوات الأمن الإسرائيلية بتكبيد ثمن حماية هذه النقاط الاستيطانية من جميع السكان الفلسطينيين. ولهذا الغرض، تنتهج إسرائيل نظامًا يستند بصورة صريحة ومكشوفة إلى «مبدأ الفصل»، الذي على ضوئه أوجدت إسرائيل عزلا (SEGREGATION) على الأرض وعزلاً قانونيًا ما بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية.\nوقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى انهيار الاقتصاد وسط مدينة الخليل ونزوح واسع للسكان الفلسطينيين. وتُظهر نتائج المسح الذي أُجري من أجل إعداد هذا التقرير، أن الفلسطينيين نزحوا عن ما لا يقل عن 1014 شقة سكنية في وسط مدينة الخليل، علمًا أن هذه الشقق تُشكل 41.9% من مجموع الشقق السكنية في هذه المنطقة. كما أن 65% من الشقق التي تم إخلاؤها، وعددها 659، نزح عنها سكانها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية. كما يتضح من نتائج المسح أن 1829 محلاً تجاريًا فلسطينيًا في المنطقة التي جرى مسحها أصبحت مهجورة اليوم، علما أن هذه المحلات التجارية المغلقة تشكل 76.6% من مجموع المحال التجارية في هذه المنطقة. 62.4% من المحال التجارية المغلقة، وعددها 1141 محلا، تم إغلاقها خلال الانتفاضة الثانية، وأن 440 محلًا منها جرى إغلاقها بأوامر عسكرية.\nإن المكونات الأساسية لـ«سياسة الفصل» الإسرائيلية تقوم على الحظر الشديد والواسع لحركة الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن فرض القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. كل هذا إلى جانب ما يلحق سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين من أذى مباشر من قبل القوات الإسرائيلية.\n\nالسلطة الفلسطينية\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية عام 1995، وأصبحت المدينة منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظة الخليل، كما وقعت معظم أراضي المحافظة ضمن تصنيف (أ) و (ب) حسب اتفاق أوسلو. في عام 1994، عندما كان سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو في أوجه، قام المستوطن اليهودي باروخ غولدشتاين بإطلاق النار على المسلمين الذين كانوا يصلون في الحرم الإبراهيمي وقتل 29 منهم وأصاب عددًا أكبر بكثير.\nاستمر سير عملية اتفاق أوسلو وفي شباط/فبراير 1997، تم توقيع اتفاق حول الانتشار الجزئي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الخليل، وتم تقسيم المدينة إلى قسمين: منطقة H1، والتي تم تسليم السيطرة عليها للسلطة الفلسطينية، ومنطقة H2 - التي بقيت تحت سيطرة الجيش الإسرائيلي. وفي أبريل/ نيسان 2002، سيطر جيش الإحتلال الإسرائيلي على المدينة بأكملها، ووضعت أبراج مراقبة ثابتة في منطقة H1 في المدينة في عام 2003.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع المدينة على هضبة ترتفع 940 م عن سطح البحر. يربطها طريق رئيسي بمدينتي بيت لحم والقدس، وتقع على الطريق الذي يمر بأواسط فلسطين رابطة الشام بمصر مروراً بسيناء.\nوقد بنيت الخليل على سفحي جبلي جبل الرميدة وجبل الرأس على ارتفاع 927 م، وفي الوادي بين الجبلين الذي يختلف اسمه على طول مجراه، حيث يعرف بوادي التفاح، وهو يخترق وسط الخليل.\nوتقع الخليل على بُعد 35 كم للجنوب من مدينة القدس، و46 كم غرب نهر الأردن، و152 كم جنوب مدينة جنين، و229 كم غرب مدينة الكرك الأردنية.\n\nمناطق المدينة\nتُقسم المدينة إلى البلدة القديمة والجديدة، من أهم الأحياء الجديدة في المدينة:\n\nأما البلدة القديمة فتتميز بعراقتها وأصالتها، ويعود تاريخ مبانيها إلى العهد الأيوبي والمملوكي والعثماني، وتمتاز البلدة القديمة بنظامها المعماري الرائع وفيها العديد من المباني الأثرية والتاريخية والقناطر والأزقة والأسواق القديمة. ومن أهم الأحياء القديمة في المدينة: حي الشيخ علي البكاء، حي القزازين، حي السواكنة، حي القلعة، حي بني دار، حارة العقابة، حي المحتسبيين، حي المدرسة، حي قيطون، حي المشارقة حي الأكراد، حي المشارقة الفوقا، وحي الحوشية.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في الخليل مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في أواخر شهر مارس (آذار) وأوائل أبريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) وأغسطس (آب) أحرّ شهور السنة، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة فيهما إلى 28.9 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، أما أكثر الأشهر برودة فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجة الحرارة إلى 3.9 ° مئوية (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو وأغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ أكتوبر (تشرين الأول) وأبريل (نيسان) عادةً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 إنش)، وتكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمتراً.\n\nالسكان\nالخليل أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية، حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها اليوم 200,000 نسمة (بحسب بلدية الخليل). ويذكر بأن عدد سكان الخليل مع مطلع القرن العشرين كان قد قدر بحوالي 8000 – 10000 نسمة فقط.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكانها عام 1922 م حوالي 16,577 نسمة منهم 430 يهودياً وعام 1945 م حوالي 24,560 نسمة وبلغ عدد سكانها عام 1967 م بعد الاحتلال حوالي 38,300 نسمة ارتفع إلى 79,100 نسمة عام 1987 م.\nأقامت سلطات الاحتلال أحزمة استيطانية حول المدينة وأنشأت أول مستوطنة هي (كريات أربع) تمهيداً لتطويق المدينة ومحاصرتها جغرافياً وسكانياً ومن أجل هذا الهدف صادرت مساحات واسعة من أراضيها وأقامت مستوطنتين عام 1981م هما مستوطنة (كرمل) وهي من نوع موشاف مساحتها 4 آلاف دونم ومستوطنة (ماعون) وأقامت سلطات الاحتلال حيا يهوديا في قلب المدينة، وبلغت مساحة الأراضي المصادرة من المدينة وما حولها حوالي 72700 دونم حتى عام 1981م وتبلغ عدد المستوطنات المقامة في المحافظة 34 مستوطنة حتى نهاية 1987م ومنها 26 مستوطنة تزيد مساحة الواحدة منها عن 25 دونم.\nالجدول الآتي يبين عدد سكان منطقة الخليل في فترات مختلفة:\n\nوأما الأصول العرقية لسكان المدينة، فبالرغم من وقوع الكثير من القصص العائلية تحت الأساطير التاريخية، إلا أن هناك جزء ليس بقليل من السكان، الذين نعرف أصولهم على وجه اليقين، منها الأصول العربية قبل الإسلامية (قبيلة لخم أجداد التميمية)، وأصول كردية (الأكراد)، وأصول عربية سورية (الجعابرة من قلعة جعبر على الضفاف السورية من نهر الفرات على بعد 35 من مدينة الرقة)، وأصول مغربية، وتركية، كما هاجر إلى الخليل عائلات من مدن فلسطينية مختلفة (القدس وعسقلان، أو من جبل الخليل مثل دورا ويطا على سبيل المثال). وانضم إلى السكان بعد النكبة عام 1948 عددا غير معروف من اللاجئين، الذين سكنوا داخل المدينة واختلطوا بأهلها.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالزراعة\nعلى الصعيد الزراعي عرفت الخليل منذ القدم بأنها مدينة تحيط بها الأراضي الزراعية من كل جانب واشتهرت في زراعة العنب والتين واللوز والمشمش والزيتون وتزرع الحبوب، والزراعة هي من أهم الحرف التي يمارسها السكان في محافظة الخليل، وهي تمثل موردًا اقتصاديًا هامًا، وقد بلغت المساحة المزروعة 338,400 دونم عام 2006-2007 ومن أهم المحاصيل الزراعية في الخليل الحبوب والخضار، والأشجار المثمرة مثل الزيتون واللوز والعنب والفواكة الأخرى، وتضم الخليل عددًا كبيرًا من الثروة الحيوانية، إذ تشكل 30.2% من جملة هذه الثروة في الضفة الغربية، ومن أهم أنواع الحيوانات الماعز والضأن.\n\nالصناعة\nمارس سكان الخليل الصناعة منذ القدم، حيث انتشرت الصناعة اليدوية، بل إن بعض حارات الخليل سميت بأسماء هذه الحرف، مثل سوق الحصرية وسوق الغزل وحارة الزجاجيين، ولمحافظة الخليل شهرة في صناعة الصابون ودباغة الجلود وصناعة الأكياس الكبيرة من شعر الحيوان ومعاطف الفرو والفخار والأحذية والنسيج والصناعات الخشبية والخزف والنسيج والهدايا، وحتى عام 1978 ضمت محافظة الخليل أكثر من ثلث الوحدات الصناعية في الضفة الغربية وهي: الصناعات الغذائية، النسيج والملابس، الجلود ومنتجاتها ماعدا الأحذية، الأحذية ما عدا المطاطية الأخشاب ما عدا الأثاث، الورق ومنتجاته، النشر والطباعة، الزجاج، صناعات غير معدنية، صناعات غير حديدية، تصنيع المواد المعدنية ومشتقاتها، صناعة الأدوات الكهربائية.\nوتشتهر المدينة أيضًا بكثير من الصناعات المحلية التي تصدر أيضا إلى الخارح بكميات كبيرة وخصوصا إلى الأسواق الأوروبية، ومن أهم الصناعات في الخليل:\n\nصناعة الزجاج - وتعود إلى تاريخ المدينة القديم وقد تم نطويرها لتواكب التطور الحاضر.\nصناعة الخزف والفخار - وهي أيضا من تاريخ المدينة القديم.\nصناعة الجلود - تستخدم في صناعة الأحذية بشكل كبير حيث يتم تصدير الأحذية إلى عدة دول أهمها: إيطاليا وإسبانيا والأردن ودول الخليج. حيث تعتبر هذه الصناعة من أهم مصادر دخل المدينة.\nصناعة الملابس بكل أنواعها - تجدر الإشارة إلى أن أكبر ثوب في العالم حيك يدويا موجود في مدينة الخليل (وسجل في موسوعة غينيس).\nصناعة الباطون.\nمناشير الحجر والرخام والبلاط - وهي أيضا من أهم مصادر الدخل الاقتصادي للمدينة، حيث تصدر إلى معظم الدول الاوربية والعربية.\nصناعنة الحديد والألمنيوم.\nصناعة الدراجات الهوائية.\nصناعة النايلون\nصناعة الموازين والقبانات القديمة والحديثة.\nصناعة الألبان والمنتجات الغذائية\nصناعة الأثاث المنزلي والسجاد والعطور.\n\nالتجارة\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بالتجارة حيث يعتبر أهلها من أمهر التجار في فلسطين، وتنتشر الأسواق في الخليل بكثرة، حتى أنها تعتبر كل المدينة سوق. ولقد حظيت محافظة الخليل بمركز تجاري، إذ يأتي إليها الفلاحون والبدو من المناطق المحيطة بها على الرغم من أنها فقدت نصف قضائها عام 1948، وزادت قوة هذا المركز بعد ارتفاع مستوى المعيشة وتطور وسائل النقل فاتسعت الأسواق المركزية وشملت معظم مساحة المدينة القديمة وبنيت أسواق متخصصة جديدة.\nولقد أغلق جنود الاحتلال الإسرائيلي مؤخرا عدد كبير من المحلات التجارية في الخليل. وتأتي عملية الإغلاق في اطار السياسة التي تتبعها السلطات الإسرائيلية بكل ما يتعلق بوسط الخليل، والقائمة على نظام فصل يهدف إلى حماية البؤر الاستيطانية المتعددة التي أقيمت في هذه المنطقة. هذا النظام يتجسد من خلال الفصل الميداني والقانوني بين المستوطنين الإسرائيليين وبين الغالبية الفلسطينية، المنع الواسع والقيود المفروضة على حركة وتنقل الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن تطبيق القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. وينضاف إلى هذا كله استهداف سكان المدينة الفلسطينيين بأيدي عناصر قوات الأمن. وقد أدت هذه السياسة إلى حدوث انهيار اقتصادي وسط الخليل ورحيل السكان الفلسطينيين بصورة واسعة.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط\nما كان شارع رئيسي في المركز التجاري لمدينة الخليل، مغلق للفلسطينيين منذ عام 2000. أغلق الجيش الإسرائيلي جميع الدكاكين وأبواب المنازل. يستعمل الشارع فقط لعبور المستوطنين. في تاريخ 25.12.06 أصدر المستشار القضائي للجيش الإسرائيلي في الضفة الغربية قرار انه: تم إغلاق الشارع بالخطأ وانه لا يوجد لذلك مبرر قانوني ويجب عدم منع حركة الفلسطينيين في الشارع. رغم قرار المستشار القضائي بأن إغلاق الشارع غير قانوني إلا أن الجيش الإسرائيلي ما زال يمنع الفلسطينيين من العبور في شارع الشهداء.\nومن الشوارع المهمة شـارع عين ساره حيث يقع فيه مبنى البلدية؛ وأهم ملعب كرة قدم في المدينة ملعب الحسين والعديد من المدارس والمباني الحكومية. كما تقع فيه أيضًا مغارة عيـن سارة وهي مغارة صغيرة وفيها نبع ماء، حيث يعتقد بان سكان المدينة كانوا يستعملوها للإستحمام فيها، بمن فيهم سارة زوجة إبراهيم، لهذا نسب الاسم لها.\nومن أهم الشوارع الأخرى: باب الزاوية (مركز المدينة)، رأس الجورة (مدخل المدينة)، عين خير الدين، الجوزات، حارة الشيخ، حارة أبو سنينة، خلة أبو مجنونة، حبايل الرياح، شارع السلام، جبل نمرة، واد الهرية، حارة القزازين، الشلالة، المحاور، جبل جوهر، الكرنتينه، قيزون، الشعابة، فرش الهوى، قرن الثور، واد التفاح القديم (شارع رئيسي)، واد التفاح الجديد (شارع رئيسي)، بئر الحمص، ضاحية الرامة، خلة حاضور، خلة بطرخ، شارع المدارس، شارع العدل (شارع رئيسي)، الحرس، الفحص (المنطقة الصناعية)، ضاحية الزيتون، ضاحية اسكان البلدية، سوق اللبن، عيصى، سنجر، واد الجوز، ننقر، جبل الشريف، جبل سنداس، وادي أبو اكتيلة، تل الرميدة (منطقة اثرية)، حي الجامعة (جامعة الخليل)، شارع عثمان بن عفان (شارع رئيسي يربط جنوب الخليل بشمالها ويمتد حتى يصل احياء قيزون، حي الرامة وصولا إلى رأس الجورة (وهو مغلق حاليا أمام حركة السكان الفلسطينيين ويستخدمه المستوطنون للوصول من مستوطنة كريات أربع إلى الحرم الإبراهيمي)، شارع واد النصارى أو شارع بيار المحاور وهو شارع يربط شارع الكسارة من الشرق بشارع عثمان بن عفان من الغرب وهو مغلق حاليا أمام حركة السيارات الفلسطينية ويستخدمه مستوطنو كريات أربع للوصول إلى الحرم الإبراهيمي مشيًا على الأقدام في أيام السبت)، حي واد الحصين، حي واد النصارى، حي الراس.\n\nالهوية المعمارية\nوتعتبر الخليل من المدن التي حافظت على استمرارية الإستقرار البشري على مر العصور بالرغم من عمليات التدمير والتهجير لقدسيتها المميزة وموقعها الإستراتيجي بالإشارة إلى منطقة تل الرميدة ونمرة والبلدة القديمة. للمباني العامة كالمدرسة القيمرية والفخرية والسلطان حسن والحمامات كحمام إبراهيم الخليل وحمام داري وحمام البركة وحمام كاتبة بدر وحمام الشيخ بدير وقنوات المياه والبرك والأسبلة كسبيل الطواشي وصحن الحرم وسيف الدين سلار وسبيل وقناة العين الحمراء والرباطات والتكية والزوايا ومسجد ابن عثمان ومسجد القزازين.\nتشكيل المباني السكنية للأحواش الصغيرة والكبيرة واتصالها معا والمباني السكنية كمسكن آل سلهب ومجمع الحرباوي ومسكن آل شاهين ومسكن قصر الدويك ومسكن آل الإمام ومواد البناء من حجارة وفخار وجير ورماد ومخلوط الرماد والشيد -القصرمل- والأخشاب وبقايا الزيوت -الزيبار- وطرق إنشاء المباني من أساسات وجدران وأسقف، والحرف التقليدية في مدينة الخليل من صناعة الزجاج والفخار والخزف ودباغة الجلود وتبييض النحاس وحرفة النجارة والحدادة والغزل والنسيج ومعاصر زيت الزيتون والسمسم والحفظ بالتجفيف والتمليح والسكر وصناعة طحن الحبوب.\nلقد جاءت فكرة تأسيس لجنة إعمار الخليل القديمة عام 1996 لمعالجة مشاكل الإسكان والمساكن والمشاكل الاجتماعية وبناء علاقات محلية ودولية وتوثيق الموروث الثقافي والإشراف والترميم وعمل مخططات الحفاظ على البلدة القديمة وإشغال المباني والخدمات الاجتماعية والمتابعات القانونية والصدامات المتكررة مع الجيش والمستوطنين والأوامر العسكرية التي تمنع الترميم.\n\nيشار بالذكر إلى أن هناك مذكرة أعدتها بلدية الخليل من أجل ترشيح البلدة القديمة على لائحة التراث العالمي لليونسكو، حمايةً للمعالم الأثرية التي قامت إسرائيل بتغيير بعضها، أو بضم البعض الآخر إلى قائمة التراث اليهودي الخاص بها.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nتضم الخليل مجموعة من المعالم الدينية والتاريخية والسياحية التي تشجع السياح على زيارة المدينة، وخاصة البلدة القديمة، حيث توجد بها مجموعة من المعالم السياحية والأبنية التاريخية المهمة مثل المسجد الإبراهيمي، إلى جانب وجود مجموعة من المتاحف أهمها: متحف الخليل، وتوجد فيها مجموعة من المنتزهات والحدائق العامة أهمها: منتزه الكرمل.\nومن خلال دراسة الاكتشافات الأثرية في منطقة الخليل وقضائها، من حيث خصائصها ومميزاتها ومواصفاتها والمادة الخام المستخدمة وطبيعة الرسومات، تبين أن الكنعانيين هم أول من استوطن المنطقة أقاموا فيها الكثير من مدنهم وقراهم، وبنوا الخليل القديمة، وقد بقى من هذه المدينة القديمة بعض الآثار التي تدل على مكانها. كما تحوي اثارا رومانية وبيزنطية وأموية وصليبية ومملوكية وعثمانية.\nومن خلال البحث بمورفولوجيا البلدة القديمة بالخليل من حيث هيئة العمران وتخطيط المدينة وحاراتها، يمكن تقسيمها إلى الحارات التالية: حارة القزازين وحارة السواكنة وحارة بني دار وحارة العقابة وحارة القلعة وحارة الحوشية وحارة المحتسبية وحارة مدرسة المعارف وحارة الأكراد وحارة اليهود وحارة المشارقة بالإضافة إلى الحارات المنفصلة عن البلدة القديمة كحارة قيطون وحارة الشيخ علي بكا. أما الأسواق، فهناك: سوق البازار وسوق الخواجات وسوق الخضار وسوق السكافية وسوق اللبن وسوق المغاربة وسوق القزازين.\nبعد احتلال المدينة من قبل إسرائيل في عام 1967 م شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينة ثم في داخلها حيث يوجد حاليِا خمس مواقع استيطانية يهودية، مما أثر على وضع المدينة السياحي بشكل سلبي إلى حد كبير.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظة الخليل مرتبة متقدمة في نسب التعليم بالأراضي الفلسطينية، حيث أن المعدل العام للأمية في الأراضي الفلسطينية هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من أقل النسب عربياً).\nويواجه التعليم في الخليل مجموعة من التحديات، إضافة إلى أن مؤسساتها التربوية تتميز بخاصية أيضا تختلف عن باقي المؤسسات التربوية في المناطق المجاورة.\nوقد تم مؤخرًا افتتاح مشروع تحسين جودة برامج التعليم في العلوم الاجتماعية للمرحلة الأساسية العليا للصفوف الخامس - العاشر.\n\nالتعليم المدرسي\nويوجد في المدينة العديد من المدارس لمختلف المراحل الدراسية؛ حكومية، أهلية، ووكالة. وفيها عدد من المعاهد وكليات المجتمع وفيها جامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين ومعهد العروب وفيها جامعة الخليل تأسست عام 1971. وقد بلغ عدد الأبنية المدرسية في مديرية التربية والتعليم في الخليل في عام 2011 ما يزيد عن 132 مدرسة ينتظم فيها 66 ألف طالبًا وطالبة موزعين في مدارس وسط المدينة وفي المنطقة الجنوبية، وكذلك في قرى تفوح وبيت كاحل وترقوميا، كما أن هنالك 36 مدرسة تقع في منطقة H2 والتي تخضع للسيطرة الإسرائيلية الكاملة وهي الأكثر تضرراً فيما يخص الأبنية المدرسية بسبب منع الاحتلال مديرية تربية الخليل بناء الطوابق والمدارس في تلك المنطقة، وتواجه مديرية تربية الخليل ازدياد سنوي كبير في أعداد الطلبة الملتحقين بنظام التعليم الحكومي، مما يؤدي إلى اكتظاظ في الصفوف الدراسية.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nجامعة الخليل.\nجامعة بولتكنيك فلسطين.\nكلية العروب التقنية (العروب).\nجامعة القدس المفتوحة.\n\nالثقافة\nشكلت الثقافة جزءًا من هوية سكان منطقة الخليل منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الأغلب ثقافة تعبر عن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني، ويظهر الاختلاف بشكل واضح في اللكنة أو للهجة التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقة عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينية بقلب القاف إلى ألف، كما تمتاز اللهجة الخليلية بطول النغمة الموسيقية والكلمات بها. أما بالنسبة للزي التقليدي، فيتميز في منطقة الخليل وجنوب الضفة الغربية عن غيره من الأزياء الفلسطينية الأخرى ببساطته ولونه الأحمر والأبيض المقلم. كما توجد في الخليل مجموعات شبابية متعددة تهتم بالأدب والثقافة الفلسطينية والعربية، ومن أهمها الندوة الثقافية في الخليل.\n\nالأكلات الشعبية\nتشتهر مدينة الخليل بكروم العنب، والتي بدورها دخلت في كثير من طعامهم، فيصنعون منه الدبس والعنطبيخ (مربى العنب) (عنب طبيخ، ويسمونه في القضاء عنبية) والخبيصة والملبن المشهور والراووق (الراووء) والبوء سما والزبيب ومخلل الحصرم.\nكما تشتهر بمنتجات الألبان وخاصة اللبن المخيض واللبن الجميد ذائع الصيت من قرى الخليل والذي يعتبر بحق من أفضل أنواع الجميد ولذلك اشتهرت الخليل بأكلة اللبن المعقود والمنسف الفلسطيني الأصل، وكذلك الجبنة البيضاء المغلية التي تؤكل مع العنب أو البطيخ أو الخيار أو مقلية محمرة أو تنقع في الماء لإزالة ملوحتها واستعمالها في الحلويات كالكنافة والقطايف.\nومن أهم الأكلات التي تشتهر بها مدينة الخليل (القدرة الخليلية)، وهي عبارة عن الأرز مع قطع لحم الخروف البلدي أو الدجاج والسمنة البلدية تطبخ في قدر نحاسي مع بعضها البعض في الفرن الشعبي، بالإضافة إلى المنسف والمقلوبة والمجدرة.\n\nالرياضة\nيلعب في الخليل عدة أندية رياضية سواء في كرة القدم أو كرة السلة أو رياضات أخرى كالفروسية، منها: الخليل الرياضي، أهلي الخليل، خليل الرحمن، وشباب الخليل - الذي يُعد أقدمها وأقدم الأندية الفلسطينية على الإطلاق (تأسس عام 1943م). شارك بعض هذه الأندية في بطولات كرة القدم في الضفة الغربية (الدوري الأردني) قبل عام 1967، وتشارك اليوم في بطولة كأس فلسطين.\nوتحوي الخليل ملعبًا يتسع لحوالي 15 ألف متفرج، وهو ملعب الحسين بن علي، تم إعادة تدشينه في عام 2009م بعد افتتاحه لأول مرة في أربعينيات القرن الفائت. كما تحوي فيها أكبر صالة رياضيه في فلسطين، تم افتتاحها سنة 2011م من خلال مباراة بكرة السلة جمعت بين فريق فلسطيني وفريق إسباني.\n\nالصحة\nعلى الصعيد الصحي في المدينة 3 مستشفيات وهي مستشفى الأميرة عالية ويحتوي على 100 سرير، ومستشفى خليل الرحمن والمستشفى الأهلي التابع لجمعية أصدقاء المريض، بالإضافة إلى العديد من العيادات الصحية وعددها في المحافظة 37 عيادة.\n\nمستشفى الأميرة عالية الحكومي.\nمستشفى محمد علي المحتسب الحكومي.\nالمستشفى الأهلي، التابع لجمعية أصدقاء المريض.\nمستشفى جمعية الهلال الأحمر الفلسطيني – فرع الخليل.\n\nمستشفى الميزان التخصصي.\nمستشفى «سان جون» للعيون. (فرع الخليل، تابع لمستشفى «سان جون» في القدس).\nمستشفى أبو الحسن القاسم الحكومي في يطا.\nمستشفى دورا الحكومي في دورا.\nمستشفى الرئيس محمود عباس الحكومي في حلحول.\nمستشفى شهيرة للولادة في حلحول.\n\nبالإضافة إلى العديد من العيادات الصحية وعددها في المحافظة 37 عيادة.\n\nالخليل تحت الاحتلال\nبنيت مستعمرة إسرائيلية «كريات أربع» بجانب الخليل. ومن الجدير بالذكر أن مسجد الخليل الحرم الإبراهيمي سيطر عليه الجيش الإسرائيلي مانعاً الكثير من المسلمين من دخوله، وبانياً كنيساً يهودياً فيه. والمسجد الإبراهيمي الآن مقسّم إلى قسمين، قسم للمسلمين وقسم أكبر لليهود. كما تم تقسيم المدينة إلى قسمين، أحدهم تابع للسيطرة الأمنية الفلسطينية والآخر يتبع للسيطرة الأمنية الإسرائيلية.\n\nمجزرة الحرم الإبراهيمي\nفي صباح يوم 25 فبراير من عام 1994م، ارتكب المستوطنون اليهود مجزرة في المسجد الإبراهيمي بقيادة باروخ جولدشتاين، وهو طبيب يهودي بالتواطؤ مع عدد من المستوطنين والجيش في حق المصلين، حيث أطلق النار على المصلين المسلمين في المسجد الإبراهيمي أثناء أدائهم لصلاة فجر يوم جمعة في شهر رمضان، وقد قتل 29 مصليًا، وجرح العشرات.\n\nالوجود الدولي في الخليل\n(بالإنجليزية: Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron) منذ 1994 وبعد مجزرة الحرم الإبراهيمي، تم إرسال ما سمي بالوجود الدولي المؤقت في الخليل (بالإنجليزية: TIPH) إلى المدينة لإعمال المراقبة والمتابعة وكتابة التقارير. وقام الوجود الدولي في الخليل بنشاطات اجتماعية وثقافية وقام أيضا بدعم العديد من المؤسسات الخاصة والحكومية في المدينة.\n\nالمخيمات الفلسطينية\nيوجد في منطقة الخليل مخيمان مُسجلان رسميًا في وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا)، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفة الغربية، فقد بُنيت فوق قطعتين من الأرض قامت الأونروا باستئجارها من الحكومة الأردنية. والمخيمان هما:\n\nمخيم الفوار:\nيُعد أقصى مخيم في جنوب الضفة الغربية، تأسس عام 1949 فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.27 كيلومتر مربع على مسافة 10 كيلومترات إلى الجنوب من الخليل. وينحدر أصل سكان المخيم من 18 قرية تابعة لمناطق غزة والخليل وبئر السبع، الذين يبلغون اليوم أكثر من 8,000 لاجئ مسجل. ويعتمد سكان المخيم بشكل كلي تقريبًا على العمل داخل إسرائيل، وقد تأثروا بشكل خاص بشكل حاد بسبب عدم إمكانية الوصول إلى سوق العمل الإسرائيلي. ويتمتع مخيم الفوار بالتوأمة مع مدينة فرنسية توفر له الفعاليات الثقافية والقليل من التمويل للمشروعات مثل تأسيس مختبر للحاسوب. وتتصل كافة المساكن بالبنية التحتية لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامة، وذلك على الرغم من أنها ليست جميعها ليست متصلة بنظام الصرف الصحي.\n\nمخيم العروب:\n\nتأسس عام 1949 على مسافة 15 كيلومتر إلى الجنوب من بيت لحم فوق مساحة من الأرض تبلغ 0.24 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وينحدر أصل سكان المخيم من 33 قرية تابعة للرملة والخليل وغزة، الذين يبلغون اليوم 10,400 لاجئ مسجل. وترتبط كافة المنازل في المخيم بالبنية التحتية للكهرباء والمياه العامة؛ وهناك بيت واحد من بين كل مئة بيت غير متصل بشبكة المجاري العامة وبالتالي فإن دورات المياه فيه تصب في حفر امتصاصية. ويقع المخيم على الطريق الرئيسي الواصل بين القدس والخليل، وهو يتعرض بشكل متقطع للاجتياحات الإسرائيلية.\n\nانتخابات 2006\nحيث فازت حركة حماس تقريبا بكامل أصوات وجميع المقاعد الفردية\nأما القوائم فلم يكن لحركة فتح سوى ثلاثة مقاعد هي سحر القواسمة ودياب الهيموني وأبو علي يطا فقط.\n\nاختفاء المستوطنين الثلاثة\nفي يوم 12 حزيران/يونيو 2014 تم الإعلان عن اختفاء ثلاثة مستوطنين قرب الخليل واتهمت إسرائيل حركة حماس بذلك وفرضت طوقاً عسكرياً على المدينة ومنعت عمال المدينة من دخول إسرائيل وكذلك من عبور معبر الكرامة وأغلقت مداخل المدينة وقراها بمكعبات إسمنتية\n\nالأعلام\nخرج من الخليل عددٌ من المشاهير، منهم:\n\nعز الدين الخطيب التميمي، توفي عام 2008م، كان وزير الأوقاف والشؤون والمقدسات الإسلامية في الأردن، وشغل مناصب عديدة أخرى: المفتي العام للمملكة، ومستشار جلالة الملك للشؤون الإسلامية قاضي القضاة، وعضو مجلس الأعيان، ورئيس أمناء جامعة آل البيت، ورئيس هيئة المركز الأردني لبحوث التعايش الديني، وعضو هيئة الأردن أولاً.\nأسعد بيوض التميمي، توفي عام 2008م، كان من المؤسسين الأوائل لحزب التحرير في فلسطين، وحركة الجهاد الإسلامي الفلسطينية، وخطيب المسجد الأقصى سابقًا.\nعبد القديم زلوم، توفي عام 2003م، الأمير الثاني لحزب التحرير بعد الشيخ تقي الدين النبهاني.\nمحمد رشاد الشريف، أحد مشاهير قراء القرآن الكريم في العالم الإسلامي، ومقرئ المسجد الأقصى المبارك والمسجد الإبراهيمي في الخليل. ويؤمّ حالياً مسجد الملك عبد الله الأول في الأردن.\nعزيز الدويك، رئيس المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني منذ عام 2006م.\nأحمد الجعبري، نائب القائد العام لكتائب القسام والقائد الفعلي لها على الأرض، يطلق عليه «رئيس أركان حركة حماس».\nداود الزعتري، رئيس بلدية الخليل في الفترة 2012–2017، ورئيس سابق لعدة جامعات فلسطينية.\n\nتوأمة المدن\nهناك اتفاقيات توأمة بين الخليل مع مدنٍ أُخرى، وهي:\n\nعمان -  الأردن\nبيزا –  إيطاليا\nبلفورد –  فرنسا\nقرطبة –  إسبانيا\nفاس –  المغرب\nالدار البيضاء –  المغرب\nالمدينة المنورة -  السعودية\nمدينةجنوا -  إيطاليا\nمدينة اركوري -  فرنسا\n\nانظر أيضًا\nجامعة بوليتكنك فلسطين\nجامعة الخليل\nالبلدة القديمة (الخليل)\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجية\nجميع صور مدينة الخليل",
      "summary": "الخَلِيل مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة الخليل إداريًا، تقع في الضفة الغربية إلى الجنوب من القدس بحوالي 35 كم. أسسها الكَنعَانِيون في العصر البرونزي المبكر، وتُعد اليوم أكبر مدن الضفة الغربية من حيث عدد السكان والمساحة، حيث بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2016 بقرابة 215 ألف نسمة، وتبلغ مساحتها 42 كم2. تمتاز المدينة بأهمية اقتصادية، حيث تُعد من أكبر المراكز الاقتصادية في الضفة الغربية. وللخليل أهمية دينية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث، حيث يتوسط المدينة المسجد الإبراهيمي الذي يحوي مقامات للأنبياء إبراهيم، وإسحق، ويعقوب، وزوجاتهم.\nتُقسم مدينة الخليل حاليّاً إلى البلدة القديمة والحديثة، وتديرها بلدية الخليل التي أُسِّسَت عام 1927، كما أنها مركز محافظة الخليل التي يضم التقسيم الإداري الحالي لها العشرات من القرى والبلدات، ويُقدر عدد سكان المحافظة بأكثر من 684 ألف نسمة (2014). تقع البلدة القديمة بمحاذاة المسجد الإبراهيمي. وهي عبارة عن أزقّة وبيوت ودكاكين قديمة، وتضم العديد من الأسواق. تقوم إسرائيل بإغلاق أجزاء كبيرة منها وتنشر قوات من الجيش الإسرائيلي فيها لوجود تجمّع حديث لليهود الأرثوذكس يسعى للسيطرة على العقارات في تلك المنطقة. تسيطر إسرائيل على حوالي 20% من مساحة المدينة بحسب إتفاق إعادة الإنتشار في الخليل في عام 1997، ولكن تتحمل السلطة الفلسطينية إدارة الشؤون المدنية للفلسطينيين فيها. يحيط بالمدينة أيضًا الكثير من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، أكبرها مستوطنة كريات أربع، والمستوطنات والتجمعات اليهودية تحتكم لجسم بلدي منفصل. وتعد المدينة من المدن المقدسة الأربع في الديانة اليهودية.\nفي السابع من تموز 2017، أدرجت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة «اليونسكو» البلدة القديمة في مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على قائمة التراث العالمي المُهدد بالخطر بوصفها منطقة تُعرف بقيمتها العالمية، وقد حصلت مدينة الخليل والمسجد الإبراهيمي على أغلبية أصوات الدول المشاركة في التصويت الذي جرى في مدينة كراكوف البولندية.",

      "content": "## Overview\nHebron (Arabic: الخليل al-Ḫalīl; Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Ḥevron, Ḥeḇrôn, or Ḥebron) is an ancient city in the southern West Bank. It is the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. This makes it a significant religious site for the Abrahamic religions. In 2017, the old town was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n## Understand\nHebron is mentioned in the Bible as the home of Abraham, and the burial place of him and several generations of his family. In King David's time, Hebron was briefly the capital of the Israelite state, before the capital moved to Jerusalem. Today, Hebron is holy to both Muslims and Jews due to its association with Abraham. (Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, but Christians haven't paid as much attention to Hebron.)\nThe Jewish population of Hebron was evacuated after Arabs killed nearly 70 of them in 1929. After the 1967 war, a few Jews resettled the Jewish quarter. Today, about 500 Jews live in part of the old city of Hebron under continual Israel Defense Force protection, and with a ratio of four Israeli soldiers for each Israeli settler.\nToday, the city of Hebron is home to about 500 Jews and 200,000 Palestinians. The Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba (population 8,000) is a separate city immediately adjacent to Hebron. Hebron is divided into two sectors: H1 is entirely Palestinian and includes about 80% of the city's residents, while H2 contains all the Jews and the remainder of the Arabs. H1 is under full Palestinian control (i.e. Area A), while H2 is under full Israel control. The Cave of the Patriarchs, the main holy site in the city, is on the border between H1 and H2.\nThis has been one of the tensest places between Jews and Palestinians, as in Hebron both sides here tend to be more extreme and violent than the average for their ethnic groups. Jews here have the 1929 massacre on their minds, while Palestinians have Baruch Goldstein's 1994 massacre of praying Muslims on theirs. This is not a good place to express your opinion on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Even Jewish residents here have an often-hostile relationship with the Israel army, because they see it as being too accommodating to Palestinians. Unfortunately, the 2017 declaration of the Old Town as a UNESCO world heritage site has done little to ease the tensions, as the Israeli government protested its classification as an \"endangered\" \"Palestinian\" site, despite its Jewish heritage.\n\n## Get in\nIf you are visibly Jewish, it is probably not safe to travel unaccompanied to the \"other\" side of Hebron. However, if you look and sound like an international tourist, you should be fine on both sides.\n\n## To the Jewish side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 381 or 383 from the CBS (₪8.10) to the Jewish side of Hebron. The third from the last stop (Me'arat Hamahpela) is in front of the Cave of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side. The final stop (Beit Romano) is a five minute walk from an H1/H2 checkpoint.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Take bus 254 (₪13.50), which terminates at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, from where you can take 381 or 383 over to the Jewish side of Hebron. This transfer might be free if you show them the bus 254 ticket.\n\n## To the Palestinian side\nFrom Jerusalem – Take bus 21 from the Sultan Suleiman bus station just out and to the right from Damascus gate. Tell them Hebron or Al-Khalil (Arabic). They will take you to a mid way drop off point at the Bethlehem bus station. From there, go to the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station where a servees (the Palestinian version of a sherut, called a serv-eese in Arabic) will deliver you to Hebron for less than ₪10.\nAlternatively, take the bus to Abu Dis and tell the bus driver you are going to Khalil.\nFrom Bethlehem – As mentioned before, from the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station (at Manger Street) a servees will deliver you to Hebron for ₪9.\nFrom Ramallah – Direct servees to Hebron depart from one of the many bus stations in Ramallah, just ask around. It might be faster to go to Bethlehem first, though.\nFrom Be'er Sheva – Make your way to the last stop in front of the Church of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side, as explained before. From there just walk further passing by at least three Israeli checkpoints, with the 31.52653135.1022061 last checkpoint being a gate which \"delivers\" you to the Palestinian side. Alternatively, you can directly enter the Palestinian side via a 31.5245335.1099742 gate to the left of the Muslim entrance of the Church of the Patriarchs, after which however you will need to go through a lengthy and little depressing souq alley.\n\n## Crossing between the sides\nThere are at least two gates that allow pedestrian traffic between the Palestinian and Jewish sides. The most convenient gate for travelers is the Bab El-Zawiya crossing, a five minute walk from the Beit Romano bus stop on David Hamelech Street. Parking for Israeli registered vehicles is possible just before the crossing.\nThere is a myth that it is impossible to access the Jewish side of Hebron on foot coming from the highway/main road. However, this was likely only true in tense times, because there were no gates and metal detectors you could be checked with, although this has since changed. Generally, Palestinian taxi drivers are not allowed to drive to the Jewish side. In that case, you will need to go by taxi or bus from an Israeli town or a Jewish settlement (like Kiryat Arba). Either way, internationals can drive into the Jewish side, if your driver is not Palestinian.\nIt is now possible to make a long (25 min) walk from Kiryat Arba to the Cave of the Patriarchs directly via a stubby sidewalk. If that is not possible directly for some reason, walk via the Palestinian side and then through one of the gates coming from Be'er Sheva.\n\n## In general\nThe 31.52723935.098661 Hebron Bus Station for servees to and from the surrounding areas, and even Bethlehem and Ramallah is on the upper floors of the Jeel-Saed shopping centre along Adel Street.\nOn the Palestinian side of Hebron, taxi rides within the city shouldn't cost more than ₪10-15. For seeing sights out-of-town, it's best to take a servees taxi at the service-taxi/bus station or negotiate a fair price with a taxi driver. Make sure to agree on a price for a taxi before getting in.\nOn the Jewish side of Hebron, a 10-minute walk will take you from one end to the other.\n\n## See\n31.5248735.110711 Cave of the Patriarchs (al Haram al Ibrahimi/Ibrahimi Mosque, Ma'arat HaMachpelah/Machpelah Cave). The main religious site in the city. The cave, where the Patriarchs and their wives are buried, is deep underground. Now, people pray in a building on top of the cave, built by King Herod about 2000 years ago. The building is divided into Muslim and Jewish sections. Visitors are welcome to visit both sides when they are not being used for scheduled prayer. The Muslim side provides cloaks for women to cover up when visiting. The Muslim side contains the only known entrance to the Cave below (it is locked by a marble door), as well as the tomb-markers of Isaac and Rebecca. The tomb-markers of Abraham and Sarah lie on the border of both the Muslim and Jewish sections, while the Jewish section contains the tomb-markers of Jacob and Leah. Most of the time, half of the building is used for Muslim and half for Jewish prayer. On a few predetermined days each year, each religion gets to use the entire building. For the Jews, in addition to the normal holidays, one of these days is \"Shabbat Chayei Sarah\" each fall, on which thousands of people from all of Israel visit Hebron to commemorate Abraham's purchase of the Cave from its previous Hittite owners. For the Muslims, it is on Fridays during Ramadan, and during the Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha holiday, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son. The Cave of the Patriarchs is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the contested recognition of it led the US's and Israel's 2017 decision to leave the UNESCO on 31 Dec 2018.\n31.52514835.1056822 Beit Romano.

In this place archaeological digging revealed the ruins of a 4,500 years old city wall and staircase. On top of which a building with apartments was erected standing on pillars. In this building, also the Hebron Observatory can be found – just walk up the stairs inside of the building and hope the upper door is not locked. According to the nearby stationed Israeli Army, this is one of the most tense places in Hebron, because Palestinian and Jewish houses are built right next to each other with no fences or walls – you will notice by the different large flags posted in front of two houses.\n31.52446335.1018154 Tomb of Yishai (Jesse) and Ruth (close to Tel Hebron, follow the signs).

However, it is available in restaurants like \"Abu Mazen\" and \"Alquds\" in Ras el jora. It could be expensive for local citizens. The dish for one person with drinks would cost around ₪35.\nIf you are a sweet lover, do not miss to get some sweets from the many sweets shops around in Hebron.

For those who don't enjoy coffee, most cafés also serve orange, carrot and pomegranate juice cheaply.\n31.525335.10641 Badran Café (قهوة بدران).

From ₪280.\n\n## Touts\nIt seems like there are many \"guides\" running around, trying to catch tourists on the basis of charity or political activism, showing you pictures of other westerners they have supposedly worked together with. They even suggest you're Jewish if you don't tell them your nationality, and might become pushy asking for money.\nThis tout-like behavior leaves some doubts whether they really stand for what they are claiming. If you just don't want to be bothered, tell them you have been here before and not interested this time. Be firm, you have nothing to fear from these guys. Hebron definitely is a very political place, but you should decide for yourself whether to take action.\nIn general, be wary of unofficial guides, which mostly will try to take you from one place to the other where you will likely buy something, so they can make their share from the shop owner. They will even ruthlessly tell you that something is closed or might take too long (like the Church of the Patriarchs), which is not true, just to make sure you spend more time potentially spending money. Better to use a regular guide with an agreed and claimable schedule.\n\n## Security\nMany people are hesitant to come to Hebron, because they get told by hostel owners (e.g. in Bethlehem, for apparent reasons) that Hebron is unsafe. However, Hebron is no less safe than any other city in the West Bank during \"peace times\". Also, if you are non-Jewish you are not a threat or target, for that matter, to/for any Palestinian, and you are likely to be greeted with the characteristic \"welcome!\" in the city center. However, in some of the Palestinian suburbs around the Kiryat Arba settlement, tourists are not a regular occurrence and a small minority of locals may be less friendly, especially if they believe you to be associated with the settlement.\nIn addition, the special situation makes it a must if you want to understand more about the conflict.\n\n## Go next\nNearby popular sights in the West Bank, that allow for a day trip from Hebron, include Tor-Safa Cave, Taffuh Underground Church, Tomb of Prophet Lot and Birkat al-Karmil (Holy Pool).\nBethlehem – The biblical birthplace of Jesus and hometown of David.\nJerusalem – Besides the Dead Sea, a central focus for most people coming to Israel.\nJericho – One of the oldest settlements in the world and the Middle East.\nNegev & Judaean – Deserts close to the Dead Sea, featuring amazing sites and desert landscapes, including the Ramon Crater and two other craters.\nHiking in the Judaean Desert – Go out to other nearby hiking trails; particularly the Mishmar and Ze'elim streams are very close by.\nDead Sea – One of the most famous things to see or do in Israel and Jordan.\nFor bus travel to destinations in Israel, Egged runs various routes from/via inside Kiryat Alba. You may have a hard time gaining admittance to the settlement, but you might still be able to catch the buses at the settlement's 31.5417535.1323334 entrance/exit gate near the highway. Failing that, it will probably be necessary to take a bus to Jerusalem to interchange for onward travel.",
