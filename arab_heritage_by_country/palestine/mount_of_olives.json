      "content": "The Mount of Olives or Mount Olivet (Hebrew: הַר הַזֵּיתִים, romanized: Har ha-Zeitim; Arabic: جبل الزيتون, romanized: Jabal az-Zaytūn; both lit. 'Mount of Olives'; in Arabic also الطور, Aṭ-Ṭūr, 'the Mountain') is a mountain ridge in East Jerusalem, east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City. It is named for the olive groves that once covered its slopes. The southern part of the mount was the Silwan necropolis, attributed to the elite of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. The western slopes of the mount, those facing Jerusalem, have been used as a Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the tradition of Jewish cemeteries. Atop the hill lies the Palestinian neighbourhood of At-Tur, a former village that is now part of East Jerusalem.\nSeveral key events in the life of Jesus, as related in the Gospels, took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the Acts of the Apostles it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and Mary, the mount has been a site of Christian worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage.\n\nGeography and geology\nThe Mount of Olives is one of three peaks of a mountain ridge which runs for 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) just east of the Old City of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley, in the area called the Valley of Josaphat. The peak to its north is Mount Scopus, at 826 metres (2,710 feet), while the peak to its south is the Mount of Corruption (or the Mount of Offence), at 747 m (2,451 ft). \nThe Mount of Olives itself also consists of three distinct peaks. The middle peak has a double summit: its eastern top contains the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension and an Islamic maqam, while its western top supports the Palestinian town of At-Tur and the Chapel of the Ascension, at 818 m (2,684 ft). The southern head is topped by the Church of the Pater Noster complex. The northern head is known as \"Kurm es Saiad,\" or the Vineyard of the Hunter, and contains the Viri Galilaei Church.\nThe ridge is formed of oceanic sedimentary rock from the Late Cretaceous and contains a soft chalk and a hard flint. While the chalk areas are easily quarried, they are not a suitable strength for construction and features many man-made burial caves. The ridge acts as a watershed, and its eastern side is the beginning of the Judean Desert.\n\nHistory\nFrom Biblical times until the present, Jews have been buried on the Mount of Olives. The necropolis on the southern ridge, the location of the modern village of Silwan, was the burial place of Jerusalem's most important citizens in the period of the Biblical kings.\nThe religious ceremony marking the start of a new month was held on the Mount of Olives during the Second Temple period. During the time of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix (52–60 CE), a Jewish prophetic figure known as \"the Egyptian\" gathered his followers atop the Mount of Olives in preparation for an invasion of the city or in the belief that he would cause the walls of Jerusalem to fall, allowing them to enter (depending on the version). This group was crushed by the Romans. While \"the Egyptian\" managed to flee, many of his followers were killed or taken captive, and the remainder escaped.\nRoman soldiers from the 10th Legion camped on the mount during the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews celebrated the festival of Sukkot on the Mount of Olives. They made pilgrimages to the Mount of Olives because it was 80 meters higher than the Temple Mount and offered a panoramic view of the Temple site. It became a traditional place for lamenting the Temple's destruction, especially on Tisha B'Av. In 1481, an Italian Jewish pilgrim, Meshullam of Volterra, wrote: \"And all the community of Jews, every year, goes up to Mount Zion on the day of Tisha B'Av to fast and mourn, and from there they move down along Yoshafat Valley and up to Mount of Olives. From there they see the whole Temple (the Temple Mount) and there they weep and lament the destruction of this House.\"\nIn 1189, in the wake of the 1187 Battle of Hattin and reconquest of the land by Saladin, the sultan gave the Mount to two of his commanders.\nIn the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the mount.\nPrime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin asked to be buried on the Mount of Olives near the graves of Etzel members Meir Feinstein and Moshe Barazani, rather than Mount Herzl national cemetery.\n\nStatus since 1948\nThe armistice agreement signed by Israel and Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War called for the establishment of a Special Committee to negotiate developments including \"free access to the holy sites and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\". However, during the 19 years the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank lasted, the committee was not formed. Non-Israeli Christian pilgrims were allowed to visit the mount, but Jews of all countries and most non-Jewish Israeli citizens were barred from entering Jordan and therefore were unable to travel to the area.\nBy the end of 1949, and throughout the Jordanian rule of the site, some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks.\n\nState of Israel\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War restoration work was done and the cemetery was reopened for burials. Tombs in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery have been prone to vandalism, among them the tombs of the Gerrer Rebbe and Menachem Begin.\nIsrael's 1980 unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem was condemned as a violation of international law and ruled null and void by the UN Security Council in UNSC Resolution 478.\nOn 6 November 2010, an international watch-committee was set up by Diaspora Jews with the aim of reversing the desecration of the Jewish cemetery. According to one of the founders, the initiative was triggered by witnessing tombstones that were wrecked with \"the kind of maliciousness that defies the imagination.\"\n\nReligious significance\nHebrew Bible references\nDavid and Absalom\nThe Mount of Olives is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Absalom\n(II Samuel 15:30): \"And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up.\" The ascent was probably east of the City of David, near the village of Silwan.\n\nSite of \"the glory of the Lord\"\nThe sacred character of the mount is alluded to in the Book of Ezekiel (11:23): \"And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.\"\n\n\"Mount of Corruption\"\nThe biblical designation \"Mount of Corruption,\" \"Mount of Ruination\" or \"Mount of Offense,\" or in Hebrew Har HaMashchit (הר־המשחית), derives from the idol worship there, begun by King Solomon building altars to the gods of his Moabite and Ammonite wives on the southern peak, \"on the mountain which is before (east of) Jerusalem\" (1 Kings 11:7), just outside the limits of the holy city. This site was known for idol worship throughout the First Temple period, until King Josiah finally destroyed \"the high places that were before Jerusalem, to the right of Har HaMashchit...\"(II Kings 23:13).\n\nApocalypse, resurrection, and burials\nAn apocalyptic prophecy in the Book of Zechariah states that YHWH will stand on the Mount of Olives and the mountain will split in two, with one half shifting north and one half shifting south (Zechariah 14:4). According to the Masoretic Text, people will flee through this newly formed valley to a place called Azal (Zechariah 14:5). The Septuagint (LXX) has a different reading of Zechariah 14:5 stating that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King Uzziah's reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in Antiquities of the Jews that the valley in the area of the King's Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake. Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archeologist in Palestine, theorized that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal. This evidence accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5, which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. The valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies south of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.\nMany Jews have wanted to be buried on the Mount of Olives since antiquity, based on the Jewish tradition (from the Biblical verse Zechariah 14:4) that when the Messiah comes, the resurrection of the dead will begin there. There are an estimated 150,000 graves on the Mount. Notable rabbis buried on the mount include Chaim ibn Attar and others from the 15th century to the present day. Tradition wrongly identifies Roman-period tombs at the foot of the mount as those of Zechariah and Absalom, and a burial complex of the same period on the upper slope as the Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.\n\nNew Testament references\nThe Mount of Olives is frequently mentioned in the New Testament as part of the route from Jerusalem to Bethany and the place where Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin).\nJesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24–25), including the Olivet Discourse, returning after each day to rest (Luke 21:37, and John 8:1 in the additional section of John's Gospel known as the Pericope Adulterae), and also coming there on the night of his betrayal. At the foot of the Mount of Olives lies the Garden of Gethsemane. The New Testament tells how Jesus and his disciples sang together – \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives\" Gospel of Matthew 26:30. Jesus ascended to heaven from the Mount of Olives according to Acts 1:9–12.\n\nGnostic references\nAgain, the story of Jesus with his disciples on the Mount of Olives can be found in the Gnostic text Pistis Sophia, dated around the 3rd to 4th century CE.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks at the top of the Mount of Olives include the Augusta Victoria Hospital with the Lutheran Church of the Ascension and its massive 50-metre (160 ft) bell tower, the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension with its tall and slender bell tower, the Mosque or Chapel of the Ascension, the Church of the Pater Noster, and the Seven Arches Hotel. On the western slope are the historic Jewish cemetery, the Tomb of the Prophets, the Catholic Church of Dominus Flevit, and the Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalene. At the foot of the mount, where it meets the Kidron Valley, there is the Garden of Gethsemane with the Church of All Nations. Within the Kidron Valley itself are the Tomb of the Virgin Mary, the Grotto of Gethsemane, and the nearby tomb of the medieval historian Mujir ed-Din, and further south are the tombs of Absalom (Hebrew name: Yad Avshalom), the Hezir priestly family and of Zechariah. At the northern margin of Mount Olivet stand the Mormon University with the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden and the Jewish settlement of Beit Orot, bordering on the Tzurim Valley and the Mitzpe Hamasu'ot ('Beacons Lookout') site, where the Temple Mount Sifting Project facilities are located. What lays north of here belongs to Mount Scopus. On the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives lies the Palestinian Arab village of al-Eizariya, identified with the ancient village of Bethany mentioned in the New Testament; a short distance from the village centre, towards the top of the mount, is the traditional site of Bethphage, marked by a Franciscan church.\nThe construction of the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies, better known locally as the Mormon University, owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) near the Tzurim Valley which separates the Mount of Olives from Mount Scopus, initially sparked controversy because of concerns that the Mormons would engage in missionary activities. After the Mormons pledged not to proselytize in Israel, work on the building was allowed to proceed.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMount of Olives Jewish Cemetery\nBeit Orot, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nMa'ale ha-Zeitim, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nOlivet (disambiguation)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Mount of Olives at Wikimedia Commons\nMount of Olives website\nHar Hazeitim website\nInteractive Panoramas of the Mount of Olives – jerusalem360.com, GoJerusalem.com\n\"Olives, Mount of\" .

      "content": "## Overview\nThe Old City of Jerusalem (Hebrew: העיר העתיקה, Ha'Ir Ha'Atiqah, Arabic: البلدة القديمة, al-Balda al-Qadimah) is that part of Jerusalem surrounded by the impressive 16th-century Ottoman city walls and representing the heart of the city both historically and spiritually. In a city already divided, the Old City is further divided culturally and historically into four residential Quarters: (clockwise from the southeast) the Jewish, Armenian, Christian, and Muslim Quarters. A fifth area, the Temple Mount/Haram esh-Sharif, contains the Dome of the Rock, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and other Muslim religious sites, and was once the site of the Jewish Temple. The whole Old City is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n## Understand\nThe core of Jerusalem, the Old City, has a history that stretches back more than 3,000 years. The present street plan dates largely from Byzantine times, with the walls and ramparts dating back to the 16th century. The crossroad of three continents, Jerusalem has been one of the most fought over cities in human history. Within the walls, the Old City is divided into four vaguely defined quarters: Christian, Armenian, Jewish and Muslim.\nYou do not need to be Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, or even be overly concerned with religion, to be overwhelmed. With archaeology dating back to the time of the Bible, anyone with a sense of history, spirituality or the human species should be absorbed by the tremendous weight of human civilization that cloaks nearly every part of the city. It is an inhabited, living city - not a deserted museum or monument. Humanity's passion play has been constant revival at this location for most of the length of recorded history.\n\n## Get in\nThe Old City is surrounded by a wall built in the first half of the 16th century by the Ottoman Turk, Suleyman the Magnificent. The 4-km (2.5-mile) circuit is accessed by eight gates, of which seven remain in current use. The gates are, in clockwise order starting in the west:\n\n## By light rail\nThe Jerusalem Municipality usually recommends light rail as the best way to get to the Old City, particularly on holidays when there are many visitors. Each station is about a two-minute walk from the Old City walls.\n31.77944735.2241941 City Hall (העיריה) is the closest station to Jaffa Gate and the New Gate. It should be used for the Christian, Armenian and Jewish Quarters.\n31.78238435.2278332 Damascus Gate (שער שכם) station is the closest to the Damascus Gate. It should be used for the Muslim and Christian quarters.\n\n## By bus\n1: Central Bus Station - Sarei Yisrael - Malchei Yisrael (Geulah) - Meah Shearim - Damascus Gate - Western Wall\n2: Mamilla - Jewish Quarter Parking lot - Western Wall - Mamilla. A \"Touristic\" bus with a circular route that serves the tourist spots in the Old City and nearby it.\n3: Central Bus Station - Kiryat Mattersdorf - Sorotzkin - Kiryat Tzanz - Ezrat Torah - Shmuel HaNavi - Damascus Gate - Western Wall\n38: Jewish Quarter Parking lot - First Station - King George St - Davidka Square - Mamilla - Jewish Quarter Parking lot.\n83: Western Wall - Mount Olives neighbourhood\n218: Ramallah/Al-Bireh - Qalandia - Beit Hanina - (almost) Herod's Gate\n231: Bethlehem/Beit Jala - Talpiot - Jaffa Gate - Damascus Gate\nOther East Jerusalem - buses with blue stripes all terminate near the Damascus Gate; buses with green stripes all terminate 2 minutes walk from Herod's Gate.\n\n## By car\nIf you arrive by car, be aware of the limited parking space. The streets outside the Old City walls are usually reserved for buses and taxicabs; parking of private cars is prohibited.\n31.7766435.226353 Karta parking garage. The simplest parking option. In the Mamilla district next to Jaffa Gate. Entrance to the garage is from Yitshak Kariv street.\n31.7637535.224914 First Station parking lot. Su-Th 08:00-20:00 (on M & Th from 07:00). There is a free shuttle bus service from here to Dung Gate (closest gate to the Western Wall). Shuttle operation has been erratic since the beginning of Covid, but if it's not running you can take the 38 or 83 city bus from the nearby traffic circle to Dung Gate. ₪16.80 for the whole day.\n\n## With a private guide\nThere's no doubt that Jerusalem is overwhelming not to mention scattered. If you only have a day or two to see the city and you'd like to visit many places in a short time, hiring a local private guide that has his own van might be the right thing for you instead of dealing with a rented car & parking for those days. (Note that there is virtually no vehicular access to the Old City, which is most conveniently accessed on foot and is within walking distance of many hotels in the New City.) However, when choosing a guide, try to ask the right questions and advise him/her with a plan that will fit your interest. You'll know the person is a good private tour guide if they will tailor a tour according to your needs.\n\n## Get around\nThe Old City is fairly diminutive in size compared to modern-day Jerusalem. Despite its small size, or perhaps because of it, the Old City is amazing. Much of the Old City is accessible only by walking because of very narrow streets and steps in the road. This is not a great inconvenience because the Old City is only about 1 kilometer across. The Old City is a maze of twisty alleyways and it's difficult to keep your bearings even with a map. Then again, getting lost is half the fun—you can't get too lost due to its size. Thought should be given to footwear, as the roads and paths are uneven stone and thin-soled shoes or spike heels could become uncomfortable.\nNote: The Old City contains many small alleys and tiny streets that often do not appear in guidebooks and street maps. Major roads are almost always signed, so do not simply rely on the map and take the next left/right as it may not be the road you are looking for.\n\n## Jewish Quarter\nAsk if there is a discount or ask for the 'harova' discount. This is for people who are living or staying inside the Old City, but merchants don't know where you are staying or how long you have been here. If you are feeling cautious, say you are staying at the Heritage House. You can ask for the discount in English as there are many Anglophone guests and residents.\nBe careful where you sit. There are dairy and meat only eating areas.\nQuarter Cafe, Tiferet Yisrael St, ☏ +972 2 628 7770.

It is the site of the First and Second Temples from the Jewish and Christian Bible. The site's massive rectangular platform (of which the Western Wall is one wall) was built by Herod the Great. Now the site is a showcase for Islamic architecture and design from the Umayyad to Ottoman times, and is an important religious and educational center for Muslims to the present. Encompassing over 35 acres of fountains, gardens, buildings and domes, it is crowned by the magnificent Dome of the Rock, which stands on the site of the ancient Jewish Temples.\nEntering the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif) for non-Muslims is through an elevated wooden walkway leading to a gate called Mughrabi Gate (Moor's Gate), on the south-eastern corner of the Western Wall Plaza in the Jewish Quarter. The entry to the Temple Mount itself (not the mosques) is allowed to non-Muslims only at certain hours and is free of charge (see the caution note above).\nSome rabbis consider it forbidden or at the very least religiously unadvisable to enter the Temple Mount as the Holy of Holies is/was somewhere on the Mount. While the Temple stood, this area was off-limits to anybody not a priest of the Temple (and even they could only enter it at certain periods). As the protection of the Holy of Holies was – according to that view – never revoked, one could accidentally blaspheme by standing in the wrong place. However, there are also Jews who disagree with that view or who claim to know where the Holy of Holies is/was or who do not care about the religious implications. Nevertheless, it is better to know and make an informed choice.\nIt is hard to see the majestic buildings on the Temple Mount from the rest of the Old City (unless you know a local inhabitant who lets you onto their roof). An alternative is to look across from the Mount of Olives.\nThe sights of the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif) which are permitted only to Muslims:\n31.77805635.23527838 Dome of the Rock. (Arabic: Qubbat Al-Sakhra, Hebrew: Kippat HaSela), located in the middle of the sanctuary opposite of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, is probably the most dazzling and well-known landmark of Jerusalem, with its golden dome and octagonal blue walls adorned with calligraphy of Quranic verses. The Dome was built between 687-691 by the ninth Omayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, atop the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple. The Dome is probably the most spectacular building in the Old City, thanks to a renovation in which dazzling gold donated by the King of Jordan in 1993 was layered over the bronze. Despite common conceptions, the Dome is not a mosque, but a shrine which protects beneath its high ceiling a large piece of rock sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. The rock is variously believed to be the \"Foundation Stone\" from which the world was created, where Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son (Isaac or Ishmael, depending on the tradition), where Mohammad left the Earth on his Night Journey (a small indentation was reportedly left by his foot), and the site of Solomon and Herod's Temples.\n31.77638935.23555639 al-Aqsa Mosque. The point from where Mohammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. This association has made the building the third-holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina. Construction of the mosque began less than 20 years after the completion of the Dome of the Rock. Al-Aqsa has undergone many changes since its original construction. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in the 11th century, al-Aqsa became the headquarters of the Templars. The mosque's design pales in comparison to the Dome of the Rock and is permanently off-limits to non-Muslim visitors.\n31.7758435.2347840 Museum of Islamic Art (Southwest corner of the Temple Mount). Housed in the Crusader-era refectory of the Knights Templar, this filled museum contains wonderful Islamic architectural remnants. An admission is required, but it is recommended that guests interested in Islamic art visit the LA Mayer Museum in the new city.\n31.77638935.23694441 Solomon's Stables (El-Marwani Mosque) (Southeast corner of Temple Mount).\n31.77888935.23694442 Golden Gate Interior. on the east wall of the Temple Mount/Haram esh-Sharif. According to Jewish tradition the Messiah will arrive in the Temple via this gate, and according to Christian tradition Jesus entered through this gate on Palm Sunday. Closed by the Muslims in 810, reopened in 1102 by the Crusaders, it was walled up by Saladin after regaining Jerusalem in 1187. Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt it together with the city walls, but walled it up in 1541, and it stayed that way until today.\n\n## Do\n31.7766935.227661 Ramparts Walk. Visitors can walk along two sections of the Old City wall, from Jaffa Gate clockwise to St Stephen's Gate, and counter-clockwise from Jaffa Gate to the Dung Gate. The northern route starts from inside the old city by the Jaffa gate and circles the Christian quarter and the Muslim quarter. The southern route starts from outside the Jaffa gate and circles the Armenian quarter and the Jewish quarter. Access to the ramparts is only possible at Jaffa and Damascus gates, although walkers can descend at any gate. Hours are 09:00–16:00 (14:00 on Fridays) daily. Wear shoes suitable for hiking, as the ramparts are quite bumpy. ₪16 adults, ₪8 students & children.\n\n## Buy\n31.7767235.228781 David street (Starts in the square outside the Tower of David, near Jaffa Gate). The most interesting market for tourists, full of Middle Eastern goods as well as souvenirs appealing to members of various religions.\n31.7751835.230972 Cardo. The most prestigious shopping precinct in the Jewish Quarter. Built on the excavated remains of late Roman era Jerusalem (many of which can still be seen), the shops here specialise in arts and crafts, jewelry, Judaica, Dead Sea beauty products, quality souvenirs and T-shirts, among other things. But souvenirs here tend to be significantly more pricey than elsewhere in the Old City.\nSouk Khan al-Zeit and El-Wad streets are the main arteries of the Muslim Quarter. Souk Khan al-Zeit begins just east of the Muristan while El-Wad begins at the outlet of the tunnel to the Western Wall Plaza, with both leading north towards the Damascus gate. While these streets contain numerous souvenir shops and cafes catering to tourists, the majority of shops serve the local population. Butchers, Western clothing stores, hardware shops, and groceries can be found throughout the area.\nThe Suq El Attaria is the primary shopping area in the Arab quarters of the Old City. You will find shops ranging from souvenirs to greengrocers to traditional clothing.\nThe lanes and alleys in and near the Christian quarter abound in shops displaying icons and other churchy items. The quality ranges from kitsch to alright - and prices are mostly grossly inflated. Credit card scams are not unknown. Shop proprietors are seasoned masters at gentle but effective commercial manipulation - inviting bypassing tourists into their shops, involving them in innocuous conversation and directing them into 'you must buy this' situations.\nThe Old City of Jerusalem is known for its Armenian ceramics. With white and a rich blue as the base colors, and bright paintings on them, they are a distinct souvenir. The street signs throughout the old quarter are made of Armenian ceramics, and a few shops will produce custom nameplates and tile signs with a short turnaround time. Ceramics from Hebron are also popular with tourists.\nPrices for snacks, water, and other drinks are inflated in the Jewish Quarter and near the Jaffa gate and the Muristan. As you move closer to Damascus Gate you can find 1.5-liter bottles of water for ₪5, while a 0.5-liter bottle may cost you as much as ₪9 in the more touristy areas.\n\n## Eat\nThe Old City tempts the taste buds with Arabic, Jewish, Mediterranean and International fare. Visitors on the go can grab food from street vendors, while those desiring a more formal meal can find numerous restaurants scattered throughout each quarter.\nCommon appetizers and quick treats may include Kibbe, an oval-shaped croquette of cracked wheat filled with meat and onions; Hummos, a chickpea paste with olive oil; Tabuleh, finely-chopped parsley with tomato and cucumber; and Tahini, a sesame seed paste with parsley, oil and garlic.\nMain dishes usually consist of lamb or chicken meat with occasional beef, but never pork. Meats can be cooked in a variety of ways, but is most often cooked on a spit. Take-away restaurants offer favorites like falafel (deep-fried balls of mashed chickpeas) and shwarma (lamb grilled on a spit and eaten in flat bread).\nDessert options range from exotic or citrus fruits to sticky, sweet Middle Eastern confections. Baklava is a layered pastry filled with powdered pistachio and covered in honey or syrup. Kanafeh, a recipe that differs throughout the Middle East, is served in Jerusalem as pistachios in a crisp coating of pastry threads.\nAn issue that may be confusing to many travelers is the issue of Jewish dietary laws, or Kashrut. These laws state that certain meat is considered impure (anything that does not chew the cud and have a split hoof, including pork and rabbit), as well as certain types of seafood (anything without scales or fins). Animals that are permitted for consumption have been slaughtered according to Jewish religious practices and cleansed of all traces of blood before cooking, allowing the food to be declared kosher. Other complications revolve around the fact that meat and dairy products can never be eaten together in the same meal. In Jerusalem you will find that all types of restaurants can be kosher, not just Jewish ones.\n\n## Drink\nCoffee and tea are the two most common drinks among Jews and Arabs, although each has a preferred way of making it. In Jewish areas, coffee and tea are drunk in European or American-style cafés. Espresso is offered, but is weak compared to katzar, a stronger coffee. In Arab areas, coffee (qahweh) is served thick and strong and is meant to be consumed in small sips. If Western-style coffee is preferred, ask for Nescafé or filtered coffee. Tea (shay) is stronger than Western-style tea and is drunk with lots of sugar. If Western-style tea is preferred, ask for shay Libton (Lipton tea).\nFresh pomegranate (and grapefruit) juice is available all over the Old City. Prices start from around ₪10 (October 2018) for a 0.3 liter cup, any price beyond ₪15 (October 2018) for 0.3 liters (not 0.2) is a rip-off. The price in Hebron, by contrast, is ₪2.\nBottled water is inexpensive (usually, be careful where you buy) and readily available throughout the Old City. Carrying an extra bottle of water is recommended due to the dry, dusty climate.\nSome restaurants serve alcohol. The main beers are Israeli Maccabee/Goldstar and Arab Taybeh beer. Spirits are less widely available but are commonly sold in hotel bars.\n\n## Sleep\nAccommodation within the Old City itself is distinctly downmarket. Be sure to investigate people renting out private residences.\n\n## Budget\nFor those on a tight budget, youth hostels are ideal (although occasionally somewhat dodgy), and often the cheapest places to stay in Jerusalem. Religiously-based hospices and guest houses, located mainly near the holy sites, is a popular and inexpensive alternative to hotels. Hospices and guest houses tend to maintain stricter rules than hostels.\n31.77726235.2342231 Chain Gate Hostel, ☏ +972 54-436-8053.
