Lors de l'impact, de la matière jusqu'à 3 km de profondeur aurait été propulsée dans les airs. La structure tout entière est elle bien plus large et atteindrait 140 km de diamètre. Cinq à sept anneaux concentriques — forme rare sur Europe — sont visibles et pourraient indiquer qu'un matériaux fluide comme de l'eau liquide se serait trouvé sous la surface au moment de l'impact. Par ailleurs, différents cratères de faible diamètre entourant Tyre auraient été formés par la chute des matériaux déplacés par cet impact.\n\nNomenclature\nIl n'est officiellement pas classé comme un cratère mais comme une Large ringed feature. De plus, il possède la nomenclature normalement associée aux maculae (faisant référence à un lieu associé aux mythes d'Europe et de son frère Cadmos) car la structure était auparavant considérée comme une macula avant son reclassement.\nLa structure est nommée d'après Tyr, l'endroit où Zeus a enlevé Europe.\n\nRéférences\nArticles connexes\nListe des formations géologiques d'Europe\nEurope (lune)\n Portail de la planète Jupiter",

      "content": "## Overview\nTyre (Arabic: Sour صُوْر) is the fourth-largest city in Lebanon. It is particularly noteworthy for its stunning and clean beaches (unlike those at Sidon) as well as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture in the world. Situated on a peninsula, it is the largest city in the south of the country after Sidon.\nTyre is the base of the UNIFIL headquarters which operates in the south of the country, and monitors the border region between Lebanon, Israel and the occupied territories and Syria. Don't be surprised to see UN troops out and about in this town, which is generally very safe for visitors.\n\n## By bus\nThe cheapest way of getting into Tyre is by private bus. Large, air-conditioned buses go from Cola Junction, Beirut, throughout the day for approximately US$4 and take about 2½ hr.\n\n## By minibus\nPrivately run minibuses also go frequently throughout the day and late into the evening from Cola Junction, Beirut and from the bus station in Sidon. They take a variety of routes and will often stop and start throughout the journey to let passengers on and off.\nMinibuses that go via the coastal roads are much slower (Beirut to Tyre can take 3-4 hr), but some minibuses will take the motorway route (2½ hr from Beirut, about 1hr from Sidon). Prices are usually 2–3,000 Lebanese lira from Beirut.\nDo check when you get on board how much the price is as tourists will often be charged more than locals. If you're not sure how much the fare should be, try speaking to someone on the bus - many people speak English and you will very likely find someone to help you out.\n\n## By private taxi\nThere are two ways to get to Tyre via taxi - the first is a simple private hire (US$80-90 from Beirut, per car), or the  'service'  option where you can share with other people who are travelling in a similar direction (US$10 would be reasonable from Beirut to Tyre). The journey will take approximately 2½ hr from Beirut, depending on any stops that have to be made.\n\n## Checkpoint information\nA number of military checkpoints operate on the roads between Beirut, Sidon and Tyre. There are also occasionally other checkpoints which are run by Hezbollah soldiers. If you bus or taxi is asked to stop, make sure you have your passport to hand, and take off any sunglasses or hats to ensure proper identification. Generally you will be waved through without any further problems. Do not be alarmed if you are asked why you are travelling.\n\n## Get around\nWithout a doubt the best way to get around Tyre is on foot. The beachfront and main roads are all within 5-10 min walk from each other. The Al Bass Archaeological site is slightly further away and a taxi may be the easiest option to get there.\nTaxis are pretty cheap and some are even comfortable to travel in. Some are the registered yellow taxis that operate throughout the country, but many are private cars, often in varying states of repair (from virtually new to over 40 years old in some cases). A rough rule of thumb is that a short ride in a 'service' - or shared taxi - will cost approximately 2,000LL, with longer journeys costing up to 5,000LL. Always check the price before entering the taxi, and check whether it is a taxi (and therefore private and more expensive) or a service (which will stop to pick up other passengers on the way, and is much cheaper).\nTraffic is typical Lebanese: if you want to go, you must go regardless of the 'western' way of thinking in the traffic. This means that drivers frequently won't give way unless they absolutely have to, and lanes and road signage are frequently ignored. Of course, do ask your driver to slow down if you don't feel safe.\n\n## See\nAlthough frequently eclipsed by the grandeur of Beirut and the bustling souq of Sidon, Tyre is a beautiful and enjoyable city in its own right. However its small size and distinctive position in the deep south of the country mean that most tourists never get this far. The city's main draw is the astonishing ruins of old Tyre, including the world's best-preserved Roman Hippodrome, have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1984. Enjoying the beautiful beaches and excellent local cuisine is also a favorite pastime for both locals and visitors.\n33.26986335.2139661 Al-Bass Tyre necropolis. The impressive site is huge and also encapsulates a large Necropolis (with several hundred well-preserved sarcophagi), an intact Roman road and aqueduct, and a monumental arch. Situated next to the Al Bass Palestinian Refugee Camp, it is a 10-min car ride from the beach.      (updated Jul 2020)\n33.26908935.2097042 Tyre Hippodrome. By far the most famous attraction, boasting the largest and best-preserved example of a Roman Hippodrome.     (updated Jul 2020)\nHot Spring Ruins. Situated in the Christian district, is another impressive feat of Roman architecture which escaped destruction during recent Israeli bombing campaigns. (updated Jul 2020)\n33.27633935.1933233 Tyre lighthouse. Situated on the north-western tip of the peninsula is a beautiful and quiet spot, perfect for watching the sun go down.    (updated Jul 2020)\nAl Gamal. This is a rocky beach at the southwestern tip of the peninsula where the ruins of an old Phoenician port can be seen. There is a number of hut restaurants on the rocks where you can enjoy the sun and food. Swimming is delightful in the clear water and there is a spot that seems like an ancient swimming pool carved in rock, 1 m deep and some 30 x 20 m in size. (updated Jul 2020)\n\n## Do\nThe souq situated next to the Christian district, is a lively and atmospheric marketplace. Although it does not have the splendour of the large and tourist-driven souq in Sidon, it offers good prices on everything from souvenirs to fresh fish caught that morning.\nThe beach is known throughout Lebanon as being the cleanest and most beautiful in Lebanon, with families from around the country flocking there in the summer. During the summer months (May–September) there are a large number of beach cafes which operate from the huts. Prices can be expensive, but it is a perfect spot for sunbathing and enjoying the impressive waves. During the summer, the sea is warm enough to swim in at night, making it a special place. Moreover, you can rent a fishing boat (FLOkA) and take a tour around the seaside of Tyre or you can navigate to the rocky islands (ZEERRE) where you can find amazing spots for diving. Also renting a jetski can be fun, you can find dealers everywhere around the see.\nThe Christian district at the Western tip of the peninsula is a higgledy-piggledy area with thin roads and lovely hidden shops. It's worth spending some time walking around this nice little enclave, though do remember that these are peoples' homes and that you shouldn't enter any open doors unless invited.\n\n## Eat\nLe Phenicien: fish and seafood, excellent cuisine, beer, wine liquors\nSkandars: Lebanese and international cuisine, beer, wine liquors\nAl Nabeel's Cake Shop: famous Lebanese speciality cake shop, wonderful and kind staff and some of the most amazing cakes you will ever eat\nThe Resthouse: Lebanese and international cuisine, beer, wine liquors\nAl Fanar: Lebanese and international cuisine, beer, wine liquors\nTyros: Fish, Lebanese and international cuisine, beer, wine liquors\nBaquettos: Fast food\nRest Cafe, port area, al mina (beside caritas), ☏ +961 70177725. 16.

The beach and the pool is exclusively only to the hotel's guests although others can use them too by paying a small fee - this fee is mostly to keep 'unwanted people' off the premises. At the beach you can order drinks, narghile, rent a sun chair or perhaps attend a diving course.\n33.26334235.2071181 Rest House Tyr Hotel & Resort, ☏ +961 7 742 000. From US$120 per night.    (updated Aug 2017)\n33.27584135.1933092 Al Fanar Resort, ☏ +961 7 741 111. A good place to stay in. US$50-60 per night.    (updated Aug 2017)\n33.27161735.2029373 Artizan Hotel, Rue Senegal.

(updated Aug 2017)\n\n## Go next\nThe main pickup point for minibuses to Sidon and Beirut is the bustling Al Bass roundabout, just outside the Al Bass Palestinian Refugee Camp. A number of touts operate in this area and will try to get you on their minibus before you go on another. Be assertive with them - ask their destination and the price in advance. Keep a hold of your luggage - a common trick is for them to grab your luggage and stow it on the minibus before you get a chance to complain. However, don't worry too much - the negotiation is all part of the fun.",
