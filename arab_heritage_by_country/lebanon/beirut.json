      "content": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Beirut was severely damaged by the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2020 massive explosion in the Port of Beirut, and was subsequently rebuilt after each of these events. Its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayrūt (بيروت). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French mandate. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician bēʾrūt (𐤁𐤀‏𐤓𐤕‎ bʾrt). This was a modification of the Phoenician word bīʾrōt later bēʾrūt, meaning \"wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The name is first attested in the 14th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.\nThe Greeks hellenised the name as Bērytós (Ancient Greek: Βηρυτός), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nAt the time of the crusades, the city was known in French as Barut or Baruth.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Persian and Ottoman remains.\n\nPrehistory\nBeirut was settled over 5,000 years ago, and there is evidence that the surrounding area had already been inhabited for tens of thousands of years prior to this. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools from sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Français in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.\nBeirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.\nBeirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticized by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area.\nBeirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.\nBeirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.\nBeirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland, Peter Wescombe, and Marina Hayek in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\nPhoenician period\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in Marburg, Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\nHellenistic period\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon during his conflict with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.\nMid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\nRoman period\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. Under Claudius, Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include Heliopolis (Baalbek). The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region.\nAs a result of this settlement, the city quickly became Romanized, and the city became the only mainly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia province. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony, one of four in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation. Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions.\nBerytus's law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, were natives of Phoenicia and taught there under the Severan emperors. Ecclesiastical historian Sozomen studied at the law school in Beirut between 400 and 402. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire.\nIn 551, a major earthquake struck Berytus, causing widespread damage. The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many, 30,000 in Berytus alone by some measurements. As a result, the students of the law school were transferred to Sidon.\nSalvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\nMiddle Ages\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. As a trading center of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was as important as Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197. John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204. He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\nIn 1291 Beirut was captured and the Crusaders expelled by the Mamluk army of Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil.\n\nOttoman rule\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading center in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks. After Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\nAfter the Albanian fighter Tafil Buzi was interned and then pardoned by the Ottoman administration for his constant uprisings, he raised 3,000 Albanian mercenaries to fight in Lebanon; some of them became notorious shortly afterwards for having been responsible for the widespread disorders in Beirut.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial center. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realization amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\nVilayet of Beirut\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. Though French infrastructure investments in the region were supportive, the local merchant elites were able to independently maintain economic power even after the end of the First World War. In contrast, although Beirut was not the only city to receive French attention in this time, it was able to leverage its critical position to its advantage over others (e.g. Damascus). The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\n\nModern era\nCapital of Lebanon\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nBeirut International Airport was opened on 23 April 1954. It was renamed Rafic Hariri International Airport in 2005 following his assassination. Beirut serves its sole commercial airport as Lebanon's main gateway for flights.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975–1976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\n\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.\nBetween 1989 and 1990 parts on East Beirut were destroyed in fighting between Lebanese army units loyal to General Aoun and Samir Geagea's Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces with the Syrian Armed Forces-backed Elias Hrawi and Salim Al-Huss Lebanese army forces.\nSince the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a center for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup, and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant nine times: 1960–1964, 1999, 2001–2002, and 2016.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.\nIn May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighborhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.\nIn the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nOn 4 August 2020, a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut resulted in the death of at least 203 people (with an additional three missing) and the wounding of more than 6,500. Foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. Furthermore, at least 108 Bangladeshis were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. The cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion. Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on 8 August 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 August explosion. On 10 August 2020, as a result of the protests, Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his resignation. Weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port's duty-free zone, on 10 September 2020.\n\nGeography\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\nClimate\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, bordering on As, Trewartha: Csal) characterized by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy; frost has never been recorded. Summer is prolonged, hot and humid. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.\n\nQuarters and sectors\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\n\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikhaël)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRmeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-Blat\nThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs).\n\nBadaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighborhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favorite hip nightlife destination.\nTwo of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias.\n\nSouthern suburban districts include Chiyah, Ghobeiry (Bir Hassan, Jnah and Ouzai are part of the Ghobeiry municipality), Haret Hreik, Burj al Barajneh, Laylake-Mreijeh, Hay al Sillum and Hadath. Eastern suburbs include Burj Hammoud, Sin el Fil, Dekwane and Mkalles. Hazmiyeh is also considered as an eastern suburb with its close proximity to the capital. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war.\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more commonly used.\n\nDemographics\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\nReligion\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. Before the civil war the neighborhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict. East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, whilst West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. Christians comprise 35% of Beirut's population, Muslims 63%, Druze 1%, and others 1%.\n\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\n\nLanguages\nLebanon does not hold a census survey; researchers at the American University of Beirut have found that trilingualism - between Lebanese Arabic, French and English - is common and normal among Beirut residents. The use of all three languages crosses between the city's different sects and geography, and are a common occurrence in both the more cosmopolitan and the more conservative neighborhoods. The research found that French or English is disproportionately heard nearby Francophone or Anglophone, respectively, educational institutions. Some minorities in Beirut also speak Armenian, Aramaic, and Amharic.\n\nBeirut Central District\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country\". It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city center from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organizations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city center.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centers. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organizes music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, Fête de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality, thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticized for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.\nThe actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the businesses located there have mostly moved.\n\nEconomy\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nBeirut became a banking hub by leveraging its position as a commercial port and cultural center within the world economy. Under French mandate after World War I, France heavily invested in the city, reinforcing its role as a regional financial center. The Open Door Policy facilitated foreign capital inflows, with French firms dominating investments and four of Beirut's five leading banks being French-owned by the 1920s, after which the city further solidified its status as a key financial link between the West and the decolonizing Middle East.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one, as the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) and subsequent conflicts significantly altered the political landscape. With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favorable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking center for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban  (Lebanon's central bank), the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\nBanking and finance\nThe banking system is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.\nBeirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.\nThe Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East\",  and also \"Switzerland of the Middle East\", often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).\nThe largely pedestrianized Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouché, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighborhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area. There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.\nHamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighboring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops. However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked the 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totaling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Condé Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.\nMany of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.\nLike other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialized procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\nGovernment\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\nInternational organizations\nThe city is home to numerous international organizations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers' Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges and  the World youth alliance are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\nEducation\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes. The Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing universities, colleges, and institutes in Beirut and nationwide.\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) and Université Saint-Joseph (USJ) are the oldest English-language and French-language universities in the country, respectively. AUB was founded in 1866, and USJ in 1875. The Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to Lebanese American University (LAU), American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, École Supérieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), Notre Dame University – Louaize (NDU), and Université La Sagesse (ULS).\nAmong the private secondary schools in Beirut are Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais, Lycée Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Collège Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Collège Notre Dame de Nazareth, Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé, Collège Protestant Français, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\nTransportation\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.\nBeirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC – \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.\nThe ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.\nBeirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\nIn 2024, Ahdab Commuting and Trading Company (ACTC), alongside the Ministry of Transport, reintroduced a proper public bus system with an appropriate network of lanes using the 50 buses donated by France in 2022. \nThe network connects most areas of Beirut through 7 major lines (B1-7), as well as connecting Beirut to other major cities like Tripoli and Saida through 4 lines (ML1-4). These lines however do not replace the existing service microbuses, they complement them.\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilizations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading center of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year, it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.\nBeirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\nMuseums\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third-oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighboring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.\nPlanet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.\nIn October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a Pterodactyl, is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish'n'Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerges you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\nTourism\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey. Beirut came in first place regionally and 10th place internationally in a 2010 study by \"EuroCost International\" about the rental markets for high quality housing.

      "summary": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

      "content": "بَيْرُوت هي العاصمة السياسية للجمهورية اللبنانية وأكبر مدنها. يتعدى عدد سكانها المليوني نسمة بحسب أحد إحصائيات سنة 2007. تقع وسط الخط الساحلي اللبناني شرقي البحر الأبيض المتوسط. تتركَز فيها معظم المرافق الحيوية من صناعة وتجارة وخدمات. وهي مدينة قديمة وعريقة إذ ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنة والمؤرخة إلى القرن الخامس عشر ما قبل الميلاد وهي مأهولة منذ ذلك الحين.\nبيروت هي مركز الثقل السياسي اللبناني حيث مقر معظم الدوائر السياسية مثل البرلمان ورئاسة الحكومة بالإضافة لمراكز معظم الوزارات والدوائر الحكومية. تلعب الدور الرئيسي في الحركة الاقتصادية اللبنانية. وتعد المدينة إحدى أهم المؤثرات الثقافية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط والوطن العربي لغناها بالأنشطة الثقافية مثل الصحافة الحرة والمسارح ودور النشر ومعارض الفنون والمتاحف وعدد كبير من الجامعات الدولية.\nمرت المدينة بالعديد من الكوارث من زلازل وحروب على مر التاريخ كان أهمها الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية المدمرة. وبعد انتهاء الحرب سنة 1990، أعادت الدولة في عهد حكومة رئيس وزراء لبنان آنذاك رفيق الحريري إعمار وتأهيل المدينة وبخاصة وسطها التجاري وواجهتها البحرية وملاهيها الليلية مما أعاد تألق سياحتها وجعلها مقصداً سياحياً جذاباً. قامت صحيفة النيويورك تايمز بمنح بيروت المركز الأول بين قائمة الأماكن التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنة 2009، كما صُنّفت ضمن المدن العشرة الأوائل الأكثر حيوية في عام 2009 بواسطة دليل لونلي بلانت السياحي. وفي عام 2020، مرّت بيروت بكارثة أُخرى حيث حصلَ انفجار ضخم في مرفأ المدينة مما خلف عشرات القتلى وآلاف الجرحى وتسبب بدمار كبير في عدد من أحيائها نتج عنه نزوح 300 ألف مواطن لبناني.\nكشف مؤشر «ماستر كارد» لعام 2011، أن بيروت استأثرت بالمركز الثاني من حيث نسبة البذخ السياحي بين جميع مدن الشرق الأوسط وأفريقيا. أما المركز الأول فاحتلته دبي، التي بلغ مقدار ما صرفه فيها السوّاح حوالي 7.8 مليار دولار، تليها بيروت مباشرة بحوالي 6.5 مليارات دولار، ثم تل أبيب بحوالي 3.8 مليارات، ثم القاهرة (3.7 مليارات دولار)، فجوهانسبرغ (3.3 مليارات دولار). كذلك وُضعت بيروت في المرتبة التاسعة بين قائمة أكثر المدن زيارةً في العالم.\n\nالتسمية\nأقدم ذكر عبر الوثائق التاريخية لاسم بيروت ورد بلفظ «بيروتا» في ألواح تل العمارنة التي وجدت في مصر، والتي تحوي مراسلات تمت بين ملوك جبيل والفرعون امينوفيس الرابع المعروف بأخناتون (مطلع القرن الرابع عشر ق.م.) ورد فيها اسم «بيروتا» وملكها «عمونيرا». سماها الفنيقيون «بيريت» ँ‌ऀ‌ओ‌क وهي كلمة فينيقية تعني الآبار. وقيل أنها كانت تدعى\n«بيريتيس» أو «بيروتوس» أو «بيرُووَه» نسبة للإلهة «بيروت»، أعز آلهة لبنان وصاحبة أدونيس إله جبيل. وعُرفت المدينة باسم «بيريتوس» (باليونانية القديمة:βηρυτός) في الأدبيات الإغريقية. واعتمد هذا الاسم في دوريات الآثار المنشورة في الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت منذ 1934.\nوذكر أن «بيروت» بالمعنى السامي تعني «الصنوبر» لغابات الصنوبر، بسبب وقوعها بالقرب من غابة صنوبر كبيرة هي اليوم ما يُعرف بحرش أو حرج بيروت. ومن الأسماء الأخرى التي دعيت بها منطقة بيروت هو: «لاذقية كنعان»، «مستوطنة جوليا أغسطس بيريتوس السعيدة»، «دربي»، «رديدون»، «باروت». ولقبت المدينة عبر العصور بالعديد من الألقاب منها: سماها الفينيقيون «بالمدينة الإلهة» و«بيروت الأبيّة والمجيدة» لعنادها في مقارعة مدينة «صيدون» و«زهرة الشرق»، وأطلق عليها الرومان «أم الشرائع» بسبب بناء أكبر معهد للقانون بالإمبراطورية فيها. ونعتها العثمانيون «بالدرة الغالية». في العصر الحديث خلدها نزار قباني بلقب «ست الدنيا». وعرفت أيضا باسم «باريس الشرق» خلال فترة الستينات وأوائل السبعينات من القرن العشرين، أي خلال عهد الازدهار الاقتصادي في لبنان.\n\nتاريخ بيروت\nيعود تاريخ بيروت إلى أكثر من 5000 عام. تدل أعمال الحفريات الأثرية في وسط بيروت على تنوع الحضارات التي مرت على المدينة، فقد عُثر على طبقات متعددة من الآثار الفينيقية والهيلينية والرومانية والعربية والعثمانية التي تبعد عن بعضها بمسافة ضئيلة.\n\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nاكتشف الباحثون وعلماء الآثار عدّة مواقع أثرية تقع ضمن حدود المناطق التي تُشكّل مدينة بيروت المعاصرة، وكان معظم هذه المواقع يحتوي على أدوات صوّانية تعود لعهود متعاقبة تبدأ من العصرين الحجريين: القديم الوسيط والقديم العلوي، مرورًا بالعصر الحجري الحديث ووصولاً إلى العصر البرونزي. أما أبرز هذه المواقع فهي:\n\nموقع ميناء الحصن: وصفه الباحثون بأنه «قرية بيروتيّة»، ويُرجّح أن موقع الأصلي كان على شاطئ البحر بالقرب من فندقيّ الشرق وبسول، في الجادّة الفرنسية المعروفة محليًا باسم «شارع الفرنساوية». اكتُشف الموقع في سنة 1894، ودُرس لأول مرة على يد أحد الآباء اليسوعيين في سنة 1900. وُصفت الأدوات الصوانية التي عُثر عليها في الموقع بأنها موستيرية، وقد احتفظ بها متحف الفنون الجميلة في ليون.\nموقع أم الخطيب: يقع شمال منطقة الطريق الجديدة الحالية، وعُثر فيه على أدوات صوّانية ترجع للعصر النحاسي. تدمّر هذا الموقع بعد أن شُيدت عليه مبان في سنة 1948.\nموقع فرن الشبّاك: يقع على الضفة اليسرى من نهر بيروت، حيث تنتهي حدود المدينة. كانت المنطقة مغطاة سابقًا بالرمال الحمراء التي شكّلت مصاطبًا للنهر ترجع للعصر الرباعي. عثرت مجموعة من الآباء اليسوعيين على هذا الموقع، واكتشفوا فيه عدد كبير من الأدوات الصوّانية التي تعود للعصر الحجري القديم الوسيط، وقد كان معظمها مغروسًا في الرمال على ضفة النهر. شملت المكتشفات حوالي 50 أداة قطع تعود للفترة الأشولينية، يحتفظ بها اليوم المتحف اللبناني للآثار القبتاريخية.\nموقع نهر بيروت: قيل بأنه وقع في بستان لأشجار التوت على الضفة اليسرى للنهر بالقرب من خط سكة الحديد المتوجهة إلى طرابلس. اكتشف في هذا الموقع عدّة بقايا لرماح وحجارة صوّانية مسننة وعظام مدفونة وسط الطمي. وقد شُيّدت عليه مبان في الوقت الحالي.\nكما عُثر في مواقع أخرى، أهمها موقعا البطركيّة والبرج، على بقايا فؤوس قديمة، وعلى قبور تعود لأواسط العصر البرونزي، في المنطقة الأخيرة، مما دفع الباحثين للقول أن «تل» بيروت القديم، أو المستعمرة البشرية الرئيسيّة، كانت تقوم في ذاك المكان.\n\nالعصور القديمة\nبُنيت بيروت من قبل أهل جبيل (بيبلوس) قبل أربعة آلاف سنة، وما لبثت أن كبرت وعمرت بالسكان وأصبحت مملكة مستقلة على الساحل الذي كان يُعرف باسم فينيقيا وعبد أهلها إلها خاصاً بها اسمه «بعل بيريت» أي إله أو سيّد بيروت، وضربت باسمها عملة نقديّة تحمل رسماً يمثل هذا الإله. وأول إشارة لمدينة بيروت تعود للقرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد حيث ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنة المسمارية التي ذكرت عن «عمونيرا» ملك «بيريت». الذي أرسل ثلاث رسائل إلى الفرعون المصري. كما ذكرت «بيريت» في رسائل «رب حدا» ملك جبيل. وأنشئت أول مستوطناتها على جزيرة وسط نهرها التي طُمرت عبر الأزمان.\nخضعت بيروت لحكم المصريين بعد أن قام الفرعون تحتموس الثالث باحتلال الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط أثناء طرده للهكسوس من مصر، وبعد المصريين قام كل من الآشوريين والكلدانيين والفرس بالسيطرة على فينيقيا ومنها بيروت، قبل أن يهزم الإسكندر الأكبر الفرس ويضم المدينة لإمبراطوريته. وفي سنة 140ق.م احتلها ودمرها «ديودوتوس تريفون»، الملك الهيليني، خلال صراعه مع «أنيوخس السابع» للسيطرة على عرش الدولة السلوقية. ومن ثم أعيد بناؤها على الطراز الهيليني وسميت «لاوديسيا الفينيقية» (باليونانية: Λαοδικεια ή του Φοινίκη) وفي بعض الأحيان «لاوديسيا الكنعانية». تقع المدينة اليوم على أنقاض تلك التي بناها اليونان، كما أظهرت الحفريات التي أعيد العمل بها بعد انتهاء الحرب الأهلية سنة 1991. وتشير إحدى الحفريات من سنة 1994 إلى أن شارع «سوق الطويلة» الحديث هو تطور لشارع هيليني أو روماني قديم.\n\nواحتل بيروت الجنرال الروماني ماركوس أغريبا في عام 64 ق.م. وسماها «مستوطنة جوليا أغسطس بيريتوس السعيدة» (باللاتينية: Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus) تيمنا بجوليا بنت الإمبراطور أغسطس ونظرا لأهمية المدينة تمركز فيها الفيلقان الرومانيان: المقدوني الخامس، والغالي الثالث مما حولها إلى جزء من الإمبراطورية الرومانية وبالتالي تمّ تعميرها وفقا للنمط المعماري الروماني، فبُنيت فيها الأبنية، من هياكل ومسارح وحمامات، ومؤسسات حكوميّة فخمة.\nعرفت المدينة أزهى أيامها خلال عهد هيرودوس فأصبحت مدينة رومانية كاملة الحقوق في سنة 14 ق.م، ومنحت لقب المستمعرة الممتازة. اشتهرت بيروت تحت الحكم الروماني بمدرسة القانون والتي استمرت بتدريس الحقوق لأكثر من 300 عام، وكانت في ذلك العهد مرجعاً لطلاب العلم من الوطنيين والأجانب. وهي المدرسة التي أكسبت المدينة في ذلك الحين للقب «أم الشرائع ومرضعة العلوم». من أشهر مدرسيها الحقوقيين الفينيقيين «بابينيانوس» و«أولبيانوس»، الذين اشتهرا خلال حكم الأباطرة السيفريين، والذي كان عملهما أساس قانون جستنيان الأول المعروف «بالبندكتس». دُمرت المدرسة نتيجةً لموجة الزلازل التي ضربت بيروت في سنة551 للميلاد، فنقل طلابها إلى مدينة صيدون. وقتل الزلزال 30,000 بيروتي و250,000 من سكان الساحل الفينيقي، الأمر الذي أفقد بيروت أهميتها خلال السنين المتبقية لها تحت حكم الروم البيزنطينين.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nبعد حوالي مائة سنة من دمار المدينة، أي خلال سنة 635م، فتحها العرب بقيادة معاوية بن أبي سفيان في زمن خلافة عمر بن الخطاب ثاني الخلفاء الراشدين الذي أمر بترميمها وتحصينها بالقلاع لحمايتها من هجمات الروم الذين حاولوا عبثاً استعادتها عدة مرات. وفي تلك الفترة لم تحظ بيروت بشهرة كبيرة وأهمية تذكر مثل تلك التي حظيت بها مدينة عكا كمركز تجاري في شرقي البحر المتوسط.\nعندما ارتقى معاوية بن أبي سفيان سدة الخلافة الإسلاميّة جلب إلى بيروت قوماً من الفرس وأسكنهم فيها مثلما فعل بغيرها من مدن الساحل الشامي وبعلبك. كانت المدينة خلال عهد الخلفاء الراشدين والأمويين ثم العباسيين، تابعة لدمشق، واتخذها المسلمون في العهود المذكورة رباطاً، أي قاعدة عسكريّة، ومنها انطلقت الجيوش العربيّة التي حملها معاوية على الأسطول الذي فتح به جزيرة قبرص أيام عثمان بن عفان. وفي أيام أبي جعفر المنصور، ثاني الخلفاء العباسيين، ظهر فيها عدد من العلماء البارزين أهمهم عبد الرحمن الأَوزاعي، المعروف باسم «الإمام الأوزاعي» المتوفى سنة 773، وقبره ما يزال موجوداً بالقرب منها عند الجهة الجنوبيّة على ساحل البحر، في منطقة أصبحت تحمل اسمه، وهذا القبر كان وما يزال مقصداً للناس الذين يزورونه ويتبركون به. استعاد ملك البيزنطيين «يوحنا زيميسياس» بيروت عام 974 ولبث فيها نحو سنة، ثم أخرجته منها القوات المصريّة التي أرسبها جوهر الصقلي في أيام العبيديين حكّام مصر في ذلك الحين، وفي زمنهم كانت هذه المدينة تابعة لدمشق المرتبطة رأساً بالقاهرة حاضرة الخلافة العبيديّة يومذاك.\n\nهاجمت جيوش الصليبيين بيروت سنة 1102، بالرغم من أنها لم تكن مهمة في ذلك الوقت، لكنها امتنعت عليهم وصدتهم، فلما كانت سنة 1110 أعادت هذه الجيوش الكرّة عليها بقيادة «بغدوين الأول» وتمكنت من احتلالها. وبقي الصليبيون في المدينة حتى سنة 1291، وكانت في تلك الفترة تابعة لمملكة بيت المقدس وقد اعتمد ازدهارها في ذلك الوقت على حركة تبادلها التجاري مع أوروبا في البهارات. ومن أشهر القواد الصليبيين الذين حكموا بيروت، «يوحنا الأول سيد إبلين»، الملقب «بسيد بيروت العجوز» (1179–1236) الذي قام بترميم المدينة بعد المعارك المتعددة مع صلاح الدين الأيوبي، كما بنى قصر آل إبلين فيها. استعاد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بيروت في سنة 1187، لكنها عادت إلى الصليبيين بعد حوالي عشرة أعوام، وبعد أن زالت الدولة الأيوبية وحلت مكانها دولة المماليك أرسل الملك الأشرف خليل ابن الملك قلاوون الصالحي جيشاً كبيراً إلى المدينة فاستعادها وجعلها تابعة لنيابة طرابلس الشام التي كانت مرتبطة رأساً بالقاهرة مقر السلطة المملوكيّة آنذاك.\n\nالعصور الحديثة\nفي سنة 1516 تغلب السلطان سليم الأول العُثماني على قنصوه الغوري سلطان المماليك وقضى عليه في معركة مرج دابق شمالي حلب، وتابع زحفه حتى احتل جميع بلاد الشام، ومن ذلك الحين دخلت بيروت في حوزة الدولة العثمانية وكان أول حاكم عُثماني فيها محمد بن قرقماز (قرقماز أوغلو) وهو جركسي. حُكمت المدينة من قبل الأمراء الدروز،  تارة من بني عسّاف وتارة من بني سيفا، ابتداءً من القرن السادس عشر، وفي تلك الفترة كانت بيروت مجرد قرية عادية، بعد أن قل فيها التجار وضعفت الأعمال الصناعية، والمهن البحرية، كالصيد وصناعة السفن وترميمها وتزويدها بالمؤن، وذلك إما لانتشار القراصنة في البحر المتوسط في ذلك الوقت، أو لانصراف الكثير من القوافل البحرية إلى الدوران حول إفريقيا عن طريق رأس الرجاء الصالح الذي اكتشف سنة 1498، فتحولت بذلك طريق التجارة مع الهند إليه بدلا من المرافئ اللبنانية. وفي السنوات العشر الأخيرة من القرن السادس عشر للميلاد، تغلب الأمير فخر الدين بن معن على الأمير يوسف بن سيفا الذي كان حاكماً على مدينة طرابلس وبلاد كسروان ومدينة بيروت وانتزع منه المقاطعة الكسروانيّة وبيروت وطرد من هذه المدينة الآغا الذي كان متسلماً عليها من طرف ابن سيفا. وقام فخر الدين خلال القرن السابع عشر بالاعتناء بعمران المدينة بشكل كبير، فازدهرت وانفتحت على أوروبا في أيامه، ومن المعالم التي أنشأها: البرج الذي عُرف فيما بعد باسم برج الكشاف، لأنه أستُعمل مرقباً لاستكشاف المراكب المعادية التي تحاول الإغارة على البلد، وإليه تنسب ساحة البرج الواقعة في الجهة الشرقية منه، والتي أصبحت تعرف اليوم بساحة الشهداء أو ساحة الحرية، وكذلك أنشأ الأمير قصراً له في بيروت بالاستعانة بخبرات بعض المهندسين الإيطاليين، وحديقة للحيوانات، وقام بزيادة عدد أشجار الصنوبر في حرج بيروت وتنسيق تلك الموجودة. وبعد زوال الإمارة المعنية عادت بيروت لتتبع ولاية طرابلس من جديد.\n\nفي السنوات الأخيرة من القرن الثامن عشر شهدت بيروت صراعاً شديداً بين حاكمها الشهابي الأمير يوسف وبين أحد أتباعه أحمد باشا الجزار، عندما كان كل منهما يحاول الاستئثار بها وتعرضت خلال هذا الصراع لاحتلالها من قبل أميرال البحر «سبنسكوف» الروسي، الذي كان يقوم بأعمال القرصنة في المياه العثمانيّة لحساب إمبراطورة روسيا كاترين الثانية، فلقد نصّب هذا القرصان مدافع في سهلات البرج ليتمكن من ضرب سور المدينة من قرب، ولهذا السبب أطلق الإفرنج على هذه السهلات اسم «ساحة المدفع»، ولكن احتلال الروس انتهى بعد شهور قليلة بعد أن دفعت لهم المدينة غرامة قدرها 25 ألف ريال بعملة ذلك الزمان. فعاد إليها الجزار وقبض على سيده السابق الأمير يوسف الشهابي بمعاونة ابن أخ الأخير، الأمير بشير الثاني الشهابي المشهور بالمالطي، وأعدمه سنة 1790 في مدينة عكا. في أيام الجزار مُنع الشهابيون من الإقامة في بيروت، وهُدمت بيوتهم التي كانت فيها، كما مُنع أهل جبل لبنان من السكن في هذه المدينة التي ألحقها الوالي المذكور بمدينة عكا التي اتخذها مركزاً له باسم ولاية عكا. والجزار هو الذي بنى السور الذي كان يحيط بيروت من كافة أطرافها ومنع الناس من السكن خارجه، فسجل انخفاض في عدد سكان المدينة إلى 8,000 نسمة في تلك الفترة، وبقي هذا المنع سارياً حتى سنة 1832، ففي هذه السنة اقتحمها إبراهيم باشا بن محمد علي باشا وهدم السور وأباح بناء المساكن خارجه، فعاد لبيروت دورها المهم مرة أخرى.\nبقيت بيروت تحت الحكم المصري من سنة 1832 حتى 1841 وهي المدة التي بقيت فيها بلاد الشام في حوزة إبراهيم باشا. وفي هذه الفترة عرفت هذه المدينة تطوراً أساسيًا شمل سائر مرافقها العُمرانيّة والإداريّة، ونما عدد سكانها يومئذٍ من 8 آلاف نسمة إلى 15 ألفاً، وذلك بسبب امتداد رقعتها إلى خارج السور الذي أمر إبراهيم باشا بهدمه وسمح للناس ببناء مساكنهم في الضواحي التي أصبحت فيما بعد جزءاً من المدينة نفسها، كما ازدهرت أحوالها التجاريّة بسبب اختيارها مركزاً للحجر الصحي، الأمر الذي أجبر جميع القادمين إلى الشام على الخضوع له للتأكد من سلامتهم الصحيّة وخلوهم من الأمراض المعديّة. وخلال عهد المصريين كان حاكم بيروت هو القائد في الجيش المصري سليمان باشا الفرنساوي. في سنة 1841 تمكنت الدولة العُثمانيّة من استعادة سيطرتها على بلاد الشام، فقاموا بنقل كرسي الولاية إليها وعيّنوا عليها والياً من قبلهم اسمه سليم باشا. وفي عهد هذا الوالي بدأت بيروت بالازدهار فازدادت عماراً وسكاناً، وانتقلت إليها تجارة الإفرنج، وعظم شأنها، وكثر مجيء المراكب الأوروبيّة إليها. وخلال أحداث 1860 بين الدروز والمسيحيين، لجأ الكثير من الموارنة النصارى إلى بيروت هربا من المذابح في جبل لبنان ودمشق.\n\nخلال منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ازداد سكان بيروت وتوسعت المدينة لتتخطى أسوارها. وفي خضم هذا التوسع قامت الإرساليات الغربية ومفكرو العالم العربي بتكوين المدينة. وأصبحت مركز الثقافة والفكر العربي ومركز تنوع عالمي بوجود الأوروبيين والأميركيين. فشركة المياه كانت بريطانية وشركة إمداد الغاز كانت فرنسية فيما أنشأ الأميركيون المدارس والجامعات ومن أشهرها الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت. واشتهرت فيها صناعات وتجارة الحرير. كما أنشأ الفرنسيون مرفأ بحريا عصريا في سنة 1894 ومدوا سكك الحديد بين بيروت ودمشق وحلب في سنة 1907. وكانت السفن الفرنسية تنقل البضائع بين بيروت ومارسيليا وسرعان ما أصبح للفرنسيين تأثير أكبر من أي دولة غربية أخرى، وفي تلك الفترة أخذ السكان يقتدون بالأوروبين في بعض نواحي عيشهم وفي ملبسهم. ونشرت موسوعة بريتانيكا أن توزيع سكان بيروت في سنة 1911 كان كالتالي: مسلمون (36,000 نسمة)، مسيحيون (77,000 نسمة)، يهود (2,500 نسمة)، دروز (400 نسمة)، أجانب (4,100 نسمة).\n\nالمرحلة المعاصرة\nخلال الحرب العالمية الأولى عصفت المجاعة والأمراض بجبل لبنان نتيجة لبعض التدابير العثمانية الضارة، وبسبب مجريات الحرب، وكنتيجة لهذا لجأ الكثير من أبناء الجبل إلى بيروت للحصول على لقمة عيشهم، وفي تلك الفترة قام بعض الوجهاء البيروتيين بتأسيس بعض الجمعيات التي أخذت على عاتقها تقديم المساعدات والإغاثات للجبليين مما خفف من وطأة الحرب عليهم. وبتاريخ 8 أكتوبر 1918 سقطت المدينة من العثمانيين ووقعت بأيدي قوات الحلفاء بقيادة الجنرال إدموند ألنبي. وأعلنت عصبة الأمم بيروت خاضعة للانتداب الفرنسي مع بقية مناطق جبل لبنان، البقاع وسوريا الكبرى. ثم أعلنها الفرنسيون في 1920 عاصمة لدولة لبنان الكبير، والتي أصبحت الجمهورية اللبنانية في سنة 1926 ولكن لم تنل استقلالها إلا في سنة 1943. وازدهرت بيروت خلال فترة الاستقلال وأصبحت نقطة استقطاب ثقافي واقتصادي لكل محيطها. فأصبحت بمثابة البلد الثاني أو المصيف للعديد من مواطني العالم العربي. وشهدت بيروت اضطرابات لفترة بسيطة سنة 1958 زمن الرئيس كميل شمعون بسبب الصراع حول حلف بغداد، وخلال فترة الستينات من القرن العشرين أصبحت المدينة تعرف باسم «باريس الشرق». وبعد حرب 1967 مع إسرائيل، أصبحت بيروت مركزاً أساسياً للفدائيين الفلسطينيين الذين حاربوا الأخيرة.\n\nسنوات الحرب الأهلية\nوفي العام 1975 اندلعت الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية وقسمت المدينة إلى شطرين: شرقي مسيحي، وغربي مسلم، وعم المدينة الخراب والفوضى. وقام الجيش الإسرائيلي في سنة 1978 باجتياح لبنان واحتلال أراضيه من الجنوب حتى نهر الليطاني في عملية أعطاها الجيش الإسرائيلي اسم هذا النهر ثم توسع الاحتلال في لبنان بعد العدوان الإسرائيلي الثاني في سنة 1982 ليصل مشارف العاصمة ويحاصرها. وفي سنة 1983 تمّ تفجير الثكنات العسكرية الفرنسية والأميركية في المدينة. وفي سنة 1990 استقر الوضع في لبنان وتوحدت بيروت وعادت إليها حركة العمران بسرعة لتعود مركزا تجارياً وثقافياً مهماً للمنطقة العربية من جديد بجهود جبارة من رئيس الوزراء اللبناني الأسبق رفيق الحريري.\nبعد اتفاق الطائف وانتهاء الحرب اللبنانية ومع تولي الرئيس رفيق الحريري الحكومة بدأ إعمار بيروت وإعادتها مجدداً إلى الساحة الدولية، فبدأ بإعمار وسط بيروت التي قامت شركة سوليدير ببنائه، وغدت بيروت مجدداً باريس الشرق حتى سنة 2005.\n\nاغتيال رفيق الحريري - الآن\nاغتيل رفيق الحريري بتاريخ 14 فبراير سنة 2005، بانفجار عبوة ناسفة كانت مزروعة على طريق خليج السان جورج حيث كان موكبه يعبر، وأسفر الانفجار عن أضرار جسيمة لحقت بالمباني المجاورة، وعن مقتل عدد من رفاق الحريري وعدد من المارّة. وفور ذيوع خبر وفاة الحريري سارت مظاهرات في عدد من شوارع بيروت أطلق فيها المتظاهرون شعارات ضد رئيس الجمهورية إميل لحود ورئيس الحكومة عمر كرامي والنظام السوري ممثلاً بالرئيس بشار الأسد، وعقد أطراف المعارضة اللبنانية اجتماعًا في دارة الحريري خلص إلى تحميل السلطة اللبنانية والسلطة السورية «بصفتها سلطة الوصاية» المسؤولية عن الجريمة. ودعا المجتمعون إلى رحيل السلطة القائمة وانسحاب القوات السورية بالكامل قبل الانتخابات، وأعلنوا عن إضراب شامل لثلاثة أيام. شكّل اغتيال رفيق الحريري بداية لسلسلة من الاغتيالات التي طالت سياسيين لبنانيين يعارضون الوجود السوري في البلاد، وقد اعتصمت القوى السياسية المعارضة في وسط بيروت التجاري طيلة شهران، أغلقت خلالها الكثير من المصالح، إلى أن انصاع رئيس الحكومة عمر كرامي، وتنحى عن منصبه، ثم تلا ذلك انسحبًا للجيش السوري من لبنان بتاريخ 26 أبريل تحت ضغط مظاهرات مناصري ما عرف لاحقًا بتحالف 14 آذار وقرار الأمم المتحدة رقم 1559. بعد انسحاب الجيش السوري حصلت عدّة مجادلات سياسية بين السلطة والمعارضة. وتخلل ذلك عدوان إسرائيلي في يوليو 2006 دُمرت خلاله البنية التحتية اللبنانية.\nوفي 7 أيار 2008، قام مسلحو المعارضة في لبنان من حزب الله وحركة أمل والحزب القومي السوري بالسيطرة على بيروت كردّ فعل على اتخاذ الحكومة قراراً بتفكيك شبكة الاتصالات الخاصة بالمقاومة وبعزل مدير مطار بيروت الدولي حيث اعتبرت المعارضة هذا القرار خرقًا للبيان الوزاري القاضي بدعم المقاومة في مواجهة الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. وتلا هذه العملية اتفاق في مدينة الدوحة أدى إلى إخلاء وسط بيروت من مظاهر الإضراب وأعاد الثقة بالسياحة اللبنانية. وبتاريخ 18 أكتوبر 2008 تبادل لبنان وسوريا السفراء لأول مرة في تاريخهما.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيروت على شبه جزيرة تتجه لناحية الغرب نحو البحر المتوسط، على بعد 94 كيلومتر (58 ميل) من شمال الحدود الفلسطينية اللبنانية. يحد المدينة من الشرق سلسلة جبال لبنان الغربية؛ وهي تتخذ شكلا مثلثا، بسبب وقوعها بين وعلى تلتين: تل الأشرفية وتل المصيطبة.\nتبلغ مساحة محافظة بيروت 18 كم² (6.9 ميل مربّع)، بينما تبلغ مساحة التجمع الحضري للمدينة 67 كم² (26 ميل مربّع).يعتبر الشاطئ البحري لبيروت متنوعا، فهو صخري في شمال المدينة، ورملي في جنوبها، وفي بعض الأقسام من الشمال يكون الشاطئ عبارة عن أجراف صخرية مرتفعة، كذلك فإن هذه النماذج جميعها يمكن أن تندمج سويا في بعض الأماكن، مثل نقطة التقاء شاطئ الروشة بشاطئ الرملة البيضاء.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في بيروت معتدل إجمالا، إذ يسود المناخ المتوسطي المتمثل بفصل صيف حار عالي الرطوبة، وربيع وخريف معتدلين، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يعتبر أغسطس أكثر شهور السنة حرّا، حيث يمكن أن يصل معدل الحرارة إلى 29 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، كما يعتبر شهرا يناير وفبراير أكثرها برودةً، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة في الشهر إلى 10 ° مئوية (50 ° فهرنهايت). يكون اتجاه الرياح غربيّا خلال فترة بعد الظهر والمساء، أي أنه يهب من البحر إلى اليابسة، أما في الليل، يتغير الاتجاه إلى الشرق، أي إنه يهب من اليابسة نحو البحر.\nيبلغ معدل الأمطار السنوية في بيروت 860 ميليمتر (34.1 إنش) والتي يتساقط معظمها خلال أشهر الشتاء، والقليل منها يتساقط في الخريف والربيع. تتساقط معظم الأمطار خلال عدد محدود من الأيام بشكل كثيف في العادة، أما الثلج فيندر أن يتساقط في بيروت، وبحال تساقط فإنه لا يتراكم، ويُستثنى من ذلك شتاء السنوات 1920، 1942، و1950، حيث هبّت ثلاث عواصف ثلجية كبيرة على لبنان أدت إلى هطول الثلوج على الساحل.\n\nمناطق بيروت\nتُقسم بيروت إلى 12 حيّاً معترفاً به:\n\nالأشرفية: عُرفت بهذا الاسم منذ حوالي سبعمائة سنة، أطلقت بعض النصوص عليها اسم «مزرعة الأشرفية»، وقد سُميت بذلك تيمنًا بالسلطان المملوكي الأشرف صلاح الدين خليل. تقع على الهضبة الشرقية البيروتيّة، وتشتهر بأنها منطقة راقية.\nعين المريسة: يرجع أصل اسمها إلى «الريّسة»، أي المرسى الصغير بصيغة «المرسة»، أي قطعة من الحبل، والعين التي هي الينبوع الصغير الذي يصب بالبحر.\nالباشورة: إحدى أقدم المناطق في بيروت، يرتقي عهدها إلى عصر الخليفة المنصور، وقد اشتهرت بوجود المقبرة الإسلامية فيها التي تفصل نحلة السور بينها وبين بيروت القديمة. يعني اسمها: البرج المتعالي الذي يقع على مدخل القلاع والمدن.\nميناء الحصن: في الأساس كانت تُدعى «ميناء الحسن»، ثم حُرفت مع الوقت فصارت السين تُلفظ صادًا. يُحتمل أنها حملت هذا الاسم لوجود برج حصن بيروت في المنطقة في قديم الزمان.\nالمزرعة: تيمنًا بالمزارع التي كانت قائمة بها قديمًا وأبرزها مزارع الحمضيات من ليمون وبرتقال.\nالمدوّر: تيمنًا بإحدى العائلات البيروتية.\nالمصيطبة: أصل الاسم يرجع إلى «مسطبة بيدمر»، كانت بريّة تقع خارج أسوار بيروت القديمة لحين تحرير المماليك للساحل الشامي من الصليبيين، فحينها أمر السلطان الأشرف صلاح الدين خليل، أمر بتحويل بيروت إلى قاعدة بحرية والانطلاق منها لاستعادة قبرص. فبدأ قادة الجيش والجند يستقرون في تلك المنطقة الخالية، ومع مرور الوقت استحالت قرية بحد ذاتها قبل أن تلتحم مع بيروت.\nالمرفأ: تيمنًا بمرفأ المدينة القديم الذي ما زال قائمًا في هذه المنطقة.\nرأس بيروت: كانت منطقة مقفرة من السكان، ولم يقطنها إلا بعض المزارعين الذين كانوا يتعاطون زراعة التين والصبار. سًميت كذلك لأن قسمًا منها، وهو القسم الذي يدخل البحر، يشبه الرأس في تكوينه. أخذت المنطقة تصبح آهلة بالسكان بعد بناء الكلية السورية الإنجيلية عام 1865، وعدد من المعاهد والكليّات الأجنبية، فتوافد البيارتة القدماء عليها، واستقروا هناك، وما لبث أن استقطبت المنطقة عدد من الأجانب أيضًا الذين اختلطوا مع أهل المدينة الأصليين.\nالرميل: إحدى الأحياء القديمة في المدينة، كان حيًا شعبيًا في بادئ الأمر قبل أن ينمو ويستحيل منطقة أرستقراطية، خاصة بعد إعادة بناءه عند انتهاء الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية.\nالصيفي: يشتهر هذا الحي بمطاعمه ومقاهيه عربية الطابع، ونزله القديم التي تعود للعهدين العثماني والفرنسي، ومرابعه ونواديه الليلية الحديثة.\nزقاق البلاط: أحد الأحياء المستحدثة في القرن التاسع عشر، بعد تطوّر مدينة بيروت واستحداثها عاصمة ولاية. سُمي كذلك تيمنًا بزقاق طويل رُصفت أرضه بالبلاط. كان هذا الحي ذو طابع أرستقراطي، إذ قطنه البيارتة الميسورين والموظفين الحكوميين العثمانيين من أتراك وشركس وأرمن، أما اليوم فيُعد حيًا شعبيًا ذو طابع تراثي. تميز هذا الحي وما زال بتنوعه العرقي والطائفي، فالكثير من سكانه ذوي جذور عربية، وبعضهم تركي وكردي وأرمني الأصل، وأغلب السكّان مسلمون يتبعون المذهبين السني والشيعي، وهناك قسم من السكان مسيحي يتبع كنيستيّ الروم والأرمن الأرثوذكس، وكان هناك وجود في السابق لعدة أسر يهودية.\nويُقسّم كل من هذه الأحياء إلى مناطق عقارية متعددة. تقع ثلاثة مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين في بيروت من أصل 12 مخيما رسميا في لبنان، وهذه المخيمات هي: مخيم برج البراجنة، مخيم شاتيلا، ومخيم مار الياس، وجميعها تقع جنوبي المدينة. ومن بين الخمس عشر مخيمًا الغير رسميّة في لبنان، فإن واحد منها منها، وهو مخيم صبرا، يقع في بيروت، بالقرب من مخيم شاتيلا.\n\nسكان بيروت\nتختلف تقديرات عدد سكان بيروت بشكل واسع، فهي تصل بحسب بعض الإحصاءات إلى 938,940 نسمة، بينما تصل بالنسبة لإحصاءات أخرى إلى 1,303,129 نسمة، وإلى 2,012,000 نسمة بالنسبة للبعض الآخر. إن غياب العدد الصحيح لسكان بيروت يعود إلى أنه لم يتم أي تعداد رسمي للسكان في لبنان منذ سنة 1932.\n\nالتركيبة العرقيّة\nتُعد بيروت، كغيرها من مدن بلاد الشام الكبرى، مدينة ذات مزيج عرقي كبير، يظهر جليًا في أسماء وألقاب العائلات والأسر التي تقطنها حاليًا. وسبب هذا المزيج هو الشعوب المختلفة التي مرّت على الشام ككل، واستقر البعض منها واختلط مع أبناء البلاد، لكن على الرغم من ذلك يبقى واضحًا طغيان عنصر معيّن على بقيّة العناصر، فغالبية البيارتة من مسلمين ومسيحيين، هم من أصول عربية سواء من توطن منهم فيها قبل الفتح الإسلامي، أو في ظل تلك الفتوح، كما شهدت بيروت موجات جديدة من الهجرات العربية سواء من المشرق العربي أو من المغرب العربي. وقد شهد عهدا الخلافة العربية بما فيها العهد الفاطمي والزنكي والأيوبي والمملوكي والصليبي هجرة الكثير من الأعاجم واستقرارهم في بيروت، وكذلك كان الحال في عهد الخلافة العثمانية. كما شهدت القرون السابقة والقرن العشرين العديد من النزوح من المناطق اللبنانية إلى بيروت خاصةً.\n\nكانت بيروت قبيل الفتح الإسلامي مأهولة من قبل العرب والسريان والروم، وعندما فتح المسلمون الساحل الشامي شهدت المدينة قدوم العديد من العناصر العسكرية والمدنية التي تنتمي إلى قبائل عربية، وقد توطنت في بيروت، ومنها من حافظت على أسماء قبائلها، في حين أن البعض الآخر اتخذ أسماء جديدة هي عبارة عن ألقاب وصفات ومهن، ومن القبائل العربية التي استوطنت بيروت: بنو حزم وبنو مخزوم وبنو قيس وبنو زيدان، وسواهم، وتفرّعت منهم أسر عديدة. من أبرز أصول البيارتة المعاصرين الأصول المغربية والأندلسية، وقد بدأ المغاربة والأندلسيين يتوافدون إلى بلاد الشام ومدنها خلال العهد الصليبي، فقد انتقل آلاف المغاربة من بلادهم إلى الشام للمشاركة في الجهاد ضد الصليبيين، ووقع الكثير منهم أسرى، وقد حرص التجار والأمراء والسلاطين المسلمين على فك أسرهم نظرًا لما قدّموه من تضحيات، ومنحوهم منحًا مالية ووطنوهم في المدن وأدخلوهم في حاشيتهم. كما أن قسمًا كبيرًا منهم أتى بغرض طلب العلم. أما القسم الأعظم من المغاربة والأندلسيين، فقد وصل بيروت عقب سقوط الأندلس سنة 1492، وعقب الاحتلال الفرنسي لبلدان المغرب أواخر القرن التاسع عشر، وطرد الكثير من السكّان بهدف توطين فرنسيين بدلاً منهم. كذلك يظهر جليًا الأصل المصري لبعض العائلات البيروتية، من خلال تلقبها باسم المدينة أو البلدة التي وصلوا منها، مثل: الإسكندراني والرشيدي، والجيزي، وأغلب البيارتة ذوي الأصول المصرية وصلوا المدينة خلال عهد الحكم المصري لبلاد الشام. أما باقي الأسر البيروتية ذات الجذور العربية فأصولها عراقية وشاميّة مجاورة وحجازية ويمنية.\n\nتعرضت بيروت ومختلف بلاد الشام لموجات هجرة مدنية وعسكرية في العهود الأيوبية والمملوكية والعثمانية، خاصة وأن هذه العهود صاحبتها مجيء عشرات الآلاف من العساكر المقاتلة، بالإضافة إلى أن حكّام وسلاطين هذه العهود كانوا يعمدون إلى إسكان الجيوش بكثرة في المناطق الخاضعة لهم للدفاع عنها وصبغها بلون واحد. وبناءً على ذلك تعرضت بيروت خلال تلك العهود لهجرات وموجات سكانية تمازجت مع العائلات البيروتية القديمة وتصاهرت معها، ومن أبرز الأعاجم الذين سكنوا بيروت: الأتراك والإيرانيين والأكراد والشركس والألبان، واليونان، والأرمن. ومن هذه العائلات من احتفظ باسمه الأصلي، وأغلبها اتخذ أسماءً وألقاب جديدة تدل على أصوله مثل: الأصفهاني، والأرناؤوط (من ألبانيا)، والبوشناق، وجركس، والمورللي، والكردي، والإزمرلي، وغيرها. كذلك شهدت بيروت بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الأولى قدوم عساكر من مسلمي الهند قدموا مع الجيش البريطاني. وقد استقر بعضهم في بيروت وحملوا اسم عائلة «الهندي». أيضًا هناك قلّة نادرة من البيارتة ترجع بأصولها إلى أفريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى، وهؤلاء يتحدرون من الرقيق الأسود، الذي كانت تجارته ناشطة إلى نهاية الدولة العثمانية، ومن الجنود السنغال الذين عملوا في الجيش الفرنسي طيلة فترة الانتداب. وقد تمازج هؤلاء وتفاعلوا مع البيارتة منذ أوائل القرن العشرين، لذلك فقد ضاعوا تقريبًا في المزيج البيروتي.\n\nالتركيبة الطائفيّة\nتعتبر بيروت أكثر مدن لبنان غنى بالتنوع الديني والمذهبي، ويُحتمل أيضا أن تكون أكثر مدن الشرق الأوسط غنى بهذا التنوع، إذ أن لكل من المسلمين والمسيحيين وجود فعّال فيها. هناك 9 طوائف رئيسيّة في بيروت هي: السنّة، الشيعة، الدروز، الموارنة، الروم الأرثوذكس، الروم الكاثوليك، الأرمن الأرثوذكس، الأرمن الكاثوليك، البروتستانت. يتولى الفصل في المنازعات والقضايا الدينية، أو قضايا الأحوال الشخصية، القضاء الديني المختص بالنسبة لكل طائفة على حدى. إن المطالبة بالزواج المدني في لبنان قوبلت بالرفض من قبل رؤساء الطوائف الروحية حتى الآن، ولكن الحكومة تعترف بالزواج المدني الذي انعقد في الخارج. يعيش في بيروت حاليا عدد قليل من اليهود، ولكن في السابق كان هناك نسبة كبيرة نسبيا من اليهود تسكن في حي وادي أبو جميل بوسط بيروت، ولا يزال الكنيس اليهودي قائما هناك حتى اليوم. ومن آثار اليهود الباقية في بيروت أيضا المقبرة اليهودية الواقعة في القسم الشرقي من المدينة، والتي دُفن فيها أيضا بعض الجنود الفرنسيين الذين خدموا في لبنان أيام الانتداب.\nويتوزع سكان بيروت على الشكل التالي: مسلمون:65% (السنّة:80%، الشيعة:12%، الدروز:8%)، مسيحيون:30% (الموارنة:40%، الروم الارثوذكس:40%، الروم الكاثوليك:12%، الأرمن:8%)، أقليات ويهود:5%.\nكان للحرب الأهلية اللبنانية تأثير على ديمغرافية السكان وتوزع الطوائف في بيروت، فقبل الحرب كانت الأحياء السكنية أكثر اختلاطاً بالمذاهب المختلفة، أما اليوم فإن كل قسم من بيروت يطغى عليه طابع معين، فبيروت الشرقية أكثر سكانها مسيحيون، مع أقليّة سنيّة، بينما بيروت الغربية أكثر سكانها مسلمون سنّة، وفيها أقليّة مسيحية وشيعيّة. ويُلاحظ اليوم أن انتقال السكان المسيحيين والمسلمين من وإلى القسم الغربي والشرقي من المدينة عاد على نحو بسيط. يسكن ضاحية بيروت الجنوبية أكثرية شيعيّة، مع وجود أقليّة صغيرة من السنّة والمسيحيين. كان لبيروت تاريخ من عدم الاستقرار السياسي كنتيجة للانقسامات الطائفية، كما لعب الدين دوراً في السابق في تقسيم المجتمع اللبناني، كما يتضح من الحرب الأهلية الأخيرة.\n\nاللاجئون والعمّال\nكان الأرمن من أول اللاجئين إلى بيروت في المرحلة المعاصرة، وبدأ وصول الأرمن إلى لبنان سنة 1915 بعد ارتكاب المذابح بحقهم من قبل الأتراك، وأول منطقة سكنوها كانت منطقة الكرنتينا ومن ثم برج حمود، حيث لا يزال المتحدرين منهم يقيمون هناك حتى اليوم. كانت بيروت إحدى المدن الرئيسية في لبنان التي سكنها اللاجئون الفلسطينيون سنة 1948، كذلك هناك عدد كبير من السوريين والمصريين الذين يقطنون المدينة ويعمل معظمهم في قطاع الخدمات والبناء. وبعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق سنة 2003، قدم لبنان حوالي 100,000 عراقي وسكن الكثير منهم في بيروت، إلا أن الحكومة أبعدت قسرا جزءاً كبيرا منهم أو قامت بسجنهم بسبب وصولهم بطريقة غير شرعية.\nبالإضافة لذلك هناك عدد كبير من المهاجرين غير العرب في بيروت مثل الأفغان، الإيرانيين، والباكستانيين، كما شهدت السنوات الأخيرة تزايدا في أعداد القادمين من الحبشة، وبلدان جنوب شرق آسيا، مثل إندونيسيا، الفلبين، ماليزيا، وسريلانكا، ويعمل هؤلاء في العادة كخدم في المنازل أو المكاتب، والبعض يُباشر أعمالا خاصة به، مثل الإيرانيين الذين يعملون إجمالا في صناعة السجاد العجمي.\n\nالخدمات الاقتصادية والتجارية والصناعية والصحية\nالاقتصادية\nتستقطب مدينة بيروت رجال الأعمال من لبنانيين وعرب وأجانب، وتتدفق إلى مصارفها تحويلات من كل أنحاء العالم. لذلك هي مركز مصرف لبنان وبورصته، وتحتل المركز المصرفي الأول في الشرق الأوسط، من هنا اتخذت مركزاً لاتحاد المصارف العربية، وساعد في ذلك السرية المصرفية التي يتبعها لبنان.\n\nالعملة والمصارف\nكان اللبنانيون عموما يتعاملون بالليرة العثمانية أيام الحكم العثماني، وكان الناس يرمزون إلى العملة باسم «العثمليّة» أو «الليرة العثمليّة»، وخلال عهد الحكم المصري في لبنان (1831-1840)، وفي السنوات اللاحقة بعده، تعامل البيروتيين بالعملة المصرية، وكانوا يرمزون إليها «بالمصرية»، ومن هذه العملة اكتسبت النقود لفظتيّ «مصاري» و«مصريات» اللتين لا تزالان تستعملان حتى اليوم في بيروت وكافة أنحاء لبنان وسوريا بمعنى نقود.\nبعد أن خضع لبنان للانتداب الفرنسي، أصدر الجنرال هنري غورو، المفوض السامي الفرنسي في سوريا ولبنان، نقدا خاصا لكلا البلدين، وقد حصر الإصدار «ببنك سوريا ولبنان»، وكان هذا المصرف فرنسيّا مقره باريس، وربطت حكومة الانتداب النقد اللبناني بالفرنك الفرنسي الذي كانت قيمته قد انخفضت كثيرا آنذاك، وجعلت الليرة وحدة العملة اللبنانية وقسمتها إلى مائة قرش، وبهذا ظهرت الليرة اللبنانية. وبعد زوال الانتداب حصلت قطيعة اقتصادية بين لبنان وسوريا بتاريخ 15 مارس 1950 بسبب تباين وجهات النظر الاقتصادية بين الدولتين، فكان هذا حافزا للحكومة اللبنانية كي تعيد تنظيم اقتصاد الدولة، فأنشأت في أوائل ستينات القرن العشرين «مصرف لبنان» أو «البنك المركزي» الذي حلّ مكان بنك سوريا ولبنان في إصدار النقد اللبناني.\n\nنشطت حركة المصارف بسبب الازدهار الاقتصادي خلال فترة الستينات وأوائل السبعينات، فبعد أن كان عدد المصارف لا يزيد عن عشرة بعد الاستقلال، ارتفع في فترة الازدهار إلى قرابة المئة، وقد اختيرت مدينة بيروت سنة 1974 مركزا لاتحاد المصارف العربية، وتشجيعا لهذا القطاع الاقتصادي، أقرت الحكومة قانون السرية المصرفية أملةً في اجتذاب الودائع الكبيرة من لبنان والبلاد العربية، وقد أعطت هذه السياسة ثمارها وظهرت نتائجها في المبالغ الطائلة التي أودعت في المصارف اللبنانية في بيروت، والتي بلغت في بعض الأوقات ما يزيد عن 6 مليارات ليرة. ومن المصارف التي تتخذ من بيروت مقرا رئيسيّا لها: بنك بيروت، بنك بلوم، بنك بيبلوس، بنك عودة، بنك لبنان والمهجر، بالإضافة لعدد من البنوك المشتركة مع بعض الدول العربية مثل البنك اللبناني الكويتي والبنك اللبناني المصري، وغير العربية كالبنك اللبناني الكندي، كما توجد بعض الفروع لمصارف أوروبية مثل البنك البريطاني (HSBC).\nعلى الرغم من الأزمة الاقتصادية العالمية (2007 و2009 والمستمرّة حتى الآن)، فإن مصارف لبنان لم تتأثر بها بشكل يذكر، وبالتالي فإن قيمة الليرة اللبنانية بقيت مستقرة نسبيّا، ويعود ذلك إلى الإجراءات الصارمة التي تتبع عند منح القروض وغيرها من المدفوعات، والتي نصّ عليها وفرضها حاكم مصرف لبنان، رياض سلامة. حصل الأخير على جائزة «أفضل حاكم مصرف مركزي لسنة 2009»، كونه كان قادرا على منع وصول الأثار السلبية للأزمة الاقتصادية العالمية إلى لبنان، كما كان قد حصل على نفس الجائزة سنة 2006.\n\nبورصة بيروت\nبورصة بيروت هي سوق الأوراق المالية الوحيدة العاملة في لبنان. تعتبر بورصة بيروت واحدة من أقدم الأسواق المالية في المنطقة حيث يعود تاريخ تأسيسها لسنة 1920، تحت سلطة الانتداب الفرنسي، وكانت ثاني أقدم سوق مالية في العالم العربي. وفي أوائل الخمسينات تميز، الاقتصاد اللبناني بنشاط ملحوظ حيث بدأت شركات صناعية ومصرفية وخدماتية تدخل البورصة لتجعل من بورصة بيروت أفضل سوق مالي في المنطقة مع دخول حوالي خمسين شركة. مع اندلاع الأحداث اللبنانية سنة 1975 تراجعت حركة التداول في بورصة بيروت، ومع تدهور الوضع الأمني، علق العمل في البورصة من سنة 1983، ولم تعاود نشاطها حتى 22 ديسمبر 1996، أي بعد 13 عاما. في نهاية سنة 2006 أطلقت بورصة بيروت نظام تداول جديد عن بعد، يسمح للوسطاء بتداول الصكوك المدرجة على بورصة بيروت عن بعد من مكاتبهم الخاصة. وفي 13 فبراير 2008 قررت البورصة الإجازة باعتماد التداول الإلكتروني «عن بعد» على بورصة بيروت عبر الانترنت وذلك حصراً من خلال شركات الوساطة المعتمدة في البورصة. تقع بورصة بيروت اليوم في وسط المدينة التجاري، بعد أن نُقل مقرها إلى هناك سنة 2002.\n\nمرفأ بيروت\nتعد بيروت مركزًا لأحد أهم وأكبر الموانئ الواقعة شرق البحر المتوسط وهو مرفأ بيروت؛ حيث أن موقعه وعمق المياه فيه يتيح له أن يستقبل أكبر المراكب وسفن الشحن. فقد ظهر أن القسم المخصص منه لتخزين الحاويات كان يعمل ويحوي ما يزيد عن العدد العادي الذي يُفترض به أن يحويه، لأكثر من 10 سنوات، قبل أن تظهر الدراسات أنه يقدر أن يحوي هذا المقدار. كما وتوجد المقرات الرئيسيّة للعديد من المصارف والشركات اللبنانية في بيروت، وبعض فروع الأجنبية منها.\n\nالخدمات التجارية\nتشكل التجارة جزءاً من طبيعة البيروتيين الذين اكتشفوا منذ القدم أهمية موقع مدينتهم المرفئية، كجمال التقاء بين الشرق والغرب يتمتع بميزات تسهم في إنجاح المبادرات التجارية على اختلافها. فغدت بيروت مركزاً مالياً وتجارياً وصناعياً مرموقاً يتعاطى جميع النشاطات المالية والخدمات المصرفية بالإضافة إلى نشاطات أخرى متعددة في قطاعات البناء والتجارة والاستيراد والتصدير والصناعة.\nوتتمركز في بيروت المؤسسات الاقتصادية والتجارية الكبرى لتأمين الخدمات واستثمار المشاريع الإنشائية، ما وفر العمل للعديد من اللبنانيين، وجلب العديد من المستهلكين إليها، وقد ساعد في ذلك اعتماد لبنان النظام الرأسمالي الحر، وإقراره قانون السرية المصرفية وتوسيع وتطوير كل من مطار بيروت الدولي ومرفأ بيروت والمنطقة الحرة في كل من هذين المرفقين الحيويين الذين يعتبران عن حق بداية الشرق ومنفذاً للدول العربية على البحر المتوسط، وجسر الغرب الصناعي للشرق الاستهلاكي.\n\nجمعيّة تجّار بيروت\nتأسست جمعية تجـار بيروت سنة 1921 وأعترف بها رسـمياً بموجب رخصـة رسـمية مؤرخة في أبريل 1921. وكان الهدف الأساسي للمؤسسين العمل على توحيد جهود التجار في مدينة بيروت والتي كانت ركن الأساس للتجارة اللبنانية، وتنسيق مساعيهم في خدمة مهنتهم والاعتناء بالوسائل التي من شأنها حماية التجارة اللبنانية وتشجيعها ورفع مستواها والدفاع عن مصالحها ومصالح أعضائها والعمل على تقدمها وتقدمهم من جميع النواحي الاقتصادية، والعمل على إيجاد المشاريع التجارية وتنشيطها على اختلاف أنواعها والسعي لتعزيز مدينة بيروت الاقتصادي وإنشاء مكتب للاستعلامات التجارية وناد لتعارف التجار توثيقاً للروابط بينهم والتوسط لدى السلطات الرسمية والدوائر الحكومية لرفع كل حيف يقع عليهم والعمل لكل ما يعود بالنفع على الجمعية عموماً.\n\nالخدمات الصناعية\nتتمركز في بيروت وضواحيها 66% من المؤسسات الصناعية اللبنانية نظراً إلى سهولة الحصول على المواد الأولية عبر مرفأ بيروت بالإضافة إلى توافر اليد العاملة.\n\nالخدمات الصحية\nفي بيروت أهم المستشفيات اللبنانية وأكثرها تجهيزاً وكفاية معظم الجهاز الطبي اللبناني، فضلاً عن المستوصفات والصيدليات ومستودعات الأدوية. اشتهرت في الماضي بأنها مستشفى العرب، وبعد الحرب عادت تدريجياً إلى موقعها المرموق ويأتي إليها العديد من العرب خصوصاً للحصول على الطبابة المميزة. ومن أبرز مستشفيات بيروت: مستشفى الجامعة الأميركية، مستشفى رزق، مستشفى أوتيل ديو، ومستشفى المقاصد.\n\nبيروت الرسمية\nيقع البرلمان اللبناني في العاصمة بيروت، وكذلك السراي الكبير، مقر الحكومة. تحوي بيروت أيضا جميع الوزارات ومعظم الإدارات الرسميّة، السفارات والقنصليات. بيروت هي إحدى المحافظات الستة اللبنانية، والخمسة الأخرى هي: البقاع، لبنان الشمالي، لبنان الجنوبي، جبل لبنان، والنبطية.\n\nبلديّة بيروت\nتتكون بلدية بيروت من مجلس البلديّة ولجان ذلك المجلس. يتألف مجلس البلدية من رئيس البلدية ونائبه وأعضاء المجلس البالغ عددهم 24 شخصا. أما لجان المجلس فقد حدد القانون عددها بست عشرة لجنة هي: لجنة المناقصات، لجنة المال والإدارة، لجنة متابعة مقررات المجلس البلدي، اللجنة القانونية، لجنة الحدائق والصحة والبيئة، لجنة التخطيط والأشغال والأملاك والاستملاكات، لجنة الإعلام والعلاقات العامة، لجنة تسمية الشوارع والسير والإنارة والنقل، لجنة الشؤون الاجتماعية والثقافية والرياضية، ولجنة المؤسسات المصنفة. يشمل الجدول أدناه أسماء محافظو بيروت من عام 1936 إلى الوقت الحاضر: كامل عبّاس حميّة (1936 – 1941)، نقولا رزق الله (1946 – 1952)، جورج عاصي (1952 – 1956)، بشّور حدّاد (1956 – 1958)، فيليب بولس (1959 – 1960)، إميل ينّي (1960 – 1967)، شفيق أبو حيدر (1967 – 1977)، متري النمّار (1977 – 1987)، جورج سماحة (1987 – 1991)، نايف المعلوف (1992 – 1995)، نقولا سابا (1995 – 1999)، يعقوب الصرّاف (1999 – 2005)، ناصيف قالوش (2005 – 2014)، زياد شبيب (2014 –).\n\nالمنظمات الدولية\nتتخذ بعض المنظمات الدولية من بيروت مقرّاً لها، ومن ذلك لجنة الأمم المتحدة الاقتصادية والاجتماعية لغربي آسيا (الإسكوا، ESCWA) المتمركزة في وسط بيروت التجاري. وكذلك فهناك مكاتب إقليمية في المدينة لكل من منظمة العمل الدولية (ILO)، ومنظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة (اليونسكو، UNESCO)، والتي تغطي كافة أنحاء العالم العربي. بالإضافة لذلك، يقع المقر الرئيسي للاتحاد العربي للنقل الجوي (AACO) في بيروت أيضاً.\n\nالتعليم\nالتعليم الأساسي\nينتشر في بيروت عدد من المدارس الخاصة، ومن أشهرها: الإنترناشونال كولدج، بيروت (الكليّة العالمية في بيروت، IC)، كلية لويس فاغمان، مدرسة الجالية الأميركية في بيروت، ثانوية الروضة، كلية السيدة الأرثوذكسية، الكلية الفرنسية البروتستانتية (بالفرنسية: Collège Protestant Français)، مدرسة القلب الأقدس - الجميّزة (بالفرنسية: Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé)، الثانوية الفرنسية اللبنانية الكبرى (بالفرنسية: Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais). كذلك هناك بعض الجمعيّات الخيريةّ التي تُنشأ المدارس الخاصة مثل جمعية المقاصد الخيرية الإسلامية، والتي أنشأت عدّة مدارس خاصة في بيروت بقي منها 8 اليوم، ومن أهمها كلية المقاصد للبنات وكلية خالد بن الوليد.\n\nيعتمد انتقال الطالب إلى مرحلة التعليم العالي على حصوله على شهادة البكالوريا اللبنانية، ولكن يُقبل أيضا بالبكالوريا الفرنسية، باعتبار أنه تمت مساواتها بتلك اللبنانية، ويحصل الشخص على هذه الشهادة عن طريق نجاحه في امتحانات الثانوية العامة الرسمية. تعتبر البكالوريا الفنية أو المهنية بديلا عن تلك العادية بالنسبة لمن درس في المعاهد الفنية.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nيؤمن التعليم العالي في بيروت، وجميع أنحاء لبنان، عدد من المعاهد المهنية ومؤسسات التعليم العادي، مثل الكليّات الجامعية، المؤسسات الجامعية، والجامعات. ومن بين كل صروح العلم هذه المنتشرة عبر الدولة، فإن الجامعة اللبنانية هي مؤسسة التعليم العالي الرسميّة الوحيدة التي تقع في العاصمة. تُدار جميع الكليّات والجامعات في بيروت ولبنان من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم العالي، ويعتبر الوزير المختص مسؤولا عن وضع البرامج التعليمية وتقرير موعد الامتحانات الرسميّة وصيانة هذه المؤسسات والحفاظ عليها بشكل عام.\nهناك عدد كبير من الطلاب الأجانب الذين يكملون دراساتهم العليا في بيروت، وأكثرهم من الخليج العربي وسوريا والعراق، والبعض من إيران وأوروبا، وينبغي على أي أجنبي من الذين يرغبون بمتابعة تعليمهم العالي في لبنان أن يستوفي المؤهلات المطلوبة في اللبنانيين أنفسهم، فيجب أولا أن تكون شهادته الثانوية معادلة للبكالوريا اللبنانية كي يسمح له بالتسجيل في أي مؤسسة تعليم عالي. لا يخضع الطلاب الأجانب لأي نظام محاصصة، وتُقدم الحكومة المنح الدراسيّة ضمن نطاق الاتفاقات الثانئية التي عُقدت مع الدولة الأم للطالب الأجنبي أو الدولة التي يرغب الطالب اللبناني بالتعلّم فيها. وعند حصول أي لبناني أو أجنبي على شهادة أجنبية، فإنه يجب التصديق عليها من قبل السفارة اللبنانية في ذلك البلد ووزارة الخارجية في لبنان، ومن ثم يبقى على الأجنبي المرشح للدخول في المؤسسة التعليمية أن يذهب بنفسه ومعه المستندات المطلوبة لإكمال إجراءات التسجيل في الجامعة أو المعهد الذي ينشده.\nتعتبر بيروت مركزا لبعض أهم وأشهر الجامعات في الشرق الأوسط، مثل الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت، جامعة القديس يوسف، المعهد العالي للأعمال، والجامعة اللبنانية الأميركية، وبعض الجامعات والكليّات ذات الأهمية المحلية مثل جامعة بيروت العربية، والجامعة الأميركية للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالعمران\nإن النظام المعماري في بيروت في العهد العثماني يعتبر من أجمل ملامح التراث البيروتي واللبناني والعربي والعثماني، وتشهد الآثار العُثمانيّة المتبقية من منازل ودور وقصور وسرايات وثكن ومدارس ومساجد، جمال وروعة هذا التراث. وعلى سبيل المثال فإن النشاطات الاقتصاديّة كانت ممثلة بالأسواق التجاريّة والصناعيّة والحرفيّة، من بين هذه الأسواق على سبيل المثال والتي كانت قائمة منذ العهد العُثماني: سوق الأساكفة، سوق البازركان، سوق العطارين، سوق الحدادين، وكثير غيرها. كانت بيوت البيارتة في تلك الفترة متواضعة بشكل عام، سقوفها مدعمة بالجسور الخشبيّة، وكان يصعد إلى الطابق العلوي بواسطة سلم حجر داخلي وسلم حجر خارجي، علماً أن بعض البيوت الأخرى كانت سلالمها مصنوعة من الأخشاب، أما المساطب فكانت نمطاً معمارياً تقليدياً موجود أمام بيوت بيروت كافة، كما وجدت في بيروت القديمة وفي ضواحيها القريبة بعض البيوت المتواضعة التي بنيت كلها من الخشب، وكانت تبطن الجدران الخشبية بصفائح من القصدير أو الزنك لمنع الهواء من الدخول إلى المنازل.\n\nوبشكل عام فإن بيروت في القرن التاسع عشر كانت تتميز بمنازل سقوفها من القرميد الأحمر الموضوع فوق السقوف الخشبية، وبغرف واسعة ذات سقوف عالية، وإيوان جميل متسع يُسمّى المنزول وهو ما يُعرف حاليّا بالصالون أو غرفة الاستقبال. وكان يتخلل المنازل شبابيك شرعيّة، وفتحات زجاجيّة مرتفعة مصنوعة من الزجاج الملون وفي غالبية منازل بيروت شرفات في الطابق الأول، في أعلاها فتحات زجاجيّة مصنوعة من الزجاج الملّون، كما يتخلل الغرف بعض فتحات التهوئة، وكانت المنازل البيروتيّة تضّم عادة عليّة التي تُعرف محليا باسم «المتخّت» أو «التتخيتة» التي يعلوها عادة القافعة التي يصعد منها إلى سطح المنزل، حيث السطيحة التي يظللها العرزال ومسابك زهور الفل والزنبق والرياحين والياسمين.\nوفي فترة لاحقة تأثر البيروتيين بنمط العمارة الأوروبي، فأخذت البيوت ذات طابع العمارة الإيطالية والفرنسية تنتشر بالمدينة شيئا فشيئا حتى استبدلت الكثير من المباني ذات الطابع العربي أو العثماني. وفي فترة لاحقة، ومع ازدياد الكثافة السكانية، أخذ الناس يبنون العمارات المتعددة الطوابق فحلت مكان معظم الأبنية التقليدية لدرجة أن أي حي سكني به عمارة قديمة من أيام العثمانيين والفرنسيين تصنفه البلدية على أنه «حي ذو طابع تراثي». وبعد انتهاء الحرب الأهلية، قامت شركة «سوليدير» بإعادة بناء وسط المدينة المدمر، فبنت معظم المناطق السكنية في تلك المنطقة على الطراز الأوروبي.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nالمواصلات\nإن استعمال وسائل المواصلات حاجة ضرورية يومية بالنسبة لكل من يسكن المدينة أو خارجها، على الرغم من صغر حجمها. تُقسّم وسائل النقل في بيروت إلى مواصلات برية، بحرية، وجويّة.\n\nالمواصلات البرية\nتتصل بيروت بغيرها من المدن اللبنانية والمدن السورية الرئيسيّة، عن طريق الحافلات التي يتبع كل منها شبكة طرقات معينة في تنقله. وتتمركز الحافلات التي تنقل الركاب إلى شمال لبنان وسوريا في محطة شارل حلو الواقعة في شمال بيروت. وفي بيروت شركتين رئيسيتين تقدم خدمات النقل للمواطنين: الأولى هي الشركة اللبنانية للمواصلات (LCC)، وهي شركة خاصة تؤمن النقل بداخل المدينة وبعض الضواحي، وهي تتبع 10 طرقات رئيسيّة تغطي معظم المنطقة المركزية لبيروت. أما الشركة الثانية، فهي مصلحة سكك الحديد والنقل المشترك، وهي شركة عامّة، تتبع حافلاتها 12 خطّا رئيسيّا في المدينة.\nبالإضافة إلى الحافلات، التي تستخدمها طبقة واسعة من الشعب وخصوصا أبناء الطبقات الفقيرة بسبب التعرفة البخسة، تنتشر في بيروت سيارات الأجرة والسرفيس، والأخيرة عبارة عن أجرة أرخص بكثير من الأجرة العادية، وتعرفتها محددة مسبقا، وهي تصل حاليّا في بيروت إلى 100,000 ليرة لبنانية، والغالب أن يستقل الناس سيارة الأجرة باعتبار أنها «سرفيس»، ولتفادي أي سوء تفاهم فقد جرت العادة على أن يخبر الراكب السائق بالمكان الذي يقصده، فإذا كان بعيدا تعتبر الأجرة عاديّة، وإن كان ضمن حدود المدينة تعتبر «سرفيس». كذلك تُستعمل الميكروباصات في نقل الأفراد من بيروت إلى بعض البلدات والقرى والمدن اللبنانية.\nوفي فترة سابقة، كان الترامواي أيضا يؤدي خدمة النقل بداخل المدينة، وقد جرى الاحتفال بتدشين خط الترامواي ببيروت في شهر سبتمبر سنة 1907 بمناسبة المولد السلطاني للعام الثامن والتسعين، وكان ذلك في عهد الوالي إبراهيم خليل باشا.، وتوقف العمل به في مايو 1964، بعد أن أصدرت الحكومة قرارها بذلك، وسيّرت الحافلات بدلا منه، بعد أن درّبت سائقي الترامواي على قيادة السيارات الجديدة.\n\nالمواصلات البحرية\nإن مرفأ بيروت هو أكبر مرافئ لبنان وأحد أهم المرافئ الواقعة شرق البحر المتوسط، وهو فضلا عن استقباله المراكب والسفن التجارية، يستقبل العبّارات التي يمكن الانتقال فيها من وإلى قبرص والمرافئ اللبنانية الأخرى بالإضافة للمرافئ السورية والمصرية وغيرها من المرافئ المجاورة.\n\nالمواصلات الجويّة\nيقع مطار بيروت رفيق الحريري الدولي في الضاحية الجنوبية للمدينة، ويتصل بوسط العاصمة عبر طريق المطار. وقد تم افتتاحه سنة 1954، وفي هذه الفترة كان يُعرف بمطار بيروت الدولي، وقد تعرض المطار على مر السنين لعدد من العوائق كان أبرزها الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية التي أوقفت جميع عمليات السفر تقريبا وأدت لتدمير منشآته وتوقفه عن العمل، وبعد انتهاء الحرب قام رئيس الوزراء آنذاك، رفيق الحريري بإعادة بنائه، وبعد استشهاد الأخير سُمي المطار على اسمه. يتعامل المطار مع 47 شركة طيران عربية وعالمية و8 شركات شحن جوي.\n\nالثقافة\nتعتبر ثقافة بيروت الحالية مزيجا من ثقافات متنوعة ومتعددة لمختلف الشعوب والحضارات التي مرّت على المدينة، بما فيها اليونانيون والرومان (ثقافة حوض البحر المتوسط)، العرب والأتراك (ثقافة عربية إسلامية)، والفرنسيون (ثقافة أوروبية). يُعتقد أن مدرسة الحقوق التي أنشأت في المدينة أيام الإمبراطورية الرومانية كانت أول مدرسة قانون في العالم. إن تاريخ الكوسموبوليتية هذا يعد مصدر فخر للبنانيين عموما والبيروتيين خصوصا.\nاستضافت بيروت قمة الفرانكوفونية وجامعة الدول العربية سنة 2002، وحفل تقديم جائزة ألبير لوندر، الذي يقدم جوائز للصحافيين الفرانكوفونيين المميزين كل سنة. استضافت المدينة أيضا الألعاب الفرانكوفونية في عام 2009. تعتبر بيروت عاصمة الكتاب العالمية للأمم المتحدة لسنة 2009، تقديرا لغناها الثقافي.\n\nاللكنة\nاللكنة البيروتية هي إحدى فروع اللهجة اللبنانية. وهي لكنة عربية أصيلة ما تزال ملامحها وصفاتها متجذرة حتى اليوم في المجتمع البيروتي، ويُلاحظ أن اللهجات المغاربية تبرز بين الحين والآخر في اللكنة البيروتية لا سيما اللهجة التونسية، ولهجة الشلوح سكان بلاد السوس وجبال الأطلس في المغرب الأقصى، ولهجة تمازرت وهي لهجة سكان الأطلس المتوسط، واللهجة الزناتية لهجة سكان الريف في الشمال، فضلاً عن لهجات الجزائر وليبيا. علمًا أن الكثير من ملامح اللكنة البيروتية بدأت تزول بسبب «التفرنج» في الكلام، ومع اقتحام العادات والتقاليد الغربية المنازل والشوارع والأسواق والمدارس والجامعات، وأجهزة الإعلام المتنوعة. ومن سمات لهجة العائلات البيروتية على سبيل المثال: تحويل السين صادًا، مثل: البسطة == البصطة، وتحويل الجيم إلى شين، مثال ذلك: الحرج = الحرش، اجتماع == اشتماع. فضلاً على أن اللهجة الخليجية التي انتقلت مع الفتوحات الإسلامية إلى المغرب العربي ثم ارتدت مجددًا إلى المشرق تظهر واضحة في أسماء بعض العائلات، مثل: بعيون؛ أي: أبو العيون، من با عيون.\n\nالمتاحف\nيعتبر متحف بيروت الوطني المتحف الأساسي للأثار في لبنان، وهو يحوي قرابة 1300 قطعة حرفية أثريّة يتراوح تأريخها من فترة عصور ما قبل التاريخ وصولا إلى العهد المملوكي في العصور الوسطى. وبالإضافة للمتحف الوطني، يعتبر متحف الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت للأثار ثالث أقدم متحف في الشرق الأوسط، وهو يعرض مجموعة كبيرة من الحرفيات التي عُثر عليها في لبنان وبعض الدول المجاورة.\nكذلك يوجد متحف سرسق أو قصر سرسق الذي يحوي اليوم أكثر الأعمال الفنية شهرة في بيروت، وهي تتمثل في مجموعة من المنحوتات اليابانية وعدّة أعمال فنية إسلامية، كما ويستضيف هذا المتحف معارض مؤقتة خلال السنة. وبالقرب من السراي الكبير يقع متحف روبير معوّض الخاص الذي تُعرض فيه المجموعة الخاصة بهاوي الفن والسياسي اللبناني هنري فرعون، من تحف وقطع أثرية. كما ويوجد متحف علمي خاص بالأطفال هو «بلانت ديسكفري» (كوكب الاكتشاف)، وفيه عدد من المعارض والتجارب والحرفيات، ويؤمن الإرشادات والتعليمات المناسبة لتثقيف الأولاد.\n\nالإعلام\nإن بيروت هي المركز الأساسي في لبنان لشركات التلفزة، والمطبوعات الصحفية، ودور نشر الكتب. تشمل القنوات التلفزيونية في المدينة: تلفزيون لبنان، المؤسسة اللبنانية للإرسال، تلفزيون المستقبل، قناة MTV، قناة الجديد، قناة المنار، قناة ANB، وقناة NBN. أما الصحف فتشمل: جريدة النهار، السفير، المستقبل، الأخبار، جريدة البلد، الديار، الأنوار، الشرق، صحيفة L'Orient Le Jour الفرنسية، وصحيفة Daily Star الإنكليزية. تعتبر بيروت أيضا إحدى محوريّ الإعلام الرئيسيين في العالم العربي، والثانية هي مصر.\n\nالرياضة\nاستضافت بيروت، إلى جانب طرابلس وصيدا، كأس آسيا في كرة القدم لسنة 2000. هناك ملعبين أساسيين لكرة القدم في المدينة وهما: ملعب المدينة الرياضية، وملعب بيروت البلدي. تتخذ 8 فرق كرة قدم من الدوري اللبناني بيروت مركزا لنواديها، وهي: نادي النجمة اللبناني، نادي الأنصار، الحكمة، العهد، المبرّة، الصفاء، الراسينغ بيروت، وشباب الساحل. بالإضافة لذلك هناك فرقيّ كرة سلة من بيروت، نادي الرياضي، ونادي الحكمة، الذان يُشاركان دوما في الدوري اللبناني لكرة السلة والبطولات العربية والإقليمية.\nتقام في بيروت أيضا أعداد أخرى من الأنشطة الرياضية، منها ماراثون بيروت السنوي، الكرة الطائرة، سباق خيل أسبوعي في ميدان سباق المدينة، بالإضافة لدورات غولف وكرة المضرب تقام في نادي الغولف في بيروت. ومؤخرا أنشأ دوري للرغبي في لبنان، واتخذت 3 فرق من أصل 5 بيروت مقرا لنواديها، وهي: AUB Wolves (ذئاب الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت)، LAU Immortals (خالدوا الجامعة اللبنانية الأميركية)، وUSJ Saints (قديسي جامعة القديس يوسف). تعتبر بيروت مرشحة محتملة لاستضافة الألعاب الأولمبية الصيفية لسنة 2024، ومن المتوقع أن مشروع صنين الضخم، البالغة تكلفته 1.2 مليار دولار أمريكي، سيجعل لبنان قادرا على استضافة هذه الألعاب.\n\nالموضة والفنون\nهناك المئات من المعارض الفنيّة عبر العاصمة بيروت وضواحيها. يعتبر الكثير من اللبنانيين مهتمّا بالفن وإنتاجه، فهناك قرابة 5000 فنان ينتج الفنون الجميلة، وعدد مماثل لهم يعملون في مجال الموسيقى، التصميم، الهندسة، المسرح، الأفلام، التصوير، وغيرها من أشكال الفنون. يتخرّج كل سنة المئات من الطلاب في كليات الفنون التصويرية وتصميم الأشكال من مختلف الجامعات في المدينة، وأخذت ورشات العمل الفنية تزدهر وتنتشر في جميع أنحاء لبنان، وفي بيروت خصوصا، حيث أصبح المشهد الفني غنيّا ومتنوعا للغاية.\nبالإضافة لهذا تنتشر معارض الأزياء والموضة بشكل كبير عبر أنحاء المدينة، وهناك دوما معارض ووكالات أزياء جديدة لمصممين عالميين تُفتتح وتعرض أعمالها عبر برامج أزياء مختلفة أبرزها قناة الموضة العربية الفضائية (بالإنجليزية: Fashion TV Arabia). ومن وكالات الأزياء المشهورة في بيروت: «جورجيوس ايجنسي» لصاحبها جورج كعدي، ستايل موديلينغ لصاحبها إيلي نحّاس، و«ناتاليز ايجنسي» لناتالي فضل الله. افتتح العديد من المصممين العالميين معارض لهم في بيروت مثل فيرساتشي وغوسي، كما ويعيش الكثير من هؤلاء المصممين بداخل المدينة وحولها مثل إيلي صعب، المصمم العالمي للأزياء النسائية. يشتهر الأخير بتصميمه لملابس لفنانات مشهورات مثل بيونسيه، جوينيث بالترو، وميشا بارتون، وهو يتبرّع سنويّا بشجرة ميلاد لتوضع في وسط بيروت التجاري. ومن المصممين المشاهير الذين يسكنون بيروت أيضا، زهير مراد، الذي صمم ملابس لفنانات مثل آنا أورتيز، وكريستينا أبلغيت، وهو يمتلك مشغلا ومعرضا خاصا به كذلك الأمر.\n\nالسياحة\nكانت السياحة في بيروت مزدهرة بشكل كبير إلى أن اندلعت الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية، حيث توقفت السياحة الترفيهية تماما، حتى وضعت الحرب أوزارها، فأعادت شركة سوليدير إعمار وسط المدينة المدمر الذي عاد وأصبح اليوم ينبض بالحياة كما كان سابقا، وبالتالي عادت سمعة المدينة كصلة وصل بين القارات الثلاثة، أوروبا وأفريقيا وآسيا، وكبوابة الشرق على الغرب. كان يُطلق على بيروت اسم «باريس الشرق» في أيام ازدهارها الأولى بعد الاستقلال، ولا يزال البعض يلقبها بهذا اللقب اليوم، ويعود ذلك إلى النمط العمراني، المعالم الأثرية، الأسواق، المطبخ البلدي، والحياة الليلية، التي بُشبهها البعض بتلك الموجودة في فرنسا، والتي من شأنها إبقاء السائح مهتما بالمدينة أثناء زيارته للبنان.\n\nومن أهم فنادق بيروت: فندق ألبيرغو، فندق بيل فيو هوتيل، فندق السفير، فندق ومنتجع الموفمبيك، الانتركونتيننتال فينيسيا، فندق الكومودور، الهوليداي إنّ ديونز، الميتروبوليتان بالاس، وغيرها.\nحصلت بيروت على المركز التاسع في قائمة أفضل المدن لمجلة السياحة والترفيه (بالإنجليزية: Travel and Leisure) لسنة 2006، حيث أتت في مرتبة متأخرة عن نيويورك ومتقدمة عن سان فرانسيسكو، إلا أن قائمة المدن هذه كان قد تمّ وضعها والتصويت عليها قبل العدوان الإسرائيلي على لبنان في نفس السنة. وبعد أن عادت الأمور لطبيعتها، عادت أعداد السياح لترتفع مجدداً بشكل ملحوظ. ومؤخرا قام دليل «لونلي بلانت» السياحي بتسمية بيروت المدينة الأكثر حيوية على سطح الأرض لسنة 2009، كما قامت النيويورك تايمز بمنح المدينة المركز الأول ضمن قائمة الأماكن الأربع والأربعين التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنة 2009. وقد زار لبنان في سنة 2009 حوالي 2.000.000 سائح عربي وأجنبي.\n\nأعلام بيروت\nخرج من

      "summary": "بَيْرُوت هي العاصمة السياسية للجمهورية اللبنانية وأكبر مدنها. يتعدى عدد سكانها المليوني نسمة بحسب أحد إحصائيات سنة 2007. تقع وسط الخط الساحلي اللبناني شرقي البحر الأبيض المتوسط. تتركَز فيها معظم المرافق الحيوية من صناعة وتجارة وخدمات. وهي مدينة قديمة وعريقة إذ ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنة والمؤرخة إلى القرن الخامس عشر ما قبل الميلاد وهي مأهولة منذ ذلك الحين.\nبيروت هي مركز الثقل السياسي اللبناني حيث مقر معظم الدوائر السياسية مثل البرلمان ورئاسة الحكومة بالإضافة لمراكز معظم الوزارات والدوائر الحكومية. تلعب الدور الرئيسي في الحركة الاقتصادية اللبنانية. وتعد المدينة إحدى أهم المؤثرات الثقافية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط والوطن العربي لغناها بالأنشطة الثقافية مثل الصحافة الحرة والمسارح ودور النشر ومعارض الفنون والمتاحف وعدد كبير من الجامعات الدولية.\nمرت المدينة بالعديد من الكوارث من زلازل وحروب على مر التاريخ كان أهمها الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية المدمرة. وبعد انتهاء الحرب سنة 1990، أعادت الدولة في عهد حكومة رئيس وزراء لبنان آنذاك رفيق الحريري إعمار وتأهيل المدينة وبخاصة وسطها التجاري وواجهتها البحرية وملاهيها الليلية مما أعاد تألق سياحتها وجعلها مقصداً سياحياً جذاباً. قامت صحيفة النيويورك تايمز بمنح بيروت المركز الأول بين قائمة الأماكن التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنة 2009، كما صُنّفت ضمن المدن العشرة الأوائل الأكثر حيوية في عام 2009 بواسطة دليل لونلي بلانت السياحي. وفي عام 2020، مرّت بيروت بكارثة أُخرى حيث حصلَ انفجار ضخم في مرفأ المدينة مما خلف عشرات القتلى وآلاف الجرحى وتسبب بدمار كبير في عدد من أحيائها نتج عنه نزوح 300 ألف مواطن لبناني.\nكشف مؤشر «ماستر كارد» لعام 2011، أن بيروت استأثرت بالمركز الثاني من حيث نسبة البذخ السياحي بين جميع مدن الشرق الأوسط وأفريقيا. أما المركز الأول فاحتلته دبي، التي بلغ مقدار ما صرفه فيها السوّاح حوالي 7.8 مليار دولار، تليها بيروت مباشرة بحوالي 6.5 مليارات دولار، ثم تل أبيب بحوالي 3.8 مليارات، ثم القاهرة (3.7 مليارات دولار)، فجوهانسبرغ (3.3 مليارات دولار). كذلك وُضعت بيروت في المرتبة التاسعة بين قائمة أكثر المدن زيارةً في العالم.",

      "content": "## Overview\nBeirut (Arabic: بيروت‎ Bayrūt, French: Beyrouth) is the capital city of Lebanon with a population of approximately 2.1 million people in its metropolitan area. The city is on a relatively small headland jutting into the east Mediterranean. It is by far the biggest city in Lebanon. Due to Lebanon's small size, the capital has always held the status as the only true cosmopolitan city in the country, and since independence, has been the commercial and financial hub of Lebanon.\n\n## Districts\nBeirut is composed by many different neighbourhoods, each own having its own distinctive atmosphere and character. The city sprawls over a peninsula with the sea to the north and the west, and the Mount Lebanon ridge to the east.\nDamascus Road, which connects the centre with the National Museum, was known as the \"Green Line\" during the civil war era (1975–1990). At that time, it separated the mostly Muslim western sector of the city and the Christian eastern sector. Martyrs' Square and the post-war development of Beirut Central District (BCD) are the geographical pivot of the city and serve quite well for orientation.\n\n## History\nBeirut has survived a rough history, falling under the occupation of one empire after another. Originally named Bêrūt, \"The Wells\" by the Phoenicians, Beirut's history goes back more than 5000 years. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Arab and Ottoman civilizations.\nFollowing World War II, Lebanon gained its independence from France and Beirut became its capital in 1943; Bechara El-Khoury and Riad El-Solh, Lebanon's first president and prime minister respectively, are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and national heroes. Beirut thrived as a major commercial and tourist centre of the Middle East. It was a top destination among wealthy Arabs and European tourists, due to Beirut's unique geography, climate, diverse culture, and freedom. Beirut was seen as the \"European gateway to the Middle East\" and vice versa, and was often called the \"Paris of the Middle East\".\nBeirut is home to more than 10 recognized religious sects. Religious tension between the Christian and Muslim factions sparked a brutal civil war in 1975. The conflict lasted nearly a decade and a half, ravaging the city. The central area of the city, previously the focus of much of the commercial and cultural activities, became a no-man's land. Throughout the war, the city was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east, and tensions between different sects remain to this day.\nSince the end of the war in 1989, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut. The city has undertaken an aggressive rebuilding policy. The city is working hard to regain its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East which it has lost to Cairo as well as a centre for commerce, fashion and media which is dominated by Dubai and other rich Gulf states. However Beirut with the rest of the Middle East has gained momentum.\n\n## People\nSome areas of Beirut have a friendly atmosphere, and some Beirutis have a reputation for being very sociable and outgoing. The locals are used to the sight of foreigners and would be happy to show you around the city, if you ask them.\nSectarianism is still prevalent in Lebanon, as a result of the French colonial legacy of divide and rule, which leads some Christian Lebanese to identify culturally with Europeans, particularly the French, and some denying Arab identity altogether; preferring to identify themselves as Phoenician (referring to their ancestral roots in ancient Phoenicia.)  Many Muslim Lebanese identify culturally and ethnically with other Arabs and Muslims of the Middle East.\nIt is helpful to display some basic courtesies. A simple Bonjour when entering a cafe or shop can work wonders, and might even get you a special rate, or when hopping into a taxi, might just keep the driver from overcharging you. Say Merci when given or offered something, and if you'd rather not accept, then say La'a merci and smile; otherwise you might be taken as rude, even though you're not.\nMost Beirutis love going out. If (and when) you go out at night, depending on the venue, dressing up well will most certainly get you some respect. The locals like to see that foreigners are doing what they can to fit in. Expect to be offered a drink or a cigarette. Alcohol is very cheap in shops and supermarkets, yet in night venues, prices can rise up to European standards (e.g. LL8,000/beer, LL15,000/cocktail))\nSmoking is very common in Beirut, a large portion of the people smoke both outdoors and indoors. However, most restaurants and bars now abide by the law forbidding smoking indoors.\n\n## Climate\nBeirut enjoys a Mediterranean climate. Come in April to June for warm, dry days and long, cool evenings (19–25 °C). Temperatures in July and August rise to around 30 °C (86 °F) and humidity can be somewhat overwhelming – make sure your hotel has air conditioning. The wettest months are December to February so bring a good coat, rain boots, and umbrella because the rain often comes in torrential downpours. Streets have poor drainage and can quickly turn into rivers, so waterproof boots are highly recommended for the rainy season. Lebanon's ski season runs from December till early April.\nDespite the diverse climate that changes noticeably per season, the weather is very predictable; the weather forecasts on radio and TV stations are normally very accurate, so you can easily avoid finding yourself caught in a surprising downpour in the winter months.\n\n## Public holidays\nDue to Lebanon's diverse religions and sects, many public holidays are celebrated, some of which more than once:\nNew Year's Day, Epiphany and Armenian Christmas (6 Jan)\nEid al-Adha – Feast of Sacrifice, celebrating the last day of Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca\nAl Hijrah – Islamic New Year, Feast of St Maroun (9 Feb)\nMwalid Al Nabawai – Prophet's Anniversary, Good Friday and Easter Monday (Apr)\nLabor Day (1 May)\nLiberation of the South (25 May)\nAssumption (15 Aug)\nEid al-Fitr – Festival of the Breaking of the Fast\nAll Saints' Day (1 Nov)\nIndependence Day (22 Nov)\nChristmas Day (25 Dec)\nBased on the lunar calendar, Islamic holidays move forward approximately 11 days every Western year.\n\n## Dress\nAnything goes in Beirut. Shorts and T-shirts are perfect for the summer heat, for both men and women, while heavier clothing is necessary during the winter.\nYou should cover up if visiting religious sites, such as mosques and churches. Some neighbourhoods are more conservative than others, so bear that in mind when exploring the city. Going out at night is a smart affair, so dress fashionably to fit in, although this does not mean dressing up in a suit; you will find many men in sporty T-shirts, dark jeans, and smart running shoes at even the trendiest nightclubs.\n\n## Talk\nBeirut is very culturally diverse, and thus, multilingual. Lebanese Arabic is the native language, but everyone speaks Standard Arabic, the official language, while English and French (especially the former) are also spoken by most people.\nShop signs are in both Standard Arabic, English and French. Most restaurant menus, event listings, and such are also in English alongside Standard Arabic and sometimes in French. Road signs, however, are in Standard Arabic and French.\n\n## By plane\n33.82111135.4883331 Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY  IATA) (is located 7 km south of Beirut, and is roughly a 10- to 15-minute drive from the city center). Is the country's only international airport and the hub of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines (MEA). Most international airlines have daily flights between Beirut and the major European capitals.\nCar parking is available at the airport for around US$2.5 per hour. The parking time is rounded to the upper hour (i.e. 1.1 hours is rounded up to 2 hours).\nThere are regular public minivans (usually every five-ten minutes) that go to the Downtown area and to the Charles Helou Station from the airport. They are run by private individuals but are distinguished from normal vehicles by a red number plate (indicating that it is a public transport vehicle). There is no set bus stand outside the terminal, but it is outside the departures terminal upstairs. Rides cost $1 or LL1,500 (lira). Both currencies are accepted. Wait outside the terminal and flag the vans down, as they may not stop. You pay when you leave. Tell the driver where you are going before entering and they will say yes or no.\nThey are plentiful and comfortable taxis that are authorized by the airport are parked next to the terminal in the arrivals level and have an airport logo on the side (official airport taxi fares[dead link]). Although these taxis claim to be regulated by the airport authorities, they are definitely not honest in their rates.\nThey are also available and are located a little farther from the airport, but these are not guaranteed and are to be used at your own risk. The approximate rate Airport–Hamra street is LL25,000. However, the so-called regulated taxis' drivers, will ask you anywhere between US$30 to 50 for any downtown locations. So, start bargaining from $10 and stop at $15 as the upper limit, both ways to and from the Airport. Uber works in Lebanon, and as of February 2016 they had a $14 fixed rate to/from the airport. Considering this is only a 7 km long drive, and gas price is approx $1.5/litre in Beirut, this price is definitely a rip off that taxi drivers would not miss. Taxi types are wildly changing, so pick the best and newest looking ones to guarantee airconditioning, and collision safety.\nAll major car rental companies have booking offices inside the airport.\nMore information can be obtained through the airport's webpage on the topic[dead link].\n\n## By car\nDriving in Beirut is not to be recommended for much of the day, particularly in the city centre. Traffic is heavy, and impossible during rush hour. Walking around the city is much more of an experience, and is in fact necessary in the very centre since that part of the city is a pedestrian area.\nIt can be difficult to find parking other than in multi-story and off-street car parks. On-street parking, if you are lucky enough to find one, is allowed for a short time of two hours. Tickets must be purchased through the parking meters usually located at either end of a street. They can be paid by either cash or card. Overstaying your time may get you a ticket. Enforcement of the parking limit isn't done very efficiently, but obviously the last thing anyone would want to find is a ticket that will ruin their day and set them back financially.\nRenting a car is recommended if you're planning to visit neighbouring towns and cities, or if you're planning to go out late at night when public transport isn't operating. Car rental prices range from economical LL40,000/day to luxury prices. Those can change according to season, so make sure you contact the car rental company beforehand to check prices as well as pickup/drop-off locations.\nIf you are travelling to the country during high season make sure to book your car rental in advance since it is normal to find that all rental companies are completely booked.\nDriving in Beirut is on the right-hand side of the road. Driving can be hazardous because of crowded grid, lack of proper signing, and aggressive driving style. Only the central areas of Beirut have traffic lights operating, though plans have been made to cover all of the city.\n\n## By bus\nThere are two public transport companies. The OCFTC that operates a fleet of blue and white city-buses, and the LCC with a fleet of red and white minibuses; Bus fares cost either LL500 (OCFTC bus 24) or LL1000. The service is very efficient and the buses come very often, to get onto a bus you must stand at the side of the road and signal with your hand as a bus approaches; the buses will stop anywhere.\n\n## By taxi\nThere are two types of taxis in Beirut; the old (often) battered hail-taxis, and the prebooking taxis.\nHail-taxi — The most convenient form of transport in Beirut, as they are absolutely everywhere. Those taxis are predominantly Mercedes Benz cars (though due to increasing petrol prices, taxi drivers are opting for more economic forms or transport) and can be quite easily identified by their yellow illuminated taxi sign on the roof and red number plate. Fixed meters aren't provided so it is recommended to ask how much your trip will cost before hopping in. The fare will be charged per destination and not per distance travelled (which is an advantage since traffic is a big problem in the city). A typical journey from one side of Beirut to the other (roughly 3 km) may cost LL10 000. Many taxi drivers speak at least a few words of English and French. Knowing the name of your destination in the local language may solve any misunderstanding.\nPrebook taxi — These require that you call them and book a ride, they generally cost more but are much more luxurious and are normally air conditioned. All hotels should provide you with a taxi directory, if you wish to use this type of service. Taxi prices are considered cheap if compared to US and European taxis. Major taxi companies are: Geryes Taxi (+961 1-332747), Taxi Premiere (Tel 1260 or +961 1-389222). Allo Taxi (Tel 1213 or +961 1-366661),\nKeep in mind the names of the landmarks around the city, as they will come in handy when travelling by public transport (some drivers aren't that good at orienting!).\n\n## By service\nThe more common form of transport, especially with daily commuters, as they are cheaper than the taxis, but ironically, are in fact the same. Service [ser-vee-s] are shared-taxis, the same taxis as above but shared between four or more people. The biggest advantage with the Service system is that the price of the ride is fixed at 2,000 L.L (€1). They come with drawbacks of course, and apart from having to share a small car with three other complete strangers (great for meeting new people actually), Service drivers may choose not to take you if you are not going in the same direction as them.\nHailing a service or taxi usually entails yelling your destination to the driver if he slows down, then chasing the name of your destination with either 'taxi' (for private taxi LL10,000 should you want one.)\nIt is important to remember that if you want a service, give the name of the general district you want and not a specific address. When you get close the driver will ask you where you want to get out. If you recognise the area you want to be in say just ask to stop. After you have paid you and the driver asks you, can give a more specific address like \"Crowne Plaza\" (a landmark on Hamra St.)and the driver will drop you as near to it as he is going, often pointing out where you have to walk to get there. When you get in to a service pay the LL2000 for each person right away. If you fail to do so, the driver will assume you asked for taxi, and will overcharge you at taxi-rate when you want to get out. However if the driver stops to ask for other fares or picks up another passenger only pay the Service rate of LL2,000.\nTaxi drivers in Beirut are notorious for overcharging tourists much more so than neighbouring Syria.  Most will demand absurd fares and demanding 2-3 times the service rate is very common.  If you're pressed for time paying 2 service may be a compromise (LL4000), otherwise you may have to wait a bit to find an honest cab driver willing to take you for LL2000.  Always get a price before leaving otherwise the driver will most definitely rip you off. Also, virtually no one tips cab drivers unless some extraordinary service has been rendered, like a very long wait time while you run an errand or something. Some drivers will ask you for a tip particularly near holidays. Payment is usually at the end of the journey.\n\n## By foot\nAs the city is quite compact, walking is the best way of getting around, and perfect for getting off the beaten track to find unexpected surprises. Most people however will not walk throughout the city, rather they will walk within certain districts and take cars/taxis to get from one district to another. Streets are generally well signposted, but few Beiruti locals would know how to navigate according to their names, directions are usually given by building placement (\"straight down the road until you reach building X, turn left there, then right...\"), and many streets have local nicknames that wouldn't match the map. That said, if you find yourself lost in the streets, simply ask any passer-by for directions; no one will refuse to help! Otherwise you can stop at the nearest hotel or shop and ask. Hotel concierges and shop keepers will most definitely speak some limited English.\nSome roads in Beirut are in poor condition. Not so much in the centre, but the farther you get from downtown the more road works you will most probably find. So take care!\nYou can always check out a Beiruti-run walking tour called Walk Beirut. They offer weekly tours around the city.\n\n## By bicycle\nRoad blocks make cycling relatively safe the rest of the time as the result of reduced traffic.\n\n## See\nBeirut was once the self-proclaimed \"Paris of the Middle East\". It still has an outdoor cafe culture,  and European architecture can be found everywhere. Many Beirutis (as well as other Lebanese) speak French, English or both, to varying degrees, along with Arabic.\nEach district has its own sights and places to visit. The following listings are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Beirut. The complete listings are found on each individual district page.\n\n## Landmarks\nPigeon Rocks (Rawcheh District) A monumental natural arch jutting up from the Mediterranean. Great place to sit at one of the roadside cafes and watch the sun set.\nPlace de l'Etoile (Nejmeh Square)(Downtown District), built by the French in the early 20th century in the very centre of the Downtown district, it suffered a lot of war damage during the war but has been restored.

Check the different districts to find out what each has to offer. Meanwhile, here are a few highlights:\nBet on an Arabian thoroughbred every Sunday in the Beirut Hippodrome, officially called Hippodrome Du Parc De Beyrouth[dead link]. The hippodrome is home to popular horse races, attracting a dedicated betting crowd (often old taxi drivers). Foreigners should join the fun in the afternoon for free entrance (ID or passport required). Open on Sundays only.\nSoak up the sun in one of the beach clubs on the Beirut coast. Very few actually have sandy beaches, and most unfortunately have been converted into spas with swimming pools and paved terraces, but despite all that, they all have access to the sea. A few of them are completely private and members-only, but can be accessed by paying for a guest ticket if going in with a member. The Saint George Yacht club in Ain El Mreisseh and the Riviera Beach and Yacht Club at the Riviera Hotel are two such popular clubs, where access to the beach club for non-members is US$20 per day. You can chill in one of the pools or have a drink at the bars and cafes while listening to music in the afternoons. Long Beach Club is another good place. The entrance is just to the left of the Ferris wheel on the Corniche right before the hill. Bring a beach towel.\n33.878635.48011 Ramlet Al-Baida, ☏ +961 71 799 869. There is one at least one public beach though, right here. Lots of sand and pounding waves but sadly trash and pollution, maybe even some sewage releases into the water, too. Uff, at least you can watch the surf and sunset anyway. It is said to be a bit of a gay cruising spot too.    (updated Sep 2020)\nTest your golfing skills at  The Golf Club of Lebanon (18 hole), Ouzai - Beer Hassan (next to Henry chehab barrack), ☏ +961 1 826335-6-7, fax: +961 1 822474, info@golfcluboflebanon.com.\nTake a ride on the  Beirut Balloon (30 passenger helium filled balloon, offering breathtaking views from an altitude of 300 m), Allenby St., Downtown Beirut (Entrance is through Biel Convention Centre. Look for it in the sky!), ☏ +961 1 985901. 10AM-10PM.\nWalk, jog, skate, cycle, stroll (or whatever you consider exercise) along Paris Avenue which links up to General De Gaulle Avenue (both locally known simply as the corniche) which stretch around the entire Central Beirut perimeter (approx. 5 km). Start the walk, jog, skate etc... at the Beirut marina (Downtown Beirut District) about an hour or so before sunset and finish at the Pigeon Rocks in Rawcheh, in time to watch the sun go down while sipping on a drink at one of the outdoor cafés.\nScuba Dive:, With 300 sunny days a year, 36 shipwrecks, impressive walls, canyons, caves, Ray habitats and shark habitats, Beirut definitely has something to offer for a serious scuba diver. The French WWII submarine Le Souffleur, the British freighter Alice B which sank during the civil war in the 1980s, The Macedonia freighter which sank in 1962 and the National Star freighter in 1991, the Mediterranean flagship of Admiral Sir George Tryon HMS Victoria which sank in 1893, The British Lesbian which sank during WWII, make just a few of Beirut's shipwreck collection. Historical cities dot ancient Phoenicia's shore, providing us today with many interesting submerged historical sites, some littered with Phoenician and Roman marble stones, granite columns, pathways, old stone anchors, amphorae and bits of pottery.

Promoting traditional methods of farming and preserving, it's a great place to pick up local honey, cheese and breads, plus artisans' crafts. It also runs regular cookery classes, to learn how to make that perfect tabouleh (bulgur salad).\nSunday Market Get up early and join the locals for a rummage at the Sunday Market which is open 7AM-1PM, next to Beirut River in the east. You might find antique jewellery, clothing and beads, or maybe just bric-à-brac, but there's an eclectic selection of goodies on show.

Payment and change for transactions may be given as a combination of the two. The exchange rate is fixed at LL91,000 to US$1 (as of 2024). Beware of exchange money in Lebanon in 2024, if you exchange money in the bank they will still use the old rate which is one tenth the real rate due to inflation, so don't exchange money in the bank.\nPayment cards: Many shops, hotels, restaurants, bars, etc., accept international payment cards such as Visa, MasterCard, Maestro or American Express.\nAutomatic bank tellers: Withdrawal can be made from any automatic bank teller found in any region of the country. Withdrawals can be made in either Lebanese lira or the US dollar.\nTraveler's checks: Lebanese banks can exchange them very easily.\n\n## Lebanese cuisine\nLebanese cuisine is a mix of Arab, Turkish and Mediterranean influences, and enjoys a worldwide reputation for its richness and variety as well as its Mediterranean health factor. Olive oil, herbs, spices, fresh fruits and vegetables are commonly used, as well as dairy products, cereals, fishes and various types of meat. A visit to Beirut includes the traditional Lebanese Mezze (Meza), an elaborate variety of thirty hot and cold dishes. A typical Mezze may consist of salads such as the Tabboule and Fattouch, together with the caviars: Hommos and Moutabal, and some patties such as the Sambousseks and finally, the stuffed grape leaves, with of course the Lebanese flat pita bread which is essential to every Lebanese Mezze.\nMankoushé/Manakish: a Lebanese pizza, or at least that's what it looks like, the Mankoushé is a baked pizza-shaped dough with either a mixture of thyme (called za'atar) or local cheeses (or a mixture of both) on top, can be bought from all bakeries as well as special Forn Mankhoushé which specialize in this type of food, usually had for breakfast. cost between LL1,000 and LL3,000.\nKa'ek: a different version of bagels, about 30 cm in diameter and hollow, normally filled with thyme but you can ask for cheese spread as well. Commonly purchased from street vendors that ride bicycles or motorized scooters and honk a manual horn, but you can also find it at major bakeries. Although not of Lebanese origins, they're quite popular and are always found near Rawcheh area, they're worth a try. Cost about LL1,000.\nRoastery Nuts: roasted nuts are them local favourite appetizers particularly with the older people. Local brands have dedicated roasteries where customers walk in and order fresh, they produce some of the best nuts in the region, and certainly the most varied. Pecans, cashews, macadamias, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, peanuts. Ask for Krikri in thyme, spice, or cheese flavour.\nSweets: every religious or national event sees stalls set up on pavements outside churches and in public squares, where traditional Lebanese sweets are sold such as: Maamoul, Ktaef, Halawet el Jibn, Halawet el Riz, and Ashta. If you're lucky enough to come across those be sure to give them all a try, otherwise visit any påtisserie  where the same sweets can be purchased.\n\n## International cuisine\nBeirut's different cultures brought different tastes for food, and restaurants of all different origins have opened all around the city. Restaurants have different price ranges, depending of course on the quality of the ingredients used; check the different districts for the listings.\n\n## Fast food\nIf you're on a tight budget, or if you simply miss the food that you can get back at home, fast food is your best option. All major international fast food restaurants have opened chains in Beirut (KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, Hardee's, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway), but many local fast food restaurants have sprung up to compete with the major franchisers.\n\n## Drink\nNightlife: Alcohol is readily available in Beirut. Many of Beirut's districts have their own fair number of cafes, bars, and clubs, although many areas are \"dry\" or, while serving alcohol, do not have a vibrant nightlife. This said, two of the hotter nightspots, with the highest concentration of pubs and nightclubs, are Gemmayze (mostly pubs) and Monot St (mix of nightclubs and pubs), both located within close range in the Ashrafieh district. Hamra is also seeing a revival in its nightlife, with over a dozen new pubs and bars open there now. The best way to find out what's in and what's not is by checking the local press or simply going there and seeing for yourself. There is no curfew in Beirut, thought expect most pubs and bars to empty by 2AM, and most nightclubs to empty between 4AM and 4:40AM.\nDuring the summer, Monot tends to be much less busy, as many open-air clubs outside of the area tend to dominate the nightlife in Beirut. Gemmayzeh remains popular year-round.\nSkyBar in Biel, next to downtown, is an open-air nightclub. It may be the hottest nightclub in Beirut, and has a view overlooking the Sea. It is closed during the winter months.\nIris. A rooftop bar on top of the an-Nahar newspaper building, with an outdoor area overlooking the sea, downtown, and the mountains.\nLocally brewed beer include Almaza and Laziza (non-alcoholic). There is also a microbrewery that started producing several styles of more flavorful beer in 2006, called \"961 Beer\"[dead link]. \"LB Beer\", which is brewed without the use of any corn or rice. it has gained a large following by the younger, independent minded crowd and is a regular staple at locally organized parties. All are worth a try when visiting.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are lots of hotels in Beirut's metropolitan area, ranging from cheap hostels to luxury suite hotels. Prices and quality vary across the spectrum, but if you look well enough, there's bound to be the perfect hotel inside whatever budget you set. Check the different districts to find places to sleep.\n\n## Stay safe\nPhotography of military personnel and installations is prohibited. You should also be careful in taking photographs in the Dahiyeh (the southern suburbs), if you don't want to get in contact with Hezbollah. The safest thing is to ask an official nearby for permission, although your request will very likely be turned down. Keep your camera in a purse just for safety. If a Hezbollah official approaches you, seeing your camera, he can't know if you've been taking pictures before that. Should you be taken in for questioning (because of taking pictures), remain calm. It might take a long time getting out of it, but it's highly unlikely that things should escalate or turn ugly. Bottom line: consider not bringing your camera at all. A trip to Dahiyeh is way too interesting and different to be spent getting questioned by the authorities.\nAvoid any governmental or military convoys that may be passing by. Lebanese people have adapted to all those situations.\nPalestinian refugee camps in Beirut are approachable, but try to bring a local, who will be worth a lot when it comes to logistics and safety. Camps vary in size and appearance (the camps in Beirut are worse than some rural camps, which can resemble more open villages). Most refugees however are both civil and open in the encounter with foreigners. The key is of course openness on your part as well. Of course, Downtown Beirut will always be a more safe alternative, but for the most part you won't encounter any problems while in a refugee camp.\n\n## Cope\nBeirut sees no more criminal activity than any other major city, if not less. Be aware of pickpockets and scams involving overpricing. The last is mostly a problem concerning taxi drivers, so be sure always to agree on a price before setting off.\nIf you are unlucky enough to fall ill, head straight for the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), also known as AUH, (near the AUB campus) - you will need to pay around US$40 upfront (cash or major credit card) and be reimbursed later by your insurer.\nPharmacies in Lebanon are able to prescribe drugs on-the-spot. While this is likely to be a boon for a minority of travelers, it can leave you even more ill than when you came in to begin with. Don't chance it - see a doctor first.\nEscaping to the mountains near Beirut is a good option for those about to burn-out. Aley and Beit Mery are both near enough to the city (20–30 minutes) and are generally clean and green.\n\n## Embassies\nCzech Republic, St. Bechara Church Street, Baabda, ☏ +961 5 929 010, +961 3 332 291 (emergencies), fax: +961 5 922 120, beirut@embassy.mzv.cz.
