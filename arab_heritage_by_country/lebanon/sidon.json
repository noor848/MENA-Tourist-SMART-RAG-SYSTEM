      "content": "Sidon ( SY-dən), or Saida ( SY-də, SAH-id-ə; Arabic: صيدا, romanized: Ṣaydā), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located on the Mediterranean coast in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital. Tyre, to the south, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut, to the north, are each about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.\n\nEtymology\nThe Phoenician name Ṣīdūn (𐤑𐤃𐤍, ṢDN) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as ḏjdwnꜣ. It appears in Biblical Hebrew as Ṣīḏōn (Hebrew: צִידוֹן) and in Syriac as Ṣidon (ܨܝܕܘܢ). This was Hellenised as Sidṓn (Ancient Greek: Σιδών), which was Latinised as Sidon and entered English in this form. The name appears in Classical Arabic as Ṣaydūn (صَيْدونْ) and in Modern Arabic as Ṣaydā (صَيْدَا).\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon to honour its imperial sponsor.\nDuring the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as Sagittus and in Old French as Saete, Sayette or Sagette.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.\n\nHistory\nIn antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant Phoenician city. It was nestled on a mainland promontory and boasted two harbors. Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed Tyre to become the paramount city in Phoenicia. In the New Testament era, Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see Biblical Sidon below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nPrehistory\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nMiddle Bronze IIA\nIn late MB IIA, Sidon Level 4 became an important port trading with Egypt (late 12th and early 13th dynasties).\n\nLate Bronze\nLate Bronze II\nAmarna period. Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the Egyptian Empire and ruled by Zimredda of Sidon. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with Abimilku of Tyre in the south, and Rib-Hadda of Byblos in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the kingdom of Amurru with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I of Hatti. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.\nThe oldest testimony documenting words in the Phoenician language of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: \"the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion\". In other words: Mount Hermon was called \"Sirion\", in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.\n\nIron Age\nSidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia.\nDuring the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and purple dye production. The city's glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance. The magnitude of Sidon's purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded Murex trunculus shells discovered near the southern harbor. These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled ‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al, '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\nNebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Sidon's navy played a significant role in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city's coinage. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.\n\nPersian and Hellenistic periods\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic period of Sidon's history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. \nIn exchange for supporting his conquest of Egypt, King Cambyses II of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of Dor, Joppa, and the Plain of Sharon.\nUnder the Diadochi or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus (likely the tomb of King Abdalonymus rather than Alexander), the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\n\nRoman period\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The city was embellished by Herod, king of Judaea, who built there a theatre. By the First Jewish–Roman War, Sidon sheltered enough Jews that local pagans hesitated to attack them during the broader massacre of Jews in Greco-Syrian towns in 66 CE, as documented by Josephus.\nThe Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and an underground Mithraeum was discovered. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. The Philogelos, a Greek-language joke book written circa the 4th century AD, features a series of jokes about Sidonians, who are stereotyped as unintelligent and literal-minded. During the Byzantine Empire, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, the law school of Berytus took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636.\n\nCrusader-Ayyubid period\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\nDuring the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly Jewish families, in Sidon, which he described as a \"large city.\"\n\nOttoman period\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. In 1521, Moses Basola encountered twenty families of Musta'rabi Jews during his visit to Sidon.\nDuring the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.\nDuring the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon, like much of Ottoman Syria, was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named HMS Sidon.\nThe 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of Judean Jews. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as Maghrebi Jews, initially settled in the Chouf Mountains above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and Beirut amidst escalating Druze-Maronite tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new synagogue in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.\nFrom 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sidon was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.\n\nAfter World War I\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\nOn Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA's long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.\nOn 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed two teenage members of a SLA leader's family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60–80 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.\nOn 8 June 1999, two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon's main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on Osbat al-Ansar whose leader had been sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of the head of the Sufi Al-Ahbash movement and the attempted assassination of the mufti of Tripoli. He was believed to be in hiding in the Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp.\nStudies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and landscape\" sections below).\n\nSaida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\n\nPolitics\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).\nThe local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.\nThe El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014–2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.\nThe Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.\nMaarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.\n\nImpact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment\nAccording to a 2013 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\" In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\nThe former Makab (waste dump) and the treatment plant\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the Makab; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the Makab crisis—which has endangered residents' health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 92.99% and Christians made up 6.49% of registered voters in Sidon. 82.16% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 10.83% were Shiite Muslims.\nThe overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut, however by the end of 1990s most of the Jewish population had emigrated leaving their cemetery and other sites in a state of abandonment.\n\nMain sights\nSidon Sea Castle, a fortress built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon.\nSidon Soap Museum. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps.\nKhan al-Franj (\"Caravanserai of the French\"), a complex built in the 16th century, though erroneously credited to Emir Fakhreddine II in the 17th century. It gained its name for accommodating French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries.\nDebbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the Abaza clan in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas.\nThe Castle of St. Louis (Qalaat Al Muizz). It was built by the Crusaders in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the Fatimid caliph Al Muizz. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near Murex Hill.\nEshmun Temple, dedicated to the Phoenician god of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali River.\nThe British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps the only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden, but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened.\n\nEducation\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\n\nArchaeology\nThe following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.\nSidon I, II and III are prehistoric sites, while Sidon I is the tell of ancient Sidon starting from the Early Bronze Age.\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard  in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (c. 3200 BC) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.\n\nBronze Age city and kingdom\nCity of Sidon (Sidon IV site)\nIn the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.\n\nTell el-Burak MBA settlement\nSince the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.\n\nMBA kingdom of Sidon\nArchaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the \"Kingdom of Sidon\" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.\n\nExcavation history\nThe area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):\n\nDakerman (Roger Saidah, 1968–1969)\nTambourit (Saidah, 1977)\nMagharet Abloun (Aimé Péretié, 1855; Ernest Renan, 1864; Georges Contenau, 1920)\nAyaa (William King Eddy, 1887; Osman Hamdi Bey, 1892; Contenau, 1920)\nAin al-Hilweh (Charles Cutler Torrey, 1919–1920)\nEl-Merah (Contenau, 1920)\nQrayé (Contenau, 1920)\nAlmoun, (Conenau, 1924)\nEl-Harah (Theodore Makridi, 1904; Contenau, 1924)\nMagharet Abloun, Greco-Roman part (Renan, 1864; Contenau, 1914–1924)\nHelalié/Baramié/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M. Meurdrac & L. Albanèse, 1938–1939)\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: Mission de Phénicie (1864–1874; Phoenician Expedition).\nThe St. Louis castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the archaeological sites at Sidon to safeguard them from damage.\n\nIn the Bible\nHebrew Bible/Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Bible describes Sidon (צִידוֹן‎) in several passages:\n\nIt received its name from the \"first-born\" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah.\nThe Tribe of Zebulun has a frontier on Sidon\nIt was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city.\nIt was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued.\nThe Sidonians long oppressed Israel.\nFrom the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \"virgin daughter\", rose to its place of pre-eminence.\nSolomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel.\nJezebel was the daughter of King Ithobaal I of Sidon.\nIt was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce.\nIt is frequently referred to by the prophets.\nElijah sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles.\n\nNew Testament\nJesus visited the region or \"coasts\" (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching, leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21-23 to Korazin and Bethsaida. See the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter, which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and Tyre. Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis\nFrom Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome.\n\nIn ancient mythology\nThe account ascribed to the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of Nereus. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.\n\nGallery\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nZugló, Hungary\n Constanța, Romania\n Sofia, Bulgaria\n Sochi, Russia\n\nNotable people\nIn antiquity and the pre-modern era\nChronological list.\n\nEumaeus, character from Greek mythology.

      "content": "Sidon ou Saïda en francais (en phénicien 𐤑𐤃𐤍 / Ṣīdūn ; en grec ancien : Σιδών / Sidṓn ;  en arabe : صيدا / ṣaydā) est une ville du Liban. Elle fut dans l'Antiquité l'une des plus grandes villes de la Phénicie. La ville était construite sur un promontoire s'avançant dans la mer. Ce fut le plus grand port de la Phénicie sous son roi Zimrida (en), au XIVe siècle av. J.-C. Elle est aussi appelée Sagette ou Sayette durant les Croisades (nom donné par les Francs) et Sidon dans la Bible. Son nom signifie « pêcherie ».\nElle possède une longue et riche histoire et traversa les siècles avec des destinées diverses au contact des différents peuples qui la contrôlèrent, les Phéniciens, les Assyriens qui la ruinèrent en 677 av. J.-C., les Perses achéménides, les Macédoniens, les Séleucides, les Romains et plus tard les Croisés, les Arabes, les Ottomans, et les Français. La ville moderne est aujourd'hui l'une des plus importantes du Liban.\n\nOrigine du nom\nD'après la Genèse, Sidon aurait été fondée par Tsidone, fils de Canaan, lui-même petit-fils de Noé (Genèse 10,15-10,19).\n\nHistoire\nSidon, métropole phénicienne\nElle est une des principales cités du royaume cananéen aux environs du XVe siècle av. J.-C. Avec Tyr et Byblos, ses rivales, elle développe le commerce maritime. Au XIVe siècle av. J.-C., le maire de Sidon Zimrida entretient une correspondance diplomatique avec le pharaon Akhénaton, comme l'atteste une des lettres d'Amarna. Sidon devient l'un des plus importants ports de la Méditerranée orientale aux environs du XIIIe siècle av. J.-C., avant sa dévastation probable par les Peuples de la mer. Vers 1200 av. J.-C., elle est prise par les Philistins et c'est alors Tyr qui passe au premier plan. Elle est ensuite soumise aux puissances du Proche-Orient.\nD'après la Genèse (composée entre le VIIIe et IIe siècle av. J.-C.), l'antique Sidon est l'une des plus vieilles villes de la côte phénicienne, fondée par Tsidone, fils de Canaan, lui-même petit-fils de Noé.\nTributaire de l'Assyrie, s'étant révoltée, Assarhaddon la détruit en 677 av. J.-C. La ville est reconstruite par les Babyloniens, et reprise par les Perses vers 540 av. J.-C. Sidon accueille régulièrement le satrape de Transeuphratène lors de son passage en Phénicie, et un paradis, résidence satrapique, se trouve à côté de Sidon. Le roi de Sidon est traditionnellement grand-amiral en second de la flotte perse ; Sidon contribue à accroître cette dernière grâce à l'importance de ses chantiers navals. Ainsi, lors des guerres médiques, elle fournit aux Perses des contingents navals à la bataille de Salamine en 480 av. J.-C.\nMais un siècle plus tard, c'est avec les Grecs que les Phéniciens entretiennent des liens commerciaux ; depuis longtemps, Grecs et Phéniciens se connaissent, leurs échanges se sont beaucoup développés : les Grecs avaient emprunté leur alphabet aux Phéniciens, et l'emprunt le plus remarquable des Phéniciens aux Grecs est celui de la monnaie, où apparaît même la chouette d'Athéna. Le poète grec Homère cite Sidon, « le grand marché du bronze », ville « bien peuplée » ; il a salué l'habileté des Phéniciennes de Sidon, dont la fabrication de teinture de pourpre était réputée. La ville avait une tradition réputée dans la production de verre soufflé puis plat également. C'est sur la plage de Sidon — selon la mythologie grecque — que Zeus a enlevé Europe, fille d'Agénor, roi de Tyr. Une légende attribue la fondation de Thèbes (Béotie) à ses habitants. Grands commerçants, les habitants de Sidon, Tyr, Arados et d'autres Phéniciens fréquentent le Pirée, et le roi Straton est honoré à Athènes dès 362. La sujétion de Sidon à l'égard des Perses prend bientôt fin avec le roi Tennès, qui est à l'origine en 351 av. J.-C. de la révolte contre la Perse ; la ville est prise vers 346-345 av. J.-C. et est brûlée après le soulèvement ; elle perd une partie de son territoire et est affaiblie. En 333 av. J.-C., elle se rallie avec enthousiasme à Alexandre le Grand.\n\nChronologie des rois phéniciens de Sidon\nLes deux rois Eshmounazar (ou Eshmun'azar ou Eshmazar ; phénicien : 𐤀𐤔𐤌𐤍𐤏𐤆𐤓, un nom théophore signifiant «Eshmun aide»)), dont le tombeau a été découvert en 1855, et Tabnit (en), qui ont régné vers 575-525 av. J.-C., furent enterrés à Sidon. La chronologie des rois de Sidon est bien connue entre 372 et 333 av. J.-C. par leurs monnaies qui étaient datées annuellement par l'année de règne.\n\nSidon à l'époque hellénistique\nAlexandre le Grand la dote de nouveaux territoires dans l'arrière-pays : elle reçoit en don non seulement la montagne mais aussi une partie de la Bekaa et de l'Anti-Liban. Comme toutes les cités phéniciennes, Sidon a conservé, en 333/332 av. J.-C., ses institutions politiques originales, malgré les occupations assyrienne, babylonienne et perse : elle a un roi entouré d'un Conseil des Anciens. Un nouveau roi, client des Perses, Abdashtart II (Straton II) avait été installé sur le trône de Sidon. Aussi, Alexandre destitue-t-il son successeur immédiat, Abdashtart III (Straton III), considéré comme peu sûr, pour installer sur le trône un membre de l'ancienne famille royale, Abdalonymos. Pour marquer son avènement, les Sidoniens inaugurent alors dans leur monnayage une nouvelle ère, dite « du peuple ». Grâce à sa flotte, Sidon fournit à Alexandre une aide efficace dans le siège qu'il met devant Tyr en 332 av. J.-C..[source insuffisante]\nÀ la mort d'Alexandre en 323 av. J.-C., les Diadoques s'affrontent pour se partager son empire. Antigone le Borgne établit son camp en Phénicie, face à Tyr, et à sa demande, les chantiers navals de Sidon entreprennent la construction de nouveaux navires. Après la défaite d'Antigone à la bataille d'Ipsos, Sidon et Tyr doivent revenir à Ptolémée Ier, mais les villes sont aux mains de Démétrios Ier Poliorcète ; Séleucos Ier et Ptolémée se disputent la Cœlé-Syrie : Séleucos revendique les deux villes, sans pouvoir d'abord les obtenir. Ce n'est que beaucoup plus tard, vers 288/286 av. J.-C., que Ptolémée parvient à les conquérir.\nDès lors, en raison de leur très important rôle économique et militaire, les villes de Sidon, Tyr et Arados bénéficient de la bienveillance du roi lagide ; mais en se transformant en cités aux mœurs grecques, leurs institutions changent. Des concours grecs y sont organisés dans les palestres et les gymnases ; le boxeur Sillis de Sidon participe au concours à Délos en 269 av. J.-C. ; un habitant de Sidon participe même à la course de char aux jeux néméens, preuve qu'il est bien reconnu comme Grec : Sidon est donc considérée comme une ville grecque à la fin du IIIe siècle ou au début du IIe siècle av. J.-C. Des concours en l'honneur de l'Apollon de Delphes sont même organisés dans cette ville. La rapidité de l'hellénisation des Phéniciens se traduit aussi dans l'importante vie intellectuelle qui se développe à Sidon : dès le IIIe siècle av. J.-C., le philosophe stoïcien Zénon de Sidon est l'élève de Zénon de Cition. Sur le plan politique, il n'y a plus de roi à Sidon au plus tard en 278 av. J.-C., quand meurt Philoclès, le successeur d'Abdalonymos ; des agoranomes sont régulièrement attestés à Sidon, qui a sans doute aussi un juge, (δικαστής, dikastès), et un archonte. Tous les magistrats connus à Sidon portent d'ailleurs des noms grecs.\nLes troubles reprennent avec la cinquième guerre de Syrie, à partir de 202 av. J.-C. : Antiochos III veut conquérir la Syrie lagide ; il est vainqueur à la bataille de Panion de l'Étolien Scopas qui se réfugie à Sidon, mais la ville capitule à l'automne 199 av. J.-C., malgré trois armées de secours accourues pour la sauver. Ville de garnisons lagides, Sidon avait abrité nombre de mercenaires venus d'Asie Mineure. Après la conquête séleucide, ces mercenaires venus de Pamphylie, de Pisidie ou de Phrygie forment l'élite des phalanges et sont depuis longtemps hellénisés, comme l'attestent leurs noms grecs et le style parfaitement grec des stèles de Sidon. Dans les domaines intellectuel et artistique, Tyr et Sidon constituent de grands centres pour les lettres grecques : la philosophie stoïcienne est représentée par Antipatros de Sidon (vers 170 av. J.-C. / 100 av. J.-C.) qui est l'auteur d'épigrammes, et par Boéthos de Sidon, élève de Diogène de Babylone, qui s'occupe de cosmologie. La philosophie épicurienne est illustrée par Zénon de Sidon (IIe – Ier siècles av. J.-C. ; à ne pas confondre avec un autre Zénon de Sidon, stoïcien). Un philosophe phénicien, Moschus de Sidon, passe pour avoir été l'inventeur de la théorie des atomes, que Démocrite aurait reprise par la suite.\nReconnue sacrée et asyle en 122 av. J.-C., Sidon devient libre vers 112/110 av. J.-C., et frappe monnaie pour son propre compte dès 107 av. J.-C., inaugurant ainsi l'étalon phénicien.\n\nSidon à l'époque romaine\nSidon est honorée du titre de navarchis qui reconnaît son rôle essentiel de ville amirale, lieu de mouillage pour la flotte de guerre romaine, la classis syriaca. Cependant, la ville n'échappe pas aux luttes de factions, et Auguste la réduit en esclavage, aux dires de Dion Cassius.\nSous l'empire, Sidon continue à se distinguer surtout en matière d'artisanat : sa réputation est si grande dès l'Antiquité que les auteurs anciens tenaient la verrerie pour une invention de la Phénicie ; d'abord moulé, le verre a ensuite été soufflé et a permis une large diffusion de vaisselle dans cette matière, en particulier de petits vases à parfums, à onguents ou à cosmétiques ; Sidon réalise une production luxueuse de verres incrustés de pierreries ou à couleurs mêlées : des verres de luxe sortent de l'officine célèbre d'Ennion de Sidon, et certains artisans signent leurs productions de leur nom, comme Artas, Philippos ou Neikôn, en gage de qualité. L'industrie de la pourpre s'est aussi largement développée à Sidon comme à Tyr, grâce à la présence du murex et à la possibilité de trouver des textiles de qualité, car il s'agit de teindre des étoffes : production de grand luxe en raison du coût de la teinture, les étoffes teintes en pourpre de Sidon sont destinées à la cour impériale romaine et aux membres des ordres supérieurs. La colline de murex qui s'élève encore aujourd'hui à Sidon témoigne des quantités considérables de coquillages qui furent nécessaires à cette production. L'artisanat du textile en Phénicie n'est pas moins réputé. Décrivant Cléopâtre, le poète latin Lucain évoque un voile arachnéen provenant d'une soie brute chinoise teinte à Sidon puis retissée : « La blancheur de son sein éclate à travers un voile de Sidon, tissé par le peigne des Sères et dont l'aiguille des Égyptiennes a desserré le tissu clair et large ». La ville jouit d'une grande réputation pour le travail du bronze, et possède des associations de couteliers et de charpentiers.\nSidon et Tyr font partie de la Haute-Galilée, souvent citées dans les Évangiles de Luc, Marc et Mathieu, et  témoins du passage du Christ et de ses miracles. Au-dessus de Tyr, Cana de Galilée, lieu du premier miracle du Christ, à la demande de sa mère, et qui avait transformé l'eau en vin, alors que celui-ci était venu à manquer au cours de noces. Sidon est le lieu de rencontre des saints Pierre, qui y prêchait, et de Paul et Luc, de passage pour Rome. Elle abrite également le sanctuaire marial de Maghdouché qui la surplombe, et où la Vierge aurait attendu dans une grotte, Mantara, le Christ qui prêchait dans Sidon, ville païenne. À Sarepta de Sidon (Sarafand), eut lieu le premier miracle du Christ sur une femme cananéenne (non-juive), dont la fille était mourante.\nEn 218, Sidon obtient le titre de metropolis, et en 221-222, l'empereur Héliogabale lui confère le statut colonial avec installation de vétérans.\n\nUn Mithraeum\nHistorique\n141 : le culte de Mithra est introduit au temple d'Echmoun (à 3 km de Sidon) comme l'atteste la dédicace du cippe de Théoddotos : « Au dieu saint Asclépios, Théodotos, prêtre de Mithra, a dédié, l’an 251 [de l’ère de Sidon] » \n\nFin IVe siècle : Dédicace de trois des statues du mithraeum de Sidon par « Flavios Gerontios, pater nomimos |…|». qui témoigne de la longue survivance polythéiste et plus tardive dédicace connue à Mithra, malgré la pression chrétienne.  Virtuosité technique et coût du groupe statuaire et du relief laissent supposer un contexte élitaire.\n391-392:  interdiction des cultes païens et abandon rapide du mithraeum de Sidon qui disparaît des mémoires\nDécouverte rocambolesque et  second oubli qui illustrent la grande période des chasseurs d’antiquités et des pilleurs de tombes, souvent au   service des grandes puissances européennes.\n\n1881 : découverte du mithraeum par les antiquaires Alphonse et Edmond Durighello lors de fouilles clandestines menées à Saïda (Liban), l’ancienne Sidon, alors sous domination ottomane.\n1924 : mort de Joseph-Ange Durighello, dernière personne à prétendre connaître l’emplacement exact du mithréum.\n1967 : don de l’ensemble mithriaque de Sidon au Louvre.\n2013 : J.-M. Saint-Jalm situe le mithraeum sur le terrain de l’archevêché grec catholique melkite de Saïda.\n\nUn temple privé\nL'iconographie témoigne du caractère privé et topique du culte de Mithra, dans lesquels   chaque  groupe d’adeptes forme une combinatoire unique autour de figures sacrées récurrentes. Au sein d'un temple privée la variabilité est la norme. Et c'est autour de figures récurrentes que s'organise une combinatoire locale unique. La particularité iconographique de ce temple est la présence d'Hécate Trimorphe dispensatrice de vie (un parallèle possible avec le triple Mithra?) mais aussi d'une figure léontocéphale (reprenant certains codes de la statuaire égyptienne archaïque). Les figures de Mithra et des dadophores sont plutôt classiques dans les mithraeum même si on y perçoit une influence romaine sur les compagnons de Mithra. Ils sont porteurs de haches doubles (liens possibles avec Jupiter Dolichenus).\n→ Malgré toutes de vastes zones d’ombres persistent concernant le mithraeum de Sidon : peut-être n’en est-il  même pas un? Il s’agirait alors d’un simple dépôt visant à la sauvegarde de sacra mithriaques.\n\nSidon, du Moyen Âge à nos jours\nEn 551, Sidon subit un violent séisme. Ancien évêché, la ville est assez modeste et sans grande importance lorsqu'elle est conquise par le général arabe Yazîd b. Abî Sufyân en 637. Les géographes arabes la décrivent comme une place forte qui servait de port de guerre de Damas.\nElle acquiert de la notoriété à l'époque des Croisades : elle est assiégée en 1107 puis libérée soit contre rançon, soit avec l'aide de secours damascènes. Elle est prise finalement aux mains des croisés en 1110-1111 par les Croisés de Baudouin, roi de Jérusalem, avec l'aide de la flotte norvégienne de Sigurd Ier, après un blocus de 47 jours. Baudouin la donne alors à l'un de ses fidèles barons, Eustache Granier ou Garnier seigneur de Césarée Ses descendants conserveront cette seigneurie jusqu'en 1260.\n\nSidon devient le chef-lieu de la seigneurie de Sagette, englobant le château de Beaufort au sud-ouest, seconde des quatre baronnies du royaume de Jérusalem. Reprise à Renaud Grenier par Saladin en 1187, ses remparts seront rasés. Envahie par les Arabes, rendue aux troupes de Grenier par Saladin avant sa mort, attaquée par les Mongols, Sagette sera vendue par Julien Grenier aux Templiers. La ville sert de refuge aux survivants du siège de Saint-Jean-d'Acre en 1191.\nElle est mise à sac par les Mongols en 1260 ; puis, la même année, tombe sous le contrôle de Templiers jusqu'à sa prise par le Sultanat mamelouk en 1291. De 1291 à nos jours, elle redevient à majorité musulmane.\nElle connaît une nouvelle prospérité aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles. De 1660 à 1775, elle est la capitale d'une province ottomane, l'eyalet de Sidon, avant d'être supplantée par Acre puis par Beyrouth. La France y entretient dès 1616 un consulat : jusqu'à la Révolution française, les marchands marseillais détiennent un quasi-monopole sur le commerce extérieur de « Seyde (Sidon) et dépendances ». Cependant, l'expulsion des Français par Jazzar en 1791 porte un coup fatal à son commerce, ce dont Beyrouth saura profiter. Saïda devient un modeste port de pêche, et le restera jusqu'à nos jours. En 1848, le voyageur historien Baptistin Poujoulat écrit dans Récits et souvenirs d'un voyage en Orient que la ville, « bien mesquine et bien sale », compte 2 600 chrétiens, 2 000 musulmans et 400 Juifs, soit 5 000 habitants.\nEn 1982, lors de l’invasion israélienne du Liban, mille prisonniers palestiniens sont enfermés dans la cour de l’école du couvent Saint-Joseph, pendant des jours. Ils ne reçoivent ni eau ni nourriture ; certains prisonniers boivent leur urine. Les prisonniers sont passés à tabac, certains énucléés, d’autres en meurent ou restent infirmes. Les soldats admettent les mauvais traitements et les actes de barbarie, mais les justifient ; ils n’ont jamais été poursuivis.\n\nSidon aujourd'hui\nC'est la troisième plus grande ville du Liban. Elle est située dans le gouvernorat du Sud du Liban, à environ 40 km au nord de Tyr et à 40 km au sud de la capitale, Beyrouth.\nLa cité offre aujourd'hui une multitude de vestiges à visiter comme le Château de la mer, le château de la terre (Château de Saint-Louis, 1253), le temple d'Eshmoun dont l'édification remonte au VIIe siècle av. J.-C., la médina (la ville médiévale), la colline de Murex, le musée du savon, le Khân el-Franj « La maison des Français » (Ancien consulat de France), etc.\nElle est reliée à Beyrouth par une autoroute. La Place de l'Étoile est le point de départ des liaisons d'autocars vers Beyrouth, Tyr...\nPlusieurs confessions se côtoient à Saïda : musulmans sunnites, chiites, chrétiens maronites et grecs-catholiques, jusqu'aux années 1980, on y trouvait des juifs libanais. La ville comptait quelque 200 000 habitants en 2000. Elle est devenue le centre commercial et financier du Liban du Sud.\nSaïda est la cité natale de l'ancien Premier ministre Rafic Hariri, assassiné à Beyrouth le 14 février 2005 dans un attentat à la voiture piégée.\nLe centre historique de la ville fait partie de la liste indicative au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 1996.\nLe sanctuaire marial de Maghdouché-Sayyedet el Mantara, est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial religieux.\nUn bombardement israélien fait 45 morts et 70 blessés le 29 septembre 2024.

      "summary": "Sidon ou Saïda en francais (en phénicien 𐤑𐤃𐤍 / Ṣīdūn ; en grec ancien : Σιδών / Sidṓn ;  en arabe : صيدا / ṣaydā) est une ville du Liban. Elle fut dans l'Antiquité l'une des plus grandes villes de la Phénicie. La ville était construite sur un promontoire s'avançant dans la mer. Ce fut le plus grand port de la Phénicie sous son roi Zimrida (en), au XIVe siècle av. J.-C. Elle est aussi appelée Sagette ou Sayette durant les Croisades (nom donné par les Francs) et Sidon dans la Bible. Son nom signifie « pêcherie ».\nElle possède une longue et riche histoire et traversa les siècles avec des destinées diverses au contact des différents peuples qui la contrôlèrent, les Phéniciens, les Assyriens qui la ruinèrent en 677 av. J.-C., les Perses achéménides, les Macédoniens, les Séleucides, les Romains et plus tard les Croisés, les Arabes, les Ottomans, et les Français. La ville moderne est aujourd'hui l'une des plus importantes du Liban.",
