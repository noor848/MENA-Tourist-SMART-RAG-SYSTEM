      "content": "Zahlé (Arabic: زَحْلة) is a city in eastern Lebanon, and the capital and  largest city of Beqaa Governorate, Lebanon. With around 150,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city in Lebanon after Beirut and Tripoli and the fourth-largest taking the whole urban area (the Jounieh urban area is larger).\nZahlé is located 55 km (34 mi) east of the capital Beirut, close to the Beirut-Damascus road, and lies at the junction of Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley, at a mean elevation of 1,000 m. Established in the 18th century by Christians, Zahlé maintains its predominantly Greek Catholic character. The city has historically enjoyed convenient accessibility via road and rail, leveraging its strategic location as a trade hub.\nZahlé is known as the \"Bride of the Beqaa\" and \"the Neighbor of the Gorge\" for its geographical location and attractiveness, but also as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\". It is famous throughout Lebanon and the region for its pleasant climate, numerous riverside restaurants and quality arak. Its inhabitants are predominantly Melkite Greek Catholic and are known in Arabic as Zahlawi.\n\nEtymology\nThe source of the city's name is unclear, some historian relate it to the ancient Roman god of fertility - Zohal. Evidence of Roman presence are the ruins found. Others claim the derives from the occasional landslides that take place on deforested hills around the town are probably at the origin of the name.\n\nHistory\nThere has been human activity in the area for at least five thousand years. In the 18th century, Zahlé was a small village of some 200 houses. Its relative geographic isolation from the local centres of power in Mount Lebanon and Syria caused the village not to have any significant allies in the region to fall back on in case of conflicts or attacks. Zahlé was burned in 1777 and 1791.\nTradition holds that many Christians migrated from the Baalbek region in the 18th century to the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfush dynasty's oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned that interpretation by pointing out that the dynasty was closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahlé (where Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the 18th century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek then to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes and established itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even served as consuls of Iran.\nAt the end of the 18th century, Zahlé had one thousand inhabitants and two hundred houses. By 1820, Zahlé's population had grown to 5,000. By 1850 it was 7,000 to 8,000 and the town had become the commercial centre for the Beka'a and main depot for the local grain harvest. Some of the factors for the expansion included the Egyptian Occupation (1831–41), which lead to the opening of the country to European trade, the Crimean War which had caused grain shortages in Europe and the expansion of silk production in Mount Lebanon.\nBesides controlling the grain trade, Zahlé became a centre for livestock from the region of Syria and produced leather, woven and dyed goods, trading with Aleppo, Damascus and Beirut. By the 1860's and 1870's the local merchants were prosperous but were still dependent on banks in Beirut for credit for their transactions.\nOn 7 September 1975, during the civil war, the Lebanese Forces militia, at that time led by Elie Hobeika agreed to 100 Syrian soldiers and 20 intelligence officers taking up strategic positions in the town.\nThe current population is not accurately known, since no census has been conducted in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates from 2017 are of a population of 386,362 people in the town proper, making it the country's fourth largest. (The locals tend to give figures of 200,000 or 300,000 inhabitants, which, however, are misleading and completely unrealistic.) The urban area includes the neighbouring towns of Saadnayel, Taalabaya, Chtaura and Jdita to the southwest, which have come to form a single urban entity since the late 1990s due to unplanned growth, and is home to about 100,000 people. The metropolitan area extends over much of the Zahlé District and additionally comprises:\n\nthe town of Kab Elias to the southwest\nthe town of Bar Elias to the south\nthe villages of Furzol, Ablah and Niha to the northeast\nand the towns of Riyaq, Haoush Hala and Ali en Nahri to the east\nwith a total population close to 200,000.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 82.58% and Muslims made up 16.81% of registered voters in Zahlé. 28.27% of the voters were Greek Catholics, 23.77% were Maronite Catholics, 12.62% were Greek Orthodox, 10.24% were Shiite Muslims, 7.55% were Syriac Orthodox and 6.55% were Sunni Muslims.\nZahlé is one of the largest predominantly Christian towns in Lebanon and the Middle East (with Christians once forming around 90% of its total population during the French occupation) and the one with the largest number of Catholics. While several Middle Eastern cities (including Damascus, Cairo and Amman) have larger Christian communities, these do not constitute a majority. In Lebanon, Beirut also has a larger Christian population than Zahlé (in the city proper), but most of this population belongs to the Greek Orthodox confession. Jounieh is also bigger than Zahlé, and was also overwhelmingly Christian before the French withdrawal.\nOnly two Muslim families remained inside Zahlé during the civil war: Hindi and Zrein. Zahlé's Muslim minority is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Karak Nuh (where Noah's tomb is allegedly located) and Haoush al-Umara, specifically, in an area named \"Hay al-watani\", on the northeastern and southwestern edge of town, respectively. Sixty-two percent of Muslims in the area are Shia, while the remaining 38% are Sunnis. In the past the town also had a Druze minority and even a small Jewish population, most of which, however, emigrated during the Lebanese Civil War.\nZahlé has been a land of emigration since the early 20th century, with most people emigrating to South America, mainly Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. During the civil war in the 1970s and 1980s, a new flow of migrants left the town for the United States, Canada, Australia and Brazil. In recent years, emigration has continued, with Canada and the United Arab Emirates being the main destinations. Today, an estimated 250,000 people of local descent live abroad, most of them in Colombia and Brazil.\n\nEconomy\nBeing the main town of the Beqaa Valley, Lebanon's most important agricultural region, the economy of Zahlé has long been built on agriculture. Grapes are the area's chief product, with vineyards forming a prominent feature of the surrounding landscape. Vines are also individually grown on lattice, on many of the older houses' terraces. A sizable part of the local produce supplies the three wineries present in and around the town, and the numerous distilleries producing arak, the local liquor which Zahlé is famous for.\nZahlé saw at a time a prosperous commercial activity due to its location midway between Beirut and Damascus. Paradoxically, it regained some of that activity during the civil war, when the growing instability in Beirut led to a decentralization of the economy. Furthermore, taxation was nonexistent due to the collapse of State authority, which Zahlé took advantage of to expand its industrial and commercial sectors.\nA number of companies and state bodies have their headquarters for the Beqaa region in Zahlé, including the Central Bank of Lebanon and the Lebanese Chamber of Commerce.\n\nEducation\nZahlé is evolving into a regional center of higher education, after many universities have opened branches there in recent years. Institutes of higher education currently represented in the town include:\n\nLebanese University\nSaint Joseph University\nHoly Spirit University of Kaslik\nAntonine University\nAmerican University of Science and Technology\nThe National Technical Institute\n\nTransportation\nZahlé is connected to Beirut (55 kilometres (34 mi) to the west), and from there to all coastal cities, through the Beirut-Damascus road, which passes to the southwest of the urban area. The journey can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the traffic. Damascus, Syria, is 73 km (45 mi) to the southeast, and is normally reached within one-and-a-half hours, excluding the waiting time at the border. Despite continuously undergoing works and repairs, the Beirut-Damascus road remains in poor condition, and is due to be replaced by a new, multimillion-dollar highway as the main international route; however, the completion date is still unclear.\nZahlé is also connected to Baalbek (36 km (22 mi) to the northeast) by the trans-Beqaa road, which continues further north towards Homs, Syria. \nDue to widespread car ownership, public transportation remains underdeveloped. There is a single bus line, which runs on the central avenue at rather irregular times. Interurban transportation is done by minivans, which stop on the Manara roundabout at the town's entrance. Zahlé's railway station was located in Muallaqa, but was abandoned after all rail transport in Lebanon stopped during the civil war.\nThere were plans to convert the nearby Rayak Air Base (located 10 km (6 mi) to the East of Zahlé), into a civil airport serving the town and the whole valley. A regional airport could prove vital when the road to Beirut is closed because of heavy snowfall. However, the project froze in the early 2000s, after the runway extension had been initiated.\n\nMain sights\nBerdawni Promenade\nThe banks of the Berdawni River have long been a place where people of Zahlé and other parts of Lebanon come to socialize. The town's most popular attraction is a 300-metre (984 ft) promenade along the river, referred to as \"Al Wadi\" (\"the valley\"). Sheltered between the ravine's limestone cliffs, it is lined up with large outdoor restaurants, cafes and playrooms, and shaded by trees. These restaurants specialize in traditional Lebanese meze served with arak. The promenade is closed during late fall and winter, when cold winds from the mountain sweep through the ravine.\n\nOur Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa\nLocated on a hilltop to the southwest of Zahlé, this is a 54-metre-high (177 ft) concrete tower, entirely clad in white marble, and topped with a 10-metre-tall (33 ft) bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of an Italian artist. It is by far Zahlé's most prominent structure—visible from most of the city and from several miles around in the central Bekaa Valley. At its base is a chapel that can seat a little over a hundred people. The top of the tower features sweeping views over Zahlé and the Bekaa Valley.\n\nTown Hall (Old Serail)\nThis Ottoman building was constructed in 1850 to serve as the town's Serail. Located just downhill from Our Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa, it is a mix of local and Ottoman architecture, and features an atrium occupied by an inner garden and surrounded by arcades. Though still known as \"the Old Serail\", it currently serves as the Town Hall. In the past, the ground floor used to house the local prison, which suffered of severe overcrowding and substandard conditions. The prison was transferred in 2009 to a new location in Muallaqa, with room for about 800 inmates and much more adequate infrastructure.\n\nThe Catholic Cathedral (Our Lady of Salvation)\nThis grandiose complex dates back to 1720, and consists of a series of stone-clad buildings around a large inner courtyard: the church itself (which is the oldest part), the seat of the Archbishop (a converted former monastery), and a small chapel housing an icon, which is said to be a reproduction of a portrait of the Virgin Mary by Saint Lucas. It also features a monumental entrance, an underground cemetery, and a 40-metre-high (130 ft) bell tower, atop of which a large marble clock was mounted in 1993. Part of the complex was destroyed by a bomb attack in April 1987, and rebuilt ever since.\n\nGrand Hotel Kadri\nThe grand Hotel Kadri is a prime example of the traditional stone architecture of Zahlé, both in and out. It has long been used by most officials and dignitaries visiting the town, as its largest and most luxurious hotel. The Ottomans converted it to a hospital during World War I. During the Lebanese Civil War, it was occupied by Syrian troops and sustained enormous damage. An ambitious restoration project in the mid-1990s was able to bring it back to its former glory. The hotel closed in February 2011 due to a conflict between its direction and the Catholic Church (its effective owner since 1999) and reopened later in 2013.\n\nMemshieh Park\nSituated across the street from Grand Hotel Kadri, Memshieh is Zahlé's oldest and shadiest park (newly opened J.T.Skaff Park is larger, but contains considerably fewer trees). The park houses a collection of marble tables with mosaic depictions of several sites in Lebanon, a small pond with waterlilies, a semi-circular marble tholos, and several sculptures representing famous locals. In 2003, the municipality covered a 25 m (82 ft) fir (the park's tallest) with thousands of lights, in an attempt to break the world record for the largest natural Christmas tree.\n\nArchaeological sites\nZahlé in itself offers little archaeological interest; however, the Château Ksara winery is worth a visit for its maze of vaults which dates back to Roman times. The suburb of Karak Nuh also features a curiosity: a 40-metre-long (131 ft) stone structure inside the local mosque, which local tradition believes to be the Tomb of Noah (but is probably a section of a Roman aqueduct).\nFurthermore, there are several ancient sites of interest in nearby locations:\n\nIn Qabb Ilyas (12 km (7 mi) to the southwest): rock sculptures of three deities that seem to be of Roman origin\nIn Anjar (18 km (11 mi) to the south): the unique ruins of an Umayyad palace built following a Roman layout, using recycled Hellenistic and Roman material. The palace is classified as a World Heritage Site. A Roman temple also stands on a hilltop above nearby Majdel Anjar.\nAbove the village of Furzol (8 km (5 mi) to the northwest): a series of rock-cut Roman tombs in the limestone cliffs\nIn Niha (11 km (7 mi) to the northwest): two exquisite Roman temples bearing Phoenician architectural elements (just outside the village), and two others in need of restoration (higher up, in the area referred to as \"the Fortress\").\nTwo more sites worth visiting are a more distant trip away:\n\nKamed al Lawz (32 km (20 mi) to the south) is the most important Bronze Age settlement in Lebanon, with finds from the Phoenician, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods having been uncovered as well.\nThe  Roman archaeological complex of Baalbek (another World Heritage Site) is located 36 km (22 mi) to the northwest.\n\nCulture\nZahlé's culture has long revolved around its signature crop, the grape, and its products, wine and arak. Arak, in particular, has traditionally been served in cafés at virtually any time of the day. The city is known as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\".\nZahlé's most important cultural event is the \"Festival of the Vine\", traditionally held each September, during which concerts, plays, poetry evenings and artistic exhibitions are organized daily over the course of two or three weeks. The final Saturday evening features the crowning of the \"Maid of the Vine\", the local beauty queen, and the next afternoon, the festival closes with arguably its most popular event: a parade of floats held on the town's main avenue. \nThe other central aspect of the local culture is religious devotion. Zahlé is still a very Catholic and conservative town, and many of its inhabitants display a pride with their religious identity. \nProphet Elias (Elijah) is the town's patron saint, whose feast on July 20 is traditionally celebrated with fireworks. Another notable holiday is Corpus-Christi, celebrated on the first Thursday of June with a large-scale procession, with a torch-lit parade being held on the previous evening. The Corpus Christi celebration dates back to 1825, when the town was spared the ravages of bubonic plague.\n\nClimate\nZahlé has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with continental influences.\n\nPeople\nShakira, Colombian-Lebanese Singer\nSaid Akl, poet, philosopher and politician\nFouad El Turk, poet, former Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations and head of the Forum of Lebanese Ambassadors\nCharles Elachi (from nearby Riyaq), director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in NASA\nElias Hrawi, president of Lebanon 1989–1998\nJoseph Raya, Melkite Greek Catholic archbishop and civil rights activist\nLouis Khalil, Lebanese priest of the Maronite Church\nNajwa Karam, Lebanese singer and actress\nWael Kfoury, Lebanese singer and actor\nIsabel Bayrakdarian, Armenian-Canadian operatic soprano\nKarl Sharro, Lebanese-Iraqi architect and writer based in London\nMário Zagallo, Brazilian footballer and manager, is of Lebanese ancestry from Zahlé\nKhalil Khamis (born 1995), Lebanese footballer\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nZahlé is twinned with:\n\n Bordeaux, France, since 2006\n\nReferences\nView From Zahle: Security And Economic Conditions In The Central Bekaa 1980-1985\n[1]\non Lebanon and the Peace Process, \"Bashir Gemeyel and Syria Fight Over Zahle\"\nConflict and Consensus, \"Zahlé and Dayr Al-Qamar, two market towns during the civil war of the 1860s.\"\n\"Zahlé and Forzol\"\nDictionary of the Names of Towns and Villages in Lebanon, Anis Freiha, 1976\nHage Chahine, Carlos and Nevine (2008).

      "content": "Zahlé (en arabe : زحلة / zaḥla) est une ville libanaise, capitale du gouvernorat de la Bekaa, et quatrième plus grande ville du Liban après Beyrouth, la capitale du Liban, Tripoli, capitale du Liban-Nord et Jounieh, capitale du district de Kesrouan. Le nom de Zahlé est dérivé d'un mot arabe signifiant « glissante » et cela est dû au glissement des pentes des montagnes chaque année après la fonte de la neige.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville compte 60 000 résidents en 2011, 120 000 habitants avec ses banlieues, et environ 200 000 habitants dans sa zone métropolitaine.\nZahlé est un centre économique et administratif important dans la Bekaa, avec des activités industrielles, commerciales, de services et de loisirs. La ville accueille le siège du gouvernorat de la Bekaa, des tribunaux, des hôpitaux, des écoles, des collèges techniques et des centres universitaires régionaux, ainsi que le siège de la chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Zahlé et de la Bekaa.\nZahlé est reconnue pour son climat agréable, sa cuisine traditionnelle surtout dans les nombreux restaurants qui longent la rivière Nahr el-Berdawni ainsi que pour le grand nombre de célèbres poètes et écrivains qui ont marqué le siècle passé. Toutes ces caractéristiques ont rendu Zahlé « Ville du vin et de la poésie ».\nAutour de Zahlé, sur les contreforts du Mont Liban, les habitants font pousser de la vigne, des céréales, des fruits et des légumes. Dans la plaine à l'Est sont cultivées principalement la vigne et la pomme de terre.\nLa ville de Zahlé peut être considérée comme la plus grande ville catholique du Proche-Orient – la majorité de sa population est de rite grec catholique – puisque Ashrafieh, le secteur chrétien de la ville de Beyrouth, est à majorité orthodoxe. C'est la ville d'exception au Liban avec son alimentation en électricité 24 heures sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7 (Electricité de Zahlé).\n\nHistorique de la ville\nAu XVIIIe siècle, un grand nombre d'émigrants provenant de la Békaa, du Mont-Liban et du Houran s'installent sur les bordures de Berdawni et, au XIXe siècle, la ville devient le premier état autonome de la région et se caractérise par ses propres drapeau et hymne.\nLa ville a été brûlée plusieurs fois : 1771, 1791 et 1860. Elle a été reliée au chemin de fer en 1885, ce qui a donné à la ville un aspect commercial étant le « port intérieur » de la Békaa et la Syrie, et un centre de transaction pour l'agriculture et les marchandises entre Beyrouth et Damas.\n\nBataille de Zahlé\nÀ la fin de décembre 1791, Jahjah bin Mustafa Al Harfoushi a établi un plan pour occuper Baalbek et expulser les gendarmes du gouverneur de Al-Sham Ahmad Pasha Al-Jazzar, mais qu'une centaine de guerriers[Quoi ?], alors il a embauché une autre centaine des Zahliotes et des gens de la montagne pour une journée.\nIl y avait des gardes sur la ville depuis l'ouest, là où les plaines s'étiraient, alors il a choisi d'entrer au nord, du côté de Labwa. Son plan était d'entrer  dans le centre-ville sans que personne le ressente, empêchant ses hommes de faire un mouvement ou une voix  et leur donnant le mot de passe « Abdullah », de sorte que quiconque ne leur répondrait pas en termes similaires  serait immédiatement tué. \nAprès que les gardes ont été tués, son frère Sultan et ses hommes sont entrés dans la ville après minuit, et quand ils sont arrivés au milieu de celle-ci, il a donné le signal en tirant et en criant haut, de sorte que les soldats pensent qu'une grande armée les avait attaqués, et qu’ils ont été surpris sans avoir pu se battre. Alors Mustafa Al Harofushi a occupé la ville et y est resté .\nLes fugitifs sont arrivés à El Sham et ont informé le Mollah Ismail de ce qui leur était arrivé. Il a donc promis de se venger de Jahjah, et il est allé à Zahle avec 1200 cavaliers. Il y avait très peu d'hommes et de munitions, mais des tranchées sont creusées tout autour de la ville pour que les chevaux n'entrent pas. Ismail a alors attaqué la ville par les côtés nord et sud, alors, les hommes se sont réfugiés dans les tranchées. Ils sont abattus sans apparaître devant les soldats, puis il est parti vaincu, et la tâche du sultan et de vingt de ses hommes était de résister à la deuxième division de l'armée. Le sultan lui-même a conçu une diversion que les militaires poursuivent, de sorte qu'il les pousse à s'approcher du réservoir, où ils deviennent une cible facile pour l'arme du latent.\nCette bataille a duré plus de cinq heures. L'armée (Mullah Ismail) a été vaincue après son impact avec de nombreux morts et blessés. Un seul homme, Ibn Moubarak, a été tué par les défenseurs (Jahjah et Sultan et les défenseurs avec eux).\n\nLes quartiers de Zahlé\nLe fleuve de Berdawni qui parcourt la ville partage les quartiers en deux zones parallèles : Zone Est et la Zone Ouest .\n\nTourisme\nTourisme religieux\nNotre dame de Zahlé et de la Békaa\nChez les habitants de la Békaa et surtout pour les Zahliotes, la Vierge Marie a une place historique importante pour bénir et sauver la ville et les citoyens. En 1957, après les évènements qui ont ravagé le Liban et Zahlé, une demande a été présentée à  l’archevêque des Catholiques Aftimos Yoakim afin d'autoriser la construction d'un sanctuaire avec une tour sur l'une des collines de la ville qui porte une statue de 10 m de la Vierge Marie pour l'honorer et montrer leur amour et de leurs remerciements. Après l'acceptation de l'archevêque, les travaux ont commencé en 1965 avec l'apposition de la statue le 26 janvier de cette année. Les travaux ont été arrêtés durant la guerre civile libanaise (1975-1990). La statue de la Vierge Marie porte l'enfant Jésus et un épi de blé (symbole des récoltes de la Békaa et de l'amour de Jésus).\n\nL’Archéparchie des Grecs Catholiques Melkites de Fourzol, Zahlé et de la Békaa\nL’évêché a été établi dans le village de Fourzol au début du Ve siècle par l’archevêque Saint Bardanos puis a été transféré à Zahlé par l’archevêque Aphtimos Fadel en 1727. La cathédrale Saydet Al najat (سيدة النجاة) qui fait partie de l’évêché a été construite en 1846. Cette cathédrale a subi des évènements dramatiques : elle est tombée en cendre durant les évènements de 1860 et restaurée à partir de 1861. De plus, une grande explosion toucha l’évêché le 15 septembre 1987 et une partie du bâtiment fut détruite. Cependant, grâce aux efforts de l’archevêque André Haddad qui a survécu par miracle, des travaux de construction et de restauration ont été faites pour l'embellir de nouveau .\n\nTourisme gastronomique\nLe château Ksara\nLe Château Ksara est la plus ancienne cave viticole au Liban qui a été fondée en 1857 regroupant dix vignobles sur 441 hectares dans la vallée de la Békaa. La production annuelle varie entre les différents types de vin mais on peut compter presque 2,5 millions de bouteilles. La cave de Ksara a été trouvée par erreurs en 1898 par les Jésuites, qui étaient à la recherche d'un loup qui mangeait leur poulet.\n\nRestaurants sur le Berdawni\nAppelée la capitale de la gastronomie levantine, la vallée de Berdawni à Zahlé regroupe des cafés et des restaurants très célèbres. Cette appellation revient du début du XXe siècle avec ces casinos de Berdawni qui ont entraîné une vague touristique importante dans la Békaa. C'est un lieu de destination pour tous les touristes arabes et étrangers qui visitent la ville afin de savourer les plats libanais et spécialement Zahléotes et de profiter de la nature qui entoure la vallée. Ces lieux peuvent recevoir un très grand nombre d'invités et offrent une cuisine variée et délicieuse. Sans jamais oublier le dessert de crème glacée arabe, une spécialité des habitants de Zahlé et le parc d'attraction qui comprend des jeux électroniques pour le divertissement des enfants et des pistes de course automobile.\n\nAnciennes maisons\nZahlé conserve jusqu'à aujourd'hui de belles maisons bourgeoises aux tuiles rouges qui appartiennent aux familles Geha, Azar, Skaff, Hindi. La résidence Geha est connue par la grande cour intérieure en arcades entourée par 24 pièces et un long tunnel de 1.4 Km qui relie la propriété à l'église St. Elie.\nL'ancien sérail (qui est aujourd'hui la municipalité de Zahlé) a été construit en 1885 et sa cour intérieure compte de nombreuses arcades. \nLe souk el Blatt est situé dans la partie la plus ancienne de la ville. Ce souk était un lieu d'échange entre les commerçants venant de Syrie, de Palestine et de Bagdad.\n\nTourisme culturel\nLe centre culturel français\nLe centre culturel a été inauguré à Zahlé en 1958 et offre des cours de langue et de perfectionnement en français ainsi que des projections de film, des pièces de théâtre, des spectacles de danse ainsi que des conférences. Le centre compte aussi une bibliothèque permettant de toucher des publics différents.\n\nLes écoles des activités diverses\nLes écoles de danse, de musique et de peinture ne sont pas en reste. Par l’apprentissage du corps et des sens, elles véhiculent le goût artistique, permettent la perpétuation des traditions, ouvrent aux vocations affirmées ou à naître les voies de la scène mondiale, parisienne, londonienne ou new-yorkaise .\n\nLe Grand Hotel Kadri\nLe Grand hôtel Kadri est un exemple de l’architecture traditionnelle en pierre de Zahlé, tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur. Il a longtemps été utilisé par la plupart des fonctionnaires et des dignitaires visitant la ville, comme son plus grand et le plus luxueux hôtel. Les Ottomans l’ont converti en hôpital pendant la Première Guerre mondiale. C'est le lieu ou le Général francais Gouraud a annoncé la création du Grand Liban en 1920. Pendant la guerre civile libanaise, il a été occupé par les troupes syriennes et a subi d’énormes dégâts. Un ambitieux projet de restauration au milieu des années 90 a réhabilité l'édifice. L’hôtel a fermé ses portes en février 2011 en raison d’un conflit entre sa direction et l’Église catholique (son propriétaire effectif depuis 1999) et a rouvert ses portes plus tard en 2013.\n\nLes hôtels à Zahlé\nBeit El Kroum\nAuberge Breidy\nGrand Kadri Hotel\nHotel St Jean\nZahle hills\nLa place hotel\n\nLes caves à Zahlé\nCave de Ksara\nLes Coteaux du Liban\nDomaine des tourelles\nDomaine Wardy\nChateau St Thomas\nChâteau Khoury\nDomaine de Baal\n\nLes écoles à Zahlé\nÀ Zahlé se trouvent des écoles publiques et privées.
