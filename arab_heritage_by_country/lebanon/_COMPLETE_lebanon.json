          "content": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Beirut was severely damaged by the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2020 massive explosion in the Port of Beirut, and was subsequently rebuilt after each of these events. Its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayrūt (بيروت). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French mandate. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician bēʾrūt (𐤁𐤀‏𐤓𐤕‎ bʾrt). This was a modification of the Phoenician word bīʾrōt later bēʾrūt, meaning \"wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The name is first attested in the 14th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.\nThe Greeks hellenised the name as Bērytós (Ancient Greek: Βηρυτός), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nAt the time of the crusades, the city was known in French as Barut or Baruth.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Persian and Ottoman remains.\n\nPrehistory\nBeirut was settled over 5,000 years ago, and there is evidence that the surrounding area had already been inhabited for tens of thousands of years prior to this. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools from sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Français in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.\nBeirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.\nBeirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticized by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area.\nBeirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.\nBeirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.\nBeirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland, Peter Wescombe, and Marina Hayek in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\nPhoenician period\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in Marburg, Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\nHellenistic period\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon during his conflict with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.\nMid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\nRoman period\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. Under Claudius, Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include Heliopolis (Baalbek). The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region.\nAs a result of this settlement, the city quickly became Romanized, and the city became the only mainly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia province. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony, one of four in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation. Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions.\nBerytus's law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, were natives of Phoenicia and taught there under the Severan emperors. Ecclesiastical historian Sozomen studied at the law school in Beirut between 400 and 402. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire.\nIn 551, a major earthquake struck Berytus, causing widespread damage. The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many, 30,000 in Berytus alone by some measurements. As a result, the students of the law school were transferred to Sidon.\nSalvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\nMiddle Ages\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. As a trading center of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was as important as Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197. John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204. He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\nIn 1291 Beirut was captured and the Crusaders expelled by the Mamluk army of Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil.\n\nOttoman rule\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading center in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks. After Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\nAfter the Albanian fighter Tafil Buzi was interned and then pardoned by the Ottoman administration for his constant uprisings, he raised 3,000 Albanian mercenaries to fight in Lebanon; some of them became notorious shortly afterwards for having been responsible for the widespread disorders in Beirut.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial center. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realization amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\nVilayet of Beirut\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. Though French infrastructure investments in the region were supportive, the local merchant elites were able to independently maintain economic power even after the end of the First World War. In contrast, although Beirut was not the only city to receive French attention in this time, it was able to leverage its critical position to its advantage over others (e.g. Damascus). The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\n\nModern era\nCapital of Lebanon\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nBeirut International Airport was opened on 23 April 1954. It was renamed Rafic Hariri International Airport in 2005 following his assassination. Beirut serves its sole commercial airport as Lebanon's main gateway for flights.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975–1976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\n\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.\nBetween 1989 and 1990 parts on East Beirut were destroyed in fighting between Lebanese army units loyal to General Aoun and Samir Geagea's Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces with the Syrian Armed Forces-backed Elias Hrawi and Salim Al-Huss Lebanese army forces.\nSince the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a center for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup, and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant nine times: 1960–1964, 1999, 2001–2002, and 2016.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.\nIn May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighborhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.\nIn the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nOn 4 August 2020, a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut resulted in the death of at least 203 people (with an additional three missing) and the wounding of more than 6,500. Foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. Furthermore, at least 108 Bangladeshis were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. The cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion. Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on 8 August 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 August explosion. On 10 August 2020, as a result of the protests, Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his resignation. Weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port's duty-free zone, on 10 September 2020.\n\nGeography\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\nClimate\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, bordering on As, Trewartha: Csal) characterized by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy; frost has never been recorded. Summer is prolonged, hot and humid. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.\n\nQuarters and sectors\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\n\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikhaël)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRmeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-Blat\nThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs).\n\nBadaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighborhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favorite hip nightlife destination.\nTwo of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias.\n\nSouthern suburban districts include Chiyah, Ghobeiry (Bir Hassan, Jnah and Ouzai are part of the Ghobeiry municipality), Haret Hreik, Burj al Barajneh, Laylake-Mreijeh, Hay al Sillum and Hadath. Eastern suburbs include Burj Hammoud, Sin el Fil, Dekwane and Mkalles. Hazmiyeh is also considered as an eastern suburb with its close proximity to the capital. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war.\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more commonly used.\n\nDemographics\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\nReligion\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. Before the civil war the neighborhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict. East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, whilst West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. Christians comprise 35% of Beirut's population, Muslims 63%, Druze 1%, and others 1%.\n\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\n\nLanguages\nLebanon does not hold a census survey; researchers at the American University of Beirut have found that trilingualism - between Lebanese Arabic, French and English - is common and normal among Beirut residents. The use of all three languages crosses between the city's different sects and geography, and are a common occurrence in both the more cosmopolitan and the more conservative neighborhoods. The research found that French or English is disproportionately heard nearby Francophone or Anglophone, respectively, educational institutions. Some minorities in Beirut also speak Armenian, Aramaic, and Amharic.\n\nBeirut Central District\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country\". It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city center from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organizations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city center.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centers. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organizes music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, Fête de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality, thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticized for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.\nThe actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the businesses located there have mostly moved.\n\nEconomy\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nBeirut became a banking hub by leveraging its position as a commercial port and cultural center within the world economy. Under French mandate after World War I, France heavily invested in the city, reinforcing its role as a regional financial center. The Open Door Policy facilitated foreign capital inflows, with French firms dominating investments and four of Beirut's five leading banks being French-owned by the 1920s, after which the city further solidified its status as a key financial link between the West and the decolonizing Middle East.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one, as the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) and subsequent conflicts significantly altered the political landscape. With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favorable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking center for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban  (Lebanon's central bank), the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\nBanking and finance\nThe banking system is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.\nBeirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.\nThe Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East\",  and also \"Switzerland of the Middle East\", often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).\nThe largely pedestrianized Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouché, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighborhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area. There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.\nHamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighboring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops. However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked the 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totaling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Condé Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.\nMany of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.\nLike other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialized procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\nGovernment\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\nInternational organizations\nThe city is home to numerous international organizations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers' Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges and  the World youth alliance are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\nEducation\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes. The Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing universities, colleges, and institutes in Beirut and nationwide.\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) and Université Saint-Joseph (USJ) are the oldest English-language and French-language universities in the country, respectively. AUB was founded in 1866, and USJ in 1875. The Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to Lebanese American University (LAU), American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, École Supérieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), Notre Dame University – Louaize (NDU), and Université La Sagesse (ULS).\nAmong the private secondary schools in Beirut are Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais, Lycée Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Collège Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Collège Notre Dame de Nazareth, Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé, Collège Protestant Français, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\nTransportation\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.\nBeirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC – \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.\nThe ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.\nBeirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\nIn 2024, Ahdab Commuting and Trading Company (ACTC), alongside the Ministry of Transport, reintroduced a proper public bus system with an appropriate network of lanes using the 50 buses donated by France in 2022. \nThe network connects most areas of Beirut through 7 major lines (B1-7), as well as connecting Beirut to other major cities like Tripoli and Saida through 4 lines (ML1-4). These lines however do not replace the existing service microbuses, they complement them.\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilizations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading center of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year, it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.\nBeirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\nMuseums\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third-oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighboring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.\nPlanet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.\nIn October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a Pterodactyl, is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish'n'Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerges you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\nTourism\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey. Beirut came in first place regionally and 10th place internationally in a 2010 study by \"EuroCost International\" about the rental markets for high quality housing. Beirut is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.\nThe 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totaling $6.5 billion.

          "summary": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Beirut was severely damaged by the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2020 massive explosion in the Port of Beirut, and was subsequently rebuilt after each of these events. Its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades.",

          "content": "بَيْرُوت هي العاصمة السياسية للجمهورية اللبنانية وأكبر مدنها. يتعدى عدد سكانها المليوني نسمة بحسب أحد إحصائيات سنة 2007. تقع وسط الخط الساحلي اللبناني شرقي البحر الأبيض المتوسط. تتركَز فيها معظم المرافق الحيوية من صناعة وتجارة وخدمات. وهي مدينة قديمة وعريقة إذ ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنة والمؤرخة إلى القرن الخامس عشر ما قبل الميلاد وهي مأهولة منذ ذلك الحين.\nبيروت هي مركز الثقل السياسي اللبناني حيث مقر معظم الدوائر السياسية مثل البرلمان ورئاسة الحكومة بالإضافة لمراكز معظم الوزارات والدوائر الحكومية. تلعب الدور الرئيسي في الحركة الاقتصادية اللبنانية. وتعد المدينة إحدى أهم المؤثرات الثقافية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط والوطن العربي لغناها بالأنشطة الثقافية مثل الصحافة الحرة والمسارح ودور النشر ومعارض الفنون والمتاحف وعدد كبير من الجامعات الدولية.\nمرت المدينة بالعديد من الكوارث من زلازل وحروب على مر التاريخ كان أهمها الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية المدمرة. وبعد انتهاء الحرب سنة 1990، أعادت الدولة في عهد حكومة رئيس وزراء لبنان آنذاك رفيق الحريري إعمار وتأهيل المدينة وبخاصة وسطها التجاري وواجهتها البحرية وملاهيها الليلية مما أعاد تألق سياحتها وجعلها مقصداً سياحياً جذاباً. قامت صحيفة النيويورك تايمز بمنح بيروت المركز الأول بين قائمة الأماكن التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنة 2009، كما صُنّفت ضمن المدن العشرة الأوائل الأكثر حيوية في عام 2009 بواسطة دليل لونلي بلانت السياحي. وفي عام 2020، مرّت بيروت بكارثة أُخرى حيث حصلَ انفجار ضخم في مرفأ المدينة مما خلف عشرات القتلى وآلاف الجرحى وتسبب بدمار كبير في عدد من أحيائها نتج عنه نزوح 300 ألف مواطن لبناني.\nكشف مؤشر «ماستر كارد» لعام 2011، أن بيروت استأثرت بالمركز الثاني من حيث نسبة البذخ السياحي بين جميع مدن الشرق الأوسط وأفريقيا. أما المركز الأول فاحتلته دبي، التي بلغ مقدار ما صرفه فيها السوّاح حوالي 7.8 مليار دولار، تليها بيروت مباشرة بحوالي 6.5 مليارات دولار، ثم تل أبيب بحوالي 3.8 مليارات، ثم القاهرة (3.7 مليارات دولار)، فجوهانسبرغ (3.3 مليارات دولار). كذلك وُضعت بيروت في المرتبة التاسعة بين قائمة أكثر المدن زيارةً في العالم.\n\nالتسمية\nأقدم ذكر عبر الوثائق التاريخية لاسم بيروت ورد بلفظ «بيروتا» في ألواح تل العمارنة التي وجدت في مصر، والتي تحوي مراسلات تمت بين ملوك جبيل والفرعون امينوفيس الرابع المعروف بأخناتون (مطلع القرن الرابع عشر ق.م.) ورد فيها اسم «بيروتا» وملكها «عمونيرا». سماها الفنيقيون «بيريت» ँ‌ऀ‌ओ‌क وهي كلمة فينيقية تعني الآبار. وقيل أنها كانت تدعى\n«بيريتيس» أو «بيروتوس» أو «بيرُووَه» نسبة للإلهة «بيروت»، أعز آلهة لبنان وصاحبة أدونيس إله جبيل. وعُرفت المدينة باسم «بيريتوس» (باليونانية القديمة:βηρυτός) في الأدبيات الإغريقية. واعتمد هذا الاسم في دوريات الآثار المنشورة في الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت منذ 1934.\nوذكر أن «بيروت» بالمعنى السامي تعني «الصنوبر» لغابات الصنوبر، بسبب وقوعها بالقرب من غابة صنوبر كبيرة هي اليوم ما يُعرف بحرش أو حرج بيروت. ومن الأسماء الأخرى التي دعيت بها منطقة بيروت هو: «لاذقية كنعان»، «مستوطنة جوليا أغسطس بيريتوس السعيدة»، «دربي»، «رديدون»، «باروت». ولقبت المدينة عبر العصور بالعديد من الألقاب منها: سماها الفينيقيون «بالمدينة الإلهة» و«بيروت الأبيّة والمجيدة» لعنادها في مقارعة مدينة «صيدون» و«زهرة الشرق»، وأطلق عليها الرومان «أم الشرائع» بسبب بناء أكبر معهد للقانون بالإمبراطورية فيها. ونعتها العثمانيون «بالدرة الغالية». في العصر الحديث خلدها نزار قباني بلقب «ست الدنيا». وعرفت أيضا باسم «باريس الشرق» خلال فترة الستينات وأوائل السبعينات من القرن العشرين، أي خلال عهد الازدهار الاقتصادي في لبنان.\n\nتاريخ بيروت\nيعود تاريخ بيروت إلى أكثر من 5000 عام. تدل أعمال الحفريات الأثرية في وسط بيروت على تنوع الحضارات التي مرت على المدينة، فقد عُثر على طبقات متعددة من الآثار الفينيقية والهيلينية والرومانية والعربية والعثمانية التي تبعد عن بعضها بمسافة ضئيلة.\n\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nاكتشف الباحثون وعلماء الآثار عدّة مواقع أثرية تقع ضمن حدود المناطق التي تُشكّل مدينة بيروت المعاصرة، وكان معظم هذه المواقع يحتوي على أدوات صوّانية تعود لعهود متعاقبة تبدأ من العصرين الحجريين: القديم الوسيط والقديم العلوي، مرورًا بالعصر الحجري الحديث ووصولاً إلى العصر البرونزي. أما أبرز هذه المواقع فهي:\n\nموقع ميناء الحصن: وصفه الباحثون بأنه «قرية بيروتيّة»، ويُرجّح أن موقع الأصلي كان على شاطئ البحر بالقرب من فندقيّ الشرق وبسول، في الجادّة الفرنسية المعروفة محليًا باسم «شارع الفرنساوية». اكتُشف الموقع في سنة 1894، ودُرس لأول مرة على يد أحد الآباء اليسوعيين في سنة 1900. وُصفت الأدوات الصوانية التي عُثر عليها في الموقع بأنها موستيرية، وقد احتفظ بها متحف الفنون الجميلة في ليون.\nموقع أم الخطيب: يقع شمال منطقة الطريق الجديدة الحالية، وعُثر فيه على أدوات صوّانية ترجع للعصر النحاسي. تدمّر هذا الموقع بعد أن شُيدت عليه مبان في سنة 1948.\nموقع فرن الشبّاك: يقع على الضفة اليسرى من نهر بيروت، حيث تنتهي حدود المدينة. كانت المنطقة مغطاة سابقًا بالرمال الحمراء التي شكّلت مصاطبًا للنهر ترجع للعصر الرباعي. عثرت مجموعة من الآباء اليسوعيين على هذا الموقع، واكتشفوا فيه عدد كبير من الأدوات الصوّانية التي تعود للعصر الحجري القديم الوسيط، وقد كان معظمها مغروسًا في الرمال على ضفة النهر. شملت المكتشفات حوالي 50 أداة قطع تعود للفترة الأشولينية، يحتفظ بها اليوم المتحف اللبناني للآثار القبتاريخية.\nموقع نهر بيروت: قيل بأنه وقع في بستان لأشجار التوت على الضفة اليسرى للنهر بالقرب من خط سكة الحديد المتوجهة إلى طرابلس. اكتشف في هذا الموقع عدّة بقايا لرماح وحجارة صوّانية مسننة وعظام مدفونة وسط الطمي. وقد شُيّدت عليه مبان في الوقت الحالي.\nكما عُثر في مواقع أخرى، أهمها موقعا البطركيّة والبرج، على بقايا فؤوس قديمة، وعلى قبور تعود لأواسط العصر البرونزي، في المنطقة الأخيرة، مما دفع الباحثين للقول أن «تل» بيروت القديم، أو المستعمرة البشرية الرئيسيّة، كانت تقوم في ذاك المكان.\n\nالعصور القديمة\nبُنيت بيروت من قبل أهل جبيل (بيبلوس) قبل أربعة آلاف سنة، وما لبثت أن كبرت وعمرت بالسكان وأصبحت مملكة مستقلة على الساحل الذي كان يُعرف باسم فينيقيا وعبد أهلها إلها خاصاً بها اسمه «بعل بيريت» أي إله أو سيّد بيروت، وضربت باسمها عملة نقديّة تحمل رسماً يمثل هذا الإله. وأول إشارة لمدينة بيروت تعود للقرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد حيث ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنة المسمارية التي ذكرت عن «عمونيرا» ملك «بيريت». الذي أرسل ثلاث رسائل إلى الفرعون المصري. كما ذكرت «بيريت» في رسائل «رب حدا» ملك جبيل. وأنشئت أول مستوطناتها على جزيرة وسط نهرها التي طُمرت عبر الأزمان.\nخضعت بيروت لحكم المصريين بعد أن قام الفرعون تحتموس الثالث باحتلال الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط أثناء طرده للهكسوس من مصر، وبعد المصريين قام كل من الآشوريين والكلدانيين والفرس بالسيطرة على فينيقيا ومنها بيروت، قبل أن يهزم الإسكندر الأكبر الفرس ويضم المدينة لإمبراطوريته. وفي سنة 140ق.م احتلها ودمرها «ديودوتوس تريفون»، الملك الهيليني، خلال صراعه مع «أنيوخس السابع» للسيطرة على عرش الدولة السلوقية. ومن ثم أعيد بناؤها على الطراز الهيليني وسميت «لاوديسيا الفينيقية» (باليونانية: Λαοδικεια ή του Φοινίκη) وفي بعض الأحيان «لاوديسيا الكنعانية». تقع المدينة اليوم على أنقاض تلك التي بناها اليونان، كما أظهرت الحفريات التي أعيد العمل بها بعد انتهاء الحرب الأهلية سنة 1991. وتشير إحدى الحفريات من سنة 1994 إلى أن شارع «سوق الطويلة» الحديث هو تطور لشارع هيليني أو روماني قديم.\n\nواحتل بيروت الجنرال الروماني ماركوس أغريبا في عام 64 ق.م. وسماها «مستوطنة جوليا أغسطس بيريتوس السعيدة» (باللاتينية: Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus) تيمنا بجوليا بنت الإمبراطور أغسطس ونظرا لأهمية المدينة تمركز فيها الفيلقان الرومانيان: المقدوني الخامس، والغالي الثالث مما حولها إلى جزء من الإمبراطورية الرومانية وبالتالي تمّ تعميرها وفقا للنمط المعماري الروماني، فبُنيت فيها الأبنية، من هياكل ومسارح وحمامات، ومؤسسات حكوميّة فخمة.\nعرفت المدينة أزهى أيامها خلال عهد هيرودوس فأصبحت مدينة رومانية كاملة الحقوق في سنة 14 ق.م، ومنحت لقب المستمعرة الممتازة. اشتهرت بيروت تحت الحكم الروماني بمدرسة القانون والتي استمرت بتدريس الحقوق لأكثر من 300 عام، وكانت في ذلك العهد مرجعاً لطلاب العلم من الوطنيين والأجانب. وهي المدرسة التي أكسبت المدينة في ذلك الحين للقب «أم الشرائع ومرضعة العلوم». من أشهر مدرسيها الحقوقيين الفينيقيين «بابينيانوس» و«أولبيانوس»، الذين اشتهرا خلال حكم الأباطرة السيفريين، والذي كان عملهما أساس قانون جستنيان الأول المعروف «بالبندكتس». دُمرت المدرسة نتيجةً لموجة الزلازل التي ضربت بيروت في سنة551 للميلاد، فنقل طلابها إلى مدينة صيدون. وقتل الزلزال 30,000 بيروتي و250,000 من سكان الساحل الفينيقي، الأمر الذي أفقد بيروت أهميتها خلال السنين المتبقية لها تحت حكم الروم البيزنطينين.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nبعد حوالي مائة سنة من دمار المدينة، أي خلال سنة 635م، فتحها العرب بقيادة معاوية بن أبي سفيان في زمن خلافة عمر بن الخطاب ثاني الخلفاء الراشدين الذي أمر بترميمها وتحصينها بالقلاع لحمايتها من هجمات الروم الذين حاولوا عبثاً استعادتها عدة مرات. وفي تلك الفترة لم تحظ بيروت بشهرة كبيرة وأهمية تذكر مثل تلك التي حظيت بها مدينة عكا كمركز تجاري في شرقي البحر المتوسط.\nعندما ارتقى معاوية بن أبي سفيان سدة الخلافة الإسلاميّة جلب إلى بيروت قوماً من الفرس وأسكنهم فيها مثلما فعل بغيرها من مدن الساحل الشامي وبعلبك. كانت المدينة خلال عهد الخلفاء الراشدين والأمويين ثم العباسيين، تابعة لدمشق، واتخذها المسلمون في العهود المذكورة رباطاً، أي قاعدة عسكريّة، ومنها انطلقت الجيوش العربيّة التي حملها معاوية على الأسطول الذي فتح به جزيرة قبرص أيام عثمان بن عفان. وفي أيام أبي جعفر المنصور، ثاني الخلفاء العباسيين، ظهر فيها عدد من العلماء البارزين أهمهم عبد الرحمن الأَوزاعي، المعروف باسم «الإمام الأوزاعي» المتوفى سنة 773، وقبره ما يزال موجوداً بالقرب منها عند الجهة الجنوبيّة على ساحل البحر، في منطقة أصبحت تحمل اسمه، وهذا القبر كان وما يزال مقصداً للناس الذين يزورونه ويتبركون به. استعاد ملك البيزنطيين «يوحنا زيميسياس» بيروت عام 974 ولبث فيها نحو سنة، ثم أخرجته منها القوات المصريّة التي أرسبها جوهر الصقلي في أيام العبيديين حكّام مصر في ذلك الحين، وفي زمنهم كانت هذه المدينة تابعة لدمشق المرتبطة رأساً بالقاهرة حاضرة الخلافة العبيديّة يومذاك.\n\nهاجمت جيوش الصليبيين بيروت سنة 1102، بالرغم من أنها لم تكن مهمة في ذلك الوقت، لكنها امتنعت عليهم وصدتهم، فلما كانت سنة 1110 أعادت هذه الجيوش الكرّة عليها بقيادة «بغدوين الأول» وتمكنت من احتلالها. وبقي الصليبيون في المدينة حتى سنة 1291، وكانت في تلك الفترة تابعة لمملكة بيت المقدس وقد اعتمد ازدهارها في ذلك الوقت على حركة تبادلها التجاري مع أوروبا في البهارات. ومن أشهر القواد الصليبيين الذين حكموا بيروت، «يوحنا الأول سيد إبلين»، الملقب «بسيد بيروت العجوز» (1179–1236) الذي قام بترميم المدينة بعد المعارك المتعددة مع صلاح الدين الأيوبي، كما بنى قصر آل إبلين فيها. استعاد صلاح الدين الأيوبي بيروت في سنة 1187، لكنها عادت إلى الصليبيين بعد حوالي عشرة أعوام، وبعد أن زالت الدولة الأيوبية وحلت مكانها دولة المماليك أرسل الملك الأشرف خليل ابن الملك قلاوون الصالحي جيشاً كبيراً إلى المدينة فاستعادها وجعلها تابعة لنيابة طرابلس الشام التي كانت مرتبطة رأساً بالقاهرة مقر السلطة المملوكيّة آنذاك.\n\nالعصور الحديثة\nفي سنة 1516 تغلب السلطان سليم الأول العُثماني على قنصوه الغوري سلطان المماليك وقضى عليه في معركة مرج دابق شمالي حلب، وتابع زحفه حتى احتل جميع بلاد الشام، ومن ذلك الحين دخلت بيروت في حوزة الدولة العثمانية وكان أول حاكم عُثماني فيها محمد بن قرقماز (قرقماز أوغلو) وهو جركسي. حُكمت المدينة من قبل الأمراء الدروز،  تارة من بني عسّاف وتارة من بني سيفا، ابتداءً من القرن السادس عشر، وفي تلك الفترة كانت بيروت مجرد قرية عادية، بعد أن قل فيها التجار وضعفت الأعمال الصناعية، والمهن البحرية، كالصيد وصناعة السفن وترميمها وتزويدها بالمؤن، وذلك إما لانتشار القراصنة في البحر المتوسط في ذلك الوقت، أو لانصراف الكثير من القوافل البحرية إلى الدوران حول إفريقيا عن طريق رأس الرجاء الصالح الذي اكتشف سنة 1498، فتحولت بذلك طريق التجارة مع الهند إليه بدلا من المرافئ اللبنانية. وفي السنوات العشر الأخيرة من القرن السادس عشر للميلاد، تغلب الأمير فخر الدين بن معن على الأمير يوسف بن سيفا الذي كان حاكماً على مدينة طرابلس وبلاد كسروان ومدينة بيروت وانتزع منه المقاطعة الكسروانيّة وبيروت وطرد من هذه المدينة الآغا الذي كان متسلماً عليها من طرف ابن سيفا. وقام فخر الدين خلال القرن السابع عشر بالاعتناء بعمران المدينة بشكل كبير، فازدهرت وانفتحت على أوروبا في أيامه، ومن المعالم التي أنشأها: البرج الذي عُرف فيما بعد باسم برج الكشاف، لأنه أستُعمل مرقباً لاستكشاف المراكب المعادية التي تحاول الإغارة على البلد، وإليه تنسب ساحة البرج الواقعة في الجهة الشرقية منه، والتي أصبحت تعرف اليوم بساحة الشهداء أو ساحة الحرية، وكذلك أنشأ الأمير قصراً له في بيروت بالاستعانة بخبرات بعض المهندسين الإيطاليين، وحديقة للحيوانات، وقام بزيادة عدد أشجار الصنوبر في حرج بيروت وتنسيق تلك الموجودة. وبعد زوال الإمارة المعنية عادت بيروت لتتبع ولاية طرابلس من جديد.\n\nفي السنوات الأخيرة من القرن الثامن عشر شهدت بيروت صراعاً شديداً بين حاكمها الشهابي الأمير يوسف وبين أحد أتباعه أحمد باشا الجزار، عندما كان كل منهما يحاول الاستئثار بها وتعرضت خلال هذا الصراع لاحتلالها من قبل أميرال البحر «سبنسكوف» الروسي، الذي كان يقوم بأعمال القرصنة في المياه العثمانيّة لحساب إمبراطورة روسيا كاترين الثانية، فلقد نصّب هذا القرصان مدافع في سهلات البرج ليتمكن من ضرب سور المدينة من قرب، ولهذا السبب أطلق الإفرنج على هذه السهلات اسم «ساحة المدفع»، ولكن احتلال الروس انتهى بعد شهور قليلة بعد أن دفعت لهم المدينة غرامة قدرها 25 ألف ريال بعملة ذلك الزمان. فعاد إليها الجزار وقبض على سيده السابق الأمير يوسف الشهابي بمعاونة ابن أخ الأخير، الأمير بشير الثاني الشهابي المشهور بالمالطي، وأعدمه سنة 1790 في مدينة عكا. في أيام الجزار مُنع الشهابيون من الإقامة في بيروت، وهُدمت بيوتهم التي كانت فيها، كما مُنع أهل جبل لبنان من السكن في هذه المدينة التي ألحقها الوالي المذكور بمدينة عكا التي اتخذها مركزاً له باسم ولاية عكا. والجزار هو الذي بنى السور الذي كان يحيط بيروت من كافة أطرافها ومنع الناس من السكن خارجه، فسجل انخفاض في عدد سكان المدينة إلى 8,000 نسمة في تلك الفترة، وبقي هذا المنع سارياً حتى سنة 1832، ففي هذه السنة اقتحمها إبراهيم باشا بن محمد علي باشا وهدم السور وأباح بناء المساكن خارجه، فعاد لبيروت دورها المهم مرة أخرى.\nبقيت بيروت تحت الحكم المصري من سنة 1832 حتى 1841 وهي المدة التي بقيت فيها بلاد الشام في حوزة إبراهيم باشا. وفي هذه الفترة عرفت هذه المدينة تطوراً أساسيًا شمل سائر مرافقها العُمرانيّة والإداريّة، ونما عدد سكانها يومئذٍ من 8 آلاف نسمة إلى 15 ألفاً، وذلك بسبب امتداد رقعتها إلى خارج السور الذي أمر إبراهيم باشا بهدمه وسمح للناس ببناء مساكنهم في الضواحي التي أصبحت فيما بعد جزءاً من المدينة نفسها، كما ازدهرت أحوالها التجاريّة بسبب اختيارها مركزاً للحجر الصحي، الأمر الذي أجبر جميع القادمين إلى الشام على الخضوع له للتأكد من سلامتهم الصحيّة وخلوهم من الأمراض المعديّة. وخلال عهد المصريين كان حاكم بيروت هو القائد في الجيش المصري سليمان باشا الفرنساوي. في سنة 1841 تمكنت الدولة العُثمانيّة من استعادة سيطرتها على بلاد الشام، فقاموا بنقل كرسي الولاية إليها وعيّنوا عليها والياً من قبلهم اسمه سليم باشا. وفي عهد هذا الوالي بدأت بيروت بالازدهار فازدادت عماراً وسكاناً، وانتقلت إليها تجارة الإفرنج، وعظم شأنها، وكثر مجيء المراكب الأوروبيّة إليها. وخلال أحداث 1860 بين الدروز والمسيحيين، لجأ الكثير من الموارنة النصارى إلى بيروت هربا من المذابح في جبل لبنان ودمشق.\n\nخلال منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ازداد سكان بيروت وتوسعت المدينة لتتخطى أسوارها. وفي خضم هذا التوسع قامت الإرساليات الغربية ومفكرو العالم العربي بتكوين المدينة. وأصبحت مركز الثقافة والفكر العربي ومركز تنوع عالمي بوجود الأوروبيين والأميركيين. فشركة المياه كانت بريطانية وشركة إمداد الغاز كانت فرنسية فيما أنشأ الأميركيون المدارس والجامعات ومن أشهرها الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت. واشتهرت فيها صناعات وتجارة الحرير. كما أنشأ الفرنسيون مرفأ بحريا عصريا في سنة 1894 ومدوا سكك الحديد بين بيروت ودمشق وحلب في سنة 1907. وكانت السفن الفرنسية تنقل البضائع بين بيروت ومارسيليا وسرعان ما أصبح للفرنسيين تأثير أكبر من أي دولة غربية أخرى، وفي تلك الفترة أخذ السكان يقتدون بالأوروبين في بعض نواحي عيشهم وفي ملبسهم. ونشرت موسوعة بريتانيكا أن توزيع سكان بيروت في سنة 1911 كان كالتالي: مسلمون (36,000 نسمة)، مسيحيون (77,000 نسمة)، يهود (2,500 نسمة)، دروز (400 نسمة)، أجانب (4,100 نسمة).\n\nالمرحلة المعاصرة\nخلال الحرب العالمية الأولى عصفت المجاعة والأمراض بجبل لبنان نتيجة لبعض التدابير العثمانية الضارة، وبسبب مجريات الحرب، وكنتيجة لهذا لجأ الكثير من أبناء الجبل إلى بيروت للحصول على لقمة عيشهم، وفي تلك الفترة قام بعض الوجهاء البيروتيين بتأسيس بعض الجمعيات التي أخذت على عاتقها تقديم المساعدات والإغاثات للجبليين مما خفف من وطأة الحرب عليهم. وبتاريخ 8 أكتوبر 1918 سقطت المدينة من العثمانيين ووقعت بأيدي قوات الحلفاء بقيادة الجنرال إدموند ألنبي. وأعلنت عصبة الأمم بيروت خاضعة للانتداب الفرنسي مع بقية مناطق جبل لبنان، البقاع وسوريا الكبرى. ثم أعلنها الفرنسيون في 1920 عاصمة لدولة لبنان الكبير، والتي أصبحت الجمهورية اللبنانية في سنة 1926 ولكن لم تنل استقلالها إلا في سنة 1943. وازدهرت بيروت خلال فترة الاستقلال وأصبحت نقطة استقطاب ثقافي واقتصادي لكل محيطها. فأصبحت بمثابة البلد الثاني أو المصيف للعديد من مواطني العالم العربي. وشهدت بيروت اضطرابات لفترة بسيطة سنة 1958 زمن الرئيس كميل شمعون بسبب الصراع حول حلف بغداد، وخلال فترة الستينات من القرن العشرين أصبحت المدينة تعرف باسم «باريس الشرق». وبعد حرب 1967 مع إسرائيل، أصبحت بيروت مركزاً أساسياً للفدائيين الفلسطينيين الذين حاربوا الأخيرة.\n\nسنوات الحرب الأهلية\nوفي العام 1975 اندلعت الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية وقسمت المدينة إلى شطرين: شرقي مسيحي، وغربي مسلم، وعم المدينة الخراب والفوضى. وقام الجيش الإسرائيلي في سنة 1978 باجتياح لبنان واحتلال أراضيه من الجنوب حتى نهر الليطاني في عملية أعطاها الجيش الإسرائيلي اسم هذا النهر ثم توسع الاحتلال في لبنان بعد العدوان الإسرائيلي الثاني في سنة 1982 ليصل مشارف العاصمة ويحاصرها. وفي سنة 1983 تمّ تفجير الثكنات العسكرية الفرنسية والأميركية في المدينة. وفي سنة 1990 استقر الوضع في لبنان وتوحدت بيروت وعادت إليها حركة العمران بسرعة لتعود مركزا تجارياً وثقافياً مهماً للمنطقة العربية من جديد بجهود جبارة من رئيس الوزراء اللبناني الأسبق رفيق الحريري.\nبعد اتفاق الطائف وانتهاء الحرب اللبنانية ومع تولي الرئيس رفيق الحريري الحكومة بدأ إعمار بيروت وإعادتها مجدداً إلى الساحة الدولية، فبدأ بإعمار وسط بيروت التي قامت شركة سوليدير ببنائه، وغدت بيروت مجدداً باريس الشرق حتى سنة 2005.\n\nاغتيال رفيق الحريري - الآن\nاغتيل رفيق الحريري بتاريخ 14 فبراير سنة 2005، بانفجار عبوة ناسفة كانت مزروعة على طريق خليج السان جورج حيث كان موكبه يعبر، وأسفر الانفجار عن أضرار جسيمة لحقت بالمباني المجاورة، وعن مقتل عدد من رفاق الحريري وعدد من المارّة. وفور ذيوع خبر وفاة الحريري سارت مظاهرات في عدد من شوارع بيروت أطلق فيها المتظاهرون شعارات ضد رئيس الجمهورية إميل لحود ورئيس الحكومة عمر كرامي والنظام السوري ممثلاً بالرئيس بشار الأسد، وعقد أطراف المعارضة اللبنانية اجتماعًا في دارة الحريري خلص إلى تحميل السلطة اللبنانية والسلطة السورية «بصفتها سلطة الوصاية» المسؤولية عن الجريمة. ودعا المجتمعون إلى رحيل السلطة القائمة وانسحاب القوات السورية بالكامل قبل الانتخابات، وأعلنوا عن إضراب شامل لثلاثة أيام. شكّل اغتيال رفيق الحريري بداية لسلسلة من الاغتيالات التي طالت سياسيين لبنانيين يعارضون الوجود السوري في البلاد، وقد اعتصمت القوى السياسية المعارضة في وسط بيروت التجاري طيلة شهران، أغلقت خلالها الكثير من المصالح، إلى أن انصاع رئيس الحكومة عمر كرامي، وتنحى عن منصبه، ثم تلا ذلك انسحبًا للجيش السوري من لبنان بتاريخ 26 أبريل تحت ضغط مظاهرات مناصري ما عرف لاحقًا بتحالف 14 آذار وقرار الأمم المتحدة رقم 1559. بعد انسحاب الجيش السوري حصلت عدّة مجادلات سياسية بين السلطة والمعارضة. وتخلل ذلك عدوان إسرائيلي في يوليو 2006 دُمرت خلاله البنية التحتية اللبنانية.\nوفي 7 أيار 2008، قام مسلحو المعارضة في لبنان من حزب الله وحركة أمل والحزب القومي السوري بالسيطرة على بيروت كردّ فعل على اتخاذ الحكومة قراراً بتفكيك شبكة الاتصالات الخاصة بالمقاومة وبعزل مدير مطار بيروت الدولي حيث اعتبرت المعارضة هذا القرار خرقًا للبيان الوزاري القاضي بدعم المقاومة في مواجهة الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. وتلا هذه العملية اتفاق في مدينة الدوحة أدى إلى إخلاء وسط بيروت من مظاهر الإضراب وأعاد الثقة بالسياحة اللبنانية. وبتاريخ 18 أكتوبر 2008 تبادل لبنان وسوريا السفراء لأول مرة في تاريخهما.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيروت على شبه جزيرة تتجه لناحية الغرب نحو البحر المتوسط، على بعد 94 كيلومتر (58 ميل) من شمال الحدود الفلسطينية اللبنانية. يحد المدينة من الشرق سلسلة جبال لبنان الغربية؛ وهي تتخذ شكلا مثلثا، بسبب وقوعها بين وعلى تلتين: تل الأشرفية وتل المصيطبة.\nتبلغ مساحة محافظة بيروت 18 كم² (6.9 ميل مربّع)، بينما تبلغ مساحة التجمع الحضري للمدينة 67 كم² (26 ميل مربّع).يعتبر الشاطئ البحري لبيروت متنوعا، فهو صخري في شمال المدينة، ورملي في جنوبها، وفي بعض الأقسام من الشمال يكون الشاطئ عبارة عن أجراف صخرية مرتفعة، كذلك فإن هذه النماذج جميعها يمكن أن تندمج سويا في بعض الأماكن، مثل نقطة التقاء شاطئ الروشة بشاطئ الرملة البيضاء.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في بيروت معتدل إجمالا، إذ يسود المناخ المتوسطي المتمثل بفصل صيف حار عالي الرطوبة، وربيع وخريف معتدلين، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يعتبر أغسطس أكثر شهور السنة حرّا، حيث يمكن أن يصل معدل الحرارة إلى 29 ° مئوية (84 ° فهرنهايت)، كما يعتبر شهرا يناير وفبراير أكثرها برودةً، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحرارة في الشهر إلى 10 ° مئوية (50 ° فهرنهايت). يكون اتجاه الرياح غربيّا خلال فترة بعد الظهر والمساء، أي أنه يهب من البحر إلى اليابسة، أما في الليل، يتغير الاتجاه إلى الشرق، أي إنه يهب من اليابسة نحو البحر.\nيبلغ معدل الأمطار السنوية في بيروت 860 ميليمتر (34.1 إنش) والتي يتساقط معظمها خلال أشهر الشتاء، والقليل منها يتساقط في الخريف والربيع. تتساقط معظم الأمطار خلال عدد محدود من الأيام بشكل كثيف في العادة، أما الثلج فيندر أن يتساقط في بيروت، وبحال تساقط فإنه لا يتراكم، ويُستثنى من ذلك شتاء السنوات 1920، 1942، و1950، حيث هبّت ثلاث عواصف ثلجية كبيرة على لبنان أدت إلى هطول الثلوج على الساحل.\n\nمناطق بيروت\nتُقسم بيروت إلى 12 حيّاً معترفاً به:\n\nالأشرفية: عُرفت بهذا الاسم منذ حوالي سبعمائة سنة، أطلقت بعض النصوص عليها اسم «مزرعة الأشرفية»، وقد سُميت بذلك تيمنًا بالسلطان المملوكي الأشرف صلاح الدين خليل. تقع على الهضبة الشرقية البيروتيّة، وتشتهر بأنها منطقة راقية.\nعين المريسة: يرجع أصل اسمها إلى «الريّسة»، أي المرسى الصغير بصيغة «المرسة»، أي قطعة من الحبل، والعين التي هي الينبوع الصغير الذي يصب بالبحر.\nالباشورة: إحدى أقدم المناطق في بيروت، يرتقي عهدها إلى عصر الخليفة المنصور، وقد اشتهرت بوجود المقبرة الإسلامية فيها التي تفصل نحلة السور بينها وبين بيروت القديمة. يعني اسمها: البرج المتعالي الذي يقع على مدخل القلاع والمدن.\nميناء الحصن: في الأساس كانت تُدعى «ميناء الحسن»، ثم حُرفت مع الوقت فصارت السين تُلفظ صادًا. يُحتمل أنها حملت هذا الاسم لوجود برج حصن بيروت في المنطقة في قديم الزمان.\nالمزرعة: تيمنًا بالمزارع التي كانت قائمة بها قديمًا وأبرزها مزارع الحمضيات من ليمون وبرتقال.\nالمدوّر: تيمنًا بإحدى العائلات البيروتية.\nالمصيطبة: أصل الاسم يرجع إلى «مسطبة بيدمر»، كانت بريّة تقع خارج أسوار بيروت القديمة لحين تحرير المماليك للساحل الشامي من الصليبيين، فحينها أمر السلطان الأشرف صلاح الدين خليل، أمر بتحويل بيروت إلى قاعدة بحرية والانطلاق منها لاستعادة قبرص. فبدأ قادة الجيش والجند يستقرون في تلك المنطقة الخالية، ومع مرور الوقت استحالت قرية بحد ذاتها قبل أن تلتحم مع بيروت.\nالمرفأ: تيمنًا بمرفأ المدينة القديم الذي ما زال قائمًا في هذه المنطقة.\nرأس بيروت: كانت منطقة مقفرة من السكان، ولم يقطنها إلا بعض المزارعين الذين كانوا يتعاطون زراعة التين والصبار. سًميت كذلك لأن قسمًا منها، وهو القسم الذي يدخل البحر، يشبه الرأس في تكوينه. أخذت المنطقة تصبح آهلة بالسكان بعد بناء الكلية السورية الإنجيلية عام 1865، وعدد من المعاهد والكليّات الأجنبية، فتوافد البيارتة القدماء عليها، واستقروا هناك، وما لبث أن استقطبت المنطقة عدد من الأجانب أيضًا الذين اختلطوا مع أهل المدينة الأصليين.\nالرميل: إحدى الأحياء القديمة في المدينة، كان حيًا شعبيًا في بادئ الأمر قبل أن ينمو ويستحيل منطقة أرستقراطية، خاصة بعد إعادة بناءه عند انتهاء الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية.\nالصيفي: يشتهر هذا الحي بمطاعمه ومقاهيه عربية الطابع، ونزله القديم التي تعود للعهدين العثماني والفرنسي، ومرابعه ونواديه الليلية الحديثة.\nزقاق البلاط: أحد الأحياء المستحدثة في القرن التاسع عشر، بعد تطوّر مدينة بيروت واستحداثها عاصمة ولاية. سُمي كذلك تيمنًا بزقاق طويل رُصفت أرضه بالبلاط. كان هذا الحي ذو طابع أرستقراطي، إذ قطنه البيارتة الميسورين والموظفين الحكوميين العثمانيين من أتراك وشركس وأرمن، أما اليوم فيُعد حيًا شعبيًا ذو طابع تراثي. تميز هذا الحي وما زال بتنوعه العرقي والطائفي، فالكثير من سكانه ذوي جذور عربية، وبعضهم تركي وكردي وأرمني الأصل، وأغلب السكّان مسلمون يتبعون المذهبين السني والشيعي، وهناك قسم من السكان مسيحي يتبع كنيستيّ الروم والأرمن الأرثوذكس، وكان هناك وجود في السابق لعدة أسر يهودية.\nويُقسّم كل من هذه الأحياء إلى مناطق عقارية متعددة. تقع ثلاثة مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين في بيروت من أصل 12 مخيما رسميا في لبنان، وهذه المخيمات هي: مخيم برج البراجنة، مخيم شاتيلا، ومخيم مار الياس، وجميعها تقع جنوبي المدينة. ومن بين الخمس عشر مخيمًا الغير رسميّة في لبنان، فإن واحد منها منها، وهو مخيم صبرا، يقع في بيروت، بالقرب من مخيم شاتيلا.\n\nسكان بيروت\nتختلف تقديرات عدد سكان بيروت بشكل واسع، فهي تصل بحسب بعض الإحصاءات إلى 938,940 نسمة، بينما تصل بالنسبة لإحصاءات أخرى إلى 1,303,129 نسمة، وإلى 2,012,000 نسمة بالنسبة للبعض الآخر. إن غياب العدد الصحيح لسكان بيروت يعود إلى أنه لم يتم أي تعداد رسمي للسكان في لبنان منذ سنة 1932.\n\nالتركيبة العرقيّة\nتُعد بيروت، كغيرها من مدن بلاد الشام الكبرى، مدينة ذات مزيج عرقي كبير، يظهر جليًا في أسماء وألقاب العائلات والأسر التي تقطنها حاليًا. وسبب هذا المزيج هو الشعوب المختلفة التي مرّت على الشام ككل، واستقر البعض منها واختلط مع أبناء البلاد، لكن على الرغم من ذلك يبقى واضحًا طغيان عنصر معيّن على بقيّة العناصر، فغالبية البيارتة من مسلمين ومسيحيين، هم من أصول عربية سواء من توطن منهم فيها قبل الفتح الإسلامي، أو في ظل تلك الفتوح، كما شهدت بيروت موجات جديدة من الهجرات العربية سواء من المشرق العربي أو من المغرب العربي. وقد شهد عهدا الخلافة العربية بما فيها العهد الفاطمي والزنكي والأيوبي والمملوكي والصليبي هجرة الكثير من الأعاجم واستقرارهم في بيروت، وكذلك كان الحال في عهد الخلافة العثمانية. كما شهدت القرون السابقة والقرن العشرين العديد من النزوح من المناطق اللبنانية إلى بيروت خاصةً.\n\nكانت بيروت قبيل الفتح الإسلامي مأهولة من قبل العرب والسريان والروم، وعندما فتح المسلمون الساحل الشامي شهدت المدينة قدوم العديد من العناصر العسكرية والمدنية التي تنتمي إلى قبائل عربية، وقد توطنت في بيروت، ومنها من حافظت على أسماء قبائلها، في حين أن البعض الآخر اتخذ أسماء جديدة هي عبارة عن ألقاب وصفات ومهن، ومن القبائل العربية التي استوطنت بيروت: بنو حزم وبنو مخزوم وبنو قيس وبنو زيدان، وسواهم، وتفرّعت منهم أسر عديدة. من أبرز أصول البيارتة المعاصرين الأصول المغربية والأندلسية، وقد بدأ المغاربة والأندلسيين يتوافدون إلى بلاد الشام ومدنها خلال العهد الصليبي، فقد انتقل آلاف المغاربة من بلادهم إلى الشام للمشاركة في الجهاد ضد الصليبيين، ووقع الكثير منهم أسرى، وقد حرص التجار والأمراء والسلاطين المسلمين على فك أسرهم نظرًا لما قدّموه من تضحيات، ومنحوهم منحًا مالية ووطنوهم في المدن وأدخلوهم في حاشيتهم. كما أن قسمًا كبيرًا منهم أتى بغرض طلب العلم. أما القسم الأعظم من المغاربة والأندلسيين، فقد وصل بيروت عقب سقوط الأندلس سنة 1492، وعقب الاحتلال الفرنسي لبلدان المغرب أواخر القرن التاسع عشر، وطرد الكثير من السكّان بهدف توطين فرنسيين بدلاً منهم. كذلك يظهر جليًا الأصل المصري لبعض العائلات البيروتية، من خلال تلقبها باسم المدينة أو البلدة التي وصلوا منها، مثل: الإسكندراني والرشيدي، والجيزي، وأغلب البيارتة ذوي الأصول المصرية وصلوا المدينة خلال عهد الحكم المصري لبلاد الشام. أما باقي الأسر البيروتية ذات الجذور العربية فأصولها عراقية وشاميّة مجاورة وحجازية ويمنية.\n\nتعرضت بيروت ومختلف بلاد الشام لموجات هجرة مدنية وعسكرية في العهود الأيوبية والمملوكية والعثمانية، خاصة وأن هذه العهود صاحبتها مجيء عشرات الآلاف من العساكر المقاتلة، بالإضافة إلى أن حكّام وسلاطين هذه العهود كانوا يعمدون إلى إسكان الجيوش بكثرة في المناطق الخاضعة لهم للدفاع عنها وصبغها بلون واحد. وبناءً على ذلك تعرضت بيروت خلال تلك العهود لهجرات وموجات سكانية تمازجت مع العائلات البيروتية القديمة وتصاهرت معها، ومن أبرز الأعاجم الذين سكنوا بيروت: الأتراك والإيرانيين والأكراد والشركس والألبان، واليونان، والأرمن. ومن هذه العائلات من احتفظ باسمه الأصلي، وأغلبها اتخذ أسماءً وألقاب جديدة تدل على أصوله مثل: الأصفهاني، والأرناؤوط (من ألبانيا)، والبوشناق، وجركس، والمورللي، والكردي، والإزمرلي، وغيرها. كذلك شهدت بيروت بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الأولى قدوم عساكر من مسلمي الهند قدموا مع الجيش البريطاني. وقد استقر بعضهم في بيروت وحملوا اسم عائلة «الهندي». أيضًا هناك قلّة نادرة من البيارتة ترجع بأصولها إلى أفريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى، وهؤلاء يتحدرون من الرقيق الأسود، الذي كانت تجارته ناشطة إلى نهاية الدولة العثمانية، ومن الجنود السنغال الذين عملوا في الجيش الفرنسي طيلة فترة الانتداب. وقد تمازج هؤلاء وتفاعلوا مع البيارتة منذ أوائل القرن العشرين، لذلك فقد ضاعوا تقريبًا في المزيج البيروتي.\n\nالتركيبة الطائفيّة\nتعتبر بيروت أكثر مدن لبنان غنى بالتنوع الديني والمذهبي، ويُحتمل أيضا أن تكون أكثر مدن الشرق الأوسط غنى بهذا التنوع، إذ أن لكل من المسلمين والمسيحيين وجود فعّال فيها. هناك 9 طوائف رئيسيّة في بيروت هي: السنّة، الشيعة، الدروز، الموارنة، الروم الأرثوذكس، الروم الكاثوليك، الأرمن الأرثوذكس، الأرمن الكاثوليك، البروتستانت. يتولى الفصل في المنازعات والقضايا الدينية، أو قضايا الأحوال الشخصية، القضاء الديني المختص بالنسبة لكل طائفة على حدى. إن المطالبة بالزواج المدني في لبنان قوبلت بالرفض من قبل رؤساء الطوائف الروحية حتى الآن، ولكن الحكومة تعترف بالزواج المدني الذي انعقد في الخارج. يعيش في بيروت حاليا عدد قليل من اليهود، ولكن في السابق كان هناك نسبة كبيرة نسبيا من اليهود تسكن في حي وادي أبو جميل بوسط بيروت، ولا يزال الكنيس اليهودي قائما هناك حتى اليوم. ومن آثار اليهود الباقية في بيروت أيضا المقبرة اليهودية الواقعة في القسم الشرقي من المدينة، والتي دُفن فيها أيضا بعض الجنود الفرنسيين الذين خدموا في لبنان أيام الانتداب.\nويتوزع سكان بيروت على الشكل التالي: مسلمون:65% (السنّة:80%، الشيعة:12%، الدروز:8%)، مسيحيون:30% (الموارنة:40%، الروم الارثوذكس:40%، الروم الكاثوليك:12%، الأرمن:8%)، أقليات ويهود:5%.\nكان للحرب الأهلية اللبنانية تأثير على ديمغرافية السكان وتوزع الطوائف في بيروت، فقبل الحرب كانت الأحياء السكنية أكثر اختلاطاً بالمذاهب المختلفة، أما اليوم فإن كل قسم من بيروت يطغى عليه طابع معين، فبيروت الشرقية أكثر سكانها مسيحيون، مع أقليّة سنيّة، بينما بيروت الغربية أكثر سكانها مسلمون سنّة، وفيها أقليّة مسيحية وشيعيّة. ويُلاحظ اليوم أن انتقال السكان المسيحيين والمسلمين من وإلى القسم الغربي والشرقي من المدينة عاد على نحو بسيط. يسكن ضاحية بيروت الجنوبية أكثرية شيعيّة، مع وجود أقليّة صغيرة من السنّة والمسيحيين. كان لبيروت تاريخ من عدم الاستقرار السياسي كنتيجة للانقسامات الطائفية، كما لعب الدين دوراً في السابق في تقسيم المجتمع اللبناني، كما يتضح من الحرب الأهلية الأخيرة.\n\nاللاجئون والعمّال\nكان الأرمن من أول اللاجئين إلى بيروت في المرحلة المعاصرة، وبدأ وصول الأرمن إلى لبنان سنة 1915 بعد ارتكاب المذابح بحقهم من قبل الأتراك، وأول منطقة سكنوها كانت منطقة الكرنتينا ومن ثم برج حمود، حيث لا يزال المتحدرين منهم يقيمون هناك حتى اليوم. كانت بيروت إحدى المدن الرئيسية في لبنان التي سكنها اللاجئون الفلسطينيون سنة 1948، كذلك هناك عدد كبير من السوريين والمصريين الذين يقطنون المدينة ويعمل معظمهم في قطاع الخدمات والبناء. وبعد الغزو الأمريكي للعراق سنة 2003، قدم لبنان حوالي 100,000 عراقي وسكن الكثير منهم في بيروت، إلا أن الحكومة أبعدت قسرا جزءاً كبيرا منهم أو قامت بسجنهم بسبب وصولهم بطريقة غير شرعية.\nبالإضافة لذلك هناك عدد كبير من المهاجرين غير العرب في بيروت مثل الأفغان، الإيرانيين، والباكستانيين، كما شهدت السنوات الأخيرة تزايدا في أعداد القادمين من الحبشة، وبلدان جنوب شرق آسيا، مثل إندونيسيا، الفلبين، ماليزيا، وسريلانكا، ويعمل هؤلاء في العادة كخدم في المنازل أو المكاتب، والبعض يُباشر أعمالا خاصة به، مثل الإيرانيين الذين يعملون إجمالا في صناعة السجاد العجمي.\n\nالخدمات الاقتصادية والتجارية والصناعية والصحية\nالاقتصادية\nتستقطب مدينة بيروت رجال الأعمال من لبنانيين وعرب وأجانب، وتتدفق إلى مصارفها تحويلات من كل أنحاء العالم. لذلك هي مركز مصرف لبنان وبورصته، وتحتل المركز المصرفي الأول في الشرق الأوسط، من هنا اتخذت مركزاً لاتحاد المصارف العربية، وساعد في ذلك السرية المصرفية التي يتبعها لبنان.\n\nالعملة والمصارف\nكان اللبنانيون عموما يتعاملون بالليرة العثمانية أيام الحكم العثماني، وكان الناس يرمزون إلى العملة باسم «العثمليّة» أو «الليرة العثمليّة»، وخلال عهد الحكم المصري في لبنان (1831-1840)، وفي السنوات اللاحقة بعده، تعامل البيروتيين بالعملة المصرية، وكانوا يرمزون إليها «بالمصرية»، ومن هذه العملة اكتسبت النقود لفظتيّ «مصاري» و«مصريات» اللتين لا تزالان تستعملان حتى اليوم في بيروت وكافة أنحاء لبنان وسوريا بمعنى نقود.\nبعد أن خضع لبنان للانتداب الفرنسي، أصدر الجنرال هنري غورو، المفوض السامي الفرنسي في سوريا ولبنان، نقدا خاصا لكلا البلدين، وقد حصر الإصدار «ببنك سوريا ولبنان»، وكان هذا المصرف فرنسيّا مقره باريس، وربطت حكومة الانتداب النقد اللبناني بالفرنك الفرنسي الذي كانت قيمته قد انخفضت كثيرا آنذاك، وجعلت الليرة وحدة العملة اللبنانية وقسمتها إلى مائة قرش، وبهذا ظهرت الليرة اللبنانية. وبعد زوال الانتداب حصلت قطيعة اقتصادية بين لبنان وسوريا بتاريخ 15 مارس 1950 بسبب تباين وجهات النظر الاقتصادية بين الدولتين، فكان هذا حافزا للحكومة اللبنانية كي تعيد تنظيم اقتصاد الدولة، فأنشأت في أوائل ستينات القرن العشرين «مصرف لبنان» أو «البنك المركزي» الذي حلّ مكان بنك سوريا ولبنان في إصدار النقد اللبناني.\n\nنشطت حركة المصارف بسبب الازدهار الاقتصادي خلال فترة الستينات وأوائل السبعينات، فبعد أن كان عدد المصارف لا يزيد عن عشرة بعد الاستقلال، ارتفع في فترة الازدهار إلى قرابة المئة، وقد اختيرت مدينة بيروت سنة 1974 مركزا لاتحاد المصارف العربية، وتشجيعا لهذا القطاع الاقتصادي، أقرت الحكومة قانون السرية المصرفية أملةً في اجتذاب الودائع الكبيرة من لبنان والبلاد العربية، وقد أعطت هذه السياسة ثمارها وظهرت نتائجها في المبالغ الطائلة التي أودعت في المصارف اللبنانية في بيروت، والتي بلغت في بعض الأوقات ما يزيد عن 6 مليارات ليرة. ومن المصارف التي تتخذ من بيروت مقرا رئيسيّا لها: بنك بيروت، بنك بلوم، بنك بيبلوس، بنك عودة، بنك لبنان والمهجر، بالإضافة لعدد من البنوك المشتركة مع بعض الدول العربية مثل البنك اللبناني الكويتي والبنك اللبناني المصري، وغير العربية كالبنك اللبناني الكندي، كما توجد بعض الفروع لمصارف أوروبية مثل البنك البريطاني (HSBC).\nعلى الرغم من الأزمة الاقتصادية العالمية (2007 و2009 والمستمرّة حتى الآن)، فإن مصارف لبنان لم تتأثر بها بشكل يذكر، وبالتالي فإن قيمة الليرة اللبنانية بقيت مستقرة نسبيّا، ويعود ذلك إلى الإجراءات الصارمة التي تتبع عند منح القروض وغيرها من المدفوعات، والتي نصّ عليها وفرضها حاكم مصرف لبنان، رياض سلامة. حصل الأخير على جائزة «أفضل حاكم مصرف مركزي لسنة 2009»، كونه كان قادرا على منع وصول الأثار السلبية للأزمة الاقتصادية العالمية إلى لبنان، كما كان قد حصل على نفس الجائزة سنة 2006.\n\nبورصة بيروت\nبورصة بيروت هي سوق الأوراق المالية الوحيدة العاملة في لبنان. تعتبر بورصة بيروت واحدة من أقدم الأسواق المالية في المنطقة حيث يعود تاريخ تأسيسها لسنة 1920، تحت سلطة الانتداب الفرنسي، وكانت ثاني أقدم سوق مالية في العالم العربي. وفي أوائل الخمسينات تميز، الاقتصاد اللبناني بنشاط ملحوظ حيث بدأت شركات صناعية ومصرفية وخدماتية تدخل البورصة لتجعل من بورصة بيروت أفضل سوق مالي في المنطقة مع دخول حوالي خمسين شركة. مع اندلاع الأحداث اللبنانية سنة 1975 تراجعت حركة التداول في بورصة بيروت، ومع تدهور الوضع الأمني، علق العمل في البورصة من سنة 1983، ولم تعاود نشاطها حتى 22 ديسمبر 1996، أي بعد 13 عاما. في نهاية سنة 2006 أطلقت بورصة بيروت نظام تداول جديد عن بعد، يسمح للوسطاء بتداول الصكوك المدرجة على بورصة بيروت عن بعد من مكاتبهم الخاصة. وفي 13 فبراير 2008 قررت البورصة الإجازة باعتماد التداول الإلكتروني «عن بعد» على بورصة بيروت عبر الانترنت وذلك حصراً من خلال شركات الوساطة المعتمدة في البورصة. تقع بورصة بيروت اليوم في وسط المدينة التجاري، بعد أن نُقل مقرها إلى هناك سنة 2002.\n\nمرفأ بيروت\nتعد بيروت مركزًا لأحد أهم وأكبر الموانئ الواقعة شرق البحر المتوسط وهو مرفأ بيروت؛ حيث أن موقعه وعمق المياه فيه يتيح له أن يستقبل أكبر المراكب وسفن الشحن. فقد ظهر أن القسم المخصص منه لتخزين الحاويات كان يعمل ويحوي ما يزيد عن العدد العادي الذي يُفترض به أن يحويه، لأكثر من 10 سنوات، قبل أن تظهر الدراسات أنه يقدر أن يحوي هذا المقدار. كما وتوجد المقرات الرئيسيّة للعديد من المصارف والشركات اللبنانية في بيروت، وبعض فروع الأجنبية منها.\n\nالخدمات التجارية\nتشكل التجارة جزءاً من طبيعة البيروتيين الذين اكتشفوا منذ القدم أهمية موقع مدينتهم المرفئية، كجمال التقاء بين الشرق والغرب يتمتع بميزات تسهم في إنجاح المبادرات التجارية على اختلافها. فغدت بيروت مركزاً مالياً وتجارياً وصناعياً مرموقاً يتعاطى جميع النشاطات المالية والخدمات المصرفية بالإضافة إلى نشاطات أخرى متعددة في قطاعات البناء والتجارة والاستيراد والتصدير والصناعة.\nوتتمركز في بيروت المؤسسات الاقتصادية والتجارية الكبرى لتأمين الخدمات واستثمار المشاريع الإنشائية، ما وفر العمل للعديد من اللبنانيين، وجلب العديد من المستهلكين إليها، وقد ساعد في ذلك اعتماد لبنان النظام الرأسمالي الحر، وإقراره قانون السرية المصرفية وتوسيع وتطوير كل من مطار بيروت الدولي ومرفأ بيروت والمنطقة الحرة في كل من هذين المرفقين الحيويين الذين يعتبران عن حق بداية الشرق ومنفذاً للدول العربية على البحر المتوسط، وجسر الغرب الصناعي للشرق الاستهلاكي.\n\nجمعيّة تجّار بيروت\nتأسست جمعية تجـار بيروت سنة 1921 وأعترف بها رسـمياً بموجب رخصـة رسـمية مؤرخة في أبريل 1921. وكان الهدف الأساسي للمؤسسين العمل على توحيد جهود التجار في مدينة بيروت والتي كانت ركن الأساس للتجارة اللبنانية، وتنسيق مساعيهم في خدمة مهنتهم والاعتناء بالوسائل التي من شأنها حماية التجارة اللبنانية وتشجيعها ورفع مستواها والدفاع عن مصالحها ومصالح أعضائها والعمل على تقدمها وتقدمهم من جميع النواحي الاقتصادية، والعمل على إيجاد المشاريع التجارية وتنشيطها على اختلاف أنواعها والسعي لتعزيز مدينة بيروت الاقتصادي وإنشاء مكتب للاستعلامات التجارية وناد لتعارف التجار توثيقاً للروابط بينهم والتوسط لدى السلطات الرسمية والدوائر الحكومية لرفع كل حيف يقع عليهم والعمل لكل ما يعود بالنفع على الجمعية عموماً.\n\nالخدمات الصناعية\nتتمركز في بيروت وضواحيها 66% من المؤسسات الصناعية اللبنانية نظراً إلى سهولة الحصول على المواد الأولية عبر مرفأ بيروت بالإضافة إلى توافر اليد العاملة.\n\nالخدمات الصحية\nفي بيروت أهم المستشفيات اللبنانية وأكثرها تجهيزاً وكفاية معظم الجهاز الطبي اللبناني، فضلاً عن المستوصفات والصيدليات ومستودعات الأدوية. اشتهرت في الماضي بأنها مستشفى العرب، وبعد الحرب عادت تدريجياً إلى موقعها المرموق ويأتي إليها العديد من العرب خصوصاً للحصول على الطبابة المميزة. ومن أبرز مستشفيات بيروت: مستشفى الجامعة الأميركية، مستشفى رزق، مستشفى أوتيل ديو، ومستشفى المقاصد.\n\nبيروت الرسمية\nيقع البرلمان اللبناني في العاصمة بيروت، وكذلك السراي الكبير، مقر الحكومة. تحوي بيروت أيضا جميع الوزارات ومعظم الإدارات الرسميّة، السفارات والقنصليات. بيروت هي إحدى المحافظات الستة اللبنانية، والخمسة الأخرى هي: البقاع، لبنان الشمالي، لبنان الجنوبي، جبل لبنان، والنبطية.\n\nبلديّة بيروت\nتتكون بلدية بيروت من مجلس البلديّة ولجان ذلك المجلس. يتألف مجلس البلدية من رئيس البلدية ونائبه وأعضاء المجلس البالغ عددهم 24 شخصا. أما لجان المجلس فقد حدد القانون عددها بست عشرة لجنة هي: لجنة المناقصات، لجنة المال والإدارة، لجنة متابعة مقررات المجلس البلدي، اللجنة القانونية، لجنة الحدائق والصحة والبيئة، لجنة التخطيط والأشغال والأملاك والاستملاكات، لجنة الإعلام والعلاقات العامة، لجنة تسمية الشوارع والسير والإنارة والنقل، لجنة الشؤون الاجتماعية والثقافية والرياضية، ولجنة المؤسسات المصنفة. يشمل الجدول أدناه أسماء محافظو بيروت من عام 1936 إلى الوقت الحاضر: كامل عبّاس حميّة (1936 – 1941)، نقولا رزق الله (1946 – 1952)، جورج عاصي (1952 – 1956)، بشّور حدّاد (1956 – 1958)، فيليب بولس (1959 – 1960)، إميل ينّي (1960 – 1967)، شفيق أبو حيدر (1967 – 1977)، متري النمّار (1977 – 1987)، جورج سماحة (1987 – 1991)، نايف المعلوف (1992 – 1995)، نقولا سابا (1995 – 1999)، يعقوب الصرّاف (1999 – 2005)، ناصيف قالوش (2005 – 2014)، زياد شبيب (2014 –).\n\nالمنظمات الدولية\nتتخذ بعض المنظمات الدولية من بيروت مقرّاً لها، ومن ذلك لجنة الأمم المتحدة الاقتصادية والاجتماعية لغربي آسيا (الإسكوا، ESCWA) المتمركزة في وسط بيروت التجاري. وكذلك فهناك مكاتب إقليمية في المدينة لكل من منظمة العمل الدولية (ILO)، ومنظمة الأمم المتحدة للتربية والعلم والثقافة (اليونسكو، UNESCO)، والتي تغطي كافة أنحاء العالم العربي. بالإضافة لذلك، يقع المقر الرئيسي للاتحاد العربي للنقل الجوي (AACO) في بيروت أيضاً.\n\nالتعليم\nالتعليم الأساسي\nينتشر في بيروت عدد من المدارس الخاصة، ومن أشهرها: الإنترناشونال كولدج، بيروت (الكليّة العالمية في بيروت، IC)، كلية لويس فاغمان، مدرسة الجالية الأميركية في بيروت، ثانوية الروضة، كلية السيدة الأرثوذكسية، الكلية الفرنسية البروتستانتية (بالفرنسية: Collège Protestant Français)، مدرسة القلب الأقدس - الجميّزة (بالفرنسية: Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé)، الثانوية الفرنسية اللبنانية الكبرى (بالفرنسية: Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais). كذلك هناك بعض الجمعيّات الخيريةّ التي تُنشأ المدارس الخاصة مثل جمعية المقاصد الخيرية الإسلامية، والتي أنشأت عدّة مدارس خاصة في بيروت بقي منها 8 اليوم، ومن أهمها كلية المقاصد للبنات وكلية خالد بن الوليد.\n\nيعتمد انتقال الطالب إلى مرحلة التعليم العالي على حصوله على شهادة البكالوريا اللبنانية، ولكن يُقبل أيضا بالبكالوريا الفرنسية، باعتبار أنه تمت مساواتها بتلك اللبنانية، ويحصل الشخص على هذه الشهادة عن طريق نجاحه في امتحانات الثانوية العامة الرسمية. تعتبر البكالوريا الفنية أو المهنية بديلا عن تلك العادية بالنسبة لمن درس في المعاهد الفنية.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nيؤمن التعليم العالي في بيروت، وجميع أنحاء لبنان، عدد من المعاهد المهنية ومؤسسات التعليم العادي، مثل الكليّات الجامعية، المؤسسات الجامعية، والجامعات. ومن بين كل صروح العلم هذه المنتشرة عبر الدولة، فإن الجامعة اللبنانية هي مؤسسة التعليم العالي الرسميّة الوحيدة التي تقع في العاصمة. تُدار جميع الكليّات والجامعات في بيروت ولبنان من قبل وزارة التربية والتعليم العالي، ويعتبر الوزير المختص مسؤولا عن وضع البرامج التعليمية وتقرير موعد الامتحانات الرسميّة وصيانة هذه المؤسسات والحفاظ عليها بشكل عام.\nهناك عدد كبير من الطلاب الأجانب الذين يكملون دراساتهم العليا في بيروت، وأكثرهم من الخليج العربي وسوريا والعراق، والبعض من إيران وأوروبا، وينبغي على أي أجنبي من الذين يرغبون بمتابعة تعليمهم العالي في لبنان أن يستوفي المؤهلات المطلوبة في اللبنانيين أنفسهم، فيجب أولا أن تكون شهادته الثانوية معادلة للبكالوريا اللبنانية كي يسمح له بالتسجيل في أي مؤسسة تعليم عالي. لا يخضع الطلاب الأجانب لأي نظام محاصصة، وتُقدم الحكومة المنح الدراسيّة ضمن نطاق الاتفاقات الثانئية التي عُقدت مع الدولة الأم للطالب الأجنبي أو الدولة التي يرغب الطالب اللبناني بالتعلّم فيها. وعند حصول أي لبناني أو أجنبي على شهادة أجنبية، فإنه يجب التصديق عليها من قبل السفارة اللبنانية في ذلك البلد ووزارة الخارجية في لبنان، ومن ثم يبقى على الأجنبي المرشح للدخول في المؤسسة التعليمية أن يذهب بنفسه ومعه المستندات المطلوبة لإكمال إجراءات التسجيل في الجامعة أو المعهد الذي ينشده.\nتعتبر بيروت مركزا لبعض أهم وأشهر الجامعات في الشرق الأوسط، مثل الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت، جامعة القديس يوسف، المعهد العالي للأعمال، والجامعة اللبنانية الأميركية، وبعض الجامعات والكليّات ذات الأهمية المحلية مثل جامعة بيروت العربية، والجامعة الأميركية للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالعمران\nإن النظام المعماري في بيروت في العهد العثماني يعتبر من أجمل ملامح التراث البيروتي واللبناني والعربي والعثماني، وتشهد الآثار العُثمانيّة المتبقية من منازل ودور وقصور وسرايات وثكن ومدارس ومساجد، جمال وروعة هذا التراث. وعلى سبيل المثال فإن النشاطات الاقتصاديّة كانت ممثلة بالأسواق التجاريّة والصناعيّة والحرفيّة، من بين هذه الأسواق على سبيل المثال والتي كانت قائمة منذ العهد العُثماني: سوق الأساكفة، سوق البازركان، سوق العطارين، سوق الحدادين، وكثير غيرها. كانت بيوت البيارتة في تلك الفترة متواضعة بشكل عام، سقوفها مدعمة بالجسور الخشبيّة، وكان يصعد إلى الطابق العلوي بواسطة سلم حجر داخلي وسلم حجر خارجي، علماً أن بعض البيوت الأخرى كانت سلالمها مصنوعة من الأخشاب، أما المساطب فكانت نمطاً معمارياً تقليدياً موجود أمام بيوت بيروت كافة، كما وجدت في بيروت القديمة وفي ضواحيها القريبة بعض البيوت المتواضعة التي بنيت كلها من الخشب، وكانت تبطن الجدران الخشبية بصفائح من القصدير أو الزنك لمنع الهواء من الدخول إلى المنازل.\n\nوبشكل عام فإن بيروت في القرن التاسع عشر كانت تتميز بمنازل سقوفها من القرميد الأحمر الموضوع فوق السقوف الخشبية، وبغرف واسعة ذات سقوف عالية، وإيوان جميل متسع يُسمّى المنزول وهو ما يُعرف حاليّا بالصالون أو غرفة الاستقبال. وكان يتخلل المنازل شبابيك شرعيّة، وفتحات زجاجيّة مرتفعة مصنوعة من الزجاج الملون وفي غالبية منازل بيروت شرفات في الطابق الأول، في أعلاها فتحات زجاجيّة مصنوعة من الزجاج الملّون، كما يتخلل الغرف بعض فتحات التهوئة، وكانت المنازل البيروتيّة تضّم عادة عليّة التي تُعرف محليا باسم «المتخّت» أو «التتخيتة» التي يعلوها عادة القافعة التي يصعد منها إلى سطح المنزل، حيث السطيحة التي يظللها العرزال ومسابك زهور الفل والزنبق والرياحين والياسمين.\nوفي فترة لاحقة تأثر البيروتيين بنمط العمارة الأوروبي، فأخذت البيوت ذات طابع العمارة الإيطالية والفرنسية تنتشر بالمدينة شيئا فشيئا حتى استبدلت الكثير من المباني ذات الطابع العربي أو العثماني. وفي فترة لاحقة، ومع ازدياد الكثافة السكانية، أخذ الناس يبنون العمارات المتعددة الطوابق فحلت مكان معظم الأبنية التقليدية لدرجة أن أي حي سكني به عمارة قديمة من أيام العثمانيين والفرنسيين تصنفه البلدية على أنه «حي ذو طابع تراثي». وبعد انتهاء الحرب الأهلية، قامت شركة «سوليدير» بإعادة بناء وسط المدينة المدمر، فبنت معظم المناطق السكنية في تلك المنطقة على الطراز الأوروبي.\n\nمعالم المدينة\nالمواصلات\nإن استعمال وسائل المواصلات حاجة ضرورية يومية بالنسبة لكل من يسكن المدينة أو خارجها، على الرغم من صغر حجمها. تُقسّم وسائل النقل في بيروت إلى مواصلات برية، بحرية، وجويّة.\n\nالمواصلات البرية\nتتصل بيروت بغيرها من المدن اللبنانية والمدن السورية الرئيسيّة، عن طريق الحافلات التي يتبع كل منها شبكة طرقات معينة في تنقله. وتتمركز الحافلات التي تنقل الركاب إلى شمال لبنان وسوريا في محطة شارل حلو الواقعة في شمال بيروت. وفي بيروت شركتين رئيسيتين تقدم خدمات النقل للمواطنين: الأولى هي الشركة اللبنانية للمواصلات (LCC)، وهي شركة خاصة تؤمن النقل بداخل المدينة وبعض الضواحي، وهي تتبع 10 طرقات رئيسيّة تغطي معظم المنطقة المركزية لبيروت. أما الشركة الثانية، فهي مصلحة سكك الحديد والنقل المشترك، وهي شركة عامّة، تتبع حافلاتها 12 خطّا رئيسيّا في المدينة.\nبالإضافة إلى الحافلات، التي تستخدمها طبقة واسعة من الشعب وخصوصا أبناء الطبقات الفقيرة بسبب التعرفة البخسة، تنتشر في بيروت سيارات الأجرة والسرفيس، والأخيرة عبارة عن أجرة أرخص بكثير من الأجرة العادية، وتعرفتها محددة مسبقا، وهي تصل حاليّا في بيروت إلى 100,000 ليرة لبنانية، والغالب أن يستقل الناس سيارة الأجرة باعتبار أنها «سرفيس»، ولتفادي أي سوء تفاهم فقد جرت العادة على أن يخبر الراكب السائق بالمكان الذي يقصده، فإذا كان بعيدا تعتبر الأجرة عاديّة، وإن كان ضمن حدود المدينة تعتبر «سرفيس». كذلك تُستعمل الميكروباصات في نقل الأفراد من بيروت إلى بعض البلدات والقرى والمدن اللبنانية.\nوفي فترة سابقة، كان الترامواي أيضا يؤدي خدمة النقل بداخل المدينة، وقد جرى الاحتفال بتدشين خط الترامواي ببيروت في شهر سبتمبر سنة 1907 بمناسبة المولد السلطاني للعام الثامن والتسعين، وكان ذلك في عهد الوالي إبراهيم خليل باشا.، وتوقف العمل به في مايو 1964، بعد أن أصدرت الحكومة قرارها بذلك، وسيّرت الحافلات بدلا منه، بعد أن درّبت سائقي الترامواي على قيادة السيارات الجديدة.\n\nالمواصلات البحرية\nإن مرفأ بيروت هو أكبر مرافئ لبنان وأحد أهم المرافئ الواقعة شرق البحر المتوسط، وهو فضلا عن استقباله المراكب والسفن التجارية، يستقبل العبّارات التي يمكن الانتقال فيها من وإلى قبرص والمرافئ اللبنانية الأخرى بالإضافة للمرافئ السورية والمصرية وغيرها من المرافئ المجاورة.\n\nالمواصلات الجويّة\nيقع مطار بيروت رفيق الحريري الدولي في الضاحية الجنوبية للمدينة، ويتصل بوسط العاصمة عبر طريق المطار. وقد تم افتتاحه سنة 1954، وفي هذه الفترة كان يُعرف بمطار بيروت الدولي، وقد تعرض المطار على مر السنين لعدد من العوائق كان أبرزها الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية التي أوقفت جميع عمليات السفر تقريبا وأدت لتدمير منشآته وتوقفه عن العمل، وبعد انتهاء الحرب قام رئيس الوزراء آنذاك، رفيق الحريري بإعادة بنائه، وبعد استشهاد الأخير سُمي المطار على اسمه. يتعامل المطار مع 47 شركة طيران عربية وعالمية و8 شركات شحن جوي.\n\nالثقافة\nتعتبر ثقافة بيروت الحالية مزيجا من ثقافات متنوعة ومتعددة لمختلف الشعوب والحضارات التي مرّت على المدينة، بما فيها اليونانيون والرومان (ثقافة حوض البحر المتوسط)، العرب والأتراك (ثقافة عربية إسلامية)، والفرنسيون (ثقافة أوروبية). يُعتقد أن مدرسة الحقوق التي أنشأت في المدينة أيام الإمبراطورية الرومانية كانت أول مدرسة قانون في العالم. إن تاريخ الكوسموبوليتية هذا يعد مصدر فخر للبنانيين عموما والبيروتيين خصوصا.\nاستضافت بيروت قمة الفرانكوفونية وجامعة الدول العربية سنة 2002، وحفل تقديم جائزة ألبير لوندر، الذي يقدم جوائز للصحافيين الفرانكوفونيين المميزين كل سنة. استضافت المدينة أيضا الألعاب الفرانكوفونية في عام 2009. تعتبر بيروت عاصمة الكتاب العالمية للأمم المتحدة لسنة 2009، تقديرا لغناها الثقافي.\n\nاللكنة\nاللكنة البيروتية هي إحدى فروع اللهجة اللبنانية. وهي لكنة عربية أصيلة ما تزال ملامحها وصفاتها متجذرة حتى اليوم في المجتمع البيروتي، ويُلاحظ أن اللهجات المغاربية تبرز بين الحين والآخر في اللكنة البيروتية لا سيما اللهجة التونسية، ولهجة الشلوح سكان بلاد السوس وجبال الأطلس في المغرب الأقصى، ولهجة تمازرت وهي لهجة سكان الأطلس المتوسط، واللهجة الزناتية لهجة سكان الريف في الشمال، فضلاً عن لهجات الجزائر وليبيا. علمًا أن الكثير من ملامح اللكنة البيروتية بدأت تزول بسبب «التفرنج» في الكلام، ومع اقتحام العادات والتقاليد الغربية المنازل والشوارع والأسواق والمدارس والجامعات، وأجهزة الإعلام المتنوعة. ومن سمات لهجة العائلات البيروتية على سبيل المثال: تحويل السين صادًا، مثل: البسطة == البصطة، وتحويل الجيم إلى شين، مثال ذلك: الحرج = الحرش، اجتماع == اشتماع. فضلاً على أن اللهجة الخليجية التي انتقلت مع الفتوحات الإسلامية إلى المغرب العربي ثم ارتدت مجددًا إلى المشرق تظهر واضحة في أسماء بعض العائلات، مثل: بعيون؛ أي: أبو العيون، من با عيون.\n\nالمتاحف\nيعتبر متحف بيروت الوطني المتحف الأساسي للأثار في لبنان، وهو يحوي قرابة 1300 قطعة حرفية أثريّة يتراوح تأريخها من فترة عصور ما قبل التاريخ وصولا إلى العهد المملوكي في العصور الوسطى. وبالإضافة للمتحف الوطني، يعتبر متحف الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت للأثار ثالث أقدم متحف في الشرق الأوسط، وهو يعرض مجموعة كبيرة من الحرفيات التي عُثر عليها في لبنان وبعض الدول المجاورة.\nكذلك يوجد متحف سرسق أو قصر سرسق الذي يحوي اليوم أكثر الأعمال الفنية شهرة في بيروت، وهي تتمثل في مجموعة من المنحوتات اليابانية وعدّة أعمال فنية إسلامية، كما ويستضيف هذا المتحف معارض مؤقتة خلال السنة. وبالقرب من السراي الكبير يقع متحف روبير معوّض الخاص الذي تُعرض فيه المجموعة الخاصة بهاوي الفن والسياسي اللبناني هنري فرعون، من تحف وقطع أثرية. كما ويوجد متحف علمي خاص بالأطفال هو «بلانت ديسكفري» (كوكب الاكتشاف)، وفيه عدد من المعارض والتجارب والحرفيات، ويؤمن الإرشادات والتعليمات المناسبة لتثقيف الأولاد.\n\nالإعلام\nإن بيروت هي المركز الأساسي في لبنان لشركات التلفزة، والمطبوعات الصحفية، ودور نشر الكتب. تشمل القنوات التلفزيونية في المدينة: تلفزيون لبنان، المؤسسة اللبنانية للإرسال، تلفزيون المستقبل، قناة MTV، قناة الجديد، قناة المنار، قناة ANB، وقناة NBN. أما الصحف فتشمل: جريدة النهار، السفير، المستقبل، الأخبار، جريدة البلد، الديار، الأنوار، الشرق، صحيفة L'Orient Le Jour الفرنسية، وصحيفة Daily Star الإنكليزية. تعتبر بيروت أيضا إحدى محوريّ الإعلام الرئيسيين في العالم العربي، والثانية هي مصر.\n\nالرياضة\nاستضافت بيروت، إلى جانب طرابلس وصيدا، كأس آسيا في كرة القدم لسنة 2000. هناك ملعبين أساسيين لكرة القدم في المدينة وهما: ملعب المدينة الرياضية، وملعب بيروت البلدي. تتخذ 8 فرق كرة قدم من الدوري اللبناني بيروت مركزا لنواديها، وهي: نادي النجمة اللبناني، نادي الأنصار، الحكمة، العهد، المبرّة، الصفاء، الراسينغ بيروت، وشباب الساحل. بالإضافة لذلك هناك فرقيّ كرة سلة من بيروت، نادي الرياضي، ونادي الحكمة، الذان يُشاركان دوما في الدوري اللبناني لكرة السلة والبطولات العربية والإقليمية.\nتقام في بيروت أيضا أعداد أخرى من الأنشطة الرياضية، منها ماراثون بيروت السنوي، الكرة الطائرة، سباق خيل أسبوعي في ميدان سباق المدينة، بالإضافة لدورات غولف وكرة المضرب تقام في نادي الغولف في بيروت. ومؤخرا أنشأ دوري للرغبي في لبنان، واتخذت 3 فرق من أصل 5 بيروت مقرا لنواديها، وهي: AUB Wolves (ذئاب الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت)، LAU Immortals (خالدوا الجامعة اللبنانية الأميركية)، وUSJ Saints (قديسي جامعة القديس يوسف). تعتبر بيروت مرشحة محتملة لاستضافة الألعاب الأولمبية الصيفية لسنة 2024، ومن المتوقع أن مشروع صنين الضخم، البالغة تكلفته 1.2 مليار دولار أمريكي، سيجعل لبنان قادرا على استضافة هذه الألعاب.\n\nالموضة والفنون\nهناك المئات من المعارض الفنيّة عبر العاصمة بيروت وضواحيها. يعتبر الكثير من اللبنانيين مهتمّا بالفن وإنتاجه، فهناك قرابة 5000 فنان ينتج الفنون الجميلة، وعدد مماثل لهم يعملون في مجال الموسيقى، التصميم، الهندسة، المسرح، الأفلام، التصوير، وغيرها من أشكال الفنون. يتخرّج كل سنة المئات من الطلاب في كليات الفنون التصويرية وتصميم الأشكال من مختلف الجامعات في المدينة، وأخذت ورشات العمل الفنية تزدهر وتنتشر في جميع أنحاء لبنان، وفي بيروت خصوصا، حيث أصبح المشهد الفني غنيّا ومتنوعا للغاية.\nبالإضافة لهذا تنتشر معارض الأزياء والموضة بشكل كبير عبر أنحاء المدينة، وهناك دوما معارض ووكالات أزياء جديدة لمصممين عالميين تُفتتح وتعرض أعمالها عبر برامج أزياء مختلفة أبرزها قناة الموضة العربية الفضائية (بالإنجليزية: Fashion TV Arabia). ومن وكالات الأزياء المشهورة في بيروت: «جورجيوس ايجنسي» لصاحبها جورج كعدي، ستايل موديلينغ لصاحبها إيلي نحّاس، و«ناتاليز ايجنسي» لناتالي فضل الله. افتتح العديد من المصممين العالميين معارض لهم في بيروت مثل فيرساتشي وغوسي، كما ويعيش الكثير من هؤلاء المصممين بداخل المدينة وحولها مثل إيلي صعب، المصمم العالمي للأزياء النسائية. يشتهر الأخير بتصميمه لملابس لفنانات مشهورات مثل بيونسيه، جوينيث بالترو، وميشا بارتون، وهو يتبرّع سنويّا بشجرة ميلاد لتوضع في وسط بيروت التجاري. ومن المصممين المشاهير الذين يسكنون بيروت أيضا، زهير مراد، الذي صمم ملابس لفنانات مثل آنا أورتيز، وكريستينا أبلغيت، وهو يمتلك مشغلا ومعرضا خاصا به كذلك الأمر.\n\nالسياحة\nكانت السياحة في بيروت مزدهرة بشكل كبير إلى أن اندلعت الحرب الأهلية اللبنانية، حيث توقفت السياحة الترفيهية تماما، حتى وضعت الحرب أوزارها، فأعادت شركة سوليدير إعمار وسط المدينة المدمر الذي عاد وأصبح اليوم ينبض بالحياة كما كان سابقا، وبالتالي عادت سمعة المدينة كصلة وصل بين القارات الثلاثة، أوروبا وأفريقيا وآسيا، وكبوابة الشرق على الغرب. كان يُطلق على بيروت اسم «باريس الشرق» في أيام ازدهارها الأولى بعد الاستقلال، ولا يزال البعض يلقبها بهذا اللقب اليوم، ويعود ذلك إلى النمط العمراني، المعالم الأثرية، الأسواق، المطبخ البلدي، والحياة الليلية، التي بُشبهها البعض بتلك الموجودة في فرنسا، والتي من شأنها إبقاء السائح مهتما بالمدينة أثناء زيارته للبنان.\n\nومن أهم فنادق بيروت: فندق ألبيرغو، فندق بيل فيو هوتيل، فندق السفير، فندق ومنتجع الموفمبيك، الانتركونتيننتال فينيسيا، فندق الكومودور، الهوليداي إنّ ديونز، الميتروبوليتان بالاس، وغيرها.\nحصلت بيروت على المركز التاسع في قائمة أفضل المدن لمجلة السياحة والترفيه (بالإنجليزية: Travel and Leisure) لسنة 2006، حيث أتت في مرتبة متأخرة عن نيويورك ومتقدمة عن سان فرانسيسكو، إلا أن قائمة المدن هذه كان قد تمّ وضعها والتصويت عليها قبل العدوان الإسرائيلي على لبنان في نفس السنة. وبعد أن عادت الأمور لطبيعتها، عادت أعداد السياح لترتفع مجدداً بشكل ملحوظ. ومؤخرا قام دليل «لونلي بلانت» السياحي بتسمية بيروت المدينة الأكثر حيوية على سطح الأرض لسنة 2009، كما قامت النيويورك تايمز بمنح المدينة المركز الأول ضمن قائمة الأماكن الأربع والأربعين التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنة 2009. وقد زار لبنان في سنة 2009 حوالي 2.000.000 سائح عربي وأجنبي.\n\nأعلام بيروت\nخرج من

          "content": "## Overview\nBeirut (Arabic: بيروت‎ Bayrūt, French: Beyrouth) is the capital city of Lebanon with a population of approximately 2.1 million people in its metropolitan area. The city is on a relatively small headland jutting into the east Mediterranean. It is by far the biggest city in Lebanon. Due to Lebanon's small size, the capital has always held the status as the only true cosmopolitan city in the country, and since independence, has been the commercial and financial hub of Lebanon.\n\n## Districts\nBeirut is composed by many different neighbourhoods, each own having its own distinctive atmosphere and character. The city sprawls over a peninsula with the sea to the north and the west, and the Mount Lebanon ridge to the east.\nDamascus Road, which connects the centre with the National Museum, was known as the \"Green Line\" during the civil war era (1975–1990). At that time, it separated the mostly Muslim western sector of the city and the Christian eastern sector. Martyrs' Square and the post-war development of Beirut Central District (BCD) are the geographical pivot of the city and serve quite well for orientation.\n\n## History\nBeirut has survived a rough history, falling under the occupation of one empire after another. Originally named Bêrūt, \"The Wells\" by the Phoenicians, Beirut's history goes back more than 5000 years. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Arab and Ottoman civilizations.\nFollowing World War II, Lebanon gained its independence from France and Beirut became its capital in 1943; Bechara El-Khoury and Riad El-Solh, Lebanon's first president and prime minister respectively, are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and national heroes. Beirut thrived as a major commercial and tourist centre of the Middle East. It was a top destination among wealthy Arabs and European tourists, due to Beirut's unique geography, climate, diverse culture, and freedom. Beirut was seen as the \"European gateway to the Middle East\" and vice versa, and was often called the \"Paris of the Middle East\".\nBeirut is home to more than 10 recognized religious sects. Religious tension between the Christian and Muslim factions sparked a brutal civil war in 1975. The conflict lasted nearly a decade and a half, ravaging the city. The central area of the city, previously the focus of much of the commercial and cultural activities, became a no-man's land. Throughout the war, the city was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east, and tensions between different sects remain to this day.\nSince the end of the war in 1989, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut. The city has undertaken an aggressive rebuilding policy. The city is working hard to regain its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East which it has lost to Cairo as well as a centre for commerce, fashion and media which is dominated by Dubai and other rich Gulf states. However Beirut with the rest of the Middle East has gained momentum.\n\n## People\nSome areas of Beirut have a friendly atmosphere, and some Beirutis have a reputation for being very sociable and outgoing. The locals are used to the sight of foreigners and would be happy to show you around the city, if you ask them.\nSectarianism is still prevalent in Lebanon, as a result of the French colonial legacy of divide and rule, which leads some Christian Lebanese to identify culturally with Europeans, particularly the French, and some denying Arab identity altogether; preferring to identify themselves as Phoenician (referring to their ancestral roots in ancient Phoenicia.)  Many Muslim Lebanese identify culturally and ethnically with other Arabs and Muslims of the Middle East.\nIt is helpful to display some basic courtesies. A simple Bonjour when entering a cafe or shop can work wonders, and might even get you a special rate, or when hopping into a taxi, might just keep the driver from overcharging you. Say Merci when given or offered something, and if you'd rather not accept, then say La'a merci and smile; otherwise you might be taken as rude, even though you're not.\nMost Beirutis love going out. If (and when) you go out at night, depending on the venue, dressing up well will most certainly get you some respect. The locals like to see that foreigners are doing what they can to fit in. Expect to be offered a drink or a cigarette. Alcohol is very cheap in shops and supermarkets, yet in night venues, prices can rise up to European standards (e.g. LL8,000/beer, LL15,000/cocktail))\nSmoking is very common in Beirut, a large portion of the people smoke both outdoors and indoors. However, most restaurants and bars now abide by the law forbidding smoking indoors.\n\n## Climate\nBeirut enjoys a Mediterranean climate. Come in April to June for warm, dry days and long, cool evenings (19–25 °C). Temperatures in July and August rise to around 30 °C (86 °F) and humidity can be somewhat overwhelming – make sure your hotel has air conditioning. The wettest months are December to February so bring a good coat, rain boots, and umbrella because the rain often comes in torrential downpours. Streets have poor drainage and can quickly turn into rivers, so waterproof boots are highly recommended for the rainy season. Lebanon's ski season runs from December till early April.\nDespite the diverse climate that changes noticeably per season, the weather is very predictable; the weather forecasts on radio and TV stations are normally very accurate, so you can easily avoid finding yourself caught in a surprising downpour in the winter months.\n\n## Public holidays\nDue to Lebanon's diverse religions and sects, many public holidays are celebrated, some of which more than once:\nNew Year's Day, Epiphany and Armenian Christmas (6 Jan)\nEid al-Adha – Feast of Sacrifice, celebrating the last day of Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca\nAl Hijrah – Islamic New Year, Feast of St Maroun (9 Feb)\nMwalid Al Nabawai – Prophet's Anniversary, Good Friday and Easter Monday (Apr)\nLabor Day (1 May)\nLiberation of the South (25 May)\nAssumption (15 Aug)\nEid al-Fitr – Festival of the Breaking of the Fast\nAll Saints' Day (1 Nov)\nIndependence Day (22 Nov)\nChristmas Day (25 Dec)\nBased on the lunar calendar, Islamic holidays move forward approximately 11 days every Western year.\n\n## Dress\nAnything goes in Beirut. Shorts and T-shirts are perfect for the summer heat, for both men and women, while heavier clothing is necessary during the winter.\nYou should cover up if visiting religious sites, such as mosques and churches. Some neighbourhoods are more conservative than others, so bear that in mind when exploring the city. Going out at night is a smart affair, so dress fashionably to fit in, although this does not mean dressing up in a suit; you will find many men in sporty T-shirts, dark jeans, and smart running shoes at even the trendiest nightclubs.\n\n## Talk\nBeirut is very culturally diverse, and thus, multilingual. Lebanese Arabic is the native language, but everyone speaks Standard Arabic, the official language, while English and French (especially the former) are also spoken by most people.\nShop signs are in both Standard Arabic, English and French. Most restaurant menus, event listings, and such are also in English alongside Standard Arabic and sometimes in French. Road signs, however, are in Standard Arabic and French.\n\n## By plane\n33.82111135.4883331 Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY  IATA) (is located 7 km south of Beirut, and is roughly a 10- to 15-minute drive from the city center). Is the country's only international airport and the hub of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines (MEA). Most international airlines have daily flights between Beirut and the major European capitals.\nCar parking is available at the airport for around US$2.5 per hour. The parking time is rounded to the upper hour (i.e. 1.1 hours is rounded up to 2 hours).\nThere are regular public minivans (usually every five-ten minutes) that go to the Downtown area and to the Charles Helou Station from the airport. They are run by private individuals but are distinguished from normal vehicles by a red number plate (indicating that it is a public transport vehicle). There is no set bus stand outside the terminal, but it is outside the departures terminal upstairs. Rides cost $1 or LL1,500 (lira). Both currencies are accepted. Wait outside the terminal and flag the vans down, as they may not stop. You pay when you leave. Tell the driver where you are going before entering and they will say yes or no.\nThey are plentiful and comfortable taxis that are authorized by the airport are parked next to the terminal in the arrivals level and have an airport logo on the side (official airport taxi fares[dead link]). Although these taxis claim to be regulated by the airport authorities, they are definitely not honest in their rates.\nThey are also available and are located a little farther from the airport, but these are not guaranteed and are to be used at your own risk. The approximate rate Airport–Hamra street is LL25,000. However, the so-called regulated taxis' drivers, will ask you anywhere between US$30 to 50 for any downtown locations. So, start bargaining from $10 and stop at $15 as the upper limit, both ways to and from the Airport. Uber works in Lebanon, and as of February 2016 they had a $14 fixed rate to/from the airport. Considering this is only a 7 km long drive, and gas price is approx $1.5/litre in Beirut, this price is definitely a rip off that taxi drivers would not miss. Taxi types are wildly changing, so pick the best and newest looking ones to guarantee airconditioning, and collision safety.\nAll major car rental companies have booking offices inside the airport.\nMore information can be obtained through the airport's webpage on the topic[dead link].\n\n## By car\nDriving in Beirut is not to be recommended for much of the day, particularly in the city centre. Traffic is heavy, and impossible during rush hour. Walking around the city is much more of an experience, and is in fact necessary in the very centre since that part of the city is a pedestrian area.\nIt can be difficult to find parking other than in multi-story and off-street car parks. On-street parking, if you are lucky enough to find one, is allowed for a short time of two hours. Tickets must be purchased through the parking meters usually located at either end of a street. They can be paid by either cash or card. Overstaying your time may get you a ticket. Enforcement of the parking limit isn't done very efficiently, but obviously the last thing anyone would want to find is a ticket that will ruin their day and set them back financially.\nRenting a car is recommended if you're planning to visit neighbouring towns and cities, or if you're planning to go out late at night when public transport isn't operating. Car rental prices range from economical LL40,000/day to luxury prices. Those can change according to season, so make sure you contact the car rental company beforehand to check prices as well as pickup/drop-off locations.\nIf you are travelling to the country during high season make sure to book your car rental in advance since it is normal to find that all rental companies are completely booked.\nDriving in Beirut is on the right-hand side of the road. Driving can be hazardous because of crowded grid, lack of proper signing, and aggressive driving style. Only the central areas of Beirut have traffic lights operating, though plans have been made to cover all of the city.\n\n## By bus\nThere are two public transport companies. The OCFTC that operates a fleet of blue and white city-buses, and the LCC with a fleet of red and white minibuses; Bus fares cost either LL500 (OCFTC bus 24) or LL1000. The service is very efficient and the buses come very often, to get onto a bus you must stand at the side of the road and signal with your hand as a bus approaches; the buses will stop anywhere.\n\n## By taxi\nThere are two types of taxis in Beirut; the old (often) battered hail-taxis, and the prebooking taxis.\nHail-taxi — The most convenient form of transport in Beirut, as they are absolutely everywhere. Those taxis are predominantly Mercedes Benz cars (though due to increasing petrol prices, taxi drivers are opting for more economic forms or transport) and can be quite easily identified by their yellow illuminated taxi sign on the roof and red number plate. Fixed meters aren't provided so it is recommended to ask how much your trip will cost before hopping in. The fare will be charged per destination and not per distance travelled (which is an advantage since traffic is a big problem in the city). A typical journey from one side of Beirut to the other (roughly 3 km) may cost LL10 000. Many taxi drivers speak at least a few words of English and French. Knowing the name of your destination in the local language may solve any misunderstanding.\nPrebook taxi — These require that you call them and book a ride, they generally cost more but are much more luxurious and are normally air conditioned. All hotels should provide you with a taxi directory, if you wish to use this type of service. Taxi prices are considered cheap if compared to US and European taxis. Major taxi companies are: Geryes Taxi (+961 1-332747), Taxi Premiere (Tel 1260 or +961 1-389222). Allo Taxi (Tel 1213 or +961 1-366661),\nKeep in mind the names of the landmarks around the city, as they will come in handy when travelling by public transport (some drivers aren't that good at orienting!).\n\n## By service\nThe more common form of transport, especially with daily commuters, as they are cheaper than the taxis, but ironically, are in fact the same. Service [ser-vee-s] are shared-taxis, the same taxis as above but shared between four or more people. The biggest advantage with the Service system is that the price of the ride is fixed at 2,000 L.L (€1). They come with drawbacks of course, and apart from having to share a small car with three other complete strangers (great for meeting new people actually), Service drivers may choose not to take you if you are not going in the same direction as them.\nHailing a service or taxi usually entails yelling your destination to the driver if he slows down, then chasing the name of your destination with either 'taxi' (for private taxi LL10,000 should you want one.)\nIt is important to remember that if you want a service, give the name of the general district you want and not a specific address. When you get close the driver will ask you where you want to get out. If you recognise the area you want to be in say just ask to stop. After you have paid you and the driver asks you, can give a more specific address like \"Crowne Plaza\" (a landmark on Hamra St.)and the driver will drop you as near to it as he is going, often pointing out where you have to walk to get there. When you get in to a service pay the LL2000 for each person right away. If you fail to do so, the driver will assume you asked for taxi, and will overcharge you at taxi-rate when you want to get out. However if the driver stops to ask for other fares or picks up another passenger only pay the Service rate of LL2,000.\nTaxi drivers in Beirut are notorious for overcharging tourists much more so than neighbouring Syria.  Most will demand absurd fares and demanding 2-3 times the service rate is very common.  If you're pressed for time paying 2 service may be a compromise (LL4000), otherwise you may have to wait a bit to find an honest cab driver willing to take you for LL2000.  Always get a price before leaving otherwise the driver will most definitely rip you off. Also, virtually no one tips cab drivers unless some extraordinary service has been rendered, like a very long wait time while you run an errand or something. Some drivers will ask you for a tip particularly near holidays. Payment is usually at the end of the journey.\n\n## By foot\nAs the city is quite compact, walking is the best way of getting around, and perfect for getting off the beaten track to find unexpected surprises. Most people however will not walk throughout the city, rather they will walk within certain districts and take cars/taxis to get from one district to another. Streets are generally well signposted, but few Beiruti locals would know how to navigate according to their names, directions are usually given by building placement (\"straight down the road until you reach building X, turn left there, then right...\"), and many streets have local nicknames that wouldn't match the map. That said, if you find yourself lost in the streets, simply ask any passer-by for directions; no one will refuse to help! Otherwise you can stop at the nearest hotel or shop and ask. Hotel concierges and shop keepers will most definitely speak some limited English.\nSome roads in Beirut are in poor condition. Not so much in the centre, but the farther you get from downtown the more road works you will most probably find. So take care!\nYou can always check out a Beiruti-run walking tour called Walk Beirut. They offer weekly tours around the city.\n\n## By bicycle\nRoad blocks make cycling relatively safe the rest of the time as the result of reduced traffic.\n\n## See\nBeirut was once the self-proclaimed \"Paris of the Middle East\". It still has an outdoor cafe culture,  and European architecture can be found everywhere. Many Beirutis (as well as other Lebanese) speak French, English or both, to varying degrees, along with Arabic.\nEach district has its own sights and places to visit. The following listings are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Beirut. The complete listings are found on each individual district page.\n\n## Landmarks\nPigeon Rocks (Rawcheh District) A monumental natural arch jutting up from the Mediterranean. Great place to sit at one of the roadside cafes and watch the sun set.\nPlace de l'Etoile (Nejmeh Square)(Downtown District), built by the French in the early 20th century in the very centre of the Downtown district, it suffered a lot of war damage during the war but has been restored. It is under heavy security given that the Parliament sieges in the middle of it, and there are many army and police barrages to limit the access thereto.\nMartyr's Statue Downtown Martyr's Square, east of Nejmeh Square towards Ashrafieh.\n\n## Museums and galleries\n33.87821935.51491 National Museum of Beirut.

Check the different districts to find out what each has to offer. Meanwhile, here are a few highlights:\nBet on an Arabian thoroughbred every Sunday in the Beirut Hippodrome, officially called Hippodrome Du Parc De Beyrouth[dead link]. The hippodrome is home to popular horse races, attracting a dedicated betting crowd (often old taxi drivers). Foreigners should join the fun in the afternoon for free entrance (ID or passport required). Open on Sundays only.\nSoak up the sun in one of the beach clubs on the Beirut coast. Very few actually have sandy beaches, and most unfortunately have been converted into spas with swimming pools and paved terraces, but despite all that, they all have access to the sea. A few of them are completely private and members-only, but can be accessed by paying for a guest ticket if going in with a member. The Saint George Yacht club in Ain El Mreisseh and the Riviera Beach and Yacht Club at the Riviera Hotel are two such popular clubs, where access to the beach club for non-members is US$20 per day. You can chill in one of the pools or have a drink at the bars and cafes while listening to music in the afternoons. Long Beach Club is another good place. The entrance is just to the left of the Ferris wheel on the Corniche right before the hill. Bring a beach towel.\n33.878635.48011 Ramlet Al-Baida, ☏ +961 71 799 869. There is one at least one public beach though, right here. Lots of sand and pounding waves but sadly trash and pollution, maybe even some sewage releases into the water, too. Uff, at least you can watch the surf and sunset anyway. It is said to be a bit of a gay cruising spot too.    (updated Sep 2020)\nTest your golfing skills at  The Golf Club of Lebanon (18 hole), Ouzai - Beer Hassan (next to Henry chehab barrack), ☏ +961 1 826335-6-7, fax: +961 1 822474, info@golfcluboflebanon.com.\nTake a ride on the  Beirut Balloon (30 passenger helium filled balloon, offering breathtaking views from an altitude of 300 m), Allenby St., Downtown Beirut (Entrance is through Biel Convention Centre. Look for it in the sky!), ☏ +961 1 985901. 10AM-10PM.\nWalk, jog, skate, cycle, stroll (or whatever you consider exercise) along Paris Avenue which links up to General De Gaulle Avenue (both locally known simply as the corniche) which stretch around the entire Central Beirut perimeter (approx. 5 km). Start the walk, jog, skate etc... at the Beirut marina (Downtown Beirut District) about an hour or so before sunset and finish at the Pigeon Rocks in Rawcheh, in time to watch the sun go down while sipping on a drink at one of the outdoor cafés.\nScuba Dive:, With 300 sunny days a year, 36 shipwrecks, impressive walls, canyons, caves, Ray habitats and shark habitats, Beirut definitely has something to offer for a serious scuba diver. The French WWII submarine Le Souffleur, the British freighter Alice B which sank during the civil war in the 1980s, The Macedonia freighter which sank in 1962 and the National Star freighter in 1991, the Mediterranean flagship of Admiral Sir George Tryon HMS Victoria which sank in 1893, The British Lesbian which sank during WWII, make just a few of Beirut's shipwreck collection.

Promoting traditional methods of farming and preserving, it's a great place to pick up local honey, cheese and breads, plus artisans' crafts. It also runs regular cookery classes, to learn how to make that perfect tabouleh (bulgur salad).\nSunday Market Get up early and join the locals for a rummage at the Sunday Market which is open 7AM-1PM, next to Beirut River in the east. You might find antique jewellery, clothing and beads, or maybe just bric-à-brac, but there's an eclectic selection of goodies on show. Remember to bargain hard.\nBurj Hammoud Beirut's Armenian quarter, perfect place to shop for cheap bric-à-brac, artisan's' crafts, souvenirs, copper and brass ware and faus-brands. Don't forget to haggle. Burj Hammoud is located to the East of ashrafieh across the Beirut river.\n\n## Money\nCash: Lebanese pounds (LL) and US dollars are both accepted everywhere, except for tiny number of government offices. Payment and change for transactions may be given as a combination of the two. The exchange rate is fixed at LL91,000 to US$1 (as of 2024). Beware of exchange money in Lebanon in 2024, if you exchange money in the bank they will still use the old rate which is one tenth the real rate due to inflation, so don't exchange money in the bank.\nPayment cards: Many shops, hotels, restaurants, bars, etc., accept international payment cards such as Visa, MasterCard, Maestro or American Express.\nAutomatic bank tellers: Withdrawal can be made from any automatic bank teller found in any region of the country. Withdrawals can be made in either Lebanese lira or the US dollar.\nTraveler's checks: Lebanese banks can exchange them very easily.\n\n## Lebanese cuisine\nLebanese cuisine is a mix of Arab, Turkish and Mediterranean influences, and enjoys a worldwide reputation for its richness and variety as well as its Mediterranean health factor. Olive oil, herbs, spices, fresh fruits and vegetables are commonly used, as well as dairy products, cereals, fishes and various types of meat. A visit to Beirut includes the traditional Lebanese Mezze (Meza), an elaborate variety of thirty hot and cold dishes. A typical Mezze may consist of salads such as the Tabboule and Fattouch, together with the caviars: Hommos and Moutabal, and some patties such as the Sambousseks and finally, the stuffed grape leaves, with of course the Lebanese flat pita bread which is essential to every Lebanese Mezze.\nMankoushé/Manakish: a Lebanese pizza, or at least that's what it looks like, the Mankoushé is a baked pizza-shaped dough with either a mixture of thyme (called za'atar) or local cheeses (or a mixture of both) on top, can be bought from all bakeries as well as special Forn Mankhoushé which specialize in this type of food, usually had for breakfast. cost between LL1,000 and LL3,000.\nKa'ek: a different version of bagels, about 30 cm in diameter and hollow, normally filled with thyme but you can ask for cheese spread as well. Commonly purchased from street vendors that ride bicycles or motorized scooters and honk a manual horn, but you can also find it at major bakeries. Although not of Lebanese origins, they're quite popular and are always found near Rawcheh area, they're worth a try. Cost about LL1,000.\nRoastery Nuts: roasted nuts are them local favourite appetizers particularly with the older people. Local brands have dedicated roasteries where customers walk in and order fresh, they produce some of the best nuts in the region, and certainly the most varied. Pecans, cashews, macadamias, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, peanuts. Ask for Krikri in thyme, spice, or cheese flavour.\nSweets: every religious or national event sees stalls set up on pavements outside churches and in public squares, where traditional Lebanese sweets are sold such as: Maamoul, Ktaef, Halawet el Jibn, Halawet el Riz, and Ashta. If you're lucky enough to come across those be sure to give them all a try, otherwise visit any påtisserie  where the same sweets can be purchased.\n\n## International cuisine\nBeirut's different cultures brought different tastes for food, and restaurants of all different origins have opened all around the city. Restaurants have different price ranges, depending of course on the quality of the ingredients used; check the different districts for the listings.\n\n## Fast food\nIf you're on a tight budget, or if you simply miss the food that you can get back at home, fast food is your best option. All major international fast food restaurants have opened chains in Beirut (KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, Hardee's, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway), but many local fast food restaurants have sprung up to compete with the major franchisers.\n\n## Drink\nNightlife: Alcohol is readily available in Beirut. Many of Beirut's districts have their own fair number of cafes, bars, and clubs, although many areas are \"dry\" or, while serving alcohol, do not have a vibrant nightlife. This said, two of the hotter nightspots, with the highest concentration of pubs and nightclubs, are Gemmayze (mostly pubs) and Monot St (mix of nightclubs and pubs), both located within close range in the Ashrafieh district. Hamra is also seeing a revival in its nightlife, with over a dozen new pubs and bars open there now. The best way to find out what's in and what's not is by checking the local press or simply going there and seeing for yourself. There is no curfew in Beirut, thought expect most pubs and bars to empty by 2AM, and most nightclubs to empty between 4AM and 4:40AM.\nDuring the summer, Monot tends to be much less busy, as many open-air clubs outside of the area tend to dominate the nightlife in Beirut. Gemmayzeh remains popular year-round.\nSkyBar in Biel, next to downtown, is an open-air nightclub. It may be the hottest nightclub in Beirut, and has a view overlooking the Sea. It is closed during the winter months.\nIris. A rooftop bar on top of the an-Nahar newspaper building, with an outdoor area overlooking the sea, downtown, and the mountains.\nLocally brewed beer include Almaza and Laziza (non-alcoholic). There is also a microbrewery that started producing several styles of more flavorful beer in 2006, called \"961 Beer\"[dead link]. \"LB Beer\", which is brewed without the use of any corn or rice. it has gained a large following by the younger, independent minded crowd and is a regular staple at locally organized parties. All are worth a try when visiting.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are lots of hotels in Beirut's metropolitan area, ranging from cheap hostels to luxury suite hotels. Prices and quality vary across the spectrum, but if you look well enough, there's bound to be the perfect hotel inside whatever budget you set. Check the different districts to find places to sleep.\n\n## Stay safe\nPhotography of military personnel and installations is prohibited. You should also be careful in taking photographs in the Dahiyeh (the southern suburbs), if you don't want to get in contact with Hezbollah. The safest thing is to ask an official nearby for permission, although your request will very likely be turned down. Keep your camera in a purse just for safety. If a Hezbollah official approaches you, seeing your camera, he can't know if you've been taking pictures before that. Should you be taken in for questioning (because of taking pictures), remain calm. It might take a long time getting out of it, but it's highly unlikely that things should escalate or turn ugly. Bottom line: consider not bringing your camera at all. A trip to Dahiyeh is way too interesting and different to be spent getting questioned by the authorities.\nAvoid any governmental or military convoys that may be passing by. Lebanese people have adapted to all those situations.\nPalestinian refugee camps in Beirut are approachable, but try to bring a local, who will be worth a lot when it comes to logistics and safety. Camps vary in size and appearance (the camps in Beirut are worse than some rural camps, which can resemble more open villages). Most refugees however are both civil and open in the encounter with foreigners. The key is of course openness on your part as well. Of course, Downtown Beirut will always be a more safe alternative, but for the most part you won't encounter any problems while in a refugee camp.\n\n## Cope\nBeirut sees no more criminal activity than any other major city, if not less. Be aware of pickpockets and scams involving overpricing. The last is mostly a problem concerning taxi drivers, so be sure always to agree on a price before setting off.\nIf you are unlucky enough to fall ill, head straight for the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), also known as AUH, (near the AUB campus) - you will need to pay around US$40 upfront (cash or major credit card) and be reimbursed later by your insurer.\nPharmacies in Lebanon are able to prescribe drugs on-the-spot. While this is likely to be a boon for a minority of travelers, it can leave you even more ill than when you came in to begin with. Don't chance it - see a doctor first.\nEscaping to the mountains near Beirut is a good option for those about to burn-out. Aley and Beit Mery are both near enough to the city (20–30 minutes) and are generally clean and green.\n\n## Embassies\nCzech Republic, St. Bechara Church Street, Baabda, ☏ +961 5 929 010, +961 3 332 291 (emergencies), fax: +961 5 922 120, beirut@embassy.mzv.cz.

          "content": "Baalbek (; Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ, romanized: Baʿlabakk; Syriac: ܒܥܠܒܟ) is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km (42 mi) northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.\nBaalbek's history dates back at least 11,000 years. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, Greek for \"Sun City\"). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.\nIn the modern era, Baalbek is a tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the Great Umayyad Mosque, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named Hajar al-Hibla. Baalbek's tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975–1990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).\nBaalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah's heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.\nIsrael has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.\n\nEtymology\nA few kilometres from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the manbaa al-nahrayn (\"Source of the Two Rivers\"), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.\nBaalbek was called Heliopolis during the Roman Empire, a latinisation of the Greek Hēlioúpolis (Ἡλιούπολις) used during the Hellenistic period, meaning \"Sun City\" in reference to the solar cult there. The name is attested under the Seleucids and Ptolemies. However, Ammianus Marcellinus notes that earlier Assyrian names of Levantine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the Diadochi, who were successors of Alexander the Great. In Greek religion, Helios was both the sun in the sky and its personification as a god. The local Semitic god Baʿal Haddu was more often equated with Zeus or Jupiter or simply called the \"Great God of Heliopolis\", but the name may refer to the Egyptians' association of Baʿal with their great god Ra. It was sometimes described as Heliopolis in Syria or Coelesyria (Latin: Heliopolis Syriaca or Syriae) to distinguish it from its namesake in Egypt. In Catholicism, its titular see is distinguished as Heliopolis in Phoenicia, from its former Roman province Phoenice. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name Biḳāʿ al-ʿAzīz borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it references an earlier solar deity named Aziz. In Greek and Roman antiquity, it was known as Heliopolis. Some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon are located here, including one of the largest temples of the Roman empire. The gods worshipped there (Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus) were equivalents of the Canaanite deities Hadad, Atargatis. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, which differ from classic Roman design.\n\nThe name BʿLBK appears in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a kind of garlic, shum ba'albeki (שום בעלבכי). It appears in two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a c. 411 translation of Eusebius's Theophania and a c. 435 life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as Baʿlabakk (Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ) in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as Baʿlabak (بَعْلَبَك) or Baʿlabekk. It is Bʿalbik (بْعَلْبِك, is [ˈbʕalbik]) in Lebanese Arabic.\nThe etymology of Baalbek has been debated since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean \"Baʿal (Lord) of the Beka\" and Donne as \"City of the Sun\". Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of Baʿal Nebeq (\"Lord of the Source\" of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of \"Lord Bacchus\", from the classical temple complex.\nNineteenth-century Biblical archaeologists proposed the association of Baalbek with the town of Baalgad in the Book of Joshua; the town of Baalath, one of Solomon's cities in the First Book of Kings; Baal-hamon, where Solomon had a vineyard; and the \"Plain of Aven\" in Book of Amos.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe hilltop of Tell Baalbek, part of a valley to the east of the northern Beqaa Valley (Latin: Coele-Syria), shows signs of almost continual habitation over the last 8–9000 years. It was well-watered both from a stream running from the Rās al-ʿAyn spring southwest of the citadel and, during the spring, from numerous rills formed by meltwater from the Anti-Lebanons. Macrobius later credited the site's foundation to a colony of Egyptian or Assyrian priests. The settlement's religious, commercial, and strategic importance was minor enough, however, that it is never mentioned in any known Assyrian or Egyptian record, unless under another name. Its enviable position in a fertile valley, major watershed, and along the route from Tyre to Palmyra should have made it a wealthy and splendid site from an early age. During the Canaanite period, the local temples were primarily devoted to the Heliopolitan Triad: a male god (Baʿal), his consort (Astarte), and their son (Adon). The site of the present Temple of Jupiter was probably the focus of earlier worship, as its altar was located at the hill's precise summit and the rest of the sanctuary raised to its level.\nIn Islamic mythology, the temple complex was said to have been a palace of Solomon's which was put together by djinn and given as a wedding gift to the Queen of Sheba; its actual Roman origin remained obscured by the citadel's medieval fortifications as late as the 16th-century visit of the Polish prince Radziwiłł.\n\nAntiquity\nAfter Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia in the 330s BC, Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the Diadochi kingdoms of Egypt & Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The settlers of the Roman colony Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of the 5th and 8th Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. From 15 BC to AD 193, it formed part of the territory of Berytus. It is mentioned in Josephus, Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy and on coins of nearly every emperor from Nerva to Gallienus. The 1st-century Pliny did not number it among the Decapolis, the \"Ten Cities\" of Coelesyria, while the 2nd-century Ptolemy did. The population likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Indian monsoon and caravans to the coast and interior.\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the city's temple to Baʿal Haddu was conflated first with the worship of the Greek sun god Helios and then with the Greek and Roman sky god under the name \"Heliopolitan Zeus\" or \"Jupiter\". The present Temple of Jupiter presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation; it was constructed during the mid-1st century and probably completed around AD 60. His idol was a beardless golden god in the pose of a charioteer, with a whip raised in his right hand and a thunderbolt and stalks of grain in his left; its image appeared on local coinage and it was borne through the streets during several festivals throughout the year. Macrobius compared the rituals to those for Diva Fortuna at Antium and says the bearers were the principal citizens of the town, who prepared for their role with abstinence, chastity, and shaved heads. In bronze statuary attested from Byblos in Phoenicia and Tortosa in Spain, he was encased in a pillarlike term and surrounded (like the Greco-Persian Mithras) by busts representing the sun, moon, and five known planets. In these statues, the bust of Mercury is made particularly prominent; a marble stela at Massilia in Transalpine Gaul shows a similar arrangement but enlarges Mercury into a full figure. Local cults also revered the Baetylia, black conical stones considered sacred to Baʿal. One of these was taken to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus, a former priest \"of the sun\" at nearby Emesa, who erected a temple for it on the Palatine Hill. Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st century BC until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century. (The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a \"wonder of the world\", credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius, but it is uncertain how reliable his account is on the point.) By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Baʿal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon or Seimios). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.\nThe emperor Trajan consulted the site's oracle twice. The first time, he requested a written reply to his sealed and unopened question; he was favorably impressed by the god's blank reply as his own paper had been empty. He then inquired whether he would return alive from his wars against Parthia and received in reply a centurion's vine staff, broken to pieces. In AD 193, Septimius Severus granted the city ius Italicum rights. His wife Julia Domna and son Caracalla toured Egypt and Syria in AD 215; inscriptions in their honour at the site may date from that occasion; Julia was a Syrian native whose father had been an Emesan priest \"of the sun\" like Elagabalus.\nThe town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity. Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In AD 297, the actor Gelasinus converted in the middle of a scene mocking baptism; his public profession of faith provoked the audience to drag him from the theater and stone him to death. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised. Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess' temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals' ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. Bar Hebraeus also credited him with ending the locals' continued practice of polygamy. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. They reacted violently again under the freedom permitted to them by Julian the Apostate. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment. The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The Easter Chronicle states he was also responsible for destroying all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400, Rabbula, the future bishop of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex's Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537. Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin II (560s & 570s), and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens.\n\nMiddle Ages and early modernity\nBaalbek was occupied by the Muslim army in AD 634 (AH 13), in 636, or under Abu ʿUbaidah following the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk in 637 (AH 16), either peacefully and by agreement or following a heroic defense and yielding 2,000 oz (57 kg) of gold, 4,000 oz (110 kg) of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords. The ruined temple complex was fortified under the name al-Qala' (lit. \"The Fortress\") but was sacked with great violence by the Damascene caliph Marwan II in 748, at which time it was dismantled and largely depopulated. It formed part of the district of Damascus under the Umayyads and Abbasids before being conquered by Fatimid Egypt in 942. In the mid-10th century, it was said to have \"gates of palaces sculptured in marble and lofty columns also of marble\" and that it was the most \"stupendous\" and \"considerable\" location in the whole of Syria. It was sacked and razed by the Byzantines under John I in 974, raided by Basil II in 1000, and occupied by Salih ibn Mirdas, emir of Aleppo, in 1025.\nIn 1075, it was finally lost to the Fatimids on its conquest by Tutush I, Seljuk emir of Damascus. It was briefly held by Muslim ibn Quraysh, emir of Aleppo, in 1083; after its recovery, it was ruled in the Seljuks' name by the eunuch Gümüshtegin until he was deposed for conspiring against the usurper Toghtekin in 1110. Toghtekin then gave the town to his son Buri. Upon Buri's succession to Damascus on his father's death in 1128, he granted the area to his son Muhammad. After Buri's murder, Muhammad successfully defended himself against the attacks of his brothers Ismaʿil and Mahmud and gave Baalbek to his vizier Unur. In July 1139, Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo and stepfather of Mahmud, besieged Baalbek with 14 catapults. The outer city held until 10 October and the citadel until the 21st, when Unur surrendered upon a promise of safe passage. In December, Zengi negotiated with Muhammad, offering to trade Baalbek or Homs for Damascus, but Unur convinced the atabeg to refuse. Zengi strengthened its fortifications and bestowed the territory on his lieutenant Ayyub, father of Saladin. Upon Zengi's assassination in 1146, Ayyub surrendered the territory to Unur, who was acting as regent for Muhammad's son Abaq. It was granted to the eunuch Ata al-Khadim, who also served as viceroy of Damascus.\nIn December 1151, it was raided by the garrison of Banyas as a reprisal for its role in a Turcoman raid on Banyas. Following Ata's murder, his nephew Dahhak, emir of the Wadi al-Taym, ruled Baalbek. He was forced to relinquish it to Nur ad-Din in 1154 after Ayyub had successfully intrigued against Abaq from his estates near Baalbek. Ayyub then administered the area from Damascus on Nur ad-Din's behalf. In the mid-12th century, Idrisi mentioned Baalbek's two temples and the legend of their origin under Solomon; it was visited by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela in 1170.\nBaalbek's citadel served as a jail for Crusaders taken by the Zengids as prisoners of war. In 1171, these captives successfully overpowered their guards and took possession of the castle from its garrison. Muslims from the surrounding area gathered, however, and entered the castle through a secret passageway shown to them by a local. The Crusaders were then massacred.\nThree major earthquakes occurred in the 12th century, in 1139, 1157, and 1170. The one in 1170 ruined Baalbek's walls and, though Nur ad-Din repaired them, his young heir Ismaʿil was made to yield it to Saladin by a 4-month siege in 1174. Having taken control of Damascus on the invitation of its governor Ibn al-Muqaddam, Saladin rewarded him with the emirate of Baalbek following the Ayyubid victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175. Baldwin, the young leper king of Jerusalem, came of age the next year, ending the Crusaders' treaty with Saladin. His former regent, Raymond of Tripoli, raided the Beqaa Valley from the west in the summer, suffering a slight defeat at Ibn al-Muqaddam's hands. He was then joined by the main army, riding north under Baldwin and Humphrey of Toron; they defeated Saladin's elder brother Turan Shah in August at Ayn al-Jarr and plundered Baalbek. Upon the deposition of Turan Shah for neglecting his duties in Damascus, however, he demanded his childhood home of Baalbek as compensation. Ibn al-Muqaddam did not consent and Saladin opted to invest the city in late 1178 to maintain peace within his own family. An attempt to pledge fealty to the Christians at Jerusalem was ignored on behalf of an existing treaty with Saladin. The siege was maintained peacefully through the snows of winter, with Saladin waiting for the \"foolish\" commander and his garrison of \"ignorant scum\" to come to terms. Sometime in spring, Ibn al-Muqaddam yielded and Saladin accepted his terms, granting him Baʿrin, Kafr Tab, and al-Maʿarra. The generosity quieted unrest among Saladin's vassals through the rest of his reign but led his enemies to attempt to take advantage of his presumed weakness. He did not permit Turan Shah to retain Baalbek very long, though, instructing him to lead the Egyptian troops returning home in 1179 and appointing him to a sinecure in Alexandria. Baalbek was then granted to his nephew Farrukh Shah, whose family ruled it for the next half-century. When Farrukh Shah died three years later, his son Bahram Shah was only a child but he was permitted his inheritance and ruled til 1230. He was followed by al-Ashraf Musa, who was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail, who received it in 1237 as compensation for being deprived of Damascus by their brother al-Kamil. It was seized in 1246 after a year of assaults by as-Salih Ayyub, who bestowed it upon Saʿd al-Din al-Humaidi. When as-Salih Ayyub's successor Turan Shah was murdered in 1250, al-Nasir Yusuf, the sultan of Aleppo, seized Damascus and demanded Baalbek's surrender. Instead, its emir did homage and agreed to regular payments of tribute.\nThe Mongolian general Kitbuqa took Baalbek in 1260 and dismantled its fortifications. Later in the same year, however, Qutuz, the sultan of Egypt, defeated the Mongols and placed Baalbek under the rule of their emir in Damascus. Most of the city's still-extant fine mosque and fortress architecture dates to the reign of the sultan Qalawun in the 1280s. By the early 14th century, Abulfeda the Hamathite was describing the city's \"large and strong fortress\". The revived settlement was again destroyed by a flood on 10 May 1318, when water from the east and northeast made holes 30 m (98 ft) wide in walls 4 m (13 ft) thick. 194 people were killed and 1500 houses, 131 shops, 44 orchards, 17 ovens, 11 mills, and 4 aqueducts were ruined, along with the town's mosque and 13 other religious and educational buildings. In 1400, Timur pillaged the town, and there was further destruction from a 1459 earthquake.\n\nEarly modernity\nIn 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the rest of Syria by the Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim. In recognition of their prominence among the Shiites of the Beqaa Valley, the Ottomans awarded the sanjak of Homs and local iltizam concessions to Baalbek's Harfush family. Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfushes' oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahlé (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.\nFrom the 16th century, European tourists began to visit the colossal and picturesque ruins. Donne hyperbolised \"No ruins of antiquity have attracted more attention than those of Heliopolis, or been more frequently or accurately measured and described.\" Misunderstanding the temple of Bacchus as the \"Temple of the Sun\", they considered it the best-preserved Roman temple in the world. The Englishman Robert Wood's 1757 Ruins of Balbec included carefully measured engravings that proved influential on British and Continental Neoclassical architects. For example, details of the Temple of Bacchus's ceiling inspired a bed and ceiling by Robert Adam and its portico inspired that of St George's in Bloomsbury.\nDuring the 18th century, the western approaches were covered with attractive groves of walnut trees, but the town itself suffered badly during the 1759 earthquakes, after which it was held by the Metawali, who again feuded with other Lebanese tribes. Their power was broken by Jezzar Pasha, the rebel governor of Acre, in the last half of the 18th century. All the same, Baalbek remained no destination for a traveller unaccompanied by an armed guard. Upon the pasha's death in 1804, chaos ensued until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt occupied the area in 1831, after which it again passed into the hands of the Harfushes. In 1835, the town's population was barely 200 people. In 1850, the Ottomans finally began direct administration of the area, making Baalbek a kaza under the Damascus Eyalet and its governor a kaymakam.\n\nExcavations\nEmperor Wilhelm II of Germany and his wife passed through Baalbek on 1 November 1898, on their way to Jerusalem. He noted both the magnificence of the Roman remains and the drab condition of the modern settlement. It was expected at the time that natural disasters, winter frosts, and the raiding of building materials by the city's residents would shortly ruin the remaining ruins. The archaeological team he dispatched began work within a month. Despite finding nothing they could date prior to Baalbek's Roman occupation, Otto Puchstein and his associates worked until 1904 and produced a meticulously researched and thoroughly illustrated series of volumes. Later excavations under the Roman flagstones in the Great Court unearthed three skeletons and a fragment of Persian pottery dated to the 6th–4th centuries BC. The sherd featured cuneiform letters.\nIn 1977, Jean-Pierre Adam made a brief study suggesting most of the large blocks could have been moved on rollers with machines using capstans and pulley blocks, a process which he theorised could use 512 workers to move a 557 tonnes (614 tons) block. \"Baalbek, with its colossal structures, is one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee\", UNESCO reported in making Baalbek a World Heritage Site in 1984. When the committee inscribed the site, it expressed the wish that the protected area include the entire town within the Arab walls, as well as the southwestern extramural quarter between Bastan-al-Khan, the Roman site and the Mameluk mosque of Ras-al-Ain. Lebanon's representative gave assurances that the committee's wish would be honoured. Recent cleaning operations at the Temple of Jupiter discovered the deep trench at its edge, whose study pushed back the date of Tell Baalbek's settlement to the PPNB Neolithic. Finds included pottery sherds including a spout dating to the early Bronze Age. In the summer of 2014, a team from the German Archaeological Institute led by Jeanine Abdul Massih of the Lebanese University discovered a sixth, much larger stone suggested to be the world's largest ancient block. The stone was found underneath and next to the Stone of the Pregnant Woman (\"Hajjar al-Hibla\") and measures around 19.6 m × 6 m × 5.5 m (64 ft × 20 ft × 18 ft). It is estimated to weigh 1,650 tonnes (1,820 tons).\n\nModern history\nBaalbek was connected to the DHP, the French-owned railway concession in Ottoman Syria, on 19 June 1902. It formed a station on the standard-gauge line between Riyaq to its south and Aleppo (now in Syria) to its north. This Aleppo Railway connected to the Beirut–Damascus Railway but—because that line was built to a 1.05-meter gauge—all traffic had to be unloaded and reloaded at Riyaq. Just before the First World War, the population was still around 5000, about 2000 each of Sunnis and Shia Mutawalis and 1000 Orthodox and Maronites. The French general Georges Catroux proclaimed the independence of Lebanon in 1941 but colonial rule continued until 1943. Baalbek still has its railway station but service has been discontinued since the 1970s, originally owing to the Lebanese Civil War.\nIn March 1974, Musa al-Sadr announced the launching of the \"Movement of the Deprived\" in front of a rally in Baalbek attended by 75,000 men. Its objective was to stand up for Lebanon's neglected Shia community. In his speech he listed grievances with the Lebanese government, including Baalbek's lack of a secondary school, Shia communities receiving disproportionately less funds from the national budget, most of the homeless being Shia etc. The occasion was a religious one, and there was celebratory gunfire preceding it. He also announced the setting up of military training camps to train villagers in southern Lebanon to protect their homes from Israeli attacks. These camps led to the creation of the Amal Militia.\nBy the 2000s, Baalbek was frequently described as a stronghold of Hezbollah, although it also has a large presence of Christians and Sunni Muslims. Many of the city's mayors have been Shia, but since 2022, Baalbek has had a Sunni mayor.\n\nIsraeli–Lebanon conflict\nIn 1978, Israel invaded south Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands of Shia Muslims to flee. As a result of the invasion, when Hassan Nasrallah returned to Lebanon from his studies in Najaf, he was unable to return to his hometown in the south, and instead settled in Baalbek. Abbas al-Musawi also moved to Baalbek.\nIn 1982, at the height of another Israeli invasion, Amal split into two factions over Nabih Berri's acceptance of the American plan to evacuate Palestinians from West Beirut. A large number of dissidents, led by Amal's military commander Hussein Musawi moved to Baalbek. Once established in the town the group, which was to evolve into Hezbollah, began to work with Iranian Revolutionary Guards, veterans of the Iran Iraq War. The following year the Iranians established their headquarters in the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. Ultimately there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, with outposts further south in the Shia villages, such as Jebchit.\nIn 1984, Israel launched raids on Baalbek, killing 100 Lebanese civilians and wounding hundreds inside the city. Israel also bombed a school in the Wavel Palestinian refugee camp next to the city, wounding 150 school children.\nOn 24/25 June 1999, following elections in Israel and the new administration undecided, the IAF launched two massive air raids across Lebanon. One of the targets was the al Manar radio station's offices in a four-storey building in Baalbek which was completely demolished. The attacks also hit Beirut's power stations and bridges on the roads to the south. An estimated $52 million damage was caused. Eleven Lebanese were killed as well as two Israelis in Kiryat Shmona.\n\n2006 Lebanon War\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, many Israeli bombs fell inside the historic Roman town, and some fell as close as 300 meters from the temple of Baalbek. After the war, UNESCO stated that the cracks in the Roman temples had widened. The damage was thought to be due to shockwaves created by the bombs.\nMore than 250 houses and buildings were destroyed by Israel during the war. Reporters investigating the aftermath found these to be civilian houses and didn't find any evidence of military use.\nOn the evening of 1 August 2006, hundreds of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers raided Baalbek and the Dar al-Hikma or Hikmeh Hospital in Jamaliyeh to its north (\"Operation Sharp and Smooth\"). Their mission was to rescue two captured soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were abducted by Hezbollah on 12 July 2006. They were transported by helicopter and supported by Apache helicopters and unmanned drones, The IDF was acting on information that Goldwasser and Regev were at the hospital. al-Jazeera and other sources claimed the IDF was attempting to capture senior Hezbollah officials, particularly Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek. The hospital had been empty for four days, the most unwell patients having been transferred and the rest sent home. \nOn August 7, Israel killed 9 civilians in an attack on Brital, just south of Baalbek, and by the subsequent attack on the car leaving the scene for the hospital. A Human Rights Watch investigation showed that none of those killed were combatants, it is likely none were members of Hezbollah, and none of the survivors had any knowledge of any military presence at place of the attack.\nOn 14 August just before the ceasefire took effect, two Lebanese police and five Lebanese soldiers were killed by a drone strike while driving their van around the still-damaged road through Jamaliyeh.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nBaalbek has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with significant continental influences. It is located in one of the drier regions of the country, giving it an annual average of 450 millimetres or 18 inches of rainfall compared with 800 to 850 millimetres (31 to 33 in) in coastal areas, overwhelmingly concentrated in the months from November to April. Baalbek has hot rainless summers with cool (and occasionally snowy) winters. Autumn and spring are mild and fairly rainy.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 93.85% and Christians made up 5.66% of registered voters in Baalbek. 59.61% of the voters were Shiite Muslims and 34.24% were Sunni Muslims.\n\nEconomy\nTourism\nThe Roman ruins have been the setting for the long running Baalbek International Festival.\nBaalbek's tourism sector suffered significantly due to the Lebanese Civil war (1975–1990). After the civil war ended, tourism gradually saw a resurgence, including opera, orchestras. But it was once again disrupted by Israeli bombings of Baalbek during the 2006 war.\nAfter the 2006 war, conservation work at Lebanon's historic sites began in October that year. The ruins at Baalbek were not directly hit by Israeli bombing but the effects of blasts during the conflict toppled a block of stones at the Roman ruins and existing cracks in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus were feared to have widened. Frederique Husseini, director-general of Lebanon's Department of Antiquities, requested $550,000 from Europeans to restore Baalbek's souk and another $900,000 for repairs to other damaged structures.\nStarting in the early 2000s, Hezbollah organized permanent or temporary exhibitions called \"Exposition of the Resistance\" which commemorate what is considered to be Lebanese resistance to Israeli occupation. Spanning several hundred square meters, the exhibitions feature defused Israeli weapons, recreated scenes of war, and photos and videos of Lebanese people killed by Israel. Starting in 2009, Hezbollah setup an exhibition to commemorate the 2006 war.\nDuring the Syrian civil war, the UK FCO designated areas close to the Syrian border, including Baalbek and the rest of Beqaa valley, as \"red zone\" – advising against all travel. The US State Department made a similar designation. These designations, prompted by perceived proximity to Syria and clashes between Sunnis and Alawites, discouraged international tourism.\nDuring its 2024 invasion of Lebanon, Israel bombed a restaurant frequented by tourists and damaged the historic Hotel Palmyra. In November, UNESCO gave Baalbek enhanced protection to safeguard against damage to the archaeological site during the invasion; it was one of 34 areas to receive this protection.\n\nRuins\nThe Tell Baalbek temple complex, fortified as the town's citadel during the Middle Ages, was constructed from local stone, mostly white granite and a rough white marble. Over the years, it has suffered from the region's numerous earthquakes, the iconoclasm of Christian and Muslim lords, and the reuse of the temples' stone for fortification and other construction. The temples also suffered minor damage from the shockwaves generated by nearby Israeli bombings in the 2006 Lebanon war. The nearby Qubbat Duris, a 13th-century Muslim shrine on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek. Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal. As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns out of an original 58; there were only nine before the 1759 earthquakes and six today.\nThe complex is located on a raised plaza erected 5 m (16 ft) over an earlier T-shaped base consisting of a podium, staircase, and foundation walls. These walls were built from about 24 monoliths, at their lowest level weighing approximately 300 tonnes (330 tons) each. The tallest retaining wall, on the west, has a second course of monoliths containing the famous \"Three Stones\" (Ancient Greek: Τρίλιθον, Trílithon): a row of three stones, each over 19 m (62 ft) long, 4.3 m (14 ft) high, and 3.6 m (12 ft) broad, cut from limestone. They weigh approximately 800 tonnes (880 tons) each. A fourth, still larger stone is called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman: it lies unused in a nearby quarry 800 m (2,600 ft) from the town. Its weight is estimated at 1,000 tonnes (1,100 tons). A fifth, still larger stone weighing approximately 1,200 tonnes (1,300 tons) lies in the same quarry.  This quarry was slightly higher than the temple complex, so no lifting was required to move the stones.\nThe temple complex was entered from the east through the Propylaea (προπύλαιον, propýlaion) or Portico, consisting of a broad staircase rising 20 feet (6.1 m) to an arcade of 12 columns flanked by 2 towers. Most of the columns have been toppled and the stairs were entirely dismantled for use in the nearby later wall, but a Latin inscription remains on several of their bases stating that Longinus, a lifeguard of the 1st Parthian Legion, and Septimius, a freedman, gilded their capitals with bronze in gratitude for the safety of Septimius Severus's son Antoninus Caracalla and empress Julia Domna.\nImmediately behind the Propylaeum is a hexagonal forecourt reached through a threefold entrance that was added in the mid-3rd century by the emperor Philip the Arab. Traces remain of the two series of columns which once encircled it, but its original function remains uncertain. Donne reckoned it as the town's forum. Badly preserved coins of the era led some to believe this was a sacred cypress grove, but better specimens show that the coins displayed a single stalk of grain instead.\nThe rectangular Great Court to its west covers around 3 or 4 acres (1.2 or 1.6 ha) and included the main altar for burnt offering, with mosaic-floored lustration basins to its north and south, a subterranean chamber, and three underground passageways 17 ft (5.2 m) wide by 30 ft (9.1 m) high, two of which run east and west and the third connecting them north and south, all bearing inscriptions suggesting their occupation by Roman soldiers. These were surrounded by Corinthian porticoes, one of which was never completed. The columns' bases and capitals were of limestone; the shafts were monoliths of highly polished red Egyptian granite 7.08 m (23.2 ft) high. Six remain standing, out of an original 128. Inscriptions attest that the court was once adorned by portraits of Marcus Aurelius's daughter Sabina, Septimius Severus, Gordian, and Velius Rufus, dedicated by the city's Roman colonists. The entablature was richly decorated but is now mostly ruined. A westward-facing basilica was constructed over the altar during the reign of Theodosius; it was later altered to make it eastward-facing like most Christian churches.\n\nThe Temple of Jupiter—once wrongly credited to Helios—lay at the western end of the Great Court, raised another 7 m (23 ft) on a 47.7 m × 87.75 m (156.5 ft × 287.9 ft) platform reached by a wide staircase. Under the Byzantines, it was also known as the \"Trilithon\" from the three massive stones in its foundation and, when taken together with the forecourt and Great Court, it is also known as the Great Temple. The Temple of Jupiter proper was circled by a peristyle of 54 unfluted Corinthian columns: 10 in front and back and 19 along each side. The temple was ruined by earthquakes, destroyed and pillaged for stone under Theodosius, and 8 columns were taken to Constantinople (Istanbul) under Justinian for incorporation into the Hagia Sophia. Three fell during the late 18th century. 6 columns, however, remain standing along its south side with their entablature. Their capitals remain nearly perfect on the south side, while the Beqaa's winter winds have worn the northern faces almost bare. The architrave and frieze blocks weigh up to 60 tonnes (66 tons) each, and one corner block over 100 tonnes (110 tons), all of them raised to a height of 19 m (62.34 ft) above the ground. Individual Roman cranes were not capable of lifting stones this heavy. They may have simply been rolled into position along temporary earthen banks from the quarry. The Julio-Claudian emperors enriched its sanctuary in turn. In the mid-1st century, Nero built the tower-altar opposite the temple. In the early 2nd century, Trajan added the temple's forecourt, with porticos of pink granite shipped from Aswan at the southern end of Egypt.\nThe Temple of Bacchus—once wrongly credited to Jupiter—may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s, as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter. It is the best preserved of the sanctuary's structures, as the other rubble from its ruins protected it. It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity. The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns—8 along each end and 15 along each side—nearly 20 m (66 ft) in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood, but the keystone of the lintel had slid 2 ft (1 m) following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column. The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake. The interior of the temple is divided into a 98 ft (30 m) nave and a 36 ft (11 m) adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised 5 ft (2 m) above it and fronted by 13 steps. The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune, Triton, Arion and his dolphin, and other marine figures but these have been lost. The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications, although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688. Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate, but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria's governor Rashid Pasha. Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof.\n\nThe Temple of Venus—also known as the Circular Temple or Nymphaeum—was added under Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century but destroyed under Constantine, who raised a basilica in its place. Jessup considered it the \"gem of Baalbek\". It lies about 150 yd (140 m) from the southeast corner of the Temple of Bacchus. It was known in the 19th century as El Barbara or Barbarat el-Atikah (St Barbara's), having been used as a Greek Orthodox church into the 18th century.\nThe ancient walls of Heliopolis had a circumference of a little less than 4 mi (6 km). Much of the extant fortifications around the complex date to the 13th century reconstruction undertaken by the Mamluk sultan Qalawun following the devastation of the earlier defenses by the Mongol army under Kitbuqa. This includes the great southeast tower. The earliest round of fortifications were two walls to the southwest of the Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus. The original southern gateway with two small towers was filled in and replaced by a new large tower flanked by curtains, probably under Buri or Zengi. Bahramshah replaced that era's southwest tower with one of his own in 1213 and built another in the northwest in 1224; the west tower was probably strengthened around the same time. An inscription dates the barbican-like strengthening of the southern entrance to around 1240. Qalawun relocated the two western curtains nearer to the western tower, which was rebuilt with great blocks of stone. The barbican was repaired and more turns added to its approach. From around 1300, no alterations were made to the fortifications apart from repairs such as Sultan Barkuk's restoration of the moat in preparation for Timur's arrival.\nMaterial from the ruins is incorporated into a ruined mosque north of downtown and probably also in the Qubbat Duris on the road to Damascus. In the 19th century, a \"shell-topped canopy\" from the ruins was used nearby as a mihrab, propped up to show locals the direction of Mecca for their daily prayers.\nUnder a white dome further towards town is the tomb of Khawla, daughter of Hussein and granddaughter of Ali, who died in Baalbek while Husayn's family was being transported as prisoners to Damascus.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nHeliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric Heliopolis in Augustamnica) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it disappeared due to the Islamic rule.\nIn 1701, Eastern Catholics (Byzantine Rite) established anew an Eparchy of Baalbek, which in 1964 was promoted to the present Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek.\n\nTitular see\nIn the Latin Church, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal Titular bishopric, promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis in Phoenicia.\nThe title has not been assigned since 1965.

          "summary": "Baalbek (; Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ, romanized: Baʿlabakk; Syriac: ܒܥܠܒܟ) is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km (42 mi) northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.\nBaalbek's history dates back at least 11,000 years. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, Greek for \"Sun City\"). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.\nIn the modern era, Baalbek is a tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the Great Umayyad Mosque, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named Hajar al-Hibla. Baalbek's tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975–1990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).\nBaalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah's heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.\nIsrael has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.",

          "content": "Baalbek (écrit aussi Balbek, Baalbeck, Baalback, Balbeck, Balback ou Baalbec, en arabe بعلبك), ou Héliopolis à l'époque hellénistique, est une ville du Liban d'environ 80 000 habitants, chef-lieu du district de Baalbek.\nLa ville antique se situe dans le nord de la plaine de la Bekaa ; elle est composée de ruines de l’époque gréco-romaine, ainsi que de traces plus anciennes de l’époque sémitique. Le site figure sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO.\nLe complexe de trois temples géants laissés par les Romains comprend :\n\nle temple de Bacchus, un des temples les mieux conservés du monde gréco-romain ;\nle temple de Jupiter dont il reste six colonnes de granite ;\nle temple de Vénus.\n\nHistoire\nPériode phénicienne\nL’histoire de Baalbek remonte au moins à la fin du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. Baalbek était une ville phénicienne florissante où était célébré le culte de Baal chez les Phéniciens et les Cananéens. Cette divinité orientale, dieu de la foudre qui donnait aussi des pluies bienfaisantes, formait avec Astarté, sa parèdre féminine, le couple divin le plus populaire dans la zone phénico-cananéenne.\n\nPériodes hellénistique et romaine\nDurant l'époque hellénistique, la ville est appelée Héliopolis (litt.« Cité du Soleil »). Selon certaines hypothèses, ce nom fut donné car les Grecs associaient Hélios, dieu du Soleil, à Adad, divinité mésopotamienne de l'Orage et de la Fertilité. D’autres affirment que la ville antique reçut ce nom à l’époque romaine, lorsque Marc Antoine la concéda à Cléopâtre. Les vestiges visibles remontent surtout à l’époque romaine.\nLa ville fut conçue sur un plan classique. Les rues s’y organisèrent en damier sur la base de deux grandes artères, le decumanus et le cardo. Le site comporte trois sanctuaires principaux : ceux de Jupiter, de Bacchus et de Vénus, bâtis par les empereurs Néron, Trajan, Hadrien et Antonin le Pieux.\n\nC’est pour montrer la toute-puissance de l’Empire romain qu’Auguste décida la construction d’un grand sanctuaire à Héliopolis. Les travaux commencés sous son règne, vers -14, se prolongèrent pourtant jusqu’à la fin du IIe siècle. Le sanctuaire fut bâti en conformité avec les principes caractérisant l’architecture religieuse romaine, et les éléments du décor furent empruntés au répertoire ornemental gréco-romain, mais l’organisation tint compte des usages religieux de l’Orient. À titre d’exemple, les autels de Baalbek étaient beaucoup plus importants que ceux des sanctuaires romains. De même, les temples comportent des escaliers, à côté de leur entrée principale, qui permettent d’accéder au toit. Ceci servait sans doute à des activités culturelles orientales. Or, ce genre d’escaliers n’existe pas dans les temples romains.\nÀ la même époque, les cultes orientaux originaux se transformèrent en cultes mystiques destinés à consacrer la renaissance après la mort. Dans ce contexte, le sanctuaire de Bacchus commença à connaître un grand succès, notamment dans les cités de la côte phénicienne. Puis, les mystères de Bacchus conquirent Rome. Cette évolution fit qu’Adonis fut assimilé à Bacchus, et non à Hermès, et amena à lui dédier un grand temple dont la décoration intérieure comporte maintes allusions à sa personnalité divine.\nC'est dans cette ville que fut exhumée la statue de Jupiter héliopolitain, ou « bronze Sursock », acquis par le musée du Louvre en 1939 (bronze doré, hauteur 38,4 cm).\n\nMoyen Âge et époque moderne\nPlusieurs tremblements de terre, destructions et autres constructions médiévales firent perdre à Baalbek une partie de sa splendeur ancienne. Le dernier grand tremblement de terre date de 1759 et fit s’effondrer trois des neuf colonnes du temple de Jupiter.\nLe site archéologique fut transformé en citadelle arabe[Quand ?]. Une mosquée fut construite sur le site à l’aide de pierres trouvées sur place ; les murs du temple de Jupiter furent déplacés de quelques mètres pour en faire une muraille.\n\nÉpoque contemporaine\nBaalbek devient un site touristique dès la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle. Un premier Hôtel, le Grand Hôtel de Palmyre, communément appelé Palmyra est bâti par Perikili D. Mimekakis, un grec de Constantinople, et ouvre en 1874 et l'accès aux vestiges est contrôlé et payant à partir de 1887. Le Kaiser allemand Guillaume II visite la ville les 10 et 11 novembre 1898 et des fouilles archéologiques allemandes y débutent le mois suivant. En 1902, une gare permet de desservir le site via le chemin de fer de Beyrouth à Damas.\nBaalbek est multiconfessionnelle, les deux tiers de ses habitants sont chiites et elle comprend d'importantes minorités chrétiennes et sunnites (dont est issu le maire de la ville élu en 2022). Elle est par ailleurs réputée pour sa vie intellectuelle et culturelle.\nLa ville est visée par les bombardements israéliens lors de la guerre de 2024. Celle-ci est plus meurtrière que la guerre de 2006, les immeubles d'habitation étant directement ciblés par l'aviation israélienne. En un mois, une cinquantaine de personnes ont été tuées et des dizaines blessées. Le 31 octobre, l'armée israélienne ordonne à la population de la ville et des localités alentour de fuir, puis tue une vingtaine de personnes dans des bombardements. Plusieurs raids israéliens font des dizaines de morts en novembre, tandis que les autorités libanaises annoncent leur intention de déposer plainte après des frappes sur des sites patrimoniaux. Le gouverneur de la région recense 960 morts dans la zone pendant les deux mois de guerre, en majorité des civils.\nAmnesty International adresse à l'ONU, le 12 décembre 2024, un rapport documentant ce que cette organisation considère comme des crimes de guerre de l'armée israélienne ; parmi les quatre cas emblématiques évoqués dans le rapport figure la frappe israélienne sur Baalbeck le 21 octobre 2024 : une famille entière est décimée dans son sommeil, alors qu'Amnesty ne trouve « aucune preuve de présence d'objectifs militaires dans le bâtiments ou ses environs immédiats ».\n\nDescription du site\nSanctuaire de Bacchus\nLe sanctuaire de Bacchus, construit au IIe siècle, est le mieux conservé. On y pénètre par un escalier à trois volées, comme dans le temple de Jupiter. Le temple lui-même est périptère.\nBien que de dimensions inférieures à celles du temple de Jupiter (69 mètres de long sur 36 de large avec des colonnes hautes de 22 mètres), il figure, lui aussi, parmi les plus grands temples du monde romain.\nIl se composait d’un pronaos précédé de huit colonnes et d’une cella, entourée de demi-colonnes, comportant au fond un escalier menant à un adyton où trônait la statue du dieu. Ses 42 colonnes supportent un entablement relié au mur de la cella par d’énormes dalles. Sur l’un d’entre eux qui est à terre, on voit un serpent mordre Cléopâtre. Ce portail très fin est classé parmi les plus beaux du monde romain.\nÀ l’angle sud-est du temple, se dresse une tour mamelouke datant du XVe siècle. Elle servait de résidence au gouverneur de la citadelle. Derrière le mur fortifié et le temple, se trouve encore une mosquée remontant au temps des Ayyoubides.\n\nGrande cour\nLa grande cour ou la cour des sacrifices, très étendue (134 et 112 mètres), était entourée d’un élégant portique dans lequel s’ouvraient quatre exèdres semi-circulaires et huit rectangulaires. Au centre de ce vaste espace, s’élevaient un autel pour les sacrifices et une tour flanquée de deux colonnes de granite rouge et gris dont il ne reste que de rares vestiges. La tour servait probablement de lieu utilisé par les pèlerins pour suivre les cérémonies. Elle fut détruite vers la fin du IVe siècle pour donner place à une basilique chrétienne qui fut, elle aussi, détruite à une époque ultérieure. Il ne reste de la basilique que quelques parcelles de l’autel, notamment des parties en bois qui abritaient les fidèles ainsi que de grandes parties du portique et de ses éléments décoratifs.\n\nCour hexagonale\nÀ côté de la cour des sacrifices, la cour hexagonale de 50 mètres de long, à ciel ouvert, construite dans la première moitié du IIIe siècle, était entourée à l’origine d'un portique de 30 colonnes et de quatre exèdres rectangulaires richement décorés.\nCette cour fut également transformée en église dédiée à la Sainte Vierge entre la fin du IVe et le début du Ve siècle. La ville est un ancien évêché.\n\nTemple de Jupiter\nLe temple de Jupiter, le plus ancien, fut construit en plusieurs étapes. Le temple était déjà bien avancé sous Néron, mais l’ensemble ne fut achevé et inauguré qu’au IIIe siècle. On y accède par un propylée : un escalier monumental conduit à un portique à douze colonnes encadré de deux tours. Selon une inscription latine, un légionnaire aurait fait recouvrir d’or l’un des deux chapiteaux des colonnes. Par un escalier monumental à trois volées, les prêtres atteignaient le temple de Jupiter dont ne subsistent que six colonnes, hautes de vingt-deux mètres, avec une base de 2,20 mètres de diamètre. Ce temple est le plus grand (88 mètres sur 48) de tout le monde romain, à l'exception du grand temple de Tarse qui lui est supérieur. Il était probablement périptère, avec dix colonnes en façade et dix-neuf sur les longs côtés. Si son plan intérieur était similaire à celui du temple de Bacchus, il comportait un pronaos précédé de huit colonnes et d’une cella.\n\nSanctuaire du « temple de Vénus »\nAu sud de la cour hexagonale du sanctuaire de Jupiter se trouve un petit sanctuaire avec deux temples.\n\nTemple pseudopériptère\nLe premier est un petit temple pseudopériptère, c'est-à-dire avec des demi-colonnes placées sur la cella. Il a des chapiteaux corinthiens à feuilles pleines et mesure environ 25 m de long et 12,5 m de large. Le temple a été fouillé dans les années 1960 par l'administration libanaise des antiquités et partiellement restauré. Son attribution est inconnue ; sa période de construction se situe vraisemblablement au début de l'Empire romain.\n\nTemple rond, dit temple de Vénus\nLe temple rond, voisin du précédent et perpendiculaire à son axe, a été  longtemps connu sous le nom de temple de Vénus, bien que cette affectation soit aujourd'hui abandonnée. Le temple rond, avec les temples de Jupiter et de Bacchus, est l'un des trois édifices restés toujours visibles et donc toujours connus des habitants. Il se caractérise autant par l’originalité de son plan circulaire que par l’harmonie de ses formes, dans une cité où les autres sanctuaires sont marqués par le gigantisme. La forme de son podium incurvé et la conception de la cella qui en résulte, avec ses colonnes à chapiteaux corinthiens à cinq faces, sont uniques et souvent qualifiées de « baroques ». Ce temple rond mesure près de 16 m de large et 28 m de long avec son portique, le podium mesure 2,91 m de haut et la hauteur des colonnes atteint 8,56 m. L'édifice date probablement du IIIe siècle apr. J.-C.\n\nCarrières\nDans une carrière située près de la cité, on peut découvrir la pierre de la femme enceinte, l'une des plus grandes pierres taillées au monde, avec 21 m de long pour 4,5 m de hauteur et de largeur et une masse d’environ 1 000 à 1 200 tonnes.\n\nLa ville aujourd’hui\nLa zone verte de Baalbek est connue sous le nom de Ras El Ayn (رأس العين) ; il s’agit d’une grande zone verte formée d’un boulevard ovale.\n\nFestival international de Baalbek\nLe Festival international de Baalbek est un grand événement culturel, organisé en été.\nDes activités culturelles sont organisées dans les ruines romaines à partir de 1955. En 1956, gérée par des bénévoles, l’association prend le nom officiel de « Festival international de Baalbek ». Cette institution, soutenue par le président de la République de l’époque, Camille Chamoun, devient alors une des institutions officielles du gouvernement dont la mission est de promouvoir la vie culturelle et touristique du pays. En 1966, le festival fonde une école d’art dramatique dans le but de promouvoir le théâtre libanais.\nEn vingt ans, le Festival international de Baalbek a acquis une renommée internationale et les artistes du monde entier et de toute discipline viennent s'y produire : des compagnies de danse (l'Australian Ballet, The Royal Ballet, l'Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater…), des orchestres (l'Orchestre symphonique du Liban, l'Orchestre symphonique de Pittsburgh, l'Orchestre philharmonique de New York…), des solistes (Henri Goraïeb, Abdel Rahman El Bacha, Claudio Arrau…) des chanteurs lyriques, de jazz ou de variété (Plácido Domingo, Ella Fitzgerald, Johnny Hallyday…) et des compagnies de théâtre (la Comédie-Française, le Théâtre national Wallonie-Bruxelles.\nLes activités du Festival international de Baalbek ont été interrompues en 1975, durant la guerre civile, jusqu'à la reprise, en 1997.\n\nRelations internationales\nJumelage\nLa ville de Baalbek est jumelée avec les villes suivantes :\n\n Bari (Italie),\n L'Aquila (Italie),\n Thrace (Grèce),\n Aix-en-Provence (France).\n\nPersonnalité notable\nEudoxie d'Héliopolis, martyre chrétienne\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nLina Murr Nehmé, Baalbek la Phénicienne, Aleph et Taw, François-Xavier de Guibert, 2001\n\nLiens externes\n\nRessource relative à la géographie : Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire \nRessource relative à l'architecture : Liste du patrimoine mondial \nRessource relative aux beaux-arts : Grove Art Online  \n\ncité romaine\n(ar + fr + en) Fiche de la Municipalité de Baalbek - Localiban\nPanorama interactif en 360 degrés du temple de Baal a Baalbek - Par Melkan Bassil\nDaguerréotypes de Balbec sur La BNF par Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey\n\n Portail des Phéniciens et de la civilisation carthaginoise   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail du Liban",

          "content": "## Overview\nBaalbek بَعلبَك is one of the most spectacular archaeological sites in Lebanon and one of the country's UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Baalbeck or 'Heliopolis' as it was known is the site of great ancient temples built by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and other civilisations that have conquered the region and enjoyed the fertile soil of the Bekaa Valley. Some of the most celebrated temples are the ones of Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, and Jupiter, the Roman god of light, of the sky and weather.\n\n## By bus\nBuses to Baalbek from Beirut leave the Cola intersection frequently and cost 7,000 LL. During the summer season daily tours are available from Beirut to Baalbeck from most major hotels; tour operator Nakhal has a guided coach tour several days a week for US$70. The trip takes about two hours each way.\nIt is possible to travel from Homs in Syria to Baalbek by bus. Buses leave from the Karnak or Luxury coach stations in Homs and cross into Lebanon at al-Qa'a, arriving soon thereafter at Baalbek. Cost is about US$10.\n\n## See\nVisiting the ruins of Baalbeck costs 15 000 LL. The ruins consist of several temples and buildings:\nTemple of Bacchus (Small Temple).\nTemple of Jupiter. 1st century AD.\nGreat Court.\nTemple of Venus.\nHexagonal Forecourt.\n\n## Do\nHajar al-Hubla. When you visit Baalbeck, be sure to drop by Abd an-Nabi al-Afi, the fellow who is caretaker to possibly the largest cut stone to be found anywhere on Earth (Hajar al-Hubla). He's working hard to clean up the environment a little bit, and he even offers tours of the area. Ask him to take you to the cafe up on the hill for an evening view of the valley.\n\n## Events\nEvery summer the Baalbeck International Festival offers performances from local and international artists. In the past performers ranged from Sting, Vanessa Mae and Phil Collins to plays by the celebrated Lebanese Rahbani brothers.\n\n## Buy\nDo not buy antiquities as they are most likely fake. This is the center of the fake coin industry. Insist on a certificate of authenticity, and pay by credit card and keep your receipt. At least then you can charge back the dealer when you learn you have been deceived. Real antiquities could also be from illegal digs, don't buy them either.\nYou will probably also be touted some yellow Hezbullah T-shirts while you are at Baalbeck, as it is the birthplace of that party. If you choose to buy one beware: these T-shirts will self-destruct in the laundry, losing all of their green ink in the wash. That aside, they are an interesting souvenir. They should only cost 1,000 LL, not the 15,000 LL they'll ask.\n\n## Pastries\nOriental pastries are offered by Patisserie Jawhari, there you can find traditional sweets from Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The most famous sweet there is called \"namoura bel ashta\" (namoura with cream). The cream is extracted from fresh boiling milk. More pastries are found including knefe and neqlawa.\n\n## Drink\nEvery summer there are outdoor sheesha bars, they also serve food, drinks, desserts.\n\n## Sleep\n34.00342336.2046711 Hotel Palmyra, ☏ +961 3 371 127.

          "content": "The Temple of Bacchus is part of the Baalbek archaeological site, in Beqaa Valley region of Lebanon. The temple complex is considered an outstanding archaeological and artistic site of Imperial Roman Architecture and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. This monument to Bacchus is one of the best preserved and grandest Roman temple ruins; its age is unknown, but its fine ornamentation can be dated to the second century CE.\n\nHistory\nThe temple was probably commissioned by Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius (r. AD 138-161).  No information was recorded about the site until a 4th-century Greek conquest, by which point the temple would likely have been closed due to the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. When the complex fell into disrepair, the Temple of Bacchus was possibly protected by the rubble of the rest of the site's ruins. \nIt was not until 1898–1903 that a German expedition excavated two of the large temples and began reconstructions on the site. In 1920, the State of Greater Lebanon was proclaimed and protections and repairs of the site were mandated by the Lebanese government. \nIn the mid-1970's the Lebanese civil war broke out and protections of the site ceased as Al-Biqā became a stronghold for Palestinian and Syrian forces.  In 1984 the ruins at Baalbek were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Preservation of the site began in the 1990s following the end of the war. \nThe German Archaeological Institute's Orient Department has done a number of archaeological excavations and research on The Temple of Bacchus and the entire temple complex.\n\nArchitecture\nThe temple is 66 m long, 35 m wide and 31 m high, making it only slightly smaller than the Temple of Jupiter. The podium on which the temple sits is on an East-West axis.  The peripheral wall is adorned by a colonnade of forty-two unfluted Corinthian columns with Ionic bases,\nnineteen of which remain upright. There are eight columns along each end and fifteen along each side —nearly 20 m (66 ft) in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The columns support a richly carved entablature, which includes an architrave with a three-banded frieze that is decorated with alternating bulls and lions and cornice ornamented with geometric and floral patterns. \nInside, the cella is decorated with Corinthian pilasters flanking two levels of niches on each side. The parapets are decorated with dancing Maenads, supporting the attribution of the temple to Bacchus. The interior of the temple is divided into a 98 ft (30 m) nave and a 36 ft (11 m) adytum or sanctuary  on a platform raised 5 ft (2 m) above it and fronted by 13 steps.\nThe entrance was preserved as late as the 16th century, but the keystone of the lintel had slid 2 ft (1 m) following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column.  Some historic Roman coins depict the structure of this temple along with Temple of Jupiter.\nThe Temple is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity.  There are four sculptures carved within the peristyle that are believed to be depictions of Acarina which would make them the first recognizable representations of mites in architecture.\n\nSee also\nTemple of Jupiter (Baalbek)\nList of Ancient Roman temples\n\nGallery\nNotes\nBibliography\nButcher, Kevin (2003).

          "content": "Byblos ( BIB-loss; Ancient Greek: Βύβλος), also known as Jebeil, Jbeil or Jubayl (Arabic: جُبَيْل, romanized: Jubayl, locally Jbeil [ʒ(ə)beːl]), is an ancient city in the Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate of Lebanon. The area is believed to have been first settled between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. During its history, Byblos was part of numerous cultures including Egyptian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Genoese, Mamluk and Ottoman. Urbanisation is thought to have begun during the third millennium BC when it developed into a city, making it one of the oldest cities in the world,  if not the oldest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIt was in Ancient Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet, the ancestor of the Greek, Latin and all other Western alphabets, was developed.\n\nEtymology\nThe name appears as kbnj in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (fl. 2600 BC) and as Gubla (𒁺𒆷) in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th-dynasty pharaohs Amenhotep III and IV. In the 1st millennium BC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as Gebal (𐤂𐤁𐤋, GBL); in the Hebrew Bible as Geval (גבל); and in Syriac as GBL (ܓܒܠ). Eusebius' Onomasticon stated that Byblos was called \"Gobel / Gebal\" in Hebrew. The name seems to derive from GB (𐤂𐤁, \"well\") and ʾL (𐤀𐤋, \"god\"), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the \"Well of the God\" or \"Source of the God\".\nIts present Arabic name Jubayl (جبيل) or J(e)beil is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root GBL or JBL, meaning \"mountain\". When the Arabic form of the name is used, it is typically rendered Jbeil, Jbail, or Jbayl in English. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in Western records as Gibelet or Giblet. This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship.\nThe Phoenician City, known to the Greeks as Býblos (Βύβλος) and to the Romans as Byblus, was important for their import of papyrus out of Ancient Egypt – to the extent that \"byblos\" came to mean \"papyrus\" in Greek. The English word \"Bible\", therefore, ultimately derives from the Greek name of the city, Βύβλος ('Βύblos / Byblos'), a Greek mumbo-jumble of גְּבָל ('Gāḇal / Gəbal Gobâl'..., that is, 'Gebal' or 'Jebel'), which shares the same root as גְּבוּל ('Gəḇūl / Gābūl, that is 'Gebul' or 'Jabul'), as they're derivatives of ג־ב־ל ('g-ḇ-l' / 'g-b-l' / 'g-v-l'), which means 'twist as a rope', '(be a, set) border' or 'bound(aria)', which tells us that it is a North Boundary of Canaan.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nSituated approximately 42 km (26 mi) north of Beirut, Byblos holds a strong allure for archaeologists due to its accumulations of various strata resulting from countless centuries of human dwelling. The initial excavation was conducted by Ernest Renan in 1860, documented in his work \"Mission de Phénicie\" (1865–1874). This was succeeded by Pierre Montet's efforts from 1921 to 1924, and later by Maurice Dunand, who continued excavations from 1925 for a span of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\".\nFragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal / Baal Hammon in the syncretising system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.) According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos was founded by the Phoenician shrine god El (whom the Greeks identified with their god Cronus). During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size. This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop.\n\nNeolithic and Chalcolithic levels\nNeolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. Jacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937. Tombs from this era were discussed by Emir Maurice Chehab in 1950. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R. Erich in 1954 and Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1964.\n\nDunand's five-level stratigraphy\nPrehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho):\n\nEarly Neolithic (early phase) corresponding to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC;\nEarly Neolithic (late phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC, represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points;\nMiddle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC;\nLate Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC;\nEarly Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and,\nLate Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC.\nThe site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC (Durand's Early Neolithic).\nEarly Neolithic Byblos was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between.\n\nThe original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of 1.2 ha (3.0 acres) providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed. Dwellings were rectangular with plastered floors, pottery was usually Dark faced burnished ware with some shell impressions.\nThe Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than 0.15 ha (0.37 acres) adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors.\nThe Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of \"Canaanite blades\" and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs.\n\nEarly Bronze\nAccording to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen's village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC.  Early Bronze Age remains were characterised by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.\nWatson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt and Middle Kingdom of Egypt Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among \"those who are on his waters\") of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\". Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\".\n\nMiddle Bronze\nObjects have been found at Byblos naming the 12th Dynasty king Senusret II, the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I.\n\nLate Bronze\nThe rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\nAround 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighbouring city-states by the Habiru.\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia. Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favouring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.\nArchaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200–1000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nIron Age\nIn the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki. Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–627 BC), under its kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek.\nIn the Achaemenid Empire (538–332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyr, and Arwad.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\nDuring the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyrus and Zidonia, was a centre for the cult of Adonis.\nKing Herod of Judaea, known for his extensive building projects, including beyond his own kingdom, constructed a city wall for Byblos.\nIn the 3rd century, a small but impressive theatre was constructed. With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly. Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet.\n\nCrusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period\nIn the 12th and 13th century, Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nAs Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet, first as administrators of the city in the name of the Republic of Genoa, and then as a hereditary fief, undertaking to pay an annual fee to Genoa and the church of San Lorenzo (Genoa's Cathedral).\nThe Embriaco family's residence, the Byblos Castle, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, and conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300.\nHaving voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored by Baybars. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nContemporary history\nByblos and all of Lebanon were placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. The 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbour and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power plant.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave Byblos and 33 other cultural sites enhanced protection to safeguard them against damage.\n\nDemographics\nByblos's inhabitants are significantly Christian, mostly Maronite, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shia and Sunni Muslims. It is said that the predominantly  Shi`i city of Bint Jbeil (\"Daughter of Byblos\") in Southern Lebanon was founded by Shi`a migrants from Byblos. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shi`i Muslim.\n\nEducation\nByblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the Pharmacy School, which offers the only Pharm.D. Program outside the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nTourism\nByblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub. With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city. Byblos was crowned as the \"Arab Tour Capital\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut. Byblos was chosen by Condé Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.\n\nThe Byblos archaeological site\nAin el-Malik or King's Spring, about 20 m deep, is a large cavity accessible by spiral stairs. Once it supplied the city with water. According to Plutarch's version of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the king's servants met Isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace, where she found the body of her husband Osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars.\n\nThe L-shaped Temple was erected about 2700 BC.\n\nThe Temple of the Obelisks, originally built in 1600–1200 BC on top of the “L-shaped temple,” was moved by archaeologists to its present location. The many small obelisks found in this temple were used as religious offerings. The sanctuary contained a large number of human figurines made of bronze covered with gold leaf, which are now displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.\nThe royal necropolis dates back to the second millennium BC and contains tombs of the Byblos kings, including King Ahiram.\nThe Bronze Age necropolis of the Gebalite elite, discovered in 2019 at the southern outskirts of the ancient city acropolis.\nThe Roman theater was built around AD 218.\n\nOther historic buildings\nByblos Wax Museum\n\nThe Byblos Wax Museum displays wax statues of characters whose dates of origin range from Phoenician times to current days.\n\nByblos Fossil Museum\n\nThe Byblos Fossil Museum has a collection of fossilised fish, sharks, eel, flying fish, and other marine life, some of which are millions of years old.\n\nMedieval city wall\nThe old medieval part of Byblos is surrounded by walls running about 270m from east to west and 200m from north to south.\n\nByblos Castle\n\nByblos Castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century. It is located in the archaeological site near the port.\n\nSt John the Baptist Church\nWork on the church started during the Crusades in 1115. It was considered a cathedral and was partially destroyed during an earthquake in AD 1170. It was later given to the Maronite bishop as a gift by Prince Yusuf Shihab.\n\nSultan Abduljid Mosque\nThe old mosque by the Castle dates back to the Mamluk period, and adopted the name of Sultan Abdulmejid I after he renovated it.\n\nHistoric Quarter and Souks\nIn the southeast section of the historic city, near the entrance of the archaeological site, is an old market.\n\nByblos International Festival\n\nThis summer music festival is an annual event that takes place in the historic quarter.\n\nTemple of Baalat Gebal\n\nAram Bezikian Museum\nThe Armenian Genocide Orphans' Aram Bezikian Museum is a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the Armenian Genocide and its survivors.\n\nNotable people\nMajdi Allawi (born 1970), Maronite priest, association founder\nJihad Azour (born 1966), economist\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nByblos is twinned with:\n\n Bonifacio, France\n Mangalia, Romania\n Orange, France\n Patras, Greece\n\nGallery\nSee also\nByblos syllabary\nCities of the ancient Near East\nDugurasu\n\nNotes\nReferences\nHead, Barclay; et al.

          "summary": "Byblos ( BIB-loss; Ancient Greek: Βύβλος), also known as Jebeil, Jbeil or Jubayl (Arabic: جُبَيْل, romanized: Jubayl, locally Jbeil [ʒ(ə)beːl]), is an ancient city in the Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate of Lebanon. The area is believed to have been first settled between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. During its history, Byblos was part of numerous cultures including Egyptian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Genoese, Mamluk and Ottoman. Urbanisation is thought to have begun during the third millennium BC when it developed into a city, making it one of the oldest cities in the world,  if not the oldest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIt was in Ancient Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet, the ancestor of the Greek, Latin and all other Western alphabets, was developed.",

Les Grecs la nommèrent Byblos, car c'est de Gebal que le papyrus (en grec ancien βύβλος / búblos) était importé en Grèce.\nElle se situe aujourd’hui sur le site de la ville moderne de Jbeil dans le gouvernorat du Mont-Liban (actuel Liban), sur la côte méditerranéenne, à environ 40 kilomètres au nord de Beyrouth. Elle aurait été fondée vers 5000 av. J.-C. Dès le IVe millénaire av. J.-C., Byblos est un centre commercial actif, négociant surtout avec l’Égypte antique le bois du Liban. Ce rapprochement avec l’Égypte a un effet durable sur l’art et la culture de Byblos, elle devient un centre religieux important où l‘on pratique le culte d’Osiris.\nElle fait aussi commerce de textile et de vêtements avec la Mésopotamie, notamment avec la ville de Mari et également avec les Minoens de Crète. Les souverains amorrites de Byblos se font enterrer dans des tombeaux avec des objets égyptiens (Tombeau d’Ahiram, roi au XIe siècle av. J.-C.). Elle se caractérise aujourd’hui par son antique port de pêche, son site romain et le château de Byblos construit par les croisés au XIIe siècle.\nByblos est une des plus vieilles villes du monde, possiblement la plus vieille, à avoir été continuellement habitée.\n\nHistoire\nByblos est habitée de manière continue depuis plus de 7 000 ans, ce qui en fait l'une des plus anciennes villes du monde. Les traces les plus anciennes d’une occupation humaine sur le site sont celles d’un village de pêcheurs du Néolithique, établi probablement vers 5000 av. J.-C.\n\nDès le milieu du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C., la cité-État de Byblos est colonisée par les Phéniciens et devient un centre religieux important. Le temple de Baalat Gebal était ainsi célèbre dans le monde antique. Les liens entretenus par la ville avec l’Égypte antique sont très étroits et sont à l’origine du rapide développement culturel et religieux de la cité. Byblos est aussi un port actif qui exporte le vin et les bois du Liban vers l'Égypte et importe du papyrus égyptien pour le revendre à travers toute la Méditerranée. L'une des étapes du cabotage vers l'Égypte est le port de Tell Abou Hawan dans la baie de Haïfa. Cette escale contribuera son développement lors de l'épopée cananéenne au Bronze ancien.\nLes historiens modernes proposent que l'ancien nom de la ville, Byblos, dérive du mot grec pour papyrus, βύϐλος (býblos). La ville était en effet pendant l’Antiquité une escale importante pour les navires chargés de papyrus en provenance d’Égypte et se rendant en Grèce. Plus tard le mot dérivé désignera le livre en grec (βιϐλίον / biblíon) et finalement le mot Bible. Une autre version rapportée par Étienne de Byzance au VIe siècle dans les Ethniques renvoie à la divinité Byblis, laquelle aurait trouvé la mort en ce lieu avant de se changer en source.\nByblos est aussi directement associée avec l'histoire et la diffusion de l'alphabet phénicien. C'est à Byblos qu'a été faite la découverte de la plus ancienne inscription phénicienne gravée sur le sarcophage d'Ahiram, origine de notre alphabet contemporain.\n\nByblos aujourd’hui\nL’ancienne cité est entourée de murailles d’époque médiévale comportant des fûts de colonnes antiques inclus dans les murs. Cette méthode de construction est également visible au « Château de la mer » de saint Louis à Sidon (Saïda).\nL’intérieur de la cité abrite une église construite par les Génois, une petite mosquée, un souk d’artisanat local, le château croisé, le site antique et le port.\n\nLe site antique\nLe site antique de Byblos, excavé par Maurice Dunand (archéologue français) de 1924 à 1975, se trouve sur une pointe de terre qui contrôle deux baies, une au nord qui abrite l’actuel port, l’autre au sud. Depuis ce port furent probablement exportés du vin, et une grande quantité de bois de cèdre du Liban vers l’Égypte et la Grèce.\nLe site contient des ruines de toutes les populations qui ont habité la région depuis sa fondation : \n\nle temple en L, ainsi appelé en raison de sa forme, érigé vers 2700 av. J.-C. ;\nle temple aux Obélisques du XVIe siècle av. J.-C., originellement construit au-dessus du temple en L, et déplacé par les archéologues. Au temple se dressent de nombreux obélisques. Dans le sol du temple on a trouvé beaucoup d’offrandes votives comme des statuettes de bronze et d'or qui se trouvent au musée national de Beyrouth ;\ndans une dépression de 20 m de profondeur se trouvait la source Aïn al-Malik. C’est là que, selon la version de Plutarque du mythe d'Osiris, Isis venait pleurer Osiris ;\nla nécropole royale de Byblos remonte au IIe millénaire av. J.-C. et contient les tombes des rois de Byblos, entre autres le sarcophage du roi Ahiram, sur lequel est inscrite la plus vieille transcription phénicienne, aujourd’hui exposé au musée national de Beyrouth ;\nun théâtre romain, construit vers 218 ;\nune colonnade romaine ainsi qu’un nymphée ;\nles murailles de la ville phénicienne ;\nles fortifications perses ;\nune maison traditionnelle libanaise du début du XXe siècle (la maison de Mousbah et Ousman Houssami).\n\nChronologie des rois phéniciens de Byblos\nLe musée Mémoire du temps\nLe musée Mémoire du temps abrite une importante collection de fossiles remontant a 100 millions d'années.

          "content": "## Overview\nTyre (Arabic: Sour صُوْر) is the fourth-largest city in Lebanon. It is particularly noteworthy for its stunning and clean beaches (unlike those at Sidon) as well as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture in the world. Situated on a peninsula, it is the largest city in the south of the country after Sidon.\nTyre is the base of the UNIFIL headquarters which operates in the south of the country, and monitors the border region between Lebanon, Israel and the occupied territories and Syria. Don't be surprised to see UN troops out and about in this town, which is generally very safe for visitors.\n\n## By bus\nThe cheapest way of getting into Tyre is by private bus. Large, air-conditioned buses go from Cola Junction, Beirut, throughout the day for approximately US$4 and take about 2½ hr.\n\n## By minibus\nPrivately run minibuses also go frequently throughout the day and late into the evening from Cola Junction, Beirut and from the bus station in Sidon. They take a variety of routes and will often stop and start throughout the journey to let passengers on and off.\nMinibuses that go via the coastal roads are much slower (Beirut to Tyre can take 3-4 hr), but some minibuses will take the motorway route (2½ hr from Beirut, about 1hr from Sidon). Prices are usually 2–3,000 Lebanese lira from Beirut.\nDo check when you get on board how much the price is as tourists will often be charged more than locals. If you're not sure how much the fare should be, try speaking to someone on the bus - many people speak English and you will very likely find someone to help you out.\n\n## By private taxi\nThere are two ways to get to Tyre via taxi - the first is a simple private hire (US$80-90 from Beirut, per car), or the  'service'  option where you can share with other people who are travelling in a similar direction (US$10 would be reasonable from Beirut to Tyre). The journey will take approximately 2½ hr from Beirut, depending on any stops that have to be made.\n\n## Checkpoint information\nA number of military checkpoints operate on the roads between Beirut, Sidon and Tyre. There are also occasionally other checkpoints which are run by Hezbollah soldiers. If you bus or taxi is asked to stop, make sure you have your passport to hand, and take off any sunglasses or hats to ensure proper identification. Generally you will be waved through without any further problems. Do not be alarmed if you are asked why you are travelling.\n\n## Get around\nWithout a doubt the best way to get around Tyre is on foot. The beachfront and main roads are all within 5-10 min walk from each other. The Al Bass Archaeological site is slightly further away and a taxi may be the easiest option to get there.\nTaxis are pretty cheap and some are even comfortable to travel in. Some are the registered yellow taxis that operate throughout the country, but many are private cars, often in varying states of repair (from virtually new to over 40 years old in some cases). A rough rule of thumb is that a short ride in a 'service' - or shared taxi - will cost approximately 2,000LL, with longer journeys costing up to 5,000LL. Always check the price before entering the taxi, and check whether it is a taxi (and therefore private and more expensive) or a service (which will stop to pick up other passengers on the way, and is much cheaper).\nTraffic is typical Lebanese: if you want to go, you must go regardless of the 'western' way of thinking in the traffic. This means that drivers frequently won't give way unless they absolutely have to, and lanes and road signage are frequently ignored. Of course, do ask your driver to slow down if you don't feel safe.\n\n## See\nAlthough frequently eclipsed by the grandeur of Beirut and the bustling souq of Sidon, Tyre is a beautiful and enjoyable city in its own right. However its small size and distinctive position in the deep south of the country mean that most tourists never get this far. The city's main draw is the astonishing ruins of old Tyre, including the world's best-preserved Roman Hippodrome, have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1984. Enjoying the beautiful beaches and excellent local cuisine is also a favorite pastime for both locals and visitors.\n33.26986335.2139661 Al-Bass Tyre necropolis. The impressive site is huge and also encapsulates a large Necropolis (with several hundred well-preserved sarcophagi), an intact Roman road and aqueduct, and a monumental arch. Situated next to the Al Bass Palestinian Refugee Camp, it is a 10-min car ride from the beach.      (updated Jul 2020)\n33.26908935.2097042 Tyre Hippodrome. By far the most famous attraction, boasting the largest and best-preserved example of a Roman Hippodrome.     (updated Jul 2020)\nHot Spring Ruins. Situated in the Christian district, is another impressive feat of Roman architecture which escaped destruction during recent Israeli bombing campaigns. (updated Jul 2020)\n33.27633935.1933233 Tyre lighthouse. Situated on the north-western tip of the peninsula is a beautiful and quiet spot, perfect for watching the sun go down.    (updated Jul 2020)\nAl Gamal. This is a rocky beach at the southwestern tip of the peninsula where the ruins of an old Phoenician port can be seen. There is a number of hut restaurants on the rocks where you can enjoy the sun and food. Swimming is delightful in the clear water and there is a spot that seems like an ancient swimming pool carved in rock, 1 m deep and some 30 x 20 m in size. (updated Jul 2020)\n\n## Do\nThe souq situated next to the Christian district, is a lively and atmospheric marketplace. Although it does not have the splendour of the large and tourist-driven souq in Sidon, it offers good prices on everything from souvenirs to fresh fish caught that morning.\nThe beach is known throughout Lebanon as being the cleanest and most beautiful in Lebanon, with families from around the country flocking there in the summer. During the summer months (May–September) there are a large number of beach cafes which operate from the huts. Prices can be expensive, but it is a perfect spot for sunbathing and enjoying the impressive waves. During the summer, the sea is warm enough to swim in at night, making it a special place.

          "content": "Sidon ( SY-dən), or Saida ( SY-də, SAH-id-ə; Arabic: صيدا, romanized: Ṣaydā), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located on the Mediterranean coast in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital. Tyre, to the south, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut, to the north, are each about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.\n\nEtymology\nThe Phoenician name Ṣīdūn (𐤑𐤃𐤍, ṢDN) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as ḏjdwnꜣ. It appears in Biblical Hebrew as Ṣīḏōn (Hebrew: צִידוֹן) and in Syriac as Ṣidon (ܨܝܕܘܢ). This was Hellenised as Sidṓn (Ancient Greek: Σιδών), which was Latinised as Sidon and entered English in this form. The name appears in Classical Arabic as Ṣaydūn (صَيْدونْ) and in Modern Arabic as Ṣaydā (صَيْدَا).\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon to honour its imperial sponsor.\nDuring the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as Sagittus and in Old French as Saete, Sayette or Sagette.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.\n\nHistory\nIn antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant Phoenician city. It was nestled on a mainland promontory and boasted two harbors. Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed Tyre to become the paramount city in Phoenicia. In the New Testament era, Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see Biblical Sidon below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nPrehistory\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nMiddle Bronze IIA\nIn late MB IIA, Sidon Level 4 became an important port trading with Egypt (late 12th and early 13th dynasties).\n\nLate Bronze\nLate Bronze II\nAmarna period. Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the Egyptian Empire and ruled by Zimredda of Sidon. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with Abimilku of Tyre in the south, and Rib-Hadda of Byblos in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the kingdom of Amurru with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I of Hatti. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.\nThe oldest testimony documenting words in the Phoenician language of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: \"the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion\". In other words: Mount Hermon was called \"Sirion\", in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.\n\nIron Age\nSidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia.\nDuring the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and purple dye production. The city's glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance. The magnitude of Sidon's purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded Murex trunculus shells discovered near the southern harbor. These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled ‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al, '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\nNebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Sidon's navy played a significant role in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city's coinage. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.\n\nPersian and Hellenistic periods\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic period of Sidon's history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. \nIn exchange for supporting his conquest of Egypt, King Cambyses II of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of Dor, Joppa, and the Plain of Sharon.\nUnder the Diadochi or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus (likely the tomb of King Abdalonymus rather than Alexander), the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\n\nRoman period\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The city was embellished by Herod, king of Judaea, who built there a theatre. By the First Jewish–Roman War, Sidon sheltered enough Jews that local pagans hesitated to attack them during the broader massacre of Jews in Greco-Syrian towns in 66 CE, as documented by Josephus.\nThe Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and an underground Mithraeum was discovered. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. The Philogelos, a Greek-language joke book written circa the 4th century AD, features a series of jokes about Sidonians, who are stereotyped as unintelligent and literal-minded. During the Byzantine Empire, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, the law school of Berytus took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636.\n\nCrusader-Ayyubid period\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\nDuring the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly Jewish families, in Sidon, which he described as a \"large city.\"\n\nOttoman period\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. In 1521, Moses Basola encountered twenty families of Musta'rabi Jews during his visit to Sidon.\nDuring the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.\nDuring the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon, like much of Ottoman Syria, was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named HMS Sidon.\nThe 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of Judean Jews. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as Maghrebi Jews, initially settled in the Chouf Mountains above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and Beirut amidst escalating Druze-Maronite tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new synagogue in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.\nFrom 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sidon was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.\n\nAfter World War I\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\nOn Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA's long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.\nOn 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed two teenage members of a SLA leader's family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60–80 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.\nOn 8 June 1999, two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon's main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on Osbat al-Ansar whose leader had been sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of the head of the Sufi Al-Ahbash movement and the attempted assassination of the mufti of Tripoli. He was believed to be in hiding in the Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp.\nStudies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and landscape\" sections below).\n\nSaida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\n\nPolitics\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).\nThe local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.\nThe El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014–2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.\nThe Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.\nMaarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.\n\nImpact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment\nAccording to a 2013 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\" In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\nThe former Makab (waste dump) and the treatment plant\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the Makab; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the Makab crisis—which has endangered residents' health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 92.99% and Christians made up 6.49% of registered voters in Sidon. 82.16% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 10.83% were Shiite Muslims.\nThe overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut, however by the end of 1990s most of the Jewish population had emigrated leaving their cemetery and other sites in a state of abandonment.\n\nMain sights\nSidon Sea Castle, a fortress built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon.\nSidon Soap Museum. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps.\nKhan al-Franj (\"Caravanserai of the French\"), a complex built in the 16th century, though erroneously credited to Emir Fakhreddine II in the 17th century. It gained its name for accommodating French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries.\nDebbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the Abaza clan in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas.\nThe Castle of St. Louis (Qalaat Al Muizz). It was built by the Crusaders in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the Fatimid caliph Al Muizz. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near Murex Hill.\nEshmun Temple, dedicated to the Phoenician god of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali River.\nThe British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps the only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden, but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened.\n\nEducation\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\n\nArchaeology\nThe following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.\nSidon I, II and III are prehistoric sites, while Sidon I is the tell of ancient Sidon starting from the Early Bronze Age.\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard  in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (c. 3200 BC) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.\n\nBronze Age city and kingdom\nCity of Sidon (Sidon IV site)\nIn the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.\n\nTell el-Burak MBA settlement\nSince the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.\n\nMBA kingdom of Sidon\nArchaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the \"Kingdom of Sidon\" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.\n\nExcavation history\nThe area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):\n\nDakerman (Roger Saidah, 1968–1969)\nTambourit (Saidah, 1977)\nMagharet Abloun (Aimé Péretié, 1855; Ernest Renan, 1864; Georges Contenau, 1920)\nAyaa (William King Eddy, 1887; Osman Hamdi Bey, 1892; Contenau, 1920)\nAin al-Hilweh (Charles Cutler Torrey, 1919–1920)\nEl-Merah (Contenau, 1920)\nQrayé (Contenau, 1920)\nAlmoun, (Conenau, 1924)\nEl-Harah (Theodore Makridi, 1904; Contenau, 1924)\nMagharet Abloun, Greco-Roman part (Renan, 1864; Contenau, 1914–1924)\nHelalié/Baramié/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M. Meurdrac & L. Albanèse, 1938–1939)\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: Mission de Phénicie (1864–1874; Phoenician Expedition).\nThe St. Louis castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the archaeological sites at Sidon to safeguard them from damage.\n\nIn the Bible\nHebrew Bible/Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Bible describes Sidon (צִידוֹן‎) in several passages:\n\nIt received its name from the \"first-born\" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah.\nThe Tribe of Zebulun has a frontier on Sidon\nIt was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city.\nIt was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued.\nThe Sidonians long oppressed Israel.\nFrom the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \"virgin daughter\", rose to its place of pre-eminence.\nSolomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel.\nJezebel was the daughter of King Ithobaal I of Sidon.\nIt was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce.\nIt is frequently referred to by the prophets.\nElijah sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles.\n\nNew Testament\nJesus visited the region or \"coasts\" (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching, leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21-23 to Korazin and Bethsaida. See the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter, which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and Tyre. Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis\nFrom Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome.\n\nIn ancient mythology\nThe account ascribed to the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of Nereus. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.\n\nGallery\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nZugló, Hungary\n Constanța, Romania\n Sofia, Bulgaria\n Sochi, Russia\n\nNotable people\nIn antiquity and the pre-modern era\nChronological list.\n\nEumaeus, character from Greek mythology.

          "content": "Sidon ou Saïda en francais (en phénicien 𐤑𐤃𐤍 / Ṣīdūn ; en grec ancien : Σιδών / Sidṓn ;  en arabe : صيدا / ṣaydā) est une ville du Liban. Elle fut dans l'Antiquité l'une des plus grandes villes de la Phénicie. La ville était construite sur un promontoire s'avançant dans la mer. Ce fut le plus grand port de la Phénicie sous son roi Zimrida (en), au XIVe siècle av. J.-C. Elle est aussi appelée Sagette ou Sayette durant les Croisades (nom donné par les Francs) et Sidon dans la Bible. Son nom signifie « pêcherie ».\nElle possède une longue et riche histoire et traversa les siècles avec des destinées diverses au contact des différents peuples qui la contrôlèrent, les Phéniciens, les Assyriens qui la ruinèrent en 677 av. J.-C., les Perses achéménides, les Macédoniens, les Séleucides, les Romains et plus tard les Croisés, les Arabes, les Ottomans, et les Français. La ville moderne est aujourd'hui l'une des plus importantes du Liban.\n\nOrigine du nom\nD'après la Genèse, Sidon aurait été fondée par Tsidone, fils de Canaan, lui-même petit-fils de Noé (Genèse 10,15-10,19).\n\nHistoire\nSidon, métropole phénicienne\nElle est une des principales cités du royaume cananéen aux environs du XVe siècle av. J.-C. Avec Tyr et Byblos, ses rivales, elle développe le commerce maritime. Au XIVe siècle av. J.-C., le maire de Sidon Zimrida entretient une correspondance diplomatique avec le pharaon Akhénaton, comme l'atteste une des lettres d'Amarna. Sidon devient l'un des plus importants ports de la Méditerranée orientale aux environs du XIIIe siècle av. J.-C., avant sa dévastation probable par les Peuples de la mer. Vers 1200 av. J.-C., elle est prise par les Philistins et c'est alors Tyr qui passe au premier plan. Elle est ensuite soumise aux puissances du Proche-Orient.\nD'après la Genèse (composée entre le VIIIe et IIe siècle av. J.-C.), l'antique Sidon est l'une des plus vieilles villes de la côte phénicienne, fondée par Tsidone, fils de Canaan, lui-même petit-fils de Noé.\nTributaire de l'Assyrie, s'étant révoltée, Assarhaddon la détruit en 677 av. J.-C. La ville est reconstruite par les Babyloniens, et reprise par les Perses vers 540 av. J.-C. Sidon accueille régulièrement le satrape de Transeuphratène lors de son passage en Phénicie, et un paradis, résidence satrapique, se trouve à côté de Sidon. Le roi de Sidon est traditionnellement grand-amiral en second de la flotte perse ; Sidon contribue à accroître cette dernière grâce à l'importance de ses chantiers navals. Ainsi, lors des guerres médiques, elle fournit aux Perses des contingents navals à la bataille de Salamine en 480 av. J.-C.\nMais un siècle plus tard, c'est avec les Grecs que les Phéniciens entretiennent des liens commerciaux ; depuis longtemps, Grecs et Phéniciens se connaissent, leurs échanges se sont beaucoup développés : les Grecs avaient emprunté leur alphabet aux Phéniciens, et l'emprunt le plus remarquable des Phéniciens aux Grecs est celui de la monnaie, où apparaît même la chouette d'Athéna. Le poète grec Homère cite Sidon, « le grand marché du bronze », ville « bien peuplée » ; il a salué l'habileté des Phéniciennes de Sidon, dont la fabrication de teinture de pourpre était réputée. La ville avait une tradition réputée dans la production de verre soufflé puis plat également. C'est sur la plage de Sidon — selon la mythologie grecque — que Zeus a enlevé Europe, fille d'Agénor, roi de Tyr. Une légende attribue la fondation de Thèbes (Béotie) à ses habitants. Grands commerçants, les habitants de Sidon, Tyr, Arados et d'autres Phéniciens fréquentent le Pirée, et le roi Straton est honoré à Athènes dès 362. La sujétion de Sidon à l'égard des Perses prend bientôt fin avec le roi Tennès, qui est à l'origine en 351 av. J.-C. de la révolte contre la Perse ; la ville est prise vers 346-345 av. J.-C. et est brûlée après le soulèvement ; elle perd une partie de son territoire et est affaiblie. En 333 av. J.-C., elle se rallie avec enthousiasme à Alexandre le Grand.\n\nChronologie des rois phéniciens de Sidon\nLes deux rois Eshmounazar (ou Eshmun'azar ou Eshmazar ; phénicien : 𐤀𐤔𐤌𐤍𐤏𐤆𐤓, un nom théophore signifiant «Eshmun aide»)), dont le tombeau a été découvert en 1855, et Tabnit (en), qui ont régné vers 575-525 av. J.-C., furent enterrés à Sidon. La chronologie des rois de Sidon est bien connue entre 372 et 333 av. J.-C. par leurs monnaies qui étaient datées annuellement par l'année de règne.\n\nSidon à l'époque hellénistique\nAlexandre le Grand la dote de nouveaux territoires dans l'arrière-pays : elle reçoit en don non seulement la montagne mais aussi une partie de la Bekaa et de l'Anti-Liban. Comme toutes les cités phéniciennes, Sidon a conservé, en 333/332 av. J.-C., ses institutions politiques originales, malgré les occupations assyrienne, babylonienne et perse : elle a un roi entouré d'un Conseil des Anciens. Un nouveau roi, client des Perses, Abdashtart II (Straton II) avait été installé sur le trône de Sidon. Aussi, Alexandre destitue-t-il son successeur immédiat, Abdashtart III (Straton III), considéré comme peu sûr, pour installer sur le trône un membre de l'ancienne famille royale, Abdalonymos. Pour marquer son avènement, les Sidoniens inaugurent alors dans leur monnayage une nouvelle ère, dite « du peuple ». Grâce à sa flotte, Sidon fournit à Alexandre une aide efficace dans le siège qu'il met devant Tyr en 332 av. J.-C..[source insuffisante]\nÀ la mort d'Alexandre en 323 av. J.-C., les Diadoques s'affrontent pour se partager son empire. Antigone le Borgne établit son camp en Phénicie, face à Tyr, et à sa demande, les chantiers navals de Sidon entreprennent la construction de nouveaux navires. Après la défaite d'Antigone à la bataille d'Ipsos, Sidon et Tyr doivent revenir à Ptolémée Ier, mais les villes sont aux mains de Démétrios Ier Poliorcète ; Séleucos Ier et Ptolémée se disputent la Cœlé-Syrie : Séleucos revendique les deux villes, sans pouvoir d'abord les obtenir. Ce n'est que beaucoup plus tard, vers 288/286 av. J.-C., que Ptolémée parvient à les conquérir.\nDès lors, en raison de leur très important rôle économique et militaire, les villes de Sidon, Tyr et Arados bénéficient de la bienveillance du roi lagide ; mais en se transformant en cités aux mœurs grecques, leurs institutions changent. Des concours grecs y sont organisés dans les palestres et les gymnases ; le boxeur Sillis de Sidon participe au concours à Délos en 269 av. J.-C. ; un habitant de Sidon participe même à la course de char aux jeux néméens, preuve qu'il est bien reconnu comme Grec : Sidon est donc considérée comme une ville grecque à la fin du IIIe siècle ou au début du IIe siècle av. J.-C. Des concours en l'honneur de l'Apollon de Delphes sont même organisés dans cette ville. La rapidité de l'hellénisation des Phéniciens se traduit aussi dans l'importante vie intellectuelle qui se développe à Sidon : dès le IIIe siècle av. J.-C., le philosophe stoïcien Zénon de Sidon est l'élève de Zénon de Cition. Sur le plan politique, il n'y a plus de roi à Sidon au plus tard en 278 av. J.-C., quand meurt Philoclès, le successeur d'Abdalonymos ; des agoranomes sont régulièrement attestés à Sidon, qui a sans doute aussi un juge, (δικαστής, dikastès), et un archonte. Tous les magistrats connus à Sidon portent d'ailleurs des noms grecs.\nLes troubles reprennent avec la cinquième guerre de Syrie, à partir de 202 av. J.-C. : Antiochos III veut conquérir la Syrie lagide ; il est vainqueur à la bataille de Panion de l'Étolien Scopas qui se réfugie à Sidon, mais la ville capitule à l'automne 199 av. J.-C., malgré trois armées de secours accourues pour la sauver. Ville de garnisons lagides, Sidon avait abrité nombre de mercenaires venus d'Asie Mineure. Après la conquête séleucide, ces mercenaires venus de Pamphylie, de Pisidie ou de Phrygie forment l'élite des phalanges et sont depuis longtemps hellénisés, comme l'attestent leurs noms grecs et le style parfaitement grec des stèles de Sidon. Dans les domaines intellectuel et artistique, Tyr et Sidon constituent de grands centres pour les lettres grecques : la philosophie stoïcienne est représentée par Antipatros de Sidon (vers 170 av. J.-C. / 100 av. J.-C.) qui est l'auteur d'épigrammes, et par Boéthos de Sidon, élève de Diogène de Babylone, qui s'occupe de cosmologie. La philosophie épicurienne est illustrée par Zénon de Sidon (IIe – Ier siècles av. J.-C. ; à ne pas confondre avec un autre Zénon de Sidon, stoïcien). Un philosophe phénicien, Moschus de Sidon, passe pour avoir été l'inventeur de la théorie des atomes, que Démocrite aurait reprise par la suite.\nReconnue sacrée et asyle en 122 av. J.-C., Sidon devient libre vers 112/110 av. J.-C., et frappe monnaie pour son propre compte dès 107 av. J.-C., inaugurant ainsi l'étalon phénicien.\n\nSidon à l'époque romaine\nSidon est honorée du titre de navarchis qui reconnaît son rôle essentiel de ville amirale, lieu de mouillage pour la flotte de guerre romaine, la classis syriaca. Cependant, la ville n'échappe pas aux luttes de factions, et Auguste la réduit en esclavage, aux dires de Dion Cassius.\nSous l'empire, Sidon continue à se distinguer surtout en matière d'artisanat : sa réputation est si grande dès l'Antiquité que les auteurs anciens tenaient la verrerie pour une invention de la Phénicie ; d'abord moulé, le verre a ensuite été soufflé et a permis une large diffusion de vaisselle dans cette matière, en particulier de petits vases à parfums, à onguents ou à cosmétiques ; Sidon réalise une production luxueuse de verres incrustés de pierreries ou à couleurs mêlées : des verres de luxe sortent de l'officine célèbre d'Ennion de Sidon, et certains artisans signent leurs productions de leur nom, comme Artas, Philippos ou Neikôn, en gage de qualité. L'industrie de la pourpre s'est aussi largement développée à Sidon comme à Tyr, grâce à la présence du murex et à la possibilité de trouver des textiles de qualité, car il s'agit de teindre des étoffes : production de grand luxe en raison du coût de la teinture, les étoffes teintes en pourpre de Sidon sont destinées à la cour impériale romaine et aux membres des ordres supérieurs. La colline de murex qui s'élève encore aujourd'hui à Sidon témoigne des quantités considérables de coquillages qui furent nécessaires à cette production. L'artisanat du textile en Phénicie n'est pas moins réputé. Décrivant Cléopâtre, le poète latin Lucain évoque un voile arachnéen provenant d'une soie brute chinoise teinte à Sidon puis retissée : « La blancheur de son sein éclate à travers un voile de Sidon, tissé par le peigne des Sères et dont l'aiguille des Égyptiennes a desserré le tissu clair et large ». La ville jouit d'une grande réputation pour le travail du bronze, et possède des associations de couteliers et de charpentiers.\nSidon et Tyr font partie de la Haute-Galilée, souvent citées dans les Évangiles de Luc, Marc et Mathieu, et  témoins du passage du Christ et de ses miracles. Au-dessus de Tyr, Cana de Galilée, lieu du premier miracle du Christ, à la demande de sa mère, et qui avait transformé l'eau en vin, alors que celui-ci était venu à manquer au cours de noces. Sidon est le lieu de rencontre des saints Pierre, qui y prêchait, et de Paul et Luc, de passage pour Rome. Elle abrite également le sanctuaire marial de Maghdouché qui la surplombe, et où la Vierge aurait attendu dans une grotte, Mantara, le Christ qui prêchait dans Sidon, ville païenne. À Sarepta de Sidon (Sarafand), eut lieu le premier miracle du Christ sur une femme cananéenne (non-juive), dont la fille était mourante.\nEn 218, Sidon obtient le titre de metropolis, et en 221-222, l'empereur Héliogabale lui confère le statut colonial avec installation de vétérans.\n\nUn Mithraeum\nHistorique\n141 : le culte de Mithra est introduit au temple d'Echmoun (à 3 km de Sidon) comme l'atteste la dédicace du cippe de Théoddotos : « Au dieu saint Asclépios, Théodotos, prêtre de Mithra, a dédié, l’an 251 [de l’ère de Sidon] » \n\nFin IVe siècle : Dédicace de trois des statues du mithraeum de Sidon par « Flavios Gerontios, pater nomimos |…|». qui témoigne de la longue survivance polythéiste et plus tardive dédicace connue à Mithra, malgré la pression chrétienne.  Virtuosité technique et coût du groupe statuaire et du relief laissent supposer un contexte élitaire.\n391-392:  interdiction des cultes païens et abandon rapide du mithraeum de Sidon qui disparaît des mémoires\nDécouverte rocambolesque et  second oubli qui illustrent la grande période des chasseurs d’antiquités et des pilleurs de tombes, souvent au   service des grandes puissances européennes.\n\n1881 : découverte du mithraeum par les antiquaires Alphonse et Edmond Durighello lors de fouilles clandestines menées à Saïda (Liban), l’ancienne Sidon, alors sous domination ottomane.\n1924 : mort de Joseph-Ange Durighello, dernière personne à prétendre connaître l’emplacement exact du mithréum.\n1967 : don de l’ensemble mithriaque de Sidon au Louvre.\n2013 : J.-M. Saint-Jalm situe le mithraeum sur le terrain de l’archevêché grec catholique melkite de Saïda.\n\nUn temple privé\nL'iconographie témoigne du caractère privé et topique du culte de Mithra, dans lesquels   chaque  groupe d’adeptes forme une combinatoire unique autour de figures sacrées récurrentes. Au sein d'un temple privée la variabilité est la norme. Et c'est autour de figures récurrentes que s'organise une combinatoire locale unique. La particularité iconographique de ce temple est la présence d'Hécate Trimorphe dispensatrice de vie (un parallèle possible avec le triple Mithra?) mais aussi d'une figure léontocéphale (reprenant certains codes de la statuaire égyptienne archaïque). Les figures de Mithra et des dadophores sont plutôt classiques dans les mithraeum même si on y perçoit une influence romaine sur les compagnons de Mithra. Ils sont porteurs de haches doubles (liens possibles avec Jupiter Dolichenus).\n→ Malgré toutes de vastes zones d’ombres persistent concernant le mithraeum de Sidon : peut-être n’en est-il  même pas un? Il s’agirait alors d’un simple dépôt visant à la sauvegarde de sacra mithriaques.\n\nSidon, du Moyen Âge à nos jours\nEn 551, Sidon subit un violent séisme. Ancien évêché, la ville est assez modeste et sans grande importance lorsqu'elle est conquise par le général arabe Yazîd b. Abî Sufyân en 637. Les géographes arabes la décrivent comme une place forte qui servait de port de guerre de Damas.\nElle acquiert de la notoriété à l'époque des Croisades : elle est assiégée en 1107 puis libérée soit contre rançon, soit avec l'aide de secours damascènes. Elle est prise finalement aux mains des croisés en 1110-1111 par les Croisés de Baudouin, roi de Jérusalem, avec l'aide de la flotte norvégienne de Sigurd Ier, après un blocus de 47 jours. Baudouin la donne alors à l'un de ses fidèles barons, Eustache Granier ou Garnier seigneur de Césarée Ses descendants conserveront cette seigneurie jusqu'en 1260.\n\nSidon devient le chef-lieu de la seigneurie de Sagette, englobant le château de Beaufort au sud-ouest, seconde des quatre baronnies du royaume de Jérusalem. Reprise à Renaud Grenier par Saladin en 1187, ses remparts seront rasés. Envahie par les Arabes, rendue aux troupes de Grenier par Saladin avant sa mort, attaquée par les Mongols, Sagette sera vendue par Julien Grenier aux Templiers. La ville sert de refuge aux survivants du siège de Saint-Jean-d'Acre en 1191.\nElle est mise à sac par les Mongols en 1260 ; puis, la même année, tombe sous le contrôle de Templiers jusqu'à sa prise par le Sultanat mamelouk en 1291. De 1291 à nos jours, elle redevient à majorité musulmane.\nElle connaît une nouvelle prospérité aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles. De 1660 à 1775, elle est la capitale d'une province ottomane, l'eyalet de Sidon, avant d'être supplantée par Acre puis par Beyrouth. La France y entretient dès 1616 un consulat : jusqu'à la Révolution française, les marchands marseillais détiennent un quasi-monopole sur le commerce extérieur de « Seyde (Sidon) et dépendances ». Cependant, l'expulsion des Français par Jazzar en 1791 porte un coup fatal à son commerce, ce dont Beyrouth saura profiter. Saïda devient un modeste port de pêche, et le restera jusqu'à nos jours. En 1848, le voyageur historien Baptistin Poujoulat écrit dans Récits et souvenirs d'un voyage en Orient que la ville, « bien mesquine et bien sale », compte 2 600 chrétiens, 2 000 musulmans et 400 Juifs, soit 5 000 habitants.\nEn 1982, lors de l’invasion israélienne du Liban, mille prisonniers palestiniens sont enfermés dans la cour de l’école du couvent Saint-Joseph, pendant des jours. Ils ne reçoivent ni eau ni nourriture ; certains prisonniers boivent leur urine. Les prisonniers sont passés à tabac, certains énucléés, d’autres en meurent ou restent infirmes. Les soldats admettent les mauvais traitements et les actes de barbarie, mais les justifient ; ils n’ont jamais été poursuivis.\n\nSidon aujourd'hui\nC'est la troisième plus grande ville du Liban. Elle est située dans le gouvernorat du Sud du Liban, à environ 40 km au nord de Tyr et à 40 km au sud de la capitale, Beyrouth.\nLa cité offre aujourd'hui une multitude de vestiges à visiter comme le Château de la mer, le château de la terre (Château de Saint-Louis, 1253), le temple d'Eshmoun dont l'édification remonte au VIIe siècle av. J.-C., la médina (la ville médiévale), la colline de Murex, le musée du savon, le Khân el-Franj « La maison des Français » (Ancien consulat de France), etc.\nElle est reliée à Beyrouth par une autoroute. La Place de l'Étoile est le point de départ des liaisons d'autocars vers Beyrouth, Tyr...\nPlusieurs confessions se côtoient à Saïda : musulmans sunnites, chiites, chrétiens maronites et grecs-catholiques, jusqu'aux années 1980, on y trouvait des juifs libanais. La ville comptait quelque 200 000 habitants en 2000. Elle est devenue le centre commercial et financier du Liban du Sud.\nSaïda est la cité natale de l'ancien Premier ministre Rafic Hariri, assassiné à Beyrouth le 14 février 2005 dans un attentat à la voiture piégée.\nLe centre historique de la ville fait partie de la liste indicative au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 1996.\nLe sanctuaire marial de Maghdouché-Sayyedet el Mantara, est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial religieux.\nUn bombardement israélien fait 45 morts et 70 blessés le 29 septembre 2024.

          "content": "Anjar est une ville du Liban dans la plaine de la Bekaa, à peu près à mi-chemin sur la route de Beyrouth à Damas. Sa population est estimée à environ 5 500 habitants et elle est essentiellement d'origine arménienne.\nLe site est actuellement identifié à Chalcis sub Libanum ou Chalcis de Cœlé-Syrie, mais sans preuve formelle. Majdel `Anjar à quelques kilomètres au sud-ouest d’`Anjar où se trouvent les ruines d’un temple romain et qui a été le site d’une bataille pour l’indépendance du Liban dans l’empire ottoman en 1618 est aussi un emplacement proposé pour le site de Chacis.\n`Anjar fut l'exemple d'un centre de commerce à l'intérieur des terres : elle est située à l'intersection de deux routes importantes : celle menant de Beyrouth à Damas dans le sens Ouest-Est et la route Nord-Sud traversant toute la Bekaa et menant d'Homs vers Baalbek puis le sud du Liban.\n\nHistoire\nL'Antiquité\nVers la fin du Ier siècle av. J.-C., à la faveur des désordres qui marquent la fin des Séleucides, les Arabes Ituréens occupent la Bekaa et le Nord du Liban et fondent un vaste royaume dont la capitale politique est Chalcis et la capitale religieuse Héliopolis-Baalbek. Ces Ituréens tentent d'étendre leur pouvoir sur tout le versant occidental du Liban.\nLorsque Pompée, vers 64/63, s'empare de la région, il réorganise l'administration de la région, un certain nombre de cités sont retirées de la principauté ituréenne.\n\nLa période ottomane\nEn 1618, les changements à la tête de l'empire Ottoman permettent le retour triomphal de Fakhr ad-Dîn alors en exil en Toscane. Il reconquiert progressivement ses territoires et reprend tout le Liban même au-delà des frontières de montagnes. En 1623, le vizir ottoman de Damas, Kara Mustafa Pacha attaque Fakhr ad-Dîn. L'affrontement a lieu à `Anjar et malgré des forces en quantité inférieure, Fakhr ad-Dîn l'emporte renforçant sa position au Liban. Il en profite pour étendre son pouvoir jusqu'à Gaza au sud et Alep au Nord. L'année suivante le Sultan Murad IV reconnaîtra son autorité sur ce territoire. Dix ans plus tard le même Murad IV fera arrêter et exécuter Fakhr ad-Dîn.\n\nLa communauté arménienne\nEn 1939, les autorités françaises installent à Anjar des familles entières d’Arméniens originaires des montagnes du Musa Dagh, dans le sandjak d’Alexandrette, l’actuelle Iskenderun turque, que la France a cédée en 1938 à la Turquie en échange de sa neutralité dans la guerre qui couve en Europe.\nAyant déjà subi le génocide de 1915, les Arméniens sont évacués à Anjar. Une cité, dont les six quartiers portent les noms de villages du Musa Dagh, y est créée de toutes pièces. De ce camp de réfugiés, Anjar a évolué en une localité aux apparences cossues.\nLa ville est considérée comme la seconde ville arménienne du Liban.\n\nL'histoire récente\nDe 1984 à 2005, Anjar est le Quartier Général des services de renseignements syriens au Liban. C'est aussi un centre illégal de tri et de détention, contrôlé par services secrets syriens.\nÀ la suite de la découverte d'un charnier, la Syrie a été montrée du doigt. Une enquête a été réalisée et on a conclu que c'était un cimetière ottoman. Le corps le plus ancien date de 50 ans.\n\nLe site d'Anjar\n`Anjar est l'unique site du Liban datant de l'époque omeyyade. `Anjar n'a été découverte par les archéologues qu'à la fin des années 1940.`Anjar diffère des autres sites archéologiques du Liban qui peuvent parfois se prévaloir d'une histoire ininterrompue depuis leur fondation à nos jours. `Anjar paraît n'avoir vécu que quelques décennies au début du VIIIe siècle de notre ère. `Anjar conserve toutefois son mystère : est-elle construite sur l'emplacement de la ville antique Chalcis ?\nDe plan rectangulaire, sur le modèle de la ville ou du camp romain sur un rectangle de 370 m sur 310 m. La ville est entourée d'un mur de sept mètres de hauteur et de deux mètres d'épaisseur, cantonné de trente-six tours et de quatre tours d'angle circulaires. Cette enceinte est construite de pierres calcaires formant les parements intérieur et extérieur, comblés d'un remplissage de pierres brutes, de cailloux et de mortier.\nLes deux voies principales, ornées de colonnades, se coupent sous un tétrapyle comme à Palmyre ou à Apamée. La ville a toutes les apparences d'une ville romaine et cela bien qu'elle soit l'œuvre du calife Omeyyade Al-Walid Ier. Le mystère de cette cité est qu'elle n'a vécu que quelques décennies. Les archéologues ont réussi à redonner vie à cette belle résidence dans les années 1950.\n\nPrincipaux monuments\nLe Grand Palais, premier monument découvert en 1949, dont un mur et les principales arcades ont été reconstruits.\nLa Mosquée, mesurant 45 m sur 32 m et située au Nord du palais, dispose de deux entrées publiques et d'une entrée privée pour le calife.\nLe Petit Palais, recouvert par de riches motifs dans la pure tradition gréco-romaine. Ce monument a gardé son état original.\nLes Thermes, construits sur le modèle romain.\n\nAutres points d'intérêt\nLa source qui donne son nom à la ville se situe juste à l'écart des ruines et constitue un agréable emplacement pour le pique-nique. Les fouilles ne font que commencer sur ce site et un certain nombre d'éléments suggèrent la présence de constructions grecques et romaines : peut-être l'ancienne Chalcis mais ce site est peut-être aussi celui de l’ancienne Zobah. Zobah était la capitale d'un royaume araméen jusqu’au Ier siècle av. J.-C. Ce royaume s'est parfois étendu jusqu'à l'Euphrate vers l'Est et jusqu'à la rivière Yarmûk vers le Sud. Là encore l'identification de Zobah avec Chalcis/`Anjar n'est pas prouvée.\nEnfin il y a le lieu appelé Karak Nuh qui, sur l'emplacement d'un ancien lac et selon la légende locale, serait l'endroit où se serait échouée l'arche de Noé, et où l'on trouve la tombe de Noé.\n\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nChalcis en Syrie\nArméniens du Liban\n\nLiens externes\nDÉCOUVREZ ANJAR (Ministère du Tourisme)\n(en) Site officiel d'Anjar\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\n(ar + fr + en) Fiche de la Municipalité de Aanjar (Haouch Moussa) - Localiban\n\nNotes\n\n Portail du Liban   Portail de l’Arménie   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail du Moyen-Orient",

          "content": "طَرَابُلُس أو طرابلس الشام هي مدينة لبنانية عاصمة محافظة الشمال تكنى بالفيحاء. ثاني أكبر مدن لبنان بعد العاصمة بيروت. تاريخيًا نسب إليها اسم «طرابلس الشام» لتمييزها عن طرابلس الغرب، حيث كانت المدينة تابعة لما سمي بسورية الكبرى ما قبل 1948.\nتقع طرابلس على بعد 85 كيلومتر إلى الشمال من بيروت كما تبعد عن الحدود السورية نحو 40 كيلو مترًا. يمتزج فيها الحاضر بالتاريخ. وعرفت طرابلس منذ القدم بموقعها الجغرافي المميز لأنها صلة الوصل ما بين الشاطئ الشرقي للبحر الأبيض المتوسط والداخل السوري والعربي، مما جعلها مركزًا تجاريًا مهما على مستوى المنطقة ومنطقة الشمال.\nتضم المدينة عددًا كبيرًا من البنى التاريخية والأثرية، ومتكاملة بأحيائها، وأسواقها، ودورها، وأزقتها المتعرجة الملتوية، والمسقوفة، ومعالمها، وتضم المدينة أكثر من 160 معلمًا، بين قلعة، وجامع، ومدرسة، وخان، وحمام، وسوق، وسبيل مياه، وكتابات، ونقوش، ورُنوك، وغيرها من المعالم التاريخية والفنية.\nتربض مدينة طرابلس العاصمة الثانية للجمهورية اللبنانية فوق سهل، تغسل أطرافه الغربية مياه البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وتتفيأ بظلال سفوح جبال الأرز من جهة الشرق، ويشرف عليها من الشمال الشرقي جبل الفهود (تربل)، ويخترقها في الشرق نهر أبو علي المتدفق من الوادي المقدس قاديشا، وهو يفصل بين ربوتي (أبي سمراء)، و (قبة النصر).\nيعود تاريخ طرابلس إلى ثلاثة 3500 عام، حيث أسسها الكنعانيون، وتعاقبت عليها الأمم والعهود من الكنعانيين حتى الانتداب الفرنسي، مرورًا بالرومان، والبيزنطيين، والعرب، والفرنجة، والمماليك، والعثمانيين.\nتحاول المدينة في الوقت الحاضر تحريك عجلتها الاقتصادية وتطوير أوجه الحياة المدنية فيها. ويعتمد اقتصادها على الصناعات الحرفية، وبعض الصناعات التحويلية الصغيرة، والسياحة.\nتنقسم المدينة إلى قسمين القسم الأول هو الميناء والقسم الثاني هو المدينة نفسها إضافة إلى ضاحيتيها، البحصاص والبداوي، وشريطين ضيقين على امتداد شاطئ البحر، واحد باتجاه الشمال، والآخر باتجاه الجنوب، لتلامس مساحته 27 كيلومترا مربعا.\nيبلغ عدد سكان طرابلس (الكبرى) القاطنين فيها حوالي 850 ألف نسمة تقريبًا، وتعتبر الكثافة السكانية فيه الأعلى على الإطلاق حيث تصل إلى 7086 شخصا في الكيلومتر الواحد.\nوفي مايو 2024 اختارت المنظمة العربية للتربية والثقافة والعلوم، أليكسو، مدينة طرابلس لتكون عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2024.\n\nأصل التسمية\nطرابلس هي تعريب لكلمة Τρίπολις) Tripolis) اليونانية والتي تعني المدن الثلاث. ويعود الاسم حيث أسس على أرضها أول اتحاد من نوعه في عالم ذلك الزمان، لثلاث من مدن فينيقيا القديمة: صور وصيدا وأرواد، نشأت عنه مدينة فينيقية بثلاثة أحياء عمرانية وهي «محلاتا» و«مايزا» و«كايزا». شكلت تلك المدينة فيما بعد بأحيائها العمرانية الثلاثة النواة الأساسية التي قامت عليها طرابلس اليوم.\nكما عرفت المدينة بأسماء مختلفة عبر العصور، ففي رسائل تل العمارنة سميت «دربلي». وفي أثار أخرى سميت «أهلية» أو وهلية. وبمنحوتات انتصارات الغزو الاشوري للمدينة، سيمت «مهالاتا»، «مهلاتا»، «مايزا» و\"كايزا.\nبين القرنين السادس والرابع ق. م. ارتقى شأن طرابلس بين المدن الفينيقية حيث أصبحت عاصمة للاتحاد الفينيقي، وأصبح اسمها (آثر – Athar)، وهذا ما كشفت عنه قطع النقود المسكوكة فيها بتاريخ 189 -188 ق. م. والتي صكت في العصر اليوناني ولكنها تحمل كتابة فينيقية تدل على اسم طرابلس الفينيقي.\nدخلها اليونانيون في القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، وأطلقوا عليها اسم ” تريبوليس – Tripolis “أي المدينة المثلثة. وقد ظلت تحمل هذا الاسم طوال العصور التاريخية التي تتالت عليها من الرومان حتى العرب الذين دخلوا عليها في القرن السابع الميلادي فعربوا الاسم إلى أطرابلس بإضافة الهمزة في أولها تمييزا لها عن طرابلس الغرب، ومن ثم حذفت الهمزة وأصبحت طرابلس. ولقد سميت طرابلس ومنطقتها إمارة طرابلس ثم دولة طرابلس ثم مملكة طرابلس المشرقية.\nأما الصليبيون، فدعوها (تريبل) وجعلوها مركز مقاطعة طرابلس. لقبت «بالمدينة المقدسة» في النصف الأول من القرن الثاني الميلادي. كما دعيت أيام العرب بالفيحاء وما زالت هذه الصفة ملازمة لها حتى اليوم. وتسمى حاليا طرابلس الشام أو طرابلس الشرق، تمييزًا لها عن طرابلس العاصمة الليبية.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالمناخ\nمناخ طرابلس معتدل بفضل موقعها على البحر المتوسط، شتاؤها معتدل ماطر يمتد لحوالي 4 أشهر، وصيفها حار متوسط الرطوبة يمتد حوالي ال5 أشهر، أما الخريف والربيع فهما فصلان انتقاليان، وهما الأكثر جمالا وروعة حيث تستنشق المدينة رائحة أزهار الليمون المنتشرة في البساتين.\nمعدل حرارتها السنوي 19,5 درجة مئوية، أدنى المعدل الشتوي 12,8 مئوية، وأعلى المعدل الصيفي 25 مئوية.\nبين شواطئ طرابلس الدافئة، وجبالها العالية، أقل من ساعة واحدة تنقلنا من الصيف إلى الشتاء، ومن التزلج على الماء إلى التزلج على الثلج.\n\nالموقع\nتقع طرابلس على الساحل الشرقي للبحر الأبيض المتوسط، وتربط المدن الساحلية بمدن سوريا الداخلية، وبالتالي بمدن العراق والخليج عن طريق ممر «طرابلس - حمص» الطبيعي الذي لعب دورا مهما عبر العصور. أما بيروت واللاذقية فكلتاهما تفصلهما عن الداخل سلسلة جبلية تعيق حركة النقل وخاصة أثناء الشتاء، لذلك تعتبر طرابلس منفذا لسوريا الداخلية والعراق والخليج العربي على البحر المتوسط.\nهي مركز محافظة لبنان الشمالي، والعاصمة الثانية للبنان بعد بيروت التي تبعد عنها حوالي 85 كلم نحو الشمال، وتبعد عن الحدود اللبنانية-السورية الشمالية نحو 30 كلم، تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 15 كلم2، بما فيها الميناء. وتقع أمام ساحلها مجموعة جزر صغيرة أهمها: جزيرة الرامكين وجزيرة النخل وجزيرة سنني. وقد أعلنت جميعها عام 1993 محمية طبيعية بحرية تعرف باسم محمية جزر النخل. وأقيمت منارة لهداية السفن على الجزيرة الأولى.\nتشرف طرابلس على سلسلة جبلية ترتفع قممها إلى ما فوق 3000 م تكسوها غابة الأرز والثلوج الدائمة، وتنتشر على سفوح تلك السلسلة المصايف ذات المناظر الخلابة، والمياه العذبة والهواء العليل.\nيخترق طرابلس نهر يتدفق من مغارة قاديشا في أعالي جبل المكمل، يعرف محليا ً بنهر أبو علي نسبة إلى «أبو علي بن عمار» أحد ولاتها من أسرة بني عمار الذين حكموا طرابلس في نهاية القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي. يشطر نهر «أبو علي» طرابلس شطرين، شرقي وغربي، يصل بينهما الجسر الجديد الذي أقيم حديثا ً بعد طوفان النهر عام 1956، وهو يغذي تربتها ويروي بساتينها التي تغطي سهلها الخصيب.\n\nالمناطق\nضاحيتيها\nالبحصاص والبداوي، المهاترة الظاهرية (معروفة بالزاهرية). المئتين بالإضافة إلى شريطين ضيقين على امتداد شاطئ البحر، واحد باتجاه الشمال، والآخر باتجاه الجنوب. وتدخل فيه القلمون\n\nتاريخ\nالعهد الفينيقي\nتؤكد المصادر التاريخية والتنقيبات الأثرية أن طرابلس كانت إحدى مدن الفينيقيين، حيث أسسوا فيها أول اتحاد لدويلات صيدا، وصور، وأرواد، وبذلك يمكن اعتبار طرابلس أول اتحاد أممي في التاريخ .\n\nالعهد الإغريقي\nيتميز ساحل طرابلس بمجموعة من التشكيلات الجغرافية التي يمكن استعمالها كموانئ للسفن والمراكب، ويتميز أيضًا بوجود مجموعة من الجزر، هي الوحيدة في لبنان، وقد لعبت تلك الجزر دورًا هامًا في السيطرة على الطرق العسكرية والتجارية في المنطقة. ففي العصر الهيليني، وبالتحديد في ظل حكم خلفاء الاسكندر الأكبر، لعبت طرابلس دور قاعدة بحرية كبيرة وذات استقلالية نسبية.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nأما في العصر الروماني، بلغت المدينة أوج تطورها واحتوت على العديد من المعالم الهامة.\n\nالعهد البيزنطي\nودمرت طرابلس في العام 551 خلال العهد البيزنطي وذلك بفعل زلزال مدمر .\n\nالعهد الفاطمي\nعادت طرابلس للعب دور هام كقاعدة عسكرية ابتداءً من العام 635 في عهدالأمويين. وفي العصر الفاطمي، تميزت طرابلس بحكم ذاتي مستقل وأصبحت مركزًا للعلم لا مثيل له في المنطقة. وفي بداية القرن الثاني عشر، حوصرت طرابلس ثم سقطت بيد الإفرنج الصليبيين في العام 1109.\nتضررت معظم معالم المدينة بشكل كبير، وبخاصة مكتبتها المعروفة باسم «دار العلم» والتي كانت تضم في كنفاتها ثلاثة ملايين مخطوط وكانت تنافس في غناها مكتبة بغداد.\n\nالعهد الصليبي\nالعهد المملوكي\nوفي العهد الصليبي، أصبحت مدينة طرابلس عاصمة كونتية طرابلس. وفي العام 1289، فُتحت طرابلس على يد المنصور قلاوون سلطان مصر والشام الذي أعطى أوامره بهدم المدينة القديمة، والتي كانت تقع فيما يعرف حاضرًا باسم الميناء، وبنائها من جديد في السهل المنبسط تحت قلعة طرابلس. واتخذها سلاطين المماليك طوال قرنين وربع القرن من الزمان عاصمة لنيابة السلطنة، وأقيمت فيها عشرات المساجد والمدارس، والزوايا، والتكايا، والخوانق، والربط، والحمامات، والخانات، والقياسر، والطواحين، ومن أشهر معالمها: الجامع المنصوري الكبير، وجامع التوبة، وجامع العطار، والبرطاسي، والسيد عبد الواحد المكناسي، وطينال، والمدرسة القرطاوية، والشمسية، والنورية، والناصرية، والخانوتية، والسقرقية، والطواشية، والخيرية حُسْن، والعجمية، والحمصية، والقادرية، والحججية، والظاهرية، ومن خاناتها: خان الحريريين، والمصريين، والعسكر، والصاغة (الصابون)، والتماثيلي (بالميناء)، ومن حماماتها: حمام الحاجب، وعز الدين الموصلي، والنوري، والعطار، والدوادار، وغيره. وأقيمت لها عدة بوابات في مختلف الاتجاهات، وتشعبت حاراتها ودروبها وأزقّتها الملتوية والممتدّة تحت عقود الدّور والمنازل التي توفّر لها حماية ذاتيّة بحيث تحوّلت في معظمها إلى سراديب ودهاليز وساباطات سرية لا يعرف السير فيها إلا أهلها، بمعنى أن بناءها وخِططها كانت عسكرية دفاعية حسب مقتضيات ذلك العصر، وأقيم على امتداد ساحلها من رأس الميناء إلى رأس النهر ستة أبراج حربية للمرابطة فيها، هي: برج الأمير أيتمش، وبرج الأمير جُلُبّان، وطرباي (الشيخ عفّان)، والأمير الأحمدي (الفاخورة)، والأمير برسباي (المعروف بالسباع)، وبرج السلطان قايتباي (المعروف ببرج رأس النهر)، وللدفاع عن المدينة إذا دهمها العدو. كما جرى ترميم الحصن الذي أسسه «ابن مجيب الأزدي»، وأعاد بناءه «ريموند دي سان جيل»، وحوله نائب السلطنة «سيف الدين أسندمر الكرجي» إلى قلعة كبيرة.\n\nطرابلس العثمانية\nدخلت طرابلس تحت السيادة العثمانية حين انتصر الأتراك على المماليك في مرج دابق سنة 922 هـ/ 1516 م. وأبقوا على النظام المتبع فيها بتعيين الكُفّال والنواب لبضع سنوات، إلى أن أصبحت تؤجر للإقطاعيين الذين ينيبون عنهم من يتولى حكمها وذلك اعتبارًا من سنة 928 هـ/ 1522 م.\n\nأوجد العثمانيون عدة مناطق سكنية جديدة أحاطت بمدينة المماليك، فازدادت عمرانًا واتساعًا، وتضاعف عدد مساجدها ومدارسها وزواياها وتكاياها وحماماتها وخاناتها، حتى بلغ ما فيها 44 خانًا، وتجاورت المساجد والمدارس، بل تلاصقت، وكثر عددها بشكل يثير العجب، حتى أن المدرسة كانت تفصلها عن المدرسة القريبة منها مدرسة أخرى مجاورة، وبلغ عددها قبل ثلاثمائة سنة ونيف أكثر من ثلاثمائة وستين مسجدًا ومدرسة، على عدد أيام السنة. ومن المعالم العثمانية: تكية الدراويش المولوية، وحمام العظم (الجديد)، وجامع محمود بك السنجق، وجامع محمود لطفي الزعيم (المعلق)، والجامع الحميدي، وسبيل الباشا الوزير محمد باشا، وسبيل الزاهد، والتكية القادرية، وساعة التل. وأعادوا بناء القلعة والأبراج والحصون الساحلية والبوابات. واستعادت الميناء (طرابلس القديمة) دورها التجاري، فكثُرت فيها القنصليات الأوروبية، وأقيمت الوكالات والمخازن الضخام لاستيعاب المنتجات والبضائع الصادرة والواردة من القطن، والسكر، والصابون، والقماش، والفواكة، والثمار، والعطور، والجلود، والحبوب، وغيره.يعتبر عهد الأتراك في طرابلس أطول العهود الإسلامية التي خضعت لسيادتها، حيث امتد حكمهم نحو نيف وأربعة قرون، باستثناء ثماني سنوات خضعت فيها للحكم المصري حين دخلها إبراهيم باشا ابن محمد علي الكبير سنة 1832 م. واتخذها قاعدة عسكرية أثناء حملته على بلاد الشام وأقام فيها. وعادت إلى الأتراك العثمانيين بعد جلاء المصريين عنها سنة 1840 م. ثم خضعت للانتداب الفرنسي سنة 1918 م. فكانت «ساعة التل» آخر ما تركه العثمانيون من آثار في طرابلس.\n\nطرابلس المعاصرة\nبقيت رائدة المدن الساحلية حتى عام 1920، عندما أصبحت كغيرها من المدن الساحلية جزءًا من دولة لبنان الكبير.\nومع دولة الاستقلال 1943، أصبحت طرابلس العاصمة الثانية بعد مدينة بيروت، وأصبحت عاصمة محافظة لبنان الشمالي.\n\nالسكان\nيبلغ عدد سكان طرابلس الكبرى حوالي 850 ألف نسمة، وتواجد في طرابلس طوائف عديدة، من المسلمين؛ ويشكل المسلمون من أهل السنة والجماعة يشكّلون الغالبية في المدينة.\n\nالتنقيبات الأثرية\nلم تجرِ في طرابلس أيّة أعمال تنقيب أثرية منظمة، وذلك لأن معظم المناطق الأثرية القديمة تقع أسفل المنطقة المعروفة حاليًا باسم الميناء والمكسوة حاليًا بغطاء عمراني كثيف يشوّه الرؤية.\nومكّنت بعض أعمال التنقيب الصغيرة من الكشف عن بعض ثروات العهود القديمة منها الطريق إلى المرفأ البحري الجنوبي، وقصر نوفل، وبعض المدافن التي تعود إلى العهد الهيليني.\nوكشفت أعمال التنقيب داخل قلعة طرابلس عن العديد من الآثار التي تعود إلى العصر البرونزي، وعصر الحديد، وكذلك إلى العهود الرومانية، والبيزنطية، والفاطمية.\n\nمعالم\nفاق عدد آثار طرابلس في آخر إحصاء أجرته بلديتها منذ أكثر من عشر سنوات المئتي أثر. هذا العدد يجعلها موقعًا أثريًّا هامًا.\nتُعتبر طرابلس المدينة الأولى بثروتها التُراثية على الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط، وهي الثانية بآثارها المملوكية بعد القاهرة، وتمثل متحفًا حيًا يجمع بين الأوابد الرومانية والبيزنطية، والآثار الفاطمية والصليبية، والعمارة المملوكية العثمانية، وتعود أغلبية هذه الآثار إلى العهد المملوكي، يليه العهد العثماني فالعهد الصليبي والبيزنطي، ويقول المؤرخون أن مباني مدينة الميناء الحديثة قائمة على أنقاض المدينة البيزنطية.\n\nدور العبادة\nالمساجد\nتُعرف مدينة طرابلس بكثرة المساجد والتكايا والزوايا والمدارس الدينية التي يعود بناؤها لأيام المماليك والعثمانيين من بعدهم، حيث عماراتها المزخرفة وقناطرها المتناثرة. ويوجد في طرابلس العديد من الجوامع العريقة ومعظمها ذات طراز مملوكي ومنها:\n\nالجامع المنصوري الكبير: يعد من أعظم المساجد الجامعة في طرابلس أسسه السلطان الأشرف خليل بن قلاوون في العام 1294 م. وهو أكبر وأقدم جوامع المماليك في طرابلس ولبنان على الإطلاق.\nجامع العطار: من أكبر جوامع طرابلس وثالثها من حيث الأهمية بني في عصر المماليك. أسسه «بدر الدين بن العطار» أحد عطاري طرابلس الأثرياء سنة 1325 م على نفقته الخاصة فنسب إليه.\nجامع البرطاسي: يعرف بجامع ومدرسة البرطاسي أو البرطاسية، وسمي نسبة إلى مؤسسة «عيسى بن عمر البرطاسي» عام 1310 م. وهو من أجمل الجوامع المملوكية.\nجامع الأويسي: حمل اسم مشيّده «محي الدين الأويسي» الذي بناه عام 865 هـ. وفيه ضريح لمحمود بك السنجق، صاحب المسجد المعروف باسمه في التبّانة.\nجامع التوبة: بني في عصر المماليك على يد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون نحو عام 1315 م. وجُدد في عهد ((بني سيفا)) أمراء طرابلس في العصر العثماني عام 1612 م.\nجامع طينال: أجمل وأفخم جوامع طرابلس ولبنان، بناه الأمير سيف الدين طينال الأشرفي الحاجب عام 1336 م. وهو يضاهي أجمل جوامع القاهرة ودمشق.\nإضافة إلى ما ذكر من مساجد هناك عشرات أخرى تزخر بها طرابلس ومنها: جامع السيد عبد الواحد المكناسي المغربي الطراز، مسجد البهاء، جامع شرف الدين الذي أسسه حاكم طرابلس العثماني، جامع الحميدي نسبةً للسلطان العثماني عبد الحميد الثاني الذي جدده، مسجد الحُجَيْجيّة وهو من بقايا الأبنية الصليبية، جامع أرغون شاه بناه الأمير المملوكي أرغون الإبراهيمي، جامع الطحام المملوكي، جامع المعلق العثماني.\n\nالكنائس وحي النصارى\nحي النصارى في طرابلس يشكل مجمعًا أثريًا مسيحيًا حيث تتجمع عدة كنائس، أقدمها كنيسة مار نقولا للروم الأرثوذكس التي كانت في الأساس مصبغةً لأسرة طرابلسية مسلمة تنازلت عنها وحُولت إلى كنيسة عُرفت بكنيسة السبعة، وجرى تأسيسها عام 1809 م. وبقرب كنيسة مار نقولا أقيمت كنيسة مار جاورجيوس للروم الأرثوذكس بين عامي 1862 و1873 م. وكنيسة مار ميخائيل للموارنة، وقد بُنيت عام 1889 م. تقابلها كنيسة صغيرة للاتين مُلحَقة بمدرسة الطليان. وعلى مقربة من شارع الكنائس هناك كنيسة مار يوسف للسُريان الكاثوليك، وكانت في الأساس للفرنسيسكان، وبُنيت في القرن 19 م. إضافة إلى ما ذكر عثر بجوار الجامع الأويسي على آثار كنيسة من عهد الصليبيين. ويشكل المسيحيين حوالي 5% من سكان المدينة، وتصل عدد المسيحيين في طرابلس مع القبة ما يقارب 30,000 مواطن، وتشير المصادر إلى هجرة العائلات المسيحية الطرابلسية من المدينة إلى الضواحي أو بيروت. ويضم المجتمع المسيحي حوالي 35 كنيسة في طرابلس.\n\nالمدارس\nمن المدارس التي بنيت بمعظمها في عصر المماليك:\n\nمدرسة الشيخ الهندي المعروفة بالمشهد وتحتوي على زخارف ملونة في الخارج والداخل،\nمدرسة الشمسية وهي أقدم مدارس المماليك في لبنان وهي تقدم أقدم نموذج للبيوت المملوكية القديمة، المدرسة الناصرية التي بناها السلطان الناصر حسن بن محمد بن قلاوون،\nمدرسة الأمير شهاب الدين قرطاي التي تضاهي ببوابتها الشمالية أجمل وأفخم مساجد القاهرة ودمشق، المدرسة العجمية في أحدٌ أقدم وأحصن الأزقة في المدينة وأضيقها، المدرسة الظاهرية،\nالمدرسة النورية التي تحتوي على أجمل محراب وبها قبر بناه الأمير المملوكي طرمش الدوادار،\nالمدرسة السقرقية التي بناها الأمير سيف الدين.\nإضافة إلى ما ذكر هناك:\nمدرسة الرفاعي من العصر العثماني،\nمدرسة الأمير سنجر الحمصي،\nمدرسة القاضي أوغلو العثماني، المدرسة القادرية من عصر المماليك من القرن 14 م،\nالمدرسة الطواشية من عصر المملوكي، وهي من أجمل مدارس طرابلس ذات التأثيرات الأندلسية، وغيرها...\n\nمقامات ومزارات\nمقام والي طرابلس العثماني أحمد باشا الشالق المؤرخ عام 1665 م،\nمقام عبد السلام المشيشي من أهل المغرب.\nمزار السيدة للروم الأرثوذكس، من العصر الصليبي، يزوره المؤمنون إلى الآن، وتظهر الحروف اللاتينية منقوشة على عقده.\n\nالساحات\nالساحة المركزية في طرابلس هي «التل» التي فيها الساعة العثمانية ذات الطبقات الخمس، المُهداة من السلطان عبد الحميد الثاني وبجوارها حديقة المنشية وترى من حول ساحة التل المباني السكنية والتجارية والفنادق ذات الطراز العثماني.\nساحة الكورة التي تتجاور بها العمارة العثمانية والحديثة، وفي جوارها.\nساحة السلطان الأشرف خليل بن قلاوون النجمة سابقًا حيث بداية حدود المدينة القديمة.\nساحة الحمصي التي تُعرف حاليًا بالتربيعة.\n\nالأسواق\nسوق النحاسين الذي أنشئ في العهد المملوكي وهو خاص طبعًا كما يدل اسمه بالنحاسيات.\nسوق الصياغين الذي يعد من أجمل وأقدم أسواق طرابلس، وهو خاص بمحلات صياغة وبيع الذهب والمجوهرات المصنعة، أو المستوردة من الخارج.\nسوق البازركان الذي يعد قلب الأسواق النابضة بالحياة، المتخصص بالأقمشة بأنواعها وألوانها.\nسوق حراج وهو من عصر المماليك وربما أقدم من ذلك، ويحتوي على الأعمدة الغرانيتية المرتفعة التي تتوسط ساحته، والأعمدة الضخمة القائمة داخل الحوانيت حول الباحة.\nسوق الكندرجية وهو أحد الأسواق المزدحمة بالمارة، وفيه محلات بيع الملابس وأحدث الأزياء. وأخيرًا سوق العطارين المتخصص بالعطارة.\n\nالأحياء والأزقة\nأما الأزقة التاريخية فعديدة ومنها: زقاق النمل، الحمام، الأسرار، المهاترة، البرطاسية، سيدي عبد الواحد الذي يمتاز بأن نصفه مسقوف بالمساكن، وهو الطابع السائد في تخطيط المدينة القديمة، وزقاق رباط الخيل وفوقه كتابة منقوشة، ونوافذ حربية لرمي السهام.\n\nالخانات\nتعتبر خانات طرابلس مقصد السواح وخصوصا عالموا الآثار. وتقع في وسط المدينة، وهي من خلال عددها ومساحتها تبيّن أهميّة التجارة وخصوصًا الأهميّة الأقتصادية لهذه المدينة مما يفسّر وجود هذا العدد الكبير من الخانات العائد معظمها إلى العهد المملوكي.\nللخانات وظائف عديدة فهي وبالإضافة إلى كونها موقع لبيع وشراء البضائع، تستعمل أيضا\" لتخزين البضاعة وكمكان سكن التجار لأنه يستلزمهم أكثر من يوم لبيع منتوجاتهم.\n\nخان الصابون المعروف أيضًا بخان العضيمي كان في البداية يستعمل كثكنة عسكرية للجيش العثماني وتحول وبطلب من السكان المحليين في طرابلس إلى مصنع الصابون. وما يميّزه أنه الوحيد الذي لا يزال يحتفظ ببابه الأصلي المصنوع من الخشب.\nخان العسكر الذي بني في عصر المماليك أواخر القرن 13 بهدف استعماله كثكنة للجيش مما يفسّر اسمه. وهو من أكبر الخانات في طرابلس ويتميّز ببنائه الذي يتألف من مبنيين.\nخان الخياطين المعروف أيضًا بخان الحريريين يعود للعصر المملوكي. وكما يدل اسمه، فهو مخصص للخياطين، ويقال أنه بني على بقايا مبنى صليبي مما يزيد من أهميته تاريخيًا. ويتميّز بتصميم مختلف فهو كناية عن شارع مقفل.\nخان المصريين الذي أقيم على ما يبدو في النصف الأول من القرن 14 للميلاد ويتألف من فناء تتوسطه بركة ماء وتحيط به طبقتان، خصصت السفلى منهما للبهائم والبضائع فيما خصصت العليا للنزلاء. وتطل هذه الغرف على الفناء من خلال أروقة معومدة.\nومن خاناتها أيضًا: الصاغة، التماثيلي (بالميناء)، الخشب، والجاويش.\n\nالحمامات\nأثر في طرابلس الوجود التركي ومن آثاره وجود الحمامات العامة، والتي قامت في الاصل لحاجة النظافة والطهارة طبقا للشريعة الإسلامية، بسبب قلة المياه الواصلة إلى البيوت.\nومن حمامات المدينة:\n\nحمام النزهة الذي أتى عليه طوفان نهر أبو علي، حمام الطوافية الذي لم يبق منه شيء، حمام القاضي الذي بُني عام 1340 وأزيل لاحقًا، حمام العطار الذي لم يبق منه سوى واجهته الغربية،\nحمام الداودار الذي يعتبر أجمل حمامات طرابلس، حمام الحاجب الذي لا تزال آثاره ظاهرة على الضفة الشرقية لنهر أبو علي، حمام القلعة،\nحمام الجديد أو القراقيش وهو من الطراز العثماني يقع في محلّة الحدادين، بناه إبراهيم باشا العظم، حمام النوري المملوكي بناه الأمير سنجر بن عبد الله النوري سنة 1310 م وفَقَد وظيفته بسبب وضعه السيّئ،\nحمام العظم أو الحمام الكبير الذي يقع تحت عقد الجامع الكبير في مدينة الميناء،\nحمام عزالدين الذي يقع في محلة باب الحديد، بناه الأمير عزالدين أيبك الموصلّي يعتبر من أشهر الحمامات في طرابلس، استمر في العمل حتى منتصف الثمانينات، وأصبح مهجورا وبحالة سيّئة. رمم سنة 2007 تحت اشراف المديرية العامة للآثار في لبنان، هو مفتوح حالياً للزيارة.\nحمام العبد (قرب خان الصابون) الذي بني في أواخر القرن السابع عشر، وهو البناء الوحيد من نوعه الذي ما زال يعمل حتى اليوم ولا يزال صامدا في وجه كل الظروف حيث يستعيد فيه أبناء طرابلس ذكريات مجد غابر كان فيه الحمام التركي أو الشرقي وسيلة التسلية الوحيدة في مجتمع متزمّت يرفض التجديد والتغيير.\n\nالقصور\nأبرز قصور طرابلس هو قصر نوفل العثماني المعروف بمركز «رشيد كرامي الثقافي البلدي» بعد أن حولته بلدية المدينة إلى مكتبة عامة وقاعة محاضرات ومعارض.\nوهناك أيضًا قصرُ الأمير المملوكي سَنْجَر الحمصي الذي سكنه عام 1324 م، وقصر الأمير المملوكي سيف الدين أَلْطُنْطاش من القرن 13 م.\nوقصر الأمير عز الدين أيبك الموصلي وهو من عصر المماليك، به زخارف أندلسية شبيهة بقصر الحمراء في غَرْناطة، وبعد القصر ضريح الأمير، وفوق نافذته اللوحة التاريخية العائدة إلى العام 1299 م.\nوهكذا\n\nالبرك\nعشرات البِرَك وسُبُل المياه منتشرة في أسواق المدينة القديمة، وتتميز بها عن غيرها من المدن ومنها بركة الملاحة التي كانت تُملأ في الأعياد بأنواع الشراب، من عصير البرتقال، أو التمر هندي، أو الليمون، أو السوس، ويشرب منها الناس مجانًا لمدة ثلاثة أيام، وأحيانًا لمدة أسبوع كامل.\nوسبيل ماء مملوكي يعرف بـسبيل التينة، بناه الأمير محمد بن مباركشاه العلائي في العام 1414 م. وفي داخله لوحة تاريخية.\n\nالأبراج والقلاع\nتشعّبت حارات طرابلس ودروبها وأزقّتها الملتوية تحت عقود الدّور والمنازل التي توفّر لها حماية ذاتيّة بحيث تحوّلت في معظمها إلى سراديب ودهاليز وساباطات سريّة لا يعرف السيّر فيها إلاّ أهلها، بمعنى أن بناءها\nوخِططها كانت عسكرية دفاعية، وأقيم على امتداد ساحلها ستة أبراج حربية للمرابطة فيها والدفاع إذا دهمها العدو وهي:\n\nبرج الأمير أيتمش،\nبرج الأمير جُلُبّان،\nطرباي (الشيخ عفّان)،\nالأمير الأحمدي (الفاخورة)،\nالأمير برسباي (المعروف بالسباع)،\nوبرج السلطان قايتباي (المعروف ببرج رأس النهر)، ّ.\nأما قلعة طرابلس فهي أكبر القلاع الحربية في لبنان وأقدمها، أسسها القائد العربي سفيان بن مجيب الأزدي في العام 636 م. وبنى فيها الفاطميون مسجدًا أوائل القرن 11 م\nوبنى القائد التولوزي ريموند دي سان جيل حصنًا فوقها عام 1103 م. ثم حوله الأمير المملوكي أسَتُدَمُر الكُرْجي عام 1307 م إلى قلعة وبنى بها أبراجاَ، ثم أضاف السلطان العثماني سليمان بن سليم الأول عام 1521 م البرج الشمالي وفيه باب القلعة.\n\nتقع القلعة فوق تلةٍ صخرية وتتألف من 4 طبقات، بها حمام قديم و3 مساجد، وسجن، وإسطبل للخيول، وقاعات للقادة وكبار المسؤولين، وقاعات ضخمة للجند والذخيرة والمدفعية وآبار وخزانات للمياه، وأحواض للشرب، ومقابر، وباحات واسعة للتدريبات العسكرية والاستعراض، وأكثر من 100 حجرة مختلفة الاتساع، ونحو 10 أبواب في أسفل أسوارها، بعضها يؤدي إلى النهر، وبعضها يؤدي إلى الأسواق الداخلية إضافة إلى نوافذ للمدفعية.\n\nالمواصلات\nمرفأ طرابلس\nمرفأ طرابلس يعتبر البوابة الأساسية لدخول البضائع إلى منطقة الشرق الأوسط وعرف تاريخيًا بهذه الأهمية لقربه من الداخل السوري من دون عقبات جغرافية.\nإلى ذلك يعد هذا المرفأ أحد أهم بوابات تنشيط الحركة الاقتصادية في مدينة طرابلس وعموم الشمال وهو يشهد حاليا ورشة عمل متواصلة لتطويره، منها: إنشاء رصيف جديد مع منطقة خلفية تم اعتمادها كمنطقة اقتصادية حــرة، وتعميق حوض وتنفيذ أعمال الصيانة للعنابر ومنشآت المرفأ.\nونظرًا إلى تطور بعض أنواع التجارة في المنطقة والتي تمتد على فترات طويلة ماضية فإن استيراد الأخشاب والأسمدة إلى لبنان أصبح من اختصاص مرفأ طرابلس بشكلٍ عام.\nيشار إلى أن عدد الأرصفة الحالي في المرفأ هو 7 وتقع بجانب أحواض مائية.\n\nالحرف\nالحلويات\nكما تشتهر مدينة طرابلس بغنى آثارها وكثرة مساجدها والتكايا والزوايا فيها هي أيضًا تشتهر بصناعة الحلويات التي ذاع صيتها في كل أرجاء الوطن وتعدى الحدود والجغرافيا حتى أضحت الحلويات ملازمة لعراقة طرابلس وأصالتها الموصولة عبر تاريخها القديم العابق بالتراث.\nومن أبرز الأنواع التي تعرف بها المدينة: الفيصلية، تاج الملك، الكلاج، حلاوة الجبن، ميرامار، بقلاوة، برمة، عش البلبل، كول وشكور، بسمة، وبصمة، حلاوة الشميسة، بلورية، إضافة إلى أنواع الكنافة والفروكة.\nاقترن اسم طرابلس بالحلويات عبر تاريخها وما زالت محافظة عليه أمانة لا ترد تتوارثه جيلًا من جيل وتماشيًا مع سياسة الانفتاح الدائم على التطور والآفاق الجديدة.\nصناعة الحلويات الطرابلسية التي ازدهرت منذ نحو القرنين من الزمن افــرزت أسماء عائلات عديدة استثمرت في هذا المجال، أبرزها عائلة الحلاب التي ارتبط اسمها بالحلويات الشرقية. وتحولت هــذه الحرفة على ايدي أفراد العائلة إلى صناعة متكاملة وماركة تجارية امتدت شهرتها خــارج المدينة والوطن وعبر القارات.\nو امتازت أيضا في نفس المجال حلويات التوم من خلال عائلة التوم التي اشتهرت تاريخيا بالتجارة وصناعة الحلويات العربية بنكهة طرابلسية أصيلة ويحتفظ أبناء العائلة من جيل إلى جيل بأسرار المهنة والصنعة ويشرفون على الإنتاج وتتجلى أسرارهم في حلاوة الجبن خاصة التي صارت ارثا «ثقافيا» بالعائلة وبالمدينة، وقد تأسست في طرابلس القديمة سنة 1919 م على يدي مؤسس وعميد المهنة والصنعة عبد السلام التوم، وفرعها الرئيسي الأثري يقع جانب مسجد التوبة الأثري مقابل خان العسكر التاريخي والأثري.\n\nالتعليم\nفي مجال التربية والتعليم تضم طرابلس وضواحيها عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس من مختلف المستويات، حكومية وخاصة. كذلك توجد في طرابلس وضواحيها عدة جامعات. وفي ما يلي الجامعات الموجودة داخل طرابلس وفي ضواحيها:\n\nالجامعة اللبنانية - فرع شمال لبنان\nجامعة القديس يوسف (اليسوعية) - فرع شمال لبنان\nجامعة المدينة (المنار سابقا)\nجامعة بيروت العربية في طرابلس\nجامعة الجنان\nجامعة البلمند (في قلحات بقضاءالكورة، قرب حدود المدينة)\nجامعة سيدة اللويزة - فرع شمال لبنان (في برسا بقضاءالكورة قرب حدود المدينة)\nجامعة طرابلس\nجامعة الآداب والعلوم والتكنولوجيا - فرع شمال لبنان (في القلمون، عند حدود المدينة)\n\nالمهرجانات\nبعد توقف ثلاث سنوات فرضته الأحداث الأمنية المتلاحقة، عادت مهرجانات طرابلس، للانطلاق هذا العام، عبر سلسلة من الحفلات المتنقلة ما بين معرض رشيد كرامي الدولي ومهرجانات الشارع والحدائق، بهدف تعزيز الحركة السياحية في طرابلس، ووضع المدينة على الخارطة السياحية اللبنانية جديًا.\nوعودة المهرجانات هذه ترافقة مع تقدم نوعي في العمل حيث باتت تدار وتنظم بــمـشاركة محلية واسعة سمحت بالاستغناء عــن استقدام إداريــيــن ومنظمين من خارج المدينة.\nوتضمن برنامج المهرجانات حفلات متنوعة منها: الفنانة نجوى كرم والفنان وليد توفيق وفرقة الباليه البيلاروسية وفرقة «قونيا» التركية الصوفية (للدراويش- الطريقة المولوية) وكورال الفيحاء وكورال الأطفال.\nإضافة إلى نشاطات مجانية مواكبة للمهرجان: فرقة Rap Music «سبع طقات» وفرقة نهوند للموسيقى في «تحية إلى عبد الوهاب» ومسرحية للأطفال، كريم دكروب، وتوزيع جوائز للمبدعين الشباب، وحوار الحضارات بالموسيقى (بيانو وعود)، ومشروع «من الحبة قبة» أمسية للحكواتي.\n\nمعرض رشيد كرامي الدولي والستاد الأولمبي\nعند الوصول إلى طرابلس تبدو جليًا منشأتان مهمتان تدلان على دخول طرابلس في ركاب التطور، فالتحديث الأول هو معرض رشيد كرامي الدولي وهو المعرض الرسمي الوحيد في لبنان، والثاني الستاد الأولمبي الذي استضاف بطولة الأمم الآسيوية في كرة القدم في العام 2000، إضافة إلى أنه يستخدم في الآونة الأخيرة لمباريات الركبي.\nإضافة إلى ما ذكر هناك منتجعات طرابلس البحرية المنتشرة على طول شاطئها الجنوبي.\n\nمدن توأمة\nنابولي، إيطاليا\n دمشق،

          "content": "The Citadel of Tripoli (Arabic: قَلْعَة طَرَابُلُس ALA-LC: Qalʻat Ṭarābulus) is a 12th-century fortress in Tripoli, Lebanon. It was built at the top of a hill \"during the initial Frankish siege of the city between 1102 and 1109\" on the orders of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, who baptized it the Castle of Mount Pilgrim (French: château du Mont-Pèlerin; Latin: castellum Montis Peregrini) while local Muslims have been referring to it as the Castle of Saint-Gilles (Arabic: قَلْعَة سَان جِيل Qalʻat Sān Jīl). \nHowever, very little of the original structure has survived, the castle having been rebuilt several times, and for the last time in the early 19th century, when the citadel was extensively restored and rebuilt by the Ottoman governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar. The citadel nowadays houses the North Lebanon & Akkar Museum.\n\nHistory\nThe first cornerstone was set in the 9th century during the conquest of Tripoli by Sufyan al-azadi, it was a fort 2 miles away from the old city on a strategic hill. The fort was gradually fortified and rebuilt with time by many succeeding rulers. In the citadel there are many clues of past nations including the remains of a Fatimid mosque.\nThe citadel was built on the orders of Raymond of Saint-Gilles during the siege of Tripoli. The hill where the citadel stands had previously been the site of an 11th-century Shi'i cemetery, which the crusaders destroyed. When the Mont Pèlerin quarter was set ablaze by the Mamluks after the reconquest, the castle of Saint-Gilles suffered and stood abandoned on the hilltop for the next eighteen years. It was essential to have an adequate stronghold in Tripoli for the sultan's troops, temporarily garrisoned in Hisn al-Akrad (Krak des Chevaliers), as the distance was too great in case of enemy attack.\nAbu'l-Fida and Ibn al-Wardi record that, among the important events which took place in 1345, was the promulgation of a military decree which was set up by order of the Mamluk Sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban in the citadels of Aleppo, Tripoli, Hisn al-Akrâd and other fortified places. The decree, put over the second entrance way of the citadel of Tripoli, is by far the best preserved. Apparently this sultan, who lived a life of luxury and debauchery, was in constant need of extra revenue. In order to fill his depleted treasury, he imposed a heavy registration tax upon all feudal land concessions and appropriations. This tax was unpopular and was obviously going to stir up discontent among his subjects. To forestall any uprising and gain the support of his troops, upon whom his power was based he issued this military decree. It was the custom that a Mamluk soldier, under contract for a specified number of years, received an annual gratuity which amounted to slightly over eleven days extra pay. If the soldier died before the end of his contract, the sultan had the right to claim the extra sum of money which had accumulated during the soldier's years of service. Sha'bán abandoned his rights to this claim, once and for all, hoping thus to enlist the support of his troops.\nIn 1516, Syria and Egypt fell to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. His son and successor Suleiman I, called the Magnificent (1520-1566), soon after his accession made an inspection tour of his newly-conquered lands. He gathered about him in Damascus all his provincial governors and on this occasion took the decision to rebuild the citadel of Tripoli.\nIn the years that followed, various Ottoman governors of Tripoli did restoration work on the citadel to suit their needs and with time the medieval crenelated battlements were destroyed in order to open sally ports for cannons. \nVery little of the original Crusader structure has survived until this day. The graves of a number of nameless Frankish knights, here and there, are the only bits of evidence today evocative of their presence on the heights of Tripoli's \"Pilgrim's Mountain\" many centuries ago.\n\nNorth Lebanon & Akkar Museum\nThe citadel houses the North Lebanon & Akkar Museum. The small museum has a numismatic collection covering most periods from the Hellenic to the Ayyubid one.\n\nTripoli landmark map\nSee also\nArchitecture of Lebanon\nList of Crusader castles\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"The Tripoli Citadel\" on tripoli-lebanon.org",

It is one of the most prominent historical sites in the port city of Sidon, Lebanon.\n\nHistory\nThe city of Sidon is located on the Mediterranean coast of Lebanon. This ancient Phoenician city has been of great religious, political and commercial value; it is said to be inhabited since 4000 B.C. In AD 1228, the Crusaders built Sidon's Sea Castle as a fortress on a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow 80m long roadway. The island was formerly the site of a temple to Melqart, the Phoenician version of Heracles. The beauty of the Castle can be seen in old illustrations of it; however, after bearing several wars, it has been damaged and renovated several times. It was partially destroyed by the Mamluks when they took over the city from the Crusaders, but they subsequently rebuilt it and added the long causeway. The castle later fell into disuse, but was again restored in the 17th century by Emir Fakhreddine II, only to suffer great damage.\nThere is a possibility that the island on which the castle is built was, in fact, the location of the Phoenician King's palace and several other Phoenician monuments which were destroyed by Esarhaddon and then by natural earthquakes. This island has also served as a shelter from inside attacks on the city. Great Sidon, Little Sidon, powerful fortresses, pastures, cisterns and fortifications are all mentioned in the Assyrian king Sennacherib's recordings of his attacks on Sidon and nearby cities.\n\nDescription\nToday, the castle consists primarily of two towers connected by a wall. In the outer walls, Roman columns were used as horizontal reinforcements, a feature often seen in fortifications built on or near former Roman sites. The rectangular west tower to the left of the entrance is the better preserved of the two. There is a large vaulted room scattered with old carved capitals and rusting cannonballs. A winding staircase leads up to the roof, where there is a small, domed Ottoman-era mosque. From the roof, there is a view across the old city and fishing harbor. The east tower is not as well preserved and was built in two phases; the lower part dates to the Crusader period, while the upper level was built by the Mamluks. There has also been evidence of the old Phoenician city being buried under the sea in the area surrounding the castle: structures of walls, columns, stairways, remains of buildings, statues and cisterns.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of Crusader castles\nList of Lebanese monuments\nLordship of Sidon\n\nReferences\nSidon (Pamphlet), Ministry of Tourism of Lebanon, Arab Printing Press, 2009\nSea Castle.

After 1840, the palace was used by the Ottomans as a government building. During the French Mandate it served as a local administrative office.\nIn 1943, the palace was declared the president's official summer residence. During the Lebanese Civil War it was heavily damaged. Parts of the palace are today open to the public while the rest is still the president's summer residence.\nA gathering of troops here for an incursion into Syria under Ibrahim Pasha is recorded in the notes to Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration  The Gathering of the Chieftains at Beteddein. to an engraving of a painting (showing the palace) by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.\nUNESCO gave the palace enhanced protection during the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon to safeguard against damage; it was one of 34 cultural sites to receive enhanced protection.\n\nDescription\nThe Beiteddine Palace is recognized as a fine illustration of Lebanese architecture from the early 19th century, with notable Italian influences.\nThe palace's main entrance leads to a 107x45 meter courtyard. Along the right side of this court is a two-story wing, Al-Madafa, which was once used for receiving guests.\nThe entrance to the central section of the palace, Dar El Wousta, is from a double stairway at the far western end of the courtyard. From this point on, the impressive but austere appearance of the outside court and buildings gives way to the delightful architecture featuring beautiful arcades, mandaloun balconies, fountains, facades, rooms with carved and painted cedar wood embellished with Arabic calligraphy, antique furniture, inlaid marble and fine mosaics. These rooms served as offices and receptions salons.\nAt the far end of this courtyard rise the private apartments, Dar el Harim, composed of a large and richly decorated façade, the Upper Harem, the selamlik, the Lower Harem and the kitchens.\nAt the northern edge of the Dar El Harim section is the hammam.\nBeyond the hammam is the tree-shaded tomb of Emir Bashir Shehab II and his first wife.\n\nGallery\n\n\n== References ==",

Moussa's castle was built on a hill between Deir El Kamar and Beiteddine - Lebanon, with the beliefs and ideas of its builder engraved on its stones. The castle was built by Moussa Abdel Karim Al Maamari who was born on July 27, 1931, in the village of Harat Al Saraya - Lebanon and died January 31, 2018, in the village Deir El Qamar. His idea of building a castle began when he was only 14 years old, inspired by the Middle Ages.\nRidiculed by his teacher \"Anwar\" and mocked by his classmates, he left school and travelled to Saida on foot where he worked with his uncle on restoring Saida's fortress. He was later assigned by the Emir Maurice Chehab to renovate the castles and to excavate for archaeological discoveries to be exhibited in the National Museum of Beirut in 1947. He continued working in the same field gaining enough experience from his work in restoring castles. He was then transferred to Beiteddine palace, where he restored the museum of Emir Bashir Chehabi II; he supervised the work as well as the placing of the Emir's weapons collection, clothes and jewelry, and the sword offered to him by Napoleon in the museum that was inaugurated under the rule of late president Beshara Khalil Al Khoury in September 1951. It was then that he began work on his own construction and bought a suitable piece of land. The foundation stone was laid in 1962, and completed with the help of his wife.\n\nSee also\nMoussa Al-Maamari\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMoussa Castle official website",

          "content": "The Jeita Grotto (Arabic: مغارة جعيتا) is a system of two separate, but interconnected, karstic limestone caves spanning an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). The caves are situated in the Nahr al-Kalb river valley within the locality of Jeita, 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Though inhabited in prehistoric times, the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an underground river that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese. On October 31, 2025, the caves were illegally used as a wedding venue by a Lebanese-Italian couple, prompting national outrage and the prime minister to order the opening of an investigation.\nIn 1958, Lebanese speleologists George Farra and Sami Karkabi discovered the upper galleries 60 metres (200 ft) above the lower cave which have been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists safe access without disturbing the natural landscape. The upper galleries house the world's largest known stalactite.  The galleries are composed of a series of chambers the largest of which peaks at a height of 12 metres (39 ft).\n\nLocation\nThe Jeita cave is situated at the center of the western flanks of the Lebanon mountains, more specifically in the Nahr al-Kalb valley, its natural entrance is about 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. It's located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of the Mediterranean coastline and 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of Beirut within the confines of the municipality of Jeita, in the caza of Keserwan.\n\nHistory\nAncient vestiges of a foundry were found in a smaller cave near the Nahr al-Kalb river, suggesting that the cave was used in antiquity to produce swords.\nThe modern discovery of the underground river of Jeita in 1836 is credited to Reverend William Thomson (an American missionary) who ventured some 50 metres (160 ft) into the cave. Reaching the underground river, he fired a shot from his gun and the resulting echoes convinced him that he had found a cavern of major importance.\nIn 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G. Huxley, engineers with the Beirut Water Company, and their friend Reverend Daniel Bliss, president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the American University of Beirut) explored these caverns. In two expeditions carried out in 1873 and 1874, they penetrated 1,060 metres (3,480 ft) into the grotto before finding their progress blocked by an underground waterfall. The waterfall became known as \"Hell's Rapids\", as the torrents break onto razor sharp rocks. Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell, and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on \"Maxwell's Column\", a great limestone pillar some 625 metres (2,051 ft) from the entrance. About 200 metres (660 ft) further on, in the so-called \"Pantheon\", they wrote their names and details of the expedition on paper, sealed it in a bottle and placed it on top of a stalagmite. The lime-impregnated water has since covered the bottle with a thin white film, permanently fixing it to the stone.\nBetween 1892 and 1940 further expeditions were carried out by English, American, and French explorers. Their expeditions brought them to a depth of 1,750 metres (5,740 ft).\nSince the 1940s, Lebanese explorers have pushed even deeper into the Jeita grotto. Many of these spelunkers are members of the Speleo Club du Liban (Lebanese Caving Club) founded in 1951 by the first Lebanese speleologists Lionel Ghorra, Albert Anavi, Raymond Khawam and Sami Karkabi. Their expeditions revealed a great underground system which is now explored to an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi).\nIn 1958 the lower caverns were opened to the public, meanwhile exploration was still underway mainly by the Lebanese Caving Club.  This exploration led to the discovery of the elevated dry branch of the grotto later referred to as the upper galleries.\nIn 1962, the Spéléo Club contributed to a study of the upper galleries aiming to provide an access tunnel which was to be dug for touristic development purposes. Work on the access tunnel was begun in 1968.  Its opening was followed by the installation of a  series of walkways which permitted tourists safe access to the upper galleries without disturbing the natural landscape.\n\nIn 1969, a concert with electronic music by the French composer Francois Bayle was held in the cave to celebrate the inauguration of the upper galleries. This event was organized by the Lebanese artist and sculptor Ghassan Klink. Other cultural events have taken place in this unusual surrounding, including a concert by the world acknowledged German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in November 1969, and more recently, in 2008 a classical music concert by Lebanese-Armenian composer and pianist Guy Manoukian.\nThe caverns closed to the public due to the Lebanese civil war in 1978; both tunnels leading to the lower and upper galleries were used to store munitions, and the outside buildings for military purposes. The caves reopened in 1995 and remain one of the country's key natural attractions. The caverns were closed on early November 2025 due to an unauthorized wedding that took place there, but were reopened on November 15, as experts claim no harm was caused to the caves.\n\nArchaeology\nJeita I (sometimes referred to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep to the east of the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut, and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones, and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.\nJeita II (Dahr el-Mghara) is a rock shelter situated on a platform, above and equidistant between the dry cave of Jeita I and the entrance to the grotto at Jeita III. Excavations were made by the Duc de Luynes and Lartet in 1864, by Zumoffen in 1900 and 1908 and by Bergy in 1930. A large number of flint tools, bones, and hearths were found that were accredited to the Aurignacian. Further excavations were made in 1964 by Francis Hours which revealed much more extensive, deeper and richer deposits than had previously been suspected. Father Hours permitted Lorraine Copeland to disclose that the upper material appeared to display late Upper Paleolithic or early Mesolithic characteristics, probably including Kebaran. Excavation was to be continued but the area was fenced off and owned by the government.\nJeita III (The Caverns) was a deposit of brown soil that fell from a location suggested to be at the east end of Jeita II, just inside the entrance to the grotto where the tourists are conducted by boat. It was found in 1963 by the Speleologists Club and excavated by Father Hours. Flint tools found in the deposit were geometric in design and suggested to be a form of Natufian or later Mesolithic than discovered at Jeita II, from where it may have been displaced. Forms of these flints included rectangles with straight or oblique truncation, borers of the \"crochet\" type, micro-burins, end scrapers, bladelet cores, two transverse arrowheads, crescents, and short triangles. Some of the crescents had ridged backs and resembled those found at Nahal Oren. Material is stored with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory.\nJeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock shelter in the cliff upstream from the grotto. It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.\n\nGeology\nThe Jeita grotto is located within the Lower-Middle Jurassic strata of Keserouane which has a stratigraphic thickness of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and consists of dolomite and micritic limestone. The Keserouane formation was exposed to air by a local uplift during  the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. The Keserouane strata became karstified after its aerial exposure and then was buried during the Cretaceous. In the Neogene, upon the final uplift of Mount Lebanon, this early karstification phase was reactivated.\nAt the Nahr al-Kalb valley, the impervious Upper Jurassic volcanic rocks and Lower Cretaceous sand slant almost vertically forming a hydrogeological barrier and forcing the outlet of the Jeita underground river to the surface. This barrier could be the reason for the westernmost, large cave chambers with heights exceeding 60 metres (200 ft). Karstification of the Keserouane limestone was further intensified by the steep topography of the area and the volume of precipitation over the Lebanon (more than 1200mm).\nA ratio of total slope gradient of 1/100 is calculated between the entrance of the cave and its inland extremity. This shows its smooth flat course even though it is sometimes interrupted by several small cascades and rapids. From the west, the Jeita cave starts with large halls and meanders. Through some rapids, the dimension becomes narrower. Going forth, it is spacious with the Thompson's cavern (250 metres (820 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide), Grand Chaos (500 metres (1,600 ft) long) and Mroueh's Hall (200 metres (660 ft) long and 50 metres (160 ft) wide). The latter two are floored with collapsed blocks. The cave ends with a Y-shaped pattern, where, each branch ends with a siphon.\n\nDescription\nThe Jeita caves are solutional karst caves which have formed over millions of years due to the dissolution of limestone. The limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid charged rain water and groundwater; when the limestone, which is originally waterproof, contains cracks produced by tectonic forces the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers. Jeita is the longest cave complex in the Middle East; it sits at 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level and has a height difference of 305 metres (1,001 ft).  Geologically, the caves provide a tunnel or escape route for the underground river, which is the principal source of Nahr al-Kalb.\nThe Jeita grotto is the longest explored cave in Lebanon. After many years of exploration, speleologists have penetrated about 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) from the entry point of the lower grotto to the far end of the underground river and about 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of the upper galleries.\n\nUpper cave\nThe Jeita upper cave has an overall length of 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of which only 750 metres (2,460 ft) are accessible to visitors via a specially conceived walkway; access to the remainder of the cave was restricted to prevent ecological damage which may occur due to the flocking tourists. The upper cave contains a great concentration of a variety of crystallized formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, mushrooms, ponds, curtains, and draperies. The upper gallery is famous for its formations, lit by an effective lighting system. It is entered through a 117 metres (384 ft) long concrete tunnel. The part accessible by visitors has three huge chambers. The first is called the White Chamber, the second Red Chamber.\nWhite dripstones are pure calcite without defilement, the red color is given by iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon, iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in northern countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces a different kind of iron oxide.\nThe White Chamber is medium-sized, but has the most impressive formations of the cave. The Red Chamber is up to 106 metres (348 ft) high, and 30 metres (98 ft) to 50 metres (160 ft) wide. The third chamber is the biggest of all three chambers and has a height of more than 120 metres (390 ft). The longest stalactite in the world is located in Jeita's White Chamber; it measures 8.2 metres (27 ft) long.\n\nLower cave\nThe lower gallery which has an overall length of 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) is located 60 metres (200 ft) below the upper gallery. It is traversed by a smooth underwater river and a lake (the \"Dark Lake\"). The river is broken up by several small cataracts and rapids. The lower cave's \"Thompson's Cavern\", is a massive hall with impressive speleothems such as the Eagle Obelisk stalagmite. Other halls in the lower gallery include the Pantheon, Grand Chaos and Shangri-la. Visitors are transported in the lower gallery by electric boats for a distance of 500 metres (1,600 ft). In winter the lower level is closed, when the water level is too high.\n\nEconomic and social importance\nToday, the Jeita Grotto is a popular recreational show cave and a major tourist attraction. It hosts approximately 280,000 visitors per year.\nThe Jeita grotto contributes heavily to the public life of the region. MAPAS, the firm which runs the grotto, is an important employer and provides full-time jobs for around 115 local residents of Jeita (30% of which are female). In addition to employment, the Jeita caves contribute 5% of ticket fees to the local municipality, between 10 and 20% of general revenue to the Lebanese ministry of tourism, and an additional 10% of ticket fees along with the 10% VAT to the Lebanese ministry of Finance.\nMoreover, the Jeita cave emits a spring with a flow ranging from 1–2 m3/s, providing fresh drinking water for one-and-a-half million inhabitants of the capital, Beirut. However, water pollution, due to domestic and agricultural runoff, remains a serious concern as recent analysis detected an increasing presence of coliform bacteria.\n\nAwards\nIn 2002, then French President Jacques Chirac, the United Nations World Tourism Organization and the World Bank accorded the top Sustainable Development in Tourism prize to MAPAS (the company that manages the site) at a summit dubbed “New Ties between Tourism and Culture” in Geneva.\nIn December 2003, on behalf of the Beirut-based private company MAPAS, Jeita received a prestigious award from the fifth Tourism Summits in Chamonix, France. \"Les sommets du tourisme\" recognized MAPAS’ efforts in restoring Lebanon's important touristic sites.\nThe Jeita Grotto was a candidate for the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition. It was selected as one of 28 finalists and is the only cave to be selected among the nominees. The New7Wonders Foundation announced the new wonders of nature in 2011. Jeita was not on the list.\nOther awards and certificates include:\n\n2000 Certificate of Recognition from \"Sukleen\"-Lebanon for its sorting and recycling campaign.\n2000 Appreciation from the Arab Musical Association\".\n1998 \"Best Tourism Project\" from the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism.\n1997 International Environmental Award from the German Travel Association (DRV).\n\nOther names\nThe name of the cave changed several times since its discovery. Initially referred to as the Grottos of Nahr al-Kalb, it was subsequently known as Djaita, Jehita, and finally Jeita. Nahr al-Kalb is the name of the river that runs through the grottoes, while  Jeita, meaning \"roaring water\" in Aramaic, is the town in which the cave's entrance is located. The transition from Grottoes of Nahr al-Kalb to Jeita Grottoes occurred in 1927 as newspapers widely used the latter name.\n\nNumismatics and philately\nIn 1961, Jeita became a national symbol when Lebanese authorities issued a stamp featuring the lower cavern to promote national tourism. Mr. Maroun Hajj, the oarsman shown on the stamp, still leads boat tours forty years after the stamp was issued. The Jeita Grotto is also featured on the 1964 one Lira (Lebanese pound) verso.\n\nPopular culture\nSeveral scenes of the 1977 Hindi film Chandi Sona (starring Sanjay Khan and Parveen Babi) were shot at the site.\n\nSee also\nList of Lebanese monuments\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJeita Grotto website \n360 HD Panoramas of Jeita Grotto\n360 Jeita grotto, the lower cave\nJeita Grotto at Beautiful World",
          "summary": "The Jeita Grotto (Arabic: مغارة جعيتا) is a system of two separate, but interconnected, karstic limestone caves spanning an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). The caves are situated in the Nahr al-Kalb river valley within the locality of Jeita, 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Though inhabited in prehistoric times, the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an underground river that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese. On October 31, 2025, the caves were illegally used as a wedding venue by a Lebanese-Italian couple, prompting national outrage and the prime minister to order the opening of an investigation.\nIn 1958, Lebanese speleologists George Farra and Sami Karkabi discovered the upper galleries 60 metres (200 ft) above the lower cave which have been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists safe access without disturbing the natural landscape. The upper galleries house the world's largest known stalactite.  The galleries are composed of a series of chambers the largest of which peaks at a height of 12 metres (39 ft).",

          "content": "Kadisha Valley (Arabic: وادي قاديشا / وادي قديشا, romanized: Wādi Qadīšā / Wādi Qādīšā), also romanized as the Qadisha Valley and also known as the Kadisha Gorge or Wadi Kadisha (French: Ouadi Qadisha), is a gorge that lies within the Bsharri and Zgharta Districts of the North Governorate of Lebanon. The valley was carved by the Kadisha River, also known as the Nahr Abu Ali when it reaches Tripoli. Kadisha means \"Holy\" in Aramaic, and the valley is sometimes called the Holy Valley. It has sheltered Christian monastic communities for many centuries. The valley is located at the foot of Mount al-Makmal in northern Lebanon.\nThe valley is at risk due to the encroachment of human settlement, illegal building, and inconsistent conservation activity. Although it is not on the UNESCO \"in danger\" list, there have been warnings that continued violations may lead to this step.\n\nGeography\nThe holy river, Nahr Qadisha, runs through the valley for 35 km from its source in a cave (grotto) a little way below the Forest of the Cedars of God. The sides of the valley are steep cliffs that contain many caves, often at more than 1,000 m and all difficult of access. The most scenic section of the valley stretches for approximately 20 km between Bsharri (Arabic: بشري), the hometown of Kahlil Gibran, and Tourza (Arabic: طورزا).\n\nCedars of God\nKadisha Valley lies west of the Forest of the Cedars of God, (situated on the mountain above), survivors of the ancient Cedars of Lebanon, the most highly prized building materials of the ancient world. The forest is said to contain 375 individual trees, two claimed to be over 3,000 years old, ten over 1,000 years old, and the remainder at least centuries old. The Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus Libani) is described in ancient works on botany as the oldest tree in the world. It was admired by the Israelites, who brought it to their land to build the First and the Second temples in Jerusalem. Historical sources report that the  cedar forests were beginning to disappear at the time of Justinian in the 6th century AD.\n\nHistory\nQadisha Valley's natural caves have been used as shelters and for burials since the Palaeolithic period. The Aassi Hauqqa (cave) in particular, near Hawqa, has yielded archaeological items indicating use in the Palaeolithic, Roman, and medieval periods. Since the early days of Christianity the valley has served as a refuge for those in search of solitude. The Maronite monks established their new center at Qannubin, in the heart of the Qadisha, and monasteries quickly spread over the surrounding hills. Early Maronite settlement in the valley combined both community and eremitic life.\nThe Mameluk sultans Baibars and Qalaoun led campaigns in 1268 and 1283, respectively, against the fortress-caves, monasteries, and the surrounding villages. Despite these attacks, the Deir Qannubin monastery was to become the seat of the Maronite Patriarch in the 15th century and remained so for 500 years. In the 17th century, the Maronite monks’ reputation for piety was promoted through the Maronite school founded in Rome in 1584. by dint of this exposure, many European poets, historians, geographers, politicians, and clergy visited and even settled in the Valley. The first printing press in the Middle East was founded in 1585 at the Monastery of Qozhaya in the Kadisha Valley, and in 1610 printed its first book, the Book of Psalms in the Syriac language. It used Syriac characters. Also this printing press was the first to print in Arabic language\n\nQadisha mummies\nEight well preserved natural mummies of villagers dating back to around 1283 A.D. were uncovered by Fadi Baroudy, Pierre Abi Aoun, Paul Kahawaja & Antoine Ghaouch, a team of speleologists from the GERSL scientific organisation in the Qadisha Valley between 1989 and 1991. These were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave along with a wealth of artifacts.\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nIn 1998, UNESCO added the valley to the list of World Heritage Sites because of its importance as the site of some of the earliest Christian monastic settlements in the world, and its continued example of Christian faith.\n\nChristian monasticism\nThe Kadisha (Holy) Valley is the site of some of the most ancient Christian monastic communities of the Middle East. The valley's natural caves, being comfortless, scattered, and difficult to access, provided monks and hermits sufficiently isolated and inhospitable conditions to live out Christian solitude, contemplation, and devotion. Many of the caves and irregularities in the cliff-sides were adapted to serve as individual dwellings (cells), chapels, and monasteries, and such buildings were further carved out of the cliff faces of the valley. Some have interiors covered with frescoes and facades. Around the caves there are terraced fields made by the hermits for growing grain, grapes, and olives.\nWhile there are numerous monasteries in the valley, there are several main monastic complexes:\n\nQannubin Monastery\nThe Qannubin Monastery (Deir Qannubin (دير قنوبين)), is on the northeast side of the Qadisha Valley. Although its foundation is often attributed to the Emperor Theodosius the Great in 375AD, it is more likely that it was established by a disciple of St Theodosius the Cenobite. For the most part it is cut into the rock cliff side - monastic cells, church, cloister, and accommodation for travelers.\nSince the fifteenth century, Qannubin started to be the See of the Maronite Patriarch.\n\nMonastery of St Anthony of Qozhaya\nThe Monastery of Qozhaya (Deir Mar Antonios Qozhaya (دير مارانطﻮنيوﺱ ﻗﺰحيا)) sits on the opposite flank of the Qadisha from Qannubin Monastery. Tradition has its foundation in the 4th century by St Hilarion, in honour of the Egyptian anchorite, St Anthony the Great, though the earliest documentary records date back only to around 1000 AD. It was destroyed in the 16th century but quickly restored. It comprises a corridor, meeting room, and chapel, with a mill and a number of hermitages cut into the rock nearby.\nThe monastery is also home to the first printing press of the Middle East that was invented in 1610. The book printed was a bilingual Psalter in a small folio of 260 pages. The psalms are arranged in two columns, on the right is the text in Syriac and on the left in Arabic, but written in Syriac letters, which is known as Garshuni.\n\nMonastery of Our Lady of Hawqa\nSaydet Hawqa is situated at an altitude of 1150m between Qannubin and Qozhaya Monasteries, at the base of an enormous cave. It was founded in the late 13th century by villagers from Hawqa. The hermitage appears to have been located on a wide platform at mid-level, where there is a water reservoir fed by channels. The upper level, only accessible by ladder, is a cave some 47m long, where the wealth of medieval pottery and arrowheads that have been found suggests its use as a refuge. Traces of fortifications have also been found in the Aassi Hauqqa (cave) at 1170m altitude. Archaeological finds show that this cave was in use in Palaeolithic, Roman, and Medieval times.\n\nMonastery of Mar Sarkis\nThe Monastery of Mar Sarkis, also called Ras Al Nahr, overlooks Ehden, Kfarsghab, Bane and Hadath El Jebbeh. Given its exceptional location overlooking the valley at an altitude of 1500m, the monastery is called the Watchful Eye of Qadisha. It is dedicated to Saints Sarkis and Bakhos (Saints Sergius and Bacchus). The name Ras Al Nahr means the top of the river as it is in the vicinity of the Mar Sarkis source, the main contributor to the Qlaynsieh River which joins the Qannubin River in the valley.\nThe first church of Saints Sarkis and Bakhos was built in the mid 8th Century A.D. on the ruins of a Canaanite temple dedicated to a god of agriculture - Dagan. Next to it, another church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed in 1198 A.D. Several buildings were added from 1404 till 1690, when Patriarch Estephan Douaihy restored part of the buildings.\n\nMonastery of Mar Lishaa\nMar Lishaa or St Elisha (دير مار ﺃليشع), mentioned first in the 14th century, is shared by two communities, a Maronite solitary order and the Barefoot Carmelite order. It consists of three or four small cells, a refectory, and some offices; the communal church includes four chapels cut into the rock-face.\n\nOther monasteries\nOther monastic establishments in the Qadisha are the Monastery of Mar Girgis, with the Chapel of Mar Challita, the Monastery of Mar Yuhanna, the Monastery of Mar Abun, with the Hermitage of Mar Sarkis, and the Monastery of Mart Moura, Ehden and others. There is another group of monasteries in the adjoining Hadchit Valley (Ouadi Houlat). They include the hermitage-monastery complexes of Deir es-Salib, Mar Antonios, Mar Semaane, and Mar Assia, along with the isolated chapels of Mar Bohna and Mar Chmouna.\n\nTowns, villages, and monasteries\nIn Bsharri District\nBsharri, Dimane, Bane, Blaouza, Tourza, Hasroun, Bazaoun, Bqarqacha, Bqaa Kafra, Braissat, Hadchit, Blaouza, Hadath, Monastery of Qannoubine, Monastery of Hawqa\n\nIn Zgharta District\nArbet Qozhaya, Ehden, Kfarsghab, Hawqa, Aintourine, Sereel, El Fradiss, Mazraat En Nahr, Beit Balais, Monastery of Qozhaya, Monastery of Mar Sarkis Ras Al Nahr\n\nMap\nSee also\nHadath el Jebbeh#Jebbeh for the meaning of Jebbeh, Jebbet\nMaronite mummies\nList of World Heritage Sites in the Arab states\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nQadisha.org\nDestination Lebanon: Qadisha (includes a brochure with photo gallery and map)\nMar Antonios Qozhaya Maronite Monastery\nHorsh Ehden Natural Reserve\nZgharta-Ehden Municipality\nUnofficial site about Zgharta and Ehden\nUnofficial site about Bsharri\nWadi Qannoubine, Kadisha Valley in 360\nEhden Family Tree",

          "content": "The Cedars of God (Arabic: أرز الربّ, romanized: Arz el-Rab, lit. 'Cedars of the Lord') is a forest in the Kadisha Valley of Bsharre, Lebanon. It is a vestige of the extensive forests of the Lebanon cedar that thrived across Mount Lebanon in antiquity. Early modern travelers' accounts of the wild cedars appear to refer to the ones in Bsharri; the Christian monks of the monasteries in the Kadisha Valley venerated the trees for centuries. The earliest documented references of the Cedars of God are found in Tablets 4–6 of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe Phoenicians, Israelites, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Turks used Lebanese timber. The Egyptians valued it for shipbuilding, and in the Ottoman Empire the timber was used to construct railways.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe mountains of Lebanon were once shaded by thick cedar forests. After centuries of persistent deforestation, the extent of the forests has been markedly reduced.\nIt was once said that a battle occurred between the demigods and the humans over the beautiful and divine forest of cedar trees near southern Mesopotamia.  This forest, once protected by the Sumerian god Enlil, was completely bared of its trees when humans entered its grounds 4700 years ago, after winning the battle against the guardians of the forest, the demigods.  The story also tells that Gilgamesh used cedar wood to build his city.\nOver the centuries, cedar wood was exploited by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Turks.  The Phoenicians used the cedars for their merchant fleets. They needed timbers for their ships and the cedar woods made them the \"first sea trading nation in the world\". The Egyptians used cedar resin for the mummification process and the cedar wood for some of \"their first hieroglyph bearing rolls of papyrus\".  In the Bible, Solomon procured cedar timber to build the Temple in Jerusalem. The Cedar Forest of ancient Mesopotamian religion appears in several sections of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The Lebanon cedar is mentioned 103 times in the Bible. In the Hebrew text it is named ארז and in the Greek text (LXX) it is named κέδρου. For example in Zechariah there is the verse \"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.\"\n\nEarly modern history\nEarly modern travelers' accounts of the wild cedars of Lebanon appear to refer to the Bsharri cedars. Pierre Belon visited the area in 1550, making him the first modern traveler to identify the Cedars of God in his Observations. Belon counted 28 trees:\n\nAt a considerable height up the mountains the traveler arrives at the Monastery of the Virgin Mary, which is situated in the valley. Thence proceeding four miles up the mountain, he will arrive at the cedars, the Maronites or the monks acting as guides. The cedars stand in a valley, and not on top of the mountain, and they are supposed to amount to 28 in number, though it is difficult to count them, they being distant from each other a few paces. These the Archbishop of Damascus has endeavored to prove to be the same that Solomon planted with his own hands in the quincunx manner as they now stand. No other tree grows in the valley in which they are situated and it is generally so covered with snow as to be only accessible in summer.\nLeonhard Rauwolf followed in 1573–75, counting 24 trees:\n\n ... saw nothing higher, but only a small hill before us, all covered with snow, at the bottom whereof the high cedar trees were standing... And, although this hill hath, in former ages, been quite covered with cedars, yet they are since so decreased, that I could tell no more but twenty-four that stood round about in a circle and two others, the branches whereof are quite decayed for age. I also went about this place to look for young ones, but could find none at all. \nJean de Thévenot counted 23 trees in 1655: \n\nIt is a Fobbery to say, that if one reckon the Cedars of Mount Lebanon twice, he shall have a different number, for in all, great and small, there is neither more or less than twenty three of them. \nLaurent d'Arvieux in 1660 counted 20 trees; and Henry Maundrell in 1697 counted 16 trees of the \"very old\" type:\n\nSunday, May 9 The noble (cedar] trees grow amongst the snow near the highest part of Lebanon; and are remarkable as well as for their own age and largeness, as for those frequent allusions made to them in the word of God. Here are some of them very old, and of prodigious bulk; and others younger of a smaller size. Of the former I could reckon up only sixteen, and the latter are very numerous. I measured one of the largest, and found it twelve yards six inches in girt, and yet sound; and thirty seven yards in the spread of its boughs. At about five or six yards from the ground, it was divided into five limbs, each of which was equal to a great tree. \nJean de la Roque in 1722 found 20 trees. In 1738 Richard Pococke provided a detailed description. \n\n... they form a grove about a mile in circumference, which consists of some large cedars that are near to one another, a great number of young cedars, and some pines. The great cedars, at some distance, look like very large spreading oaks; the bodies of the trees are short, dividing at bottom into three or four limbs, some of which growing up together for about ten feet, appear something like those Gothic columns, which seem to be composed of several pillars; higher up they begin to spread horizontally. One that had the roundest body, tho' not the largest, measured twenty four feet in circumference, and another with a sort of triple body, as described above, and of a triangular figure, measured twelve feet on each side. The young cedars are not easily known from pines; I observed they bear a greater quantity of fruit than the large ones. ... there are fifteen large ones standing. The Christians of the several denominations near this place come here to celebrate the festival of the transfiguration, and have built altars against several of the large trees, on which they administer the sacrament. These trees are about half a mile to the north of the road, to which we returned...\n\nFrom the 19th century onwards, the number of writers recording their visits increased substantially, and the number of cedars counted by the writers was in hundreds. Alphonse de Lamartine visited the place during his travel in Lebanon (1832–33), mentioning the cedars in some texts. In 1871, Edward Henry Palmer of the Palestine Exploration Fund described the cedars as follows:\n\nDescending by a steep zigzag path to the cedars, we pitched our camp and proceeded to examine the sacred and renowned grove, and could not repress a feeling of disappointment at its small extent, and the insignificant appearance of the trees. They consist of a little clump of trees of comparatively modern growth, not more than nine of them showing any indications of a respectable antiquity, and covering only about three acres of ground. They stand on a ridge consisting of five mounds and two spurs running nearly east and west, as in the accompanying plan. The whole number of trees we estimated at about 355; their size has also been grossly exaggerated, none of them being over 80ft. high. The ground is covered with débris of cedar and white limestone ... The trees have been lopped and otherwise maltreated ... They are scrubby scanty specimens, and not half so fine as may be seen in many an English park.\nConcern for the protection of the biblical \"cedars of God\" goes back to 1876, when the 102-hectare (250-acre) grove was surrounded by a high stone wall, paid for by Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein to protect saplings from browsing by goats. Nevertheless, during World War I, British troops used cedar to build railroads.\n\nModern history\nHenry Bordeaux visited Lebanon in 1922 and wrote Yamilé sous les cèdres (Yamilé under the cedars), a story about a Christian girl falling in love despite her family's wishes; she is shot dead under a cedar tree. A 1939 film was made by Charles d'Espinay of the story.\nTime, along with the exploitation of the wood and the effects of climate change, has led to a decrease in the number of cedar trees in Lebanon. However, Lebanon is still widely known for its cedar tree history, as they are the emblem of the country and the symbol of the Lebanese flag. The remaining trees survive in mountainous areas, where they are the dominant tree species. This is the case on the slopes of Mount Makmel that tower over the Kadisha Valley, where the Cedars of God are found at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). Four trees have reached a height of 35 metres (115 ft), with their trunks reaching 12–14 metres (39–46 ft).\nIn 1998, the Cedars of God were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The forest is rigorously protected. It is possible to tour if escorted by an authorized guide. After a preliminary phase in which the land was cleared of detritus, the sick plants treated, and the ground fertilized, the \"Committee of the Friends of the Cedar Forest\" initiated a reforestation program in 1985. The Committee planted 200,000 cedars, with 180,000 surviving.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nDelmass cave – Cave with medieval military fortifications in Lebanon\nAl Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve – Nature reserve in Lebanon\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nHepper, F.

It is a vestige of the extensive forests of the Lebanon cedar that thrived across Mount Lebanon in antiquity. Early modern travelers' accounts of the wild cedars appear to refer to the ones in Bsharri; the Christian monks of the monasteries in the Kadisha Valley venerated the trees for centuries. The earliest documented references of the Cedars of God are found in Tablets 4–6 of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe Phoenicians, Israelites, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Turks used Lebanese timber.

          "content": "The Mseilha Fort (Arabic: قلعة المسيلحة, romanized: Qal'at al-Msaylḥa) is a historic fortification located in Northern Lebanon, strategically positioned on the right bank of the Al-Jaouz River, in Hamat, approximately 2.5 kilometers northeast of the city of Batroun in North Lebanon. The fort's location enabled it to oversee key passages through the valley and control the ancient pathways circumventing the coastal Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory, a significant geological formation along the Lebanese coast that historically posed challenges to travelers.\nThe name Mseilha originates from the Arabic term for \"fortified place\", a diminutive of musallaha (Arabic: مسلحة), meaning \"fortified.\" Constructed on a limestone rock formation, the current structure dates back to the 17th century, likely commissioned by Emir Fakhr al-Din II. It lacks Crusader-era architectural elements, though historical records suggest the site may have been fortified during the Crusades. The existing fort, a product of traditional sandstone masonry, consists of two main sections, fortified walls up to two meters thick, a triangular courtyard, and defensive arrowslits, with adaptive design suited to the surrounding terrain.\nThe Mseilha Fort is conflated in some sources with the Puy du Connétable, a medieval Crusader estate and fortification that defended the nearby Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory. However, architectural and historical evidence suggests that these were distinct structures, with Mseilha constructed in the Ottoman period, likely on or near the site of the earlier Crusader fortifications. The Mseilha Fort was featured on the 1964 25 Lebanese Lira banknote.\n\nLocation\nThe Mseilha Fort stands on the right bank of Al-Jaouz river, to the south-east of Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory; a massive geological formation that cuts through the coast of Lebanon, making it historically difficult for travelers to circumvent. The fort is located within the municipal area of Hamat, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) northeast of Batroun, and is strategically located to control the crossing of the Al-Jaouz river and the pathways that climb the valley slopes or bypass the promontory.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name of the Mseilha Fort has been recorded in various forms over time, often influenced by the accounts of western travelers. The French archaeologist René Dussaud noted that Antoine-Alphonse Montfort, a French painter, was the first traveler to record the correct name of the fort, spelling it as Mseïla. The 17th-century English traveler and clergyman Henry Maundrell referred to it as Temseida, likely a corruption due to his limited familiarity with the Arabic language. Other travelers frequently misinterpreted or misspelled the name; the Swedish travel and orientalist Jakob Berggren referred to the fort as Qal’at Mezaibeha, following Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveler, who wrote Kalaat Meszabeha, likely due to a misreading of his travel notes. Similarly, the German explorer Ulrich Jasper Seetzen's manuscript was, according to Dussaud, misread by his editors, resulting in Kalat Inszelha. The first documented use of the name Mseilha is attributed to Dussaud in his 1897 publication, Voyage en Syrie. Later, Swiss historian Max von Berchem, writing in 1914, used the form El-Musailiha, further contributing to the variations in the fort's recorded name. Mseilha, derives from the Arabic word for \"fortified place,\" being a diminutive form of musallaha (Arabic: مسلحة), meaning \"fortified\". Other modern alternative romanizations include Qal'at al Mouseiliha, Musayliha, and Museiliha.\n\nHistory\nStrategic importance and early defenses\nFollowing the collapse of the Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory in the aftermath of the 551 CE earthquake, the coastal road linking the cities of Batroun, El-Heri and Tripoli was lost, transforming the northern shoreline into a high sea cliff. Consequently, a new road bypassing the promontory from the east was necessary to ensure communication between the coastal cities. Crossing the Nahr el-Jaouz valley, this road turns around Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory to reach the other side at a spot near El-Heri called Bab el-Hawa (meaning the \"door of the wind\").\nDuring the Crusades, the prominent land mass of Ras ash-Shaq'a held significant strategic value in the defense of the County of Tripoli. It guarded one of the region's most perilous road segments and overlooked the Bay of Heri, a coastal area well-suited for maritime landings. Due to its strategic importance, Ras ash-Shaq'a was designated as a separate lordship, distinct from the nearby fiefs of Nephin (modern Anfe) to the north and Boutron (modern Batroun) to the south. This territory was granted as a fief to the Constable of Tripoli, and there was likely a direct connection between holding the fortification of the fief and the office of constable.\nTwelfth century historian of the First Crusade, Albert of Aix described the strategic position of the defensive fortification that then existed atop the Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory to guard a narrow pass: \n\nThis mountain, detached from the more distant mountain chain, extends over a vast area of land all the way to the sea. A tower that dominates and controls the route through one of its gates rises at the summit of this mountain. This small structure can hold no more than six men, but these few would be enough to defend the pass against all who live under the sky.\nDuring the two centuries of Frankish occupation that followed, the Crusader Counts of Tripoli fortified Ras ash-Shaq'a, referring to the estate as \"Puy du Connétable\" (Hill of the Constable), \"Puy Guillaume, and the mountain pass as \"Passe Saint-Guillaume\", all of which, according to historian Maxime Goepp likely also refer to the Mseilha Fort. In a 1109 document, Bertrand, Count of Saint-Gilles, gifted the Church of St. Lawrence of Genoa full control over the Castle of the Constabulary (Latin: Castrum Constabularii) Gibellum (modern Jbeil), and one-third of Tripoli's territory. This lordship would be maintained until 1278, with the lords of Le Puy appearing as constables of the County up to that date. Around 1276, the vicinity of the Puy du Connétable was the site of a battle during the war between Guy II Embriaco of Gibelet and the Knights Templar against Bohemond VII, Count of Tripoli.\n\nConnection to the Puy du Connétable\nThe Mseilha Fort is conflated in some sources with the Puy du Connétable, but the exact location and extent of the latter remains uncertain with historians like Emmanuel-Guillaume Rey, and Henri Lammens, suggesting that the Puy likely referred to the estate located north of the promontory in al-Heri, or to a previous structure at the location of the Mseilha Fort respectively.  Scholars noted that while the rock on which the fort stands may have served as a military position in ancient times, the current fort structure does not include any elements from the Crusader era. The construction techniques, cutting methods, stone block sizes, and low arched doors and windows, among other elements, suggest that the current structure was built in the 17th century at the earliest.  The nineteenth-century French historian Ernest Renan could not relate the architectural elements in Mseilha to anything earlier than the Middle Ages. Paul Deschamps, a 20th-century historian of Crusader architecture, confirmed the lack of any Crusader-era features in the current fort but did not rule out the possibility that it replaced earlier Crusader constructions, as surviving Frankish literature indicates the Crusaders had fortified the strategic pass between Ras ash-Shaq'a and the foothills of Mount Lebanon.  Deschamps further posits, that the tower described by Albert of Aix during the march of the First Crusade in 1099 may have been located on the Mseilha rock, a theory echoed by French historians René Grousset and Jean Richard.\nModern scholars Davie and Salamé-Sarkis distinguish the Mseilha Fort from the historical Puy du Connétable. According to them, the entire promontory of Ras ash-Shaq'a was known from 1109 to 1282 in Crusader-era texts as Puy du Connétable. The estate was defended by the Castrum Constabularii, as mentioned in Bertrand of Saint-Gilles' 1109 document, which likely replaced an earlier tower described by Albert of Aix. According to  scholars Davie and Salamé-Sarkis, this tower may have been situated at the summit of Jabal an-Nuriyya, a strategic position on the northern tip of the Ras al Shaq'a promontory, that enabled monitoring of both the mountain pass and the bay of Heri.\n\nConstruction and historical mentions\nFrench traveler Jean de La Roque passed near the Mseilha Fort in late 1689 on his route from Tripoli to Batroun. He recorded a local account attributing the fort's construction to Emir Fakhr al-Din II, the Druze former ruler of Lebanon. Nineteenth century Lebanese scholar Father Mansur Tannus al-Hattuni, recounting events of 1624, noted that Emir Fakhr al-Din II \"ordered Sheikh Abu Nadir al-Khazin to construct the Mseilha Fort north of Batroun\". Hattuni's source, Tannus al-Shidyaq, mentions that the fort was built by Fakhr al-Din II and added in his account of 1631—six years after the fort's construction—that Abu Nadir al-Khazin conducted restoration work on the fort.  The year 1624 is accepted as the date of the fort's construction. Burckhardt, who visited the area in the early 19th century and confirmed that Mseilha Fort was of relatively recent origin. Maundrell, writing in 1697, described it as a small fort perched upon a steep, perpendicular rock, with walls conforming to the rock's natural shape, commanding the passage into a narrow valley.\n\nModern era\nAntoine-Alphonse Montfort took part in an expedition between 1837 and 1838 to visit Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and kept a detailed travel diary, which is now part of the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. He sketched landscapes, historical sites, and fortifications, among which the Mseilha Fort. Max Van Berchem and the Swiss architect Edmond Fatio, conducted the first comprehensive archaeological study of the site and documented their observations in their 1914 publication, Voyage en Syrie. The Mseilha Fort was featured on the reverse of the 25 Lebanese Lira banknote issued between 1964 and 1983. In 2007, restoration works were undertaken to make the site safe for visitors. Funded by USAID, these works are a continuation of a project conducted by SRI International-INMA to rehabilitate the fort, in cooperation with the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Culture - Directorate General of Antiquities.\n\nArchitecture and description\nThe Mseilha fort is 15 m (49 ft) high, built on a narrow limestone rocky outcrop. Its walls range from 1.5 to 2 m (4.9 to 6.6 ft) in thickness, and were built with medium-sized sandstone blocks, although some larger limestone blocks are also present, likely repurposed from older structures. The fort was built in two phases, resulting in two adjoining sections that form a single architectural unit. It is approached through a narrow, steep path on the northern side of the rock, which incorporates steps carved directly into the bedrock. This path leads to a small masonry terrace and a low, rounded-arch doorway. The entrance opens into a narrow, triangular courtyard bordered by a two-bay vaulted building on the southern side, possibly used for storage, with as a cistern in its lower level.  The curtain wall on the southern side rises approximately two meters higher than the northern wall, likely an intentional design to counterbalance the elevated mountain terrain to the south, which offers a natural strategic advantage controlling the entrance of the Nahr el-Jaouz valley. In the west tower, an archery chamber offers a vantage point with narrow arrow slits. The eastern section of the fort is more elevated and fortified, with a cluster of vaulted rooms surrounding a small inner courtyard. From this courtyard, a staircase leads to an upper level, where each room is similarly equipped with arrow slits for defense. At the easternmost tip, a square tower juts forward.\n\nSee also\nMuseiliha inscription – First-century AD inscribed boundary marker\nGigarta – Ancient settlement in North Lebanon\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAlbert of Aix (1824) [c. 1100].

          "content": "The Temple of Eshmun (Arabic: معبد أشمون) is an ancient place of worship dedicated to Eshmun, the Phoenician god of healing. It is located near the Awali river, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king Eshmunazar II in the Achaemenid era (c. 529–333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatonmilk and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.\nThe sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by Eshmun's Greco-Persian style marble temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern Awali) and from the sacred \"YDLL\" spring; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with Phoenician texts, such as the Bodashtart inscriptions and the Eshmun inscription, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.\nThe Eshmun Temple was improved during the early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced polytheism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.\n\nEshmun\nEshmun (Latinized form of the Phoenician 𐤀𐤔𐤌𐤍‎) was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes. The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.\nFrom a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V and Mati'el, king of Arpad; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty. Eshmun was identified with Asclepius as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.\n\nHistory\nHistorical background\nIn the 9th century BC, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Lebanon mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other Phoenician city. These payments stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC. When Assyrian king Sargon II died in 705 BC, King Luli joined with the Egyptians and Judah in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule, but was forced to flee to Kition (modern Larnaca in Cyprus) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by Sennacherib, Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated Ittobaal on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute. When Abdi-Milkutti ascended to Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to Baal I, the king of rival Tyre, and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon. Baal I and Esarhaddon signed a treaty in 675 in which Eshmun's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.\n\nConstruction\nSidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years (586–573 BC) by Nebuchadnezzar II. Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of Babylon. Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the Achaemenid Empire (c.529–333 BC). Eshmunazar I, a priest of Astarte, and the founder of his namesake dynasty, became king around the time of the Achaemenid conquest of the Levant. Archaeological evidence suggest that, at the time of the advent of the Eshmunazar dynasty, there already was a cultic space on the site of the temple, but there were no monumental constructions yet. Originally, the center of worship may have been a cave or a spring.\nIn the following years, Xerxes I awarded king Eshmunazar II with the Sharon plain for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the Greco-Persian Wars. Eshmunazar II displayed his new-found wealth by constructing numerous temples to Sidonian divinities. Inscriptions found on the king's sarcophagus reveal that he and his mother, Amoashtart, built temples to the gods of Sidon, including the Temple of Eshmun by the \"Ydll source near the cistern\".  As the Bodashtart inscriptions on the foundations of the monumental podium attest, construction of the sanctuary's podium did not begin until the reign of King Bodashtart. The first set of inscriptions bears the name of Bodashtart alone, while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince Yatonmilk.  Thirty foundation inscriptions are known to date; they were found concealed in the interior of the podium. The practice of intentional inscription concealment can be traced back to Mesopotamian roots, and it has parallels in the royal buildings of the Achaemenids in Persia and Elam. A Phoenician inscription, located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) upstream from the temple, that dates to the 7th year of Bodashtart's reign, alludes to water adduction works from the Awali river to the \"Ydll\" source that was used for ritual purification at the temple.\n\nRoman era and decline\nThe Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium. The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the Roman street from the podium. A Roman colonnade was built in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain. Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of the cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century. The site later fell into oblivion until the 19th century\n\nModern discovery\nBetween 1737 and 1742, Richard Pococke, an English anthropologist, toured the Middle East and wrote of what he thought were ruins of defensive walls built with 3.7-metre (12 ft) stone blocks near the Awali river. When the French orientalist Ernest Renan visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, Mission de Phénicie, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge. The discovery was made in 1900 by four workers who were extracting blocks from the temple on behalf of Druze notable Nassib Jumblatt. They noticed that certain blocks had inscriptions with the engravings painted in red. A local antiques dealer bought three of the stones, all with the same inscription. Due to the enormous size of the blocks, they were cut down to just 15 or 20 cm in thickness, and some stones were also cut into two or three pieces. The Ottoman authorities dispatched Theodore Makridi, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who again surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.\n\nAfter 1975\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon (1985–2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge, it is accessible from an exit ramp off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular archaeological importance since it is the best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon; it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List's Cultural category on July 1, 1996. In literature, the temple of Eshmun figures in Nabil Saleh's 2009 novel, The Curse of Ezekiel as the setting where Bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess Chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple's priests. The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 11, 2019, in the Cultural category. During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the sanctuary of Eshmun to safeguard it from damage.\n\nLocation\nA number of ancient texts mention the Eshmun Temple and its location. The Phoenician inscriptions on the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, a Sidonian king, commemorate the construction of a \"house\" for the \"holy prince\" Eshmun by the king and his mother, queen Amashtart, at the \"Ydll source by the cistern\". Dionysius Periegetes, an ancient Greek travel writer, identified the Eshmun temple by the Bostrenos River, and Antonin de Plaisance, a 6th-century AD Italian pilgrim recorded the shrine as near the river Asclepius fluvius. Strabo and other Sidonian sources describe the sanctuary and its surrounding \"sacred forests\" of Asclepius, the Hellenized name of Eshmun, in written texts. Located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Beirut and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon, the Eshmun Temple sits on the southern bank of the modern Awali river, previously referred to as Bostrenos or Asclepius fluvius in ancient texts. Citrus groves, known as Bustan el-Sheikh (Arabic: بستان الشيخ, the grove of the Sheikh), occupy the ancient \"sacred forests\" of Asclepius and are a favorite summer picnic location for locals.\n\nArchitecture and description\nBuilt under Babylonian rule (605–539 BC), the oldest monument at the site was a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that included an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of an early, Babylonian-style temple survived into modern time; these include marble torus-shaped column bases with moldings, facetted columns, and bull protome capitals. The Babylonian-style temple was dismantled around the middle of the 4th century BC. The remains of the demolished temple were cast in a favissa that only contained material dating from the 5th and first half of the 4th century BC.\nThe pyramidal structure was superimposed during the Persian period by a massive ashlar podium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) across by 1 metre (3.3 ft) thick, which were laid down in courses 1-metre (3.3 ft) high. The podium stands 22 metres (72 ft) high, runs 50 metres (160 ft) into the hillside, and boasts a 70-metre (230 ft) wide façade. The terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a Greco-Persian style marble temple built in the Ionic order around 500 BC. The marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft. During the Hellenistic period, the sanctuary was extended from the base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, 10.5 by 11.5 metres (34 ft × 38 ft), dating to the 4th century BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone \"Throne of Astarte\" carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th-century BC chapel – centered on a bull protome topped capital – that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.\nWidely known as the \"Tribune of Eshmun\" because of its shape, the altar of Eshmun is a white marble structure dating to the 4th century BC. It is 2.15 metres (7.1 ft) long by 2.26 metres (7.4 ft) wide and 2.17 metres (7.1 ft) tall. Unearthed in 1963 by Maurice Dunand, it stands on a limestone socleplated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall. The altar is adorned with Hellenistic style relief sculptures and is framed by decorative moldings, one of which divides the altar into two distinct registers of symmetrical composition. The upper register portrays 18 Greek deities, including two charioteers surrounding the Greek god Apollo, who is depicted playing a cithara (a type of lyre). The lower register honors Dionysus, who leads his thiasos (his ecstatic retinue) in a dance to the music of pipe and cithara players. The Tribune is displayed at the National Museum of Beirut. \n\nNortheast of the site, another 3rd century BC temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its 22-metre (72 ft) façade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a drunken revelry in honor of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius. The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from \"Ydll\" spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults. Later vestiges date from the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.\n\nFunction\nEshmun's cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BC. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the \"Ydll\" spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality. The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's fertilizing powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary. Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving votive traces of their devotion and proof of their cure. There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.\n\nArtifacts and finds\nApart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left in situ, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the National Museum of Beirut, the Louvre or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland. One of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric Phoenician name \"grtnt\" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess Tanit occurred in Sidon. A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is the Baalshillem Temple Boy, a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand. The boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem II, a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A31.5 cm × 27 cm (12.4 in × 10.6 in) limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6th century BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare. Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing the name of Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon. The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and Cypriot syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.\n\nPillaging\nTreasure hunters have sought out the Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 artifacts bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site found their way to Beirut's antiquities markets where they stirred the interest of the Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs. During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities Maurice Chehab, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the Byblos crusader castle, 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archaeology of Basel affirmed during a conference in Beirut in December 2009 the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.\n\nSee also\nPhoenician sanctuary of Kharayeb – Historic temple remains in Lebanon\nRoman temple of Bziza – Cultural heritage building in Bziza, Lebanon\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nStucky's drawings architectural elements and reconstructed model of the Temple of Eshmun",
          "summary": "The Temple of Eshmun (Arabic: معبد أشمون) is an ancient place of worship dedicated to Eshmun, the Phoenician god of healing. It is located near the Awali river, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king Eshmunazar II in the Achaemenid era (c. 529–333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatonmilk and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.\nThe sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by Eshmun's Greco-Persian style marble temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern Awali) and from the sacred \"YDLL\" spring; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with Phoenician texts, such as the Bodashtart inscriptions and the Eshmun inscription, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.\nThe Eshmun Temple was improved during the early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced polytheism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.",

          "content": "Deir al-Qamar (Arabic: دَيْر الْقَمَر, romanized: Dayr al-qamar, lit. 'Monastery of the moon') is a city south-east of Beirut in south-central Lebanon. It is located five kilometres outside of Beit ed-Dine in the Chouf District of the Mount Lebanon Governorate at 800 m of average altitude.\n\nHistory\nCrusader period\nThe oldest written reference to Deir el Qamar (Deir elcamar or Deir elchamar) goes back to 1257 and 1261 in the deeds of Julian of Shouf and Andrew of Chouf selling their lands and villages in their lordship of Chouf to the Teutonic Order as reported in Tabulae Ordinis Theutonici.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir al-Qamar was the capital and the residence of the Emirate of Mount Lebanon. It is also notable for its 15th-century Fakhreddine Mosque, Fakhreddine II Palace, and the palace of the Emir Yusuf Shihab - today housing the Municipal Council. A 17th-century synagogue is still standing in the village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the centre of Lebanese literary tradition.\nLady Hester Stanhope visiting Deir al-Qamar in 1812 wrote “I have traveled for nine hours together & never found a place to pitch a tent, except near one Village. The Vineyards are like stair cases, & every little flat place stuffed with mulberry trees for the silkworms, the roads are horrible, & the people savage & extraordinary, the women wearing a great tin trumpet on their heads & a veil suspended upon it, & seemingly very proud of these frightful horns.”\nIt was the first village in Lebanon to have a municipality in 1864, and it is the birthplace of many well known personalities, such as artists, writers, and politicians. It was the winter capital of the Druze Qaim-Maqamate of Lebanon (1840-1860), the summer capital being Baakleen. People from all religious backgrounds lived there and the town had a mosque, synagogue and Christian churches.\nIn the year 1860, Deir al-Qamar was destroyed during the civil war between Druze and Christians during which the town was set ablaze. Napoleon III sent a French contingent to rebuild it, recalling France ancient role as protector of the Christians in the Ottoman Empire as established by a treaty in 1523.\nIn 1864, Deir el-Qamar elected the first municipality in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nA census undertaken in Deir al-Qamar by the Ottomans during the reign of Fakhr-al-Din II's father, Qorqmaz bin-Maan, counted 156 men, all Druze. Today, 85% of Deir al-Qamar's inhabitants are Maronites and 14% are Melkites.\n\nGeneral aspect\nThe village retains a remarkable picturesque appearance with typical stone houses with red tile roofs. In 1945 it was placed under monument protection.\nIn 1943 the Lebanese president Bechara Al Khoury declared Deir al-Qamar the summer palace for the Lebanese Presidents.\nOne of the mayors was Georges Dib Nehme who also represented the region at the Parliament.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 98.05% of registered voters in Deir al-Qamar. 73.39% of the voters were Maronite Catholics and 15.80% were Greek Catholics.\n\nReligious sites\nOne of the important mosques in Deir al-Qamar is Fakhreddine Mosque and its goes back to 15th century. Built in 1493 by the Ma'nid emir Fakhr al-Din I and restored in the sixteenth century, it is the oldest mosque in Mount Lebanon.\nOne of the most important historical and religious site in Deir al-Qamar is Our Lady of the Hill known as Saydet El Talle. This Maronite church goes back to the 15th century.\nAccording to the Maronite Heritage web site\n\nthe legend says that there was a Druze Emir in Baakline looking at the hill of Deir al-Qamar. He saw a light coming out of the hill. He gathered his soldiers and ordered them to go in the morning and dig in the land. He said to them: \"If you find an Islamic symbol, build a mosque. If you find a Christian symbol, build a church.\" The soldiers went in the morning, dug in the land and found a rock with a cross on it and under the cross there was the Moon and Venus. That was the sign that long time ago, there was a temple dedicated to the Moon and Venus and later it became a church. Earthquakes and wars might be the reason for its disappearance.\nThe rock discovered by the soldiers can be found above the old gate of the church. A Byzantine column can be found inside the church. The inhabitants honor a miraculous icon of our Lady of the Hill placed behind the altar. It was painted in 1867 by the Italian artist Guerra. On the feast of Our Lady of the Hill—the first Sunday of August—thousands of believers go in a big procession with the miraculous icon from the entrance of Deir al-Qamar to the Church.\n\nThe Church of Saidet et Tallé in Deir el Qamar is one of the most significant historical and religious sites in Mount Lebanon. The original church was destroyed by the Saracens and later rebuilt during the reign of Fakhreddine I Maan (1518-1544). For centuries, this church has been revered by both Druze and Christians in Mount Lebanon, reflecting the close ties between the two communities. According to Pierre-Marie Martin, writing in 1870, the Druze venerated the church even more than the Maronites, often traveling long distances to pray to the Virgin Mary in their own way and \"witnessing numerous miracles\". Historian Glenn Bowman further highlights that in the early nineteenth century, Druze leaders would seek the Virgin Mary's favor at Saidet et Tallé before going into battle. They would touch the image of the Virgin Mary with their flags and place dust from under the altar in their turbans. The profound veneration of this church by the Druze led local Maronites to dub it the \"Church of the Virgin of the Druze\".\nAnother important religious site in Deir al-Qamar is the Mount of the Cross where pilgrims visit the Lamb of God Shrine (built in 2007), Father Yacoub Church (restored and consecrated as a church on June 24, 2008) and the Cross (built by Fr. Yacoub in 1932).\nDeir al-Qamar also had a well-established Jewish community, and a synagogue (built in 1638) which is today the site of the French Cultural Center.\n\nJewish community\nThe first record of a Jewish community in Deir al-Qamar in modern times is found in the writings of Rabbi Joseph Soffer, who visited Lebanon in 1759. Invited to the town to write a Torah scroll, he experienced an earthquake but successfully completed his work. He also reported visiting the nearby tomb of Noah and his son Shem. The village is referenced in the Responsa literature, particularly in the \"Khut haMeshulash.\" All in all, these sources suggest that under the rule of Yusuf Shihab and Zahir al-Umar, a Jewish community existed, complete with its own beth din and synagogue. Records indicate that there was a demand for additional Torah scrolls, which wealthy Jews in the community were capable of funding.\nRabbi Joseph Schwartz provides additional insights into the Jewish community of Deir al-Qamar, estimating it consisted of around 80 householders, primarily engaged in trade. He reports that the Jews of Deir al-Qamar leased nearby mountains from the Emirs for iron production, exporting iron horseshoes throughout the country. The Jews of Deir al-Qamar are also known to be landowners of vineyards and olive plantations, participating in agriculture. A letter dated 1865 reveals that, following the hardships of 1859-1860, which compelled their departure from the village, the Jewish residents sold off all their fields and plantations to their Christian neighbors.\nAfter the 1837 Safed earthquake, the Jewish sages of Safed sought assistance from the Jews of Deir al-Qamar. Thirty-five armed Jews responded, arriving in Safed to aid in clearing the debris, retrieving the deceased for burial, and potentially providing material assistance to those impacted by the disaster. In 1847, the Jews of Deir al-Qamar fell victim to a blood libel. Nine locals were falsely accused of murdering a Maronite child who had become lost and died of exposure, freezing to death in one of the vineyards. With the assistance of the British consul, they were ultimately released from custody.\nThe 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon marked the demise of the Jewish community in Deir al-Qamar. Alongside the Druze, the local Jews were compelled to depart, selling their homes and lands to the Christians. Initially, the synagogue remained under Jewish ownership, with the Jews blocking it with stones to prevent its desecration. The synagogue was eventually sold in 1893, against the advice of the sages of Jerusalem, who instructed that it should not be sold unless for the construction of a new synagogue.\n\nWax museum\nThe Marie Baz Wax Museum was created by Mr. Samir Emile Baz in the family palace. It tells the story of Lebanon from the 15th century to the present day through its main characters.\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nChurch of Saidet et Tallé\nDeir el Qamar Synagogue\nEmirate of Mount Lebanon\nFakhreddine II Palace\nFakhreddine Mosque\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nStrehlke, E., ed.

          "content": "Deir El-Qamar (دير القمر, de Deir « couvent » et Qamar « Lune ») est un village du gouvernorat du Mont-Liban au Chouf au Liban, situé à 16 km du littoral méditerranéen et à 38 km de la capitale Beyrouth, à 800 m d'altitude moyenne. En arabe, دير القمر, le nom signifie « Le couvent de la Lune », car s'y trouvait un temple romain consacré à la Lune, à l'emplacement des actuels couvent et église Saidet El Talle. Il est situé dans le district du Chouf à côté de la ville de Beiteddine.\nAujourd'hui c'est un village majoritairement habité par des chrétiens, un des rares villages chrétiens du Chouf demeurés intacts à la fin de la guerre du Liban. Il est aussi connu pour le blocus organisé par les miliciens du Parti socialiste progressiste de Walid Joumblatt, lors de la guerre de la montagne.\n\nHistoire et culture\nLes plus vieux documents écrits qui mentionnent Deir el-Qamar, en français médiéval « Deir elcamar » et « Deir elchamar », ainsi que tous les noms des villages du Chouf (écrit « Schouf », « Schuf » et « Sscuff »), dont certains n'existent plus aujourd'hui, remontent à 1257 et 1261 dans plusieurs actes de vente entre Julien Grenier, seigneur de Saete et Beaufort, et Iohanne de Schouf, seigneur du Schuf, et Gezin, et Anno von Sangershausen, Maître de l'Ordre des Teutoniques (« frere Anne honorable meistre de l'hopital des Alemans en Jerusalem »). Ces actes de vente sont reportés textuellement en latin et en français médiéval dans le livre Tabulae Ordinis Theutonici dont une copie se trouve à la bibliothèque publique de New York.\nCe même Julien Grenier s'était allié en 1260 aux Mamelouks contre les envahisseurs mongols qui avaient déjà occupé presque tout le Proche-Orient. De son château de Beaufort qui domine le Sud de la vallée de la Béqaa, ses soldats localisèrent une patrouille de chevaliers mongols. Il envoya ses chevaliers massacrer cette patrouille dont le chef s'est révélé être le neveu du général des armées mongoles Kitbuqa. Ce dernier organisa une expédition punitive et détruisit complètement la Saete, le siège de Julien Grenier. Les Mamelouks sont alors rentrés à Saida complètement détruite pour ne plus en ressortir. On sait aussi que Deir el-Qamar fut complètement détruite vers la même période. Mais est-ce qu'elle l'a été par les Mongols sur leur route de la Béqaa vers Saida ou par les Mamelouks poursuivant les Mongols après leur défaite à Ain Jalout, où Kitbuqa fut tué, se débarrassant en même temps des chevaliers Teutoniques qui venaient d'acquérir tout le fief du Chouf il y avait dix ans à peine ? \nLes Mamelouks confirmèrent le fief du Chouf aux émirs Druzes Maan en récompense, dans leur conquête sur ce qui restait du Royaume Croisé de Jérusalem.\nDeux cent cinquante ans plus tard, en 1516, les émirs Maan s'allièrent contre les Mamelouks avec les Ottomans victorieux, qui les ont confirmés dans leurs possessions.\nL'émir Fakhr ed-Din I Maan permit alors à ses ressortissants chrétiens de rebâtir Deir el-Qmar complètement détruite deux cent cinquante ans plus tôt, sachant bien qu'il y avait des vestiges d'églises chrétiennes.\nDeir-el-Qamar fut la capitale de l'émirat du Mont-Liban au début du XVIIe siècle sous le règne de l'émir druze Fakhr-al-Din II, jusqu'à sa mort en 1635. Elle en resta la capitale jusqu'à la construction du palais de Beiteddine par Bachir Chehab II sur un promontoire en face de Deir el-Qamar, vers 1818.\nLe village se distingue également par sa mosquée Fakhreddine du XVe siècle, son palais Fakhreddine II et le palais de l'émir Youssef Chihab (en), qui abrite aujourd'hui le conseil municipal. La synagogue de Deir el Qamar datant du XVIIe siècle se trouve également dans le village, bien que fermée au public. À son apogée, la ville était un des foyers majeurs de la tradition littéraire libanaise.\nDeir el-Qamar fut encore complètement détruite à la suite des massacres de 1860 par les Druzes. Florimond de Basterot raconte dans son Journal d'un voyage en Orient et en Italie que « Deir-el-Qamar était une ville entièrement chrétienne au milieu d’un district druze. Elle était riche, prospère, et on la jalousait. Elle avait un gouverneur turc. Il désarma les habitants et leur promit de les défendre jusqu'à son dernier homme, puis il ouvrit les portes aux égorgeurs druzes, et il leur livra même les femmes et les enfants réfugiés auprès de lui dans sa résidence. Le massacre fut général. En 1861, Deir-el-Qamar était en ruines, on y voyait encore des traces horribles des massacres, du sang, des lambeaux de chair desséchés, des cheveux de femmes collés aux murailles parmi les décombres. ».\nElle fut rebâtie par un contingent français envoyé par Napoléon III revendiquant un ancien traité établi en 1523 entre le Royaume de France et l'Empire ottoman, faisant de la France la protectrice des minorités chrétiennes de l'Empire.\nEn 1864, les habitants de Deir el-Qamar élurent la première municipalité des provinces arabes de l'Empire ottoman après Constantinople.\nCe village conserve un aspect pittoresque remarquable, avec des maisons typiques en pierre. C'est un lieu touristique, et il fait bon se promener dans ses rues. Il a été classé en 1945 comme monument historique.\nPendant la guerre du Liban, la ville est, comme en 1860, le lieu de massacres perpétrés par les Druzes contre les chrétiens dans le cadre du « nettoyage ethno-religieux ».\nC'est une des rares communes du Liban à avoir un plan concret d'urbanisme et à s'y tenir.

          "title": "Zahlé",
          "content": "Zahlé (Arabic: زَحْلة) is a city in eastern Lebanon, and the capital and  largest city of Beqaa Governorate, Lebanon. With around 150,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city in Lebanon after Beirut and Tripoli and the fourth-largest taking the whole urban area (the Jounieh urban area is larger).\nZahlé is located 55 km (34 mi) east of the capital Beirut, close to the Beirut-Damascus road, and lies at the junction of Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley, at a mean elevation of 1,000 m. Established in the 18th century by Christians, Zahlé maintains its predominantly Greek Catholic character. The city has historically enjoyed convenient accessibility via road and rail, leveraging its strategic location as a trade hub.\nZahlé is known as the \"Bride of the Beqaa\" and \"the Neighbor of the Gorge\" for its geographical location and attractiveness, but also as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\". It is famous throughout Lebanon and the region for its pleasant climate, numerous riverside restaurants and quality arak. Its inhabitants are predominantly Melkite Greek Catholic and are known in Arabic as Zahlawi.\n\nEtymology\nThe source of the city's name is unclear, some historian relate it to the ancient Roman god of fertility - Zohal. Evidence of Roman presence are the ruins found. Others claim the derives from the occasional landslides that take place on deforested hills around the town are probably at the origin of the name.\n\nHistory\nThere has been human activity in the area for at least five thousand years. In the 18th century, Zahlé was a small village of some 200 houses. Its relative geographic isolation from the local centres of power in Mount Lebanon and Syria caused the village not to have any significant allies in the region to fall back on in case of conflicts or attacks. Zahlé was burned in 1777 and 1791.\nTradition holds that many Christians migrated from the Baalbek region in the 18th century to the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfush dynasty's oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned that interpretation by pointing out that the dynasty was closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahlé (where Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the 18th century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek then to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes and established itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even served as consuls of Iran.\nAt the end of the 18th century, Zahlé had one thousand inhabitants and two hundred houses. By 1820, Zahlé's population had grown to 5,000. By 1850 it was 7,000 to 8,000 and the town had become the commercial centre for the Beka'a and main depot for the local grain harvest. Some of the factors for the expansion included the Egyptian Occupation (1831–41), which lead to the opening of the country to European trade, the Crimean War which had caused grain shortages in Europe and the expansion of silk production in Mount Lebanon.\nBesides controlling the grain trade, Zahlé became a centre for livestock from the region of Syria and produced leather, woven and dyed goods, trading with Aleppo, Damascus and Beirut. By the 1860's and 1870's the local merchants were prosperous but were still dependent on banks in Beirut for credit for their transactions.\nOn 7 September 1975, during the civil war, the Lebanese Forces militia, at that time led by Elie Hobeika agreed to 100 Syrian soldiers and 20 intelligence officers taking up strategic positions in the town.\nThe current population is not accurately known, since no census has been conducted in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates from 2017 are of a population of 386,362 people in the town proper, making it the country's fourth largest. (The locals tend to give figures of 200,000 or 300,000 inhabitants, which, however, are misleading and completely unrealistic.) The urban area includes the neighbouring towns of Saadnayel, Taalabaya, Chtaura and Jdita to the southwest, which have come to form a single urban entity since the late 1990s due to unplanned growth, and is home to about 100,000 people. The metropolitan area extends over much of the Zahlé District and additionally comprises:\n\nthe town of Kab Elias to the southwest\nthe town of Bar Elias to the south\nthe villages of Furzol, Ablah and Niha to the northeast\nand the towns of Riyaq, Haoush Hala and Ali en Nahri to the east\nwith a total population close to 200,000.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 82.58% and Muslims made up 16.81% of registered voters in Zahlé. 28.27% of the voters were Greek Catholics, 23.77% were Maronite Catholics, 12.62% were Greek Orthodox, 10.24% were Shiite Muslims, 7.55% were Syriac Orthodox and 6.55% were Sunni Muslims.\nZahlé is one of the largest predominantly Christian towns in Lebanon and the Middle East (with Christians once forming around 90% of its total population during the French occupation) and the one with the largest number of Catholics. While several Middle Eastern cities (including Damascus, Cairo and Amman) have larger Christian communities, these do not constitute a majority. In Lebanon, Beirut also has a larger Christian population than Zahlé (in the city proper), but most of this population belongs to the Greek Orthodox confession. Jounieh is also bigger than Zahlé, and was also overwhelmingly Christian before the French withdrawal.\nOnly two Muslim families remained inside Zahlé during the civil war: Hindi and Zrein. Zahlé's Muslim minority is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Karak Nuh (where Noah's tomb is allegedly located) and Haoush al-Umara, specifically, in an area named \"Hay al-watani\", on the northeastern and southwestern edge of town, respectively. Sixty-two percent of Muslims in the area are Shia, while the remaining 38% are Sunnis. In the past the town also had a Druze minority and even a small Jewish population, most of which, however, emigrated during the Lebanese Civil War.\nZahlé has been a land of emigration since the early 20th century, with most people emigrating to South America, mainly Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. During the civil war in the 1970s and 1980s, a new flow of migrants left the town for the United States, Canada, Australia and Brazil. In recent years, emigration has continued, with Canada and the United Arab Emirates being the main destinations. Today, an estimated 250,000 people of local descent live abroad, most of them in Colombia and Brazil.\n\nEconomy\nBeing the main town of the Beqaa Valley, Lebanon's most important agricultural region, the economy of Zahlé has long been built on agriculture. Grapes are the area's chief product, with vineyards forming a prominent feature of the surrounding landscape. Vines are also individually grown on lattice, on many of the older houses' terraces. A sizable part of the local produce supplies the three wineries present in and around the town, and the numerous distilleries producing arak, the local liquor which Zahlé is famous for.\nZahlé saw at a time a prosperous commercial activity due to its location midway between Beirut and Damascus. Paradoxically, it regained some of that activity during the civil war, when the growing instability in Beirut led to a decentralization of the economy. Furthermore, taxation was nonexistent due to the collapse of State authority, which Zahlé took advantage of to expand its industrial and commercial sectors.\nA number of companies and state bodies have their headquarters for the Beqaa region in Zahlé, including the Central Bank of Lebanon and the Lebanese Chamber of Commerce.\n\nEducation\nZahlé is evolving into a regional center of higher education, after many universities have opened branches there in recent years. Institutes of higher education currently represented in the town include:\n\nLebanese University\nSaint Joseph University\nHoly Spirit University of Kaslik\nAntonine University\nAmerican University of Science and Technology\nThe National Technical Institute\n\nTransportation\nZahlé is connected to Beirut (55 kilometres (34 mi) to the west), and from there to all coastal cities, through the Beirut-Damascus road, which passes to the southwest of the urban area. The journey can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the traffic. Damascus, Syria, is 73 km (45 mi) to the southeast, and is normally reached within one-and-a-half hours, excluding the waiting time at the border. Despite continuously undergoing works and repairs, the Beirut-Damascus road remains in poor condition, and is due to be replaced by a new, multimillion-dollar highway as the main international route; however, the completion date is still unclear.\nZahlé is also connected to Baalbek (36 km (22 mi) to the northeast) by the trans-Beqaa road, which continues further north towards Homs, Syria. \nDue to widespread car ownership, public transportation remains underdeveloped. There is a single bus line, which runs on the central avenue at rather irregular times. Interurban transportation is done by minivans, which stop on the Manara roundabout at the town's entrance. Zahlé's railway station was located in Muallaqa, but was abandoned after all rail transport in Lebanon stopped during the civil war.\nThere were plans to convert the nearby Rayak Air Base (located 10 km (6 mi) to the East of Zahlé), into a civil airport serving the town and the whole valley. A regional airport could prove vital when the road to Beirut is closed because of heavy snowfall. However, the project froze in the early 2000s, after the runway extension had been initiated.\n\nMain sights\nBerdawni Promenade\nThe banks of the Berdawni River have long been a place where people of Zahlé and other parts of Lebanon come to socialize. The town's most popular attraction is a 300-metre (984 ft) promenade along the river, referred to as \"Al Wadi\" (\"the valley\"). Sheltered between the ravine's limestone cliffs, it is lined up with large outdoor restaurants, cafes and playrooms, and shaded by trees. These restaurants specialize in traditional Lebanese meze served with arak. The promenade is closed during late fall and winter, when cold winds from the mountain sweep through the ravine.\n\nOur Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa\nLocated on a hilltop to the southwest of Zahlé, this is a 54-metre-high (177 ft) concrete tower, entirely clad in white marble, and topped with a 10-metre-tall (33 ft) bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of an Italian artist. It is by far Zahlé's most prominent structure—visible from most of the city and from several miles around in the central Bekaa Valley. At its base is a chapel that can seat a little over a hundred people. The top of the tower features sweeping views over Zahlé and the Bekaa Valley.\n\nTown Hall (Old Serail)\nThis Ottoman building was constructed in 1850 to serve as the town's Serail. Located just downhill from Our Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa, it is a mix of local and Ottoman architecture, and features an atrium occupied by an inner garden and surrounded by arcades. Though still known as \"the Old Serail\", it currently serves as the Town Hall. In the past, the ground floor used to house the local prison, which suffered of severe overcrowding and substandard conditions. The prison was transferred in 2009 to a new location in Muallaqa, with room for about 800 inmates and much more adequate infrastructure.\n\nThe Catholic Cathedral (Our Lady of Salvation)\nThis grandiose complex dates back to 1720, and consists of a series of stone-clad buildings around a large inner courtyard: the church itself (which is the oldest part), the seat of the Archbishop (a converted former monastery), and a small chapel housing an icon, which is said to be a reproduction of a portrait of the Virgin Mary by Saint Lucas. It also features a monumental entrance, an underground cemetery, and a 40-metre-high (130 ft) bell tower, atop of which a large marble clock was mounted in 1993. Part of the complex was destroyed by a bomb attack in April 1987, and rebuilt ever since.\n\nGrand Hotel Kadri\nThe grand Hotel Kadri is a prime example of the traditional stone architecture of Zahlé, both in and out. It has long been used by most officials and dignitaries visiting the town, as its largest and most luxurious hotel. The Ottomans converted it to a hospital during World War I. During the Lebanese Civil War, it was occupied by Syrian troops and sustained enormous damage. An ambitious restoration project in the mid-1990s was able to bring it back to its former glory. The hotel closed in February 2011 due to a conflict between its direction and the Catholic Church (its effective owner since 1999) and reopened later in 2013.\n\nMemshieh Park\nSituated across the street from Grand Hotel Kadri, Memshieh is Zahlé's oldest and shadiest park (newly opened J.T.Skaff Park is larger, but contains considerably fewer trees). The park houses a collection of marble tables with mosaic depictions of several sites in Lebanon, a small pond with waterlilies, a semi-circular marble tholos, and several sculptures representing famous locals. In 2003, the municipality covered a 25 m (82 ft) fir (the park's tallest) with thousands of lights, in an attempt to break the world record for the largest natural Christmas tree.\n\nArchaeological sites\nZahlé in itself offers little archaeological interest; however, the Château Ksara winery is worth a visit for its maze of vaults which dates back to Roman times. The suburb of Karak Nuh also features a curiosity: a 40-metre-long (131 ft) stone structure inside the local mosque, which local tradition believes to be the Tomb of Noah (but is probably a section of a Roman aqueduct).\nFurthermore, there are several ancient sites of interest in nearby locations:\n\nIn Qabb Ilyas (12 km (7 mi) to the southwest): rock sculptures of three deities that seem to be of Roman origin\nIn Anjar (18 km (11 mi) to the south): the unique ruins of an Umayyad palace built following a Roman layout, using recycled Hellenistic and Roman material. The palace is classified as a World Heritage Site. A Roman temple also stands on a hilltop above nearby Majdel Anjar.\nAbove the village of Furzol (8 km (5 mi) to the northwest): a series of rock-cut Roman tombs in the limestone cliffs\nIn Niha (11 km (7 mi) to the northwest): two exquisite Roman temples bearing Phoenician architectural elements (just outside the village), and two others in need of restoration (higher up, in the area referred to as \"the Fortress\").\nTwo more sites worth visiting are a more distant trip away:\n\nKamed al Lawz (32 km (20 mi) to the south) is the most important Bronze Age settlement in Lebanon, with finds from the Phoenician, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods having been uncovered as well.\nThe  Roman archaeological complex of Baalbek (another World Heritage Site) is located 36 km (22 mi) to the northwest.\n\nCulture\nZahlé's culture has long revolved around its signature crop, the grape, and its products, wine and arak. Arak, in particular, has traditionally been served in cafés at virtually any time of the day. The city is known as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\".\nZahlé's most important cultural event is the \"Festival of the Vine\", traditionally held each September, during which concerts, plays, poetry evenings and artistic exhibitions are organized daily over the course of two or three weeks. The final Saturday evening features the crowning of the \"Maid of the Vine\", the local beauty queen, and the next afternoon, the festival closes with arguably its most popular event: a parade of floats held on the town's main avenue. \nThe other central aspect of the local culture is religious devotion. Zahlé is still a very Catholic and conservative town, and many of its inhabitants display a pride with their religious identity. \nProphet Elias (Elijah) is the town's patron saint, whose feast on July 20 is traditionally celebrated with fireworks. Another notable holiday is Corpus-Christi, celebrated on the first Thursday of June with a large-scale procession, with a torch-lit parade being held on the previous evening. The Corpus Christi celebration dates back to 1825, when the town was spared the ravages of bubonic plague.\n\nClimate\nZahlé has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with continental influences.\n\nPeople\nShakira, Colombian-Lebanese Singer\nSaid Akl, poet, philosopher and politician\nFouad El Turk, poet, former Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations and head of the Forum of Lebanese Ambassadors\nCharles Elachi (from nearby Riyaq), director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in NASA\nElias Hrawi, president of Lebanon 1989–1998\nJoseph Raya, Melkite Greek Catholic archbishop and civil rights activist\nLouis Khalil, Lebanese priest of the Maronite Church\nNajwa Karam, Lebanese singer and actress\nWael Kfoury, Lebanese singer and actor\nIsabel Bayrakdarian, Armenian-Canadian operatic soprano\nKarl Sharro, Lebanese-Iraqi architect and writer based in London\nMário Zagallo, Brazilian footballer and manager, is of Lebanese ancestry from Zahlé\nKhalil Khamis (born 1995), Lebanese footballer\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nZahlé is twinned with:\n\n Bordeaux, France, since 2006\n\nReferences\nView From Zahle: Security And Economic Conditions In The Central Bekaa 1980-1985\n[1]\non Lebanon and the Peace Process, \"Bashir Gemeyel and Syria Fight Over Zahle\"\nConflict and Consensus, \"Zahlé and Dayr Al-Qamar, two market towns during the civil war of the 1860s.\"\n\"Zahlé and Forzol\"\nDictionary of the Names of Towns and Villages in Lebanon, Anis Freiha, 1976\nHage Chahine, Carlos and Nevine (2008).

Le nom de Zahlé est dérivé d'un mot arabe signifiant « glissante » et cela est dû au glissement des pentes des montagnes chaque année après la fonte de la neige.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville compte 60 000 résidents en 2011, 120 000 habitants avec ses banlieues, et environ 200 000 habitants dans sa zone métropolitaine.\nZahlé est un centre économique et administratif important dans la Bekaa, avec des activités industrielles, commerciales, de services et de loisirs. La ville accueille le siège du gouvernorat de la Bekaa, des tribunaux, des hôpitaux, des écoles, des collèges techniques et des centres universitaires régionaux, ainsi que le siège de la chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Zahlé et de la Bekaa.\nZahlé est reconnue pour son climat agréable, sa cuisine traditionnelle surtout dans les nombreux restaurants qui longent la rivière Nahr el-Berdawni ainsi que pour le grand nombre de célèbres poètes et écrivains qui ont marqué le siècle passé. Toutes ces caractéristiques ont rendu Zahlé « Ville du vin et de la poésie ».\nAutour de Zahlé, sur les contreforts du Mont Liban, les habitants font pousser de la vigne, des céréales, des fruits et des légumes. Dans la plaine à l'Est sont cultivées principalement la vigne et la pomme de terre.\nLa ville de Zahlé peut être considérée comme la plus grande ville catholique du Proche-Orient – la majorité de sa population est de rite grec catholique – puisque Ashrafieh, le secteur chrétien de la ville de Beyrouth, est à majorité orthodoxe. C'est la ville d'exception au Liban avec son alimentation en électricité 24 heures sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7 (Electricité de Zahlé).\n\nHistorique de la ville\nAu XVIIIe siècle, un grand nombre d'émigrants provenant de la Békaa, du Mont-Liban et du Houran s'installent sur les bordures de Berdawni et, au XIXe siècle, la ville devient le premier état autonome de la région et se caractérise par ses propres drapeau et hymne.\nLa ville a été brûlée plusieurs fois : 1771, 1791 et 1860. Elle a été reliée au chemin de fer en 1885, ce qui a donné à la ville un aspect commercial étant le « port intérieur » de la Békaa et la Syrie, et un centre de transaction pour l'agriculture et les marchandises entre Beyrouth et Damas.\n\nBataille de Zahlé\nÀ la fin de décembre 1791, Jahjah bin Mustafa Al Harfoushi a établi un plan pour occuper Baalbek et expulser les gendarmes du gouverneur de Al-Sham Ahmad Pasha Al-Jazzar, mais qu'une centaine de guerriers[Quoi ?], alors il a embauché une autre centaine des Zahliotes et des gens de la montagne pour une journée.\nIl y avait des gardes sur la ville depuis l'ouest, là où les plaines s'étiraient, alors il a choisi d'entrer au nord, du côté de Labwa. Son plan était d'entrer  dans le centre-ville sans que personne le ressente, empêchant ses hommes de faire un mouvement ou une voix  et leur donnant le mot de passe « Abdullah », de sorte que quiconque ne leur répondrait pas en termes similaires  serait immédiatement tué. \nAprès que les gardes ont été tués, son frère Sultan et ses hommes sont entrés dans la ville après minuit, et quand ils sont arrivés au milieu de celle-ci, il a donné le signal en tirant et en criant haut, de sorte que les soldats pensent qu'une grande armée les avait attaqués, et qu’ils ont été surpris sans avoir pu se battre. Alors Mustafa Al Harofushi a occupé la ville et y est resté .\nLes fugitifs sont arrivés à El Sham et ont informé le Mollah Ismail de ce qui leur était arrivé. Il a donc promis de se venger de Jahjah, et il est allé à Zahle avec 1200 cavaliers. Il y avait très peu d'hommes et de munitions, mais des tranchées sont creusées tout autour de la ville pour que les chevaux n'entrent pas. Ismail a alors attaqué la ville par les côtés nord et sud, alors, les hommes se sont réfugiés dans les tranchées. Ils sont abattus sans apparaître devant les soldats, puis il est parti vaincu, et la tâche du sultan et de vingt de ses hommes était de résister à la deuxième division de l'armée. Le sultan lui-même a conçu une diversion que les militaires poursuivent, de sorte qu'il les pousse à s'approcher du réservoir, où ils deviennent une cible facile pour l'arme du latent.\nCette bataille a duré plus de cinq heures. L'armée (Mullah Ismail) a été vaincue après son impact avec de nombreux morts et blessés. Un seul homme, Ibn Moubarak, a été tué par les défenseurs (Jahjah et Sultan et les défenseurs avec eux).\n\nLes quartiers de Zahlé\nLe fleuve de Berdawni qui parcourt la ville partage les quartiers en deux zones parallèles : Zone Est et la Zone Ouest .\n\nTourisme\nTourisme religieux\nNotre dame de Zahlé et de la Békaa\nChez les habitants de la Békaa et surtout pour les Zahliotes, la Vierge Marie a une place historique importante pour bénir et sauver la ville et les citoyens. En 1957, après les évènements qui ont ravagé le Liban et Zahlé, une demande a été présentée à  l’archevêque des Catholiques Aftimos Yoakim afin d'autoriser la construction d'un sanctuaire avec une tour sur l'une des collines de la ville qui porte une statue de 10 m de la Vierge Marie pour l'honorer et montrer leur amour et de leurs remerciements. Après l'acceptation de l'archevêque, les travaux ont commencé en 1965 avec l'apposition de la statue le 26 janvier de cette année. Les travaux ont été arrêtés durant la guerre civile libanaise (1975-1990). La statue de la Vierge Marie porte l'enfant Jésus et un épi de blé (symbole des récoltes de la Békaa et de l'amour de Jésus).\n\nL’Archéparchie des Grecs Catholiques Melkites de Fourzol, Zahlé et de la Békaa\nL’évêché a été établi dans le village de Fourzol au début du Ve siècle par l’archevêque Saint Bardanos puis a été transféré à Zahlé par l’archevêque Aphtimos Fadel en 1727. La cathédrale Saydet Al najat (سيدة النجاة) qui fait partie de l’évêché a été construite en 1846. Cette cathédrale a subi des évènements dramatiques : elle est tombée en cendre durant les évènements de 1860 et restaurée à partir de 1861. De plus, une grande explosion toucha l’évêché le 15 septembre 1987 et une partie du bâtiment fut détruite. Cependant, grâce aux efforts de l’archevêque André Haddad qui a survécu par miracle, des travaux de construction et de restauration ont été faites pour l'embellir de nouveau .\n\nTourisme gastronomique\nLe château Ksara\nLe Château Ksara est la plus ancienne cave viticole au Liban qui a été fondée en 1857 regroupant dix vignobles sur 441 hectares dans la vallée de la Békaa. La production annuelle varie entre les différents types de vin mais on peut compter presque 2,5 millions de bouteilles. La cave de Ksara a été trouvée par erreurs en 1898 par les Jésuites, qui étaient à la recherche d'un loup qui mangeait leur poulet.\n\nRestaurants sur le Berdawni\nAppelée la capitale de la gastronomie levantine, la vallée de Berdawni à Zahlé regroupe des cafés et des restaurants très célèbres. Cette appellation revient du début du XXe siècle avec ces casinos de Berdawni qui ont entraîné une vague touristique importante dans la Békaa. C'est un lieu de destination pour tous les touristes arabes et étrangers qui visitent la ville afin de savourer les plats libanais et spécialement Zahléotes et de profiter de la nature qui entoure la vallée. Ces lieux peuvent recevoir un très grand nombre d'invités et offrent une cuisine variée et délicieuse. Sans jamais oublier le dessert de crème glacée arabe, une spécialité des habitants de Zahlé et le parc d'attraction qui comprend des jeux électroniques pour le divertissement des enfants et des pistes de course automobile.\n\nAnciennes maisons\nZahlé conserve jusqu'à aujourd'hui de belles maisons bourgeoises aux tuiles rouges qui appartiennent aux familles Geha, Azar, Skaff, Hindi. La résidence Geha est connue par la grande cour intérieure en arcades entourée par 24 pièces et un long tunnel de 1.4 Km qui relie la propriété à l'église St. Elie.\nL'ancien sérail (qui est aujourd'hui la municipalité de Zahlé) a été construit en 1885 et sa cour intérieure compte de nombreuses arcades. \nLe souk el Blatt est situé dans la partie la plus ancienne de la ville. Ce souk était un lieu d'échange entre les commerçants venant de Syrie, de Palestine et de Bagdad.\n\nTourisme culturel\nLe centre culturel français\nLe centre culturel a été inauguré à Zahlé en 1958 et offre des cours de langue et de perfectionnement en français ainsi que des projections de film, des pièces de théâtre, des spectacles de danse ainsi que des conférences. Le centre compte aussi une bibliothèque permettant de toucher des publics différents.\n\nLes écoles des activités diverses\nLes écoles de danse, de musique et de peinture ne sont pas en reste. Par l’apprentissage du corps et des sens, elles véhiculent le goût artistique, permettent la perpétuation des traditions, ouvrent aux vocations affirmées ou à naître les voies de la scène mondiale, parisienne, londonienne ou new-yorkaise .\n\nLe Grand Hotel Kadri\nLe Grand hôtel Kadri est un exemple de l’architecture traditionnelle en pierre de Zahlé, tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur. Il a longtemps été utilisé par la plupart des fonctionnaires et des dignitaires visitant la ville, comme son plus grand et le plus luxueux hôtel. Les Ottomans l’ont converti en hôpital pendant la Première Guerre mondiale. C'est le lieu ou le Général francais Gouraud a annoncé la création du Grand Liban en 1920. Pendant la guerre civile libanaise, il a été occupé par les troupes syriennes et a subi d’énormes dégâts. Un ambitieux projet de restauration au milieu des années 90 a réhabilité l'édifice. L’hôtel a fermé ses portes en février 2011 en raison d’un conflit entre sa direction et l’Église catholique (son propriétaire effectif depuis 1999) et a rouvert ses portes plus tard en 2013.\n\nLes hôtels à Zahlé\nBeit El Kroum\nAuberge Breidy\nGrand Kadri Hotel\nHotel St Jean\nZahle hills\nLa place hotel\n\nLes caves à Zahlé\nCave de Ksara\nLes Coteaux du Liban\nDomaine des tourelles\nDomaine Wardy\nChateau St Thomas\nChâteau Khoury\nDomaine de Baal\n\nLes écoles à Zahlé\nÀ Zahlé se trouvent des écoles publiques et privées.

Les étés sont chauds et secs, et les hivers frais et plutôt pluvieux, avec d’occasionnelles chutes de neige.\nÀ Zahlé, les étés sont chauds, arides et dégagés et les hivers sont très froids et partiellement nuageux. Au cours de l'année, la température varie généralement de 2 °C à 29 °C et est rarement inférieure à -2 °C ou supérieure à 31 °C\n\nPersonnalités liées à la ville\nPlusieurs auteurs, poètes et chanteurs du monde arabes sont issus de la ville de Zahlé :\n\nNicolas Youakim (poète, musicien, philosophe, écrivain)\nNajwa Karam (chanteuse)\nWael Kfoury (chanteur)\nSaid Akl (poète)\nIssa Iskandar Maalouf (historien)\nFawzi Maalouf (poète)\nMichel Trad (poète)\nNajib Hankash (poète)\nElie Maalouf (pianiste)\nRaji Rahi (écrivain)\nRiad Maalouf (poète)\nJoseph Sayegh (poète)\nKhayr El-Morr (historien)\nElias Habchi (poète)\nHaykal Rahi (écrivain)\nFawzi Kash (peintre)\nSoheil Kash (philosophe)\nGhada Chreim Ata (professeur de littérature française et femme politique)\nKhalil Abou Obeid (musicien, compositeur et professeur de chant)\nElias Hraoui (président de la République libanaise de 1989 à 1998)\nShakira est également originaire de Zahlé, du côté de son père.\n\nRelations internationales\nJumelages\nLa ville de Zahlé est jumelée avec les villes suivantes :\n\n Rosario, Argentine\n Région de la Champagne, France\n Belo Horizonte, Brésil\n\nRéférences\nLiens externes\n\nRessource relative à la musique : MusicBrainz  \n\n Portail du Liban",

          "content": "Batroun (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْرُون al-Batrūn;, ancient Botrys (Ancient Greek: Βότρυς, romanized: Bótrys), is a coastal city in northern Lebanon and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is the capital city of Batroun District.\n\nEtymology\nBatroun appears in Western Aramaic, and is attested in as bṯrwn (Arabic: بثرون) in premodern Arabic texts, with the expected lenition of t for an Aramaic term. Elie Mardini suggests the shift of the th to t in Aramaic terms in the Levant is due to the merger of certain fricatives in Levantine Arabic.\n\nHistory\nBatroun is likely the \"Batruna\" mentioned in the Amarna letters (EA 078, EA 079, EA 081, EA 087, EA 088, EA 090, EA 093, EA 095, EA 124, EA 129), dating to the 14th century B.C. Batroun was mentioned by the ancient geographers Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Stephanus of Byzantium, and Hierocles. Theophanes the Confessor called the city \"Bostrys.\"\nThe Phoenicians founded Batroun on the southern side of the promontory called in classical antiquity Theoprosopon and during the Byzantine Empire, Cape Lithoprosopon. Batroun is said to have been founded by Ithobaal I (Ethbaal), king of Tyre (whose daughter Jezabel married Ahab).\n\nThe city was under Roman rule to Phoenice Province, and later after the region was Christianized became a suffragan of the Patriarch of Antioch.\nIn 551, Batroun was destroyed by an earthquake,  which also caused mudslides and made the Cape Lithoprosopon  crack.  Historians believe that Batroun's large natural harbor was formed during the earthquake.\nThree Greek Orthodox bishops are known to have come from Batroun: Porphyrius in 451, Elias about 512 and Stephen in 553 (Lequien, II, 827). According to a Greek Notitia episcopatuum, the Greek Orthodox See has existed in Batroun since the tenth century when the city was then called Petrounion. After the Muslim conquests of the region, the name was Arabicized to Batroun.\nBatroun was controlled by the Crusaders in 1104, to be known as the Lordship of Botrun as part of the County of Tripoli, until it was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289. One of Batroun's archaeological sites is Mseilha Fort, which is constructed on an isolated massive rock with steep sides protruding in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains.\nUnder Ottoman rule, Batroun was the centre of a kaza in the mutessariflik of Lebanon and the seat of a Maronite diocese, suffragan to the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch. Since 1999, it has been the seat of the Maronite eparchy.\n\nEconomy and urban development\nHistorically, the city of Batroun was settled at the interface between the sea and the national road that connected Beirut to Tripoli.\nLately, the radical shift of the historical functions of the local economic tissue into a leisure service-based economy (nightclubs, bars, restaurants, stores, etc.) has become the unique and only lever of the development of the city. The economic metamorphosis has resulted in the resettlement of housing towards emerging city suburbs (nearby hills: New Batroun, Batroun Hills, Basbina, etc.) consequently to the overvaluation of the real estate market in the city centre. It clearly reveals here the constitution of a business city-centre (dedicated to leisure and business) balanced by the constitution of residential suburbs, where accelerated urban sprawl has led to the destruction of natural lands (pinewood and orange groves) and to the fatal rise in land prices.\n\nTourism\nBatroun is a major tourist destination in North Lebanon. The town boasts historic Maronite and Greek Orthodox churches. The town is also a major beach resort with a vibrant nightlife that includes pubs and nightclubs. Citrus groves surround Batroun, and the town has been famous (from the early 20th century) for its fresh lemonade sold at the cafés and restaurants on its main street. Biking along the Batroun coastline is also a major activity mainly in late summer days.\nIn 2009, the Batroun International Festival was born. It began hosting leading local and international artists. The festival takes place usually in July and/or August of each year in the old harbor area.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 89.69% and Muslims made up 9.80% of registered voters in Batroun. 64.16% of the voters were Maronite Catholics, 16.44% were Greek Orthodox and 7.97% were Sunni Muslims.\nThe people of Batroun are mainly Maronite, Melkite, and Greek Orthodox Christians. Batroun is a titular see in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church.\n\nPolitics\nRecent years have seen municipal and parliamentary elections become a growing factor and interest in Batroun. This is mainly in the context of local and national struggle for power. The current serving Mayor of Batroun is Marcelino El Harek.\n\nLandmarks\nPhoenician Sea Wall\nEl-Bahsa beach\nMakaad El Mir\nMseilha Fort\nSt. Stephan's Cathedral, built in 1896\nHistoric Souk\nNotre Dame de la Mer\n\nSee also\nList of Crusader castles\nList of Lebanese monuments\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBarber, Malcolm (2012).

Le district compte près de 150 000 habitants (aucun recensement officiel).[réf. nécessaire]\n\nToponymie\nBatroun ou Beit Truna renvoie à une expression d'origine cananéenne qui veut dire : « La place », ou « La maison du chef ».\nPar ailleurs, selon certains historiens, Batroun pourrait renvoyer à :\n\nBotrys aux temps des grecs, romains et byzantins ;\nBoutron au temps des croisés (voir Seigneurie de Botron).\n\nHistoire\nCitée dans les lettres de Tell el-Amarna, la ville a été fondée à l'initiative de la ville de Tyr au IIIe millénaire av. J.-C., par le prêtre phénicien Ito-Baal en 814 av. J.-C.\n\nGéographie\nPorte du nord et mitoyenne de la région du mont Liban, la ville de Batroun s'étend en bordure de mer jusqu'aux premiers coteaux à l'est, sur une superficie de 4,68 km2. Le district de Batroun s'élève jusqu'au mont 'Ra's-el-Mounaytara' culminant à 2 700 m.\nLa ville se situe à 54 km au nord de Beyrouth, au bord de la mer Méditerranée, et à 30 km au sud de Tripoli, deuxième ville du pays.\n\nUrbanisme\nLa ville se développa historiquement à l'interface de la route principale qui la traverse du sud au nord, et qui, bien avant la construction plus en amont de l'autoroute littorale dans les années 50-60, reliait Beyrouth à Tripoli, mais elle se développa aussi tout en se déversant vers l'ouest, en s'ouvrant à la mer, le long d'une batterie d'artères secondaires dits 'souks', aujourd'hui patrimoine architectural de la ville, structurant ainsi une morphologie urbaine rappelant celles d'autres villes du littoral libanais, telles que Byblos ou Tyr.[réf. nécessaire]\nCependant avec le développement commercial du centre-ville historique, l'urbanisation des premières hauteurs surplombant la ville fit ainsi connaître à Batroun une nouvelle ère de développement urbain, créant dès lors une 'fonctionnalisation' de son tissu urbain, avec un centre-ville de plus en plus 'spécialisé' et tourné vers les activités de service et de tourisme, et des périphéries (les coteaux à l'Est du fait de la topographie de la ville) assurant presque exclusivement la fonction 'résidente'. Ces urbanisations furent, à l'instar d'autres territoires libanais, difficilement ou mal accompagnées par la puissance publique (étatique ou locale) et sont source de mitage et de pression foncière galopante au détriment des terrains naturels et agricoles (historiquement pinèdes et orangeraies), mais aussi au détriment d'une mixité fonctionnelle et sociale indispensable à la cohésion d'un territoire.\n\nTourisme\nEn complément d'un patrimoine architectural de qualité et de vestiges millénaires phéniciens et romains, l'industrie du tourisme de Batroun a historiquement été portée par les activités développées autour de la mer, telles que la pêche (port et marché aux poissons), les sports nautiques (surf, plongée sous-marine) et les activités de loisirs avec des stations et des établissements hôteliers de qualité. La ville de Batroun est devenue depuis le début des années 2000 une destination nationale phare pour les amateurs de vie nocturne et de clubbing, une activité qui est complétée par une offre hôtelière et de restauration de niveau.\nPar ailleurs depuis 2009, le festival international de Batroun qui se tient entre juillet et août invite sur les planches de la ville les plus grandes stars nationales et internationales.[réf. nécessaire]\nRécemment le Ministère des affaires étrangères libanais a initié un réseau de résidences ouvertes à la diaspora libanaise 'Beyt al-Moughtareb' en investissant d'anciennes demeures traditionnelles libanaises du souk de Batroun tout en s'inscrivant dans un maillage national de résidences, ceci dans une volonté affichée de l'état libanais d'inciter une immense diaspora libanaise autour du monde à venir visiter son pays d'origine.[réf. nécessaire]\nLa limonade est une spécialité traditionnelle de la ville dont elle s'est fait une renommée nationale, notamment grâce à son procédé de fabrication à base de jus de citrons de terroir entiers.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nSites historiques\nle rempart phénicien\nl'amphithéâtre romain taillé à même la roche\nla batterie des seize tombeaux phéniciens\nle vieux souk\nle fort de Mseilha, situé au sortir de la ville (nord-est), sur les rives du fleuve Nahr el-Jaouz.

Ainsi, les chiffres indiqués dans les références sont des estimations effectuées par divers organismes et institutions et sont souvent contradictoires car amalgamant résidents et électeurs.[réf. nécessaire]\nLa population résidente à Batroun est estimée à quelque 30 000 habitants.[réf. nécessaire]\nLa population est chrétienne avec un établissement d'une communauté historique grecque orthodoxe ; cette communauté noyau est restée minoritaire face à une population très fortement maronite (catholique). A noter qu'une petite communauté musulmane relevant de la branche sunnite de l'Islam est historiquement installée à Batroun, malgré un important exode dont elle a été victime pendant la guerre civile libanaise. Enfin une petite communauté arménienne est établie dans la ville.[réf. nécessaire]\nUne importante émigration a touché Batroun depuis la fin du 19e siècle et une grande diaspora est installée notamment en Australie et aux États-Unis.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nSanté\nL'hôpital Dr Emile Bitar de Batroun est une structure publique relevant du Ministère de la santé libanais.\n\nEnseignement\nLa ville de Batroun compte quatre groupes scolaires, dont trois sont privés relevant de l'enseignement catholique.

Bsharri is the location of the Cedars of God, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the only remaining place where the Cedrus libani (Lebanese cedar) tree grows natively. The region is the birthplace of famed poet, painter and sculptor Khalil Gibran; a museum in town honours his life and work.\nAs Bsharri is mountainous and experiences freezing winters, it is home to Lebanon's oldest ski resort, the Cedars Ski Resort, as well as the country's original ski lift, which was built in 1953. The resort is about 130 km (81 mi) from Beirut, approximately two hours' driving time. Qurnat as Sawdā Mountain is the highest peak in the Levant, at 3,088 meters above sea level.\nBsharri is at the head of the Holy Kadisha Valley, a natural area which contains some of the oldest Christian monastic communities in the Middle East. A center of Maronite Christianity, the area also features the largest cathedral in the Levant region, the Saint Saba Cathedral, constructed by Anthony II Peter Arida. As the city is home to nearly 40 churches and houses-of-worship, it is sometimes referred to as \"the city of churches\".\n\nHistory\nThe name Bsharri (بشرّي), Beth Shareer, can be found in the Aramaic language. Bsharri means House of Truth in Aramaic. Maronite Christians fleeing persecution sought refuge in its mountainous terrain in the 7th Century AD.  The Kadisha Valley, below the town, became the spiritual center of the Maronite Church. The town was known as Buissera by the Crusades.\nResidents of Bsharri are known for their distinct accent when they speak Lebanese Arabic. Unlike other parts of Lebanon, Aramaic was spoken in Bsharri as a liturgical language well into the 19th century. As a result, Bsharri natives developed an unmistakably strong accent that lasts to this day.\nDuring the Lebanese civil war, many young men joined the Lebanese Phalanges. In 1986 Samir Geagea, a Bsharri native, became head of the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia (now a political party). Many LF militants were drawn from the town during the civil war.\n\nCulture\nToday, the town is located in a highly touristic zone including many attractions such as the Khalil Gibran Museum, the Kadisha Valley, the Kadisha Grotto, the Cedars of God forest and several ski resorts.\nBsharri is home to a Lebanese Red Cross First Aid Center, also to “The Maronite Scouts” that started their activities in early 2000.\nOn July 13, 2018, International Colombian singer of Lebanese heritage, Shakira, performed in Bsharri during the Cedars International Festival in the presence of 13,000 people. The visit was a part of her 2018 world tour, the El Dorado World Tour.\nOn March 22, 2019, The municipalities of Bsharri, Lebanon, and Val d’Isère, France inked an agreement to promote cultural exchange between the two towns. The cultural exchange program aims to build bridges for French and Lebanese youth that want to experience the unique cultural relationship and similarities the two countries possess. The mayor of Val d’Isère, Marc Bauer, led a French delegation to Lebanon to inaugurate a program aimed at promoting cultural and athletic exchange between the two famous ski locations.\nAndrea Bocelli performed at the opening ceremony of The Cedars International Festival-Bsharri (CIF) before an audience of 8,000 people. Before the festival, Bocelli visited the Cedars of God, where he was received by the head of the Lebanese Forces Party, Samir Geagea.\nBsharri natives are also known for their strong Christian faith. Throughout the year, many religious festivities and commemorations take place in the town, attracting thousands from neighbouring villages.\n\nCedars ski resort\nThe Cedars resort is located in the North of Lebanon. Skiers came to the resort as early as 1920, and have been returning there ever since. The first lift was installed by the government in 1953.\nThe Cedars resort has a slightly longer season than the others, sometimes beginning early November and often lasting until late April. Pisted and off-piste skiing is possible, as well as Nordic skiing and skidoo rides. In summer 2005, The Cedars resort installed three new chairlifts to replace the old T-bars and extend the ski runs. Fifteen million US Dollars have lately been invested to upgrade the facilities and raise the standard of the resort's accommodation, equipment, safety and services.\nAn ongoing project envisages a gondola that would carry skiers and visitors from the parking level at 2,095 metres (6,873 ft) to the highest accessible summit of 2,870 metres (9,420 ft). There is no indication yet of when and whether this will be finalized. To comply with international regulations, a refuge with a capacity of 400 persons also needs be built at the top of the gondola, and equipped with telescopes allowing vistas as far away as the island of Cyprus.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nBsharri has a continental Mediterranean climate (Csb/Dsb, according to the Köppen climate classification), with dry and mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Temperatures in the summer can go above 30 °C (86 °F) a few times per year. On the other hand, temperatures can fall occasionally to −15 °C (5 °F) and on Bsharri mountain to −30 °C (−22 °F) during the winter. Heavy snowfall is observed every year and accumulations of over 2 m (80 in) and on  Bsharri mountain of 7 m (280 in) are not unheard of.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 99.41% of registered voters in Bsharri. 94.52% of the voters were Maronite Catholics.\n\nGallery\nNotable residents\nKhalil Gibran (1883-1931), writer, poet and visual artist\nAntoine Choueiri (1939-2010), media executive\nSamir Geagea (born 1952), head of the Lebanese Forces party\n\nSee also\nDimane\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLebanese Embassy (US) Section on Bsharri\nWorld66",

          "content": "The Palm Islands Nature Reserve  consists of three flat, rocky islands of eroded limestone and the surrounding sea area, located 5.5 kilometres (3.4 mi) offshore and northwest of the city of El Mina, Lebanon, to the west of Tripoli, Lebanon.\nThe overall area of the reserve is 4.2 square kilometres (1.6 sq mi), it has been designated as a Mediterranean Specially Protected Area under the 1995 Barcelona Convention. The islands were also identified as a Ramsar Wetland of Special International Importance in 1980, and have been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. The islands are a haven for endangered green turtles (Chelona mydas), rare monk seals and a resting and nesting grounds for migratory birds.\n\nIslands\nThe largest of the three islands is Palm Island (Arabic: جزيرة النخيل Jazeerat an-Nakheel) also known as Rabbits Island (Arabic: جزيرة الأرانب Jazeerat al-Araneb). The name 'Araneb' (rabbits) comes from the great numbers of rabbits that were raised on the island during the time of the French mandate early in the 20th century.\nPalm Island is characterized by its flat terrain and has no obvious reliefs, it covers an area of 180,796 square metres (1,946,070 sq ft). The island's highest point is at 6 metres (20 ft) above sea level. It's rocky shoreline extends from the northwest to south while its sandy beaches lay at the northern and eastern faces. The middle of the island is earthen, it contains evidence of past periods of human occupation such as a fresh water well, an old salt evaporation pond and the remains of a Crusader church. The island underwent rehabilitation works which included restoration of the well, its water is used to irrigate the island's 570 palm trees. The authorities also constructed a boat dock and walking trails and demarcated the island's areas of recreation and research.\nSanani Island (Arabic: جزيرة السناني Jazeerat as-Sanani) covers an area of 45,503 square metres (489,790 sq ft) south east of Palm Island. It is mainly rocky with a partially sandy shore.\nRamkine Island (Arabic: جزيرة رمكين Jazeerat Ramkine) also known as Fanar Island (Arabic: جزيرة الفنار Jazeerat al-Fanar) is the smallest of the islands with an area of 34,903 square metres (375,690 sq ft); it is located north west of Palm Island.  Ramkine island is mostly rocky and rises to about 12 meters above sea level. The island contains the remains of a lighthouse in addition to cannon emplacements and underground galleries that were built in the early 20th century. A solar powered navigation light has now been installed in the tower of the old lighthouse.\n\nThe islands are public property, they were declared protected area by law on March 9, 1992.\n\nHistory\nThe islands hosted an important settlement as attested by the presence of numerous ostraca dating to the late Roman and medieval periods as well as several rock-cut cisterns. The first excavation of Palm Island was undertaken in October 1973 and revealed the foundations of several buildings dating to the Crusades in which earlier architectural elements, such as column drums and fragments of capitals had been re-used.\nAmong the medieval sources that make mention of the offshore isles of Tripoli is the Arab geographer Idrisi who visited the city during the twelfth century at the time when it was ruled by Raymond III; Idrisi wrote:\n\nOpposite the city of Tripoli are four islands in a row. The first of them,\nand nearest to the land, is the Narcissus Isle (an -Narjis); it is very small and\nis unoccupied. Then comes the Isle of the Column (al-tantid), then Monk’s Isle\n(ArRahib), and then the Isle of Ardhakun (or Udhákun). \nThe Crusaders built a church upon the largest island. It was there that Alice of Champagne, the widow of Hugh I of Cyprus came in 1224 to marry Bohemond V of Antioch. The royal wedding took place in this church which we are told by Arab chroniclers was dedicated to Thomas the Apostle. Years later the island became the scene of a bloody massacre; when the Mamelukes entered Tripoli in 1289 the panic-stricken inhabitants fled to the port and crossed over to the island. Many took refuge in the church where they were put to death when the Mamelukes caught up with them.  The island was afterwards abandoned for many years.\nAt present the Palm Islands are managed and monitored daily by the Mina City Environment Protection Committee and its team with two rangers keeping intruders at bay. The islands were first open to the public in 1999. The islands are only open to the public between July and September though they may be closed during this period if environmental work or studies are being undertaken. Ferries, operated by local fishermen, assure the transport of visitors from the Mina ports to the Islands.\n\nGeology and pedology\nThere are two theories regarding the geological origins of the islands bedrock, the rocky basement of the islands is mainly horizontally bedded marine limestone, it was interpreted as Miocene deposits. However, since no tectonic features are visible in the limestone to distinguish it from the Miocene limestone of the Lebanese mainland, with the lack of fossil evidence, and with its regular sedimentation, this limestone could be interpreted to be more likely from the Plio-Quaternary age.\nGeomorphologically, marine and emerged aerial erosion give the limestone its typical karstic features. Open gutters can be seen, wide and open in the case of marine erosion, narrower in higher places due to aerial and marine erosion. All around the islands there are bare rocky exposures as a result of marine erosion in the form of dissolution and physical action of the waves.\nDuring the winter diaclases and pools within the dunes fill with fresh water which remains available even in the summer.\nThe sandy shore and dunes of two of the islands are of a biological origin. It is mostly constituted by the skeletons of marine foraminifera, resulting in very light sand mixed with fragments of gastropod shells and parts of skeletons and spines of echinoderms. Sand dunes form the higher parts of Palm Island and are the location of evidence of human occupation.\nOrthent, is found on the rocky parts of the islands; this exceedingly shallow soil hosts ephemeral flora that grows during the wet seasons and when fresh water accumulate in the rocky crevasses. Soils with more horizon development are found in the western parts of Palm Island, it is mainly formed by aeolian and beach deposited calcareous sand.\n\nThreats\nThe 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah during which there was a large oil spill caused by the Israeli bombing of the Lebanese Jiyyeh power plant disturbed the fragile ecosystem of the reserve. Oil coated the islands shores killing microorganism and algae which are crucial food source for marine life and sea turtles. Oil also spread across the surface of the water, presenting a danger to both turtles and migrating birds. Large quantities of oil, sunk down to the sea bed endangering aquatic life. A clean-up and monitoring program undertaken by the World Conservation Union mission to Lebanon aimed to minimize the damage to the Palm islands.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "title": "Tannourine",
          "content": "Tannourine (Arabic: تنورين, also Tannoureen, Tannorine) is a Lebanese town located in the Batroun District, part of the Governorate of North Lebanon, 80 km from the capital Beirut. Tannourine is formed by a cluster of mountain settlements located in the highs of the Batroun District, the largest of which is Tannourine El-Fawqa, followed by Chatine,Tannourine El-Tahta, and Wata Houb. Tannourine has a population of approximately 25,000.\nTannourine extends between the municipal borders of Douma and Yammoune, and between Aqoura to the south and Bsharri and Hadath El Jebbeh to the north. The town is close to the Kadisha Valley and Cedars of God UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Afqa grotto, the Baatara sinkhole, and the Nahr Ibrahim valley.\nTannourine lies in a collection of valleys and ravines accessible either from Douma, Kfour Al Arbe, a backroad from Bsharri or from a newly constructed highway direct from Batroun, or from Laqlouq.\n\nEtymology\nTannourine is the plural of the Syriac word tannour, which indicates an old stone oven. Tannourine's name may in fact stem from the local topography, which resembles the convex form of an oven called tannour, with the dual suffix ine as a reference to the two distinct areas of Tannourine Al-Tahta (literally Lower Tannourine) and Tannourine Al-Fawqa (literally Upper Tannourine).\n\nClimate\nTannourine Cedar Reserve\nThe village also shares its name with Tannourine Cedar Forest Nature Reserve, a cedar forest of some 1,000,000 trees. Covering an area of 195.5 hectares at an altitude ranging between 1,300 and 1,800 meters. The Tannourine Cedars Forest Nature Reserve is considered the largest and densest cedar forests in Lebanon, with ninety percent of the trees in the forest being cedar trees. Other companion trees like Cupressus, Pinus, Abies, Populus and others constitute a very rich ecosystem in planter species. The fauna ranges from the various types of birds (eagles, owls, robins, etc...) to wild animals (hyenas, boars, squirrels, snakes and bats).\nThe reserve includes cliffs and caves, and its mountainous landscape is astonishing with cedars growing on extremely vertical slopes. These cedars can be seen along the road that goes north to Hadath al-Jebbeh, which, although in poor condition, winds its way through wild and isolated scenery up to the Kadisha Valley gorge, leading to Bsharri.\nDuring the Lebanese war (1975-1990) land mines were spread in some parts of the forest, making it mostly inaccessible by the local communities and their herds. This ended-up protecting the forest: it was left relatively un-touched until a law dated 20/2/1999 established it as a protected area. The Lebanese Army cleared the forest of land mines. The reserve is now open to the public and hosts \"Tannourine Cedars Night\" an annual summer music festival.\n\nVillages and local attractions\nThe Village of Balaa (bordering Laqlouq) is known for its deep natural sink hole. A 300-meter walk brings you to a dizzying open cavern some 250 meters deep. Three natural bridges - of which the middle one is the most spectacular - complete the scene. In the spring, snow melt water forms the scenic 90m high Baatara gorge waterfall.\nThe Nahr-Al-Joze (the Joze being a species of trout that grows in the valley river) meanders through the valley and borders a number of restaurants, and creates a forest ecosystem higher up towards the source. Likewise, the river has formed a number of natural pools of clear water that can be explored higher up towards the source.\nTannourine is well known for its ancient Maronite monasteries; specifically the convents of Saint Shallitah and Saint Antonios Houb, the latter being located in the village of Wata Houb.\nAlso, among the rocky outcrops of Tannourine al-Tahta is located an ancient 500-year-old Lebanese house, believed to be one of the earliest examples of Lebanese architecture. That same house was on the cover of a National Geographic report on Lebanon. Until late 2008, the occupant of the house was the oldest living man in Lebanon. Dubbed \"Massoud\", he was reputed to be 109 years old.\n\nChurches and monasteries\nIn the late fifth century AD, Tannourine became a refuge for the Maronites. Some of the churches and monasteries include:\n\nSaint Chalitta Church - an archeological site from the Crusader period.\nSaint Sarkis Church - a Byzantine archaeological site. It had three markets and the vestibule was paved with a mosaic. It was constructed near the new church.\nThe Church of the Assumption of Mary\nSaint Antonio monastery in Houb was built in 1749.\nSaint Peter church\nSaint Georges church\n\nArchaeological sites\nTannourine hosts a remarkably large number of monuments dating back to the Phoenician, Roman and Greek eras.\nIn the valley of Tannourine-Al-Tahta lies a nearly-intact Roman aqueduct and a decrepit reservoir and Roman Cistern at its side. It is a testament that the fertility of that valley was being exploited since at least the 1st century AD\nHigher up in the mountains, in the now abandoned village of Ain al-Raha, are found a number of 6th century and Crusader-era churches that many scholars believe to be one of the earliest known proofs of the presence of Christianity in the upper Levant. Indeed, according to the legend, Ain al-Raha (literally: source of relief) was during the 11th to 13th century a safe haven for defeated Crusaders.\nAlso, above the previously mentioned old Lebanese house is an abandoned monastery sheltered in the hollow cave on the face of the mountain. It is believed that the 16th century remains were constructed in a way that it melded into the mountain to create a \"camouflage\" of sorts; and indeed unless you intend to search for it, you'd be hard-pressed to locate it immediately. Such caution was employed in order to thwart Ottoman army which wished to seize the Levant, which they eventually succeeded in doing.\nIn Wata Houb there are inscriptions on a rock dating back to the eighth century BC, the statues of a huge man between two smaller ones.\nIn St. Anthony's monastery in Houb, the remains of a Phoenician temple are preserved. In 1936 the remains of a structure with an elaborate stone sculpture were found and a large font was used to save the blood of the victims. This is all in the middle of a paved opening with stone seats around. It was also found among the rubble, icons inscribed with the name of Alexander the Great and drawings of the god, Jupiter, carrying a lightning symbol in his right hand and a scepter in his left. The other read, \"Iskandar, the King and the God and the compassionate father\" in addition to the drawings of an eagle and the heads of a man and a woman with the words \" the 2 Gods are brothers.\" There are also writings glorifying the Roman Emperor Hadrian and other writings cautioning from cutting certain types of trees; in addition to pools, restrooms, and forts built to protect convoys from nomadic invasions. In Tannourine, there is today a Roman wall which marks the boundary between Tannourine and Aqoura.\nThe Romans also built an observatory called Aytamout observatory, which was overlooking the neighboring areas to address those who come to cut the trees. The Greek monuments included icons of the goddess Isis, the goddess and protector of navigation. She has two horns and she is carrying in her hand an Ankh with Greek letters of \"Byblos\".\n\nHistory\nTannourine was inhabited since the Phoenician and Roman times. However, there is no conclusive evidence that it was a continuous presence or a discontinued one. Nor is there any evidence to prove whether this presence left an impact biologically and genetically on other people who came later to Tannourine. Based on the manuscript from the 17th century of Father Peter Matar in 1650 and the manuscript from the late 16th century of Father Al Maadi in 1599, several families lived in Tannourine in the thirteenth century, before the Mamluks attack on Mount Lebanon. The most prominent of these families are Matar (مطر ), Ghoch (غوش), Chamoun (شمعون), Harik (حريق), Sadka (صدقه) and Laya (لايا), Chaiban (شيبان). \nBetween 1268 and 1306 the Mamluks attacked Mount Lebanon in a \"discipline\" campaign in the region. Many of these families dispersed, some of which were killed, and others emigrated and some hid in the many caves in the area of Tannourine.\nThe families that did not become extinct at that stage are Ghoch, Matar and Reaidy (Reaidy family is a branch from Al Matar family), as many of their descendants are still in Tannourine region.\nAs for the rest of the families that are currently stationed in Tannourine, most of them are the descendant of Gerges Abi Korkmaz the third, the actual Grandfather of more than 60% of the current people of tannourine.\nAl Korkmaz main families are: Harb, Youness, Tarabay, Dagher, Yaacoub. It is worth mentioning that these families have branched into several families and names which are too many to state.↵\nFor the true origins of the Korkmaz the first, there are many stories. Some historians consider him from Slavic ethnic origins, Albanians. Turkish, or Baghdadian origins and that he was called khattar, and khattar means in the Arabic language, the \"Spear holder\". Also, Korkmaz means in the Turkish language \"Fearless\"↵.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, many citizens of Tannourine travelled to Brazil fleeing the war, many were sent to the city of Araçuai - MG, where they received the last name Tanure, Tanuri, Tanury, Tannure, Tannouri and Tannoury.\nTannourine includes many families who came from several Lebanese villages and towns, such as:\n-Bkassini from Bkassine\n-Mrad from Kfar Selouan\n-Al Chaer\n-Koumeir, Bou Abdo and Hashem from Aqoura\n-Karam and El Hasrouni from Hasroun\n-Rashed and Makhlouf from Tartej\n-Faddoul from Bsharri\n-Akiki from Keserwan\n-Abi Khalil from Ain Ksour\n\nEconomy\nTannourine is the site of Tannourine Natural Spring Mineral Water.\n\nGovernment and demographics\nThe newly constructed Tannourine Municipality building is located in Tannourine-Al-Fawqa, overlooking the town previously mentioned.

          "content": "Ehden (Arabic: إِهْدِن, Syriac-Aramaic:ܐܗܕ ܢ) is a mountainous city in the heart of the northern mountains of Lebanon and on the southwestern slopes of Mount Makmal in the Mount Lebanon Range. Its residents are the people of Zgharta, as it is within the Zgharta District.\n\nGeography\nThe mountain town is located 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) above sea level, and is 30.8 kilometres (19.1 mi) from Zgharta, 110 kilometres (68 mi) from Beirut (the country’s capital) and 39 kilometres (24 mi) from Tripoli, Lebanon.\nEhden is a famous summer resort and touristic center, often called \"The Bride of Summer Resorts in the North of Lebanon.\"\nGastronomy is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Ehden, especially in summer. Kebbeh meshwyeh (krass) and the kebbeh nayyeh, both traditional dishes, and particularly notable in this town.\n\nEtymology\nEhden is derived from Aramaic, meaning \"the mountain’s base and slope\". The location of Ehden at the base of Mar Sarkis Mountain supports this explanation. This view is supported by Anis Freiha who writes:The name of Ehden comes from Adon, Adonis meaning \"power, stability and tranquillity\". It is corroborated by the Arabic root Hdn meaning \"steadiness, calm and fertility\". Adon means also \"the base and the mountaintop\" translating into \"top of the mountain and its base\".\nPatriarch Estephan El Douaihy, along with Father Martens the Jesuit, lean toward the conclusion that Ehden’s name is derived from Eden where Adam and Eve lived following their exit from paradise. Douaihy left a booklet in Latin regarding his point of view. It is kept in the Vatican Library. Orientalists Hawiet, Rose Goaler and Orkwart supported Douaihy and Martens’ viewpoint. It was contested by Ernest Renan in his book Mission en Phenicie and by Father Henri Lammens.\n\nLocation, climate and nature\nEhden is located in the central northern side of Mount Lebanon, with a 1500-metre (at Midan square) elevation from sea level. It is 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Beirut, 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Tripoli and 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Zgharta. Ehden used to be the sole residence for Zghartians prior to the establishment of Zgharta. It is known for its dry climate, water and forest. It is a renowned summer location, famous for its setting on the Mar Sarkis (Saint Sarkis) Mountain overlooking coastal towns and villages as far as Akkar to Shikka. A large number of local and overseas tourists visit Ehden annually.\n\nHistory\nEhden’s history dates back into the BC period. Its indigenous people transformed rocky hills into land suitable for crops, irrigated by water from mountain streams.  The people of Ehden have contributed to the fields of thought, literature, patriotism, and religion in Lebanon.\nEhden was the original homeland for Zghartians who later established Zgharta on the Lebanese coast in the 16th century. It was/is a warmer winter season home below the mountains' snow. Four centuries later it has become primarily a summer resort.\nDespite the changes that have taken place over the centuries, Ehden's people have maintained their strong ties to their cultural heritage and history. The town continues to be a vibrant hub of creativity, thought, and spirituality, making it an important destination for anyone interested in Lebanon's rich cultural heritage.\n\nBC Ehden\nSome early texts mention that the people of Ehden are descendants of the tribe of Shem, the son of Noah.\n- 850 BC: the Aramean king Hadadezer came to Ehden and rebuilt it, hoisting a statue of its god known then as “Baal Loubnan” or “The god of snow”\n- 700 BC: Sennacherib, the Assyrian king through his leading assistant Rabshakeh, occupied Ehden and destroyed it by setting it alight and overturning its statue.\n- 300 BC: Seleucus I, leader of an army that was a part of Alexander the Great's Macedonian army, rebuilt Ehden. Seleucus I also built a large pagan temple on the eastern side where he erected a statue of the Sun-god Helios.\n- 64 BC: Pompey blockaded Ehden. He conquered and destroyed it.\n\nAD Ehden\nAn Ancient Greek inscription was found on the exterior of Mar Mama church with the equivalent date 282 AD and also Greek numerals near the church.\nAlso a Syriac inscription was found which has been translated as saying “In the name of God who is capable of resurrecting the dead. In the year one of Alexander … Marcos had lived and died.”\nAt the end of the 6th century Ehdenians converted to Christianity. Maronite priests of Saint Maroun and St. Simeon Stylites helped convert them into Maronites. They built five churches all at once on top of the ruined idolatrous temple, using its stones for building Mar Mama, Mar Boutros, Mar Youhana, Mar Ghaleb and Mar Istfan. In addition, they raised huge stone crosses on top of the mountain.\nA brief account of Ehden's history has been found written by one of its inhabitants who fled from the Mamluk invasion in 1283, tying the manuscript to his chest for safekeeping.\n\nManuscript\nFather George Yammine found the manuscript, which was written on an old piece of leather, at the start of the 19th century in a priest's home in Bsharri. He copied it and, following his death, his son Sheikh Roumanos Yammine kept it. It was then passed onto Monsignor Hanna Dib Saydet. In 1930, Historian Semaan el Khazan discovered a copy of that document with another historian, Father Youhana Maroun Farah el Seb'ali, who had copied it from Monsignor Saade in 1904. It says:\n\n\"Ehden is a very old village located in the north of Mount Lebanon. It used to be known as 'Patchilassar' a Persian pronunciation meaning 'the paradise of the area'. It is enriched with fresh water, trees and a breathtaking water stream called Mar Sarkis bursts off its eastern mountain. A tribe related to Sam, son of Noah settled in Ehden, which later became a famous site.\"\nIn 1264 the people of Ehden supported the Crusades in their battle for the town of Tripoli.\nIn 1283 the army of the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun invaded Mount Lebanon and burnt Ehden.\nIn 1586, Ehden was burnt again according to a found manuscript but it does not mention by whom, all it says that \"Ehden was burnt in the year 1897 of the Greek calendar\" which means the year 1586 AD.\nIn 1610 the first printing press in the Middle East was set up St Anthony of Khozaya Abbey near Ehden. Early publishing was mostly of religious works in Syriac (Karchouni) characters. The printing press is still on display there.\n\nEhden's ancient ruins\nEhden used to be a significant site for idolatrous beliefs where numerous temples and enormous statues were located such as “Baal Loubnan”, “god of snow” and “god of the sun”.\nDue to major destruction that engulfed Ehden throughout its history, most of those statues and temples were destroyed. Huge rocks that have remained scattered on mountaintops, as well as large stones used in building some of its churches, still leave indication of that era.\nFather La Monse the Jesuit stated that there are three scriptures in Mar Mama church, two are written in Greek and another in Syriac.\nThe Greek writing is sited on its exterior garden wall where most of it has been erased through the passing of time. Two lines are still visible in the lower section. A date is also visible of the Alexander year 584, which is equivalent to 282 AD. The second writing is in the shape of Greek numbers written on a gravesite next to the church, but could hardly be recognized. As for the Syriac writing, “Rinan” translated the remainder of its meaning in his book titled “Phoenician Mission” as follows:\n\n“In the name of God who is capable of resurrecting the dead. In the year one of Alexander …. Marcos had lived and died.”\nThere is also a historical writing, which was transferred to France and is preserved in its Paris museum in the Orient section, numbered 4524 and dated 272 AD.\nDr. Philip Hitti in his book Lebanon in History affirms that “Ruins dating back to the era of the Roman Empire are widely spread over the mountains. Statues carved on rocks, in addition to Greek and Roman sculptures, graves, temple ruins and buried columns were found in branched and distant villages like Chouslan, Kartaba, Akoura, Tanourin and Ehden.”\nEhden’s most famous Christian site is “Dayr al-Salib” (Convent of the Cross), which is a symbol of an era of transformation for Ehdenians who had turned away from idolatry and converted to Christianity, according to a historical document written by Father Kozma. This convent is situated between Ehden and Bkoufa in the versant of Mar Sarkis’ mountain. It is a large grotto containing an altar and was identified by large stones forming a cross that was placed on top of its entrance, but vanished in 1935. Nevertheless, Al-Semaani wrote in his book The Eastern Library that he witnessed those cross-engraved stones in Hassroun, Bsharri, Ehden and Aytou.\nMar Mama church, which was built in 748, is considered as one of the oldest Maronite churches in Lebanon. Father La Monse described it as “an eighth-century church built over a destroyed Byzantine church (sixth century) which was in turn built over an old Canaanite temple.” Mar Youhana church was built in 779 but was ruined. Some of its huge stones were still around until the start of the 20th century. Two churches belonging to Mar Sarkis convent were built, the first in the 8th century and the other in the 12th.\nNames of some areas hold a historical meaning such as “Al-Baoul area” named after (Baal the God), “Bab al-Bowayb” meaning (The Door of Doors) for it leads to the kingdom of “Afka” in Ehden’s forest. Afka is the first holy city in history according to Father Dr. Youssef Yammine al-Ehdeni who is trying to prove this theory by embarking on historical research he has not as yet completed.\n\nPresent day\nNowadays the people reside in their Ehden homes during the summer months for cooler days and in their Zgharta homes for warmer winters. A popular saying  based on this moving between homes is “We cross ourselves and then move down and we celebrate and then move up.” This annual migration coincides with the Raising of the Cross Day, 15 September, and around Easter time.\nEhden is a beautiful city renowned for its healthy environment, moderate dry climate and natural fresh water. It is one of the main summer locations of Lebanon.\nVisitors reach Ehden travelling from Beirut through Tripoli, Zgharta, Arjes then Ehden, or from Beirut through Seika, Al-Koura, Seraal, then Ehden, or from Beirut through Baalbak, Al-Arz-Becharri, Kfersghab, then Ehden. There are many restaurants in Ehden. Most restaurants are located near Mar Sarkis water stream, Al-Dawalib, Horsh Ehden and Al-Middan. Al-Middan is well known for its cafés, sweet shops and entertainment. Annual folkloric festivals are held on Al-Middan. Many tourists and visitors who attend Al-Middan ultimately visit Mar Gerges Cathedral, the coffin of Youssef Bey Karam and his statue on “Al-Ketla”, and the statue of Al-Sahyouni and Sheikh Asaad Boulos Gravesite.\nMany cafés can be found in “Al-Moghtaribin” (Immigrants) Street and “Al-Mattal” area, creating an atmosphere of celebration lasting all over Ehden summer attracting tourists and visitors from Lebanon and the world.\nConcerts featuring stars of Lebanese and Arab singing are held almost nightly. First-class hotels and resorts are available for tourists. In addition to modern motels, bars and clubs.\nEhden has experienced a building boom in recent times extending beyond its traditional precincts where modern villas and apartments were built. New roads have been developed and old ones were widened to cope with increasing traffic.\nConvenience and tourism services for comfortable living are widely available in Ehden. There are various shopping centres, speciality shops, health services provided in a public hospital operating throughout the year, plus medical surgeries, chemists, official centres, post and phone centre, summer schools.\nEhden is a site for art events such as hosting cultural and art galleries, stage theatre, open air plays, lectures and forums held by Zghartians and Lebanese thinkers and intellectuals.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe early churches\nThe earliest churches in Ehden are those built over the  site of a pagan temple.\nA large pagan temple was built by Seleucus a commander in Alexander the Great’s army and raised a statue of \"The god of Sun\" nearby. The temple and statue were destroyed in 60 BC by the Roman Commander Pompey. Following their conversion to Christianity the people of Ehden built from the stones of the destroyed temple five churches over the temple precincts as a symbol of Christianity’s victory over paganism.\nThe churches from North to South are:\n\nSt Peter's.\nSt John’s. The church no longer exists but was located near the statue of Patriarch Stephane Doueihi.\nSt Ghaleb's. Originally called St Zakhia's meaning in Syriac \"Victor\". This church was near the corner above St Mama's. The building no longer exists.\nMar Mama church. The oldest Maronite church in Lebanon.\nSt Estephan's. Named after the first Christian martyr. This church, which no longer exists, was located a few metres where the present Mar Mama church stands.\nThe area surrounding St Peter's church was originally the large public square of the pagan temple where the ancient Ehdenians used to meet during feasts and religious ceremonies. They used to sacrifice their eldest sons to their then pagan god for the wellbeing of their families and people. Of course, this was forbidden by God's word: Lev. 18:21 says, \"Neither shall you give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord.\"  (See also Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; 2 Kings. 23:10; Jer. 32:35). The blood of those sacrificed used to accumulate in the temple square and then streamed through a stone canal to where the five churches were built. There was a well, which collected the blood near where St Ghaleb’s  church stood.\n\nChurches today\nThere are 23 places of Christian worship in Ehden, including churches, monasteries, convents and shrines, such as:\nCathedrals\n\nCathedral of Saint George\nChurches\n\nChurch of Our Lady of Al-Hara\nChurch of Our Lady of Jou’it\nChurch of Our Lady of the Fort, built over the remains of a Crusader castle at the highest point of Ehden\nChurch of Saint Abda\nChurch of Saint Anthony\nChurch of Saint Stephen\nChurch of Saint Ghaleb\nChurch of Saint George\nChurch of Saint John\nChurch of Saint Mary and Saint Ibhay the Syriac\nChurch of Saint Mamas Church, which was built in 749 A.D. and is one of the oldest Maronite churches in Lebanon;\nChurch of Saint Michael\nChurch of Saint Simon\nChurch of Saint Charbel inaugurated in 2023, it is the newest and biggest church in Ehden, located at the town's entrance.\nConvents\n\nConvent of Saint Cyprianus\nConvent of Saint Jacob\nConvent of Saint Moura hus\nConvent of Saint Paul\nMonastery of Mar Sarkis, Ras Al Nahr, Ehden\nConvent of the Holy Cross\n\nEnvironment\nThe town is also home to the Ehden Forest, with a variety of trees, plants, flowers, and rare animals. The forest was declared a protected nature reserve by the Lebanese government in 1992.\nEhden’s forest is on the northeast side of Ehden and is an area of 3000 hectares, with a 1300- to 2000-metre elevation from sea level. The approximate elevation is 1893 metres at Al-Jafieh, 1550 metres at Ayn Naasah and 1440 metres at Ayn al-Baq valley. The forest embraces a vital natural forestry reserve with a variety of 40 different types of native plants such as cedars, fir, pine, elm and many others. In addition, 400 different distinctive plants have been identified, of which 66 grow only in Lebanon, and 11 are endemic to Ehden.\nSome of Ehden’s distinctive plants are:\n\nStripirtps libanotica, discovered by botanist and scientist La Plader in 1758\nDianthus karami,  discovered in 1870 by botanist Le Blanche who named it in honour of Youssef Bey Karam.\n“Flower of Ehden’s forest” (Zahret Horsh Ehden)\nCotsina libanotica, a thorny plant.\n“The tooth of the Lebanese tiger” (Sin al-Asad al-Loubnani)\nDistinctive trees include:\n\nWild apple trees\n“Al-Derdar”, an elm tree with only four trees of its type left in Lebanon.\nAbies cilicica: Ehden’s forest is the southernmost site for this fir, as noted in the World Natural Plantation demographic maps.\n\nSee also\nZgharta\nEhden massacre\nYoussef Bey Karam\nYoussef Salim Karam\nSalim Bey Karam\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nEhden On Google Maps Street View By Paul Saad\nEhden Zgharta Parish\nYoussef Bey Karam Foundation Archived 2014-02-12 at the Wayback Machine\nEhden Family Tree",

          "content": "Zgharta (Arabic: زغرتا, Classical Syriac: ܙܓܪܬܐ), also spelled Zghorta, is a city in North Lebanon, with an estimated population of around 50,000. It is the second biggest city in Northern Lebanon after Tripoli. Zgharta is officially the Zgharta-Ehden municipality.\nZgharta is about 150 metres above sea level and lies between the rivers of Jouit and Rashein. It is 23 kilometres from Ehden, 11 kilometres from the coastal city of Tripoli, 88.7 kilometres from the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, and 82 kilometres from the nearest Syrian city, Tartous. Its history and people are closely associated with the village of Ehden, a summer resort and touristic center. Most of the citizens of Zgharta have summer houses in Ehden.\nIt is the seat and the capital of the Zgharta District (Qadaa' Zgharta). Zgharta is closely related to the mountain town of Ehden, essentially sharing the same population. Each summer, most of the people in Zgharta move to spend their summer in Ehden; this is reversed in winter when Ehden is practically deserted.\nZgharta had two Presidents of Lebanon: Suleiman Frangieh and René Moawad, and many prominent politicians: Youssef Salim Karam, Hamid Frangieh, historian Jawad Boulos Makary, Semaan El Douaihy, Suleiman Frangieh Jr, Nayla Moawad, Estephan El Douaihy (ex-MP), Salim Bey Karam, Tony Frangieh (current MP), Jawad Boulos, Michel Moawad (current MP) and Youssef Bahha El Douaihy. Ehden also produced at least four patriarchs of the Maronite Church – Gregorios Of Ehden, David Of Ehden, Jeremiah of Amshit (1199-1230), Youhanna Makhlouf (1609-1633), George Omaira (1634-1644), Estephan El Douaihy (1670-1704) – and an Ottoman era nationalist leader Youssef Bey Karam who led a rebellion against Turkish rule. Political power in Zgharta district is dominated by a few rival families from the town: the Karam, Frangieh, Douaihy, Moawad and Makary.\nTraditionally, agriculture was a large portion of the local economy, with olives grown for olive-oil around Zgharta and apple orchards around Ehden. Recently, the service (especially tourism and leisure) and manufacturing sectors have seen significant growth.\n\nEtymology\nVarious explanations have been given as to the meaning of Zgharta. The majority are of the opinion that it relates to meanings relating to fortresses, citadels, barricades and the like. One writer has suggested that it derived from the Aramaic word \"zaghar\" meaning fortress.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe Plain of Zgharta around Zgharta was likely inhabited from at least the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution by the Qaraoun culture as evidenced by some large, heavy Neolithic flints and double-headed axes found in the area that are documented by R. Wetzel and J. Haller in 1945.\nThere is some evidence that the area of Zgharta was later inhabited in 200 BC and that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries there were already fortifications. Its present-day existence and its close association with the village of Ehden began in the 16th century.\n\nThe founding of modern Zgharta\nThe story of that beginning is recorded in a manuscript in the Syriac language, which belonged to Romanos Afandi Yammine, son of Father George Yammine, and is now held by his grandson Youssef Boutros Romanos Yammine. It describes how people of Ehden had acquired \"the farmland of Zgharta\":\nOn the eve of the 24th of January 1515, Al-Ghazali, the governor of Damascus, along with Sinan Pasha, the minister of Sultan Selim I, had reached Ehden travelling along the route of Damascus-Bekaa Valley-Dahr al-Kadib-the cedars. They were transporting funds to Sultan Salim I who was in Egypt. They were welcomed as guests by Sheikh Iskandar, whilst other members of their travelling entourage were guests of the people of Ehden. Heavy snowfall and extremely freezing conditions that lasted two full days prompted them to stay five days in Ehden where Sheikh Iskandar and Bishop Keryakos Douaihy, the local bishop, provided for their guests great hospitality, generosity and kindness. Responding to a request by their guests, the people of Ehden endeavoured to clear the heavy snow off the road as far as Hayrouna Valley overlooking the coast, accompanying their guests to safety where they made their farewells to them with fitting accolades.\nIn April 1516, Bishop El Douaihy and Sheikh Iskandar received a letter from Al-Ghazali, saying on being told by his minister, Sinan Pasha of their and peoples hospitality and assistance, Sultan Salim I asked that he rewarded them which he promised the Sultan he would. On his return to Damascus, Al-Ghazali invited the people of Ehden to meet him in Tripoli.  At the request of Sheikh Iskander he agreed to provide the people with a place to live away from the harsh winter conditions, which they faced in Ehden. Al-Ghazali readily agreed to this request. Accompanied by his officials, Sheikh Iskandar went with Bishop El Douaihy to choose a suitable place in the Al-Zawiyi region. They chose a derelict farm, containing a few demolished houses and a tower in the middle, situated between the rivers Joueit and Rashein. Al-Ghazali, on the return of his officials with the measurements of the site, promised to obtain a \"Shahani firman\" (decree) from Sultan Salim whereby ownership of the land would pass to the people of Ehden.\nSome eight months later, in 1517, the \"Shahani firman\" was granted, but it was addressed to Sheikh Iskandar. Having collected the firman in Damascus and returning to Ehden the people there were aggrieved that the firman was addressed solely to Sheikh Iskandar, fearing that he and his relations could claim sole ownership. Bishop El Douaihy, representing the people, put this to Sheikh Iskandar and as a result he declared at the Mar Mama church that the given land known as \"Zgharta would be distributed equally between the people of Ehden\".\n\nLater history\nIn 1602, Father Ghodar, a Jesuit priest to Zgharta recorded:\n\"Zgharta represents a horrific nightmare for its enemy. Its youth is dressed in traditional clothing; white shirts decorated with yellow stitched embroidery, strongly tied \"sherwal\" pants along with long boots and topped by headband reflecting enormous heroism. Zgharta is a small village surrounded by an enclosure, and has a fortress beside the church of Virgin Mary. Zgharta used to be a drawn line between danger and worship, situated between Tripoli and the mountain. It would receive initial attacking strikes, then reply by returning those strikes, hitting the hearts of their enemy. Its people have therefore been renowned and recognised as excellent fighters\"\nAnother later visitor in 1831 records that \"From Tripoli I left for Zgharta, which is two hours away. Its land is full of olive, mulberry, vines, apricot and lemon trees\"\nThe town of Zgharta was divided into five sectors in 1932: Saydeh Sharki (the area to the east side of Notre-Dame of Zgharta church), Saydeh Gherbi (west of the Church), Slayeb Shemali (northern side of the crossroads), Slayeb Janoubi (southern side of the crossroads) and Maaser. To be a citizen of Zgharta, one is to be registered in one of these five sectors.\n\nAccent\nZghartaouis are instantly recognizable by their distinct accent. Zgharta, whose general population did not speak Arabic until the end of the 19th century, transferred some of the Syriac terminology as well as signs of movement and incorporated them into the Arabic language that they now speak due to the necessity of communicating with the rest of the residents of Mount Lebanon and its coast and those who abandoned this language. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Saint Joseph School in Zgharta attested to this and the other schools in Ehden, which taught the Syriac language in addition to the Arabic and French languages. The prayers and Masses were held in Syriac and Arabic, before they gradually disappeared even among those in charge of the Maronite Church, who lost the books of Maronite prayers and Masses from its Syriac language until it became restricted to schools and seminaries and theological institutes.\nResidents of some villages in Mount Lebanon still speak Arabic with a Syriac accent, clinging to it and maintaining it because it is synonymous with their identity.\n\nEconomy\nThe main economy of Zgharta relies on agriculture, mainly through its surrounding villages through the sale of fruits of vegetables but most importantly through the production of olives and olive oil, which are exported. \nTourism also plays a big role in the city's economy, however this is mainly derived from tourism in Ehden, as Zgharta does not see many tourists. \nZgharta also has a small industrial sector, mainly through a couple of concrete plants and other industrial manufacturers.\n\nClimate\nThe climate is hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa in the Köppen climate classification), with very wet winters and very dry summers. About 1,053 mm (41.46 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nGeography\nZgharta is situated at an altitude of around 120m above sea level. The main and old city of Zgharta is situated between the two rivers of Rachiine and Jouit which merge forming the Abu Ali River which then passes through the city of Tripoli.  \nZgharta is situated at the steps of the Northern Mount Lebanon range in a not-too-hilly but very fertile agricultural area, mainly due to the rivers that flow through it. Olives, citrus fruits and lettuce were the main and historical crops grown in the area for centuries. Today, a variety of crops are grown: avocados, strawberries, kale, cabbage being the most popular.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 98.59% of registered voters in Zgharta. 91.79% of the voters were Maronite Catholics. \nMost people living in Zgharta are from the local Zghartawi families, but in the last 20 years, many Christians, mainly Maronites, originally from Danniyeh and Akkar have moved to Zgharta, and are settled in Mejdlaya and Kfarhata.\n\nNotable people\nIstifan al-Duwayhi\nTony Frangieh\nTony Frangieh Jr.\nHamid Frangieh\nMichael Cheika\nSuleiman Frangieh\nSamir Frangieh\nYoussef Barakat\nAdam Doueihi\nAntoine Al Douaihy (born 1999), footballer\nThomas George (Australian politician)\nSuleiman Frangieh\nOdette Kaddo\nFrangieh family\nYoussef Bey Karam\nYoussef Salim Karam\nSalim Bey Karam\nMarie al-Khazen\nMichel Moawad\nRene Mouawad\nJean Obeid\nJohn Symond\n\nSee also\nGigarta – Ancient settlement in North Lebanon\nEhden – City in Zgharta District, Lebanon\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nZgharta Ehden Municipality Archived 2021-05-07 at the Wayback Machine\nYoussef Bey Karam Foundation Archived 2021-02-26 at the Wayback Machine\nEhden Family Tree\nZgharta On Google Maps Street View By Paul Saad",
          "summary": "Zgharta (Arabic: زغرتا, Classical Syriac: ܙܓܪܬܐ), also spelled Zghorta, is a city in North Lebanon, with an estimated population of around 50,000. It is the second biggest city in Northern Lebanon after Tripoli. Zgharta is officially the Zgharta-Ehden municipality.\nZgharta is about 150 metres above sea level and lies between the rivers of Jouit and Rashein. It is 23 kilometres from Ehden, 11 kilometres from the coastal city of Tripoli, 88.7 kilometres from the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, and 82 kilometres from the nearest Syrian city, Tartous. Its history and people are closely associated with the village of Ehden, a summer resort and touristic center. Most of the citizens of Zgharta have summer houses in Ehden.\nIt is the seat and the capital of the Zgharta District (Qadaa' Zgharta). Zgharta is closely related to the mountain town of Ehden, essentially sharing the same population. Each summer, most of the people in Zgharta move to spend their summer in Ehden; this is reversed in winter when Ehden is practically deserted.\nZgharta had two Presidents of Lebanon: Suleiman Frangieh and René Moawad, and many prominent politicians: Youssef Salim Karam, Hamid Frangieh, historian Jawad Boulos Makary, Semaan El Douaihy, Suleiman Frangieh Jr, Nayla Moawad, Estephan El Douaihy (ex-MP), Salim Bey Karam, Tony Frangieh (current MP), Jawad Boulos, Michel Moawad (current MP) and Youssef Bahha El Douaihy. Ehden also produced at least four patriarchs of the Maronite Church – Gregorios Of Ehden, David Of Ehden, Jeremiah of Amshit (1199-1230), Youhanna Makhlouf (1609-1633), George Omaira (1634-1644), Estephan El Douaihy (1670-1704) – and an Ottoman era nationalist leader Youssef Bey Karam who led a rebellion against Turkish rule. Political power in Zgharta district is dominated by a few rival families from the town: the Karam, Frangieh, Douaihy, Moawad and Makary.\nTraditionally, agriculture was a large portion of the local economy, with olives grown for olive-oil around Zgharta and apple orchards around Ehden. Recently, the service (especially tourism and leisure) and manufacturing sectors have seen significant growth.",

It covers an area of 6500 hectares, at an altitude ranging between 350 meters in the North-West and 1,700 meters to the South-East. Its main villages are: Yahchouch, Qahmez, Jouret el-Termos, Nahr ed Dahab, Ghbaleh, Ebreh, and Chouwan. Jabal Moussa and surrounding villages became part of the UNESCO Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) program in 2009. As part of the MAB program, JMBR addresses human livelihood improvement and nature conservation through combining natural sciences with social sciences, economics and education. \nThe Jabal Moussa mountain presents an exceptionally rich biodiversity, with more than 724 flora species, 25 mammal species, and more than 137 migratory and soaring birds species. In 2009, Jabal Moussa was designated a Globally Important Bird Area. Equally rich with cultural heritage, it portrays the interdependence of Man and Nature throughout history through various spiritual and historical sites dating back from the Phoenician, Roman, and Ottoman Periods.\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, the reserve has a Mediterranean climate (Csa/Csb depending on the altitude), with mostly dry and warm summers and cool to cold, wet winters. The region's average annual rainfall is about 1350mm. The peaks of the Jabal Moussa mountain receive some intermittent snowfall during winter; however, the snowfall typically melts within a few days.\n\nArcheology\nPart of the UNESCO Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Man and Biosphere (MAB), Jabal Moussa, which has fifteen hiking trails including one called Hadrian’s Incline, named after the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who put up boundary markers around the cedar, oak, cypress, fir and juniper forests, and declared them his imperial domain; many of these inscriptions engraved on the rock survive today along with a network of Roman roads and stairs, built between 64 BC and AD 249. The largest archaeological site in the biosphere is called “Qornet el Deir” (translates to “the hill of the monastery”) and excavations done since 2017 have proven that the site was inhabited not only in the Roman Medieval eras, but its occupation goes back to the Bronze Age and the Phoenicians, who had a significant settlement that interconnected the Beqaa Valley and the coast.  In 2022, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea inaugurated the Hinterland Archaeological Heritage Project in Jabal Moussa, which was funded by the U.S. Ambassadors' Fund for Cultural Preservation to conserve, study, and showcase the archaeological collection of Jabal Moussa while connecting the various archaeological sites of the biosphere reserve to one another.\n\nSee also\nAl Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve\nHorsh Ehden\nAammiq Wetland\nWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves in the Arab States\n\n\n== References ==",
