      "content": "Byblos ( BIB-loss; Ancient Greek: Βύβλος), also known as Jebeil, Jbeil or Jubayl (Arabic: جُبَيْل, romanized: Jubayl, locally Jbeil [ʒ(ə)beːl]), is an ancient city in the Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate of Lebanon. The area is believed to have been first settled between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. During its history, Byblos was part of numerous cultures including Egyptian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Genoese, Mamluk and Ottoman. Urbanisation is thought to have begun during the third millennium BC when it developed into a city, making it one of the oldest cities in the world,  if not the oldest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIt was in Ancient Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet, the ancestor of the Greek, Latin and all other Western alphabets, was developed.\n\nEtymology\nThe name appears as kbnj in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (fl. 2600 BC) and as Gubla (𒁺𒆷) in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th-dynasty pharaohs Amenhotep III and IV. In the 1st millennium BC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as Gebal (𐤂𐤁𐤋, GBL); in the Hebrew Bible as Geval (גבל); and in Syriac as GBL (ܓܒܠ). Eusebius' Onomasticon stated that Byblos was called \"Gobel / Gebal\" in Hebrew. The name seems to derive from GB (𐤂𐤁, \"well\") and ʾL (𐤀𐤋, \"god\"), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the \"Well of the God\" or \"Source of the God\".\nIts present Arabic name Jubayl (جبيل) or J(e)beil is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root GBL or JBL, meaning \"mountain\". When the Arabic form of the name is used, it is typically rendered Jbeil, Jbail, or Jbayl in English. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in Western records as Gibelet or Giblet. This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship.\nThe Phoenician City, known to the Greeks as Býblos (Βύβλος) and to the Romans as Byblus, was important for their import of papyrus out of Ancient Egypt – to the extent that \"byblos\" came to mean \"papyrus\" in Greek. The English word \"Bible\", therefore, ultimately derives from the Greek name of the city, Βύβλος ('Βύblos / Byblos'), a Greek mumbo-jumble of גְּבָל ('Gāḇal / Gəbal Gobâl'..., that is, 'Gebal' or 'Jebel'), which shares the same root as גְּבוּל ('Gəḇūl / Gābūl, that is 'Gebul' or 'Jabul'), as they're derivatives of ג־ב־ל ('g-ḇ-l' / 'g-b-l' / 'g-v-l'), which means 'twist as a rope', '(be a, set) border' or 'bound(aria)', which tells us that it is a North Boundary of Canaan.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nSituated approximately 42 km (26 mi) north of Beirut, Byblos holds a strong allure for archaeologists due to its accumulations of various strata resulting from countless centuries of human dwelling. The initial excavation was conducted by Ernest Renan in 1860, documented in his work \"Mission de Phénicie\" (1865–1874). This was succeeded by Pierre Montet's efforts from 1921 to 1924, and later by Maurice Dunand, who continued excavations from 1925 for a span of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\".\nFragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal / Baal Hammon in the syncretising system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.) According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos was founded by the Phoenician shrine god El (whom the Greeks identified with their god Cronus). During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size. This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop.\n\nNeolithic and Chalcolithic levels\nNeolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. Jacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937. Tombs from this era were discussed by Emir Maurice Chehab in 1950. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R. Erich in 1954 and Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1964.\n\nDunand's five-level stratigraphy\nPrehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho):\n\nEarly Neolithic (early phase) corresponding to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC;\nEarly Neolithic (late phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC, represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points;\nMiddle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC;\nLate Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC;\nEarly Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and,\nLate Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC.\nThe site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC (Durand's Early Neolithic).\nEarly Neolithic Byblos was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between.\n\nThe original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of 1.2 ha (3.0 acres) providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed. Dwellings were rectangular with plastered floors, pottery was usually Dark faced burnished ware with some shell impressions.\nThe Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than 0.15 ha (0.37 acres) adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors.\nThe Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of \"Canaanite blades\" and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs.\n\nEarly Bronze\nAccording to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen's village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC.  Early Bronze Age remains were characterised by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.\nWatson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt and Middle Kingdom of Egypt Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among \"those who are on his waters\") of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\". Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\".\n\nMiddle Bronze\nObjects have been found at Byblos naming the 12th Dynasty king Senusret II, the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I.\n\nLate Bronze\nThe rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\nAround 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighbouring city-states by the Habiru.\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia. Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favouring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.\nArchaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200–1000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nIron Age\nIn the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki. Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–627 BC), under its kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek.\nIn the Achaemenid Empire (538–332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyr, and Arwad.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\nDuring the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyrus and Zidonia, was a centre for the cult of Adonis.\nKing Herod of Judaea, known for his extensive building projects, including beyond his own kingdom, constructed a city wall for Byblos.\nIn the 3rd century, a small but impressive theatre was constructed. With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly. Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet.\n\nCrusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period\nIn the 12th and 13th century, Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nAs Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet, first as administrators of the city in the name of the Republic of Genoa, and then as a hereditary fief, undertaking to pay an annual fee to Genoa and the church of San Lorenzo (Genoa's Cathedral).\nThe Embriaco family's residence, the Byblos Castle, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, and conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300.\nHaving voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored by Baybars. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nContemporary history\nByblos and all of Lebanon were placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. The 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbour and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power plant.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave Byblos and 33 other cultural sites enhanced protection to safeguard them against damage.\n\nDemographics\nByblos's inhabitants are significantly Christian, mostly Maronite, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shia and Sunni Muslims. It is said that the predominantly  Shi`i city of Bint Jbeil (\"Daughter of Byblos\") in Southern Lebanon was founded by Shi`a migrants from Byblos. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shi`i Muslim.\n\nEducation\nByblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the Pharmacy School, which offers the only Pharm.D. Program outside the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nTourism\nByblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub. With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city. Byblos was crowned as the \"Arab Tour Capital\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut. Byblos was chosen by Condé Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.\n\nThe Byblos archaeological site\nAin el-Malik or King's Spring, about 20 m deep, is a large cavity accessible by spiral stairs. Once it supplied the city with water. According to Plutarch's version of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the king's servants met Isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace, where she found the body of her husband Osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars.\n\nThe L-shaped Temple was erected about 2700 BC.\n\nThe Temple of the Obelisks, originally built in 1600–1200 BC on top of the “L-shaped temple,” was moved by archaeologists to its present location. The many small obelisks found in this temple were used as religious offerings. The sanctuary contained a large number of human figurines made of bronze covered with gold leaf, which are now displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.\nThe royal necropolis dates back to the second millennium BC and contains tombs of the Byblos kings, including King Ahiram.\nThe Bronze Age necropolis of the Gebalite elite, discovered in 2019 at the southern outskirts of the ancient city acropolis.\nThe Roman theater was built around AD 218.\n\nOther historic buildings\nByblos Wax Museum\n\nThe Byblos Wax Museum displays wax statues of characters whose dates of origin range from Phoenician times to current days.\n\nByblos Fossil Museum\n\nThe Byblos Fossil Museum has a collection of fossilised fish, sharks, eel, flying fish, and other marine life, some of which are millions of years old.\n\nMedieval city wall\nThe old medieval part of Byblos is surrounded by walls running about 270m from east to west and 200m from north to south.\n\nByblos Castle\n\nByblos Castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century. It is located in the archaeological site near the port.\n\nSt John the Baptist Church\nWork on the church started during the Crusades in 1115. It was considered a cathedral and was partially destroyed during an earthquake in AD 1170. It was later given to the Maronite bishop as a gift by Prince Yusuf Shihab.\n\nSultan Abduljid Mosque\nThe old mosque by the Castle dates back to the Mamluk period, and adopted the name of Sultan Abdulmejid I after he renovated it.\n\nHistoric Quarter and Souks\nIn the southeast section of the historic city, near the entrance of the archaeological site, is an old market.\n\nByblos International Festival\n\nThis summer music festival is an annual event that takes place in the historic quarter.\n\nTemple of Baalat Gebal\n\nAram Bezikian Museum\nThe Armenian Genocide Orphans' Aram Bezikian Museum is a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the Armenian Genocide and its survivors.\n\nNotable people\nMajdi Allawi (born 1970), Maronite priest, association founder\nJihad Azour (born 1966), economist\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nByblos is twinned with:\n\n Bonifacio, France\n Mangalia, Romania\n Orange, France\n Patras, Greece\n\nGallery\nSee also\nByblos syllabary\nCities of the ancient Near East\nDugurasu\n\nNotes\nReferences\nHead, Barclay; et al.

Les Grecs la nommèrent Byblos, car c'est de Gebal que le papyrus (en grec ancien βύβλος / búblos) était importé en Grèce.\nElle se situe aujourd’hui sur le site de la ville moderne de Jbeil dans le gouvernorat du Mont-Liban (actuel Liban), sur la côte méditerranéenne, à environ 40 kilomètres au nord de Beyrouth. Elle aurait été fondée vers 5000 av. J.-C. Dès le IVe millénaire av. J.-C., Byblos est un centre commercial actif, négociant surtout avec l’Égypte antique le bois du Liban. Ce rapprochement avec l’Égypte a un effet durable sur l’art et la culture de Byblos, elle devient un centre religieux important où l‘on pratique le culte d’Osiris.\nElle fait aussi commerce de textile et de vêtements avec la Mésopotamie, notamment avec la ville de Mari et également avec les Minoens de Crète. Les souverains amorrites de Byblos se font enterrer dans des tombeaux avec des objets égyptiens (Tombeau d’Ahiram, roi au XIe siècle av. J.-C.). Elle se caractérise aujourd’hui par son antique port de pêche, son site romain et le château de Byblos construit par les croisés au XIIe siècle.\nByblos est une des plus vieilles villes du monde, possiblement la plus vieille, à avoir été continuellement habitée.\n\nHistoire\nByblos est habitée de manière continue depuis plus de 7 000 ans, ce qui en fait l'une des plus anciennes villes du monde. Les traces les plus anciennes d’une occupation humaine sur le site sont celles d’un village de pêcheurs du Néolithique, établi probablement vers 5000 av. J.-C.\n\nDès le milieu du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C., la cité-État de Byblos est colonisée par les Phéniciens et devient un centre religieux important. Le temple de Baalat Gebal était ainsi célèbre dans le monde antique. Les liens entretenus par la ville avec l’Égypte antique sont très étroits et sont à l’origine du rapide développement culturel et religieux de la cité. Byblos est aussi un port actif qui exporte le vin et les bois du Liban vers l'Égypte et importe du papyrus égyptien pour le revendre à travers toute la Méditerranée. L'une des étapes du cabotage vers l'Égypte est le port de Tell Abou Hawan dans la baie de Haïfa. Cette escale contribuera son développement lors de l'épopée cananéenne au Bronze ancien.\nLes historiens modernes proposent que l'ancien nom de la ville, Byblos, dérive du mot grec pour papyrus, βύϐλος (býblos). La ville était en effet pendant l’Antiquité une escale importante pour les navires chargés de papyrus en provenance d’Égypte et se rendant en Grèce. Plus tard le mot dérivé désignera le livre en grec (βιϐλίον / biblíon) et finalement le mot Bible. Une autre version rapportée par Étienne de Byzance au VIe siècle dans les Ethniques renvoie à la divinité Byblis, laquelle aurait trouvé la mort en ce lieu avant de se changer en source.\nByblos est aussi directement associée avec l'histoire et la diffusion de l'alphabet phénicien. C'est à Byblos qu'a été faite la découverte de la plus ancienne inscription phénicienne gravée sur le sarcophage d'Ahiram, origine de notre alphabet contemporain.\n\nByblos aujourd’hui\nL’ancienne cité est entourée de murailles d’époque médiévale comportant des fûts de colonnes antiques inclus dans les murs. Cette méthode de construction est également visible au « Château de la mer » de saint Louis à Sidon (Saïda).\nL’intérieur de la cité abrite une église construite par les Génois, une petite mosquée, un souk d’artisanat local, le château croisé, le site antique et le port.\n\nLe site antique\nLe site antique de Byblos, excavé par Maurice Dunand (archéologue français) de 1924 à 1975, se trouve sur une pointe de terre qui contrôle deux baies, une au nord qui abrite l’actuel port, l’autre au sud. Depuis ce port furent probablement exportés du vin, et une grande quantité de bois de cèdre du Liban vers l’Égypte et la Grèce.\nLe site contient des ruines de toutes les populations qui ont habité la région depuis sa fondation : \n\nle temple en L, ainsi appelé en raison de sa forme, érigé vers 2700 av. J.-C. ;\nle temple aux Obélisques du XVIe siècle av. J.-C., originellement construit au-dessus du temple en L, et déplacé par les archéologues. Au temple se dressent de nombreux obélisques. Dans le sol du temple on a trouvé beaucoup d’offrandes votives comme des statuettes de bronze et d'or qui se trouvent au musée national de Beyrouth ;\ndans une dépression de 20 m de profondeur se trouvait la source Aïn al-Malik. C’est là que, selon la version de Plutarque du mythe d'Osiris, Isis venait pleurer Osiris ;\nla nécropole royale de Byblos remonte au IIe millénaire av. J.-C. et contient les tombes des rois de Byblos, entre autres le sarcophage du roi Ahiram, sur lequel est inscrite la plus vieille transcription phénicienne, aujourd’hui exposé au musée national de Beyrouth ;\nun théâtre romain, construit vers 218 ;\nune colonnade romaine ainsi qu’un nymphée ;\nles murailles de la ville phénicienne ;\nles fortifications perses ;\nune maison traditionnelle libanaise du début du XXe siècle (la maison de Mousbah et Ousman Houssami).\n\nChronologie des rois phéniciens de Byblos\nLe musée Mémoire du temps\nLe musée Mémoire du temps abrite une importante collection de fossiles remontant a 100 millions d'années.
