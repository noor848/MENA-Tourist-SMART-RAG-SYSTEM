      "content": "Marid Castle (or Marid balance) is a historic military fortress located in the city of Dumat al-Jandal in the Al-Jawf region of Saudi Arabia, about 50 km from Sakaka. Built in the first century AD, it was first mentioned in the third century in the context of Queen Zenobia's campaign against Dumat al-Jandal and Tayma's rebellion, when her troops weren't able to capture the fortress.\n\nEtymology\nThe castle of Marid was named for its rebellion and insurrection against those trying to storm it, as stated by Yaqout al-Hamwi.\n\nLocation\nThe castle is located on a hill rising to about 620 meters above sea level, and overlooks the city of Dumat al-Jandal, which is affiliated to the Al-Jawf region from the western side. That contributed to its importance, as the castle can oversee all parts of the town and observe any approaching friend or foe long before they arrive.\n\nHistory\nMarid fortress dates back to the first century. The oldest mention of it dates back to the third century AD when Queen Zenobia invaded Adumato (today's Dumat al-Jandal) and Tayma, but could not capture the fortress. Therefore she reportedly said, \"Marid has rebelled, and Ablaq has glorified.\"\nIn 633 CE, Khalid ibn al-Walid annexed Dumat al-Jandal to the newly formed Islamic empire.\nIn 1853, Ha'il governor Talal Ibn Rashid damaged the castle with two cannons.\nIn 1909, Nawwaf Ibn Sha'lan besieged it for ten months until he could wrest it from the Rashids.\nSome parts of the castle were rebuilt between AH 1416 and AH 1423 (AD 1995/6-2002/3). In addition to a mosque restoration project that includes parts of the Al-Daraa neighborhood, which included installing stone buildings, restoring cracks in the facades, entrance, and corridors, and installing wooden ceilings of taramax stems in the corridors and layers of moisture insulation.\nIn 2018, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH) has launched a project to repair the castle. In the framework of the project, a cafe and a traditional restaurant have been built in the castle.\n\nDescription\nThe castle was originally rectangular, but is now oval in shape. It can be accessed from two main entrances, one in the south of the castle and the other in the north, next to the tower.\nThe castle has two floors; the first was built in stone, the upper one in mud. There also are four conical towers with height of 12 meter, and they were created at various times. Inside the castle, there are two wells, and its floors contain rooms for guards, shooting and observation.\nThe castle is surrounded by a large stone wall with many openings for observation. The fence has two entrances, one from the south and the other from the north.\nVisitors need about 30 minutes to climb up to the top of the castle due to its 1000 steps twisted stair.\n\nExcavation and dating of the castle and city\nExcavations at Marid Castle - inside and outside the castle - have proven that the castle dates back to the Nabataean period; the excavations brought to light layers with pottery and other findings dating back to the Nabataean period, such as:\n\nThe castle foundations\nNabatean findings in different parts of the Dumat al-Jandal\nA group of Nabataean mass cemeteries in the site of Sanaymiyat, located west of Dumat al-Jandal.\nWall remains of the castle.\nIn 1976, excavations revealed Nabataean and Roman ceramics dating back to the first and second centuries AD. An excavation team completed the excavation east of the castle and the wall.\nExcavations made by Khaleel Ibrahim Al-Moaqil in 1986 added to observations made in 1976 that a homogeneous layer of Roman-Nabataean pottery sherds indicated a prosperous community during the time of the Nabataeans, to whose realm the region probably belonged.\n\nNearby ancient sites\nThere are many other ancient sites in the castle's vicinity, such as the Omar ibn al-Khattab mosque, Old Dumat al-Jandal's market, the historical neighborhood of Al-Dara’a, and the city wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Saudi Arabia\nLake Dumat al-Jandal\nTourism in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nGeneral\nAl-Jawf, the fortified North Castle, Abdul Rahman Al-Tayeb Al-Ansari, Dar Al-Qawafel for Publishing and Distribution, Riyadh, 1429 AH / 2008AD.\nAl-Jouf and Hussain Al-Khalifa  Nawaf Al-Rashed, Pavilion of Al-Jouf Emirate, the 18th National Festival of Heritage and Culture, 1423 AH / 2003 AD.\nResearch in the effects of Al-Jouf region, Khalil Ibrahim Al-Moaqil, Abdul Rahman Charitable Foundation, Al-Jouf, 1st floor, 1422 AH.",
