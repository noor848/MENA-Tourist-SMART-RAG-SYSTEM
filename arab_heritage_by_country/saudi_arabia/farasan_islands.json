      "content": "The Farasan Islands (Arabic: جزر فرسان; transliterated: Juzur Farasān) are a small group of coral islands approximately 40 km off the coast of Jizan in the Red Sea, belonging to Saudi Arabia.\nThe government provides free ferry rides twice a day to Farasan Islands from Jizan Port. The largest island of the archipelago is Farasan Island; others include Sajid Island and Zufaf Island. The islands are a popular tourist destination. In recent years the Saudi government has tried to increase the tourism quality and worth (as part of a larger tourism drive in the country) of the Islands in order to attract even more visitors.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1st century AD, the islands were known as Portus Ferresanus. A Latin inscription dating from 144 AD  has been found on the island which attests to the construction of a Roman garrison. \nIt is believed that the islands may have been attached to the Roman province of Arabia Felix, before being transferred to Aegyptus some time before 144 AD. \nThis fact would make the Farasan Islands the farthest Roman outpost (until at least the third century), being nearly 4,000 km (2,500 mi) from Rome itself. \nIt remained this way up until the Arab Muslim conquest of the islands and subsequent Islamization. Furthermore it is noteworthy to pinpoint that recent studies found that in the local language there are some loanwords from Latin.\n\nAl-Najdi Mosque\nAl-Najdi Mosque was constructed in 1929. It is one of the oldest worship sites on Farasan Island in the Jazan region, southwest of Saudi Arabia. The mosque originally took 13 years to build, and features paintings and inscriptions brought from India. The mosque is currently undergoing phase two restoration as part of the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Project for the Development of Historic Mosques.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in the Farasan archipelago is characterised by a long hot season (April–October) and a short mild one (November–March). In the long dry period, high temperatures are usually dominant. The mean annual temperature is 30 °C. Furthermore, the mean relative humidity in winter ranges from 70% to 80% and in summer between 65% and 78%. The highest rainfall occurs in April and the precipitation is generally unpredictable in the southern part of Red Sea.\n\nNature\nThe Farasan Island Marine Sanctuary is a protected area. It is home to the Arabian gazelle, and, in winter, migratory birds from Europe. Oceanic animals include manta rays, whale sharks, and several species of sea turtles including endangered and critically endangered green and hawksbill turtles, dugongs, and several species of dolphins and whales with occasional visits by others such as orcas.\n\nEconomy\nAfter a French engineer investigated petroleum seeps on the islands in 1912, a 75-year concession was granted to the Red Sea oilfields. At the time, the Farasan Islands supported a small fishing industry.\nTourism and fishing also play a role in the economy. Farasan Island is connected to Jezan port by ferry.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSaudi Aramco World: Dreaming of Farasan\nFarasan Island, a diver's paradise Archived 2016-03-02 at the Wayback Machine, Splendid Arabia: A travel site with photos and routes",
