          "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Mada’in Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح, romanized: madāʼin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας Mathousalas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Mada’in Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Mada’in Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Mada’in Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

          "content": "مَدَائِن صَالِح كانت تعرف قديماً بـ الحِجْر، هي موقع أثري يقع في إقليم الحجاز في شبه الجزيرة العربية، شمال غرب المملكة العربية السعودية وتحديداً في محافظة العُلا التابعة لمنطقة المدينة المنورة. يحتل المكان موقعاً إستراتيجياً على الطريق الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية ببلاد الرافدين وبلاد الشام ومصر، كما أن للمكان شهرته التاريخية التي استمدّها من موقعه على طريق التجارة القديم الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية والشام، والحجر اسم ديار ثمود بوادي القرى بين المدينة المنورة وتبوك. ورد ذكر الحجر في القرآن على أنها موطن قوم ثمود، الذين استجابوا لدعوة نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدُّوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقة التي أرسلها الله لهم آية فأهلكهم بالصيحة.\nتعد مدائن صالح من أهم حواضر الأنباط بعد عاصمتهم البتراء، إذ تحتوي على أكبر مستوطنة جنوبية لمملكة الأنباط بعد البتراء في الأردن، والتي تفصلها عنها مسافة 500 كم، ويعود أبرز أدوارها الحضارية إلى القرنين الأول قبل الميلاد والأول الميلادي، وذلك خلال فترة ازدهار الدولة النبطية وقبل سقوطها على يد الإمبراطورية الرومانية عام 106م، ويُعتقد أن الحِجْر استمرت في حضارتها حتى القرن الرابع الميلادي، وكانت عاصمة مملكة لحيان في شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية.\nتضم آثار مدائن صالح 153 واجهة صخرية منحوتة، كما تضم عدداً من الآثار الإسلامية والتي تتمثل في عدد من القلاع وبقايا خط سكة حديد الحجاز والتي تمتد لمسافة 13 كم وكذلك المحطة والقاطرات. في سنة 2008م تم تسجيل الموقع ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، ليصبح بذلك أول موقع يتم تسجيله في السعودية.\nكما يوجد موقع أثري آخر يعرف بمدائن شعيب يقع شمال غرب مدائن صالح ويتبع منطقة تبوك، حيث يحتوي الموقع على آثار تشبه إلى حد كبير تلك الموجودة في مدائن صالح.\n\nالتاريخ\nمملكة دادان\nهي مملكة تابعة لمملكة معين من القرن الخامس ق.م حتى بدايات الأول ق.م، قامت في الحِجْر والأجزاء الشمالية الغربية من شبه الجزيرة العربية، وأغلب الظن أنها مرحلة سابقة لمملكة لحيان حيث يعتقد بعض الباحثين أن اللحيانيين كانوا من سكان العربية الجنوبية، لورود نص يشير إلى قيل لحياني في اليمن اسمه «أب يدع ذو لحيان» واستوطنوا دادان جنوب أراضي لحيان، فلما ضعفت حكومة المعينيين في اليمن استولى اللحيانيون على المملكة وأسموها على اسم قبيلتهم، وليس بين الباحثين اتفاق على أصولهم تحديداً، ويرى جواد علي أن المعينيين كوَّنوا مستعمرات في أعالي الحجاز منذ القرن الخامس قبل الميلاد ووصفهم باللحيانيين أيام قوة المعينيين، وهدف هذه المستعمرات هو تأمين الطريق التجارية من اليمن إلى الشام. ووفقاً لورنر كاسكل: \n\n أغلب بضاعتهم القادمة من جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية كانت موجهة لمصر واليونان ويعتقد كاسكل أن اللحيانيين استولوا عليها في منتصف القرن الثاني ق.م قرابة 150 ق.م فقد كان المعينيون يسيطرون على الحِجْر وأعالي الحجاز من القرن الخامس ق.م بمساعدة من اللحيانيين بدلالة أن أول ملوكهم كان معينياً ثم عادت للحيان مستغلين ضعف مملكة معين وحروبها مع مملكة سبأ. يرى جواد علي أن اللحيانيين ينحدرون من النبي إسماعيل، وقد عدهم بلينيوس الأكبر في جملة الشعوب العربية كذلك.\n\nاللحيانيون\nيختلف المؤرخون في أصل اللحيانيين، فمنهم من يرى أنهم فرع من ثمود، بينما يرى آخرون أنهم أحد الشعوب العربية الجنوبية، بدليل أنه قد ورد اسم لحيان في نص عربي جنوبي. كانت العلا مركزاً للحيانيين، حيث كانت مستعمرة معينية قديمة، كما أنها القاعدة الشمالية القصوى للحضارة العربية الجنوبية، تقع في وادي القرى جنوب شرق حرة العويرض بين سلسلة من الجبال في الشرق والغرب، وعلى بُعد حوالي 15 كم إلى الجنوب من مدائن صالح، هناك موقع كان يُسمّى قديماً «ددان» أو «ديدان» بحسب ما جاء في كتب الأنساب اليهودية وفي النصوص المعينية، ولاحقاً سُمّي بوادي القرى ويُعرف الآن بالعُلا، وقد اختلف الباحثون فيمن حكم هذه المنطقة أولاً وكان الاختلاف بين الديدانيين والمعينيين واللحيانيين.\nامتد نفوذ دولة لحيان على الأرض الممتدة غربي النفود، من شمال يثرب إلى ما يحاذي خليج العقبة.\nوقد اختلف في فترة دولة لحيان، يرى البعض أنها كانت بين بداية القرن الخامس ونهاية القرن الثالث قبل الميلاد، ويرى آخرون إلى أنها إنما كانت فيما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد (حوالي سنة 160 ق. م) وبين نهاية القرن الثالث بعد الميلاد، وهناك من حدد الفترة ما بين عامي 280 - 200 قبل الميلاد لقيامها،\nوأن نهايتها كانت على أيدي الأنباط الذين استولوا على «الحِجْر» سنة 65 ق. م، و«ديدان» سنة 9 ق. م،\nوأن هناك من يرى أن نهاية دولة لحيان إنما كانت على أيدي المعينيين، وأن ذلك كان بين نهاية القرن الثالث والقرن الأول قبل الميلاد.\nعُثِر في العُلا بالقرب من مدائن صالح على ما يقارب من أربعمائة نقش لحياني أغلبها عبارة عن نقوش وقطع صغيرة، ومنها ما يحتوي على بعض أسماء الملوك والمعبودات الوثنية، أما بالنسبة للكتابة اللحيانية، فهي كتابة محلية حروفها سامية جنوبية وقريبة جداً من الكتابة العربية الجنوبية والحبشية، أما اللهجة فعربية شمالية وهي أيضاً سامية جنوبية. يرى البعض أنها كانت مسيحية، بينما يرجّح آخرون أنها عربية جاهلية وضعت قبل ظهور الإسلام.\nتحتوي هذه النقوش والكتابات على بعض أسماء ملوك لحيان، منها «هنوس بن شهر» و«ذو أسفعين تخمى بن لوذان» الذي يرجع حكمه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. كما أن هناك معبد يقع في العُلا يعود للحيانيين، وُجِدت فيه تماثيل بطول الإنسان لملوك لحيان، وهذه التماثيل متأثرة بالنحت الفرعوني في النصف الأعلى من الجسم، ومن حيث اللبس، ولكنها تحمل الطابع العربي المتمثل في شكل الوجه، وما وضع على الرأس بما يشبه العمامة والعقال.\nيرى البعض أن الأنباط قد استولوا على الحِجْر سنة 65 ق. م، إلى أن وصلوا إلى تيماء، ثم قطعوا كل اتصال للحيانيين بالبحر، فاستولوا على ميناء «لوكي كومة» التابع للحيانيين، وأحاطوا بهم من جميع الجهات، ويُعتقد أن الطريق التجاري قد تغير اتجاهه بفعل النبطيين في جنوب الحجر، فكان يمر على مسافة 7 كم إلى الشرق من واحة دادان القديمة، ثم أخضعوها لنفوذهم. عاد حكم اللحيانيين مرة أخرى بعد سقوط البتراء على أيدي الرومان سنة 106م، والذين مدوا نفوذهم إلى منطقة تبعد عشرة كيلومترات إلى الشمال من دادان.\n\nالأنباط\nاستوطن النبط (الأنباط) الحِجْر، والأنباط هم من العرب من شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية. في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، في فترة حكم الحارث الرابع جعل من الحِجْر العاصمة الثانية للأنباط حيث كانت عاصمتهم الأولى هي البتراء في الشمال، وكان للأنباط حضارة كبيرة وشيدوا المقابر في الجبال وأضافوا لها الكثير من جماليات البناء القديم، حيث تظهر خصائص العمارة النبطية مع الكتابات النبطية المنقوشة في الصخور على الواجهات الخاصة بهم. كما طوّروا أيضاً زراعة الواحات، وحفر الآبار وعمل خزانات لمياه الأمطار في الصخور، بالإضافة إلى نحت أماكن العبادة في النتوءات الصخرية.\nهناك منشآت ومستوطنات مشابهة لما تحتويه مدائن صالح في عدد من الأماكن مثل الشام والمنطقة المجاورة للحجاز، وأبرز هذه المنشآت ما وجِد في البتراء.\nاستمرت حضارة الأنباط في الازدهار والتوسع في الحجر حتى تحكموا في طرق التجارة في العالم القديم، حيث احتكروا تجارة البخور والمر والتوابل، وكان طريق التجارة القديم يأتي من جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية حتى يصل إلى الحِجْر، ومن الحجر يتفرع إلى طريقين، يذهب أحدهما إلى البتراء ومصر والشام، فيما يذهب الآخر إلى تيماء ثم تدمر في العراق. كما كانت الحجر مركزاً رئيسياً لطرق القوافل القديمة وكانت تتحكم في طرق القوافل، وبلغ نفوذهم كما يذكر المؤرخون شرق شبه الجزيرة العربية وجنوبها، وعندما خشي الرومان على نفوذهم وعلى دولتهم من هذه المملكة الجديدة قام الرومان بشن حرب كبيرة على الأنباط واستطاع الرومان هزيمتهم في الحجر سنة 106م، ولكنهم لم يستوطنوا الحجر بل عادوا إلى الشام، وهكذا تدمرت حضارة الأنباط في الحجر ولم يعد لهم أي ذكر، وظلت الحجر مهجورة زمناً طويلاً.\n\nفترة ما بعد الأنباط\nفي سنة 106م تم ضم مملكة الأنباط من قبل الإمبراطورية الرومانية. وبالتالي أصبح جزء من الحجاز والذي يشمل الحجر تحت إدارتهم.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف نقش روماني في الحجر يعود إلى 175 - 177م.\nتحول طريق التجارة من كونه مساراً بريّاً يصل بين شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية وجنوبها إلى أن أصبح مساراً بحريّاً وذلك عبر البحر الأحمر، مما أدّى إلى انخفاض أهميتها التجاريّة بعد أن كانت مركزاً للتجارة، إلى أن تمّ التخلي عنها لاحقاً. هناك دراسات أثرية افترضت أن الموقع قد فقد وظائفه الحضرية في بدايات أواخر العصور القديمة، ويعود ذلك إلى عملية التصحر في المنطقة.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف أدلة على أن الفيالق الرومانية في عهد تراجان سيطرت على مدائن صالح، لزيادة نفوذها في المقاطعة العربية.\n\nيبقى تاريخ الحجر منذ انهيار الإمبراطورية الرومانية حتى ظهور الإسلام غير معروف، في سنة 9 هـ الموافقة لسنة 630م مر عليها النبي محمد أثناء توجهه لغزوة تبوك. بعد ظهور الإسلام وانتشاره عادت الحركة إلى الحجر، كما تم ذكرها في القرون اللاحقة من قِبَل المسافرين والحجاج في طريقهم إلى مكة، حيث كانت الحجر تخدم كمحطة للاستراحة بها والتزوّد بالماء والطعام، وقد ذكرها العديد من الرحالة العرب كالمقدسي وياقوت الحموي وإبراهيم بن شجاع، وابن بطوطة الذي أشار في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي إلى الصخور والأضرحة الموجودة فيها، ولكنّه لم يشر إلى الأنشطة البشرية هناك.\nتحت الحكم العثماني والذي بدأ في القرن السادس عشر، تم بناء حصن فيها في الفترة ما بين 1744 - 1757م، والذي كان ذلك جزءاً لسلسلة من التحصينات تم بناؤها من أجل حماية طريق الحج إلى مكة.\n\nالمدائن في القرن العشرين\nمنذ القرن التاسع عشر استُخدِمت الآبار القائمة لزراعة المنطقة بشكل دوري من قبل المستوطنين في تيماء المجاورة لها، واستمر هذا حتى القرن العشرين، عندما تم بناء سكة حديد الحجاز (1901 - 1908م) التي كانت تمرّ من خلال الموقع بأمرٍ من السلطان العثماني عبد الحميد الثاني، لربط دمشق والقدس في الشمال الغربي بالمدينة المنورة، لتسهيل رحلة الحج، بالإضافة إلى أمور سياسية واقتصادية لتعزيز الإدارة العثمانية على مراكز العقيدة الإسلامية. بُنِيت محطة مدائن صالح شمال الحجر، وقد عملت على زيادة إمكانية الوصول للموقع. لاحقاً تم تدمير السكة من قِبل الإنجليز خلال الثورة العربية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى.\nاستمرت عدة دراسات أثرية في الموقع للفترة منذ بداية الحرب العالمية الأولى إلى توحيد المملكة العربية السعودية في 1932، إلى أن وصلت إلى الستينيات الميلادية. لاحقاً تم ترميم محطة سكة الحديد، وتتكون من 16 مبنى موزعاً على خط السكة بطول 400 متر تقريباً، وتضم مباني للإدارة والمخازن ومركزاً للشرطة ومركزاً صحياً وإقامة للعاملين في المحطة واستراحات للزوار، كما تتضمن محطة لصيانة القاطرات وورشة للصيانة ومخازن الحطب والطاقة.\nبحلول نهاية فترة الستينيات الميلادية عملت الحكومة السعودية برنامجاً لتحسين أسلوب حياة قبائل البدو الرحل التي تقطن المنطقة. وكان البرنامج يقترح استقرارهم في المنطقة مع إعادة استخدام الآبار الموجودة والاشتغال بالزراعة، ولكن مع اكتساب الموقع هويته الرسمية كموقع أثري سنة 1972 أدّى إلى توطين البدو نحو الشمال خارج حدود الموقع، وشمل ذلك تطوير الأراضي الزراعية الجديدة والآبار التي حفرت حديثاً، للحفاظ على المنطقة.\n\nالحِجْر في الإسلام\nقوم ثمود في القرآن\nالثموديون هم أول من سكن الحجر وأول من نحت المنازل في الصخور وجاء بعدهم الأنباط. جاء ذكر الحِجْر وقصة قوم ثمود في القرآن في أكثر من سورة، حيث يذكر أن الثموديين تميّزوا بالقوة وكانوا يتخذون من الجبال بيوتاً عن طريق النّحت، فقد ورد في القرآن ﴿وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ بِالْوَادِ ۝٩﴾ [الفجر:9]، وأرسل الله إليهم نبيّه صالح، حيث دعاهم إلى عبادة الله وترك عبادة الأصنام ولكنهم لم يؤمنوا به، ومع استمرار دعوته لهم، طلبوا منه أن يخرج لهم ناقة من صخرة كبيرة لديهم، وأنهم سوف يؤمنون إذا نفّذ هذا الأمر، فدعا الله أن يُخرج الناقة واستجاب الله له.\n﴿وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۖ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً ۖ فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِي أَرْضِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ﴾ (سورة الأعراف، الآية: 73)\nفاستجابوا لدعوة نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقة التي أرسلها الله لهم آية وتحدَّوه أن يأتيهم بالعذاب فأهلكهم الله بالصيحة، وكانت الناقة في يوم تشرب جميع الماء الموجود في البئر، وتسقي في اليوم التالي كل سكان الحجر من لبنها، وبعد مدة من الزمن قرر قوم ثمود قتل الناقة، وعندما قتلوها أهلكهم الله جميعاً بالصيحة، ونجا نبيّه صالح ومن آمن معه من قوم ثمود، ومن ثمّ رحل صالح ومن معه من المؤمنين إلى مكة المكرمة.\nمن الآيات التي ذكرت في القرآن عن الحِجْر:\n\n﴿وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أَصْحَابُ الْحِجْرِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ ۝٨٠ وَآتَيْنَاهُمْ آيَاتِنَا فَكَانُوا عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ ۝٨١ وَكَانُوا يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا آمِنِينَ ۝٨٢ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ مُصْبِحِينَ ۝٨٣ فَمَا أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ۝٨٤﴾ (سورة الحجر، الآية: 80 - 84)\n﴿كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ، إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ صَالِحٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ، إِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ، وَمَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، أَتُتْرَكُونَ فِي مَا هَاهُنَا آمِنِينَ، فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ، وَزُرُوعٍ وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ، وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا فَارِهِينَ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ، وَلَا تُطِيعُوا أَمْرَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ، الَّذِينَ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ، قَالُوا إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ، مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا فَأْتِ بِآيَةٍ إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ، قَالَ هَذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَعْلُومٍ، وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ، فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ، فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَآيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ، وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ﴾ (سورة الشعراء، الآية: 141 - 159)\n\nفي السُّنَّة\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «لما نزل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بالناس على تبوك نزل بهم الحِجْر عند بيوت ثمود، فاستقى الناس من الآبار التي كانت تشرب منها ثمود، فعجنوا منها ونصبوا القدور فأمرهم رسول الله فأهرقوا القدور، وعلفوا العجين الإبل، ثم ارتحل بهم حتى نزل بهم على البئر التي كانت تشرب منها الناقة، ونهاهم أن يدخلوا على القوم الذين عذبوا، وقال: إني أخشى أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم فلا تدخلوا عليهم».\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو بالحِجْر: لا تدخلوا على هؤلاء المعذبين إلا أن تكونوا باكين، فإن لم تكونوا باكين فلا تدخلوا عليهم أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم». وفي بعض الروايات «أن النبي محمد لما مَرَّ بمنازلهم قنع رأسه، وأسرع راحلته، ونهى عن دخول منازلهم إلا أن تكونوا باكين». وفي رواية: «فإن لم تبكوا فتباكوا، خشية أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم».\nعن عمرو بن سعد (وقيل: عامر بن سعد) قال: «لما كان في غزوة تبوك، فسارع الناس إلى أهل الحجر يدخلون عليهم، فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فنادى في الناس: الصلاة جامعة. قال: فأتيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو ممسك بعيره، وهو يقول: ما تدخلون على قوم غضب الله عليهم؟ فناداه رجل: نعجب منهم يا رسول الله. قال: أفلا أنبئكم بأعجب من ذلك؟ رجل من أنفسكم ينبئكم بما كان قبلكم، وما هو كائن بعدكم فاستقيموا وسددوا، فإن الله لا يعبأ بعذابكم شيئاً، وسيأتي قوم لا يدفعون عن أنفسهم بشيء».\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدائن صالح على بعد 22 كم شمال شرق مدينة العلا، و400 كم شمال غرب المدينة المنورة و500 كم إلى الجنوب الشرقي من البتراء الواقعة في الأردن، وتقع تحديداً عند دائرة عرض 47 ـ 26 شمالاً، وخط طول 53 ـ 37 شرقاً. يقع الموقع الأثري على منطقة سهلية، عند سفح هضبة من البازلت التي تشكل الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من جبال الحجاز. الأجزاء الغربية والشمالية الغربية للموقع، تحتوي على المياه الجوفية التي يمكن الوصول إليها على عمق 20 متراً تقريباً. يتميز الموقع بطبيعته الصحراوية التي تتسم بالنتوءات الواقعة على الصخور بمختلف الأحجام والارتفاعات.\nتتميز منطقة مدائن صالح بالتكوينات الصخرية، كما أنها تتميز أيضاً بتنوّع ألوان صخورها الرملية بين الأحمر والأصفر والأبيض. بالإضافة إلى أن الموقع محاط بالكثبان الرملية من جميع الجهات.\n\nالعمارة\nالنحت\nتتميّز المدافن النبطية في مدائن صالح كونها ليست مبنية وإنما محفورة في الصخور الرملية، والذي ساهم في سهولة عملية النحت والحفر، كون تلك الصخور غير صلبة ولكنها تتأثر بعوامل التعرية. تتباين ألوان الصخور من الأحمر إلى الأبيض حسب عمرها، حيث يعود تاريخ الصخور الحمراء إلى العصر الكمبري، بينما تعود الصخور البيضاء إلى العصر الأردوفيشي، وتتطابق هذه الصخور مع تلك التي استخدمها الأنباط في البتراء، وهناك عدة تحليلات قام بها خبراء في علم الآثار لتفسير أسلوب النحت المتبع فرأوا أن العملية تمت من الأعلى إلى الأسفل، وبما أن أصحاب تلك المدافن من الطبقة الحاكمة أو من أثرياء الأنباط، فكانت هنالك معايير قبل عملية النحت، حيث يتم اختيار موقع المدفن فكلما كان قريباً من ناحية المساكن كان أكثر تكلفة ويقل كلما تباعد عنها، وارتفاع الصخرة وجودتها كانت من تلك المعايير أيضاً، فالصخور التي تخلو من الصدوع والشقوق تعمل على إبراز تفاصيل النقوش كالشرفات المدرّجة التي تعرف بسلّم الغراب، والكورنيش على النمط المصري والعتب وتيجان الأعمدة التي يتم نحتها على الصخور الجيدة، ولكن أحياناً يتعذّر على النحات معرفة جودة الصخرة في البداية ليتم اكتشافها لاحقاً أثناء النحت، كما يتم تحديد ارتفاع المدفن بشكل دقيق وذلك بحسب الأدوات المتوفرة لديهم، وعندما لا تكون هنالك طبقة طبيعية ناتئة في الصخر يتم نحت قناة أفقية في الصخرة فوق أعلى نقطة في الواجهة المنحوتة، لتمنع من تساقط الأمطار على الواجهة،\nهناك تناسب بين طول واجهة المدفن وعرضه حيث أن ارتفاع المدفن يتحدد بناءً على عرضه، وبالنسبة للمدافن الكبيرة فكان يعمل عليها عدد من النحاتين سواءً كانوا اثنان أو أكثر من ذلك، فيعمل كل واحد في طرف بحيث يتم الالتقاء في منتصف الواجهة، وتختلف كمية الصخور التي يتم نحتها قبل الوصول للواجهة من مدفن إلى آخر، وكان النحاتون يستعملون المنصات الطبيعية المتكونة نتيجة اختلاف مستوى طبقات التكوين الصخري ليقفوا عليها، وعادةً ما يقوم النحّات بالانتهاء من جميع تنفيذ جميع تفاصيل النحت التي تتم في الواجهة من زخارف قبل النزول للأسفل، كما يتم إعداد اللوحة التي يُكتب عليها النص التأسيس ويتم عادة قطعها فوق المدفن، ولكن الكتابة غالباً ما تتم من قِبل كاتب مختص، ويشترك العمّال في تنفيذ أعمال النحت تحت إشراف رئيس النحاتين وأحياناً اثنان من النحاتين ترِد أسماؤهم تحت النص التأسيسي للمدفن، وهناك مجموعة من النحاتين ينتسبون لعائلة واحدة ظهر ذلك من خلال كتابة أسمائهم على عدد من اللوحات، ومن أشهرهم شخص اسمه «أفتح» حيث قام بتنفيذ خمسة مدافن وساهم في اثنين آخرين. هناك بعض العناصر التي عُملت على الواجهة تمت من قبل أشخاص مختصين بذلك ويتم تنفيذ تلك العناصر سواء بشكل مباشر على الصخرة أو بنحتها بشكل منفصل ومن ثم إلحاقها بالمكان المخصص لها في الواجهة. يتم عمل الأسطح الملساء التي تتميز بها الواجهات رأسياً بواسطة معول مستدق الرأس من الطرفين أو الإزميل وهو وتد حديدي مدبب من أحد الطرفين ومسطح في الآخر يتم العمل به عن طريق طرقه بمطرقة.\n\nهناك أجزاء من الواجهة مثل المساحة بين الشرفات والعتب والعارضة أسفل تاج العمود يتم تجصيصها ودهنها بلون أسود أو أحمر، حيث أن هناك عدد من المدافن لا تزال تحتفظ بآثار الجص المستخدم. كان النحاتون يستخدمون بالإضافة إلى أدوات النحت والحفر أدوات القياس، ومنها مقياس الخط العمودي، وشاقول تحديد الاستواء، والمربع، والحبل، وأحياناً الفرجار. هناك عدد من المدافن غير المكتملة في الموقع، ويعود معظمها لنواحٍ فنية على ما يبدو، إمّا أن يكون بسبب أن النحات قد واجه طبقة ملحية أتت من سطح الأرض، وإما أن يكون بسبب شق في الصخرة لم يظهر في بداية العمل بالنحت، أو ظهور طبقة تحتوي على الكثير من الحصى.\nالعنصر الآخر في المدفن هو حُجرة الدفن ويتم حفرها في الصخرة خلف الواجهة، وحجرات الدفن لا تكون عادة بنفس مستوى ارتفاع الواجهات، ومستوى سقف الغرفة يكون متوافقاً مع العتبة العليا للباب، والأداة الوحيدة المستخدمة داخل المدافن كانت المعول مستدق الطرفين، ويوجد عدد من حجرات المدافن غير المكتملة، وربما يعود ذلك كون صاحب المدفن يهتم بالواجهة الخارجية أكثر من الحجرة الداخلية، ومكان الدفن المنحوت داخل الحجرة يتكوّن من ثلاثة أنواع، كوّة أو حفرة أو حجرة مصمتة، وكان ينفذ عندما يتوفى أحد أفراد العائلة، وحين يكون المكان في شكل حجرة فهي تُحفر بحسب حجم الشخص المتوفّى، وعادة ما تكون حجرات الدفن غير منتظمة.\nقام الباحث جان كلود بيساك بتقدير الفترة المطلوبة لتنفيذ مدفن متوسط الحجم بسنة وشهرين، وتستغرق عملية حفر الواجهة المدة الأطول التي قد تستغرق سبعة أشهر، أما حجرة المدفن فتستغرق ما بين أربعة إلى خمسة أشهر وهي تقريباً نفس المدة التي تتطلبها عملية نحت التفاصيل.\n\nالكتابات والنقوش\nتتنوع الكتابات الموجودة في مدائن صالح، فهناك العربية الجنوبية، واللحيانية، والثمودية، والنبطية، واللاتينية، والإسلامية. كما أن مواضيع هذه النقوش تتنوع بين النقوش الدينية والنقوش التأسيسية والنقوش التذكارية، أما أكثر النقوش الموجودة في الموقع فهي النقوش الملكية. تنتشر في الموقع النقوش النبطية كون الموقع وصل لأوج ازدهاره فترة العصر النبطي، وهي تنتشر على واجهات الجبال، وكذلك في أماكن على واجهات المقابر، وقد تضمنت معلومات عن ملكية المقبرة، وما تحتويه من شروط للدفن فيها من قبل أصحابها وورثتهم، كما أنها تحتوي أيضاً على نصوص يتم فيها تحديد العقوبة التي يجب أن تقع على من يخالف قانون الدفن، وبعض النقوش مؤرخة كما تحتوي على اسم النحّات.\n\nالمواقع الأثرية\nواجهات المقابر المنحوتة\nمدافن جبل المحجر\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن جبل المحجر كذلك باسم (المنطقة أ)، وتقع إلى الشمال من مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت بالقرب من البئر النبطي، وهي عبارة عن ثلاث كُتَل صخرية نُحِتت فيها أربعة عشر مدفناً نبطيّاً، حيث تضم الكتلة الصخرية الأولى منها ستة مدافن، وتضم الثانية خمسة مدافن، بينما تضم الثالثة والمسماة بجبل المحجر ثلاثة مدافن.\n\nمدافن قصر البنت\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت أيضاً باسم (المنطقة ب)، وتقع إلى الغرب من جبل أثلب، وتتكون من جبلين أحدهما كبير حيث يمتد من الشمال إلى الجنوب ويضم 31 مدفناً، والآخر صغير يقع شمال غربي الجبل الأول ويضم مدفنين في واجهته الشرقية.\n\nمدافن الجبل الأحمر\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن الجبل الأحمر أيضاً باسم (المنطقة ج)، وتقع إلى الجنوب الغربي من مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت، وإلى الشمال الغربي من منطقة «د»، وتضم كتلتين صخريتين، تحتوي الأولى على 18 مدفناً. بينما تتكون الكتلة الثانية من مدفن واحد فقط، وهي تقع جنوب الكتلة الأولى.\n\nمدافن المنطقة «د»\nتقع المنطقة «د» شرق منطقة قصر الصانع، حيث تتكون من جبلين في كل واحد منهما مقبرة واحدة فقط. في المدفن (رقم: 109) يظهر بأن العمل قد اكتمل في الغرفة الخاصة بالدفن، بينما الجزء السفلي من واجهة المدفن غير مكتملة. بالنسبة للمدفن (رقم: 111) يظهر بأن واجهته قد اكتملت، بينما غرفة الدفن غير مكتملة.\n\nمدافن الخريمات\nتقع منطقة الخريمات جنوب غربي الحِجْر، وتحتوي على 53 مدفناً موزعة على تسعة جبال، وتتميز واجهات المدافن بتعدد العناصر المعمارية والزخرفية، كما أن المنطقة تأثرت بعوامل التعرية والسيول بسبب انخفاض المنطقة. الجبل الأول يضم خمسة مدافن (رقم: 50 - 54)، بينما يضم الجبل الثاني مدفناً وحيداً (رقم: 49)، وكذلك الجبل الثالث الذي يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم:55)، أما الجبل الرابع فيضم سبعة مدافن (رقم: 56 - 62)، وبالنسبة للجبل الخامس فهو يضم ستة عشر مدفناً (رقم: 63 - 78)، والجبل السادس يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 79)، بالإضافة إلى الجبل السابع الذي يضم ستة عشر مدفناً (رقم: 80 - 95)، والجبل الثامن يضم خمسة مدافن (رقم: 96 - 100)، والجبل التاسع يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 101).\n\nقصر الصانع\nتقع مجموعة قصر الصانع في الجهة الجنوبية من منطقة الحِجْر، وتتكون من كتلتين صخريتين. الكتلة الغربية تضم مدفناً واحداً يُعرف بقصر الصانع، حيث أن واجهته تعلوها شرفات مدرّجة في أسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش آخر يبرز بشكل أقل عن سابقه، تليه عارضتان يقع بينهما شريط فاصل، وتقع العارضة السفلى على عمودين ذات تيجان نبطية، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء الجنوبي من الواجهة، وعلى جانبه عمودان تيجانهما نبطية. بينما الكتلة الشرقية تحتوي على ستة مدافن وهي بسيطة في نحتها.\n\nقصر الفريد\nسمي بالقصر الفريد كونه يقع منفرداً في كتلة صخرية مستقلة، ولتميّزه معماريّاً حيث يتفرّد بوجود عمودين نبطيّين بوسط الجزء السفلي في واجهته الصخرية بالإضافة إلى الأعمدة الجانبية، ولكن المدفن غير مكتمل وخاصة في جزء الواجهة السفلي والبرحة الأمامية للمدخل، والنقش التأسيسي للمدفن غير مؤرخ.\nتوجد أعلى واجهة المدفن شرفات مدرّجة على الجانبين في أسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش آخر يحتوي على بروز أقل من السابق تليه عارضة، وعلى جانبه عمودين بتيجان نبطية، بالإضافة إلى عمودين آخرين في وسط الواجهة وهو الذي ميّزها عن باقي المدافن، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء السفلي من الواجهة، ومن عناصره المكتملة الإطار العام لكورنيش يظهر أعلاه نحت لنسر فارد جناحيه، بالإضافة إلى منحوتات لآنية تظهر على جانبي الكورنيش، كما يعلوه نقش تأسيسي نصّه «لحيان بن كوزا وذريته».\n\nمدافن المنطقة السكنية\nتقع مدافن المنطقة السكنية ضمن المنطقة السهلية التي تتوسط الموقع، ويحيط بها سور له آثار باقية من الجهات الشمالية والجنوبية والغربية، تتوسطها رموز دينية بارزة.\n\nالمنطقة الدينية\nتقع المنطقة الدينية في الجهة الشمالية للحِجْر وتحديداً في جبال إثلب، وكان قد اتخذها الأنباط مركزاً دينيّاً لهم، وتتكوّن المنطقة من الديوان والمعابد والمحاريب وقصر العجوز. يعتبر الديوان من أهم المنشآت الدينية فيها، وهو مكان مخصص للتجمعات الدينية، ويتكوّن من حجرة في الجبل وهي مستطيلة الشكل، كما أن مدخل الديوان مفتوح وعلى جانبه عمودان ذوا تيجان نبطيّة تعلوهما عارضة، وتوجد بالديوان ثلاث دكات منحوتة ومتصلة ببعضها وهي ترتفع عن سطح الأرض ويتم الصعود إليها عن طريق درج منحوت في جانبي المدخل، كما أن هناك أربعة أعمدة تيجانها نبطية يعلوها إفريز بارز وهي تقع في أركان الديوان، وهناك ممر ضيق مجاور للديوان يعرف بـ «السيق»، حيث تنتشر على جانبيه النقوش والمحاريب.\nتنتشر المعابد على مرتفعات جبل إثلب في منطقة الديوان وفي بطن منطقة المنخض الصخري، وهي تمثل المنطقة الدينية التي أنشئت للمعبودات الوثنية الخاصة بأهل الحِجْر. بالنسبة لقصر العجوز فهو معبد أو مركز للكهنة يقع إلى الجنوب من جبل إثلب، يتميز بكون مدخله مفتوح بحجم اتساع الحجرة المنحوتة، يوجد في الجدار الأيمن للحجرة كوَّتان مربعتان، بينما يوجد في الجدار الآخر خمس كوَّات، في يمينها مدخل يصل بحُجرة صغيرة.\nتتركز المحاريب في جنوب المنطقة الدينية، وهي من الأمور الدينية التي تتميز بها حضارة الأنباط، حيث تُجسّد فيها رموز معبوداتهم الوثنية، وقد حُفرت المحاريب في صخور تختلف في أشكالها وأحجامها، وهذه المحاريب عبارة عن تجاويب يتقدمها عمودان يحملان قوساً نصف دائري، في وسط كل محراب أو أعلاه نحت بارز يرمز للمعبودات الوثنية، وقد يكون بعض هذه المحاريب لا يحتوي على أي رموز.\n\nالمنطقة السكنية\nتقع المنطقة السكنية في وسط منطقة الحِجْر، في أرض سهلية منبسطة، وقد تم تحديد أسوار تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، كما كشفت الحفائر عن عدد من المراحل المعمارية التي قامت عليها، مما يدل على عُمق الاستيطان بالمنطقة، حيث تم الكشف عن وحدات معمارية ومبان طينية فوق أساسات حجريّة قامت عليها، وكانت تلك الأحجار تقطع من جبل المحجر وغيره من الجبال المجاورة، وبالإضافة إلى الأساسات فقد كانت الأحجار تستخدم في الأحواض الحجرية والأعمدة وتيجانها. تم العثور في المنطقة السكنية على العديد من الأشياء كالعملات والفخاريات والمساجر والمجامر والدمى وغيرها من الأشياء التي أُرِّخَت في الفترة النبطية.\n\nالآبار والقنوات المائية\nتوجد بالموقع مجموعة من الآبار والقنوات المائية، حيث عُثر على أكثر من ستين بئرا محفورة في الصخر، بعضها يصل عمقه لأكثر من ثلاثين متراً، وهي تتمثل بآبار دائرية المقطع يضيق قطرها من الأسفل وبعضها مطوي، فقد عُرِف عن الأنباط عنايتهم بالمياه وحفظها والتحكم بها عن طريق شبكة هندسية دقيقة، وقد ظل بعض هذه الآبار مستخدماً إلى وقتٍ قريب. أما فيما يتعلق بقنوات المياه فقد تم الكشف عن جزء منها، وهي مبنية من الحجر يتصل بعضها بصهاريج كانت تستخدم في تخزين المياه والتي هي الأخرى مبنية من الحجر ومبنية تحت الأرض، وبعض هذه الصهاريج يحتوي على فتحات لاستخراج المياه.\n\nالبئر النبطية\nالبئر النبطية عبارة عن بئر عميقة تقع قرب جبل المحجر ومجموعة القبور الموجودة حوله، وهي واحدة من خمسة وستين بئراً اكتشفت بالموقع، وكان قد استخدمها الأنباط في ري مزروعاتهم وسقياهم. حالياً البئر محاطة بسياج معدني يمنع النزول إليها، وهناك مجرى محفور في الصخور الواقعة في الجبل كان يستخدم في توجيه المياه من الجبل إلى البئر.\n\nمدافن الرجوم الركامية\nهنالك مدافن على شكل رجم من الحجارة يتراوح عرضه ما بين متر ونصف إلى عشرة أمتار، بينما يصل ارتفاع بعضها إلى المتر، تحتوي بعضها على دعامات بشكل سرداب. معظم هذه المدافن تقع على قمم التكوينات الصخرية الممتدة في الأجزاء الجنوبية والغربية من مدائن صالح، وقد تم تسجيل أكثر من 325 موقعاً. في 2008م أجريت حفريات أثرية للمدافن، حيث كانت قبل عملية الحفر تبدو كرجم من الحجارة بعرض سبعة أمتار وارتفاع متر، وبعد الحفر ظهر بأن هيكل المدفن عبارة عن مقبرة تتخذ شكل برج قطره 7,30 م يتكون من وحدتين بينهما فاصل بطول 1,90 م مليء بكتل حجرية، ويبدو أن المدفن يعود إلى الألف الثاني أو الثالث قبل الميلاد، حيث أنه يختلف عن الأسلوب النبطي، ويرجح أنه يرتبط بحضارة أخرى.\n\nطريق الحج الشامي\nفي العهد العثماني وفي سبيل حماية قوافل الحجاج تم إنشاء عدة قلاع على امتداد الطريق المؤدي إلى بلاد الشام، منها قلعة الحجر العثمانية في مدائن صالح، وهي عبارة عن مبنى مربّع الشكل مكوّن من طابقين، في شمالها يوجد المدخل ويعلوه برج للمراقبة، وهذا المدخل يؤدي إلى فناء داخلي يتوسطه بئر مطوي، وتتوزع حوله الغرف في جهاته الأربع، كما أن هناك مُصلّى صغير يقع في جنوب الفناء. في الطابق العلوي هناك أبراج تتوزع في أركان القلعة، كما تكثر فتحات السهام في الطابق، بالإضافة إلى ذلك توجد في جنوب القلعة بِرْكة تستمدّ ماؤها من البئر الموجودة هناك.\n\nسكة حديد الحجاز\nفي بداية القرن الرابع عشر الهجري الموافق للقرن العشرين الميلادي أمر السلطان عبد الحميد الثاني بإنشاء سكة حديد على أن تربط إسطنبول بالمدينة المنورة مروراً ببلاد الشام، وكان قد بدأ المشروع بالحط سنة 1317 هـ الموافقة لسنة 1899م وانتهى سنة 1325 هـ الموافقة بسنة 1907م، حيث كانت مدائن صالح إحدى محطاته الرئيسية، وقد احتوت المحطة على ستة عشر مبنى منها ورشة إصلاح القاطرات، وورشة إصلاح المحرّكات، ومبنيين للحراسة ومخازن للعفش، ومساكن للموظفين، واستراحات ودورات مياه مستقلة بالإضافة إلى خزّان للمياه، ظلّت المحطة مستخدمة إلى أن تعطلت الحركة بالسكة سنة 1336 هـ الموافقة لسنة 1918م.\n\nآثار قرية الحِجْر\nهناك آثار تتكون من بيوت طينية كانت سكناً لأناس من قبيلة عنزة، معظم هذه المباني تتكون من طابق واحد، ولا تشكل نسيجاً عمرانيّاً متصلاً، وذلك كونها تنتشر في أكثر من مكان داخل الموقع، وهي تمثّل أسلوب العمارة في الحِجْر في الماضي القريب.\n\nالسياحة\nتتميز مدائن صالح كونها إحدى أهم وأبرز الوجهات السياحية في السعودية، حيث أنه في سنة 2008، أعلنت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للعلوم والتربية والثقافة (اليونسكو) أن مدائن صالح موقع تراث عالمي، وبذلك أصبح أول موقع في السعودية ينضم إلى قائمة

          "content": "Mada’in Saleh (en arabe : مدائن صالح, Madā’in Ṣāliḥ) est un lieu situé dans le nord-ouest de l'Arabie saoudite, à 20 km au nord de l'oasis d'al-ʿUlā. On y trouve les vestiges de la cité nabatéenne d'Hégra (ou Al-Hijr) sur plus de 1000 hectares (3 km2) de désert. Son nom provient d'un personnage du Coran nommé Sâlih.\nLe site est occupé depuis le Néolithique, mais c'est durant l'Antiquité que l'oasis située sur la piste caravanière reliant Pétra au Hedjaz connait son apogée. Cela se traduit par le contrôle du site par les Nabatéens qui, s'inspirant de Pétra, y construisent 138 tombeaux rupestres monumentaux. Les méthodes de construction sont identiques, les bâtisseurs commençant par le haut des façades, détruisant après chaque étape de la construction la plateforme taillée à même le grès qu'ils utilisaient pour atteindre ces hauteurs. Après l'intégration de la Nabatène à l'empire romain au début du IIe siècle, ce dernier exerce un contrôle sur la route caravanière, mais ce sont ensuite les populations arabes qui prennent le relais. Ces derniers empruntent l'écriture nabatéenne pour créer la leur, d'où naît l'écriture arabe. La population locale ayant besoin de protection migre vers Al-'Ula, mieux protégée, et le site de Hégra perd son importance. Pendant la période musulmane, il devient une simple étape du pèlerinage à la Mecque. La ville est redécouverte par les européens à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nSurnommé la seconde Pétra au vu de la richesse de ses tombeaux taillés dans la roche, le site antique est reconnu par l'Unesco en 2008 sous le nom de site archéologique de Al-Hijr. Il devient le premier site d'Arabie saoudite à être inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial. Dès lors, le tourisme se développe et le gouvernement cherche à améliorer l'attractivité du site, ainsi que des oasis alentour, pour en faire un site touristique de premier plan.\n\nGéographie\nMada’in Saleh est situé à une vingtaine de kilomètres de l'oasis d'al-ʿUlā, à 400 km au nord-ouest de Médine et au carrefour entre la péninsule Arabique, la Syrie, la Jordanie et la Mésopotamie.\n\nSituation\nSitué au cœur du Hedjaz, Mada’in Saleh s'étend au pied du massif Harrat 'Uwayrid qui culmine à 1 840 mètres. Le site s’inscrit dans une plaine qui mesure 23 km du nord au sud et 15 km d'est en ouest. Bordée à l'ouest par le Harrat 'Uwayrid et par des massifs moins élevés au nord, à l'est et au sud, la plaine est traversée par un oued. Des buttes de grès plus ou moins distantes les unes des autres constituent la roche dans laquelle sont creusés les tombeaux rupestres monumentaux .\n\nGéologie\nLes formations de grès dans lesquels les tombes sont taillées datent du Cambrien. Depuis leur formation, la tectonique a modifié la morphologie du site, avec l'ouverture de la mer Rouge il y a 30 millions d'années. Ainsi, un réseau de diaclases se crée au sein des grès. À la fin du Miocène, l'érosion joue un rôle et le plateau de grès se disloque en plusieurs morceaux, dont seuls les plus résistants subsistent. Cela aboutit à la formation des buttes et des collines actuelles. Enfin, le Harrat 'Uwayrid, protégé par la couche de lave formée par l’activité volcanique au cours du Cénozoïque, s'est peu érodé par rapport au reste de la région.\n\nClimat\nLe climat de Mada’in Saleh est aride, sinon hyperaride, les conditions climatiques actuelles étant à peu près les mêmes qu'à l'époque antique.\nLes précipitations varient de 2 à 100 mm par an en moyenne. Les épisodes pluvieux sont rares, environ trois à quatre par an, mais ils peuvent être très violents et entraîner des inondations et des crues.\nLa température moyenne annuelle est de 22 °C, avec une moyenne hivernale de 12 °C et une moyenne estivale de 30 °C. Les pointes de température peuvent atteindre 0 °C en hiver et 45 °C en été. En mars, les premières grosses chaleurs s'accompagnent d'une prolifération de mouches. Des épisodes de vents violents, notamment d'un vent de sable chaud, le khamsin, surviennent au printemps ou au début de l'été.\n\nHydrologie et agriculture\nComme dans tout désert, les précipitations annuelles sont faibles. Les ressources en eau ne proviennent pas des pluies, mais d'une nappe phréatique fossile générée par les écoulements souterrains depuis le Harrat 'Uwayrid. Ce massif marqué par de nombreuses incisions ouest-est fait converger les eaux vers la plaine de Madâ'in Sâlih. C'est cette nappe qui a permis le développement du site urbain dans la région. Le prélèvement abondant et régulier de l'eau a permis de faire vivre les hommes depuis l'Antiquité. Cependant, l'introduction des pompes mécaniques a fait baisser le niveau de la nappe depuis les années 1970. Seuls 10 à 20 mm d'eau provenant du Harrat 'Uwayrid arrivent annuellement dans la nappe, ce qui permettait de garantir un niveau constant de la nappe qui s'est formée entre −10 000 à −7 000 ans avant J.-C..\nAu temps des Nabatéens, 130 puits ont été creusés dans les parties nord et nord-ouest du site. La géologie a permis la réalisation de puits de 7 mètres de diamètre pour une profondeur allant jusqu'à 17 mètres. Ces puits servent à l'irrigation et au développement de l'agriculture sur environ 400 hectares d'après les dernières recherches scientifiques. De plus, avec une concentration de chlorure de sodium dans le sol de 0,6 à 1%, seuls le palmier dattier, l'orge et les légumineuses peuvent être cultivés .\n\nFaune et végétation\nLa région de Mada’in Saleh se situe dans le domaine phytogéographique saharo-arabique, ou saharo-indien, car il couvre les régions désertiques comprises entre le Sahara et le sud du Pakistan. La flore la plus représentée dans la région est l'arbuste de la famille des amaranthacées, comme le Haloxylon salicornicum, un buisson ramifié presque sans feuilles d'environ 60 cm de hauteur et appelé \"rimth\" en arabe. D'autres arbustes et buissons sont présents, comme le pommier de Sodome ou l'épine du désert, de même qu'un grand nombre d'herbacées comme le pourpier, la luzerne sauvage, la mauve et l'anthémis, qui se développent annuellement à la faveur des pluies rares. Concernant les arbres, les acacias sont les plus présents. Le tamaris a été introduit pour réaliser des haies autour des zones cultivées et créer un écran contre le vent.\nLes recherches archéologiques permettent de connaitre la faune présente durant l'Antiquité. L'alimentation principale de la population était constituée de moutons et de chèvres, mais aussi de poissons (poissons perroquets et mérous) et d'oiseaux (autruches et poulets). La présence de dromadaires (nourriture des soldats romains) et d'équidés est également attestée. Les coquillages servent à fabriquer des pendentifs. Aujourd'hui, les animaux sauvages que l'on trouve dans la région sont le renard roux, le lièvre du Cap et le hérisson du désert. Chez les rongeurs, la présence de gerbilles, de souris épineuses et de rats des sables est aussi attestée. Les souris grises et les rats liés à la présence humaine sont aussi présents. Quant aux oiseaux, vautours fauves, aigles impériaux, faucons crécerelles, hirondelles du désert, guêpiers d'Orient, bulbuls d'Arabie ainsi que des corvidés, tourterelles, pigeons, pies-grièches peuplent le site. Le soir, on peut apercevoir des chauves-souris. Enfin, serpents, lézards et agames sont observables dans la cité.\n\nHistoire\nNéolithique\nLa présence humaine sur le site de Madâin Sâlih remonte à l'âge du bronze ancien. Il n'y a pas de trace d'occupation sédentaire, mais des tombes à cairn sont présentes. Il en existe quatre types. Ces dernières sont très répandues au Proche-Orient, mais difficiles à dater car pillées au fil du temps et peu de matériel archéologique est arrivé jusqu'à notre époque. Elles permettent néanmoins de dater la présence humaine d'entre le IVe et le IIIe millénaires av. J.-C. Une tombe typique est composée de deux éléments : une ou plusieurs structures formées de deux parements parallèles maçonnés, au centre desquels sont aménagés deux ou trois compartiments pouvant atteindre 2 m de long, et une tombe en forme de tour.\nDes restes humains datés de la fin du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. ont été trouvés dans un des compartiments d'une tombe située au sud-ouest du site de fouille, ainsi que quatre-vingt-deux perles en coquillages composant un ou plusieurs bracelets. Près de Tayma, à 115 km au nord-est de Madâin Sâlih, se trouvent d'autres tombes. Il peut s'agir d'une tradition funéraire propre à l’Arabie du Nord-Ouest.\n\nAntiquité\nPériode lihyanite\nLe site commence à être occupé de manière permanente à partir de la période lihyanite, entre le VIe et le IVe siècle av. J.-C. Cette occupation est confirmée par la présence d'inscriptions en caractères dadanites et araméens, mais aussi par la présence de graines, de charbon de bois et de céramiques dans la zone de fouille de la zone résidentielle.\n\nPériode pré-nabatéenne\nAvant l'arrivée des Nabatéens, la science ne permet pas de savoir si la population locale reste sous influence lihyanite ou bien d'une autre civilisation (d'une tribu d'Arabie du Nord ou des Minéens). Cela est dû au fait que le site se trouve sur la route terrestre de l'encens. Ainsi, les échanges commerciaux entre le IIIe siècle et le Ier siècle av. J.-C. se renforcent dans ce secteur. La découverte de trois cents pièces d'or d'influence grecque indique que le secteur a des liens avec la civilisation hellénistique, mais il est difficile de savoir quel roi est responsable du secteur. En effet, les tétradrachmes athéniens d'époque classique, qui présentent à l'avers une tête d'Athéna casquée et au revers une chouette avec les lettres grecques A-th-e (Alpha-théta-epsilon), sont facilement imitables et ne donnent aucun indice sur le souverain en place dans la région. Il est possible que ces pièces aient été frappées sur place et non pas importées lors d'échanges avec d'autres royaumes.\n\nPériode nabatéenne\nL'arrivée des Nabatéens dans la région date du milieu du Ier siècle av. J.-C. Le royaume nabatéen, en pleine expansion, cherche alors à sécuriser sa frontière sud et à accéder aux ports de la mer Rouge dans le cadre des routes commerciales développées à cette époque. Il espère aussi contrôler la voie commerciale terrestre, et Hégra devient la plaque tournante de ces échanges. Les Nabatéens, dotés d'une organisation militaire et administrative, contrôlent facilement cette région.\nL'expansion de la cité de Hégra commence et de nouveaux quartiers sont créés à l'est du ouadi. Un grand sanctuaire urbain se développe sur une butte rocheuse, et des maisons en briques crues sont remplacées par des maisons en pierre. Un plan de développement de la ville prend forme, mais il ne semble pas avoir été respecté sur l'ensemble du terrain. Ce projet semble soutenu par Arétas IV, au vu du nombre de pièces de monnaie retrouvées sur le site et portant l'inscription \"Hijrâ\". Un rempart en briques crues est construit vers la fin du Ier siècle av. J.-C. C'est pendant cette période que la spectaculaire nécropole rupestre est aménagée, tandis que les confréries religieuses se multiplient au sein de la cité. Hégra devient une ville de province à l'image de la capitale, Pétra. Afin de gérer la ville, un stratège assure l'administration de la région jusqu'à l'annexion romaine en 106 après J.-C.\n\nPériode romaine\nEn 106, à la suite du décès du dernier roi nabatéen Rabbel II, le sénateur romain Cornelius Palma pénètre avec ses troupes dans le pays. Le royaume devient alors une province romaine. Néanmoins, la découverte d'une inscription dans le Jabal Ithlib mentionnant le nom d'un roi postérieur au dernier roi indique la subsistance d'un pouvoir nabatéen. Ce n'est que cinq ans plus tard que les romains annoncent l'annexion du royaume.\nLa ville se transforme peu pendant la période romaine. En effet, elle est complètement excentrée vis à vis de Bosra, nouvelle capitale de cette province, et accessible uniquement par voie terrestre. Seul un fort où stationne la IIIe Légion cyrénaïque est construit, et le rempart réaménagé côté sud-est pour les besoins des Romains. La ville a désormais une vocation militaire, mais la culture reste nabatéenne. Elle demeure sous domination romaine jusqu'aux années 360, puis des chefs arabes sont désignés par les Romains pour gouverner. Contrairement au site de Pétra où des églises sont construites, aucune présence chrétienne n'est avérée à Hégra.\n\nMoyen Age\nLe site est quasiment inoccupé pendant la période islamique, les habitants ayant migré à Al-'Ula, plus facile à défendre. Seules quelques inscriptions gravées sur des tombes montrent que la région passe sous domination islamique. Le site devient alors une simple étape du pèlerinage à la Mecque.\n\nEpoque moderne\nUn fort ottoman est construit pour contrôler la région entre 1744 et 1757. Au début du XXe siècle, la plaine de Madâin Sâlih connaît un nouveau regain d'attractivité, avec la construction en 1907 du chemin de fer du Hedjaz par les Ottomans et les Allemands . Elle est alors une escale obligée pour les pèlerins musulmans faisant le hajj, qui partent de Damas ou d'autres lieux au nord. Ce chemin de fer est détruit et abandonné au cours de la Première Guerre mondiale.\nÀ la suite de fouilles archéologiques, la zone est devenue un site touristique.\n\nArchitecture\nGénéralités\nComme Pétra, il s'agit d'une grande ville pour l'époque, qui possède des places, des rues et un important réseau d'irrigation pour les terres agricoles des alentours, ainsi que des aqueducs et des puits amenant l'eau à la ville. Elle servait peut-être aussi de poste militaire, étant à 20 km au nord du royaume de Dédân.\nEnviron 130 tombes rupestres à façades monumentales sont creusées sur le modèle de celles de Pétra, majoritairement sous le règne du roi Arétas IV (9 av. J.C. - 40 apr. J.-C.). La technique de taille a été reconstituée, les tailleurs commençant par le haut. A la différence de Pétra, beaucoup d'inscriptions nabatéennes accompagnant ces tombes sont gravées dans la roche, indiquant les noms des propriétaires.\n\nFouilles archéologiques\nTraces historiques\nCette ville est mentionnée plusieurs fois dans le Coran. La sourate 15 notamment porte son nom : Al-Hijr. Sont aussi mentionnés le peuple qui habitait la cité, les Thamoudéens, et le prophète Sâlih qui lui a donné son nom.\n\nRedécouverte par les Européens au XIXe siècle\nLe voyageur Jean-Louis Burkhardt (1784-1817) rapporte ces récits sur Pétra en 1811. Puis Richard Francis Burton (1853), Heinrich von Maltzan (1860), Christiaan Snouck (1885) et William Palgrave le visitèrent à leur tour. En 1888, Charles Montagu Doughty publie ses Travels in Arabia Deserta, un récit des voyages qu'il effectua en 1876 à Tayma, Madâin Sâlih, Khaybar, Haïl, Bereida, Aneiza et Taëf.\n\nFouilles au XXe siècle\nAu XXe siècle, les premiers voyageurs européens à avoir documenté leurs visites à Hégra sont Antonin Jaussen et Raphaël Savignac, des frères dominicains et archéologues basés à Jérusalem. Ils explorèrent la ville de 1907 à 1910 et écrivirent un livre détaillant leurs découvertes, titré Mission archéologique en Arabie. Ils datent les inscriptions sur les tombes du Ier siècle, les plus raffinées étant celles du règne du roi nabatéen Arétas IV (de l'an 9 av. J.-C. à l'an 40).\n\nFouilles franco-saoudiennes au XXIe siècle\nDepuis 2001, des fouilles ont permis de trouver de petits monuments inédits, isolés ou groupés et dispersés. Les chercheurs ont essayé de comprendre les pratiques cultuelles des anciens Nabatéens.\nLe site est étudié depuis le début des années 2000 par une mission archéologique franco-saoudienne, co-dirigée par Dhaifallah al-Talhi et Laïla Nehmé, chercheuse au CNRS. Tous les tombeaux rupestres pillés dans l'Antiquité ont été fouillés. Un seul tombeau inviolé a été découvert, permettant d'étudier plus précisément les rites funéraires des Nabatéens. Dans la ville d'Al-'Ula, au sud du site, les fouilles ont porté sur des secteurs d'habitations, un sanctuaire au centre de la ville, une porte fortifiée et un fort d'époque romaine dans le sud de la ville.\nParmi les monuments récemment découverts, un sanctuaire rupestre, le Qasr al-Ajuz, au sud-ouest de Jabal Ithlib (al-Hijr), se compose d'une salle creusée dans une colline et garnie de niches à bétyles. Au sommet, des vestiges inédits ont été découverts, dont 11 niches horizontales creusées dans la roche qui devaient être des autels pour bétyles. À cet endroit se trouvent également des fosses peu profondes : cupules et petits canaux, certainement des lieux de sacrifice.\nL'ensemble forme une voie processionnelle miniature où les adorateurs se réunissaient d'après les chercheurs. Ces derniers concluent que l'intérieur est un haram, un lieu sacré à accès restreint. À la différence de Pétra, ce sanctuaire est un centre cultuel des thiases, dont l'espace limité était partagé entre différentes divinités . Quelques rares exemples d'autres sanctuaires pré-islamiques à ciel ouvert ont également été découverts dans le Sinaï et le Néguev, confirmant la persistance dans ces régions isolées de cultes païens jusqu'au début de l'Islam. Le mihrab se serait ainsi substitué au bétyle.\nDe nombreuses inscriptions antiques ont été retrouvées : inscriptions lihyanites (les plus anciennes datant des derniers siècles avant J.-C.), nabatéennes (datant du Ier siècle, époque durant laquelle la cité faisait partie du royaume nabatéen), grecques et latines (des IIe et IIIe siècles, époque durant laquelle la cité faisait partie de l'Empire romain).\n\nTourisme\nL'aéroport Al-'Ula est ouvert depuis fin 2010 (auparavant les aéroports les plus proches étaient Haïl et Al Wajh). L'accès au site, implanté à 23 km au Nord d'Al-'Ula, se fait par la route 70, en suivant la direction signalée par \"Antiquités\". Une autorisation d'accès est nécessaire, à faire établir par une agence ou un hôtel, et à présenter sur le site avec un passeport et un visa.\n\nAttentat du 26 février 2007\nLe 26 février 2007, un groupe d'expatriés français revenant du site archéologique est attaqué par des hommes affiliés à Al-Qaïda. Les terroristes ouvrent le feu et abattent trois personnes. Une quatrième, un adolescent, décède le lendemain de ses blessures. Pour ce crime, deux Saoudiens ont été exécutés en 2014.\n\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nLaïla Nehmé, Archéologie aux pays des Nabatéens d'Arabie : Guide de Hégra, Paris, Hémisphères éditions, 2019, 261 p.

          "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Mada’in Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح, romanized: madāʼin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας Mathousalas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Mada’in Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Mada’in Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Mada’in Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

          "summary": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Mada’in Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح, romanized: madāʼin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.",

          "content": "## Overview\nHegra (ٱلْحِجْر al-Ḥijr), also Madain Saleh (مدائن صالح) is a large archaeological site in Hejaz, Saudi Arabia.\n\n## History\nFounded in the 3rd century BC, Hegra was the second capital of the Nabataean Kingdom. A city hewed out of rock in the same style as the first capital, Jordan's far more famous Petra, Hegra has been a  UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008, and would be a top tourist draw in any other country than Saudi Arabia. With the introduction of tourist visas by the Saudi government in 2019, it has now become easier for foreigners to visit, and there is now a concerted government effort in progress to build up tourist infrastructure and awareness of the site.\n\n## Climate\nLocated at an elevation of 600m in the Hejaz Mountains, winter is high season at Hegra, with average daily highs a pleasant 20-28°C and lows dipping down to 10°C between November and March. The mercury starts really cranking up in May and by July it's often above 40°C for weeks on end.\n\n## Get in\nThe nearest town is Al-Ula, 22 km away from Hegra. Al-Ula has a small international airport that fields flights to major regional destinations.  Saptco also runs direct buses to Al-Ula from major towns including Jeddah (8 hr) and Riyadh (13½ hr).  See Al-Ula for details.\n\n## Fees and permits\nEntry to the actual archeological sites of Hegra is only possible by participating on an official tour organized by the official government tour agency Experience Al Ula. Tickets can either be bought online in advance on their website, or by visiting their official ticket office in the 26.6647137.905021 Winter Park Visitor Center, a public park and parking lot about 5 km north of the Old Town of Al Ula. The Winter Park Visitor Center is also the meeting point and departure point of all tours going to all important sightseeing sites, including Hegra.\nVisitors are then being put into a tour group and headed by bus to the 26.7702937.945582 Hegra Visitor Center, the actual entrance of Hegra, about a 16-km bus ride north of the Winter Park.\nThe regular guided Day Tour to Hegra (SR 95 per person) usually takes about 3 hours, and includes the most important archeological sites. While the quality of the English-speaking guide and their knowledge meets high standards, the regular Hegra Day Tour may appear a bit rushed to visitors. This is specifically relevant to visitors who want to take their time for pictures or to explore the individual tombs. There are other, more expensive individual tour options like the Hegra Vintage Land Rover Tour or Hegra Night Tour.\n\n## Get around\nIf you are staying at one of the fancy hotels, you will most likely get arranged a transport to the Winter Park Visitor Center and to all the other relevant locations in the region.\nIf you are travelling independently, it's highly recommended to get around by rental car. Most of the sites, including the Winter Park Visitor Center, have large parking lots and are designed for individual car drivers in mind as well.\nThere is also a free golf cart shuttle service operating between the Northern and Southern Parking Lot of the Old Town of Al-Ula. Just hop on one of these golf carts driven by friendly ladies and they will be bring you there within about 3 minutes.\n\n## Within archaeological park\nHegra's sights are divided across a number of different necropolis sites containing monumental tombs. The naming of the tombs and sites is not standardized, being described variously as qasr (castle), jabal (mountain) or after inscriptions found in the tombs. Access to the sites is only possible via guided tour taking in a set itinerary.\n26.7739737.961221 Qaṣr al-Farīd (Lonely Castle, Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza) (2km east of South Gate). The most iconic site at Hegra, this tomb stands 23 meters high and proudly alone.   (updated Jan 2025)\n26.7928337.955512 Jabal al-Mahjar. Tombs cut on the eastern and western sides of four parallel rock outcrops. Façade decorations are small in size.    (updated Jan 2025)\n26.7831437.94183 Jabal al-Khuraymat. The largest necropolis, consisting of numerous outcrops separated by sandy zones, although only eight of the outcrops have cut tombs, totaling 48 in quantity. The poor quality of sandstone and exposure to prevailing winds resulted to the poor state of conservation of most façades.    (updated Jan 2025)\n26.788537.96014 Jabal al-Banat. Contains the largest of all Hegra tombs, the Qasr al-Bint, a series of tombs carved up to 16 meters high.    (updated Jan 2025)\n\n## Outside archaeological park\nThese sites are outside the park and can be visited independently.\n26.68910537.9816515 Elephant Rock (Jabal al-Fil) (about 10 km east of the Winter Park Visitor Center). A very picturesque rock formation and scenic place to take pictures from the surrounding rocks. The actual bottom of Elephant Rock can only be accessed by paying entrance fee of a café that surrounds the whole rock. If you are an independent camper, you can also spend the night about 500 m south of Elephant rock and gaze at the illuminated rock at night.    (updated Jun 2024)\n27.04944837.7660356 Rainbow Arch (by car, it's  about a 60-km ride north of the Old Town of Al-Ula; the last 6 km until the rock arch have to be traversed over a unpaved road, but it is doable without 4x4). A bit off the beaten path, but highly recommended. A giant rock arch of about 100 m length, picturesquely located inside a rocky valley. Free admittance.    (updated Jun 2024)\n\n## Do\n26.64683437.9138741 Nabatean Rock Carving Workshop (At the Dadan Visitor Center. Cannot be visited independently though.). It is usually part of the Jabal Ikhmal Day Tour. Visitors can carve their name in ancient Nabatean language onto small rocks, which they can take home as souvenirs afterwards.    (updated Jun 2024)\n\n## Eat\nThe Old and New Towns of Al-Ula have a wide range of restaurants.  On site in Hegra, though, the only eating option as of 2025 is a gelato cart in the Visitor Center.\n\n## Drink\n26.82715437.8520521 Shalal Cafe (A very picturesque café located within spectacular rock formations and can only be entered through a narrow rock canyon.) (about 28 km north of the Old Town of Al-Ula), ☏ +966 533560914. 07:00-12:00, 15:00-23:00. Entry 10 SR.    (updated Jun 2024)\n\n## Sleep\nStaying overnight at Hegra is not allowed, so most visitors sleep in the vicinity of the Old Town of Al-Ula or in one of the resorts scattered around. Prices for accommodations in this part are being considered very high (also for Saudi Arabian standards), and there is almost no selection of budget hotels.\nIf you plan to sleep in your own car, caravan or camping equipment, the staff at the Winter Park Visitor Center recommends spending the night in front of the iconic Elephant Rock.\n26.68482437.9796221 Camping Spot at Elephant Rock (about 500 m south of Elephant Rock, in front of the rocks). Free.    (updated Jun 2024)\n\n## Stay safe\nAl-Ula/Hegra is as safe as the rest of Saudi Arabia. However, three French nationals were killed in the area in 2007, presumably by terrorists. Since then the region is considered safe though, and annually the inflow of tourists is increasing dramatically.\n\n## Contact\n26.66397637.9056021 Experience Al-Ula (Official local government tourist and booking agency), Winter Park Visitor Center (about 5 km north of Al-Ula Old Town), ☏ +966 559799839. 07:00-17:00.    (updated Jun 2024)\n\n## Go next\nKhaybar — around 217 km south-east of Al-Ula, is a ruined ancient city with a fortress on a hill, overlooking a surreal volcanic terrain. It is being developed as a tourist day tour spot, and cannot be visited independently. There are day tours planned departing from Al-Ula.\nTrain Wreck at Hadiyyah Fort / Hejaz Railway — around 170 km south-east of Al-Ula, is an impressive ruined train station with a derailed steam locomotive train from the First World War. It is fenced off tightly and not accessible by foot, most likely being developed as a tourist day tour spot.\nJubbah — about a 445-km car ride north-east of Al-Ula, is famous for its ancient petroglyphs and rock carvings. It can also be reached as day trip from the more accessible city Hail.\nMedina — about a 330-km car ride south-east of Al-Ula, is commonly referred to as the \"cradle of Islamic culture and civilisation\". It is Islam's second holiest city. Non-Muslims are allowed to visit the city, with exception of entry to the Great Prophet's Mosque.\nYanbu — about a 360-km car ride south of Al-Ula, is famous for its Red Sea scuba diving options and petrochemical industry.",

          "content": "al-Ula (Arabic: ٱلْعُلَا‎, romanized: al-ʿUlā), officially AlUla, is an ancient Arabian oasis city and governorate located in Medina Province, Saudi Arabia, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the city of Medina. Situated in the Hejaz, a region that features prominently in the history of Islam as well as several pre-Islamic Semitic civilizations, al-Ula was a market city on the historic incense trade route that linked India and the Persian Gulf to the Levant and Europe.\nFrom an archaeological perspective, the immediate vicinity contains a unique concentration of precious artifacts, including well-preserved ancient stone inscriptions that illustrate the development of the Arabic language, and a concentration of rock dwellings and tombs that date from the Nabatean and Dedanite periods that coincided with Greco-Roman influence during classical antiquity. Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hegra (also known as al-Hijr, or Mada'in Ṣalih), is located 22 km (14 miles) north of the city, in al-Ula governorate. Built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans, Hegra is often compared with its sister city of Petra, in Jordan. Meanwhile, the ancient walled oasis city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dirah, situated near the oasis's palm grove that allowed for its settlement, contains a dense cluster of mudbrick and stone houses. al-Ula was also the capital of the ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites).\nThe Jabal Ikmah epigraphs and petroglyphs are located in the mountains around al-Ula. In 2023, they have been inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register. Dating back to the second half of the first millennium BCE, they played a significant role in the evolution of Old Arabic languages and dialects. Carved in sandstone, these nearly 300 inscriptions are written in the pre-Nabataean Arabic languages Aramaic, Dadanitic, Thamudic, and Minaic.\nToday, the city of al-Ula is within the Governorate of al-Ula, one of seven constituent counties of Medina province. The city is located 110 km (68 miles) southwest of Tayma and 300 km (190 miles) north of Medina. The city (municipality) covers 2,391 square kilometres (923 sq mi), and has a population of 60,103 as of 2022. In addition to the ancient old town al-Dīrah, a more recent historical and adjacent settlement, al-Judaydah, displaying the settlement patterns of Arabic-Islamic urbanism, remains occupied and is currently experiencing a redesign. Since the 1980s, the oasis of al-Ula has experienced significant agricultural and urban growth. Since then, the settled Bedouins have been added to the population of Sedentary people and, as in the rest of the kingdom, a large population of immigrant workers.\nThe area is also known for its striking landscape of rocks, canyons, and wadis, and the contrast between these dry surroundings and the lush, palm-filled oases near the city's centre.\nThe oasis of al-Ula was once a key stop on the Hejaz railway, linking Damascus to Medina.\n\nHistory\nThe oasis of al-Ula has had permanent human settlement since 5000 BCE, through the Bronze Age.\nThe walled city of al-Ula was founded as an oasis in the desert valley, with fertile soil and plenty of water. It was located along Incense trade route, the network of routes that facilitated the trading of spices, silk and other luxury items through the Kingdom of Aksum, Arabia, Egypt, and India. The oasis of al-Ula stands on the site of the Biblical city of Dedan but was founded with the ancient North Arabian kingdom of Lihyan, which ruled from the 5th to 2nd century BCE.\nThe older history of the oasis has been divided into several phases. The Dedanite kingdom spans the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. Dedan is mentioned in the Harran Stela. In these it is told how Nabonidus, last ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, made a military campaign to northern Arabia in 552 BCE or somewhat later, conquering Tayma, Dedan, and Yathrib (now Medina). It is thought that around the turn of the 5th century BCE, the kingdom became hereditary.\n\nThe next four hundred years, until around 100 BCE, was the period of Lihyanite kingdom. The Nabataeans were also the lords of the region at least until 106 CE, when the Roman Empire conquered and annexed it in their Arabia Petraea province.\n\nAl-Mabiyat, some 20 km (12 miles) away near Mughayrah became the next commercial centre of the region. It thrived from around 650 CE until it declined at some time before 1230. In the 13th century, the old city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dīrah, was built, and many stones of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite ruins were reused. The oasis of al-Ula now became the major settlement of the region again until modern times. Between 1901 and 1908 the Ottomans built the Hejaz railway in order to link Damascus to Medina. The railway had main stations in both Madā'in Ṣaliḥ (Hegra) and al-Ula, where a line was built through the western part of al-Khuraybah, some 12 km (7.5 miles) to the north of the old medieval town, which is believed to be the site of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite town that is still standing there despite being in bad shape.\nIn the 20th century, the new town centre was established beside the old town, and eventually, the people left the old buildings. The last family is said to have gone in 1983, while the last service in the old mosque was held in 1985. Both the ruins of the medieval town al-Dīrah and the site of the Liyhanite settlement now lie within the limits of the modern town.\nThe most detailed study of the area was made by the French priests Antonin Jaussen and Raphaël Savignac, who visited the area three times, in 1907, 1908 and 1910. They studied the remains at Hegra and Dedan and collected a large number of Lihyanite, Minaean, Thamudic, and Nabataean inscriptions. Accordingly, it was their work that came to constitute the basis for all further study and research in the area's history.\nThe first European traveller of modern times to describe the town was Charles Doughty in 1876. Charles Huber was in al-Ula in 1881–1882. He returned in 1883 accompanied by Julius Euting. In 1968 a team of archaeologists from the University of London investigated 15 inscriptions.\nThe vertical sandstone cliffs surrounding the valley provide ample surfaces for rock art, making the governorate one of the richer petroglyph regions in the Kingdom. Ar-Ruzeiqiah is a mountain in the southern part of the governorate, with a large petroglyph panel displaying hundreds of images, including depictions of hunting scenes with humans and a variety of animals. Ibex are the most common species but camels, horses and other species can also be found. Mount Ikma also has a large façade with scenes, strange symbols, and inscriptions.\n\nTimeline\nThe following is the sequence of historical events and the ancient evidence found in the al-Ula governorate:\n\nAdministration\nThere are four major municipalities in the Governorate of al-Ula: al-Ula, the capital lying to the southwest (population 5,426); Mughayrāʾ (Arabic: مُغِيْرَاء) to the southeast (population 8,952); Abu Raku, to the north (population 2,678); and al-Ḥijr to the northeast (population 1,707).\n\nHeritage Village\nal-Ula Heritage Village, also known as Al-Dīrah, is the traditional Arabian village to which people of the oasis moved some eight centuries ago and inhabited until the 20th century. It was built on a higher part of the valley in order to be clear of the floods that can occur during the rainy season. At its maximum expansion the town contained more than 1000 houses, which were built adjacent to one another, thereby forming a wall around the town to defend the population. On the west of the town, at the bottom of the cliff, is the old souq, which has been renovated.\n\nRoyal Commission for al-Ula\nThe importance of al-Ula as an archaeological and historic site led to the establishment of The Royal Commission for al-Ula (RCU) in July 2017, the aim of which is to develop and promote al-Ula as an international tourism destination. Moreover, the commission develops the plans for heritage conservation and preservation. The Royal commission for al-Ula, along with al-Ula Development Company, have taken various development projects in the region, including the five districts planned for al-Ula by 2030. The five districts include: al-Ula old town, Dadan, Jabal Ikmah, Nabataeane Horizen, and Hegra Historical City. These five districts are part of a larger development plan for al-Ula that further aims to transform the city into a world-class tourist destination while also preserving its cultural and historical heritage.\n\nDevelopment plan\nTo promote tourism and gain more attraction, the Royal Commission for al-Ula is training 200 young Saudis on an ambitious project where tourists will explore the area's cultural treasures. Recruited from the al-Ula region, the 200 young people (all high-school age or in their first year as university students, and split equally between boys and girls) are in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia being trained in hospitality, learning new languages, studying farming and water technology, and researching the cultural, social and natural history of their home region.\nIn January 2023, the Public Investment Fund launched Al-Ula Development Company, a hospitality and real estate developer which aims to turn al-Ula into a global tourist destination.\n\nal-Ula International Airport\nThe Airport was a crucial part of the development strategy of the Royal Commission for al-Ula, which envisioned making it a global destination for culture and tourism. In March 2021, the airport was approved to receive international flights, along with an increased capacity of receiving 15 commercial flights at a time. The capacity was increased from 100,000 to 400,000 passengers per year.\n\nTourism\nThe Saudi Arabian government is collaborating with experts from around the world on the al-Ula development. In April 2018 it signed a 10-year deal with France that included provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum. Since 2021, the Royal Commission of al-Ula has been running SME accelerator in collaboration with AstroLabs to ensure growth of the local tourism ecosystem. With this program, the region has set out on an ambitious mission to welcome 2 million tourists and contribute SAR 120Bn to the national GDP by 2030.\nA major integrated archaeological survey of al-Ula valley and beyond was launched by the commission, charged with protecting and regenerating the north-western region. While a conservation and development plan was established, some of the sites including the World Heritage Site of Madā'in Ṣaliḥ were closed to the public, but have been open since 2020 for visitors.\nWith the easing of visa process for international travelers, al-Ula attracts more tourists from abroad. Its most popular sites are: al-Ula Old town, Oasis Heritage Trail, Hegra UNESCO Heritage Site, Dadan, Jabal Ikmah, Jabal AlFil (Elephant Rock), Harrarat Viewpoint or Maraya Concert Hall. Travelers from around the world can also enjoy numerous of activities such as stargazing, desert dune bashing, desert campaign, hiking, biking, rock climbing, via ferrata and others.\n\nAccommodation in al-Ula\nAs the tourism infrastructure, aiming at tourism de luxe, is still being developed in al-Ula, finding affordable accommodation can be a challenge during high season. Tourists have a variety of options ranging from camping sites, holiday homes (apartments or chalets) to luxury resorts. As of 2023, al-Ula is home to 10 luxury resorts and accommodations available for visitors of the old city.\n\n\"Winter at Tantora\" festival\nWinter at Tantora was a traditional celebration to mark the start of the 40-day winter growing season. The name of the festival, 'Tantora', is inspired by a sundial located in the Old Town of al-Ula, which has been in use by the locals as a marker for the changing of the seasons. On 20 December 2018, the first \"Winter at Tantora\" started with a series of different themed weekend events including music, arts, entertainment, and cultural events. The concerts were performed in Maraya Concert Hall, which was newly design and constructed by Giò Forma Studio and Black Engineering for this purpose, and whose external walls are covered with mirrors, maraya being the Arabic word for 'mirrors'. A second edition of Winter at Tantora Festival was held on 19 December 2019, and included performances by Omar Khairat, EBI \"Ebrahim hamedi\", Andrea Bocelli, Yanni, Enrique Iglesias, and Lionel Richie.\nOn 26 December 2019, Maraya Concert Hall set a Guinness World Record for the largest mirrored building in the world, in which it was covered by 9,740 square metres (104,800 sq ft) of mirrored façade.\n\nAzimuth Festival\nAs part of the \"Winter at Tantora\" festival, Saudi Arabia hosted a three-day festival of music, art and food. Held between 5–7 March 2020, the Azimuth Festival was an event that brought the east and west together at al-Ula. It marked performances from artists like the Chainsmokers, Jean-Michel Jarre, Tinie Tempah and others. The event took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so received only little publicity.\n\nPersian Night in Saudi Arabia's al-Ula\nFrom 6 to 7 March 2020, a large concert of Iranian singers was held at the winter celebration of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the city of al-Ula. Ebi, Leila Forouhar, Shahram Shabpareh, Shadmehr Aghili, Andy (Andranik Madadian), Arash and Sasy were present at the concert.\n\nal-Ula Vision\nOn 11 February 2019, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the al-Ula vision which features a resort and nature reserve called Sharaan. The vision also includes the establishment of the Global Fund for the protection and revitalization of the Arabian leopard. al-Ula provides an opportunity for numerous international companies to benefit from the ambitious plans. Some notable companies are already working on and benefiting from the al-Ula project: AECOM, JAL International, Nesma & Partners, Alstom, KUN Investment Holding and others.\n\nClimate\nGallery\nSee also\nAl-Ula Development Company\nSarat Mountains\nHijaz Mountains\nHijaz Railway\nMawqaq\nTeam Jayco–AlUla, a cycling team partly sponsored by the city\nThe temple of Mahlab al-Naqa\nAl-Ula FC\nAl-Ahsa Oasis\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary, Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān, The civilization of two cities: Al-ʻUlā & Madāʼin Sāliḥ, 2001, ISBN 9960-9301-0-6, ISBN 978-9960-9301-0-7\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-'Ula at Wikimedia Commons\n\nRoyal Commission for AlUla website",
          "summary": "al-Ula (Arabic: ٱلْعُلَا‎, romanized: al-ʿUlā), officially AlUla, is an ancient Arabian oasis city and governorate located in Medina Province, Saudi Arabia, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the city of Medina. Situated in the Hejaz, a region that features prominently in the history of Islam as well as several pre-Islamic Semitic civilizations, al-Ula was a market city on the historic incense trade route that linked India and the Persian Gulf to the Levant and Europe.\nFrom an archaeological perspective, the immediate vicinity contains a unique concentration of precious artifacts, including well-preserved ancient stone inscriptions that illustrate the development of the Arabic language, and a concentration of rock dwellings and tombs that date from the Nabatean and Dedanite periods that coincided with Greco-Roman influence during classical antiquity. Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hegra (also known as al-Hijr, or Mada'in Ṣalih), is located 22 km (14 miles) north of the city, in al-Ula governorate. Built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans, Hegra is often compared with its sister city of Petra, in Jordan. Meanwhile, the ancient walled oasis city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dirah, situated near the oasis's palm grove that allowed for its settlement, contains a dense cluster of mudbrick and stone houses. al-Ula was also the capital of the ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites).\nThe Jabal Ikmah epigraphs and petroglyphs are located in the mountains around al-Ula.

          "content": "AlUla (en arabe : العلا, DMG al-‘Ulā) - également transcrite Al Ula, Al-Ula, ou Al-’Ula - est une oasis de la province de Médine, dans le nord-ouest de l'Arabie saoudite. Elle est située à environ 200 km au sud-ouest de Taymā’ et à 400 km au nord-ouest de Médine.\n\nDescription\nL'agglomération oasienne d'AlUla totalise 40 000 habitants. Bâtie sur un site qui correspond au Dadan de la Bible, elle fut dans l'Antiquité la capitale du royaume de Lihyan, sur la route de l'encens.\nDe nombreuses inscriptions gravées dans les anciennes langues locales, le lihyanite, le dadanite et le nabatéen (des formes de langues nord-arabiques), du VIe au Ier siècle av. J.-C., ont été recensées dans la région. L'oasis s'est développée comme une oasis-carrefour dans le désert, en raison de l'importance du commerce de l'encens, au moins du IIe siècle av. J.-C. au début du Ier siècle av. J.-C., sous la domination du royaume de Ma'in. Depuis les années 1980, elle a connu un essor agricole et urbain important. Depuis, à la population de sédentaires se sont ajoutés les Bédouins sédentarisés et, comme dans le reste du royaume, une importante population de travailleurs immigrés.\n\nTourisme\nÀ 23 km au nord du centre d'AlUla se trouve le site archéologique de Madā’īn Ṣāliḥ, classé au patrimoine mondial par l’Unesco. Il abrite des vestiges d'époques lihyanite, dadanite, nabatéenne puis romaine. On y trouve en particulier des tombes à façades monumentales, creusées dans le rocher dans le même style que celles de Pétra en Jordanie. Cette nécropole est celle de l'ancienne cité de Hégra, implantée à la frontière sud du royaume nabatéen. Au tournant du premier millénaire, ce royaume s'étendait des environs de Bosra en Jordanie à AlUla.\nUn musée d'archéologie et de patrimoine populaire, ouvert en 1987, mais fermé par la Royal Commission for AlUla en 2021, présentait l'histoire de la région à partir des sites archéologiques d'al -‘Ulā et de Mada'in Saleh.\nL'actuel prince héritier du royaume saoudien, Mohammed ben Salmane, ambitionne de développer le tourisme dans la région, en créant un parc naturel, touristique, archéologique et culturel d'une superficie équivalente à la Belgique. C'est un organisme ad-hoc, la Royal Commission for AlUla, qui est chargé par la couronne du développement de la région depuis 2017. Elle a autorité pour prendre toutes les initiatives locales qui lui semblent nécessaires au développement du projet touristique. L'Arabie saoudite a souhaité que la France contribue à ce projet. Outre l’ingénierie culturelle, la recherche et la muséographie, ce projet colossal doit aussi comprendre d’autres secteurs, dont la construction des infrastructures, notamment routières, ferroviaires et hôtelières. Un accord intergouvernemental entre les deux pays a été signé en ce sens en avril 2018 à l'Élysée, entre le président Macron et le prince héritier Mohammed ben Salmane. Le coût du projet, dont l’essentiel serait réalisé en cinq ou dix ans, s'élèverait entre 50 et 100 milliards de dollars (40,5 à 81 milliards d’euros). La gestion de ce programme, côté français, a été confiée à l'agence créée à cette fin, l'Agence française pour le développement d'AlUla (Afalula). \nDans ce cadre, plusieurs équipes d'archéologues français et étrangers y conduisent des fouilles. Un projet d'hôtel troglodytique conçu par Jean Nouvel devrait y voir le jour. La construction d'un tramway est à l'étude et a été confiée à la société Alstom, sur un tracé qui suivra schématiquement une portion de l'ancienne ligne du chemin de fer du Hedjaz. Le Centre Pompidou AlUla sera une annexe du musée parisien et doit ouvrir en 2027-2028.\n\nGalerie : inscriptions et art antiques d'al-‘Ulā, Ve – Ier siècle av.

En raison de son importance pour le commerce de l'encens, elle a été plus tard, au moins du IIe siècle av. J.-C. au début du Ier siècle apr. J.-C., sous la domination du royaume de Ma'in.\n\nDadan dans la Bible\nJean-François Salles identifie trois séries de textes relatives à Dedan dans la tradition biblique : dans la Genèse d'abord, où son nom apparaît en tant que personnage dans la généalogie des Patriarches. Les origines de Dedân remonteraient à Noé (Gen. 10, 7) ou à Abraham (Gen. 25, 3). Dans les deux cas, Dedân est étroitement associée à Sheba (ou Saba). Cette phase ancienne est également évoquée dans les sources arabes (Yäqüt). \nEnsuite, le caractère caravanier d'un groupe humain nommé Dadanites apparaît dans le livre d'isaïe : « Dans la brousse, dans la steppe, vous passez la nuit, caravanes des Dedânites » (21, 13 : oracle sur les Arabes 45).\nDédan apparaît enfin dans l'évocation du commerce oriental que constitue la « complainte sur la chute de Tyr » d'Ezéchiel : « Les fils de Dedân trafiquaient avec toi ; des rivages nombreux étaient tes clients ; les défenses d'ivoire et l'ébène te servaient de paiement » (27, 15). Dadan fait aussi partie des villes contre lesquelles Jérémie prophétise (Dedân, Téma, Buz, tous les hommes aux tempes rasées 25:23).\n\nRecherches archéologiques\nDadan a été fouillée par les pères dominicains Antonin Jaussen et Raphaël Savignac, de l'école biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem. Trois campagnes de fouilles (1907, 1909 et 1910) ont permis de dégager un intéressant patrimoine (statues, inscriptions ...).\n\nNotes et références\nLiens internes\nAnciennes cités d'Arabie saoudite\nHistoire de l'Arabie préislamique\nRoute de l'encens : Tabuk, Thamud, Tayma, Al-'Ula\n Portail de l’Arabie saoudite   Portail de l’archéologie   Portail du Proche-Orient ancien",

          "content": "Diriyah (Arabic: الدِرْعِيّة, romanized: ad-Dir‘īyah, lit. 'place of armor'; formerly romanized as Dereyeh and Dariyya) is a town and governorate in Saudi Arabia. Located on the northwestern outskirts of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Diriyah was the original home of the House of Saud, and served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1727 to 1818. Today, the town is the seat of the Diriyah Governorate, which also includes the villages of Uyayna, Jubayla, and Al-Ammariyyah, among others—and is part of Riyadh Province.\nAt-Turaif District, the first capital of Saudis in Diriyah, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. The layout of the city itself can be studied in the National Museum of Saudi Arabia with the help of a large-scale detailed model of the city on display there. Diriyah also hosted the Diriyah ePrix race for the Formula E championship from 2018–2024.\n\nLocation\nThe ruins of the old city of Diriyah lay on either side of the narrow valley known as Wadi Hanifa, which continues southwards through Riyadh and beyond. Consisting almost entirely of mud-brick structures, the ruins are divided into three districts, Ghussaibah, Al-Mulaybeed, and Turaif that are set on top of hills overlooking the valley. Of the three, Turaif is the highest, and its bottom is easily accessible to tourists by foot. Part of the city wall, running along the edges of the wadi and also made of mud bricks, are still extant along with some high observation towers.\nThe modern city is built at a lower altitude at the foot of the hill upon which Turaif is located. To the north of the town, inside the valley, are a number of gardens, palm groves, and small farms and estates. A dam known as Al-Ilb lies further north.\n\nHistory\nDuring Muhammad's era\nIn Muhammad's time the expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah took place here in Muharram, July 627 CE/6AH.\nA platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of the Qurata, a sept of the Bakr clan of the Banu Kilab. The platoon attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. The Muslims captured war bounty and returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah Bin Uthal al-Hanafi.\n\nPost 1400\nAlthough the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as \"Ghabra\", the history of Diriyah proper dates back to the 15th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd, the city was founded in 1446–47 by Mani' Al-Muraydi (مانع المريدي), an ancestor of the Saudi royal family. Mani and his clan had come from the area of Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, upon the invitation of Ibn Dir' (ابن درع), who was then the ruler of a group of settlements that now make up Riyadh. Ibn Dir' is said to have been a relative of Mani' Al-Mraydi, and Mani's clan is believed to have left the area of Wadi Hanifa at some unknown date and were merely returning to their country of origin.\nInitially, Mani' and his clan, known as the Mrudah, settled in Ghusaybah (الغصيبة) and Al-Mulaybeed (المليبيد). The entire settlement was named Al-Dir'iyah, after Mani's benefactor Ibn Dir'. Later on, the district of Turaif (طُريف) was settled. Many families from other towns or from the Bedouin tribes of the nearby desert eventually settled in the area and by the 18th century Diriyah had become a well-known town in Nejd.\nAt that time, Muhammad ibn Saud emerged from a struggle within the ruling family of Al-Diriyah, the Al Miqrin (مقرن, sons of Miqrin, a descendant of Mani'), and became the emir, or ruler, of Al-Diriyah. In 1744, Ibn Saud took in a religious scholar named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who hailed from the town of Al-Uyaynah, lying on the same wadi some 30 miles upstream. Ibn Saud agreed to implement al-Wahhabi religious views, and what later became known as the First Saudi State, with its capital at Diriyah, was born. Within the next several decades, Ibn Saud and his immediate descendants managed to subjugate all of Nejd, as well as the eastern and western regions of Arabia, and sent raids into Iraq. Diriyah quickly swelled in size and increased in wealth, becoming the largest town in Nejd and a major city in Arabia by the standards of the time. However, the Saudis' conquest of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina drew the ire of the Ottoman Empire, the major Islamic power at the time, which led to the Ottoman-Saudi War of 1811–1818 and an invasion of Arabia by the Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces. They brought the Saudi state to an end in 1818, with Diriyah capitulating after a nearly-year-long siege. The leader of the invading force, Ibrahim Pasha, ordered the destruction of Diriyah. However, when a member of the local nobility tried to revive the Wahhabi state in Diriyah, Ibrahim ordered his troops to destroy the town even further and set whatever was left of it on fire. When the Saudis revived their fortunes in 1824 and again in 1902, they made their capital further south in Riyadh, which has remained their capital ever since.\nThe Ottoman Empire viewed the Arab challenge with caution, especially after the loss of Mecca and Medina, and the removal of the Ottoman emperor's name from Friday prayers. An Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was sent to recover lost territory. In 1818 the army entered Diriyah and after a six-month siege penetrated the defences on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves. The Egyptians were estimated to have lost 10,000 men in the siege, and the Saudi forces 1,800.\nThe town's original inhabitants left Diriyah after 1818, with the bulk of them moving to Riyadh. In The Kingdom (first published in 1981), British author Robert Lacey observed that the Al Saud had \"left the shell of their old capital behind them, an enduring reminder of the frontiers of the possible\" and compared the old Diriyah to \"a sand-blown Pompeii\". However, the area was resettled in the late 20th century, mostly by former nomads (Bedouin), and a new city was founded by the Saudi government in the late 1970s. This new city of Diriyah grew in size and is now a small but modern town and the seat of its own governorate. The ruins remain a tourist attraction and are subject to a slow restoration project on the part of the Saudi government.\n\nRenovations and development plans\nSaudi Arabia has formed the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA) to oversee the preservation and development of the historic site. Despite Wahhabi destruction of many Islamic, cultural, and historical sites associated with the early history of Islam and the first generation of Muslims (Muhammad's family and his companions), the Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction. In 2018, Jerry Inzerillo, previously the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, was hired to lead the new authority. In 2019, Inzerillo said that Diriyah would soon be known as \"the Beverly Hills of Riyadh.\"\nAmong the rebuilt structures are the bath and guest house, the Qasr Nasr, the Saad bin Saud Palace that was finished by the early 1990s, the Burj Faysal that was a wall tower renovated in the 1980s, major sections of the wall surrounding Turaif, and sections of the outer walls and some watchtowers surrounding the wadi. Outside of the Turaif district, on the opposite side of the wadi Hanifa, the region of the mosque of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab has been completely remodeled, leaving only some of the more recent original structures standing to the north of the complex build on the site of the historic mosque.\nThe \"Turaif District Development Plan\" aims to turn the district into a major national, cultural and touristic center. Before turning the complete site into a modern open-air museum documentation and necessary investigations, including excavations especially in places that may need to be remodelled, are planned in three major phases. These will include sites such as:\n\nAl-Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque and Salwa Palace.\nIbraheem Ibn Saud Palace and Fahad Ibn Saud Palace.\nFarhan Ibn Saud Palace, Torki Ibn Saud Palace, and Qoo'a Al-Sharia'a (eastern court of Salwa Palace).\nOnce finished, there will be a new visitors center as well as a documentation center. Four new museums are planned for the district. \n\nA museum of war and defense (as this was the site of a major siege in Saudi Arabia).\nA museum of horses.\nA museum of social life.\nA museum of commerce and finance.\nAdditionally, a Turaif traditional market will add to the open-air museum experience.\n\nThe Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction.\n\nMain historic sites\nThe old city's historic structures include:\n\nSalwa Palace (قصر سلوى) was the residence and first home of the Saʿūdī Amirs and Imāms during the First Saudi State. It is considered the largest palace on the site, rising four stories high. It is composed of five main parts built at different consecutive periods of time. It was probably finished by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud, who was Imam from 1803 to 1814. It is now a museum.\n\nSa'ad bin Saʿūd Palace popularly known as the Palace of Saad (قصر سعد بن سعود). One of the largest palaces on the site, it is famous for its courtyard, which was used as a stable. The palace was restored in the late 1980s and is several stories high. Sa'd ibn Sā'ud was the son of Imām Abd Allāh bin Saʿūd āl Sāʿūd (d. 1819) and played a prominent role in the battle for the city in 1818.\n\nThe Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House a traditional building consisting of a number of small courtyards surrounded by rooms. The Bath House is famous for its different architectural styles and shows how the building was waterproofed by using different plasters. Both the Guest and Bath Houses were supplied with water from a well in the wadi.\nImām Muḥammad bin Saʿūd Mosque, a mosque built first during the reign of Imām Mohammad bin Saud (1687–1765), perhaps replacing an earlier structure. Imām Abd al ʿAzīz bin Muḥammad Āl Saʿūd was assassinated here while leading Asr Salat in November 1803. The building fell into ruins after the invasion of 1818 and the disappearance of the first Saudi state; only part of the structure on eastern side survived to the 1970s and is still preserved. A small mosque was built on the south-west corner of the site some time in the first half of 20th century. Subsequently the location was excavated to reveal the large hypostyle mosque of the 18th century. The modern mosque was replaced with a traditional building as part of the development under the UNESCO heritage programme.\nAl-Bujairi (البجيري), one of the districts of the city, directly adjacent to Qasr Salwa on the opposite side of the wadi. It was the religious centre of the historical settlement, surrounded by palm trees. The chief building was mosque of the Shaykh Muḥammad bin ʿAbd al-Wahāb (محمد بن عبد الوهاب), now rebuilt and set in the al-Bujairi Heritage Park. Shaykh Mohammad ibn Abdulwahab used to give lessons about his reformed movement of Islam in this mosque. It became a centre for religious education. Students used to travel to it from all parts of the Arabian Peninsula.\nGhasiba (غصيبة), a walled historic site and on the edge of Wadi Hanifah, is to the north of old Dir'iyyah and is thought to date back to the 17th century CE.\n\nOther notable buildings\nQasr al-'Ujā (قصر العوجا) is a large Saudi royal palace erected adjacent to the old city on the south bank of Wadi Hanifa.\nThe mosque of al-Zawiharah (مسجد الظويهرة) is located in the al-Bujairi Heritage Park and is an old traditional building, restored and reopened in 2014. It is notable for the underground chamber or khālwa, a feature encountered in the older mosques in the Najd region.\nThe mosque of al-Sarikhah (مسجد السريحة) is a modern building made in the traditional central Arabian style. It is located on the west side of the al-Bujairi Heritage Park.\nThe mosque of Nakhil al-'Dhibah (مسجد نخيل العذيبة) is located a short distance to the west of the old city, in the farm of Sultan Bin Salman. It is built in the traditional central Arabian style.\n\nMuseums\nA number of the palaces in the old city have been restored and are used as museums.\n\nMuseum of Bygone Days (متحف السنين الماضية) is located north of al-Bujairi and houses a collection reflecting everyday life in central Arabia in the early and middle twentieth century.\n\nPublic facilities and centres\nAl-Maarefa University (جامعة المعرفة), is an educational institution to the north of the old city in Al Khalidiyah suburb of Riyadh.\n\nMosim Park, Football ground in the Nakheel area. It is home to football team Mosim FC, who are called The Pride of Dir'iyah. Mosim Park was erected in 2007 after Mosim FC moved there from their old ground downtown of Riyadh.\nDiriyah Arena opened in 2019 is a sporting venue with a capacity of 15,000 seats.\n\nClimate\nIn Diriyah, the summers are long, sweltering, and arid, and the winters are cool and dry. Diriyah has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh).\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSiege of Diriyah\nDiriyah ePrix\nList of battles of Muhammad\nList of cities and towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhoto gallery on Archive.org (in Arabic)",

La péninsule arabique est à cette époque très divisée : Dariya et sa région est l'une des seules oasis à échapper à l'emprise de l'empire ottoman et des chérifs de La Mecque.\nDeux groupes de la tribu des Banu Hanifa, les Al Mouqrin et Al Watban[Qui ?], émergent alors et se disputent le pouvoir à Dariya. Ces derniers l'emportent dans un premier temps, mais en 1720 Saoud ben Mohammed Al Mouqrin, expulse ses rivaux, mais est à son tour renversé en 1725.\nSon fils Mohammed Ibn Saoud reprend définitivement le contrôle de Dariya en 1727, et en fera la capitale du premier État saoudien lors de la fondation de celui-ci en 1744, et garda ce statut jusqu'en 1818, année durant laquelle les Ottomans prennent et saccagent la ville, provoquant l'effondrement du royaume saoudien (Expédition de Najd). L'Émirat du Nedjd qui lui succède cette année-là préfère déplacer sa capitale à Ryad en 1824, trois ans après que Dariya a été saccagée une seconde fois. Dès lors, la cité abandonnée restera à l'état de ruines.\nLe quartier d'at-Touraïf est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'humanité de l'UNESCO.\nAujourd'hui, la ville est le siège du gouvernorat de Dariya, située dans la province de Riyad, et qui comprend entre autres les villages d'Uyayna, de Jubbah et d'Al-Ammariyyah.\n\nFouilles en cours et Vision 2030\nÀ partir de février 2009, la zone de Dariya a été fermée aux visiteurs, en raison des travaux de rénovation qui semblent être de plus en plus importants. Des fouilles sont organisées et de nombreuses bases de colonnes ainsi que des systèmes de drainage ont été découverts.\n\nEn 2017, le projet Vision 2030 a été lancé par Mohammed ben Salmane comme feuille de route pour un avenir économiquement durable pour le pays. Les éléments les plus importants sont les projets dits giga, qui sont financés par les Fonds public d'investissement d'Arabie saoudite.\nLes projets The Line, Neom et Mukaab devraient être achevés d'ici 2030.\nL'année 2027 est prévue pour le projet Dariyah giga. Dariyah est souvent considérée comme le joyau de la couronne du royaume, car elle est l'ancienne capitale de la première dynastie saoudienne (« berceau du royaume ») et est également un site du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO.\nLe projet de construction couvre une superficie de 11 kilomètres carrés et a été transformé en destination touristique, de divertissement et culturelle depuis 2017 avec un investissement de 50 milliards de dollars. Les travaux de construction battent leur plein et sont bien avancés, avec une ouverture prévue en 2027. À seulement 15 minutes de route de Riyad, se trouveront certains des hôtels et restaurants les plus luxueux au monde, dans le style architectural traditionnel Najd, ainsi que des réserves naturelles et des sites culturels, dans le but d'attirer environ 30 millions de visiteurs par an d'ici 2030 et de « faire revivre le patrimoine historique ».\nUn nouveau centre d'accueil avec de grands parkings souterrains et un centre de documentation sont en grande partie achevés et devraient ouvrir courant 2024. Quatre nouveaux musées sont également prévus : un musée de la défense nationale, un musée de l'élevage de chevaux, un musée de la vie sociale et un musée du commerce et des finances. Les femmes devraient également être de plus en plus employées à ces postes gouvernementaux.\nMais les touristes ne sont pas le seul groupe cible. Il y aura plus de 3 000 nouvelles unités résidentielles au design traditionnel Najdi et 300 autres résidences de marque de luxe. Le site abritera également une toute nouvelle institution académique, l'Université Roi Salman, qui se concentrera sur le patrimoine, la culture et les arts, ainsi que plusieurs nouveaux instituts culturels dédiés aux disciplines de l'architecture Najdi, de la poésie, de la fauconnerie, de la récitation du Coran, du théâtre local, danse, consacrer à la musique et à la cuisine.\n\nLiens externes\nDistrict d’at-Turaif à ad-Dir’iyah, Liste du patrimoine mondial, unesco.org\n[1], page officielle vision 2030\n\nNotes et références\n(en) Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé « Diriyah » (voir la liste des auteurs).\n\n Portail du monde arabe   Portail de l’Arabie saoudite   Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail de l’archéologie",

Al-Balad's defensive walls were torn down in the 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, when Jeddah began to become wealthier due to the oil boom, many Jeddawis moved north, away from Al-Balad, as it reminded them of less prosperous times. Al-Balad had insufficient parking space for large cars. Its stores did not sell expensive designer clothing. Poor immigrants moved in place of the Saudi population. The municipality of Jeddah began historical preservation efforts in the 1970s. In 1991 the Municipality of Jeddah founded the Jeddah Historical Preservation Society to preserve the historical architecture and culture of Al-Balad. In 2002, US$4 million were earmarked for the preservation society. In 2009, Al-Balad was nominated by Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage list, and it was accepted in 2014.\nMany Jeddawis had moved away from Al-Balad by 2007; the streets of Balad were still packed with people during the month of Ramadan. Around that year the Jeddah Urban Development Company was formed to restore Al-Balad.\n\nHistorical neighborhoods\nAl-Balad is mainly divided into number of different districts:\n\nAl-Mazloum neighborhood: This neighborhood was named after Abdulkarim al-Barzanji, who was killed by the Ottoman government and located in the north-eastern part of area  north of Al-Alawi Street, with Dar Al-Qabal, Al-Shafi'i Mosque and Souk Al-Jamaa.\nAl-Sham neighborhood: Located in the northern part of Al-Balad which includes this neighborhood Dar al-Sarti and Dar al-Zahid.\nAl-Yemen neighborhood: Located in the southern part of Al-Balad south of Al-Alawi Street and gained its name towards the country of Yemen, it includes Dar Al-Nassif, Dar Al-Jumjum, Dar Al-Shaarawi and Dar Al-Abdul-Samad.\nAl-Bahr neighborhood: Located in the south-western part of Jeddah, overlooking the sea and the Dar Al-Radwan House, known at the time as the Radwan of Sea.\n\nHistorical houses\nAmong the most famous and oldest buildings to date are the Al Nassif House and Al Jamjoom House in Yemen neighborhood, Al Baeshen House, Al Qabal Mosque, Al Shafi'i Mosque in Al Mazloum, Dar Al Banaja and Al Zahed Houses in the Al Sham neighborhood. Some of these buildings have risen to more than 30 meters. Their construction is still in good condition after decades.\n\nJeddah Old City is a home for 500-year-old buildings that are now subject to restoration as the Saudi crown prince Muhammad bin Salman pledged an amount of $13.3 million to restore 56 buildings. The restoration project will be implemented by the Ministry of Culture. The aim of the project is to boost the artistic culture in Saudi Arabia.\nIn May 2024, Jeddah Historic District Program announced the restoration of 3 historical houses, which are the Jokhdar House, Al-Rayyis House, and Kedwan House, and turning them into luxury hotels. The restoration was supervised by the ministry of culture, which assigned Al Balad Development Company to manage the hotels.\n\nNon-Muslim Cemetery\nThe Non-Muslim Cemetery (formerly known as the Christian Cemetery) is located on the King Fahd Branch Road in Al-Balad. The cemetery is hidden from sight by a wall and high trees. The supervision of the site is the responsibility of Western consulates in Jeddah.\nThe cemetery contains more than 400 graves, including a sarcophagus dedicated to the French explorer Charles Huber and a single Commonwealth War Graves Commission gravestone for a British soldier of the Second World War. Cyril Ousman, the British Vice-consul of Jeddah who was shot and killed by Prince Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is also buried here. Recent burials have been rare and infrequent, and are mostly of Indian and Filipino children.\nThe cemetery has existed since the 16th century when it was used to bury Portuguese casualties resulting from the Ottoman–Portuguese wars. The walls of the cemetery may have been built by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the aftermath of the Ottoman–Saudi wars of the 1810s. The cemetery was vandalised following the Battle of Jeddah in 1925.\n\nGallery\nMisk Historic Jeddah Initiative\nIt is an annual event that takes place at Jeddah's historical area. The main aim of the event is to highlight the historical and cultural significance of AL-Balad. During the event, visitors walk through the old streets and alleys. Moreover, the initiative organizes a number of traditional entertainment activities for kids and adults. Being part of the Jeddah Season touristic festival 2019, Al-Balad hosted a number of events, all of which are organized under the title \"Kanz Al-Balad\". Kanz Al-Balad is a scavenger hunt in which participants are asked to find particular places or objects. Along the game, participants can enjoy attending more than 41 shows and plays in the area.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nJeddah Central\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBradley, John R.

          "content": "Nasseef House or Nassif House (Arabic: بيت نصيف Bayt Nasseef) is a historical structure in  Al-Balad, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of 2009, it is a museum and cultural center which has special exhibits and lectures given by historians.\n\nHistory\nThe construction of Nasseef House on old Jeddah's main street, Suq al-Alawi, began in 1872 and it was finished by 1881 for Omar Nasseef Effendi, member of a wealthy merchant family and, governor of Jeddah at the time.  When Abdulaziz Ibn Saud entered the city in December 1925, after the siege of Jeddah, he stayed in the Bayt Nasseef.  During his early stays in the city, he used it as a royal residence and received guests here. John R. Bradley, author of Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis, described the Nasseef House as \"kind of social salon\" in the 1920s, as consuls and merchants gathered there. The house belonged to the Nasseef family until 1975, when Muhammad Nasseef turned it into a private library that eventually accumulated 16,000 books, which could be read by anyone visiting him. Today these books belong to the central library of King Abdulaziz University.\n\nLayout and design\nNasseef house has 106 rooms, including artworks in some of the rooms. Besides works on wood, others on tiles can be seen as well as Arabic calligraphy. The design style is said to be Ottoman Turkish. This rather describes more the period during which it was built than relationship to designs popular in the Umayyad and Abbasids cultural centers at this time such as Baghdad, Cordoba and Damascus . The style is thought to be more related to stylistic elements found along the Red Sea, Egypt and maybe the Levant at that time.\nThe house has an irregular plan of rectangular rooms arranged around a central hall. The main entrance to the house is from the north, while there is a second entrance from the west, that was used by the women. After climbing a flight of stairs onto a small platform in front of the house, one enters into a large entry hall (dihliz) that opens to the central hall. To the left and right of the entrance hall, there are somewhat smaller rooms, that occupy the northern corners of the house. The west entrance opens straight into the central hall, while several smaller rooms are arranged around a small corridor, that connects to the central hall on the east. Similar a group of rooms occupies the southwest corner of the building. Directly opposite the main entrance hall is a large stairway system. Both the entrance hall in the north and the stairway in the south jut out from the facade as large risalits. Two large bay windows (rawashin), traditional in Jeddah, occupy the front facade above each other, connecting the two levels above the main door with their large wooden structure. There is a second smaller stairway in the southeast corner of the house that may have had more of a service function as further up the kitchen lies in this part of the house.\nThe layout of the main rooms such as the entry hall in the north with the two smaller corner rooms to its east and west, the central hall and the large stairway are all traced to the floors above. On the fourth floor, there is a large terrace on the outlines of the entry hall, while the rooms to the left and right are built as lofty structures with large windows that are covered with wood lattice from the outside. The terrace itself is screened from view by a wall with many windows. The other parts of this level have normal rooms. The fourth-floor rooms except in the southeastern part are covered by flat roofs in different levels, some usable as terraces. On the fifth floor, the kitchen resides above the main stairway in the middle of the southern part of the building. A light pavilion-like structure rises above the building on the middle eastern part, thus giving the Nasseef house seven floors (depending on how you count some of the intermediate or offset floors). This was used for resting and sleeping in, making the most of cooling breezes at this height.\nA motive of grouping elements in threes is found often in the house. This may be a group of three windows or a central doorway with a window or niche on each side. Most official rooms have a symmetrical design with niches on the walls that may correspond to windows or doors on opposite walls. Doors though are more often not arranged in the middle of a wall but rather near corners. The main stairway is fairly wide and the steps are very flat. This is said to have enabled camels to carry provisions to the kitchen on the fifth floor. Even if animals were used to carry heavy loads upstairs, one may consider it easier to direct a donkey around the turns of the stairway. There are two cisterns for water on the ground floor and latrines are provided for each level, while a domed shower can be found on the third floor. Pipes feed the waste water to underground septic tanks.\nPeople used to recognize Nasseef house as \"The House with the Tree\" because it was the only house in Balad that had one. Obviously, growing a tree was not an easy task because of the scarcity of water. The tree grows on a little square on the north of the house and is a neem tree (Azadirachta indica).  This may well be the oldest tree in Jeddah.\nA model of the Nasseef House may be viewed in the Jeddah Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBradley, John R.

          "content": "Al-Ahsa Oasis (Arabic: الْأَحْسَاء, al-ʾAhsā), also known as al-Ḥasāʾ (الْحَسَا) or Hajar (هَجَر), is an oasis and historical region in eastern Saudi Arabia. Al-Ahsa Governorate, which makes up much of the country's Eastern Province, is named after it. The oasis is located about 60 km (37 miles) inland from the coast of the Arabian Gulf. Al-Ahsa Oasis comprises four main cities and 22 villages. The cities include Al-Mubarraz and Al-Hofuf, two of the largest cities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDescription\nWith an area of around 85.4 km2 (33.0 sq mi), Al-Ahsa Oasis is the largest oasis in the world. A large part of the oasis is located in the Empty Quarter, also referred to as Rub' al Khali in Arabic. This covers almost three-quarters of the land in the oasis, while residential areas constitute 18%.\nThere are more than 2.5 million palm trees including date palms in the oasis, which is fed from a huge underground aquifer and irrigated by the flow of more than 280 artesian springs, allowing year-round agriculture in a region that is otherwise sand desert.\nThe oasis became a World Heritage site in 2018. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since December 2015. According to one author, the oases of Al-Ahsa and Al Ain (in the U.A.E., on the border with Oman) are the most important in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nEtymology\nAl-Ahsa is the plural form of \"Al-Ḥisā\" (Arabic: ٱلْحِسَى) which refers to a landscape of accumulated sand with an impermeable layer underneath. When rain falls onto such a landscape, the water soaks through the sand (which prevents it from evaporating) and is retained by the impermeable base layer, forming an aquifer. Wells drilled into the earth can then provide access to a cool spring.\nThe area used to be called Pit-Ardashir (Classical Syriac: ܦܝܛܐܪܕܫܝܪ) by Assyrians and Persians.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nAl-Ahsa has been inhabited since prehistoric times because of its abundance of water in an otherwise arid region. Natural fresh-water springs have surfaced at oases in the region for millennia, encouraging human habitation and agricultural efforts (date palm cultivation especially) since prehistoric times.\nThe oasis region and specifically the name Hajar (also Hagar, Haǧar) may be related to the Ancient Near East toponym Agarum, mentioned in Dilmunite inscriptions as the original home of their chief deity Inzak. If so, Agarum probably referred to the mainland area of Arabia lying opposite Bahrain. According to the hypothesis, the Dilmun civilization originated at the oases of Eastern Arabia, but later relocated to the isle of Bahrain. This interpretation is not without criticism, however, and other sources place Agarum on the isle of Failaka.\n\nIslamic times\nEastern Arabia was conquered by the emerging Rashidun Caliphate during the 7th century. It was later inherited by the Umayyads and Abbasids. In 899 the region came under the control of the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi and was declared independent from the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. Its capital was at al-Mu'miniya near modern Hofuf. By circa 1000, Al-Ahsa became the ninth largest city worldwide supporting 100,000 inhabitants. In 1077, the Qarmatian state of Al-Ahsa was overthrown by the Uyunids. Al-Ahsa subsequently fell under the rule of the Bahrani dynasty of the Usfurids, followed by their relatives, the Jabrids, who became one of the most formidable powers in the region, retaking the islands of Bahrain from the princes of Hormuz. The last Jabrid ruler of Bahrain was Muqrin ibn Zamil.\nIn 1521, the Portuguese Empire conquered the Awal Islands (the islands that comprise present-day Bahrain) from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil. The Jabrids struggled to maintain their position on the mainland in the face of the Ottomans and their tribal allies, the Muntafiq. In 1550, Al-Ahsa and nearby Qatif came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire with Sultan Suleiman I. Al-Ahsa was nominally the Eyalet of Lahsa in the Ottoman administrative system and was usually a vassal of the Sublime Porte. Qatif was later lost to the Portuguese. The Ottomans were expelled from Al-Ahsa in 1670, and the region came under the Banu Khalid Emirate.\nAl-Ahsa, along with Qatif, was incorporated into the Wahhabist Emirate of Diriyah in 1795 but returned to Ottoman control in 1818 with an invasion ordered by Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The Banu Khalid were again installed as rulers of the region but, in 1830 the Emirate of Nejd retook the region.\nDirect Ottoman rule was restored in 1871, and Al-Ahsa was placed first under Baghdad Vilayet and with Baghdad's subdivision Basra Vilayet in 1875. In 1913, ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, annexed Al-Ahsa and Qatif into his domain of Najd.\n\nSaudi independence\nOn 2 December 1922, Percy Cox officially notified Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah that Kuwait's borders had been modified. Earlier that year, Major John More, the British representative in Kuwait, had met with Ibn Saud to settle the border issue between Kuwait and Najd. The result of the meeting was the Uqair Protocol of 1922, in which Britain recognized ibn Saud's sovereignty over territories claimed by the emir of Kuwait. Al-Ahsa was taken from the Ottomans in 1913, bringing the Al Sauds control of the Persian Gulf coast and what would become Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nAl-Ahsa is part of the region known historically for its high skill in tailoring, especially in making bisht, a traditional men's cloak. Al-Ahsa was one of the few areas in the Arabian Peninsula in which rice was grown. In 1938, petroleum deposits were discovered near Dammam, resulting in the rapid modernization of the region. By the early 1960s, oil production levels reached 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. Today, Al-Ahsa is home to the largest conventional oil field in the world, the Ghawar Field.\nAl-Ahsa is known for its palm trees and date palms. Al-Ahsa has over 2.5 million palm trees which produce over 100,000 tons of dates every year.\nThe oasis is a popular tourist destination for Qatari nationals, who would make the 160-km cross-border drive to visit local attractions, as well as to find bargains for food, spices and clothing in Al-Ahsa's bazaars. Economic ties were severely disrupted by the Qatar diplomatic crisis, which led to the closure of Saudi Arabia's land border with Qatar. With the crisis' resolution and border reopening in 2021, however, Qatari tourists have gradually returned to Al-Ahsa; albeit in smaller numbers, due to improved Qatari self-sufficiency in goods.\nA road between Oman and Saudi Arabia, through the vast Empty Quarter sand desert, was completed in September 2021. Between 700 and 800 kilometres (430 and 500 miles) long, it extends from Al-Ahsa to the Omani town of Ibri. The Omani side of the road measures approximately 160 km (99 miles), and the Saudi side 580 km (360 miles).\n\nTourist sites\n12 locations were defined as the Cultural Landscape of Al-Ahsa Oasis (the World Heritage site):\n\nEastern Oasis (الواحة الشرقية)\nNorthern Oasis (الواحة الشمالية)\nAs-Seef (السِيف)\nSuq Al-Qaysariyah (سوق القيصرية)\nQasr Khuzam (قصر خزام)\nQasr Sahood (قصر صاهود)\nQasr Ibrahim (قصر إبراهيم)\nJawatha archaeological site (موقع جواثا الأثري)\nJawatha Mosque (مسجد جواثا)\nAl-'Oyun village (قرية العيون)\nAin Qannas archaeological site (موقع عين قناص الأثري)\nAl-Asfar lake (بحيرة الأصفر)\n\nClimate\nAl-Ahsa has a hot desert climate (Köppen Climate Classification: BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The oasis has a very low annual precipitation of 83.3 mm (3.28 in), but receives a small amount of rain in winter and spring.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nEastern Arabia\nAl-Qarah\nAl-arba' Mountain\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nIn Arabic\nAl-Ahsa municipality website Archived 5 August 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nTor Eigeland, 1970, \"The Twice-Used Water\", Saudi Aramco World\nJon Mandaville, 1974, \"Al-Hasa: Outpost of Empire\", Saudi Aramco World",

          "content": "Al Masmak Palace (Arabic: قصر المصمك, romanized: Qaṣr al-Maṣmak), also called the Masmak Fortress or Masmak Fort, is a historic clay and mudbrick fort in the ad-Dirah neighborhood of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, located in close proximity to the al-Hukm Palace in the Qasr al-Hukm District. Commissioned in 1865 by Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud, it was completed in 1895 following the takeover of the town by the Rashidi dynasty. The fortress was the main theatre for the Battle of Riyadh in 1902, which marked the prelude to the unification of Saudi Arabia. It was opened to the general public in 1995 after its conversion into a museum.\n\nHistory\nThe construction of the fort was started by Abdullah bin Faisal, Emir of Najd, in 1865. It was completed in 1895 by Emir of Riyadh, 'Abdurrahman ibn Sulaiman under the reign of Muhammad bin Abdullah Al Rashid, the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the House of Rasheed, who had wrested control of the city from the local House of Saud, who later went into exile. It was built with four watchtowers and thick walls, with a foundation of stone blocks, lying in the center of Riyadh, in the old city, part of the modern Deira district. It is one of the only historic buildings that has survived in the kingdom. The building was situated in the commercial center of historic Riyadh.\nIn January 1902, Emir 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud Al Saud, who was at the time living in exile in Kuwait, returned to Riyadh and led an ambush against the Masmak fortress, regaining it from the House of Rasheed in the Battle of Riyadh. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, is considered one of the most important in the completion of the Unification of Saudi Arabia. It was used as a munitions warehouse from 1902 to 1938 by King Abdulaziz before he moved his court to then newly built Murabba Palace.\nIn 1979, the Municipality of Riyadh prepared a study for the restoration of the Masmak, following which a renovation of the fortress began. Their vision was realized in 1995 when the Ministry of Education and the Supreme Commission for the Development of Riyadh converted the building into a museum, making it an integral part of Saudi heritage. It was later incorporated into the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre, a series of restored buildings in Riyadh. Centennial celebrations were held in 1999. The museum includes displays several antique guns, costumes and agricultural artifacts.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Masmak can be divided into six distinct parts: the gate, the mosque, the majlis, the well, the towers and the courtyard.\n\nGate\nThe main gate of the palace is located in the western wall, measuring 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 2.65 m (8 ft 8 in) wide. It is 10 cm (3.9 in) thick and is made of palmwood. There is an opening on the center of the door, called al-Khokha, which is just big enough for one person to pass at a time, and is a defensive feature designed to allow people in and out without opening the door.\nMosque\nThe mosque is located to the left of the entrance. It is a large room supported by several columns with shelves in the walls for placing mus'hafs of the Quran. A mihrab can be found in the mosque, and there are holes in the walls to provide ventilation.\nMajlis\n\nIt is located directly ahead of the entrance and is a room in the shape of a rectangle. On the wall facing the entrance and the southern wall, there are holes in the walls for ventilation and lighting, similar to those found in the mosque. \nWell\nThe well is located in the northeastern corner of the fortress.\nWatchtowers\nIn each of the corners of the mosque are conical towers, each approximately 18 m (59 ft) high. The towers are accessed through staircases located inside them. The walls of the towers are especially thick, with a thickness of 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in).\nCourtyard\nThe courtyard is surrounded by rooms with columns connected to each other internally, and it has stairs on the eastern side leading to the first floor and roofs, and there are three residential units, the first served as the residence of the ruler, the second used as a bayt al-mal, and the third was allocated for the accommodation of guests.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Saudi Arabia\nMajlis\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPlan and Photographs\nVirtual tour of the fort",

          "content": "Murabba Palace (Arabic: قصر المربّع  Qaṣr al Murabbaʿ; literally the 'Square Palace') is a historic palace in the al-Murabba neighborhood of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, located in the King Abdulaziz Historical Center. One of the first buildings erected outside the walls of the old city, it served as the official workplace and main residence of King Abdulaziz ibn Saud from 1938 until his death in 1953. It is named after its square with the form of 400 by 400 metres (1,300 by 1,300 ft). The palace was transformed into a museum and opened to the general public in 1999.\n\nHistory\nThe palace was built by King Abdulaziz outside the walled town of Riyadh, being the first major expansion of the city in the twentieth century. Construction was started in 1936 and partly finalized in 1938. It was fully completed in 1945. The construction was supervised by builder Ibn Qabba, but the King also personally involved in the construction process. The palace was intended to be a family residence and court for the king. With the construction of the palace three novel technologies were introduced to the Saudi society: the use of the automobiles as means of transportation, electricity by means of generators and water closets with drainage systems. In order to connect the palace with the city center a concrete road was constructed which was also new in the city. In 1939 electricity, lighting, fans, limited air-conditioning, a central water supply and lavatories were added by the Aramco technicians to the palace.\nThe king left his former court in Masmak fort when the construction was finished, and used the palace as his residence and court from 1938 until his death in 1953. One of his wives, Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, also moved with him to the palace in 1938. Another palace, Addeera, was also used as a royal residence.\nDuring the reign of King Abdulaziz Murabba Palace witnessed many official visits and sign of various agreements. A lift was installed into the Murabba Palace in the late 1940s when the king had difficulty in climbing the stairs due to advanced arthritis. It was the first lift in Saudi Arabia. The king appointed one of his sons, Prince Mansour, as emir of the palace.\nKing Abdulaziz's successor, King Saud, also used the palace for official activities. For instance, he inaugurated the council of ministers with a ceremony in the Murabba Palace on 7 March 1954.\n\nLocation\nThe Murabba palace is situated two kilometers north of the old city of Riyadh, and its total area was over 16 hectares. The area of the palace was later expanded to 30 hectares. In a study dated 2021 the size of the palace is cited as 9,844.64 m2.\nThe palace is located about half a mile from Masmak fort. The area of the palace was called Murabba Al Sufyan. In the south of the palace there are gardens, and the Batha valley is situated in the east. Wadi Abu Rafie is in the west, and small hills lie on the north of the palace.\nMurabba Palace is very close to Al Shamsia mansion which was the residence of Saud Al Kabeer and his wife Noura bint Abdul Rahman, elder sister of King Abdulaziz. In the 1950s the Murabba Palace was connected to Al Nasriyah Farm which is in fact a rural palace in the west of old Riyadh through a stone road.\n\nLayout and style\nThe building is a complex of palaces used for different purposes, housing two stories with 32 rooms. Overall shape of the building is cubic. It is made up of residential buildings, service facilities and the diwan of the king. These buildings are surrounded by a courtyard. A huge brick wall also surrounds the palace, and there are nine gates. The main gate was originally on the west side, but, later the gate on the southern side was used as main entrance which allowed a short link to the nearby mosque.\nThe upper floor of the building used for court of the king included audience hall, offices of administrative affairs, communications and guest chambers. The ground floor housed the offices for palace utilities, security and administration.\nThe building has a plain style and reflects the general features of the traditional Najdi architecture. It also reflects the general characteristics of Najd's urban pattern, namely solid masses, covered streets, and the integration of courtyards. The palace was built mainly by bricks, indigenous stones, tamarisk trunk and palm-leaf stalks. The walls of the building were made by straw reinforced adobe, and have engraved ornaments on coating. Local acacia with palm frond matts was used for the ceiling of the palace. The wood beams supporting the ceiling have decorations with yellow, red, and black geometric patterns.\n\nCurrent usage\nA development project was initiated by the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities in 1999 to renovate the Murabba palace. It was converted into a museum and became open to public visits. It was called \"living museum\" after renovation. It is part of the King Abdulaziz Darat or King Abdulaziz Historical Center.\nIn the current usage, the ground floor includes the guards' room and stores for food, coffee, wood and other materials needed for cooking. The upper floor is made up of salons and waiting rooms for visitors. There several historic garments and crafts are exhibited.

The Al-Fao system was to weigh 44 tonnes, and its 550 hp engine was to give it a top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) on roads, and 60–70 km/h (37–43 mph) cross-country.

That year, South Africa had tried to sell the G6 howitzer to Iraq, but the Iraqis found it too expensive, and requested that Bull design two equivalents for them. Prototypes of each model had to be ready by May 1989, in time for the Baghdad International Arms Fair. Numerous French, German and Spanish companies were contracted to manufacture parts for the guns, while the design for the chassis was bought in Czechoslovakia and modified to South African specifications. The deadline was met, and the prototypes of both Majnoon and Al-Fao were presented at the Arms Fair, although these were far from complete. However, by early 1990, the Iraqis had imported all the know-how, equipment and machinery necessary to produce them, as well as ammunition. Subsequent events prevented the realisation of the Majnoon and Al-Fao projects.\n\nSee also\nList of artillery\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nAltobchi, Ali; Cooper, Tom; Fontanellaz, Adrien (2022).

          "content": "Marid Castle (or Marid balance) is a historic military fortress located in the city of Dumat al-Jandal in the Al-Jawf region of Saudi Arabia, about 50 km from Sakaka. Built in the first century AD, it was first mentioned in the third century in the context of Queen Zenobia's campaign against Dumat al-Jandal and Tayma's rebellion, when her troops weren't able to capture the fortress.\n\nEtymology\nThe castle of Marid was named for its rebellion and insurrection against those trying to storm it, as stated by Yaqout al-Hamwi.\n\nLocation\nThe castle is located on a hill rising to about 620 meters above sea level, and overlooks the city of Dumat al-Jandal, which is affiliated to the Al-Jawf region from the western side. That contributed to its importance, as the castle can oversee all parts of the town and observe any approaching friend or foe long before they arrive.\n\nHistory\nMarid fortress dates back to the first century. The oldest mention of it dates back to the third century AD when Queen Zenobia invaded Adumato (today's Dumat al-Jandal) and Tayma, but could not capture the fortress. Therefore she reportedly said, \"Marid has rebelled, and Ablaq has glorified.\"\nIn 633 CE, Khalid ibn al-Walid annexed Dumat al-Jandal to the newly formed Islamic empire.\nIn 1853, Ha'il governor Talal Ibn Rashid damaged the castle with two cannons.\nIn 1909, Nawwaf Ibn Sha'lan besieged it for ten months until he could wrest it from the Rashids.\nSome parts of the castle were rebuilt between AH 1416 and AH 1423 (AD 1995/6-2002/3). In addition to a mosque restoration project that includes parts of the Al-Daraa neighborhood, which included installing stone buildings, restoring cracks in the facades, entrance, and corridors, and installing wooden ceilings of taramax stems in the corridors and layers of moisture insulation.\nIn 2018, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH) has launched a project to repair the castle. In the framework of the project, a cafe and a traditional restaurant have been built in the castle.\n\nDescription\nThe castle was originally rectangular, but is now oval in shape. It can be accessed from two main entrances, one in the south of the castle and the other in the north, next to the tower.\nThe castle has two floors; the first was built in stone, the upper one in mud. There also are four conical towers with height of 12 meter, and they were created at various times. Inside the castle, there are two wells, and its floors contain rooms for guards, shooting and observation.\nThe castle is surrounded by a large stone wall with many openings for observation. The fence has two entrances, one from the south and the other from the north.\nVisitors need about 30 minutes to climb up to the top of the castle due to its 1000 steps twisted stair.\n\nExcavation and dating of the castle and city\nExcavations at Marid Castle - inside and outside the castle - have proven that the castle dates back to the Nabataean period; the excavations brought to light layers with pottery and other findings dating back to the Nabataean period, such as:\n\nThe castle foundations\nNabatean findings in different parts of the Dumat al-Jandal\nA group of Nabataean mass cemeteries in the site of Sanaymiyat, located west of Dumat al-Jandal.\nWall remains of the castle.\nIn 1976, excavations revealed Nabataean and Roman ceramics dating back to the first and second centuries AD. An excavation team completed the excavation east of the castle and the wall.\nExcavations made by Khaleel Ibrahim Al-Moaqil in 1986 added to observations made in 1976 that a homogeneous layer of Roman-Nabataean pottery sherds indicated a prosperous community during the time of the Nabataeans, to whose realm the region probably belonged.\n\nNearby ancient sites\nThere are many other ancient sites in the castle's vicinity, such as the Omar ibn al-Khattab mosque, Old Dumat al-Jandal's market, the historical neighborhood of Al-Dara’a, and the city wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Saudi Arabia\nLake Dumat al-Jandal\nTourism in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nGeneral\nAl-Jawf, the fortified North Castle, Abdul Rahman Al-Tayeb Al-Ansari, Dar Al-Qawafel for Publishing and Distribution, Riyadh, 1429 AH / 2008AD.\nAl-Jouf and Hussain Al-Khalifa  Nawaf Al-Rashed, Pavilion of Al-Jouf Emirate, the 18th National Festival of Heritage and Culture, 1423 AH / 2003 AD.\nResearch in the effects of Al-Jouf region, Khalil Ibrahim Al-Moaqil, Abdul Rahman Charitable Foundation, Al-Jouf, 1st floor, 1422 AH.",

          "content": "## Overview\nArthur-Pieman Conservation Area (APCA) in West Coast Tasmania contains some of the world's cleanest air. In addition to some of the best rugged and wild beaches found on the West Coast, it is also home to the Edge of the World – it's named so as the next point of land is over half a world away in Argentina. For many people the latter is the sole reason to visit this park.\nFor practical purposes, this article covers also the nearby settlement of Arthur River, a township of 32 (2021). The township and the park are almost coexistent and there is no fee required for visiting the conservation area.\n\n## History\nThe land that APCA protects has been continually inhabited for over 35,000 years by four different Aboriginal groups; you can learn about the history in detail at the visitor centre. Even today, APCA is significant to the local Aboriginal groups, as generations upon generations have left middens, hut depressions, artifact scatters and rock art in APCA. However, most of them are inaccessible to the general public and these tracks have been sealed off (do not venture out seeking to find them – this is disrespectful and can land you hefty fines).\nThe park was established in 1982 to protect this region's pristine windswept landscape. It makes up 1,030 km2 (400 sq mi) and is today popular for camping and other recreation. Although rather unusual, the Edge of the World also attracts quite a number of tourists (just like Nowhere Else) not just for its name, but because of the views.\n\n## Landscape\nTo put it simply, APCA is mostly comprised of large sand dunes (though these don't compare to Stockton Beach) along with large inland coastal tundra forests. Some parts closer to the north is mostly plains and plateaus, resembling the Faroe Islands or the Irish countryside (and the strong winds only strengthen the similarities).\n\n## Flora and fauna\nThe most common animals encountered here are wallabies, pademelons, and wombats. Other animals such as the all-known devil (the Tasmanian Devil), quolls, and possums are also found at dusk. The park is also rich in birdlife.\nThe fauna here resembles other tundra forests in Western Tasmania, though the forest isn't as lush as in Southwest National Park or Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park.\n\n## Climate\nThe West Coast is generally unforgiving, being in the Roaring Forties, and Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area is no exception. There is no major landmass between Argentina and Tasmania to prevent the westerly winds (the Crozet Islands aren't significant enough); the result? The West Coast usually cops all the wind and rain.\nThe relatively volatile weather means that you should come prepared. That is, bringing a good jacket (even in summer), a raincoat, and shoes or boots that are waterproof (unless you want wet sand in your shoes). Though APCA contains some of the cleanest air, that does not equate to a good place to swim, unless you want to be swept away by the unforgiving waves crashing down the coastline.\n\n## Visitor information\n-41.0474144.66841 Arthur River Field Centre (Arthur River Visitor Centre), 1409 Arthur River Road, Arthur River, ☏ +61 3 6457 1225, ArthurRiver@parks.tas.gov.au. Daily 9:30AM–4PM. Basic visitor centre with some souvenirs and maps of the area.    (updated Nov 2022)\n\n## Get in\nThough the park is over 1,030 km2 (400 sq mi), most travellers visit the park from Burnie. Some travellers also visit APCA from Strahan via Zeehan.\nFrom Burnie, head west on the Bass Highway (A2) for approximately 130 km (81 mi) until the end of the highway. You'll pass Wynyard and Smithton along the way, but apart from those two settlements, the highway is very desolate. Although the Bass Highway is an A-route for its entire length west of Burnie, the road quality significantly drops west of Smithton and is more like a C-route with no shoulder.\nThe highway mysteriously ends in the middle of the Tasmanian countryside at a junction with Arthur River Road (C214) and Comeback Road (C213). At this junction, turn left onto Arthur River Rd, and within a kilometre or two, you'd be travelling on the park's eastern boundary. Continue for another 15 km (9.3 mi) until you reach the township of Arthur River. Just before you cross the one-lane bridge across the river, make sure you turn left and stop by the visitor centre.\nThe road from Zeehan is a bit more of an adventurous journey, as the over two and a half hours 140-kilometre (87 mi) drive to Temma includes taking the -41.6519145.07721 Corinna Ferry, a car ferry crossing the Pieman River; parts of the road are also unpaved. The route is more straightforward, though – head northwest on Norfolk Road (C249) and turn left onto Rebecca Road (C214) at the end of the road. You'll pass the car ferry is about an hour or 50 km north.\n\n## Fees and permits\nUnlike most other Tasmanian parks and reserves, you do not need a national parks pass to visit Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area.\nConversely, to protect the area's pristine landscape, if you are driving on off-road tracks, you will need a APCA Recreational Driver Pass which can either be purchased online or at certain Service Tasmania outlets. A 1 month pass costs $33, while an annual pass costs $55. Only purchase this pass if you're driving off-road – many places, including the Edge of the World, do not require a pass. When purchasing a pass, you will also have the latest version of the Arthur-Pieman Recreational Driving Guide. This contains some detailed maps of tracks, routes and facilities.\n\n## Get around\nThe unambiguous answer on how to get around is to take the car. You are not going to see much of a park greater than 1,000 square kilometres on foot.\nSee § Fees and permits above for driving on certain tracks. Not having a pass can result in hefty fines.\n\n## See\nAPCA doesn't have that many specific attractions. Apart from the \"Edge of the World\", which is the reason why many travellers visit the park, you should mainly enjoy the general feeling of the landscape, and small wonders you happen to stumble across.\n-41.0575144.65981 Edge of the World, Airey St. Flat-earthers may have been debunked, but the name still doesn't deter people away from coming to this place – instead, many travel here because of its obscure name. This place was thought to be the starting point of the longest uninterrupted stretch of ocean in the world – if our vision had no limits, the land you'll see will be in Argentina, almost 18,000 km away. However, the longest uninterrupted stretch of ocean is now believed to be from Quebec's North Shore to British Columbia (about 35,000 km).    (updated Nov 2022)\n-41.2617144.90882 Balfour. A ghost town just a few metres outside the park. It's a former mining town in operation when the region thrived on copper. Today, it's deserted with virtually no tourists as it's a fair bit inland from Norfolk Road (C249). Visiting Balfour today is mostly done on a tour organised by Tall Timbers Adventure Tours based in Smithton.    (updated Nov 2022)\n-41.3708144.78373 Sandy Cape Beach is the park's largest beach, which the Sandy Cape Track passes through. However, it is not like an ordinary Tasmanian beach: it's super cold and windy like the Irish countryside and the waves in the roaring forties are fierce and unforgiving. That means all you can do is wander around, but also don't venture off towards Aboriginal sacred sites (these are unmarked and cannot be legally visited without the appropriate permits from the PWS and the elders). Still, the beaches are a great spot for a photo and if you're the person who likes exploring off the beaten path destinations, this beach may be just right for you.\n\n## Do\nBy far, the thing to do in Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area is to drive the 48-kilometre (30 mi) (return) Sandy Cape Track. You will need an APCA Recreational Driver Pass before driving this track (see § Fees and permits).\nThe first 12 km of Sandy Cape Track between Temma and Greens Creek is relatively okay to traverse, except after heavy rain (which unfortunately, is a common occurrence) where you may encounter some deep-water sections. South of Greens Creek is where the track gets real hard – do not attempt this track alone (i.e. drive with another vehicle). Quicksand swallowing vehicles has happened several times; due to 4-metre (13-ft) swells, you must check the weather before departing. Never try to traverse the trails during high tide – you risk not coming back.\n\n## Buy\nAPCA doesn't really have any souvenir stores, but the visitor centre is the closest that resembles anything like it.\nArthur River has one essentials store opposite the visitor centre (Arthur River Store, ☏ +61 3 6457 1207), but it acts more like a takeaway food store that handles bookings for river cruises too.\n\n## Eat and drink\nThere are no places to eat or drink within APCA, but there are a few in Arthur River. None are restaurants – only takeaway cheap food is available in Arthur River. Oh, and there's definitely fish and chips – can't leave a coastal Tasmanian town without having one of Australia's few colonial remnants.\n-41.0482144.6671 Arthur River Take Away, 1414 Arthur River Rd, ☏ +61 3 6457 1032. Su–Th 9AM–5PM, F Sa 9AM–6PM. Basic town store with food you would normally find in Australian beachside towns (including fish and chips).    (updated Nov 2022)\nSeapod on 26 Gardiner St is a simple coffee shop, but its Facebook page suggests that it has closed permanently (and not just for the 2020 season).\n\n## Sleep\nYou have two options: camping or staying at a holiday home in Arthur River. All campgrounds have a limit of six persons. Information can be found on the park website.\nThere are six campgrounds, though only two of them are serviced. Both of them, -41.0452144.66861 Manuka Campground and -41.0478144.66772 Peppermint Campground, are near the visitor centre. For a short-term stay, it costs $15 per two adults and $5 per additional adult. For a long-term stay (up to 7 days), it costs $55 per two adults and $20 per additional adult. Children under 17 can camp out free. These two campgrounds have toilets nearby.\nThe other four unserviced campgrounds are -41.1278144.67213 Nelson Bay Campground, -41.2183144.69254 Stinking Beach Campground, Prickly Wattle Campground and Camp Elsewhere Campground. These cost $6 per 2 adults (short-term stay) with a $3 addition per extra adult and $30 for a long-term stay with $10 per extra adult.\n\n## Stay safe\nIf you're camping, make sure you boil the freshwater for at least three minutes.\nThe park can get very cold and very windy – make sure you bring good jackets.\n\n## Go next\nBeing pretty desolate, your next options onward are also very limited. To the north, you can head to Woolnorth and take a tour to Cape Grim and actually breath the world's cleanest air.\nOtherwise, you can head south towards Zeehan, Strahan or Queenstown. You will still have to cross the Corinna Ferry, though.",

In recent years the Saudi government has tried to increase the tourism quality and worth (as part of a larger tourism drive in the country) of the Islands in order to attract even more visitors.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1st century AD, the islands were known as Portus Ferresanus. A Latin inscription dating from 144 AD  has been found on the island which attests to the construction of a Roman garrison. \nIt is believed that the islands may have been attached to the Roman province of Arabia Felix, before being transferred to Aegyptus some time before 144 AD. \nThis fact would make the Farasan Islands the farthest Roman outpost (until at least the third century), being nearly 4,000 km (2,500 mi) from Rome itself. \nIt remained this way up until the Arab Muslim conquest of the islands and subsequent Islamization. Furthermore it is noteworthy to pinpoint that recent studies found that in the local language there are some loanwords from Latin.\n\nAl-Najdi Mosque\nAl-Najdi Mosque was constructed in 1929. It is one of the oldest worship sites on Farasan Island in the Jazan region, southwest of Saudi Arabia. The mosque originally took 13 years to build, and features paintings and inscriptions brought from India. The mosque is currently undergoing phase two restoration as part of the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Project for the Development of Historic Mosques.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in the Farasan archipelago is characterised by a long hot season (April–October) and a short mild one (November–March). In the long dry period, high temperatures are usually dominant. The mean annual temperature is 30 °C. Furthermore, the mean relative humidity in winter ranges from 70% to 80% and in summer between 65% and 78%. The highest rainfall occurs in April and the precipitation is generally unpredictable in the southern part of Red Sea.\n\nNature\nThe Farasan Island Marine Sanctuary is a protected area. It is home to the Arabian gazelle, and, in winter, migratory birds from Europe. Oceanic animals include manta rays, whale sharks, and several species of sea turtles including endangered and critically endangered green and hawksbill turtles, dugongs, and several species of dolphins and whales with occasional visits by others such as orcas.\n\nEconomy\nAfter a French engineer investigated petroleum seeps on the islands in 1912, a 75-year concession was granted to the Red Sea oilfields. At the time, the Farasan Islands supported a small fishing industry.\nTourism and fishing also play a role in the economy. Farasan Island is connected to Jezan port by ferry.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSaudi Aramco World: Dreaming of Farasan\nFarasan Island, a diver's paradise Archived 2016-03-02 at the Wayback Machine, Splendid Arabia: A travel site with photos and routes",
