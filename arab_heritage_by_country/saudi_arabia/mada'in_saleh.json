      "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Mada’in Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح, romanized: madāʼin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας Mathousalas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Mada’in Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Mada’in Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Mada’in Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Mada’in Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Mada’in Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

      "content": "مَدَائِن صَالِح كانت تعرف قديماً بـ الحِجْر، هي موقع أثري يقع في إقليم الحجاز في شبه الجزيرة العربية، شمال غرب المملكة العربية السعودية وتحديداً في محافظة العُلا التابعة لمنطقة المدينة المنورة. يحتل المكان موقعاً إستراتيجياً على الطريق الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية ببلاد الرافدين وبلاد الشام ومصر، كما أن للمكان شهرته التاريخية التي استمدّها من موقعه على طريق التجارة القديم الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية والشام، والحجر اسم ديار ثمود بوادي القرى بين المدينة المنورة وتبوك. ورد ذكر الحجر في القرآن على أنها موطن قوم ثمود، الذين استجابوا لدعوة نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدُّوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقة التي أرسلها الله لهم آية فأهلكهم بالصيحة.\nتعد مدائن صالح من أهم حواضر الأنباط بعد عاصمتهم البتراء، إذ تحتوي على أكبر مستوطنة جنوبية لمملكة الأنباط بعد البتراء في الأردن، والتي تفصلها عنها مسافة 500 كم، ويعود أبرز أدوارها الحضارية إلى القرنين الأول قبل الميلاد والأول الميلادي، وذلك خلال فترة ازدهار الدولة النبطية وقبل سقوطها على يد الإمبراطورية الرومانية عام 106م، ويُعتقد أن الحِجْر استمرت في حضارتها حتى القرن الرابع الميلادي، وكانت عاصمة مملكة لحيان في شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية.\nتضم آثار مدائن صالح 153 واجهة صخرية منحوتة، كما تضم عدداً من الآثار الإسلامية والتي تتمثل في عدد من القلاع وبقايا خط سكة حديد الحجاز والتي تمتد لمسافة 13 كم وكذلك المحطة والقاطرات. في سنة 2008م تم تسجيل الموقع ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، ليصبح بذلك أول موقع يتم تسجيله في السعودية.\nكما يوجد موقع أثري آخر يعرف بمدائن شعيب يقع شمال غرب مدائن صالح ويتبع منطقة تبوك، حيث يحتوي الموقع على آثار تشبه إلى حد كبير تلك الموجودة في مدائن صالح.\n\nالتاريخ\nمملكة دادان\nهي مملكة تابعة لمملكة معين من القرن الخامس ق.م حتى بدايات الأول ق.م، قامت في الحِجْر والأجزاء الشمالية الغربية من شبه الجزيرة العربية، وأغلب الظن أنها مرحلة سابقة لمملكة لحيان حيث يعتقد بعض الباحثين أن اللحيانيين كانوا من سكان العربية الجنوبية، لورود نص يشير إلى قيل لحياني في اليمن اسمه «أب يدع ذو لحيان» واستوطنوا دادان جنوب أراضي لحيان، فلما ضعفت حكومة المعينيين في اليمن استولى اللحيانيون على المملكة وأسموها على اسم قبيلتهم، وليس بين الباحثين اتفاق على أصولهم تحديداً، ويرى جواد علي أن المعينيين كوَّنوا مستعمرات في أعالي الحجاز منذ القرن الخامس قبل الميلاد ووصفهم باللحيانيين أيام قوة المعينيين، وهدف هذه المستعمرات هو تأمين الطريق التجارية من اليمن إلى الشام. ووفقاً لورنر كاسكل: \n\n أغلب بضاعتهم القادمة من جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية كانت موجهة لمصر واليونان ويعتقد كاسكل أن اللحيانيين استولوا عليها في منتصف القرن الثاني ق.م قرابة 150 ق.م فقد كان المعينيون يسيطرون على الحِجْر وأعالي الحجاز من القرن الخامس ق.م بمساعدة من اللحيانيين بدلالة أن أول ملوكهم كان معينياً ثم عادت للحيان مستغلين ضعف مملكة معين وحروبها مع مملكة سبأ. يرى جواد علي أن اللحيانيين ينحدرون من النبي إسماعيل، وقد عدهم بلينيوس الأكبر في جملة الشعوب العربية كذلك.\n\nاللحيانيون\nيختلف المؤرخون في أصل اللحيانيين، فمنهم من يرى أنهم فرع من ثمود، بينما يرى آخرون أنهم أحد الشعوب العربية الجنوبية، بدليل أنه قد ورد اسم لحيان في نص عربي جنوبي. كانت العلا مركزاً للحيانيين، حيث كانت مستعمرة معينية قديمة، كما أنها القاعدة الشمالية القصوى للحضارة العربية الجنوبية، تقع في وادي القرى جنوب شرق حرة العويرض بين سلسلة من الجبال في الشرق والغرب، وعلى بُعد حوالي 15 كم إلى الجنوب من مدائن صالح، هناك موقع كان يُسمّى قديماً «ددان» أو «ديدان» بحسب ما جاء في كتب الأنساب اليهودية وفي النصوص المعينية، ولاحقاً سُمّي بوادي القرى ويُعرف الآن بالعُلا، وقد اختلف الباحثون فيمن حكم هذه المنطقة أولاً وكان الاختلاف بين الديدانيين والمعينيين واللحيانيين.\nامتد نفوذ دولة لحيان على الأرض الممتدة غربي النفود، من شمال يثرب إلى ما يحاذي خليج العقبة.\nوقد اختلف في فترة دولة لحيان، يرى البعض أنها كانت بين بداية القرن الخامس ونهاية القرن الثالث قبل الميلاد، ويرى آخرون إلى أنها إنما كانت فيما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد (حوالي سنة 160 ق. م) وبين نهاية القرن الثالث بعد الميلاد، وهناك من حدد الفترة ما بين عامي 280 - 200 قبل الميلاد لقيامها،\nوأن نهايتها كانت على أيدي الأنباط الذين استولوا على «الحِجْر» سنة 65 ق. م، و«ديدان» سنة 9 ق. م،\nوأن هناك من يرى أن نهاية دولة لحيان إنما كانت على أيدي المعينيين، وأن ذلك كان بين نهاية القرن الثالث والقرن الأول قبل الميلاد.\nعُثِر في العُلا بالقرب من مدائن صالح على ما يقارب من أربعمائة نقش لحياني أغلبها عبارة عن نقوش وقطع صغيرة، ومنها ما يحتوي على بعض أسماء الملوك والمعبودات الوثنية، أما بالنسبة للكتابة اللحيانية، فهي كتابة محلية حروفها سامية جنوبية وقريبة جداً من الكتابة العربية الجنوبية والحبشية، أما اللهجة فعربية شمالية وهي أيضاً سامية جنوبية. يرى البعض أنها كانت مسيحية، بينما يرجّح آخرون أنها عربية جاهلية وضعت قبل ظهور الإسلام.\nتحتوي هذه النقوش والكتابات على بعض أسماء ملوك لحيان، منها «هنوس بن شهر» و«ذو أسفعين تخمى بن لوذان» الذي يرجع حكمه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. كما أن هناك معبد يقع في العُلا يعود للحيانيين، وُجِدت فيه تماثيل بطول الإنسان لملوك لحيان، وهذه التماثيل متأثرة بالنحت الفرعوني في النصف الأعلى من الجسم، ومن حيث اللبس، ولكنها تحمل الطابع العربي المتمثل في شكل الوجه، وما وضع على الرأس بما يشبه العمامة والعقال.\nيرى البعض أن الأنباط قد استولوا على الحِجْر سنة 65 ق. م، إلى أن وصلوا إلى تيماء، ثم قطعوا كل اتصال للحيانيين بالبحر، فاستولوا على ميناء «لوكي كومة» التابع للحيانيين، وأحاطوا بهم من جميع الجهات، ويُعتقد أن الطريق التجاري قد تغير اتجاهه بفعل النبطيين في جنوب الحجر، فكان يمر على مسافة 7 كم إلى الشرق من واحة دادان القديمة، ثم أخضعوها لنفوذهم. عاد حكم اللحيانيين مرة أخرى بعد سقوط البتراء على أيدي الرومان سنة 106م، والذين مدوا نفوذهم إلى منطقة تبعد عشرة كيلومترات إلى الشمال من دادان.\n\nالأنباط\nاستوطن النبط (الأنباط) الحِجْر، والأنباط هم من العرب من شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية. في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، في فترة حكم الحارث الرابع جعل من الحِجْر العاصمة الثانية للأنباط حيث كانت عاصمتهم الأولى هي البتراء في الشمال، وكان للأنباط حضارة كبيرة وشيدوا المقابر في الجبال وأضافوا لها الكثير من جماليات البناء القديم، حيث تظهر خصائص العمارة النبطية مع الكتابات النبطية المنقوشة في الصخور على الواجهات الخاصة بهم. كما طوّروا أيضاً زراعة الواحات، وحفر الآبار وعمل خزانات لمياه الأمطار في الصخور، بالإضافة إلى نحت أماكن العبادة في النتوءات الصخرية.\nهناك منشآت ومستوطنات مشابهة لما تحتويه مدائن صالح في عدد من الأماكن مثل الشام والمنطقة المجاورة للحجاز، وأبرز هذه المنشآت ما وجِد في البتراء.\nاستمرت حضارة الأنباط في الازدهار والتوسع في الحجر حتى تحكموا في طرق التجارة في العالم القديم، حيث احتكروا تجارة البخور والمر والتوابل، وكان طريق التجارة القديم يأتي من جنوب شبه الجزيرة العربية حتى يصل إلى الحِجْر، ومن الحجر يتفرع إلى طريقين، يذهب أحدهما إلى البتراء ومصر والشام، فيما يذهب الآخر إلى تيماء ثم تدمر في العراق. كما كانت الحجر مركزاً رئيسياً لطرق القوافل القديمة وكانت تتحكم في طرق القوافل، وبلغ نفوذهم كما يذكر المؤرخون شرق شبه الجزيرة العربية وجنوبها، وعندما خشي الرومان على نفوذهم وعلى دولتهم من هذه المملكة الجديدة قام الرومان بشن حرب كبيرة على الأنباط واستطاع الرومان هزيمتهم في الحجر سنة 106م، ولكنهم لم يستوطنوا الحجر بل عادوا إلى الشام، وهكذا تدمرت حضارة الأنباط في الحجر ولم يعد لهم أي ذكر، وظلت الحجر مهجورة زمناً طويلاً.\n\nفترة ما بعد الأنباط\nفي سنة 106م تم ضم مملكة الأنباط من قبل الإمبراطورية الرومانية. وبالتالي أصبح جزء من الحجاز والذي يشمل الحجر تحت إدارتهم.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف نقش روماني في الحجر يعود إلى 175 - 177م.\nتحول طريق التجارة من كونه مساراً بريّاً يصل بين شمال شبه الجزيرة العربية وجنوبها إلى أن أصبح مساراً بحريّاً وذلك عبر البحر الأحمر، مما أدّى إلى انخفاض أهميتها التجاريّة بعد أن كانت مركزاً للتجارة، إلى أن تمّ التخلي عنها لاحقاً. هناك دراسات أثرية افترضت أن الموقع قد فقد وظائفه الحضرية في بدايات أواخر العصور القديمة، ويعود ذلك إلى عملية التصحر في المنطقة.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف أدلة على أن الفيالق الرومانية في عهد تراجان سيطرت على مدائن صالح، لزيادة نفوذها في المقاطعة العربية.\n\nيبقى تاريخ الحجر منذ انهيار الإمبراطورية الرومانية حتى ظهور الإسلام غير معروف، في سنة 9 هـ الموافقة لسنة 630م مر عليها النبي محمد أثناء توجهه لغزوة تبوك. بعد ظهور الإسلام وانتشاره عادت الحركة إلى الحجر، كما تم ذكرها في القرون اللاحقة من قِبَل المسافرين والحجاج في طريقهم إلى مكة، حيث كانت الحجر تخدم كمحطة للاستراحة بها والتزوّد بالماء والطعام، وقد ذكرها العديد من الرحالة العرب كالمقدسي وياقوت الحموي وإبراهيم بن شجاع، وابن بطوطة الذي أشار في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي إلى الصخور والأضرحة الموجودة فيها، ولكنّه لم يشر إلى الأنشطة البشرية هناك.\nتحت الحكم العثماني والذي بدأ في القرن السادس عشر، تم بناء حصن فيها في الفترة ما بين 1744 - 1757م، والذي كان ذلك جزءاً لسلسلة من التحصينات تم بناؤها من أجل حماية طريق الحج إلى مكة.\n\nالمدائن في القرن العشرين\nمنذ القرن التاسع عشر استُخدِمت الآبار القائمة لزراعة المنطقة بشكل دوري من قبل المستوطنين في تيماء المجاورة لها، واستمر هذا حتى القرن العشرين، عندما تم بناء سكة حديد الحجاز (1901 - 1908م) التي كانت تمرّ من خلال الموقع بأمرٍ من السلطان العثماني عبد الحميد الثاني، لربط دمشق والقدس في الشمال الغربي بالمدينة المنورة، لتسهيل رحلة الحج، بالإضافة إلى أمور سياسية واقتصادية لتعزيز الإدارة العثمانية على مراكز العقيدة الإسلامية. بُنِيت محطة مدائن صالح شمال الحجر، وقد عملت على زيادة إمكانية الوصول للموقع. لاحقاً تم تدمير السكة من قِبل الإنجليز خلال الثورة العربية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى.\nاستمرت عدة دراسات أثرية في الموقع للفترة منذ بداية الحرب العالمية الأولى إلى توحيد المملكة العربية السعودية في 1932، إلى أن وصلت إلى الستينيات الميلادية. لاحقاً تم ترميم محطة سكة الحديد، وتتكون من 16 مبنى موزعاً على خط السكة بطول 400 متر تقريباً، وتضم مباني للإدارة والمخازن ومركزاً للشرطة ومركزاً صحياً وإقامة للعاملين في المحطة واستراحات للزوار، كما تتضمن محطة لصيانة القاطرات وورشة للصيانة ومخازن الحطب والطاقة.\nبحلول نهاية فترة الستينيات الميلادية عملت الحكومة السعودية برنامجاً لتحسين أسلوب حياة قبائل البدو الرحل التي تقطن المنطقة. وكان البرنامج يقترح استقرارهم في المنطقة مع إعادة استخدام الآبار الموجودة والاشتغال بالزراعة، ولكن مع اكتساب الموقع هويته الرسمية كموقع أثري سنة 1972 أدّى إلى توطين البدو نحو الشمال خارج حدود الموقع، وشمل ذلك تطوير الأراضي الزراعية الجديدة والآبار التي حفرت حديثاً، للحفاظ على المنطقة.\n\nالحِجْر في الإسلام\nقوم ثمود في القرآن\nالثموديون هم أول من سكن الحجر وأول من نحت المنازل في الصخور وجاء بعدهم الأنباط. جاء ذكر الحِجْر وقصة قوم ثمود في القرآن في أكثر من سورة، حيث يذكر أن الثموديين تميّزوا بالقوة وكانوا يتخذون من الجبال بيوتاً عن طريق النّحت، فقد ورد في القرآن ﴿وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ بِالْوَادِ ۝٩﴾ [الفجر:9]، وأرسل الله إليهم نبيّه صالح، حيث دعاهم إلى عبادة الله وترك عبادة الأصنام ولكنهم لم يؤمنوا به، ومع استمرار دعوته لهم، طلبوا منه أن يخرج لهم ناقة من صخرة كبيرة لديهم، وأنهم سوف يؤمنون إذا نفّذ هذا الأمر، فدعا الله أن يُخرج الناقة واستجاب الله له.\n﴿وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۖ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً ۖ فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِي أَرْضِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ﴾ (سورة الأعراف، الآية: 73)\nفاستجابوا لدعوة نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقة التي أرسلها الله لهم آية وتحدَّوه أن يأتيهم بالعذاب فأهلكهم الله بالصيحة، وكانت الناقة في يوم تشرب جميع الماء الموجود في البئر، وتسقي في اليوم التالي كل سكان الحجر من لبنها، وبعد مدة من الزمن قرر قوم ثمود قتل الناقة، وعندما قتلوها أهلكهم الله جميعاً بالصيحة، ونجا نبيّه صالح ومن آمن معه من قوم ثمود، ومن ثمّ رحل صالح ومن معه من المؤمنين إلى مكة المكرمة.\nمن الآيات التي ذكرت في القرآن عن الحِجْر:\n\n﴿وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أَصْحَابُ الْحِجْرِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ ۝٨٠ وَآتَيْنَاهُمْ آيَاتِنَا فَكَانُوا عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ ۝٨١ وَكَانُوا يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا آمِنِينَ ۝٨٢ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ مُصْبِحِينَ ۝٨٣ فَمَا أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ۝٨٤﴾ (سورة الحجر، الآية: 80 - 84)\n﴿كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ، إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ صَالِحٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ، إِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ، وَمَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، أَتُتْرَكُونَ فِي مَا هَاهُنَا آمِنِينَ، فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ، وَزُرُوعٍ وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ، وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا فَارِهِينَ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ، وَلَا تُطِيعُوا أَمْرَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ، الَّذِينَ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ، قَالُوا إِنَّمَا أَنْتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ، مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا فَأْتِ بِآيَةٍ إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ، قَالَ هَذِهِ نَاقَةٌ لَهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَعْلُومٍ، وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ، فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ، فَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَآيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ، وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ﴾ (سورة الشعراء، الآية: 141 - 159)\n\nفي السُّنَّة\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «لما نزل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بالناس على تبوك نزل بهم الحِجْر عند بيوت ثمود، فاستقى الناس من الآبار التي كانت تشرب منها ثمود، فعجنوا منها ونصبوا القدور فأمرهم رسول الله فأهرقوا القدور، وعلفوا العجين الإبل، ثم ارتحل بهم حتى نزل بهم على البئر التي كانت تشرب منها الناقة، ونهاهم أن يدخلوا على القوم الذين عذبوا، وقال: إني أخشى أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم فلا تدخلوا عليهم».\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو بالحِجْر: لا تدخلوا على هؤلاء المعذبين إلا أن تكونوا باكين، فإن لم تكونوا باكين فلا تدخلوا عليهم أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم». وفي بعض الروايات «أن النبي محمد لما مَرَّ بمنازلهم قنع رأسه، وأسرع راحلته، ونهى عن دخول منازلهم إلا أن تكونوا باكين». وفي رواية: «فإن لم تبكوا فتباكوا، خشية أن يصيبكم مثل ما أصابهم».\nعن عمرو بن سعد (وقيل: عامر بن سعد) قال: «لما كان في غزوة تبوك، فسارع الناس إلى أهل الحجر يدخلون عليهم، فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فنادى في الناس: الصلاة جامعة. قال: فأتيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو ممسك بعيره، وهو يقول: ما تدخلون على قوم غضب الله عليهم؟ فناداه رجل: نعجب منهم يا رسول الله. قال: أفلا أنبئكم بأعجب من ذلك؟ رجل من أنفسكم ينبئكم بما كان قبلكم، وما هو كائن بعدكم فاستقيموا وسددوا، فإن الله لا يعبأ بعذابكم شيئاً، وسيأتي قوم لا يدفعون عن أنفسهم بشيء».\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدائن صالح على بعد 22 كم شمال شرق مدينة العلا، و400 كم شمال غرب المدينة المنورة و500 كم إلى الجنوب الشرقي من البتراء الواقعة في الأردن، وتقع تحديداً عند دائرة عرض 47 ـ 26 شمالاً، وخط طول 53 ـ 37 شرقاً. يقع الموقع الأثري على منطقة سهلية، عند سفح هضبة من البازلت التي تشكل الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من جبال الحجاز. الأجزاء الغربية والشمالية الغربية للموقع، تحتوي على المياه الجوفية التي يمكن الوصول إليها على عمق 20 متراً تقريباً. يتميز الموقع بطبيعته الصحراوية التي تتسم بالنتوءات الواقعة على الصخور بمختلف الأحجام والارتفاعات.\nتتميز منطقة مدائن صالح بالتكوينات الصخرية، كما أنها تتميز أيضاً بتنوّع ألوان صخورها الرملية بين الأحمر والأصفر والأبيض. بالإضافة إلى أن الموقع محاط بالكثبان الرملية من جميع الجهات.\n\nالعمارة\nالنحت\nتتميّز المدافن النبطية في مدائن صالح كونها ليست مبنية وإنما محفورة في الصخور الرملية، والذي ساهم في سهولة عملية النحت والحفر، كون تلك الصخور غير صلبة ولكنها تتأثر بعوامل التعرية. تتباين ألوان الصخور من الأحمر إلى الأبيض حسب عمرها، حيث يعود تاريخ الصخور الحمراء إلى العصر الكمبري، بينما تعود الصخور البيضاء إلى العصر الأردوفيشي، وتتطابق هذه الصخور مع تلك التي استخدمها الأنباط في البتراء، وهناك عدة تحليلات قام بها خبراء في علم الآثار لتفسير أسلوب النحت المتبع فرأوا أن العملية تمت من الأعلى إلى الأسفل، وبما أن أصحاب تلك المدافن من الطبقة الحاكمة أو من أثرياء الأنباط، فكانت هنالك معايير قبل عملية النحت، حيث يتم اختيار موقع المدفن فكلما كان قريباً من ناحية المساكن كان أكثر تكلفة ويقل كلما تباعد عنها، وارتفاع الصخرة وجودتها كانت من تلك المعايير أيضاً، فالصخور التي تخلو من الصدوع والشقوق تعمل على إبراز تفاصيل النقوش كالشرفات المدرّجة التي تعرف بسلّم الغراب، والكورنيش على النمط المصري والعتب وتيجان الأعمدة التي يتم نحتها على الصخور الجيدة، ولكن أحياناً يتعذّر على النحات معرفة جودة الصخرة في البداية ليتم اكتشافها لاحقاً أثناء النحت، كما يتم تحديد ارتفاع المدفن بشكل دقيق وذلك بحسب الأدوات المتوفرة لديهم، وعندما لا تكون هنالك طبقة طبيعية ناتئة في الصخر يتم نحت قناة أفقية في الصخرة فوق أعلى نقطة في الواجهة المنحوتة، لتمنع من تساقط الأمطار على الواجهة،\nهناك تناسب بين طول واجهة المدفن وعرضه حيث أن ارتفاع المدفن يتحدد بناءً على عرضه، وبالنسبة للمدافن الكبيرة فكان يعمل عليها عدد من النحاتين سواءً كانوا اثنان أو أكثر من ذلك، فيعمل كل واحد في طرف بحيث يتم الالتقاء في منتصف الواجهة، وتختلف كمية الصخور التي يتم نحتها قبل الوصول للواجهة من مدفن إلى آخر، وكان النحاتون يستعملون المنصات الطبيعية المتكونة نتيجة اختلاف مستوى طبقات التكوين الصخري ليقفوا عليها، وعادةً ما يقوم النحّات بالانتهاء من جميع تنفيذ جميع تفاصيل النحت التي تتم في الواجهة من زخارف قبل النزول للأسفل، كما يتم إعداد اللوحة التي يُكتب عليها النص التأسيس ويتم عادة قطعها فوق المدفن، ولكن الكتابة غالباً ما تتم من قِبل كاتب مختص، ويشترك العمّال في تنفيذ أعمال النحت تحت إشراف رئيس النحاتين وأحياناً اثنان من النحاتين ترِد أسماؤهم تحت النص التأسيسي للمدفن، وهناك مجموعة من النحاتين ينتسبون لعائلة واحدة ظهر ذلك من خلال كتابة أسمائهم على عدد من اللوحات، ومن أشهرهم شخص اسمه «أفتح» حيث قام بتنفيذ خمسة مدافن وساهم في اثنين آخرين. هناك بعض العناصر التي عُملت على الواجهة تمت من قبل أشخاص مختصين بذلك ويتم تنفيذ تلك العناصر سواء بشكل مباشر على الصخرة أو بنحتها بشكل منفصل ومن ثم إلحاقها بالمكان المخصص لها في الواجهة. يتم عمل الأسطح الملساء التي تتميز بها الواجهات رأسياً بواسطة معول مستدق الرأس من الطرفين أو الإزميل وهو وتد حديدي مدبب من أحد الطرفين ومسطح في الآخر يتم العمل به عن طريق طرقه بمطرقة.\n\nهناك أجزاء من الواجهة مثل المساحة بين الشرفات والعتب والعارضة أسفل تاج العمود يتم تجصيصها ودهنها بلون أسود أو أحمر، حيث أن هناك عدد من المدافن لا تزال تحتفظ بآثار الجص المستخدم. كان النحاتون يستخدمون بالإضافة إلى أدوات النحت والحفر أدوات القياس، ومنها مقياس الخط العمودي، وشاقول تحديد الاستواء، والمربع، والحبل، وأحياناً الفرجار. هناك عدد من المدافن غير المكتملة في الموقع، ويعود معظمها لنواحٍ فنية على ما يبدو، إمّا أن يكون بسبب أن النحات قد واجه طبقة ملحية أتت من سطح الأرض، وإما أن يكون بسبب شق في الصخرة لم يظهر في بداية العمل بالنحت، أو ظهور طبقة تحتوي على الكثير من الحصى.\nالعنصر الآخر في المدفن هو حُجرة الدفن ويتم حفرها في الصخرة خلف الواجهة، وحجرات الدفن لا تكون عادة بنفس مستوى ارتفاع الواجهات، ومستوى سقف الغرفة يكون متوافقاً مع العتبة العليا للباب، والأداة الوحيدة المستخدمة داخل المدافن كانت المعول مستدق الطرفين، ويوجد عدد من حجرات المدافن غير المكتملة، وربما يعود ذلك كون صاحب المدفن يهتم بالواجهة الخارجية أكثر من الحجرة الداخلية، ومكان الدفن المنحوت داخل الحجرة يتكوّن من ثلاثة أنواع، كوّة أو حفرة أو حجرة مصمتة، وكان ينفذ عندما يتوفى أحد أفراد العائلة، وحين يكون المكان في شكل حجرة فهي تُحفر بحسب حجم الشخص المتوفّى، وعادة ما تكون حجرات الدفن غير منتظمة.\nقام الباحث جان كلود بيساك بتقدير الفترة المطلوبة لتنفيذ مدفن متوسط الحجم بسنة وشهرين، وتستغرق عملية حفر الواجهة المدة الأطول التي قد تستغرق سبعة أشهر، أما حجرة المدفن فتستغرق ما بين أربعة إلى خمسة أشهر وهي تقريباً نفس المدة التي تتطلبها عملية نحت التفاصيل.\n\nالكتابات والنقوش\nتتنوع الكتابات الموجودة في مدائن صالح، فهناك العربية الجنوبية، واللحيانية، والثمودية، والنبطية، واللاتينية، والإسلامية. كما أن مواضيع هذه النقوش تتنوع بين النقوش الدينية والنقوش التأسيسية والنقوش التذكارية، أما أكثر النقوش الموجودة في الموقع فهي النقوش الملكية. تنتشر في الموقع النقوش النبطية كون الموقع وصل لأوج ازدهاره فترة العصر النبطي، وهي تنتشر على واجهات الجبال، وكذلك في أماكن على واجهات المقابر، وقد تضمنت معلومات عن ملكية المقبرة، وما تحتويه من شروط للدفن فيها من قبل أصحابها وورثتهم، كما أنها تحتوي أيضاً على نصوص يتم فيها تحديد العقوبة التي يجب أن تقع على من يخالف قانون الدفن، وبعض النقوش مؤرخة كما تحتوي على اسم النحّات.\n\nالمواقع الأثرية\nواجهات المقابر المنحوتة\nمدافن جبل المحجر\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن جبل المحجر كذلك باسم (المنطقة أ)، وتقع إلى الشمال من مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت بالقرب من البئر النبطي، وهي عبارة عن ثلاث كُتَل صخرية نُحِتت فيها أربعة عشر مدفناً نبطيّاً، حيث تضم الكتلة الصخرية الأولى منها ستة مدافن، وتضم الثانية خمسة مدافن، بينما تضم الثالثة والمسماة بجبل المحجر ثلاثة مدافن.\n\nمدافن قصر البنت\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت أيضاً باسم (المنطقة ب)، وتقع إلى الغرب من جبل أثلب، وتتكون من جبلين أحدهما كبير حيث يمتد من الشمال إلى الجنوب ويضم 31 مدفناً، والآخر صغير يقع شمال غربي الجبل الأول ويضم مدفنين في واجهته الشرقية.\n\nمدافن الجبل الأحمر\nتعرف مجموعة مدافن الجبل الأحمر أيضاً باسم (المنطقة ج)، وتقع إلى الجنوب الغربي من مجموعة مدافن قصر البنت، وإلى الشمال الغربي من منطقة «د»، وتضم كتلتين صخريتين، تحتوي الأولى على 18 مدفناً. بينما تتكون الكتلة الثانية من مدفن واحد فقط، وهي تقع جنوب الكتلة الأولى.\n\nمدافن المنطقة «د»\nتقع المنطقة «د» شرق منطقة قصر الصانع، حيث تتكون من جبلين في كل واحد منهما مقبرة واحدة فقط. في المدفن (رقم: 109) يظهر بأن العمل قد اكتمل في الغرفة الخاصة بالدفن، بينما الجزء السفلي من واجهة المدفن غير مكتملة. بالنسبة للمدفن (رقم: 111) يظهر بأن واجهته قد اكتملت، بينما غرفة الدفن غير مكتملة.\n\nمدافن الخريمات\nتقع منطقة الخريمات جنوب غربي الحِجْر، وتحتوي على 53 مدفناً موزعة على تسعة جبال، وتتميز واجهات المدافن بتعدد العناصر المعمارية والزخرفية، كما أن المنطقة تأثرت بعوامل التعرية والسيول بسبب انخفاض المنطقة. الجبل الأول يضم خمسة مدافن (رقم: 50 - 54)، بينما يضم الجبل الثاني مدفناً وحيداً (رقم: 49)، وكذلك الجبل الثالث الذي يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم:55)، أما الجبل الرابع فيضم سبعة مدافن (رقم: 56 - 62)، وبالنسبة للجبل الخامس فهو يضم ستة عشر مدفناً (رقم: 63 - 78)، والجبل السادس يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 79)، بالإضافة إلى الجبل السابع الذي يضم ستة عشر مدفناً (رقم: 80 - 95)، والجبل الثامن يضم خمسة مدافن (رقم: 96 - 100)، والجبل التاسع يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 101).\n\nقصر الصانع\nتقع مجموعة قصر الصانع في الجهة الجنوبية من منطقة الحِجْر، وتتكون من كتلتين صخريتين. الكتلة الغربية تضم مدفناً واحداً يُعرف بقصر الصانع، حيث أن واجهته تعلوها شرفات مدرّجة في أسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش آخر يبرز بشكل أقل عن سابقه، تليه عارضتان يقع بينهما شريط فاصل، وتقع العارضة السفلى على عمودين ذات تيجان نبطية، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء الجنوبي من الواجهة، وعلى جانبه عمودان تيجانهما نبطية. بينما الكتلة الشرقية تحتوي على ستة مدافن وهي بسيطة في نحتها.\n\nقصر الفريد\nسمي بالقصر الفريد كونه يقع منفرداً في كتلة صخرية مستقلة، ولتميّزه معماريّاً حيث يتفرّد بوجود عمودين نبطيّين بوسط الجزء السفلي في واجهته الصخرية بالإضافة إلى الأعمدة الجانبية، ولكن المدفن غير مكتمل وخاصة في جزء الواجهة السفلي والبرحة الأمامية للمدخل، والنقش التأسيسي للمدفن غير مؤرخ.\nتوجد أعلى واجهة المدفن شرفات مدرّجة على الجانبين في أسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش آخر يحتوي على بروز أقل من السابق تليه عارضة، وعلى جانبه عمودين بتيجان نبطية، بالإضافة إلى عمودين آخرين في وسط الواجهة وهو الذي ميّزها عن باقي المدافن، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء السفلي من الواجهة، ومن عناصره المكتملة الإطار العام لكورنيش يظهر أعلاه نحت لنسر فارد جناحيه، بالإضافة إلى منحوتات لآنية تظهر على جانبي الكورنيش، كما يعلوه نقش تأسيسي نصّه «لحيان بن كوزا وذريته».\n\nمدافن المنطقة السكنية\nتقع مدافن المنطقة السكنية ضمن المنطقة السهلية التي تتوسط الموقع، ويحيط بها سور له آثار باقية من الجهات الشمالية والجنوبية والغربية، تتوسطها رموز دينية بارزة.\n\nالمنطقة الدينية\nتقع المنطقة الدينية في الجهة الشمالية للحِجْر وتحديداً في جبال إثلب، وكان قد اتخذها الأنباط مركزاً دينيّاً لهم، وتتكوّن المنطقة من الديوان والمعابد والمحاريب وقصر العجوز. يعتبر الديوان من أهم المنشآت الدينية فيها، وهو مكان مخصص للتجمعات الدينية، ويتكوّن من حجرة في الجبل وهي مستطيلة الشكل، كما أن مدخل الديوان مفتوح وعلى جانبه عمودان ذوا تيجان نبطيّة تعلوهما عارضة، وتوجد بالديوان ثلاث دكات منحوتة ومتصلة ببعضها وهي ترتفع عن سطح الأرض ويتم الصعود إليها عن طريق درج منحوت في جانبي المدخل، كما أن هناك أربعة أعمدة تيجانها نبطية يعلوها إفريز بارز وهي تقع في أركان الديوان، وهناك ممر ضيق مجاور للديوان يعرف بـ «السيق»، حيث تنتشر على جانبيه النقوش والمحاريب.\nتنتشر المعابد على مرتفعات جبل إثلب في منطقة الديوان وفي بطن منطقة المنخض الصخري، وهي تمثل المنطقة الدينية التي أنشئت للمعبودات الوثنية الخاصة بأهل الحِجْر. بالنسبة لقصر العجوز فهو معبد أو مركز للكهنة يقع إلى الجنوب من جبل إثلب، يتميز بكون مدخله مفتوح بحجم اتساع الحجرة المنحوتة، يوجد في الجدار الأيمن للحجرة كوَّتان مربعتان، بينما يوجد في الجدار الآخر خمس كوَّات، في يمينها مدخل يصل بحُجرة صغيرة.\nتتركز المحاريب في جنوب المنطقة الدينية، وهي من الأمور الدينية التي تتميز بها حضارة الأنباط، حيث تُجسّد فيها رموز معبوداتهم الوثنية، وقد حُفرت المحاريب في صخور تختلف في أشكالها وأحجامها، وهذه المحاريب عبارة عن تجاويب يتقدمها عمودان يحملان قوساً نصف دائري، في وسط كل محراب أو أعلاه نحت بارز يرمز للمعبودات الوثنية، وقد يكون بعض هذه المحاريب لا يحتوي على أي رموز.\n\nالمنطقة السكنية\nتقع المنطقة السكنية في وسط منطقة الحِجْر، في أرض سهلية منبسطة، وقد تم تحديد أسوار تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، كما كشفت الحفائر عن عدد من المراحل المعمارية التي قامت عليها، مما يدل على عُمق الاستيطان بالمنطقة، حيث تم الكشف عن وحدات معمارية ومبان طينية فوق أساسات حجريّة قامت عليها، وكانت تلك الأحجار تقطع من جبل المحجر وغيره من الجبال المجاورة، وبالإضافة إلى الأساسات فقد كانت الأحجار تستخدم في الأحواض الحجرية والأعمدة وتيجانها. تم العثور في المنطقة السكنية على العديد من الأشياء كالعملات والفخاريات والمساجر والمجامر والدمى وغيرها من الأشياء التي أُرِّخَت في الفترة النبطية.\n\nالآبار والقنوات المائية\nتوجد بالموقع مجموعة من الآبار والقنوات المائية، حيث عُثر على أكثر من ستين بئرا محفورة في الصخر، بعضها يصل عمقه لأكثر من ثلاثين متراً، وهي تتمثل بآبار دائرية المقطع يضيق قطرها من الأسفل وبعضها مطوي، فقد عُرِف عن الأنباط عنايتهم بالمياه وحفظها والتحكم بها عن طريق شبكة هندسية دقيقة، وقد ظل بعض هذه الآبار مستخدماً إلى وقتٍ قريب. أما فيما يتعلق بقنوات المياه فقد تم الكشف عن جزء منها، وهي مبنية من الحجر يتصل بعضها بصهاريج كانت تستخدم في تخزين المياه والتي هي الأخرى مبنية من الحجر ومبنية تحت الأرض، وبعض هذه الصهاريج يحتوي على فتحات لاستخراج المياه.\n\nالبئر النبطية\nالبئر النبطية عبارة عن بئر عميقة تقع قرب جبل المحجر ومجموعة القبور الموجودة حوله، وهي واحدة من خمسة وستين بئراً اكتشفت بالموقع، وكان قد استخدمها الأنباط في ري مزروعاتهم وسقياهم. حالياً البئر محاطة بسياج معدني يمنع النزول إليها، وهناك مجرى محفور في الصخور الواقعة في الجبل كان يستخدم في توجيه المياه من الجبل إلى البئر.\n\nمدافن الرجوم الركامية\nهنالك مدافن على شكل رجم من الحجارة يتراوح عرضه ما بين متر ونصف إلى عشرة أمتار، بينما يصل ارتفاع بعضها إلى المتر، تحتوي بعضها على دعامات بشكل سرداب. معظم هذه المدافن تقع على قمم التكوينات الصخرية الممتدة في الأجزاء الجنوبية والغربية من مدائن صالح، وقد تم تسجيل أكثر من 325 موقعاً. في 2008م أجريت حفريات أثرية للمدافن، حيث كانت قبل عملية الحفر تبدو كرجم من الحجارة بعرض سبعة أمتار وارتفاع متر، وبعد الحفر ظهر بأن هيكل المدفن عبارة عن مقبرة تتخذ شكل برج قطره 7,30 م يتكون من وحدتين بينهما فاصل بطول 1,90 م مليء بكتل حجرية، ويبدو أن المدفن يعود إلى الألف الثاني أو الثالث قبل الميلاد، حيث أنه يختلف عن الأسلوب النبطي، ويرجح أنه يرتبط بحضارة أخرى.\n\nطريق الحج الشامي\nفي العهد العثماني وفي سبيل حماية قوافل الحجاج تم إنشاء عدة قلاع على امتداد الطريق المؤدي إلى بلاد الشام، منها قلعة الحجر العثمانية في مدائن صالح، وهي عبارة عن مبنى مربّع الشكل مكوّن من طابقين، في شمالها يوجد المدخل ويعلوه برج للمراقبة، وهذا المدخل يؤدي إلى فناء داخلي يتوسطه بئر مطوي، وتتوزع حوله الغرف في جهاته الأربع، كما أن هناك مُصلّى صغير يقع في جنوب الفناء. في الطابق العلوي هناك أبراج تتوزع في أركان القلعة، كما تكثر فتحات السهام في الطابق، بالإضافة إلى ذلك توجد في جنوب القلعة بِرْكة تستمدّ ماؤها من البئر الموجودة هناك.\n\nسكة حديد الحجاز\nفي بداية القرن الرابع عشر الهجري الموافق للقرن العشرين الميلادي أمر السلطان عبد الحميد الثاني بإنشاء سكة حديد على أن تربط إسطنبول بالمدينة المنورة مروراً ببلاد الشام، وكان قد بدأ المشروع بالحط سنة 1317 هـ الموافقة لسنة 1899م وانتهى سنة 1325 هـ الموافقة بسنة 1907م، حيث كانت مدائن صالح إحدى محطاته الرئيسية، وقد احتوت المحطة على ستة عشر مبنى منها ورشة إصلاح القاطرات، وورشة إصلاح المحرّكات، ومبنيين للحراسة ومخازن للعفش، ومساكن للموظفين، واستراحات ودورات مياه مستقلة بالإضافة إلى خزّان للمياه، ظلّت المحطة مستخدمة إلى أن تعطلت الحركة بالسكة سنة 1336 هـ الموافقة لسنة 1918م.\n\nآثار قرية الحِجْر\nهناك آثار تتكون من بيوت طينية كانت سكناً لأناس من قبيلة عنزة، معظم هذه المباني تتكون من طابق واحد، ولا تشكل نسيجاً عمرانيّاً متصلاً، وذلك كونها تنتشر في أكثر من مكان داخل الموقع، وهي تمثّل أسلوب العمارة في الحِجْر في الماضي القريب.\n\nالسياحة\nتتميز مدائن صالح كونها إحدى أهم وأبرز الوجهات السياحية في السعودية، حيث أنه في سنة 2008، أعلنت منظمة الأمم المتحدة للعلوم والتربية والثقافة (اليونسكو) أن مدائن صالح موقع تراث عالمي، وبذلك أصبح أول موقع في السعودية ينضم إلى قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي، ثم تلى ذلك انضمام حي الطريف في مدينة الدرعية التاريخية، بالإضافة إلى جدة التاريخية.\nتقع مدائن صالح بالقرب من مدينة العُلا والتي هي بدورها تحتوي على عدد من الآثار، وهي مدينة أشبه بالبلدة، إلا أنها تتمتع بوجود عدد من الفنادق ودور السكن فيها ذات مستوى جيد، وهي تستقبل عدداً من السياح والزوار طيلة أيام السنة، وتكتظ في فترة العطلات، حيث يشهد شهرا شوّال ومُحرّم من التقويم الهجري،

      "content": "Mada’in Saleh (en arabe : مدائن صالح, Madā’in Ṣāliḥ) est un lieu situé dans le nord-ouest de l'Arabie saoudite, à 20 km au nord de l'oasis d'al-ʿUlā. On y trouve les vestiges de la cité nabatéenne d'Hégra (ou Al-Hijr) sur plus de 1000 hectares (3 km2) de désert. Son nom provient d'un personnage du Coran nommé Sâlih.\nLe site est occupé depuis le Néolithique, mais c'est durant l'Antiquité que l'oasis située sur la piste caravanière reliant Pétra au Hedjaz connait son apogée. Cela se traduit par le contrôle du site par les Nabatéens qui, s'inspirant de Pétra, y construisent 138 tombeaux rupestres monumentaux. Les méthodes de construction sont identiques, les bâtisseurs commençant par le haut des façades, détruisant après chaque étape de la construction la plateforme taillée à même le grès qu'ils utilisaient pour atteindre ces hauteurs. Après l'intégration de la Nabatène à l'empire romain au début du IIe siècle, ce dernier exerce un contrôle sur la route caravanière, mais ce sont ensuite les populations arabes qui prennent le relais. Ces derniers empruntent l'écriture nabatéenne pour créer la leur, d'où naît l'écriture arabe. La population locale ayant besoin de protection migre vers Al-'Ula, mieux protégée, et le site de Hégra perd son importance. Pendant la période musulmane, il devient une simple étape du pèlerinage à la Mecque. La ville est redécouverte par les européens à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nSurnommé la seconde Pétra au vu de la richesse de ses tombeaux taillés dans la roche, le site antique est reconnu par l'Unesco en 2008 sous le nom de site archéologique de Al-Hijr. Il devient le premier site d'Arabie saoudite à être inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial. Dès lors, le tourisme se développe et le gouvernement cherche à améliorer l'attractivité du site, ainsi que des oasis alentour, pour en faire un site touristique de premier plan.\n\nGéographie\nMada’in Saleh est situé à une vingtaine de kilomètres de l'oasis d'al-ʿUlā, à 400 km au nord-ouest de Médine et au carrefour entre la péninsule Arabique, la Syrie, la Jordanie et la Mésopotamie.\n\nSituation\nSitué au cœur du Hedjaz, Mada’in Saleh s'étend au pied du massif Harrat 'Uwayrid qui culmine à 1 840 mètres. Le site s’inscrit dans une plaine qui mesure 23 km du nord au sud et 15 km d'est en ouest. Bordée à l'ouest par le Harrat 'Uwayrid et par des massifs moins élevés au nord, à l'est et au sud, la plaine est traversée par un oued. Des buttes de grès plus ou moins distantes les unes des autres constituent la roche dans laquelle sont creusés les tombeaux rupestres monumentaux .\n\nGéologie\nLes formations de grès dans lesquels les tombes sont taillées datent du Cambrien. Depuis leur formation, la tectonique a modifié la morphologie du site, avec l'ouverture de la mer Rouge il y a 30 millions d'années. Ainsi, un réseau de diaclases se crée au sein des grès. À la fin du Miocène, l'érosion joue un rôle et le plateau de grès se disloque en plusieurs morceaux, dont seuls les plus résistants subsistent. Cela aboutit à la formation des buttes et des collines actuelles. Enfin, le Harrat 'Uwayrid, protégé par la couche de lave formée par l’activité volcanique au cours du Cénozoïque, s'est peu érodé par rapport au reste de la région.\n\nClimat\nLe climat de Mada’in Saleh est aride, sinon hyperaride, les conditions climatiques actuelles étant à peu près les mêmes qu'à l'époque antique.\nLes précipitations varient de 2 à 100 mm par an en moyenne. Les épisodes pluvieux sont rares, environ trois à quatre par an, mais ils peuvent être très violents et entraîner des inondations et des crues.\nLa température moyenne annuelle est de 22 °C, avec une moyenne hivernale de 12 °C et une moyenne estivale de 30 °C. Les pointes de température peuvent atteindre 0 °C en hiver et 45 °C en été. En mars, les premières grosses chaleurs s'accompagnent d'une prolifération de mouches. Des épisodes de vents violents, notamment d'un vent de sable chaud, le khamsin, surviennent au printemps ou au début de l'été.\n\nHydrologie et agriculture\nComme dans tout désert, les précipitations annuelles sont faibles. Les ressources en eau ne proviennent pas des pluies, mais d'une nappe phréatique fossile générée par les écoulements souterrains depuis le Harrat 'Uwayrid. Ce massif marqué par de nombreuses incisions ouest-est fait converger les eaux vers la plaine de Madâ'in Sâlih. C'est cette nappe qui a permis le développement du site urbain dans la région. Le prélèvement abondant et régulier de l'eau a permis de faire vivre les hommes depuis l'Antiquité. Cependant, l'introduction des pompes mécaniques a fait baisser le niveau de la nappe depuis les années 1970. Seuls 10 à 20 mm d'eau provenant du Harrat 'Uwayrid arrivent annuellement dans la nappe, ce qui permettait de garantir un niveau constant de la nappe qui s'est formée entre −10 000 à −7 000 ans avant J.-C..\nAu temps des Nabatéens, 130 puits ont été creusés dans les parties nord et nord-ouest du site. La géologie a permis la réalisation de puits de 7 mètres de diamètre pour une profondeur allant jusqu'à 17 mètres. Ces puits servent à l'irrigation et au développement de l'agriculture sur environ 400 hectares d'après les dernières recherches scientifiques. De plus, avec une concentration de chlorure de sodium dans le sol de 0,6 à 1%, seuls le palmier dattier, l'orge et les légumineuses peuvent être cultivés .\n\nFaune et végétation\nLa région de Mada’in Saleh se situe dans le domaine phytogéographique saharo-arabique, ou saharo-indien, car il couvre les régions désertiques comprises entre le Sahara et le sud du Pakistan. La flore la plus représentée dans la région est l'arbuste de la famille des amaranthacées, comme le Haloxylon salicornicum, un buisson ramifié presque sans feuilles d'environ 60 cm de hauteur et appelé \"rimth\" en arabe. D'autres arbustes et buissons sont présents, comme le pommier de Sodome ou l'épine du désert, de même qu'un grand nombre d'herbacées comme le pourpier, la luzerne sauvage, la mauve et l'anthémis, qui se développent annuellement à la faveur des pluies rares. Concernant les arbres, les acacias sont les plus présents. Le tamaris a été introduit pour réaliser des haies autour des zones cultivées et créer un écran contre le vent.\nLes recherches archéologiques permettent de connaitre la faune présente durant l'Antiquité. L'alimentation principale de la population était constituée de moutons et de chèvres, mais aussi de poissons (poissons perroquets et mérous) et d'oiseaux (autruches et poulets). La présence de dromadaires (nourriture des soldats romains) et d'équidés est également attestée. Les coquillages servent à fabriquer des pendentifs. Aujourd'hui, les animaux sauvages que l'on trouve dans la région sont le renard roux, le lièvre du Cap et le hérisson du désert. Chez les rongeurs, la présence de gerbilles, de souris épineuses et de rats des sables est aussi attestée. Les souris grises et les rats liés à la présence humaine sont aussi présents. Quant aux oiseaux, vautours fauves, aigles impériaux, faucons crécerelles, hirondelles du désert, guêpiers d'Orient, bulbuls d'Arabie ainsi que des corvidés, tourterelles, pigeons, pies-grièches peuplent le site. Le soir, on peut apercevoir des chauves-souris. Enfin, serpents, lézards et agames sont observables dans la cité.\n\nHistoire\nNéolithique\nLa présence humaine sur le site de Madâin Sâlih remonte à l'âge du bronze ancien. Il n'y a pas de trace d'occupation sédentaire, mais des tombes à cairn sont présentes. Il en existe quatre types. Ces dernières sont très répandues au Proche-Orient, mais difficiles à dater car pillées au fil du temps et peu de matériel archéologique est arrivé jusqu'à notre époque. Elles permettent néanmoins de dater la présence humaine d'entre le IVe et le IIIe millénaires av. J.-C. Une tombe typique est composée de deux éléments : une ou plusieurs structures formées de deux parements parallèles maçonnés, au centre desquels sont aménagés deux ou trois compartiments pouvant atteindre 2 m de long, et une tombe en forme de tour.\nDes restes humains datés de la fin du IIIe millénaire av. J.-C. ont été trouvés dans un des compartiments d'une tombe située au sud-ouest du site de fouille, ainsi que quatre-vingt-deux perles en coquillages composant un ou plusieurs bracelets. Près de Tayma, à 115 km au nord-est de Madâin Sâlih, se trouvent d'autres tombes. Il peut s'agir d'une tradition funéraire propre à l’Arabie du Nord-Ouest.\n\nAntiquité\nPériode lihyanite\nLe site commence à être occupé de manière permanente à partir de la période lihyanite, entre le VIe et le IVe siècle av. J.-C. Cette occupation est confirmée par la présence d'inscriptions en caractères dadanites et araméens, mais aussi par la présence de graines, de charbon de bois et de céramiques dans la zone de fouille de la zone résidentielle.\n\nPériode pré-nabatéenne\nAvant l'arrivée des Nabatéens, la science ne permet pas de savoir si la population locale reste sous influence lihyanite ou bien d'une autre civilisation (d'une tribu d'Arabie du Nord ou des Minéens). Cela est dû au fait que le site se trouve sur la route terrestre de l'encens. Ainsi, les échanges commerciaux entre le IIIe siècle et le Ier siècle av. J.-C. se renforcent dans ce secteur. La découverte de trois cents pièces d'or d'influence grecque indique que le secteur a des liens avec la civilisation hellénistique, mais il est difficile de savoir quel roi est responsable du secteur. En effet, les tétradrachmes athéniens d'époque classique, qui présentent à l'avers une tête d'Athéna casquée et au revers une chouette avec les lettres grecques A-th-e (Alpha-théta-epsilon), sont facilement imitables et ne donnent aucun indice sur le souverain en place dans la région. Il est possible que ces pièces aient été frappées sur place et non pas importées lors d'échanges avec d'autres royaumes.\n\nPériode nabatéenne\nL'arrivée des Nabatéens dans la région date du milieu du Ier siècle av. J.-C. Le royaume nabatéen, en pleine expansion, cherche alors à sécuriser sa frontière sud et à accéder aux ports de la mer Rouge dans le cadre des routes commerciales développées à cette époque. Il espère aussi contrôler la voie commerciale terrestre, et Hégra devient la plaque tournante de ces échanges. Les Nabatéens, dotés d'une organisation militaire et administrative, contrôlent facilement cette région.\nL'expansion de la cité de Hégra commence et de nouveaux quartiers sont créés à l'est du ouadi. Un grand sanctuaire urbain se développe sur une butte rocheuse, et des maisons en briques crues sont remplacées par des maisons en pierre. Un plan de développement de la ville prend forme, mais il ne semble pas avoir été respecté sur l'ensemble du terrain. Ce projet semble soutenu par Arétas IV, au vu du nombre de pièces de monnaie retrouvées sur le site et portant l'inscription \"Hijrâ\". Un rempart en briques crues est construit vers la fin du Ier siècle av. J.-C. C'est pendant cette période que la spectaculaire nécropole rupestre est aménagée, tandis que les confréries religieuses se multiplient au sein de la cité. Hégra devient une ville de province à l'image de la capitale, Pétra. Afin de gérer la ville, un stratège assure l'administration de la région jusqu'à l'annexion romaine en 106 après J.-C.\n\nPériode romaine\nEn 106, à la suite du décès du dernier roi nabatéen Rabbel II, le sénateur romain Cornelius Palma pénètre avec ses troupes dans le pays. Le royaume devient alors une province romaine. Néanmoins, la découverte d'une inscription dans le Jabal Ithlib mentionnant le nom d'un roi postérieur au dernier roi indique la subsistance d'un pouvoir nabatéen. Ce n'est que cinq ans plus tard que les romains annoncent l'annexion du royaume.\nLa ville se transforme peu pendant la période romaine. En effet, elle est complètement excentrée vis à vis de Bosra, nouvelle capitale de cette province, et accessible uniquement par voie terrestre. Seul un fort où stationne la IIIe Légion cyrénaïque est construit, et le rempart réaménagé côté sud-est pour les besoins des Romains. La ville a désormais une vocation militaire, mais la culture reste nabatéenne. Elle demeure sous domination romaine jusqu'aux années 360, puis des chefs arabes sont désignés par les Romains pour gouverner. Contrairement au site de Pétra où des églises sont construites, aucune présence chrétienne n'est avérée à Hégra.\n\nMoyen Age\nLe site est quasiment inoccupé pendant la période islamique, les habitants ayant migré à Al-'Ula, plus facile à défendre. Seules quelques inscriptions gravées sur des tombes montrent que la région passe sous domination islamique. Le site devient alors une simple étape du pèlerinage à la Mecque.\n\nEpoque moderne\nUn fort ottoman est construit pour contrôler la région entre 1744 et 1757. Au début du XXe siècle, la plaine de Madâin Sâlih connaît un nouveau regain d'attractivité, avec la construction en 1907 du chemin de fer du Hedjaz par les Ottomans et les Allemands . Elle est alors une escale obligée pour les pèlerins musulmans faisant le hajj, qui partent de Damas ou d'autres lieux au nord. Ce chemin de fer est détruit et abandonné au cours de la Première Guerre mondiale.\nÀ la suite de fouilles archéologiques, la zone est devenue un site touristique.\n\nArchitecture\nGénéralités\nComme Pétra, il s'agit d'une grande ville pour l'époque, qui possède des places, des rues et un important réseau d'irrigation pour les terres agricoles des alentours, ainsi que des aqueducs et des puits amenant l'eau à la ville. Elle servait peut-être aussi de poste militaire, étant à 20 km au nord du royaume de Dédân.\nEnviron 130 tombes rupestres à façades monumentales sont creusées sur le modèle de celles de Pétra, majoritairement sous le règne du roi Arétas IV (9 av. J.C. - 40 apr. J.-C.). La technique de taille a été reconstituée, les tailleurs commençant par le haut. A la différence de Pétra, beaucoup d'inscriptions nabatéennes accompagnant ces tombes sont gravées dans la roche, indiquant les noms des propriétaires.\n\nFouilles archéologiques\nTraces historiques\nCette ville est mentionnée plusieurs fois dans le Coran. La sourate 15 notamment porte son nom : Al-Hijr. Sont aussi mentionnés le peuple qui habitait la cité, les Thamoudéens, et le prophète Sâlih qui lui a donné son nom.\n\nRedécouverte par les Européens au XIXe siècle\nLe voyageur Jean-Louis Burkhardt (1784-1817) rapporte ces récits sur Pétra en 1811. Puis Richard Francis Burton (1853), Heinrich von Maltzan (1860), Christiaan Snouck (1885) et William Palgrave le visitèrent à leur tour. En 1888, Charles Montagu Doughty publie ses Travels in Arabia Deserta, un récit des voyages qu'il effectua en 1876 à Tayma, Madâin Sâlih, Khaybar, Haïl, Bereida, Aneiza et Taëf.\n\nFouilles au XXe siècle\nAu XXe siècle, les premiers voyageurs européens à avoir documenté leurs visites à Hégra sont Antonin Jaussen et Raphaël Savignac, des frères dominicains et archéologues basés à Jérusalem. Ils explorèrent la ville de 1907 à 1910 et écrivirent un livre détaillant leurs découvertes, titré Mission archéologique en Arabie. Ils datent les inscriptions sur les tombes du Ier siècle, les plus raffinées étant celles du règne du roi nabatéen Arétas IV (de l'an 9 av. J.-C. à l'an 40).\n\nFouilles franco-saoudiennes au XXIe siècle\nDepuis 2001, des fouilles ont permis de trouver de petits monuments inédits, isolés ou groupés et dispersés. Les chercheurs ont essayé de comprendre les pratiques cultuelles des anciens Nabatéens.\nLe site est étudié depuis le début des années 2000 par une mission archéologique franco-saoudienne, co-dirigée par Dhaifallah al-Talhi et Laïla Nehmé, chercheuse au CNRS. Tous les tombeaux rupestres pillés dans l'Antiquité ont été fouillés. Un seul tombeau inviolé a été découvert, permettant d'étudier plus précisément les rites funéraires des Nabatéens. Dans la ville d'Al-'Ula, au sud du site, les fouilles ont porté sur des secteurs d'habitations, un sanctuaire au centre de la ville, une porte fortifiée et un fort d'époque romaine dans le sud de la ville.\nParmi les monuments récemment découverts, un sanctuaire rupestre, le Qasr al-Ajuz, au sud-ouest de Jabal Ithlib (al-Hijr), se compose d'une salle creusée dans une colline et garnie de niches à bétyles. Au sommet, des vestiges inédits ont été découverts, dont 11 niches horizontales creusées dans la roche qui devaient être des autels pour bétyles. À cet endroit se trouvent également des fosses peu profondes : cupules et petits canaux, certainement des lieux de sacrifice.\nL'ensemble forme une voie processionnelle miniature où les adorateurs se réunissaient d'après les chercheurs. Ces derniers concluent que l'intérieur est un haram, un lieu sacré à accès restreint. À la différence de Pétra, ce sanctuaire est un centre cultuel des thiases, dont l'espace limité était partagé entre différentes divinités . Quelques rares exemples d'autres sanctuaires pré-islamiques à ciel ouvert ont également été découverts dans le Sinaï et le Néguev, confirmant la persistance dans ces régions isolées de cultes païens jusqu'au début de l'Islam. Le mihrab se serait ainsi substitué au bétyle.\nDe nombreuses inscriptions antiques ont été retrouvées : inscriptions lihyanites (les plus anciennes datant des derniers siècles avant J.-C.), nabatéennes (datant du Ier siècle, époque durant laquelle la cité faisait partie du royaume nabatéen), grecques et latines (des IIe et IIIe siècles, époque durant laquelle la cité faisait partie de l'Empire romain).\n\nTourisme\nL'aéroport Al-'Ula est ouvert depuis fin 2010 (auparavant les aéroports les plus proches étaient Haïl et Al Wajh). L'accès au site, implanté à 23 km au Nord d'Al-'Ula, se fait par la route 70, en suivant la direction signalée par \"Antiquités\". Une autorisation d'accès est nécessaire, à faire établir par une agence ou un hôtel, et à présenter sur le site avec un passeport et un visa.\n\nAttentat du 26 février 2007\nLe 26 février 2007, un groupe d'expatriés français revenant du site archéologique est attaqué par des hommes affiliés à Al-Qaïda. Les terroristes ouvrent le feu et abattent trois personnes. Une quatrième, un adolescent, décède le lendemain de ses blessures. Pour ce crime, deux Saoudiens ont été exécutés en 2014.\n\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nLaïla Nehmé, Archéologie aux pays des Nabatéens d'Arabie : Guide de Hégra, Paris, Hémisphères éditions, 2019, 261 p.
