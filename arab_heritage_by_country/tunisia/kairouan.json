      "content": "Kairouan (UK: , US: ), also spelled El Qayrawān or Kairwan (Arabic: ٱلْقَيْرَوَان, romanized: al-Qayrawān [æl qɑjrɑˈwæːn] , Tunisian Arabic: Qeirwān [qɪrˈwɛːn] ), is the capital of the Kairouan Governorate in Tunisia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was founded by the Umayyads around 670, in the period of Caliph Mu'awiya (reigned 661–680); this is when it became an important centre for Sunni Islamic scholarship and Quranic learning, attracting Muslims from various parts of the world. The Mosque of Uqba is situated in the city.\n\nEtymology\nThe name (ٱلْقَيْرَوَان al-Qayrawān) is an Arabic word meaning \"military group\" or \"caravan\", borrowed early on from the Middle Persian word kārawān (modern Persian کاروان kârvân), meaning \"military column\" (kâr \"people/military\" + vân \"outpost\") or \"caravan\" (see caravanserai). In Berber, the city used to be called تيكيروان Tikirwan, thought to be an adaptation of the Arabic name. It has also been romanized as Cairoan in early modern English.\n\nHistory\nFoundation and early Islamic period\nThe foundation of Kairouan dates to about the year 670 when the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi of Caliph Mu'awiya selected a site in the middle of a dense forest, then infested with wild beasts and reptiles, as the location of a military post for the conquest of the West. Formerly, the city of Kamounia was located where Kairouan now stands. It had housed a Byzantine garrison before the Arab conquest, and stood far from the sea – safe from the continued attacks of the Berbers who had fiercely resisted the Arab invasion. Berber resistance continued, led first by Kusaila, whose troops killed Uqba at Biskra about fifteen years after the establishment of the military post, and then by a Berber woman called Al-Kahina who was killed and her army defeated in 702. Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the Berbers to Islam. Kharijites or Islamic \"outsiders\" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of Djerba.\nIn October 741, in the course of the Great Berber Revolt in the Maghreb, the Ifriqiyan army, along with a Syrian force dispatched by the caliph, was destroyed by the Berbers at the Battle of Bagdoura. The governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi perished in the field, his nephew and successor Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri was holed up with the remnant of the army in Spain, leaving the whole of Ifriqiya open to the advance of the Berber rebels. Not having any more forces at his disposal, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham quickly appointed Handhala ibn Safwan as governor of Ifriqiya, with supervisory authority over all the Maghreb (North Africa west of Egypt) and al-Andalus (Spain), and instructed him to take whatever forces he could gather to defend Ifriqiya and quash the Berber rebellion. Leaving Egypt in the hand of Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami, Handhala set out westwards in February 742, picking up additional forces from Barqa (Cyrenaica) and Tripoli (Tripolitana). He arrived in Kairouan around April, 742. The qadi of Ifriqiya, Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, had been managing the defense of Kairouan, and succeeded in fending off an attack by the Berber rebel army raised in southern Tunisia by the Sufrite leader Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari. Handhala ibn Safwan arrived in Kairouan just as Oqasha was said to be mounting a new attack, in coordination with another large Berber army coming in from the west, led by Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari. The Berber rebel armies were to make junction in front of Kairouan, before launching their final attack on the city. Wasting no time, Handhala dispatched a cavalry force to slow down Abd al-Wahid's progress, and threw the bulk of his forces south, defeating Oqasha in a bloody battle at El-Qarn and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid's gigantic army, said to be some 300,000, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at al-Asnam in May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000–180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter.\n\nAghlabid period\nIn 745, Kharijite Berbers captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century.\n\nIn 800 Caliph Harun ar-Rashid in Baghdad confirmed Ibrahim as emir and hereditary ruler of Ifriqiya. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the Aghlabid dynasty which ruled Ifriqiya between 800 and 909. The new emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of Basra and Kufa and giving Tunisia a period of power and prosperity.\nThe Aghlabids built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of Arab and Islamic cultures attracting scholars from all over the Islamic World. In that period Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with glowing reports of the Aghlabid palaces, libraries and gardens – and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The Aghlabids also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.\n\nFatimid and Zirid period\nIn 893, through the mission of Abdullah al Mahdi, the Kutama Berbers from the west of the country started the movement of the Shiite Fatimids. The year 909 saw the overthrow of the Sunni Aghlabids who ruled Ifriqiya and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the Fatimids, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built Al Mahdiyah on the eastern coast of Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, they eventually moved east to Egypt to found Cairo making it the capital of their vast Caliphate and leaving the Zirids as their vassals in Ifriqiya. Governing again from Kairouan, the Zirids led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the Zirids rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the Zirids declared their independence from Cairo and their conversion to Sunni Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to Baghdad, the Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes (Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly captured Kairouan from the Zirids in 1057 and destroyed it that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries.\n\nLater history\nAl-Idrisi described the city in the 12th century:The city of Kairouan is the mother of settlements and the capital of regions. It was once the greatest city of the West in its expanse, the most populous, the wealthiest, the most prosperous, the most finely built, and the most ambitious, with the most profitable trade, the highest tax revenues, the most flourishing markets, and the greatest commercial gains, while its people were also the most rebellious and the most arrogant of the ignorant, yet among its virtuous elite, the dominant qualities were adherence to righteousness, fulfillment of covenants, avoidance of doubtful matters, abstention from prohibitions, mastery of refined sciences, and an inclination toward moderation. But God Almighty afflicted it with the Arabs, and calamities befell it one after another, until nothing remained of it but fading ruins and obliterated traces. In our present time, only a portion of it is enclosed by an earthen wall. Its rulers are Arabs, who collect whatever revenues remain. A few people still reside there, engaged in modest trade with meager benefits. Scholars speculate that it will soon return to its former state of prosperity and grandeur. Its water supply is scarce, and its inhabitants drink from the great cistern (majel) within the city. This cistern is an architectural marvel, as it is built in a square shape with a tower-like structure rising in the center. Each side measures two hundred cubits, and it remains filled with water. Kairouan was originally two cities: one was Kairouan itself, and the other was Sabra. Sabra was the royal residence, and at the height of its prosperity, it contained three hundred baths—most of them private, while the rest were public for all people. Sabra, however, is now in complete ruin, devoid of any inhabitants.\nIn the 13th century under the prosperous Hafsids dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the Husainid Dynasty that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world.\nIn 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the 600 mm (1 ft 11+5⁄8 in) Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway, which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge.\nThe old city of Kairouan and its associated historic monuments became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.\nIn December 2023, about 30m of wall near the Gate of the Leather Workers collapsed during restoration. Three masons were killed, and several others injured.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKairouan, the capital of Kairouan Governorate, lies south of Sousse, 50 km (31 mi) from the east coast, 75 km (47 mi) from Monastir and 184 km (114 mi) from Tunis.\n\nClimate\nKairouan has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, the city had about 187,000 inhabitants.\n\nReligion\nBetween the 9th and 11th centuries AD, Kairouan functioned as one of the great centers of Islamic civilization and gained a reputation as a hotbed of scholarship across the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan became both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. A unique religious tradition practiced in Kairouan was the use of Islamic law to enforce monogamy by stipulating it in the marriage contract. Local tradition holds that seven pilgrimages to the Great Mosque equals one pilgrimage to Mecca. According to some, this makes Kairouan the fourth holiest city in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. As of 2004, the city contained 89 mosques. Sufi festivals are held in the city in memory of saints.\nBefore the arrival of the French in 1881, non-Muslims were forbidden from living in Kairouan. A Christian community had existed during the early 11th century alongside Jews who were among the original settlers of Kairouan. The Jewish community's golden era began in the late 8th century and lasted until the early 11th century during which time it played an important role in Jewish history, having been a world center of Talmudic and Halakhic scholarship for at least three generations. The Banu Hilal conquest of Kairouan in 1057 led to the decline of the medieval community with Jews only returning after Tunisia was established as a French protectorate in 1881. By the 1960s the community had disappeared, and all that remains is their dilapidated cemetery.\n\nMain sights\nGreat Mosque of Kairouan\nThe city's main landmark is the Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba (also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan) which is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. Originally built when Kairouan was founded in 670 AD, the mosque currently occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world. The mosque became a center of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences and helped the city to develop and expand.\n\nMosque of the Three Doors\nThe Mosque of the Three Doors was founded in 866. Its façade is a notable example of Islamic architecture. It has three arched doorways surmounted by three inscriptions in Kufic script, interspersed with floral and geometrical reliefs and topped by a carved frieze; the first inscription includes the verses 70–71 in the sura 33 of Quran. The small minaret was added during the restoration works held under the Hafsid dynasty. The prayer hall has a nave and two aisles, divided by arched columns, parallel to the qibla wall.\n\nMosque of the Barber\nThe Zawiya of Sidi Sahib, also known as the Mosque of the Barber, is a religious complex containing the mausoleum of Abu Zama' al-Balawi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who, according to legend, had saved for himself three hairs of Muhammad's beard, hence the edifice's name. The complex was first built up in the 14th century under the Hafsids, but in its present state it dates from the 17th century, under the Muradids. The tomb chamber is accessed from a cloister-like court with rich tile and stucco decoration. In addition to the mausoleum, the complex includes a madrasa and several other facilities.\n\nAghlabid basins\nThe Aghlabid basins are a Tunisian historical monument located in Kairouan. Dating from the 9th century and located outside the ramparts of the medina of Kairouan, they are considered to be the most important hydraulic systems in the history of the Muslim world. The structure covers an area of 11,000 square meters and consists of a small settling basin, a large basin for storing water and two drawing tanks, all having a total storage capacity of 68,800 cubic meters.\n\nEconomy\nThe primary economic sectors in Kairouan are industry, agriculture and tourism.\n\nIndustry\nThe Kairouan region currently has 167 industrial companies offering more than 10,000 jobs, of which 33 are fully exporters.\nThe industrial activities of the region are quite diversified, although the agrifood industry sector is preeminent with 91 units.\n\nAgriculture\nThe governorate of Kairouan is known mainly for the production of vegetables (peppers, tomatoes) and fruits (apricots, almonds and olives). It is the leading national producer of chili peppers with nearly 90,000 tonnes in 2019, as well as apricots with more than 15,000 tonnes.\n\nTourism\nKairouan is one of the four most visited sites in Tunisia along with Carthage, El Jem and Le Bardo as historic sites. Tourist activity is focused on the historic sites and monuments of the city of Kairouan.\n\nFood\nKairouan is known for its pastries (e.g. zlebia and makroudh).\n\nIn popular culture\nKairouan was used as a filming location for the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, standing in for Cairo. As the film is set in 1936, television antennas throughout the city were taken down for the duration of filming.\n\nNotable people\nSu'da – historically attested Berber princess supposedly died there.\nNajla Bouden – 17th Prime Minister of Tunisia (first female prime minister in the Arab world).\nHabib Galhia, boxer\nHabiba Ghribi, athlete\nFatima al-Fihriya, founder of the first university in the world.\nSalih al-Souissi al-Qayrawani (1871–1941), writer and activist\n\nTwin towns\nGallery\nSee also\nKairouan's significance in Islam\nList of mosques in Kairouan\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nKairouan, tourismtunisia.com\nKairouan World heritage Site, whc.unesco.org\nKairouan University\nAl-Qayrawan, muslimheritage.com\nKairwan, jewishencyclopedia.com\nWorldStatesmen-Tunisia\nKAIROUAN, The Capital of Islamic Culture \nPanoramic virtual tour of Kairouan medina Archived 30 July 2021 at the Wayback Machine",

      "title": "القيروان",
      "content": "القَيْرَوَان ( أو )، مدينة تونسية، تبعد حوالي 160 كيلومتر عن تونس العاصمة والقيروان المعروفة بعاصمة الأغالبة هي أول المدن الإسلامية المشيدة في بلاد المغرب وكان لها دور استراتيجي في الفتح الإسلامي، انطلقت منها حملات الفتح نحو الجزائر والمغرب وإسبانيا وأفريقيا بالإضافة إلى أنها رقاد لعدد من صحابة رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ويطلق عليها الفقهاء «رابعة الثلاث،» بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة والقدس وفي هذه المدينة توجد أهم المعالم للقيروان، منها جامع القيروان الكبير و الذي أسسه عقبة بن نافع.\n\nتاريخ القيروان\nيعود تاريخ القيروان إلى عام 50 هـ / 670 م، عندما قام بإنشائها عقبة بن نافع. وكان هدفه من هذا البناء أن يستقر به المسلمون، إذ كان يخشى إن رجع المسلمون عن أهل إفريقية أن يعودوا إلى دينهم. وتعتبر القيروان من أقدم وأهم المدن الإسلامية، بل هي المدينة الإسلامية الأولى في منطقة المغرب الإسلامي ويعتبر إنشاء مدينة القيروان بداية تاريخ الحضارة العربية الإسلامية في المغرب العربي، فلقد كانت مدينة القيروان تلعب دورين هامين في آن واحد، هما: الجهاد والدعوة، فبينما كانت الجيوش تخرج منها للغزو والتوسعات، كان الفقهاء يخرجون منها لينتشروا بين البلاد يعلِّمون العربية وينشرون الإسلام. فهي بذلك تحمل في كلّ شبر من أرضها عطر مجد شامخ وإرثا عريقا يؤكده تاريخها الزّاهر ومعالمها الباقية التي تمثل مراحل هامة من التاريخ العربي الإسلامي. لقد بقيت القيروان حوالي أربعة قرون عاصمة الإسلام الأولى لإفريقية والأندلس ومركزا حربيّا للجيوش الإسلامية ونقطة ارتكاز رئيسية لإشاعة اللغة العربية. وعندما تذكر القيروان يذكر القائد العربي الكبير عقبة بن نافع وقولته المشهورة عندما بلغ في توسعاته المحيط الأطلسي وهو يرفع يده إلى السماء ويصرخ بأعلى صوته : «اللهم اشهد أني بلغت المجهول ولولا هذا البحر لمضيت في البلاد أقاتل من كفر بك حتى لا يعبد أحد من دونك». تقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 160 كم من العاصمة تونس. وكلمة القيروان كلمة فارسية دخلت إلى العربية، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش أو استراحة القافلة وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب..\n\nأصل التسمية\nيرجع أصل كلمة «القيروان» إلى كلمة «کاروان» الفارسية، والتي تعني الرَّتْل العسكري أو القافلة. وهي نفسها الكلمة التي أعطت «caravane» الفرنسية.\n\nاختيار موقع القيروان\nاجتمع عقبة بن نافع بعد انتهائه من بناء مدينة القيروان بوجود أصحابه وأهل العسكر فدار بهم حول مدينة القيروان، وأقبل يدعو لها ويقول في دعائه: اللهم املأها علما وفقها، وأعمرها بالمطيعين والعابدين، واجعلها عزا لدينك وذلا لمن كفر بك، وأعز بها الإسلام.\nفلما أرسى عقبة بن نافع قواعد مدينته الجديدة، لم يكن يدري وهو يدعو ربّه ليمنعها من جبابرة الأرض ويملأها فقهاً وعلماً ويجعلها عزّاً للإسلام أيّ مصير تخبِّئه لها الأيام، إلا أنه استراتيجياً كان موفَّقاً في اختياره، فالقيروان توجد على مسيرة يوم من البحر الذي كان البيزنطيون يسيطرون على عبابه، وهي تبعد بمثل ذلك عن الجبال، حيث كانت آنذاك تعتصم القبائل البربرية المناوئة للإسلام، وتمثل القاعدة المحدثة رأس الحربة وسط خط المواجهة المتخذ بين المسلمين والبيزنطيين، بعد انهزام ملكهم جرجير في سبيطلة أمام جيوش معاوية بن حديج سنة 45 هـ، 665 م وتراجع سلطانهم وانحصاره في شمال البلاد.\nبجانب ذلك فالقيروان في منبسط من الأرض مديد يسمح باستنفار الفرسان في غير صعوبة، وقد كانت الخيل قوام جيش المسلمين في جُلّ معاركهم وحروبهم المصيرية، وقد راعى عقبة في اختياره لموقع مدينته الجديدة تقريبها من السبخة حتى يوفّر ما تحتاجه الإبل من المراعي، وتسمية القيروان تستجيب للغرض الأصلي من تأسيسها فهي كلمة معرَّبة عن اللغة الفارسية وتعني المعسكر أو القافلة أو محط أثقال الجيش.\nولا ريب أن مختلف الحملات والغزوات التي سبقت بناء القيروان كانت تمر بالموقع، وتتّفق المصادر على أن معاوية بن حديج قد عسكر خلال إحدى حملاته الثلاث على إفريقيّة بالموضع المعروف بالقرن على بعد عشرة كيلومترات شمال غربي القيروان، كما تذكر كتب الطبقات أن الصحابي أبا زمعة البلوي قد استشهد خلال غزوة معاوية بن حديج الأولى العام 34 هـ، 654 م وهو محاصر لجلولة، فأُخذ ودُفن بموضع القيروان\n\nالمكانة العلمية للقيروان\nكانت القيروان أولى المراكز العلمية في المغرب العربي تليها قرطبة في الأندلس ثم فاس في المغرب الأقصى ولقد قصدها أبناء المغرب وغيرها من البلاد المجاورة. وكان مسجد عقبة الجامع ومعه بقية مساجد القيروان تعقد فيه حلقات للتدريس وأنشئت مدارس جامعة أطلقوا عليها (دور الحكمة). واستقدم لها العلماء والفقهاء ورجال الدعوة من الشرق فكانت هذه المدارس وما اقترن به إنشاؤها من انصراف القائمين عليها للدرس والبحث عاملا في رفع شأن لغة القرآن لغة العرب وثقافتهم.\nولقد كان للقيروان دور كبير في نشر وتعليم الدين وعلومه بحكم ما علق على هذه المدينة من آمال في هداية الناس وجلبهم إلى إفريقية وهي نقطة هامة لاحظها الفاتحون منذ أن استقر رأيهم على إنشاء مدينة القيروان، فعندما عزم عقبة بن نافع ومن معه على وضع محراب المسجد الجامع فكروا كثيرا في متجه القبلة، وراقبوا طلوع الشمس وغروبها عدة أيام. وقال له أصحابه:\n\nوأصبح محراب القيروان أسوة وقدوة لبقية مساجد المغرب الإسلامي بمعناه الواسع حتى إن محمد بن حارث الخشني بعد أن قدم من القيروان إلى سبتة وشاهد انحراف مسجدها عن قبلة الصلاة عدله وصوبه.\nوفي عهد الخليفة الأموي عمر بن عبد العزيز (99-101 هـ / 717 -720م) أراد تثقيف أهل المغرب وتعليمهم أمر دينهم فجعل من مدينة القيروان مركزا للبعثة العلمية المكونة من عشرة أشخاص من التابعين فأرسلهم إلى إفريقية حيث انقطعوا إلى تعليم السكان أمور الدين، ومات غالب أفراد البعثة في مدينة القيروان نفسها.\nوهكذا أصبحت مدينة القيروان مركزا للعلم في المغرب الإسلامي حتى كانت مفخرة المغرب. ومنها خرجت علوم المذهب المالكي، وإلى أئمتها كل عالم ينتسب وكان قاضي القيروان يمثل أعلى منصب ديني في عموم البلاد المغربية، وإليه المرجع في تسمية قضاة مختلف الجهات.\nو أسهمت القيروان في عهد الأغالبة في نشر المذهب المالكي في أرجاء الدولة الأغلبية، ومنها انتشر في صقلية والأندلس. وقد تم ذلك على يد الإمام سحنون (160-240 هـ / 777 -855م)، وأقرانه وتلاميذه. فهؤلاء كانوا يلتزمون المذهب المالكي، إذ أنهم كانوا يذهبون لأداء فريضة الحج، ثم يلزمون الإمام مالك بن أنس في المدينة المنورة، فتأثروا بفقهه. وقد ولي سحنون قضاء القيروان (234-240 هـ / 848 -854 م)، فكان صاحب النفوذ الأكبر لا في شئون القضاء فحسب، بل في جميع شئون الدولة. ولما عاد سحنون من المدينة المنورة كان قد وضع أسس الكتاب الذي دونه ويسمى المدونة التي أصبحت قاعدة التدريس في المغرب الأدنى، ومن هناك انتقلت إلى الأندلس. وكانت الكتب الفقهية التي ألفها علماء القيروان ابتداء من كتاب المدونة لصاحبه الفقيه الكبير سحنون والذي أصبح مرجعا دينيا لرجال القيروان، إلى رسالة ابن أبي زيد ونوادره وزياداته إلى تهذيب أبي سعيد البراذعي، كانت هذه الكتب وأمثالها عمدة الدارسين والشراح والمعلقين لا يعرفون غيرها إلى المائة السابعة من التاريخ الهجري عندما ابتدأت كتب المشارقة تأتي إلى المغرب مثل مختصر ابن الحاجب ومختصر خليل فيما بعد.\n\nبيت الحكمة\nأنشئت في القيروان المكتبات العامة والمكتبات الملحقة بالجوامع والمدارس والزوايا وكانت مفتوحة للدارسين وتضم نفائس أمهات الكتب. ومن أشهر مكتبات القيروان بيت الحكمة الذي أنشأه إبراهيم الثاني 261-289 هـ / 875 -902 م. في رقادة بالقيروان محاكاة لبيت الحكمة التي أسسها هارون الرشيد في بغداد حيث كانت هذه البيت نواة لمدرسة الطب القيروانية التي أثرت في الحركة العلمية في المغرب لزمن طويل.\nوقد استقدم إبراهيم بن أحمد الأغلبي أعدادا كبيرة من علماء الفلك والطب والنبات والهندسة والرياضيات من المشرق والمغرب وزوده بالآلات الفلكية. وكان إبراهيم بن أحمد يبعث كل عام (وأحيانا كل ستة أشهر) بعثة إلى بغداد هدفها تجديد ولائه للخلافة العباسية واقتناء نفائس الكتب المشرقية في الحكمة والفلك مما لا نظير له في المغرب واستقدام مشاهير العلماء في العراق ومصر. وعلى هذا النحو أمكنه في أمد قصير أن يقيم في رقادة نموذجا مصغرا من بيت الحكمة في بغداد، ولم يلبث هذا البيت أن وقع في أيدي الفاطميين بعد سنوات معدودة من وفاته.\nولقد كان بيت الحكمة معهدا علميا للدرس والبحث العلمي والترجمة من اللاتينية، ومركزا لنسخ المصنفات، وكان يتولى الإشراف عليه حفظة مهمتهم السهر على حراسة ما يحتويه من كتب، وتزويد الباحثين والمترددين عليه من طلاب العلم بما يلزمهم من هذه الكتب حسب تخصصاتهم، ويرأس هؤلاء الحفظة ناظر كان يعرف بصاحب بيت الحكمة.\nوأول من تولى هذا المنصب عالم الرياضيات أبو اليسر إبراهيم بن محمد الشيباني الكاتب المعروف بأبي اليسر الرياضي، وهو بغدادي النشأة، حيث أتيح له أن يلتقي بالعديد من المحدثين والفقهاء والأدباء واللغويين. وكان قد تنقل في أقطار المشرق قبل أنتقاله إلى الأندلس وأخيرا استقر بالقيروان.\nوكان الأمير إبراهيم بن أحمد يعقد المجالس العلمية للمناظرة في بيت الحكمة، وكان يحضر هذه المجالس العلماء البارزون من فقهاء المالكية والحنفية.\n\nالمساجد\nيعد مسجد القيروان الذي بناه عقبة بن نافع عند إنشاء المدينة من أهم معالمها عبر التاريخ. ولقد بدأ المسجد صغير المساحة، بسيط البناء، ولكن لم يمض على بنائه عشرون عاما حتى هدمه حسان بن نعمان الغساني وأقام مكانه مسجدا جديدا أكبر من الأول. وفي عهد الخليفة هشام بن عبد الملك أمر بزيادة مساحته، وأضاف إليه حديقة كبيرة في شماله، وجعل له صهريجا للمياه، وشيد مآذنه.\nوفي عام 155 هـ / 724 م أعيد بناؤه على يد يزيد بن حاتم، وظل على حاله هذه إلى أن تولى\nزيادة الله بن إبراهيم بن الأغلب إمارة إفريقية عام 201 هـ / 817 م فزاد فيه. ولقد سارت التوسعات في العصور المختلفة حتى أصبح يشغل اليوم مساحة مستطيلة تتراوح أضلاعها ما بين (70 و122) مترا.\nويعتبر جامع القيروان من أقدم مساجد المغرب الإسلامي والمصدر الأول الذي اقتبست منه العمارة المغربية والأندلسية عناصرها الزخرفية والمعمارية. كما كان هذا المسجد ميدانا للحلقات الدينية والعلمية واللغوية التي ضمت نخبة من أكبر علماء ذلك العصر.\n\nمن أعلام القيروان\nلقد تميّز كل عصر من عصور القيروان بعدد وافر من الأسماء والأعلام في شتى ضروب العلم والمعرفة لمّْا كانت عاصمة المغرب العربي وأعظم مدن القارة الإفريقية ومنارة عالية للإشعاع الفكري والديني والحضاري في عصور الأغالبة والفاطميين والصنهاجيين. ومن هؤلاء الأعلام الإمام سحنون وابن رشيق القيرواني وابن شرف وأسد بن الفرات وابن الجزار.\nلكن المهتمين بالتاريخ يذكرون خصوصا اسم المعزّ بن باديس الصنهاجي كأكبر رمز لما بلغته القيروان من حضارة في عهد الصنهاجيين وعبد الله بن الأغلب الذي جعل من القيروان اسما ملأ الدنيا، أما عقبة بن نافع فإنه يظل الفاتح والمؤسس.\nكان من أوائل من قام بالتعليم في مدينة القيروان أولئك العشرة من التابعين الذين أرسلهم عمر بن عبد العزيز ليعلموا الناس وكان من أشهر أولئك العشرة إسماعيل بن عبيد الله بن أبي المهاجر الذي كان -بالإضافة إلى أنه عامل للخليفة- من أكثر أفراد تلك البعثة اندفاعا في نشر الدين وإدخال البربر إلى الإسلام.\nوكان منهم عبد الله بن يزيد الحُبُلي الذي شهد الاستيلاء على الأندلس مع موسى بن نصير، ثم عاد إلى القيروان ومات فيها.\nومنهم أيضا إسماعيل بن عبيد المشهور بلقب «تاجر الله» وهو الذي بنى المسجد المعروف باسم مسجد الزيتونة، كما بنى سوقا للتجارة عرفت باسم سوق إسماعيل. وقد استشهد غريقا في إحدى الغزوات البحرية لصقلية سنة 107 هـ / 726 م، ومنهم عبد الرحمن بن رافع التنوخي أول من تولى القضاء بمدينة القيروان.\nوأما رواد الفقه في القيروان فهم كثير منهم الإمام سحنون بن سعيد الفقيه صاحب أبي القاسم - تلميذ الإمام مالك - ومؤلف كتاب المدونة والذي كان له دور كبير في تدوين المذهب المالكي، وقد حضر دروس هذا الفقيه العديد من طلاب الأندلس الذين قاموا بنشر مذهبه فيما بعد.\nوقد عرفت من رجال الفقه كذلك أسد بن الفرات قاضي إفريقية في عهد الأغالبة وقائد الحملة إلى صقلية وفاتح الجزيرة ومحمد ابن الإمام سحنون بن سعيد وابن أبي زيد القيرواني.\nكما اشتهر فيها من الشعراء: أبو عبد الله القزاز القيرواني، والحسين بن رشيق القيرواني، وابن هانئ الأندلسي.\nوكان من بين علمائها عبد الكريم النهشلي عالم اللغة وكان من أهل الأدب أبو إسحاق (الحصري) القيرواني صاحب زهر الآداب.\nأما عن مدرسة الطب فقد اشتهرت منها أسرة ابن الجزار التي توارثت الطب أبا عن جد.\n\nدورها\nلعبت مدينة القيروان دورا رئيسيا في القرون الإسلامية الأولى، فكانت العاصمة السياسية للمغرب الإسلامي ومركز الثقل فيه منذ ابتداء الفتح إلى آخر دولة الأمويين بدمشق. وعندما تأسست الخلافة العباسية ببغداد رأت فيها عاصمة العباسيين خير مساند لها لما أصبح يهدد الدولة الناشئة من خطر الانقسام والتفكك. ومع ظهور عدة دول مناوئة للعاصمة العباسية في المغرب الإسلامي فقد نشأت دولة الأمويين بالأندلس، ونشأت الدولة الرستمية في الجزائر، ونشأت الدولة الإدريسية العلوية في المغرب الأقصى.\nوكانت كل دولة من تلك الدول تحمل عداوة لبني العباس خاصة الدولة الإدريسية الشيعية التي تعتبرها بغداد أكبر خطر يهددها. لهذا كله رأى هارون الرشيد أن يتخذ سدا منيعا يحول دون تسرب الخطر الشيعي. ولم ير إلا عاصمة إفريقية قادرة على ذلك، فأعطى لإبراهيم بن الأغلب الاستقلال في النفوذ وتسلسل الإمارة في نسله.\nوقامت دولة الأغالبة (184-296هـ / 800 -909م) كوحدة مستقلة ومدافعة عن الخلافة. وقد كانت دولة الأغالبة هذا الدرع المنيع أيام استقرارها، ونجحت في ضم صقلية إلى ملكها عام 264 هـ / 878 م، وقام أمراؤها الأوائل بأعمال بنائية ضخمة في القيروان ذاتها ومنها توسيع الجامع في القيروان، وتوسيع الجامع في تونس، كما عمل الأغالبة على الاهتمام بالزراعة والري في المنطقة، وأقاموا الفسقية المشهورة.\nوقد استغل الأمراء الأغالبة تلك المكانة واتخذوها سلاحا يهددون به عاصمة بغداد كلما هم خليفة من خلفائها بالتقليل من شأن الأمراء الأغالبة أو انتقاص سيادتهم. وهذا ما فعله زيادة الله بن الأغلب مع الخليفة المأمون العباسي. فقد أراد هذا الأخير إلحاق القيراون بولاية مصر، وطلب من زيادة الله أن يدعو لعبد الله بن طاهر بن الحسين والي المأمون على مصر فأدخل زيادة الله رسول المأمون إليه، وقال له: إن الخليفة يأمرني بالدعاء لعبد خزاعة. هذا لا يكون أبدا ثم مد يده إلى كيس بجنبه فيه ألف دينار ودفعه للرسول. وكان في الكيس دنانير مضروبة باسم الأدارسة في المغرب ؛ ففهم المأمون مقصد الأمير الأغلبي فكف عن محاولته ولم يعد إليها.\nوبسبب هذه المكانة فقد عمل على التقرب منها أكبر ملك في أوروبا إذ بعث الإمبراطور شارلمان بسفرائه إلى إبراهيم بن الأغلب فقابلهم في دار الإمارة بالعباسية في أبهة عجيبة بالرغم من الصلات الودية التي كانت بين هذا الإمبراطور والخليفة العباسي هارون الرشيد.\nوفي عهد ولاية إبراهيم بن أحمد بن محمد بن الأغلب (261 - 289 هـ / 875 -902 م) بدأت الفتن تدب بين أمراء الأغالبة. وكان إبراهيم بن أحمد سفاحا لم تسلم منه عامة الناس ولا أقرب الناس إليه وكان غدره بسبعمائة من أهل بلزمة سنة 280 هـ / 894 م سببا من أسباب سقوط دولة بني الأغلب. وفي نفس السنة شقت عصا الطاعة في وجه هذا الأمير مدن تونس، وباجة، وقمودة، وغيرها. وعمت الفوضى أرجاء البلاد بينما الخطر العبيدي الشيعي يزداد يوما بعد يوم. ولما أيقن إبراهيم بن أحمد بخطر بني عبيد حاول سنة 289 هـ /902 م تغيير سياسته، فرفع المظالم، واستمال الفقهاء، وبذل الأموال للشعب ولكن بدون جدوى. وفي عهد حفيده زيادة الله ازداد خوف بغداد واشتد جزعها من الزحف العبيدي فبعث الخليفة العباسي المكتفي بالله يحث أهل إفريقية على نصرة زيادة الله فلم يكن لذلك صدى في النفوس وبذل زيادة الله الأموال بلا حساب ولكن دون جدوى. فلم يمض على هذا الحادث سوى ثلاث سنوات حتى جاءت معركة الأربس الحاسمة سنة 296 هـ / 909 م وفر على إثرها زيادة الله إلى\nالمشرق ومعه وجوه رجاله وفتيانه وعبيده. وباستيلاء العبيديين على القيروان جمعوا كل المغرب تحت سيطرتهم فشجعهم ذلك على متابعة السير نحو المشرق. وأمكن لهم فيما بعد أن يستولوا على مصر والشام والحجاز. ولولا الظروف السياسية والوضع الداخلي للفاطميين لاستولوا على بغداد نفسها.\n\nوعندما انتقل بنو عبيد إلى مصر ووصل المعز لدين الله الفاطمي القاهرة عام 362 هـ / 973 م اهتموا بالقيروان واتخذوها مركزا لنائبهم في إفريقية، وعهدوا إليه بالسهر على حفظ وحدة المغرب والسيطرة عليه. واستخلف المعز الفاطمي بلكين بن زيري الصنهاجي على إفريقية، وكتب إلى العمال وولاة الأشغال بالسمع والطاعة له فأصبح أميرا على إفريقية والمغرب كله، وقام بلكين وخلفاؤه بقمع الثورات التي حصلت خاصة في المغرب في قبائل زناتة.\nواستمر المغرب في وحدته الصنهاجية وتبعيته إلى مصر الفاطمية إلى أن انقسم البيت الصنهاجي على نفسه فاستقل حماد الصنهاجي عن القيروان متخذا من القلعة التي بناها قاعدة لإمارته. وكان هذا الانقسام السياسي خير ممهد لظهور دولة المرابطين في المغرب الأقصى. كما كان لهذا الانقسام نتائجه الأليمة فيما بعد عندما أعلن المعز ابن باديس الصنهاجي استقلاله عن الفاطميين، فبعثوا إليه بقبائل الأعراب من الهلاليين فمزق شمل الدولة، وقضى على معالم الحضارة، وخربت القيروان، ولم تعد العاصمة السياسية القوية أو مركزا تشع منه المعارف والعلوم والآداب.\nالشيخ عبد الرحمن خليف (27 ماي 1917 - 19 فيفري 2006)\n\nالمدينة الحديثة\nإحدى أهم المدن التونسية ومقر الولاية (117.903 ألف نسمة، عام 2004).

      "content": "Kairouan (arabe : ٱلْقَيْرَوَان, /qɪrwɛːn/ ) est une ville du centre de la Tunisie et le chef-lieu du gouvernorat du même nom. Elle se situe à 150 kilomètres au sud-ouest de Tunis et 50 kilomètres à l'ouest de Sousse. Peuplée de 139 070 habitants en 2014, elle est souvent désignée comme la quatrième ville sainte (ou sacrée) de l'islam et la première ville sainte du Maghreb.\nPremière ville arabe et musulmane d'Afrique du Nord, Kairouan a été un centre majeur pour la diffusion de l'islam et de la langue arabe au Maghreb. La ville conserve encore aujourd'hui une place particulière pour les musulmans de la région, notamment pendant le Mouled, où des fidèles de toute la Tunisie et d'autres pays affluent pour participer aux célébrations.\nAvec sa médina et ses marchés organisés par corporations à la mode orientale, ses mosquées et autres édifices religieux, Kairouan est inscrite depuis 1988 sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. En 2009, elle est proclamée capitale de la culture islamique par l'Organisation du monde islamique pour l'éducation, les sciences et la culture.\nLa ville est aussi réputée pour ses tapis de laine artisanaux et ses pâtisseries dont les makrouds.\n\nÉtymologie\nLe nom de la ville, Kairouan (en arabe : قيروان, Qayrawân), est une déformation du mot persan (en persan : کاروان, kârvân) signifiant « camp militaire » (kâr pour guerre/militaire lié au latin guer et vân pour campement), « caravane » ou « lieu de repos ».\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nKairouan est située à 70 kilomètres de la côte méditerranéenne. Son territoire est délimité par Sbikha au nord, Chebika à l'ouest, Bou Hajla et Nasrallah au sud.\n\nClimat\nLe climat de la ville est plus chaud et sec par rapport au littoral.\n\nHistoire\nFondation de la ville\nC'est sous la direction d'Oqba Ibn Nafi al-Fihri que la ville de Kairouan est fondée. Bien que la date de 670 soit souvent reprise en tant que date de fondation de la ville, celle-ci reste sujette à discussion. \nEn effet, la date de 670 pour l'arrivée d'Oqba et la fondation de Kairouan n'apparaît que dans une minorité de sources, qui sont, en outre, tardives (Ibn al-Athîr, Al-Nowaïri et Ibn Idhari). Contre cette tradition, Ibn Khaldoun et ‘Ubayd Allâh le font arriver en 662-663, Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam en 666-667, Abû-l-‘Arab en 675-676 et Al-Mâlikî en 676-677.\nKairouan est fondée sur la ligne de confrontation entre Byzantins et musulmans dans le but d'en faire un point d'appui dans leur campagne de conquête de l'Afrique du Nord. L'emplacement choisi pour sa fondation, à l'intérieur des terres, semble particulièrement inhospitalier mais se situe suffisamment loin de la côte pour éviter les assauts de la flotte byzantine contrôlant alors la mer Méditerranée. Il fait aussi face aux montagnes qui sont le refuge des Berbères. Le qayrawān, ou camp de garnison, a donné son nom au site, puis par la suite à la ville. Kairouan possède alors une double fonction militaire et religieuse, assurant à la fois la guerre sainte et la défense des terres nouvellement conquises.\nLa ville est ainsi la première ville arabe d'Afrique du Nord. Capitale de l'Ifriqiya pendant cinq siècles, elle a été un lieu de diffusion exceptionnel de la civilisation arabo-musulmane.\n\nHistoire générale\nÀ la suite des combats qui opposent Berbères et Arabes, lors de la conquête arabe, Oqba Ibn Nafi est tué par le chef berbère Koceïla, qui s'empare de la ville de Kairouan de 682 à 684. Il rebaptise la ville en berbérisant son nom en Taqirwant.\nPlusieurs années après, une armée arabe conduite par Zuhayr ibn Kays défait l'armée de Koceïla à Mammès et reprend Kairouan entre 687 et 689.\nOqba Ibn Nafi édifie à Kairouan la grande mosquée de Kairouan. La légende rapporte, que sur l'emplacement de la future Kairouan, un soldat de Oqba aurait trébuché sur une coupe en or enterrée dans le sable. Cette coupe aurait été reconnue comme ayant disparu de La Mecque quelques années plus tôt, et lorsqu'on la déterra, une source d'eau aurait jailli, donnant une eau qui serait venue de la même source que celle sacrée de Zamzam à La Mecque. Cette histoire a fait de Kairouan un lieu de pèlerinage, et elle est souvent désignée comme la quatrième ville sainte (ou sacrée) de l'islam et la première ville sainte du Maghreb.\nVers 775, Abou Qurra assiège Kairouan et y répand durant un temps le kharidjisme sufrite. Devenue la capitale des Aghlabides, la cité prospère rapidement au cours du IXe siècle et devient le siège principal du pouvoir en Ifriqiya et un grand centre de rayonnement de la culture arabe et de l'islam, rivalisant avec les autres centres du bassin méditerranéen. C'est une grande ville de commerce et de science renommée pour son école de droit malikite et son école de médecine formée par Ishaq Ibn Imran. Kairouan joue également un rôle significatif dans l'arabisation des Berbères et des populations de langue latine de l'Ifriqiya.\nEn 909, les Fatimides, chiites ismaïliens menés par Abu Abd Allah ach-Chi'i, s'emparent de l'Ifriqiya et font de Kairouan leur résidence. Mais la ville perd son statut avec la fondation de Mahdia sur la côte orientale et sa proclamation comme capitale du califat fatimide. Mais les tensions ethnico-religieuses avec la population strictement sunnite de la ville obligent les Fatimides à abandonner le point d'appui qu'ils s'étaient constitué pour rejoindre l'Égypte vers 972-973 où il fonderont Le Caire, le nouveau centre du califat. Entretemps intervient la prise de Kairouan par l'ibadite Abu Yazid qui parvient ainsi, avec l'aide de la population sunnite de la ville, à interrompre brièvement l'hégémonie des Fatimides entre 944 et 946.\n\nAu milieu du Xe siècle, Kairouan dépasse les 100 000 habitants. Son approvisionnement en eau est assuré par un réseau de canalisations provenant des montagnes environnantes et un grand nombre de citernes réparties dans la ville et en dessous de la mosquée. Les grands réservoirs datant de l'époque aghlabide sont encore visibles de nos jours.\n\nAprès le retrait définitif des Fatimides, c'est une dynastie vassale de ces derniers, les Zirides, qui prend le pouvoir en Ifriqiya. Al-Muizz ben Badis (1016–1062), son plus illustre représentant, mène une politique en faveur de la population sunnite. La ville connaît alors la dernière période d'épanouissement de son histoire.\nEn effet, en 1054, les Fatimides du Caire organisent une expédition punitive contre les Zirides devenus dissidents : les tribus bédouines des Hilaliens et des Banu Sulaym foncent sur la ville, la détruisant presque entièrement.\nEn 1057, Al-Muizz ben Badis s'enfuit à Mahdia et livre Kairouan et ses environs au pillage. Avec l'essor des villes côtières sous le règne des Hafsides, et principalement de Tunis, Kairouan décline inéluctablement. En 1702, Hussein Ier Bey en restaure l'enceinte et de nombreuses mosquées. \nAu cours de l'offensive française menée pour prendre le contrôle du pays, les troupes commandées par le général Étienne prennent Kairouan le 26 octobre 1881.\nL'occupation de la ville paralyse la résistance et accélère la soumission de la Tunisie. Pendant le protectorat français, la ville devient tout de même l'un des foyers de la résistance nationaliste.\nEn 2009, elle est proclamée capitale de la culture islamique par l'Organisation du monde islamique pour l'éducation, les sciences et la culture.\n\nArchitecture et urbanisme\nDepuis le 9 décembre 1988, la médina de Kairouan est inscrite sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco en répondant à cinq des six critères d'évaluation ; à noter que pour être classé au patrimoine mondial, il suffit qu'un site réponde à un seul des six critères et parmi les sites classés à travers le monde, rares sont ceux, à l'image de Kairouan, ayant répondu à cinq critères. D'une part, la Grande Mosquée est l'un des monuments majeurs de l'islam et un chef-d'œuvre de l'architecture universelle. Elle a servi de modèle à plusieurs mosquées maghrébines en particulier pour ce qui concerne les motifs décoratifs. D'autre part, la mosquée des Trois Portes, construite en 866, est la plus ancienne des mosquées à façade sculptée de l'islam. Kairouan offre également un témoignage exceptionnel sur la civilisation des premiers siècles de l'hégire en Ifriqiya et son architecture islamique traditionnelle, associée à sa configuration spatiale, est devenue vulnérable sous l'effet des mutations économiques et constitue un patrimoine précieux. Kairouan est enfin l'une des villes saintes et des capitales spirituelles de l'islam.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nPlus ancien lieu de pèlerinage du pays et du Maghreb, Kairouan continue d'attirer les fidèles dans ses sanctuaires tels que la grande mosquée, fondée en 670 et datant principalement du IXe siècle, et la mosquée du Barbier bâtie en grande partie au XVIIe siècle.\n\nGrande mosquée de Kairouan\nLa grande mosquée de Kairouan, aussi appelée mosquée Sidi Oqba, reste aujourd'hui encore l'emblème de la ville et constitue le plus ancien et le plus prestigieux monument islamique de Tunisie et du Maghreb. Cette mosquée est également considérée comme l'une des plus belles et des plus harmonieuses réalisations architecturales de l'Islam.\nElle est fondée vers 670 par le conquérant de l'Afrique du Nord, Oqba Ibn Nafi (communément appelé Sidi Oqba à Kairouan), à proximité du campement de ses armées. Elle est agrandie à plusieurs reprises par les dynasties qui vont se succéder en Tunisie. Sous le règne des Aghlabides, c'est surtout à Ziadet Allah Ier (817–838) et Aboul Ibrahim (856–863) que l'on doit les extensions de la mosquée, le plus illustre historien et prédicateur local de son époque, rapporte que c'est sous le règne d'Aboul Ibrahim que le mihrab a pris sa forme définitive. C'est également à Aboul Ibrahim qu'est attribuée l'extension de la salle de prière pour offrir une nef plus large supportant une nouvelle coupole dans l'axe de la cour intérieure. En 1294, les Hafsides entreprennent une importante rénovation de l'édifice sacré, les portails étant réétayés et les galeries pourvues de nouveaux arcs. En dépit de multiples mesures modificatives, le cœur ancien de la Grande Mosquée est resté aujourd'hui dans sa forme originelle datant de l'époque des Aghlabides (au cours du IXe siècle).\n\nDans sa forme définitive, la mosquée s'étend sur 125 mètres de long et 73 mètres de large, couvrant une superficie totale de 9 000 m2. Elle appartient au type architectural de la mosquée de cour. La salle de prière supporte deux coupoles côtelées dont l'une est disposée au-dessus du mihrab aménagé au milieu du mur de la qibla, partie la plus ancienne, tandis que l'autre coupole a été construite lors de l'extension de la mosquée, au-dessus d'une galerie à arcs outrepassés axée sur la grande cour intérieure. La salle de prière se compose de 17 nefs dans le sens de la longueur, sept travées et un transept. La nef centrale mène au mihrab, niche de forme semi-cylindrique, soigneusement ornée de céramiques et de marbre sculpté, dont l'état actuel date du début de la seconde moitié du IXe siècle.\nJuste à côté s'élève le minbar original à onze marches. Ses parois latérales ont été montées en caissons très ouvragés en bois de teck importé d'Inde. Ce minbar, réalisé vers l'an 862, est considéré comme la plus ancienne chaire du monde musulman. Au centre de la niche de prière, habillée de panneaux de marbre, on peut lire la sourate 112 du Coran, rédigée en calligraphie kufi, avec l'invocation jointe du prophète, eulogie sur le modèle exact de l'inscription intérieure au Dôme du Rocher de Jérusalem. À proximité du minbar, le souverain ziride Al-Muizz ben Badis édifie la maqsura, le siège de l'imam disposant d'un accès particulier au mur de la qibla, que l'on nomme Bab El Imam. Le bâti décoratif en bois avec sa dédicace de fondation constitue l'un des plus beaux témoignages de l'art musulman.\n\nSelon une inscription ultérieure, la maqsura a été restaurée en 1624. La détermination de la direction pour la prière remonte au VIIe siècle et s'écarte de 31° par rapport à l'orientation exacte ; la qibla n'a pas été modifiée lors de l'ornementation en marbre de la niche d'origine par les Aghlabides. Le minaret, massif et agrandi à deux reprises, atteint désormais trois étages, dont le dernier est coiffé d'une coupole côtelée, et se dresse face à la salle de prière, au milieu du portique nord de la cour. Sa forme tire son origine d'une tour de défense dotée de postes de tir. À l'origine, la mosquée n'avait aucun minaret et son édification remonte au temps du calife omeyyade Hicham ben Abd al-Malik (724-743). Il est de ce fait antérieur d'une centaine d'années à l'aménagement de la salle de prière qui lui fait face et qui date de Ziadet Allah Ier. Datant du VIIIe – IXe siècle, ce minaret est le plus ancien au monde qui soit toujours debout.\nUne partie des matériaux de construction, essentiellement les colonnes et les chapiteaux en divers marbres de la salle de prière ainsi que les colonnes soutenant les arcades des galeries entourant la cour, proviennent de sites antiques romains et byzantins de la Tunisie, notamment Sbeïtla et Carthage.\n\nMosquée des Trois Portes\nLa mosquée des Trois Portes, située dans la vieille ville, entre le marché aux laines et le rempart sud, était appelée à l'origine Mosquée de Mohammed ibn Khairun par les historiens locaux et les récits de voyageurs. Dans son Histoire du Maghreb, l'historien andalou Ibn Idhari rapporte à propos de la fondation de la mosquée au XIVe siècle qu'« en l'an 252 de l'hégire [correspondant à l'année 866], Mohammed ibn Khairūn al-Andalusī al-Ma'āfirī édifia à Qairawān la mosquée qu'il qualifiait de vénérable, bâtie de briques cuites, de plâtre et de marbre et y fit aménager des citernes ».\n\nElle doit à sa façade décorative d'être considérée comme l'un des plus beaux spécimens de l'architecture islamique. La façade, haute d'environ 7 mètres, est ornée de trois inscriptions dont la première est une citation des versets 70-71 de la sourate 33 du Coran : « Au nom d'Allah, le Tout Miséricordieux, le Très Miséricordieux. Ô vous qui croyez ! Craignez Allah et parlez avec droiture afin qu'il améliore vos actions et vous pardonne vos péchés. Quiconque obéit à Allah et à Son messager obtient certes une grande réussite. »\nL'extrait figure également sur la corniche intermédiaire dans l'extension de la Grande Mosquée de Cordoue réalisée par Al-Hakam II qui gouverne le califat de Cordoue de 962 à 966. On peut penser que la reprise de ce verset provient d'un modèle inspiré par la façade de la mosquée des Trois Portes.\n\nSur la seconde frise calligraphiée se trouve l'inscription relative à la fondation : « Au nom de Dieu le miséricordieux et le bienveillant. À Dieu seul appartient la décision. Ainsi en a-t-il été et sera de toute éternité. Muhammed bin Khairūn al-Ma'āfirī al-Andalusī a décidé la construction de cette mosquée, pour obtenir la faveur divine et dans l'espoir de Son pardon et de Sa miséricorde, en l'an 252 ». La fondation d'une mosquée est en effet considérée dans l'islam comme une œuvre particulièrement méritoire. Dans les six principaux recueils de hadîths, on rapporte que le prophète Mahomet a dit que « celui qui construit une mosquée, Dieu lui bâtit une maison au Paradis.\n\nLa troisième inscription renseigne quant à elle sur la rénovation de la mosquée : « Loué soit Dieu pour ses bienfaits. Puisse Dieu bénir notre maître Mohammed. Le bâtiment de cette mosquée bénie a été rénové en l'an 844 [correspondant aux années 1440–1441]. Nous louons Dieu et nous prions pour notre maître Mohammed et sa famille. »\nÀ l'origine, la mosquée n'avait pas de minaret. Il est vraisemblable que, lors des travaux de restauration sous le règne des Hafsides, un petit minaret de style contemporain a été adjoint à côté de l'arcade orientale de la façade, abîmant du même coup les derniers caractères des deux premières inscriptions. De la salle de prière, on accède au minaret par un escalier étroit qui rompt la symétrie de l'espace intérieur. Il est partagé en trois niveaux, avec des ouvertures pour la lumière et sa hauteur totale n'excède pas 11,5 mètres.\n\nLa salle de prière, en trois nefs parallèles au mur de la qibla, à laquelle on accède par trois portes conjointes, ne mesure que 9 mètres sur 8,60 mètres, le plafond étant porté par quatre piliers en marbre coiffés de chapiteaux antiques. L'arche du mihrab est formée d'un arc outrepassé d'une hauteur de 2,60 mètres dans son axe. La citerne, une margelle avec des rainures pour la corde et un emplacement évidé pour la cruche, se trouve à côté de la niche à prière et se voit flanquée de deux colonnes. La citerne est pourvue en eau par les pluies collectées depuis le toit de la mosquée. La mosquée n'a ni minbar, ni cour. On admet toutefois qu'un musalla était adjointe à la façade richement ornée, comme cela est le cas dans la petite mosquée Bu Ftata de Sousse.\nAvec son ornementation ancienne, qui remonte au temps des Aghlabides et ses inscriptions originelles, la façade tient une place particulière dans l'architecture islamique. Il est vraisemblable que tout le site a été édifié à des fins privées. On ne sait rien de Muhammad ibn Khairūn al-Ma'āfirī al-Andalusī, fondateur de la mosquée. Il était probablement un commerçant venu à Kairouan depuis l'Espagne musulmane à l'époque aghlabide ; les pierres tombales de plusieurs membres de sa famille ont d'ailleurs été retrouvées. Les historiens locaux d'Afrique du Nord citent également parmi les « martyrs de la foi » le fils du fondateur, l'éminent juriste (faqîh) Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Khairūn, qui s'est fait une renommée à Kairouan en diffusant l'enseignement des zahirites. En 914, sous l'autorité des Fatimides, il est piétiné à mort par des esclaves noirs, sur ordre du préfet fatimide de la ville, en raison de son opposition au chiisme. Son tombeau est connu.\n\nMosquée du Barbier\nLe mausolée de Sidi Sahbi, généralement appelé mosquée du Barbier, est en fait une zaouïa qui se trouve hors les murailles de la médina. Il s'agit d'un vaste ensemble architectural construit en grande partie au cours du XVIIe siècle. C'est le bey mouradite Hammouda Pacha Bey qui fait construire le mausolée, la coupole et la cour alors que le bey Mohamed El Mouradi fait ajouter les bâtiments annexes, le minaret et la médersa constituée d'un oratoire, d'une salle d'ablution et de chambres destinées aux étudiants.\nLa population y vénère un saint local de Kairouan, un certain Abou Zamaa el-Balaoui, un compagnon du prophète Mahomet. Selon la légende, il aurait conservé trois poils de la barbe du prophète, d'où l'appellation donnée à l'édifice. Dans l'histoire de la ville de Kairouan, ce compagnon du prophète est à relier à une parole attribuée à ce dernier, si l'on en croit notamment Al-Tirmidhî.\nLe prophète aurait prédit que « chacun de mes compagnons qui meurt dans un pays, deviendra au jour de la résurrection le guide et la lumière envoyés par Dieu pour les gens de ce pays ». Dès le Xe siècle, les chroniqueurs locaux rapportent que des habitants de la ville auraient découvert là un tombeau contenant un corps intact. L'endroit est donc à considérer comme le pur produit d'une croyance islamique populaire.\nOn parvient à la sépulture par une grande cour intérieure et un couloir aux parois couvertes de carreaux de céramique richement ouvragés à la mode turque et de panneaux de stuc.\nC'est seulement au XVIIe siècle que l'on a fait édifier une coupole au-dessus du tombeau et que l'on a adjoint à la cour intérieure une petite médersa et des locaux pour accueillir les visiteurs du tombeau. Ces ailes ont été rénovées au début des années 1990 et sont aujourd'hui accessibles au public.\n\nRemparts et portes\nLa médina de Kairouan est entourée par des remparts dont les premiers sont élevés en 762 (six portes) sous le règne du calife abbasside Al-Mansur. À la suite des invasions hilaliennes survenues vers 1057, la taille de la cité ainsi que l'étendue de ses remparts se réduisent considérablement.\nLes murailles actuelles remontent aux travaux ordonnés par les souverains husseinites et sont réalisés entre 1706 et 1772.\n\nAutres édifices\nDans le cœur ancien de Kairouan se trouvent plusieurs mosquées, parfois sans minaret, utilisées à l'époque comme lieux de prière par les habitants du quartier. La plus ancienne est vraisemblablement la mosquée d'Ansar qui, si l'on en croit la chronique locale, aurait été fondée par le compagnon du prophète Ruwaifi ibn Thabit al-Ansari en 667. Ceci relève plus de la légende car la fondation de cette petite mosquée de cour, avec salle de prière ouverte et mihrab archaïque, n'a pu être établie par des fouilles archéologiques à ce jour. De plus, le site a été rénové en 1650. L'historien local Al-Dabbagh, mort en 1296, rapporte que la mosquée était très populaire chez les musulmans qui recherchaient une bénédiction : des empreintes de mains terreuses sur le mur blanc extérieur attestent cette pratique cultuelle très courante dans l'islam populaire, y compris jusqu'à aujourd'hui. D'autres mosquées datant de l'époque beylicale se trouvent également dans la médina comme la mosquée Al Malek (XVIIIe siècle) ou la mosquée Al Bey dont la construction remonte à la fin du XVIIe siècle.\nSous le mur nord-ouest de la ville, derrière l'imposant minaret de la Grande Mosquée, s'étend le cimetière de la tribu tunisienne peu connue des Awlad Farhan dont la particularité réside dans l'aménagement particulier de leurs tombes, insolite dans un cimetière musulman. Certaines, rangées par paires et entourées d'un muret, sont la dernière demeure des saints patrons de la tribu. Au bout de la pierre tombale, on a ajouté le nom d'Allah en terre glaise.\nLes membres de la tribu vivent aujourd'hui un peu partout en Tunisie mais continuent d'enterrer leurs défunts dans ce cimetière placé sous les murs de la ville. À l'anniversaire de leur mort, et à l'occasion de certains jours de fête, des bougies sont allumées dans une petite niche aménagée dans les pierres tombales.\nParmi les autres monuments importants de Kairouan figurent :\n\nLe mausolée Sidi Abid el Ghariani, ancienne zaouïa élevée durant la seconde moitié du XIVe siècle puis agrandie et embellie au XVIIe siècle. Le monument se distingue par sa décoration raffinée mêlant céramiques, plâtre finement ciselé et plafonds en bois peint et sculpté ;\nLe mausolée Sidi Amor Abbada, construit vers 1872, est un édifice abritant le tombeau d'un célèbre marabout du XIXe siècle. Le bâtiment est remarquable à l'extérieur grâce à un ensemble de six coupoles côtelées ;\nLes remparts de Kairouan, enceinte fortifiée de la médina à l'origine très ancienne (bâtie dès le VIIIe siècle) mais dont l'état actuel date essentiellement du XVIIIe siècle.\n\nBassins des Aghlabides\nLe calife omeyade Hicham ben Abd al-Malik donne l'ordre au gouverneur de Kairouan, Obeid Allah Ibn El Habhab, de construire quinze bassins pour alimenter la ville en eau. Mais les bassins des Aghlabides, le plus célèbre des quinze bassins, est édifié par le souverain aghlabide Aboul Ibrahim (règne de 856 à 863) entre 860 et 862 : c'est un réservoir constitué de deux citernes circulaires découvertes et communiquant entre elles.\nLe grand bassin est un polygone de 64 côtés mesurant 129,67 mètres de diamètre intérieur et d'une capacité de 57 764 m3. Il sert parfois comme bassin de plaisance et de divertissement notamment sous Ziadet Allah III (règne de 903 à 909). Le petit bassin est un polygone simple de 17 côtés faisant 37,40 mètres de diamètre intérieur et d'une capacité de 4 119 m3.\nLes eaux de débordement de l'oued Merguellil étaient recueillies dans le plus petit bassin où elles décantaient avant de transiter par le grand bassin pour alimenter en partie la ville.\n\nCulture\nPatrimoine écrit\nEn 1882, les orientalistes français Octave Houdas et René Basset évoquent dans leur rapport sur leur Mission scientifique en Tunisie, paru dans le Bulletin de correspondance africaine, une collection de manuscrits qu'ils auraient vue à la grande mosquée de Kairouan, dans une pièce fermée à proximité du mihrab. En 1897, un employé ministériel tunisien, Muhammad Bek Bayram, présente devant la Société géographique d'Égypte un rapport sur sa mission à Kairouan où il donne des précisions sur cette collection de manuscrits qui, d'après ses informations, aurait été entreposée dans la maqsura aménagée par Al-Muizz ben Badis dans la mosquée.\nC'est seulement en 1956 que l'inventaire effectué en 1293-1294 est publié par le chercheur tunisien \nIbrahim Chabbouh dans la Revue de l'Institut des manuscrits arabes publiée au Caire. Ce relevé ne correspond toutefois plus à l'état effectif du dépôt actuel. L'orientaliste allemand Joseph Schacht, qui avait examiné sur place quelques manuscrits de cette collection non inventoriée en 1953 et 1964, publie en 1967 dans la revue de sciences islamiques Arabica un premier index scientifique des plus importants documents de cette bibliothèque. Ce n'est qu'au milieu des années 1980 que l'on commence à trier le dépôt actuel de manuscrits (essentiellement sur parchemins) par genres, auteurs et titres.\nLe ministère des Affaires étrangères tunisien a procuré des locaux pour la conservation des manuscrits, des laboratoires photographiques et de restauration des documents dans l'ancienne résidence estivale du président Habib Bourguiba située à Raqqada, à douze kilomètres de Kairouan. On y trouve également le Centre d'études de la civilisation et des arts islamiques auquel est adjoint le petit musée national d'art islamique qui expose des pièces datant des Aghlabides et des Zirides.\n\nLa grande majorité des manuscrits se rapporte au droit musulman et constitue le plus ancien fonds documentaire au monde sur la littérature juridique malikite du IXe siècle. Quelques-uns ont été rédigés dans la période fondatrice du malikisme, entre la rédaction du Al-Muwatta de Mâlik ibn Anas et du Al Mudawwana de l'imam Sahnoun en 854. Les études biographiques et bibliographiques de l'orientaliste Miklós Murányi (de) publiées en 1997 représentent l'état actuel de la recherche sur le monde érudit de Kairouan. En outre, la bibliothèque possède l'une des plus riches collections d'anciens codex coraniques, dont des fragments du Coran bleu, rédigée selon une graphie archaïque sans points diacritiques, remontant à la fin du IXe siècle et au début du Xe siècle.\nDès l'inventaire de 1293-1294, on recensait plusieurs exemplaires du Coran bleu ; quelques pièces se trouvent également de nos jours dans des collections privées. Certes, l'origine de ces codex reste encore obscure mais il est maintenant admis que les feuilles de parchemin bleu et leur enluminure en or ont été réalisées à Kairouan. Un document en hébreu, le Guéniza du Caire, remontant au Xe siècle et par conséquent contemporain de la naissance du Coran bleu, fait état de l'exportation d'indigo égyptien vers la Tunisie. Ce produit était la matière première employée pour teinter les peaux lors de la fabrication du parchemin. Cela dit, on ne sait rien du commanditaire à l'origine de cette œuvre.\nLa page du Coran bleu représentée ici commence par le verset 1 de la sourate 35 et finit sur la ligne 14 avec le début de son verset 4 (incomplet). Ce qui est caractéristique dans ce codex, c'est la coupure des mots — inhabituelle en arabe — à la fin de la ligne 3 (ر - سلا) et à la fin de la ligne 10 (اذ - كروا). Il est à souligner qu'au milieu de la troisième ligne, le copiste a écrit un verbe (جعل) et non comme dans la version imprimée le participe passé idoine de ce verbe (جاعل) ; cela n'est d'ailleurs pas rare dans le calligraphie kufi où l'on ne marque pas la longueur des voyelles. Toutefois la variante à cet endroit autorise une autre interprétation que celle du verset tel qu'on le lit dans la version imprimée.\n\nArtisanat\nAux premiers siècles de l'ère islamique, l'émirat aghlabite de Kairouan (800-909) payait partiellement le tribut de souveraineté au calife de Bagdad en tapis. Le « tapis de Kairouan » voit sa fabrication commencer réellement au XIXe siècle et la ville reste le principal centre de fabrication du pays. Au début du XXe siècle, la qualité du tapis se dégrade en raison du mauvais usage des teintures artificielles, ce qui conduit une famille kairouanaise à produire le alloucha, un nouveau type de tapis noué à la main qui reprend les couleurs de la laine de mouton et dont un champ hexagonal occupe le centre au moyen d'un motif en forme de losange. Peu à peu, le alloucha évolue vers plus de complexité et de polychromie, la texture augmente et les influences perses se font sentir avec l'apparition du zarbia reconnaissable à sa couleur brun-rouge.\nLe tapis de Kairouan est un tapis de points noués non tissé fabriqué à base de laine ou de coton — notamment pour la trame et la chaîne — et plus rarement de lin. Il peut être coloré dans les teintes naturelles du blanc au marron en passant par le gris beige lorsqu'il est de type alloucha. La laine est toujours épaisse, car c'est celle du mouton, mais le poil du dromadaire ou de la chèvre peut être utilisé. Les motifs sont géométriques mais peuvent aussi être des fleurs stylisées, donnant à l'ensemble un aspect symétrique avec prédominance de la forme du losange.\n\nGastronomie\nLe makroud est une pâtisserie maghrébine introduite à Kairouan et en Tunisie par la dynastie des Aghlabides. Il est composé de semoule fourrée d'une pâte de dattes et trempée dans du miel ou du sirop de sucre.\n\nPolitique\nLa liste ci-dessous présente les maires de Kairouan depuis l'indépendance de la Tunisie :\n\nÉconomie\nTransport\nSport\nLa ville possède sa propre association sportive, la Jeunesse sportive kairouanaise qui regroupe plusieurs sections dont l'une de football qui est connue en Tunisie pour être un vivier de jeunes joueurs tels qu'Amine Chermiti et Zouhaier Dhaouadi. L'équipe évolue au stade Hamda-Laouani.\n\nJumelages\nLa municipalité de Kairouan a signé de nombreux accords de coopération et de jumelage avec diverses villes à travers le monde :\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nFrançais\nMokhtar Boukhris, Kairouan, l'autre mémoire, Tunis, Sahar, 2008.\nNoureddine Harrazi, Chapiteaux de la grande mosquée de Kairouan, Tunis, Institut national d'archéologie et d'art, 1982.\nMohamed Kerrou, Kairouan, phare éternel de l'islam, Tunis, Apollonia, 2009.\nGeorges Marçais, Tunis et Kairouan, Tunis, Henri Laurens, 1937.\nBernard Roy et Paule Poinssot, Inscriptions arabes de Kairouan, Paris, Klincksieck (no 3), 1950.\nHenri Saladin, Tunis et Kairouan : voyages à travers l'architecture, l'artisanat et les mœurs du début du XXe siècle, Paris, Henri Laurens, coll. « Les Villes d'art célèbres », 1908 (réimpr. 2002).\nÉlise Voguet, « L'inventaire des manuscrits de la bibliothèque de la grande mosquée de Kairouan (693/1293-4) », Arabica, vol. 50,‎ 2003, p. 532-544.\n\nAutres langues\n(de) Gisela Kircher, Die Moschee des Muhammad b.

      "content": "## Overview\nKairouan (Arabic: القيروان), sometimes spelled Kairwan, Kayrawan or Al Qayrawan, is a city in Tunisia. It's a holy city in Islam, ranking fourth after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage. Reputedly seven visits here are the equivalent of one to Mecca. With its large mosques and rich cultural history it has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Get in\nBuses run to Kairouan from the major cities, Tunis, Sousse (2 hrs), and Sfax. Touts from the carpets shops have been known to board the bus a few kilometres outside the city and befriend tourists to lure them into their shops.\nLouages run from many destinations into Kairouan; these are probably the best and most frequent way to get into the city. It takes 2 hours and 10.25 DT from Tunis (as of 2016). There is no direct public transport between Kairouan and El Jem, you'd need to change in Sousse.\nKairouan is not located on a train line.\nThe stations for both buses and louages are to the northwest of the Medina. Though they may well drop you off at a Medina Gate if requested.\n\n## Get around\nThe Medina is best explored on foot, partially to absorb the atmosphere and partially because some areas are inaccessible to anything bigger. The main street that links the Gate of Martyrs (south) to the Gate of Tunis (northwest) is rather touristic.\nMany of the shops near the main mosque will tempt you in with views over the complex, expect to have a look around the shop on the way out, if you don't buy anything a small donation would be polite.\n\n## See\nThe old Medina with its narrow passageways and streets is in general a nice place to just wander around aimlessly. If it looks familiar it may well be as it was used in Raiders of the Lost Ark to double as Cairo. For those interested in Islamic teachings there are several madrasas, or Islamic schools, in the centre of town that are open for visitors. Three communities coexist here: the Bedouins, the Berbers, the Arabs. You can tell the houses apart by the doors: ring doorknockers, the hands of fatimas, or just Arabic script. The number of rings or hands denote also the number of families in the same house. Green doors are mosques.\n35.68138910.1038891 Great Mosque of Kairouan (جامع القيروان الأكبر). One of the finest Islamic buildings in North Africa and rewards closer inspection. Non Muslims are not permitted into the prayer hall, but the doors are open to allow you to view inside. Access to the main courtyard is available to all. The columns throughout the complex were taken from Carthage, the wooden ceiling from Lebanese cedar wood. In the courtyard, there are indents into the floor with varying sizes for camel or dromedary hoofs, or human feet, for washing before prayers. On the tiny platform in the middle of the courtyard, there is also four black pins on a board that tells the prayer times by the sun. Facing the prayer room, on one of the left columns is also a last black pin marking the night prayer by moonlight. Multi-site ticket costs 10 DT, covering 6 sites in Kairouan. And also 1dn for photo taking rights.\n35.67702210.1028522 Mosque of the Three Doors (مسجد ابن خيرون). With one of the finest façades in Tunisia, though the interior is not open.\n35.67600910.100763 Bi'r Barouta. This well is the place where the city was founded, it is reputedly linked to the ZamZam well in Mecca, it is one of the holiest sites in the city for Muslims. A camel drives the well pump. There is also a small cafe inside the complex serving coffee and tea. Free.\n35.67555610.1022224 Maison de Gouveneur. The medina house of a local governor in the past, this house with 18 rooms belonged to him and his 4 wives and 21 children. Extremely beautiful and intricate interior, on the outside unassuming and signposted as 'Tapis-Sabra'. Today a carpet shop, it is covered all over with carpets of all shapes and sizes. Women work on the looms, you can watch and take photos, while an old man gives you a tour and at the end, you're expected to view the carpets (70 DT for a small one).\n35.68657910.0955845 Aghlabid Basins (Upon leaving the Gate of Tunis, head along the road to the right till you hit the basins. About a 20-minute walk. It's opposite Hotel Continental.). These cisterns, built by the Aghlabids in the 9th century are more impressive because of their engineering sophistication than as sights in themselves. Water was delivered by aqueduct from the hills 36 km west of Kairouan into the smaller settling basin and then into the enormous main holding basin, which was 5 m deep and 128 m in diameter. In the centre of the main pool was a pavilion where the rulers could come to relax on summer evenings. Most visitors do nothing more than peek at the cisterns from the rooftop of the syndicat d'initiative office nearby, but you can enter with the multiple-site ticket. When the office isn't open, the site seems to be open to everyone anyway.\n35.67508510.1015756 Zaouia of Sidi Abid el-Ghariani. This mausoleum was also a Koranic school. Mosaics of the blue mosque in Istanbul, cedar wood ceiling.\nMosque of Ansar. Traditionally dating to 667, but totally renewed in 1650. (updated Nov 2018)\nMosque Al Bey. Late 17th century. (updated Nov 2018)\n35.67697810.0949477 Sidi Amor Abada Museum. Sep 16–Jun 16: 09:00-16:00; Jun 17-Sep 30: 08:00-14:00. The museum was established in a zawiya – mausoleum – built in 1872 and containing the tomb of Amor Abada, better known as Sidi Abada. 10 DT.     (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Further afield\n35.59624310.05698 Raqqada National Museum of Islamic art (رقّادة). Raqqāda is the site of the second capital of the 9th-century dynasty of Aghlabids, located about ten kilometers southwest of Kairouan. The site now houses the National Museum of Islamic Art. Which specializes in medieval Islamic art and includes works from Kairouan, Raqqada and Al-Mansuriya, a former princely city built in the Fatimid period.   (updated Nov 2018)\n\n## Do\nSit and enjoy a tea in a traditional tea house if the heat gets a little too much.\nWalk the town and appreciate the beautiful and intricate designs.\n\n## Buy\nKairouan is particularly famous for its carpets and visiting a shop is an integral and sometimes unexpected part of experiencing the city. Carpets are graded by their fineness, the number of knots in a square metre, with a normal weave from 10,000 to 40,000, fine weave from 65,000-90,000 and extra fine from 160,000 - 500,000. Silk carpets may be over 500,000 knots per square metre.\n\n## Eat\nA speciality of Kairouan is the sticky pastry makrouhd, it can be found all through Tunisia - dates, sesame, and honey. You can tell most shops how much you're willing to spend, and they'll give you a box of pastries. You can mix and match with others!\n\n## Drink\nThere are a few nice tea houses on the road from the Main Gate into the centre of the city\n\n## Sleep\nMany tiny hotels dotted all around town, without much online presence.\n\n## Budget\nHotel Tunisia, Av. de la Republique, ☏ +216 77 231 855.\n\n## Mid-range\n35.69232410.1036231 Hôtel Amina, Route de Tunis GP 2, ☏ +216 77 226 555.\n35.68589410.0978932 Hotel Continental, ☏ +216 77 231 135.
