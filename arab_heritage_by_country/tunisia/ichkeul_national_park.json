Among the lake's visitors are ducks, geese, storks, and pink flamingoes. Dam construction on the lake's feeder rivers has produced major changes to the ecological balance of the lake and wetlands.\n\nHistory\nIn the reign of the Hafsid dynasty, Lake Ichkuel was a reserve during the 13th century. It later became the property of the public domain in the early 20th century during French rule. Since 1980, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nBecause dams have sharply reduced the freshwater inflow to the lakes and marshes, the reedbeds, sedges, and other fresh-water plant species have been replaced with salt-loving plants. These changes have produced a sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations, which depend on the mix of plants that used to exist.\nAccording to the UNESCO Website, the Tunisian government has undertaken some steps to retain freshwater and reduce salinity, and the lake was removed from UNESCO's list of World heritage in danger in 2006.\nHowever some reports from the World Conservation Union suggest that the salinity has already become excessively high and the possibility for rehabilitation may be rapidly disappearing.\n\nIchkeul National Park\nIchkeul National Park is a World Heritage Site located in the north of Tunisia, 25 km southwest of Bizerte and 15 km north of Mateur. The park has been on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1980, and between 1996 and 2006 the park has also been on the group's list of World Heritage in Danger. The park is managed by the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture.\nThe flowering plant Teucrium_schoenenbergeri Nabli found only in Tunisia was harvested in 1965 in the Park.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\nUNESCO website\nWCMC datasheet\nACST Photos: Exploring Lak Ichkeul\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Archived 2006-10-01 at the Wayback Machine",

      "content": "## Overview\nIchkeul National Park (French: Parc national d'Ichkeul) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Northern Tunisia, Tunisia, located in the commune of Tinja.\n\n## History\nThe park was a game reserve during the reign of the Hafsides dynasty in the 13th century and then became the property of the public domain in the early 20th century.\nThe park has been a biosphere reserve since 1977 and has been a world heritage site in Tunisia since 1980. Between 1996 and 2006 it was included among those in danger, in fact the site was threatened by the construction of dams on the rivers upstream. which increase the salinity of the water disturbing the ecosystem. Tunisian authorities have ended the agricultural use of the lake's waters, reducing salinity and allowing many bird species to return to the park removing the park from the World Heritage List in Danger.\n\n## Landscape\nThe park covers a rectangular area of 11.4 by 20 kilometres and rises around Lake Ichkeul, located near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe lake has the particularity of being fed by six wadis in fresh water during the winter and being connected to the Mediterranean Sea through the Bizerte lake (in the Tinja channel) during the summer, which significantly increases the salinity of the waters and is the last vestige of a chain of lakes that once stretched across North Africa.\n\n## Flora and fauna\nLake Ichkeul and the park's marshes are a major landing place for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds each year. Among the \"guests\" of the lake include ducks, geese, storks and pink flamingos.\nThe dams built on the tributaries have caused severe changes in the ecological balance of the lake and marshes. The dams have markedly reduced the flow of water into the lakes and other pools of fresh water, causing the patches of ciperaceae to give way to plants more accustomed to salt water. These changes have limited the influx of migratory birds due to the limited availability of plants.\n\n## Get in\nFrom Bizerte, take the RN 11, south-west towards Mateur. After crossing Tinja the road cuts the railway. The national park entrance is on the right, 50 metres further.\nFrom Tunis, take the RN 7 road to Mateur. Then turn right onto the RN 11 heading north towards Bizerte. The entrance to the national park is 50 metres before crossing the Mateur-Tinja railway.\n\n## See\n37.1629.6670641 Lake Ichkeul.
