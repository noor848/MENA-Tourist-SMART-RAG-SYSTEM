      "content": "The Great Mosque of Kairouan (Arabic: جامع القيروان الأكبر), also known as the Mosque of Uqba (جامع عقبة بن نافع), is a mosque situated in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Kairouan, Tunisia and is one of the largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. \nEstablished by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in 50 AH (670/671 CE) at the founding of the city of Kairouan, the mosque occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft).  It is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, and is a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb. Its perimeter, of about 405 metres (1,329 ft), contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.\nExtensive works under the Aghlabids two centuries later (9th Cent.AD/CE) gave the mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and expand. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role at the time can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. With the decline of the city from the mid-11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.\n\nLocation\nLocated in the north-east of the medina of Kairouan, the mosque is in the intramural district of Houmat al-Jami (literally \"area of the Great Mosque\"). This location corresponded originally to the heart of the urban fabric of the city founded by Uqba ibn Nafi. However, given the natural lay of the land crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city spread southwards. Human factors including Hilalian's invasions in 449 AH (1057 AD) led to the decline of the city and halted development. For all these reasons, the mosque which once occupied the center of the medina when first built in 670 is now on the easternmost quarter abutting the city walls.\n\nHistory\nEvolution\nAt the foundation of Kairouan in 670, the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi (himself the founder of the city) chose the site of his mosque in the center of the city, near the headquarters of the governor. Around 690, shortly after its construction, the mosque was destroyed during the occupation of Kairouan by the Berbers, originally conducted by Kusaila. It was rebuilt by the Ghassanid general Hasan ibn al-Nu'man in 703. With the gradual increase of the population of Kairouan and the consequent increase in the number of faithful, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, Umayyad Caliph in Damascus, charged his governor Bishr ibn Safwan to carry out development work in the city, which included the renovation and expansion of the mosque around the years 724–728. During this expansion, he pulled down the mosque and rebuilt it with the exception of the mihrab. It was under his auspices that the construction of the minaret began. In 774, a new reconstruction accompanied by modifications and embellishments took place under the direction of the Abbasid governor Yazid ibn Hatim.\nUnder the rule of the Aghlabid dynasty, Kairouan was at its apogee, and the mosque profited from this period of stability and prosperity. In 836, Emir Ziyadat Allah I reconstructed the mosque once more: this is when the building acquired, at least in its entirety, its current appearance. At the same time, the mihrab's ribbed dome  was raised on squinches. Around 862–863, Emir Abu Ibrahim enlarged the oratory, with three bays to the north, and added the cupola over the arched portico which precedes the prayer hall. In 875 Emir Ibrahim II built another three bays, thereby reducing the size of the courtyard which was further limited on the three other sides by the addition of double galleries.\nThe current state of the mosque can be traced back to the Aghlabid period—no element is earlier than the ninth century besides the mihrab—except for some partial restorations and a few later additions made in 1025 during the Zirid period, 1248 and 1293–1294 under the reign of the Hafsids, 1618 at the time of Muradid beys, and in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In 1967, major restoration works, executed during five years and conducted under the direction of the National Institute of Archeology and Art, were achieved throughout the monument, and were ended with an official reopening of the mosque during the celebration of the Mawlid of 1972.\n\nHost stories\nSeveral centuries after its founding, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the subject of numerous descriptions by Arab historians and geographers in the Middle Ages. The stories concern mainly the different phases of construction and expansion of the sanctuary, and the successive contributions of many princes to the interior decoration (mihrab, minbar, ceilings, etc.). Among the authors who have written on the subject and whose stories have survived are Al-Bakri (Andalusian geographer and historian who died in 1094 and who devoted a sufficiently detailed account of the history of the mosque in his book Description of Septentrional Africa), Al-Nuwayri (historian who died in Egypt, 1332) and Ibn Nagi (scholar and historian of Kairouan who died around 1435).\nOn additions and embellishments made to the building by the Aghlabid emir Abu Ibrahim, Ibn Nagi gives the following account: « He built in the mosque of Kairouan the cupola that rises over the entrance to the central nave, together with the two colonnades which flank it from both sides, and the galleries were paved by him. He then made the mihrab. »\nAmong the Western travelers, poets and writers who visited Kairouan, some of them leave impressions and testimonies sometimes tinged with emotion or admiration on the mosque. From the eighteenth century, the French doctor and naturalist John Andrew Peyssonnel, conducting a study trip to 1724, during the reign of sovereign Al-Husayn Bey I, underlines the reputation of the mosque as a deemed centre of religious and secular studies: « The Great Mosque is dedicated to Uqba, where there is a famous college where we will study the remotest corners of this kingdom : are taught reading and writing of Arabic grammar, laws and religion. There are large rents for the maintenance of teachers. » \nAt the same time, the doctor and Anglican priest Thomas Shaw (1692–1751), touring the Tunis Regency and passes through Kairouan in 1727, described the mosque as that: \"which is considered the most beautiful and the most sacred of Berberian territories\", evoking for example: \"an almost unbelievable number of granite columns\".\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, the French writer Guy de Maupassant expresses in his book La vie errante (The Wandering Life), his fascination with the majestic architecture of the Great Mosque of Kairouan as well as the effect created by countless columns: \"The unique harmony of this temple consists in the proportion and the number of these slender shafts upholding the building, filling, peopling, and making it what it is, create its grace and greatness. Their colorful multitude gives the eye the impression of unlimited\". Early in the twentieth century, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke describes his admiration for the minaret: « Is there a more beautiful than this still preserved old tower, the minaret, in Islamic architecture? In the history of Art, its three-storey minaret is considered such a masterpiece and a model among the most prestigious monuments of Muslim architecture. »\n\nArchitecture\nGeneral layout\nThe building is a vast slightly irregular quadrilateral covering some 9,000 m2. It is longer (127.60 metres) on the east side than the west (125.20 metres), and shorter on the north side (72.70 metres) than the south (78 metres). It consists mainly of an interior prayer hall to the south preceded by a large courtyard (sahn) to the north. The main minaret is centered on the north side of the courtyard.\n\nExterior\nEnclosure\nFrom the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building with its 1.90 metres thick massive ocher walls, a composite of well-worked stones with intervening courses of rubble stone and baked bricks. The corner towers measuring 4.25 metres on each side are buttressed with solid projecting supports. Structurally given the soft grounds subject to compaction, the buttressed towers added stability to the entire mosque. Despite the austere façades, the rhythmic patterns of buttresses and towering porches, some surmounted by cupolas, give the sanctuary a sense of striking sober grandeur.\nToday, the enclosure of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is pierced by nine gates (six opening on the courtyard, two opening on the prayer hall and a ninth allows access to the maqsura) some of them, such as Bab Al-Ma (gate of water) located on the western façade, are preceded by salient porches flanked by buttresses and surmounted by ribbed domes based on square tholobate which are porting squinches with three vaults. However, Arab geographers and historians of the Middle Ages Al-Muqaddasi and Al-Bakri reported the existence, around the tenth and eleventh centuries, of about ten gates named differently from today. This reflects the fact that, unlike the rest of the mosque, the enclosure has undergone significant changes to ensure the stability of the building (adding many buttresses). Thus, some entries have been sealed, while others were kept.\nDuring the thirteenth century, new gates were opened, the most remarkable, Bab Lalla Rihana dated from 1293, is located on the eastern wall of the enclosure. The monumental entrance, work of the Hafsid sovereign Abu Hafs `Umar ibn Yahya (reign from 1284 to 1295), is entered in a salient square, flanked by ancient columns supporting horseshoe arches and covered by a dome on squinches. The front façade of the porch has a large horseshoe arch relied on two marble columns and surmounted by a frieze adorned with a blind arcade, all crowned by serrated merlons (in a sawtooth arrangement). Despite its construction at the end of the thirteenth century, Bab Lalla Rihana blends well with all of the building mainly dating from the ninth century.\n\nCourtyard\nThe courtyard is a vast trapezoidal area whose interior dimensions are approximately 67 by 52 metres. It is surrounded on all its four sides by a portico with double rows of arches, opened by slightly horseshoe arches supported by columns in various marbles, in granite or in porphyry, reused from Roman, Early Christian or Byzantine monuments particularly from Carthage. Access to the courtyard by six side entrances dating from the ninth and thirteenth centuries.\nThe portico on the south side of the courtyard, near the prayer hall, includes in its middle a large dressed stone pointed horseshoe arch which rests on ancient columns of white veined marble with Corinthian capitals. This porch of seven metres high is topped with a square base upon which rests a semi-spherical ribbed dome; the latter is ribbed with sharp-edged ribs. The intermediary area, the dodecagonal drum of the dome, is pierced by sixteen small rectangular windows set into rounded niches. The great central arch of the south portico, is flanked on each side by six rhythmically arranged horseshoe arches, which fall on twin columns backed by pillars. Overall, the proportions and general layout of the façade of the south portico, with its thirteen arches of which that in the middle constitutes a sort of triumphal arch crowned with a cupola, form an ensemble with \"a powerful air of majesty\", according to the French historian and sociologist Paul Sebag (1919–2004).\n\nDetails of the courtyard\nThe combination formed by the courtyard and the galleries that surround it covers an immense area whose dimensions are about 90 metres long and 72 metres in width. The northern part of the courtyard is paved with flagstones while the rest of the floor is almost entirely composed of white marble slabs. Near its centre is an horizontal sundial, bearing an inscription in naskhi engraved on the marble dating from 1258 AH (which corresponds to the year 1843) and which is accessed by a little staircase; it determines the time of prayers. The rainwater collector or impluvium, probably the work of the Muradid Bey Mohamed Bey al-Mouradi (1686–1696), is an ingenious system that ensures the capture (with the slightly sloping surface of the courtyard) then filtering stormwater at a central basin furnished with horseshoe arches sculpted in white marble. Freed from its impurities, the water flows into an underground cistern supported by seven-metre-high pillars. In the courtyard there are also several water wells some of which are placed side by side. Their edges, obtained from the lower parts of ancient cored columns, support the string grooves back the buckets.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret, which occupies the centre of the northern façade of the complex's enclosure, is 31.5 metres tall and is seated on a square base of 10.7 metres on each side. It is located inside the enclosure and does not have direct access from the outside. It consists of three tapering levels, the last of which is topped with a small ribbed dome that was most probably built later than the rest of the tower. The first and second stories are surmounted by rounded merlons which are pierced by arrowslits. The minaret served as a watchtower, as well as to call the faithful to prayer.\nThe door giving access to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of recycled carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, and they have been reused at the base of the tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.\nThe interior includes a staircase of 129 steps, surmounted by a barrel vault, which gives access to the terraces and the first tier of the minaret. The courtyard façade (or south façade) of the tower is pierced with windows that provide light and ventilation, while the other three façades—facing north, east and west—are pierced with small openings in the form of arrowslits. The minaret, in its present aspect, dates largely from the early ninth century, about 836 AD. It is the oldest minaret in the Muslim world, and it is also the world's oldest minaret still standing.\nDue to its age and its architectural features, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the prototype for all the minarets of the western Islamic world: it served as a model in both North Africa and in Andalusia. Despite its massive form and austere decoration, it nevertheless presents a harmonious structure and a majestic appearance.\n\nDomes\nThe Mosque has several domes, the largest being over the mihrab and the entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard. The dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, eastern and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame. This dome, whose construction goes back to the first half of the ninth century (towards 836), is one of the oldest and most remarkable domes in the western Islamic world.\n\nInterior\nPrayer hall\nThe prayer hall is located on the southern side of the courtyard; and is accessed by 17 carved wooden doors. A portico with double row of arches precede the spacious prayer hall, which takes the shape of a rectangle of 70.6 metres in width and 37.5 metres' depth.\nThe hypostyle hall is divided into 17 aisles of eight bays, the central nave is wider, as well as the bay along the wall of the qibla. They cross with right angle in front of the mihrab, this device, named \"T shape\", which is also found in two Iraqi mosques in Samarra (around 847) has been adopted in many North African and Andalusian mosques where it became a feature.\nThe central nave, a sort of triumphal alley which leads to the mihrab, is significantly higher and wider than the other sixteen aisles of the prayer hall. It is bordered on each side of a double row of arches rested on twin columns and surmounted by a carved plaster decoration consisting of floral and geometric patterns.\nEnlightened by chandeliers which are applied in countless small glass lamps, the nave opens into the south portico of the courtyard by a monumental delicately carved wooden door, made in 1828 under the reign of the Husainids. This sumptuous door, which has four leaves richly carved with geometric motifs embossed on the bottom of foliages and interlacing stars, is decorated at the typanum by a stylised vase from which emerge winding stems and leaves. The other doors of the prayer hall, some of which date from the time of the Hafsids, are distinguished by their decoration which consists essentially of geometric patterns (hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular patterns, etc.).\n\nColumns and ceiling\nIn the prayer hall, the 414 columns of marble, granite or porphyry (among more than 500 columns in the whole mosque), taken from ancient sites in the country such as Sbeitla, Carthage, Hadrumetum and Chemtou, support the horseshoe arches. A legend says they could not count them without going blind. The capitals resting on the column shafts offer a wide variety of shapes and styles (Corinthian, Ionic, Composite, etc.). Some capitals were carved for the mosque, but others come from Roman or Byzantine buildings (dating from the second to sixth century) and were reused. According to the German archaeologist Christian Ewert, the special arrangement of reused columns and capitals surrounding the mihrab obeys to a well-defined program and would draw symbolically the plan of the Dome of the Rock. The shafts of the columns are carved in marble of different colors and different backgrounds. Those in white marble come from Italy, some shafts located in the area of the mihrab are in red porphyry imported from Egypt, while those made of greenish or pink marble are from quarries of Chemtou, in the north-west of current Tunisia. Although the shafts are of varying heights, the columns are ingeniously arranged to support fallen arches harmoniously. The height difference is compensated by the development of variable bases, capitals and crossbeams; a number of these crossbeams are in cedar wood. The wooden rods, which usually sink to the base of the transom, connect the columns together and maintain the spacing of the arches, thus enhancing the stability of all structures which support the ceiling of the prayer hall.\n\nThe covering of the prayer hall consists of painted ceilings decorated with vegetal motifs and two domes: one raised at the beginning of the central nave and the other in front of the mihrab. The latter, which its hemispherical cap is cut by 24 concave grooves radiating around the top, is based on ridged horns shaped shell and a drum pierced by eight circular windows which are inserted between sixteen niches grouped by two. The niches are covered with carved stone panels, finely adorned with characteristic geometric, vegetal and floral patterns of the Aghlabid decorative repertoire: shells, cusped arches, rosettes, vine-leaf, etc. From the outside, the dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame.\nThe painted ceilings are a unique ensemble of planks, beams and brackets, illustrating almost thousand years of the history of painting on wood in Tunisia. Wooden brackets offer a wide variety of style and decor in the shape of a crow or a grasshopper with wings or fixed, they are characterised by a setting that combines floral painted or carved, with grooves. The oldest boards date back to the Aghlabid period (ninth century) and are decorated with scrolls and rosettes on a red background consists of squares with concave sides in which are inscribed four-petaled flowers in green and blue, and those performed by the Zirid dynasty (eleventh century) are characterised by inscriptions in black kufic writing with gold rim and the uprights of the letters end with lobed florets, all on a brown background adorned with simple floral patterns.\nThe boards painted under the Hafsid period (during the thirteenth century) offers a floral decor consists of white and blue arches entwined with lobed green. The latest, dated the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (mostly dating from the time of the Muradid Beys), are distinguished by an epigraphic decoration consists of long black and red texts on olive green background to those painted from 1618 to 1619, under the reign of Murad I Bey (1613–1631), while those back to the eighteenth century have inscriptions in white naskhi script on an orange background.\n\nMihrab\nThe mihrab, which indicates the Qibla (direction of Mecca), in front of which stands the imam during the prayer, is located in the middle of the southern wall of the prayer hall. It is formed by an oven-shaped niche framed by two marble columns and topped by a painted wooden half-cupola. The niche of the mihrab is two metres long, 4.5 metres high and 1.6 metres deep.\nThe mosque's mihrab, whose decor is a remarkable witness of Muslim art in the early centuries of Islam, is distinguished by its harmonious composition and the quality of its ornaments. Considered as the oldest example of concave mihrab, it dates in its present state to 862–863 AD.\nIt is surrounded at its upper part by 139 lusterware tiles (with a metallic sheen), each one is 21.1 centimetres square and they are arranged on the diagonal in a chessboard pattern. Divided into two groups, they are dated from the beginning of the second half of the ninth century but it is not determined with certainty whether they were made in Baghdad or in Kairouan by a Baghdadi artisan, the controversy over the origin of this precious collection agitates the specialists. These tiles are mainly decorated with floral and plant motifs (stylised flowers, palm leaves and asymmetrical leaves on bottom hatch and checkered) belong to two series: one polychrome characterised by a greater richness of tones ranging from light gold to light, dark or ocher yellow, and from brick-red to brown lacquer, the other monochrome is a beautiful luster that goes from smoked gold to green gold. The coating around them is decorated with blue plant motifs dating from the eighteenth century or the first half of the nineteenth century. The horseshoe arch of the mihrab, stilted and broken at the top, rest on two columns of red marble with yellow veins, which surmounted with Byzantine style capitals that carry two crossbeams carved with floral patterns, each one is decorated with a Kufic inscription in relief.\nThe wall of the mihrab is covered with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have a wide variety of plant and geometric patterns including the stylised grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817–838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862–863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylised five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar, situated on the right of the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 metres' length to 3.31 metres in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856–863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although it has existed for more than eleven centuries, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.\n\nMaqsura\nThe maqsura, located near the minbar, consists of a fence bounding a private enclosure that allows the sovereign and his senior officials to follow the solemn prayer of Friday without mingling with the faithful. Jewel of the art of woodwork produced during the reign of the Zirid prince Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis and dated from the first half of the eleventh century, it is considered the oldest still in place in the Islamic world. It is a cedar wood fence finely sculpted and carved on three sides with various geometric motifs measuring 2.8 metres tall, eight metres long and six metres wide. Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed openwork merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art.\nThe library is near located, accessible by a door which the jambs and the lintel are carved in marble, adorned with a frieze of floral decoration. The library window is marked by an elegant setting that has two columns flanking the opening, which is a horseshoe arch topped by six blind arches and crowned by a series of berms sawtooth.\n\nArtworks\nThe Mosque of Uqba, one of the few religious buildings of Islam has remained intact almost all of its architectural and decorative elements, is due to the richness of its repertoire which is a veritable museum of Islamic decorative art and architecture. Most of the works on which rests the reputation of the mosque are still conserved in situ while a certain number of them have joined the collections of the Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art; Raqqada is located about ten kilometres southwest of Kairouan.\nFrom the library of the mosque comes a large collection of calligraphic scrolls and manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the second half of the ninth century. This valuable collection, observed from the late nineteenth century by the French orientalists Octave Houdas and René Basset who mention in their report on their scientific mission in Tunisia published in the Journal of African correspondence in 1882, comprises according to the inventory established at the time of the Hafsids (c. 1293–1294) several Qur'ans and books of fiqh that concern mainly the Maliki fiqh and its sources. These are the oldest fund of Maliki legal literature to have survived.\n\nAmong the finest works of this series, the pages of the Blue Qur'an, currently exhibited at Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art, from a famous Qur'an in the second half of the fourth century of the Hijrah (the tenth century) most of which is preserved in Tunisia and the rest scattered in museums and private collections worldwide. Featuring kufic character suras are written in gold on vellum dyed with indigo, they are distinguished by a compact graph with no marks for vowels. The beginning of each surah is indicated by a band consisting of a golden stylised leafy foliage, dotted with red and blue, while the verses are separated by silver rosettes. Other scrolls and calligraphic Qur'ans, as that known as the Hadinah's Qur'an, copied and illuminated by the calligrapher Ali ibn Ahmad al-Warraq for the governess of the Zirid prince Al-Muizz ibn Badis at about 1020 AD, were also in the library before being transferred to Raqqada museum. This collection is a unique source for studying the history and evolution of calligraphy of medieval manuscripts in the Maghreb, covering the period from the ninth to the eleventh century.\nOther works of art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around the tenth to the early eleventh century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).\n\nRole in Muslim civilisation\nAt the time of its greatest splendor, between the ninth and eleventh centuries AD, Kairouan was one of the greatest centres of Islamic civilisation and its reputation as a hotbed of scholarship covered the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a centre for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. One may conceivably compare its role to that of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nIn addition to studies on the deepening of religious thought and Maliki jurisprudence, the mosque also hosted various courses in secular subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and botany. The transmission of knowledge was assured by prominent scholars and theologians which included Sahnun ibn Sa'id and Asad ibn al-Furat, eminent jurists who contributed greatly to the dissemination of the Maliki thought, Ishaq ibn Imran and Ibn al-Jazzar in medicine, Abu Sahl al-Kairouani and Abd al-Monim al-Kindi in mathematics. Thus, the mosque, headquarters of a prestigious university with a large library containing a large number of scientific and theological works, was the most remarkable intellectual and cultural centre in North Africa during the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries.\n\nSee also\nAl-Zaytuna Mosque\nUniversity of al-Qarawiyyin\nList of the oldest mosques\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nDjelloul, Néji (2000).

      "summary": "The Great Mosque of Kairouan (Arabic: جامع القيروان الأكبر), also known as the Mosque of Uqba (جامع عقبة بن نافع), is a mosque situated in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Kairouan, Tunisia and is one of the largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. \nEstablished by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in 50 AH (670/671 CE) at the founding of the city of Kairouan, the mosque occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft).  It is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, and is a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb. Its perimeter, of about 405 metres (1,329 ft), contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.\nExtensive works under the Aghlabids two centuries later (9th Cent.AD/CE) gave the mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and expand. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role at the time can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. With the decline of the city from the mid-11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.",

      "content": "جامع عقبة بن نافع أو جامع القيروان الكبير هو مسجد بناه عقبة بن نافع في مدينة القيروان التي أسسها بعد فتح إفريقية (تونس حاليًا) على يد جيشه. كان الجامع حين إنشائه على أغلب الظن بسيطاً صغير المساحة تستند أسقفه على الأعمدة مباشرة، دون عقود تصل بين الأعمدة والسقف. وحرص الذين جددوا بناءه فيما بعد على هيئته العامة، وقبلته ومحرابه، وتوسع وزيد في مساحتهِ عدة مرات ولقي اهتمام الأمراء والخلفاء والعلماء في شتى مراحل التاريخ الإسلامي، حتى أصبح معلماً تاريخياً بارزاً ومهما.\nوبناء الجامع في شكلهِ وحجمهِ وطرازهِ المعماري الذي نراه اليوم يعود أساسا إلى عهد\nالدولة الأغلبية في القرن الثالث هجري أي القرن التاسع ميلادي وقد تواصلت أعمال الصيانة والتحسينات خصوصا في ظل الحكم الصنهاجي ثم في بداية العهد الحفصي.\nويعتبر المسجد الجامع بالقيروان من أضخم المساجد في الغرب الإسلامي وتبلغ مساحتهُ الإجمالية حوالي 9700 متر مربع، وبقياس ما يقارب 126 متر طولا و 77 متر عرضا، وحرم الصلاة فيهِ واسع ومساحته كبيرة يستند إلى مئآت الأعمدة الرخامية هذا إلى جانب صحن فسيح الأرجاء تحيط بهِ الأروقة ومع ضخامة مساحته يعد أيضا تحفة معمارية وأحد أروع المعالم الإسلامية.\n\nجامع القيروان يحتوي على كنوز قيمة فالمنبر يعتبر تحفة فنية رائعة وهو مصنوع من خشب الساج المنقوش ويعتبر أقدم منبر في العالم الإسلامي ما زال محتفظا به في مكانه الأصلي ويعود إلى القرن الثالث للهجرة أي التاسع ميلادي.\nكذلك مقصورة المسجد النفيسة التي تعود إلى القرن الخامس هجري أي الحادي عشر ميلادي وهي أيضا\nأقدم مقصورة ما زالت محتفظة بعناصرها الزخرفية الأصلية.\nالشكل الخارجي للجامع يوحي للناظر أنه حصن ضخم إذ أن جدران المسجد سميكة ومرتفعة وشدت بدعامات واضحة.\nومن آياته أن جمعت بقايا هذه الأمم السالفة لتؤلّف بيتا يذكر فيها اسم الله. وهو ما يضفي على جامع القيروان مسحة إنسانية تؤهّله ليصبح تراثا عالميا قد أسهمت في تشييده حضارات متتالية، وهو يعكس بذلك تاريخ إفريقية على امتداد ثلاثة آلاف سنة. فما من أمير أو خليفة أو سلطان يسعى لجميل الذكر وحسن الخلود ويبتغي ثواب ربه إلا وقد التمس وجها لاعمار هذا الجامع أو ترميمه وتحسين مظهره. فهذا الجامع مرآة ناصعة لتجليات الحضارة العربية الإسلامية في بلادنا.\nوجامع القيروان يمثّل الوجه المتألّق للعمارة القيروانية التي ظلّت من أبرز روافد العمارة المغربيّة والأندلسية عبر التاريخ حيث أصبح جامع عقبة بن نافع النموذج السائد والمثال الذي تحتذي به الجوامع المغربيّة عامّة والتونسيّة خاصّة. وتقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 156 كم من العاصمة تونس. وكلمة القيروان كلمة فارسية دخلت إلى العربية، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش أو استراحة القافلة وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب.\n\nتاريخ الجامع\nمثلما بُنيت مدينة القيروان بعد الفتح الإسلامي لشمال أفريقيا، بُني جامعها الكبير ويسمونه أيضا جامع عقبة بن نافع نسبة للقائد الأموي الذي اخضع القيروان كليا في حملته الثالثة عليها عام 665م. ويقال أن المدينة شيدت على أنقاض حصن للروم ودام بناؤها خمس سنوات انتهى عام 670 م، بعد عام بني الجامع الواقع في الطرف الشمالي من المدينة، فليس «أقدم من المدينة جامعها» كما هو متداول. والحال أنهما الاثنان ولدا في زمن واحد قبل ثلاثة عشر قرنا.\nإن من أبرز ما جادت به العبقريّة التونسية عبر العصور: جامع عقبة بن نافع بالقيروان. وهو يعتبر من أروع وأجل مآثر الحضارة العربية الإسلامية في العالم. وقد ظل هذا المعلم الشامخ يبهر الناظرين والدارسين بتناسق عمارته وتآلف عناصره وثراء رصيد الفني وتلألأ أنواره. فمن أعلى صومعته صاح الرسام العالمي بول كلي « Paul Klee » الآن أصبحت رساما وذلك لفرط ما سرى فيه من إحساس بالظل النور. واعتبر الأديب الفرنسي قي دي منبسان الذي زار القيروان في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر جامع عقبة بن نافع من روائع الدنيا لما ينطوي عليه من إبراز للعبقريّة الإسلامية التي استطاعت نحت روحها وعقيدتها الدينية من خلال شتات من المواد الصخرية المتناثرة في إطلال بائدة لأمم غابرة. فالمتأمل في العناصر التي اتّخذت في بناء جامع القيروان يقف على مجموعة فريدة من الأعمدة والتيجان والوسادات المستجلبة من الخرائب الرومانية والبيزنطيّة آثار حضارات تلاشت واندثرت فيتذكر ارم ذات العماد التي لم يخلق مثلها في البلاد وثمود الذين جابوا الصخر بالواد، كل هذه الحضارات انقرضت ولم يبق إلا وجه ربك الواحد الأحد.\nأول من جدد بناء الجامع بعد عقبة هو حسان بن النعمان الغساني الذي هدمه كله وأبقى المحراب وأعاد بناءه بعد أن وسعه وقوى بنيانه وكان ذلك في عام 80 هـ.\nفي عام 105 هـ طلب الخليفة الأموي هشام بن عبد الملك من واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفران أن يزيد في بناء المسجد ويوسعه، فأشترى بشر أرض شمالي المسجد وضمها إليه، وأضاف لصحن المسجد مكانا للوضوء وبنى مئذنة للمسجد في منتصف جداره الشمالي عند بئر تسمى بئر الجنان. وبعدها بخمسين عاما (155 هـ) قام يزيد بن حاتم والي أبي جعفر المنصور على أفريقية بإصلاح وترميم وزخرفة المسجد.\nفي عام 221 هـ هدم ثاني أمراء الأغلبيين زيادة الله بن الأغلب أجزاء من الجامع لتوسعته كما رفع سقفه وبنى قبة مزخرفة بلوحات رخامية على أسطوانة المحراب. أراد زيادة الله أن يهدم المحراب إلا أن فقهاء القيروان عارضوه وقالوا له: «إن من تقدمك توقفوا عن ذلك لما كان واضعه عقبة بن نافع ومن كان معه». قال بعض المعماريين: «أنا أدخله بين حائطين فيبقى دون أن يظهر في الجامع أثر لغيرك»، فأخذ بهذا الرأي وأمر ببناء محراب جديد بالرخام الأبيض المخرم الذي يطل منه الناظر على محراب عقبة الأساسي.\nفي عام 248 هـ زين أحمد بن محمد الأغلبي المنبر وجدار المحراب بلوحات رخامية وقرميد خزفي. وفي عام 261 هـ وسع أحمد الأغلبي الجامع وبنى قبة باب البهو وأقام مجنبات تدور حول الصحن. وفي هذه المرحلة يعتقد أن الجامع قد وصل إلى أقصى درجات جماله.\nفي عام 441 هـ قام المعز بن باديس بترميم المسجد وتجديد بنائه وبنى لهُ مقصورة خشبية لا تزال موجودة إلى يومنا هذا بجانب محراب المسجد. ثم جدد الحفصيون المسجد مرة أخرى بعد الغزوة الهلالية.\nجامع عقبة بن نافع بناه القائد عقبة بن نافع (رضي الله عنه) في مدينة القيروان التي أسسها بعد فتح تونس على يد جيشه المقدام.. كان بسيطاً صغير المساحة، تستند أسقفه على الأعمدة مباشرة، دون عقود تصل بين الأعمدة والسقف.\nوحرص الذين جددوا بناءه فيما بعد على هيئته العامة، وقبلته ومحرابه، وقد تمت زيادة مساحته كثيراً، ولقي اهتمام الأمراء والخلفاء والعلماء في شتى مراحل التاريخ الإسلامي، حتى أصبح مَعلماً تاريخياً بارزاً ومهماً في تاريخنا العظيم.\nالشكل الخارجي للجامع يوحي للناظر أنه حصن ضخم، بسبب جدرانه السميكة والمرتفعة التي شُّدت بدعامات واضحة للعيان.\nأول من جدده حسان بن النعمان الغساني سنة 80هـ، فقد هدمه كله وأبقى على المحراب وأعاد بناءه بعد أن وسعه وقوى بنيانه.\nوفي عام 105 هـ قام الخليفة الأموي هشام بن عبد الملك بالطلب من واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفران أن يزيد في بناء المسجد ويوسعه، فقام بشر بشراء أرض شمالي المسجد وضمها إليه، وأضاف لصحن المسجد مكاناً للوضوء.\nوبنى مئذنة للمسجد في منتصف جداره الشمالي عند بئر تسمى بئر الجنان، وبعدها بخمسين عاماً (155هـ) قام يزيد بن حاتم والي أبو جعفر المنصور على أفريقية بإصلاح وترميم وزخرفة المسجد.\nتعتبر مئذنة جامع عقبة من أجمل المآذن التي بناها المسلمون في أفريقيا، تتكون من ثلاث طبقات مربعة الشكل، وفوق الطبقات الثلاث قبة مفصصة، ويصل ارتفاع المئذنة إلى 31.5 متراً.\nوتقع في الحائط المواجه لجدار القبلة في أقصى الصحن المكشوف، ويدور بداخلها درج ضيق يرتفع كلما ارتفع المبنى متناسباً مع حجمه، ويضيق كلما ارتفعنا لأعلى.\nفي المسجد ست قباب وهي: قبة المحراب، وقبة باب البهو، وقبتان تعلوان مدخل بيت الصلاة، وقبة تعلو المجنبة الغربية للمسجد، وقبة في أعلى المئذنة.\nلذلك فهو تحفة فنية نادرة الوجود، تدل على عظمة أجدادنا في فن العمار الهندسي الرائع.\n\nمقاييس الجامع\nالمسجد اليوم لا يزال يحتفظ بمقاييسه الأولى التي كان عليها أيام إبراهيم بن أحمد الاغلبي، يبلغ طوله 126 متراً وعرضه 77 مترا. وطول بيت الصلاة فيه 70 مترا وعرضه حوالي 38 مترا وصحنه المكشوف طوله 67 وعرضه 56 مترا. ولهذا الصحن مجنبات عرض كل منها نحو ستة أمتار وربع المتر.\nيغطي بيت الصلاة ثلث مساحة المسجد تقريبا.\nيوحي الجامع للناظر أنه حصن ضخم. إذ أن جدرانه سميكة ومرتفعة وشدت بدعامات واضحة. ويتميّز تخطيط الجامع ببساطته فهو يتكوّن من مستطيل منحرف ومبنى في اتّجاه الطول اقتداء بالجوامع العراقيّة ويبلغ طوله بين 127،6و 125.2 وعرضه بين 78م عند جدار القبلة و71.70م. ويُعَدُّ بذلك من أكبر المساجد الجامعة الباقية في الإسلام، وأعظمها مظهرًا. وأبعاد جامع القيروان تخضع إلى العدد الذهبي 62.1 المتعارف لدى الإغريق ثمّ الرومان من بعدهم. وهذا العدد هو المعتمد في التدليل على حسن تناسق الأبعاد الهندسيّة لمعلم ما وتناغم أحجامه.\n\nالمئذنة والقباب\nالمئذنة\nتعتبر مئذنة جامع عقبة من أقدم وأجمل المآذن التي بناها المسلمون في أفريقيا. وتعد جميع المآذن التي بنيت بعدها في بلاد المغرب العربي على شاكلتها ولا تختلف عنها إلا قليلا، ومن المآذن التي تشبهها مئذنة جامع صفاقس، ومآذن جوامع تلمسان وأغادير والرباط وجامع القرويين، هذا غير بعض مآذن مساجد الشرق كمئذنة مسجد الجيوشي في مصر.\n\nتتكون المئذنة من ثلاث طبقات كلها مربعة الشكل، والطبقة الثانية أصغر من الأولى، والثالثة أصغر من الثانية، وفوق الطبقات الثلاث قبة مفصصة. يصل ارتفاع المئذنة الكلية إلى 31.5 متراً.\nتقع المئذنة في الحائط المواجه لجدار القبلة في أقصى الصحن المكشوف، وضلع طبقتها الأولى المربعة من أسفل يزيد على 10.5 متر مع ارتفاع يضاهي 19 مترا، وتم بناء الأمتار الثلاثة والنصف الأولى منه بقطع حجرية مصقولة، بينما شيد بقية جسم المئذنة بقطع حجرية مستطيلة الشكل كقوالب الأجر.\nالطابق الثاني من المئذنة مزين بطاقات ثلاث مغلقة ومعقودة في كل وجه من أوجه المنارة، في حين زين كل وجه من أوجه الطابق الثالث بنافذة حولها طاقتان مغلقتان، ويوجد في أعلى الجدار الأعلى من كل طابق شرفات على هيئة عقود متصلة ومفرغة وسطها.\nيدور بداخل المئذنة درج ضيق يرتفع كلما ارتفع المبنى متناسبا مع حجمه حيث يضيق كلما ارتفعنا لأعلى. يعتقد أن هذه المنارة لم تبن دفعة واحدة، حتى إن الجزء الأول الأضخم منها بني في عهد الخليفة الأموي هشام بن عبد الملك أيام واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفوان، ثم أكملت عملية البناء بعد مدة طويلة حيث بني الجزءان الثاني والثالث فوق تلك القاعدة الضخمة.\n\nالقباب\nفي مسجد عقبة ست قباب:\n\nقبة المحراب وتعد أقدم قبة بنيت في المغرب الإسلامي.\nقبة باب البهو على مدخل البلاط الأوسط من جهة الصحن، وقد تم الاعتناء بها وزخرفتها بشكل كبير، وأعطت توازنا على بيت الصلاة. بعدها، أصبح بناء قبتين في بيوت الصلاة قاعدة ثابتة في مساجد المغرب الإسلامي.\nقبتان تعلوان مدخل بيت الصلاة في الشرق والغرب.\nقبة تعلو المجنبة الغربية للمسجد.\nقبة في أعلى المئذنة.\n\nزخارف الجامع\nمن أفضل زخارف الجامع زخارف المحراب والقبة التي فوقه. تكسو المحراب زخارف منقوشة على ألواح رخامية يوجد فيها فراغات تسمح بدخول الضوء وقد زين جدار المحراب بمربعات من الخزف ذو البريق المعدني المذهب. تغطي القبة زخارف نباتية على شكل ساق متوسطة أو فروع متموجة تتدلى منها عناقيد من العنب.\nوتغطي القبة زخارف نباتية على شكل ساق متوسطة أو فروع متموجة تتدلى منها عناقيد من العنب، أما المنبر فهو محفور على الخشب وفيه زخارف هندسية ونباتية، ويعود عهده إلى عام 248هـ.\nأما المنبر فهو محفور على الخشب وفيه زخارف هندسية ونباتية، ومصنوع من خشب الساج المستورد من الهند ويتكون من أكثر من 300 لوحة\nمنقوشه تتميز بلونها الزخرفي الفريد وهذا المنبر من أبدع ما أنتجته المدرسة القيروانية\nفي ظل الحكم الأغلبي ويعود عهده إلى عام 248 هـ.\nوتعتبر المقصورة التي توجد على يمين المنبر من أقدم المقصورات في العالم الإسلامي\nويعود عهدها إلى القرن الخامس هجري أي الحادي عشر ميلادي وقد أمر بصنعها الأمير المعز بن باديس من سلالة بنو زيري.\nو المقصورة تحفة فنية من خشب الأرز المحفور والمصقول بشكل بديع وقد زينت بنقيشة\nكتبت بالخط الكوفي المورق تعد من أروع النماذج الخطية في الفن الإسلامي.\nقرابة خمسة وخمسين مجموعة مختلفة النحت والزخرفة والتخريم لتيجان الأعمدة في الأروقة المحيطة بصحن المسجد من المرمر الأبيض والأبيض المشوب بالخضرة والحجر الجيري الأبيض والأبيض المائل للصفرة من مناطق مختلفة، من آثار رومانية وكنائس بيزنطية.. لم اعثر على تاجين متجاورين متشابهين عدا أعمدة باب البهو التي بنيت فيما بعد، في القرن الحادي عشر. ماذا دار في خلد المعماري وهو ينأى بعيدا عن التكرار ؟ ألم يكن ابن صحراء تتكرر مشاهدها كل يوم منذ الولادة حتى الممات، أو ابن مدينة لا يختلف فيها بيت عن جاره ولا نهج عن نهج بما يفضي إليه ؟ كان يدرك أن اللاتماثل واستواء الأضداد إنما هو طريق يفضي إلى جمال هارب من ألفة السياق يكمن في أخاديد الحجر واختلال القياس وغربة التاريخ... جمال يجمع تاجا من مرمر مزينا بصليب وعمودا مزينا بطرة مربعة منقوش عليها (لا قوة إلا بالله وعليه توكلنا) كان واثقا أنهما يرفعان سقف بيت الله بنفس الكفاءة. انه برهان على حقيقة كانت تعنيه بقدر أكبر مما تعنينا الآن.\n\nروعة الهندسة المعمارية\nيكشف لنا الجامع الكبير في القيروان عن عمارة ذات منطق مغاير وذائقة تستبطن بدائية ثقافة شعبية، ثقافة غير مشذبة أهملت ترف العمارة المدنية أو على الأرجح أنها تجهل وسائل تحقيقها. عزز ذلك الواقع أن الحجارة والأعمدة التي جلبت من مختلف المناطق التونسية هي بقايا آثار رومانية وبيزنطية وكنائس هدمت في وقتها، فهي مواد مستعملة سابقا بعضها قد تكسر وتشوه شكله بفعل الهدم والنقل البدائي. لقد أدت مجموعة المواد المختلفة وغير المتماثلة إلى نتائج لم تكن في الحسبان، نتائج لا تنتمي لإسم بعينه ولا لمادة محددة ولا لزمن محسوب، حتى أن الجامع ذاته الذي شيده عقبة بن نافع لم يبق منه ذكرى سوى محراب يختفي خلف المحراب الذي بناه بنو الأغلب (يمكن مشاهدة محراب عقبة بن نافع عبر خروم المحراب القائم حاليا). إنها نتائج لا يمكن أن تركن في زاوية معينة، إذ أسهمت في صياغتها عوامل لا حصر لها مجهول أغلبها.\nوقل في المساجد القديمة مسجد ينافس بصحنه صحن جامع القيروان بقياس أضلاع شكله شبه المربع، وكل ذلك الفضاء الفسيح المبلط برخام حديث لا يكاد يكون للمزاولة الشمسية الموجودة فيه فوق مبنى صغير الحجم، وكذلك فوهات المواجل الخمس المكونة في أصل تيجان أعمدة رخامية عتيقة ضخمة. وعند مسيل الماء في الصحن تشاهد تلك المصفاة المربعة ذات الدوائر والسطوح المتفاوتة لتصفية مياه الأمطار المنحدرة إلى الخزانات الواسعة الموجودة فيه تحت الصحن.\n\nو للجامع ثمانية مداخل، أربعة في الجانب الشرقي وأربعة في الجانب الغربي وواحد من هذه المداخل فقط في الجانب الشرقي له بهو، أما الرابع فهو من الشمال المعروف بأسم باب الله رجانا المنسوب - حسب النقش - إلى أبي حفص في عام 693هـ -1294م والثلاثة أبواب الأخرى قائمة في ارتدادات مقنطرة ضحلة مختلفة العمق ومحاطة بأعمدة نصف ظاهرة، أقواس المدخلين الأولين متشابهة تماما، كلاهما ذو قالب زخرفي ممتد حولها ويشكل عقدة في القمة، ثم يمتد حتى يشكل إطارا مستطيلا والنتيجة هو أنه شكل نسخة طبق الأصل عن قوس باب الله رجانا. أما الباب الثلاث فإن حجارته مستوردة تماما بالطلاء الكلسي ولكن قوسه من النوع المدبب البسيط، الذي لا يشبه بأي شكل أقواس الجزء القديم من المسجد.\nوتوجد أمام الأبواب جهة الجانب الغربي بهو صغير مقنطر في الباب الأول والرابع وآخر متصالب والأخير بسيط مؤلف من العوارض الخشبية. والباب الوحيد الخالي نسبيا من الكسوة والطلاء الأبيض هو المدخل الرئيسي للحرم المعروف باسم السلطات مقابل باب الله رجانا. وإلى الجنوب من الباب في الجانب الغربي يوجد ارتداد آخر بعرض (2.75) مترا يعلوه قوس دائري حدودي وهذان المدخلان لابد وأنهما كانا على جانب الواجهة القديمة للحرم بما هو الحال في مسجدي دمشق وقرطبة.\n\nتقنية الأعمدة\nكانت الأعمدة من أهم الأشياء التي تناولها الفن الإسلامي، وقد اتخذت تيجانًاوعقودًا مدبَّبَة، وروابط خشبية، حتى إنه ظهر ما يُعْرَفُ بعلم عقود الأبنية، وقدأصبحت أقواس حدوة الفرس تدلُّ على الفنِّ المعماري الإسلامي، وإن وُجِدَتِ الأقواس قبلاً إلاَّ أنه قد تَغَيَّر شكلها على يد المسلمين.\nأسهمت الحجارة والأعمدة متباينة المنشأ المستعملة مرارا في مضاعفة حجة العمارة على تأكيد نظامها الخاص. فعبر ما يقارب سبعة قرون من الترميم وإعادة البناء واستخدام البواقي من المواد تم الحصول على مبنى فريد لا يشبه أي مبنى آخر. كيف نفسر وجود كتلة صخرية على الضلع الخارجي للدعامة الثانية ما قبل الأخيرة من جهة بيت الصلاة؟ حجر بيزنطي منحوت يزن أكثر من طن بدا كأنه سيسقط أرضا نبت على الجدار، لا تدري مغزاه، ولا وظيفته الانشائية، فلا تراه الا نزوة، نزوة متطامنة مع استخدام ما تحت يديه من مواد كلها وايجاد مواقع لها في نظامه الخاص.\n\nتقنية المقرنصات\nكذلك كانت المقرنصات من أبرز خصائص الفنِّ المعماري الإسلامي، وتعني الأجزاء المتدلِّيَة من السقف، والمقرنصات منها داخلية وخارجية: انتشرت\nالداخلية في المحاريب والسقوف، وكانت الخارجية في صحون المآذن وأبواب القصور والشرفات.\n\nالمشربيات\nكما كان من مظاهر الفنِّ المعماري الإسلامي الظاهرة بناء مشربيات البيوت مخرمةً أو مزخرفة، وتسمَّى قمرية إذا كانت مستديرة، أو شمسية إذا كانت غير مستديرة، أو حتى شيشًا، وهي من خشب خُرِطَ كستائر للنوافذ، من فوائدها أنها تُخَفِّفُ حِدَّة الضوء، وتُمَكِّنُ النساء من مشاهدة مَنْ بالخارج دون أن يراهنَّ أَحَدٌ، وقد أصبح ذلك طابع البيوت الإسلامية.\n\nتأثيرات الفن الأغلبي والفاطمي\nزاوجت القيروان في تخطيطها بين خصوصية موقعها وعبقرية أهلها أهمية مركزها الديني والحضاري، وقد شابهت في عموم رسومها وبنيانها ما كان ينبغي أن تشبه فيه سائر العواصم والمدن العربية وكما انطبعت الصناعة الأغلبية الغالبة بجامع القيروان بالتأثيرات الفنية الشرقية والبغدادية فإننا نلاحظ تأثير الفن الفاطمي المصري الواضح في الزخارف الملونة على خشب سقوف عدد من الأروقة. ماعدا سقف الأسكوب القبلي الكبير فهو السقف الوحيد الأصلي الباقي بالجامع، حيث لا تزال ألوانه القزحية تحتفظ بجاذبيتها وتناسبها عبر الأشكال الزهرية التي تحليه. ويختص جامع القيروان بسقوفه الخشبية المدهونة والمصقولة الراجعة إلى فترات تاريخية مختلفة تمتد بشريطها الكتابي المورق على ما يربو عن الألف سنة. وهي تنضاف إلى المقصورة الفريدة التي بناها المعز باديس باريس بجامع القيروان حوالي (425هـ) وهي مجموعة متكاملة تسمح بتتبع خطوات نشأة الفن التجريدي المعاصر.\n\nالمحراب\nويعد المحراب تحفة المحاريب الإسلامية في أدنى تفصيل من تفصيلاته وهو الآن أقدمها على الإطلاق. وقد صنعت نصف القبة الدائرية بأعلاه من ألواح متراوحة من أفخر خشب الساج. وهي تمتاز بزخرفتها الفنية الرائعة التي حافظت على تكوينها الزاهي وتذهيبها البديع رغم تقادم الزمن مما يدل على المواد المختارة المستعملة في ذلك. وليس لتلك الأوراق المخمسة والعناقيد المذببة في سمائها من حد لتشابكها وتعانقها إلا حدود الرحلة الفنية التي انتهت بها يد الفنان القيرواني. ومهما يطلب من سمات لهذه القبة في معالم فنية مماثلة في الشرق الأموي أو الغرب البيزنطي لعهدها فإنها تبقى نسيجا وحدها. ويقوم العقد المنصف للقبة على ساريتين حمراوين من الرخام الرفيع يعلوهما تاجان من أجمل ما نقشت التيجان. وفوقهما مسطحان يتوسطهما العقد كتب على رخام كل منهما بالخط الكوفي القيرواني الأصيل: «بسم الله، كفى بالله حسيبا».\nويزين أعلى جدران المحراب وعقده مربعات زخرفية أو (قراميد) تمتاز ببريقها المعدني وعددها (130) قطعة. ولا يعرف أقدم من نوعها في الإسلام. ويقال لها باللسان القيرواني (جليزيات) وقد استقدمها من العراق أبو إبراهيم أحمد الأغلبي وزينتها واضحة التأثير بالتقاليد الفارسية. انها في جبين المحراب وطوقه حلية فريدة.\n\nالمنبر\nوعلى يمين المحراب يقوم «أجمل وأعرق منبر في الإسلام». وهو من خشب الساج المجلوب، أجزاؤه التي يزيد على الثلاثمائة لوحة منقوشة نقشا دقيقا يذهل المقارن بينهما لاستقلال كل واحدة منها، رغم كثرتها، بزينة مخصوصة. وكلها متماسكة من عجب بدون غراء ولا مسامير، لكن بمواشير خشبية متداخلة. وفي مدينة بيونيه، عاصمة السلاجقة منبر يحاكي منبر القيروان ويقاربه في التاريخ. ويضفي ضوء النهار المتعاكس على نقاش تلك اللوحات جمالا باهرا. ولعلها هي الخزف البراق بأعلى المحراب صناعة بغدادية قيروانية متوأمة للصلة القوية التي كانت في عهد الأغالبة بين العراق وإفريقية.\n\nالمقصورة المعزية\nوحذو المحراب الساق بالساق تمتد المقصورة المعزية، نسبة إلى المعز لدين الله الصنهاجي الذي بناه في سنة (431هـ / 1023م) وأصلحت بعد ستة قرون من ذلك التاريخ. ويقدر طولها بثمانية أمتار وارتفاعها بـ (2.80 متر). وأحد طوليها حائط القبلة نفسه وتفتح من ناحيته على بيت الإمام. وأما الباب الذي يفضي إليه من جهة بيت الصلاة فله دفتان كبيرتان مطعمتان بالصفائح الغليظة والمسامير المحدودبة . وأجمل ما في المقصورة شرفتها المميزة ذات الفتحة المستطيلة في الوسط إلى جانب هندسة المقصورة نفسها وأسلوب خراطة خشبها ونقشه، ومما نقرأ في نقش بأعلاه: «بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم وصلى الله على النبي محمد وآله وسلم تسليما، مما أمر بعمله أبو تميم المعز بن باديس بن منصور سلام الله عليه ...» ويشبه الإفريز المكتوب عليه ذلك النقش إفريزا مثله بضريح القائد الفاتح محمود الفزنوي في أفغانستان، بل أن إفريز مقصورة القيروان يكاد يكون هو الشبه الأمثل.\n\nالصومعة\nومن أجمل ما يميز الصومعة القيروانية شرفات طابقيها الأول والثاني بما تمنحها وحداتها من تقويس بسيط في عقودها وتساو محكم في المجالات الفاصلة بينهما والفراغات المتوسطة بداخلها. ويجلل الطابق الأعلى على قبة مضلعة يظن أنها من إضافات العهد الحفصي. (آخر القرن التاسع هـ/ الثالث عشر م). وبأعلاها ثلاث كرات نحاسية متفاوتة الحجم وفوقها رسم للهلال من نحاس أيضا رمزا إلى مواقيت الإسلام في قوله تعالى «يسألونك عن الآهلة قل هي مواقيت للناس».\nوتشير فتحته إلى اتجاه القبلة . ومن أعلى الصومعة ذات البناء الهرمي اللطيف يستطيع الزائر أو المشاهد الاستمتاع بمنظر المدينة الجميل ذات البياض المشرق وما يحيط بها من سهول وله كذلك أن يتأمل أبعاد الجامع من جميع جهاته ويشاهد بإعجاب قباب بيت الصلاة والأبواب الخارجية الفخمة والعضائد السميكة التي تدعم جداره الخارجي، وفي الوقت نفسه تكثر من حدة الشمس وتأثير الرياح عليه، فهي للعائذين به ظلا ودفئا دائمين. وتحيط بباب الصومعة رخامات ثلاث عظيمة الحجم، محفور عليها بأشكال نباتية بديعة. ومن نوادر المسجد أيضا«الزبيبتان» وهما في اصطلاح أهل القيروان الساريتان الكبيرتان الملونتان بلون العنب الجاف القائمتان من كل جانب بآخر الرواق الأوسط عند المحراب. ويقال في اعتقاد العامة أن من يجتاز بينهما ييسر الله دخول الجنة. ومهما يكن مصدر ذلك الاعتقاد إلا أنه غالبا ما يكون عند بسطاء الإيمان من أسباب الزيارة. وهما الساريتان اللتان قيل أن إمبراطور روما عندما علم بهما أعطى وزنهما ذهبا ! وهما من الرخام السماقي أو البرفيري.\nيتواصل اليوم إشعاع الجامع المسجد ليبقى المنارة التي حملت وأشاعت حضارة الدين الإسلامي، وساهمت في تواصل هذه الحضارة.\n\nأقدم من المدينة جامعها\nثمة قول يردده التونسيون يفيد بأن جامع القيروان أقدم من مدينها وهو كناية عن علاقة الجامع بالمدينة.\nوجامع عقبة أو جامع القيروان هو أكبر مساجد الإسلام القديمة وأول بناء أقيم في إفريقيا المسلمة في أول عاصمة أسست لها، وما من أمير أو خليفة أو سلطان يبتغي جميل الذكر وحسن الخلود وخاصة الثواب عند الله إلا وقد التمس لوحا من ناحية من هذا المسجد يسجل فيه ترميما قام به أو تحسينا أذن به.\nويعد الجامع من أبرز ما جاءت به العمارة القيروانية، آبدة الحضارة الإسلامية بالمغرب فقد كان محل تعهد من طرف الولاة والأمراء الأفارقة.\nويعود الفضل لزيادة الله الأول في رسم ملامحه وتخطيطه النهائي (220-226 هـ) وهو يشتمل على 17 بلاطة وثمانية أساكيب ويستمد تخطيطه من الجوامع الأموية مع الاقتداء بجامع الرسول صلى الله وعليه وسلم.\nولمدينة القيروان مكانة خاصة في وجدان الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي الذي حباها وخصها باعتمادات مالية هامة في مخططات التنمية أعادت لها مجدها وظل اعلامها ورموزها.\nولقد كان من أبرز وأحدث مظاهر الاهتمام بجامع القيروان المشروع الرئاسي الكبير الذي شرع في إنجازه في شهر نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2000. والمتعلق بالإنارة الفنية للجامع بما زاده رونقا واجلالا وأظهرت روعة المعمار الذي يختصر به، سيما وأن هذه الإنارة يمكن أن تكون متحركة لأنها تعمل وفق منظومة إلكترونية وتتغير حسب توقيت زمني مبرمج مسبقا وقد أنجزت هذا المشروع التحديثي الذي يزيد الجامع بهاء وتألقا بخبرات تونسية.\nوإذا كانت من عادة التونسيين سنويا إحياء ذكرى المولد النبوي الشريف في رحاب جامع عقبة فإنهم أيضا يفضلون مدينة القيروان في شهر رمضان المبارك للصلاة في جامعها الأعظم ولزيارة الأسواق المحيطة به للتعرف على ما تركه الأسلاف من إرث حضاري يحي سيرة القيروان مدينة الخشوع ، عاصمة المخزون التراثي الإسلامي لا في تونس فحسب وانما في المغرب العربي وشمال أفريقيا.\nويتميز جامع القيروان دون غيره من جوامع العالم الإسلامي التاريخية بما في ذلك جوامع عواصم الخلافة بالإضافة إلى معماره وتركيبته الهندسية بالمحافظة على أغلب أثاثه الأصلي الذي يرجع إلى فتراته الأولى وحسبنا للتدليل على ذلك أن نذكر المنبر الخشبي 298هـ وهو أقدم المنابر الإسلامية التي سلمت من تقلب الأزمان وهو مصنوع من خشب الساج. ويشتمل على ما يربو عن 106 لوحات تحمل زخارف نباتية وهندسية بديعة وتعبر عن تمازج التأثيرات البيزنطية والفارسية وتوحدها في روح إسلامية .\n\nتزاوج بين الأمس واليوم\nويتألف المسجد من بناء مستطيل كبير، محوره الرئيسي يتجه تقريبا إلى الجنوب الشرقي ومظهر غاية في الانتظام والجمال. وترتكز الأبواب في الجانب الجنوبي الغربي بين دعامتين في معظم الحالات، وهناك رواق في الفراغ بينهما . والكل مغطى بآثار متعددة من الطلاء الكلسي ما عدا الدعائم في الجانب القبلي . وبما أن الأرض تنحدر من الشمال الغربي إلى الجنوب الشرقي فإن الجدران تختلف في الارتفاع من ثمانية أمتار إلى حوالي عشرة أمتار. والسمات الجيدة من الخارج هي القباب الخمسة والمئذنة الهائلة.\n\nوتتقسم قاعدة الحرم إلى سبعة عشر جناحا بواسطة ستة عشر صفا من الأعمدة المتعامدة من الجدار الخلفي دون أن تصل إليه، لأن صفا عرضانيا يمتد على بعد ستة أمتار منه، وعلى هذا الأخير تستند الصفو ف الستة عشر. ويتألف كل من هذه الصفوف من سبعة أقواس مترابطة بواسطة صفين عرضانيين، يمتدان خلالهما بين القوسين الأول والثاني، والقوسين الرابع والخامس من الواجهة الأصلية على الصحن. ولا يخترق الصف الأخير الرواق المركزي.\nويبلغ متوسط ارتفاع الأعمـدة (3.55 مترا) ويترواح قطرها بين (34و44 سم). وتيجان هذه الأعمدة من أنواع مختلفة. بعض الأعمدة لها قواعد، أما أعمدة الصف الذي يبطن الجناح المركزي يبلغ متوسط ارتفاعها (4.23 مترا)، والأعمدة التي تحمل القبة أكثر ارتفاعا وهي أجمل ما في الحرم بعضها من الرخام الملون الجميل، وبعضها من الرخام الغرانيت، أو الرخام السماقي .\nويخيل لمن يطلع على المدينة من مكان مشرف أو من صومعة الجامع، وهي أعلى ما هناك أن قيروان الأغالبة والفاطميين وبني زيري هي قيروان اليوم... لو لا شيئا من التضييق في دائرة سورها الحسيني الحالي بالقياس إلى سورها الأموي القديم، بحيث لو أعيد عليها الآن لحّوط على جميع ما تخرم جوانبها حديثا من البناءات والمرافق والمنشآت، وربما تجاوزها إلى ما وراءها ببعيد... ومن النادر أن تجد أو تلمح روعة القدم على مدينة في العصر الحديث في عمر مدينة القيروان.\n\nمشاريع إعمار وتوسعة\nيؤكد الباحثون وعلماء الآثار أنه لم يبق من البناء الأول الذي بناه الفاتح عقبة بن نافع من الجامع سنة 50 للهجرة سوى المحراب. وهو مورى الآن خلف المحراب الأغلبي القائم. ولكن بالإمكان مشاهدته من خلال ثقوب زخرفية فيه مخصصة فيما يبدو لذلك الغرض في لوحات تزينه. أما بناء الجامع الماثل اليوم للعيان فيرجع إلى تجديدات عديدة وزيادات مختلفة يعود أهمها إلى آخر القرن الأول ثم القرنين الثاني والثالث. غير أن الفضل في بقاء محراب عقبة من الطوب إلى الأثر المشهور الوارد بحقه.\nوذلك أن عقبة وجماعة الصحابة «اختلفوا عليه في القبلة، وقالوا إن جميع أهل المغرب يصنعون قبلتهم على قبلة هذا المسجد. فأجهد نفسه في تقويمها. فأقاموا أياما ينظرون إلى مطالع الشتاء والصيف من النجوم ومشارق الشمس فلما رأى أمرهم قد اختلف بات مغموما فدعا الله عز وجل أن يفرج عنه فأتاه آت في منامه فقال له: إذا أصبحت فخذ اللواء في يدك واجعله على عنقك. فإنك تسمع بين يديك تكبيرا لا يسمعه أحد من المسلمين غيرك فانظر الموضع الذي ينقطع عنك فيه التكبير، فهو قبلتك ومحرابك».\nو تم له ما رأى في المنام «فركز لواءه وقال: هذا محرابك».\nويعود إلى الفاتح الصحابي حسان بن النعمان بناء الجامع على أثار عقبة بن نافع. فهو الذي أخذ فيه ووسعه أثناء ولايته (74 – 79هـ) بأمر من الخليفة الأموي في دمشق هشـام بن عبد الملك، ويقال أنه بأمر الخليفة هشام بنى بشير بن صفـوان خلال ولايتـه (103 – 109هـ) صومعة الجامع . وعنها يقول البكرى: «بنى الصومعة في بئر الجنان ونصب أساسها على الماء، واتفق أن وقعت في وسط الحائط». والجنان المقصود هو بستان لبني فهر. قوم عقبة.\nوالحائط هو الجدار الخارجي الذي قد يكون عقبة أو من بعده خطه للجامع. ويبدو أن اختيار البئر للنصب أساس الصومعة بها راجع إلى ما توفره البئر من عمق مناسب واتساع وحجارة صلدة في بناءها، خاصة إذا كانت من بناء الأول. أما توسطها للحائط القائمة فيه، وهو الحائط الشمالي، فلم يجعلها مقابلة تماما للمحراب المتوسط بطبيعة الحال في الجهة القبلية، بسبب الشكل المستطيل غير المتوازي الأضلاع الذي تهيأ للجامع.\n\nصور\nمقالات ذات صلة\nقائمة مساجد تونس\n\n\n== مراجع ==",
      "summary": "جامع عقبة بن نافع أو جامع القيروان الكبير هو مسجد بناه عقبة بن نافع في مدينة القيروان التي أسسها بعد فتح إفريقية (تونس حاليًا) على يد جيشه. كان الجامع حين إنشائه على أغلب الظن بسيطاً صغير المساحة تستند أسقفه على الأعمدة مباشرة، دون عقود تصل بين الأعمدة والسقف. وحرص الذين جددوا بناءه فيما بعد على هيئته العامة، وقبلته ومحرابه، وتوسع وزيد في مساحتهِ عدة مرات ولقي اهتمام الأمراء والخلفاء والعلماء في شتى مراحل التاريخ الإسلامي، حتى أصبح معلماً تاريخياً بارزاً ومهما.\nوبناء الجامع في شكلهِ وحجمهِ وطرازهِ المعماري الذي نراه اليوم يعود أساسا إلى عهد\nالدولة الأغلبية في القرن الثالث هجري أي القرن التاسع ميلادي وقد تواصلت أعمال الصيانة والتحسينات خصوصا في ظل الحكم الصنهاجي ثم في بداية العهد الحفصي.\nويعتبر المسجد الجامع بالقيروان من أضخم المساجد في الغرب الإسلامي وتبلغ مساحتهُ الإجمالية حوالي 9700 متر مربع، وبقياس ما يقارب 126 متر طولا و 77 متر عرضا، وحرم الصلاة فيهِ واسع ومساحته كبيرة يستند إلى مئآت الأعمدة الرخامية هذا إلى جانب صحن فسيح الأرجاء تحيط بهِ الأروقة ومع ضخامة مساحته يعد أيضا تحفة معمارية وأحد أروع المعالم الإسلامية.\n\nجامع القيروان يحتوي على كنوز قيمة فالمنبر يعتبر تحفة فنية رائعة وهو مصنوع من خشب الساج المنقوش ويعتبر أقدم منبر في العالم الإسلامي ما زال محتفظا به في مكانه الأصلي ويعود إلى القرن الثالث للهجرة أي التاسع ميلادي.\nكذلك مقصورة المسجد النفيسة التي تعود إلى القرن الخامس هجري أي الحادي عشر ميلادي وهي أيضا\nأقدم مقصورة ما زالت محتفظة بعناصرها الزخرفية الأصلية.\nالشكل الخارجي للجامع يوحي للناظر أنه حصن ضخم إذ أن جدران المسجد سميكة ومرتفعة وشدت بدعامات واضحة.\nومن آياته أن جمعت بقايا هذه الأمم السالفة لتؤلّف بيتا يذكر فيها اسم الله. وهو ما يضفي على جامع القيروان مسحة إنسانية تؤهّله ليصبح تراثا عالميا قد أسهمت في تشييده حضارات متتالية، وهو يعكس بذلك تاريخ إفريقية على امتداد ثلاثة آلاف سنة. فما من أمير أو خليفة أو سلطان يسعى لجميل الذكر وحسن الخلود ويبتغي ثواب ربه إلا وقد التمس وجها لاعمار هذا الجامع أو ترميمه وتحسين مظهره. فهذا الجامع مرآة ناصعة لتجليات الحضارة العربية الإسلامية في بلادنا.\nوجامع القيروان يمثّل الوجه المتألّق للعمارة القيروانية التي ظلّت من أبرز روافد العمارة المغربيّة والأندلسية عبر التاريخ حيث أصبح جامع عقبة بن نافع النموذج السائد والمثال الذي تحتذي به الجوامع المغربيّة عامّة والتونسيّة خاصّة. وتقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 156 كم من العاصمة تونس. وكلمة القيروان كلمة فارسية دخلت إلى العربية، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش أو استراحة القافلة وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب.",
