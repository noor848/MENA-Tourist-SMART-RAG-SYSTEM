      "content": "Sousse,  Sūsah , or Soussa (Arabic: سوسة, IPA: [ˈsuːsa] ), is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km (87 mi) south of the capital Tunis, the city has 271,428 inhabitants (2014). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Université de Sousse.\n\nToponymy\nSousse and Soussa are both French spellings of the Arabic name Sūsa. The present city has also grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity.\n\nGeography\nSousse is in eastern Tunisia, on the Tunisian Sahel coast bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The city covers 45 km2 and is 25 meters above sea level.\nSousse is between two wadis: the Wadi Bliban (and its tributary the Wadi al-Kharrub) to the north and northwest and the Wadi al-Halluf to the southeast. The subsoil is mostly sedimentary with some deep alluvial deposits, which are more recent closer to the coast. Winters are generally mild, there is an average of 69 days of rainfall per year, and there is a lot of sunshine year-round with relatively few cloudy days.\n\nAdministration\nThe Municipality of Sousse is the capital of a governorate that extends over 2669 km2. It is divided into four municipal districts: Sousse Nord, Sousse Sud, Sousse Médina and Sousse Riadh. The first two were created on 11 February 1976 and the last two on 19 February 1982. Its main constituencies and Delegation are four in number: Sousse Sidi Abdelhamid, Sousse Médina, Sousse Jawhara and Sousse Riadh. Its geographic code is 31.\n\nHistory\nHadrumetum\nIn the 11th century BC, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment (at a river mouth about 9.7 km or 6 mi north of old Sousse) preceded Carthage's but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following Nebuchadnezzar II's long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570s BC.\nThe city featured in the Third Sicilian War, the Second and Third Punic Wars (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding Rome against what was left of the Carthaginians), and Caesar's Civil War, when it was the scene of Caesar's famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor omen this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming \"I have you now, Africa!\" (Latin: Teneo te Africa!) The second city in Roman Africa after Carthage, it became the capital of the province of Byzacena during the Diocletianic Reforms. Its native sons included the jurist Salvius Julianus, the emperor Clodius Albinus, and numerous Christian saints. The Roman and Byzantine catacombs beneath the city are extensive: they were mainly investigated in 1913-1927 by French missionaries and soldiers.\nThe Vandals sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within their kingdom; a bishop and proconsul were martyred there during the Vandals' periodic forced conversions of their subjects to Arianism. The Byzantine Empire reconquered the town in 534 during the Vandal War and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the Umayyad Caliphate's 7th-century conquest of North Africa. According to a 1987 ICOMOS report, Uqba ibn Nafi's siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum \"subsists in situ\".\n\nMedieval Susa\nMuslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the town's harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.\nSusa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.\nMedieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called Sūsī. Especially renowned were its robes called shuqqas, some of which were mass-produced and sold ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.\nAfter the decline of Mahdia in the 15th and 16th centuries, Susa remained as the most important town in the Sahel region, with a population of about 15,000.\n\nColonial Sousse\nTunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. Around the end of the 19th century, Sousse had a population of 7,000 and was the second-most-important city in Tunisia after Tunis itself. At this point, the entire population of Sousse lived in the walled medina. The medina was surrounded by agricultural settlements, two of which - Kala Kebira and Msaken - were more densely populated than the city itself. The French Protectorate reinforced Sousse's role as a commercial and administrative center by establishing public buildings, enlarging the city's port, and building railways. Between 1896 and 1911, railways were built connecting Sousse with Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Mahdia, Moknin, and Henshir Suwatir. Food industries were also established in the city.\nBefore the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese. The port was the garrison of the 4th Tunisian Rifle Regiment.\nThe first developments outside the medina walls were begun during this period, but they were home to a relatively small number of people until after the Second World War. Sousse was devastated by the war and suffered 39 bombardments between December 1942 and May 1943. In 1946, after the war was over, the authorities decided to give a high priority to reconstruction efforts in Sousse.\n\nModern Sousse\nWhen Tunisia became independent in 1956, Sousse was made a wileya capital and it continued to expand in all directions. Over the course of the 20th century, its growth was explosive: from just 8,577 residents in 1885, it had grown to 134,835 residents in 1994. Its physical area had also increased massively, from a compact 29 hectares in 1881 to 3,100 hectares in 1992. The secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy also grew accordingly.\nSousse has retained the Arabian look and feel it assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. With a population of about 200,000, Sousse retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its ribat fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.\nSousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster Bobby Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.\nOn 26 June 2015, a lone gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, opened fire on tourists sunbathing on a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before being shot dead by the police.\n\nCityscape\nDemography\nAs of 2019, Sousse's population was 737,027. Males represent 50.1% of the population structure (with a population of 509,456) against 49.9% by females (with a population of 507,426) in 2014.\n\nPublic services\nThe city contains the University of Sousse, formerly known as the University of the Center, including its Ibn El Jazzar, Faculty of Medicine, the Sousse National School of Engineers, and the Higher Institute of Music of Sousse, founded in 1999.\nThere are a number of high schools, such as the pilot high school of Sousse, the boys' high school, the Tahar-Sfar high school (formerly the young girls' high school), the 20 – March 1934 high school (technical high school), the Abdelaziz-El-Bahi high school or the Jawhara high school, and colleges, such as the Pilot College of Sousse, the Mohamed El Aroui College and the Constantine College.\nSousse is served by a hospital, the Hospital of Sahloul, the largest in the region.\n\nEconomy\nSousse's most important economic activity takes place in the tertiary sector, which employs over 50% of the city's workforce and includes administration, education, healthcare, trade, communications, and banking. Not far behind is the secondary sector, which employs another 45% of the city's workers and includes industries like textiles and leather, construction, chemicals, electronics, and mechanical and electrical components. The small remainder is engaged in the primary sector, mainly fishing. Although smaller than the port in Sfax, Sousse has a port that serves an important commercial outlet for central Tunisia, particularly for the regions around Kairouan and Kasserine.\nSousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after Tunis and Sfax. Although it is associated with olive oil manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An olive grove covering more than 2,500 km2 (965 sq mi) constitutes one of its main riches since antiquity. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many oil wells in the area during its colonial period.\n\nTourism\nSousse is an important tourist resort. It has a hot semi-arid climate, with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by orchards and olive groves.\nOnly 20 km (12 mi) from Monastir and Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend 20 km (12 mi) from the old city (medina) north along the seafront to Port El Kantaoui. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.\nSousse is considered a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.\n\nTransport\nSousse is well-connected with the main Tunisian Railways network, having non-electrified lines to Tunis (since 1899), Sfax (since 1911), and Kasserine (since 2004) with diesel multiple unit and locomotive-driven trains. The main Gare Sousse terminus is in the city center, while Gare Kalaa Seghira serves a bypass route.\nSince 2010 the electrified Sahel Metro line goes south to Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, Monastir, and Mahdia. This line has the Sousse - Bab Jadid station as its northern terminus in Sousse's city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.\nIntercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called louages) connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis. The 600 mm (1 ft 11+5⁄8 in) Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge.\n\nSights\nMedina\nA medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the ribat castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the Casbah with mosaics from the area's many Roman villas. The Carthaginian catacombs can be visited.\nUNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.\n\nPort Kantaoui\nThe Kantaoui Port, is a touristic station in the form of a Port. It was built in 1979 specifically as a tourist center.\nThe architecture, although modern and dazzlingly white, has been modeled on the more traditional buildings in Tunisia, complete with narrow streets and arches. The hotels that line the beachfront extend from Sousse itself along miles of sparkling clean sea to the harbor of Port El Kantaoui and to the north of the harbor.\n\nReligious buildings\nGreat Mosque\nLocated at the entrance to the medina, it was erected by the Aghlabid sovereign Aboul Abbas I (841–856) in 850–851, almost thirty years after the construction of the Ribat of Sousse. This mosque is the most emblematic of a city that became a few years after the reign of Ziadet-Allah I (817–838), the second city of Ifriqiya and the Sahel. Subsequently, the building is enlarged during the reign of Ibrahim II (875–902).\n\nOther religious sights\nBou Ftetah Mosque\nMédersa El Zaqqaq\nÉglise Saint-Félix\n\nSport\nSousse is represented by Étoile Sportive du Sahel, a large multisport club. Football is the city's most popular sport, and ES Sahel has won the Tunisian football championship eleven times and the Tunisian Cup ten times. The team's home ground is Stade Olympique de Sousse. Handball, basketball, and volleyball are also popular.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Sousse's climate as hot semi-arid (BSh) bordering with hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa) and cool semi-arid (BSk).\nThe highest recorded temperature was 48 °C (118 °F) on 28 August 2007, while the lowest recorded temperature was 4.5 °C (40.1 °F) on 27 December 1993.\n\nNotable people\nOns Jabeur, professional tennis player\nSalvius Julianus or Julian the Jurist, a master jurist, public official, and politician who served in the Roman imperial state under four successive emperors.\nPrimasius of Hadrumetum, Roman bishop and exegete, noted for his Commentary on the Apocalypse\nMohamed Ghannouchi, former prime minister\nHamadi Jebali, former prime minister\nAymen Abdennour, footballer\nMakrem Ben Romdhane, basketball player\nDov Alfon, author and journalist\nMarcel Dadi, guitarist who died in the TWA accident of 1996.\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali former President\nSleim Ammar, neuropsychiatrist and poet.\nRihab Chaieb, opera singer, mezzosopran\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nSousse is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nReferences\nFurther reading\nA New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology, and Geography, New York: Harper & Bros, 1860.\nBabelon, Ernest Charles François (1911). \"Hadrumetum\" .

      "content": "Sousse (arabe : سوسة, Sūsa, /suːsæ/ ) est une ville portuaire de l'Est de la Tunisie, située à 143 kilomètres au sud de Tunis, et ouverte sur le golfe d'Hammamet (mer Méditerranée).\nCapitale du Sahel tunisien — elle est parfois surnommée la « perle du Sahel » — et chef-lieu du gouvernorat du même nom, elle est la troisième municipalité du pays après Tunis et Sfax, et la quatrième agglomération, Nabeul étant la troisième.\nLa médina de Sousse est inscrite au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 1988.\n\nToponymie\nDes noms semblables peuvent être trouvés en Libye et au sud du Maroc, comme avec la région du Souss. Souss en marocain est synonyme de rief, ce qui désigne les nomades ou plus généralement les campagnards. Toutefois, le terme de Sousse est ici attribué à une ville, à l'époque symbole de puissance et de sédentarité.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nSousse occupe un emplacement géographique au centre de la Tunisie, sur le littoral du Sahel donnant sur la mer Méditerranée bordant l'Est du pays.\nLa ville s'étend sur 45 km2 et se situe à 25 mètres d'altitude.\n\nAdministration\nLa municipalité de Sousse est le chef-lieu d'un gouvernorat qui s'étend sur 2 669 km2. Elle est divisée en quatre arrondissements municipaux : Sousse Nord, Sousse Sud, Sousse Médina et Sousse Riadh. Les deux premiers sont créés le 11 février 1976 et les deux derniers le 19 février 1982. Ses principales circonscriptions et délégations sont au nombre de quatre : Sousse Sidi Abdelhamid, Sousse Médina, Sousse Jawhara et Sousse Riadh.\nSon code géographique est le 31.\n\nDémographie\nPoids démographique\nEn 2016, l'aire urbaine de Sousse-Monastir est la seconde du pays et comprend plus d'un million d'habitants.\nLa population de la municipalité de Sousse atteint 221 530 habitants en 2014 pour une densité de près de 5 000 habitants/km2 alors que son agglomération (Grand Sousse) avoisine les 400 000 habitants en 2004, 690 000 en 2015 puis 710 000 habitants en 2017, ce qui la place en quatrième position des agglomérations du pays.\n\nStatistiques\nLe taux de croissance démographique (2,6 %) du Grand Sousse en 2004 est le plus élevé des grandes villes tunisiennes et ce, grâce au pouvoir attractif de la ville, de son littoral et des agglomérations voisines ayant bénéficié notamment de coûts relativement bas des terrains et des loyers pour les migrants tunisiens venus à la recherche d'emplois dans l'aire urbaine et dont le flux s'intensifie à partir des années 2000. Ils occupent principalement des emplois dans le bâtiment (23,8 %) ou dans l'administration, l'éducation, la santé (21,2 %), quand celui des anciens résidents prédomine dans le secteur industriel (29,2 %).\nLe taux d'analphabétisme à Sousse est inférieur à 10 %, avec une prépondérance de la population féminine. Le taux d'activité de la population soussienne âgée de plus de quinze ans est supérieur à 50 %. Celui du chômage de la population de Sousse Médina s'élève à 9,5 % en 2014, quand celui de Sousse Jawhara est de 10,2 % avec, dans ces chiffres encore, un taux de chômage supérieur frappant la population féminine. Pour autant, l'ensemble reste inférieur à la moyenne nationale s'élevant à 15,5 % en 2018. Il est à remarquer que, tout sexe confondu, le taux d'emploi est notablement plus élevé parmi les personnes ayant fait des études secondaires par rapport à celles relevant de l'enseignement supérieur.\nPar ailleurs, plus de la moitié des ménages est propriétaire de son logement.\n\nPyramide des âges\nReligion\nEn 2018, 98 % de la population soussienne sont musulmans et 2 % sont chrétiens, juifs ou relevant d'autres religions.\n\nHistoire\nHadrim\nSi les Peuples de la mer se sont sans doute fixés antérieurement dans la région de Sousse, c'est aux Phéniciens que l'on attribue le premier nom connu de la ville. Au XIe siècle av. J.-C. apparaît le toponyme Hadrim qui désigne, selon M'hamed Hassine Fantar, un enclos ou un quartier d'habitation. Les vestiges archéologiques du site ne remontent cependant guère au-delà du VIe siècle av. J.-C., période où Hadrim passe sous l'autorité de Carthage et vit avec elle les guerres puniques tout en maintenant une identité phénicienne comme l'attestent notamment les pratiques funéraires locales. Après avoir perdu la bataille de Zama, Hannibal Barca, qui a des propriétés dans les environs de Hadrim, fait effectuer des travaux civils à ses soldats et est à l'origine de la plantation de nombreux oliviers dans la région.\n\nHadrumète\nHadrim se libère progressivement de la tutelle carthaginoise en établissant des relations économiques et diplomatiques directes avec Rome dont elle prend le parti durant la troisième guerre punique. Après la destruction de Carthage, les Hadrumétins deviennent, selon l'expression d'Appien, les « amis du peuple romain » et la ville, rebaptisée Hadrumète (Hadrumetum), devient une cité romaine privilégiée et libre, et s'enrichit de décorations de l'époque encore visibles aujourd'hui. En 46 av. J.-C., elle perd une partie de ses privilèges et se trouve frappée d'une lourde amende lorsqu'elle choisit le camp des Pompéiens contre le victorieux Jules César.\n\nÀ la fin du Ier siècle, Hadrumète est la première cité africaine à bénéficier du statut de colonie honoraire qui est attribué par l'empereur Trajan. En reconnaissance, des monuments glorifiant le généreux empereur sont érigés : arc de triomphe, théâtre, amphithéâtre, thermes, etc. La prospérité de la ville culmine au IIIe siècle sous les règnes de la dynastie des Sévères. Le commerce de l'huile d'olive jouit d'un grand essor après que le fondateur de la dynastie a instauré une distribution gratuite et quotidienne d'huile à Rome[réf. souhaitée]. La ville frappe même sa propre monnaie. La ville connaît une période de déclin à la suite de sa participation en 238 à la lutte qui oppose Gordien Ier et son fils Gordien II à Capelianus (de), fidèle à Maximin Ier le Thrace. Des monuments publics et des villas sont rasés et le port autrefois si actif perd de son importance.\nLa cité retrouve une prospérité relative lorsqu'en 297 l'empereur Dioclétien fait de Hadrumète la capitale de la nouvelle province de Byzacène qui s'étend sur le centre du pays.\n\nHunericopolis et Justinianapolis\nQuand en 439 les Vandales chassent les Romains et détruisent l'enceinte de la ville, Hadrumète prend le nom de Hunéricopolis tiré du nom de Hunéric (fils du chef vandale Genséric). Elle végète pendant un siècle avant sa destruction par des pillards venus du sud du pays et ce peu avant l'arrivée des troupes byzantines. Le port, complètement ensablé, est remis en état par l'empereur byzantin Justinien dont la ville prend le nom en 535 (Justinianopolis) et devient le chef-lieu de l'une des sept provinces du diocèse d'Afrique. La période byzantine dure environ 135 ans.\n\nSousse\nDébuts de l'islam\nLe début de la période arabo-musulmane peut être fixé à 670, lorsqu'Oqba Ibn Nafi al-Fihri assiège la ville qui prend le nom de Sousse. Elle est d'abord une agglomération pourvue en 787 d'un ribat et habitée essentiellement par des ascètes chargés de la défense des côtes. Le nouvel essor de Sousse vient du second prince aghlabide Ziadet-Allah Ier qui dote la ville d'un chantier naval (821) d'où partent les navires à la conquête de la Sardaigne (821), de Malte, de la Sicile (827) ou de Rome (846).\nAu IXe siècle, la ville s'est ouverte et accueille des musulmans, des chrétiens et des juifs. Elle devient alors la seconde ville de l'Ifriqiya et la première du Sahel. Durant la période fatimide, la prospérité de Sousse ne souffre que modérément de la fondation de Mahdia. La ville, qui exporte ses étoffes en Orient et en Occident, est aussi une prospère cité oléicole.\n\nMoyen Âge\nJusqu'en 1159, Sousse subit les assauts puis l'occupation des Normands de Sicile qui la conquièrent en 1148. Mais sa décadence, à partir du XIIe siècle, est surtout due à la promotion de Tunis comme capitale sous le règne des Hafsides, à l'appauvrissement de l'arrière-pays dont elle constitue le débouché maritime et, au XIIIe siècle, à la concurrence des textiles exportés depuis l'Europe, période durant laquelle des Génois s'installent à Sousse. \nLa ville subit une courte occupation espagnole entre 1537 et 1574. Pendant l'époque ottomane (1574-1881), la ville retrouve son importance. Sousse est alors, au XVIIe siècle, le deuxième port de commerce du pays.\n\nÉpoque moderne\nAux brodeurs et tisserands s'ajoutent des artisans potiers qui exportent leur production dans tout le bassin méditerranéen. À la fin du XVIIIe siècle, la ville souffre des bombardements français (1770) et vénitiens (1784 et 1786). La ville s'enfonce dans le déclin après 1864 lorsqu'elle se range contre Sadok Bey dans une insurrection antifiscale. \nElle passe, comme toute la Tunisie, sous le protectorat français à partir de 1881. La création d'un nouveau port (1884) lui redonne toutefois son rôle de débouché maritime des produits de la steppe. La municipalité de Sousse est instituée le 16 juillet 1884.\nÀ partir de ces dates de la fin du XIXe siècle, Sousse voit l'arrivée et l'installation de nombre d'Européens, particulièrement d'origine française et italienne, qui devront quitter le pays après notamment son accession à l'indépendance.\n\nLe 26 juin 2015, un attentat terroriste islamiste survient dans la station balnéaire voisine de Port El-Kantaoui située au Nord-ouest de la ville. Perpétré par Seifeddine Rezgui et revendiqué par l'organisation État islamique, il fait 39 morts et 39 blessés. Il choque l'opinion publique par le nombre élevé de victimes, d'autant qu'il constitue la pire attaque dans l'histoire récente de la Tunisie.\n\nArchitecture et urbanisme\nLe flanc oriental de la médina est complété par un port agrandi à partir de 1899. Plus au nord s'étend la ville nouvelle construite sous le protectorat français et caractérisée par ses larges rues rectilignes et sa promenade dominant la mer où s'alignent les hôtels en direction de Port El-Kantaoui.\n\nMédina\nLa médina de Sousse, tout comme celle de Tunis, est classée au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco (inscrite en 1988). L'un des éléments qui la distinguent est l'emplacement de la principale mosquée qui n'est pas au centre de la ville. Comme le ribat, elle était chargée de protéger le bassin artificiel de l'arsenal, ce qui explique son allure militaire.\n\nLe ribat a vu le jour durant le règne de la dynastie des Aghlabides (821) mais, après l'édification des murs de la ville en 859, perdit peu à peu sa fonction militaire. Alors qu'à l'étage se trouve une petite mosquée, le sous-sol est aménagé en divers locaux et magasins alors que des traces d'une presse à olives subsistent. L'imposante entrée flanquée de deux piliers de style corinthien est conçue comme une double porte, ce qui permettait de bloquer l'accès à la forteresse. Quant à la kasbah, elle se situe dans la partie la plus haute de la médina et date de l'année 844.\nEn 853, un phare de 30 mètres de haut est baptisé du nom d'un eunuque du souverain aghlabide Ziadet-Allah Ier (Khalaf El Fatâ). C'est dans ses murs qu'est logé le musée archéologique de Sousse depuis 1951.\n\nRemparts et portes\nLes remparts, flanqués de tours carrées ou barlongues, se déploient tout autour de la médina. Les pierres sont posées en assises horizontales avec intercalation de joints et, à certains endroits, en opus africanum. Intégrant la kasbah du côté occidental, ils sont couronnés de merlons arrondis et percés par plusieurs entrées à arcs brisés et outrepassés, reposant sur des pieds-droits et inscrites dans un cadre rectangulaire paré de pierres ; un chemin de ronde en occupe la partie supérieure.\nLes murs du côté de la porte de Bab El Bhar se caractérisent par la présence dans leur partie supérieure de deux séries d'arcades voûtées et superposées, ouvertes sur l'intérieur de la ville et se prolongeant sur une vingtaine de mètres.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nGrande Mosquée\nD'après l'inscription figurant à l'intérieur de la façade en style kufi, la Grande Mosquée aurait été bâtie autour de l'an 236 de l'hégire (soit entre 850 et 851) par le souverain aghlabide Aboul Abbas Ier. La salle de prière a été agrandie en trois étapes entre 894 et 897 en direction du mur de la qibla. Le pavillon coiffé d'une coupole situé à l'angle nord du bâtiment et qui tient lieu de minaret est un ajout ultérieur, contrairement à l'opinion de Creswell, de la première moitié du Xe siècle. En effet, cette coupole est déjà mentionnée dans la biographie du juge soussien El Hassan Ben Nasr El Soussî, mort en 952 : « À la période du marché annuel, lorsque les Kairouanais venaient au ribat, il [le juge] avait l'habitude de s'asseoir sous la coupole (kouba) de la Grande Mosquée de Sousse à partir de laquelle on appelait à la prière et d'où on dominait les portes permettant l'accès à la mer. Lorsqu'il voyait un homme venir avec un jeune à ses côtés, il le laissait venir. Si le jeune était avec son père ou un autre parent, il le laissait passer. Quand il [le juge] suspectait [l'homosexualité], il l'arrêtait de disposer librement du garçon. »\n\nMosquée Bou Ftata\nLa plus ancienne mosquée de la ville se trouve à proximité de la porte sud, plus précisément à la lisière des souks. La mosquée Bou Ftata bâtie entre 838 et 841 porte la plus ancienne inscription sacrée de style kufi en Afrique du Nord sur la façade du bâtiment. Selon la tradition suivie par le souverain aghlabide Aboul Affan, cette petite mosquée mesure seulement huit mètres de côté et porte le nom de l'affranchi Bou Ftata.\n\nMédersa El Zaqqaq\nÀ proximité de la Grande Mosquée, dans la rue de Sicile où les quartiers résidentiels de la médina rencontrent les souks, se trouve la médersa El Zaqqaq qui est flanquée de sa propre mosquée surmontée d'un minaret de style turc. Selon la tradition locale, cette ancienne école porterait le nom de l'érudit marocain Ali ibn Kasim El Zaqqaq (mort en 1506 à Fès). Il est cependant probable que son nom provienne de celui d'un érudit local moins connu, Abou Jaafar Ahmed El Zaqqaq, qui vécut à la fin du IXe siècle.\nLes élèves étaient logés dans les petits bâtiments de l'école et y étudiaient le Coran, la grammaire et la rhétorique. À l'origine, il s'agissait sans doute d'une maison privée qui, sous le règne des Hafsides, fut transformée en école.\n\nSynagogue Keter Torah\nLa synagogue Keter Torah, construite en centre-ville en 1913 et fondée par Yossef Guez, rabbin de Sousse de 1906 à 1928, devenu premier grand-rabbin autochtone de Tunisie de 1928 à 1934 sous le protectorat français, est la dernière synagogue de la ville, où l'importance de la communauté juive s'est considérablement réduite à la suite de la Seconde Guerre mondiale puis de la création d'Israël, de l'indépendance de la Tunisie ou de la guerre des Six Jours.\nDe cette communauté installée à Sousse depuis le VIIe siècle, et qui comptait 4 800 membres en 1921 puis 3 530 en 1946, il ne reste plus que 36 individus en mai 2006. La municipalité rend hommage au dévouement de certains de ses Juifs de Sousse en septembre 2018, en attribuant le nom de leurs notables à plusieurs rues de la ville.\n\nÉglise Saint-Félix\nConstruite en 1911 à la place d'une église devenue trop petite de par l'accroissement de la population catholique, principalement d'origine française et italienne, l'église Saint-Félix est restaurée dans les années 1990 ; elle est victime d'une tentative d'incendie en 2011. Elle sert aussi de lieux de culte protestant et évangélique.\nIl exista aussi dans le passé l'église Saint-Joseph, l'église Notre-Dame-de-l'Immaculée-Conception et l'église Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc qui ont disparu après l'indépendance du pays puis le départ de la population non-musulmane.\n\nCulture\nMusée et catacombes\nSitué dans la kasbah, le musée archéologique, créé en 1951, possède la deuxième collection de mosaïques après celle du musée national du Bardo. À l'ouest de la ville, les catacombes forment un labyrinthe de 240 galeries souterraines se déployant sur cinq kilomètres et contenant 15 000 sépultures.\nLe musée, comme les catacombes, sont l'objet de l'attention de la Société archéologique de Sousse depuis sa création en 1903.\n\nEnseignement\nLa ville abrite l'université de Sousse, anciennement connue comme l'université du Centre, avec notamment sa faculté de médecine Ibn El Jazzar et l'École nationale d'ingénieurs de Sousse, ainsi que l'Institut supérieur de musique de Sousse fondé en 1999.\nOn note aussi la présence d'un certain nombre de lycées, tels que le lycée pilote de Sousse, le lycée de garçons, le lycée Tahar-Sfar (anciennement lycée de jeunes filles), le lycée 2-Mars 1934 (lycée technique), le lycée Abdelaziz-El-Bahi ou le lycée Jawhara, et des collèges, tels que le Collège pilote de Sousse, le Collège Mohamed El Aroui ou le Collège Constantine.\n\nDialecte\nLe dialecte soussien présente les caractéristiques du dialecte parlé dans l'ensemble du Sahel tunisien, le mot le plus caractéristique étant le pronom de la première personne du singulier eni. Cependant, il existe quelques spécificités locales, surtout au niveau de l'accent plus aigu, avec une accentuation de la prononciation du i. Quelques mots sont prononcés exclusivement par les Soussiens comme yahbenni, qui exprime la stupeur ou la surprise, le mot chichma qui signifie « robinet » alors que dans le reste du pays, on utilise le mot sabéla, et le mot chlaka qui signifie « pantoufles » alors que les autres Tunisiens l'appellent chléka.\n\nFestivals et événements\nLa saison culturelle est marquée, chaque 24 juillet, veille de la fête de la République, par le carnaval d'Aoussou. Longeant la plage et remontant l'avenue Habib-Bourguiba en direction de la médina, des chars symbolisant l'environnement, l'enseignement ou encore les communications défilent aux côtés de troupes folkloriques tunisiennes et étrangères.\n\nSanté\nLa ville de Sousse est desservie par plusieurs établissements sanitaires publics, tels que les hôpitaux Sahloul et Farhat-Hached, fondé en 1942, et privés, comme la clinique El Yosr Internationale.\n\nPolitique\nMunicipalité\nLa municipalité de Sousse est créée le 16 juillet 1884, tandis que le premier conseil municipal est composé le 25 juillet de la même année. Le 16 mai 1957, Ahmed Noureddine devient le premier maire de la ville après l'indépendance.\n\nÉlections municipales\nÀ la suite des élections municipales de 2018, Taoufik Laaribi (Nidaa Tounes) est élu maire. Après sa démission, Mohamed Ikbel Khaled, appartenant à une liste indépendante dénommée « Sousse pour tous », est élu.\n\nÉconomie\nSecteurs\nL'économie de la « capitale du Sahel » repose principalement sur l'activité industrielle, ses usines fabriquant essentiellement du matériel de transport, des textiles et des produits agroalimentaires (en particulier des sardines en boîte et de l'huile d'olive). C'est à Sousse, à la fin du XIXe siècle, que les premières presses à vapeur destinées à la production d'huile d'olive, furent mises en œuvre en Tunisie.\nLe marché agricole du Sahel (oliveraies) et le tourisme — notamment grâce à sa position centrale par rapport à de nombreux sites historiques ou balnéaires comme Port El-Kantaoui, Monastir, Hammamet, El Jem et Kairouan — représentent une autre part de l'économie locale. Pôle touristique sur lequel repose une notable partie de son économie, Sousse compte nombre d'hôtels de différentes catégories.\n\nPort\nLa ville de Sousse bénéficie d'un important port de pêche et de commerce.\n\nTourisme\nCes dernières décennies, la ville de Sousse est devenue une destination de choix pour les touristes du monde entier de par la richesse de son patrimoine culturel, outre les atouts de sa station balnéaire, ses terrasses ombragées, ses plages au sable fin ou la douceur de son climat, mais aussi par son excellent rapport qualité-prix.\nPour ce faire, elle offre plusieurs types d'hébergement avec une centaine d'hôtels de plusieurs catégories dont près de la moitié en 4 et 5 étoiles. Construits sur la plage, la plupart des hôtels de Sousse bénéficient de parcs aquatiques, de piscines et de jardins. Néanmoins, depuis la révolution de 2010-2011, une partie des établissements a fermé et le secteur est partiellement en berne à la suite des attentats ayant frappé les touristes de la ville et ceux du musée du Bardo en 2015. Il repart à la hausse l'année suivante.\n\nTransports\nTransport en commun\nLa Société de transport du Sahel (STS) est la seule société offrant un service de transport en commun en bus. La ville de Sousse est reliée aux villes environnantes par un réseau de louages et de taxis qui ne cesse de se développer pour assurer la fluidité de la circulation des personnes.\nLa ville de Sousse est desservie par une ligne de chemin de fer régional, le Métro du Sahel, la reliant à Monastir et Mahdia, sur une longueur totale de 97 kilomètres. Un projet de trois lignes supplémentaires devant rallier Kalâa Kebira, Enfida, Kalâa Seghira et M'saken pour un coût de 500 millions de dinars est approuvé en juillet 2019 par une délégation spéciale du conseil régional du gouvernorat de Sousse.\n\nTransport aérien\nDe l'étranger, on accède à Sousse par avion (aéroports de Monastir et Enfida pour les plus proches ou de l'Aéroport international de Tunis-Carthage), par ferry et bateau à partir des grandes villes portuaires françaises de Toulon ou Marseille via Tunis, et directement de celles d'Italie comme Trapani ou Pantelleria.\n\nTransport ferroviaire\nLa ville de Sousse est un arrêt sur la ligne de Tunis à Gabès et le point de départ d'une ligne menant à Kalâa Seghira. Une réouverture de la ligne vers Kasserine, construite en 1909 et fermée en 1982, est prévue pour 2026 pour des travaux estimés à 550 millions de dinars.\n\nSport\nÉtoile sportive du Sahel\nHistorique\nL'Étoile sportive du Sahel (ESS) est le club omnisports de référence de la région du Sahel. Fondée le 11 mai 1925 et présidée par Chedly Boujemla puis par Ali Larbi Hannachi ; elle est autorisée par arrêté ministériel le 17 juillet de la même année. La tenue de ses joueurs est à l'époque composée d'une « culotte blanche et un maillot rouge avec col et revers blancs et étoile blanche sur la poitrine ».\nL'ESS est alors le seul club de Sousse composé uniquement de musulmans face aux clubs mixtes des Français de la Patriote de Sousse (fondé en 1903, dans lequel Francis Borelli a joué), des Juifs du Maccabi de Sousse, des Italiens de La Savoia et des Maltais du Red Star. \nLe club s'entraîne sur le stade Charles-Henri-Cachelou (inauguré en 1922), du nom du juge de paix français et fondateur de la Patriote de Sousse — qui l'a utilisé originellement — avant d'être rebaptisé « stade M'hamed-Maârouf » (cinquième président de l'ESS) après l'indépendance du pays. L'équipe remporte de nombreux trophées dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, notamment grâce au buteur Habib Mougou (1927-2008), surnommé « tête d'or ».\n\nActivités\nL'ESS est actuellement basée sur l'avenue Mohamed-Karoui à Sousse ; elle comporte six sections de football, volley-ball, basket-ball, handball, judo et lutte. Son équipe de football est l'une des plus prestigieuses du championnat national et joue au stade olympique. Elle est finaliste de la Ligue des champions de la CAF en 2004 et 2005 et vainqueur de cette même compétition en 2007.\n\nAutres associations\nIl existe d'autres associations sportives de Sousse telles que le Stade soussien, une ancienne gloire du football national dans les années 1960, l'Athletic Club de Sousse ou encore la Patriote de Sousse (doyen des clubs tunisiens), sans oublier l'Association sportive féminine du Sahel qui possède des équipes de handball et de football.\n\nJumelages\nLa ville de Sousse a développé des relations de coopération avec des villes de plusieurs continents via l'établissement de relations de jumelage :\n\n Thiès (Sénégal) depuis le 20 novembre 1965\n Ljubljana (Slovénie) depuis le 27 juillet 1967\n Poděbrady (Tchéquie) depuis le 17 mai 1969\n Boulogne-Billancourt (France) depuis le 12 juillet 1977\n Brunswick (Allemagne) depuis le 10 septembre 1980\n Marrakech (Maroc) depuis le 17 novembre 1982\n Constantine (Algérie) depuis le 9 juin 1984\n Atar (Mauritanie) depuis le 29 juillet 1989\n Miami (États-Unis) depuis le 10 mai 1994\n Salalah (Oman) depuis le 20 juin 1994\n Lattaquié (Syrie) depuis le 29 juin 1995\n Izmir (Turquie) depuis le 15 mai 2006\n Weihai (Chine) depuis le 25 août 2007\n Nice (France) depuis le 9 février 2012\n\nPersonnalités\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nAmeur Baâziz et Slah Eddine Ayachi, Si Sousse m'était contée : mémoire d'une ville de 3 000 ans, Sousse, IRIS, 2018.\nAhmed El Bahi, Sousse et le Sahel à l'époque médiévale, Tunis, Centre de publication universitaire, 2004.\nNéji Jalloul, Sousse, l'antique Hadrumetum, Sousse, Contraste, 2006.\nAnouar El Fani, Sousse, mémoire de médina, Tunis, Sagittaire Éditions, 2007.\nLouis Foucher, Hadrumetum, Paris, Presses universitaires de France, 1964.\nKamel Jerfel, Les communautés européennes au temps de la colonisation française : la ville de Sousse, 1881-1939, Sousse, Faculté des lettres et des sciences humaines de Sousse, 2001.\nAlexandre Lézine, Sousse, les monuments musulmans, Tunis, Cérès Productions, 1968.\nCollectif, À la recherche de Sousse d'antan, Sousse, Société archéologique de Sousse, 1984.\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\nRessource relative à la géographie : Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire \nRessource relative aux beaux-arts : Grove Art Online \nRessource relative à la musique : MusicBrainz  \n\n(ar) « Site officiel de la municipalité de Sousse », sur commune-sousse.gov.tn (consulté le 10 novembre 2018).\n\n Portail de la Tunisie   Portail de la mer Méditerranée",

      "content": "## Overview\nSousse (سوسة Susa) is one of the older cities in Tunisia, possessing an authentic medina, which has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Understand\nLocated on the coast, it has good beaches and a clear turquoise sea. It is a popular tourist destination, particularly with Russians, Serbs, Croats, British, Germans and East European people.\nYou will be surprised to see many empty hotels and hotel clubs (permanently closed) along the beach front north of the centre. However, Medina and beach areas are still lively.\n\n## Climate\nIts climate is classified as hot semi-arid (BSh) but is close to hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa). Rainfall is mainly in colder months.\n\n## By plane\nThe most convenient airport is Monastir MIR IATA which is to the south on the coast, 20 minutes away and frequently used by holiday charter flights.\n36.07583310.4386111 Enfidha–Hammamet Airport (NBE  IATA) (located in the outskirts of the Enfidha city).\n\n## By train\nSousse is on the main line from Tunis in the north down to Sfax and Monastir to the south. Since it sits at the railway network's center, it is well placed to reach most of the rest of the network, even as far south as Gabes on the coast and Tozeur on the edge of the Sahara . Example fares from Tunis to Sousse are 10.3/7.6 DT in 1st/2nd class. The main train station is directly north of the Medina (~5-10min walking). Tunisian railways are mainly for goods traffic with passenger traffic taking something of a back seat so don't expect to find yourself rattling along at 100 mph; 50 to 60 mph is more likely and the standard of the rolling stock (carriages) can be poor. That said rail services are generally reliable and above all are very cheap, even for the top class (Grand Classe Confort). They can be an excellent way to get about the country, just don't expect Pullman style travel. The national railway company, SNCFT has a workable website that includes timetables and fares. See also Tunisia#Get around for a map showing Tunisian rail network.\n35.83044510.6362812 Gare Sousse. The main train station.    (updated Dec 2018)\n35.82210910.5692533 Gare Kalâa Seghira, Kalâa Seghira town. It serves the trains avoiding centre.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## By car\nHighway A1 connects Sousse with Tunis. A toll applies for using the highway. Additionally, Sousse is crossed by National Road 1 (RN1), connecting the city with the south of the country, and Libya. Roads are in very good condition. Additionally, a car ferry connects Sousse with Trapani in Italy once a week i the summer months.\n\n## By bus\nBuses connect the city with most other parts of Tunisia. The far bus station (Gare Routière) is in some distance to the west of the Medina at the Souk El Ahad (\"Camel Market\") - the local bus station is next to the Medina in the town center. Prices are slightly lower than those of second class train tickets, but many buses do not have air conditioning.\n\n## By louage\nLouages (shared-taxi) connect Sousse with other cities and towns in Tunisia. The louage station is to the south of the Medina (~30 minutes walking) on Rue El Masjed El Aksa. Louages run frequently to and from Tunis Moncef Bey louage station (11.9 DT, ~1½ hours) from this point. The louage station is well-signed compared to other louage stations and prices are posted by the ticket booths to various cities and towns in Tunisia. Other destinations include Sfax (11.9 DT), Gabes (19.5 DT), Djerba (30.8 DT) and Monastir (2.1 DT).\n\n## By boat\nCar ferries and express boats connect Sousse with Trapani (only in the summer months, once a week for cars and passengers) and Mazara del Vallo via Pantelleria 3 times a week, only for passengers. It takes up to 7-8 hours to Trapani and 5 hours to Mazara del Vallo. Private boats and yachts can use the marina at Port El Kantaoui (a resort about 12 km north of Sousse).\n\n## Get around\nTaxis in Sousse have a bad reputation and the best advice is to agree a price before getting in and ensure that the price is not 'per person'. If you are unsure of what a reasonable price should be ask at your hotel reception. The taxis do have meters, but the drivers are often reluctant to use them; be firm and insist it is reset to the 0.500  dinar \"standing charge\" at the start of your journey. One favourite trick is to leave the previous fare on the meter so that it will be added to your fare before you even set off. Always check that the meter has been reset before setting off and that it is on the correct setting for the time of day. Between 21:00 and 05:00 rates are higher than daytime rates at 0.510 DT/km. However, many drivers have altered their meters, and use \"special rates\" for tourists. A typical daytime fare between Sousse and Port El Kantaoui, with a proper meter, is about 4.100 DT, but, in most cases, with a \"special rate\" on the meter, the fare will be about 7 DT. You can, however, agree the fare before getting in the taxi. Expect to pay about 5-6 DT if you do. Taxis are yellow, and have a taxi license sticker on the windshield.\nIn August 2016, as a single voyager, no problems were encountered with taxis here; all taxis taken used their meters straightaway and did not attempt to play with the rates. - Can not confirm this for April 2019 though.\nShared taxis (louages) are large cars or minibuses/people carriers which start their journey when they are full. Well used by the locals, expect to pay 10% of the price of a taxi. Shared taxis can take you further than regular taxis, connecting the city with most bigger towns in Tunisia. Shared taxis for destinations in the same or a closely adjacent city (e.g. Hergla, Chott Mariem) are also yellow with a blue stripe on the middle of the taxi. Shared taxis between cities (far connections) are white with a red stripe. In Sousse, there are also white taxis with red, black, blue and yellow stripes serving destinations in the greater Sousse area (e.g. Akouda, Hammam-Sousse, Port El Kantaoui, Chott Mariem). They leave from the \"Station Louage\" which is best reached by normal taxi (see above).\nLight rail connects central Sousse by the medina (35.8230410.641574 Station Sousse Bab Jdid) to Mahdia via Monastir. It stops along the way in various neighborhoods in southern Sousse and the Monastir MIR IATA airport (Station Aeroport Skanes Monastir). Tickets cost 1 DT from Sousse to Monastir.\nTuk-Tuk's and Mini-trains can get you a fun ride to Port El Kantaoui, which is about 12 km away. They are open, shared transports and start their journey when they're full (or almost). Expect to pay 2 DT per journey at the first and 2.5 DT at the latter. Tuk-tuks are bright purple.\nHorse-drawn carriages provide another option for a fun ride to Port El Kantaoui at no more than double the price of a taxi (if you bargain).\n\n## See\nAll of Sousse's main sights are located within the labyrinthine medina in the heart of the city. Walk around and get lost in the western residential areas, which have beautiful surprises. There are signboards with a \"cultural walk\" marked out that you could follow. Up on the western side, the medina goes unto higher ground and you can see the sea.\n35.82688110.6396991 Grand Mosque of Sousse (Visitor entrance is on the square at the north side of the mosque. Ask the person sitting next to the door or at the ticket booth at the other side of the square.). 8:00 - 14:00. A surprisingly tranquil place despite its location in the middle of the city. Built c. 850 AD, this mosque is simple and austere in the Aghlabite style, no decoration whatsoever aside from a string of angular Arabic and curved arches. Even the prayer room is covered in reed mats instead of the usual carpet. You must be properly dressed to enter, but traditional dress is available for covering up. 5 DT.      (updated Apr 2022)\n35.82769310.6387082 Sousse Ribat (Via the square north of the mosque.). 8:00-17:30, and 8:00-19:00 during summer. Whilst not as impressive or extensive as the Ribat in Monastir this fortified holy site is a worthwhile visit and served as home to a branch of Islamic warriors very similar in nature and creed as the Hospitaller Knights that lived in Rhodes. Climbing to the top of the watch tower affords you fantastic views over the Medina. 8 DT.      (updated Apr 2022)\n35.82194410.6352783 [formerly dead link]  Sousse Archaeological Museum (Southwest within the old town walls. Entrance is from outside the city walls; no entrance from within.). 9:00-17:00, and it closes 2 hr later during summer. In the gently crumbling old Kasbah on the south-western edge of the Medina. Contains a large collection of mosaics second to the Bardo and other archaeologic artifacts from Roman times. 10 DT.      (updated Apr 2022)\n35.82710910.6354944 Musee Dar Essid, Boulevard Yahia Ibn Omar. 10:00–18:00, and it closes 1 hr later during summer. Extremely charming little museum located just within the old city walls. Approaching the Ribat from Hotel de Paris along the north wall, follow signs for Musee Dar Essid. It was the home of a long standing Tunisian family that has now become a museum with the passing of the last family member. The property centers on an open courtyard from which access to all the rooms can be gained, including bedrooms for the first and second wife and, in turn, to the children's rooms. All are delightfully fully furnished, with some curtains dating back 200 years, and with German clocks imported from the 1800s. The house is complete with a tower, which was used to watch the stars for the onset of Ramadan, from which views over Sousse can be gained - it is higher than the Ribat. There is also a small cafe area with great views. A must see! 5 DT, 1 DT for photo rights.      (updated Apr 2022)\n35.81812410.6264665 The Sousse Catacombs. Closed for reconstruction since 2016. An underground Christian necropolis created in the 1st century. It stretches over 5 km and contains more than 10.000 graves.     (updated Dec 2018)\n35.8329810.6324486 Eglise St Felix.    (updated Dec 2018)\n35.83247810.6397227 Synagogue Keter Torah.    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Do\nPlay golf. There is no golf course in Sousse, but one in Port El Kantaoui and two in Monastir.\nWalking around the fishing boats at the port is a pleasant way to spend time, and families with children may wish to take a trip on one of the 'pirate' ships which offer fishing and other nautical activities.\n\n## Buy\nDon't expect to have language issues as merchants speak almost anything common (French, English, Spanish, German...) - you can mix all languages if you want.\nMedina including the souk located in the center of the city. The old section of the city containing the local bazaar, expect to haggle or bargain.\nSoula Centre just outside the souk has fixed prices, it is useful to establish values before bargaining in the souk (of course there is no fun).\nEverything is pretty cheap, but merchants won't hesitate to quote outrageous prices, so haggling is necessary.  Take it all light-heartedly though and have fun whilst haggling. Obviously, there is a large quantity of counterfeit designer goods available in the Medina.\nDon't waste your and their time if you don't intend to buy anything and if you are only interested in taking a look, make it clear from the beginning. Say nicely and with a smile that you are not interested or that you don't have any money left. However don't feel obliged to buy if you can't agree a price.\nDon't keep thinking about the price after you buy something. Think on the good deal that you have made and the price that you would've paid in your home country.\n\n## Eat\nYou can have a nice meal for around 10 DT or less (depends on the place), but prices are generally low. For this you don't have to negotiate prices.\n\n## Budget\nHôtel Gabes, 12 Rue de Paris (In the Medina). Very spartan rooms but good location and trustworthy staff. A lot of negative reviews. 10 DT for a single room, 16 DT for double. (updated Dec 2018)\n35.82805410.6398071 Hotel de Paris. Spotlessly clean if rather austere hotel near the main entrance to the medina. Singles from 50 DT (June 2025).    (updated Dec 2018)\n\n## Mid-range\n35.83268510.6406672 Abou Nawas Boujaafar Hotel, Avenue Habib Bourguiba, ☏ +216 73 226 030. Great food and services. Thalasso center with an interior (30 °C, salt water) pool, another outside and private beach. 3 restaurants. Deco from the 1980s but not expensive. 5 minutes away from the medina and near all transportations.\n\n## Drink\nDrinking tap water is generally not harmful - some people and almost all tourists prefer, though, to use the bottled water that you can find everywhere (very cheap, for around 0.200-0.400 DT per 1/2 liter, 0.300-0.650 DT for 1.5 liter). Non-carbonated (non-sparkling) water is the most popular, and is called \"mineral water\". Carbonated water is available as well, but you must specifically ask for water with gas (eau avec gaz) or Garci (the most popular brand).\nExpect to find a Coke for around 0.800 to 1.5 DT (depends if in a supermarket or hotel).\nThe favorite beverage of the locals is tea, with many tea based specialties being available at the many cafes and restaurants around town. A favorite amongst locals is the au menthe (tea with mint leaves and sugar) and the aux ammandes (tea with crushed almonds and almond essence). Most locals will drink it while smoking from the chicha (the local name for a hookah). Expect to be offered tea while buying things of relatively high value (over 60-70 DT) from shops in the souk.\nBeing a city in a Muslim country, alcohol may be rather hard to find and quite expensive, because of little demand. Some cafes and stores will sell wine and beer, since many locals also drink these beverages. Expect to pay 2-3 DT for a 0.3 bottle of local beer (invariably Celtia brand), and 2-12 DT for a bottle of local wine in a store (double in a bar). Hard alcohol is very hard to find and extremely expensive (more expensive than even in the Nordic Countries), since most locals avoid it. Your best bets are hotel bars (3-6 DT for 50 ml of vodka or gin) and Magasin General supermarkets (state owned stores, the only ones authorized to sell hard liquor - one is located on 7 November avenue, near the Sousse Palace hotel). A bottle of gin or whiskey is about 80-120 DT. No alcohol is sold on Fridays.\nSousse is one of few places in Tunisia with somewhat animated nightlife (mostly during high season though). There are 2 kinds of places: normal bars, clubs, discos (upscale) and dodgy cabarets (low scale). The last ones are local oriented (music and crowd), and though might represent some interest as a phenomenon, are often frequented by hustlers, which, mixed with a cheap beer, tend to end up in arguments and mass fights (quickly resolved however). Many bars and discos are located in hotels, though most famous ones are standalone venues.\nLiving/Banana/Saloon disco. Free entrance, 5 DT beer, party time 0:00 - 04:00 everyday. Conveniently located in Sousse hotel zone near Samara hotel and Movenpick, these venues although themed differently (ambiance and music), share the same positioning (\"VIP\") and owner (\"Bora-Bora\" open air disco). More chilled touristic crowd; dress smart.\nBe One/B1 club disco. Free entrance, 5 DT beer, party time 0:00 - 04:00 everyday. Located in Port Kantaoui near Houria Palace hotel and Vincci Resort. A sophisticated venue with nice relaxed and partying more Tunisian crowd, European and Arabic dance music, lots of couches, 2 bars, dancefloor and a high platform for cheeky girls to dance in the middle. In low seasons tends to get crowded by 02:00. Dress smart.\nEdge bar. 4 DT beer, party time 23:00 - 02:00 everyday. Located in Cesar Palace hotel between Sousse and Port Kantaoui, Avenue 14 Janvier, near Les Oliviers. One of the many hotel bars (with separate entrance), this one though is somewhat classy with nice and relevant (4 stars hotel) more Tunisian crowd, mixed European and Arabic music. A good place for pre-party on your way to B1. Dress normal.\n\n## Sleep\nDon't compare the category directly to European hotels, expect to take a star (or even two) from these hotels.\n\n## Stay safe\nA terrorist attack at the end of June 2015 killed 38 mostly British tourists.  The UK government still recommends against all but essential travel to Tunisia as a whole, though it has no stronger warning against travel to Sousse as of August 2016.\nThere's no danger from street crime from walking alone at any time. Most streets are very busy till late night. Respect the locals and you will be respected. Crime is nearly non-existent, even if some of the neighborhoods of the city may look shabby or feel dangerous.\nExpect some hassle in the souk (medina) and this is most normal. Merchants always try to show their goods/shops and see what you like. You have to get into the spirit to enjoy, always be nice and have a smile on your face. Even if sometimes annoying, this is absolutely not dangerous.\nWomen may want to avoid the red light area in the north west of the medina, reached through two overlapping walls which screen that street from the rest of the medina. Single women walking alone may be stared at, but, again, this is not dangerous, but rather a curiosity of some local men.\nMost people who come up and speak English to you in the streets will be hoping to sell you something, no risk but end the conversation quickly to avoid them getting indignant when you don't buy, a simple 'non, merci' should suffice.\n\n## Go next\nEl Jem — with its Roman Amphitheatre, approx 70 km due south of Sousse which is preserved arguably better than that at Rome. It was the location for some of the filming in Gladiator. A UNESCO World Heritage site.\nKairouan — an important centre of Islamic pilgrimage and history, west of Sousse. A UNESCO World Heritage site.\nMonastir — beaches and the largest Ribat in the Maghreb.\nPort El Kantaoui — purposely built tourist resort featuring a marina. Said to be both fake and 'touristy', nonetheless  caters well for tourists' needs with a good range of restaurants and bars. It has a zoo, but the one at Figuiera is better, and a water park.\nFriguia Zoo — near the town of Enfidha Well cared for animals. Although not in an authentic setting, see lions and elephants in Africa!\nSahara Explorer — two-day, one-night \"safaris\" to the south of the country can usually be arranged via Tour Companies, local Travel Agents or hotel receptions. Three-day, two-night \"safaris\" are usually arranged via local Travel Agents or hotel receptions. Essentially they are tourist adventures to the edge of the desert which may include, variously, visits to El Djem and its Roman amphitheatre, Berber Arab cave dwellings, the Chott el Jerid - a massive salt lake - and a sunset camel ride in the Sahara amongst other attractions. The three day, two night \"safaris\" are generally the less frantic of the two and allow more time to look around at leisure.",
